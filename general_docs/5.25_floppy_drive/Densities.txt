                         Disk Density Differences                         ========================               File: Docs.Comp.Disks.DiskDen - Update: 1.20                  Author: J.G.Harston - Date: 31-08-1998       There is a bit of confusion around about 3.5" disks concerning howmuch they can store, and what one should be used.  This short article aimsto clarify some of these areas.       3.5" disks with only a single read/write hole are double density(DD) disks, and are designed to store up to 1M of data.  Disks with twoholes are high density, have HD marked on them, and are designed to store1.5M to 2.5M of data.  Most drives detect the hole and refuse to read HDdisks if the computer accesses them for DD. They can be fooled by coveringthe hole with a bit of sticky paper, but this is not a good idea.  Becausethey store twice as much data the magnetic granularity is twice as high,and the recording flux permeability is half.  Now again, in English:       HD disks need to store twice as much data in a single track as DDdisks, so each bit takes half the space on the disk surface.  So, thegrains of magnetic particles must be smaller to fit more particles pertrack.  Also, when writing, HD disks are 'recorded' onto at a lower'volume'.  This may seem contradictory, but the way it works is asfollows:  The magnetic grains are smaller, so if the same recordingstrength is used, the recording will 'stray' into neighbouring areas.  So,when writing to HD disks, the recording flux is lower to prevent itstraying into adjacent areas.       You can try to store HD data onto a DD disk, but it is unlikely tosucceed as the grains are not large enough to store the amount of data.Errors will occur very soon after formatting, if not at formatting itself.       What about storing DD data on a HD disk?  The grains are smallenough for the data, in fact smaller than they need to be.  However, DDrecording strength is twice HD recording strength.  Recording DD data on aHD disk will force the data into the grains, like using a pencil with toomuch pressure.  It will be difficult for the recording head to erase olddata to write new data over it.  The data on the disk will deteriorateevery time something is written to it.       Also, as HD disks are more expensive than DD disks, it is bad valuefor money to use 2.5M HD disks to store only 400K of data.  A similarargument applies to 5.25" disks.  BBC series computers should only use DD orDS/DD 5.25" disks.Therefore,               3.5" DD          3.5" HD               400K HADFS               720K DOS        1.44M DOS               640K ADFS               800K ADFS       1.6M ADFSDisk Formats============Type           Tracks  Sect/   Bytes/  Size    Bytes/  Recording                       Track   Sector          Track    MethodIn order of size:ADFS S         40*1    16      256     160K    4K      MFM     DDDFS/HADFS 40tk 40*2    10      256     200K    2.5K    FM      SDADFS M         80*1    16      256     320K    4K      MFM     DDDOS 360k       40*2    9       512     360K    4.5K    MFM     DDDFS/HADFS 80tk 80*2    10      256     400K    2.5K    FM      SDADFS L         80*2    16      256     640K    4K      MFM     DDHADFS B        80*2    16      256     640K    4K      MFM     DDDOS 720K       80*2    9       512     720K    4.5K    MFM     DDADFS D,E       80*2    5       1024    800K    5K      MFM     DDDOS 1200K      80*2    15      512     1200K   7.5K    MFM     HDDOS 1440K      80*2    18      512     1440K   9K      MFM     HDADFS F         80*2    10      1024    1600K   10K     MFM     HDIn order of track data density:DFS/HADFS 40tk 40*2    10      256     200K    2.5K    FM      SDDFS/HADFS 80tk 80*2    10      256     400K    2.5K    FM      SDADFS S         40*1    16      256     160K    4K      MFM     DDADFS M         80*1    16      256     320K    4K      MFM     DDADFS L         80*2    16      256     640K    4K      MFM     DDHADFS B        80*2    16      256     640K    4K      MFM     DDDOS 360K       40*2    9       512     360K    4.5K    MFM     DDDOS 720K       80*2    9       512     720K    4.5K    MFM     DDADFS D,E       80*2    5       1024    800K    5K      MFM     DDDOS 1200K      80*2    15      512     1200K   7.5K    MFM     HDDOS 1440K      80*2    18      512     1440K   9K      MFM     HDADFS F         80*2    10      1024    1600K   10K     MFM     HDSingle density: using standard drive, recording using FMDouble density: using standard drive, recording using MFMHigh density:   using high density drive, recording using MFMSingle/Double density uses the same drive.

Can do double step/DD to read DOS 360K.3.5"  80*2   HD    1.44M drive.A high density drive is capable of recording up to 10K per track.  Almostall HD drives default to double density unless the computer explicitlytells it otherwise.  Some drives have problems with DFS 1.20 as it timesout too quickly; DFS 1.21 fixes this problem.  With the correct HD driveand driving firmware, they will correctly access both HD and DD disks.A double density drive is capable of recording up to 5K per track with MFMand up to about 3K per track with FM.  There are very few drives that onlydo DD as almost all HD drives default to DD anyway.
