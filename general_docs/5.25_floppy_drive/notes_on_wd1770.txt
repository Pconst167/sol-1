clock: 8MHz

after any register is written to the same register cannot be read until 16us MFM or 32us FM have elapsed.

DDEN = 1 : single density. DDEN = 0: double density.


sector lengths are determined at format time by the fourth byte in the ID field:
00: 128
01: 256
02: 512
03: 1024

number of sectors per track go from 1 to 240
tracks run from from 0 to 240

COMMANDS:

command words are only loaded when the busy status bit has a value of 0 (and status bit 0 is the busy bit)


DIRECTION PIN:
high when stepping in towards center
low when stepping out towards edge



DELAYS:
when writing to command register : wait 48us(FM) / 24us(MFM) to read the busy bit in the status register
                                   wait 64us(FM) / 32us(MFM) to read bits 1-7 of status register

when writing to any register     : wait 32us(FM) / 16us(MFM) before reading the same register
