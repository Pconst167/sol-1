The Western Digital 
1771 LSI floppy disk controller chip revolutionized access to floppy disks. It handled 
much of the disk IO hardware. SD Systems were one of the first companies to present 
the chip on an S-100 board. Their "Versafloppy" was very reasonably priced and was 
the first S-100 board to allow access to 5" and 8" drives from the same card. They 
supplied source code for a simple diagnostic program and also supplied SDOS (their 
version of CP/M) with the card. <br>

<span class="style25">The card first appeared around 1978 . It represented a major 
improvement over the discreet 7400 IC type chips then used on S-100 boards. The 
1791 was a major factor in causing the drift away from the hard sector based Northstar 
disc controller that up until then dominate the 5" floppy drive systems. It was 
easier to program and lent itself nicely to writing a 128 byte soft sector BIOS 
to work with CP/M.&nbsp; Shown above is the first version of the Versafloppy card 
which became known as the Versafloppy-I. Most cards were purchased as kits and were 
supplied with SDOS which was SD-Systems CPM configured to work with their Z80 CPU 
card and monitor.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	SD-Systems supplied a complete BIOS source code and small 
diagnostic program with source code that allowed you to configure SDOS (CPM) for 
your own system. One reason the Versafloppy caught on so quickly was that it offered 
a relatively simple way for cassette based software users to tackle the "chicken 
or egg" problem of being able to write a disk operation system BIOS before actually 
having a disk operating system running to edit, assemble and store the files. At 
that time IMSAI or Altair assumed you were talking to their hardware for their controller 
board. With the SD Systems diagnostic Versafloppy program they supplied an option 
to format, read and write disk sectors on any S-100 computer. You could load their 
SDOS system into RAM, patch in links to your consol IO and get a basic system going 
quickly. To this day, I still remember the feeling of great accomplishment I felt 
the first time I saw my disk directory appear on my CRT with this board. It made 
the hours of hardware building and debugging all worthwhile.<br>

There are actually at least 2&nbsp;versions of this disk controller card out there.&nbsp; 
SD-Systems was one of the first companies to put out a S-100 disk controller card 
that utilized the then new Western Digital 1791 LSI disk controller chip.&nbsp; It represented a major improvement over the discreet 
7400 IC type chips then used on such boards.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1791 was a major factor 
in causing the drift away from the hard sector based Northstar disc controller that 
up until then dominate the 5" floppy drives that started to appear at that time. 
It was easier to program and lent itself nicely to writing a 128 byte soft sector 
BIOS to work with CP/M.&nbsp; The figure above is a picture of such a card. Most cards 
were purchased as kits and were supplied with SDOS which was SD-Systems CPM configured 
to work with their Z80 card and monitor.&nbsp; However SD-Systems supplied a complete 
BIOS source code and small diagnostic program source code that allowed you to configure 
SDOS (CPM) for your own system. One reason the Versafloppy caught on so quickly 
was that it offered a relatively simple way for cassette based software users to 
tackle the "chicken or egg" problem of being able to write a disk operation system

quickly. To this day I still remember the feeling of great accomplishment I felt 
the first time I saw my disk directory appear on my CRT. It made the hours of hardware 
building and debugging all worthwhile.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	The board was designed to work with the Western Digital 1791 
or the later 1795 chips. I will discuss the differences below. From a hardware prospective 
with this board they behave identical.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	As I said above there were two major versions of the Versafloppy II. 
The differences had to do with how the data was obtained from the read write heads 
of the disk. First take a look ate the Western Digital chip specs here. The 1791/5 
chip requires a RAW READ Data (Pin 27) signal which is a 250 ns pulse per flux transition 
and a Read clock (RCLK) signal to indicate flux transition spacing's. The RCLK (Pin 
26) signal is provided by a Phase lock loop circuit on the board external to the 
1791/5 chip. A Read Gate Signal (RG) is provided as an output (Pin 25) which can 
be used to inform phase lock loops when to acquire synchronization. When reading 
from the media in FM (single density). RG is made true when 2 bytes of zeroes are 
detected. The FD179X must find an address mark within the next 10 bytes; otherwise 
RG is reset and the search for 2 bytes of zeroes begins all over again. If an address 
mark is found within 10 bytes, RG remains true as long as the FD179X is deriving 
any useful information from the data stream. Similarly for MFM (double density), 
RG is made active when 4 bytes of "00" or "FF" are de­tected. The FD179X must find 
an address mark within the next 16 bytes, otherwise RG is reset and search resumes.&nbsp; 
All this means that the reliability of the board depends on a good circuit to fish 
out the raw data. On the early versions of the board (up to Rev. C) SD Systems used 
a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%20Manuals/SD%20Systems/NE564.pdf">NE564 </a>chip 
for the phase look loop circuit. On later boards (Rev. P) they used a circuit involving 
a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%20Manuals/SD%20Systems/LM301A.pdf">LM301A</a> OpAmp chip. The rest of the boards 
appear to be identical.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></div>

<img alt="Both Versafloppy II Boards" src="./S100 Computers  wd1771_files/Both Versafloppy II Boards.jpg" width="999" height="316"></p>
<div class="style34">
	<font face="Tahoma">I have used both boards 
and found no differences in terms or reliability or software.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	One major issue with 
all Versafloppy boards however is the fact that they were designed before the IEEE-696 
specs came out. With older Z80 CPUs they work fine. With IEEE-696 systems there 
is a slight problem. It has to do with the fact that the board utilizes the old 
S-100 Clock 1 signal on pin 25 to clock in read and write data strobes to the 1791/5 
chip. It counted on the fact that on older systems Clock 1 was an inverse of the 
main bus clock (Clock 2, pin 24) and that the two did not overlap. With the IEEE-969 
specks pin 24 is pSTVAL. It indicates when the status lines are valid but does not 
guarantee that it will not overlap with the master clock.&nbsp; The easiest solution 
is to cut the trace from the bus going to pin 15 of U9 on the board and "piggy back" 
a 74LS04 inverter IC on to the board. This is somewhat ugly but works fine. A better 
solution is to use one of the IEEE-696 unused lines&nbsp; (I use S-100 pin 27) to 
put on the bus an inverted signal from the master clock (pin 24). You can do this 
from a prototype board anywhere on the bus or use a spare inverter on some other 
board. This way you always have the "old" Clock 1 signal for older boards. You need 
to cut the trace on the board from pin 25 going to pin 15 of U9 and redirect the 
input of pin 15 of U9&nbsp; it to the s-100 pin 27 as shown below. The
	<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/My%20System%20Pages/SMB%20Board/S100%20Bus%20SMB.htm">SMB 
	Board</a> JP10 does the invert of the clock and relocates it to S100 pin 27. 
	Allowing those who have both cards a simple way to do this mod. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>
<p class="style27" style="width: 1000px">
<img alt="Versafloppy II Patches" src="./S100 Computers  wd1771_files/Versafloppy patches.jpg" width="800" height="278"></p>
<div class="style34">
	<font face="Tahoma">
<span class="style25">&nbsp; <br>
	Two other less important changes might also be considered. 
The 1791/5 is initialized using the POC (S-100 pin 99) signal. In theory this should 
be fine because if the chip "hangs" it should be cleared by sending it a software 
RESET command (0D0H). However I found at times the board hung when I was experimenting 
with device drivers etc. requiring a power down and power up to get a POC signal. 
A better solution is to use the S-100 Reset signal (S-100 pin 75). Again a simple 
trace cut and redirection of the input pin 11 of U27 does the trick. See the above 
picture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	It does seem that towards the end SD Systems started to adders 
this non IEEE-696 compliance problem. I have come across a schematic from them of 
their Versafloppy II board as discussed above with the op-amp circuit as well as 
a second schematic labeled "Versafloppy II-696". See the pdf files below. It not 
clear to me if the IEEE-696 board was ever produced.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	Finally for people that wish to move to 16 bit systems and 
emulate the IBM-PC in their system there is a problem with the hard wired base port 
SD Systems use with this board. The base port (from which all IO address to the 
1791/5 go) is 60H. Unfortunately the IBM-PC utilizes ports 60H -6FH for the 8042 
keyboard controller in the IBM-AT (or an 8255 in a PC). I use a Lomas S-100 Video 
Board which emulates in hardware the IBM-PC video and keyboard hardware<span class="style18"> 
and of course requires the 60H block of ports.&nbsp; Also the
	<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/My%20System%20Pages/MSDOS%20Board/MSDOS%20Board.htm">MSDOS 
	Support</a> board uses this port.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	Fortunately it is easy to switch the 
base port of the Versafloppy II to the 50H-57H block (unused on an IBM-PC). To do 
this you must switch the A4 and A5 address lines coming to the board. On the standard 
board address line A4&nbsp; (S-100 pin 30), goes to pin 8 of U23 and address line 
A5 (S-100 pin 29), goes to pin 4 of U16. cut the traces going to these chips and 
switch over the signals. Two wires as shown above does the trick.<br>
	<br>
	Finally please keep in mind the VersaFloppy mods require changes to
	<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Master/Master.htm">Master.Z80</a> if the 
	ports have <span class="style38">not</span> been relocated as indicated

<span class="style20"><strong>Versafloppy II Programming Considerations</strong></span></font></p>
<div class="style34">
	<font face="Tahoma">
<span class="style18"><span class="style25">SD Systems supplied a simple diagnostic 
program to setup and test their original Versafloppy.&nbsp; They even went as far 
as supplying a CPM "look -a-like" called SDOS that would run directly on their
<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%20Folder/SD%20Systems/SBC/SD%20Systems%20SBC.htm">SBC Z80</a> 
system.&nbsp; At the time most users were experiencing the chicken and egg problem 
in that the software they needed to run CPM was supplied on a CPM disk but they 
needed that software configured for their hardware setup. Things like Console I/O 
etc.&nbsp; Fortunately the SD Systems diagnostic program which you could type in 
by hand assemble and save via a Tarbell tape etc. allowed you to load any number 
of sectors from a disk into memory. Since SD Systems supplied the source for their 
BIOS you could easily patch in jumps for your hardware and bootstrap up a working 
CP/M operating system. It was crude but it was a one time only event. From then 
on all software was saved/read/exchanged of floppy disks.&nbsp; Other manufactures 
tended to have BIOS and hardware hooks that were more difficult to figure out or 
were undocumented. The Versafloppy caught on quickly.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	The early drives were single density 
-- indeed single sided drive systems. The almost universal format was the IBM 3740 
8"&nbsp; 128 bytes/sector single sided disk format. While quite reliable and fast 
when compared to cassette tapes such disks have very limited data storage capacity. 
Typically about 270K.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	Western Digital soon brought out a "double 
density" chip which they called the 1791. Instead of FM signal encoding the chip 
utilized a MFM encoding format thereby almost doubling the data density on a disk. 
The gold standard again was an IBM format. One called the IBM System 34 format. 
It utilized 256 byte sectors and allowed recording on both sides of the disk.&nbsp; 
The 1791 was in fact a bit of a rush job. It really did not take care of double 
sided disk recording. It was up to outside hardware to switch the recording heads 
of the drives. They quickly corrected this by bringing out a second double density 
chip called the 1795 which had a dedicated pin (pin 25) for disk side select.
	<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	Fortunately for us Versafloppy users 
SD Systems did drive selection external&nbsp; to the Western Digital chips with 
7400 chips on the board.&nbsp; The Versafloppy board hardware therefore will work 
perfectly well with either a 1791 or a 1795 chip.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	All this would be a mute point if it 
were not for the fact that the sector read and write commands to a 1791 and 1795 
chip are <strong>different.&nbsp; </strong>In order to understand this point it 
might be useful to discuss how the 1791/1795 floppy disc controller is programmed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></font></div>

<span class="style18"><span class="style25"><strong>1991/1795 Commands</strong></span><strong><br>
</strong><span class="style25">The 1791/1795 chip contains five 8 bit registers 
which completely control the chips functions. They are:-</span><br>

</span>This is the register to and from sector byte by byte data is obtained.<span class="style21"><br>

the chip will do.<span class="style21"><br>
<br>
Status Register&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This register

	<font face="Tahoma">
<span class="style18"><span class="style25">First you will notice that the commands 
are grouped into 4 groups.&nbsp; <br>
The </span><strong><span class="style21">Type I commands</span><span class="style25">
</span></strong><span class="style25">control the head movement. Bits 0 and 1 determine 
how fast the head will move from track to track. For most modern drives the maximum 
speed so these bits are 0,0.&nbsp; The V bit determines if the chip will verify 
if it is on the correct track after the head to track movement is complete. Normally 
a 1 but for disk formatting it is set to 0. The h bit determines if the head is 
to be lowered on to the disk before or after the command function is complete.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	The </span><strong>
<span class="style21">Type II commands</span><span class="style25"> </span>
</strong><span class="style25">are clearly the most important (but the most complex).&nbsp; 
Bit 0 of a Write sector 'a0' has to do with disk formatting and need not concern 
us here.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	F1 is another story. On a 1791 chip 
this bit simply determines if the chip is to check if the active head is reading 
from the requested side of the disk. If 0 the 1791 chip skips this side check. If 
1 it checks that the active head is really on the requested side. The side of the 
disk is contained in the Track/Sector ID field. The second byte of this field is 
0 for side A (or a single sided disk). It is 1 for side B.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	For the 1795 chip this bit actually 
outputs on pin 25 a side select level. 0 for side A and a 1 for side B. As said 
above the Versafloppy does not use this pin.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	The E bit determines if there is to 
be a slight time delay (15 ms) in setting the chip's busy flag after lowering the 
head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	F2 on a 1791 chip is relevant if F1 
was set to 1 (enable side compare).&nbsp; If it is 0 the sector side field must 
also be 0 (Side A). If it is 1 then the sector side field must also be 1 (Side B).<br>
&nbsp; <br>
	F2 does something quite different on 
a 1795 chip. It governs the <strong>meaning </strong>of the sector length field 
in the above Track/Sector ID field. For a 128 byte sector on an IBM disk for example 
the sector length flag is 0, a 256 byte sector it is 1, a 512 byte sector (MS-DOS) 
it is 2 and a 1K byte sector it is a 3.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; how the old 1771 and 
1791 chip interoperates the meaning of the byte in the field.&nbsp; <strong>IF</strong> 
the F2 bit is a 1 the 1795 chip interoperates things the same way. If however it 
is a 0 then the meaning of the length fields is switched around. A 0 means a 256 
byte sector, a 1 means a 512 byte sector, a 2 means a 1K byte sector and a 3 means 
a 128 byte sector. The data sheet from Western Digital says its to add on the fly 
sector size flexibility! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	What all this means is that a BIOS sector 
read/write that works for a 1791 chip will nor work correctly for a 1795 chip and
<em>vice versa</em>. The differences are minor but enough to hang to system.&nbsp; 
They are easily taken care of by using "ifdef's x1791 else x1795 endif's" in the 
code. My Versafloppy diagnostic (<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/VF/VF.Z80.pdf" target="_blank">VF.Z80</a>) program illustrates this.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	Finally the m bit allows you to read/write&nbsp; 
contiguous sectors on a track. Very fast! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	The </span><span class="style21">
<strong>Type III</strong></span><span class="style25"> command either reads the 
above track/sector ID field or a whole track. The write track command is primarily 
for disk formatting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	The 
</span><span class="style21">
<strong>Type IV</strong></span><span class="style25"> command, force interrupt command 
is to pull the chip out of a lockup situation. It's basically a chip reset command.----To understand better how to control 
the chip take a look here at a diagnostic program in Z80 code for the Versafloppy-II 
recently I wrote called 
	<a href="http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/VF/VD%20Diagnostic.htm">VF.COM.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming 
this chip was a lot of fun and quite rewarding in allowing me to write a fast and 
efficient CPM BIOS.</span></span></font></div>
<p class="style37" style="width: 1000px">Rememberence: The 1791 chip was 
designed and laid out by Pat Randleman -- well known in the indusrty. It was the 
chip that really launched Westren Digital and got them into the Hard Disk drive 
business.&nbsp; Sadly Pat passed away in October 25, 2009.</p>

<span class="style18"><strong><span class="style35">A Note On Old floppy Disks.</span><span class="style25"><br>
</span></strong><span class="style25">During the late 70's and early 80's I accumulated 
well over 100 8" and 5" floppy disks with data. I stored them in the standard plastic 
floppy cases of the time and generally stored them in dry cool places. Nothing special, 
but no extreme exposure to heat etc. To my surprise and delight I was able to read 
back the data without errors form almost all of them with the above Versafloppy 
II some 30 years later. In one or two cases "rust" accumulated on the 8" floppy 
head and had to be cleaned off. Even high density 1K byte sectored double density 
CP/M 8" disks read fine.&nbsp; Not wishing to push my luck needless to say all data 
is now on my Home Server properly backed up.</span></span></font></div>
