     The Z80 CPeMulator is the latest release of the Z80  program  which
allows  CP/M-80 programs to be run on an MS-DOS computer.  If you have a
V20 or V30 chip, see the shareware information below on how to obtain  a
V20/V30 specific version.


     The Z80 program can run many CP/M 80 programs.  There are however a
few limitations due to  the  minor  differences  in  the  file  handling
structures of MS-DOS and CP/M, and of course any program that is machine
dependent is probably not going to run.

     One area where the Z80 program has problems is when a CP/M  program
accesses  file extents directly.  MS-DOS does not use file extents, thus
they don't exist.  What will happen if an extent is accessed is that the
primary file will re-accessed.  This problem only occurs when the extent
is accessed directly.  Proper sequential accessing or  random  accessing
will not have a problem.

     The  file  extent  problem  occurs  in  programs  that  try  to  be
compatible to V1.x CP/M which did not  have  random  access  capability.
Random  access  was  performed  by  accessing  the  hidden  extent files
directly.  As long as the file being read is smaller than  16K  (can  be
contained  within  one  file extent) this is not a problem.  The problem
only occurs when the file is larger than 16K.  If you have access to the
original code this can be easily solved by changing it to use the proper
random access method.

     Much work has gone into the file handling emulation to allow it  to
work with as many programs as possible while still operating through the
MS-DOS operating system and thus providing all the benefits of operating
under  MS-DOS.  Many  programs  that  are  not  able  to operate in this
environment will operate with the Z80 emulator, including PIP, STAT, and
ED.  The  emulator even supports the IO byte function for those programs
that use it.  (The value is lost when returning to MS-DOS though.)

     The STAT program will not give correct information  in  all  cases,
but as much as can be obtained through its program structure is provided.


     The  SUBMIT  program will not work under the V2080 program since it
is very closely tied to the CP/M  operating  environment.  When  a  CP/M
program  is terminated, complete control is returned to MS-DOS, thus any
hooks  that  submit created into the CP/M environment are lost.  The MS-
DOS batch program should be used instead.  The  batch  program  performs
the  same  function  in  MS-DOS  as the submit program does in CP/M, but
gives you a greater degree of flexibility.


     Programs  which  use  Z80 specific code will not run with the V2080
program. The V20/V30 processors do not have the ability to  emulate  the
Z80  specific  code.  Most  CP/M  programs  are  written  with  the 8080
processor in mind since many CP/M systems used that processor.  The  Z80
processor  was  based  on the 8080 processor, so it can run code for the
8080 processor without any problems.

     Note: If a CP/M program should ever crash on you be sure to  reboot
your  computer  since  the 8080 emulation mode may get left on the stack
causing some weird problems to occur the next time  you  try  to  run  a
program.

     One  way to find out if the program uses Z80 code is to try running
it.  If the program crashes it probably uses Z80 code.  Another  way  to
find  out  is  to send in your shareware donation ($40.00).  Included in
the package that you will receive is the 8080  software  emulator.  This
program  performs exactly the same as the Z80 and V2080 emulators except
that it performs the action entirely in software under the  normal  8088
environment.  Thus  when  a  Z80 specific op-code is encountered it will
flag it and abort the program gracefully.  As with  the  V2080  emulator
you  will receive full source code listings with the program so that you
can modify it to suit your needs.

     If you have a V20 or V30 in your computer, you may want to use  the
V2080  CPeMulator instead.  The V2080 CPeMulator operates in the special
hardware emulation mode of the V20/V30.  Thus you can run  the  CP/M  80
programs at full speed.


     The  advantage  to  using the software CPeMulator is that it allows
you to run the CPeMulator program on a regular 8088/8086 processor, or a
286,  or  even  a  386!  Thus you won't be left out in the cold when you
upgrade to these newer processors.  The price you  pay  for  this  is  a
slower  emulation  speed.  Keep  in  mind though that speed is relative.
Processing speed on a 16Mhz 386 is a whole lot faster than on a  4.77Mhz
V20.


Speed comparisons:

     V2080 CPeMulator on a V20  @ 4.77Mhz =  Kaypro @ 2Mhz
     8080  CPeMulator on a 8088 @ 4.77Mhz =  Kaypro @ 0.5Mhz
     8080  CPeMulator on a 286  @ 8Mhz    =  Kaypro @ 2Mhz
     Z80   CPeMulator on a 386  @ 16Mhz   =  Kaypro @ 4Mhz

     These  times are  very approximate.  The actual times depend on the
programs being run and the particular characteristics of your  computer.
I provided them here to give you an idea of what to expect.





READCPM utility:

     In  addition  to the other programs on the shareware disk, you will
receive a utility program that allows you to read Kaypro II  CP/M  disks
on  your  IBM PC.  The source code for this program is also provided for
the true hacker who wants to dig into it.  The utility is primitive, and
will  not  handle Kaypro IV DS disks, but it does provide a mechanism to
get those CP/M programs onto your IBM PC.

Shareware donations:

     Here's what you get with your donation.

The basic donation is $40.00 American.  For this you will get a disk in-
cludes the following:

   1. The latest version of the V2080 CPeMulator.
   2. The complete source code listing for the V2080 CPeMulator.
   3. An introductory lesson on the V20/V30 processor.
   4. Sample CP/M programs.
   5. The latest version of the 8080 software CPeMulator.
   6. The complete source code for the 8080 software CPeMulator.
   7. The latest version of the Z80 software CPeMulator.
   8. The complete source code for the Z80 software CPeMulator.
   9. A utility program to allow you to read Kaypro II disks.
  10. Complete source code listing for the READCPM program.
  11. A manual and all this nifty documentation.

     Distribution is on a IBM 360K  5.25 inch diskette.
     The 3.5 inch 1.44M disk format is available on request.

     Although  I  ask  that you include $5.00 to help defray the cost of
shipping and handling, don't worry about it if you forget or don't think
it  is  worth  it.   If you send the $40.00 you'll get the stuff anyway.
And of course no one is forcing you to pay anything.   The  only  reason
you  need  to  send  the  money  is to get the above listed goodies.  Of
course if you simply feel that the product is worth  the  $40.00  anyway
I'm not going to complain, and I'll still send you the stuff.





OEM's:

     Are  you  thinking  of  using  the  CPeMulator  in conjunction with
another product?  No problem.  The commercial license for the CPeMulator
is  very simple: I ask that you purchase the $40.00 shareware package as
a one time fee.  As long as you do not modify the  code  and  leave  the
Copyright  notice  intact there is no other requirement.  If you wish to
modify the code and/or change the copyright notice then I only ask  that
you pay a one percent royalty on each modified  CPeMulator product sold.

     One  percent  royalty  on what? Normally royalties are based on the
overall product in which the component is used.  This  is based  on  the
assumption  that  the  overall product would not be possible without the
component.  If the CPeMulator is the only component in the product, then
the royalty would be based on the CPeMulator itself.

     Some  may not feel that it is worth the one percent royalty fee.  I
understand your feelings in this regard.  No one is forcing you  to  pay
the  royalty, I  am  only  asking that you do so.  I will not pursue the
matter if you don't wish to pay it, it is only a request.  Use your  own
good judgment, pay what I ask, what you think it is worth, or nothing at
all.


Full rights purchase:

     Some of you may not want to deal with  the  hassles  of  royalties.
You  may purchase the complete non-exclusive right to use the CPeMulator
as you see fit for $1000.  What you will get is the complete source code
to  the CPeMulator and the right to do anything you want to it including
putting your own name on it and selling it for any price you want.

     The full-purchase rights are non-exclusive to the basic  CPeMulator
package.  What  that means is that you can do anything you want with the
package.  Any derivatives you generate from the package are you own  and
will  be  covered  by your own copyright.  I will not have any rights to
the derivative packages you might produce (unless an agreement  is  made
otherwise).

     What  you  do  not  get is exclusive rights to the basic CPeMulator
package.  I as the author retain the right to the basic package and  any
derivation  that  I  might  make  to  the  package myself, and any other
full-rights purchaser retains the rights to their own  derivations  that
they might make.


Support:

     I do not imply that any support for the CPeMulator will be provided
by sending in a donation, paying royalties, or purchasing full rights to
the  package.   (At  these  prices  what  do  you  expect?)  Any support
arrangement must be made separately on a retainer basis.  That is not to
say  that  I will necessarily not support the product, only that sending
in the donation or purchasing  full  rights  does  not  imply  that  any
support will be provided as a part of the transaction.  The only obliga-
tion that I have in exchange for receiving the donation is to  ship  the
latest source code disk.

But enough weasel words, on to other items...


Modifying the emulator:

     In  many  cases the CPeMulator program may be better suited to your
needs if you modified  it to suit them.  By all means please do  so.  It
won't  crush my ego if you modify the code.  I do recommend that you get
the shareware package first so you know what  impact  the  changes  will
have.

     In  some cases you may have modified the program to the extent that
you may consider it more your program  than  mine.   I  don't  have  any
problems  with  this.   You  have  as much right to your work as I do to
mine.  If you reach this point I only ask that you refer to my  original
work  somewhere.  Something  along  the  lines  of  "Based on CPeMulator
program by Michael Day".  If  you  have  objections  to  even  this,  no
problem, simply don't say anything, I won't be hurt by it.



Your Basic General Disclaimer:

     I  make  no warranties or claims of the fitness of this product for
any particular purpose.

Or to put it in layman's terms...

     I can't control how you use the program or what  you  use  it  for.
Like  all  software there can be no guarantee that the program will work
in your situation. With an emulator program this becomes even  more  so.
There  are  umpteen zillion different CP/M machines out there, and a lot
of programmers write machine dependent code.  Add to that that I am  not
God  (a minor deity maybe...) and thus there are bound to be bugs in the
software.  So don't be surprised if your particular program doesn't work
with the emulator.

Remember:  the  prudent  user *always* backs up everything before trying
something new.




To other shareware authors:

     If you see anything in the shareware concepts brought forth in this
document that you like, by all means plagiarize!









Distribution:

     The  CPeMulator  is  being offered as a shareware product, and thus
there are some things that should be considered in regard  to  distribu-
tion.

     The  basic  product  is being distributed as an archived file which
includes the latest version of the emulator and some  documentation.   I
encourage  you  to  give  the  product  to  your  friends,  place  it in
libraries,  on  BBS's  and  other  areas  where  shareware  is  normally
distributed.  I do however have some basic requests in this.

     Please  only distribute the original shareware archive file so that
the next person will get the same thing as everyone else  including  the
documentation.   Please  do  not distribute the donation response source
code disk.  This is how I support the effort to get the product out.  If
everyone  gets  the  donation  source code disk there is no incentive to
send in the donation, and I lose incentive to continue  with the effort.

     I will send the donation response source code disk  to  anyone  who
sends  the  required $40.00 American.  I recognize that many times there
will be group  purchases  involved.  Though  I  would  hope  that  every
individual  who  uses  the  program  would  send  in  the donation, I am
realistic enough in this to accept what I can get.  I would  rather  get
$40.00 out of every ten users than nothing at all from anyone.


Where does the donation money go:

     The  donation money goes many places, some of them are obvious, and
others not so obvious. Some of the areas where the money goes are:

Purchase of supplies: Disks, labels, shipping  boxes, etc.
Postage: P.O. Box rent, postage on package, fliers.
Travel: Gas and time to and from post office and suppliers.
Package prep: Time and effort to put package together,
              Wear and tear on computer and printer,
              Operating supplies - ribbons, paper, disks, pens.
Support: Answering letters and E-mail, phone, service fees.
Development: Purchasing or obtaining access to equipment to
             expand and improve the product.
Future: Hopefully there will be enough income to encourage me to
        continue to support and improve the product and
        introduce others. If I lose money on this it's not
        exactly going to encourage me to continue...






An open letter to the software industry in general:

     It has long been my considered opinion that since people who  would
think  twice  about  taking  a  pencil  home  from the office will steal
(err...make off-site backups of...)  software  that  there  is  a  major
discrepancy between how the users view software and the way manufactures
do.

     When the problem is as rampant as it is in  our  industry  it  goes
beyond  moral  issues  of theft. It indicates that the software industry
itself is not properly serving the  needs  of  the  customer.  When  the
customer takes the software, it indicates that there is a perceived need
for it.  When they steal the  product, it  indicates  that  the  pricing
strategy is wrong.

     Let's  be  realistic  here,  *nobody*  is  going to pay $700+ for a
spreadsheet package to do their home budget on.  Yet software  companies
get  upset and start screaming foul when the user "borrows" the software
to use it.  The problem here is not the  customer, it  is  the  software
manufacturer  for  placing  the  product  outside the reach of the small
user.  As a result the user is left with a dilemma.  Do  they steal  the
software, use a cheap clone, or continue to use pen and paper?

     In  some  cases the software manufacturer rubs salt in the wound by
taking legal action against the clone manufactures threatening to remove
one of the options available.

     The  end  result of all this is that the end user begins to see the
software manufacturer in a different light, as a predatory robber baron.
This  then  gives  the  end  user the excuse needed to take the software
without regret.

     I am not attempting to apologize for, or justify  software  piracy.
What I am trying to do is understand it and find out what can be done to
solve it.  This is particularly important to me as a software  developer
since the small user is my customer.

     One  thing  is  certain, continuing to treat the small user as pond
scum and laying guilt trips on them in the form of "Thou Shalt Not Dupe"
only  alienates  the customer even further and does nothing to solve the
problem.

     The needs and requirements of the small user are not  the  same  as
the needs  and  requirements  of  the  business user.  As long as we the
software manufacturer continue to ignore the needs and  requirements  of
the  small  user,  that  customer  will continue to ignore our needs and
requirements and the problems of theft will continue.
