
BYTE SMALL-C Version 1.0

Welcome:

You should find on this disk (or, in this archive) all the files you need
to get started with BYTE Small-C.  Of course, I'm presuming that you have
a copy of MASM and LINK around, since BYTE Small-C emits assembly-language
source.  (I don't know whether or not the output is CHASM-compatible, and
I'm CERTAIN it's not Optasm-compatible.  However, a little work with the
conditional branches in the CC4*.C files should fix that.)

You should keep a few things in mind:
1) This is NOT an optimizing compiler.  It THINKS it is...I left the peephole
optimizing routine -- peephole() -- alive, but it doesn't do anything.  The
staging buffer is passed through unmodified, and here's where you I-live-to-
optimize gangbusters can go hog wild.  I'd like to see the results.

2) This version is 8088-compatible.  An 80386 version will follow shortly.

3) We'll do our best to let you know of any bug fixes via Bix and in the
magazine, but this is NOT a supported product.  We've put it in the public
domain so that you can take it in whatever direction you choose.

4) If you create any worthwhile programs in BYTE Small-C, we ask that you
give conspicuous credit to "those who have gone before."  Ron Cain, J.E.
Hendrix, L.E. Payne, and me -- R. E. Grehan.  (If you ever use the
Mac version, don't forget Steve Williams.)

GETTING GOING

If you're just anxious to compile stuff, I've included a working executable
of the compiler -- CC86.EXE.  Let's say you want to compile a file called
"hello.c".  The commands you enter are:
   CC86 HELLO.C
   MASM HELLO.MAC;;
   LINK HELLO   (and when the linker asks for .LIB files, give it
                 CLIB.LIB)

HELLO.EXE will be created, and you're off and running.  Make sure
PROLOG.H and EPILOG.H are available when you do the MASM.  These
files contain segment info that HELLO.MAC needs.  (I'll be many of
you see the CP/M origins of this stuff now.... ".MAC" instead of
".ASM".  Well, if that bothers you, modify the compiler.)

TIDBITS

* ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE:  You can drop into inline assembly language at any time
with the #asm...#endasm construct.  Usually, I do this within entire
functions, like:

  func(x,y)
  int x,y;
  {
   #asm
     .....assembly language code....
   #endasm
  }
If you do this, keep one rule in mind: ALWAYS ALWAYS MAKE CERTAIN THE CX
REGISTER IS CLEARED (ZERO) WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR ROUTINE.  This is critical
for the logical operations to work properly.  Otherwise, you can use whatever
register you want (be careful with the SP, of course.)

* CALLING CONVENTIONS: All arguments are transferred on the stack in 16-bit
form.  Arguments are pushed in left-to-right order, and the "topmost" entry
on the stack is the return address.  You should leave the return value in
the BX register.  An example might make this clearer:

 fadd2(a,b)    /* Add a and b, return result */
 int a,b;
 {
 #asm
    MOV BP,SP		/* Get stack pointer in BP */
    MOV AX,2[BP]	/* Get b value */
    MOV BX,4[BP]        /* Get a value */
    ADD BX,AX           /* Add, result in BX */
 #endasm
 }

Also, unless you define NOCCARGC, a called function will receive an
argument count in the AL register. (This is how printf() knows how many
arguments it receives.)

* THE LIBRARY.  It would be impossible for me to go through a detailed
description of all the library routines and what they do.  You should be
able to get a good idea by reading the code itself.  Most adhere to the
routines outlined in J.E. Hendrix's article "A New Library for Small-C".
(You can find this reprinted in DR. DOOB'S TOOLBOOK OF C -- see the
references at the end of this file.)

The big differences occur in the fileio routines, (cseek, fread, fwrite,
ctell, etc.)

Following is a list of the library routines.  You can use your word
processor to cut-and-paste this list into a batch file if you want to
recreate the library CLIB.LIB.  I've also included a file for rebuilding
the library -- LIBMAKE.TXT.  You can hand LIBMAKE.TXT to Microsoft's
library manager (LIB).  Note that there are a couple of machine-language
files (CALL.MAC, CEND.MAC -- used in by the system library) that you'll
have to pass through MASM first.

A determined programmer could probably make some substantial improvements
in the execution of library routines by simply recoding most of them
in assembly language.  I'd like to see the results if you do this.

Of course, the Small-C compiler itself is in files:

CC*.C


FINALLY:

You'll probably get a better picture of Small-C if you locate the BYTE
benchmark programs and examine the code there (not that those programs
are any lustrous programming examples).  Particularly if you're interested
in doing floating-point stuff, you should look for SCFMXX.C, the floating-
point support files.  There are also support routines for most of the
video adapters in the VIDEO benchmark routines.

Good luck.  Let me know what you think of all this.
