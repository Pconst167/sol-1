Easy makeshift flamethrower

<<<<<<<<Disclaimer>>>>>>>>
If you are searching Internet text file dumps for this sort of information you are very probably an idiot & shouldn't be messing with 
dangerous things like this, I'll tell you now that you will fuck up & maime yourself & it won't be my fault because I told you so.
<<<<<<<<Disclaimer>>>>>>>>

Get yourself one of those pressure sprayer backpacks that are used for bush fire fighting etc, you can get them at rural supply stores for 
about $60(Aud), they have a 20litre backpack mounted tank & most importantly a metal spraying wand & flame retardant hose.

You can fill it with petrol, pump it up to about 50psi, tape a butane stone light to the end as a pilot light & you now have a flame thrower that can 
shoot 30 metres or more.
