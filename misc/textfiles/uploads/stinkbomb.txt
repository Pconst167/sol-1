INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a guide to creating a highly effective stink bomb
for under a dollar. I diagramed everything, so if you cant do it;
you're just pathetic. This method was developed by me, and its useful
when you need 50 stinkbombs and only got like 5 bux. The entire device
can be created by common household utilities. You will need:


*** 1 standard 'Click' Pen

*** 1 'strike anywhere' match

*** 1 bobby pin

*** 2 squares of toilet paper

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP ONE: Take your pen, unscrew the TIP and remove the INK & SPRING

            into the spring and bend the ends so it looks like a 'Y'
            upside down

           not attached to the pen

STEP SEVEN: Screw the pen tip back onto the pen. Discard the Ink
             and make sure the top of the bobby pin touches the
             match head. If it doesnt, adjust the amount of toilet
             paper

STEP EIGHT - USING THE STINKBOMB: Notice that if you pull on the
              ends of the bobby pin hanging out of the tip it will
              spring back fast when released. This will cause the
              match to ignite. Out comes a nice thick sulfuric
              odor with a bit of melted plastic smell that adds a
              nice flavour.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a couple, light them up and toss them into the room, watch as
people get disgusted.

Now, you say that it doesnt stink enough?

Add some Iron-Sulfide. But I desiged the guide to have fun without
chemicals and cash so enjoy if your looking for something to do in
5 minutes or less!
