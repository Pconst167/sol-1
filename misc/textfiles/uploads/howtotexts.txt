A word from the author:

I hope you like my texts and find them useful.
If you have any problem or some suggestion feel free to e-mail me but please don't send mails like

1.What is this text about?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
In this text I want to explain you why and how you should write tutorils and teach the other
people the things you know and the things you can do.
Most of the people keep the knowledge for them and don't want to share it.
This is NOT right.EVERYONE should know and you should share the knowledge with everyone.
That's why people are writing e-zines and texts.They all want to share their knowledge.
Many people just sit down and start writing texts.But if the text is not written well the people 
won't understand what is the author talking about and everything will be just waste of time.
That's what is this text about.To help you understand why you should write texts and of course
how to write them so the people will be able to understand you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

*Note*
A tutorial is a text that has been written so the people can learn something new from it.
The tutorial can learn you how to do something and how to use something.
Today there are many excellent writers our there that keep writing new tutorials

2.Why you should write?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Many people just wonder and ask themselves why should they write and share their knowledge
when they can keep it for themselves.This is not right because can you just imagine what will
happen if everyone is thinking like these people? There will be only several people out there
that will be able to do something and noone else will know their secrets.The knowledge should
be free for everyone and everyone should share his/her knowledge.Because without hacking
we wouldn't have security now.That's why we all should share our knowledge and teach the other.
 Some of you may say "I won't tell a lamer how to break a server or how to mailbomb because
he is a lamer and he'll do something lame".Well this is right because you can't just write a text
on how to break certain server because the lamers are just waiting for that.Be sure what you're
writing.

3.How you should write?
=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Now I'll explain you the basics of writing a tutorial and I hope after reading it you'll all
realize that you can write texts and you'll start doing it.

Before you start writing think what you're going to write,what you're going to tell the people.
Anyway your tutoril will not be good and many people won't understand what you're talking about.
Next you should try to find something about your readers.Who are they?Advanced people or newbies?
Do they know what an exploit or portscanner is?
If you think they don't know these things make a section in your text about Terms there write all
of the terms you've menshioned in the text.In this way if someone don't know what a certain word is
he/she will be able to check the meaning of it.
Always make table of contents in your texts.It will be much more easier for the writers to use your
text.Start the text from a lever begineer and with ever chapter try to tell new things.People will
understand you better.
Now it's time you should write something.Always start and tell what is the text going to be about,
what will people learn from it and so on.Let the reader know what is he/she going to read about.
Try not to make spelling mistakes.Try to be like a professional writer.In this way people will
believe you.Of course make the text in pagargafs.This will help the reader to navigate in the
text if it's bigger one.
Always try to explain the things clear and if you're talking about certain program or
something else put a link where people can download it,because sometime many writers forget about
that and then they got flooded with e-mails from readers about where they can download the stuff.
When writing something don't forget to leave your e-mail for contacts.

4.The bad people
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Of course there are people out there that do really lame things.They find some text somewhere
and they just change the author's name and the e-mail and start destributing the text.As you
see this is really stupid.These people do it because they just can't write so good text and
that's why they just change the name on it.But if you do it be sure you'll get caughed and then
you'll be known as the lamer that steals other people's work.Hackers and such never forget so
they'll always know you as such person.Before doing such thing think what will happen next.

5.Example
=-=-=-=-=
Whenever one text is good or not there are still people that can't understand the things you've
wrote.You can help them and you can do it by inserting an example in your text.The people will
remember the example and you'll help them to understand the text.

Check this out:

You're talking about how someone can steal your password via the phone.Well include in example so the
reader can remember the situation this will help him/her for better understanding of the text.

Hacker:HEllo I'm Mike from the support of your ISP
Reader:Yeah what's the problem?
Hacker:We've lost all of our passwords but we've created a program
that will back up everything anyway you may need to pay some more money
because we've lost your password.If you tell it to us we'll fix that problem
Reader:No problem I don't want to pay more money my password is Lock666
Hacker.Thanks have a nice day

Including such examples will help the reader to understand that and your text.
So when you can include an example of what you're talking about.

6.Final Words
=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Here's the end of the tutorial.I hope you've learned something from the text
and found it interesting.Now I believe most of you will think about some topic
they think they're good in and start writing about it.I'll be really happy if you
all do it because I'm sure everyone can write good tutorials.
