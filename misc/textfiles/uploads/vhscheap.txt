Don't waste your time reading this unless you frequently use vhs 

tapes. Or you could read this and save a buck or 2.

=================================================================

Getting cheap vhs tapes is really easy. All you have to do is go 

to a dollar store and buy some stupid music video for 50cents or 

a dollar at the most. Then you can record over whatever is on 

those tapes. You cant do this right away because they do protect 

the tape. There is a protection from people doing that stuff. It 

is really easy to break the protection. At the front of the tape 

you'll see a square that is caved in. It will look some thing 

like this

All you have to do to break the protection is by filling in the 

square. This could be done by stuffing some newspaper bent into a 

square in there. Or you could just put a piece of tape over it. 

The newspaper usually works the best. So now that you know how 

to do that you can save a buck or two.
