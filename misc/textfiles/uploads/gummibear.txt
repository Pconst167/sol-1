What you need:
-A few packs of Gummi Bears (The little ones that have the bear on them. NOT THE BIG ONES!!!!)
-Car
-Some friends

What to do:
Once you got your packs of bears and you are in your car you are ready to go bearing. Make sure it is night time. The object of this game is to hit cars with your Gummi Bears. To make sure they stick nicely, suck on them for about 20 seconds and then take them out for about 10 seconds and toss them. You will figure out when your bears are ready. If they are too stick throw earlier, if they are to wet and don't stick throw a little later. 

Scoring:
!!!Bear must stick on car and be visible!!!

-Junkie car on side of road = 1 point
-Nice car on side of road = 3 points
-Bear throw in open window of a car = 6 points
-Bear hits a person = 9 points
-Cop car/ambulance/firetruck = 12 points

Rules:
-Give each person a 3 minute time limit to hit cars 
-The other people that are not throwing are the judgers to make sure points count 
-One judge keeps score
-Only one bear thrown at a time
-Add your own rules as you see fit!
