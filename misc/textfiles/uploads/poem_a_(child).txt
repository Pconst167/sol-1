THE CHILDREN
BY: DIzzIE

And the children watch
And the children laugh

As their parents burn
As their parents melt

And the children sing
And the children dance

And the children die from the mustard gas
From the mustard gas out of Hitler's ass

And now the children are dead
And now the voices are gone

And the evil is fed
This is the greatest con

That we children are gone
