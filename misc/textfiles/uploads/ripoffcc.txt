1. First, call your local Cable Company up and tell them that you want to alter your current subscription by adding on all the other channels offered which you are not currently receiving.

2. Next, wait until you start receiving your "new" channels, and then call your Cable Company back.  Tell them you didn't like this new subscription, you don't want to get it anymore, and you would just like to receive the basic package from now on,...

3. Once you are off of the phone, disconnect the main cable from your cable box, (NOT the cable that runs from the box to the  television set, the one that runs into the cable itself.)  Keep this disconnected for two or three days at the most.

4. After a few days, reconnect the cable to the box.  You will now receive every channel... Just that easy, free. 


                        ---------------------------

NOTE: For one billing, you WILL have to pay for the "complete" package...but, after that, you only pay for your new order, the "basic," or "poor man's" package!
