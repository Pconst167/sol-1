The Radio Spectrum - UK Allocations   (version 24feb99)
-----------------------------------

(based on the HTML version at:
 http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/8243/spectrum.html )


A guide from 1 Hz to 30 EHz (DC to Gamma rays). The main bands, all frequencies
in MHz unless otherwise stated. With grateful thanks to the UK Radiocomms Agency
for so openly publishling all you need to know... even if actually tuning in to
anything other than Broadcasting/CB/Ham is not allowed, that's the rules, folks.
Which is why there are no details of Private systems here...

 DISCLAIMER: This page is provided for interest/curiosity only. Private services
 should remain that way, if you listen without a licence (you can't get them) to
 anything other than licenced Broadcasting or Amateur Radio (& CB) you are
 breaking the law. Even having a private frequency stored in a receiver's memory
 channel is considered to be proof of intercepting messages that are not
 intended for you. Penalties include heavy fines and/or imprisonment.
 You have been warned.

 PLEASE COPY THIS FILE FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL USE, SO THAT IT MAY LIVE FOREVER!

So what's the point of this page? Personally, I've been fascinated by the magic
of radio all of my life, fiddling around with radios since primary school, and
over the years having read a fair bit about communication systems and the radio
spectrum, I've now got a lot of radio information rattling around in my head.
I thought it would be nice to share it with the world, via the web, to show
what a crowded resource the RF spectrum is; how every nook and cranny is
allocated to some service or other; how the RA has to balance the needs of
various services when they are asked for more spectrum. Also, with all that RF
energy passing through your body, don't you think you have a right to know
exactly what sort of emissions are zapping through you? (I'm not saying you
have a right to know the content of the messages, only the nature of the
delivery). Also, Amateurs should be aware of the services that could be
affected should their equipment not be up to the required standard. Likewise
to anyone foolish enough to consider operating an unlicenced pirate station
- just don't - there really isn't any point is there? And lastly, because
published books are often out of date or plainly wrong in these matters.

So if you've ever wondered what's beyond the dial on your ordinary radio, this
is the page for you. Just be aware that you shouldn't tune in to anything
private - if someone is talking loudly in the street and you can easily
overhear, you still don't morally have the right to listen do you? If the vast
amount of broadcasts and ham radio conversations aren't enough to amuse you
(and the rest of what life in general has to offer) then that's quite sad. If I
ever have time to switch on my receiver (to see what the propagation's like)
the only bands I need to go to are amateur ones. And good music is much more
satisfying. If you can find it.

In a decade or so there may not be all that much else to listen to anyway on
current scanners, with FM broadcasters moving to DAB, analogue TV making way to
digital, PMR and emergency services changing to TETRA, and both Marine and Aero
traffic increasingly using digital modes and satellites for routine traffic,
cellphones all digital. Maybe the spectrum will one day consist of just one
system for mobile access to THE NET which provides for all possible
communication needs - a load of buzzing noises wherever you tune, except for
the long-established amateur bands! Then you scanner owners can relax, you
won't be able to do anything illegal with them if you try - unless you decide
to throw them through someone's window...

I would say that if you have an interest in these matters, devote your
energies to Amateur Radio PLEASE! We need more activity in the bands. Amateur
radio covers bands from Low Frequencies (with 2km wavelengths) to ultra-high
micro-wave bands (wavelengths in millimeters) with modes ranging from good
old-fashioned morse code (CW) to AM/FM speech (communications bandwidths) to
advanced narrowband speech (Single Side Band) to Television (slow scan like
FAX through to full motion/definition FMW broadcast quality) to digital/data
modes like RTTY and Packet. Transmissions can be direct, fixed and mobile (and
Maritime Mobile), via satellite, bent through the troposphere, bounced off
various layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, or even bounced off
the moon (EME), or shooting stars (MS)! And all for just 15 quid per year -
bargain. Go on - prove you know what you're talking about - take the RAE
examination soon. Even if you don't ever use it...       See the RA web-page,
or the Radio Society of Groovy Britain site for more details, or the "UK Ham
Radio FAQ". And the G7KPF Quick Links page too. Join and support the RSGB also,
it's a good idea as they do tend to negotiate new bands for us.

Of course, I might just be saying all this to divert attention from my 
naughty scanning obsession - and Ham Radio is a boring waste of time! Hehe,
you decide!

Here then, is my quick tour of the spectrum of 1999, with links to other sites
where appropriate.

All information sourced from freely published books, magazines and web-sites
(RA,ERO), without the need for a scanner, as part of an ongoing quest to figure
out what lies beyond the broadcasting bands...


NOTE 1: SAB (Services Ancillary to Broadcasting), SAP (..to Program making),
PMSE (Program Making & Special Events) - when TV/radio/film/programme makers
use radio (managed by JFMG) - like the military and many low-power devices,
they seem to crop up all over the spectrum! However, some of the allocations
in shared bands (mainly BBC) are to cease in 2000, leaving mostly primary
bands.
As Bands I, III, IV and V are designated BROADCASTING it seems logical that
broadcasters may also use these bands for Outside Broadcasts, microphones,
talkback, comm.s and links etc., either in the VHF bands that are no longer
used for broadcasting, or at UHF on locally unused channels. 
Mics at near 174 are very popular, as well as other parts of Band III that
coincide with French TV carriers and so are not used for PBR.

NOTE 2: Home Office for the Emergency Services - previous versions of this
document did not mention these allocations, but as the bands are shown on RA
pages, and in various books, some are now included for the sake of clarity.
Only the BANDS are shown, not actual frequencies in use. Do NOT listen in!

NOTE 3: Military - various web pages will show that there is a world market
for equipment operating in the bands such as HF, 30-87.5 (25kHz FM),
116-155 & 225-400 (25kHz AM), 470-512 etc.  Note that whilst the odd Combat
Net here and there may be "in the clear" any serious tactical use would be
very hard to find. Frequency hopping and scrambling are used - after all,
would you want your country defended by forces that could be easily
monitored?
Operational use (like PMR) for base security, training, Mil. Police, MOULD
etc. involves fixed frequencies, and various books show that Low VHF, Low
Band, Mid Band, 406.1-420 and UHF1 are heavily used for these purposes.
There is currently a general move from VHF to UHF, and the use of a TETRA
system is being considered. This type of radio traffic is still not to be
listened to!

Here is... the Electromagnetic spectrum...

    to      We need a system that allows silent monitoring, like CTCSS, or 
            (even better) a 460 MHz system as they do in the USA, Australia etc.

  29.6    FM calling
  29.55...overseas FM repeaters, to 29.7
          The use of HF spectrum as we know it changes near 26.1MHz, where usage
          becomes more like VHF/6 meters. You'd think that if any Tom, Dick or
          Harriet can use 4W on 26 MHz, that a licenced Class B amateur would be
          able to use at least 3W (novice level) somewhere in this band,
          wouldn't you? But no, 30MHz is the cut off point (despite not
          corresponding to the edge of any practical band usage) where you need
          to pass a Morse test just to be able to use SSB! And who do they
          survey, to see if things should change? The very people who have
          already suffered the ordeal! SELFISH B*****DS. Don't get caught up in
          the way things happened in the past, riding waves of nostalgia, but
          concentrate on the present, the future, what today's very different
          generations could enjoy - share your precious bands with those who can
          already do the same thing at 50MHz when the conditions are right. When
          ever we're at work, that is. Or make the Morse test need to be
          re-taken every five years, we'll see how quickly it gets dropped then!

          Suppose there was no Amateur Radio, but such a service was being
          planned, to start next year, with the rules and regulation we
          currently endure. There would be an uproar, wouldn't there? Nobody
          would seriously suggest a morse requirement. I rest my case.
          We do not NEED different licence classes apart from Novice and Full.
          And don't use that tired old "wally filter" argument, I've already
          gone to the trouble of passing the RA Exam. Don't interfere with MY
          life, go and live your OWN.

          I do acknowledge the "true spirit of amateur radio" (homebrew and
          experimentation) IS different from the fanatical pursuit of "radio
          DXing". I'd settle then for a two class system where existing Novices
          and Class B licencees could use HF SSB on restricted parts of the
          bands using type-approved equipment. With DXing available to the
          public with properly regulated callsigns maybe 27MHz would become a
          peaceful haven for local FM comms, and the Aero (R) 6.6MHz channels
          could be clear at last.

          And I DO realise that CW can get through when all else fails, and
          that if I ever reached 12 words per minutes I might get to enjoy it.
          Maybe. But I object strongly to HAVING to. Similar argument - you've
          no right to force someone to drink something that you're sure they'll
          like. And if you disagree with that, change the subject to sex then
          try again. Again, the Golden Rule in life -
          don't live someone else's life for them - live your own!

          Glad I've got that off my chest...

          87.5 to 88 MHz was once used for base PMR (split -10: 77.5-77.9875).
          97.6 to 102.1 MHz was used by the Home Office for Emergency Services
          AMRT base, until the late 1980s (split to 82.5-84).
          105 to 108 MHz used from 1969 until the early 1990s for mobile JRC
          PBR (split to 138-141), and became available to Broadcasting in 1995.

          Long distance reception is more common via the troposphere here,#
          rather than the ionosphere... i.e  a "lift" rather than "sporadic-E".
          "Tropo" tends to improve the higher the frequency, and lower
          frequencies are not affected; whereas ionospheric "skip" builds up
          from HF, maybe reaching as high as 150 MHz rarely - but leaves higher
          bands unaffected.

          DSI2 recommends that by 2020 when DAB is established, the band may
          be reduced to 97.5-108 for local and community broadcasting only.

          See http://www.javiation.co.uk/vu.html - Javiation's list.

 118.0... AM comms, to 136.975  (25 kHz channels)  
          The use of 136 - 137 dates from 1990, and it's still shared with
          satellite services until 1/1/2002.

          Until the 1970s 50kHz channel spacing was used, and soon some channels
          will be three times closer with 8.33kHz spacings; in Europe in 1999,
          in the UK in 2000.
          So if the scheme is ever extended to the full band, will the first
          channel be 117.983 or 118.0? (Given the 117.975 boundary due to 25kHz
          use of 118.0)

          Channel Names will be used, such as :
          132.000, 132.005 (same but 8.33 bandwidth), 132.010 (132.0083),
          132.015 (132.0166)
          However, don't panic about needing new equipment, 8.33 will only be
          used in a small segment of the band, and not for local traffic. You'll
          be able to enter frequencies using 5 or 10kHz steps and not be more
          than 1.66 kHz out, and likewise you'll still be able to search in
          10kHz steps and that will be faster then 8.33!
          It's no more likely than now that two adjacent channels will be
          strongly in use at any one location.
          In any case, the great thing about airband as far as searching goes,
          is that the controllers TELL the pilots what frequency to go to next -
          so finding any new channels isn't really that hard!

          The USA NexCom solution, though, is for digital TDMA on existing 25kHz
          channels (& also retaining AM capability) using 8-phase shift keying,
          giving 4 time slots within 120ms frames, providing for a mix of voice
          and data. Coverage of 112-117.975 is included in the spec.s - and
          they haven't decided about the UHF band yet.

 156...   Marine, to 163 - International and private 25kHz channels, single and
          dual (split -4.6). Was 50 kHz spacing until SOLAS 1972, new channels
          were fitted in between old...
          Some sets may be set from "international" to "USA" mode, and then some
          of the dual frequency channels can be used as single (ship channel)
          frequencies; which could be handy for a "private" channel, no-one else
          would hear you! (apart from coast stations that use that channel. So
          you'd want to pick a clear one - and bear in mind that if you don't
          you won't be able to hear them telling you to move!)
          Maybe it's best not to, then. Interesting thought though, isn't it?

          There are Euro plans to use the paired freq.s for channels 87 and 88
          separately, to accommodate VTS at 162 MHz, and allow simplex at 157
          MHz. Also plans to allow use of channels 75 and 76 for voice.
          Earlier plans had included simplex use of channels 18 and 82-86.


 156.0-158.4 lines up with 160.6-163.0 at 4.6MHz higher, the lower section being
 the ship/mobile side of dual-freq. channels, the higher side being for
 shore/base.  156.375-156.875 and 160.975-161.475 are not joined, and have
 single-freq usage with international channels at 156 and private at 161.
 The international channels finish at 157.425/162.025 and the rest are private
 channels, which may be dual or single.

 Between 158.4 and 160.6 the mobile channels of a PBR band can be found. As this
 163.0375-165.0375 band utilises a 4.5 MHz split, the mobile side covers
 158.5365-160.5375 - the gap at the bottom is used for a few more single-freq.
 private marine channels, and at the top there are three local authority alarm
 channels.


 Let's track this in two columns 4.6 MHz apart...

 ** First, two single freq.s...

 160.600 99 Coastguards         156.000   0 Coastguards
        (99 was 00 but they couldn't dial that - 00 cleared their console!)

 The first 70 per cent used to be used for the old BT RadioTelephones :
 163.0375... BT System 4, to 164.425 (split -4.5: 158.5375-159.925)
             channels U001-U111 and before that :
 163.050 ... BT System 3, to 164.400 (split -4.5, 25kHz channels 55-1 in
             reverse!) ch17 was control
             (until the 1980's saw the arrival of TACS at 935-950 MHz) 
 164.4375... the top section, to 165.0375, was mainly Private Message Handling -
             operators speaking to mobile doctors etc, and is now seeing more
             Common Base Stations (PBR via a dealer who supplies equipment and
             airtime) including some multi-channel trunked CBS.
             PAMR Public Access Mobile Radio is mainly confined to Band III,
             and as with other trunked systems the control channels are
             continuous).
 163.900...  now PMR dual and single, to 164.2 (159.4-159.7) with many
             Short Term Hire channels.
 164.225...  now used by the Paknet system, to 164.3875 (base continuous)
             The lowest portions are filling up with CBS and PBR.
 Despite this section only being allocated to LAND MOBILE, (12.5 kHz PMR) in
 some books and magazines you may find extra marine channels given (channel
 number greater than 50), either single or -4.6 dual, in the first 150kHz or
 so. Seems a bit odd, that. Marine channels are 25kHz bandwidth too, so that
 ruins half of the 12.5kHz channel above and below. How wasteful.
 And was 160.9 just forgotten about? How sad that it would make my day to find
 out. Another mystery is the continued appearance in lists of the top channels
 165 to 165.0375 being paired with 4.8 higher, rather than 4.5 lower. An RA
 document clearly shows 165.050 as channel 1 in the high band. And 169.8375 is
 a simplex channel, etc.  Makes you wonder...

 Private Mobile Radio channels are allocated in all bands to different
 categories such as :
  National exclusive (53 dual, 12 single here in high band), 
  CBS (8 dual here),
  On-site shared (5 dual, 31 single here - 3km range),
  Wide Area Shared (189 dual - 30kms, taxis etc),
  Short Term Hire (4 - 169.0125, 169.1375, 169.1625, 169.1875),
  STH/demo/"parking"/Test&Dev (1 - 167.2000---172.000),

  UK General (5 single - mobile only, anywhere in UK, 5W ERP max,
              for not more than 12 months in one place).
 Which explains why that "spare channel" can't be used for anything
 else in your area!

   A whopping 6 programmes carried on each transmission. That's 12 in any one
   location then. And that's supposed to be more efficient than the current FM
   system? But I can get two or three times that many stations already, check
   the FM band in London or Paris for example. Progress.
   Ah, they'll say, but we can also use BandII when the analogue signals are
   phased out, and there's L-band too (1.5 GHz).
   Yee-ess, I'll say but try fitting the processing power needed into a walkman,
   and make the batteries last more than half an hour. Ha.
   Oh, silly me, I nearly forgot. We don't really need more than ONE music
   station anyway, as they all play the same 500 tired worn out "hits" over and
   over again.
   And there's never enough advertising revenue to support TWO stations in the
   same area, is there?
   Am I the only person in the UK who wants to listen to good new music, rather
   than the same old Simply Red/Phil Collins/Toto/60's/kiddie pop/REM/Peter
   Gabriel etc? Most people I mention this to usually agree (willingly, too)
   and would rather feel more "up to date" than all this living in the past.
   It is after all a great pleasure to hear a fresh bit of pop and find you
   really like it - that is what makes us go out and buy the stuff isn't it?
   Trouble is, when they do play the latest releases, they play them every hour
   until you're sick if them - if you have the radio on all day at work it'll
   drive you nuts.
   So, from my experience most people are fed up with it, but as there's no
   alternative the audience figures will remain high, that pleases the
   advertisers, nothing needs to change, keep it bland, and the vicious circle
   continues...   How DO they manage to make even music I LIKE sound so awful?

          Rather specialist, wavelengths of less than 30cm really do allow
          for high gain antennas, with very narrow beamwidths. Cable losses 
          become very noticeable and/or untenable. Mobile "flutter" quite
          severe, mobile systems need many more base stations to cover a given
          area. Most useful uses are direct fixed links, point to point,
          satellite (line of sight), low range etc.

          Radio or Far Infra-Red?
          There's a bit of overlap near 1mm wavelengths...


-275,000------(275 GHz)--------
          Far Infra-Red, to 25,000 GHz  (over 1mm to 12m)


-25,000,000---(25 THz)---------
          Infra-red


-441 THz-----------------------
          Visible wavelengths. Otherwise known as "Light".
          Red to Violet (680-420nm).
          Some of my favourite frequencies. Green is rather nice.


-714 THz-----------------------  
          Near Ultraviolet. 300nm-180nm


-1,666 THz---------------------
          Far Ultraviolet 180nm-91nm


-3,289 THz---------------------
          Extreme Ultraviolet 91nm-10nm
          912-100 Angstroms


-30,000,000,000---(30 PHz)-----
          X-rays 10nm-10pm
          100-0.1 Angstroms 


-30,000,000,000,000--(30 EHz)--
          Gamma rays 10pm-100fm and beyond

That's enough. Obsessive? Me?

Frequency  multiplied by wavelength
gives 300,000,000 m/s - the speed of light...
   or 299,792,458 to be more exact.

300 mHz > 3000 mHz       1Gm > 100Mm    easier to count s/cycle than c/s !
  3 Hz  >   30 Hz        100Mm > 10Mm   VERY long waves! Natural 'Earth' waves
 30 Hz  >  300 Hz   ELF  10Mm > 1Mm     Bass!
300 Hz  > 3000 Hz   ILF  1000km > 100km Voice frequencies (sound)
  3 kHz >   30 kHz  VLF  100km > 10km
 30 kHz >  300 kHz   LF  10km > 1km
300 kHz > 3000 kHz   MF  1km > 100m
  3 MHz >   30 MHz   HF  100m > 10m
 30 MHz >  300 MHz  VHF  10m > 1m
300 MHz > 3000 MHz  UHF  1m > 10cm
  3 GHz >   30 GHz  SHF  10cm > 1cm
 30 GHz >  300 GHz  EHF  1cm > 1mm      mainly experimental
300 GHz >   30 THz  THF  1mm > 10um     limits of radio / far infra-red
 30 THz >  300 THz       10um > 1um     infra-red light
300 THz > 3000 THz       1um > 100nm    infra red > visible > ultra violet
  3 PHz >   30 PHz       100nm > 10nm   extreme ultra violet
 30 PHz >   30 EHz       10nm > 10pm    x-rays
 30 EHz >                10pm >         Gamma rays 


1 micron   = 1 micrometer = 1um = 1000nm = one thousandth of a mm

10 Angstrom = 1 nanometer  i.e.  5000A=500nm   1A=0.1nm=100pm

X unit (Xu) = approx. 0.001002 angstrom, or 100.2 femtometers, defined by
M. Siegbahn in 1925. Formerly used for measuring the wavelength of X rays
and gamma rays now measured in picometers (pm) or femtometers (fm).

1 Fermi = 1fm = about the size of an atom's nucleus
