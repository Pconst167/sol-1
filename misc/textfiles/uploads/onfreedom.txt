                               FREEDOM

Do you believe a man can be imprisoned for 20 years, for curiosity?

Do you believe, even after he served his sentence, he still cant use a 
touch-tone phone?
Or a computer?

Yes, this is how we punish curiosity, by barring access to the electronic 
world.
Without that we are nothing.

We are Hackers.

You may stop one of us but you cannot stop us all.
