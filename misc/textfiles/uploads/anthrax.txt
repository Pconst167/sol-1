Introduction:
  After hearing about the anthrax cases in florida I knew I needed to find out some info about Anthrax and share it with
my reading audience. Here is my findings on Anthrax broken down so you the readers can understand.

What Anthrax is and how it spreads:
  Anthrax is a Bacteria that causes illness and most often death. You get it by inhaling it or coming into skin contact with it. It spreads from animals and can be transmitted from humans.

Symptoms:
    About 1-6 days after inhaling Anthrax spores there would be a gradual onset of vague symptoms of illness such as fatigue, fever, mild discomfort in the chest and a possibly a dry cough. The symptoms would improve for a few hours or 2-3 days. Then, there would be sudden onset of difficulty in breathing, profuse sweating, cyanosis (blue colored skin), shock and death in 24-36 hours.

How to NOT get anthrax:
  Eat less meat and eat at home often. If you go out to eat, any food could be contaminated. Its smart not to trust people except yourself so stay at home and eat. Getting a gas mask for safty purposes is a good idea. A gas mask will staop Anthrax. Stay away from sick people. If someone coughs or sneezes or blows their nose then touch your hands. As soon as you can, wash your hands with a antibaterial gel soap perferibly. If you can't wash your hands keep them away from anyplace on your faces. Do not touch your nose or pick your ears or put your hands in your mouth. If you see have any anthrax symptoms, go to your doctor as soon as you can. It might be just a cold but better than safe then sorry. Ask him if he can do a test for anthrax.

End notes:
  Hope fully this will keep you safe from Anthrax. All of this info as far as I know is correct cause i got it from medical document and lectures. As a little side not you might have noticed a name change I am now known as SamDaMan not LOD-BlackManta anymore.
