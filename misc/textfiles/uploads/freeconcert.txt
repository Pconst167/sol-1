Alright B!tches, this is how you get in a big name concert for free.
1.Go to ticketmaster.com
2.Find the Concert you Want to go to.
3.Have your friend buy an Online Printable ticket.
4.Make copies for all of yoiur friends.

You may think this is too easy.  It really is way too easy.  To
protect against this sort of thing the tickets have barcodes which
the ticket says they scan at the venue and only one of the same
barcodes will get in.  But Guess What? They usually don't scan
them!  It's best to check if they are scanning them at the front of
one of the lines, if they are, you're screwed.  If not, Party on.
Stand if different lines to avoid any possible suspision.

Peace,
-Dr Mombo
