How to make a CO2 bomb
======================
Article#3
By:Shadow Wolf

     Ok people. Now in my first article I told you that I would write something on bombs. Now this is just a quick and simple home-made bomb. Great for the uses described in article#1 "How to have fun at night (Anarchy style)".

What you need:
==============

1.An empty CO2 cartridge (any size will do). If it isn't empty just clamp it down and use a nail or small screw driver to puncture it.

2.Black powder or gunpowder. If you can't obtain either of these then go buy some (or steal) rocket engines (class C or higher).

3.Small funel

4.Some type of fuse (if you can't get or obtain these, I am going to write a text on making them).

5.A drill

6.Drill bits

7.A hammer, old newspaper, and a knife if you are using rocket engines

8.A pin (saftey, sewing, ect.)

9.Nail polish remover

Now make your bomb!!!
=====================

NOTE:Only read the first step if you are using rocket engines instead of gunpowder or black powder.

Step 1:Take the rocket engine and cut the paper off of it to expose the hard black tube on the inside. Now discard the grey shit at the end of the black tube. It is saftey powder and not flamable. Now take the black tube and roll it in newspaper and smash it to hell with the hammer!!! Smash it up until it is a fine, fine powder.

Step 2: Take the drill and drill bits and hone out the end of the CO2 cartridge (the end that is puntured) so the hole is a little bigger. This helps to be able to funnel the black powder, gunpowder, or rocket engine powder into the cartridge.

Step 3:Take your powder (gun, black or rocket) and use the funnel to insert the powder into the cartridge. Fill it all the way up and then tap it lightly (LIGHTLY!!!) on a hard surface so the powder settles. Now repeat this until the CO2 cartridge is tightly packed with powder.

Step 4:Now take a the pin and stab it an inch or so into the powder and insert a fuse into the powder. NOTE:As for fuses, they are not covered in this file so find out (if you don't know anything about them) what kind you need.

Step 5:Now take the nail polish remover and coat the end of the cartridge as to hold in the fuse and seal the powder in.

Step 6:Wait till the nail polish remover dries light, run, and BANG!!!!!!!!
