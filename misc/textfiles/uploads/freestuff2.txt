                          [Getting Free Stuff]

This is my favorite form of social enginering.
Here is how to obtain free stuff. Everything from candy to bath soap. The process is easy. You just call the toll free number on the back of the product and complain about it. Now, you cant just make up any story and be silly with it. You do have to give some thought to it. Here are a few examples on how to complain about the products.


[M&Ms]
I got penut m&ms and most of them dont have nuts in them.


[soap]
When I use the soap it has a weird smell to it. 
Or: It has a weird texture to it.



Now in some cases they may want you to send them the wrapper. One time I did this with a 20oz pepsi and they wanted me to send them the bottle.

What you want to do is, in your story tell them you threw away the wrapper or make up some excuse why you dont have the wrapper. They dont always ask for you to mail them the wrapper but they will ask several questions about the product. No big deal though. I'm just letting you know what to expect when you call.

Its a lot easier just to tell them you dont have the product or wrapper. That way you dont have to look for numbers and such on the product. 


One time I called Old Spice and told them it had a bad smell to it. I told them I took it back to wal-mart and they kept the deo stick. I also told them they sent it off to the claims area and told me to call this number.


In all cases of obtaining free stuff they send you a coupon for one free product. Just take the coupon to any store.
