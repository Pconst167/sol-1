How To Build A Parachute

A parachute is one of the best smoking methods around. You can get 
really high with barely any weed. It is an upgrade of the gravity 
bong exept requires no water.

You will need the following materials:

- Empty 2L bottle
- Duct tape or Electrical tape
- A pipe bowl or Aluminuim foil
- An empty plastic Bread bag
- A bit of string

First of all take the 2L and cut off about an inch from the bottom 
of the bottle. Then you take the bread bag and flip it inside out 
and place it inside the bottle. Tape the bread bag in place so 
that no air can escape. Now take the cap and cut a hole in it to 
fit your pipe bowl and tape it in place. If you do not have a pipe 
bowl cut a big hole in the cap and place the aluminium foil over 
it and tape it in place, then you take a toothpick and poke little 
holes in the foil. Now tape the bit of string to the bottom of the 
bread bag.

How to use:

Place a nug in the bowl or on the tin foil, then you light the 
weed and begin to pull on the string slowly. Remember the slower 
the better. Then once the bottle is completely filled with smoke, 
untwist the cap and inhale. Get ready for the biggest toke you 
have ever had! Remember to exhale as much air as possible before 
inhaling the smoke.

I plan to write many more texts on how to build the best homemade 
smoking devices ever!
