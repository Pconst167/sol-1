Preface: 

"The Ancient Book of Formulas," an out of print, public 
domain magical formulary, was posted to usenet in 1999 by 
Laurie Brandt (brandtfamily@sprintmail.com), for which many 
people will be very grateful. 

The edition of "The Ancient Book of Formulas" which Laurie 
scanned is a reprint by Dorene Publishing (of Texas), of a 
book which had originaly been published by Oracle Products 
Corporation (New York) in 1940 and then and by Dorene 
Publishing (New York). The original edition and some of the 
earlier reprints have the Oracle Products Corporation 
monogram (OPC) on the back cover, even after OPC was no 
longer the publisher. Laurie's copy was missing two pages, 
but since she had done so much work in scanning and posting 
already, i added those two pages from my own copy. 

"The Ancient Book of Formulas" is a workbook for customers 
who were at the time of original publication able to buy the 
named Compounds and Bouquets (Stock Oil Blends) from the OPC 
and use them to make up their own dressing oils, incense, 
and so forth at home. This method of marketing blends of 
essential oils was apparently not succesful, for the OPC 
went out of business sometime during WW II. The proportions 
and subsidiary ingredients and colouring agents given in the 
recipes are great -- but you still need formulas of your own 
for the Compounds and Bouquets. 

The uncredited author of "The Ancient Book of Formulas" was 
the same man who wrote several other books under the names 
Louis de Claremont and Lewis de Claremont, most notably, 
"Legends of Incense, Herb, and Oil Magic," which was first 
published by OPC in 1936, then by Dorene in a revised 
edition in 1938, further revised in 1966. If you've read 
"Legends," you will find in it references to "The Ancient 
Book of Formulas." There was also a third companion volume 
in this series, "The Ancient Book of Magic," also by the 
pseudonymous Mr. de Claremont. Two other texts by the same 
author are "Seven Steps to Power" and "Seven Keys to Power." 

Although de Claremont's other titles have been mostly kept 
in print, "The Ancient Book of Formulas" went out of print 
long ago due to the frustrating lack of availablity of the 
OPC compounds needed to actually complete the formulas it 
only describes in part. Used copies sell for between $15.00 
and $25.00 in the o.p. book market, depending on condition 
and edition. Because the copyright was never renewed, the 
work is now in the Public Domain. 

If you wish to acquire a specific recipe for a stock 
oil ("Compound") named in this book, first check in 
the Lucky Mojo Esoteric Archive page called 
Recipes for Magical Potions used in Spell-Casting; 
if the formula you want is not there, try asking for it by 
name (in the subject line) in the usenet newsgroups 
alt.lucky.w 
and 
alt.paranormal.spells.hexes.magic 

Good Luck,

PREFACE 

It is the purpose of the present volume to endeavor to meet 
a need which has existed many years for a complete formula 
book covering the Occult and Mystic Sciences and the various 
products included herein. It is the belief of the author 
that this is the first American book in this highly 
interesting and evermore popular field. It has been his 
earnest objective to include not only the most genuinely 
accepted formulas for the various products but to include as 
many products as research would permit. Consequently it is 
his belief that is the most complete and authentic book of 
its nature ever published in the English language. As a 
Special Feature for the benefit of readers who may find it 
difficult to obtain some of the rare and imported items in 
their local neighborhoods, we have arranged with a group of 
New York Manufacturing Chemists to carry in stock a complete 
line of all the items mentioned in the volume and to sell 
them in small or large quantities to suit the convenience of 
the readers of this book. Consequently if you need any of 
the items herein and want to save yourself the bother of 
trying to purchase in many places, materials which have been 
collected from all parts of the world, just write.

INCENSES 

Man's first idea of perfume started with incense, and was 
accidentally discovered centuries ago when man in gathering 
wood to use in his burnt offerings found that some bushes or 
woods gave-off a pleasant odor when burning. Of these he 
discovered Frankincense and Myrrh and Benzoin which exists 
as gums or sap in trees, and in Sandalwood, Cinnamon and 
Patchouli. In order to be easier understood, it might be 
well to try to classify the Incenses according to their 
ingredients and in their particular services in which they 
are used. 

CHINESE INCENSE 

Chinese Incense always contains as a base Patchouli Leaves 
or Root with a possibility of Cinnamon being added, and in 
some incidents, it is used with Pig Dung. This is used 
sometimes in the Temples on some religious ceremonies. Other 
spices may be added. In the Lama Temples of Tibet, they 
generally burn just butter. 

INDIA INCENSE 

All India or Hindu Incenses contain Sandalwood as a base, 
and they together with any Spice, particu- 

10 

----- 

larly Cinnamon, is 
burned in the Temples. However, some of the Hindu Incenses 
are made more aromatic with the addition of essential oils 
or perfume bases. 

EGYPTIAN INCENSE 

Most Egyptian Incense is the burning of plain Symtra 
Benzoin, however, this may be mixed with a little 
Frankincense and Myrrh as a variation. 

PERSIAN INCENSE 

Persian Incense is a combination using Sandalwood and a 
Spice, mainly Cinnamon, together with Benzoin or 
Frankincense and Myrrh. 

ECCLESIASTICAL INCENSE 

That used by the Catholic Church is Frankincense, however, 
it must be burned with Charcoal. The Catholic Church have 
rigid specifications as to the Incenses used in its Church. 
No aromatic or synthetics may be used. There are occasions 
when some churches will use an Incense containing other 
ingredients than plain Frankincense. As an example, an 
addition of a little Myrrh and Benzoin, Sandalwood or 
Cinnamon. 

11 
----- 

EUROPEAN INCENSE 

European Incenses aromatic or household Incense, which is 
generally made with Charcoal, Sandalwood, Patchouli, 
Cinnamon, Benzoin, and varied with perfume oil compounds 
either in floral odors or a bouquet. 

OCCULT INCENSE 

Occult Incenses are used to create a higher vibration 
according to the specific work involved, and they comprise 
mixtures of all materials used in Incenses with the addition 
of essential and aromatic oils as desired. The field is so 
large, that it would take a book in itself to make proper 
reference; however, the Incense formulas following in this 
chapter will give fairly good idea.. as to how the materials 
are suggested. The following formulas are suggested as those 
found in many of the occult books together with some of the 
more modern versions. The names used are only to designate 
those names which are recognizable from some of the books. 
In order to make an Incense practical and burnable, the 
suggestion is made to use Bamba Wood base, which is 
manufactured especially for this use, and made in one 
hundred mesh finess. 

*These names are used only as a reminder for those used in the well 
known Occult Books.

INCENSES 

Bible Incenses always contains Gum Frankincense and Gum 
Myrrh, mixed with Bamba Wood base or placed direct on 
Charcoal. Bible Incenses may be blended with Perfume 
Compound Oil to give various desired effects. 

Ex. Frankincense grains 1 Ounce 
Myrrh grains 1 Ounce 
Any Compound Perfume Oil 2 Drams 

This is mixed and then a small amount placed on ignited 
Charcoal Block or with the entire amount, mix with. 8 Ounces 
any Bamba Wood Base. In order to add Spice to Incense, 
Cinnamon is used together with other Spices, such as Cloves. 
Lemon, Orange, etc.

SACHET POWDERS 

BASES -- Pure grade Talcum being a mineral product will not 
absorb perfume or essential Oils, there fore as a medium of 
absorption -- use about 10'% Red wood or Bamba Wood Base, 
Sandalwood or Orris Roots. Incorporate the Essential Oils 
into absorption medium first and then mix the entire mass 
into the talcum, add color last, -- a little at a time until 
color or shade suits your taste. 

Other Sachets can be made solely with Orris Root, 
Sandalwood, or a combination of several of the aromatic 
Woods. Tinctures of Peru, Tolu, and Benzoin are used as 
blenders.

OCCULT INKS 

1. Invisible ink is made from a solution of 5% Cobalt, 
Chloride and 95% distilled water which can be purchased from 
any drug store. Use a clean pen to write with, and when the 
ink dries, same is colorless. However, when placing paper 
over heat, invisible writing will develop out blue. 

2. Invisible Ink. This ink is used in two parts, the first 
part being the ink and the second part being the developer. 
Use 5% solution Ferrous Ammonium Sulfate and ~5% distilled 
water as ink. To develop same it will require a 5% solution 
of Tannic Acid in 95% distilled water. After the writing is 
dry with the Ferrous Ammonium Sulfate Ink, a little of the 
developer is gently rubbed over space on the paper where the 
Invisible Ink had been used and same will develop out Brown. 
Both items can be purchased from your local Druggist. 

Since Tannic Acid is also soluble in perfume, it is very 
easy to make up your 5% solution with Tannic Acid and 95% 
perfume and use that solution as a developer.
