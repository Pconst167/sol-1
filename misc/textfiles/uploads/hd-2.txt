                          |  a radio station             |
                          +------------------------------+

      Ok say we have a Half breed Idiot on the radio and what to put an end to
      that persons  shananogins  permanently.  I've  enclosed  a  schematic  on
      making a reception jammer.

      1. When using the jammer place it in a High place. or attach it to  the
         marks chimney. Now you can use a number of different methods on this
         since they all do there job in placement.

         1.  put  a  gator clip on the antenna and attach it to the metal of a
             vent, yeah right on the fucking toilet/sink vent. now  make  sure
             it won't fall down we wouldn't want that would we. FUCK NO!

         2. Place it in a tree near the marks house with a 100 foot antenna or
            at  least  100 feet of wire. 4 feet of 25 lead RS-232 cabling will
            do. Now make sure it's in a tree that he can't reach  into  without
            getting  his  ass  sticked to hell. huge rose bush, bramble patch.
            anything on that line or a in a clump of poison oak ,  IVY.  up  a
            tree  a  huge  fucking  palm tree would work. it doesn't have to be
            right next to his royal pains  house  just  near  enough  like  4
            houses down in a 70/80 foot palm tree. Would do nicely.

         3.  On  the  bumper  of the marks car/van whatever. so your wonderful
             30+ Db signal will follow him everywhere. Place the "KEYER"  some
             were on the car where you can't see it to get at it with ease. and
             glue  that SOB to his car. and gator clamp it to any joe piece of
             metal, Oh make sure you use a insulated gator clamp so  there  is
             no  metal  touching  the  car  for  who  ever shall will lose the
             devices effectiveness permanently. (the device will short out when
             the car starts)

         4.  Bury  the  damn device right next to his antenna about 5 - 6 feet
             beneath it. that way he won't uncover it. but use about 8 feet  of
             25 lead RS-232 cable.

      2. Ham ops (you need to know there freq they hang out on the most. Just
         do the same as the 1st section.

      3.  Jamming  radio stations. Ok so you want to knock out a radio station
          for a certain group of people. Ok our target frequency is  gonna  be
          92.3  FM : Note this is an AM jammer but it'll still cut the mustard
          on killing this Zealot radiostation.

      Scenario : Ok a group of ignorant red necks like  to  blast  there  hick
                 music which sucks and if you ask them to turn it down they'll
                 point  a  shotgun or whatever at you and tell you "you faggot
                 yankee get the fuck away from me and my house/truck/car.


          1. Buy a 92.300mhz crystal from your nearest electronics shop. Ok now
             that you have it. Place it in your jammer. now  it  should  knock
             out that radio station. Oops it's not, Hmmm you might have to add
             a  little  sound  to  it.  find  a  schematic for a tone sweep bug
             detector. they work just fine  and  dandy.  now  in  place  of  a
             speaker  hook  the  sweep up to the mic leads on your jammer. you
             should have a nice anoying tone come across the Stereo. and  will
             now  block  out  the radio station. Note this isn't like jamming a
             short wave radio, We are now in the  30  -  499  range  (VHF)  so
             signals  tend to not go as far as in the short wave. Just read up
             on a VHF mag for making a good  Diapole  antenna.  about  4  foot
             single  lead  wire  will  work.  or use the gator clamp method on
             there truck and house. They'll never know what's up and probably go
             out and get there radio's repaired. (there not  even  busted)  if
             they  do  this  get out your slang dictionary and look up the term
             Monrose Mind Fuck. This is what your doing to them now.

      Notes about the schematic
      =========================

      1.  GND means ground

      2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
          connected.

      3.  Where you see:  )(
                          ()
                          )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                             regular hook-up wire around it.

      4.   The  middle  of  the  loop  on the left side (the left of "()") you
           should run a wire down to the "+" which  has  nothing  attached  to
           it.  There is a .0047 capacitor on the correct piece of wire.

      5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).

      6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about  8  feet  of  wire  to
          broadcast  approx  300ft.  Part  15 of the FCC rules and regulations
          says  you can't broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha).
          Use  more  wire for an antenna for longer distances.

      Operation of the Jammer
      =======================

      This  transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band.  You use
      the variable capacitor to adjust what freq.  you want to  use.   Find  a
      good  target  freq.   down at the lower end of the scale and you're set.
      Use the 5 meg pot. to adjust gain.  Just fuck with it until you get what
      sounds good.  The switch on the 5meg is for turning the radio jammer  on
      and  off.  When everything is adjusted, turn on an AM radio adjust it to
      where you think the signal is.  Have a friend say some shit thru the mic
      and tune in to it. That's all there is to it.

      for  night  turn  on  day  turn  off.  (sorta like thoughs neat flashers
      on the barracades.)

      follow this circuit plan.

      Items needed :

      1 7-12 volt relay SPDT.
      1 9volt battery
      1 CdS cell (must make 9volt side dip below 7 volts.)
