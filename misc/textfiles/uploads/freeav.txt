 I've seen other free internet providers such as Netzero and Worldspy,
but they don't fufill my needs, because their file sizes are just too 
large and if you're on a 33.6 modem like me, you'll hate downloading
Netzero (around 3.5 to 4 megs). Also, some people say, "Worldspy is
cool because there is no ad and its free." -- Yes it is true but the 
download is around 8 megs, and for some reason it never seemed to 
connect for me. Altavista is only 650K, so its a short download.

Heres how to get rid of the Ad banner from Altavista, and it's pretty
easy to do.

1) Download the program from altavista.com. There should be a link on
the front page for it. Then install it.

2) Download a program called ProcessView from www.spytech-web.com. It
shows you which programs are running in the background. It's free 
and made by Spytech software. They have a lot of other good programs,
so look around. 

3) Start up Altavista, but dont' connect. Then start up ProcessView 
and push the 'Refresh' button.

4) Connect with the Altavista program.

5) Then next steps you must do fairly quickly in order to work.

6) Wait until Altavista says 'Initializing AltaVista Free Access. 
Please wait.' 

7) Switch to the ProcessView window. Now, select the FIRST entry that 
says 'FreeAV' and click 'KillProc' and answer yes.
 ( You can use CTRL+ALT+DEL in place of ProcessView, because it should
work, but for some reason it does not work on my computer. )

8) You should be left with a connection icon in the systray without the
ad window.
