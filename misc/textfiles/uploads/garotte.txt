GAROTTE MAKING
by: DIzzIE (c. 2000)

The garotte (also spelled garrote) is one of the easiest weapons to make at home. With a few primitive materials you can make a simple, yet, of course, deadly assassin weapon. You will need a thin, tight, strong string (such as fishing wire or trip wire), and two small rod-shaped sticks, metal, plastic, wood, or other. Tie the string at both ends to the sticks (one end of the string to one stick, other end to other stick). Now you've got a functioning (if you didn't screw anything up) garotte. 
	You use it by coming up behind your target, putting the string over his head, then sharply pull and cross the sticks (the handles) until your target has choked, and is dead.
See? It's all so damn simple...
