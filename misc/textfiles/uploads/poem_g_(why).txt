
WHY?
BY: DIzzIE

Why am I living if my life sucks so?
Why can't I just take the gun and go?

Why am I stuck in this cage?
Filling up with hatred and rage?

I am stuck in this shell
and it is such hell

I want to go to sleep
and dream AND DREAM
that there is no waking up, 
no damn tomorow

'cuss I can't waste another day 
living this fucking shit-su-fley
NEY!

Please. beatiful stranger, take this semi-automatic, 

or make me swallow the damn pill
please push me of the hill

let me sleep
and don't you weep

I shall be at peace once more
at pain no more

But now I'm here, writing, trying to jab the dagger in me heart

you just have to understand
choke me with you god-blessed hand

I don't like this
NO, I hate this

All I want is bliss in ashes,
if you burn me that's what I'll get

I can't stand it living here,
in this shitbox called the earth

so please, I can't do it, so, will you?
Just pull the trigger and ku-ka-ru!
