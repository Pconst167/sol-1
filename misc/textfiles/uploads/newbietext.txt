     Almost everyday when I am online I do searches for different texts
to increase my knowledge.I have noticed that all of the texts I have come across are individulaized.So I decided to write this text that
consists of all of the ''need to know'' newbie knowledge.I do not condone the use of any of this information......Now on with the show...


         I am asked atleast 3 times a day by some newbie fuck that is too god damn lazy to research for himself ''How do I hack AOL?''.The following paragraphs will explain just that.
                     

1-(Sending Random Instant Messages)
2-(Text Manipulation)
3-(Download for free and talk while downloading)
4-(Chat for free on AOL)
5-(Using credit card numbers on AOL)
6-(Password Fishing)
7-(Booting people offline)
8-(The ''Ghost'' Trick)



   1-Go to "Send Instant Message" under the members pull down menu.  Now, in the space where it says ''To'',space over exactly 10 (ten) times.Then type in the message and send.

   2-1st, using your mouse, highlight three lines of
text in the chat room.  Make sure that all three lines have been said by
different people, and that you also highlight their screen names!  Then, go
to the edit bar, and select copy.  After that, Click your mouse on the spot
where you write what you want to say...  Then go back up to the edit bar, and
click paste.  All of the text that you have highlighted should show up where
you type in what you want to say.  Now, find the screen name that has 2
little sqaures in front of it, and 1 behind it.  Delete everything, except
that and the colon in-between them.  Once you've done that, type what you
want to say after the squares, and type the persons screen name for who you
want to say it in side the squares.  Then just send it, and it should
work.
     
   3-1. Start the download    2. Hit ALT-TAB

     3. Once you are in program manager hit ALT-F4

     4. Windows will then say Exiting Windows "yes" 
  	                    or "cancel"...hit ye                            5. AOL will then ask you if you want to exit

     6. Hit "no"
 
     7. Your cursor will come back, you then can go 
		        to a chat area and talk while your download
		        it still going.

     8. The download window will still be there until
		      the download is complete

     9. If you wanna download for free, do what
		          I explained above and instead of staying
	                        in a chat area and talking just go into	
		          a free area while it's downloading.                                                                                                                                                             
     3-Ok...the first thing you do is click on the box at the bottom that says
discover AOL.  Now choose "Best of AOL".  Then minimize both windows.
Next...minimize the welcome screen...Ok almost there...now enter the free
area and go to the "Windows" pull down
menu.  Select "Best of AOL".  When it asks you if you want to leave the free
area select "NO".  Guess what?  The window opens anyway.  Now move down until
you see "Chat Live".  Click on it and it sends you to chat.  Essentialy you
are in the free area but accessing chat. That's it.  You are chatting for
free.

     As far as I can tell this method is not only foolproof but also
GuideProof!:)  I logged on with a hacked account and found a guide and talked
to her for 30 minutes and she never said anything so maybe they can't tell at
all.  Well we'll see.  Just remember this if they DO find out about it, it
will be a HELL of a lot easier for them figure out who is doing this than it
was for them to figure out who the fives were.  

     NOTE: To send mail, look at mail, download mail, etc. just open up and
minmize your mailbox instead or along with "Best Of AOL"
     
     NOTE: You can minimize anything for this trick to work, not JUST "Best
Of AOL".
    

     4-
     To use credit cards to pay for online time you must first know a couple
of things...Visa numbers always start with a 4, master card a 5, etc.  This
is all you need to know!  I will give you 20 free Visa Card numbers.

        ***VISA***
1. 4327 979 908 053 | 6. 4327 513 175 359 |11. 4327 541 277 508 |16. 4327 699 885 466
2. 4327 475 650 241 | 7. 4327 693 042 353 |12. 4327 213 005 955 |17. 4327 575 373 843
3. 4327 708 537 397 | 8. 4327 437 415 246 |13. 4327 549 966 235 |18. 4327 673 545 433
4. 4327 381 115 982 | 9. 4327 435 026 342 |14. 4327 490 283 044 |19. 4327 235 019 000
5. 4327 435 821 072 |10. 4327 253 726 320|15. 4327 396 359 385|  20. 4327 758 958 295


      6-All this is, is using text manipulation to act as an authority and ask
for passwords. But here are some passwords\screen names that will work for you.

Screen name\password:                       
                                                            
1) KenMcP \ HACK                                    
2)Luann Jamo \ lobeck                             
3)Jbatl4 \ Jbalt4                                          
4)PETREE \ CONNOR
5)SusanM2273 \ 6180
6)NARANJITO \ NARANJITO
7)Packfan \ wolfpack
     

     7-    To do this trick the person MUST be on a PC!  IM someone or get them
to IM you, when they reply type something in the message box and copy it, now hold down
Control-L and keep on pressing send.  This overloads the memory or some shit
like that and they will be gone in a few minutes.
