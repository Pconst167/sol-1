This is a list of a bunch of funny/cruel prankts to
pull on people. If there is any good prank that I
don't have here email me [tyler@hackermail.com] and
I will add it to the next volume.
----------------------------------------------------
*Hotel Pranks*
 -Cut out out pornographic pictures from a porn mag
  and glue them in the bible at a hotel...you won't
  get to see the person's reaction when he/she goes
  to read some scripture and sees hardcore XXX, but
  it's still funny to think about.

 -Order wake up calls for random rooms at 3 a.m.
  
 -Make fake sex noises at all hours of the night

*Sleep Pranks*
  -While your target is asleep shave his eyebrows
  
  -Cover target's hand with mayonaise and tickle 
   their face, they will touch their face and cover 
   themselves in mayonaise

  -Pour water on their pants to make it appear to 
   other people that they wet the bed

  -Draw funny faces on target with permanent marker
   or lipstick
 
  -If target is passed out drunk leave a note by their
   bed saying "Thanks for the great night of sex"
   and make it signed by a name of the same sex.
  
*Computer Pranks*
  -Start talking to someone online, when they ask
   to trade pictures ask them to send you their 
   picture first, after you recieve it tell them
   your picture is online at http://goatse.cx
   when they go there they will be looking at
   and old man bending over showing his asshole
   ...nasty shit

   -Switch the recycle bin icon (so it looks like
    it's full when it's empty and vice versa) by 
    right clicking the desktop and going to 
    properties>effects

   -Subscribe someone you hate to a bunch of those
    annoying mailing lists

   -If target is using Aol Instant Messenger, make
    a screen name that looks like theirs (ex: replace
    L's(l's) with 1's because they look the same) 
    and start harassing people

*Car Pranks*
   -Place a piece of bologna on a target's car, let
    it sit over night. When they go to peel it off
    their paint will come with it

   -Syphon out target's gas while they're at work
 
   -Buy a "Club" (the thing that goes on their steering
    wheel so people can't steal the car) and put it on
    target's car

   -Paint target's windshield black

   -Put a golf ball in their tail pipe, when they start
    the car it will shoot out and hopefully hit the person
    accross the street's house

*Telephone Pranks*
   -Super Glue target's reciever down and make several calls
    to them

   -Make collect calls to random people from "It's me" or
    "Dad". They accept almost every time.

   -Call a target, and if their parents answer say 
    "hey [target mame] i got the drugs you wanted, are 
     you still gonna pawn your mom's jewlery?" or 
     something to that effect.

*Misc Pranks*
   -Wrap a bunch of flour in wet paper towels and throw
    them at random bypassers

   -Fill a squirt gun with something that smells bad
    (ex. vinegar) and spray it into the open window's
    of by passing cars
