4.How to break your school
by tHe mAnIaC
themaniac@blackcode.com
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This guide is for educational purposes only I do not 
take any responsibility about anything
happen after reading the guide. I'm only telling you 
how to do this not to do it. It's your decision.
If you want to put this text on your Site/FTP/Newgroup 
or anything else you can do it but don't
change anything without the permission of the author.

A word from the author:

I hope you like my texts and find them useful.
If you have any problem or some suggestion feel 
free to e-mail me but please don't send mails like
"I want to hack the US government please help me" or 
"Tell me how to blind a trojan into a .jpg"
Be sure if I can help you with something I will do it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

In this guide I'll explain you how to hack your school 
and the things you can do after you're in the
school's computer.This guide is for people who hate 
their school and want to learn how to hack it.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

So you want to hack your school :-) OK now you should do 
some social engineering.Learn every-
thing you can about the computers in your school.
About the teacher working with them,about
their OS (operation system)everything that can 
be usefull for you.Most of the cases the teacher 
that is working with the computers will put lame 
password that is easy to gues.Use every moment
when your teacher is writing some password and
try to remember it.It's good when you have some
friends with you so everyone will remember a little 
part of the password and then you'll combine
it to the full one.
Almost every teacher has a favourit student.
You should use him to give you some information
about the passwords and other things.
You teacher is maybe writing the passwords on paper so
you should find this paper in the room where the computers are.
Use the guy that the teacher likes
a lot he or she can give you very useful information.
Another way is to use another teacher.
Check if the teacher that is working with the computer is
not there.Find another teacher and tell him 
or her that you've lost sensitive information and will
get to write it again because you've lost it.
Make sure the teacher will believe you and let you do it.
Then tell the teacher that the information is on the school
computer and you should go and take it from there.
Then if the teacher let's you in that's good
now search for passwords and other things on the disk.
You can see if there's anything interesting
in the "my documents folder" you can find something 
useful there.You should search for the paper
I told you about with the passwords.If the teacher 
you came with is still there you can't search
because the teacher will see you,so one of your 
friends should call the teacher and talk with it
for 5 minutes for that time you should find the
paper or other information that can be useful for you.
You must know everything about the teacher 
that is working with the computers.What he/she likes
what the teacher hate,what he think about the 
passwords such things.Once again your friend that is
the teacher favourite student will help you 
for these things.Then you should create a wordlist
with words you think your teacher will put 
as passwords on the computer.It's better and more usefull
when you know many things about your 
teacher.Then you should just try the passwords.If you're
good social engineer you'll make very good word list and you'll have the password.
Also learn about what kind of passwords your teacher prefers.Something like:
letters with numbers or something else this is important and will help you a lot.
You teacher should know you as person 
that don't know anything about the computers so when you
hack their computers and do other things
 he/she won't think it was you because you don't know
anything about computers.
So now let's suppose you're in and you 
can do as you want.First of all you must check the disk for
some tests and students marks.If you 
find any tests copy them and you have the answers to them
hehe you'll be ready.If you find any 
students marks you can change them to what you want.But
don't write the best mark to the most 
stupid student because they'll check and see it's not true.

If your school has a Linux OS and you're 
root create several users with root rights so when you want
to get back just use them.Be sure to remove 
everythig connected with you from the log files.
But almost EVERY school is using Windows 
not Linux because the teachers are too lame to use it
they just want to use Windows and nothing else.

I hope now you're in the school computers or you know some of their passwords.
-------------------------------------------

6.Advertising
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Our magazine need more advertising.We want more people to read it.
And of course EVERYONE can help.Just tell your friends so they can
subscribe too or if you're webmaster somewhere put a link to our page
and tell the other people about BlackCode Ravers Magazine.
You can also add the page to some search engines and of course
try to find a mirror of the magazine.But please don't start spamming
and sending messages to every e-mail you find.Just tell about the 
magazine to your friends and to people you know.
This will make our magazine
popular but of course with your help.I hope you'll do some
advertising and tell the other about us and our magazine.
This will help us a lot because we'll probably find some
good writers for our magazine and you'll be able to see more texts.
-------------------------------------------

7.Trojans Section
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is our new section.Many people want such section and that's why 
the section is up now.Don't think in this section I'll put links
where you can download trojans because the trojans are everywhere.
Here you'll see information about the latest
trojans,how to remove them,latest news connected with trojans,
latest and the best anti-trojan software and many other things connected
with trojans.
I just want to show you how dangerous the trojans are and that you may
completely destroy yourself when you're using them.

In thie issue I'll tell you about the different kinds of the trojans
and I'll also review one trojan.

------------------|
by tHe mAnIaC |
-----------------|

Remote Access Trojans
-------------------------------

These trojans are the most popular trojans now.
Everyone wants to have such trojan because he
or she want to have access to their victim's hard drive.
The RAT'S (remote access trojans)are very
simple to use.Just make someone run the server 
and you get the victim's IP and you have FULL
access to his or her computer.They you can 
almost everything it depends of the trojan you use.
But the RAT'S have the common remote access trojan functions like:
keylogger,upload and download function,
make a screenshot and so on.Some people use the 
trojans for malicious purposes.
They want just to delete and delete.This is lame.But a have a guide
about the best way to use a trojan.You should read it.
There are many programs out there 
that detects the most common trojans,but new trojans are
coming every day and these programs are not the maximum deffence.
The trojans do always the same things.
If the trojan restart every time Windows is loaded that
means it put something in the registry 
or in win.ini or in other system file so the trojan can restart.
Also the trojans create some file in 
the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.The file is always looking
to be something that the victim will think 
is a normal WINDOWS executable.Most trojans hide
from the Alt+Ctrl+Del menu.This is not 
good because there are people who use only this way to see
which process are running.There are programs 
that will tell me you exactly the process and the
file from where it comes.Yeah but some trojans 
as I told you use fake names and it's a little hard
for some people to understand which process 
should they kill.The remote access trojans opens
a port on your computer letting everyone to connect.
Some trojans has options like change the port
and put a password so only the guy that infect you 
will be able to use the computer.The change
port option is very good because I'm sure you 
don't want your victim to see that port 31337 is open
on their computer.Remote access trojans are 
appearing every day and they will continue to appear.
For those that use such trojans: BE CAREFULL 
you can infect yourself and they the victim you
wantet destroyed will revange and you'll be sorry.
If you don't know anything about trojans
DON'T USE THEM.
---------------------------------------
Password Sending Trojans                                                                 

The purpose of these trojans is to rip all cached 
passwords and send them to specified e-mail
without letting the victim about the e-mail.
Most of these trojans don't restart every time Windows
is loaded and most of them use port 25 to 
send the e-mail.There are such trojans that e-mail 
other information too like ICQ number 
computer info and so on.These trojans are dangerous if
you have any passwords cached anywhere on your computer.
----------------------------------------
Keyloggers                                                                               

These trojans are very simple.The only one thing 
they do is to log the keys that the victim is pressing
and then check for passwords in the log file.
In the most cases these trojans restart every 
time Windows is loaded.They have options 
like online and offline recording.In the online recording
they know that the victim is online and
 they record everything.But in the offline recording 
everything writen after Windows start is 
recorded and saved on the victims disk waiting for 
to be transfered.
----------------------------------------
Desctructive

The only one fuction of these trojans is to 
destroy and delete files.This makes them very simple
and easy to use.They can automatically 
delete all your .dll or .ini or .exe files on your computer.
These are very dangerous trojans and once 
you're infected be sure if you don't desinfect your
computer information will no longer exist.
-----------------------------------------
FTP trojans      
                                                                   
These trojans open port 21 on your computer
 letting EVERYONE that has a FTP client to connect
to your computer without password and will full upload and download options.


These are the most common trojans.They all are dangerous 
and you should me carefull using them.
-----------------------------------------
So now I'll review one trojan called Vampire 1.2
I think most of you know it but if you don't you'll now
learn about it and how to remove it.

Vampire 1.2 is a remote access trojan that use port 1020 to connect.
It has a friendly and easy to use client.The trojan is dangerous one
because it has a lot of functions some of them cal COMPLETELY
destroy your computer data.

These are all the functions of the trojan.
The server's size is 53,248bytes .
You can remove the trojan when you:
delete c:\windows\system\Winboot.exe
and then in the registry
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
\CurrentVersion\Run] "WindowsBootFile"="c:\\windows\\system\\Winboot.exe" 

That's it when you delete these things you're clean from the trojan.
You see what dangerous options it has so check if you're infected 
with it manualy :-)

That was everything for the trojan section in this issue.
I'm waiting for your ideas and suggestions at: themaniac@blackcode.com

8.For the newbies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is also a new section in our magazine.It's for people that just came 
on the net and want to know some things and of course to learn how to
hack.So they started sending e-mails to everyone asking but in the most
of the cases they don't receive reply.That's for what is this section.
To answer to your questions and help you to learn something.
Don't worry you're newbie and you want to know,you're not lamer
that don't read because he/she "knows" everything :-)
The section will explain things only for newbies and will be only for them.
But who knows you may also learn something new from this section.
I hope this section will help to many people that don't know the basics
and will teach them something.If you have any question and you want to
see the answer here tell it to me at:themaniac@blackcode.com.I'm waiting
for your suggestions about this new section.

About IP and how to get it
------------------|
by tHe mAnIaC |
-----------------|

In this issue I'll explain you everything you want to know about the IP addresses
and how to get someones IP from IRC,ICQ,e-mail etc.
First I'll explain you what an IP is.
Every computer connected to the net has IP address.
This IP identifies the computer on the Internet.
The IP is where the data comes and goes out.
If you're using Dial Up every time when you connect
your IP is differend this is called dynamic IP.
Everyone  need the IP address of someone to do something 
to the victim like nuking,flooding
or if the victim is infected with trojan horse and you need the 
IP to connect to the computer.
The IP addresses can be get with these methods:

via e-mail-the IP is in the header.When you receive a message
right click,then Save Message and
then you'll see the IP there.
via IRC-if your victim is on IRC just type /dns <nick> and you'll see it
via ICQ-ICQ is not so secure thing and in the most of the 
cases you'll see the IP in the info if not
just find a ICQ patch that will show you the real IP of the 
victim.Most of these patches are
on every page connected with h/c/p/a.
Also there are ICQ tools that will help you to get the IP of ICQ user.

I hope you understood what an IP is and how to 
get it from the people.
But there are people that hide their IP so you just
can't get it from everyone.

Advices to the newbies and
for the people that want to know
------------------|
by tHe mAnIaC |
-----------------|

People STOP sending e-mails to everyone like
"Learn me to hack","How can I use a trojan","if you're hacker can you hack hotmail account"
and such things.This is lame and in the most of the cases you won't receive reply.
Or you'll receive something like "FUCK oFF laMer".Noone want to be called lamer.
Just learn what to ask and how to ask it.Ask BUT don't ask shit like these ones.
Read and of course practise.There are MANY texts on the net believe me just
read some and understand what is the hacking about and learn something
about the security on the net.
Many people ask where to read.Well you can read at
blackcode.com and also on many other sites.Just check progenic.com or cyberarmy.com
and check some sites in their top lists.There you'll find many texts that will help you.
Many people think hacking is to nuke machines,to flood someone,to steal passwords 
from people that don't know what a trojan is,to send viruses and such shit.This is not
hacking this is stupid thing and you should NEVER do it.
I hope now you'll start reading and learn the basic things and then start asking questions.
But I'm sure they won't be lame one :-)
And last thing: SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE with the other people.Teach and learn the other
people the things you know and don't be shame to say that you don't know something.
--------------------------------------------------------

9.Linux Section
=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This will be our Linux section full with texts about Linux security
and other things connected with Linux.
In this issue I'll publish one text about Why you should use Linux
instead of Windows bacause many people ask what's the big deal
with Linux.I'll show you now.
------------------------------------------------
Why people use Windows instead of Linux?
by tHe mAnIaC

In this text I'll explain you why almost EVERY man that is working with
computers use Windows instead of other OS like Linux.

Everyone know Windows.In most of the cases when you buy a computer you
have Windows on it.This show you once again how many people use it.
But why you may ask why are they using something that crashes every
5 minutes,that is so insecure on the net and that everyone can own your
computer via the net.Because the people don't know about these things.
They just think if they learn how to use Windows they'll have computer
knowledge.But they're normal users.They don't want to learn about
security,they don't want to learn how the things  work and what might 
happen to their machines when they're on the net.They just want to have
an e-mail box and surf the net,that's everything they want.And when
someone find that they're infected with trojan and inform them all the
normal users says something like "are you crazy this is impossible".
They don't know about anything they just think that when all the people
are using Windows they should use it too.
People take the easier part when they don't have to do anything instead 
of clicking on icons and working with Word.They don't care about security
about making they're system more secure.That's what Windows is.
But how about Linux.Linux is for people that want to learn that want to know
it's for the hackers.
You can COMPLETELY control your computer with Linux.You can see
who is on your system why tried to brute-force passwords on your
accounts and so on.You have full control and everything is FREE.
That's it that's what Linux is a system for the hacker for the person that want
to learn and want to know,that want to make his/her own programs under Linux.
Windows uses all of your system resources 
for something and that's why it crashes.
Linux completely uses the resources of your system and make it stable.

Every hacker that respect himself should use Linux instead of Windows.
Windows is FULL with security problems and you can be easily crashed and
hacked over the net.Of course Linux has also security problems but you can
remove them just get the latest patches for the bugs.Also if you know how to
configure your Linux right you'll be secure for the lame people that has one
exploit and think they're elite and they can hack everyone.
When you're using you'll learn much more about your hardware which is very good
thing.You won't be stupid Windows user anymore.You'll be Linux user.

NOTE:
Windows is good for offices and for graphic designers also for people that
don't want to learn anything,that just want to surf BUT if you want to know
and you respect yourself you should get Linux and learn how it works.

That's for now in our Linux Section.The next time you'll see here some
security papers also with source code of some attacks.
If you're Linux expert and want to handle the section
please e-mail me and tell me.
