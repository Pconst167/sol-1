In this text I'll explain you about the "BIG" thing called voting for one page because a lot of people
think this is not right and that they'll loose if they vote for some page.I hope you'll understand for
what is the voting about and why you should vote.I'll also tell you about LAME pages that fake
their votes and their ways of making the people vote for the site.

*This guide is for educational purposes only I do not take any responsibility about anything
happen after reading the guide. I'm only telling you how to do this not to do it. It's your decision


There has been many list established on the net for the best H/C/P/A pages on the net something
like rank lists where people can vote if they like the page.Probably the most famous one are located
at:
www.cyberamy.com
www.progenic.com
www.blackcode.com
These are the places  where most of the people go to check for cool sites about H/C/P/A information.
   
When you go to some H/C/P/A site on the net  they'll probably 
ask you to vote for them.You may ask why?
Well let's use one example.So some people create one web page and they ask you to vote in this way
they can see if the visitors like the page or not,because they won't continue with the page if there's
noone that is voting for them.When the web masters see that a lot of people are voting for them
they'll make updates of the page and put many and interesting things on it because there will be
someone to see them because there's also someone that is voting for them that is expecting 
updates and new things on the page.That's why the webmasters will make the updates because
they won't want to disappoint the visitors that are voting for them.
I hope now you understand why you should vote and what you'll win when you vote for the page.
But of course you should not vote for page that you don't like.

When someone enters in these lists of cool pages he/she will first see what's on the top and the 
first 10 pages because they're on the top that means that a lot of people are voting for them.
The visitor will go to see the page.But NOT ONLY the pages that are on the top are good believe me
when you check the small ones that even don't have ONE vote for them I'm sure you'll find something
that the big one and these that are on the top don't have.If you find some group you may find
their own programs and texts there and a lot of other things you thought are only in the big and the
best pages.But this is the net you CAN'T know every page because every day there're so MANY
new one made and also new group is being discovered new text has been written and so on.So
check every page not only these that are on the top and I'm sure you'll find something useful there.
BUT a lot of cool pages are not in these lists because everyone knows about them and they don't
want to be on these lists.They're famous and don't want to be there.That's why you shouldn't only
think that the pages you see on these lists are the ONLY one on the net with H/C/P/A information.

BUT there are so LAME pages on the net that make their visitors vote for them or click on adds and
give the lame page money.They just put link saying something like "FREE XXX" or "FRESH TEENS"
and just point them to some list you vote for them or make money for them.This is lame and I think
such pages shouldn't exist on the net,but they exist.There lists with H/C/P/A sites make anti-cheat
gateway that can stop such pages because there you should click once again on one JAVA button
to vote for the page and there's also a message saying that if you were tricked you can enter the list
WITHOUT voting for the site that trick you.This is cool and very useful if some page make you vote
for them.
Also they record your IP so can't vote more than once :-)
Yeah but there are many list that don't have anti-cheat gateway this is bad because everyone can
vote more that one time and the pages can trick the visitors.

So I hope you all understand why you should vote and what will you win if you vote.
