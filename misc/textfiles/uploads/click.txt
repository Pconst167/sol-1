First!  Pick guns are hard!  That's right!  Don't even think about
trying to do this unless you are ready to PRACTICE!  You don't just
poke them in the keyhole and have an open lock!


How they work:

You know this toy?
               ______          ______                           
               /|||||          |||||\      
              / ||||| 	       ||||| \
	     /  |||||	       |||||  \
	    /   |||||	       |||||   \
	   O    |||||	       |||||   	O
	        OOOOO	       OOOOO


Pick guns work the same way:
		   
                  \   
		  /   <-- Spring, pushes pins down.
		  \				   
       	       	 |-|				   
	 ------- | | -------   <-- Sheer line, where the       	    
		 |_|		   plug meets the cylinder.
		 |-|				           
	         | |                                       
	         |_|                               
	              
	          ^   <-- Keyway
	          |     	
	      	  |
	    Pick gun delivers
	    sharp blow to bottom
	    pin.                


With luck, right after the gun delivers its blow:

                  \   
		  /
		  \				   
       	       	 |-|				   
	         | |  <-- Top pin thrown up by blow.
		 |_| 

          --------------------   <-- Sheer line, where the   
		                     plug meets the cylinder.
		 |-|    			           
	         | |  <-- Bottom pin stays in place.
	         |_|      
	              


NOTE: Pick guns ONLY work on PIN TUMBLER LOCKS!  DO NOT USE THEM ON
WAFER OR DISK TUMBLER LOCKS!  YOU WILL DAMAGE THE LOCK!


Three "pick gun" type implements described in _PICK GUNS Lock Picking
for Spies, Cops and Locksmiths_ by John Minnery:

The simple clicker, made from a metal clothes hanger:

		       Thumb presses here,
		       then releases with a snap.

       	       	       	     v 
      	  _______________________
       	 / _____                |   |
        / /    	\		|   |
        | |     |		|   |              <--- Pins go here, where
        \ \-----/---------------|---------------        they will receive
         \_____/ 	        \   /     ^  	        the force of the
                                 \_/      |             "click".
	    ^                             |
	    |                     ^  Flatten needle with hammer,
            |                     |  shorten height with file.
     Wrap around something        |  This part goes into 
     like a broom handle.         |  the lock under the pins. 
       	   			  |
                            This part imparts  
                            force to the needle
                            which imparts force
                            to the pins.       

With one hand, a tension wrench is used to apply rotational tension
(see _The MIT Guide To Lock Picking_,
http://www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/).  The other hand, manipulating
the clicker, places the needle against the pins.  The thumb pushes
down where indicated, and releases with a snap.  The force is imparted
to the needle, which is imparted to the pins.  With luck, a wide gap
opens at the sheer line, and the lock opens.  Frequently multiple
clicks are needed.

Experiment with different tensions on the tension wrench and different
ammounts of force with the clicker, which can be adjusted by changing
how far down the thumb pushes before releasing.

Be careful to put the needle in the lock as straight as possible.
Friction against the sides or back of the lock will prevent the full
force of the click from going into the pins.  Holding the needle level
against the pins helps to make sure the force is applied evenly to all
of the pins.

	  Finger pulls up here, and then releases.  Force
          is transfered to needle, and then pins.
