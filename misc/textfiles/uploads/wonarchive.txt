Intro
------

   Before I begin, I need to explain a few things.  Back around the 
time I first got the internet (mid-98), I found The Unofficial World of 
Nintendo Chat Room (WoN).  The first incarnations of WoN were Beseen chats
(Commonly referred to as the Old WoN chats).  I went to these chats 
infrequently, and I wasn't a big part of them.  Sometime in late '98 
Jesse Smith (the owner of the chats) instituted a new chat script, 
which became known as New WoN.  Over the years New WoN has changed a bit,
but it has still remained fundamentally the same.  Since 1998 New WoN has
become an integral part of my internet experience.

   In 1999 Jesse Smith abandoned Old WoN in favor of his new chats.  
However, Old WoN was not forgotten by its population.  Gau, an Old WoNer,
created a site devoted to Old WoN.  The site had the old chats, profiles
of Old WoNers, memoirs, and most importantly, chat logs.  

   So years later my pal Cecil and I make New Times, a site devoted 
to the New WoN chats.  Logs were a big part of the site, and I made most
of them myself.  The logs were just copies of the HTML source of the chat
window.  Over time, New Times became home to dozens of these logs.

   As I said in the previous paragraph, I made most of the chat logs
myself.  However, some of the chat logs were submitted by various
New WoNers.  I also have to thank archive.org for a lot of logs that
I didn't have.  The logs that I made were usually of something "humorous,"
as were the logs submitted by other people.  The logs I obtained from
archive.org are random.

   The reason I'm putting all of the WoN logs into a text file is
one of preservation.  Web sites come and go, but text files are immortal.


Logs
-----

   The logs will be separated into groups by the year that they were 
made.  The exact date the logs were made will precede each individual
log.  Now without further ado, here are the logs.

                                
                                 1999
