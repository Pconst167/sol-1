These trojans are the most popular trojans now.Everyone wants to have such trojan because he
or she want to have access to their victim's hard drive.The RAT'S (remote access trojans)are very
simple to use.Just make someone run the server and you get the victim's IP and you have FULL
access to his or her computer.They you can almost everything it depends of the trojan you use.
But the RAT'S have the common remote access trojan functions like:
keylogger,upload and download function,make a screenshot and so on.Some people use the 
trojans for malicious purposes.They want just to delete and delete.This is lame.But a have a guide
about the best way to use a trojan.You should read it.
There are many programs out there that detects the most common trojans,but new trojans are
coming every day and these programs are not the maximum deffence.
The trojans do always the same things.If the trojan restart every time Windows is loaded that
means it put something in the registry or in win.ini or in other system file so the trojan can restart.
Also the trojans create some file in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.The file is always looking
to be something that the victim will think is a normal WINDOWS executable.Most trojans hide
from the Alt+Ctrl+Del menu.This is not good because there are people who use only this way to see
which process are running.There are programs that will tell me you exactly the process and the
file from where it comes.Yeah but some trojans as I told you use fake names and it's a little hard
for some people to understand which process should they kill.The remote access trojans opens
a port on your computer letting everyone to connect.Some trojans has options like change the port
and put a password so only the guy that infect you will be able to use the computer.The change
port option is very good because I'm sure you don't want your victim to see that port 31337 is open
on their computer.Remote access trojans are appearing every day and they will continue to appear.
For those that use such trojans: BE CAREFULL you can infect yourself and they the victim you
wantet destroyed will revange and you'll be sorry.If you don't know anything about trojans
DON'T USE THEM.

The purpose of these trojans is to rip all cached passwords and send them to specified e-mail
without letting the victim about the e-mail.Most of these trojans don't restart every time Windows
is loaded and most of them use port 25 to send the e-mail.There are such trojans that e-mail 
other information too like ICQ number computer info and so on.These trojans are dangerous if
you have any passwords cached anywhere on your computer.

These trojans are very simple.The only one thing they do is to log the keys that the victim is pressing
and then check for passwords in the log file.In the most cases these trojans restart every 
time Windows is loaded.They have options like online and offline recording.In the online recording
they know that the victim is online and they record everything.But in the offline recording 
everything writen after Windows start is recorded and saved on the victims disk waiting for 
to be transfered.

The only one fuction of these trojans is to destroy and delete files.This makes them very simple
and easy to use.They can automatically delete all your .dll or .ini or .exe files on your computer.
These are very dangerous trojans and once you're infected be sure if you don't desinfect your
computer information will no longer exist.
