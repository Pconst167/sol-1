Have you ever wanted to go racing on the highway at 3:00 am just for fun? We all have! And if you look below, you'll find out how you can.

EQUIPMENT:
Two 1992 Chevrolet Luminas of different colors (So you can identify each one. You may even want to paint a number on the roof.) but of equal horsepower and with no dents (Dents  mess up the aerodynamics. You might think that it doesn't matter, but at 100 mph it does).
Three camcorders with tape mounted on passenger seat headrest in each Lumina and one to record  the finish.
10 mile stretch of deserted highway.
A green flag and and a checkered flag.
Support crew (A few guys in a car that's parked on the shoulder of the road that will rescue a  driver if a wreck happens).
5 CB radios, all set to the same channel, one in each car, one with the spport crew, one with  the starter, and one with the guy who waves the flag at then end.
2 football helmets with the front cage removed for visibility(For the drivers).
Someone to wave the green flag (Starter) and someone to wave the checkered flag.

GETTING IT ALL TOGETHER:

Get the support crew on a shoulder of the highway about halfway through the course. Tell them to keep the engine running at all times, just to be prepared. Get the Luminas going off of an onramp and keep them at 55 mph coming to the green flag. When the starter waves the green flag, he says "Green! Green! Green!" over the CB. The racing has begun! During the race, the on-board cameras are always left on. The drivers MUST wear the helmets and the windows must always remain closed. Other than that, anything is allowed. Sideswipe? Go for it! Shove 'em into the barricade? Right on! Spin 'em out? Cool! If either driver has a problem, he radios the support crew and they come to him to get him on his way. When the cars get to be one mile to go, the photo finish camera is turned on and records the finish. The finisher waves the checkered flag and the first one to get under the overpass wins. The cars slow down and pull into and exit, where the support crew, starter and finisher meet them. They review the photo finish camera tape and figure out who won, and the race is over. If you want to see a variation of what I'm talking about, watch the movie "Days of Thunder."
