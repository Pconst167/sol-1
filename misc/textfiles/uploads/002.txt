     "How to make smoke bombs if you do not own a mobile laboratory."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hello and welcome to my second text-file. Did you like the last one? I
don't care. Anyway, I read up on how to make smoke bombs and the
ingredients were right. 4 parts sugar, 7 parts potassium nitrate. One of
the files said that to the potassium nitrate at a pharmacy, YOU DON'T! You
get potassium nitrate at a chemist. Potassium nitrate isn't used anymore so
if they ask why you want it, you're either a pyrotechnican (one of those
guys who makes explosions and the like on movie sets) or a professor at Tit
Monger University.
     Second of all, you don't have to melt the potassium nitrate under a
spirit burner until it turns yellow. You can just put the potassium nitrate
and sugar into a tissue and shake it. It isn't a compound like the other
type, but it's just as good, if not better.
     And last on my list of hate, why did it say in every file to use a
spatula? Most people don't have a mobile laboratory, use a fucking
teaspoon.

If you haven't read any other file on how to make smoke bombs, I will tell
you how, you need:
A TEASPOON,
Potassium nitrate (found at a CHEMIST)
Sugar.
A TISSUE.
And some tape.

(It's a lot easier this way, no test tubes or any of that
pukefucking cunt.)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Method:
1. Lay your tissue on the table.
2. Put 4 teaspoons of sugar on the tissue.
3. Put 7 teaspoons of potassium nitrate on the tissue.
4. Fold the tissue so that none of your mixture will leak out and selotape
   it closed.
5. Shake it.
6. Light the bastard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See how the flames burst out of the smoke bomb? It's easier to make than
the type that's solid and it's better. (It's better because of it's
romantic bursting flames of passion.)
