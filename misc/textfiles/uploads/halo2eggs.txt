Status: Confirmed
Envy Mode: On the level "Delta Halo" on Legendary Difficulty, Progress until 
you reach the area during the "Push through the covenant held ruins" where 
you have to clear a Landing Zone for the Pelican to drop weapons. I beleive 
you will know you are in the right area when cortana says "there pouring out 
of the center building". Anyway that area has Plasma turrets along its 
borders. A little bit after the left side turret you will see the outline of 
a door in a wall, but the door has a solid rock slab in it and a rock in 
front of it. Jump on the rock then jump to the ledge above the door then 
jump on the ledge to the left. Now jump onto the building with the sealed 
door using grenades. Atop the building you will find two dancing elites and 
the "Envy Skull". Pick up the envy skull and you will be able to use Active 
Camoflage like the Arbiter.

cylindrical thrusters. Fly down to the middle one and circle the upper 
portion of the cylinder till you see some grunts dancing in a circle. The 
grunts are in an area where the cylinder connects to the horizontal support 
beam so they are somewhat hidden under the support. Once found land near the 
grunts and pick up the GBP Skull. From now on whenever you shoot anyone in 
the head (Dead or Alive) with a projectile weapon (hand gun, BR, SR) they 
will explode like a Plasma grenade, damaging all around them.

second floor that has a plasma turret. The skull is on the highest ledge 
behind you, above the doorway where you enter this room. Take out all the 
baddies and proceed to the window with the turret. jump to the left onto the 
ledge from the window. you will notice several diagonal supports that lead 
up to two thin rails that run the length of the room. Make a well timed 
jump/duck from one of the diagonal beams to the rails. Follow the rails all 
the way to the other end of the room and you will see a ledge on the left 
with a trashcan. In between the trashcan and the wall is another cigar! 
Knock over the trashcan to reveal the "Thunderstorm" skull.

Black Eye Skull
Difficulty: Legendary
Level: Great Journey
Word: Black Eye
Effect: As we saw in the video , it appears to keep your shields from 
recharging. Ouch.
Status: Confirmed
How to get it? We dont know! (we saw it in some video)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unnamed Skull
Difficulty: Legendary
Level: Armory
Word: The skull does not display any text when picked up
Effect: Need more details. Uncertain at this point.
Status: Confirmed
Method: (provided by flechette) This skull is just as easy to get as Sputnik 
or Blind, but it takes a good 6 minutes to get simply because you have to 
wait so long to get it. Start the level on Legendary, and do what the 
armorer tells you to do (looking, charging shields). When the Sarge comes up 
in the elevator, you have to wait for him to say 'Would it help if I said 
please?' Waiting for him to say this takes about 5 minutes. Once he says it, 
get in the elevator and follow him into the monorail. Face the inside of the 
building, and hold X while you pass by the skull and you'll pick it up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ghost Skull
Difficulty: Legendary
Level: Uprising
Word: Ghost
Effect: Need more details. Uncertain at this point.
Status: Confirmed
Method: (Ok, this is NOT for anyone who hates legendary. This level can be a 
HUGE pain to get through. The skull is near the very end of the level. When 
you get to the cache of weapons that are stockpiled in one room right before 
the last cave, you have to grenade jump up onto the rafters in the last 
corridor. It can probably be done without a ghost, but it's much easier to 
just jack a ghost and use that to blast off of instead of doing it from the 
floor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Mythic skull
Difficulty: Legendary
Level: Sacred Icon
Word: Mythic
Effect: Need more info to be sure.
Status: Confirmed
There is a semi outdoor area which has the same type of area right next to 
it. There is a large sentinal in front of each one. Go past this area and 
down the piston and you'll be in a vary dark and dank flood infested area. 
There's a stack of 6 or 7 boxs as you enter the room, use them to jump up to 
the right ledge and it's floating above a dead Human flood in a vent.
