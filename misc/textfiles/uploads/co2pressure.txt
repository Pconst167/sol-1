CO2 PRessure Bomb
By: The master

Caution: This bomb is potentially dangerous!

Ingredients:
Unused One time use CO2 Canister(like the ones used in paintball guns)

Lighter fluid, or any high temperature burning fluid

A glass or metal canister or cup

	
	Put the lighter fluid in your canister, and drop the CO2 canister in.  The CO2 should be submerged in the fuild...if it's not it might not get hot enough to blow.  Create a wick to light the fluid.  Light the wick and get really far away.  Usually it takes at least 15 seconds of the lighter fluid heating the CO2 before it blows up, but I wouldn't count on that if i was you.
	The CO2 Canisters hold hundreds, possibly even thousands(the more the merrier) of pounds of pressure in a very small space.  When the metal from the canister starts to get soft from the heat it will explode...sending the metal from the canister flying and create shrapnel from anything else you put around the canister.  It also tends to send the lighter fluid around which will stay in the same spot on fir for a short period of time.  You can also use larger CO2 canisters, but they have to be older ones that do not have an emergency valve that lets the pressure loosen with high temperatures(you could also weld this valve shut and then fill the canister).  A larger CO2 will obvioulsy make a much larger explosion...and will need a lot more to heat it properly.
