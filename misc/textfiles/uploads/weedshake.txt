================

Frost a glass inside a freezer well in advance (if this isn't possible
the technique will still work, it just won't be as efficient). Fill a bowl
halfway with ice and cold water.  Place the glass in the middle of the
bowl.  If the glass wasn't in a freezer first you'll have to have wait
fifteen to twenty minutes for the air inside of the glass to cool down.
Roll a joint and stick it in the end of a straw.  Light the joint and
place the lit end in your mouth while blowing smoke out of the mouthpiece
(also known as shotgunning) into the bottom of the glass.  Since the air
inside the glass is so cold the smoke will stay inside the glass.  Once it
is full, pick up the glass as if you're going to drink it and inhale the
smoke.  Try to do this as fast as possible so the hit doesn't go stale
(stale hits are called chocolate milkshakes). There will be little or no
smoke exhaled because the smoke is so cold that it sticks to your lungs;
this leeches all of the available THC molecules from the smoke.  Using
this method, generous amounts of smoke can be consumed without bite.
