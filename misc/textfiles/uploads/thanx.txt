Just a little thanx, props, and info
====================================

Personal Thanx
--------------          

     First off I want to start off this file by saying thank you. Thank you to all the people who have, and still do support me in all aspects of my life. First I want to thank my mother. A women with so much fucking patience she drives my nuts some times, but I love her dearly. Next is my girlfriend and my soulmate Rachael. Never have I been this happy in my entire life. You have inspired me so much ;) Next are my freinds Allan, Josh, Dave, Matt, and Casey. Without you people I wouldn't know what to do with myself. And special thanx to Allan. You have always been there for me and always will be, and who else would I get drunk with and gain the knowladge and experiance to write these files.

Internet Props
--------------

     Now in this section I would like to thank Jason Scott, the owner and keeper of textfiles.com. It is people like you, Jason, that truly see what the internet was, can be, and what it stands for..... Freedom. Every textfile on the site, even if perverted, false, inaccurate, historical, true, or amazing has it's own meaning. It's own history, it's own author, and it's own reason for being written. That in itself amazes me to no end. Keep up the good work and hopefully in years to come someone else will keep the torch burning....

Info (and a couple more thanx)
------------------------------

     Ok, now some info. Well actually, wait a minute i'm missing something! I would like to thank all the people that have sent me email, instant messaged me, ICQ'ed me and just plain told me that they like and have read my texts. That is why I keep typing. It's knowing that I am actually reaching someone with these files. Weather they inspire anarchy, phreaking, wonder, or thought I am reaching you the reader. I strongly encourage feedback on ANY or ALL of my textfiles. If you hate them tell me. If you LOVE them tell me. Even if you just want to have a chat and ask me questions or advice, tell me.

     Well now after pouring my heart out let me get down to the latest news for those of you who care. As of now I am writting articles for Blackcode.com's newsletter. Just goto the site and goto the newsletter section to sign up to recieve it via email. Hell, I might even start my own listbot or somthing due to recent response of my articles. Well anyway the contact info is at the bottom of the file, so drop me a line (I am also open to offers to write for any e-zines, though it seems anarchy e-zines are few). Well thats it for this file, Laterz and HAPPY ANRCHY :-)
