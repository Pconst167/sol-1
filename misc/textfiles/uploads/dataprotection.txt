hell-o everyone, this is my first textfile about security!
i've discovered a little trick in windows!
while browsing through my registry, i came across a lot of
numbers, with values like 'wave', 'explorer' etc.
these are a sort of file 'masks' that indicate which
program or .dll (dynamic load libarary) windows must
load in order to access the file
so...i thougt if i would add one of those numbers to a folder
name, it would make a shortcut to a system file and block access
to the files contained within the folder, so i tried it, 
and it worked!!! here's how to do it:

NOTE!: once you've protected a folder, also you can't acces it
normally! the only way to get acces to the files is to move it
to the garbage bin and cut and paste it into an unprotected folder!
(control-x control-v)
(you can also put in a .zip file)

data protection: how to hide those nasty xxx pic's!!! ;-)

 - right-click with your mouse and select 'new'
 
 - then you will see a list of files you can create, pick 'folder'
 
 - for now, name it 'new folder'

 - copy the data you want to hide into that folder 
 
 - then right-click on the folder and select 'rename'

 - give it one of the following names: (these are examples) 
  
 - 'funny sound.{0003000D-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}'
 - 'control panel.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}' 
 - 'aX0023sys.{ECD4FC4F-521C-11D0-B792-00A0C90312E1}' 
 - 'internet explorer.{FBF23B42-E3F0-101B-8488-00AA003E56F8}'
 - 'keys.{BD84B380-8CA2-1069-AB1D-08000948F534}'
 - 'Dial-Up networking.{992CFFA0-F557-101A-88EC-00DD010CCC48}'

 - al folder names are without the ' '  

 - you can give the folder any name as long as you remember to put a . (point)
   between the folder name and the number!

          DATA PROTECTION MADE EASY !!!!!!!!!!!!!
