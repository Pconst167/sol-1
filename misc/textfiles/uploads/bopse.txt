	I am sure that everyone reading this article at least knows a 
little about the art of phreaking, at least the fact that it exists and 
it is all about getting free calls out of phones.  Some might know 
about the fact that phreaks reverse the usage of "ph" and f.  Example: 
fag becomes phag and phone would be fone, but not many reach back to 
the beginning, the dawn of phreakdom.  We will now go back to the birth of 
phreaking.

	In the beginning, there was darkness brought about by AT&T, or as many call 
it, Ma Bell.  They used their monopoly to raise phone prices.  Some of the workers 
at Ma Bell quit and took a book called the "Blue Book", a book that told about the 
Bell Electronic Switching System, or ESS, the computerized system Ma Bell set up to
 tell the calls where to go and how to bill them.

	Then, in 1971, in Berkely, CA, a man who will forever be remembered as 
Cap'n Crunch got his name by figuring out that a blue whistle you used to get in 
boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal emitted the same tone that the Ma Bell workers used to 
take control of an ESS, in essence getting a free call.  He was almost instantly 
made a hero for finding a way to beat the system.  Two other people that went to 
Berkely, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, found out about Cap'n Crunch and worked on 
his discovery.  They discovered that the whistle emitted a 2600hz tone.  Steve 
Wozniak invented a device called the Blue Box that used the tone.  Steve Jobs, 
Steve Wozniak, and Cap'n Crunch tested the device by calling the Pope.  They were 
surprised when their device actually connected them.  This moment must always be 
remembered.

	The three of them eventually went their separate ways.  The two Steves went
 on to create Apple Computers and Cap'n Crunch, like so many great phreaks, 
disappeared into history.  The Blue was used up until the mid-80's, when Ma Bell 
changed the ESS so that the device can't be used except in the most rural of areas.

	We are now facing a dilemma.  This dilemma is largely because Ma Bell has 
fixed a lot of their holes, but moreover because of the lack of real phreaks.  All 
the great minds were snuffed out when the FBI shut down the Renegade Legion and 
sent all the members to  prison.  But the worst part is that there aren't any good 
articles for would-be phreaks.  All the would-be phreaks have to learn from is 
outdated articles that were written on Atari's, Apple //e's, and IBM AT's.  No one 
can find out how pissed I get when I go to the alt.2600.phreakz newsgroup and see 
all the requests there are for Blue Boxes.  I ask anyone who wants to be a phreak 
to join the Legion of the Damned.  To join, send an email to Durandal@softhome.net 
and put APPLICATION as the subject.  Includeyour handle, preferred email, and why 
you should join, and remember...you can READ all you want, but if you don't get 
your ASS out there and try stuff out for yourself, you are nothing but a POSER!

Share the wealth...Information is power...SHARE IT!
