Chemicals needed:
Limewater
Kerosene
Sulphuric acid
Potassium permanganate
Water
Ammonium hydroxide
Acetone
Hydrochloric acid
Coca leaves

Equipment needed:
Heating lamps
Fans
Basins
Muslin cloths

Procedure:
Cocaine base extraction:
The coca leaves are placed into a basin, and are soaked in limewater. Kerosene is added, and it is allowed to sit in this basin for 1-4 days, being agitated each day.

Sulphuric acid is added to the mixture, and a precipitate will form, this is called ‘coca paste’. The mixture is filtered, and the liquid is discarded, the paste is allowed to dry.

The coca paste is placed into another basin and dilute sulphuric acid is added. Next a potassium permanganate solution is added. This is allowed to stand for 6 or more hours.

The solution is filtered and the precipitate is discarded. Ammonium hydroxide is added; this will cause another precipitate to form. The solution is filtered and the liquid is discarded, the precipitate is dried under heat lamps. The resulting powder is called ‘cocaine base’

Cocaine base conversion
The cocaine base is dissolved in acetone. Hydrochloric acid is dissolved into more acetone, and the two liquids are poured to together, this is allowed to sit for 3-6 hours.

A precipitate will form below the acetone and the entire mix is then poured through cloth to trap the cocaine hydrochloride crystals. The cloth is then wrung dry to remove the last of the acetone. The final drying of the cocaine takes place under heating lamps.

Pure cocaine is then compressed into 2.2lbs bricks for shipment to the United States and elsewhere.
