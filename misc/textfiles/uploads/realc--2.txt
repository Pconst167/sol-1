  Introduction
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 There's a small (well, the latest versions ain't so small any more) program
 language called C-- or SPHINX C--. It was designed by Peter "SPHINX" Cellik
 and distributed as greenware. It supported COM and OBJ formats. Peter stopped
 the development in 1996 but as he released the source then there're two follow
 up distributions: The SPHiNX C-- Development Team's SPHiNX C-- (up to version
 1.06) and Mishel Sheker's SPHINX C-- (currently at 0.237 beta 5). Sheker's
 version is still in development and supports among other things
 EXE/LE/PE/SYS/DLL formats and FPU. But let's get to the point now, shall we?
 By most programming languages there are some coders who think that this
 language is the best there is. I don't know how many "followers" C-- has but
 I know one who considers C-- to be a religion. What you're going to read in
 this file is actually all about him.

  Real C-- coders
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 Real C-- coders know that 'C--' ain't a typing error

 Real C-- coders worship Peter Cellik and Mishel Sheker

 Real C-- coders think that "The SPHiNX C-- Development Team" is a bunch
  of lamers and their distribution ain't worth downloading

 Real C-- coders know that C-- rocks!!!

 Real C-- coders know that C-- not only rocks but is also the coolest
  invention since assembly

 Real C-- coders know that the best programmer's editor ever built is
  Norton Commander Editor (which pops up by F4 in Norton Commander)

 Real C-- coders who's sources are bigger than 65000 bytes use QEdit or
  some other advanced editor where you can set the functions to keys exactly
  as they are by NCEdit

 Real C-- coders are DOS freaks, often even Real DOS Users

 Real C-- coders have always, ALWAYS, the latest version of C--
 
 Real C-- coders have contributed code to M. Sheker

 Real C-- coders have found some bug in C--

 Real C-- coders re-write many of the build-in procedures to optimize them
  by 1 or 2 bytes

 Real C-- coders often need procedures which are not present thus they have
  to write the code themselves

 Real C-- coders consider REG procedures to be the only procedures worth using

 Real C-- coders think that assembly is a possible alternative to C--

 Real C-- coders think that C can in some circumstances be a possible
  alternative to C--

 Real C-- coders think that C++ can in some never-happening cases be a
  possible alternative to C--

 Real C-- coders know that not Pascal, ADA, Fortran, BASIC nor any other
  language can in any circumstances be a possible alternative to C--

 Real C-- coders would write WinWord macros in C-- if they would know how

 Real C-- coders like all those TurboVision 'C-- Workbenches' but don't use
  any

 Real C-- coders like TINY model

 Real C-- coders are in love with COM format

 Real C-- coders have written a device driver

 Real C-- coders know how to write TSRs

 Real C-- coders know that TSRs are better that device drivers and thus they
  don't write device drivers anymore

 Real C-- coders have converted C--'s documentation into some hypertext format

 Real C-- coders have converted some assembly or C source to C--

 Real C-- coders like to optimize

 Real C-- coder know how how to use a dis-assembler

 Real C-- coders constantly check M. Sheker's homepage for updates

 Real C-- coders have a 'SPHINX C--' GIF in their homepages

 Real C-- coders never miss a chance to declare that they use SPHINX C--

 Real C-- coders find that greenware is the coolest distribution policy
  after greetware

 Real C-- coders have the line '?use80286' in all their sources

 Real C-- coders usually disable the 'resize' option

 Real C-- users have their C-- directory in the root of drive and not in some
  x stuff/blablabla/misc/languages directory

 Real C-- coders like to comment and at least 28,4% of their sources size is
  dedicated to comments

 Real C-- coders consider everything that's not possible to code in C-- not
  worth coding

 Real C-- coders like words that begin with 'cod' (like 'coders' and 'coding')

 Real C-- coders find it sad that the newest versions of the compiler need at
   least a 386

 Real C-- coders have thought about releasing their own distribution of C--

 Real C-- coders would read alt.sex.c-- if there would be such a news group

  Conclusion

 As real C-- coders would say: "Real C-- coders rock!!!"
