Section 1 - Introduction
------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Basics
Too many people simple passwords, things such as names of people they know, dictionary 
words, and simple variations on standard words. In this document I will present the 
things I do to create strong passwords, store them safely, and give several other options 
to my method. In the end though, the choice is up to you on your password habits. Be
smart, use better passwords and change them often.


Section 2 - Tools you need
------------------------------------------------------

2.1 The tools

The following is a list of tools I recommend you have and use. If you find any others, 
that you would like to suggest, email me at freeloader187a@yahoo.com and I will add them
to the list as soon as possible.

Quicky Password Generator - http://www.quickysoftware.com/
This is a great tool for creating unique passwords. It allows you to create passwords 
from 4 to 20 characters in length, store the passwords in a file it outputs or your own,
and best of all it's free. This is the one I use and recommend. Do a search on 
download.com to find others. They're all pretty much the same in my opinion.

PGP - http://www.pgp.com/
I use this to secure my password file after I create it. Feel free to use your favorite 
encryption tool though.

A cd writer, zip drive, or some kind of stable media that is transportable. I use small
3in. rewritable cd-roms. I like these because they are small, lightweight and usable in
just about any computer you find these days. It will also work in older cd-rom drives. I
use these also because not every computer has a zip drive or USB ports.


Section 3 - What to do
------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Getting ready

First thing to do is make sure you have the tools you need. If you don't have them, get 
them first and then proceed.

3.2 Create your passwords

Open your password tool and create a file of passwords. I like mine to be at least 10 
characters long and alphanumeric. Save this file somewhere easy to get at and name it 
passlist or some crap like that. This is file is important only so that you don't have to 
creat passwords all the time.

3.3 Create YOUR password list

Create a new text document. This will be your password list with your usernames and 
passwords. This is the file you have to keep safe once it is created. I always name mine 
something like blank.txt or new.txt . . . this is so that it's not related with passwords
except in my own mind.

In this file I use the following format which is easy to use helps me when I use other 
computers.

/* begin account listing

// yahoo mail account 1
http://mail.yahoo.com
butthole@yahoo.com
0h05cl322s

// butthole forums
http://www.butt.com/hole/index.php
dorkboy
yBf9k3nS5a

// next account

I do this for all my accounts and update the file as needed. Personally, I like to change 
my passwords every month or so. It can be a pain at times, but it's worth it if you are 
paranoid about people getting at your stuff.

3.4 Secure your password list

Open your encryption program and encrypt that bad boy. I like to create self extracting 
files that are portable. After you have done this, copy this file to your portable media 
of choice. I dislike floppy disks because they are too unpredictable. Sometimes they just 
up and die on you for no reason and be erased by magnets accidently. That could be a good 
thing if you want to be able to get rid of your list in hurry, but it also fucks you if 
you don't have a backup copy somewhere.

After you have a backup of your list and you're sure it works, delete the original off 
your computer. Make sure you store your passwords in a safe place. Leaving the disk on 
your desk labeled "Password File" is dumb. Somebody could steal it or use it themselves
if they are able to copy it and hack the encrypted file.


Section 4 - Notes
------------------------------------------------------
4.1 After the fact

Once you start creating and using secure passwords, do what you with them. Because I'm 
lazy, I leave an open copy on my computer's desktop so that I don't have to search for it
when I need a password. However, nobody else uses this computer or has access to it.

I don't recommend doing this if you share your computer.

I keep my disk in a safe place as well and update it as needed. When I go someplace, I 
take it with me, so short of beating the fuck out of me, there's no way you could get my 
disk.

Some other options for storing passwords : use a passwordsafe of some kind. That's what 
I've done in a way, but there actually programs out there that will store them for you 
and you only have to remember the password to open it. I guess that works, but I like my 
file much more.
