Well, not much people get to have an okay relationship with BRL to learn exactly how to clone.
Most people get the hang of it the first time but mess up, there are a couple of things you
should know before you clone.The first thing someone should learn about cloning is getting into
rooms. Most people are like 'Okay, let me go and press Join All to get all the clones in fast'.
Well, no you can't do that, sorry. A other thing about cloning is AIM's new cloning problems.
You can only get on 12 clones. I don't know about this new rule of theirs, and can't tell you
anything else about it. Sorry. Below I'll explain what you need to know, and have to clone.

Rules:
1. You need to register 12 screen names to sign on. It's a trend to have 'Clone1 through Clone12'
just to have an idea about what to name your clones. Just add your name or handle or something
to make your clones.

2. AIM also doesn't allow you to register more than 2 screen names on 1 e-mail address in less
than 24 hours. So just be creative and make up e-mail addresses that will probably never be used.

3. You need a cloner, duh? You can get one at http://www.hacksmadee-z.com/ in the AIM
progs section. The cloner is named 'AIM Clone Unlimited v2.1'. From the date that this text was
written it is number 2 on the list. This whole text is based on that cloner.

4. Scrolling with the cloners is a must when owning a room. You must always remember
AIM has a rate limit, so just to be on the safe side, only scroll 3 times every 30 seconds.
I myself enjoy rolling because people can just block you. If you don't know what rolling is,
close this text right now. Here is the best rolling code you can use. '//roll -dice15 -sides999'

5. Joining the room you want to own can be your deadliest mistake when cloning. You should
never join all the clones at once, because when you clone, it gives off an error with the cloner.
I can't explain why, but you should just join the room, each clone, 1 by 1 In the order they signed on.

Well, if you can't get the hang of cloning drop me a message. My AIM screen name is XERO,
if I'm not on it you can join the AIM private chat 'Room' and look around or ask people for 'Rogerz'
as some like to call me. Or if all that fails, check the AIM screen name for 'XERO'
