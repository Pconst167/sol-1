  h0h0 welcome to the special VALENTINES edition of irc weekly.  This issue 
is dedicated to love and romance (yeah right).  Anyways heres what todo for
your girlfriend today.  Go to her house or better yet have her come to yours
so you feel more powerful then like hand her a rose and candies, chocolates,
and whatever.  Next take her hand and direct her to the loveseat or couch or
hell your bed whatever is more comfortable for you!  Ok now the good part
once you have her sat down tell her you have a BIG suprise for her,
naturally she will think dirty thoughts in her mind.  At this point kiss her
on the lips and then pull out a copy of IW4!!!!!&^#@%^$!$!$%#!#$@!!$%#!
Now start reading it to her, and like dont read her this part cause then
she will think she is having dejavu or something strange, she could even
think she is on acid if she is a druggie, anyways back to the subject.
After reading her some of IW4 she will be driven into a frenzy and want you
sooo bad but dont break yet.  Get her todo things to your body that bring
you great pleasure (woo woo isnt valentines great).  Ok now _attempt_ to
finish reading her IW4 without being drawn into the realm of greater sexual
pleasures.  Ok if you have made it this far throw IW4 on the ground and do
what comes naturally*&!^@%!%!!&*@%! if you dont know what comes naturally
you have no life and need to see someone and get major help, but dont go
killing yourself because i said this, remember i am not stumble and i dont
want credit so i suggest you follow IW3 guidelines to commiting suicide.

Eye Scream For CTooLZ
---- -  - -- --   -

	Being part of the dev team for so long, and always seeing CTooLZ
being protected with my life, i didn't really like this news, but i guess
it's all good. It has been anounced that CTooLZ will soon become client do
to it's very high demand. As the main script writer, i can see this means a
flood of new people bugging me for the newest update, i'll have to do
something about that, i assume a CTooLZ site (and probably mirrors) will be
opened shortly. Bad news for those that offer 0 day hacked CTooLZ, sorry
guys, oh well most of the warez pups won't know it's public anyhow, they are
only kids...

	My new CTooLZ script is called Super CZ Tournament Edition,
completly re-written, it's top of the line. New features include an ANSI
toggle, for those freaks that use screen, or just can't handle it, and some
other stuff i could probably remember but am too busy trying to get IW4
released, just wait, you'll see.

	Anyway, you'll know when it's available, you'll feel the rumble. If
i don't reply to your requests for my script, it's probably been released,
i'll be sure to post about this in the near future.

	There will also be a windows version availble in the future, no date
is set at all. At this point, the code compiles, that is about all.

How to pick up Irc Chiqs
---- -  - -- --   -

          How to pick up Irc Chiqs (I'm really good at this)
                    -By Stumble (Stumbly Bumbly Bumm)

    w00p, its that time of year that we all love, Valentines Day.
    Since not everyone is fortunate enuff to have a girlfriend in
    real life (usually due to the fact that they live in front of
    their computers and they never go outside to meet anyone) I
    have decided to help you all find love on the network you love
    most, the internet (god I sound like a shitty commercial for
    AOL; But NEWAYS).  Okay. To get started we must lay down a
    few ground rules that you MUST OBEY!!

    1) Dont ask for a gif/jpg/tgz/mov/avi/xbm/iff/ilbm/etc

    2) Dont ask for numbers

    3) Try to resist asking for measurements, this can be REAL scary


    Okay Now to find a chiq, there are two ways to find one:

    1) Go into a channel and ask for a age/sex check (lame as hell)

    2) Sit around waiting for someone to act like a chiq (hard to do)


    Once you locate chiq:

    1) Talk to her publicly, this allows you to get in closer with
       her, so that she trusts you, and doesn't think your gonna netrape
       her

    2) Start private messaging her, this works as a kind of bridge between
       public and private chatting.

    3) Suggest that you move to a private channel to further talk, since
       typing /msg is annoying


    What to do once you have her in a private channel:


First of all you should paste this into the channel:

(Pretty rose I stole form some d00dler; look at it side ways REAL hard)

             ____          ___           __----__   _/\
          _/^ __ ^\_    /~^_/ |       )/^        ^-^ _/   A rose for
       _/^ _/^  ^\_ ^\ | ./  /~      /(            _/\.   <NICK>
     _/^_/^--_     ^\_^\-__-~      _/( \         _/  ./
   ./^_/|  \_ ~\      \_^\_      /^ _(  ~-_    _/ \./\
 _/^_/   \_  ~\ \      ^\__^\../^_/^ )\    ~~~~    _\/
<__/       ~\__\|         ^\.__./^      ~---____--~ ~\


Now you must be sure not to be to forceful, or to forward..
(as in the example below, also note that you shouldnt talk to anyone with
"Rape" in there name, just to be safe)

<Start NetRape Example>

<MindRape> you like semen?
<MindRape> wow do u spit or swallow?
<MindRape> PLEASE SAY SWALLOW
<|Turok|> hahahah..........
<D32x> hrmmm...  well it depends on what kind of mood im in.
<D32x> swallow...

<End NetRape Example>

    2) If you don't know what comes after simple chit chat, and going to
       a private room, then you need more help then I can possibly offer.

(Note: This is a short edition of the pick up chiqs article, due to
 lack of free time, I was unable to finish a more complete document)

Administrators -

        I have been monitoring the #warez channels online the Internet
Relay Chat looking for pirated software.  The following log was taken
from the #warez channel; it shows a user with the nickname "DesAngel" at
"desangel@newport.thirdwave.net" who is transfering the illegal copyrighted
software: Title Fight Boxing (Cracked by Raiden)

        It is under your jurisdiction to take action against this user.
If your policy permits it, I suggest that you scan the user's home-
directory for the above programs.  Then take appropriate action in
accordance with your Internet Policy Agreement and/or Network Etiquette
Policy.

        If scanning the user's home-directory for illegal software is
against your policy, then it would be appropriate to E-Mail the
offending user and instruct him/her to discontinue their piracy charade.

Thank you.

Needless to say i was shocked ..not so much at being logged offering .. as i

Sps was the first detective on the case .. and is also familiar somewhat 
with this Chris carter lamer .... he quickly did a search for the putz and 
didnt find him..

if i recall sps's exact werds .. was how did he get logs of ya from in here?..

-Good Question-

As i Write this .. tuesday night . the answer seems still distant ... no 
new leads have turned up

here is the info it was exactly 1:07 a.m Sunday Morning ( 2/11/95) EST when 
i was logged. ok you would be detectives in the crowd i invite you to solve 
the case of who tried to fuxer DesAngel .. oh as a by line .. my sys admin 
wasnt pissed .. and he edditied the email to make carter appear as if he was 
offerin netware 4.01 - 100 user and sent it to microsloth and the 
spa .. aint cool sys admins leet....

Spirt about Sprint
---- -  - -- --   -

	This is just something that ticks me off, Sprint Canada has recently
been offering "Long distance saving plans", along with a few other American
companies. Now...I've heard Americans being refered to as slow, or even
blatently stupid, but this is pretty bad. The majority of television
channels recieved in Canada, are from the US. Along with these channels come
American ads, including Sprints famous "Dime a minute" rate. Sprint Canada's
rates come nothing close to this, infact, they are similar to the MCI's
"Friends And Family", or cicle plans. While circle plans are stupid,
since...i would like to call more than two people, Sprint Canada doesn't
offer anything more than anyone else. In fact, I find the local telco's LD
rates to be much better than Sprint, and i don't have to kick friends away
to save a couple pennies.

	Just a thought...

Communiation Decency Act
---- -  - -- --   -

-[CDA - Communiation Decency Act]

        The Communications Decency Act is yet another reason proving Canada
superiour to the United States, a country where gun toting maniacs is OK,
yet saying fuck or shit could land you with a $250,000 fine and/or prison
terms.  In section 502 (d), it prohibits sending "indecent" material directly
to a minor or making indecent material available for display in a manner
available to a miror (including www pages, ftp sites, or usenet).  Making
sure your "minor" kid is not getting pr0n on the net is a parents
responsibility, because there is no way on the net to determine the age
of a user, thus is all "indecent" material going to be removed from the
net?

Some Important Dates in the CDA charade

July 26, 1995: The House Science comm. holds a hearing on cyberporn. Three
               different law enforcement representatives testified that
               the CDA does not address the problem of pornography on the
               net and might even hinder prosecutors in pursuing cases.

June 24, 1995: The American Reporter will bring a case against CDA 
               The American Reporter has stated they will immediately bring
               a case against the CDA should it be signed by the President.
               A martyr for a test case has already volunteered. 

June 21, 1995: Newt Gingrich speaks out against the CDA in a RealAudio
               sample with aswell a text version.

June 14, 1995: The final version of the CDA and the roll call vote [84-16]
               to pass the CDA (with minor amendments). 

Lets Skip a Bit here

April 17, 1995: An angry letter from a subscriber to AOL, unhappy with AOL's
                weakstand on the Communications Decency Act, disconnects his
                AOL account.

        The CDA will simply push out low budget internet providers, and huge
companies like Microsoft (another debate on its own :) ) will tell the
government that they will force the CDA on its internet users and be the
good guy and its really fucking annoying (I can say that.. I'm canadian).
Anyways.. life is good in Canada.... you americans suck..

There are ALIENS using the internet to spy on humans
---- -  - -- --   -

********************************************************************
     There are ALIENS using the internet to spy on humans!!!
********************************************************************

THIS INFORMATION MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE!  THE INTERNET OFFERS TOTAL
ANONYMITY AND PROVIDES THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ALIENS TO OBSERVE AND
INTERACT WITH HUMAN BEINGS WITHOUT BEING NOTICED!

MOST OF THIS ALIEN SPYING TAKES PLACE ON THE INTERNET RELAY CHAT
NETWORK.  ALIENS HAVE INFILTRATED THE NETWORK TO THE POINT THAT
MOST OF THEM HAVE OPS ON MAJOR CHANNELS AND SOME EVEN HAVE IRC 
OPERATOR STATUS!!!  THEY POSESS WAR SCRIPTS AND BOTS MORE POWERFUL
THAN EVEN PHOENIX OR EGGDROP!  THE TIMESTAMP PATCH HAS BEEN
WRITTEN BY THEM TO HARM OUR OWN ABILITY TO DEFEND OURSELVES WHILE
THE ALIENS SILENTLY GAIN CONTROL OF THE IRC NETWORK THROUGH THEIR
SUPERIOR IRC SCRIPT AND BOT TECHNOLOGY!

The following IRC log was made on IRC channel #netsex on December
26th 1995:
*** IRC log started 12/26/95 14:05:44
<BigUNZ> Yes! YES! YOUR BOTZ ARE SO P0W3RFUL!#$!
<ircuser0> Could someone dcc me a copy of phoenix or talkflood.c??
           Will trade XXX sitez!
*BoyT0Y* Hi. Do you have any pictures of human genital organs?
-> *BoyT0Y* Got anything to trade???
*** BillGates (bgates@microsoft.com) has joined channel #netsex
*** Vassago (vassago@unix.mclv.net) has joined channel #netsex
<Vassago> Anyone got any hairy male nudes???????
*BoyT0Y* I have many fast sites from #warez and #warez2

- How could he gain access to #warez without superior war script
  technology???  He obviously isn't eleet yet he claims to have
  a sitez list from #warez?????

-> *BoyT0Y* Anything else?
<BillGates> Anyone got a site with OS/2?
*** BoyT0Y is root@netcom17.netcom.com
*** on irc via server irc.netcom.com (NETCOM Online Communications)
*** BoyT0Y has been idle 1 seconds
*BoyT0Y* Yes I have Win96 on a very fast site!

- Root on NetCom!?!$  They must have superior passwd crackers or
  the ability to fake identd!

*** CTCP VERSION reply from BoyT0Y: Running Phoenix v3.14 by Vassago

- Everyone knows the latest Phoenix is 2.27a!  Vassago himself
  must be working for or under the control of the aliens and
  supplying them with newer versions of Phoenix!!!!  It is a
  conspiracy to withhold IRC script technology from humans!

*** IRC log ended

AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS GREAT DANGER!  THEY HAVE THE NEWEST VERSIONS
OF PHOENIX, NEWER THAN ANYTHING POSESSED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC!!!
THEY ARE LEADING A CONSPIRACY TO GAIN CONTROL OF IRC FOR STILL
UNKNOWN PURPOSES!!!!!!

  "I am a long time alien abductee. When undergoing hypnotic
   regression from my last abduction experience in October 1995,
   I remembered the usual experience of being paralyzed in
   my sleep and taken on board an alien craft where strange
   experiments involving my reproductive organs were performed.
   Several fluid samples from various parts of my body were
   removed. However, on this experience I remember seeing a
   computer on board the spacecraft. I could barely make out
   the screen and it appeared to be an IRC session... but the
   script was like nothing I had ever seen! Two aliens were
   sitting in front of the computer (they appeared to be of the
   Zeta-Reticuli "grey" variety) and appeared to be spawning
   clonebots in preparation for a channel takeover..."
         - Anonymous, December 2nd 1995

  "I was on IRC on.. well.. <long pause> I think it was some time
   in early September 1995... the whole experience is quite
   frightening and I don't like to talk about it. I was on IRC
   on #warez5 getting the latest sitez list and it was two A.M.
   and then all the sudden all these clonebots split into the
   channel and then it was like four A.M. all the sudden and I
   remembered nothing. During hypnotic regression I recalled
   only vague details about being invited to an invite-only channel
   and asked about the clonebot capabilities of my war script..."
         - Anonymous, December 15th 1995

  "This jerk split into our channel.. you see.. and he starts
   asking for 'human medical data!'  What the !?#$!??  Anyway,
   I kick him with something like 'try alt.sex.fetish.*' and
   I got flashed... this was no ordinary flash! It logged me
   completely out of the server and I had no dialtone on my
   phone line for hours!!! My admin said he had no log of a
   talk connect either!"
         - Channel operator on #oldwarez, December 21st 1995

  "I was hanging out on #sex one day and there was this wierd bot..
   It acted like an eggdrop but it wouldn't give anyone access
   when they used the 'hello' command.  It also had wierd version
   responses and ping responses with negative numbers and stuff.
   Anyway, I didn't think much of it until the bot somehow got
   ops and then immediatly massdeopped! I used my war script on
   it to no avail and I finally asked in #twilight_zone.  No
   IRCops came but all the sudden all these people from some army.mil
   site started joining the channel and asked us all to leave
   quietly. When I asked them what was going on they invited me
   to a +is channel and told me if I told anyone about the bot
   they would force my ISP to drop my account. When they finally
   gave the channel back the bot was gone! I tried /whowas but
   there was no record of it!"
         - Anonymous, November 17th 1995

Most of the serious activity appears recent, but on a closer look it
would appear that the conspiracy has been working for years.

   * Bots have been banned on most U.S. servers, with servers in
     other countries following closely. This is an attempt to
     neutralize our ability to defend our channels!
   * The TimeStamp patch is an attempt to neutralize our ability
     to defend our channels while doing nothing to stop superior
     war script technology!!!
   * Lag is obviously a conspiracy to slow our ability to communicate
     with each other, while the aliens use their superior bot
     chat networks to communicate lag-free!

AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A MAJOR CONSPIRACY AT WORK!!! THE GOVERNMENT
AND IRC OPERATORS APPEAR INTENT UPON COVERING UP THE EVIDENCE!

THE ONLY HOPE IN STOPPING THIS TAKEOVER IS TO DEVELOP ADVANCED SCRIPT
AND BOT TECHNOLOGY OF OUR OWN, AND TO TRY TO FIND AND BAN THE ALIENS!
WE MUST HAVE ALLIES WITHIN THE IRC OP COMMUNITY TO K-LINE THE
INVADERS!!!

RFD2001: Kangaroo Packet Network
---- -  - -- --   -

  RFD2001: Kangaroo Packet Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Author: Sputnik (#warez/Network 21)
Written under protest by order of Zircon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This request for discussion covers the idea of using Australian fauna to
replace our inadaquate internet network.

The Problem:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Australians are on the whole, rather lame, and as such, make very inefficient
use of their internet bandwidth.  (Example: A user wishing to download PKZip
will instead of logging onto their local BBS and grabbing it; will load
Netscape, and do a 5 hour tour in multimedia of the USA in an attempt to find
the file, probably checking out several Iwave and VR-HTML sites.)

Since our beloved Telstra keeps most of the bandwidth reserved to make more
money out of "pay-by-the-hour" internet service providers, (The slower the
network, the more money they make) it is proposed we use our great Aussie
fauna instead of choked ethernet/ISDN/whatever.

Definitions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kangaroo: A beast that hops on it's two hind legs using a long tail for balance.
          Is a marsupial and as such has a usefull pouch.  Commonly seen on the
          side of Australian country roads bloated and smelly with Wedge Tail
          Eagles eating them.  Have been known to kill drivers of cars by going
          through the cars windscreen, kicking and bleeding all over the
          unfortunate driver.
Emu:      Extremely stupid large flightless bird.  (So stupid that Shambala
          is thought to be a descendant of such.) ie, when an emu is confronted
          by a car, they will not try and dodge the car, but run in front of it
          hoping it will be able to outrun the metal beast.  Eventually they
          get tired and go under the car or through the windscreen, or they
          finally try and dodge through a barbed wire fence.
Koala:    Cute fury beast, much loved by the Japanese for their soft, cuddly
          nature. (Though many Australians suspect they are being used in some
          form of obscure gourmet sushi with whale meat).  They eat cheap
          eucylptus leaves.

Kangaroo's and Emu's are an abundant Australian resource.  They form part of
our national symbol but their are so many of them that we use them for pet food,
leather and meat.  Unlike the American Bald Eagle which would make an admirable
packet carrier, it is not too rare to use.

Kangaroo's currently form a large portion of roadkill and dog food so should be
turned to packet cariering for computer networks...

The proposed network structure is this:

Type    Speed           Transport Mode  Expected throughput     Swimming skill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
T1      5km/hr          Koala                   1.44 MB/Day             V.Poor
T2      15km/hr         Kangaroo                14.4 MB/Day             OK
T3      30km/hr         Emu                     144 MB/Day              Poor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As you can see, the expected throughput is orders of magnitude higher than that
currently reached by the existing network.
(It takes like 3-4 days to leech 10MB)

METHOD
~~~~~~
1)      All fauna will be fitted with carrier bags and/or pouch liners that are
        magnetically shielded and watertight to prevent data corruption.
2)      Animals will be fed chemical stimulants to boost bandwidth and lessen
        appetite for eucylptus leaves.
3)      Ocean crossing fauna will be fitted with swimming goggles and taught
       "The Australian Crawl"
4)      Reflectors and lights will be fitted to the animals to make the chance
        of "packet collisions" with cars and trucks less likely.
        Packet collisions will probably reduce to 10-20% of all packets sent
        which is a great improvement on the current network.
5)      All data transmitted will be on standard 1.44MB FDD's...
        Multimedia net communications  should instead be sent on CD's.
6)      When an animal tires an Australian systems admin, (rooter)
        will load the packets into another animal and rest and comfort the
        previous beast.

FINAL
~~~~~
As you can see this is a great improvement on the current Australian network and
I think should be seriously discussed by Australian admins...

<Sorry this was not better but hey, I thought it all up under
pressure in about 20 mins.  Add to it if you will.>

In a factory down-town.

Some soaking boldges in the shade..

Squished rotten bitch in my fist
Dreamed about you... Woman
I poked my finger down inside,
Make a little room for an ant to hide,
Natures little candy in a hand, or a can, or a pie..

Why do people ask me for porn?
---- -  - -- --   -

	It always appeared to me that the media only saw the Internet as a
massive electronic feed of porn. Apparently, some people watch this.

	Whenever the posse comes over, I try to hide my room. In it lays a
machine, a machine only known to them as "The Web", or if I'm lucky,
"Internet Computer". Saying it's broken works for a while, but they become
wise to me, they know what it holds. Bursting past me, hearing the click of
the monitor power switch, I know i have now lost. Now i must show them.
"Pamela! Pamela! Pamela!", they chant, it echos in my ears. They sit at the
login prompt in awe, "Whats this", they say, "wheres Pamela?". At the speed
of light, i cram my password into the keyboard (they're parents who know
tcp/ip might try to hax me), i load Netscape, and hand them the mouse.
"Right on, Internet...now what do we do?". I yoink up Pamela on the screen,
and head of to Tim Hortens, they'll be a while, theres 3 pictures on that
page. 

	On the walk back, i discoverd what a stupid article this would be,
so i wrote it, is it only me this happends to? Ahh well, at least my friends
think I'm a hacker...a person who breaks into banks and gives people
viruses, oh, and knows how to get Pamela on the screen.
