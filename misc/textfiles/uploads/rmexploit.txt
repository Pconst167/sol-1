here is a great little exploit i have discovered, 
for RM networks mainly used in schools/offices etc.
Simply turn off the computer then pull out the 
network cable in the wall. Now insert a win95/
win98 boot disk (which ever one applies)
Now all you need to do is power on the machine and 
wait. You will be in dos!! so to cause some trouble, 
you could type "format C:" to wipe the entire hard 
drive or just enter "del *.*" therefore deleting 
everything in the root directory.
To get into a normal windows desktop etc type "win"
