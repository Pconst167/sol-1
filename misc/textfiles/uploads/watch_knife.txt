WATCH KNIFE
By: DIzzIE 
 Ó'99  (who else can make such a great file?)

WHAT: A groovy little self-defense weapon that is hidden under your wrist, and held in place by your watch belt. Just get a regular sharp knife and wedge it under your watch belt (on the inside of your arm, the palm side).

SCENARIO: You get mugged in a dark evil valley in Beverly Hills. As you hand the mugger your wallet you move (or 'flick') your palm up; exposing the blade and stabbing the mugger in the windpipe. Then you sit back and watch the fucker die. 

So now you are prepared to strike back if you get attacked…..just don't go looking for trouble, you darn hooligan, you!
