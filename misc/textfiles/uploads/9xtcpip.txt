BEFORE beginning make sure you have your connection information all written 
down somewhere if it required special mods to TCP/IP protocol.


THE STEPS:
- click start > settings > control panel
- double-click network
- highlight TCP/IP and click Remove, click OK
- click yes to reboot your machine

Once booted up again:
- click start > settings > control panel
- double-click network
- click Add.. > Select Protocol > click add again
- highlight Microsoft in the manufacturer box, click TCP/IP in the other
- click ok
TCP/IP will now be reinstalled, you will be prompted to reboot your computer
and hopefully your internet issues will be resolved.
