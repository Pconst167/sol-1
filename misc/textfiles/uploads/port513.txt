RedHat Linux v. 5.1 has a serious problem in it's networking. I found
this out by sending a few messages to the rlogind port, (port 513) on my 
Linux box after seeing it mentioned in my /etc/services file. What happened was
: I was looking through my /etc/services file when I saw an entry named login.
I noted the port number then switched to another virtual terminal. Then I 
telnetted to port 513 and entered the user name root. The thing just 
disconnected me, so I tried again using my non-priveledged account confucious.
Still no feedback. Naturally I gave up on that being very useful.

Later on, I figured that I would make a few changes to my bootloader, so
I tried to su to root. Alas, that did not work. So I logged out then tried to 
log back in as root. Still didn't work.
Here is a transcript:

[confucious@localhost /]$ su root
su: invalid password

## This seems wrong because su usually asks for a password.

[confucious@localhost /]$ exit
logout

## clearscreen

Red Hat Linux release 5.1 (Manhattan)
Kernel 2.0.35 on an i586

login: root

Invalid Password.

login: confucious

Invalid Password.

## This is extremely weird as I haven't even entered a password yet!?!?

And this is what happens when you send shit to Port 513 on RedHat 5.1. Damn!
Also, this problem was not fixed by reboot. I had to re-install to get it
working again. Now wouldn't that piss you off?
