I) Respect not pity or weakness, for they are a disease which makes sick the strong. 

II) Test always your strength, for therein lies success. 

III) Seek hapiness in victory - but never in peace. 

IV) Enjoy a short rest, better than a long. 

V) Come as a reaper, for thus you will sow. 

VI) Never love anything so much you cannot see it die. 

VII) Build not upon sand but upon rock And build not for today or yesterday but for all time. 

VIII) Strive ever for more, for conquest is never done. 

IX) And die rather than submit. 

X) Forge not works of art but swords of death, for therein lies great art. 

XI) Learn to raise yourself above yourself so you can triumph over all. 

XII) The blood of the living makes good fertilizer for the seeds of the new. 

XIII) He who stands atop the highest pyramid of skulls can see the furthest. 

XIV) Discard not love but treat it as an imposter, but ever be just. 

XV) All that is great is built upon sorrow. 

XVI) Strive not only forwards, but upwards for greatness lies in the highest. 

XVII) Come as a fresh strong wind that breaks yet also creates. 

XVIII) Let love of life be a goal but let your highest goal be greatness. 

XIX) Nothing is beautiful except man: but most beautiful of all is woman. 

XX) Reject all illusion and lies, for they hinder the strong. 

XXI) What does not kill, makes stronger.
