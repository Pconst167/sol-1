How To Make A Flamethrower
Just as a note, this is not like all the other flamethrower plans. Also, I’ve 
never tried it, so don’t burn your fucking nuts off, trying something that 
hasn’t even been tested.
 
 
Supplies
* Gasoline or some other flammable liquid
* Any strong water gun (preferably a super soaker (jet stream))
* One of those really long lighters
*Strong tape
 
-if your lighter has a knob that you have to twist before it will light, 
twist the knob, and tape it in place, which might be rather difficult, but do it 
anyway
-tape the handle end of the lighter to the end of the water gun, so that the 
tip of the lighter protrudes past the end of the water gun, by about 1”, and 
leave the lighter trigger uncovered. If it’s a pump water gun, leave the handle 
of the pump un the side of the lighter closer the handle of the water gun, 
and tape the lighter as far forward as possible, to allow maximum pumping space.
-fill the water gun up with gas, or your flammable liquid.
-if you have a pump gun, pump it as much as you can, with the space that you 
have not blocked with the lighter
-pull the trigger of the lighter, so that the flame  is floating right in 
front of the gun, and fire the gasoline filled gun.                             
P.S, if you get blown up when you’re doing this, I’ll try to remember to 
visit you in hell when I die.
                                                                   -by, do 
you really give a shit who wrote this
Have Fun
