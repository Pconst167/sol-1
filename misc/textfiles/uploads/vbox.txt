            Intro:
            Have you ever wanted to hack your very own voice
            mail box ¿? Well
            with this file
            may your dreams come true. now let's get into the
            shit

            Alright if you don't know what all the diffrent
            voice mail systems
            sould like

            Here's a few examples:
            Skytel vmb: 800-520-5458
            Octel/Aspen: 800-487-6245
            Meridian: 800-422-6245
            Audix: 877-999-6245
            Message Center: 800-317-6245
            Phone Mail: 800-520-9666

            Here's the defult code to vms
            Audix: Box number
            Aspen/Octel: Box Number,0000-1111-2222-ect-,1234
            Meridian: Box Number
            Phone Mail: Box Number,1234,9999
            Message Center: None (no password)
            Skytel: last 4 of box number,9999,1234
            Partner Mail vs: 1234,9999


            Here's A few ways on how to get voice mail
            systems:
            Scanning (best way)
            From Another Phreak (Okay)
            Off The Internet (lamor)

            Now if you scan yourself you will have very good
            chances to get some
            voice mail boxes.
            Getting a VMS from a fellow phreak is alright
            unless they gave it out
            to everyone and there mom
            and if you get them off the net chances are they
            will be not in
            service or something else that is no
            where near a vms (what the hell am i talking
            about oh well) and you
            would also be a 31337 Lam0r.

            Alright now you got yourself a voice mail system
            by now or at lease
            should.

            Logging In to voice mail boxes
            Audix: *8
            Aspen/Octel: #
            Meridian: *81
            Message Center: *
            Phone Mail # (i may be wrong)

            Findig A valid box:
            Start with 100 and 999 if it has 3 digit boxes
            If it's 4 digit boxes try 1000 and 9999
            if both of them don't work try
            200,300,400,ect,ect, or
            2000,3000,4000,ect,ect
            if you still have no luck on finding a box
            there's two things you can
            do quit and me a lamor or
            be a tru phreak and scan the whole system.

            Okay, let's say you found a valid box. Let's say
            it's box 2600 and
            2610 is not a valid box number,
            but box 2630 is Your going to want to do some
            basic scanning to find
            a range of boxes. Scan
            2610 and below (make sure you note everything)
            then scan 2610 and up
            and 2630 and up this should give you an
            idea on how the boxes are mapped out on Voice
            Mail Systems.

            Finding A Vacant Box:
            Once you have found some valid boxes, start
            scanning for vacant
            boxes. A vacant Box is a box
            that where created by the system aministrator for
            future use, or
            boxes that have been abandoned
            when an employee was fired,transferred,ect. Call
            the system After
            Hours and enter in some of the
            valid box numbers you wrote down earlier when
            scanning

            You Should Be Listening For a greeting that sound
            like:
            A: Box "xxx" please leave a message
            B: Box xxx
            C: Leave A message After the tone "Beep"

            IF you come acrossed a greeting recorded by a
            human assume the box
            is "in use" Never ever
            take over a box that is in use by an employee.

            Some More Defult Codes:
            123,321
            1234,4321
            box number plus 1 example 26001
            1 plus box number 12600

            I'm in now what:

            1st See if there are any messages (if there are,
            listen to them. If
            the newest message is a month
            or older i would say it's safe to take) Also some
            system aministrator
            will send messages to every
            box on that system

            2nd  Change The Passcode And if you want the
            outgoing greeting

            Once you've successfully hacked a box, become
            familiar with it's
            features. Some Voice Mail Systems
            have features like make distribution list,message
            notification and
            other 31337 features

            More info On Vms:


            The purpose of this section is to briefly touch
            on some of the
            voicemail
            systems you are likely to encounter. I will
            provide general
            background
            on each system, as well as default passwords if
            they are available.

            Alltel - This is a voicemail system for cellular
            telephone users only.
                    From your cellular phone, dial #99 and
            "SEND". Enter your
            security
                    code, and you are in. All vacant boxes
            will have a default
            password
                    of 9999. Alltel voicemail has several
            desirable features
            including
                    the ability to change your security code,
            record a personal
                    greeting, create a "greeting schedule",
            and forward messages
            to
                    other users.

            A.S.P.E.N. - Most people will agree that
            A.S.P.E.N. (Automated Speech
                        Network) is one of the best voicemail
            systems. To find a
            vacant
                        box, scan some common three digit
            numbers until you hear
            an
                        automated voice say "You entered XXX.
            Please leave a
            message at
                        the tone...BEEP". Hit # and enter the
            box number when
            prompted.
                        A friendly female voice will discuss
            some of the better
                        features of the system and ask for
            your "temporary
            password".
                        The password is usually four digits.
            It is probably one
            of
                        those on my default list. Features to
            look out for
            include
                        the ability to control message
            playback speed, message
                        forwarding, and "envelopes", extended
            absence greetings,
                        the awesome ability to create and
            moderate "guest boxes"
            for
                        friends, and distribution lists.

            Audex Voice Power - From the onset, Audex systems
            are difficult to
            identify.
                               When calling a suspect number,
            hit *7. It should
            respond
                               with "Welcome to Audex Voice
            Power, please enter
                               extension and # sign". Box
            numbers are three or
                               four digits and usually start
            with a 2. The
            password
                               will be the same as the box
            number. You are
            required to
                               hit # after entering the
            extension number, and
            the
                               password. Features include
            easy message recording
            and
                               forwarding, as well as out
            call for message
            receipt
                               notification.
                               
            Centagram - Most Centagram systems are direct
            dial. This means that
            each
                       customer has his/her own 800 number
            where you can leave
            messages
                       without having to go through
            extensions. You can only
            hack these
                       systems if you have the valid number
            of at least one
            legitimate
                       user. Once you have a valid box, scan
            other numbers in
            sequence.
                       Most, if not all, Centagram systems
            will group the boxes
            together
                       in "blocks". Upon calling a vacant
            box, you should hear a
            generic
                       greeting. Before you are told to leave
            a message, hit #.
                       You will be prompted for a password.
            The password will
            usually
                       be the last four digits of the box's
            telephone number. If
            this
                       does not work, try some of the
            defaults mentioned above.
                       Centagram systems are very user
            friendly, and the nice
            lady
                       will guide you through a list of
            options upon entering
            the box.

            Cindi - Cindi systems are pretty easy to get
            into, and they tend to
            have
                   some nice features. Upon calling the
            system and pressing #,
            you
                   should hear "Please enter the person's
            name using your touch
            tone
                   keypad, last name followed by first. To
            enter a Q or Z push
            1..."
                   The disconnection message should sound
            something like "Thank
            You,
                   Good day". Mailboxes are usually grouped
            together in blocks
            and will
                   be either 3 or 4 digits. To log in you'll
            have to call the
            vacant
                   box and hit "0" when the message starts
            playing. The default
            password
                   for Cindi systems is also "0". Features
            include message
            recording
                   and forwarding, playback volume
            adjustment, call placements,
                   distribution lists, certified messages,
            and the ability to
            create
                   guest accounts for friends.

            Meridian - These systems are the easiest to
            identify. Upon calling
            the
                      number you should hear a female voice
            say "Meridian
            Mail....
                      Mailbox?" The box numbers are usually
            four digits and are
                      grouped together in a logical fashion.
            The default password
                      is the same as the box number.
            Meridians have some nice
            features,
                      including the ability to dial out (some
            systems). Other
            features
                      include message forwarding, and
            "envelopes", distribution
            lists,
                      personal greetings inside the mailbox,
            and the ability to
            log out.

            Message Center - The Message Center is the
            easiest direct dial system
            to
                            hack. Once again, you must find a
            valid box in the
            prefix
                            you are scanning. After you have
            successfully
            located a box,
                            hit * twice to access the main
            Message Center Board.
            It
                            should say something to the
            effect of "Welcome to
            the
                            Message Center. Please enter a
            mailbox number or
            wait".
                            Enter box numbers in the same
            prefix and listen for
            a
                            generic message. Once you've
            located a vacant box,
            hit
                            * once to log in! It's really
            that easy. Although
            features
                            are lacking, it is always nice to
            have a direct dial
            box.

            Octel - Not much is known about these systems.
            Upon calling the
            system and
                   hitting the # key, you'll be prompted for
            a mailbox number.
            Enter
                   the number followed by # and you'll get
            the password prompt.
            Feel
                   free to try some of the defaults from my
            list above.
            Remember, all
                   commands made outside the box must be
            followed by #. Once
            inside,
                   you'll be walked through the basic setup.
            Some Octel systems
            will
                   require you to change your pass code
            immediately. Desirable
            features
                   include the ability to control message
            playback speed and
            volume,
                   message notification, future delivery
            option, "private"
            delivery
                   option, faxing feature, and distribution
            lists.

            One Connect - Perhaps the most useful voicemail
            system currently on
            the
                         market. Most One Connect systems are
            direct dial.
            Virgin
                         boxes will give you set up
            instructions when called.
            Press *
                         for the password prompt, and key in
            the default code
            1234.
                         Once inside, you can listen to
            messages, retrieve faxed
                         messages, set up message
            verification, call long
            distance
                         numbers using the PBX, configure
            instant paging, and
            even set
                         up a toll free loop where callers
            can reach you.

            RSVP - These systems suck! They can only hold 23
            boxes. Upon calling,
            hit
                  * for the directory of boxes. If you hit #
            first, you'll be
            given
                  a list of options. As soon as you select
            any option, you'll be
                  prompted for a mailbox number. The mailbox
            numbers are almost
            always
                  two digits. The password will be the same
            as the box number.

            Skytel - One of the more difficult systems.
            Skytel voicemail is a
            bitch
                    because you are required to enter the
            password first,
            followed by
                    the box number. Many new voice mail
            systems are adopting
            this
                    method since it makes hacking next to
            impossible. The best
            way to
                    hack Skytel is to get a PIN number of a
            user and call
            customer
                    support claiming to be the dissatisfied
            customer. Call 1-800-
            SKYUSER
                    (1-800-759-8737) for Customer Support.

            Sperry Link - An all around nice system that can
            be a bitch to hack.
            Call it
                         up and you'll hear "This is a Sperry
            Link voice
            station. Please
                         enter your user ID". Just try some
            common numbers in
            sequence.
                         Most IDs are five digits. If you
            hear "This is an XXX
            answering
                         service" you have found a valid box.
            Hit *# to get the
            log in
                         prompt. At this point you'll just
            have to guess the
            password.
                         Try some of the defaults from my
            list. The passwords
            are
                         usually four digits.

            In addition there are many other systems not
            listed here. You'll
            encounter
            these unnamed systems too. Some of them are nice
            others are not.
