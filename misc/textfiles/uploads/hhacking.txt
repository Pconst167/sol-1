[Blending In]
Its pretty easy to do this. The main thing is to keep a stright face. Lets say for example you need to pose as a retarted person. Of course you would have to keep a stright face but you would want to blend in and make people think you are retarted. Sort of like that movie with Johny Knoxville. In the movie he poses as a retard so he can fix the special olympics.


[Know the Network]
It also helps to know your sourndings. Lets say you want to do something at Wal-Mart that will require Social Enginering. Its good to know managers names, departments, etc... Lets say you need an employees phone number or some sort of personal information. You could pose as Jim Bob, store manager from store number 666 needing information on employee Danny Marcum from store number 777. You would gain this information by knowing your sourndings and network.
