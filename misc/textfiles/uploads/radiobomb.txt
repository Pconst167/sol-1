            you may do with the instructions within

            own decision, and you must alone take the

The Radio Bomb:
 Note that this is not one of those radiocontrolled
 bombs which is set off by you pushing a button. 
 It is set off by a radiostation broadcasting. 
 You will need the following equipment:
 - Radio with light which lights up when it receives
   signal
 - Wire cutters
 - Some sort of explosive
 - Plastic bag
 - Some Electrically Triggered detonator

To Make The Radio Bomb:
 Open the radio and locate the two(2) wires going
 to the small LED(Light Emitting Diode). Cut Them
 off near the LED. Fill the plastic bag with the
 explosive and put the bag inside the radio(make
 sure no electricity get in contact with the
 explosive. Now, connect the two(2) wires to some
 sort of detonation device, which you put in the
 plastic bag. Now put the radio back together so
 that it seem like nothing happen.

How It Works:
 When the radio is turned on, and the radio receives
 no signal, nothing will happen. But when someone
 tunes the radio so that it receives signal from the
 radio station, the electricity which would normally
 light the LED will ignite the explosive and cause a
 massive explosion.
