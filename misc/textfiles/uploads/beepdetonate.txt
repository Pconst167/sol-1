            you may do with the instructions within

            own decision, and you must alone take the
            fall for it.


The Beeper Detonator:
 This detonator is like the title say based on a
 beeper/pager(those small thingies you keep in
 your pocket. People can call them and their
 number appears on a small screen)
 It is actually very easy to make, the only
 noticable cost is the beeper/pager.
 Anyway, what you need to make it is this:
  - A beeper/pager
  - Wire cutters
  - Small screwdrivers
  - Soldering bit
  - Tin solder
  - Electrical igniter
  - Your favorite bomb

How To Make It:
 First, unscrew alle the screws on the surface of the
 beeper/pager. Now, when inside it, locate the wires
 going to the speaker. Cut them off near the speaker
 and solder them to the poles on the electrical
 igniter. Now you have a Beeper Detonator.
 
How To Use It:
 Place your bomb somewhere, then place the electrical
 igniter somewhere on the bomb so that it sets it
 off. Now, go to a safe distance and call your beeper.
 This will set the bomb off. One of the fine things
 with this bomb is that you can travel to the other
 side of the country and then detonate it.
 But be sure that you buy a totally new beeper with 
 a whole new number. You don't want some relative
 calling you when you are rigging this.
