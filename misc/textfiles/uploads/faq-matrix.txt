This was orignally designed to cover aspects of matrix revolutions, however
plans have changed and this is now a FAQ to the matrix trilogy. This also
covers SOME animatrix stuff in order to further understand the matrix 
trilogy. This is however, intended to cover the main movies.

PLEASE NOTE, THIS DOES CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR THE MATRIX SERIES,

 1. HOW DID SMITH DIE? (M3)
+-                       -+
The theory is that Neo is Smith's antithesis. Therefore if Neo dies
so does Smith. How Neo "dies" or if he dies at all is not explained.
Neo's plug was pulled when he became Smith, thus killing Smith as
well.

Its also possible that, in turn Neo actually was able to manipulate
Smith's coding to destory him, similiar to that in The Matrix. The
machine then pulled the plug on Neo to recode and reinsert him into
the Matrix.



 2. HOW DID NEO GAIN HIS ABILITIES IN THE REAL WORLD? (M3)
+-                                                       -+
Interaction with The Architect gave him a new upgrade that allowed
him to be somewhat connected to machines, therefore giving him the
ability to kill machines with limited power. Neo essentially becomes
"connected" with machines after his meeting with the Architect.



 3. WHY WAS SMITH SUDDENLY ABLE TO FLY IN THE FINAL BATTLE? (M3)
+-                                                             -+
He gained the abilities when he changed the oracle into Smith. Its
obvious he gains some sort of power from the Oracle when the room
suddenly fills with a gust of air and the new smith laughs.



 4. WHY WAS SMITH ABLE TO KNOW THAT HE WAS GOING TO DEFEAT NEO? (M3)
+-                                                                 -+
Once again, converting the Oracle gave him the ability to see what
exactly was going to happen.



5. WAIT IF THE MACHINES AND HUMANS MADE PEACE WHAT HAPPENS NOW? (M3) 
+-                                                                 -+
Since the machines need humans for power, the question remains how
exactly do they unplug everyone from the Matrix if the machines 
need them for power.

Its possible that the machines could slowly start releasing humans
from the Matrix, with a joint effort find a way to get solar energy
back.



 6. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TWINS? (M2) 
+-                                 -+
In reloaded, they explode in the truck. However they make it very
apparent that they survived when they turn into spirit form as the
truck explodes. Why they are not in this feat. is unknown.
Rumor has it they are in the credits.




 7. HOW DID THE CHILD MAKE THE SUNLIGHT FOR NEO? (M3) 
+-                                                  -+
Her parents were programmers, therefore she had probably picked up
the ability to program the Matrix somewhat.



 8. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO NEO? (M3) 
+-                               -+
That remains to be seen. Neo is either a) Dead or b) being reinserted
into the Matrix as a program. We will probably never know exactly what
happens to Neo.



 9. HOW DID CYPHER MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SMITH? (M1) 
+-                                                  -+
We never do find out how Cypher was able to enter The Matrix and be able
to escape without the assistance with someone else. This is actually quite
a huge plot hole.

Theory could be that Cypher had invented some sort of program to be able
to pull him out at a set time and since Cypher was with the rest of the
crew all the time he could have ploted it while the crew was sleeping.

Update: it has been confirmed that cypher used a automated system to
enter the matrix, at a set interval he was automatically pulled out
of the matrix.



 10. SEEING AS NEO GAINED POWER WHEN SMITH TRIED TO CONVERT HIM, WHY
 DIDN'T MORPHEUS?(M2) 
+-                                                                 -+
Morpheus simply lacked the ability to gain any power from it, While Neo
could. While this may not be obvious this is probably the most accurate
explaination.



 11. WHAT WAS TRINITY THINKING JUMPING OUT THE WINDOW? (M2) 
+-                                                        -+
She wanted to get away from the Agents (obviously) the problem is what was
her plan if she did in fact avoid getting shot? She would crash into the
car below..so essentially she would have been screwed either way.



 12. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE ARCHITECT? (M2) 
+-                                           -+
Essentially it could have been a early victory for Neo had he chose the
other door. At the same time the Architect told Neo "She is going to die
and there is nothing you can do about it." Meaning that picking EITHER
door she was going to die, you see she dies in Revolutions anyways Neo
just delayed it and delayed the victory of the machines.



 13. WHAT DID SMITH MEAN WITH THE STATEMENT, "IT'S HAPPENING EXACTLY
AS IT WAS BEFORE..." "WELL..NOT EXACTLY."? (M2) 
+-                                            -+
This is either a reference between Neo and Smith fighting in The Matrix
with Smith being plugged in, which he is no longer plugged in which
might be what his comment is.

Or its possible he is referring to the previous versions of the Matrix
in which he didn't have Neo's coding in him before.



 14. HOW DID SMITH MANAGE TO UNPLUG? (M2) 
+-                                      -+
Neo destroyed the manifestation of his program, this meant he failed
in his purpose. This gave him the choice/command to return to the
source for deletion and reloading, but Smith chose otherwise.



 15. WHY DID THEY NEED NEO TO STOP SMITH? (M3) 
+-                                           -+
Smith was uncontrolable by the source, much like Neo. Smith couldn't 
simply be deleted. Thus by sending Neo in, Neo becoming Smith...Neo is
essentially what made Smith controllable again. By Unplugging Neo all
Smiths died. Essentially by using Neo, they could establish a link to
Smith so they could destroy him.



 16. WHY DO THE MACHINES NEED HUMANS TO SURVIVE? (M1)
+-                                                  -+
During the machine vs human war, the humans scorched the sky to cut the
solar power. This failed and ultimately the machines found a way to use
humans as a source of power.

 17. WHAT IS A DEJA-VU IN THE MATRIX? (M1)
+-                                       -+
In the matrix this simply means that something has changed about the
program. contrast to what some people thought, the Agents changed the
program NOT NEO.



 18. WHY DIDN'T THE MACHINES KILL NEO WHEN HE WOKE UP IN THE REAL
     WORLD? (M1)
+-                                                              -+
The architect states in reloaded that the one is needed to restart
the matrix. Also, it is possible the machines thought he was dead
due to the pill.

 19. WHY DOES SMITH CALL THE ORACLE MOM IN REVOLUTIONS? (M3)
+-                                                         -+
This is because in the matrix world, the architect is viewed as the
father of the matrix and the oracle is viewed as the mother.

 20. HOW DID NEO END UP AT THE TRAIN STATION? (M3)
+-                                               -+
Theorically, Neo was able to hack into the matrix and control the
sentinels somewhat..destroying them at the end of Reloaded. Not
fully understanding his power his mind was locked into the Matrix.
The train station acts as the firewall if you will, it controls what
can or cannot enter the matrix, Thus Neo is there.

 21. HOW/WHY DID MORPHEUS KNOW NEO WAS THE ONE? (M1)
+-                                                 -+
Simply put, faith. Morpheus believed in something just simply believed
that Neo was the one. Much like one that believes in a god, there is
no proof it is just there.

 22. WHY CAN'T NEO DESTROY THE AGENTS LIKE IN THE 1ST MATRIX? (M2)
+-                                                               -+
As Neo states in the beginning of reloaded, the agents have been upgraded
to prevent this.

 23. WHY DIDN'T EVERYONE DIE WHEN THE MACHINES DELETED SMITH? (M3)
+-                                                               -+
Smith essentially became a virus which overwritten programs with his code.
However, the orignal code is still in-tact with his infection, by deleting
the infection you have the orignal code back. Thus no one was killed when
Neo deleted Smith.
For visual purposes:
010101010 < orignal code
01110101010 < infected smith code
010101010 < deleted smith code, orignal code restored


 24. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE TVS IN THE ARCHITECT ROOM? (M2)
+-                                                             -+
They were essentially there to show choice. Each TV represented a different
reponse Neo could have gave the architect.

 25. DID NEO DIE AT THE END OF REVOLUTIONS? (M3)
+-                                             -+
The general thought is yes Neo did die. He was going to be inserted into
the matrix as a code, and this code would then be used in the matrix when
it was reset. Thus essentially Neo would be in someone else's body.

 26. WHAT WAS NEO'S MAIN PURPOSE THEN? (M1/M2/M3)
+-                                              -+
Neo's purpose was to create peace between the machines and the humans.


 27. WHAT WAS WITH THE SILVER STUFF NEO GOT ALL OVER HIS BODY? (M1)
+-                                                                -+
Shortly after taking the pill it shows Neo touching a mirror, which soon
goes all over his body. This is caused by the pill interfering with his
senses of the real world and the matrix.

 28. WHO WAS THE SECOND SURVIVOR AT THE END OF RELOADED? (M2)
+-                                                          -+
If you paid attention, it was Bane. Bane was essentially the one who gave
Smith any real world interaction.

 29. WHY WAS THE HIGHWAY A THREAT IN RELOADED? (M2)
+-                                                -+
In reloaded you'll notice that trinity and morpheus get in a discussion
about not going onto the freeway. This is because the sheer numbers of 
people makes it hard because there are so many possible bodies the agents
can turn into.

 30. HOW THE HELL DOES NEO KILL THE SENTINELS? (M3)
+-                                                -+
Neo was able to kill the sentinels because he was connected to the source,
he was able to connect to each sentinel and make them self-destruct. He
connected to the source through the architect.

 31. WHY DID SMITH FREAK OUT TOWARDS THE END OF REVOLUTIONS? (M3)
+-                                                              -+
In the movie, Smith starts to freak out at the end right before he has
the chance to kill Neo. Neo stands up, Smith cannot understand choice, and
couldn't understand why Neo kept fighting. Smiths vision only showed up to
the point where Neo was down, he didn't think Neo had a choice, since he 
cannot comprehend it.

Alternatively, when Smith says "Everything that has a beginning has a end
neo." It is possible that the Oracle was speaking to him, in which caused
him to choose to keep fighting.

 32. WHAT IS THE DEUS EX MACHINA? (M3)
+-                                   -+
This refers to the source (the main machine). In technical terms it means
a god from a machine, or a entity that solves a previously unsolvable
problem.

 33. WHAT WAS WITH THE SENTINEL PASSING THROUGH NEO? (M3)
+-                                                      -+
The sentinel in this scene hits the window of the logos (the ship) and the
energy/spirit of it passes through Neo.

 34. WHAT 'PEACE' DID NEO GAIN FROM DEFEATING SMITH? (M3)
+-                                                      -+
The machines no longer attacked Zion, and people inserted into the Matrix
now had a choice on weither they wanted to stay in the matrix or live in
the real world.

 35. HOW DID TANK DIE IN THE MATRIX? (M1)
+-                                      -+
There is no official answer to this question, but money dissagreements
essentially booted the actor from the following sequels. Theory 
storyline-wise is that Tank died during the sentinel attack or died after
the EMP gun wounds.

 36. WHO EXACTLY IS SERAPH? (M2)
+-                            -+
Seraph is the protector of the oracle, but seemingly is a guardian angel.
In the club scene the enemies distinctively call him wingless as well as
the merv calls him wingless in french.


 37. WHEN TRINITY FALLS FROM THE BUILDING, SHE CLEARLY HITS THE AGENT
     AT LEAST ONCE, WHY DIDN'T THIS KILL HIM? (M2)
+-                                               -+
As you may recall, in The Matrix shooting the agent kills the orignal 
host and the agent dissappears. At the beginning of Reloaded, Neo fights
agents and clearly states "Hmmm. Upgrades." Perhaps the upgraded agents
do not follow the same rule as before.


 38. WHO IS NEO TALKING TO AT THE END OF THE MATRIX? (M1)
+-                                                      -+
As the closing scene comes we see Neo talking on the phone to someone while
the trace program is shown. Neo is talking to the source telling it that
he is going to show all these people a world without boundries or control.

 39. WHY WAS THE MATRIX WORLD CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE? WHY
     NOT LOCK HUMANS UP? WHY THE IMAGINARY WORLD? (M1)
+-                                                          -+
There are a couple reasons for this, a human in a sleeping state
is easier to control, plus an active brain produces much more energy
than one that is not active.

 40. WHAT STARTED THE MAN/MACHINE WAR? (ANIMATRIX)
+-                                              -+
In the beginning civilization had advanced to the point where machines
did most of the work, until a machine codename B166ER commited murder
of both his masters. This caused a trial, in the end the order was to
destroy all the machines of his kind. Massive genocide started and
many machines were destroyed, however many escaped and formed their
own home called ZERO-1. The machines later attempt to get along with
the humans, the humans reject it..then feed them with nukes "power of
1,000 suns" which had little to no effect to the machines. 
The machines then struck back taking various areas over, as a final
attempt "Dark Storm" which would turn the sky pitch black to prevent
sun from powering the machines.

 41. WHY DIDN'T THE APUs HAVE A ENCLOSURE TO PROTECT THEM? (M3/ANIMATRIX)?
+-                                                                       -+
The enclosures proved to be useless in animatrix, the sentinels could 
easily pull off the enclosure and kill the human inside.


 42. IS THE MACHINE CITY IN THE MATRIX TRILOGY ZERO-1? (M1/2/3/ANIMATRIX)?
+-                                                                       -+
ZERO-1 is the home town built when many machines were terminated. In the
matrix the machine city is believed to be (according to interviews) ZERO-1
as well.

 43. WHAT WAS MEANT BY CIPHER SAYING "...you know we're going to kill him
     right" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MATRIX? (M1)
+-                                                                      -+
This is a indication that Morpheus and Trinity freed others before Neo in
believing they were "The One" also, only to have them all die from the
agents. This is the first clue that Cypher did not believe what Morpheus
believed.

 44. WAS THE ARCHITECT THE DEUX EX MACHINA?
+-                                        -+
Yes, this is established at the end of revolutions when the architect tells
the oracle "What do you think I am, human?" Some believe it is not because
at the end of Reloaded Neo tells him He hopes they will not meet again, the
architect said we won't...but this might be referring to meeting in the
Matrix not outside of the matrix.

 45. WHAT DID NEO DO TO AGENT SMITH AT THE END OF THE MATRIX?
+-                                                          -+
After Neo recieved the kiss from Trinity, this is where he officially
becomes the one, he is able to see the code. Neo goes into his code
and disrupts it, This is why people were unable to defeat agents, they
were trying to kill them in a physical sense. What Neo didn't know was
that Smith could not be officially deleted unless the source did it for
him.

 46. WHAT IS THE MATRIX?
+-                     -+
The matrix is a delusional world made up to keep humans under control.
In the meantime the machines would havest power via brain waves, by creating
the matrix the mind was more active, hence gave off more power for the
machines.

 47. WHY WOULD ENTERING THE RIGHT DOOR SAVE ZION WHEN HE IS IN THE
     ARCHITECT ROOM?
+-                                                               -+
This is the point where the Architect gives Neo a choice, he can either
"save" zion by allowing Neo to select 23 individuals to rebuild Zion after
the machines kill it this time around, OR go through the other door and
save Trinity, and have your entire species wiped. Essentially the 
Architect was trying to con him into picking the door to rebuild Zion, this
way The One would just give up, which has happened to the previous 5.
