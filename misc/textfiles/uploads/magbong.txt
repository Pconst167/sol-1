How to make an easily concealable bong from a Mag-Lite:
Written 2-21-02

You will will need a big mag lite and a few basic tools.
This bong looks exactly like a working Mag lite until you
remove the top. The bowl is under the top. The mouthpiece  
is inserted into the switch hole, and the carb is opposite
the mouth piece and down about 2inches.
