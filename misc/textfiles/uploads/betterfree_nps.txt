A better way to get free Newspaper.

Here is a nice quick 'n' simple  way to get yourself a/some free newspaper/s All you have to do is get up(or still be up) around 4 or 5 am 
and get your lazy arse outside, go down to the corner shop or the newsagent, at this time of morning you'll find bundles of 100 news papers 
lying on the foot path(side walk) outside awaiting store opening time, nobody is around to stop you from taking them.
