 Some things should be thrown out to a more general audience when their purpose, and any possible uses, are 
 undiscovered by the original source.

 Therefore, I lay before you a text, simple and straightforward, that will show you something that is both
 banal and amazing, fruitless and far reaching, both for those of you who may try it for curiosity's sake
 and those who use it for furthering their knowledge of the powers that be.

 While this text may be seen as borderline Occult, the reality is this:  These steps will work for everyone,
 whereas Occult practices only work for those who give a damn enough to 'discipline' themselves.  So take
 this for what it is worth, and realize there is something to it, I just don't purport to know what it is.

 STEPS:
 ¯¯¯¯¯
	1. Sit opposite another person.
	2. Touch the tip of one of your index fingers to the tip of one of your partner's index fingers.
	3. Concentrate on the shape of a circle, while at the same time concentrating on having your index 
	   fingers move in the circular shape.

   	   What you are looking for here is a slight, almost imperceptible (at first) sensation that causes 
           your fingers to feel like they are being pushed (or pulled) in a certain direction (or shape).  
           It will feel as though your partner is actually causing the sensation, but this is not the case 
           (unless, of course, your partner chooses to be an ass).  When you begin to feel the sensation is 
           when you should begin this step of concentrating on a circle.  

           If you get your index fingers to go in a circular motion (in the air in front of you) try some 
           tests to satisfy whether it is the sensation, or whether it is your partner.  Try asking your 
           partner to think of a shape, without telling you, and see if you can get that shape to occur.  
           Afterwards, ask your partner if the shape drawn in the air, was, indeed, the shape your partner 
           was thinking of.

           If you find after several tries that neither of you feel anything, try practising on an actual 
           Ouija Board, using the eyepiece to center the concentration.  Once you get this down (which is 
	   something anyone in the world can get down, thus the ability of Parker Bros. to market it) you 
           can try this step again.

	4. Now that you know what the sensation feels like, master it, so that you and your partner can sit 
           down anytime, anywhere, and immediatly feel it.  


 PERSONAL EXPERIENCES:
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 For nearly a decade I have periodically 'played' with this.  Early on, my friends and I tried experiments,
 such as:

	1. Three people in a room.  Two 'practicing' the above steps, one concentrating on an object that
	   was in the room.  For instance, the 'concentrating' individual would think of a lamp.  We found
	   that about 80% of the time, the two who were practicing, if concentrating on the one who was
	   thinking of an object, were lead to the correct object (in this example, the lamp) by the 
           sensation conjured by the above methods.

	2. A group of friends and myself were walking through a cemetary when I sat them down, had them all
           hold hands, and introduced the above steps (only in a group situation, rather than in a pair).
           Within minutes our arms were flailing, and something was definitely in the air, but unfortunatly
           none of them were all that interested.

	   Note: I have found, in all my exeriences, that very few people find this of any interest what so
                 ever.  I do not know why this is, as it certainly beats watching T.V., a pasttime many of
		 those who were not interested enjoyed.

	3. I once used the 'sensation' while driving.  My friend and I put our touching hands on the 
           steering wheel, and allowed the sensation to direct the driving.  It went so far as to actually
           shift the gears for us.  The driving was excellent, but it didn't lead us anywhere.

	4. I recently used it to find a camping place outside of Saratoga, Wyoming (which, by the way, is
           a crappy little town whose claim to fame is its Hot Springs.  Well, they may think they have a 
           nice little Hot Springs, but it appeared to me to be a nasty little bottom-spanking house straight
           out of the 1970's that hasn't been fully cleansed since the time it was opened.) late at night,
           so we asked 'it' to guide us to one nearby (I had no idea where to find one).  It took us down an
           old dirt road, and a funny thing happened.  A church was on the side of the road, and as we 
           approached it, our fingers, which up to that point had been perched up in the air as though 'it'
           was looking out the window, quickley dropped to the floor of the car, as if hiding.  I thought
           it was funny, but the person with me got very upset and refused to continue 'playing' with it.
           
 The fact of the matter is this: I have become bored with this, and since no one else around me seems to have
 any interest, I have decided to toss it to you.  Should you have any interest, and think that it may indicate
 something, or you are able to go somewhere with it, or should you have any questions, write to me at the
