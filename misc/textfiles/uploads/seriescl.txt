  Introduction
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 There have been long established classes of shows in TV like sci-fi, criminal
 series, adventure,  etc.   But in the 90's some new have risen in the Western
 world.  Here're simple descriptions of these new classes.   Several  of  them
 are my own inventions (atleast their names), so you'll probably find that the
 mentioned shows ain't labeled this way in TV guides.

  The classification
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 Anime:          cartoons produced in Asia.
                 Easily  noticed by the drawing style: the characters have BIG
                 eyes, no anatomic details  are  missing  (if  some  character
                 appears   naked,   especially  as  this,  unlike  in  western
                 cartoons, *does* happen occasionally),  "minimalistic"  faces
                 when they're angry, etc.
                    Examples: "Pok‚mon", "Dragonball Z"
 Sitcoms:        comedy-series.
                 Most  notable details: when something is meant as a joke then
                 a laughing can be heard; most jokes are  verbal,  ie  there's
                 not much cake-in-the-face kind of humor
                    Examples: "Friends", "Spin City", "Roseanne"
 Reality shows:  action(?) shows in which several people are put together in a
                 (relatively) small area (an apartment, an island, etc.) which
                 they  can't  leave  and  different task are assigned to them.
                 Who looses must go and the last one will win.  The main  idea
                 of  those shows is to see how people react when they're being
                 filmed 24/7
                    Examples: "Big Brother", "Survivor", "Gestrandet"
 Docusoaps:      a 90's derivate from documentaries
                 Differences from normal  documentaries:  many  parts,  mostly
                 about  people,  done  to entertain people rather than to save
                 the event, done by amateurs and not  serious  documentalists.
                 Somewhat  similar  to  reality  shows, but isn't limited to a
                 small space and the event ain't being generated just to  show
                 it in TV.
                    Examples: "Pop-stars", "Schnulleralarm"
 Info-shows:     shows which  talk  about  many  non-related  things.  Usually
                 they're 30 minutes long.  A little like  news,  just  not  as
                 serious and the stories are longer
                    Examples: "SAM", "TAFF", "A4"
 X-series:       a 90's not-completely-sci-fi series
                 More   precisely   a   criminal   series   which  deals  with
                 supernatural or alien things and/or government conspiracies.
                    Examples: "X-Files", "Millennium", "The Profiler"
                 Also a 90's realization of the old "innocent but on the  run"
                 story with (almost) supernatural things and/or conspiracies
                    Examples: "Dark   Skies",  "The  Pretender",  "1st  Wave",
                              "Visitor"
 Ranger-series:  children shows with masked crime fighters.
                 Most (or even all?)  of  these  shows  are/were  produced  by
                 Saban.   Story:  several teenagers mutate into crime fighters
                 with plastic-weapons and fight monsters.  Often they  are  in
                 vehicle which  combine  into  a  big  robot.   The monster is
                 always defeated with a laser shot on which it drops dead  and
                 explodes.    The   main   focus   of   these   shows  is  the
                 karate-fighting.
                    Examples: "Power Rangers",  "VR  Troopers",  "Super  Human
                              Smaurai Cyber Squad"

  Conclusion

 So, dear  reader.    If  you  see  some x meaningless show which you couldn't
 classify before, perhaps you now can.  Right before you change  the  channel.
