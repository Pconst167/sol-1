I’d also like to say i tested this out myself and it works

Warning
===============
Well first warning i am giving you is to not do this in your school if they have cameras in the toilets like they do at my school(sick isn’t it)

The entire stall and bathroom is going to get "very wet" and so is the unfurtunate fucker that is going to get pranked

Ok you’ve had your warning so lets get started

The Prank
===============
All you need to do is take the lid off the cistern

Inside there is usually a vertical plastic pipe about 1 inch in diameter,going into the top of this pipe is a little plastic tube

NOTE:that in SOME toilet cisterns the tube is inside that pipe and you will have to break the top off so you can get to the hose

Now all you do is put it out of/toward the end of toilet cistern with the end of the hose just sticking out.now put the cistern lid back on(with the hose still just sticking out)

Now leave the toilets

What happens is when the random person has done his business and flushes the toilet he will get sprayed at out of the hose

Modification
===============
Modify it by putting some airsoft bb’s in it

This will hurt the person and soak them but IMO takes the originality out of the prank
