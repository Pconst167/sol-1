===============================
the floppy death disk	
===============================
first off on a personal note, i am cypher the only cypher, i rose to my hight in the 90's anmd have chosen to come back to
clear my name from all these nobodies that have decided to take my name that i earned for themselves seeing as how they can't think for themselves
and find their own name.

<I AM CYPHER.>

this is a personal favorite that uses only the most everyday products
i write this knowing that the older of us know how to make it, but the newer generation doesent know it can be made unless they read the about... one other
phile running around the net. this is a great device, very useful in an office building or other 
place that uses computers... well that means just about the fuck anywhere doesent it?! ahem..
yes it does.

now the items required are:
1.a floppy disk.

2.matches, (strike anywhere are best)

3.nail polish remover (which in a side note is a very effective tool in a persons' kit that should always be kept handy)

4.knife (if your slick and skillful you can get away with useing one, if you suck at precision cutting, use something plastic ans sharp)



the steps:

1.carefully take apart the floppy, saving all the pieces! (cant stress that enough, the floppy must work after the steps are complete)

2.that little fucking spring at the top that always flyes out when you open the floppy? the little one
that just flu out and hit you in the eye? get it fucker, i said all the pieces.

3.set them aside, and get the half that has the part where the film type thing is with the circle of
thin paper over it.

4.remove the paper now.

5.set aside and shave a bunch of match heads off of the wood their on and make a fine powder of it.
enough to cover the file of the floppy disk, for good measure put two coats of match head powder on it.

6.cover one side of the paper that you took off with nail polish remover.

7.quickly replace that paper in it's place on top of the paper, make sure the paper goes down so the nail polish remover 
is on the powder.

8.carefully put the diskett back together.

if done correctly the disk will be placed in a disk drive of an unsuspecting computer, by an unsuspecting person,
then it will be run and when the drive tries to read the disk the match powder with become heated, thus causing it to catch fire,
melting the reader head of the drive, and posibly damaging other components of the computer.

BTW keep yourself away from the drive when the disk goes in, there have been cases where parts have been ejected 
from the opening of the drive and have been implanted into flesh.

enjoy.

disclaimer: if you do it and get cought, i can't be held responsible for your own actions.
