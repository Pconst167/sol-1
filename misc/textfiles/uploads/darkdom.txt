The 2 most interesting things to read textfiles about are

1) Anarchy
2) H/P

or other ill shit that is similar

So my message to the textphile creators is this: I am damn 
proud of you for writing texts about this ill shit. It really 
makes it so fun to get drunk at night then look it up and read 
about it. 

It cracks me up, the content that makes its way to the web. 
Anything that is related to anything illegal is on here, and 
that fact is damn cool. This textfile is merely a message 
encouraging more minds to focus and concentrate on setting a 
new role model and way for today's youth. Let us show them 
the way. This textfile is not about what is or is not anarchy. 

Take a step back and a moment to pause to reflect on the amount 
of ill shit that made its way into textfiles. Damn, that's alot 
of stuff, and a lot of creative and good minds out there. Come 
on, really do it. Think about all the shit you've read about. 
Isn't it damn cool? I mean files about bombs, violence, ways to 
fuck someone's property up, sabotage, burglary, hacking, 
phreaking, and all sorts of other ill shit. I am so damn proud 
of you all. Keep up the good work and let's increase the amount 
of information exponentially!!
