WASTING THEIR TIME
By: DIzzIE Ó2000

This is a fun thing to try when you want to piss someone off, are bored, or want to get someone fired. If you know someone who has a job such as: car salesman, furniture salesman, virtually any kind of salesman, you probably know that those jobs sometimes pay on the amount of sales made. But we don't want any of those sleazy car salesmen getting rich, do we? 

What you do: 

* Go to a car dealer, or a used car dialer. Find your victim (one of the salesmen), tell him that you want to buy a car, but you don't know much about cars…He'll be happy to assist you. He'll show you one car, you'll spend a lot of time asking him every tiny detail about the car, like if it has a cup holder, or if the back seats can be taken out, or if it comes in green, or if it has a free cellphone with purchase, you get the point. When he's done answering your questions about that car, slowly stroke your chin with your hand and shake you head slowly, then say that you don't think this car is right for you because your inner spirit wont be comfortable in such a vehicle. Then go on to the next car. Keep this up for a couple of hours, or until the day is over. The salesman will probably start to get annoyed and start being just a tad bit rude, that's when you go to his superior….and somebody looses their job.

*You can use the above method with almost any sales job: you can make a furniture seller take you to every piece of furniture in the store, you can even occupy one of those telemarketers or door-to-door salesmen with pointless questions.

*For added affect, pretend to speak really poor English and make the seller repeat everything 5 times. 

This is just one way to strike back at corporate America. It works especially well if you get all your friends to come and do the same thing to the same business every day for a month. You'll block all the possible business they could have made and eventually they will go bankrupt…

Also, nothing hurts a business more than an upset customer. By posing as a seller and being rude to a customer you can make sure the business gets a kick in the ass.
 
Have fun kiddies!
