Ok Kids, we all know you like to surf porno on the internet, and we all know you don't want 
your parents to somehow find out.

Then there are you Parents, who flirt with porno, hoping your kids won't find out.

In this guide, I will show you exactly how to clear your internet tracks COMPLEATLY. 

I have read those horrible online guides telling you to go into internet explorer, and click 
on "Clear History". Well, thats not enough, your tracks are still there, anybody with a 
half ounce of computer skills CAN find out exactly where you have been. It only takes 
five minutes for me to get onto somebodys computer, and backup all of their internet history,
then see exactly what they have been doing on the internet.

Then there are the files that tell you to goto Temporary Internet Files, and just delete 
everything, well, THATS STILL NOT ENOUGH! There are hidden folders inside Temporary Internet 
Files that you have not deleted.

Enough Said, lets get to it

See all that shit? Inside those folders are EVERYTHING you have been to on the 
internet....EVERYTHING

The Way Content.ie5 is so hidden


cd\
cd windows\tempor~1\content.ie5\
edit desktop.ini


You should see something that looks like this:


[.ShellClassInfo]
UICLSID={7BD29E00-76C1-11CF-9DD0-00A0C9034933}



What that does is tells your computer to hide the folder 'content.ie5'. It tells it to hide it 
so well, that even if you are able to view hidden folders, it wont let you see 'content.ie5'.

Making Content.ie5 unhidden


Delete everything accept for '[.ShellClassInfo]'

before:
[.ShellClassInfo]
UICLSID={7BD29E00-76C1-11CF-9DD0-00A0C9034933}

now:
[.ShellClassInfo]


Now save it

This will make windows show content.ie5 folder.

How History.ie5 is so hidden


cd\
cd windows\history\history.ie5\
edit desktop.ini


You should see something that looks like this:

[.ShellClassInfo]
UICLSID={7BD29E00-76C1-11CF-9DD0-00A0C9034933}
CLSID={FF393560-C2A7-11CF-BFF4-444553540000}


-----

Making History.ie5 unhidden


Delete everything accept for '[.ShellClassInfo]'

The TEMP Directory

Then ofcourse there is the TEMP Folder. Just goto C:\WINDOWS\TEMP and delete everything inside 
it. If you think this is useless, then you are wrong. If you use Yahoo Messenger, then you 
probably have viewed a few webcams...Well, whatif you viewed some webcams that had some chick 
getting naked on it, and you didn't want your mean ole dad to find it? Yahoo places the last 
snapshot from the cam into the TEMP Directory. So, it is a very good idea to delete everything 
inside it.

Yahoo Messenger

When it comes to Yahoo Messenger, Yahoo are a bunch of assholes who think its a good idea 
to save every single fucking message you have sent. To delete any messages (evidence used 
against you in the court of law) from yahoo, just goto 
C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\Profiles and delete everything inside it, it has saved 
messages in it. Also goto C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\StoredIM and delete everything 
inside of it. It also contains saved messages.
