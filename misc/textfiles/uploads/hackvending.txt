Welcome. I will tell you about the programming menu (also known as 
Service Mode) on some vending machines. There are 2 types of machines: 
the Glass Front Vender (with a 3X6 keypad) and the plain, old ones with 
several choices. They're both the same.

Now, if you are lucky, the "service person" refilling the machine forgot 
to close the machine's door, go up to it.

The glass front model has a keypad. Press 4231, and you're in! You'll 
get several options. To change prices, go to "PRICE" to change it.

Here's the following commands for either model.

1=Go To Previous Menu
2,3=Go To an Option
4=Enter

"Price" setting routine
Use 2/3 to cycle to the option, and press 4 to change it. Then set the 
price.

If cash is what you're loocking for, go to Coinpayo (or CPO)
Press 4 to Enter, then use 2/3 to select an ammount, then hold 4 and 
money will come out!

Here's a situation:

There's a store you hate. They have a Glass front vendor. Go to 
TESTMENU, press 4, select RELAYS, press 4, then press 4 when it says 
COMPR #, press 4 to have it say COMPR 1 and run like hell!


It says "Caution: Failure to disconnect power to the compressor before 
testing the compressor relay will cause damage to the compressor."
