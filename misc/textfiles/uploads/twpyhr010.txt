Real Life Hacking:
Profitable Punishment

June 8, 2004


All that glitters isn't gold. Similarly, all that is brown isn't shit.

Faced with a choice you, by definition, have more than one option. Each have
their benefits and detriments. And sometimes the choice without negative
connotation isn't the best choice.

I went to a Catholic high school. We were required to attend mass every week.
Mass lasted an hour long. If you did not attend mass, you were punished with 1/2
hour of work.

So, by skipping mass and taking the punishment, I recouped 1/2 hour of time already alloted to the weekly mass.
