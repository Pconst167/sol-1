I would like if you could add this to the ANARCHY WEAPONs page on how
to make a flamethrower with a water gun.

What you need:

A water gun with a tip
Flammable Liquid
Matches

What to do:

Fill the water gun with flammable liquid where you would usually put
the water in. light the tip of the water gun with a match and shoot
the gun. if  the flame is gone on the water gun light the tip again
and shoot the gun.
