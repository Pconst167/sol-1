SODA BOMB
BY: DIzzIE Ó2000

Here's a simple little activity that will give you lots of joy, or is at least a good time killer. Get one of those aluminum (12oz) cans of Coke, or Dr.Pepper, or whatever, and shake it up, a lot, a whole lot. Then toss the now "pressurized" can on a hard or jagged surface in the middle of a crowd.  You can also use the big plastic bottles, but those need to land on a sharp point. Or you can always tie a good ol' M-80 or firecracker to the cans or bottles, to make sure they explode. Yup, nothing like tossing some of those at weddings, or barmitsfah. 

Enjoy…..but not too much…
