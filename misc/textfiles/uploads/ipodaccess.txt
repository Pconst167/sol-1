How To Get Free iPod Accessories
--------------------------------

by RustyBurrito



I have done this 5 or 6 times and some of my friends have too.  I have never known anyone who has gotten in trouble
for doing this so take advantage of it while you can! The only things I have tried are headphones and docks.  Some of the other options 
might require to you send whatever broke back to Apple and then they send you a new one.  


.:Step 1:.
You're going to need to get some serial number from iPods that are less then 1 year old.  If you are in school then this will be easily since a ton of kids
get iPods for Christmas.  Ask some of your friends for the serials and they will probably give them to you.  You can ask someone if you can look at their
iPod because you are thinking about buying one too and when you look at it just write down the serial.  They are on the back of the iPod and are hard to
see sometimes.  If you go to a store and they have one on display you might be able to get it from that. I think the serial number is ok the box somewhere too.

It is very important that you get a serial from an iPod that is under 1 year old! 

.:Step 2:.
Open up your browser and paste in this URL
http://depot.info.apple.com/ipod/
It will bring you to the page where you enter the serial number. After this page it should be pretty self explanitory.  
You will need to register with Apple support if you don't already have an account.  It doesn't take long and you don't need a credit card or anything.

After you complete the above step an email will be sent to you with a tracking number.

It usually takes about 2 days for Apple to ship the product to your door.  They are really speedy :)
You can use the same serial number after the product you ordered has been shipped so you can still get a ton of stuff with just 1 serial, it will just take
longer.
