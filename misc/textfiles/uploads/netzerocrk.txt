  dearest Jason:
Greetings once again! I noticed the Netzero crack you have on the
uploads page and it is nice!  BUT.....I'm an avid programmer and I am
always in search of a better, more conveniant way of doing something, as
such as in the ways of the ol'  bbs's. ( I'm 21, but I do remember 'em
slightly.)  So...... here you go. the BEST way of cracking netzero, as
of july 26 2000.
straight up.

Peace,

c0de-kid

                                       Cracking Netzero

I am not responsible for any misuse of this information for illegal

banner ads to support them. Free Internet access is great, don't abuse
it. Get their stuff at http://www.netzero.com


INTRODUCTION:
=============
What up. So you like free PPP access? Well, there are some great
programs out there that offer free dialup access at the expense of
showing you annoying banner ads on your screen that may even
remain visible during graphics such as playign a nice game of
StarCraft - which you can not do while using NetZero (one of these
dialup services) since their banner interferes with the game. The
banner doesn't only take up space on your screen, but also takes up
bandwidth and can lag you.

THE CRACK:
==========
A basic knowledge of dos comands is helpful, but in all reality if you
HONESTLY can't do it, e-mail me    (boyDJ@angelfire.com)

It's Very simple.
1) GO INTO MS-DOS
2) GO INTO THE DIRECTORY NETZERO
CD C:\PROGRA~1\NETZERO
3) GO INTO THE SUB DIRECTORY BIN
CD C:\PROGRA~1\NETZERO\BIN
4)type  EDIT JPEG.DLL
5) HIGHLIGHT ALL THE FUNNY TEXT SYMBOLS IN THE FILE - THAT IS, IF
THE DOS EDITOR HAD A SELECT ALL FEATURE, YOU WOULD DO THAT. BUT IT
DOES NOT SO JUST SELECT ALL THE TEXT WITH YOUR MOUSE.
6) HIT DELETE TO ERASE ALL THE TEXT IN THE FILE
7) SAVE THE FILE HIT ALT-S
8) EXIT AND TYPE DIR
THE FILE'S SIZE SHOULD NOW BE 0

Thats it. Exit the MS-DOS screen and run NetZero. Connect like normal
and
when the connection is completed, the dial-up screen will go away
and no banner will pop up. Instead you have 100% free dial-up and
no annoying banner ads or banner lag. Merry Christmas! @ Have fun
kiddees!


peace the f&@#! out.........
