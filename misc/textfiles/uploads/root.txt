In this text I'll tell you things that your root can and maybe 
is doing on you know and ways that you
can stop the root from doing them.Also I'll tell  you
how to become a friend with your root and one

so be sure because most of the roots are always monitoring if they're not
stupid or lazy.

1.What a root can do to you?

Well when someone is root is on some system he/she
can do EVERYTHING on the system and the users.
As you see ALL of your traffic conversations and so on
can be captured because they all goes through the
network.
The root can sniff your ICQ messages because they're
all send in plain text,IRC messages
also the root can see which sites you're on
which sites you visit most,read your e-mail 
sniff your passwords
basically everything that you do when you're
online.Also the root may see if you're port scanning
another host,also check you're trying to send
spoofed packets and of course the pop3 users.
When someone start checking 1 e-mail account
from 2 different accounts the root will start
monitoring him closer.
Well basicly anyone with proper level of access to 
TCP/IP packets can get any packet on the net and read what's in.
It also can be done in a Windows,Mac and Unix system.
 As you all see if someone like you interested
in hacking this is REALLY bad thing but be sure
a lot of roots are doing it for the security of
their systems.

2.This is one story about me and the root from the ISP I left

Well I contacted one friend about giving me shell on his
server via unencrypted e-mail and he said he'll send me the
user the pass via e-mail.I didn't know that my root was
monitoring me.So I received the e-mail with subject:
"Password" and of course there was my password.
I used the shell 2 times for some work and on the other
day I received e-mail from my friend saying that
I entered 3 times and the third one was from
root@myisp.com!!!!!!
I didn't know what to say.He asked me if I was root
at the server,and of course I told him I wasn't.
He cheked closer and noticed that the root of one
of the servers of my network was there the previous night.
Then I told him that I think my root took me my password
and I asked him what was he doing on the server.
He said that he went to all of my directories
copied some texts and other things and
tried the su command with password:hacker
Lame heh.
There was no other thing that might happened.My root
read my e-mail saw the password and entered to see
what's there.
I was thinking why would the root monitor exactly me and not
someone else.Check out the next section and you'll understand.

3.When the root will start monitoring you?

Later I realized that if I was root I'll also
start monitoring someone like me.
The ISP was not so big with not so much
clients I mean.I was making a lot of traffic
receiving a lot of e-mails from various
mailing lists,sending and receiving big
e-mail and always staying more than the time
I have.Every root that is a little paranoid
will ask himself what is this guy doing so much
receiving so much e-mails and sending big one,
staying so long online not as the other users.
And of course the root will start monitoring you.
Also if he/she start checking from where you're 
receiving e-mails and if he find something like
hacker@security.org be sure he/she will start
monitoring all of your traffic.

4.How you can check if the root is monitoring you?

You may be interested is your root monitoring you
Well here's something you can try.I tried this on
the root that once get my password and it works again.

Tell someone but via the phone(remember you're not sure if the root is monitoring you)
to send you an e-mail with subject like "PASSWORDS" "HACKING" "EXPLOITS FOR yourISP"
and something that you take the root's attention.
Then of course inside should be user name and password for some server.
Also it would be AWESOME if you add something like that
"Hey dude I trust you and I won't keep any logs of you
so you can enter whenever you want and do whatever you want I trust you"
This will make your root think he's secure and won't be traced and he'll
have the chance to look what's there also try to add something in the
e-mail like
"Hey when you start smurfing or ping flooding something be sure he's someone
that won't understand what's going on because I don't want problems
Also when you exploit some site remove yourself from the logs"
and "I left you some expoits that you wanted for your ISP in the /home/hacker dir"

This will make your root go there and check immediately what's going down
because your friend said that there are some exploits for your ISP.
Of course the server will keep logs of everything and if your root
is monitoring you you'll get him caught.

5.How to protect?

Well you may ask how can I protect myself from such roots
and do my work without being watched?
There's one word that will help you:Encryption
You should encrypt EVERYTHING  your telnet sessions
with Secure Shell,your ICQ conversations with ICQ
secret messanger,your e-mails with PGP and so on.
This will keep your root away from your messages
and conversations.Also your root may log what
you're typing and sending.Let's say the root
is logging for words like "hacker" "exploit"
"password" "hack" and so on.Well can stop that
by starting to type these and other words you think
your root is logging in a different ways.
LIke "hacker" into a h4cker or {hacker}
"exploit" into an 3xploit or <exploit>.
In this way you'll again be sure the root
can't trace you.But don't type the words
as seen here be creative,and remember
encrypt everything.

6.Ways to prevent your root from monitoring you

The best thing you can do is to become a friend
with your root and start helping him and make him 
think you're useful for the ISP's security.
In this way you can be sure that your root will
not monitor you and who knows he/she may give you
the root's pass sometime.
First you must prove to your root that you can
be useful.The best way is to break the server
several times and then of course tell the root
how you've breaked it and tell him how to patch the bug.
If you do this your root will start trusting you
and as I told you give you the root's pass some time.
Then you're able to do EVERYTHING with the system.
For the evil people this is way to deface a website.

These methods are working I've tried them and I'm now
friend with my root.He didn't gave me the root's 
password but when he give it to me...............

Think whatever you want :-)

7.Terms in this text

Here I'll try to explain the different terms in 
this paper.

7.1.Sniffing

In the normal network accounts and passwords are
send in plain text it's not hard for the root
to just "sniff"(look into)the packets and
find out the things there.Admins and other
people often use sniffin either for security
purposes or to see what's going through their network.

7.2.Root

For those of you that don't know a root is
the user of the system that can do EVERYTHING
on it.The root has FULL access to everything on
a system and can make whatever he/she wants with it.

8.Final Words

I hope you like this text and now you know what a root can do
to you so be a little paranoid.
