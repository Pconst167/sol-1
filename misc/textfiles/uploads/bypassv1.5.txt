================================================

Written by Optica V on July 13, 2000

*Updates:

- Strategy for bypassing bookstores was tested and verified.  The strategy was successful.   

- Strategy for bypassing bookstores has added techniques and has been improved for higher success rate.

- Strategy for CD stores has been completely revised.

- Added some other stuff, you'll see it

**Disclaimer Thingy:

I hate long disclaimers so I'll put this in more simpler terms.  What ever you do that relates to this knowledge and text is strictly for educatinal purposes.  I have no reponsibility for whatever bad thing you do.  So if you try anything and get in trouble.  It's your own fault.  Besides, it was your decision to make the attempt.

It gives you an excellent overview and explanation about the EAS Anti-Shoplifting systems as well as other contemporary devices and techniques that the industry uses today.  This will help you out a lot.  Trust me.  You might even come up with your own bypassing techniques.

After you've done that, read on...

1) The EAS Systems 

There are three types of EAS systems.  The one that I am concerned with talking about are the "acusto-magnetic" systems.  This is the third type.  You should already have a thorough understanding about how they work.  Setting the alarm is rather easy by going through the system with mechandise that hasn't been "deactivated" by the scanners.  Let me give you a short overview on the ways you can set the alarm. 

First, the AM material or magentic "stuff", if you will, can be detected.  This material is sometimes hidden IN the merchandise.  Like for instance, on CDS it's contained in a plastic covering (usually white) on the back.  Or for books, its well hidden between the pages or on the inside front or back covers(along with the plastic covering).  Sometimes, the AM material would be a long piece(like long strips of magnesium)taped somewhere.  This may be difficult to find, especially in big books.  Another thing, sometimes theres a "secondary UPC" code tag.  This secondary tag usually a sticker UPC hidden within.  They USUALLY use this with books and bigger books making them difficult to take.  

2) Safety First 

Alright, What I have are experimental procedures on bypassing the system.  SO, I may not be fully correct on my theories.  BUT, if you happen to have any suggestions or corrections etc, by all means, tell me.  I'll be glad to credit you in my texts.  My ICQ is at the bottom of this file.

Anyways, about safety.  There are many different stores with the acusto-magnetic systems.  And depending on what your going to "take", procedures matter a lot.  I mean the way you're going to carry out the task.  You may want to carry with you a pocket knife or some sharp item like a razor or something.  Don't forget there are sometimes security cameras.  And to get anything from stores like that may take some higher skill.  It's easier if you do this in stores without the cameras.  The most easy place to probably steal with the EAS systems is the mall.  The next section will introduce some example stores and how to "permanently borrow"(har har) their merchandise.  

3) Procedures 

+++ Acusto-Magnetic Systems +++

A: Bookstores *Barnes and Noble, Waldenbooks etc*

I put this first because I thought it was was easier.  If you're going to get really thick books or maybe ANY book, it's a good idea to bring a bookbag pretending your there to do school work or the like(I always see this at B&N).  That way when you go through the bypassing procedure you can put it in your bookbag or whatever and walkout.  Maybe, you can dress up in some snazzy tux or suit with a briefcase(a big one) and look professional like you work for some big corporation so no one will question you, i dunno. 

Strategy -

Find a book you want or a book you want to test and go to some place in the store where you know you'll be able to do your "handywork" in private.  FIRST, you have to carefully check all contents.  Check the inside for AM material and secondary UPC code.  Check each page... inbetween... THOROUGHLY.  I can't stress that enough.  It's important because it could be well hidden sometimes and you may end up missing it, even when you scan it the second time.  For your safety, check the book over and over at least twice to reassure yourself.  If you do happen to find AM material, try cutting or whatever means to remove it COMPLETELY.  After doing so, toss it somewhere so that it's no where near you, like behind the other stacks of books next to you or if you're in the bathroom, flush it or throw it away.  Just throw it away.  Make sure its nowhere near you.  If you find a secondary UPC sticker inside, just throw it away too.  Now, all that done.  Ok, so a brief synopsis.  You got you're AM Material disposed of(if any), and you got the secondary UPC taken care of also.  Last, you have to remove the Main UPC on the back of the book by either scratching it out completely or cutting it out. Here is a technique for cutting it out.  Make sure you bring a pocket knife or razor.  Now, you can do this however way you like, either cutting it all out or just some so that there are no markings.  If you're not going to cut it all 
then continue...  Make a slit so that it dosen't go through all the way.  Then try lifting up the paper so that you can rip it off.  Either way, no biggie of a diffy.

NOTE:  This strategy works.  Its been tested at B&N.  Waldenbooks uses the AM Material MOST of the time.  You can apply the same strategy to that as well.

B: CD Stores *The Wall, Blockbuster Music, Camelot, etc.*

Im not sure if any of the CD stores have cameras.  But whatever you do, always watch out for people and employees because some of the stores are kinda small which increases the risk of being caught.  This may be very difficult and time consuming so think about what you're going to be doing.  You might not need a bag for this.  You can if you want.  But if you have any other ideal place or item which is not liable for questioning or suspicion, then feel free to use it(use your logic, always). 

Some CDS are packaged differently.  Some have the hardcase all over and some are completely in cardboard.  So meaning, cardboard easy and hardcase more difficult.
I'll explain more in the strat if needed.

Strategy - 

There are things here that I'm not so sure about.  It's about the main UPC.  It's contained within the hardcase on the back.  The main UPC can be anywhere on the back(sideways or something):

You're going to have to find some way of getting that.  But I'm not sure if you have to.  I've been told that some people bypassed without removal of the main UPC.  But you can remove it if want to be safe.  It's a lot of trouble in my opinion but feel free to verify.  I'll write the theoretical procedure anyways.

Before getting to the 2nd UPC.  Let's talk about getting to the main upc.  Somehow we have to get inside.  Like I said, its either contained in a hardcase or on cardboard. Try getting a really sharp and pointed(but small)object like razor or knife, and digging into the area of the main UPC.  If its cardboord, it shouldn't give you too much trouble.  Just cut it out carefully.  For the hardcase.  I haven't written anything specific yet.

Remove the secondary UPC on the plastic covering.  What you can do so that it won't make so much noise is cut open one the edges and slip the cd case through.  Hide the covering somewhere like behind the stacks of other cds.  Again, don't be careless and put the thing in your pocket(you're smart enough to know that).  

Short but extremely difficult if you follow that procedure.  

C: FOOD *Farm Fresh, Food Lion etc.*

I don't even know why I put this here put here...

Strategy -

If there just dosent seem to be any way of exiting the store without going through some scanners then follow this.

There is no way that they would put AM material in food packages.  SO just remove the UPC that is there. Sometimes it's a good idea, sometimes it's not.  Depends on what food you want. Make sure no one sees you.  heh :)

========
Last words...

There are some other stores that have a much higher security watch.  For example,  "BEST BUY".  Not only are there anti-shoplifting systems.  But they've got a satisfactory camera surveliance system all over the store.  Near the entrance/exit and cashiers there is a camera and monitor where one person can control a cameraand view almost every part of the store.  These are just a few of the security techniques they use and there may be more.  Usually, there are many employees around the place which is also a slight problem.  Attempting to successfully avoid the security systems such as these are very difficult and provide a vere rare success rate.  I hope to find more information on evasion and the like.  I will update as necessary over time.
