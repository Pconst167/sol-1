  What it does
----------------

The BuZZ b0X iz a simple box that annoys the hell outa your "friends" on the
other end!
Were not quite sure how it works, but what the hell? So, lets make this
bitch!.

  What ya need
----------------
(1) fone cord 
(1) wire stripper
(1) pair of syzzors
(1) roll of electrial tape
(1) buzzer from ratshack---the smaller the better(if you dont have any cash,
use the 5-phinger discount!)
(1) momentary push button swich(you press it...it opens the circut...you stop
pressing it...it closes it---optional, but very helpful)


  How ya make this bastard
----------------------------
Take the fone cord and cut of 1 (thats right, 1, O-N-E, 1) of the plastic ends
with your sissors.  Now, take your wire stripper and strip off about an inch
of insulation off of the red and the green wires.  Now, hook up the wires from
the fone cord to the wires from the buzzer (i dont think it matters which
wires, just swich them if it dosent work) and if u have the optional push
switch, then hook it up (if you dont know how, then you should NOT be reading
this)

 How to use your BuZZ b0X
-------------------------
When ya have an unspecting victim, just hook this up or just push the switch!
Have phun and dont get caught! =-= 
Happy Phreaking- ^IcEy^
oh yeah, and DiGiT
