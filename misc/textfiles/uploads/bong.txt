Making Your Very Own Bong That You Can ReUse
		By PHiSH

Making a Bong is really easy... :)

Materials Needed:
1: 1/4" aluminum tubing (that's 1/4" on the outside... not the inside)
   (Make sure this is ALUMINUM tubing an NOT COPPER, Heating copper tubing
   and inhaling the fumes can kill you!!)	
2: Glass Bottle with fitting lid or double holed stopper (holes must be 1/4")
3: Drill + 1/4" Drill Bit  OR  1/4" punch
4: 1/4" Socket for a Socket Wrench, best to use the biggest size you can
   find that still fit's the 1/4" wrench 
5: Fine screen, like the one you'd use in a pipe, available at most
   bong/pipe selling stores
 
Procedure:
1: Drill two 1/4" holes in the lid
2: Cut about 4" (depending on the size of your bong) of Al. tubing
3: Curve the 4"'s os tubing to 90 degrees
4: Put the lid with the holes onto the glass bottle
5: Put the 4" Curved piece of tubing into one of the holes
6: Straighten the rest of the tubing and put it into the other hole
7: Slide the big piece of tubing all the way down so it touches the bottom
8: Curve the bottom of the Big piece just a tad
9: Cut the top of the big peice of tubing about 1" or 2" above the cap
10: Put the screen in the big side socket
11: Put the socket on the end of the big tube
12: Pull the tube assembly out of the bottle and fill the bottle about
    half full with water
13: Obtain some Marijuana and smoke it
