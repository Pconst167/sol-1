Ok, one day during the  lunch period we're sitting outside playing with the phones when suddenly we notice that one of the phones sounds a bit full of money. So we started dialing numbers and it wouldn't dial for some reason so my friend mÿnk decides to kic where the hopper is that keeps the money. So KABAM slot machine sounds start coming out of the phone and out comes $10 in quarters. so we decide to see waht would happen if we put a quarter in and ejected it and WHAMMO out comes another $10.

Lesson:If the hopper sounds full kick the shit out of the payphone

(Needless to say, a few authority figures weren't too happy)

BTW if this ever happens at your school exploit it as much as possible.
