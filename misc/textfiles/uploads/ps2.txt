Play Burned Games WITHOUT Mod!  PS2 Written by SHEER BLACK

Before you can use a Gameshark2 to play backed up games, you need to 
meet a few criteria. First, you have to use a GS2 v2 or lower. GS2 v3 
automated ejecting the cd tray to combat this flaw. Second, you need to 
use some type of swap method. This proceedure will allow you to play 
backed up games without a modchip, but you still have to do a little 
work. And finally third, this method has only been tested on versions 1, 
2, 4, and 5 of PS2's. I cannot vouche if this method works on newer models.

1) Boot up your PS2 with the GS2 CD.
* if you are playing a CD type game, skip to step 4 *

2) Eject the GS2 CD and insert an authentic PS2 DVD game.

3) Wait appx. 15-20 seconds for the PS2 to recognize the authentic game.

4) On the main menu, select to start the game without codes and hit X. 
The disc will stop to spin, and the GS2 will ask for you to insert the game.

5) DO NOT PRESS EJECT. Instead, use whatever swap method you prefer to 
insert your backed up game.

6) Hit X to start, and if done correctly, the game will load up without 
the use of a modchip!

7) You can play PS1 games using this same method if you have the GS2 PSX 
Archive CD.
