THE STALKER
BY: DIzzIE

I bathe in the blood of your unborn child
The demon inside me has really gone wild

I blow up the Town Hall
And then go stalking at the local shopping mall

I find a target
Her name is Mrs.Margret

I follow her to the shoe department
And then I go to her apartment

I hit her with a baseball bat 
And then I skin her little cat

I poke Mrs.Margret with poisoned darts
And I chop her into little parts

I put the pieces around the house
As I eat a juicy mouse

I hide in the attic
Because here comes Pattic

He is the son of Mrs.Margret
Now he is the new target

I creep behind him holding gasoline
Not to be confused with kerosene

Now he is on fire
And I have almost fulfilled my desire

Now Mr.Margret comes home
He sees his family dead in his home

He silently gets a knife and puts it to his throat
Then he lies in his blood, moaning like a goat

I bathe in the blood of his unborn child
The demon inside me has really gone wild
