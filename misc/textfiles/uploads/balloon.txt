MAGIC BALLOON 
BY: DIzzIE Ó2000

Here is a nice fun activity for you to do on a boring day, any day in fact. What you need is one of those big  plastic garbage bags. Next you also need access to a high place, such as a roof. Then you need to fill the garbage bag with as much vile liquid, or semi-liquid, as you can, without breaking the baggie, not yet at least. Some suggested items to put in the baggie are: excrement, piss, honey, soda, vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, alcohol, pickle juice, boiled eggs, hot sauce, oil, and on… Then just close the bag, get on top of the roof, wait for a big crowd of well-dressed people to pass, and let your magic balloon drop.
