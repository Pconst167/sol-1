Ok, so you have a program you like but its only a demo. You can use it for seven days and thats it! You have looked for cracks and cant find anything. In this sweet text I'm going to teach you how to hack it yourself.


Lets say the demo starts on January 31 and ends on January 38. First thing you do is uninstall the program. Then set your clock back seven days. The final step is to reinstall the program and BAM! Works like new!
