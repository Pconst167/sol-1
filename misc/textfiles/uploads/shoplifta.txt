This one is real easy!  Just go into a store with no cameras [most 
stores in your local

mall shouldn't] while wearing a book bag.  If the cash register is in 
the front of the

store, go to the back and put whatever you want in your bag.  If its a 
clothing store,

pick up a bunch of clothes [50% clothes that you will not buy and 50% 
clothes that

you are going to take] and try to hide the clothes that you will take 
so nothing wont

look suspicious.  Go into a fitting room and stuff the clothes that you 
want in your

bag.  Walk out with some clothes from the store on and be nice with the 
workers.

Say something like "Does this look good on me?  What sizes do you sell? 
  Do you

have a website?"  End off the conversation by saying "Do you sell any 
clothing for

kids [or teens] [or adults (only if you are a teen)]?" "Oh really, well 
ill be stopping by

later today" "Have a nice day!".


I HAVE NEVER DONT THIS NOR WILL I EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

SHOPLIFTING CAN GET YOU INTO SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE!
