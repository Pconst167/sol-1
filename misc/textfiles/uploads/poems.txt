Death of a Dark Genius
----------------------

This hate I feel
This burning pain
Rage against the world
My minds-eye goes insane

I look around me
I am powerless
I see hurt and death
Life seems so useless

It grabs me hard
Uses my soul 
Throws my body
Into a black hole......

Called Death........

Sedate
------

Lovely pain
Hard hate 
Kill it away
Coldly sedate

Love thy neiborgh
Fuck thy lord
Gonna break it down
Gonna kill some more

As I lay here 
And I wait
The world is burning outside
Time to sedate

============

Used
----

People have been used
Iv'e been lied to
And abused

I try and struggle through
Hoping to see a light
Only to find
Another long fight

I will make it
Out of this tunnle
But it seems the only way
Is to struggle and struggle

-Shadow Wolf
============

Tired
-----

Worn down
Mind clogged
Sight blured
Thoughts bogged

Chest heavy
Fingers slow
Ears ringing
Time to go

============

Aggressor
---------
Fuled by rage	
Driven by hate	
Fear of nothing	
Aggresion for everything........

-Shadow Wolf
============

Zero
----
The blood from my veins
All dry and drained
The sirens in my head
All loud and strained

I'm at my end
Zero is the number
Down I slide
Into a deep slumber.....

-Shadow Wolf
============

Missing You
-----------
I love the way you love me
But I hate the way
That I do
Catch myself, missing you

-Shadow Wolf
============

Sinner
------
The forbiden fruits
Are the ones I devourer
The hidden pleasures
I explore by the hour

-Shadow Wolf
============

Slain
-----
I will kill you slowly
Tourture your soul
Slay you body
And murder you whole

-Shadow Wolf
============

Mind Kill
---------
Can you feel it?
The surge of pain
The very thing
That drives me insane

My hatred deludes me
My fear drives me
My mind is killing me
It's my own worst enemy

-Shadow Wolf
============

Unrest
------
I'm broken
And I'm bruised
Iv'e been metaly abused

Deep grey matter scars
Are drown out by the screams
My mind will never rest
Not even in my dreams
