                SALT WATER METHOD
           Take a 2 liter and fill it up with a cup of salt and the
     rest fill up with water. Make a funnel with rolled up newspaper
     or buy one. (*Actually you sould not buy one just make one*)
     Put the funnel in the coin slot and slowly pour it down and
     the mechine sould start to spary out soda and money. If it does
     not you did something wrong. One final note, MAKE SURE NO ONE
     IS AROUND WHEN YOU DO IT.

                HOLE IN A QUARTER METHOD
           You need a quarter, a drill, and some good strong string.
     Take the drill and drill a small hole just big enough for the
     string to go in. Tie the string as thight as you can get it.
     When you go up to the mechine make sure no one is looking and
     tie the string to your finger and put the quarter just far
     enough for the mechine to take it and yank it out. If the
     string breaks oh well it's just a quarter.

                CLAY METHOD
           This is the best method when it works. Take a lump of
     clay and force it in the holes as far as you can then take it
     out and let it dry overnight.  Put it back in and turn and you
     sould get the door open so you can steal the soda and money.
     Make sure no one sees you and if they do close and lock the
     mechine, stomp the clay to dust and run.

                COMPUTER STORE MATHOD
           This is also a good method but theres more of a paper
     trail. Just walk into a computer store and say you lost your
     key and would like an replacement. The key to the computer
     sould fit into the vending mechine as well.

                GUM/TAPE METHOD
           Put a peice of gum of tape in the pack of those 25c
     mechines then firmly put the quarter in. When you turn it you
     sould get a gum ball of whatever and your quarter will still be
     there.

                BENDIND THE MECHINE OVER METHOD
           Simple. But on this one you sould bring a friend along
     to help make sure the mechine don't fall and kill you. Lean the
     mechine over and shake up and down as hard as you can. If they
     don't already fall out then reach your hand up the mechine as
     your friend holds it up.

                STEAL OTHERS CHANGE METHOD
           This is a good way to get maybe five extra bucks every
     two days or so depending on how many people go to that mechine.
     Take a brown bag from a store (plastic also works) and tape it
     up in the coin slot so it cannot be seen and in a couple of
     days come back and take it out. You sould have at least a
     dollar.
