how to make a pop can launcher


i want to make this but i haven't so i don't know how safe it is or 
dangerous


1, 12 pack of mountain dew (or something you like if you get thirsty)
3, campbell soup cans these will work best
1, roll of duct tape or
1, welder
some fuse or insence sticks or wicks anything you like
some butane fuel
1, drill

duct tape the soup cans together taking off the top and bottom of 2 of
them and only the top of one can.  then drill a hole in the area you want
your fuse put some but not to much butane fuel in ther.  put the pop can
in from the top. set on the ground at 45 light and run cuz it could blow
up and hurt you. or it could send that pop can really far.  yea maybe you
could soak the pop can in lighter fluid and it would be lit on fire and
you would have a flaming can.
