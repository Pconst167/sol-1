I will explain to you how to make a pipebomb with wires and a battery. 
I find these era of pipe bombs to be the safest, and easiest to make. 
Please do not try this at home. It is against the Law in most 
countries.

Materials that you will need.

1. 1" threaded pvc pipe about 1 foot long
2. 2 threaded pvc caps that will fit the pvc pipe
3. Duct Tape
4. Model Rocket Engine Igniter
5. 12 volt battery
6. 100 feet of copper wire
7. Drill or Icepick
8. Black Powder or Flash Powder


How to make the pipe bomb


First Take one of your two pvc caps, and cap one end of the pvc pipe. 
Now take your other cap, and drill or poke a hole in it. Be sure it is 
a smooth hole, not ruff. Now you may pour your black powder or flash 
powder down the pvc pipe. Pour as much as you want. But I recomend you 
filling it as close to the top as possible. Now take your Model Rocket 
Engine Igniter and stick the end that comes together into the pvc cap 
hole. Now you may tape the igniter in place. Remember that you must 
leave the two igniter wires sticking out so you may use them later in 
the process. Take your pvc cap, and put it on the pvc pipe. Duct tape 
it Compleatly together. Tape it as tight as possible. Now go outside 
with your 12 volt battery, and 100 feet of copper wire. Now take your 
100 feet of copper wire out, and cut it in half. Now take one wire and 
connect it to one igniter wire. Then take the other wire and connect it 
to the other igniter wire. DO NOT LET THE OTHER ENDS OF THE WIRES TOUCH 
THE BATTERY!!! Now go as far as you can with the wires. Sit on the 
ground, and connect both wires to the battery. Wait 1 second, and 
BOOM!! You have just made an electronic pipe bomb.



I never make pipe bombs any other way. I find this to be a very safe 
meathod. It's better than Blowing your hand off trying to light a fast 
burning fuse.
