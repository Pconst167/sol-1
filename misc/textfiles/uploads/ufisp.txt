A.  Version Timeline

Version 1.01 - "Universal" guide created.  Combines all 4 PPP guides to Juno,
NetZero, Spinway, and 1stUp that I created eariler this month along with how 
to configure most Free ISPs on a PPP connection, newfound PPP information, and
some answers to your questions.

Version 1.0A, 1.0B, 1.0C, 1.0D - How to Use your Free ISP on a PPP connection
(A = Juno, B = NetZero, C = Spinway, D = 1stUp.  Originally Separate guides.


B.  The story behind this guide

     Getting online was always a hassle with most "Free" Internet Services.
     They plague you with constant banner ads, the  software slows your machine
     and connection down massively, and they annoy me greatly.  Well, after 
     dealing with this for over 6 months, and seeing one of my favorite Free ISP
     services, FreeWWWeb, consumed completely by the evil known as Juno I got
     angry and decided to look for some patches to deal with this.  My results
     weren't too good, most of the patches were version precise and half of the
     time didn't work.
     When I put on a program that came with a new modem I had, it came with some
     software that logged all of the Modem information that was sent and received
     during the logging process.  Then, I came up with the idea that led me to
     discovering how to connect to these services without using any additional
     software than Dial Up Networking or whatever you use to get a PPP connection
     with your modem.  After poking around in these log files and some windows
     settings, I found how to do it.


C.  Free ISP setup on a PPP connection

    1. Finding your username and password

     Now before you can begin this you will need the following.
          1.  A Winblows computer (95/98/ME/NT/2000 mainly, GNU/Linux, BSD,
              and MacOS users please refer to section D)
          2.  TCP/IP and Dial Up Adapter setup (check this by selecting the
              Networking Option in the Control Panel)
          3.  A Modem (DUH!!!)
          4.  A Free ISP setup with your account working (DUH #2!!!)

     Now comes the central howto on this.
          1.  Go into Dial Up Networking, right-click on the connection linked
              to your Free ISP and select properties.
              Select the Server Types Tab, and make sure "Log onto Network" 
              is selected.
          2.  Go into the Control Panel and Select Networking.  Click on Dial-Up
              Adapter and hit the properties button.
              Change the Option "Record to Log file" to Yes and restart your
              computer.
          3.  After restarting, connect to your Free ISP using the software.
              After the connection is established, terminate the connection,
              close the software and never use it again.  DO NOT DELETE THE
              SOFTWARE.
          4.  Go into the Run Option by going Start--->Run and type in 
              "C:\windows\ppplog.txt" to open up the PPP log.
          5.  Look for the following.
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - PPP : Transmitting Control Packet of length: 50
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0000: c0 23 01 02 00 30 18 65 | .#...0#
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0008: 6d 69 73 73 61 72 79 68 | ########
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0010: 61 40 61 6c 74 61 76 69 | ########
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0018: 73 74 61 2e 6e 65 74 12 | #######.
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0020: 39 41 37 39 36 39 30 33 | ########
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0028: 32 38 32 32 30 36 31 31 | ########
               10-12-2000 21:46:01.45 - Data 0030: 37 46 00 00 00 00 00 00 | ##......
          6.  Now, let me decrypt what this is.  Now, you can disregard the dates,
              times, and Data packet info.  What you will want to look at is the
              information after the vertical line (|).  From here you will see 
              your username and password.  The first series of # is where your
              username are and the second series of # are your password.  They
              are always separated by a period from what I have seen.  Each ISP
              has a different way of show this but there are some common
              characteristics.
          7.  Once you have your username and password, you are ready to rock.
              Setup a new Dial Up connection in Dial Up Networking and put in
              your respective Dial Up Number.  After the connection has been 
              setup.  Double-Click on the connection, put in your 
              username/password and connect!
          Note:  Notice that the passwords are encrypted.  That is how they have
                 foiled you from getting on there with any PPP software

     2.  Exact ISP info

     As I have said, each ISP works a differnet way and are confusing.  I don't
     have all of the Free ISPs on here, but I do have the 4 major ones figured
     out right now.  If you have info about certain Free ISPs that I don't, 
     please send it in to help me with my research.  If I find that your
     information is true then I will put it in and put you in a Credits Section.
     (I don't have one right now as this was just made.)  Now, onto the info

          a.  Juno - Now, this is actually one of those ISPs which I haven't
              tried this, rather I found another way of finding the info you
              need.  This has been taken directly from the original Juno guide
              I made.

               1.  Install Juno (you have to in order to get this to work)
               2.  Find out your number and set up the program.
               3.  After connecting and confirming that it works, close Juno
                   and NEVER use it again.
               4.  Go to Dial Up Networking and Open up Juno Web, put your 
                   username in if it already isn't listed.
               5.  Open up C:\windows\juno.ini (or do a search for juno.ini 
                   depending on which version of the software you have.)
               6.  In there is your encrypted password, which is how they
                   have foiled most attempts to connect with PPP software other
                   than their shit, UNTIL NOW!
               7.  Copy and Paste that password over to your DUN connection.
               8.  Connect!

          b.  NetZero - The username is usually 3.0.4:username@netzero.net and
              the password is a password that begins with 0 and ends with 1.
              The 3.0.4 before your username is the version of the software
              that you use so it may be different with whatever software you
              use, however the login will work with no problem.

          c.  Spinway - The username is 030username@mpspinway followed by the
              password.  I don't know if the password has a particular pattern
              on here.  It was 8 characters for me so if anybody can help on this
              it would be appreciated.

          d.  1stUp - The username is username@########.net (the # is whatever 
              the name your ISP is that runs from the 1stup servers.  More on
              that in Section E.


D.  Using Free ISPs on non-Winblows systems

     Now, I know that there are many people who will want to use these ISPs on
     GNU/Linux, BSD, MacOS, Solaris, and any other Operating System that you can
     think of.  In order to use them, you have to figure our your username and
     password.  So you will need to use Winblows for that.  However, once you
     have figured these out, just put in your access number, username, and
     password to use it with your OS's PPP software.  Well, atleast you will
     be able to use Free ISPs on GNU/Linux now.  This has been tested by some
     of the buddies in the §X crew.  I look forward to this once I get a new
     hard drive and Linux.


E.  FAQ U

Q.  Who are Spinway and 1stUp and why didn't you cover AltaVista, NBCi, XOOM, etc.?
A.  Spinway and 1stUp are services that allow for companies to get the right to
    slap on their own name and custom stuff into the software and send you ads
    that they profit from.  They charge these companies cash to put their name
    on the service to make it seem like that that companies like AltaVista have
    their own ISP, when in reality it is 1stUp's server.  To find out if your
    ISP falls into this go into Dial Up Networking and look for your ISP name,
    if you see another name for it then it falls into this category.  One thing
    that bothers me about this is that 1stUp has made it so that they require
    that you use the company's E-Mail and Password which probably is a headache
    in itself to setup for them.  It also makes it hard for this guide to give
    better instructions about usernames and passwords on it.

Q.  I need to E-Mail you a question or some information?  How do I contact you?
A.  My E-Mail is amp@soldierx.com.  Please check the newest version of the guide
    to see if your question is covered before you consider E-Mailing me.
