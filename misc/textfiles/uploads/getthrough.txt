i am  jockey,  and  this is my text file.  i have compiled various
things i have leaned into one textfile.  it has been appropriately
named get through life txt.  i have no real catagory for this,  as
it contains some hacking, some anarchy, some phreaking, etc.

1.1. - //anarchy::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::	

hindenburg explosive
 	
materials
 liquid plumber
 soda bottle
 aluminum foil
 balloon
 3' fuse

pocedure
1. fill about 3/4 of the  bottle with liquid plumber
2. drop a decent sized chunk of aluminumfoil  into the liquid.  
3. quickly put the balloon over the neck of the  bottle and let it 
   fill with the hydrogen gas given off from the chemical reaction 
   of the aluminum and liquid plumber. 
4. when its nearly full take it off and knot the balloon.  
5. tie the fuse around the balloon and light it, let go and watch. 



1.2. - //theft::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

nearly every vending machine today has a dollar slot. because they
cost somewhere between 65 and 80 cents, if the buyer uses a dollar 
they will get  between 20 and 35  cents back.  if you were to take 
all of their change, from every person, every day for a month, you 
could have a decent ammonut of spending money. 

step 1: your target 
your target for this should be a machine with the lowest  cost and 
a working dollar slot. 

step 2: setup
i wouldnt consider  this completely legal...  so  don't get caught 
setting this up. you need two items: a plastic bag and a fork. 

bend the for into this position

(before)      _______________ 
                             \_____

(after)       _______________   .
                             \__|

if there is a coin return door, i would suggest ripping it off, as 
it will make this a pain in the ass to do.  now,  take the bag and 
jam it into  the coin return,  using the fork as  a pushing  tool. 

BE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT NO FINGERS CAN REACH IT. 

step 3: wait. 
lets do some simple math. 
lets say you use a 65 cent machine,  and 30 people buy sodas using 
a  dollar bill  that day.  if you put the bag to  block the change 
from comming down, you will get 0.65 x 30, which is $19.50. 

do this  for a week,  checking  it each night,  you have  19.5 x 7 
which is $136.50. pulling this off for a month is 136.5 x 30 which 
is a decent $4095.00.  not bad pocket  change if you  ask me. with 
this you can be making over $49,000 a year. 

step 4: retrieval
jam the  fork back up,  until you hit the bag,  pull it forward so 
the pointy things hit the bag and slide it out,  you should be met 
with a mound of change. 

if you are caught doing this,  just say the  damn thing  ate  your 
change and you were trying to get it back. 


1.3. - //phreaking::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

red box

red boxing is the act of simulating the tones produced when  coins 
are deposited in a pay phone.  this can be used for  free calls or 
free money.  coin tones are beeps of 2200 Hz + 1700 Hz as follows:

5 cents - 
 1 beep, 66 millisecond duration.

10 cents - 
 2 beeps, 66 millisecond duration. 
 66 millisecond pauses between each.

25 cents - 
 5 beeps, 33 millisecond duration.
 33 millisecond pause between beeps.

two methods  have commonly been  used to produce  these  tones and 
make free calls.

1. the  traditional red box  consisting of a  pair of  wien-bridge 
oscillators with the timing controlled by 555 timer chips.

2. producing the signals with a  mirco cassette recorder which are 
recorded and then played back into the mouth piece of a pay phone.


1.4. - //hacking::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

tools: 
not programs  that hack for  you,  script kiddies.  these programs 
give  you various  information that you  could not get  otherwise. 
here are a few to get you started. 

a free isp on a floppy*
ftp space
telnet
firewall
terminal (preferably, hyper terminal)
hex editor
pinger and fingerer
*(Do not use one that requires your name to be registered.)


1.5. - //misc:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

hiding files in windows:
right click -> new -> folder
name it:
internet explorer.{FBF23B42-E3F0-101B-8488-00AA003E56F8}

should function  as a normal  folder now,  just with the  icon and 
name of internet explorer.
