HACKING MINESWEEPER
By: DizzIE

    I'm sure everybody remembers that one addictive Windows game that we all used to play until Doom came out. That's right, I'm talking about Windows Minesweeper. You could easily beat the beginner level and probably the intermediate level too, if you put your mind to it. But you could never beat the expert level. You always had two or three spaces left and you always picked the one that had the damn mine under it. Well no more agony my friends, for I have come up with a simple little trick you can do to make it look like you actually beat the expert level. All you have to do is go to Find (click on the Start button), then search for the file winmine.ini (it should be in your Windows folder). 
    Once you find the file open it. You should see something like this:
[Minesweeper]
Difficulty=0
Height=8
Width=8
Mines=10
Mark=0
Color=1
Xpos=80
Ypos=66
Time1=10
Time2=50
Time3=100
Name1=DIzzIE
Name2=DIzzIE
Name3=DizzIE
    Now all you do is replace the times (Time1…Time2…) with whatever number you want. Same thing with the names. After you're done just close the INI file (don't forget to save) and open up Minesweeper. Click on Game, then Best Times, and if you did everything correctly you should see the new times and names that you put in. 
    So now you finally beat Minesweeper. WHOPEEEEEE!
