************************************************************

			***ONLY WORKS IN DOS***

1.Open the MSDos prompt or your command promt and type cls
2.cls clears the screen, this is optional!
3.Create a new folder for example on the desktop.
4.To do this type: mkdir \windows\desktop\encrypt
5.To encrypt the folder type:
6.ren \windows\desktop\encrypt encrypt_ed
7.Where the _ sign is, is what the folder will looklike in windows.
8.But instead of using the keyboard to get the _ sign in DOS. type this
9.encrypt(HOLD ALT & PRESS 255)ed
10.In DOS it will appear as a blank space. The Folder cannot now be edited, 
renamed, moved, opened, deleted etc through windows, but everything inside 
the folder remains the same!

        -----------------------------------------

11.To decrypt the folder type:
ren \windows\desktop\encrypt(ALT+255)ed decrypted
12. Thats it! type  cls if you want, to cover up what you have been doing! 
You can now access the folder through windows.
13.  If you havn't gotten it it's very simply all that you are doing is 
going into dos and typing ren(name) \folder to another name that is going to 
have the (hold alt & press 255 ) command so that you can't see it in windows 
but it is still there and accessable!!!
