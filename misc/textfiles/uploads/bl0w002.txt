1- Ed E. Torial

We´re still alive! y4y!
Still no page, or should i say: the main idea for this second issue came before sitting down to
make it. Issue 3 will be spawned after the birth of the bl0w webpage.
The request for an ascii art logo is still up. um... if u can, please include the full meaning
(Basic Language for Oniric Warp) in the logo, like somehow into it, in just normal letterz.
Thanx again.


2- Stupid christian myths

"I will rather burn in Hell with my forefathers, than go to Heaven with you!" - Saxon chieftain
answering christian missionaries

Lets first start with virgin mary. lets think christian and believe the conception without sex
thingy. but after conceiving jesus, she was still married to joseph... u mean to tell me they
never, ever, had sex? and they stayed together being a perfect family? total bullshit. ask any
non-priest/nun christian and they will say that the "grace of god" is not enough, theres more to
life.

Christmas: this is st00pid. wanna have a holiday where u stuff yourself with food, get drunk and
exchange presents? perfect. but dont say its religious, or the "birth of jesus". this holiday
was "created" in the middle ages after christianism had imposed by the roman empire and they were
trying to destroy the remaining pagan beliefs. so they took Yule (which is still celebrated in,
for example, Finland) and turned it into "jesus´ birthday". well bl0w me.

Well, i was gonna comment more on similar bull$hit but forgot about what exactly. more will come,
tho.


3- My state/position

I was baptized as a christian, went to a religious elementary school and took the first
communion, became an atheist at about 11. I am still an atheist and will remain that way. I am
against organized religion (specially christianism) and supportive of laveyan satanism, paganism
and heathenism.


4- My many names, etc

My nick was/is bartalak (long story). my irc nick was argman (arg for argentina, man, besides the
obvious, is because i wanted a nick that specified sex) from the day i first ircd to like a
couple monts ago, when i changed it to gen0cide cuz i was somehow pissed and then recently
changed it to gen0iced. my real full name is Ignacio Fernandez Ivern, but i tend to skip the
Fernandez to make it shorter/simpler. ignacio is a latin name meaning more or less "fire" (from
the latin "igneus" - fiery). Fernandez is a spanish surname, from my dad´s dad, and ivern is a
catalan surname from my dad´s mom. my mom is italian, so im a mix of more or less 50% italian,
25% spanish, 25% catalan blood, but the catalan blood is more or less faded. so i look italian/
spanish (while im here i might just as well say i have black hair & brown eyes). we are mainly
inmigrant mixes in argentina :P but you should see the girls that come out of those mixes....
=P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


5- Thought

Polar bears are way kewl.
