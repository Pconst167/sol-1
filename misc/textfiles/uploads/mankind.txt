THE PLAGUE OF MANKIND
BY:DIzzIE Ó2000

First of here is my comment on this essay:
"It is a tale written by an idiot. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
-William Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, scene V
But then we must remember that a man said that, AHAHAHAHA! HERE WE GO (DEEP BREATH):
PART 1= MAN
DIzzIE: Behold the ultimate disease!
Man!
How dare thee crawl out of thy mother's womb?
and plague the earth!
Ye rude, slobbering beast!
Ye come and Ye devastate a once blissful place!
No longer is earth lustful!
NEY!
It is now a final Hell
Men!
You Fools!
Crawl back into your wombs and be unborn
UNBORN!
Take back the Hell you have created
no one desires it, no one but you!
But no one desires you! except your own filth
There is no undoing to the damage you have done
But it MUST be stopped!
Man must be annihalated!
a)KILLED!
b)WIPED OUT!
c)TERMINATED!
d)DESTROYED!
e)ALL OF THE ABOVE! YES!
Earth must be saved!, for there are few places that remain pure, that man has not pissed on yet!
Those places must be kept pure!
For Earth shall still deserve dignity!
It is not fair for it to become polluted
I SPEAK TO ALL HUMANITY!
Destroy yourself!
Do unto yourself!
You have no right to be here
You have no rights at all! NONE!
WAIT!
you have 1 right=to kill yourself
I can not urge you anymore
WHAT?
URGE?
I am not urging!
I am commanding
YOU MUST die!
You have done no good! NONE!
You are beyond a disgrace!
You are beyond a nuisance!
You are beyond dirty!
You are beyond ugly!
You are man!
Ha!
and Ha! again
I can not think of a pain to give you, as you gave the earth
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
RA: HALT DIzzIE!
DIzzIE: Who the fuck are you?
RA: I am Ra!
DIzzIE: Ra!
I piss on you, you dare give this filth light!
RA: But it is not the mortals' fault, o' great DIzzIE!
DIzzIE: WHAT!?
RA: It is the human brain, that is to blame!
DIzzIE: Tell me more of this brain, Ra
Tell your tale Ra!
PART 2=THE TALE OF RA
RA: The man!
He is nothing!
Shells, empty shells!
The man's body does nothing!
Not the bodies fault!
DIzzIE: Then whose fault Ra?
RA: The brain!
It controls the empty shell, manipulates the empty shell. The brain ruins the Earth!
DIzzIE: Tell me more, I must know more!
RA: The brain
it is the circle in the square
it is the square in the circle
The brain makes the man destroy!
The brain is the destroyer!
the manipulator
the tyrant
The brain must be destroyed!
and when the brain is destroyed, the bodies will fall, Earth shall be saved! Rejoice! But not yet! Soon!
So great DIzzIE, focus on the center, the middle
Not the corners of the circle!
But the center of the square!
Destroy the brain!>that will render the man useless, incapable of anything
Save the Earth!
Then I can shine with Pride!
PART 3=DIzzIE's REPLY 
DIzzIE: Ra, I thank you, for you shine over all, and you see over all, so you saw the center, while I was merely observing the corners, I did not see the true center!
Rah is right!
Truth!
Tis not man's fault
man is but a useless zombie
It is the brain!
WE must destroy the brain!
And that will save Earth
And we the "poWer" can live on Earth in peace!
So now, destroy the brains of all men!
By shooting the men in the head, for Ra claims that is where the brain is located
If you are man and you are reading this: save the Earth, save your body, go and bash your head with a sharp rock
kill the source of evil destruction=the brain.
YOU SHALL SAVE THE EARTH!
Do not heed your brain when it tells you not to kill it
HEED ME!
HEED RA!
Destroy your brain!
Destroy the brains of your fellow men
Be true!
Rid yourself of evil!
This is not excorsism!
The brain is real!
But WE AND YOU shall make it EXTINCT!
Let Ra shine in sadness no more!
NO MORE!
Let the brain control you NO MORE!
NO MORE!
It must die!
I wish the above phrae was "it is dead!"
But that is not true
not yet
but soon!
YES!
NOW!
SMASH  YOUR HEAD! SMASH ANOTHERS!
SAVE THE EARTH!
