The boot logo works a LOT different from Windows 95/98/ME, you can't simply
make a bitmap and name it logo.sys for it to work. Its a long process, but
here we go:

First thing you need is to get Resource Hacker, which can be found at
http://www.rpi.net.au/~ajohnson/resourcehacker/, Install the program and
open it.

Using Resource Hacker head to ntoskrnl.exe (located C:\WINNT\System32), open
it. Go to Bitmap > 1, click Action - Save [Bitmap : 1], save the file to your
hard drive.

Open your favorite graphics editor, and modify the boot logo to your liking.
Now save it, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the new file is in 16 colors! (16 not
16-bit) If the file is higher than 16 colors you WILL NOT see your boot screen
you'll be greeted instead by a nice Black Screen.

If you need help making the colors into 16 color instead of high color, read 
this paragraph, if not skip. First download Paint Shop Pro 7 (www.jasc.com),
open your bitmap with the program. Now with the image open:
- Click Colors > Decrease Color Depth
- Click 16 Colors
- Click OK
- Save the file as a bitmap

Now, run Resource Hacker again, open ntoskrnl.exe again.
- Click Action > Replace Bitmap
- Highlight 1, click Open file with new bitmap
- Open your new boot logo file
- Click Replace
- Click Close
- Click File - Save As..
- Save file as kernel2.exe in C:\WINNT\System32


Now we need to add it to boot options:
- Click Start > Run.. > type command > click OK
- type attrib boot.ini -r -a -s -h, press enter
- now open C:\ through explorer and edit boot.ini using a text editor
- Copy and Paste the existing "Windows 2000 Professional" entry
- Change ONE of the "Windows 2000 Professional" entries to your liking
- after '/fast detect' add '/kernel=kernel2.exe'
- Click File > Save
- Click Start, Run.. > type command
- now type attrib boot.ini +r +a +s +h

FINALLY, reboot your machine and select the new entry you created when you
modified boot.ini. Volia! your logo should now appear!

If you want to use your logo everytime without the boot menu:
- Right-click on My Computer
- Click Advanced Tab
- Highlight the modified entry under 'Default operating system'
- Uncheck 'Display list of operating systems for'
- click ok
- click ok again
