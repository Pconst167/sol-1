1. Introduction

Welcome to the wonderful world of trojan hacking, for those of you who
don't know what trojan hacking is,  trojan hacking is simply the use of
a program to gain access to another persons computer.  Hence this is
not true hacking.  True hacking involves massive codes, passwords, and
something most good hackers like to call UNIX, yes for almost a year
and a half I was a Trojan hacker, but now I'm a good 2 years into
studying and understanding UNIX.  This Volume which, yes, was written on
the first day of the year 2000, involves the use of the program Netbus.
Which is probably the most commonnly used trojan of our day.  This was
geared to be a guide with which you could easily take netbus and a few
other resources, and get into other persons computers.

2. FAQ's

1 - To get into anothers computer, both computers must be turned on, and
online
2 - Yes this program does sometimes screw up, just turn it off and back
on again
3 - Unless you have actually paid for the Trojan, you do have an Illegal
compy
4 - There must be a remote program installed on the other persons comp
before you will be able to connect to it
5 - If you actually read all of this, you either a newbie, or an idiot

3. What You Need

Well first you need the trojan of the day, Netbus, and yes you could
type that word in on almost any search engine, and viola you have
hundreds of answers to your query, I will also provide you with a good
download spot which is on one of my friends domains, so that it probably
won't be removed for a few years.  You'll also need an IP sniffer which
I will tell you more about later.

Downloads:

http://www.starwarshq.com/sniffer.zip

***If those don't work try changing the files to all caps, or just the
extensions as caps, if neither work they aren't there no more, so just
go to altavista or something***

4 - How To

How to?  How to what hack, yeah thats it.  Netbus once you click on
Netubus.exe up pops this little window with all kinds of buttons, read
them if you want, now the part were gonna concentrate on is the place
where it says 'Host name/IP', well this is where everything comes down,
this is where you type in the person (or computers) IP number you wish
to get into.  But then your sitting there thinking, wait a minute I don't
know what my friends IP is, well thats where the Sniffer program I told
you about earlier comes into play at.

ICQ you know what it is 60% of the people who are online have ICQ,  if
you want to hack your friends, you'll need this, ICQ serves two purposes
one it tells you whether or not your friends are online, and two it
gives the all useful thing called a UIN number, which is there user
number on ICQ, you can find it after clicking on there name, and finding
out all of there information (and yes sometimes, under there information
you will see there IP address), but most of the time you won't see there
IP address, so put there UIN number into the ICQ IP Sniffer which you
should have downloaded by now.  And again viola you have there IP.

Now you see that second thing that says 'Port', well for the most part
thats just there to be annoyying, but sometimes it comes in handy, but
I'll talk about that in a latter volume.  So you have the IP, and your
ready to hit the 'Connect' button.  Well no your not, you know when you
downloaded that Nebus17.zip, well theres a program called Patch.exe,
well do you, that program has to have been run on the other persons
computer, yep it has to have been run on ther comp, physically executed
by the other guy.  Now there are a lot of ways to do this, just think
about them, you could actually be there friend, and be over there house
enough that you could sneakily do it, or when giving them a program tell
them to run it as an update or something (You can rename it to anything
you want you know).

Once the program is on there computer, you've got there IP, you hit the
connect button, and again viola you are now inside that persons computer
wow, you just got into somebody's computer. I'm not gonna bother
explaining what all of those buttons do, they are pretty much self
explanatory after this point.

5 - Protection

You may want to take this to heart yourself,  there is a program out there
called Netbuster, which detects the Patch.exe after its been ran, and
gets rid of it, which leaves you powerless to gain access again.  There
are other programs that will password protect machines against trojans
as well.  When this happens, most of the time the Trojan Hacker is useless
and this is where the true hacker takes over in the quest for information.

6-7- Why to do it, and Ethics

Well here's the end,  you may get into other peoples computers just to
freak them out by opening there Cd rom tray dozens of times.  But you
take it past the point of hacking, and of morals when you begin to do
damage to there computer.

1. Don't alter or delete any files, other than those to protect yourself
2. DO NOT hack government computers
3. Yes you can be traced if your not careful, so please take head

The Hacker Manifesto

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch,
the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already
existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't
run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We
explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge...
and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without
nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and
lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet
we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they
look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that
you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this
individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
