Note: this document was made with windows 2000 in mind, this doesn't
mean that these tips won't work for other versions of windows but 2k
is the main focus. This also focuses on some programs bundled with
w2k, but the main focus is the operating system itself and not its
co-ops. Some of these tips are actually based on NT4 instead of 2000,
although there are very few, some may not work with 2000.


[Preface]

In order to edit the registry you must be adminstrator or have at least
power user settings in order to even have access to the registry. To
edit the registry you click start, run.. and type regedit then click ok.
You will be presented with the registry, note that in this document I
use shorthand which will be the following:
HLM - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HCU - HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HCR _ HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

Its recommended that you backup your computer before you attempt ANY
of these tweaks as they could screw up your computer to where it is
no longer functional. I recommend a product such as Winrescue to backup
your registry.

-                             -
[1. DISABLE PERSONALIZED MENUS]
-                             -
Personalized Menus is a new feature in Windows 2000 in which the order
of the start menu is set from most frequent accessed programs to least
accessed programs. Which is fine for some, but if you are like me this
feature is useless. To disable it, right-click empty spot on the 
taskbar, select properties, under general uncheck "use personalized
menus".


-                       -
[2. HIDE LOG OFF ON MENU]
-                       -
To remove Log-off <x> from the Start Menu right-click empty spot on
the taskbar, select properties, go to advanced and uncheck display
logoff.


-                         -
[3. DISABLE 8.3 FILENAMING]
-                         -
The purpose of this is to increase performance of windows 2000, by
doing this this will prevent windows from automatically truncanting
longer filenames down to 8.3 file system for 16-bit support. Not
recommended if you plan on using old 16-bit programs.
Open the registry go to HLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
in the right pane create a new DWORD value called 
NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation, double-click on it and give it the
value of 1.


-                                  -
[4. REMOVING SERVICES FROM SERVICES]
-                                  -
This simply removes the entry from the Services menu, so it is recommended
you disable or stop the service BEFORE you do this. To remove the service
from the list go to HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services in your registry.
Locate the object you wish to delete in the right pane and delete it.


-                                            -
[5. CHANGE DESKTOP WALLPAPER ON LOG-ON SCREEN]
-                                            -
Say you have a picture of a car on your desktop when you log-on but you
just get that plain desktop when you get to the log-in screen. You can
change this by opening up the registry and going to
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop, in the right pane locate 
the value named Wallpaper, double-click on it and point it to the wallpaper
you wish to be viewable.


-                      -
[6. SPEED UP START MENU]
-                      -
When you are browsing there is a slight delay in displaying new menus to
rid yourself of this follow these steps:
Go to the registry, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop, 
double-click MenuShowDelay (or create it) and set it to 100. Reboot
your machine or press F5 on the desktop.


-                                     -
[7. AUTO SHUTDOWN OF TASKS ON SHUTDOWN]
-                                     -
When you shutdown Windows sometimes it just loves to harrass you and 
claim <x> application is not responding and you would normally have
to click end task to stop it. With this method Windows 2000 will
automatically kill the non-responding application. To do this
open the registry go to HKEY_USER\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop
double-click AutoEndTasks and set it to 1.


-                                -
[8. TURN OFF COMPUTER ON SHUTDOWN]
-                                -
Generally your computer will not support it anyway if it wasn't put
on by default, but if you have upgraded drivers that do support it
this is how you can turn it on. Even if your computer doesn't 
support it this won't hurt anything. Open the registry of course,
go to HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
in the Right-Pane modify PowerDownAfterShutdown or create it as a
string value. Give it a value of 1 to enable power off or 0 to 
disable it.


-                      -
[9. CHANGE TASKBAR SIZE]
-                      -
Sometimes you just don't have enough room for all the programs you
have open on your machine. To change this you need to move your
cursor to the edge of the taskbar until it goes to a double-arrow
then click and drag it one or two notches up.


-                              -
[10. CHANGING SECURITY POLICIES]
-                              -
These settings will restrict certain functions on Windows 2000 in
the event you don't want something modified or you don't want a 
feature available period. Open your registry and go to
HCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
in the right pane create or edit the following values, they are
all DWORD values.

NoCommonGroups (value of 1)
Removes the "Programs" Option from the start menu, who would use
this I would not know.

NoDesktop (value of 1)
Hides all Desktop Icons, pretty much renders the desktop useless..
useful for a nice clear view of the desktop wallpaper but thats
about it.

NoFileMenu (value of 1)
Removes File Menu from all Explorer windows

NoFind (value of 1)
Removes Find off the startmenu.

NoNetConnectDisconnect (value of 1)
Removes Map Network Drive from context menu

NoNetHood (value of 1)
Removes Network Neighborhood from Desktop

NoRun (value of 1)
Removes Run from Start Menu, note that it is still possible
to use RUN by pressing WINDOWS KEY + R.

NoSetFolders (value of 1)
hides control panel/printers/my computer in explorer and
on the start menu.

NoSetTaskbar (value of 1)
No right-clicking on the Taskbar

NoClose (value of 1)
Removes the shutdown option


-                                              -
[11. VIEW WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT IN FULL SCREEN]
-                                              -
If you have a DOS box open you can full screen it by pressing
Alt + Enter.


-                              -
[12. ENABLE RESTARTING OF SHELL]
-                              -
Sometimes if the shell crashes you will be left with a blank desktop
and there is nothing you can do but log off and log back on, until
now. Open the registry and go to:
HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
in the right pane look for "AutoRestartShell" if you can't find it
create it as a new dword value. Give it the value of 1.


-                               -
[13. EVEN MORE SECURITY POLICIES]
-                               -
Go to HCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
in the registry. Enter or modify any of the following DWORD values:
DisableTaskMgr - Disables Task Manager (Alt+Ctrl+Del)
NoDispAppearancePage - Removes Appearance Tab from Display Settings
NoDispBackgroundPage - Removes Background Tab from Display Settings
NoDisCPL - Removes Display Option from control panel
NoDispScrSavPage - Removes Screen Saver Tab from Display Settings
NoDispSettingsPage - Removes Settings Tab from Display Settings


-                            -
[14. ENABLE X-MOUSE FUNCTIONS]
-                            -
X-Mouse will make it so when you move your cursor over a window it
will automatically become active, much like X-Windows in Linux. To
do this go to HCU\Control Panel\Mouse\ then double-click on the
ActiveWindowTracking on the right pane and give it the value of 1.


-                                -
[15. CHANGE OWNERSHIP INFORMATION]
-                                -
You can change the registered owner/company to the computer by changing
these settings in the registry: first open regedit and go to
HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
Change the value RegisteredOrganization to the company name of your
choice, then change the value Registered Owner to the name of your
choice.


-                                          -
[16. DISABLE AUTOMATIC ADMINSTRATIVE SHARES]

If you notice that when you try to disable the sharing of drives on
your Windows 2000 computer it will automatically share it as C$ D$
and so on..but you can get rid of it now.
Open the registry go to HLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\
LanmanServer\Parameters, Create or modify the DWORD value of
AutoShareServer and AutoShareWks and give them a value of 0. No
more worrying about the automatic creation of shares on the 
adminstrative account!

to be logged on at once.

-                               -
When you normally minimize or restore a window there is a little cute
animation..well that animation gets old lets turn it off shall we? to
remove this cute feature go to HCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics

This will only work if you are running a NTFS volume, otherwise this
is a useless tweak. This tweak will disable Windows from doing Last
Access Stamps on EVERY directory it detects. Open the registry and
go to HLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem. Create DWORD
on the right pane name it NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate and give it
the value of 1.

[24. REMOVING HOTFIX UNINSTALL FILES]
-                                   -
Note: this will make it so the entries in Add/Remove Programs do not work
to uninstall the hotfixes, please get a program like Add/Remove Pro to 
remove the invalid entries that this process will leave behind.

This will save a good amount of space if you need it, first off you need
to set your view so you can see hidden system files. Then browse to your
Windows 2K Directory (C:\WINNT) you will see hidden files labeled like
so "$NtUninstallKB329115$" you can delete all folders that are labeled
similiar to this. You can gain upwards to 70Megs back by following these
simple steps.

Smooth scrolling is common in almost every scrolling aspect in Windows 
2000, it make look neat and make things more easily visable, but it
takes a few CPU cycles to do it. To disable this feature open your
registry and go to HCU\Control Panel\Desktop create a new DWORD

-                                   -
[30. DISPLAY FULL ICON WHEN DRAGGING]
-                                   -

computer should be able to search reasonably fast WITHOUT this feature
being enabled. To turn it off, double-click on My Computer, right-click on
one hard drive, on the bottom uncheck Allow Indexing Service, then check
Apply changes to <x>:\, subfolders and files, then click ok. Repeat for

In Windows 2000 there may be a issue with drivers installed for your 
hardware. You need to first disable the automatic rebooting on errors, if
you still get random reboots then the chances are it is your drivers. 
The most common culprit is usually your video card or your modem, you need
to visit the manufacturer of your cards and get the latest drivers that 
are windows 2000 compatible.

-                                                -
If you followed the previous steps in the last tip then you will realize 
that Outlook Express will take a long ass delay in loading. So in order to
remove this delay you have to go to the messenger directory 
(C:\Program Files\Messenger) and rename the messenger folder to messengerd,

this will prevent windows from needlessly searching for scheduled tasks on
a remote computer to disable this behavior; open the registry, go to
HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RemoteComputer\
NameSpace\, now delete the key that is named
{D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF}, Windows will no longer waste your
time by searching for scheduled tasks on other computers.

[88. RESET WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER VIDEO CACHE]
-                                          -
Sometime you may download a video and in the middle of downloading the video
you decide to play it to see if its worth downloading...well during the 
playing WMP stores information about the video you have played..so say only
2 minutes of the video is downloaded yet the complete video is 7 minutes
long. So once the download is complete and you launch the video it may
only read 2 minutes because WMP still uses its Video Cache instead of the
new full featured video.
In order to clear WMP video cache you need to open the following folder
\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Media Index,
now delete the file called wmplibrary_v_0_12.db. This will reset the cache
and hopefully make it so you can play your video completely.

[89. MSCONFIG ALTERNATIVES]
-                         -
You'll notice in Windows 2000 that there is no msconfig like there was in
windows 98/ME. You can download and install Startup instead by visiting the
website at http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml. The program is much more
robust than msconfig. You can alternatively copy msconfig.exe from windows xp
if you'd like to use it in Windows 2000.

[90. ENABLE AUTO LOGON]
-                     -
This can be a good feature to have if you are too lazy to sign in your own
username and password, however it can also be a security problem seeing as
anyone that turns on the computer can automatically log in to the specified
account. If you wish to do this still follow these steps; open the registry
and head to HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon, now
in the right pane create the new string values:
DefaultUserName - enter the value of the username who is to auto logon.
DefaultPassword - value of the password who is to auto logon.
DefaultDomain - value of domain that the user is to logon, if any.
Now create or edit the string value named AutoAdminLogon and give it a value
of 1. Reboot your machine and you should now automatically logon everytime 
you boot your computer.

-                                              -
Sometimes a program bug will list a uninstall entry on add/remove programs 
that simply doesn't work, or perhaps you deleted the files off the hard 
drive instead so the entry doesn't point to anything. In order to remove 
these entries you need to open the registry and go to HLM\Software\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall, here you will see a list of programs that
correspond to the installed programs, delete whichever are invalid.

-                     -
Windows 98 (or 95 with IE4 Active Desktop Update) introduced the windows
shell that looks similiar to internet explorer, as well as it introduced
the quick launch bar, a new explorer browsing look, and active desktop.
While these are neat to some people, others might find it a nuissance.
To use the classic shell open the registry, and then go to the following
key HCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer, 
create a new DWORD value named ClassicShell or modify the existing one
and give it a value of 1.

[96. ACCESS WINDOWS UPDATE W/O REGISTERING]
-                                         -
This is here pretty much for historic reasons. This is pointless now since
you don't really need to register to use Windows Update anymore. So anyway
if you want to do this open the registry, go to HLM\Software\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion\, create a new String Value called RegDone and give
it the value of 1.

the file. Now you will be presented with a bunch of entries under 
[Components]. You can add more options to Windows Component Removal by removing
"Hide" entries.
Fax   - This is the Fax utlity installed in Windows 2000
Imagevue - Gives options to remove imaging components
AutoUpdate - Gives the ability to remove Windows Auto Update component

There may be more listed in your setup, but these are the ones that I could
change when I removed "HIDE" from their entries. AutoUpdate will NOT be listed
unless SP3 or higher is installed.

-                                      -
The upgrade editions of Windows 2000 will work as a full installation to
a lost windows 2000 installation without any cd verification. However when
used on a drive carrying no previous version of windows, you will need to
have a previous versions disk handy so when you run setup you can get past
the cd verification step. So, yes the upgrade edition can do full installs
but you need a previous versions disk first.

While windows 2000 doesn't have as bad of a habit of asking everytime
you remove/add a windows component to prompt for the 2K CD, it will

head to HLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion, modify the
string value named SourcePath, to read C:\i386\, click ok..Reboot

[3. STOP 0x0000007B: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE]
This error normally occurs if a motherboard is swapped and uses a different
set of drivers than the previous motherboard. To fix this boot with the
Windows 2000 Setup Disk, Continue into setup until you get the option to
repair your current installation of Windows 2000. After the repair Windows
2000 should operate normally.


[4. WINDOWS 2000 DOESNT START WITH PCANYWHERE 9 INSTALLED]
If Pcanywhere 9.0 is installed on Windows 2000 booting will generate a 
winlogon.exe crash. To fix this you need to first uninstall PCANYWHERE
by booting your machine up in safe mode (F8 on boot, Safe Mode) using
Add/Remove programs to remove it, reboot the machine in normal mode.
Go to http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/files/pca/pca9-9598nt.html, 
download the patch, install Pcanywhere 9.0 again and then apply the
patch.

[5. MISSING DESKTOP AFTER EXPLORER CRASH]

click Task Manager, click file - new task.., type in explorer.exe,
click ok. Windows 2000 should reload your desktop.

[6. WINDOWS 2000 WONT REMEMBER FOLDER VIEW SETTINGS]
Sometimes after so many different view settings on so many different folders
Windows 2000 will forget its settings. There are numerous solutions to try
they are as follows:
- under tools - folder options - view tab, see if "remember folder's view
settings" is checked under advanced.
- Under HCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer in
  regedit, make sure there is no DWORD value named NoSaveSettings with a
  value of 1. If there is, delete it or give it the value of 0.
- Finally if neither of the previous solutions work you will have to increase
Windows 2000's quota for remembering folder settings. Go to HCU\Software\
Microsoft\Windows\Shell, create a new DWORD value in the right pane named
BagMRU Size, give it the value of 2000 in decimal. Go to HCU\Software\Microsoft\
Windows\ShellNoRoam, create the same DWORD value as previously mentioned. 
Reboot your machine.

- Right-click start, select explorer, select C: Drive
- Click View, click details
- click the Name Column, Hold Ctrl, close explorer by clicking the X
- release Ctrl, reboot your computer
