				Yahoo Trojan Attack Guide

				YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

Ok, this is not a g-file on how to use a Trojan Horse. This is a file on how to launch a trojan 
attack on ordinary people using Yahoo in chat rooms. This is actually quite simple, but it can 
get aggrivating sometimes since some people have Norton AntiVirus, firewalls, etc. This is more of 
a begginers manual for breaking into other peoples computers.

By the Way, to actually practice the information in this file is Illegal! If you are 16 years 
old, or older, then you can be charged as an adult, have your computer taken away, and be in some 
deep shit. So this file is for Informational Perposes only (ha ha thats funny).
---------
Things you Need:

The Internet
Yahoo Messenger
Satanic IP Stealer
A Trojan Horse (hack'a'tack is good for beginners, NetBus Pro recommended) search 
www.google.com to find them
--------
Preparing

Ok, first, Open the Satanic IP Stealer program (do it out of a chat room or people will know what 
you are doing). Be sure you are connected to the internet when you open it, or else it will not 
show you your IP Address. When you open it, you will see your IP Address, copy your IP Address, 
or write it down or something.

Now goto www.cjb.net . on cjb.net you will be able to hide your IP Stealing address (which you 
should do). In the blank box, write down what website you would like to have:

EXAMPLE: http://this-is-my-ip-stealing-site.cjb.net

This is FREE.

Once you push the Register it button, it will take you to another page, where you give your 
actual website that it is going to cloak for you. When it asks for your real website, put in 
http://your ip address:666 . You need to Copy your IP address that you took from your Satanic IP 
Stealer program, and paste it in the box, then the :666 .

EXAMPLE: http://56.343.234.32:666

The rest of the webpage you are signing up for, just select NO for everything, when it asks for 
your email address, just give them a bunch of bullshit like: afdaufdafyduafydiafyduyi@yahoo.com.

Then type in your password, and register it.

It should then take you to another webpage that says "Ok here is your link, congratulations". 
Click on the link, then look at the Satanic IP Stealer program, your IP address should pop up in 
the bottom of the box. If it doesn't, then you are an idiot and you need to redo everything.

Now, copy the link it gave you, and save it somewhere.
---------
The Attack

Ok, now lets get to your Trojan. There should be a program that came with the Trojan that you 
have called "Server.exe". DO NOT OPEN IT. Right click on server.exe, and rename it to 
"myprogram.exe" or something like that.

Now, go into a chat room on Yahoo. Find some idiot that want to download the program. You do this 
by telling them its a Game that you programmed, or a self extracting exe that is filled with porn 
pictures.

First, you give them the Link that you chose from cjb.net. When they click the link, their IP 
Address will show up on your Satanic IP Stealer program. They will then inform you that the page 
did not load. Say something like "oh, I'm sorry, my web host is down, I'll just send the program 
to you".

Now, on the message box, click the "Send File" button. Find the Server that your renamed. Now, 
send them the file.

When they recieve the file, they will open it, and then you can connect to their IP Address that 
you got when they clicked on the link.

Like I said, I am not explaining how to use the trojan, so figure it out yourself. Have Fun.
--------
Covering Your Tracks

When you do things like this, there is always a chance of getting caught, so it is logical to 
cover your tracks so it is harder for anybody to catch you.

When you are in their computer, goto C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\StoredIM , and delete 
EVERYTHING in that folder, this will delete your entire convorsation with the victim, that way he 
can never prove it was you.

goto C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\Profiles\victims_username\Archive\Messages and delete all 
the files in the folder.

goto C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\Profiles\victims_username\Archive\Conferences and delete 
all the subdirectorys in the folder

goto C:\My Documents\victims_username\receive , find the program you send the victim, and delete 
it.

When you are done in the victims comptuer, on your trojan, click on the "Kill Server" button. 
this will delete the server compleatly off of the victims computer.

Hope you enjoyed the Information that is for informational perposes only.
