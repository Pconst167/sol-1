                  Six Thoughts on One Government

     "The Government tries to make you crazy." said the crazy 
man in a crazy way.  "They don't realize the demons they bring 
forth!"
     "Fuckin' government, Fuckin' leave me alone!" yelled the 
quite angry man.  "They try to make you think you're paranoid, 
but you're not!"
     "The Government tries to regulate my catchins." says the 
fisherman.
     "The Government helps build things." bubbles the scubadiver.
     "The Government uses me for military operations." shines 
the moon.
     "The Government probes me asshole" shuggles the alien 
abductee.

Cure for the Disease                      -Fellow Felon

Throw up your fists and unite!
Fight till your death, 
And don't be a slave.
Come on people,
Dig their graves!

The time has come, to knock it down.
The wall of restrictions, to the ground.
The time is now, so let me set it straight.
Get ready now, you don't hafta wait.
Five ways to die and
Five ways to live and
Five ways to kill.
Come on, when's the date?

Hurry up now, Throw up your fists and unite!
Fight till your death, 
And don't be a slave.
Come on people, 
Dig their graves!

The system's fightin hard,
But we're kicking back
On an endless supply of will and whoop-ass.
We don't go silently
We don't retreat
We won't stop until the system's beat.



Purpose                                      - Fellow Felon

     Our revolution is like a gun.  When you have a gun, should 
you run and hide, or stand and fight?  We should stand.  Right 
now, the problem is that we don't have ample ammunition.  You 
can kill a lot of people with one gun but only until you run 
our of bullets.  So, basically, the only problem is in numbers.
The small groups of revolutionaries that exist across this GREAT 
nation are too separated to be of convenience to the next group. 
 With our help and determination, we should be able to "unite" 
these groups under one into one group.  Not physically, 
necessarily, but at least spiritually, so that all groups are 
aware that the other groups exist.  Strength is in numbers.
     We can not beat the system solely using infiltration but 
surely can't beat it without it.  In a sense, we will work as 
the system works.  We will spy on them as they spy on us.  "Keep 
your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."
     They will shoot some of the fingers off our hand that holds 
the gun but we will keep firing.  We can not expect to escape 
this battle unscathed.  We can not be afraid to die.  We must 
volunteer our lives so that others may live in freedom in the 
near future.  I hope that when some of us die, the ones that 
survived to see it won't blame the revolution, but the 
government.  It is not any of our faults that this had to happen.
We are not striving for power as they are.  We are not self-
indulgent as they are.  We do not mock the word "freedom" as 
they do.  We are a true people.  Born in the same time period 
so we could meet our brothers.  Do fight for this country, but 
not for this government!  Fight for them, for they are unknowing,
and we deliver them from confusion and replace it with harmony.

Unite, Fight, Win!                           - Fellow Felon

     Let's recall something the Beastie Boys once said:  "You 
gotta fight, for your right, to Party!!"  Well, they were right 
to the point.  We, as citizens of the United States, do not 
have the right to participate in "fun" as we deem it.  The U.S. 
government says what is "fun" and what "fun" we are allowed 
to partake in.
     For example, there is a legal curfew for teenagers.  We 
must follow the curfew or risk being persecuted.  Who rules 
you?  You or them?  How can there be a law telling when you 
are allowed outside?  Mother Nature welcomes us all at all hours,
but the government is only there when it suits their needs. 
 Who can we trust as long as political figures are using their 
popularity to line their pockets?  Friends.  Become loyal to 
your friends and be prepared to die for any of them.  Remember, 
loyalty is more valuable than gold.  As long as we are loyal 
to each other, "they" can't beat us.  One day the system will 
crash...because no loyalty exists within.  Every person in the 
system is there to make their wallets fatter.  We are humans. 
Not a goddamn machine!  We will prevail!!!
Please pass this to the next person so that everyone gets a 
chance to read. - Fellow Felon
