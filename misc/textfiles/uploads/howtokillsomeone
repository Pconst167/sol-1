ways to kill someone
1:obvious one-shoot them, noisy, messy, not enough torture, then again it is 
effective.
2:Blow the up-yet again, very noisy. But you do get the satisfaction of 
watching that bastard to a 360 and thier limbs fly in several directions
3:Deadly injections-this can cover anything from household chemicals to real 
shit bugger chemicals.
4:burn the alive-very satisfying but yet again, ver conspicuous
5:torture them-for this you will need a place to store them, preferably a 
private one away from the public
6:torture X2-if your really nasty you could do this, its basically torture 
one but minus the clothes ;)
7:Make them watch Songs of Praise over and over again, as long as you can 
escape the religious rays this one is brilliant to watch. VERYVERY painful 
also
8:Make them clean out your toilet after you and all of your mates from the 
curry house have used it. obviously not one for the light hearted spectator

thats all i can think of right now
