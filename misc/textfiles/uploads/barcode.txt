Before we start, you need to plan everything out.  You will need a 
permanent marker

and/or a pair of scissors.  You must also plan out which store you want 
to do this

trick at and when.  Don't try this at a professional store or on any 
item that costs

over $10.   For the time, try to do this when lazy workers are 
working...you can tell if

their lazy by looking to see if they are fat, and looking to see if 
they are in a bad

mood.  Blockbuster usually works fine.

                           +        +        +        +       +        + 
        +        +       +        +        +        +


When you get in, pick up an item with a barcode that is easily 
accessible and make

sure that its printed on a surface that you can easily write on.  Now 
what you do is

take out your PERMANENT marker and cross it out...make sure you also 
cross out

the numbers at the bottom.  Some scanners will not be able to pick this 
up and the

item will not ring up.  If they send you back to get another, just go 
back where you

picked up the item and say theirs no more.  If an employee goes back 
and gets the

product just act interested and shocked like, "Where did you pick that 
up from!?"

When he points to the shelf with a hundred items laying their just say 
"Oh, I got mines

from over there."  When they ring it up and ask for your money just say 
"Oh damn-it!

I only have 2 dollars...ill be back in a bit".  Go back when their is 
another worker their

and cut the barcode off =[ you must make sure this person is lazy or 
pissed ]= and

you will get the item for free.
