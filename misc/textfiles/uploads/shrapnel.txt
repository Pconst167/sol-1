A homemade shrapnel bomb by Yblad

Hey.
A few notes on how to make a great shrapnel bomb.
what you will need:
a glass jar
a half full aerosol can (a bit smaller than the jar)
Paraffin (or equal)
tissue paper

First, find a thin glass jar of some sort (an old jam jar or glass
coffee holder will do) and fill it about a 1/4 up with paraffin.

Next, take a half full aerosol and remove the plastic top (the bit
that directs the spray).Put it (upside down) in the jar.

Then soak some tissue paper in the paraffin and roll it into a
cylinder shape.Put it in the side of the jar with the aerosol leaning
against it.

Finally, cover the gaps with more tissue (this can be soaked in
paraffin or not).

To set it off light the tissue that the aerosol is leaning
against.Wait about 5/10 minutes and she'll blow (sending thousands of
glass shards into the surrounding area).

 WARNING-GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY. DO NOT COME BACK TO THE BOMB IF
YOU THINK IT ISN'T GONNA BLOW.I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAME VERY
CLOSE TO FILLING THEMSELVES WITH GLASS THAT WAY.
