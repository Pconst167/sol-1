A better way to get free Magazines.

Here is a nice quick 'n' simple  way to get yourself a/some free magazine/s First you need to take note of when(a given day each week, month 
or whatever) the magazines you like first appear on the shelves & then all you have to do is get up(or still be up) around 4 or 5 am the 
morning of that day of the week/month and get your lazy arse outside, go down to the corner shop or the newsagent, at this time of morning 
you'll find bundles of 100-250 magazines lying on the foot path(side walk) outside awaiting store opening time, nobody is around to stop 
you from taking them.
