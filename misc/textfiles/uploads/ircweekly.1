IRC - An Electronic Drug

                            IRC - An Electronic Drug
                                Written By Zircon

	You may wonder about the topic, but i'm sure many of you know 
what i mean. How many times have you relized you're addicted, physically, 
and mentally to IRC? I'm sure you have noticed yourself experiencing 
withdrawl after being away for a week or so, still don't see it? Well 
lets compare, cocaine, and IRC.

	Cocaine:  1. One usage, and you're hooked.
                  2. Costs lots of money.
                  3. Seperates you from your family.
                  4. You develope a tolorance, and always need more.
                  5. Leads to a life of crime.
                  6. You probably started because it's "Cool"

        IRC:      1. One hour, you're majorly hooked.
                  2. The higher the speed, the more it costs.
                  3. I doubt you IRC with your family in your room.
                  4. 1 hour is never enough, then 2, then 3.
                  5. You start carding, setting up confs, trading warez, 
                     all illegal things to support your habbit.
                  6. Well ... you probably started for WaReZ, but i bet 
                     you thought they were kewl. 

	There you have it, almost identical, IRC Is a drug. Want more? By 
definition in the Oxford dictionary a drug is:

	drug 1 n. medicinal substance; narcotic, hallicinogen, or 
stimulant, esp. one causing addiction.

	I know i've seen shit while on irc, and don't tell me you goto 
bed with a clear mind, without a thought of IRC, after a heavy 8 hour, 
addict session.

	Well since it's 5am i'de like to keep this sort of short and to 
the point, but one last thing, who sells the drugs? Who controlls the 
flow, no, not the ISP, those, big know it all IRCOPS (*cough* benny 
*cough*) walking around, pimping, sucking dick for more drugs, they want 
the next level, the better high, ahh yes, the O: (refer to 'Zircons 
interview with Benny') the best high IRC has to offer. We need to help 
those people, they've gone to far, they can't handle the high anymore, 
and start murdering (*cough* vanity kill *cough*) people for MORE high, 
but they don't get more, they need help, or soon, they're gonna end up 
like the dood in that TCL 'Waterfalls' video.

iRC LaNGooAGE: Wut to thinq wen sum1 sayz "0-day 31337 gnu warez"
---- -  - -- --   -

 -an ereet atrikle by mad sniper, explainink da reet stuph we've
                                              developed over da yearz-

 Wun day eye wuz on da internet relay chat and i wuz like "phuq these 
people are kawllink me layme n shit wtf is layme!?" and it is now that I 
realize w0t the language meanz. here's like... uhm... a translashun 
tayble thing:

layme, l4m3, llama, laymuhr, lamah, lamer = joo needa touch up on your 
 kourieurink skillz.
k-raddy, k-rad, neato ereeto, elite, 31337, leet = joo kick sum majah azz 
 on da irc.
0-day = this is gewd.
gewd = this is vundahfewl
vundafewl = this is gewd or 0-day.

Okay, that's pretty mooch a basic translation table. With that, joo will 
be jah coolezt ereeto d00d on irc in no tyme.

On to the next sekshun, where the author learns to spell things 
correctly, gets a haircut, and stops masturbating.

Okay. You may find yourself on a channel with no people. There are two 
possibilities for this to occur:
 1) You have no life and like to hang out on channels alone.
 2) You just netsplit.
In the former case, we can't help you, just get your ass off irc and call 
1-800-388-PIR8 (irc help hotline) and ask them what you should do about 
your pirate problem (pirate is a synonym for "irc"). However, in the 
latter case, do this:
 /quit
It's the only way to get out of your current situation without 
accidentally taking over a channel (that would be bad, because then if 
you did, you'd have ops, and everyone knows that all channel ops are evil).

Alrighty. You may hear sum dood named "Pele" or "Sheiky" (2 different 
laymuhrz) say 'irc scripts are lame'. They're wrong, irc scripts are 
really really eleet! Get one that joo pheel cumfterbull with n shit. Coz 
like.. If pheenickz is dah onlee thing on yer account, joo gotz problemz. 
And joo are a laymuhr. Jew needa get sumthink like "Lice", "Tech5", 
"FausT", etc, to be considered "Ereet" and "0-dayz" by your irc comrades. 
Fuck me stupid! I almost forgot the most important thing:

Women.

Women hang out on irc, believe me now and hear me later. Joo may not gno 
it until like aphter you've called one of them a guy (like i did wunz 
with lsi oops I was laym back then), but there are sum jix out there that 
are just dying to have you say "Heya big woman, wanna irc with me for a 
few hours?". They wub dat. Wunz I kawlled jewels on the telefown and I 
wuz like "so you like kourieuring, eh?" and she wuz like "yeah." and we 
really hit it off. It's like this wun time when I went to school in 3rd 
grade and pulled down my pants and everyone saw my pecker and I became 
really popular in skewl.

..But..

You can't get the 0-day women unless ya gots the 0-day script and yer 
chatting on the 0-day channels. There's nothing like kawwlink an ugly hoe 
you just met in #canada (a laym 5-90 day channel) and have her tell you 
how much her wuzzle is aching for you. It's a waste of valuable time you 
could be spending masturbating (which I don't do any more).

So like.. Remember these elite irc thingz, they may get you unbanned frum 
a channel.

ode tew tha irc warriors
---- -  - -- --   -

              For staying up till four in the morning...
                   For showering every three days...
 For never leaving the house, unless it catches on fire, and then only
                    after we grab our computers...
                For sleeping late into the afternoon...
    For totally wasting the summer with meaningless conversation...

                               We are...

                       -/- THE IRC WARRIORS -/-
             (Not to be confused with the Couch Commandos)
  "Sworn to sit on our asses day after day and stare at the screen."

              Here is the IRC WARRIORS' token fight song:
        (it sounds vaguely like the Ren and Stimpy "Log" song)

 We sit in a chair,
 at the screen we stare,
 as our boredom slowly mounts

 We sit home all day,
 and we'll never pay
 for our hacked cris.com accounts

 the warriors, the warriors, we're on IRC all day
 the warriors, the warriors, at home is where we stay

   From: Eric Hillis
   To: root@escape.com
   Subject: Don't know if you really care

   a real lamer has apparently some ability to do nick collisions on IRC
   at will.. and it is extremely annoying.. so do you care? maybe not.. I
   thought
   I would try and see if anyone did..

   his supposed address was:
   stumble@elite.escape.com

   he said f*** my sysadmin
   so hmmm does anyone care? maybe not
   I'm really fed up with EFNet
   we have tried for a year to keep a peaceful channel called #bible
   not one of the IRC admins gives a crap.. and they gladly ban our
   bots..
   thanks a lot to all of them.. and now this lamer gets to run our
   channel..
   thanks
