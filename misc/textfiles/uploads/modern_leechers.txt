	I've read a lot of files about leechers in the day of BBS's, it's 
pretty clear no-one like them. Now with the advent of Peer to Peer 
programs like Kazaa, Napster and the torrent network the problems come 
back. And it's worse! Well, I'm pretty sure it is.

	From what I understand back in the day, people logged into BBS's
got some "wares" and uploaded some back. The people that just downloaded
it were called "leechers". This did make sysop's angry and annoyed but
it didn't slow the BBS down (At least I think it didn't). 

	With P2P now you download off peers (hence peer to peer), but if no-
ones sharing you can't get it. Most people I know who use P2P don't share! 
Their excuse is "I didn't know I had to". You ask them what would they do
if no-one shared and they give you a funny look and shrug there shoulders.
Okay, I admit a few years ago I didn't share either, but I do know and so 
should you.

	I've got a 2mbs(250kbs) ADSL connection. But I can only upload at 
0.25mbs(25kbs). Can you guess what my share ratio is? TWO POINT SIX! 
Thats right, at the current point in time I've upload 6.76gb and downloaded 
2.6gb, I give my share back even if ittakes ages. The best bit is that 
people respect you. By the way, I use BitTorrent, the best file sharing 
network.

	Most torrent sites, well the ones that are left, are implementing 
tracker systems. They track how much you upload and download. Go below 1 
(one) for too long and your barred. And you can't trick it like Kazaa Lite.
It's simple, keeps the sites fast and free of leechers. It's kinda like 
an automatic angry sysop. So if you want you movie/album/game then your 
gonna have to share! Or go and buy them...

	What have you got to lose? Leave your download program open when you 
finish your torrent. Your helping other people, who are helping you in 
the first place. Always remember when your sharing any copyrighted stuff 
make sure you use protection like Protowall, if you don't know what it is
 then see my upcoming text file on internet security.


	I hope you enjoyed reading this file, if you liked it please email me
with some feedback! Anyway I need to get some sleep, Night All! **Falls onto Laptop**
