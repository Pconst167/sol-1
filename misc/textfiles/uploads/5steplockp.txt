This text file was not made to be used to assist criminals
or want to be criminals. I am no way responsible for what 
you do with these picks you create and the consequences
you might face.


-----------------------------------------------------------  

OK first things first, here are some items you WILL need for
this project:

-Grinder with fine grain wheel
-Carbon steel hack saw blades (other blades don't make the cut for strength)
-Metal coat hanger (no paint on it)
-Plastic cup
-Water
-Propane torch
-Two sets of needle nose pliers
-Safety Glasses (thats right, no one is getting hurt)

OPTIONAL ITEMS

-Rotary tool with cutting disks
-Vice

----------------------------------------------------------- 

>STEP 1<

Prepare your work area. Fill up your plastic cup with water
(you can use a regular class if you don't mind getting rust
stuck to the bottom of it). Place your cup of water near the
grinder for easy access. This will be used as a quencher
since metal heats up as you grind it. Also have your torch
ready for later on.

>STEP 2<

Take your carbon steel hack saw blade and snap it into 1/3s.
you should be able to make three picks out of one blade if
you don't mess up. Also before you move on to the next step
decide what types of picks you want to make. Google some shapes.

>Step 3<

start grinding your 1/3 of a hack saw blade leaving about
an inch or maybe little less for a handle. REMEMBER IF YOU
START FEELING A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT QUENCH THE BLADE IN YOUR
CUP OF WATER OR YOU COULD GET BURNED VERY BAD.
You should grind it down to around 1/8 of an inch but leave 
a little more on near the end so you can turn it into what 
ever you want. You can also use a rotary tool if you feel 
confident. But use a vice with a rotary tool. But leave the 
blade teeth, you never know when you might need them.
DON'T FORGET TO QUENCH!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that you have some picks, you need a tension wrench or
torque tool, what ever you want to call it. I have tried 
making them out of hack saw blades and they all got warped
from pressure or just snapped off. My friend snapped his 
off in a lock. After many experiments I recently found
something that works. This is where the coat hanger comes
in.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

>Step 4<

Take an intact coat hanger and cut of the hoop before the twists.
Bend the hoop until it is striaght with out using or using the 
torch. Now light the torch and take the two pliers and bend the 
piece of the coat hanger into a L shape, have the bottom part of
the L be 3/4 of an inch to an inch. Quench immediatly after bending
to the L. OR you could use a flat head screw driver and follow step 5.

>Step 5< 

Barely grind down the bottom of the L so it barely fits in a lock, you
want it nice and snug.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. With the coat hanger tension wrench if the handle twists or bends
it can be easily be bent back in shape.

Don't forget to experiment with making custom picks and tension wrenchs.
