*\/* INTRODUCTION *\/*

This is my guide to bush bases. What is a "bush base" you ask yourself, well a bush 
base is a small cubbie, hut, tree house, shack etc. built in the bush or forest near or
far from a suburban area. These are mainly built by kids as a hideout or place to hang
out with their mates, Bush bases are even built by adults who have something to hide
or to hide themselves. A bush base is very usefull, they can be used for many many 
things too many name though. Throughout this text file a number of things will be 
explained including how to go about finding a good location for your base, clearing
the area for a suitable base, finding and/or obtaining the materials to build your base,
protecting your base and raiding other bases.

*\/* LOCATION *\/*

Location is EVERTHING when looking for a place to build your base. There are good
and bad locations for a base. For example a good location would be on top of a hill and
a bad location would be at the base of a hill or in a gully. Finding the best location for 
the type of base you want to build is crucial to the survival of your base. The area you 
choose though can't have too many trees unless a tree base is to be built, this ensures
good cover for hiding your base but also means it is easier to clear and saves you time for
the construction of your base.

*\/* BASE PREPARATION *\/*

Preparing the the area for your base does help when it comes time to construction of your
base. The type of preparation maybe clearing and leveling the ground, cutting down only a
few trees or de-branching some trees for high built bases. Leave some trees around the
base as this will provide defence. DO NOT make any obvious paths leading to or from
the area which your base will be located, this will lead unwanted visitors such as rangers,
girl guides or people out for a walk. These people WILL tell authorities exactly where they
found your base, It will be torn down and taken to the local waste centre.

*\/* MATERIALS *\/*

Finding the materials for your base can be easy or hard depending on how you look at the
situation. First the explanation of the easy way, go talk to your local anarchists and see if
they can obtain the materials required for your base. Use this method if you want a qucik
way to get your materials without you getting introuble for any stolen goods. Now for the
explanation of the hard way, you can go out and buy a garden shed from your local hardware 
store or use what ever you have laying around your house, next door neighbours are also
a good source of materials. The materials can be what ever you want but make sure its light,
can be carried by one to two people at the most and make sure it isnt so big that people will
question you as you are lugging the materials through the bush.

*\/* BUILDING THE BUSH BASE *\/*

Building your base can be simple but also can end up a dissaster. Make sure you have all the
materials at the site where your base will be built, If all materials are not there you will find that
progress on building will be slow and painfull. An important tip to remember is make your base
so it can be dismantled and easily carried to a new location if it is found by rangers or 
who ever. If the ground has to be leveled use the proper tools for the job and dont pour 
concrete because this can't be transported easily and takes more time. Also if found by 
rangers you will get intotrouble with the law for destruction of the natural enviroment. 
A tip for speeding up the construction is to get some of your most trustworthy friends to help 
you as all this work can't possibly done on your own. When leveling the ground, make 
a mud and straw mixture (cut grass will also do) and spread it about 2cm on the leveled 
ground and let to sit for a few days. This makes the best base to build and can be destroyed 
if your base is found.

*\/* PROTECTING YOUR BASE *\/*

Protecting your base is easy but also takes some skill to hide traps and so forth so any attackers
can't find them. The first line of defence is the old but effective trip wire, you can use just 
about any line but i find the most effective is Hoochie Cord which can be purchased at your 
local disposal store or camping store. Hoochie Cord is good because it blends in with the 
leaf litter and ground in the bush or forest, It also can streched for a tighter line. The way in 
which this is done, First tie one end to a tree or stake or what ever you have to fix it to then 
pull it tight and wrap it around the other fixture about 3 times and tie it off. Don't let the tension 
off because the line will slack. Another line of defense is falling trap, this is done by rigging a trip 
wire on teh ground and then leading it up to a bundle of sticks or rocks in a tree so when the trip 
wire is triped the rocks or sticks will come down onto the attacker. To hide your base really well 
in the forest or bush, while visiting the disposal store for Hoochie Cord also ask if they sell 
Camoflouge Netting. If they do sell it then buy the biggest one they have or that your budget 
allows, If they ask any questions as to why you want to purchase it just tell them you are having 
a themed party or something to that effect. Once you have your Cam Netting go throw it over 
your base and make it look like part of the terrain that way if your base is spotted from a long 
distance away it will be ignored and thought as a hill or rocky out crop. It does not matter what 
sort of traps you put in to secure your base just make sure they are well hidden. Also to secure 
anything you want to leave behind, put a lock on the door to your base or pull up the ladder to your 
base if it is built high or you can dig a hole and put what you are hiding in a air tight container then 
bury it, then mark it with a stick or something. Not many people would actually think to look in the 
ground for valubles.

*\/* RAIDING *\/*

Raiding is what every person who has a base looks forward to. First thing to remember 
and always follow is PLAN all raids on other peoples bases, because if you do not plan then 
your attack could lead to you being attacked. Start by staking out a known enemies base for
a few days so you and your party knows where all the traps are and if there is any permanent
residents. Once the planing is done make your attack at night when the enemy isn't around,
this insures a fast and successfull raid without the threat of attack. Break into the base and take
anything that isn't nailed down, that includes the base itself. also check the ground for out of place
stones or sticks as these are markings for hidden items that the enemy doesn'y want you to
find. If you can get all the gear that you want back to your base in one or two trips then you have
successfully completed a raid, not only does taking all the enemies stuff and their base itself
cripple them but it also strengthens your base as you can build onto it with the newly obtained 
materials or you can use it for fire wood.
