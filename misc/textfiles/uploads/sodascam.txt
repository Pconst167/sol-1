Materials required-

1 can of soda or candy or whatever
1 telephone
1 brain(optional)

You know those phone numbers on the sides of the soda cans or candy wrappers? The ones that say "Call for consumer information".  Well, people also call to report damaged cans that came in a pack, or if a candy tasted terrible or something.  If you call the consumer information number, and say that the can was leaky or the candy tasted awful, the company will send you a free pack of the company's merchandise!  They have no way to know that you are lying.  My friend and I called Coke and said we had bought a 24 pack but that one of the cans was empty, and they sent us two free twelve pack coupouns!  Do it to any company you want, although be sure not to call the same company more than once or twice to send to the same adress.  They'll get suspicius and do something, I don't know what, but you could get busted.

Oh, yeah, the disclaimer:  If you get busted its your fault not mine you have to be pretty stupid to be busted in this scam.  This file is for information purposes only and is not to be used in an abusive or harmful way blah blah blah and so on.
