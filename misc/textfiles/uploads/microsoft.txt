One of the biggest conspiracys in the world right now is most likely 
Microsoft.
Microsoft is out to get us and they will not stop over populating the 
software community.
Some of you may have recently been FORCED to download sercive pack 2, 
because it is
supposed to be much more secure. But what they don't tell you is that by 
installing
service pack 2 you are aggreeing to give them full acces to you computer, 
install third party
clients, adn delete all of your pirated software. Why do they delete all 
pirated software?
Because they manufacture, some how, half of the software on the market, and 
the want all the
profit. So DO NOT install SERVICE PACK 2.
