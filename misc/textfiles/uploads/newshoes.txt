What you need
=================

some dry mud
optional:water(depends if it’s raining on the day you go and try this)
fake trainers(recommended fake)

What you do
=================

.right first go and buy some cheap (fake) trainers off the market
.then go into the shop that has the real version of the trainers you have on a busy day with your fake versions on
.make sure your laces are tight and in double knots
.now go into the store and ask an employee if you can try on the real trainers you want
.since they’re in double knots and it’s a busy day he won’t wait around to see you put them on(exactly how we want it)
.now simply put on the real trainers and switch them with the fake ones
.now if your fake ones were muddy put mud on your new real ones and if it was raining put a tiny bit of water on them
.now if you can try to clean up the fake ones with water to make them look new then do it,it’s extra sneaky but if you haven’t that much time then just casually walk out of the store with the new ones on
.then run once you have got a few footsteps out and away from the shop
