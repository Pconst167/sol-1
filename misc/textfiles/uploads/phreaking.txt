                                        MODERN beige box

now let me get started. ok first of all, like you i enjoy panning through 
text files looking
for cool shit to do. well a while ago i was at www.textfiles.com and i saw 
plans on how to
construct a biege box. the idea of making calls through other peoples lines 
sounded cool so i
did the necessary adjustments to my phone then i went outside to look for 
the phone box on the
side of the house so i could test out my new linemans handset. i climbed up
to the box once i found it. _i immediatley saw that it wasnt so simple. the 
screw holding the lid
down was like an allan key screw (hex screw) with a notch in the middle of 
the hollow so the
allan key would have to be hollow. no im not sure if its like this in other 
countries but thats
the way it is in australia qld. maybe its only with the people who got optus 
recently (i got it
a couple of years ago). but i finally got the box to work even though it 
cost me another phone
cord. so i thought id write this file so people know how simple it is to 
make free calls.



                                           materials

                                   $20 (thats in australia)
                    a spare phone (i used the one that came with optus)
                                           THATS IT!


                                           HOW To

now first go down to your nearest tandys or any good shop and look for a 
security bit and socket
set. dont ask em if theyve got it because thatll be suss and they probably 
wont sell it to ya.
just go in there and browse about antil you find it. i didnt think the 
little fag at the counter
was gonna sell it to me but he did. you should be able to pick one up for 
about $20 and it comes
with a whole rang of goodies including: security torx bits, security hex 
bits, tri-wing bits,
spanner (slotted) bits, security hex bits (imperial sizes), torque bits, hex 
nut sockets and a
right angle driver. thats a 42 piece set and to me that seems like a pretty 
good deal. im not
sure what a lot of these are for (the tri wing ones are what buildings use 
to screw bolts into
the wall:) but where gonna use the metric security hex bit. now look for the 
box on the side of
your house its normally cream coloured. if you cant find it follow the phone 
line from were you
plug the phone in. once yuv found it open it up and find where it says test 
line (there should be
a plug in it) then plug in ya phone and check to see if it works. if it 
doesnt then make sure
the line is properly connected to the phone and the phone box if it does 
work wait till dark then
run down the road to to some fags house and connect your phone in. if you 
can hear them talking
rip out the line and run. if there is knowone on the phone then call the 
cops and chat to him a
while about how your gonna kill him and rape his mum to death;)
any way whatever you do have fun.
