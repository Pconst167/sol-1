ok, i would say that this is for info purposes, but i know damn well that most 
people who come here want ideas on how to make weapons. i aint taking responsibility
 for anyone blowing themselves up or getting third degree burns either, so make sure
 u know what ur doing, aight?




what u will need:

two tennis balls

gun powder

snappers (those things u buy on the 4th of july and throw em on the ground)

gasoline

a long string

paint or some other way to color the tennis balls (optional for camoflauge)



directions:

ok first take the tennis balls and cut a small hole in each, then fill the tennis 
balls with gun powder. then add five to ten snappers in each tennis ball and seal
up the holes. then super glue the string to both tennis balls. now dip the tennis 
balls in gasoline (dont soak, just dip them for about five seconds). now, if u want
to camoflauge them so people cant see, add paint or whatever. now, just attach them 
to two trees. when someone trips the string, the tennis balls will hit the ground 
and the snappers will snap inside the tennis balls, causing the gun powder to 
explode and the gas will ignite. whoever tripped the string will be in a world of 
hurt, i can guarantee that

it should look something like this:
