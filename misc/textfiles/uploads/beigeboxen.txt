     (6):Plug the cord into the fone, you have just build a beige box.


 ________
(Using It):

This device can be any
of several Bell switching apparatus that include terminal sets 
(i.e., remote switching centers, bridging heads, cans, etc.)  To open 
most Bell Telefone switching apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex 
driver.  This piece of equipment can be picked up at your local 
hardware store.  With your 7/16 hex driver, turn the security bolt(s) 
approximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clock- wise and open.  
If your output device is locked, then you must have some knowledge 
of destroying and/or picking locks.  However, we have never encoun-
tered a locked output device.  Once you have opened your output device, you
should see a mass of wires connected to terminals.  On most of your output
devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip -- if not labeled, it is
usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not labeled, it is usually on the
right).  Remember: Ring - red -  right.  The "Three R's" -- a simple way to
remember which is which. Now you must attach the red alligator 
clip (ring) to the "R" (ring) terminal.  Attach the green 
alligator clip (tip) to the "T" (tip) terminal.

Now your box is basicly a phone of the building the box you attached 
your box to. You can ease drop on conversations in that building, make 
free calls etc. Its up to you what do do with your box.
