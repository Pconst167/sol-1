this one is real easy.

press zero and wait for the operator on the payphone.

tell them u are having trouble dialing a number- they will reply: "sorry,
what number please" and u give them the number...and they will patch it
through.

if you really want to con out the phone company, call the repair line
(located at the bottom of the payphone) and tell them it ate your money.
after the frequency coin release..tell them nothing came out.  they will ask
for an address to send 'credits' to.  they send you a check for the amount u
say it ate.

have fun- dont spread this too fast..leave some for the newbies.  we've all
been there ^_^
