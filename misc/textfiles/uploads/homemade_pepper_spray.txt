HOMEMADE PEPPER SPRAY
BY: DIzzIE Ó'99 (YEAY! GO DIzzIE !!!!!)

Ok, there is a very simple way to make homemade pepper spray, or the equivalent of it. Most of you probably know this, but for our special readers:

A)	Go and buy some marinated jalapeno peppers. Pour the marinated juice into a super soaker or one of them spray bottles. Then go out spray people, huhhuh.
B)	Same as above except use bleach.
C)	Get a can of spray paint, or oven cleaner.
D)	Beat up a drunken cop and take his pepper spray.
