TOP 10 REASONS TO KILL YOURSELF
BY: DIzzIE  Ó1999

1.	You are going to die anyways, so you might as well get it over with now.
2.	Your life sucks. It may appear at times like you're really having fun, but all good things eventually lead to bad things.
3.	You have no friends and no one likes you. It may appear like they do, but they are only using you to get what they want, because all human beings are naturally selfish and shall remain selfish, no matter how hard they try not to be.
4.	Come on……………you know you want to………..just get your old man's rifle………..
5.	What is really the point of living? Think about that for a little while. You go through life, doing all those things you do, WHY? Just so you can die in the end anyway?
6.	Haven't you ever wondered what death would feel like? There are sooooooo many possibilities: reincarnation, being a ghost, heaven/hell, etc…
7.	You will never have to worry about anything anymore, all your problems shall be solved. BLISS! Bliss, I tell ya. 
8.	Life is one misery after another = school: homework, than work: more "homework," never any free time, but with death = all the free time you ever wanted!
9.	You might meet some interesting people wherever you go (if anywhere), when you die, maybe not people at all, but other beings.
10.	WHY THE HELL NOT?
