 Ah, good old dumpster divin'. No, I'm not talking about jumping in a dumpster
behind McDonalds. I'm talking about recycling bins. Those big industrial sized
motherfuckers that big recycling companies use for collecting from a city.
Check around your town/city to see if they provide such great services. If they
do, look for a recycling bin with newspapers and magazines in it. If they do 
have one of these treasure holds, then keep on reading!
 First off, check to make sure there is no one watching or nor are there any 
cameras nearby. If all is well . . .
Go inside the thing! Then look around. Dig around a bit. Sooner or later, you
can find all sorts of great magazines, catalogs, free newspapers, and if you're 
lucky, free porn. I as a diver have found HUNDREDS of neat-o catalogs, and lots 
of porn mags. It was totally free. I saved time and money not dealing with 
mailing for a catalog with a simple dive. Hell, I found shit that I didn't even
know was for sale or in print! If you find a mega load of magazines and stuff, 
get a paper bag from the bin. Trust me. You'll run into fifty paper bags in that 
thing. It's not hard to find one.
