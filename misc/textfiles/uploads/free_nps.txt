FREE NEWSPAPERS
By: DIzzIE          keepin' it free 4 all 

So you want to save your self a buck or to, you know a buck isn't worth a lot to a lot of people but to us a buck is just enough to keep us on parole. So anyway here is a nice quick 'n' simple  way to get yourself a free newspaper

All you have to do is get up around 5 or 6 am and get your lazy ass outside and look for a house that has a newspaper lying in its' front yard then just take the newspaper and head on home. Do this everyday or whenever you need a paper.

If you can't find anybody who has a newspaper, then why not subscribe thy neighbor to one, and just get it from him. So he doesn't know what's going on when he gets the bill.

A final method is just going to the library and reading the newspaper there. They usually don't put those pesky magnetic strips on the newspapers so you can just put them in your bag an wonder off……..
