This is a general FAQ for the movie Minority Report, this by no means has
official answers, though some may very well be official.


[1. WHY DIDN'T ANDERTON GO BLIND WHEN SCANNED BY THE SPIDERS?]
In the movie clearly the time (12 hours) for recovery of the eye swap has
not been met. The spider scans him, yet after this part there is no 
indication that he has been blinded at all. 

The most pausable theory is that the time frame is a general frame for
the eye recovery just as a saftey precaution. Alternatively he may have
been told 12 hours to keep him there longer so that the cops would be
more likely to get him.


[2. WHY WAS ANDERTON FRAMED IN THE FIRST PLACE?]
Anderton started questioning the death of Anne Lively, Burgess saw this
as a threat of him getting caught so he had him setup to try to put the
threat away.


[3. WHY WAS ANDERTONS ACCESS TO PRECRIME STILL AVAILABLE AFTER HE IS A
    SUSPECT TO MURDER?]
Interestingly there really is no answer to this...someone was apparently
too lazy to disable access. Even after capture the access still works.

[4. WHY WAS ANDERTON'S BALL BROWN INDICATING PRE-MEDITATED?]
The crime was pre-meditated, when John finds the pictures of his son he
makes the statement... "For 6 years, I've thought of two things, the
first is what my son would look like if he were alive today if I would
recognize him on the street..and the second what I'd do to the man who
took him. You're right, I'm not being framed, I am going to kill this
man." This indicates he thought about killing him BEFORE the actual
confrontation happens.

[5. I'VE HEARD THAT THE ENDING IS ACTUALLY JOHN'S DREAM IN THE MACHINE
    WHEN HE IS CAPTURED WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE?]
Towards the end of the movie John is captured, a Halo is put on his head
and he is put into a tube that goes under. At this point the prison guard
states that the prisoner can essentially make up his own world. This may
imply that after Andertons capture we just see his dream and NOT what
really happened.

[6. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS A MINORITY REPORT?]
There are 3 precogs, most of the time they all see the same thing. However,
in rare events 1 precog can see something different from the others, this
is called the Minority report.

[7. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ANDERTON'S SON?]
We do not know exactly what happened to Anderton's son. Throughout the movie
we are brought to believe that he is either a) alive, b) dead or c) precog..
but neither of these are solid to pick just one.
