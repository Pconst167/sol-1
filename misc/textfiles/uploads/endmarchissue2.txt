				2. Thought and Opinion >>>
	
	a. School & Society: 

		I have to admit I try hard in school. I kept a 3.5 GPA 
throughout last semester. So what are my opinions on school..? I despise school. School
destroys our inner true personality and makes us slaves to the whole "school system"

All throughout my school career I have been told that if I don't do well in educating
myself, then I won't succeed later on in life. I'm really not into the whole "School
Sucks" thing just because its against authority and just a rebellious thing to do.

I think school could be a great thing, if it was changed to suit the best interest
of the students attending. I'm not talking about school here.. I'm talking about
schools all over the U.S. or possibly all over the world. The whole damn system should
be rearranged and recreated.  I'm sure that things will
never ever change, but I'll just add my personal opinion anyway. 

There are people who are extremely smart yet do poorly in school. There are kids who are 
extremely stupid and get average/good grades.

Here are my beliefs on school and society:
classified by how hard they try or how energetic they are. Background environments and
living conditions are taken into respect when a child gets graded. Teachers allow room
for all types of thought and opinion. Teachers are re-evaluated once every three months.
School should not interfere with the lives of children. School systems should be more 
strict to help enforce education and learning. Private schools, Magnet Schools, or schools
dedicated to a cause such as art or religion should be abolished.  The programs that these
schools deliver should be introduced into the regular public school system. This will help
place all students in the U.S. on one social level and prevent discrimination . 

All schools should provide uniforms. Uniforms will also help prevent discrimination  because it
will make everyone the same. Children who stand apart from other children should be forced to
become like other children. Children with hair other than black and eyes a color other than brown 
should be provided with hair dye and contact lenses.

Once kids are stripped of all forms of expression, they will be forced to express themselves in
other ways. This will help encourage all children, even the ones that weren't so eager to learn
before, to do better in school. 

			
				- The previous article was meant to be ironic.
					In my view these are the steps that
					should be taken to create an utopian 
					school society, which points to the fact
					that it is impossible to have a utopian
					school society since a. it is human nature
					to rebel against laws. b. people will think
					America is turning into a communist state.
					BOOO!!!

	
	b. More on War

		http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/17/sprj.irq.main/index.html
Oh god! Bush is attempting to declare war on St. Pattys dad! that mofo.. Well that's
all been said before. I don't know how many of you know this.. But I will now
attempt to enlighten you: Even if there were no weapons of Mass Destruction in
Iraq, Bush would still try to find a way to go for war because Bush seeks vengeance
on Sadaam, and he also wants the oil. He does it all for the oil. All I want is
for gas prices to go down.. :~(

Iraq itself is no threat to the U.S. they have no aircraft carriers and there
is no way their 98 mi range missiles  could ever hit any target on the U.S., thus
Iraq poses no threat to the U.S.. What does pose a threat is the pawns of Sadaam
and Muslim terrorist groups living in America. This is the real worry my people. 
Sadaam will try to start a war from the inside of America using his loyal suicidal
fellows as soldiers.

Lastly, what concerns ME right now that, one of Americas allies: Israel: is 
the closest American ally to Iraq. Thus, Sadaam and his forces may invade Israel
which is the biggest threat.

Oh yeah also, N. Korea will throw a surprise bombing our way any day now..

	                (%) GETTING BUSTED (%)
		    (%) an experience and a warning (%)

		       ^^  By  Paranoid Punkpig  ^^
			--- Resident (415) Bum ---


I'm sure most of you have done some kinds of illegal activity, and betcha
might've gotten arrested..  Lemmie tell ya, getting arrested is no joke:
you're parents get notified, and they are told of the activity you were doing
(in my case, fucking around with fire in a condemed building).	You also get a
record (you go on file down at the nearest police station, and you might get
kicked out of school..	First lemmie lay it all out for ya:

It was a Friday night, and it was just after a school dance, and, as usual, i
was disappointed as hell (i go to a pretty tame school).  Me and a friend
decided to, rather than hang around with a bucha people, go investigate this
old shopping mall that was being torn down by school..	we had both been by
there many times, but had never considered entering the damn thing..  what a
mistake that was!  First off, it was dark, and we didn't have a flashlight
(duhh...  who carries a flashlight with them?!), anywaze, so we had to use
newspaper, and light it...  THAT was the first mistake, cuz there was so much
smoke, some fucking rent-a-cop saw it pouring out of the building, and thought
it was a fuckin' fire!!  So, there we were, not knowing that outside, there
were about a dozen cops, about to enter the building..	We were having the time
of our lives, fucking around:  going around in an abandoned shopping mall can
be cool, try it!!  Finally, after about an hour, the smoke started gettin' to
us, and we decided to leave...	anywayze, it was past 1:00 and this was when i
didn't and couldn't drive, so i needed to walk home (another hour)..  we then
proceeded to leave when we heard the cops opening the exit door (the ONLY exit
door!!)...  at the time, we were right by the door, kinda behind it, so that
they didn't know that we were there..  We put the "torches" out fast as hell,
but still, there were some cinders, and, the cops spotted it, and us...

Then, they shined their flashlights in our faces, and started sayin' stuff
like:  "Whatcha doin' here, punks?" "What're ya doin with fire, you fuckin'
assholes?!" etc..  Oh yeah, they asked our ages, and we said 11..  that was
cool as hell, cuz they relaxed then, cuz they didn't think that 11 year olds
would try anything...  (keep that in mind..  if you get busted, then act
scared, as if you wouldn't do anythnig, and the cops will *RELAX*)..  they then
did the old feel routine, where they see if you have any guns, knives, etc.  on
you...	They didn't check us out very thoroughly, tho, cuz my friend had a
knife in his denim, which the cops didn't find.  They took us outside, to the
"meter-maid-mobile" (you know, the little three wheelers that meter maids use),
and were about to cuff us..  (yeah, at age 13!!) anywaze, that's when my friend
said, "R-U-N-!", at which point we both jammed!!  shit, i ran so fast, you
wouldn't believe it!  the cops yelled something like "stop, or we'll shoot",
but that's a buncha shit, cuz we were just kids...  cops cant shoot people
unless they pose a threat to the cop...  we ran, and ran, and ran and ran....
and we made it home ok without getting busted by the cops, BUT!  somehow, they
got a look at us, and about 2 weeks later, the same cops (we were walkin' by
school again), saw us, and recognized us...  they brought us
in..............but dat's another story...

			5. On the subject of Creativity >>>

	How hate breeds creation: I'm most happiest when I'm in the middle of 
something. When I'm in the middle of something great. A project, a poem, a story,
a movie, a book. Im working and it and I'm looking forward to finishing it.
I haven't been writing for too long but I've realized that when I express myself 
things are revealed to me. I learn something new. 

Writing is a form of expression. When the pen starts working all the excess 
energy arong is directed into the pen. When I'm done with a piece I feel complete and relieved. 
Then comes the urge to start something new. 

So I decided to start this ezine. When you paint, or write,
or do whatever you do to let your emotions out you let go of creative energy.
I believe that creative energy not put into use slowly becomes destructive
energy. So be free.. be creative..

		6. The Communist Manifesto: Brief intro to Karl Marx >>>

	Karl Marx was the father of the Scientific Socialism theory. In
1848, with the assistance of Friedrich Engels, Marx published the Communist
Manifesto.

He stated that economics was the driving force in history. Marx was against
capitalism. He believed it brought good only for some, and left many others
in poverty. Marxism was later embraced by Russians, who put his ideas to use
in the forming of the Soviet Union.

		7. Lyrics to "Silenced" by Mudvayne >>>


	I felt that this song goes along with this issue of basement so here 
are the lyrics. I highly suggest you download this song if you are into Nu
Metal. The guys of mudvayne are truly gods of music.



				"Silenced"

Sticker this, censor this, ban this
We've got something to say
Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm silenced...

Listen here...

Is it a possibility?
That we're all just equal, 
Slam the power down
Abusing...
Does it pss you off to be beat at your own game
You lead us with false morals and shelter reality
No more...we're not buying your product when
You're selling
The words preaching silence

Insult me in my home,
When you were never invited,
To live life on your curve
Frustrating,
Throw sticks into the spokes,
To relieve insecurities,
Stifle all ascension and sticker our freedom
Of speech

Sticker this, censor this, ban this
We've got something to say
Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm silenced...

Don't tell me what I want 
Don't tell me what I need
Don't tell me how I need to feel
I feel, goddamn nothing
Dig the eyes out of my face and I can still see right
Fuckin' through you,
Fuck you and everything you are,
I'm me, we're us and that's all
Closed mind with a forum to criticize,
Keep your policy and I've got mine
Exploit me, fabricate your lies
We empower these cowards just to be left in 
Silence

Listen here...

Stand on my soapbox, 
And speak my own peace,
Whatever you may think,
It's real, 
Prevail through what is me,
And step on your beliefs
Thieving spineless sellouts, robbing our integrity

Sticker this, censor this, ban this
We've got something to say
Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm ...
