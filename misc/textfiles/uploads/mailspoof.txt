Wouldn't it be so funny to play a prank on one of your buddies by sending 
him/her an outrageous E-mail from a spooky E-mail like root@fbi.gov? Well 
your prayers have been answered. All you need to do is find a SMTP(Simple 
Mail Transfer Protocol) server that has the relaying option ON and you're 
all set for you evil crimes. :) Most likely you'll find a NS(Name Server) 
thats running a SMTP with relay ON. Below i'll show you step-by-step on how 
to send ereet spoofed E-Mail.

1) Telnet to a server that has SMTP running with the relay option ON.(i.e 
telnet 207.244.117.1 25)

2) Next you type: helo x.x. (i.e helo fbi.gov)

3) Once you're done you need to type in the MAIL FROM part which will be the 
SENDER. (i.e MAIL FROM: root@fbi.gov)

4) When you're done you type in the RCPT(the person receiving the E-mail). 
(i.e RCPT TO: lamer@aol.com)

5) Now you start entering the body(message), you will need to type DATA then 
enter your msg and once you're done put a "." in a seperate line to stop the 
body and send the E-mail.  (.ie DATA
					       This is my spoof E-Mail that you are pj33ring about!@#
					       .
													)

6) Log out of the SMTP by typing quit
