1.1 - DISCLAIMER: THIS FILE CONTAINS INFORMATION. HOW YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS INFORMATION IS UP TO YOU AND I WILL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS! - Oreo Ctrl


1.2 - INTRODUCTION: Firstly, to start hacking you must know what it is. Hacking is anytime one attempts to bypass the security of electronic system, computer or otherwise. I will be writing about computer system hacking. The two methods that will be discussed in this file are "Brute Force" hacking, and the finding of security holes. There are many methods for hacking computer systems. The "Brute Force" method is useless against any system that has passwords that are not easily going to be guessed. Brute force hacking is basically repeatedly trying to crack the password. However, it is crucial that any hacker knows how to use brute force hacking. This method will be discussed later in the next sub section. The other method that will be discussed is finding security loopholes. By finding security loop holes you can much more easily access the system as a whole. Security loopholes are basically fuck-ups in the security programming. This is the real way to hack. You see if you can master computer hardware and software, then you can find these loop holes. Loopholes will be discussed later in section 4.2. 

Section 2 - LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN

2.1 - GETTING STARTED: Hacking is not like the movie. Many hackers will say that the movie "Hackers" is lame, but I think it was very cool. Hacking movies such as "Hackers", "War Games", and the like were like magnets for the hacker underground community. Many hackers including myself began their involvement with computers because of movies. My original alias was ZeRO, derived from my AOL SN, "Coolzero", which was derived from "ZeroCool". Now I go by Oreo Ctrl. However, whatever your reason for getting involved with computer manipulation and security analysis, I welcome you. Most systems will not give you a graphical interface like in Hackers. Your interface with the victim systems will be more like the interface of DOS. Although, as you gain experience and knowledge, you will come to appreciate the speed accompanied by a lack of graphics. Now that you are aware of what hacking is like, let us continue. 

2.2 - TOOLS: I am not talking about programs that hack for you. These programs help you to see information from various points of views. Depending on what type of system you are attempting to hack, you will need different types of software and hardware. Here are a few to get you started. 


* - You need these if you are using a laptop w/ a portable modem or at another location.
** - Always have available
+ - Usually already installed on a system, but just in case keep on disk.
! - Usually already installed on a system, no need to keep on a disk.
~ - For smokers only

Note: DO NOT HACK FROM YOUR HOUSE, AND NEVER DISCUSS YOUR ACTIVITIES WITH ANYONE!

---Software---
A free ISP on a CD/floppy! * (Do not use one that requires your name to be registered.)
FTP!
Telnet **
NOT the program called Jammer.exe, get a commercial or other high quality firewall. 
Terminal (preferably, Hyper Terminal) **
Hex Editor **
Program(s) that can ping, finger, and/or trace. **
---Hardware---
A public telephone*
3.5" floppy disks **
---Other Stuff---
Marijuana, and papers or a blunt (cigar) or a pipe ~
Lighter ~
And something to wash it all down. ~

A free ISP - You need one of these because you need an Internet connection that will allow you to sign on anonymously.

FTP - This program allows you to connect to FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Servers. 

Telnet - This program allows you to connect to bbs's (bulletin board systems), to telnet sessions, and to ports that allow telnet connections.

A Firewall - A program that protects your computer from being hacked

Terminal or HyperTerminal - You just need one of them. These programs are similar to Telnet, but are far more advanced. This program allows you to connect to ports on other computers (PC's and other types) directly, with out an Internet connection.

Hex Editor - This program allows you to read files in hexadecimal format.

Ping Program - Allows you to ping a specific IP address.

Finger Program - Allows you to finger a specific IP address.

Trace Program - Allows you to trace a specific IP address.

A public telephone - You need this to hook your laptop up to so you can hack from a location other than your own home. Now if they trace you, just worry about getting the fuck outta there. 

3.5" Floppy Disks - You need these to record your logs on. 

Marijuana, papers or a pipe, a lighter, and drink - Let us think about it
