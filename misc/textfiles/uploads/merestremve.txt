System Restore is a vital system in Windows ME it will automatically back up
configuration files at certain times which if something should go wrong you
can use system restore later. The problem with system restore comes with the
fact that it tends to lag a system with little ram as well as take up those
valuable system resources. Its recommended that if you aren't good at taking
care of your computer you keep this system in tact. Note that also it will 
stop System File Protection from working, but you can use 3rd party 
applications that will remove system restore and keep system file protection
on.
