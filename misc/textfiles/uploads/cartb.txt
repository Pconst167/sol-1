Disclaimer:if you get in any sort of trouble arrested, sued etc. 
it's not my fault your dumbass got caught this is purley for inphormational
purposes. Say you lock your keys in your car, you may get them doing this.
Enjoy this simple text phile.

Have you ever noticed the keyhole on the driver side door underneath the the
handle?Ever noticed how you can push it down?Well here we go then my fellow
anarchist.

first off heat the kniphe till it can penatrate then tennis ball. After that
,penetrate the tennis ball to make a hole the size of the keyhole of
the car your going to get your 'keys' phrom (wink wink).after that go 2
the car and line the whole on the tennis ball up with the keyhole and
press phirmly.It may take a phew tries but it WILL open i tested this on
 cars with electric locks etc.It depends on the model of the of the car
,but sum will still sound the alarm.
