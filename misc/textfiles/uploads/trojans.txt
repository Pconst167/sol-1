                                                              How to use Trojan Horses

  This is a "How to.." guide explaining the best and more useful way of using tro-
  yan horses.I won't teach how to use trojan horses cause their options are easy to use and don't 
  need to be explained.I'll talk about things different from deleting someone's hard drive there are 
  MUCH better ways to make his life impossible to live in.Yeah I'll talk about this in this guide.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
I hope you know what trojan horse is if you don't know I'll explain you what is trojan horse

*Note for newbies
A trojan horse is
An unauthorized program contained within a legitimate program. 
This unauthorized program performs functions
unknown (and probably unwanted) by the user.
A legitimate program that has been altered by the placement of 
unauthorized code within it; this code performs
functions unknown (and probably unwanted) by the user.
Any program that appears to perform a desirable and necessary function but that
(because of unauthorized code within it that is unknown to the user) performs 
functions unknown (and probably unwanted) by the user. 
******************************************************************************************
So you now have some definitions what trojan horse is I hope you understand them.So first of all
you must have all trojans clients cause you don't know what trojan client you'll need sometime.
You must have both the new and old trojans clients.You must know all trojans ports so you can see
with which one is your victim infected here I'll post some trojans ports.
*Trojan ports
Netbus(Default)-12345 TCP
Back Orifice (Default)-31337 UDP
WinCrash 1.03-5742 TCP
WinCrash 2.0-2583 TCP
Deep Throat-2140 TCP
Silencer-1001 TCP
Sockets de Troie-30303 TCP
Devil-65000 TCP
Girlfriend-21554 TCP
Millenium-20001 TCP
Masters Paradise-31 TCP
Phineas-2801 UDP
BackDoor-1999 TCP
Back Orifice-31336 UDP
Evil FTP-23456 TCP
Executor and HTTP-80 TCP
FTP-21 TCP
******************************************************************************************
You see your victim is infected with one of them.Now It depends on the trojan the victim is 
infected but the most trojans
have the common functions like start a keylogger,FTP access full downloading and uploading, set
a password on the victims computer so only you can use it,even change the port of the machine.
Of course there're many other options but I'll talk about this one now.
      So you see the victim is infected with Netsphere cause port 30100 is open(this is just an 
example the victim can be infected with Sub7,Netbus,BOK200,Master Paradise and any other
trojan but this what I'll talk about is for EVERY trojan horse Remote Access of course
Now you must find Netsphere's client on your hard drive if you don't have it download it 
from the net. Every site talking about hacking and trojans have it.Let's suppose you found the tro-
jan client (I advice you to have all the trojans clients on your hard drive so you don't have to 
look for them).
Now simple connect to the victim and the first thing you MUST do if you want the victum only for
you is to set a password on the victim's computer and change the port. Of course is letting you to
do this. Most of the trojans let you to do such things. Now you should check for cached passwords
cause many people are saving their passwords. Now the important part the only one thing some
people like and they're using the trojans- The Victim's Hard Drive. You can find a lot of useful
information there cause this is someone's computer everything about him/her is there waiting
for you to get it. 
 DON'T delete anything. THis is the most stupid thing but EVERYONE is doing it. I understand you
want to destroy your victim but there are MUCH MORE BETTER ways to do this and believe me 
there are more effective. Everyone can deletes someone hard drive but this is not interesting.You
may find MANY interesting things on the victim's hard drive.
 So you're on their hard drive. Now you MUST look you any anti-virus or trojan scanner on their
drive.I hope you know the most trojan and virus scanners. Norton AntiVirus,The Cleaner,LockDown
F-prot,AntiViral Toolkit,Avast 32 etc.
Now search their drive in the program files directory for such tools.Of course there are many other
but you'll see the names in the directory and decide if this you find is something like the above
things. Now let's suppose you found something on their drive. Go there and delete only some DAT
DLL or EXE files. This will make the program not working but the other files will be still there. So
the victim won't think someone deletes anything. He'll just reinstall the program and then install it
again. Then you'll again delete it and again...... This is not good cause the victim can always install
the program scan his drive and then connect to the net. He'll clean the hard drive and then you won't
be able to connect to him.

  You may try to get everything about him in one evening or morning only.Then he may scan and 
clean the trojan but you'll have everything you want about the victim.

*Note 
Believe me when someone is infected is he or she had a trojan cleaner they'll be clean. They are 
still infected that means that they're a real newbies and don't know what trojan horse is. I'll advice
you to use THE NEWEST trojan that are not detectable by the virus and trojan scanners.
******************************************************************************************
 Most people are talking via IRC (Internet Relay Chat).But if they give the option to the IRC client
to log everything this will be useful for you.

*Note
If the victim didn't give the client option to log everything you can find him on IRC and meet him
then talk a little and then ask him to do this.But don't forget to tell him what he'll win if he do this.
This is vEry important.Tell him that he'll be able to read then all of his logs with his friends.Now
he'll do it.
******************************************************************************************
Now go in the MIRC\logs directory on the victims hard drive (he might change the directory but
you'll find it I'm sure). There you'll find all of this conversations with his friends now download all
logs in the directory.The when you're off-line you'll read them and see who are the victims best 
friends.See if they told him important and secret things.If you find something go on IRC and find
his friend and tell all the things you know to him/her.They'll ask you who told these secret things.
Tell them it was their "friend" your victum.Haha I think this is BETTER than deleting files.But 
there's more. Now you must see his other friends on ICQ.GO in the ICQ directory in NEwDB directo-
ry and download all .dat files there's his password and all the things he talked with his friends.
Take the password and his contact list and start talking stupid things to his friends. After this you'll
leave you victim without friends. This is better than deleting I told you.
    Now go and search for something interesting on his hard-drive. There're a lot of people who wri-
tes their passwords on their computer web page passwords,e-mail passwords and other. Search
for something like IMPORTANT directory or something like that. There you'll find interesting things
IF you find password hack his web page and e-mail address. This will destroy him believe me.
 Well there are the things which are better then deleting everything believe me when someone
loose all of his friends,his e-mail address,his web page and important information on his hard-drive
YOU ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

That's the guide but there'll me more and more just keep reading if you like the guide or you have

Bye and I hope this guide will be useful for you.As I told you I'm only telling you how to do this
not to do it. I don't take any responsibility about anything happened after reading this guide.
