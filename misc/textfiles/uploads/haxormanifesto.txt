The New UK Hacker's Manifesto (Y2K)

The Conscience of a Hacker Y2K version

By +++The Lamor+++
 
Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in 
Mobile Phone Scam", "Hacker Arrested after Newsgroup Flood"... Damn kids. 
They're all alike.
 
But did you, sat behind your prehistoric command line with your stupid, geeky 
1980's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you 
ever wonder what made him thick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded 
him?
 
I am a h4X0R, enter my world...
 
Mine is a world that begins with bunking off school... I'm better than most 
of the other kids, all they got for christmas was stupid furbies...
 
Spoilt Bastard. They're all alike.
 
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the 
fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I don't understand it. "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't do my work. I stood outside the off-license all night
drinking alcopops..."
 
Damn kid. He's so goddam cool. I wish I was like him.
 
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. I 
can impress my mates with my elite IRC skillz. If it makes a mistake, it's 
because It's been haxored up. Not because it doesn't like me... Everybody 
likes me.
 
Or feels threatened by me...
 
Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
 
Or doesn't like haxors and shouldn't be here...
 
Damn kid. All he does is get his face pierced. They're all alike. 
 
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone 
line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, 
a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... I leeched a BTi 0800
number.

"This is it... this is where I belong...alt.ph.uk"
 
I hate everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, 
may never hear from them again... I hate you all...
 
Damn kid. screwing the back off his mobile again. They're all alike... 
 
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been struggling to learn Visual 
Basic at school when we hungered for WinNuke... the lessons that I did turn 
up for were geekish and boring. We've been dominated by school bullies, or 
ignored by the in-crowd. The few that had something to teach found us 
ungrateful and greedy, but those few may as well bang their heads against a
wall.
 
This is our world now... the world of the C12 and the chip, the sex of the 
hex. We make use of the hard work of others without working for what could 
be downloaded from a warez site, and we call ourselves hackers. We steal 
code... and we call ourselves hackers. We leech your knowledge... and we call
ourselves hackers. We exist without morals, without ethics, without 
contributing anything... and we call ourselves hackers. You build networks, 
you give us exploits, you program, fix bugs, and lie to us and try to make us 
believe that we are lame, yet WE are the hackers.
 
Yes, I am a hacker. My hack is that of freeloading. My hack is that of 
judging people by what they can give me, not what they can do. My hack is 
that of having it all given to me, nicely packaged to run on windows 98, and 
that is something that you will never forgive me for.
 
I am a HaXoR, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you 
can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
