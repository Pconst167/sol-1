The top line should be yours and the other 9 should be ones you can 
access through your AT&T/BELL Can that supports you area, find it. 
You don't have to use 9, this is your choice how many to use. Yours
and 3 others works Great! Each jack should have enough wire on it to
be to the AT&T/BELL Can. All wires should have very small insulated 
alligator clips on them. This is very hard to hook up and it is also
very hard to conceal all of the wires and alligator clips, but it can
be done, still,  be very careful. This is highly illegal. All wires
(Red, Green, Yellow, and Black) can be used, too! Black and Yellow 
are for special features.
