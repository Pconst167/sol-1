  Introduction
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 DOS - old, primitive, basically forgotten. People are using powerful
 multitasking operating systems like WindBlows (yeah, right) and Linux,
 some younger computer fans don't even know what DOS is. But that doesn't
 mean a thing, at least until there still exist some REAL DOS USERS.
