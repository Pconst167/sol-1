X. Introduction
                                                                  
This TXT explains how to 'Cover your tracks' on your system.

For all you people that are saying, "Who doesn't know how to click 'Cleal History' on IE",
well some people don't, and they requested that this TXT be writen. So here it is!
                     -TdK-     (TdK@SOLDIERX.com)
**********************************************************

 1. Windows 95 / 98
    a.  In windows 9x when you open any document or file (excluding executable files)
         a shortcut is added to the 'Documents' bin. [ Start > Documents ] Their are two ways
         to clear the documents folder. One way is by going to the taskbar properties 
         [ Start > Settings > Taskbar & Start Menu... ] selecting the Start Menu Programs tab 
         and clicking Clear in the 'Documents Menu' section.  The other is with Tweak UI
         (explained in 1b).

    b.  Tweak UI is a program designed by Microsoft to make Windows 95 or 98 more customizable.
         If you have Tweak UI Installed, goto the Control Pannel [ Start > Settings > Control
         Pannel ]and double click the Tweak UI icon. Their are many good options in Tweak UI,
         but I am only goning to talk about the Paranoia option. To get their click the
         Paranoia tab in Tweak UI. In this section you can have the system clear alot
         of different things, or even clear them on system start-up.


***************************
 2. Internet Explorer 5.x
    a. Temporary Internet Files are the files that you download while surfing the internet.
        Such as .gif .jpg .html, Ect. To clear these files open Internet Explorer, select
        Tools from the menu, and click Internet Options. [ Tools > Internet Options ] In 
        the General tab and goto Temporary Internet Files. Click the Delete Files button
        to clear your Temporary Internet Files. Or click the Settings button to change
        your T. I. F. Settings.

    b. The History in Internet Explorer saves all the pages addresses that you visit so you
        can find them at a later date. To clear the history open Internet Explorer, select
        tools from the menu, and click Internet Options. [ Tools > Internet Options ] Select
        the General tab and goto History. From here you can tell I.E. how long to keep the
        history before clearing it (I would set it to 1 Day, so you never have to clear 
        history again), or from History you can have I. E. Clear the history, to do so 
        click the Clear History button.

    c. Cookies are basically small .TXT files that web pages save on your computer so they
        know who you are and save misc. setings. To clear your Cookies goto your WINDOWS 
        directory ( usually C:\Windows\) and double click the Cookies folder.  From here 
        you can view or delete the cookies on your computer.


*****************************
 3. Netscape 6.0
    a. Just like Internet Explorer, Temporary Internet Files are the files that you download
        while surfing the internet. Such as .gif .jpg .html, Ect. To clear these files open
        Netscape, select Edit from the menu and click Preferences... [ Edit > Preferences ]
        Select the Advanced option and click Cache. To clear the Cache click the 
        Clear Disk Cache button.

    b. Just like Internet Explorer, the history saves all the pages addresses that you visit
        so you can find them at a later date. To clear the history open Netscape, select 
        Tasks from the menu, then select Tools, then click History. [ Tasks > Tools > History ]
        From here you can visit, edit, and delete any of the enterys.
             Note: When this document was writen the current release of netscape 6 was beta 1,
                   and the delete function In the history manager did not function, I am 
                   positive they will fix this bug before the final release, thats why I 
                   included this in the TXT.)

    c. Just like Internet Explorer Cookies are basically small .TXT files that web pages save
        on your computer so they know who you are, and save misc. settings. To clear your 
        Cookies open Netscape, select Edit from the menu, click preferences... 
        [ Edit > Preferences ] Select the Advanced option, and click Cookies, then click the
        View Stored Cookies button. From here you can view, edit, or delete any cookies.

 4. America Online 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0
    a. To clear the Temporary Internet Files, see Section 2a
        Note: AOL uses Internet Explorer as its browser, theirfore it shares Cache.

    b. Their are two things you have to clear Internet Explorer History (section 2b), then
        you have to clear AOL history. To do this open AOL click My AOL, and select 
        preferences, then click the toolbar button, and goto the History Trail.
        From here you can have AOL automatically clear its history, or click the Clear 
        History button.

    c. To clear AOL's cookies, see Section 2c
        Note: AOL uses Internet Explorer as its browser, theirfore it shares Cookies.

    d. Its a little known fact but, without a password or signing on AOL you can read 
        anyone's mail on your entire account (if they have alread read it) To protect 
        yourself from this open AOL, click My AOL, select preferences, and click the 
        Passwords button. A box will come up, type in a password and check the PFC box.
