Big chain computer stores (like CompUSA, for example) will take returns on computers
that have been opened and used.  (The customer's changed their minds or whatnot.)
So legally, the store can't sell it as new.  What they do is put the open box
computers out on a sort of clearence table and mark down the price, selling them
'as is.'  (These are desktops, mind you.)  Little do most people know, they still
carry the manufacturer's one-year warranty.

Anyhow, if someone's creative enough and there aren't a whole lot of people around,
someone can grab a computer from the clearence table, walk up to the technicians'
area and say something like this:

	"I think there's a problem with my computer booting up.  Can
	you check it out really quick just to see if it boots?"

Once the tech goes to check it and it boots up ok, he'll hand it back to you saying
that it's working fine.  You can then walk out with a free computer.  If someone
asks you about it, just say "Yeah, I was having a few problems with it, but the tech
just checked it out for me.  It's working fine now."  And carry about your business.
