	Ok I was in N Arizona (shit hole don't go there and don't ask why I was there) any way well I had a friend that showed something rely cool ok what you do is dial 591 you don't halft to put in money unless the pad is locked!(I think it was 591 it might have been 519 or 529 or 592 but defiantly there was a 5 and a 9 and started with 5 dont do drugs you will end up like me!) well any way he dialed 591-and the last 4 digits of a pay phone then you wate for a click or something kind of hard to explain but it should be within 5 sec of dialing then hit the pound (the hanger upper thinly) really quick and then hage up the phone about 5 sec. later the phone will ring and will ring for about 5 min. (I never timed it)  people will pick it up it is quite funny in like a mall or somthing anny way if you do you will just here a high pitch squeal like a fax machine that is waiting for a handshake but a little quieter.  I tired it is Tucson (S Arizona) and well Hmm how do I explain it I KILLED THE PHONE! there was no ring so I picked up the phone to do it again but here was no dial tone there was nothing it stayed like its for a couple of days until a phone crew came out and fixed it!---gemldanmail me if you find any thing about this subject!gemldan@yahoo.comand if you want to mal bomb me admin@yahoo.com
