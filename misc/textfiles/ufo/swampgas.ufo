                      Lab Results Of 1966 `Swampgas Case'.

==============================================================================

This  information was  obtained by  Mr.Dale  Goudie, director  of Puget  Sound
Aerial Phenomena  Research and  Information director  for the  UFO Information
Service in Seattle, Washington.

The broad  details of this  case have long  been known.   This is the  case in
which Dr.  J.  Allen  Hynek, at the time a consultant to  the U.S.  Air Force,
issued his  quickly-condemned opinion  that the  lights seen  could have  been
swamp gas.

New additional  information about the  famed 1966  Swamp Gas case  in Michigan
surfaced in 1984 shedding new light on this incident my Dale Goudie.

Goudie States: The material  consists of a news release issued  at the time by
William  E.   Van Horn,  the  Civil  Defense  Director for  Hillsdale  County,
Michigan.   It contains  a  hitherto unknown  loboratory  report covering  the
scientific analysis of soil, water and animal life in the area of the reported
landing.   for  those unfamiliar  with  the  case,  here  are excepts  from  a
statement made at the time by Van Horn:

On the evening  of March 21,1966 at 10:32  P.M.  a call was  received from the
New  Woman's   Dormitory  at  Hillsdale  College   by  the  Office   Of  Civil
Defense.....from a  student reporting  that some type  of craft  had descended
from the Northeast,  flashed by their dormitory and disappeared  to the South.
At this time the girl described as well  as later, the observing of red, green
and white pulsating lights.   There were 17 of the college  students that made
this ovservation

At approximately  11 PM,  a second  call was  made by  the girl  to the  Civil
Defense Office informing  them that the object had reappeared  and had settled
close to the ground approximately one half  mile from the dormitory.  Van Horn
at once called for help from the Police Department and three cars plus himself
were sent in a two mile area from the dormitory to the East.  Van Horn checked
the area at  the half mile point and  after he was unable  to locate anything.
he at once returned to the dormitory.

Upon arriving at the  dormitory he was escorted to the  second floor and taken
to a room facing  the East, from where he made  the following observation.  He
observed that there was  an object which was an approximate  distance of 1,500
to 1,700 feet away from them...settled into a hollow and was apparently either
near or on the ground.  The two lights upon his first observation were what he
would describe  as a dim orange  on the right and  a dirty white on  the left.
After observing this for a period of about 10 minutes the lights began to grow
in brilliance,  the dim  orange became  red and  true in  color and  the white
became a  true white.   As the  lights became  more brilliant,  the object  or
vehice began to rise.

It would rise to  a height of approximately 100 to  150 feet, stop momentarily
and  began  to descend.   This  occurred  several  times.   At one  time  upon
descending a glow from  the side opposite them came from  somewhere and he was
able to see a convexed surface.

The vehicle was also observed to move right to left and left to right, and did
so in a very smooth manner.  The acsent  and descent were at an estimated rate
of 25 to 30 feet per minute.  (This was estimated from Van Horns experience as
a commercial pilot.) At  no time were any of the witnesses  able to detect any
type of sound or noise.

At approximately 4:30  AM, those still observing the scene  noticed the lights
disappear and this was the last that was seen of it.

The area that this was observed in was by  no means a swamp but rather an area
which is cultivated by Hillsdale College as a park.

Goudie, also  states that there will  be additional information up  coming and
will be released  in a short time  by the ufo information  service in Seattle.
This new information will even bring us closer to the reality of this case and
keep this in mind that this case was investigated very carefully.
