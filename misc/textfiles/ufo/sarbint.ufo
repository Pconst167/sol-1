======================================================================
   S:   Hello.

   F:   Dr. Sarbacher.

   S:   Yes sir.

   F:   Hi; Stan Friedman up in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada

   S:   Oh for heavens sake.

   F:   Fact I (?) (cut off by s:)

   S:   How's it doing?

   F:   I'm doing fine keeping busy I, as a matter of fact I, I,m
        just going through my files there. I tried to get you when
        I was just down in Florida on the 21st of September but you
        weren't there.

   S:   No let's see, I was in the Washington state.

   F:   Oh, that's pretty far from Florida.

   S:   That's as far as you can get and still stay in the United States.

   F:   Did you stop and see your old buddy in Texas I found for you?

   S:   You know, I wanted so much to xxxxxxx xxxxx I was so pleased

   F:   Ya

   S:   when you located him. He's really. Did you see him personally?

   F:   No. Only on the phone.

   S:   He is the nicest guy.

   F:   He sounded it. He was cordial.

   S:   I really like Fred, but I haven't, I didn't get to see him in
        Dallas. I didn't get to Dallas.

   F:   Ah.

   S:   I skipped Dallas, I went from here to Atlanta and Atlanta to
        Portland.

   F:   Aha.

   S:   Usually they stop in Dallas.

   F:   Ya.

   S:   But the plane didn't, so I didn't see Fred, and I, He's a very
        good friend of mine we were classmates.

   F:  Ya, ya that's what you has told me and that was my clue and that's
       how I found him

   S:  But did you get some good information from him.

   F:  Well, no, I .. he was most cordial but ah , it was so well covered
       up ess (????) he didn't know what was going on... I guess you knew

   S:  Oh probably (???) enough... the only thing I .. was talking to
       one of the fellows.. in your business that work on UFO's,
       gee (???) I get lots of letters on it you know.

   F:  I'll bet mine was the first.

   S:  It might have been. I think it was, and the only thing I remember
       see I was what they call a dollar a year guy then.

   F:  Ya. I remember.

   S:  I had to run my own business, my laboratory and I couldn't go to
       all the meetings. Now they did have, at least I was told, that's
       when Karl Compton was down there.

   F:  Ya.

   S:  I was told that they had recovered a UFO with some people in it.

   F:  Bodies, whatever.

   S:  I don't know, that's what I think was told.

   F:  Did he tell you where?

   S:  Well we were having a meeting at Wright Field and I couldn't
       go.

   F:  Oooohh

   S:  But later on one of the fellows said to me that those guys, if
       they were people, were made like insects. They didn't have any
       skin on their bodies.

   F:  Hmmm.

   S:  So they were saying that's how they were able to accelerate and
       decelerate without being torn apart. You see if we were going
       a thousand miles a second and stopped in a minute well we would be
       squished.

   F:  Ummmm, not quite but

   S:  Well it's pretty bad

   F:  Well you can, you can receive a hell of a jolt if the force is in
       the right direction and if the duration is sufficiently short.

   S:  Yes

   F:  Ah but that's with the Research and Development board or did it
       precede that when you found this out?

   S:  I cant xxxxxx (?) remember and I'm not sure that they were right
       whether they were just guessing or something.

   F:  No okay, uh ... well but it is the Research and Development
       board meeting that your talking about.

   S:  Ya Ya

   F:  Okay . well... who...did ya get any clue as to where the crash
       had occurred.

   S:  Well it was somewhere out West.

   F:  Okay, and do think that this ... any idea what year this was?

   S:  Well ya, let's see if Freddy was there in Washington it was in
       the early 50's.

   F:  Okay did they imply the crash had just happened or that this had
       happened sometime before

   S:  Well ya, the conversation was that it had been recovered

   F:  Ummm.

   S:  It crashed, that's what they were talking about, we were going
       to have a meeting going out to discuss it xxxxx overload xxxx
       xxxxxx xxxxx (cant make out both speaking at once)

   F:  Let's see early fifties now the notes that I sent you from
       Wilbert Smith, do you remember, you do remember talking to him.

   S:  Ya vaguely

   F:  The Canadian.

   S:  Ya vaguely

   F:  Okay, that, his notes were, ah 1950 and let me see exact date
       September 15th where his notes 1950. He asked you a question that
       you didn't answer at that time which was rather fascinating (??)
       maybe you've just given me the answer in a sense, ah he quotes
       you as saying " Yes it is classified two points higher even than
       the H Bomb. In fact the most highly classified subject in the US
       government at the present time." and

   S:  I don't have the slightest idea why.

   F:  Well

   S:  It seems silly to me.

   F:  Well, his next comment, that was supposedly what you said and
       then his next comment was ah "May I ask the reason for the
       classification" and you said " You may ask but I can't tell you."
       Well think that (cut off)

   S:  Well probably cause I didn't know.

   F:  Oh, okay not because of this crash, you see there is no mention
       of a crash persay in this note. Do you think it could have happened
       after this?

   S:  I don't know there may have been several of them. Ah there was some
       talk that there were.

   F:  Ah!

   S:  The things, the things were the crople (???) around that time
       they are the (??) things

   F:  Hmmm ya

   S:  Eisenhower came in as President as I recall

   F:  Ya

   S:  And whenever the Republicans come in they usually stop the research

   F:  Yep

   S:  For some reason or other

   F:  You remember Charlie Wilson (??) " Research is when you don't
       know what your doing" or something like that

   S:  Well its rare(???) here I am with strong(???) Republican

   F:  (loud laugh)

   S:  xxxxxxxxxxxx can get in want to put me out of business

   F:  Well you know I was reading, one of the reasons, one of the things
       that prompted the call is I had run across my colleague out in
       California Bill Moore and run across the ah Saturday Evening Post
       article about the boy genius that you were

   S:  Oh yes, yes

   F:  Which was a fascinating article and that that was 1950 also, ah
       do you know any clue as to what people were involved beside
       Van Bush which clearly

   S:  Vannevar (??) (cough) excuse me just a minute (10 second pause)
       I caught myself a lulu of a cold

   F:  In Florida??

   S:  Well you know how it is air-conditioning, you walk into some of
       these stores and they keep em at about 30 degrees and the temperature
       outside is 90

   F:  (laugh) or 95

   S:  (laugh) lets say that once more

   F:  Ah, who else was involved besides Vannevar Bush

   S:  Well, xxx after Bush left somebody else came in now who was it

   F:  Karl Compton or ah you(???)

   S:  No no no no .. no wait a sec .. no Bush, Bush was the head of the
       ah the se(??) Scientific Advisory to the President.

   F:  Ya

   S:  His official job, he was also Director of the Carnegie Foundation

   F:  Ya

   S:  And in addition he headed up something else

   F:  The JRDB at one point

   S:  Ya JRDB

   F:  And then they set up the Research and Development Board but then
       I guess Compton took over.

   S:  Ya then Compton came down and from MIT

   F:  Ya

   S:  Compton left and then the other guy who was it , wasn't
       Killingham (????)  there was a guy named Killingham

   F:  Ya James Killingham

   S:  He might have but I think it was someone else

   F:  Not Kitjikowski (????)

   S:  No

   F:  Wasn't Doolittle involved in any

   S:  No absolutely, that Fred would know, Fred would know who took
       over after uh ... after Compton

   F:  Okay, Ah do you know if ah, when I,  I'm very interested in the
       crash that happened in 47

   S:  Aha

   F:  Out in New Mexico ah and being New Mexico in 1947 one has to presume
       that probably Oppenheimer and Groves and those guys were involved

   S:  Very likely.

   F:  And maybe ah, the guy who headed Los Alamos, Hillbary, Norman
       huh, I think it was Hillbary(??sp) who was head at Los Alamos wasn't
       it

   S:  I don't remember.

   F:  Ah, but anyway ah ... the meeting let's go back to Wright Field
       for a minute ah that was the meeting you didn't go to

   S:  That's right

   F:  Okay you would have had a Top Secret clearance and it would have
       been required for that meeting, is that

   S:  I suppose, whatever they gave us, I don't know who was doing
       the clearancing thing

   F:  Do you know who else would have been at the meeting?

   S:  No, I remember there was one guy, frankly I didn't like him very
       much he ah he had some company as I had. Seemed to me he was
       from Philadelphia and he was going to all the meetings. And acting
       very smug about it.

   F:  Hmmm

   S:  Ah, what the heck(??) his name was, I know he was .... shortly
       after that we were held(???) at site(???) I did go to the one
       meeting out at Hughs Aircraft

   F:  Hmm

   S:  In California, I went out to that meeting

   F:  You know if Flying Disks were discussed there?

   S:  No, that had more to do with the... that's when Raybull Wildridge
       (???????) was out there

   F:  Oh ya

   S:  At the time he'd come out I think from NRL working on diodes
       then they would then, they'd set up a production line at Hughs
       where the girls used microscopes. That was the first of the
       microscope lines as I recall.

   F:  Oh

   S:  And I think the object of going out there was to observe it.
       I forget I know they were having a, that the, that the Raimo (??)
       and Woodridge (???) where having some kind of fight with Hughs
       because there were a couple of important Generals out there from
       Wright Field and eh they eh eh eh anyway the boys wanted to keep
       the eh the eh cafeteria open for the General in case he wanted
       some coffee or pie or something and Hughs came in and he found it open
       and nobody in the plant and so he closed it.

   F:  (laugh)

   S:  And I heard that they were mad as the Devil, as a matter of fact
       that is what started the fight that led to the formation of Raimo(??)
       Wildridge backing from, from some product.

   F:  Yes.

   S:  That's what started it, (laughing) Yep I know the judge(???)
       because one of Hugh's men came to me, see I had a , in those
       days I had a much higher rating than Raimo, about the only
       thing we know about Raimo was that he had written some elementary
       book on radio. See whereas I had written the the bible  on Radars

   F:  Yes

   S:  My rating was much higher than either of those guys and in those
       days the people that write the oven(???) and in the military
       gave contracts on the basis of the training of the people in these
       companies.
e
   F:  Ya

   S : But since I was better rated than Raimo or Wildridge at that time
       although they were both older than I ah I had been, had a higher
       rating and ah, ah, Hughs tried to hire me because then they
       couldn't take the contract away from him.

   F:  Ya

   S:  See when they left they took the contract with them. Hughs tried
       to talk me into taking the job, well I had a very good laboratory
       at the time.

   F:  In Washington?

   S:  Ya, I was really rolling along and that laboratory was really
       operating. We were building, General Electric got involved in that
       Arctic Radar System. See at that time everybody was afraid Russia
       was going to send planes over the Arctic

   F:  Ya, the DEW Line I suppose

   S:  So General Electric had been given a big contract to eh put in the
       Radar detecting

   F:  Ya

   S:  And eh, and Radar stations and nobody had done more xxxxxxxx how
       radar worked. So General Electric hired me and I sent some of my
       boys, I must of had 200 men up there. What I did (laugh) I hired
       telephone(????) retired men and gave them a course in eh high
       frequencies (laugh) you know, and then we, we, I gave them
       transmitters to take with them so that when they got a problem
       they didn't know, they could call me (laughing). We could work it
       out down in the lab see.

   F:  You didn't have to get cold.

   S:  No. So we did the job for General Electric xxxxx xxxxx got the
       contract but we were his sub contractor

   F:  Well that's a...

   S:  So we had a big thing going

   F:  So who needed Hughs eh

   S:  Ya I didn't need Hughs, no

   F:  And his trouble

   S:  That's right. Although I was a great admirer of Hughs

   F:  He was a rugged individual

   S:  Oh xxxx xxxxx that guy was smart

   F:  Ya he was.

   S:  He was a lot smarter than people give him credit for

   F:  Well didn't he have a toolbit ... patents and stuff

   S:  Ya he did. Not only that I'll tell ya the laboratories that
       he set up he hired very good men. I ah, well after all now
       Wildridge was the, was the top diodes, diodes in those days.
       That was before transistors.

   F:  Ya, oh ya

   S:  And eh, eh he was down at NRL the guy ah xxxxx xxxxx now Raimo
       was a lower group, although if you know Raimo personally, I don't
       know if he's still alive.

   F:  Ya he is. He's written a book in the last couple years

   S:  I'll tell you he's a very clever guy. Clever conversationalist

   F:  Well I worked for TRW, for briefly way back 13 years ago

   S:  Oh did you

   F:  xxxxxxly TRW was booming at that time and is now.

   S:  Well I could have had that

   F:  I'll be darned

   S:  Coulda had it. I could have still taken it if I wanted it. I
       didn't want it you see because Hughs ended up really. Hughs had
       one of his boys on the Thompson(??) Products board. But I found
       out about it

   F:  I see

   S:  See and when it came up, you know, that these guys could leave
       Hughs and swing a big contract with him if Thompson products was
       financing. And so he knew about it ahead of time.

   F:  I'll be darned

   S:  And he said well I'll tell ya I'll, I'll put you in and we'll
       just short circuit them. They'll be out of a job. You take it.

   F:  Well I'll be damned.

   S:  Ya, and I had no idea, well I don't know that I would want to
       get involved in that big business anyway ah it is really not a
       not a happy atmosphere to live in.

   F:  All management and no excitement

   S:  What?

   F:  All management and no excitement

   S:  Ya, ya, ya and I'm a laboratory man. I like the lab.

   F:  Well let me go back a bit now ah when you say that eh you didn't
       go to the meeting at Wright Field but somebody there told you
       about it.

   S:  No, some of the men back at the office, in the Pentagon

   F:  Ah

   S:  We had an office in the Pentagon

   F:  Your office or..

   S:  No, actually I think its ..

   F:  You mean the Research and Development Board (cut off)

   S:  Fred Wilxxxx, he was with the Pentagon at that time
       and he had gotten involved in it. See we were classmates
       Fred and I

   F:  Ya

   S:  And ah, Fred came to me and asked me if I would help him on the
       guidance and control

   F:  I see

   S:  For the missiles

   F:  Ya he was the chairman for that subcommittee

   S:  Ya that's right

   F:  Or went on to be anyway

   S:  That's right and I came down and I was in that, and worked on it,
       for a long time and I guess it was over a year, maybe a couple of
       years, I don't know, I don't remember. But I know it was during
       that time we had an office there that we all went to. You know.

   F:  The Research and Development Board

   S:  Ya the Research & Development Board. It was sorta like a little
       cabinet post.

   F:  Ok so the guys there told you about the UFO's

   S:  Ya it was among those fellows in conversation.

   F:  Remember any of those guys?

   S:  Not a one. Not a one. Fred would know them all. I should think
       that somewhere among his files he would have a list of all the
       men that worked there

   F:  Oh ya. He did. as a matter of fact he had names at his fingertips
       so to speak

   S:  Ya I know, Fred was right in the middle of it

   F:  Ok so you think it was one of those guys that....

   S:  It was somebody in that group, ya they were just yakking aloud
       around a water bottle or something

   F:  Ya

   S:  Whether they were talking facts or just, just be guessing
       because one of the big questions was if these damn things
       were actually not what you might call an optical illusion
       with some kind of light beam creating them. For they were
       accelerating at great speeds and they went in formation. They
       went you know like ducks.

   F:  Ya and the question was how the heck they worked

   S:  Ya how they worked and what are they made of and how can they
       go so fast, and go, speed they can go, well you could see one
       one minute and the next minute it was gone. I mean it was you
       could see it go.

   F:  Were you guys talking about nuclear powered flight at that time?

   S:  Oh, we were possibly, yes, but I held, had certain ideas see,
       one of the problems today we really don't know what gravity is
       we don't know and I had an idea, I'm willing to work on it in one of
       my theses but then my professor didn't believe me, but I had
       determined that bismuth(?????) did not obey the laws of gravity.
       So I thought that gee theres a leak I might be able to get
       nature to tell me something

    F: Hmmm

    S: But they wouldn't let me, they didn't believe me, well they
       believed me but he said hell that's a second order effect

    F: (laugh)

    S: Which is implying it was in the, in the area of, of the accuracy
       of the instrument.

    F: Ya

    S: Well it was, it was and it was clearly, god somebodies going to
       do something about it one day, as a matter of fact I was talking
       to someone not too long ago and right now I'm putting a public
       company together, on some batteries I just finished developing
       and they are unusually powerful batteries. And you'll be reading
       about it probably in the papers, at least you'll read about it if
       comes through. I was talking to the head of the Securities Exchange
       Commission on it in Washington a couple of weeks ago and he said
       that if I got the   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx within the month of November
       that he'd have it out before Christmas.

    F: Well I'll be darned, What kind of, should I ask what kind of
       batteries

    S: Ya, well sure primary and secondary

    F: A lot more WATT hours per pound?

    S: More Watt hours per pound ya

    F: Hmmm, electric cars here we come

    S: Well it'll be a little while for that but certainly we can make
       a lot of electric generators for third world people.

    F: Ah

    S: And they of course would be financed by the international banks
       so it'll be a lucrative thing and the company will be able to make
       some money

    F: Sounds like a good idea, maybe I should buy some stock

    S: Well keep an eye out you'll see it

    F: What's the name of the company

    S: Well I was going to do it  xxxxxxxx You know I developed, what
       is called used today the IOS System for aircraft

    F: Ya

    S: I did that when I was in school and I later sold it to IT & T
       they're building it now and you may know it's used all over
       the world

    F: Ya

    S: As a matter of fact they've mastered (?) it now so that it will
       land the airplane as well as ... you know without the pilot
       having to do anything .. and that's why were having such nice
       landings. But anyway, ah

    F: Let me ask you...

    S: I had set up a school to train pilots to use the IOS System
       and it was in Washington, I called it The Washington Institute of
       Technology.

     F: Ya

     S: So I still use that name

     F: Oh

     S: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Washington Institute of Technology

     F: A very witty kind of  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

     S: Well I tell you there is an advantage to having a name like that
        When you do project work for corporations and you have a name
        like that the IRS people in looking over the books think it's
        an educational institution so they don't bother checking it.

     F: That sounds reasonable

     S:  You know less than they would if it were Joe Smith Company

     F:  Let me get back to Wilbert Smith. How did he happen to wind
         up with you as opposed to anybody else on the committee. Do you
         know who referred him to you or...

      S: No.

      F: Or were there any other Canadians that you can think of that you
         had any dealings with.

      S: I don't remember.

      F: Like the military liaison man at the Canadian embassy was a guy
         named Arnold Wright(?) at that time I ... and I don't know if
         he was doing ... well there was a famous Canadian Omans Salant
         (????) who was sort of the Vannevar Bush of Canada if you will
         at that time.

      S: Uh hu

      F: Would would there have been liaisons between your committee and the
         Canadian ah Defence Research Board.

      S: I wouldn't be surprised again that would be in Frank's ??
         he'd know that for sure

      F: Ya

      S: I should think he would know

      F: Ok let me ask you a different sort of question ah since my
         initial contact with you have any government people bothered you
         about this

      S: I haven't, no there's somebody in California, Steinman

      F: Steinman, Ya

      S: Ah who has written a number of letters and I answered one just
         recently

      F: Oh,

      S: I think

      F: He's a strange man but ah judging by his letters to me (laughter)

      S: I know he generally has a letter in here every 15 minutes
         I look bad because I'm not here you know. I come back and there
         are two or three letters, some of them typed some of them long
         hand. I think god he's really xxxxxxxx???

      F: Well he's sort of a peculiar guy but...You would probably
         there was a guy well maybe he was doing it for a guy named Todd
         Zeckles(???) somebody in my travels mentioned of him. Todds a
         really a not to be dealt with.

      S: Where in the world did you ever find Fred Garland

      F: Well I contacted the Harvard University Alumni Association

      S: Well I tried a dozen times , they never had anything for me

      F: Well I pushed them a little and I didn't know his class of course
         but..

      S: I could have given you that

      F: I know... anyway it wasn't that much trouble. I sent them a
         letter and then I called them because I was out of town
         and they said they were sending me a reply and O said well could
         you give it to me over the phone since I wont be home for two weeks
         and they gave me an address and I called information and there he
         was in Dallas

      S: What a nice guy

      F: He sounded .. he sent me a copy of one of the letters at least
         that he sent you and you know .. what's the word I want..
         I can .. I can associate with him because I worked in industry
         big companies and all that kind of stuff, saw some of the same
         things that he had seen and uh, it's a crazy world out there
         Well ok, you know I would gather you don't have any records or
         notebooks from this period of time

      S: Unfortunately I don't.. I might of had some but I'll tell ya I have
         I've been looking xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx looking for certain types
         of enzymes that I have been using in some of the energy converters
         and ah ah when I pulled in here ah I had a yacht about 90 foot
         xxxxxxxxxxx and eh we took the xxxxxxxx I was trying to get xxxxxxx
         to get my microbes. You see a microbe is basically a bundle of
         enzymes.

      F: Ya

      S: And ah.. I was after the microbe... I was trying to extract from
         the microbes the enzymes I wanted Now when I came in here I
         ah .... sail boats have an awful lot of sails for different
         kinds of weather and I wanted to clean out my sail lockers which
         was loaded with things and I bought a house with a basement
         which is an unusual thing in Florida that we have basements
         because the closest I could get to store my sails was about ten
         miles away but my house with a basement .. could put the sails in
         in the basement. Well I ended up putting a lot of my records down
         in that basement about two years ago, about two years ago we had
         about eleven inches of rain in two hours. The basement was full
         of water. I got the water out as fast I could but boy I lost
         cabinets full of records that was a real sorry thing I lost a lot
         of instruments too. A lot of equipment.

      F: Ah.. Oh dear there goes the records down the drain, but anyway

      S: I tell you it was mess but the worst part were the books
         especially one of the things that I needed and I need it now
         I had one of the unabridged dictionaries you know of that onion
         skin paper so they weren't so thick xxxxxxxxxxxxx boy I lost that
         now that hurt me more than some of my notes

      F: Well thinking back to this same period of time , early fifties
         Was there anybody, you know a secretary at your company or
         anybody you worked real close with that's still around, that you
         might have talked to about this to

      S: I tried xxxxxxx  xxxxx  he died Let me see. I don't know where
         to reach xxxxx xxxxx but he was working in a different area
         and at that time I didn't work with him......My secretary is
         still around

      F: Hmmm.

      S: But I don't think that she would remember


      F: What's her name

      S: What's here name I have such a short memory it seems like
         I don't know I tried to get to see her when I was in Washington
         ...... (long pause) I have a lawyer I've become involved in
         a court appeal sometimes you can't remember for sure and it
         can mean a lot of money to me (pause)

 Freidman then comes on to say that is the end of the tape and he
 did get the name of the secretary. He called her and she said that she did
 not work for him in 1950 and didn't remember anything associated unfortunately.
