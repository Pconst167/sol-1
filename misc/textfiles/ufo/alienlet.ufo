Dear Mr. ______________


     Some things you have right, and some things you have
wrong.  The machine itself was obviously a landing vehicle
only, and it had no unusual features and no power plants
with which we were not quite familiar.  I believe it still
exists and is kept someplace near Wright Field.


     Your greatest error, of course, comes in the finding of
the bodies-- there were no bodies; there were four very 
normal individuals, all male.  Unfortunately, they had no
memory of anything in the past (probably by design), but
they were highly intelligent.  They learned the English
language within a few hours and it was our decision not to
make public spectacles of them, but allow them to be
absorbed into American culture as soon as we were sure that
they did not bring any contamination with them.  I believe
all four have done this very successfully.  One assumed a 
simple name and proved himself to be an expert on computers,
although he had not memory of such devices.  He became the
president and innovator for one of the largest and most
successful computer organizations.

     
     A second one became a world famous athlete, and because
of his quick reaction time, exceeded any normal person in 
his performances.  He is still a noted professional athlete.

     
     The third became enamored with finance at our
capitalistic system.  He has made himself famous as a Wall
Street raider, and is very rich.


     The fourth, I have lost track of and have no clues as
to where he might be.  However, I consider the decision to
let these people meld into American life, completely
justified, and I can see no point in trying to reverse that
decision.  I hope that you will let matters lie as they are.
The results are completely satisfactory, and nothing is to
be gained by further publicity.


                              Very truly yours,

                             (signed)  E A W
