                    FLYING SAUCERS: THE BIBLE CONNECTION

   Bible scholar, Barry Downing, firmly believes that biblical teachings were
inspired by extraterrestial beings who camw to earth in flying sausers. Downing
was so convinced, he wrote a book about his theory called THE BIBLE AND FLYING
SAUCERS (Lippincott,New York, 1968).
   In the book, Downing says the bible clearly points out how UFOs played a
strong role in the evolution of the Hebrew-Christian faith. For example,
Downing believes the Scriptures suggest that Jesus' resurrection occured when
he was beamed up from Earth by a flying saucer.
   Downing also believes that the bright cloud that led the people of Israel
through the Red Sea, parting the waters and then engulfing the Egyptions, was a
UFO.
   The Author even claims it was space beings who spoke to Moses from the
middle of a glowing thicket, and later spoke to Elijah outside the cave,forcing
the prophet to sheild his eyes because of the brightness. A UFO took Jesus away
at the Ascension, and hovered over Paul and his followers on the Damascus Road,
Downing contends.
   Further, the author claims the three wise men probably followed a UFO to
Bethlehem, since stars do not move or abruptly stop in the manner the bible
describes.
   Downing claims that evidence proving UFOs could be hazardous to human health
can also be found in the Bible. He points to references to the Egyptians
drowning in the Red Sea, warning Moses not to approach too near the burning
bush, and warnings given his followers not to approach Mount Sinai, as proof.
The author points out other mystifying events in the Bible that he believes can
only be interpreted to mean the participants had contact with UFOs,
   For example, he points out that when Moses decended from Mount Sinai with
two tablets in his hands, Exodus records that the skin of his face shone from
talking with God. And he says the NEW TESTAMENT describes how Jesus began to
glow when in contact with a bright object on a mountain.
   When the Tabernacle was built, Downing cotends the priests serving it were
told by ETs what clothing to wear to protect themselves against radiation,
because the UFO hovered like a cloud over the tent enclosing the Tabernacle.
Downing believes this precaution could have brought about the Jewish custom of
wearing skullcaps into houses of worship. The author even suggest mutations in
the growth of biological life caused by radiation could have resulted in the
plagues described in Exodus.
Downing further theorizes that Einstein's curvature of space theory provides a
clue to the place where heaven is located. The author contends Jesus may have
meant that the kingdom of heaven quite literally rests in the midst of us,
meaning that heaven is on an entirely different plane or wave length, invisible
to us, but existing parallel to our own and connected by bends or warps in the
space-time continuum.
