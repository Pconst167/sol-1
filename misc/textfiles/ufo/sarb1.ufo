               The file was run through the Microsoft Word 5.0 spell
               checker following conversion so most errors in character
               recognition should be ok. Now that I finally have OCR
               software that works there should be lots of files on the
               way so stay tuned.

               Do you have important material that needs to be shared?
               Contact us here at UFONET I and perhaps we can convert
               your document to a text file for you using our OCR
               software and hardware. You can contact either myself
               Harvey Stewart or the Sysop of this board Tom Mickus
               for details.

Letter to the Editor Flying Saucer Review Vol. 31 #5 (July 1976)

Dear Mr. Creighton,

     In a recent issue of Flying Saucer Review (Volume 31, No 1,1985)
  your article entitled "Top U.S. Scientist Admits Crashed UFO'S"
  indicated that it was first to Jerome Clark that Dr. Robert I.
  Sarbacher revealed his knowledge of crashed UFO's. Well, Mr. Clark
  was not the first. Mr. William Steinman in recent months has provided
  me with the following information:

    "I first became aware of Dr. Sarbacher when I read notes of Wilbert
     B. Smith reagarding his interview with him on September 15, 1950.
     I had obtained them from Wilbert Smith's widow, Murl. She obtained
     them out of Wilbert's own research diary, which is in the possession
     of Wilbert's son. Dr. Sarbacher remembered the interview when I
     sent him a copy. The handwritting of the notes matches that exactly
     of other notes in Smith's own longhand."

  A copy of Dr. Sarbacher's letter of November 29, 1983 to Mr. Steinman
  is enclosed for your information. The only copy Mr. Steinman says he
  gave was to U.S. researcher William L. Moore in December, 1983 (in
  fact within one week of receiving it in the mail on December 5,1983).
  You can take it from there how all the others, including myself, in the
  grapevine finally obtained their copy. A more in depth article with Mr.
  Steinman's approval will be published regarding the above affair in my
  UFO publication,"The Sixth Quark Journal" this spring.

      Sincerely,

      Tom Benson
