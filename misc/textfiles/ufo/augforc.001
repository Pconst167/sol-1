                            Amplitude of Force

       The amplitude of vibrations is directly increased or diminished by
    increasing or diminishing the size or number of creative aggregates.

       The human EGO, subject to the forces of love or hate, kindness or
    cruelty, forgiveness or revenge, is according to circumstances ruled or
    dominated by these force in proportion to their intensity.

       The intensity of a force is precisely proportionate to the number of
    units vibrating at  that  particular  pitch.   For  instance,  let fear
    assail one an, and according to its  intensity  will be the effect; but
    let a crowd of en experience fear, see the result in  the  augmentation
    of fear, though its source be relatively insignificant.  A curtain in a
    theatre, for example,  takes  fire;  one  or  two  persons, cowardly at
    heart, become afraid  through  the   dominance  of  the  purely  animal
    instinct of bodily preservation; there is actually no  real danger, but
    these two or  three  persons  are  sufficient to arouse the unreasoning
    dread which lies  latent in every  breast,  with  perhaps  a  very  few
    remarkable exceptions.  The fire burns nobody; but blind fear, which is
    extremely contagious among people mutually sympathetic,  by  reason  of
    the rapidity with which etheric waves transmit all feeling, occasions a
    terrible panic, during  which  many severe accidents and many instances
    of fierce cruelty occur, all because  of  this  sympathetic transfer of
    feeling starting from one or two augmented or intensified fear-centres,
    each person being a centre emanating the feeling of  fear.   Were there
    no counteracting centres   of   influence  in  an  audience,  radiating
    contrary feelings, the result of a  panic  would  be  the  total bodily
    extinction of a very large percentage of the assembled multitude.

       Thus the human race is immersed in forces whose intensity is vast in
    proportion to the number of EGOS adding each its quota to the already
    intense vibration, tending either to love or hate, kindness or cruelty,
    timidity or bravery.  Those who intensify the force of cruelty in the
    place where they  reside,  may  be strengthening a murderer's  hand  to
    strike the deadly blow in a distant land.  This result is brought about
    through the agency   of  etheric  waves,  which  transmit  forces  with
    undiminished intensity even to uncalculated distances.  This phenomenon
    may be termed transympathetic.

       They who feel that force called  love,  which  on  higher  planes is
    known as sympathy, thrill with waves of force which are already strong,
    augmenting them or increasing their intensity.  They who indulge such
    sentiments and encourage such forces may stop the falling hand on evil
    sped.

       In order to protect ourselves effectually from becoming the
    dispensers or propagators of deadly force, we must consciously and
    deliberately relate ourselves by resolute determination, to awaken
    within us such centres only as are concordantly sympathetic with all
    force radiating in the interest of universal goodwill, thereby aiding
    the establishment of universal brotherhood.

       All ye who feel a longing for a better life or nobler existence draw
    to yourselves streams of force which they alone feel who have attuned
    their bodies to  the  higher  harmonies.  For a moment you feel as they
    who dwell perpetually  in  communion   with  higher  harmonies,  living
    immersed in that higher force; they are the true hierophants,  and you,
    O neophytes, struggling  to attain the goal which they have reached, do
    not despair though at present you find  yourselves  unable  to maintain
    this high altitude for long together.  Though you fall  many  times, be
    not discouraged, for as yet your organisms and all their centres of
    resonation are not yet concordant to the focalized vibrations of the
    higher harmonies; being still related to the mass, you are drawn again
    and again into the whirlpool of the vibrations which affect the mass,
    for these you cannot yet resist.  But know that you can change all this
    rapidly or slowly as your purpose is steadily intense or vacillating.

       With the cessation of your lower desires comes the cessation of the
    action upon you of the lower forces; the resonating centres which
    formerly distributed this  force,  no  longer active, become latent and
    are absorbed back to an embryonic condition.

       Every man contains, developed or embryonic, all conditions of the
    Infinite; therefore no height is too  great to reach.  Impossibility is
    a meaningless word to the an who apprehends the fathomless  contents of
    his own nature.  Thou comest here, O man, with the instrument thou hast
    graduated in thy  many  past existences; how few of thy chord-settings,
    if thou are art numbered with the any, respond to the higher harmonies!
    Universal unity or fraternity has been absorbed to almost embryonic
    conditions by the prevalence of material self-regard.  Charity has been
    rendered almost latent, that beautiful chord-setting found even in the
    lowest forms of creation-LOVE, the dominant chord of the cycles.  Love
    has an amplitude of action in the brute which may well make the selfish
    man ashamed, but until the crust of selfishness is broken through, the
    beauty of love is obscured, and though  it  exists  all  about him, the
    poor blind egotist has no eye to discern it.  The centres of love,
    brotherhood, charity, voice their music loud and clear, yet the masses
    will not listen.  I do not mean the immortal EGO when  I  say  man will
    not listen; I  refer  to  the personality which is the resultant of all
    the ages of action in this, now rapidly closing, cycle.

       You who  exist do-day, to-morrow  would  exist  no  longer  in  your
    present personalities did  you  but  dare  to  yield  to  these  higher
    harmonies.  I say  YIELD  because  it  is  a  yielding process for this
    personality.  In a moment your outer  life  would  end,  and  you,  the
    warrior, would enter peace.

       The immortal EGO is an entity of which man can become throroughly
    conscious while here on earth, but to arrive at this consciousness
    necessitates the entire abandonment of all the petty considerations
    involved in the transient and subordinate EGO, which  is  the only self
    of which the  un-enlightened  man is conscious.  Let him who desires to
    reach this inner consciousness enter his inner sanctuary, wherever that
    sanctuary may be; it matters not whether  it  be  his  own chamber, the
    open field, the mountain top, the seashore, the stately  cathedral,  or
    the humble village   chapel.   Let  him  realize  fully  the  transient
    character of his  own personality  and  contrast  therewith  his  eager
    longing to know   the   immortal.   Let  him  concentrate   his   whole
    consciousness upon his  personality,  fully  arousing  all his personal
    conditions as a distinct
                                     Page 2







    individual; then with all the aspiration of which this personality is
    capable, let him beseech of the immortal EGO-which is eternal and does
    not incarnate, but overshadows all incarnations, waiting until one is
    formed capable of   illumination,  to  whom  it  may  reveal  itself-to
    consider him worthy of illumination,  and according to his preparedness
    to receive illumination  will it then be granted.  He  who  asks  this,
    knows not what  he  asks; for were the prayer answered, life henceforth
    for such an one would be a weary round,  as Hamlet says: "to-morrow and
    to-morrow and to-morrow  brings  in  this weary round  of  life";  for,
    having seen the  glory of this immortal EGO, all else seems so base, so
    commonplace and mean, so inglorious,  that  oftentimes  the personality
    has utterly collapsed when thrown back from the radiant  vision of this
    glorious immortal entity   possessed  by  all  alike,  though  scarcely
    dreamed of by  any  save  the  very  few  who,  discontented  with  the
    ignorance and emptiness of terrene existence, aspire to  know the great
    reality of the  supernal.  As the incarnations of every entity, passing
    through certain orders of experience through numerous lives, inevitably
    culminate in this  moment  of conscious  realization  of  the  immortal
    entity; the Buddha says: "All shall reach the sunlit snows."

       You who  through  your  daily life move on unthinking,  not  caring,
    inactive, inactive, you shall hear when your supplications reach this
    high entity, "Lo!  thou  didst  not  even  try,  knowing  that even thy
    failures were acceptable to me."
