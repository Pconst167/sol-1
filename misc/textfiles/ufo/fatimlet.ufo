               The file was run through the Microsoft Word 5.0 spell
               checker following conversion so most errors in character
               recognition should be ok. Now that I finally have OCR
               software that works there should be lots of files on the
               way so stay tuned.

            Fatima Thought-forms

    Dear Sir, - I would like to suggest the
    following hypothesis concerning the
    events at Fatima in 1917. My suggestions
    are based upon the many weeks
    of patient study I undertook during
    which time I used the literature at the
    Catholic Central Library, and material
    from abroad. The theories are largely
    those of C.G. Jung, who mentions
    Fatima at least twice to my knowledge.
    In  correspondence with the
    Jung Institute in Zurich I have been
    unable to ascertain whether he mentions
    Fatima in detail in any of his
    writings. They do not know.
       Jung, as you know, developed the
    idea of the Collective Unconscious.
    The personal unconscious was seen as
    a self-regulatory mechanism. Similarly
    the Collective Unconscious was
    thought to possess these characteristics.
    It would appear that whenever
    some massive imbalance occurs in the
    collectivity the regulatory mechanism
    comes into play. I base this hypothesis
    on the study of apparitions
    through the ages. These manifestations
    occur at times of social upheaval.
    Where the human collectivity is leaning
    too much one way, the Collective
    Unconscious will throw up a message
    in terms relevant to the peoples,
    belief and experience.
       Fatima is the most interesting
    example of this phenomenon since
    it was a multiple witness case. It
    occurred, characteristically, when
    the inclination was too much towards
    the left, i.e. shortly before the Russian
    Revolution. Here, clearly, the compensatory
    mechanism came into play.
    Detailed study of the ,lady of light,
    show her to be right-wing authoritarian.

       May I suggest that these entities
    were neither the, soul-forms, of
    historical characters nor beings from
    outer space, but thought-forms from
    the Collective Unconscious manifesting
    themselves in terms we can understand.
