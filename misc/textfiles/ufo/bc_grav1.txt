                         Concentric Universal Gravitation,
                            the Absence of Dark Matter,
                         and the Structure of the Universe

                                 by Brian Crabtree

           Envision two  flat rubber sheets, one on top of the other.  They
       are both in zero gravity.  Now if  we are to lay matter on the upper
       sheet, and put anti-matter under the lower sheet, the  matter  would
       form depressions, or warps, in the sheet, as it was attracted to the
       anti-matter.

           During this, the anti-matter is also forming raised areas in its
       sheet where it  is  being attracted to the matter.  Other masses can
       `roll' into these depressions or,  in  the  case of the anti-matter,
       fall `up' into the raised areas.

           Imagine that the fourth dimension, time, is `up  and  down', and
       the three spatial dimensions are centered in the skin of the sheets.
       This is the source of the phenomenon we know as gravity.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

           Keely stated  that  "Time is Gravity", in his case the reference
           came from  his  discovery of  the  Neutral  Centre  as  detailed
           elsewhere on KeelyNet.

           According to Brian's concept, the three dimensions,  x,  y and z
           or height, width and breadth would manifest in sequential layers
           as time  progressed in its 'up or down' movement between the two
           layers (matter and antimatter).  Time would therefore move in

                                      Page 1




           reverse if  moving  DOWN  from the 'matter' layer or Up from the
           'antimatter' layer.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

           Now curve the anti-matter sheet  into  a  sphere,  and the other
       around it.  You now have 2 concentric universes.  Now the dimensions
       are a bit different.

           Since we are not only bending an object, but space  itself,  the
       fourth dimension (time)  is now in all directions and radiating from
       the center.

           It is possible to have smaller  universes  contained within each
       of these universe-cells,  which  we  will  call  multiverses.   Near
       infinite numbers of   multiverses   are   connected   by  wormholes,
       subatomic tunnels through space and time, throughout the omniverse,
       the field of all space, time, hyperspace, etc.

       Here is an interesting possibility:

             If the outer universe is matter,  the  universe  in  which  we
             exist, then  the  dark  matter  may  be  in  the   anti-matter
             universe!

             The reason  our universe is not expanding as fast as it should
             be is because the attraction  of the anti-matter is holding us
             back.

             Also, these universes must only be spherical  in  fashion, not
             shape.  This allows for warps, wormholes, bridges, etc.

           In this  way,  time  progresses as the universe oscillates.  The
       cosmic background radiation  is   left-over  light,  etc.  from  the
       multiverse's energy phase.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

           Note the energy shell creation as the matter and antimatter come
           into equilibrium.   This  shell  then expands and  contracts  as
           matter is created and uncreated (antimatter).
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

         When a mass approaches the speed of light, what are the effects?

           1)  Greater mass :  Mass  moves  closer  to the center. (thereby
                               causing an increase in density and a smaller
                               size due to mass compaction)

           2)  Slow time    :  Mass is `lagging  behind'  the  expansion of
                               the rest  of  the  universe.  (since  it  is
                               closer to  the  center  and moving 'up' from
                               the matter  layer  AT  A  SLOWER  SPEED than
                               other mass due to the higher  energy density
                               present when approaching light speed)

           3)  Shrunk space :  Universe   had  less  `surface'   ( due   to
                               compaction ) at  earlier  locations  in  the
                               matter/antimatter cycle.  (the  location  of
                               mass in  the  expansion  cycle  recedes back
                               towards   its   generating   layer   as   it
                               approaches the velocity of  light,  this  is
                               again evidenced by the increased density and
                               slowing down of time)

           This theory accounts for all aspects of relativity, the cosmic
       background radiation, gravity,  and  explains  the  structure of the
       universe.
