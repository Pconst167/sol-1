 YOUR CO-WORKER COULD BE A SPACE ALIEN, SAY EXPERTS ...  here's
 how you can tell (by Michael Cassels of the "National
 Inquirer")

 Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look
 human - but you can spot these visitors by looking for
 certain tip-offs, say experts.

 They listed 10 signs to watch for:

 1.  Odd or mismatched clothes.  "Often space aliens don't
 fully understand the different styles, so they wear
 combinations that are in bad taste, such as checked pants
 with a striped shirt or a tuxedo jacket with blue jeans or
 sneakers," noted Brad Steiger, a renowned UFO investigator
 and author.

 2.  Strange diet or unusual eating habits.  Space aliens
 might eat French fires with a spoon or gobble down large
 amounts of pills, the experts say.

 3.  Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don't
 understand earthly humor may laugh during a serious company
 training film or tell jokes that no one understands, said
 Steiger.

 4.  Takes frequent sick days.  A space alien might need extra
 time off to "rejuvenate its energy," said Dr.  Thomas Easton,
 a theoretical biologist and futurist.

 5.  Keeps a written or tape recorded diary.  "Aliens are
 constantly gathering information."  said Steiger.

 6.  Misuses everyday items.  "A space alien may use
 correction fluid to paint its nails," said Steiger.

 7.  Constant questioning about customs of co-workers.  Space
 aliens who are trying to learn about earth culture might ask
 questions that seem stupid, Easton said.

 "For example, a co-worker may ask why so many Americans
 picnic on the Fourth of July," noted Steiger.

 8.  Secretive about personal life-style and home.  "An alien
 won't discuss domestic details or talk about what it does at
 night or on weekends," said Steiger.

 9.  Frequently talks to himself.  "An alien may not be used
 to speaking as we do, so an alien may practice speaking,"
 Steiger noted.

 10.  Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near
 certain high-tech hardware.  "An alien may experience a mood
 change when a microwave oven is turned on," said Steiger.  The
 experts pointed out that a co-worker would have to display
 most if not all of these traits before you can positively
 identify him as a space alien.
