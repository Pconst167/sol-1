 FROM:      Dr. Willy Smith                          DATE:  Aug. 7, 1989

 TO:        UFO publications, electronic media
            Proponents of Gulf Breeze photographs

 SUBJECT:   Statement of Position


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 In mide-June, 1989, the UNICAT Project submitted several photographs
 for computer enhanced image analysis.  The photos considered fall into
 two categories: i) portrait of a girl with an anomalous image above
 her right shoulder; and ii) photos of an alleged UFO obtained by Mr.
 Walters/Hanson of Gulf Breeze, FL starting in November, 1987.

 The results have been spectacular:  the girl's photos were undoubtedly
 obtained by using double exposure, thus demonstrating the photographers
 familiarity with the technique, while the UFO photos show a well-defined
 supporting structure under the alleged spacecraft.

 The reaction of the interested parties has been swift and predictable.
 Instead of addressing the main issue, i.e., why a real UFO needs to
 be supported, the proponents have flooded the mails with anonymous and
 world-shaking communiques which can be described only as malicious
 gossiping, aimed at cushioning the negative impact of the new
 information revealed by computer analysis.

 The releases follow the time-honoured pattern that what counts in
 politics is not the truth, but what is believed to be the truth.
 In an attempt to provide a semblance of credibility, names and
 circumstances are provided, but no supporting evidence is offered.
 Authorship of the masterpieces of intrigue -- I am told -- have been
 attributed to various sources, some of them luminaries on the UFO
 scene, such as Budd Hopkins and/or his associates, or Dr. Maccabee,
 or secondary characters in the play, as for instance Col. Roberrt
 (sic) Reid or "Ed-of-Gulf-Breeze" himself.  Whatever the case may
 be, until such times a signed copy of the statements reaches me,
 I will not dignify them with a formal response.

 The computer-enhanced material has not been released yet, as some
 questions have been raised by the photographer regarding the
 copyright protection of the photos, an issue that has been
 complicated by the fact that the lawyer that initially contacted
 me has indicated that she does not represent Mr. Walters any
 longer.  In the meantime, information received from the Copyright
 Office in Washington has created some doubts with reference to the
 validity of the copyright for the specific instance, as well as
 disclosing interesting possibilities based on the doctrine of
 "fair use.".
