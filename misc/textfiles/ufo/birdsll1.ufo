I  met  with  the  author of the following document, Jerry Birdsall, at the 
Lincoln  Symposium,  and  found him to be genial and credible. He has asked 
me  to  post this information with the understanding that I not mention the 
name  of  the  individual  or the book referred to. You can correspond with 
Jerry on this system, in private mail to: JERRY BIRDSALL.

   THE GROWING CONCERN REGARDING MISINFORMATION AND UNFOUNDED CONSPIRACY 
                     SPECULATIONS IN THE UFO COMMUNITY


      The  purpose  of  this letter is to warn interested persons that mis-
information  is  occurring in the UFO community and in at least one case is 
being  carelessly propagated. This is based on my own experience due to the 
publishing  of  a  recent  trade  paperback concerning UFO phenomena in the 
greater  New York area. This book specifically contains naive and off-based 
speculations about certain government involvement in this phenomena.

      I  am referred to in this book (under an alias) as a government agent 
who  interfered,  threatened,  and in general loused up research investiga-
tions.  Nearly  all  of  the  recounting concerning me is either out of se-
quence,  out  of  context, misinterpreted, or out-and-out wrong. It is true 
that  I  did  work for the Department of Defense when I first contacted the 
author  in  1984  (I left the government shortly thereafter). I volunteered 
this  information  up front so that this sort of misunderstanding would not 
happen  and  stressed  that  I  was  interested for purely personal reasons 
only.  I  did  not  in  any  manner represent myself as an "agent" from the 
government  as  was  alluded.  The  main  reason  that I wanted to meet the 
author  was  to  try  to  get him funding through the Fund For UFO Research 
(FUFOR)  of  which  I was a member while I lived in the DC area. As a point 
of  fact,  several key members of FUFOR are employed by the government -one 
by the Navy, one a Pentagon lawyer, and one by the CIA.

      I  tried  to  contact  the  author several times by phone between the 
Fall  of  '84  to the present. It was only just recently that I finally got 
through  to  him. He was not interested in hearing me out but chose instead 
to  cling  to  his seemingly paranoid conspiracy beliefs. I think that this 
is  quite  unfortunate  -  that  someone who purports to be an authority on 
UFOs  hasn't  the  interest  or courtesy to listen to someone who he has in 
effect  slandered  in  the  eyes of the UFO community. And what happened to 
scientific  objectivity?  We  should  all  truly examine our definitions of 
what  an authority in this field means. There are those who represent them-
selves  as such who are doing harm, in my opinion, to the future of UFO re-
search.  If the legitimate UFO community as a whole shared information more 
openly  and  networked  more efficiently, consensus approval could be given 
to  those  who  wish  approval from the UFO community as legitimate and re-
sponsible researchers.

      I  contend that there is no room for unfounded, wild speculation in a 
field  such  as  this  where things are bizarre enough on their own without 
the  creation  of  contrived, self indulgent, half-cocked bizarreness. I am 
really  disappointed  in  the  author, and have lost nearly all respect for 
him.  Irresponsible writing of this nature only serves to raise the ambient 
level  of  paranoia,  muddles  future research, and is a true disservice to 
the field in general.
      
      I  first  found  out  about the author from a local newspaper article 
when  I  came  home to Connecticut one weekend. I was living and working in 
Maryland  at the time. This was in the summer of 1984. I called him from my 
home  in  Maryland  (he said I called from my office), we spoke briefly (he 
said  I  quizzed him for an hour), and I didn't mention any details of what 
work  I  did  until  we met at my parent's home weeks later. Furthermore, I 
only  had his home number and could not have called him from work because I 
didn't have his work number. In fact, I didn't even have an office!

      It  would  take  several pages to list all the errors about me in his 
book,  and  that  is  not  the point I wish to make here. If the author was 
half  the  investigator  that he makes himself out to be, you [would] think 
that  he  would have bothered to verify that I indeed was from Connecticut, 
and  not only that, but was raised in the same town he was! He did admit to 
me  that  his editor did change a few things around. I contend that the mo-
tive was to add drama to help sell his book.
      
      It  was  just  recently  when  I had finally spoken to the author and 
heard  his  position  that I felt I owed this to the UFO community at least 
to  set  matters  straight. I am all for the government coming clean on all 
it  knows  about  UFOs. I am however totally against irresponsible, conjec-
tural  accusations  being leveled against anyone - the government included. 
I  think  it  is  absurd  that  two persons who are on the same side of the 
fence  -  even  between the same fenceposts - on the UFO issue should be at 
odds  with  one  another.  This  is  through no fault of my own. The author 
knows that anytime he wishes to talk, I am more than willing.

      I  feel now more than ever it is time for responsible, objective, and 
open-minded  research  into all areas scientific, psychological, sociologi-
cal,  medical  and paranormal if we are to make any real progress regarding 
the  UFO  question.  This  is  the time for more cooperation and sharing of 
information  within  the  UFO  community. As our awareness of the UFO issue 
grows  broader,  and  our  notions of the phenomena become more complex and 
unusual,  I think we will find that we will be straining our perceptions of 
reality  itself. It will become increasingly difficult to remain objective. 
It  is  time we put our preconceived notions aside and reexamine the issues 
with a fresh eye.
