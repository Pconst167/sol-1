All I can say is that I have been, for over a year now, pursuing a specific
theory of UFO abductions which has royally ticked off everybody that I've
come in contact with -- believer and skeptic alike.

This is a theory that, I think, designed to make me hate it. I'm primarily
interested in the government's involvement in the UFO phenomena.

Specifically, it seems to me, and I might as well lay out all my cards on
the table at once, it seems to me the abduction phenomenon might just
be a ploy, that the aliens are a paper-mache mask, as I sometimes put it,
for something else that's really going on.

All theories of UFO abductions that I've ever come across (excepting the
entirely skeptical ones put out by people like Philip Klass), they all
include some aspect of the concept of mind control. Now it seems to me
that if people's minds are being controlled, and I think that this
technology is in existence, then we have to ask the question: can we
trust the participant's reports of what they are seeing, in terms of 
perhaps even the UFO's that they are seeing, but certainly the nature of
the abduction experience itself?

Do we even have to assume that the little gray aliens exist simply because
people tell us that they do, even if they believe that they exist?

Drawing from a very old example out of hypnotism, and Aileen being
herself a hypnotherapist, can perhaps tell you more about this -- it was
a very common practice, going back many, many decades, to see if somebody
was under some hypnotism, they would introduce them -- they would take the
subject, hypnotize them, and say that there was a small, black dog in the
room, and he's coming up, and would you pet him.

And the subject will often actually see the dog just as thoroughly, just
as concretely, as they would see any normal dog that you might get out
of the animal shelter.

Now if the human brain can be tricked to that extent, then is it not
possible that the ET's that people are seeing are of an exactly like
substance to that dog?

I think it is. I have done a great deal of research into the subject of
the government's involvement in mind control operations. They like people
to believe that that was all something that they were doing back in the
50's and the 60's, and it was all to catch up with the Russians who had
this huge lead in the field, but they stopped doing it around 1963 and
they never really found anything -- it's all a lie!

I mean, basically, I've just come to the conclusion where I can say that
right now. These programs went very, very far. We got there first. We 
were far ahead of the Russians. I even can give you a memo where Allen
Dulles admitted that to the Warren Commission, of all places.

It went back to World War II, possibly to the 30's, in fact I've just
recently came across some information that occult groups have been doing
experimentations with what they call electronic mind control, going all
the way back to the 19th century. In fact there isn't a single technology
of mind control that doesn't go back to that time.

And so, one of the problems, well, I should say that in researching this
I have not only looked up, read every book available on this subject,
some of which are EXTREMELY hard to find. I mean, I'm sorry to sound too
paranoid but I'm really beginning to get the idea that somebody has been
going around to the libraries and hussling them off the shelves, because
I keep on finding, you know, there are certain books that I keep on
looking for, and I find that they are not checked out, and they are not
only the library shelves either! And I'm wondering what's happened to
them.

But I think I've now amassed quite a library on the subject, and 
I've also gone to Washington, D.C. and I saw some 20,000 documents, these
are de-classified CIA / Defense Department documents, as well as many
interviews with scientists working on these programs back in the 50's and
60's, and these were all compiled by John Marks, for his book _The Search
for the Manchurian Candidate_.

I would suggest that all of you people read that book, but you must
understand that that book is incredibly conservative, and that the whole
subject goes far, far beyond that. I don't know why John Marks wrote it
the way he did. Certainly, there was much more information in his files
than he allowed to come out in his book.

Another good book which I'm sorry to say is very, very difficult to get
a hold of, and probably the best book on the subject, is called _Operation
Mind Control_, and that's by Walter Bowart. But even then, after you've
gone to that literature, you know, you have to search through a great
deal of periodicals and scientific papers and so forth, and also conduct
a great many interviews.

I've interviewed people who claim to have been under mind control,
specifically in Vietnam. And what they describe is very, very similar to
what the abductee's are describing in many respects. Not only that, I've
spoken to abductees. And this is a subject on which I feel a certain
amount of hesitancy in describing and talking about.

One abductee, I called her Veronica in an article I wrote in UFO Magazine
(it's a long and extremely complicated and fascinating case), under
hypnosis, and I did not hypnotize her, in fact she is the one who wanted
the hypnosis and it was administered by a professional hypnotist. In the
4th hypnotic session she described one of her abductions, which as she
dug deeper turned out not to have taken place at all in any kind of 
Unidentified Flying Object, but in fact took place in a house outside
the Los Angeles area.

And of course, we kept zeroing in on the house and its location, and so on
and so forth.

Now, I must state directly here that there is some possibility, of course,
whenever there is a hypnotized subject -- it is often stated wants to
please the hypnotist, therefore might confabulate details that would fit
that hypnotists' particular thesis. I must say that Veronica came up with
the CIA thesis long before I ever met her. She was saying that that was
just one possibility among others.

It also seems to be a nagging possibility that other abductees that I have
read about and talked to have come up with, although they didn't explore
it. There is something about the idea of being in contact with alien
beings that is extremely attractive to them, and they don't want to give
it up very easily.

Anyway, to go back to the hypnotic session -- she had talked about --
I won't give you the details of this kind of terrifying session that she
underwent in this man's house -- but, after the session, I found out
later she was told under some sort of hypnosis, even though the
hypnotist had tried to get her out of it, and she said that she was no
longer in trance, but apparently she still was. But I said, "Well, okay,
let's drive there."

And we did. And I got a location, we found the location, and she suddenly
got very scared and we had to turn back. Well, I later did a little bit
of detective work and I found out who lived there. I won't give the name,
because there is obviously a certain possibility of lible involved, but
I found out that the man who lived in that house was a scientist who
worked on the CIA's mind control programs. These programs had projects
like ARTICHOKE, BLUEBIRD, MK-ULTRA.

Not only that, while on the way there, Veronica described the interior of
this house, including one specific unusual detail that almost nobody has
in his living room, and I later found out from somebody who had been in
that house, that she described it accurately. Unfortunately, Veronica now
says that she can remember nothing of our conversation together and I
didn't tape her admission of what was inside the house, so there is no
way I can prove this, which is why I am very, very wary of mentioning
names, and possibly giving way to a lible suit.

But I will say that for my purposes, and I can't prove it to anybody
else, but it has been proved to me that in at least one instance this
thesis is correct.

I must tell you right now that I am as loath as anybody else to give up
on the alien hypothesis. I mean I grew up with it, I read alot of UFO
books in my time. I've never been plugged into the UFO Network... I've
never spoken to the actual researchers until just recently. And even then
it's only quite tangential. Aileen is probably the one I know best. And
so, it gets very, very difficult for me to give up entirely upon the idea
of the aliens. And I know that people will get angry at me, because I am
exploring another possibility. But it just seems that this is a path
which has to be looked at.

I do know that from the internal CIA correspondence that I've looked at
in Washington, that one of the problems they had, is that -- it was
a "disposal problem" -- whenever they were experimenting on someone to
see how firmly they could control that person's mind, even though they
would try many techniques to get them to forget the session, as it were,
it was almost impossible to make them forget entirely. Memories would
come out, often-time in dreams, of what was going on.

One of the scientists who worked on it, I think that was Martin Warren,
you may recall Martin Warren because he's mentioned prominently in
Philip Klass' skeptical book on UFO abductions. Martin Warren -- what
Philip Klass doesn't tell you is that Martin Warren was a CIA operative
going back to the very early 60's...

But one of the things they mentioned in this context of people remembering,
was they will remember any scenario that they are told. In other words,
you can tell them: "Yes, something happened there... but you know...",
you can fix the memory -- in other words, arrange a cover story. And so,
yeah, the person might wake up in the middle of the night with this
terrible, terrible feeling in that back of his head that he has been
hypnotically told to forget something that happened to him. But as long
as he misremembers that, then the actual truth of the matter will never
come out.

Now I think that something very much like that happened to a man named
Marty Kosky. Marty Kosky was a Finnish citizen. He was staying in
Canada sometime in the mid to the late 1970's, and I have alot of material
from him. He claims to have been a victim of mind control. Now, by the
1970's this whole technology was getting extremely baroque. In the 50's
and the 60's, according to John Mark's informant, nobody knows his name,
I don't even think John Mark's knows his name -- he was given the nickname
"Deep Trance" -- according to Deep Trance the mind control was basically,
the technology had to do with drugs and some with hypnosis. In the 70's
it started to turn to things like implantations in the brain and
microwaves. And the two of them can work together.

Now Marty Kosky claims, this Finnish citizen claims to have been a victim
of the microwave experimentations happening in Canada. He had first, in
1977 or thereabouts, came out with a brochure that was, well you know, he
learned English only a couple of years previously, and he wasn't a
professional writer, and claimed to be microwaved in his brain, and so
obviously you can tell that the pamphlet that he came up with was not very
impressive, and people looking at it probably dismissed him as a nut.

Later, though, he came out with a still not particularly well-written,
but much more convincing set of materials which I believe that Aileen
might have copies of there, and we can certainly get some copies
distributed to you people, if you're interested in it, in which he tells
the story in greater length. He talks about being taken to a hospital,
having things implanted in his brain, hearing of voices. Now I must say
that even though this sounds like the story of an absolute Loony Tune,
I know for a fact that this sort of thing does occur -- I mean, is
technologically possible -- there was a scientist named Allen Fray
in the late 60's, early 70's, who discovered that you can induce, with
microwaves, voices in the brain -- that you can actually hear.

As always, with these things, you only get the first experimentations
along these lines, the first successful notes of what was happening and
then of course, it's all clamped down, you don't get any more
information on follow-up experiments. But we do know, at least from the
early work, that people were able to hear things, directly perceived
words, as spoken over a microphone, directly in their mind... not just
through the ears or anything like that. Which makes me look twice
whenever I hear about people who claim to be hearing voices. Because
I know that that is a classic symptom of schizophrena, but many of these
people are also extremely hypnotizable.

Classic schizophrenics are not easily hypnotizable, yet these people are.
They fall into a separate category, and I'm wondering if the voices that
they hear, if they too might be -- it's a possibility among other
possiblities, let's put it that way -- if these people are also possible
subjects of this sort of experimentation.

Anyway, getting back to Kosky -- I won't tell you his entire story,
because I think it would be better if you read it entirely -- he talks
about being kidnapped and taken to a hospital and given what he called
"spy training". Much of his descriptions of what happened to him in the
hospital I think are quite incorrect, but who knows what happened to his
mind during those times.

I do know that of the released MK-ULTRA papers from the 50's and the 60's
many of the absolute worst atrocities being committed by the CIA -- they
were trying to invade the space between people's ears -- were in fact
taking place in Canada.

So, it's entirely likely that these things will be happening in Canada.
Don't think that simply because Kosky points the finger at the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, doesn't really mean that the CIA or some other
government agency isn't behind it. In fact, some of what I've read has
indicated that the government agency that is now most involved in the
mind control experimentation is called DARPA. And I've also just recently
come across some information that NASA, of all people, of all places, I
don't know why, is possibly, just possibly involved with that. There is
whole story I can tell you along those lines.

One of the things that Kosky was told after he got away from the
hospital and after he was trying to re-establish his sanity after these
terrible experimentations that were done to him, he was told that the
people talking to him were from Sirius. Now, this is one of the
best links I have between the mind control technology and the UFO
abduction phenomenon. That this is a victim of mind control claiming that
he knows that the controllers were using UFOs or aliens as a cover
story for their operations. He was even more explicit in his original
pamphlet. Where he was saying that: "The test program fluctuates from
spying education to meeting humanoids from other planets, people from
Mars and Sirius, if you are a religious person, you can even talk to 
the Lord."

So, in other words, they find out exactly how your personality is
structured, and then they will assume a persona to meet that, which also
makes me look at these people who claim to be hearing voices from Jesus
or from Satan. I know recently there was a rash of people hearing the
voice of Satan, I think it was a group of teenagers out in Tennessee.
And they progressed from -- they were committing horrible atrocities --
first they were watching these terribly violent videotapes which for
some reason are now being made available to teenagers, including
videotapes of actual deaths and then the voices told them to start
torturing and murdering small animals, until finally they actually
murdered one of their numbers.

Well, I know that this sounds like an outrageous story and possibly not
connected to what I am saying, but in fact it is connected because that
was one of the ways they trained -- one of the primary, I should say,
motivations for the entire mind control technology as we know it from
the papers in the 50's and the 60's, was to train people to commit
assassinations. And this is why I am very frightened whenever an
abductee -- and I've had a couple come up with this now -- start talking
about guns. In fact, you know, in that very same abduction hypnotic
session where we are talking about her abduction, she said that the
entities had told her to bring a gun to Martin (!), which did not exactly
make me feel very good, I mean I really don't know what was behind that,
but I must say that I've rather limited my contact with that woman ever
since.

Now I should say, where was I -- oh yes -- again, I'm not used to giving
a lecture to large numbers of people whom I can't see, so I'll probably
be flitting from one thing to another, but anyway, I do have documents
which prove that that was the ultimate goal, to get people to commit
atrocities without any emotions, without any affect. That was the primary
purpose, and the way they did it was first to desensitize people.

There was a doctor named Nereut, who I think in 1974 spilled the beans
to the London Times saying that he was performing these kinds of
experimentations on soldiers of the Green Berets and Navy Seals, and
other Special Forces, and they were taught under hypnosis, and sometimes
not under hypnosis to desensitive themselves to violence, usually
through a series of films, and then you would progress from that to
not caring if you tore the head off a chicken. And then you were told
that the enemy was less than subhuman and so you would go out there and
commit unbelievable atrocities which, if you dig into it, you know were
committed in Vietnam.

And then, according to the some of the people who claim to be mind
control victims that I've spoken to, you can be hypnotized into forgetting
that you committed the atrocities, and this is actually quite beneficial,
because you don't want that sort of thing on your memory, you just won't
be able to function. I spoke directly to -- I can't give his name -- and
I know that it would be very difficult for me to convince your people
of the truth of what he said. All I know is that I sat directly across
from him in the room. And I met him almost by coincidence, I was
interviewing him on another subject and told him I was interested in
mind control and he said this had happened to him.

He gave me specific examples of things that occurred with him in the
1960's, how he was put through this sort of program. Much of what he
described as to how this -- not just the mind control, he knew the
technology involved, he knew many of the terms involved, he would have
to do a great deal of studying in order to have gotten this information.
And he talked about the way that these sort of secret missions would be
directed out of a Naval intelligence ship, which I knew from other
sources to be absolutely true. So I believed what he had to say to me,
in other words. And he fingered the Veterans Administration hospital
out here in Northridge as one place where they continue to have
scientists operate in these capacities. And that was very interesting
to me, because I later have, and I just now had an abductee tell me
that she had memories of something terrible happening at that very same
Veterans Administration hospital.

So that all fits together, again, I'm telling you this to explain to you
why I believe what I believe. I don't necessarily have all of the facts
and that I can put it in a book and prove it, but I have enough that
definitely my suspicion is raised. Now you may ask about implantations,
the scars that Budd Hopkins will show you photographs of, and these
implanations, intracerebreal implantations which are just now beginning
to show up in MRI scans on contactee's. I've just now made friends with
a woman out in Lancaster, who is studying abductees who claims to have
gotten alot of these MRI scans definitely having "bogies" showing up on
them.

Again, this was a part of the technology. There was a book published in
1968, I believe, called _Were We Controlled_ by a man with the psuedonym
of Lincoln Lawrence, and I would suggest that you people read that. Now
this is a book obstensibly about the John F. Kennedy assassination,
looking into the possibility, and this has been raised by a number of
people, outrageous as the possibility may seem, that Jack Ruby and
Lee Harvey Oswald were somehow hypnotically programmed to do what they
did. To tell you the truth, although I am willing to accept any number
of unusual possibilities, I am not entirely convinced of that. However,
I know for a fact that much of the information given in that book
regarding the CIA's and the Defense Department's mind control program
is right on target, because it checked out with material that was
released only about fifteen years later, or ten years later, under
Freedom of Information.

Lincoln Lawrence had to have, and I know that he was in fact an FBI
agent, and therefore probably did have the sort of connections. He had
to have connections to people who were in the know as to the technology
involved. And the technology that he fingers, and it's come up in a
couple of other sources, again we don't have actual internal government
documentation on this, unfortunately just yet, but the technology that he
fingers is something called Radio Hypnotic Intracerebreal Control, that
coupled with another technology called EDOM, Electronic Dissolution Of 
Memory. And basically, EDOM is nothing more or less than "missing time",
exactly what Budd Hopkins talks about. Making people forget what they've
done for the past two or three hours. According to Lincoln Lawrence, and
I'm tending more and more to believe him, that is a technology that we,
not the aliens, but we have had in our hands for my goodness, twenty,
thirty years perhaps. Similarly, Radio Hypnotic Intracerebreal Control is
a technology which, even in its most primitive form, according to some of
the Russian literature mentioned in Lincoln Lawrence's book, and again I
gave a copy to Aileen there, goes back to the 1930's. And that has to do 
with alot of arcane subjects -- implantations, intracerbreal implantations
in the brain.

By sending electronic pulses to these intracerebreal implantations, you
can train the frequencies of the brain to a point of hypnotic 
suggestibility, and then voices, which can be, as I mentioned earlier,
which can be placed into the brain will act as a sort of remote
hypnotist. One that has a far greater suggestibility than an actual
hypnotist that you might pay money to go see. And this is somebody who
can make you believe that you are seeing -- when this is happening to
you they can make you believe that you are seeing, or have seen, if they
want to erase a previous memory, say a van that kidnapped you, when in
fact they might tell you that it was a UFO that kidnapped you. Or, as
another story that I got from an abductee...

He had this strange memory of -- you know, he was talking about his
abduction, and how he climbed into this saucer-shaped craft. But you know,
just before the saucer-shaped craft appeared in his mind he has this
strange memory that there was this truck in there, and that the same guy
who was on the craft was in that truck, and he couldn't quite put the two
together. Well, you know, I heard this from Budd Hopkins once. He said that
there was an abductee he talked who said that there was, you know when he
was abducted, that at first he thought it was a helicopter, or some sort of
helicopter that grabbed him and took him up into the air.

No, it couldn't have been that -- what it was, was this UFO -- and so,
Budd Hopkins is saying well obviously the helicopter was the screen memory
for this terrible UFO experience.

Possibly, but the possibility that I'm looking into is, what if it really
was a helicopter and it was a UFO that was an induced screen memory,
possibly induced by this technology that I'm looking into called Radio
Hypnotic Intracerebreal Control, RHIC. There was a Doctor named
Jose Delgado, still working today, who wrote a book called _Physical
Control of the Mind: Towards a Psycho-Civilized Society_.

These implants that everybody are talking about -- people are thinking
that only a highly advanced technology such as the aliens could come up
with. Well, Delgado was in business as early the late 1950's, he put
these implants in a bull in a Spanish bull-ring, and had the bull charge
him, and then he pushed a button on a box, it was like the same sort of
box you would get with a radio-controlled airplane. He pushed a button --
and there are photographs of this that I can show you -- with the bull
like just a few feet in front of him and ready to gore the guy to death
-- came to a complete stop. Pushed another button, the bull walks away.

Now if that can happen to animals in the 50's why can't it be happening
to abductees?
