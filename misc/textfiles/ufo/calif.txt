Three Coronados spotted an Unidentified flying object land in front of them.
They were coming out of the bingo hall at Sacred Heart Church. 
Mona O' Keefe, Rosemany Thelen and a North Island worker A Mr. Herb, described
the object as a clear plastic bubble about three feet in diameter. As the man
approached the object, it ascended and flew over Orange Ave to Olive Ave and
out over the ocean in the fight path for North Island, according to the two
women. Police said: they had no reports. The women said: they asked around
town, but nobody else said they had spotted the mysterious object.

PETALUMA, Calif. More then a dozen people reported seeing an unidentified 
flying object hovering and darting over this suburban city north of San 
Francisco early yesterday morning. I looked up and saw seveal orange lights
hovering in the sky, said Sue Heart, who was delivering newspapers at 4:30
a.m. when the UFO was sighted. A California Highway patrolman described the
fast flying object as a large, orange X with white lights on the front.  All
witnesses agreed it was not an airplane, and air-traffic and military
spokesmen in the area were unable to explain the object. 
The sighting came three days after Brazilian air-force jets reportedly chased
more then a dozen fast-moving objects marked by intense green, red and white
lights.

  Sightings of strange flying objects have become more frequent in these parts
since late May when a California Highway Patrol officer spotted a peculiar
light in the sky during the wee hours of the morning.
 
  But last weekend, not only did Sonoman Joan Burtson observe an unusual
flying object - this one toyed with her and followed her car for several
blocks before finally giving up and going away.
  The head nurse at a local convalescent hospital dismesses the notion that
the bright object in the dawn sky which taunted her for some 15 minutes was a
space ship carting around some alien beings.   
  "I don't believe in them," she emphatically states.  "I don't know what it
was but I don't believe in UFO's.  Burtson will acknowledge that in the last
few weeks she has heard numerous rumors of UFO sightings in Sonoma Valley. 
For instance, an acquaintance on Eighth Street East reported that ever since
the CHP officer saw the strange light two months ago "that thing has been
hanging around here."  
  However, Burtson's description and that of the CHP patrolman are vastly
different leading one to believe there are several odd things hovering around
up there.    
  What was seen on the early morning of May 21 was a bright orange "X" shaped
object heading at a high rate of speed over the Valley to Petaluma.  
  The only similarity  with Saturday's unexplained illuminating object was
that both were apparently headed in the same direction over the hill to
Petaluma. 
  Burtson remembers it as a "solid mass of white light, it was circular    
about the size of an apple.   
  "There were no colors and it was not flashing."  she recalls.  Burtson's
curious find took place at 5:15 a.m. as she was on her way home from Napa    
after dropping her husband Pat off at work.  
  She initially noticed the stationary light in the vicinity of Eighth    
Street East and Napa Road.  Later as she approached Leveroni Road from    
Fifth Street West the flying object moved along with her and made the  
same right turn.    
  She subsequently made three U turns and each time the object would
seemingly use its remote control to reverse its course also. 
  "I thought to myself this is weird so I made three U turns to test it 
out," she says.
  On occasion, the UFO would become obscured by the trees but almost the    
entire way home, no matter what Burtson would do " it would move   
right along with me," she laughs.  
  Finally, the flying object, for whatever reason, decided the game of    
cat and mouse was over and it headed towards the Diamond A area,   
disappearing over the hill.

  Grass Valley - A silent but colorful flying object zoomed across the sky
over the Sierra foothills just before dawn Friday, according to some local
residents who witnessed the brief event.
  U.S. air defense officials said they had no explanation. "It was a
bluish-green light with a large tail," said Ron Talmage, a security officer
who was nearing the end of a night shift when he saw the unidentified object.  
"It had little pieces flaking off of it like it was coming down," he said. 
"Working nights, I see meteorites, little ones, all the time.  This was
spectacular and it seemed like it was just a few miles away."   
  The blaze of color, reported by most observers to have occurred just before
5 a.m., was seen over a 40-mile area ranging from Colfax to Penn Valley.

One witness reported seeing over her street, LaSalle, an object that the nose
of it looked like a boomerang with a pyramid bottom.  It was a very windy and
particularly clear night and when she looked to the north she saw a formation
coming towards her and her first impression was that it was a flock of birds
and then as it got closer it looked like a formation of stars.  They had a
luminous glow to them and they didn't look like head lamps or anything like
that.  As it came closer she noticed there were more lights going across the
bottom of it like a stingray - solid at least underneath and she could not see
through it.  As it came towards her the lights shut off in the center and only
the outline was left on.  Stayed there for about 5-7 minutes watching.  As it
came over her it went further up in the sky and it was weird as no light in
the belly of it but she could see a formation of it and what it looked like
but it kept fading in and out.  The lights in the front of the object stayed
on, no noise.  The object was much larger than any plane she has ever seen
from wing to wing.  A boomerang has very wide angles from one end to the other
as the object did also, and the nose of the object was not sharp.

REDONDO BEACH - Andy Hoyt admits he has no proof - not anymore, at least -  
that he witnessed the crash of an aircraft that may be the Pentagon's
most carefully guarded secret.
  His sister, Lisa, and her 16-year-old son, Joey, reportedly also saw the  
plane, but both declined to discuss the alleged incident.  Hoyt, an unemployed
Redondo Beach carpenter, says he snapped photographs of the 
plane as it plummeted to the ground in the Sequoia National Forest near
Bakersfield.   
  But the photographs were given to the Air Force, Hoyt says, and the Air   
Force isn't talking.
  Defense experts, however, say Hoyt's description of what he claims he saw
that night fits the most educated guesses of the configuration of the
top secret F-19 stealth fighter - a plane the Air Force will not confirm    
even exists.   
  In a scenario that sounds like a science fiction movie, Hoyt says he
and two relatives saw something drop out of the sky and explode into    
flames on the other side of a hill about a half-mile away.  
  "It seemed like it was something other than an airplane, said Hoyt, 
26, who was on a camping trip. "Believe it or not, I thought it was    
a UFO."   
  Whatever it was, he says, the military has been treating him royally since
he called Edwards Air Force Base when he returned home the following Sunday
evening and told the Air Force about the photographs.   
  Hoyt says he and his party were driving east on state Highway 178  
about 15 miles northeast of Bakersfiled in the early morning hours of July 12
when they pulled over for a brief rest.  He was just climbing back into his
truck when he saw it.
  "All I saw were three red lights and a dark image behind them like  
an upside-down triangle."  Hoyt said, adding that each light was   
at a point of the triangle.  He said he pulled a camera from the   
dashboard of the truck and managed to take two or three pictures 
before the plane disappeared over the hill. 
  Then, a pair of explosions "lit up the sky like it was daylight out."
  Contrary to published reports on the day of the accident, Hoyt says, the
aircraft did not explode before it crashed.  At least one Air Force source has
been quoted as saying plane exploded in midair, which could explain why the
pilot, who was killed, was not able to eject safetly.  
  "It was definitely not on fire when it came down," Hoyt said. "Why couldn't
the guy eject?" 
  After making sure the blaze was reported on an emergency roadside phone, the
party continued to its campground north of nearby Lake Isabella. 
  His call to Edwards upon returning home brought a sudden response from the
Air Force, Hoyt says.  "They took my name and number and within an hour
someone had flown down here and talked to me," he said.
  "They didn't press me, but they wanted to see the film in my camera."

Fireball not man-made, experts say 
 
 Defense experts Tuesday eliminated "space junk or any man-made object" as an
explanation for a mysterious meteoric fireball that streaked across the
Pacific Coast. 
 The object, sighted at 8:22 p.m. (CST) Monday, dazzled stargazers from the
California-Oregon border to the Los Angeles area.
 "It looked like a long, green meteor but it lasted way too long, arcing
across the sky toward the ocean, then it just blew up," Roy Jackson of
Mountain View, Cal., said.
 "It wasn't space junk or any man-made object re-entering the atmosphere, and
we don't track meteors," Del Kindschi of the North American Aerospace Defense
Command at Denver said.  "We heard about it but there weren't any satellites
or man-made space objects entering the atmosphere at that time." (UPI)

Mystery lights return to Saratoga  
 
By Kathy Holub

  A beautiful apparition has been glowing in the night sky over Saratoga, 
leaving viewers baffled and entranced.  
  About 15 people, all agog, called Santa Clara County dispatchers on  
Tuesday night to report a mysterious bright red light that hovered in the    
sky from 8:15 to 8:30 and then disappeared. 
  Dozens of callers described a similar phenomenon on Oct. 16, same time, same
place.    
  "It was very exciting," said Maureen Denton of Los Gatos, who watched last
week's display during a break in her real estate class at West Valley   
College.  
  "It was very bright, much larger than the lights you see on airplanes.  At
one point, something burning or flickering dropped from it.  It was just a
tiny little flicker that came down.  We all went: `Oooh, what was that?'" 
  No one seems to know.  
  That includes Vicki Yauger of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday 
night while lounging with her husband in thier backyard spa.   
  Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving
toward them, then away.  
  Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights.   
  "It was scary.  When it started getting larger, it seemed to be coming
down," she said.    
  Yauger didn't see the object fade from view because she had just gone
into the house.  Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly  
disappeared.   
  Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their
airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force
Base in Lompoc said they didn't launch a thing Tuesday night.  Ditto for Oct.
15.  
  Other watchers of the night sky - air traffic controllers and astronomers at
Lick Observatory - said they saw nothing unusual.
