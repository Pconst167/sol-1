Dear Mr.__________  
 
This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act requests of 19 and  
21 December 1985.   
 
A search of the Defense Central Index of Investigations (DCII), using the  
data furnished in your letter, has disclosed that AFOSI is not maintaining 
any information identifiable with "PROJECT SNOWBIRD,PROJECT SIGMA,PROJECT  
AQUARIUS" or "MJ TWELVE". The DCII is a consolidated listing of files held 
by the Department of Defense. 
 
The releasable portions of AFOSI Headquarters (HQ) Collections Requirement 
(CR) 44A, dated 23 Norember 1983, is attached. HQ CR 44 was superseded by  
HQ CR 44A.  Notations were inserted in the attached document wherever a    
deletion was made.  The notations are explained as follows: 
 
   a.  "b1" pertains to information which is currently and properly   
classified under criteria established by Executive Order and is authorized 
to remain classified in the interest of national security or foreign
