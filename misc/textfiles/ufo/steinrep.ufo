* STEINMAN.REP Comments on Mr. Steinman's absurb statements on the
subject of the "flying saucer" phenomena being  the work of one of
his Gods.



    Throughout  written history women and men looked up in the sky
and   wondered   at   the  machines  they  observed  there.  Those
civilizations  whose  thealogy  and theology supported a positive,
benign,  and  gentle  Creator  experienced these machines, lights,
and  other  constructs  as  friendly,  and manifestations of their
God.  Those  societies  with  a  polarized deity system of Good vs
Trickster   were   decidedly   neutral  when  such  manifestations
occurred,  and  usually  waited  for  near-future events to happen
before  judging  if  the  visitation  was  from Good or Trickster.

    Always,  superior technology has been condemned as work from a
relatively  recent  newcomer  to  mythology,  the Devil. Where the
Trickster  was  not  "good"  or "evil," this new God was decidedly
evil.  It  was  a  Pope who stated that the steam engine was evil,
and  instant  excommunication  from  the Roman Catholic Church was
the  punishment  for  those  evil  sinners who used steam for work
Using steam  meant  that "earning  thy bread  by the sweat  of thy
brow"  became much  easier, and  thus  wrong  in  the  eyes of the
currently adopted God.

    Now  here  we are in the 1989s, and technology has pretty much
cut  our  sweating  down  to  those days when the air conditioning
fails  to  work  in one's apartment. Pushing papers around a desk,
and  punching  a  keyboard,  has  a  permanent  place  in  today's
society.

    So  one  would  think  that  the  equation "Technology = Evil"
would have been put to rest, right?

    No.  Two  years  ago,  on  national TV, a religious extremist,
hysteric,  and  Fundamentalist,  stated  that space craft were the
"work  of the Devil," and then included as "proof" the "Occult New
Age philosophy" in Star Trek and Star Wars.

    Then  we  come  to  William  M.  Steinman, the subject of this
diatribe.

    I  quote  from  his statement dated 01/19/89, Titled "Ultimate
Solutions  To  The  UFO  Phenomena,"  as  found  in  the text file
Steinman.txt.

               "The  Flying  Saucers  originate from an
            'eternal  dimension',  not subject to space
            and time, as we know it."

    Mr.  Steinman  courageously  assumes  a  great  deal here, the
least  of which is that "Flying Saucers" are real, either physical
or  astral in origin. While he does not clue the reader in on what
he  means  by  "eternal  dimension,"  we can assume safely that he
refers  to  an  other  worldly,  etheric "plain of existence" that
occultists,  such  as he, loves to speak of. The existence of such
an astral plain is his second big assumption.

    As  an  occultist  myself,  I agree with Mr. Steinman that the
"UFO  Phenomena"  is  "other  dimensional,"  and  does  not belong
completely  in  the  realm  of  "space  and  time." I do, however,
object to the fact that he has stated his assumption as fact.

               "The  Flying Saucers 'materialize' out of
            this  'eternal  dimension'  into  our  space
            time  frame,  and  have  been doing so since
            time immemorial.

      Assuming  that  using  the  term  "Our  space time frame" is
valid  (who  knows?  It could be *US* infiltrating *THEIR* space),
he  does not provide any clue here to what he means by "since time
immemorial."  The  "UFO  Phenomena,"  as  we presently know it, is
only  as  old  as  written  history, which really wasn't that long
ago.  Mr.  Steinman  assumes an antiquity that is not supported or
supportable.

               There  is  a  direct  relationship between
            'The  Great  Secret' of the Occult teachings,
            'The  Mystery  of Iniquity' of the Bible, and
            the Flying Saucer Phenomena.


     Mr.  Steinman  mentions  his occult teaching, but gives us no
clue  at  all  to  what  he's  talking about. As an occultist, one
would  assume  I'd know what he means by "The Great Secret," but I
have  never  come  across  such  a  reference  once in 28 years of
study. One wonders if Mr. Steinman knows what he's talking about.

     He  also  fails  to  mention  what this "direct relationship"
happens to be!


                The  "Dark Forces" of the Occult, summed
            up  as  Satan (Lucifer) in the Bible, is the
            underlying  source  behind the Flying Saucer
            Phenomena.


     Mr.  Steinman  is  one  of  the relatively few occultists who
believes  in  the  Christian  God  Satan.  I  have  yet to see any
reference in occult literature to such a deity.

     If  we assume, as Mr. Steinman has, that such a deity as this
Christian  God exists, why would It be the "underlining source" of
the  "Flying  Saucer"  phenomena?  And  if  it is, as Mr. Steinman
states,  why  is  it  that  UFOs  were reported before his God was
invented?

     I  am  not  aware of anywhere in the Christian Bible where it
states  that  their  Gods chief mode of transportation are "flying
saucers."  I  suppose  the  Pope  should excommunicate these Gods:
some UFOs appear to be steam powered!


               The  "Dark  Forces"  are  motivating and
            influencing   the   so  called  'conspiracy
            Groups',  who  really  control  every world
            Government,     through    their    various
            Intelligence Agencies.


     The  only  "Dark  Forces"  (note the capitals in deference to
Mr.  Steinman's  fear  and awe of them) here on Earth, as far as I
can  tell,  and  from occultist teachings, are humans, in the form
of  hate  and ignorance. Mr. Steinman claims occult teachings, but
his statements do not support his claim.


               There  does  exist in the United States,
            an  alliance  between the 'materialization'
            of  these  'Dark  Forces'  posing as 'Alien
            Beings'   and  a  high  level  Intelligence
            group,  presumably  'MJ-12',  who  in  turn
            operates   through   the   N.S.A.,  C.I.A.,
            F.B.I., D.I.A., etc.


    In  one  sentence  Mr.  Steinman  says  that  his God Satan is
responsible  for the "Conspiracy Groups," and in the next he joins
such  a  group  by proclaiming that the government has sold-out to
this God. So much for consistency.

               There    do   exist   Above-Top-Secret
            "saucer  bases" in remote portions of the
            United  States (and around the world), in
            which  this  unholy  and immoral alliance
            are    developing    a    very   advanced
            Technology,   based   on   Unified  Field
            Physics,    Genetic    Engineering,   and
            biogenic  breeding in preparation for the
            ultimate  "materialization"  of the "Dark
            Forces"  when  the  "Mystery of Iniquity"
            is  finally  culminated  in "Anti-Christ"
            or "Ahriman" ("Incarnation of Satan").


    While  mythology  is  a wonderful art form, why equate it with
high  technology?  And  why  this  fear of high technology that so
many hysterics cling to?

    Why  has  he stated, flat out and with no proof or qualifiers,
that  the  United  States  of  North  America's  government  is in
"unholy"  and  "immoral"  alliance  with his God? This is not even
good  mythology,  and  nothing in occult teachings suggests such a
belief-- why Mr. Steinman says it does is a good question.


               This  entire  subject  matter  remains
            the   most  highly  classified  and  most
            closely   guarded  secret  of  all  time,
            under the cloak of 'National Security'.


    Then how was he, above all others, made privy to this secret?


               Faith  in  God  is  what  protects  us
            against  this.  Paranoia  is  what allows
            the  'materialization' or Psycho-Physical
            manifestation  of  the  M.I.B.  (or other
            diabolical  forms) to 'visit' you, If you
            know too much.


     Mr.  Steinman  clearly  has  faith in being paranoid. He does
not  state  which of his Gods to "have faith" in. There has yet to
be  any  such "visits" by "diabolical forms," to my knowledge, and
I've  studied  such  things--  all  such  references are generally
understood to be allegory.

     I  sincerely  hope  that such a "diabolical form" has come to
take  Mr. Steinman away, and thus removed one more fruit-cake from
the  field  of  Ufology.  Such lunatics give the field a bad name,
which it already suffers greatly under.
