Dear Reader,
    This is a new experience for me because I am trying to do several
new and innovative things at the same time. Last Spring, I got a new
computer. It is Tandy 1000 TL/2 with a 40 Megabyte hard disk, 3.5 in.
double sided density @ 720 kbyte disk drive, a 5.25 in. double sided
double density @ 360 kbyte disk drive, and internal modem (300,1200,
2400 baud rates). My old computer (9yr old) is a RADIO SHACK TRS-80
model 2 that uses 8 inch diskettes. I also do most of my bulletin
board work with it. On it, I have accumulated about 70 Megabytes of 
information and computer applications on those 8 inch diskettes. I 
will slowly get cables between the 2 computers to transfer info for
these newsletters back and forth. My reason for the above explanation
is enable you to figure out how to set up your computer switches to
read these newsletter diskettes.
    Since pollution is a growing problem in this world, swapping news-
letters on these small diskettes is equivalent to sending several hard
bound books through the mail. The anti-pollution saving is all the 
component paper, waste, and related transportation involved in those 
hard bound books not used. Still further savings could come from using
electronic formats of the same info on the diskettes in transmission.
All these diskettes are reuseable helping stop garbage in landfill 
problems. There are probably other ecological implications to news-
letter swapping by computer diskettes that I haven't even thought of.
    So much for the social justification of this newsletter swapping
by computer diskette. I have accumulated about 20 Megabytes of bullet-
in board messages etc. relating to the UFO ET mystery. That is the ac-
tual purpose of this newsletter. Last year, there were an estimated 
54 MILLION personal computers in use. This represents a new and virgin
market for ideas, applications, and products from those with the inge-
nuity and incentive to develop it. In that UFO ET mystery, there are a
range of people from SPACE BROTHERS setting up a UTOPIA solving all of
mankind's problems to ET INVADERS looking to use mankind as a food su-
pply. The actual case is probably somewhere between those 2 extremes.
In all of these cases, mankind has an exciting adventure or disaster
coming soon. 
    If it is disaster, mankind will be forced to develop survival tac-
tics and supplies to cope with it. If the situation resembles the NAZI
holocaust of the 1930s and 1940s, we have a lot of documentation about
that period to indicate problems, solutions, and trends which could be
helpful in case of an ET INVASION. In all of these situations, a need
for communication tactics/channels has to be developed. That is also a
secondary purpose of this diskette newsletter.
    If the SPACE BROTHERS are to set up a UTOPIA, they can't do every-
thing themselves, no matter how advanced they are technologically. In
that case, mankind will have to organize and perform certain basic
functions which aid those SPACE BROTHERS. If these functions are only
social traps to lure humans into ET FOOD VATS, humanity needs social
survival skills as well as new building skills to cope. These building
skills range from new technology things to inner personal modification
of behavior and attitudes. Again, communication is needed to impart
these things from person to person. New economies and barter systems
will have to be built to replace obsolete and bankrupt things. Networ-
king persons operating as a team will do more than any single person
working alone.
    Against this background, the enclosed files cover info and ideas
developed in the last 50 years to understand the UFO ET Mystery. You
need this info to develop your own personal survival tactics and net-
work whether it be for UTOPIA or ET INVASION. Some of this info may be
disgusting to your finer sensitivities but needed to develop your per-
sonal tactics. If you are too lazy to examine this, you are an invit-
ing target for everything from hungry bloodsucking ET INVADERS to the
greedy paranoid survivalists hawking essentials for UTOPIA. 
    I need you and your contacts to form a network to continually dis-
tribute info and other help if needed. This network concept can work
whether it be under UTOPIA or INVASION problems. For now, consider
this diskette like the old round robin letter where you add your 2
cents worth and send it on to the next link in the network. Also feel
free to duplicate this diskette for as many interested parties as you
can. This duplicating can create a pyramid effect like in a chain
letter. 
                    MAY YOUR DESTINY BE THE BEST POSSIBLE!!!

    Contact me if you have questions. If I can't answer them myself,
there may be a better specialist in that network that I can refer you 
to in a more personal way.
