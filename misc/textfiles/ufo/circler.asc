                  Strange Things are Afoot at the "Circle (R)"

                   O*****[============- -============]*****O 

      One  thing  that I know for sure is that "you never can be  to  sure" 
    what is going on and what the truth really is about certain things. 
     
      Just  a few days ago my little sister called me on the phone and said 
    "I am returning your call." I  set there for a moment and said "what ?" 
    She  said  that I had called her that morning just before 8am and  that 
    she  had just gotten the message and was returning my call.  Quickly  I 
    questioned  myself  and recounted all of my actions that morning up  to 
    that  very moment and I said "I haven't called anyone this morning,  in 
    fact  I have only been on the phone once this morning and that  was  to 
    answer a call from the wife,  and this is the second time on the  phone 
    this morning." 
     
      Gina  didn't  think long about what I had said before she  came  back 
    with a "well it sure sounds like you on the recording and it gave  this 
    same number." 
     
      Well  it was my number all right.  She played the tape for me  and  I 
    took  a recording of it.  Sure enough it was my voice,  and I had  even 
    give  the time of the call and my voice phone number both of which were 
    correct. It was just as if I had made the call, only one small catch, I 
    had not made that call. 
     
      Her  answering machine is computerize and counts the number of  calls 
    that  come  into  her office and it had counted that message as  a  new 
    call. 
     
      That  morning she came into the office before 8am and had 3  messages 
    on the first part of the tape.  She listened to them and then reset the 
    tape as she always does every morning. The machine always records right 
    over  the  top  of the last messages unless you tell  it  to  save  the 
    message. She left the office for a little bit and came back and checked 
    and  the machine said there were two new messages and she  played  them 
    back.   There  was my voice as big as life,  it gave the time and  made 
    mention of our elder sister who is deceased as if she were still alive. 
    This  made  me  think  it was an old message,  but the  tape  had  been 
    recorded  over,  it had run several other messages over the top of  any 
    old messages that might have been at the start of the tape. If that had 
    been  an  old message it would have been from last  December  and  that 
    would  have made it at least 4 months old.  The next thing is that  the 
    computer counts all of the calls that come in since the last time  they 
    were  reviewed  and it said there was two new calls which counted  "my" 
    message as a new call. 
     
      The  next message after "mine"  was from her husband and after it the 
    machine  gave the date and time of the call.  We noticed that after  my 
    message it had not given the date and time after the call but it was my 
    voice that had given the time of the call.  This was unusual to say the 
    least.   It had counted it as a call,  yet had not posted the time  and 
    date  after  the call.  It played it and counted it as a  call  so  why 
    didn't  it  put the time and date after it as it normally does ?  Right 
    after that was her husband and it counted the time and date as normal. 
                                                                 
      How could an old message come through an old tape as if it were a new 
    message ? How could the computer count it as a new call and not put the 
    time and date after the call ? The time was right on the money  and was 
    given  by "my voice."  Had I actually made the call  the machine  would 
    have placed the time and date after the call and  there would have been 
    little doubt that I had made the call myself and  just "forgotten about 
    it"  or perhaps was lying and saying that I had not made  the call when 
    in fact I had.  The oddity itself indicates  that something  out of the 
    normal had taken place though and gave certain evidence to prove that I 
    was telling the truth and I had not made that call. 
     
      The fact that her husband had called right after my "call" had proven 
    very close to the fact when the call had been recorded and it was right 
    in the correct time slot. 
     
      I told her of a UFO crash that had not been to many days ago at which 
    certain  people  had gathered to talk about the event.   Certain  other 
    people  were  seen and some even talked to others there and later  when 
    they  were contacted by these people about the crash they knew  nothing 
    about it.  They said they had not been there at all and could prove it. 
    So  how  is it these other people swear that they saw and  even  talked 
    with  certain  of these other people if they were not there ? And  what 
    about the UFO crash ? Did the thing just up and vanish without a  trace 
    and with no other "media"  reports ? Was it as if it had never actually 
    happened ? If so then what did happen ? 
     
      So  strange things are afoot at the "Circle (R)"  and if you  see  or 
    hear  from someone who later says they were not there or had not  tried 
    to  contact  you,  and don't know what you are talking about  don't  be 
    surprised.
