ALIEN EXPLORATION

Interplanetary Business Deals by John Lear


I am an airlane captain for a major cargo airlane; I've flown about 160
different types of aircraft in over 50 different countries. I held 17
world speed records in the Lear Jet, and I'm the pilot who holds the
most FAA Certificates issued to a single individual. I have been a com-
mercial pilot for 30 years; I've been flying for 35 years. I hold the
professional Air Traffic Controllers award for Outstanding Airmanship
presented in 1968, and the Symons Wave Memorial. I have flown missions
worldwide for various government agencies, I flew in Southeast Asia
between 1966-73, I have flown both experimental and production test
flights. I have flown for 28 different airlines and have over 16,000
hours of flight time, over 12,000 of which are jet transports. I was
the youngest American to climb the Matterhorn in Switzerland in 1959,
and I am a senior vice commander of the American Legions Post No. 1.
I have four daughters and have lived in Las Vegas for about 20 years.
I grew up mostly in Santa Monica. I studied Industrial Design at the
Art Center College of Los Angeles and was a State Senate candidate in
Nevada in 1980. My father was William P. Lear, Sr. who not only helped
develop the first car radio, the eight track stereo, and automatic
pilot for our first jet fighters, but who developed the Lear Jet, one
of the first and most successful of all business jet transports.
  About six years ago I stumbled headlong into the subject of UFO's.
I began to search for the truth, and what I found out was this. We
have recovered over 40 discs belonging to alien civilizations far
beyond our solar system. The U.S. Navy has successfuly flown several
of them under a secret program begun in the middle '50s. The U.S.
Government has in cryogenic storage at least 25, but probably closer
to 100 alien bodies, representing as many as 15 different species.
That at least three of these aliens were captured alive, one of them
is still living at the Nevada Test Site area S-4. That our government
has been in business with little gray aliens for many years, having
been duped into thinking they were making some kind of agreement in
which we traded permission to abduct humans in return for super -
advanced technology. That man was genetically engineered by a vastly
superior alien species over a period of several hundred thousand
years with 64 separate external corrections in what was essentially
an experiment, to make man what he is today, and what he is referred
to in secret government documents is , a container. We are simply
containers. Containers of physical matter, blood, enzymes, hormones,
souls, thoughts, emotions ... all of it engineered, multiplied,
grown, harvested, and processed by a higher entity, and their
licensees.
  At the end of the corporeal life of the container, the soul is
extracted and either stored for future use or reintroduced into a
fetal container. To what purpose? It's probably none of our business
anymore that it's  a cow's business what they are here for. If you
have wondered why  the government has never come clean on the subject
of flying saucers, maybee you should consider why we never take the
trouble to brief cows on the reason for their existence.
  The sponsors of these miracles travel between star systems at
speeds far greater than a thousand times the speed of light. To
travel great distances in space without breaking the laws of physics,
which quite properly state that nothing can travel faster than the
speed of life, you first have to understand that gravity is instanta-
neous, and that when you harness gravity you control everything.
You have also to visualize space as a fabric, a substance. What we
think of as empty space can be pulled this way and that by strong
gravitational attraction. If you can exert a strong enough gravita-
tional pull on a small portion of space you can actually pull it
toward you, step inside it so to speak. That portion of space that
you stepped inside will snap back to its original location, with
you inside it, without violating the laws of physics and without
time having even moved.
  The way that this strong gravitational force is generated in the
craft is through an anti-matter reactor. The reactor is about the
size and shape of half a basketball and sits on a metal plate.
Inside the half sphere is a receptacle which holds a thin, arrow-
shaped, 233 gram silver of Element 115. As this tinypiece of element
115 is bombarded with protons, it propagates into Element  166 which
instantaneously decays back to 115.  The product of this reaction is
antimatter and this antimatter is used for two purposes, the  first
of which is to create a strong gravitational field  which is then
channeled and amplified to  generate almost inconceivable quantities
of gravitational attraction. The second purpose for anti-matter is
to generate positive voltage  through the use of a thermionic
generator to power other equipment in the craft.
  The gravity that is generated is focused through a save guide and
and then channeled and amplified through three gravity amplifiers
which, when swiveled and focused on the desired destination,
whether to be 100 miles or 100 light years away, draws a portion
of the fabric of space from the destination to the departure point.
When the gravity is then turned off and the attraction no longer
exists, whatever was enveloped by that portion drawn from the
destination, is now at the destination. THis concept is about as
difficult to explain as television would have been to a caveman.
  The U.S. does have secret bases on the moon. The NASA projects
of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Spacelab and the Shuttle are all just
cover for what's really going on. The US also has secret  bases
on Mars. And there are Martians. They look just about like us and
are a little more advanced. After a climatic disaster many years
ago on Mars, the Martians moved underground.
  Contemplate something closer to home. There are at least 70
different species of aliens here on an infinite variety of
missions. And there are a number of secret underground bases
operated jointly between us and the aliens. One of the largest
is at Dulce, New Mexico. And yes, there is a secret US test
facility for extraterrestrial disks at Area 51 in Nevada. If you
want to see it for yourself they  still test at sunset on
Wednesday nights; the last time I saw it was April 3rd, 1991.
Take I-15  to a few miles north of Las Vegas and then go north
on highway 93. Just after Ash Springs take the left fork in the
road which will be highway 357, and after you come down from
Hancock Pass into the valley you will see a straight dirt road
about 10 miles long. That's the northeast entrance to Groom Lake.
Turn off a few hundred feet, and look to the south at sunset or
a little after. You're going to have to have a powerful telescope
or binoculars to see the disc shape, but you woll be able to see
the craft with the naked eye, about 12 miles away. Don't proceed
further than about 5 miles down that road, as it is an unmarked
but highly restricted area. And there are a number of secret
underground bases in the Antelope Valley. If you are interested
in seeing any of this drive around the Tehachapi mountains, east
of Lancaster, or around El Mirage Dry Lake on a weeknight.
  And yes, Aids was developed by the US Navy between 1969 and
1972. Credit for the perfection of the virus and its cure was
given to R.M. Donner. The virus was first released in Africa in
1975 with laced doses of the small pox vaccine. Africa is now
almost 100% infected. The AIDS virus was introduced into the
United States in 1978 in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles
with laced doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine distributed by the
Center for Disease Control, who specifically targeted the white,
male homosexual group. This was done so that AIDS would spread
rapidly wothout anyone being too concerned, as they would dismiss
the disease as only a concern to homosexuals or drug addicts.
The population has been led to believe that the AIDS virus can
be prevented through judicious use if prophylactics and/or
rubber gloves, when in fact HTLV 1, one form of AIDS, has been
airborne in Southeast Asia for a number of years. The stated
goal of the US Navy for the AIDS virus was infection of 75 %
of the world's population before 1995. If this sounds unbelie-
vable, this is because there are a number of things you don't
understand about world population growth versus food
consumption. The reason you don't understand these things is
you have not been fed this type of information because it's
none of your business. And if you still think you have a
government by the people and for the people, you are as ignorant
as you are misinformed. Your attention has been directed towards
tying up yellow ribbons for our returning troops of a government
that spent 75 billion dollars drilling 100,000 barefoot Iraquis,
most of whom had no beef with the US., but happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time. We liberated one of the most
opressive sheikdoms of the 20th century and effectively preven-
ted Iraq from  getting their 200 billion barrels of oil reserves
to the world market, which would have cut the price of oil in
half. We spent eight or nine months vilifying the butcher of
Baghdad and teaching him that the most powerful nation on earth
is still incapable of searching out and destroying a single
individual. (Exception to the rule: Willie Nelson, Pee Wee
Herman, JFK, John Lennon, Charlie Chaplin, Marylin Monroe,
and all destroyed or killed by CIA).
  And what about government people who are involved? How come
nothing leaks? Well, if you truly believe that the government
can't keep a secret when it wants to, then you are worse than
terminally ignorant. You are willfuly ignorant.
  I know this stuff is true but you don't. You don't have
access to the proper information. And only if you dig for and
find the information yourself are you going to believe it!
Find a friend in an aerospace related government project.
Ask him this question that will not in any way compromise his
oath of security. Ask him, "Would you bet your life that
John Lear is wrong?"---
