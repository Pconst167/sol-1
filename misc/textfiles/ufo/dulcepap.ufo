         Grudge 13 & the DULCE PAPERS are of great interest to me. If
         you have any information to share on these topics I would be
         most interested in corresponding with you. I can be reached

   A joint US / EBE facility exists beneath the Archuleta Mesa
   near the town of DULCE NEW MEXICO. This facility has been in
   existance in one form or another since 1948. The facility proper
   is located one kilometer underground. The base is approximately
   2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost overlooks the town.
   There is a government road 36 feet wide going into the area.

   In 1979, something happened at the base with 66 humans
   killed and 44 humans escaping. It is suspected that the US
   attempted unsuccessfully to take over the base by force.

     One of the people who in escaped the facility was a CIA agent who,
   prior to leaving, made some notes, photos, and videotapes, before going
   into hiding. He has been in hiding ever since, and every six
   months he contacts each of five(?) people he left copies of the
   material with. His instructions were that if he missed four
   successive contacts, the people could do whatever they want with
   the material. The individuals caring for the packages were non
   technical in nature and new very little about the documents.

     In December 1987 a Description of these so called "Dulce Papers"
   was issued, and received by many researchers. The leak is suspected
   to have come from one of the caretakers of the papers. The Dulce Papers
   themselves were said to be composed of the following:

         o     25 black and white photos
         o     6 minute video tape of Dulce Facility with no dialogue
         o     set of technical papers pertaining to Facility

   The contents included at least the following:

         o     discussion of copper & molybdenium
         o     discussion of magnesium & potasium (electrolytes??)
         o     lots of medical terminology
         o     discussion of ultraviolet light & gamma rays
         o     discussion of true purpose of the EBE's
         o     discussion of usage of cow blood
         o     discussion of DNA manipulation
         o     discussion of "almost human beings"
         o     discussion of "creation of nongender being"
         o     discussion of DNA manipulation
         o     discussion of "almost human beings"
         o     sketches of the photos

   A number of questions come to mind after reviewing this information

      o   Who were the 5 individuals that each recieved the "Dulce
          Papers" package

      o   In light of the seriousness of this material why has not
          one of them gone public with the information itself?

      o   Does the videotape actually show living EBE's?

      o   Is the CIA agent still on the run and does he still check
          in with the holders of the packages?

      o   Who leaked the information about the contents of the Dulce
          Papers?

              DO YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS?
