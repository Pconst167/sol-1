   	A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THE "UFO ENTITIES"
        --------------------------------------------------------

 		        by

                          Gordon Creighton



 	This article, which appeared originally in FSR 29/1 (October 1983)
 is reprinted now at the request of a number of readers, and to remind all
 our readers of what lies ahead for Mankind.  Ever since its publication,
 the article has been treated throughout the world with total silence, and
 and there is a general agreement among all Ufologists on both sides of the
 Atlantic never to give it a mention.

 	FSR Consultant Dr Richard F. Haines expected me to print his
 comphrehensive REVIEW OF EXPLANATORY HYPOTHESES FOR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL
 PHENOMENA, and I promptly did so.  (FSR 32/2 - 1987.)  But it might be
 noted that he did not deem it necessary to include the slightest reference
 to my work in his survey, even as a minimal gesture of courtesy.

	Four of the leading experts in Ufology in the world have written
 me privately to say that they think I am on the right track.  Only one
 of them - Ann Druffel - has had the guts to say so publicly.  EDITOR


	-----     -----     -----     -----     -----     -----


  	One of the more curious features of the followers of the various

 religions is that, being so dogmatically certain that in their own

 particular little faith they already possess the whole Truth about all

 things in Heaven and Earth, it almost never occurs to any of them to look

 elsewhere and find out what the followers of other religions may know or

 may have discovered.


	This is certainly a pity, for study of all the great world-religions

 - and notably Islam - would yield valuable clues as to the true nature

 of the so-called "UFO Phenomenon" and would rapidly eliminate much of

 the fatuous "Space-Age Mythology" that has been spawned in such profusion

 over the last three decades.


 	Islam knows, in fact, of the existence of THREE entirely separate

 and distinct species of intelligent beings in the Universe, and indeed

 can furnish suprisingly precise details regarding their natures and roles

 and activities.


 		       ANGELS, MEN, AND JINNS


	The first category is of course that of the ANGELS or Messengers

 (Greek: ANGELOS; Hebrew: MALACH; Arabic: MALAK).  These are high beings

 created of LIGHT.


	The third category are MEN, with bodies created according to the

 QUR'AN, of CLAY, or, in other words, this being poetic language, they

 have physical bodies assembled from the mineral and chemical elements of

 our PERIODIC TABLE - the "PLANETARY BODY", as Gurdjieff used to call it.


 	The second category, however, and the one with which we are here

 concerned, is the category of those beings (CREATED BEFORE MAN WAS) who

 are referred to collectively in Arabic as AL-JINN *1*.  Although there

 is some dispute about it among Arab grammarians, most of their lex-

 icologists seem to hold that the word derives - as Arabic words almost

 invariably do - from a verb-root, namely JANNA, "TO HIDE OR TO CONCEAL"

 - indeed a very fitting derivation for the name of these creatures.


	Whereas the bodies of Angels are of light and the bodies of men

 are of the gross elements of the Earth, the bodies of AL-JINN consist

 of what is variously translated as "ESSENTIAL FIRE" *2*, or "ESSENTIAL

 FLAME", or "SMOKELESS FIRE" *3*, or "SMOKELESS FLAME", and it is

 specifically stated in the QUR'AN (Surah XV, 26 and 27) THAT THEY WERE

 CREATED BEFORE MANKIND WAS. (Some scholars have speculated that these

 might be the "PRE-ADAMIC MEN" whose existence is hinted at here and

 there in the Holy Bible.)


	There has been much debate among modern students of Arabic as

 to precisely what these terms "MIN NARI AL-SAMUMI" *2* and "MIN MARIJIN

 MIN NARIN" *3* can conceivably mean in modern parlance, and some

 scholars have concluded that, in using these terms, the Prophet Muhammad

 (the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) was there attempting to

 describe what Western occultists have tried to describe by such terms

 as ETHER, or maybe the so-called ETHERIC OR ASTRAL PLANES. (I have also

 seen it suggested that some sort of PLASMA is indicated.)


	(Needless to say, such concepts as ETHERIC PLANE and ASTRAL

 PLANE have no meaning for modern Science and, so far as I know, apart

 from Dirac, the physicists have abandoned their speculations regarding

 the existence of an ether.)



 		 THE SOURCE OF THE JINNS



	Wherever it is that the JINNS are thought of as being normally

 located, it seems highly likely that the source of many of them, at any

 rate, is not very distant from us, and some Muslim scholars who have

 become aware of the current Western research into the so-called "UFO

 Phenomenon" and have reflected awhile upon it have concluded - and I

 think correctly - that maybe the best way we can start to visualize

 these matters is by thinking of the JINNS AS BEING VERY CLOSE INDEED

 TO US AND AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SOMEHOW VERY FAR FROM US.  IN OTHER

 WORDS, ON SOME OTHER DIMENSION, OR IN SOME OTHER SPACE/TIME FRAMEWORK,

 "RIGHT HERE', OR MAYBE IN A WORLD OF ANTI-MATTER RIGHT HERE, OR

 OCCUPYING AS IT WERE SOME OTHER UNIVERSE THAT IS HERE, BEHIND ALICE'S

 MIRROR: "A MIRROR-UNIVERSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPACE-TIME

 CONTINUUM" AS IT HAS BEEN NEATLY PUT BY SOME INVESTIGATORS.


	The QUR'AN, however, is not clear on this, and admittedly it looks

 as though it is very possible that some of the JINNS could be fully

 physical and what we call extraterrestrials, while other species of

 them are of an altogether and finer sort of matter, corresponding to

 what various UFO investigators have tried to indicate by such terms

 as "ULTRATERRESTRIAL" or "METATERRESTRIAL".


	In thinking abou these ideas, we might bear in mind the theory

 of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky regarding the possible

 existence of other, more subtle, levels of matter on which the elements

 of the Periodic Table of our own chemical world are repeated - and, if

 I understand him aright, repeated more than once, on more than one

 level.  The early writings of Dr. Meade Layne in the USA about the

 "DENSE ETHERIC WORLD" from which he maintained that the UFO entities

 and their craft originated should also be borne in mind.  (His book,

 THE COMING OF THE GUARDIANS, was published in 1958, and may prove one

 day to have been very important indeed.)  Certain of the benevolent

 JINNS may well be our "Guardians".


	That there is some close affinity, or some link of destiny

 between JINNS and Mankind seems certain, for although the vast majority

 of the JINNS are DEVILS, SHAYTANS *4*, nevertheless we are assured in

 the QUR'AN that some among their many species are "goodies" and are

 capable of salvation.  For it is specifically stated that Muhammad was

 sent as a Messenger to both Mankind and the JINNS, so that, in the

 Final Days, some of the JINNS will enter into Paradise, while the rest

 of them will be cast down into Hell.  Their revelation to IBLIS *5*,

 the Top Devil ( = SATAN) is in general somewhat obscure.  In the QUR'AN

 IBLIS is certainly described as a JINN, but elsewhere in the QUR'AN he

 is also described as an ANGEL. (Surely the explanation is that IBLIS

 is that same high being, originally of Angelic status, who rebelled

 against God and is named in the Christian texts as LUCIFER?)


	Had we the space, much more might be said about the JINNS and

 their doings, but only a brief account of their main characteristics

 can here be given.  Their principal features, as listed below, are as

 I have gathered them from all the Muslim written and traditional

 sources that I have been able to consult over the past 15 years.  The

 reader can see for himself the parallels with the reported features

 of UFO entities and can draw his own conclusions.  I hope I do not

 have to labour the point, space being precious.



 	         THE CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JINNS


	1. In the normal state they are not visible to ordinary human

 sight.

	2. They are, however, capable of materializing and appearing

 in the physical world.  And they can alternately make themselves

 visible or invisible at will.

 	3.  They can change shape, and appear in any sort of guise,

 large or small. (See for example, Ahmad Jamaludin's excellent report,

 A WAVE OF SMALL HUMANOIDS IN MALAYSIA IN 1970, in FSR Vol. 28, No. 5).

 Ahmad Jamaludin is a Muslim, and he knows, of course, what it is that

 we are talking about.

 	4. They are able also to appear in the guise of ANIMALS. (Yetis?

 Pumas? Loch Ness Monsters?)

	5. They are inveterate liars and deceivers, and delight in

 bamboozling and misleading mankind with all manner of nonsense. (See

 the average Spiritualist SEANCE for examples of their activities, and

 also the usual "communications" from UFO entities in close-encounter

 cases.)

	6. They are addicted to the abduction or kidnapping of humans.

 (The Scotsman Robert Kirk, who wrote "THE SECRET COMMONWEALTH" in 1691,

 evidently "knew more than was good for his health", and was killed by

 them.)

	7. They delight in tempting humans into sexual intercourse and

 liaisons with them, and Arabic literature abounds with accounts of this

 kind of contact by mankind with both the "goodies" and the "baddies"

 among the JINNS.  There are also even a considerable number of accounts

 of encounters between the "goodies" and famous Muslim saints.  For

 example, the book MANAQUIB AL-ARIFIN *6* has a number of very significant

 references to contacts between such higher beings, and JALAL AL-DIN RUMI,

 Islam's greatest mystical poet, who lived from 1207 to 1273.


	(I often wonder which category of JINNUS it was that was en-

 countered in Brazil by the farmer A.V.B.  See my third article on

 "A.V.B.", POSTCRIPT TO THE MOST AMAZING CASE OF ALL, in FSR Vol. 11,

 No. 4, August 1965.)


	IN OFFICIAL ISLAM - AND THIS CANNOT BE OVER-EMPHASIZED - THE

 EXISTENCE OF THE JINNS HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMPLETELY ACCEPTED, EVEN LEGALLY,

 AND EVEN TO THIS DAY, IN ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE.  THE FULL CONSEQUENCES

 IMPLIED BY THEIR EXISTENCE WERE WORKED OUT LONG AGO.  THEIR LEGAL STATUS,

 IN ALL RESPECTS, WAS DISCUSSED AND FIXED, AND THE POSSIBLE RELATIONS

 BETWEEN THEM AND MANKIND - ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO QUESTIONS OF

 MARRIAGE AND PROPERTY! - WERE SERIOUSLY EXAMINED BY JURISTS, AS THE

 GREATEST AND MOST AUTHORITATIVE WESTERN SOURCE, THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF

 ISLAM, CONFIRMS.


	Stories of sexual commerce between JINNS and mankind have been of

 perennial interest to Arab readers, and it is important at this point to

 mention that in CHINESE literature (and in China the Han population are

 not Muslims - only certain of the smaller minority peoples of the North-

 West and Far West are) there is also a considerable tradition of this

 sort which awaits examination by Ufologists.


	 The great Arabic literary catalogue known as the FIHRIST *7*,

 compiled in the year 373 of the Muslim Calendar ( = A.D. 995) by

 Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Abi Ya'qub al-Nadim al-Warraq al-Baghdadi, lists

 no less than sixteen works dealing with this theme. (Compare also the

 European occultists' records of sexual contact between men and female

 SYLPHS, as well as the copious mediaeval Christian records relating to

 INCUBI and SUCCABAE.)


	Most Westerners will discount all this talk about the JINNS with

 the usual argument that the Arabs "are barbarians anyway".  Let me

 therefore point out that, in A.D.995, when the FIHRIST was written, the

 brilliant civilization of the Arabs was incomparably higher than anything

 elsewhere in the world except for China and that our Christian, Western,

 RENAISSANCE owes its origins as much to our contact with Islam (the

 Crusades) as to the early percolation of Greek learning to the West.

 As a matter of fact quite a lot of the philosophy and the literature of

 the Greeks reached us first, not in Greek at all, but in the Arabic

 translations secured from Cordoba and Toledo in Spain in the 10th and

 11th centuries, when the Muslims still held most of Spain.  It is only

 in the last few centuries, and particularly since the Industrial

 Revolution and the growth of modern materialistic Science, that the

 West has forged ahead.  But in 1200 A.D. Muslim Science was in the

 lead, particularly in such fields as Medicine, Mathematics, and

 Astronomy, and it would be grossly impudent to assume that our current

 "superiority" over them has anything permanent about it.


 	8. THE JINNS are wont to snatch up humans and teleport or

 transport them, setting them down again - if indeed they ever do set

 them down again - miles away from where they were picked up, and all

 this is the "twinkling of an eye". (See my first article on TELEPORTATIONS,

 about the Spanish soldier who, on October 25, 1593, was suddenly taken

 from Manila in the Philippine Islands across the Pacific to Mexico City.

 In FSR Vol. 11, No. 2, 1965).


 	9. The Arabian tradition asserts that, throughout all known

 history, there have been a few particular human beings who, through

 some strange favour, have "been in league with the JINNS" or "had a

 compact with the JINNS" - to such a degree that the JINNS have endowed

 them with what we regard as "preternatural powers" - ie., PSYCHIC POWERS.

 These humans have consequently become known as wonder-workers,

 soothsayers, and MAGICIANS. (Either "white magicians" or "black

 magicians", depending of course upon what sort of JINNS they were in

 league with.)


	Here again, compare the European tradition about individuals who

 have discovered how to collaborate with the KINGDOM OF THE SYLPHS or the

 FAIRIES.  For example, there is the case of the "working partnership",

 not more than seventy years ago, between a SYLPH and a highly successful

 Parisian dealer in rare old books.  The SYLPH made its contribution by

 acting as the "scout" and finding out where and in whose possession the

 rare books were.  All the dealer had to do then was to approach the

 owners and offer to buy!


 	10.  Along with all these displays of prowess by the JINNS there

 goes, finally, a tremendous TELEPATHIC POWER and the ability (to use an

 age-old term) to "CAST A GLAMOUR" over their human victims.  Our UFO

 records are already full of evidence of this.


	How much of what we see happening today, at the highest levels

 of international politics, as well as in ordinary human affairs, can

 be attributed to this subtle control and interference in our lives by

 insidious and unseen forces!  Indeed, this is one of the prime reasons

 for the parlous state in which man finds himself.  Some recent reports

 from UFO investigators hint at alien plans to provoke war here and drive

 the Gadarene Swine (mankind) over into the abyss.


	The present-day Christians, who generally seem to have very

 little sense of curiosity, are apparently quite happy to pass their

 days in total ignorance of all this.  But a careful study of the New

 Testament (AND ONLY IN THE ORIGINAL GREEK!) will show clearly that

 nothing of what is said above was unknown either to the Teacher and

 Healer Jeshu of Nazareth or to his principal followers - particularly

 Paul. (Incidentally, Christians may like to know that in Islam the full

 name and title of Jeshu of Nazareth is ISSA, SON OF MARY, WORD OF GOD.)


 	Long before the rise of Christianity or Islam there were of

 course other great Teachers (Messengers) who preceived clearly the

 situation in which mankind finds itself.  One of these was Zarathustra

 (Zoroaster) in the old Iranian civilization of the Achaemenidae - about

 600 or 700 years B.C.  The great religious text left by Zarathustra is

 the AVESTA, which tells us much about the Demonic Forces, referred to

 under the blanket term of AHRIMAN, the Enemy of Light.  Mankind, in

 this teaching, is seen as a special creation of ORMAZD, the SUPREME

 SPIRIT, who is locked in permanent conflict with AHRIMAN.


	THE SOUL OF MAN IS THE OBJECT OF THE WAR, AND MAN HIMSELF IS

 THE BATTLEFIELD.



                  DR. RUDOLPH STEINER



	In our days, there has probably been no teacher who saw and

 understood all this more clearly that the great Austrian Dr. Rudolf

 Steiner (1861-1925), founder of the Anthroposophical Society.


	Clairvoyant from childhood, Steiner saw into the other worlds

 and planes and saw deeply into the human heart, and no books or teach-

 ings are so relevant as his are to the crisis of mankind that is now

 upon us.  His lectures throughout 1917, for example, show clearly that

 he foresaw, in their totality, the political, social, and military

 results and the police-state tyranny which would inevitably follow from

 the Russian Revolution, just as the "Lady" of the Apparitions at Fatima

 in the same year also did.  Steiner foresaw what would result in the

 world as a whole from a materialistic science run mad:  the development

 of "test-tube" man, "biological engineering" and other horrors; the

 deliberate creation and development of living monsters; and the soul-

 less, God-less, dehumanized, computerized, insect-like chromium and

 plastic slave world of "1984" that may now be at hand.


 	According to Steiner, a tremendous and crucial round in the

 battle was fought out in the last thirty years of the 19th century,

 and on the Inner Planes, between the Forces of AHRIMAN (the term he

 took over from Zarathustra) and the FORCES OF LIGHT.  These latter

 are conventionally known to our Western, Christian tradition as the

 Cohorts of Michael.  Steiner said that the fight ended in a complete

 victory for the LIGHT, but that, as a result of it, a great many of

 the powerful demonic beings had been actually cast down upon the

 planet Earth, with the consequence that their presence and their in-

 fluence now impinge more than ever upon the propects and the destiny

 of mankind.


 	STEINER TAUGHT THAT THE COMING YEARS WILL SEE INCREDIBLE

 UPHEAVALS, IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THIS GREAT BATTLE WILL BE CARRIED

 FORWARD, TO ITS CONCLUSION, INSIDE EVERY HUMAN HEART.  See Rudolf

 Steiner: DER STURZ DER GEISTER DER FINSTERNIS: (THE OVERTHROW OF THE

 SPIRITS OF DARKNESS), Series of Lectures, 1917. (Available only in

 German.)


	The objective of the Forces of Darkness is to take over the

 stream of human evolution, to merge with it, and to divert mankind

 from the evolutionary development planned for it.  The end result of

 this would be new creatures in which those qualities that represent

 the highest that we know would have been eliminated.


	Smart-alecky modern man of the Pop Age, the "Trousered Ape" as

 he has been called, has of course no use for all this sort of "rubbish",

 and immense numbers of our species have discarded all belief in the

 existence of demons, along with any belief in the Great Power that rules

 the Universe.


	(Sophisticated folk nowadays know that the world was not created

 by God, but by Karl Marx.  And they know that Lenin and successors are

 His Prophets.)


	There is a delightful passage in C.S. Lewis's SCREWTAPE LETTERS,

 where the Senior Devil, talking to one of his underlings, makes a

 profoundly important remark:  "OF COURSE, OUR GREATEST TRUMP-CARD IS

 THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY *KNOWS* WE DON'T EXIST." (Or words to that

 effect.)


	Similarly, the vast majority of mankind KNOW that JINNS and UFOs

 and UFO entities don't exist.  And what a nice advantage that is for

 the entities!


	But what if HOMO SAP (so-called, self-dubbed) were in for some

 big shocks in the near future?  What then?


	With the recent advance of Science, man has rapidly become aware

 of the vastness of the Cosmos and of the probability that there exist

 out there innumerable other physical worlds inhabited by intelligent

 beings, some of which, for all we know, may be (as we dearly hope)

 identical with men, with our tastes and our values, our hopes and our

 fears.


	It is natural that some among us, surveying the impasse into

 which we have got ourselves, might well be tempted to look up to the

 stars in the hope that someone wiser than we are might arrive one day

 from there and give us all the easy answers.


	If there be any truth in the ancient story that the inhabitants

 of Magonia, unlike men, do not possess the possibility of developing

 immortal souls, and therefore are anxious to acquire such by mating

 with us and mingling their life-stream with ours, what moment could be

 more propitious to them for achieving their purpose than now?


    	Can't you just hear the message of their Captain?


	-"WE ARE FROM TAU CETI, AND WE COME TO BRING YOU SALVATION
          AND SHOW YOU THE WAY OUT OF YOUR PROBLEMS.  WE WILL GET
          YOU OFF THE HOOK!"
