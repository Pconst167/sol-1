                              Graduation of Machines

       Vangard notes >>>

              (The following  is  from  the  Bloomfield Moore book on Keely
               entitled "Keely  and His Discoveries".   The  instrument  to
               which it refers is believed to be his Compound Disintegrator
               but the differentiation or graduation of ALL his devices was
               very much necessary to allow the most efficient  transfer of
               the weak acoustic energies generated.

               The principle  of  graduation  involves the "tempering" of a
               mass to remove the knots in  the  structure.  This in effect
               produces a  type  of  energy  conduction   much   like  that
               encountered in a room temperature superconductor.

               When the  mass has been differentiated or graduated AND its'
               neutral centre is sympathetically excited, we evince a range
               of effects  including dissociation,  levitation,  compaction
               and/or materialization.)                                 <<<

       Mr. Keely gives  a few introductory words concerning  the  necessary
       graduating of his instruments, for effecting conditions necessary to
       ensure perfect sympathetic  transmission,  which  will serve to show
       how great are the difficulties that have been attendant upon getting
       his machines into   a  condition   to   control   and   equate   the
       differentiation in molecular masses, requiring greater skill than in
       researching the force of a sunbeam.

       He writes:

            "The differentiation in molecular metallic masses, or grouping,
             is brought about in their manipulations in manufacturing  them
             for commercial  uses;  in  the forging of a piece of metal, in
             the drawing of a length of  wire,  and  in  the  casting  of a
             molten mass to any requisite form.

             The nearest  approach  to  molecular  uniformity  in  metallic
             masses is  in  the  wire  drawn  for commercial uses, gold and
             platina being the nearest to freedom from differentiation.

             But even these wires, when  tested  by  a CERTAIN CONDITION OF
             THE FIRST  ORDER  OF  INTENSIFIED  MOLECULAR VIBRATION  for  a
             TRANSFERRING MEDIUM  BETWEEN  CENTRES OF NEUTRALITY, I find to
             be entirely inadequate for the transfer of concordant unition,
             as between  one  and  the   other,   ON   ACCOUNT   OF   NODAL
             INTERFERENCES.

             We can appreciate the difficulty of converting  such  a medium
             to a  uniform  molecular  link,  by  knowing  that  it  can be
             accomplished only after REMOVING ALL NODAL INTERFERENCE, by

                                      Page 1





             INDUCING BETWEEN  THE  NODAL  WAVES  a condition in which they
             BECOME SUBSERVIENT   to   the    inter-sympathetic   vibratory
             molecular link of such structure or wire.

             Therefore, it is necessary to submit the wire  to  a system of
             graduation in  order to find what the COMBINED CHORDS OF THESE
             NODAL INTERFERENCES REPRESENT  WHEN  FOCALIZED  TO ONE GENERAL
             CENTRE.

             Then the  differentiation between these nodal  waves  and  the
             inter-molecular link MUST BE EQUATED, by what I call a process
             of VIBRATORY  INDUCTION,  so  as  to  INDUCE  PURE CONCORDANCE
             BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER.

             To elaborate  on  this system  of  graduation,  for  effecting
             conditions necessary  to  ensure  perfect  and   unadulterated
             transmission, would  make  up  a  book that would take days to
             read and months to study.

             The graduating of a perfectly  constructed  instrument,  to  a
             condition to transmit sympathetically, is no standard whatever
             for any other one that may be built, nor ever will be, because
             NO CONCORDANT CONDITIONS OF COMPOUND MOLECULAR AGGREGATION CAN
             EVER EXIST IN VISIBLE GROUPINGS.

             If it  were  even  possible  to  make  their  parts  perfectly
             accurate one   to   the   other,   in  regard  to  atmospheric
             displacement and  weight,  their  resonating  qualities  would
             still have  a  high  rate  of sympathetic variation  in  their
             molecular groupings alone.

             If one  thousand  million  of  coins,  each one representing a
             certain standard value, and  struck  from  the  same die, were
             sympathetically graduated  under  a vibratory  subdivision  of
             150,000, the  most  amazing variation would present itself, as
             between each individual coin  throughout the number, in regard
             to their molecular grouping and resonance......

       It will be  realized  in  the future what immense difficulties  have
       been encountered by   Mr.   Keely   in   perfecting  his  system  of
       graduation, and in  constructing   devices   for   the  guidance  of
       artificers and mechanicians, whereby those who are not as abnormally
       endowed as he  is for his work, can bring a proper vibratory  action
       into play to  induce positive sympathetic transmission; as will also
       be realized the stupidity of the men  who  still seek to confine his
       researches to perfecting  the  so-called  Keely  Motor,  before  his
       system is sufficiently  developed  to enable others to follow it up,
       should his physical strength give out.

       His system of graduating research,  when  completed, will enable men
       to take up  the work, not from the standard of an already  completed
       structure that is  true in its operation, though a perfect duplicate
       as to size and gravity be made, for  each  successively  constructed
       machine requires a knowledge of its own conditions  of  sensity,  as
       regards its mass chords.

       Keely writes:

            "That tuning forks can be so constructed as to show coincident

                                      Page 2





             or concordant  association with each other, is but a very weak
             illustration of  the  fact   which   governs   pure   acoustic
             assimilation.

             The best  only approach a condition of about  a  fortieth,  as
             regards pure attractive and propulsive receptiveness.

             By DIFFERENTIATING  THEM  TO  CONCORDANT THIRDS, THEY INDUCE A
             CONDITION OF  MOLECULAR  BOMBARDMENT  BETWEEN  THEMSELVES,  BY
             ALTERNATE CHANGES OF LONG AND SHORT WAVES OF SYMPATHY.

             Bells rung in vacuo liberate the same number of corpuscles, at
             the same velocity as those surrounded by a normal  atmosphere;
             and hence the same acoustic force attending them, but they are
             INAUDIBLE from  the  fact that, in vacuo, the MOLECULAR VOLUME
             IS REDUCED.

             Every gaseous  molecule is  a  resonator  OF  ITSELF,  and  is
             SENSITIVE to ANY and ALL sounds induced, whether  ACCORDANT OR
             DISCORDANT.
