  >>  The  following  document  has apparently been making the rounds since 
last  fall. Supposedly it has been mailed to over 6000 researchers, however 
that  is  highly  dubious,  as I don't believe there are actually that many 
UFO  researchers  in  the  world; certainly, no mailing list that large ex-
ists.  Very  few  people I know have received one, and I got mine from John 
Lear.  There  is  no  confirmation  that  the  President  or any members of 
Congress  have received a copy, either. MUFON was unaware of the letter un-
til  Walt  Andrus got a copy, and is more than a little miffed that replies 
were  referred  to  the  MUFON  Journal  by the letter's author(s). So far, 
there  has  been  no identification of the author(s); no one has ever heard 
of  Justice  for  Military  Personnel  (JMP),  and  no members have stepped 
forward  to  claim  credit.  It is, however, an intensely interesting docu-
ment, for reasons we will discuss in a later upload.

President of the United States
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, DC  20500

                                                        4 Sep. 1987
Dear Mr. President:

      The  CIA  has made a mockery out of our constitution. Our elected re-
presentatives  have no idea what we in the Military have done and are still 
doing,  since  the CIA decided that "they do not have a need to know," mak-
ing  it mandatory for all of us in the Military and Government, both active 
and  retired,  who have knowledge regarding UFOs, to testify with total im-
munity  before  a  special congressional committee. The CIA can not object, 
because officially "UFOs do not exist."
      The  UFO cover-up is not in our national security interest. It should 
be  stopped, because it hurts military morale. Our group, Justice for Mili-
tary  Personnel  (JMP), consists of retired military personnel who were af-
fected  by,  or involved in different capacities with the UFO cover-up. Un-
der  orders  of  the  CIA,  in the "interest of national security," we took 
part  in  intentionally  misleading the nation, manipulating the press, the 
courts and most politicians.

INTRODUCTION:
      The  CIA UFO cover-up, is being perpetrated against the American peo-
ple  and  not our potential enemies. The Russians have a whole town exclus-
ively  for UFO research. The CIA insists that the UFO cover-up must be kept 
at  all costs, otherwise the military will be ineffective. The CIA correct-
ly  maintains,  that military personnel will disobey orders when confronted 
by  UFOs. For example, during the Vietnam War, pilots refused orders to fly 
night  missions against UFOs. Since fatal accidents, UFO related, are rela-
tively  rare  (with  the  exception of the Vietnam War), the CIA prefers to 
maintain the cover-up.
      NSA,  NASA,  CIA,  RAND  and  AFOSI associates, have informed us that 
UFOs  have  many origins. Some obviously represent civilizations, thousands 
of  years  more  advanced  than we are. Almost everything about them, their 
motives  and  operations  are  strange and incomprehensible to us. There is 
little  we  can do to protect ourselves from them. The Air Force is totally 
helpless  to  handle the situation, because of UFO's incredible flight per-
formance.  The CIA and Pentagon are bewildered by UFOs' apparent ability to 
jam  all  our  ground and air electronic equipment, or instantaneously dis-
able  all our weapons control systems. The CIA has decided to try to under-
stand  and  duplicate  UFO  propulsion systems at all cost. This means that 
pilot  lives  have  been  sacrificed in UFO chases to get "UFO samples" for 
research, therefore `Ignorance is Bliss.'
      RAND  maintains  that  the  CIA is gambling that a major catastrophe, 
such  as  the  July,  1952, mass UFO appearance over Washington, DC and the 
White  House, will not happen again, so that no "explanations will be need-
ed.  NORAD, along with many of us in the armed forces, bitterly oppose per-
petuation  of  this cover-up, pointing to the public panic potential of the 
1952  disaster.  We  in  the JMP feel that too many military personnel suf-
fered  or  died as a result of not being informed about UFOs. It is time to 
tell  our  armed  forces the truth. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE to continue to use 
military personnel as guinea pigs.

CRIMES WE COMMITTED UNDER CIA PRESSURE:
      Forty  years ago, the cover-up was confined to a very few individuals 
within  the  Military and Government. Today, many thousands are effected or 
involved.  This  deceitful  CIA  policy is breeding resentment in the serv-
ices,  for  we  were  ordered to act illegally, against our fellow military 
personnel  and  our  nation.  Our JMP group has many military personnel and 
others  who  are  waiting  to  testify. The following are a few examples of 
deceptive activities we carried out while on active duty:
      1:  We  intentionally  ordered pilots to shoot at UFOs, with the hope 
of  acquiring  a  UFO  for  research  purposes. These resulted sometimes in 
instant  explosions  and  death  to the pilots or instantaneous "disappear-
ances"  of pilot and plane. The UFOs occupants seem to be monitoring all of 
our  pilots'  actions.  We analyzed hundreds of UFO gun camera films and it 
seems that some UFOs are remote controlled.
      2.  We  have  strictly silenced military pilots who reported UFOs. We 
do not allow our pilots to discuss UFO chases EVEN AMONG THEMSELVES.
      3.  We  interrogated, intimidated and harassed military personnel who 
saw  UFOs,  to "convince" them (excluding pilots and astronauts), that they 
"did  not  see"  what  they  saw; frightened them with the prospect of long 
prison  sentences if they told anyone what they saw; transferred them alone 
to  bases  around the world, where, even if they were to talk, nobody would 
believe  them;  forced  some of them into mental institutions; jailed them; 
destroyed  their  military  careers;  did everything possible to intimidate 
UFO witnesses by fear into self doubt and silence.
      4.  We  distributed fraudulent information, through Military and Gov-
ernment spokesmen or scientists, to debunk all public UFO sightings.
      5.  We forced the FAA, NASA, and other Government agencies to conform 
to CIA UFO policies.
      6. We violated the Freedom of Information Act by hiding documents.
      7.  We  smeared  commercial  pilots  who  publicly  reported UFOs and 
forced their companies to silence them.
      8.  We  did  not  confirm  when civilian planes around the world also 
temporarily lost control or completely disappeared when UFOs were present.
      We  slandered  ruthlessly  some of our most outstanding and competent 
citizens,  who  dared to report UFO sightings, while we knew all along that 
they were telling the truth, as we tracked the UFOs on radar.
      10.  We  silenced  Congressmen and Senators who requested UFO inform-
ation  for  their  constituents. These representatives are now silent part-
ners  to  this  cover-up  and are consequently directly responsible for all 
the crimes we committed.

PRESS IN DEFAULT:
      The  national UFO debunking campaign ordered by the CIA in 1953, pub-
lished  books  and  planted hundreds of articles in the press, to create an 
atmosphere  of  ridicule  around the subject of UFOs, falsely creating "UFO 
contacts"  and  "UFO" hoaxes. This campaign which is still in effect today, 
infiltrated  major civilian civilian UFO groups, to ridicule them or divert 
their efforts towards "other explanations." This UFO cover-up has been suc-
cessful  beyond  CIA's highest expectations, due primarily to the brilliant 
manipulation  of the press by the CIA via the ridicule strategy. The Estab-
lishment  Press,  afraid  of  being ridiculed, proved to be gullible beyond 
belief to "official statements." 
      The  press,  for  example, in attempting to divorce itself completely 
from  UFO  data,  did not question why the CIA refused to give UFO informa-
tion  to  the  then Senator Barry Goldwater who at the time was chairman of 
the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee.  IF  SENATOR  GOLDWATER (WHO HAS BEEN 
AWARE  OF  THE  COVER-UP) DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH SECURITY CLEARANCE TO 
GET  UFO  INFORMATION, THEN WHO IN OUR GOVERNMENT DOES? The press failed to 
ask,  if  UFOs  "do not exist," why did the CIA tell Senator Goldwater that 
UFO  data  is  classified "above top secret" and "above any other secret in 
the  USA"?  The  CIA  debunking  campaign, using some of the best brains in 
this  country,  slowly  "educated"  most  journalists that they can only be 
rewarded,  by  abandoning any sense of journalistic ethics when it comes to 
reporting about UFOs.
      One  of the most audaciously deceptive acts by the CIA involved Pres-
ident  Carter  (who  himself  had sighted a UFO), when he requested NASA to 
look  into  the  possibility  of UFO research. Until that moment, all of us 
who  were  involved  with  the  UFO cover-up assumed that the President was 
informed  by  the  CIA  about UFOs the moment he entered office and that he 
was  aware  of  the  huge sum of money invested in UFO research since 1953. 
Until  that  moment,  IT  WAS INCONCEIVABLE to us that the President of the 
United States would be kept totally uninformed by the CIA.
      At  that time, NASA's scientific team concluded that the UFO cover-up 
should  end  because  the public already knew that most astronauts in space 
photographed  UFOs,  or  had been followed by UFOs, and that the astronauts 
were  forced  by regulations to lie to the press. Shortly before NASA's re-
lease  of the news to the press, the CIA insisted on continuing to maintain 
the  cover-up  and pressured NASA to lied to the public. NASA therefore re-
leased  a  statement dictated by the CIA, contradictory to their own scien-
tists'  conclusions.  Victor  Marchetti  (former Executive Assistant to the 
Deputy  Director  of the CIA), openly maintains that President Carter prob-
ably was forced to participate in the CIA's UFO cover-up.
      Most  of  the  preposterous "explanations" of UFOs were originated by 
the  CIA's  debunking  headquarters,  and disseminated to the public mostly 
through  the  Air  Force, FAA, FBI, CIA, NASA, NORAD or Pentagon spokesmen. 
These  shocking,  mind  boggling  "explanations"  (swamp gas, stars, etc.), 
released  usually  after  long delays, often constituted an insult to Amer-
ican  public intelligence, instead of an explanation. Though these "explan-
ations"  often  were  not logical, scientific, or factual at all, they were 
eagerly  accepted  by  the  press, which was relieved to quickly dispose of 
"another  UFO  story."  There were often sharp contradictions between these 
"explanations"  and  the  pilots  and  radar controllers' statements, which 
rarely seemed to bother the press, who claim to be Government watch dogs.
      
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN DEFAULT:
      Project  `Blue  Book',  the  `Condon Report', and many notable scien-
tists,  are part of the CIA's cover-up. The `Condon Report' is a scientific 
farce  which was immediately exposed as a fraud by the late Professor James 
E.  MacDonald  (world's  foremost, non CIA, authority on UFOs). The `Condon 
Report'  has  been  heavily  criticized  ever  since by all other competent 
scientists  (who do not work for the CIA), who actually examined the report 
in  depth.  Incredible  as it seems, many in the scientific community today 
have  not,  and still regard the `Condon Report' as an impartial scientific 
study.  This  attitude  is a source of much amusement and self satisfaction 
in  the  intelligence community. This manipulation of American public opin-
ion  and the advanced mind control techniques employed by the CIA, were de-
scribed  by  one Air Force doctor as: "Psychiatric Fascism contradictory to 
any democratic principles."
      Now  more  than  ever, due to our highly sophisticated detection sys-
tems,  UFOs  are being detected frequently over our bases and missile silos 
and  they  have  tampered  with our nuclear missiles. They are being photo-
graphed  in restricted areas, monitoring our military experiments. We track 
them  visually  and/or  on  radar  across  the USA and Canada almost daily. 
World-wide  intelligence  reports  indicate very similar sightings. Many of 
us  objected  long  ago to this senseless UFO cover-up. But we could not do 
anything,  because  the CIA controls all our military intelligence agencies 
and has overwhelming influence over many Government agencies.

CONCLUSIONS:
      FBI  associates  defined  the  UFO cover-up as the biggest crime ever 
perpetrated  against our people. The CIA, in the name of "National Security 
Interest,"  has  flagrantly  violated the letter and spirit of the law. The 
Uniform  Code  of  Military Justice DOES NOT offer our soldiers any protec-
tion  regarding  this cover-up. As JMP members, we are torn between our de-
sire  to  maintain  the military oath of secrecy and our sense of ethics as 
responsible  loyal  citizens  of  this great nation. Yet we are fully dedi-
cated  to  preventing the UFO cover-up from continuing to be the status quo 
in  this  free nation. When our country requests us in the military to give 
up  our  lives  for  this land, the least the Government can do, is tell us 
against whom we are fighting and why. We have the right to know.

JMP CIVIL RESPONSIBILITY:
      Lack  of competent news reporting on this issue, has led to the crea-
tion  of JMP. We feel it is our responsibility to speak up for our citizens 
who  are  still  on active military duty. A RAND study indicates that, bar-
ring  unforeseen  circumstances, the CIA may continue the cover-up unabated 
under the umbrella of secrecy and ridicule. JMP members therefore have pre-
pared  a  program  that  may effectively disintegrate the UFO cover-up. NSA 
associate  commented to us: "...once the nation will learn the magnitude of 
the  UFO  cover-up,  it  may lead to a sense of awakening and outrage which 
could  lead  to civil disobedience acts that will make the Boston Tea Party 
pale by comparison, and may lead to the downfall of the CIA."
      The  CIA's collapse is not our intention because the CIA is important 
for  national  defense.  There is a need to preserve whatever integrity the 
CIA  may still have in the American public's eyes. The issue of this letter 
is  not  CIA  credibility,  but  our  Government's credibility. This insane 
CIA's  UFO  cover-up must end. It is a `Time-Bomb' which can't be disarmed. 
This  `Time-Bomb'  according  to RAND, is gaining momentum and must explode 
one  day, LET US EXPOSE IT NOW AND HELP SAVE ADDITIONAL UNNECESSARY LOSS OF 
MILITARY LIVES.
      This  letter  intentionally  omits the most spectacular events in the 
UFO  cover-up.  Members  of  JMP fell that it will be more appropriate that 
the  President  himself,  once  informed  by  the  CIA, will disclose these 
events  to  the nation. We regret the anonymity of this letter, but we have 
no  other  choice because the CIA has a clear policy of eliminating any in-
siders  who  may expose the UFO cover-up. As soon as the Executive Order is 
issued,  we  will  be the first to testify. Please reply via the `MUFON UFO 
Journal.'
      Mr.  President,  you have a unique opportunity in the history of man-
kind.  With  the  interest of national security and unity in our hearts, we 
respectfully wait for your actions.

                                           J.M.P.
                                           San Antonio, TX
