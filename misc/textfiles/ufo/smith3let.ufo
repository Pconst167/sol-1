 Dear Bruce:

 You have used a copy of the photograph of a girl showing an
 anomalous image in a videotape that you are distributing among
 the proponents of the Gulf Breeze affair and that have been
 sold to other interested parties.

 Please be advised that said photograph and its derivatives have
 been copyrighted by the UNICAT Project, and that its use without
 previous authorization is in violation of the copyright law.
 Following the advise (sic) of my attorney, I am writing to you
 to request the complete list of the recipients of your video
 production.

 The photo is identified by the mark "Photo 22" and my records
 show that it was send (sic) confidence to Mr. Richard Hall in
 January, 1989.  In order to determine if a breach of trust has
 occurred, I would like to have you version of how you obtained
 those photos.

 The videotape that you have produced is not a scientific analysis
 of the photos based on the facts, but a propaganda attempt to
 discredit what you correctly perceive as a serious threat to the
 validity of the Gulf Breeze alledged UFOs.  I understand your
 motivations, but I can't condone your systematic distortion of
 the truth.



 c.c.  Richard Hall
