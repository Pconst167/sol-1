
The Following is an interview with Barbra Becker conducted on Nov. 18, 1989


Geest: I welcome Barb Becker, one of the Founders and Directors of the UFO
Research Network...My first question: Barb: Why did you start your
organization?

Becker:  We saw a need for a real investigative organization here in Missouri
and the St. Louis area in particular.

Geest: Do you think that there is a lack of "true" investigative work being
done in the field of UFOlogy?

Becker:  Yes.  I think the organizations have sold out.  I think that they are
not doing the field work that needs to be done and are concentrating on
sensational cases.  Instead of collecting data, they seem more intent on
"getting the BIG one" and writing a book.

Geest: Understand. How will UFORN differ from say MUFON or UFOSLG?

Becker:  Well for one thing we aren't afraid to leave the area.  We want to
be able to mobilize at any time from anywhere, thus a concentration on getting
people all over Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, etc. involved.  We are trying to
build a REAL network of interested people.

Geest: Does your group plan to publish anykind of newsletter?

Becker:  Eventually, but as it stands right now that is a future activity.

Geest:  To change the subject for a moment, Recently Whitley Strieber's
movie Communion was realesed to local theaters. What are your comments on
the entire Strieber "Phenomenon?"

Becker:  As an investigator I look at Strieber as a thorn in my side.  It was
hard enough before Strieber to sort out abduction cases now it's impossible.
I think people should be aware but he has sensationalized it too much.  I
haven't seen the movie yet...actually I may not see it, I haven't decided yet.

Geest: I also agree. Within the last 2 or 3 years the entire MJ-12 matter
keeps comming up over and over again. We have the Lear files, Cooper, Moore,
O.H. Krill and a host of others stating that the US government is behind a
giantic coverup of UFO's..Do you have any comments on the MJ-12 material?

Becker:  I think it is highly probable that the U.S. Government is involved
in a mega cover-up regarding UFOs.  I think that the Roswell information, the
slipped up press releases, the witnesses etc. attest to a cover-up.  MJ-12?
I think that Moore was getting very close to something in his work on the
Roswell incident and "they" threw him the MJ-12 stuff as a diversion. 
If as he says he was playing both ends against the middle, then it seems
likely that the info in MJ-12 was verbally fed to him.  He then transcribed it
photographed it, and delivered it to Shandera.  He was looking for the "BIG
ONE" too.  Maybe he got a little too big!

Geest: Interesting. At the recent "MUFON Show Me Conferance" here in the St.
Louis area, wasn't Moore suppose to be one of the speakers...

Becker:  As far as I know he was.  He was billed as a "Mystery Guest", but he
didn't show up.  We had a problem with him in 1985 at the MUFON Symposium held
here.  As I recall we weren't sure if he would show then.  The mystery to me
is why he keeps getting invited to speak.

Geest: Moore does seem to be somewhat "elusive" after the UFO Coverup program.
Next question. Recently in the news, The Soviet press reported a landing.
Since this was carried by one of "the offical" USSR newspapers do you think
that this means that the USSR government has acknowledged the existance of
UFO's or this is just a result of the Soviet easing restrictions on their
publications...Some Western journalists have hinted that since the reforms
Gorbachev has institued along with that comes the "Tabloids"...in other
words..What do you think about the Russian report?

Becker: Well, it seems incredible but the Russians have always been more
open to the paranormal than the US government.  They have been conducting
parapsychological research on an ongoing basis for years.  That they should
be less inhibited regarding the recent report does not surprise me. 
Unfortunately, I think they have been made a laughing stock by the world
political community.  One thing I find particularily interesting is the
lack of interest within the UFOlogical community regarding the emblem drawn
by the young witness on the side of the craft.  Anyone familiar with UFOlogy
should have picked up that the emblem seems to be identical to the emblem
reported in the UMMO PAPERS by, I believe, Antonio Ribera.  For years it
has been belived that this was a hoax, at best the figment of Ribera's mind
but how do we account for the same symbol appearing on the ship reported
seen by the Russian boy???  

Geest: For those readers who are not familiar can you describe the emblem?

Becker:  Maybe I can draw it.   ]+[   That's basaically it. 

Geest: With the recent changes within the Eastern Block of nations, do you 
anticapate more information on UFO's from a source which was previsouly very 
closed mouthed....?

Becker:  No.  I think they will succumb to US government pressure to keep it
quiet.

Geest: If I understand you, you think that the US government will put pressure 
on either the Soviet Union, or various Eastern countries to supress 
information...is that correct?

Becker:  Yes.

Geest: interesting...Next question, back to UFORN. Does your group plan any 
specific events such as sky watching, or trips to various portions of the US
such as the 4-corners area to follow up on research that has shown these areas 
for what ever reason seem to have a lot of UFO activity?

Becker:  We will definately have skywatches...they are a nice unifying 
experience.  As for doing anything out of state we will have to see how things 
go.

Geest: Barb: Have you yourself ever seen a UFO?

Becker:  Yes.  More than once.  I basically got involved through investigating 
the cattle mutilations in Elsberry, Missouri in 1978.  At that time I saw what 
I would consider to be a "typical" UFO..."flying saucer".

Geest: I recall the Elsberry case. If I recall correctly, didn't the local 
authorites pass it off as a "Satinic Cult" of some type. And Secondly, what 
did your investigation turn up?

Becker:  The investigation turned up 8 to 10 mutilations within a half mile 
radius from April to August.  I personally saw, as I said before, what I 
consider to be a UFO within that half mile.  I watched as others skirted 
treetops, appeared to descend and then rise.  I have no idea what they were 
doing or why I was allowed to watch.

Geest: Recently Dave Rapp a MUFON investigator conducted an investigation on 
cattle Mutations in Missouri, he reported that the incissions were very 
precise, I do not wish to dwell on this subject but for the sack of information 
in your investigation did you find simular markings?

Becker:  I was never lucky enough to get in immediately following a 
mutilation they were always decomposed.  So you ask, how do I know they were
mutilations?  Well, I don't.  What I have to go on is the testimony of the
people of Elsberry, the farmers who have been on the land for generations, 
when they tell me that the cattle deaths were "unnatural" I believe them...
who better to know?  Also, Nocturnal Lights were seen in all the areas of the 
mutilations and one Daylight Disc as well...that places the UFOs in the 
vicinity of the mutilations for the specified time period.  Circumstantial,
but sometimes that is all have.  I also took slides of the NLs.

Geest: Next question, this again relates to UFORN. Do you percieve your group 
as a grass roots organization or an organization which will try to unite the 
various groups within the UFO community? 

Becker:  I can walk on water...but I can't do that.  It would be nice if the 
various groups could forget their differences and begin to work together but I 
don't see us as dedicating any time to the effort.  I have been corresponding 
with Fran Ridge, MUFON State Director for Indiana, and we are exchanging 
information.  This is what I hope to get from the BBS...all the sighting
reports Ridge collects from all over the country.  If UFORN is affiliated
with any group it would be CUFOS.

Geest: Barb: How can one get in contact with your group?

Becker: Well, they can of course E-Mail us here or they can write:
