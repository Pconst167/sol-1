                              THE SHOCKING TRUTH

                        Ronald Reagan's Obsession With
                              An Alien Invasion

                                 By A. Hovni

        Supermarket tabloids, that strange breed of sensationalistic
   American journalism, have been talking for most of the decade about
   Ronald Reagan's fascination with things like astrology and space aliens.
   Little attention was paid to the matter ... after all, the stuff was
   printed in the tabloids and nobody sane is supposed to believe in them.
   Yet truth is becoming stranger than fiction in the case of Ronald Wilson
   Reagan and some of his more curious remarks.

        For starters, he has become the first President of the United
   States to talk about he possibility of an alien invasion from outer
   space, and he has done so not once or twice but in three speeches.
   Reagan is also the only President to my knowledge, who admitted -- in a
   1984 Presidential debate against Walter Mondale -- [to] having
   "philosophical discussions" about Armageddon in the White House with
   some rather well known fundamentalist preachers.

        And then there was the explosion about astrology in the White
   House, triggered by Don Regan's disclosures that Nancy had often
   consulted astrologers to arrange for appointments with the President.
   Everyone knows the details by now, yet we asked Marcello Galluppi, a
   well-known astrologer and host of a psychic radio and TV talk show in
   Detroit, to give us another view.  "It is very clear to me that the
   politicians in Washington have their psychics and astrologers," said
   Marcello, "at least some of them do."  Furthermore, continued Marcello,
   there is evidence that the Reagans have used astrology for a long time
   if we consider that "he was sworn in at midnight as Governor of
   California, based on astrology."

        The media was having a field day with horoscopes at the White House
   when Reagan talked about the possibility of Earth uniting against a
   threat by "a power from outer space."  Although the idea wasn't new for
   the President, as we shall soon see, this time everybody paid attention.
   More as a joke than a serious thought, however.  The AP story on the
   speech, for example, had the headline, "Reagan follows astrological flap
   with comment on space invaders."

        There might be a deeper reason for Reagan's apparent interest in
   the idea of an alien threat.  There is an unconfirmed story that before
   he became Governor of California, Ron and Nancy had a UFO sighting on a
   highway near Hollywood.  The story was broadcast last February on Steve
   Allen's radio show over WNEW-AM in New York.  The comedian and host
   commented that a very well known personality in the entertainment
   industry had confided to him that many years ago, Ron and Nancy were
   expected to a casual dinner with friends in Hollywood.  Except for the
   Reagans, all the guests had arrived.  Ron and Nancy showed up quite
   upset half an hour later, saying that they had just seen a UFO coming
   down the coast.  No further details were released by Steve Allen.

        The President first disclosed his recurrent thoughts about "an
   alien threat" during a December 4, 1985, speech at the Fallston High
   School in Maryland, where he spoke about his first summit with General
   Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva.  According to a White House transcript,
   Reagan remarked that during his 5-hour private discussions with
   Gorbachev, he told [Gorbachev] to think, "how easy his task and mine
   might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat
   to this world from some other species from another planet outside in the
   universe.  We'd forget all the little local differences that we have
   between our countries ..."

        Except for one headline or two, people didn't pay much attention.
   Not then and not later, when Gorbachev himself confirmed the
   conversation in Geneva during an important speech on February 17, 1987,
   in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow, to the Central Committee of the
   USSR's Communist Party.  Not a High School in Maryland, precisely!
   There, buried on page 7A of the 'Soviet Life Supplement,' was the
   following statement:

       "At our meeting in Geneva, the U.S. President said that if
        the earth faced an invasion by extraterrestials, the United
        States and the Soviet Union would join forces to repel such
        an invasion.  I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though I
        think it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion..."

   Notice that Gorbachev doesn't say this is an incredible proposition, he
   just says that it's too early to worry about it.

        If Gorbachev elevated the theme from a high school to the Kremlin
   [palace], Reagan upped the stakes again by including the "alien threat"
   [again], not in a domestic speech but to a full session of the General
   Assembly of the United Nations.  Towards the end of his speech to the
   Forty-second Session on September 21, 1987, the President said that, "in
   our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much
   unites all the members of humanity.  Perhaps we need some outside,
   universal threat to make us recognize this common bond.

        "I occasionally think," continued Reagan, "how quickly our
   differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat
   from outside this world.  And yet, I ask" -- here comes the clincher --
   "is not an alien force ALREADY among us?"  The President now tries to
   retreat from the last bold statement by posing a second question:  "What
   could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war
   and the threat of war?"  Unlike the off-the-cuff remarks to the Fallston
   High School, we must assume that the President's speech to the General
   Assembly was written very carefully and likewise, it merits close
   examination.

        Ronald Reagan has told us that he thinks often about this issue,
   yet nobody seems to be paying attention.  When the President mentioned
   last May 4 in Chicago for the third time the possibility of a threat by
   "a power from another planet," the media quickly dubbed it the "space
   invaders" speech, relegating it to a sidebar in the astrology flap.  The
   ET remark was made in the Q&A period following a speech to the National
   Strategy Forum in Chicago's Palmer House Hotel, where he adopted a more
   conciliatory tone towards the Soviet Union.

        Significantly, Reagan's remark was made during his response to the
   question, "What do you consider to be the most important need in
   international relations?"

        "I've often wondered," the President told us once again, "what if
   all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by an outer --
   a power from outer space, from another planet."  And then he emphasized
   his theme that this would erase all the differences, and that the
   "citizens of the world" would "come together to fight that particular
   threat..."

        There is a fourth, unofficial, similar statement from Ronald Reagan
   about this particular subject.  It was reported in the New Republic by
   senior editor Fred Barnes.  The article described a luncheon in the
   White House between the President and Eduard Shevardnatze, during the
   Foreign Minister's visit to Washington to sign the INF Treaty on
   September 15, 1987.  "Near the end of his lunch with Shevardnadze,"
   wrote Barnes, "Reagan wondered aloud what would happen if the world
   faced an 'alien threat' from outer space.  'Don't you think the United
   States and the Soviet Union would be together?' he asked.  Shevardnadze
   said yes, absolutely.  "And we wouldn't need our defense ministers to
   meet,' he added."

        The fact that there are so many references in important speeches,
   off-the-cuff remarks, and just plain conversations, means that -- for
   whatever reason or knowledge about deep UFO secrets that he may have as
   President -- Ronald Reagan does think often about the possibility of an
   alien invasion, and how this event could become a catalyst for world
   unity.  Talking about these UFO secrets, there is also an unconfirmed
   story of a special story of a special screening in the White House of
   the movie "ET" at few years ago, with director Steven Spielberg and a
   few selected guests.  Right after the movie, Reagan supposedly turned to
   Spielberg and whispered something to the effect, "There are only a
   handful of people who know the truth about this."

        Indeed, more than one ufologist has even suggested that the real
   target behind "Star Wars" -- another of Reagan's cosmic obsessions -- is
   the projected ET invasion and not the Russians.  Others talk of wild
   "deals" between the U.S. Government and race of gray dwarfs, better
   known for the appetite for abducting humans ... Stop!  We're entering
   the forbidden terrain of tabloid revelations, like the SUN's screaming
   headline that "Reagan will end his presidency by adding several planets
   as states."  Just think about it.
