GENE WARS? 
 
According to Josephus, "Many fallen angels of God now 
consorted with women, and begot sons on them who were 
overbearing and disdainful of every virtue; much confidence 
had they in their strength.  In fact, the deeds that our 
tradition ascribes to them recall the audacious exploits 
told by the Greeks of the giants.  But Noah...urged them to 
adopt a better frame of mind and amend their ways."  In the 
eighth century A.D., Rabbi Eliezer records in the midrash: 
"The angels who fell from Heaven saw the daughters of Cain 
perambulating and displaying their secret parts, their eyes 
painted with antimony in the manner of harlots; and, being 
seduced, took wives from among them." 
 
The names of several fallen angels survive only in careless 
Greek transcriptions of Hebrew or Aramaic originals, which 
make their meaning doubtful.  But 'Azael' does seem to 
represent 'Asazel' ('God strengthens').  'Dudael' is 
sometimes translated 'God's cauldron.'  The Nephilim 
('Fallen Ones') bore many other tribal names, such as Emim 
('Terrors'), Rephaim ('Weakeners'), Gibborim ('Giant 
Heroes'), Zamzummin ('Achievers'), Anakim ('Long-necked' or 
'Wearers of Necklaces'), Awwim ('Devastators' or 
'Serpents').  One of the Nefilim named Arba is said to have 
built the city of Hebron, called 'Kiriath-Arba' after him, 
and become the father of Anak whose three sons, Sheshai, 
Ahiman and Talmai, were later expelled by Joshua's comrade 
Caleb.  These "Fallen Ones" were canabalistic giants and had 
sexual relationships with, first, human women but later went 
on to indiscriminate sexuality with virgins, matrons, men, 
and beasts. 
 
It was because of the evil brought upon the earth by these 
"Fallen Ones" that decided God to wipe from the face of the 
earth all men and women, with their gigantic corruptors by 
the Great Flood. Noah and his family were instructed to 
build an ark to avoid destruction in the Flood.  The wife of 
Ham (one of Noah's sons) had, however, been impregnated by a 
fallen angel named "Shemhazai" before getting on the ark 
(according to Hebrew legend).  The descendants of Ham were 
the Canaanites (Ge. 9:18,22,25,27; 10:6,15-18) whom God 
instructed the Jews to kill when the Jews finally came to 
their Holy Land promised by God.  We can therefore, in the 
fallen angel-human hybrid of the wife of Ham discern their 
general characteristics.  Named Canaan, the progenitor if 
the Canaanites, we see the following about a demon-human 
hybrid: 
 
Canaan was cursed by Noah to be the servant of servants of 
his bretheren and Canaan was the servant of Japeth.  Canaan 
was not an only child; his brothers were named Cush, Phut, 
and Mizraim (although these three brothers were not sired by 
the "fallen one" called Shemhazai.  The children of Canaan 
were Sidon (Canaan's first born) and Heth.  From there 
further descendents of the demon-human hybrid Canaan were 
the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgasites, Hivite, Arkite, Sinite, 
Arvadite, Zemarite, Hamathite and from there the families of 
the Canaanites were spread abroad.  The border of the 
Canaanite land was from Sidon to Gaza and down to cities of 
the south called Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and even 
down to Lasha -- the area of what is now, in this present 
day, known as Israel. 
 
In the Exodus from Egypt, Moses was instructed by God to go 
to the land of the Canaanites -- this was the "promised 
land."  God told Moses that He would send an angel before 
Moses; and that He would drive out the Canaanites, the 
Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the 
Jebusites from the "land flowing with milk and honey."  God 
instructed Moses to be on guard in that land so as not to 
make any covenants with the inhabitants of Canaan "lest it 
be for a snare in the midst of thee: but ye shall destroy 
their altars, break their images, and cut down their 
groves."  The Semites (Jews) were instructed by God to smite 
the collective nations in Canaan and "utterly destroy them; 
thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto 
them: Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy 
daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter 
shalt thou take unto thy son.  For they will turn away thy 
son from following me, that they may serve other gods; so 
will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and 
destroy thee suddenly."  God is defintely directing a plan 
to remove the remanent of the demon/human hybrid species 
which was not, unfortunately, totally wiped out in the Great 
Flood. 
 
Still, though despite the growing power of the Jews and the 
Divine decree, the Jews were frightened because of the 
technology of the Canaanites.  Joshua, after crossing into 
the land, reassured the people of God saying, "for thou 
shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron 
chariots, and though they be strong."   Still all the 
descendants of Ham were not utterly destroyed and it was the 
Pharoah king of Egypt who had helped clear many, but not 
all, of the Canaanites out of the land.   The area of 
Jerusalem was given as a present to his (Pharoah's) daughter 
who as also the wife of Solomon.  The remaining Canaanites 
went, by the decree of Solomon, into the levy of bond 
service to the children of Israel.  This "covenant" with the 
remaining Canaanites proved, as God had already warned, to 
be the undoing of Solomon and he went off into idolatry and 
maintained Canaanite concubines. 
 
Solomon began to worship Ashtoreth, the goddess of the 
Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the 
Ammonites; finally also including the gods Chemosh and 
Molech.  Solomon's great kingdom taken from him and 
eventually given to the "ten tribes."  The lineage of the 
hybrids goes on... 
 
We see, in this brief review, that there is STILL TODAY 
genes of the hybrid species product of the "Fallen Ones" and 
"Daughters of men" on the earth.  Descendants of Canaan, the 
child of the result of the union of Ham's wife with the 
"Fallen One" called "Shemhazai", have not been "utterly 
destroyed" (Ex. 33:2, 34:11, De. 7:1, Jos. 5:1; 17:12; 1 K. 
9:16).   Why is it, in this day and age of the UFO/alien 
thinking, that these "aliens" are reported to do such things 
as impregnate women and steal their fetus before it is born? 
Why is it that there are reports of human men having sexual 
relationships with female "aliens?"  Why is it that there is 
such apparent interest in genetics reported associated with 
these present-day "aliens?" Why is it that the "aliens'" 
technology is considered so advanced?  Who are the hybrids 
today and what is their genetic signature? 
 
Is there any great doubt to the Christian about the true 
nature of these "aliens?"  Is there any great doubt as to 
how the "aliens" or the hybrid species regard Christians? 
Is it the Christians who are to "purge the genepool?"  BY NO 
MEANS!!  CHRISTIANS ARE NOT NOT NOT NAZIS.  We do see in 
this discussion, however, that the work of the Nazis to wipe 
out the Jews "because they are a lower root race" <ahem...> 
begins to make some sense in the grand overview.  We begin 
to see some of the thinking guiding the evil that is in the 
world...  We are, perhaps, witnessing a "gene war" that has 
been going on since the beginning of recorded history -- 
that war is a battle of "who" shall possess the flesh of the 
human race. 
 
It is by the blood of the perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ, that 
we are saved unto Him and are already victorious for it is 
written that no flesh shall enter the Kingdom of God.  Jesus 
said, "I am going to prepare a place for you that where I am 
there also shall you be."  It is written "that ye are dead 
and your life is hidden with Christ Jesus."  We know also, 
that after this age there shall be yet another and, then, 
finally another in which (see Revelations) the "gene war" 
shall come to an end on earth and God himself shall dwell 
with His people. 
 
As a final note: the Human Genome Project is currently 
underway in the molecular biological sciences.  This project 
is a very ambitious undertaking in which the entire human 
genetic code will be mapped.  Estimates of when the mapping 
shall be completed vary from between 5 to 10 years from now. 
Only coincidence?  The work of Good or Evil?  Time will 
shortly tell...
