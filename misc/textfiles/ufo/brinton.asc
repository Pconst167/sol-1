        Mr. Keely  begins  with  sounds whose vibrations can be known and
   registered. I presume that the laws  of  ratio, position, duality, and
   continuity, all the laws which go to mould the plastic  air by elastic
   bodies into the  sweetness  of  music,  will  also be found ruling and
   determining all in the high silence of interior vibrations, which hold
   together or shake asunder the combinations  that  we  call  atoms  and
   ultimate elements. - The Science of Music. D.C. Ramsay.  Edited by the

        What Keely  has  discovered  in  physics, I am  in  some  measure
   credited with discovering  in  metaphysics:  this  is nothing strange,
   according to this philosophy, which  shows that many people may divine
   the same original  truth  at  the same time by means  of  the  etheric
   element which connects  the  Deity,  the source of all truth, with all
   His creatures. - Preface to Vera Vita; or, the Philosophy of Sympathy.

        Abstract of Keely's Physical Philosophy in its main features
                  up to the point of practical application;
                      by Professor Daniel G.  Brinton,
                       of the Pennsylvania University;
                   subject to modifications and additions
                   when Keely has made public his system.
   
   The fundamental conception of the Universe is force manifesting itself
   in rhythmical relations.
   
        This definition  is  exhaustive,   including   both  thought  and
   extension, matter and mind. The law for the one is  the  law  for  the
   other. The distinction   between   them   is   simply  relative,  i.e.
   quantitative, not qualitative.
   
        The rhythmic relations in which  force acts are everywhere, under
   all conditions, and  at  all  times,  the  same.    They   are   found
   experimentally to be   universally  expressible  by  the  mathematical
   relations of thirds.
   
        These threefold relations may  be  expressed with regard to their
   results as,--
   
                          I. Assimilative.
                         II. Individualizing.
                        III. Dominant or Resultant.

     From these three actions are derived the three fundamental;
   
                           LAWS OF BEING.
   
         I. Law  of Assimilation: every individualized object assimilates
            itself to all other objects.
        II. Law  of  Individualization:   every   such  object  tends  to
            assimilate all other objects to itself.
       III. Law of the Dominant: every such object is such  by  virtue of
            the higher   or  dominant  force  which  controls  these  two
            tendencies.
   
        Applying these  fundamental   laws   to  an  explanation  of  the
   universe, as it  is brought to human cognition, all manifestations  of
   force may be treated as modes of vibrations. The essential differences
   give rise to three modes of vibration:--
   
         I. The   Radiative   :   called   also   the  `Dispersing,'  the
            `Propulsive,' the `Positive,' and the `Enharmonic.'
        II. The Focalizing: called also  the  `Negative,'  the  `Negative
            Attractive,' the `Polarizing,' and the `Harmonic.'
       III. The Dominant: called also the `Etheric,' or the `Celestial.'
   
        These, it will be noted, correspond to the three  laws  of being.
   It is not  to  be  understood  that  any  one  of these three modes of
   vibration can exist  independently.   Each   by  itself  is  called  a
   `current,' and all three must be present in every `stream'  or  `flow'
   of force. The  relations of the currents in every flow are expressible
   in thirds, and it is experimentally  demonstrable that the relation of
   the three are in the order named: as 33 1/33 : 66 2/3 : 100.
   
        The evolution of what is called `matter' from the different modes
   of vibration is  through  the  action  of  the  second  law,  that  of
   focalization, or `negative attraction,' or `negative affinity.'
   
        Where the  vibrations under this mode meet, and are maintained in
   a stated of mutual affinity or equilibrium,  there is established what
   is called a `neutral centre,' or, as otherwise expressed,  a centre of
   sympathetic coincidence.
   
        The terms  `neutral  attraction,'  `neutral  affinity,' `negative
   attraction,' or `polar negative attraction,'  are  employed to express
   the property of  a  mode of vibration to direct its components  toward
   such centre.
   
        As no  current  or  flow  of force can be composed of one mode of
   vibration only, but must always be  composed of three modes uniting in
   varying thirds, we have 1 x 2 x 3 = 6 as the total possible  forms  of
   sympathetic coincidence, or,  to speak in ordinary terms, there can be
   six; and six only, possible forms of  individualized  being. These are
   what Keely calls the six orders of atomic subdivision,  or  orders  of
   vibratory motion, and he names them as follows:
   
                         I. Molecular.
                        II. Inter-molecular.
                       III. Atomic.
                        IV. Inter-atomic.
                         V. Etheric.
                        VI. Inter-etheric.
   
   
                                   Page 2
   



     In this last the forms of matter are arranged in the mathematical
   sequence of the  rapidity  of  the  oscillations  of their constituent
   members; the proportion being proved  by experiment to be as follows :
   for the molecular orders :
   
                         1 : 3 : 9 : 27 : 81 : 243.
   
        This arithmetical progression changes in the atomic  orders  to a
   geometrical progression as follows :
   
                     3 : 9 : 81 : 6561 : 43046721, etc.
   
        This same  method  of  progression is believed to hold in all the
   orders of vibrations  above  the  molecular,   and  soon  passes  into
   mathematical infinity.
   
        Actually, however,  all  matter  of  which  we   are  capable  of
   cognition through the medium of our senses is in one of three forms of
   aggregation :
   
                             I. Molecular
                            II. Atomic
                           III. Etheric
   
   in each of which the controlling mode of vibration is respectively,
   
                           I. The Enharmonic
                          II. The Harmonic
                         III. The Dominant
   
   But it must  be  understood that each of these modes is a positive and
   real constituent of every atom and molecule.
   
   
        It will be seen that as every  form of material aggregation is to
   be considered as a `neutral centre of attraction,' where the vibratory
   force of all three orders are held in `sympathetic coincidence,'  that
   is, in balanced  activity  or  harmonized motion, and not by any means
   cancelled or mutually destroyed, there  is no diminution of force, but
   only temporary suspension of its radiating or propulsive  activity  or
   expression.
   
        This is the foundation of Keely's doctrine of `latent force,' and
   of the indefinite  power  which  can  be  obtained  by breaking up the
   harmonious balance or equation of forces  of  every mode, which exists
   in every `neutral centre,' that is to say in every mass of matter.
   
        Insomuch as  every  mass  of matter consists thus,  in  fact,  of
   vibrations in harmonic  equilibrium,  related by simple proportions of
   thirds, it follows that every mass  of  every  description  stands  in
   harmonic relation to  every other mass.  This is,  in  part,  what  is
   meant by the  sympathy of all forms of matter and of motion; and it is
   through the study of the methods of  increasing  or  diminishing  this
   sympathy that we reach practical results in this field of research. At
   present this is best accomplished by resonance ; that  is, through the
   harmonic vibrations created  by  musical instruments, bringing out the
   acoustic world as the microscope reveals the hidden visual world.
   
   
   
   
                                   Page 3
   



     Every visible  or  tangible mass of matter must be regarded as an
   aggregation of molecules ; the molecules being the true centres of the
   equated forces of `neutralized attraction.'
   
        These molecules have been experimentally  proved  by  Keely to be
   formed of all  three modes of vibration ; the proof  being  that  they
   respond to all  three  modes  when  subjected to the tests of compound
   concordant impulses.
   
        It is through the disturbance of this oscillatory equilibrium, by
   means of resonant impulses, that Keely  alters  the  relations  of the
   vibratory impulses which constitute matter. This be  does  by striking
   the same chord  in  three  octaves, representing the third, sixth, and
   ninth of the scale.
   
        Of these, the sixth reduces the  range of molecular vibrations or
   oscillations ; and, by thus bringing nearer to each  other the neutral
   centres, increases solidifications.
   
        The ninth  extends  the  range of molecular oscillation, and thus
   tends to give greater tenuity to the  mass.  It  induces  ` trajectile
   velocity ' form neutral centres, or ` neutral radiation.  ' Experiment
   shows that molecular  dissociation  does  not  take  place  until  the
   molecule attains an oscillation approaching,  if  not  fully  reaching
   two-thirds of its  diameter.  This can be effected  by  means  of  the
   action of the  `  enharmonic ' or ` radiating ' current applied to the
   mass, after its  molecules  have   once  been  disturbed  by  an  `in-
   troductory impulse; ' that is, by the musical note above mentioned.
   
        The third  represents  the ` dominant, ' and when  brought  under
   control of a    harmonic   resonant   impulse   induces   a   complete
   rearrangement off the modes of vibration  and  oscillation  ; in other
   words, will transform  the  mass  either  into  its component  initial
   forces, or into some other form of matter.
   
        It is  the  study  of the dominant to which Keely has devoted his
   recent researches. He aims to control the power he evolves by altering
   the dominant or etheric mode of vibration  in  the triplicate flows of
   force.
   
        As all  molecules  and  masses  are  mere centres  of  harmonized
   vibrations, temporarily held  in  suspension  by simple laws identical
   with those of resonance, it follows  that  these centres can be broken
   up or divided  by  certain  orders  of  vibration impinging  upon  and
   disturbing them.
   
        It is a familiar fact that a cord in vibration tends to produce a
   similar vibration in  a  cord placed near it. This property belongs to
   all vibrations, whether  resonant   or  not,  and  they  exert  it  in
   proportion to the  `  order ' to which they belong.  The  distance  in
   space to which  this  power  extends,  or  can be extended, is what is
   called ` the sympathetic outreach ' of the current or flow.
   
        In this manner we have ` sympathetic negative attraction, ' and `
   sympathetic positive propulsion, '  with reference to the ` outreach '
   of the third or dominant current of the stream, which is allied to the
   order of etheric vibrations.
   
   
   
   
                                   Page 4
   



     Each molecule  of  a  given  mass  of  matter represents the same
   harmonic chord or note in its oscillatory  motion.  The ` chord of the
   mass ' is, therefore, the chord of every molecule the mass.
   
        But as  the  condition  of  absolutely  stable   equilibrium   is
   theoretical only, and  does not exist in nature, the chord of the mass
   is constantly changing. Yet we must  learn  to control this ` chord of
   the mass '  by  resonant induction, if we would gain  command  of  the
   molecular forces.
   
        Keely believes  he has solved this problem, by the invention of a
   mechanical device which brings the  chords  of  all  masses within the
   conditions of a few simple acoustic tests.
   
        The range  of  molecular oscillation is affected  differently  in
   different substances when submitted to the same vibratory impulse, and
   these ranges can be measured.
   
        In the  three  metals,  silver,  gold, and platina, we obtain the
   proportions --- 3 : 6 : 9 : --- As this is the primary relation of the
   modes of vibration, a wire made of  these  three  metals is peculiarly
   adapted to transmit  concordant  impulses : and nodes  made  of  these
   substances placed upon   a  wire,  transmitting  resonant  vibrations,
   indicate, by the different orders  of  vibration  induced in them, the
   rate of oscillations of the atomic constituents.
   
        The phenomenon  of rotation arises from the harmonic  interaction
   of the dominant  and enharmonic elements of the flow : in other words,
   the first and  third,  the  third   and  ninth,  etc.  ;  those  whose
   vibrations bear the proportions to each other 33 1/3 : 100.
   
        A practical example of rotation is a wheel in revolution  on  its
   axis. This is   force   in  its  commercial  or  economic  aspect.  to
   accomplish this result by molecular  vibratory  action,  we  must gain
   control of the ` negative attractive ' or ` enharmonic  '  current  of
   the triple flow,  and  the  problem  is then solved up to any limit of
   power.
