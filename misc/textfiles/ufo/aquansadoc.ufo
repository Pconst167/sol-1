                             CENTRAL SECURITY SERVICE

                                                         15 APR 1986



      This responds to your  letter of 7 March 1986 in  which you further
narrowed your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for records
 pertaining to Project Aquarius.

      The document located in response to  your request as stated in your
7 March letter has  been reviewed by this Agency as  required by the FOIA
and has been found to be  currently and properly classified in accordance
with  Executive  Order  12356.   This document  meets  the  criteria  for
classification as set forth  in subparagraphs 2, 4, and 8  of section l.3
and remains classified TOP SECRET as provided in section l.l of Executive
Order 12356.   The document  is classified  because its  disclosure could
reasonably  be  expected  to  cause exceptionally  grave  damage  to  the
national  security.   Because  the document  is  currently  and  properly
classified, it is exempt from disclosure  pursuant to the first exemption
of the FOIA (5 U.S.C.  section 552(b)(l)).

      In  addition, this  Agency  is authorized  by  various statutes  to
protect  certain   information  concerning   its  activities.    We  have
determined that such  information exists in this  document.  Accordingly,
those portions  are also  exempt from  disclosure pursuant  to the  third
exemption of the  FOIA which provides for the  withholding of information
specifically protected from disclosure by statute.  The specific statutes
applicable in this case are Title 18  U.S.  Code 798; Title 50 U.S.  Code
403(d)(3); and Section 6, Public Law 86-36 (50 U.S.  Code 402 "note").

      No portion of the information is reasonably segregable.

      Since your request has been denied,  you are hereby advised of this
Agency's appeal procedures.

      Any person denied  access to information may, within  45 days after
notification of  the denial,  file an  appeal to  the NSA/CSS  Freedom of
Information  Act  Appeal  Authority.   The appeal  shall  be  in  writing
addressed to the NSA/CSS FOIA Appeal Authority, National Security Agency,
Fort George  G.  Meade,  MD 20755-6000.  The  appeal shall  reference the
initial denial  of access  and shall  contain, in  sufficient detail  and
particularity, the grounds  upon which the requester  believes release of
the information is required.  The  NSA/CSS Appeal Authority shall respond
to the appeal within 20 working days after receipt.

      In your letter, you take exception  to the amount requested by this
Agency for  manpower and  computer search fees  to process  your original
request for all information on Project  Aquarius.  Please be advised that
NSA search and duplication fees are  computed in accordance with guidance
promulgated in sections 6-201 and 6-202 of DoD Directive 5400.7-R.

                                           Sincerely,


                                        JULIA B. WETZEL
                                       Director of Policy
