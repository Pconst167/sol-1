                             INTRODUCTION

       Since prehistory, man has been observing unusal happenings
       in the sky.  Those occurences have been given various names
       to suit the trends of the times.  However, in almost every
       instance, the identifying nomenclatures used were either
       inaccurate or misleading for the various forms of reported
       experiences.

       Historically, we have used a variety of names such as angels,
       flying shields, mystery airships, phantom planes, ghost
       rockets, flying saucers and unidentified flying objects to
       describe aerial phenomena.  But those terms are both
       restrictive and lacking in accuracy.  The phenomena that we
       study ranges from micro specks in the sky to macro masses
       sometimes comparable to unnatural structures.

       Observations by witnesses of truly enigmatic occurences in
       the sky fall into two broad categories: (1) Natural aerial
       phenomena and/or  (2) Unknown aerial phenomena (having an
       apparent intelligent source).  Both categories deserve
       serious disciplined study.  It is essential that we differen-
       tiate between the two categories and classify, when possible.

       Because of this crucial need, we do not go beyond the point
       of referring to anomalous aerial phenomena by other names
       such as spaceships, flying saucers and UFOs.  To do so would
       be equivalent to stating that we study spaceships, flying
       saucers and unidentified flying objects; none of which would
       be accurate.  We use such terms only as historical and
       reported references; not as verified identifiable nomen-
       clatures.

       We oppose the use of misleading names which help to give
       the press, public and scientific community a totally false
       impression of actual aerial phenomena.  In order to overcome
       the stigma attached to this subject, we need the help and
       support of the most experienced and knowledgeable people
       available.

       Investigators, researchers and serious students of aerial
       phenomena are encouraged to share their works and findings
       with us.  We endeavor to make as much factual information
       available as possible to both our associates and to the
       public at large.  Should you wish to participate in our
       activities or have a work published and distributed,
       please contact us for details.
