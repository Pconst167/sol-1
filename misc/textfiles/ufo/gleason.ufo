Did Jackie Gleason view UFO bodies?

NEW YORK - The clamorous cry To the moon. ALice" frequently delivered on the
"Honeymooners" by the late, great Jackie Gleason, may have been inspired in
part by the comic's fascination with outer space.
         Gleason was an avowed believer in UFOs and, according to his ex-wife
Beverly McKittrick, he even got involved in some spaced-out exploits with his
friend Richard Nixon.
         Beverly was 37-year-old divorcee with a great golf game when Jackie
met her at Miami country club.  Their four year marriage ended in 1974
         In her unpublished biography of the funnyman entitled "The Great
One,"Beverly, Gleason's second spouse, describes a bizarre trip Jackie took with
the then President in 1973 to Homestead AFB in Florida to see what see says
were bodies of four dead space aliens recovered by the Air Force.
         The aliens were supposedly embalmed and displayed on operating tables
and classified as top-secret material.  Gleason and Nixon visited the base under
extremely tight security, she says.
         "The significance of the information is tremendous," said Mike
Luckman, director of the UFO research Center in New York. "The four bodies that
Gleason saw were probably the same ones the the Army recovered in 1947 at
Roswell, N.M.  We want to establish that link."
         Gleason had a lifelong interest in the supernatural and accumulated one
of the largest private libraries of esoteric and psychic literature in the
country.
         He even named his Peekskill N.Y. home "The Mothership" and had
architects build everything in the round to resemble a flying saucer.
         Said Luckman: "Most of the furniture was circular.  So was the garage,
which he called the Scout Ship."
