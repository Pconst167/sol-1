   About 7 years ago, during the summer, something awoke me....An urge to use
the toilet.  Being half asleep I walked to the bathroom and proceeded doing
a what I had to....After finishing I glanced out the bathroom window and saw a circular
disc with red and green lights...At first I didn't know what is was....But it
was "LANDED" in my Back Yard.  I went back to sleep thinking it was only a
dream. The next morning in my backyard were 4 or 5 (I Don't Remember)
circular depressions in my yard at equel distances...As if SOMETHING had
pressed the grass and some ground down.  Thinking nothing of it,  I proceeded
to ride my bike around my block like I did EVERY morning.  A girl which was
then in 12th grade asked me to stop for a second. She asked me what happened
at my house around 1-2 am. She told me she saw RED AND GREEN LIGHTS!  I told
her nothing that I know of. That SAME day 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE ASKED ME THE
SAME QUESTION and one person TOLD ME THAT SHE SAW A U.F.O. LAND IN MY BACK
YARD,(She was at least 16 years old and would not make up a story!).  What
happened, I DON'T KNOW but whatever it was I hope it doesn't COME BACK!!!
 
   
Believe it or not this is a locacl sighting in Webster,Ny.I don't thin
k
I'll use the sightees' name but this is a true story.
