ARNPRIOR.TXT - UFO encounter near Ottawa, Canada - AUG/1979

======================================================================

 	The following report you are about to read concerns a most
 interesting UFO sighting which occurred on August 17, 1989 over the
 skies of Ontario, near our Nation's Capital, Ottawa.  The first
 piece of information you will see is a routine telex sent to the
 National Research Council of Canada (NRC), which since the late 60's
 has been given the responsibility as acting as the repository of
 UFO reports.  The second piece of info, is a reproduction of the
 10 page letter sent to Uplands Air Base (and forwarded to the NRC)
 by one of the two observers of the UFO sighting.  The second name,
 the name of the pilot, is blacked out in both instances, along with
 his address and phone number.  Through unique circumstances, I was
 able to obtain the name of the pilot, which happens to be that of
 John Cassidy, who was also (now retired) a long-time police officer.

	The reasons for looking into this case are several.  For one
 thing, as I think you'll agree, this particular UFO sighting seems
 particularly remarkable because of the credibility of the witnesses,
 and the effects and duration of the UFO sighting.  I've gone to
 the trouble of reproducing this information here, since I think it
 a good example of a fairly recent sighting which to date, doesn't
 seem to have any usual explanation, although I have yet to check
 with the NRC for their own findings.  I noticed this particular
 report while scanning through hundreds of pages of sighting reports
 which can be found on microfilm, and obtained through the National
 Archives of Canada.  In addition, this sighting occurred less than
 100 miles from my home town of Renfrew, Ontario, where at that time
 I was residing.  Additionally, and this is how I came upon the name
 of the pilot, Cassidy is also known by both my father and brother,
 who at the time were both private pilots, and who flew out of
 Arnprior, Ontario, quite frequently.  Thus, this particular UFO
 incident is interesting to me for personal reasons.

	I'm currently in the process of doing some nominal follow
 up on this case in order to ascertain whether or not the NRC did
 any further investigation on it, and whether or not they came up
 with a prosaic explanation.  Progress has already been made as to
 getting additional details, and hopefully by about January 1990,
 I'll have some further comments to make regarding this most
 extraordinary UFO encounter of 10 yrs ago.

         was reproduced poorly for the microfilm which I viewed.

 Dear Sir,

	On Aug. 17, 1979, I was flying from St. Jovite, Que., to

 Arnprior, Ont; heading 270~.  I was in a single prop, fixed wing,

 white with blue markings, 1974, Cherokee Warrior aircraft.  I was

 sitting beside the pilot in the cockpit.  The two passenger seats

 behind us were not occupied.  Please note: neither myself or the

 pilot were under the influence of alcohol or drugs...[text faded

 on bottom of page]...  We are both healthy, stable, cool, calculating

 individuals, not given to halucinations or hysteria.  We have known

 each other over 25 yrs.  I am, by profession, a medical technologist.

 The pilot is, by profession, a police officer of approximately 16

 yrs. experience.  He is also a cattle farmer, and has good fortune

 in the stock and bond exchange over the past 30 yrs.  He is a pilot

 of many years experience, and owns the aircraft we were flying in...

 No. C-GOUD.


 	We were cruising at an altitude of...[text faded on bottom of

 page]... Ottawa.  We were above the Gatineau hills, approximately

 40 miles N.E. of Ottawa.  Visibility was excellent - maximum,

 approximately 40 miles or more, minimum , 25 miles.  The time of

 the following experience was 2100 hrs.  The pilot's watch stopped

 at 2100 hrs, mine was not affected.


	I looked out of my window and observed the (R) wing becoming

 red in color.  I then looked to my left, past the pilot's head, and

 observed the the (L) wing was also red in color.  I mentioned my

 observation to...[text faded on bottom of page]... performance of

 the aircraft.  The pilot said to me, "the aircraft is slowing down

 - our airspeed is "0" - the instruments are behaving strangely."

 I said to the pilot "take it down 1000 ft.".  He replied, "I can't,

 I can't control the aircraft; the controls are jammed or something

 - we should be falling yet we aren't".  I said, "there is something

 out there - it must be exactly overhead;  I can't see it" - The

 pilot agreed.  At that point we both felt the aircraft being pulled

 upwards...[text faded on bottom of page]... appeared to be stationary

 in the sky, was being drawn upwards.  The pilot looked out the right

 window and said to me, "My God, look at the size of it; it must be

 close to 300 ft. in diameter."  When I looked, I saw a gigantic red

 ball of energy, close to the right wing and close to the aircraft.

 It sped away rapidly and as it did it appeared to be white light on

 the reverse side...  The depth of it was approximately 50 ft.  It

 disappeared into a large dark gray cloud to the west of us, only to

 re-appear in the same cloud rolling towards the orange ...[text faded

 on bottom of page]... it rolled, we saw it's red radiant side then

 its white radiant side, as it rolled along the cloud exposed to our

 view.  When it sped away from our aircraft, we had a falling sen-

 sation.  The aircraft was returning to normal.  The altimeter read

 5000 ft.  We estimated that we must have fallen 1000 ft. before we

 got this reading.  In total we estimated that we had been drawn

 upwards 2000 ft. at least.  At 4000 ft., we were flying once again,

 right on course, just as it had been before this experience.  The

 temperature ...[text faded on bottom of page]...


	This experience lasted 5-8 min. approximately... by my watch.

 We ruled out St. Elmos fire because of the duration of the experience,

 plus "its" re-appearance in the distant cloud.  As we descended to

 land at Arnprior airport, the rolling, red and white, energy ball,

 disappeared into the orange sky of the sunset.


	I am reporting this to you as I feel it is my duty to do so.

 You may keep this for your records.  We feel that we were very

 fortunate.  This thing could have ...[text faded at bottom of page]...

 be so fortunate.


	The pilot is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Ont; telephone

 XXXXXXXX  He can usually be reached mornings 9 a.m. to 12 noon,

 with the exception of Wed and Sat and Sun.


   	Should you wish to contact him regarding this matter, please

 use discretions, as his young wife is insanely jealous of him, and

 very protective of 2 young children.  She does not respect him or

 his rights.  She opens his mail and interferes with his phone calls.

 Try to speak ...[text faded at bottom of page]... for the time being

 at least, should you not be able to speak with him privately.  If

 he cannot speak freely, leave your name and number and he will

 return your call.  Or better still, phone or write me, and I will

 relay your message to him.  This later (sic) method would be more

 reliable.  The pilot has hesitated informing you of this sighting

 due to his marital set up.  He is presently proceeding with divorce

 proceedings however that is not yet completed.


	Your co-ordination would be most ...[text faded at bottom

 of page]...


	At the advice of my personal physician, here in Arnprior, I

 requested that screening tests be done to determine whether or not,

 the pilot and myself were exposed to excess radiations, and absorbed

 same.  I made this request Mon, Aug. 20th, to Dr. Wate of Radiation

 Protection Bureau 998-4708 under the Federal Health and Welfare

 Dep't. 996-4950, by telephone, and I must say that he was less than

 helpful, or co-operative.  He claimed our case to be "beyond his

 realm of experience, and let the matter drop at that."
