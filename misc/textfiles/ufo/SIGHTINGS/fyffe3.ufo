 So  you think that sighting UFO's, unidentified flying  objects, 
only happens in the movies? Try telling this to the residents  of 
Fiffe, Alabama, a northeastern farm town of about 1300. The story 
began  about  three Friday evenings ago, when  Donna  Saylor  was 
returning home with her sister. 

Donna Saylor, First Eyewitness, Fiffe, Alabama:
 "It  was 7:30 I'd say, and my sister and I were coming home  from 
town and we spotted a bright light over in the sky just above the 
treetops. We commented on how... you know... what it was and  how 
low  it  was  and stuff and the fact that it  wasn't  moving.  We 
looked right straight at it, and we got to look at it about 5  to 
8 seconds or so and the object just disappeared."

Greta McHenry, WBMG Action News, Birmingham, Alabama:
 After Mrs. Saylor's sighting of the UFO, she contacted the Fiffe 
Police  Department around 8:40 P.M. Assistant Police  Chief  Fred 
Words  and  the  Police  Chief  responded  to  the  call.   While 
traveling DeKalb County Road 43, they too noticed a large lighted 
object overhead. They stopped to investigate.

Fred Works, Assistant Police Chief, Fiffe, Alabama:
 "I watched it, it just got bigger and bigger and had lights  kind 
of  down under it shining back on the bottom of it. And we  never 
heard a sound from it. It appeared to be no sound whatsoever."

Greta McHenry, WBMG Action News, Birmingham, Alabama:
 Since  the  first reported sighting, other Fiffe  residents  say 
they have seen a similar object. 

Rhonda Worley, Eyewitness, Fiffe, Alabama:
 "It's  really  hard  to  explain it  until  you've  seen  it  for 
yourself, but it was, it was something I've never seen before."

Greta McHenry, WBMG Action News, Birmingham, Alabama:
 Those  who have seen "it" say that they want to see "it"  again, 
to  perhaps  make  sense  out  of  something  that  remains   yet 
unexplained.
