            RECENT SIGHTINGS IN NORWALK PROBABLY A STAR, EXPERTS SAY


          Report to Galactic Command - Re: Fairfield County, Earth.
          Captain's Log: Star Date 5387
          
          The  meteor  shower  encountered  near  Xoron 7 weakened the 
          ship's cloaking device.
          For  about one earth hour, 14 planetary revolutions ago, the 
          starship  became  visible to earth's inhabitants in the geo-
          graphic quadrant known as Fairfield County.
          Evasive  strategy  was  undertaken  and the ship was aligned 
          with  the  star  Sirius.  It was hoped the brightness of the 
          star  at  night would mask our vessel until the cloaking de-
          vice became operational again.
          While  several  earthlings  from societal compounds known as 
          Bridgeport,  Norwalk,  and Darien did report seeing a UFO to 
          local  authorities, monitoring of communications in the days 
          that  followed  has  determined that the ploy was effective. 
          Earth  scientists  have  attributed  the  sightings  to  the 
          star's twinkling.

     Whether the circular object with blue, red  and green lights that was seen
hovering over Norwalk on  the evening of April 19 is a star  or starship - will
probably never be known.
     Several devotees  of exploring  UFOs, however, have  said that  the appar-
ition was  probably the star Sirius  - the brightest star  in the sky -  or an-
other star called Capella.
     "Its my belief that they were seeing the two stars", said Philip Imbrogno,
astronomer and board member at the Bowman Observatory in Greenwich.
     Imbrogno  drew  his conclusions  after  he  interviewed Robert  Cole,  the
Norwalk custodian who saw the UFO, and his neighbors on Brookfield Street.
     When stars are low on the horizon at this time of year, Imbrogno said they
can take on a spectacular appearance because of inversions in the atmo- sphere.
     He said different layers  of cold and warm air create  a lens effect which
distorts the appearance of the star.
     "It changes colors  and flickers blue, red  and green", he said.   "It can
seem strange to someone seeing it for the  first time, but this has been a fre-
quent culprit for UFO sightings in the past."
     Jim Speiser,  director of ParaNet in  Arizona, a national network  of com-
puter users who  investigate paranormal occurrences like UFOs,  agreed with Im-
brogno.
     "These individuals saw a very large bright object in the southwest sky for
45 minutes and then it disappeared," he said.  "Monday was cloudy and it wasn't
seen.  But it was seen again on Tuesday  when it was clear.  I suspected it was
an astronomical body."
     Speiser said he  ran a computer program called "PC  Planetarium" which can
chart the night sky  on any day in the Western Hemisphere,  and as he expected,
Sirius was right where the sightings occurred.
     "I don't  want to come  out and accuse anyone  of being myopic,"  he said.
"They may have seen something strange.  I can't say for sure.  But I suspect it
was the star."
     Dr.  Mel  Goldstein, meteorologist at  the Western Connecticut  State Uni-
versity said that the atmospheric effect described by Imbrogno is common.
     While Imbrogno, who  has investigated 500 cases  in the last 15  years, is
not ready to say that UFOs are visitors  from outer space, he does believe that
in some cases people are seeing something extraordinary.
     "The  bottom line  is that  the UFO  phenomena  is real,"  he said.   Dale
Goudie, head  of the UFO Information  Service in Seattle said  his organization
has documented 300 cases in the United States since 1985.
     "That's only  about two percent  of the  total cases," he  said.  Imbrogno
said that  even more UFOs  than usual will  be sighted  in 1987.  "I  think its
going to be a  big year for UFOs," he said.   "(Steven) Spielberg will probably
do another movie  and there will be shows  on TV which will  cause sightings to
increase.  People will be looking to the sky more."
     "While they maintain that UFOs are occurring  all the time, several of the
experts said they believe  the latest rise in UFO interest  is because of books
like the  best-seller "Communion"  -- a  purported true  story of  abduction by
aliens, and "Intruders",  a scientific study of  people who claim to  have been
abducted.
     Imbrogno and  Speiser said they were  pleased with those works.   The less
scientific approach  taken in the book  and television movie made  from Shirley
MacLaine's book "Out on a Limb," however, has disturbed some in- vestigators.
     Whether Fairfield  County will become a  hotbed for UFO research  is ques-
tionable.  Still everyone agrees that interest in sightings can only grow.
     "Its  a very  popular subject,"  Speiser said.   "There will  always be  a
question mark: Are we alone?"
