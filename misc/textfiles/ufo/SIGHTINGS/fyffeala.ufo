Re: Fyffe Alabama UFO sightings


  The small town of Fyffe, located in the northeast corner
of Alabama, was the location of UFO sightings on Friday and
Saturday, February 11-12, 1989. Over fifty people in the town
of less that two thousand called the Fyffe Police Department
to report sitings on two separate occasions.

  The first impression of eye witness Donna Saylor, who watched
the strange lights for over an hour before reporting them to the
Fyffe Police Department, was that the object appeared to resemble
a banana.  "I wish I'd never said banana" Ms. Saylor commented
in response to jokes about her description of the object sighted
just above the tree tops. It hovered at an angle from 1 o'clock
to 7 o'clock with "bright lights at the top and bottom and a real
bright light at the center. The curvature was outlined in green"
with "a real bright light in the center".

  Fyffe Police Chief Junior Garmany and Asst. Police Chief Fred
Works responded to the call. Following reports "well outside Fyffe
city limits" they saw something in the sky and attempted to chase
it. "At that time me and Fred were on County Road 43" said Chief
Garmany. They got out of the car as they saw a UFO coming in their
direction. "The object came on over and got straight overhead" said
Asst. Chief Works. "It was big, wide and appeared to be a wide
triangular shape". "We kept waiting to hear the sound. We kept
looking at each other and saying 'where's the sound'. We never
heard anything".

  Over 100 news organizations from throughout the world have
converged on Fyffe.

  "What I saw the first time was like nothing I ever saw before. It
was not a helicopter, it was not a plane. Not a sound" Chief
Garmany stated.
