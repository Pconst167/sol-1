   BOSTON (AP) -- Joann Berte swears she was paralyzed by three-fingered aliens
and taken aboard their spaceship. Marianne Shenefield, who claims to have twice
encountered extraterrestrials, said people who have seen them have an aura. 
   Their stories are likely to be heard in dozens of variations this weekend at
a conference in Waltham expected to draw more than 250 UFO experts and people
who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrials. 
   "I was immobilized. I couldn't move and I didn't think to speak. I just
watched," said Berte of a warm night on Dec. 10, 1979, when she says she was
awakened on a friend's porch in Rhode Island and carried in a paralyzed state
aboard an alien spacecraft. 
   Berte tells of observing a small, three-fingered alien in an incubator and
being brought to a glass-enclosed platform overlooking a table where her friend
lay with a tube extending from her navel. 
   "It makes you very angry," said Berte. "They don't ask your permission. They
just take you away." 
   Arthur Myers, a conference coordinator and member of a church group
interested in the paranormal, said the gathering is one of the first public
meetings of people claiming to have had close encounters of the third kind. 
   "It reminds me a lot of alcholism or homosexuals coming out of the closet,"
said Myers. "There's a stigma attached to the abductees. But once someone comes
forward with their story, others are willing to speak." 
   Marianne Shenefield of Agawam is one of those yearning to let people know
about her two experiences. Thirty-five years ago, she was an 11-year-old girl
building a tree house in Agawam on a July afternoon. 
   "Then I turned around and there was what I thought was a little boy in a
scuba outfit," said Shenefield. "Then I felt this floating sensation and the
next thing I knew I was in this round craft." 
   Shenefield said the aliens put her under an X-ray device and she was
observed by several aliens, who tried to communicate with her by a sound-making
unit. 
   In 1972, Shenefield said, a female-like alien captured her outside her home
and brought her into a small compartment. Shenefield said she was released
hours later, dazed but unharmed. 
   A degenerative eye disorder has reduced her sight to dim shadows and bold
streaks of light. But the ailment enables her to see auras, she said. 
   "I can immediately detect someone who has been abducted," she said. "They
are surrounded by an indescribable color. Believe me, I can tell." 
   Author Ray Fowler said about 80 percent of all UFO sightings can be
explained. 
   "But there are those instances that defy any explanation," said the former
Air Force intelligence officer, a keynote speaker at the conference Saturday. 
   "It's imperative that we study these things with an open mind, not gullibly
accept them or reject them out of hand. There are too many people who come
forward with nothing to gain and everything to lose." 
   Fowler, whose book "The Andreasson Affair" describes a family's encounter
with aliens, said he became interested in UFOs after seeing flying discs in
1947. 
   He is director of the Mutual UFO Network, an international group that
documents UFO sightings.
