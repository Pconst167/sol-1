Welcome to the symposium on "Life Beyond Earth and the Mind of Man." Our 
topic will be the search for life in the universe and the ramifications of 
its possible discovery. Although there have been a handful of scientific 
meetings on this topic, to the best of my knowledge this it the first time 
there has ever been a meeting where a distinquished panel from diverse fields 
will discuss the topic in an open forum.

A generation ago almost all scientists would have argued, often "ex 
cathedra," that there probably is no other life in the universe beside what 
we know here on Earth. But as Martin Rees, the cosmologist, has succinctly 
put it, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Beyond that, in 
the last decade or so the evidence, albeit circumstantial, has become large 
indeed, so large, in fact, that today many scientists, probably the majority, 
are convinced that extraterrestrial life surely must exist and possibly in 
enormous abdundance. The question now is no longer so much of  IF as of 
WHERE, and with regard to the search, it has also become WHEN, for ultimate 
contact seems to many serious thinkers to be virtually inevitable. A short 
passage from the recent report of the Astronomy Survey Committee of the 
august National Academy of Sciences of the United States, the Nation's most 
disnguished scientific body, gives an example of the modern scientific 
attitude:

   "Each passing year has seen our estimates of the probability of life
    in space increase, along with our capabilities for detecting it. More
    and more scientists feel that contact with other civilizations is no
    longer something beyond our dreams but a natural event in the history
    of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of us.
    The promise is now too great, either to turn away from it or to wait
    much longer before devoting major resources to a search for other
    intelligent beings... In the long run this may be one of science's most
    important and most profound contributions to mankind and to our
    civilizatioin."

I believe it fair to say, therefore, that this momentous topic deserves 
careful, thorough discussion, and that is what I hope we shall give it today.


                     ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PANEL

ASHLEY MONTAGU: renowned anthropologist and social biologist For many years 
he was chariman of the Department of Anthropology at Rutgers He is the author 
of scores of books and research papers on a variety of topics in the social 
sciences, including the social and cultural development of mankind

KRISTER STENDAHL: an outstanding churchman and theologican, who is the Dean 
of Harvard School of Divinity. Dr. Stendahl is considered to be one of the 
Nation's most scholarly theologians.

CARL SAGAN: astronomer and exobiologist at Cornell University, and one of the 
five or six leading researchers on this question of extraterrestrial life. He 
is the coauthor with the Soviet astonomer I.S. Shklovskii of the book 
Intelligent Life in the Universe.


PHILIP MORRISON: a professor of physics at MIT durring this time, 13 
years prior to this symposium coauthored what was perhpas the first 
scientifically valid and reasoned paper ever published on possible modes of 
communications with etraterrestrial life. Dr. Morrison is considered in 
scholarly circles as one of the most broadly knowledgeable scientists in the 
Nation.

The chance of breaking out of the solar system and establishing physical
contact - or the chance of any creature in outer space establishing physical 
contact with us, coming to us from some other solar system -- seems to me so 
remote as to be almost nil. In order to do that, one would have to travel at 
the speed of light and it is rather hard to travel at the speed of light and 
not be light. SO I rather doubt that physical contact is possible.

But we now are discuuing another kind of contact, and that is communication. 
May I say, so that we can have a somewhat warmer and2 livelier conversation as 
this meeting goes on, that I can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying as 
establishing such communication with a so-called superior (or if you wish, 
advanced) technology in outer space. You see, I see no escape from the 
thought that more advanced technologies exist, very likely in a number of 
places within our own galaxy. That though in itself is a little terrifying to 
me, I muyst say, because of my view of and identification with the human 
enterprise.

You see, when I ask myself as a lifelong sicentist, "What's science about?" 
the answer is not to increase the catalog of facts, it is to achieve 
understanding. It means a great deal that one of the greatest human 
enterprises is understnaind. It is something that men have sweated out, to 
the greater dignity and worth of man. The thought that we might attach, as by 
an umbilical cord, to some more advanced civilization, with its more advanced 
science and technology, in outer space does not thrill me, but just the 
opposite. You see, I think it might thrill and fill with elation the people
who did it; but that is true of almost any enterprise one could name, however 
horrifying, however destructive to the rest of mankind. You cannot think of 
anything so horrifying that some person would not have a feeling of personal 
accomplishment at carrying it out; and I would say that the rest of us had 
better restrain him.


                              MONTAGU


These two facts render it likely, to judge from our immediate past 
performance [*note: 10,000 years of humanity as opposed to longer 
civilization maintenance by an extraterretestrial society], that upon 
encountering them, our Government will immediately convene a committee in 
order to determine whether these creatures consitute a threat to democracy. 
Since their physical appearance will be markedly different and since 
difference is usually equated in our culture with inferiority, no matter what 
the intellectual status of these creatures may be, and regardless of the 
healthy ways of life that characterize them, we shall, of course, know 
exactly where we belong in the nature of things. 

In short, we would have rather a problem on out hands, but we would not want, 
I suppose, the American way of life to be contaminated. With the record we 
have of treatment of the American Indians, the blacks, the Chicanos, and 
other minority groups, and our record in such places as Mexico, the 
Philippines, China, Vietname, and wherever else we have attempted to make the 
world safe for democracy, you can foresee what is likely to happen.

I hope you will understand that the assignment I was given was worded in the 
form, "How might human beings react to the discovery of life beyond Earth?" 
and I have interpreted the word "might" to mean "how may we probably react" 
and "how should we react." We are coming to the "should."

I do not think we should wait until the encounter occurs; we should do all in 
our power to prepare ourselves for it. The manner in which we first meet may 
determine the character of all our subsequent relations. Let us never forget 
the fatal impact we have had upon innumerable peoples on this Earth -- 
peoples of our own species who trusted us, befriended us, and whom we 
destroyed by our thoughlessness and insensitivity to their needs and 
vulnerabilities.

The simple truth is that before we can communicate with others succesfully, 
we must first learn to communicate with ourselves succesfully, and we are a 
long way from having achieved that. Perhaps that is where we ought to begin 
-- with ourselves. Learning to communicate with ourselves, with all the 
different peoples and nations of the Earth. We go on behaving as if we 
believe there is very little wrong, if anything, with ourselve. We refuse to 
face the fact that we have already virtually desstroyed ourselves as humane 
beings, and if we recognize any destruction at all, it is that of our 
environement. We must recognize that we are suffering from a sickeness even 
though it has been repeatedly denied; nevertheless it is, from my point of 
view as a student of human nature, a fact that most people are no longer 
humane beings, but sick persons - a sickness induced by the worship of false 
values which have corrupted the spirit of man and made him the most dangerous 
creature on this Earth. Unless he cures himself of this sickness, can one 
reasonably expect such a creature to behave in a healthy manner? What one 
can expect him to do is to behave destructively, and a good deal of the time 
to be unaware of the fact that he is doing so.

Hence, to the question, "How might human beings react to the discovery of 
life beyond Earth?" I would answer: "Don't wait until that life is 
discovered, but prepare yourselves for the discovery by becoming what you 
ought to be, by realizing your evolutionary destiny, which is to live as to 
live and love were one." And what is love? It is the ability to confer 
survival benefits in a creatively enlarging manner upon the other. And what 
is health? It is the ability to love, to work, and to play. If we will 
begin on such a a program of rehabilitation, we may be able to respond to 
the discovery of life beyon Earth in an enhancing manner. 

We have landed on the Moon. It might not be such a bad idea if we tried 
landing on Earth. When asked by a European inquirer what he thought of 
Western civilization, Gandhi paused awhile, and wrly smiling, replied, "I 
don't think it would be such a bad idea."



                        QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR



QUESTION:

Communications between ourselves and other civilizations can be considered 
in general in two basic categories. One is a sort of passive communication 
in which we receive information from other beings; we must sit there and 
compile it and perhaps eventually sort it out. And the other is an active 
communication, in which we ourselves can try sending signals. And as far as 
the active part is concerned, the first step outght to be to construct some 
sort of signal that would be identifiable as to the fact that we were 
intelligent beings. But beyond that, as Carl Sagan said, these people are a 
lot more intelligent than we are. The next step would be to send out one 
piece of information that would characterize our society. Since they are 
probably more intelligent or advanced than we, deep consideration should be 
given to just precisely what piece of information should be sent out, 
because the wrong characterization of our society, or the wrong 
interpretartion of it, could be quite damaging in the long run.

SAGAN:

I do not think it is quite as urgent to send as to receive, which may be a 
paraphrase of a Biblical passage. Also, I again would want to stress that, 
willy-nilly, we have been sending, so your remarks are most properly directed 
to the FCC. The image of our society, which is garnered at some place 30 
light years out, is the image you get by turning on the lat-night tube. So if 
you are worried about sending out the wrong message, you have every reason to 
be worried.

BERENDZEN:

Let me mention something that I would hate to pass without adequate 
discussion. Is it possible that if we detected a signal from space, it would 
have the dramatic, beneficial effect on mankind to bringing us together?

SAGAN:

Well, I alluded to that before. I think chances of that happening are very 
great, because as soon as it is clear that there is somebody else out there 
and they are smarter than us and they are different from us, then the 
differences between the various slight subsets of mankind which people are 
spending a lot of time worrying about -- those differences I think tend to...

MONTAGU:

Look, we have had someone out there for an awfully long time, whom Dr. 
Stendahl calls "God." I take it he is referring to the Christian God. As an 
antrhoplogist I am aquainted with several hundred gods. And this God is 
supposed to be all wise and all-loving, etc. We seem to have learned very 
little from Him. Why should our communication with extraterrestrial beings 
have a more cohesive effect that the concepts of the Catholic CHurch, for 
example?

SAGAN:

It is a good question. There are many possible long answers, but maybe the 
fastest answer I can give is that there may be some room for doubt about the 
reality of the several hundred gods you were talking about, but once the 
message is received, I think there will be very little room for doubt about 
the reality of the message.

MONTAGU:

But I do not doubt the existence of any of these hundreds of Gods! I believe 
anything you believe to be real is as real as it could possibly be, even 
though it's unreal.

SAGAN:

That's why you have such an exemplary moral character!

--------

QUESTION:

I would like to direct a question to Carl Sagan. Professor Wald has raised 
the issue of the control of technology. Now the conference that took place in 
Soviet Armenia was a mutual conference between two great powers. Professor 
Morrison has raised the possibility that a tremendous corpus of knowledge can 
come wafting down from outer space. Suppose that this comes into an American 
facility in Puerto Rico, technology that would enable us to dominate this 
world. Suppose it comes into a Soviet facility in Armenia. What exactly would 
be the international body that would monitor these signals from outer space, 
assuming that this civilization that we would be communicatin with is more 
advanced and would be giving us tremendous technological knowledge? What is 
to guarantee that one of the existing nation-states does not monitor it and 
use it as we have used our technology in the past?

SAGAN:

Very good question. Fortunately, I think it has a quick answer. The answer 
has to do with time scale and beamwidth. As Phil Morrison stressed, and he 
*must* be right, the time scale to learn a new technology from such a message 
must be long - decades perhaps. No ine is going to say, "Put tab A into slot 
B." You want to think a little before you do that. You do not say, "Oh, yess, 
sir; right in." You want to understand what is happening first. So things 
will move slowly if there is a new technology involved. That is the first 
part of the answer.

The second part is that the Earth is tiny compared to the size of the beam. 
Therefore, all of the Earth -- not just Armenia and Puerto Rico -- but also 
the Netherlands and Australia and Ghana and all the other countries are going 
to be able to pick up the same message. Therefore it makes no sense at all 
for one nation to classify the message. It is like classifying the Sun. It 
makes no sense., YOu can do it if you want, but it does not help.


--------

QUESTION:

The assumption is that these messages are now passing through othe solar 
system. We have to assume that we are just not receiving them now. If you 
know that if you are the first country to discover this body of knoweldge, 
you'll have a major advantage, then might not...

SAGAN:

The you have to imagine a scenario in which there is a large, secret radio 
telescope that is working for a century on a given problem and word never 
leaks out. I myself find that difficult to believe, esp[ecially since the 
total number of radio astronomers in the world is extremely small, and all of 
them know each other. Also, I believe that the community of scientists on 
this issue is such that it is impossible for such a discovery to be made 
without it being known on an international scale.

WALD:

Once again, all the nations will be listening in equally, provided they have 
equally big radio telescopes. So we will have a radio-telescope race, and God 
help the nation that has a somewhat smaller radio telescoper that the others. 
As for the community of world science, this is the firt time I have heard 
that it covers weapons technology.

SAGAN:

We are not talking about weapons technology.

WALD:

But this can be converted into weapons technology.

SAGAN:

Sure, but it starts out by saying, "A,B,C,D...." Do you say, "Let's classify 
the alphabet and maybe the next thing that comes in will be how to build a 
better weapon"? I just cannot see it.

WALD:

But that is the way nuclear energy appeared. One did not know what to do with 
it or how to handle it, so a few nations with the technical facilities and 
the wealth got themselves atom bombs.

---------

QUESTION:

The assumptian has been up to now that any message received will be via some 
electromagnetic wavelength. It would seem to me that this is a very naive 
assumption to make in view of the fact that the senders, as has been stated 
repeatedly, will be far more intelligent that us, and may have access to 
means of which we are completely unware.

BERENDZEN:

Excellent point. Phil, you have given much  though to this. Would you 
respond?

MORRISON:

If the thousand-megacycle bands of radio are not the best ones, even though 
they are easily accessible, then there is no question about it, we will find 
nothing from this search. The only trouble with that kind of argument is that 
it could be put forward at any time, no matter what technology is presently 
available. You can always say there is something we do not know that 10 years 
from now will be much better understood. Therefore I think if you say this, 
your inaction is guaranteed; then you surely will never make the search.

And it can be the other way around. When it turns out after sober thought 
that you find yourself easily able to listen by some means that looks 
plausible, that will in fact carry the message, then try it. I believe there 
is a society of these groups, not just one. There are probably very many. If 
there were only one, we would likely have no hope of finding it. But there 
are probably thousands, maybe as many as million. They probably have already 
had much experience at finding new civilizations and bringing them into the 
network. If so, they will understand that they should not start with the most 
advanced device; if you want to make friends with some new group smewher, you 
do not set up color TV stations. You might wave a flag or beat a drum. You 
know you have access to those channels.

SAGAN:

I would look at it like this. Suppose that we were a tribe in some isolated 
valley in, say, New Guinea, where we communicate with our neighbors over in 
the next valley by runner and by drum. And we are asked to imagine an 
advanced civilization thousands of miles away. How would they communicate? I 
would say, "Oh, probably by very fast runners or enormous drums that beat 
very loud." In fact, there is a vast international radio and cable traffic 
going around such people, and over them, and through them, and they would not 
know about it. But that radio and cable traffic is not intended to talk to 
the inhabitants of that isolated valley. It is intended for coversation 
between technologically more sophisticated beings. If we wanted to talk to 
them, then we would need to use the technology of the local civilization.

And I would imagine that if an advanced civilization wanted to talk to us, 
they would say, "Those guys must be extremely backward. Let's go to some 
ancient museum and pull out ... what do you call it?... one of those radio 
telescops, and beam it at them." But meanwhile they would use for their own 
purposes whatever it is they use -- gravity wavers, or neutrinos, or 
tachyons, or whatever is the fast, high-informational channel.

---------

QUESTION:

Do you think it is more likely that the message we will intercept will be 
going back and forth between two members of a soceity or will it be an 
exploratory one, aimed just as us?

MORRISON:

If we get the message at all, it is not likely to be just a chance beam that 
crosses us -- that is very unlikely.

---------

QUESTION:

But it will have a wide beamwidth, as was pointed out.

MORRISON:

If it is a wide beam, then the beam would be include probably just exactly 
these search channels we are talking about. If it is not that, it will be 
very hard to find a message that has not been designed to be easy to read. If 
it is just high-speed chatter on some frequency we cannot use, I do not know 
if we are ever going to find it.

SAGAN:

Wide beam compared to the size of the Earth but narrow beam compared to how 
many stars you are going to pick up.
