                     6 SOLDIERS HERE TO KILL ANTICHRIST

Six soldiers who were arrested in Gulf Breeze last weekend and accused of
desertion were in the area to destroy the Antichrist, according to today's
edition of the European Stars and Stripes.
The six, who were assigned to the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade in
Augsburg, West Germany, left their unit less than two weeks ago to locate the
Biblical figure who many Christians believe will challenge Jesus Christ's
second coming and spread universal evil, the military newspaper said.
Stars and Stripes also confirmed a report that the six were members of a
little known cult," The End of the World. " Although Army spokesmen in the
pentagon said they had never heard of the cult, it is known to soldiers in
West Germany, Stars and Stripes reported.
The newspaper on Wednesday provided information from its story to the
Pensacola News Journal.
Stars and Stripes also reported the six gave away possessions to friends,
including a $ 3,000.00 stereo system that belonged to Perlock, before they
left. They also burned their records and books behind their barracks, the
newspaper reported.
Other soldiers who are members of End of the World were unhappy that they did
not get to come to Pensacola to help destroy the Antichrist, Stars and
Stripes stated.
The term " End of the World " was written on doodles found in the room of one
of the soldiers in Germany, said Maj. Joe Padilla, a spokesman at the
Pentagon. He said he didn't know why they left Germany or anything about
their religious beliefs.
The soldiers had been sought since July 9 after they were discovered missing
from West Germany, Robert Hall, an Army spokesman said Tuesday. Authorities
don't know how they got to the United States.
The soldiers were arrested after Pfc. Michael Hueckstaedt, 19, of Farson Wyo.
had no drivers license, and warrants showed he was wanted for desertion from
the Army, Gulf Breeze Police Chief Jerry Brown said. 
After officers called security police from Pensacola Naval Station to pick up
Hueckstaedt, the Navy called back to say he was traveling with five other
soldiers wanted for desertion or being absent without leave, Brown said.
Police learned the five suspects might be at the home of Anna Foster in Gulf
Breeze. Officers arrested the four men Saturday.
Arrested were: Pfc. Kris Perlock, 20. of Oseola, Wis.; Spec. 4 Kenneth
Beason, 26 of Jefferson City, Tenn.; Pfc. William Setterberg, 20, of
Pittsburgh; and Spec. 4 Vance Davis, 25 of Valley Center, Kan.
Foster apparently had befriended one of the men when he took courses in
cryptology -coding and decoding-at Corry Station in Pensacola. Foster has not
been charged and is believed to be involved only because she knew one of the
men, police said.
Police learned at Foster's home that the woman, Sgt. Annette Eccleston, 22,
of Connecticut, hometown unavailable, was staying in a campground near Fort
Pickens. She was arrested there.
On Wednesday, Foster said she had been " advised not to make any comment
until the investigation is over."
"I don't know what to do. I know it's all real crazy right now. I feel very
caught up in this. I was just being a nice person when I opened my house to a
friend and his friends, " Foster said.
The soldiers are in the stockade at Fort Benning, Columbus, GA. where they
are being questioned by the Army, the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security
Agency, an Army spokesman said.
One of the six also told a Morristown, Tenn., man on July 7 that he was
coming to Pensacola for the " Rapture, " a belief by some fundamentalists
that all Christians will be taken to heaven seven years before the end of the
world.
All six of the soldiers held top-secret security clearances and were
intelligence analysts assigned to intercepting, identifying and exploiting
foreign communications, Padilla said.
The six have not yet been charged, but Padilla said he doubted they would
return to their unit in Germany. He said they are accused of being absent
without authorization which could lead to formal charges of being absent
without leave or desertion.
When he was told of the Stars and Stripes report Wednesday, Brown said. " I
don't believe that. Who is the Antichrist?"
If the cult had talked about destroying the Antichrist, that person should
have a name, he said.
Beason, who bought the van on July 7, was described Wednesday as gullible by
a friend who picked him up July 6 at McGee-Tyson Airport in Knoxville.
" He was a very nice fellow but very gullible. He was one of these people who
believed anything someone would tell him." Stan Johnson said.
" The idea that he was arrested, or that he was hanging around with a
cult-like group didn't surprise me. He kind of lives in a science fiction
fantasy world sometimes."
Johnson said he thinks he first met Beason in 1987 when Beason got out of the
Army. Beason, he said, would hang around his Morristown photography business
which specializes in advertising and industrial photography.
Johnson said Beason talked very little about his work, but was very clearly
interested in science, science fiction and unidentified flying objects.
Johnson said Beason called him several weeks before he left West Germany to
ask him to pick him up at the airport and look for a vehicle for him. Beason
said he wanted a van, station wagon, or a big car that several people could
ride in, Johnson said.
When Beason arrived in Knoxville, Hueckstaedt was with him, Johnson said.
" I was under the impression they were on leave and they were going to
Pensacola to meet some friends," Johnson said.
But Beason's interest in the Rapture and UFOs went beyond fake photos and
writing, Johnson said.
" A couple of years ago before he went back into the Army there was a book
floating around the area predicting the end of the world. He really believed
that, " Johnson said.
" He did mention...about going to Pensacola for a UFO convention."
Officials with the Mutual UFO Network, which held its 21st annual symposium
in Pensacola July 6-8 could not say whether Beason or Huechstaedt attended
any of the symposium sessions.
Brown, however, discounted the possibility saying that Beason did not arrive
in the area until July 9.
