  The information to Follow was handed to me by the Director of The NEW
  Project Blue Book, Mr. William Pitts.

Office of the Director:
William Pitts
506 North 2nd Street
Fort Smith, AR 72901
(501)-782-7077

  Inspired, and name-approved, by the United States Air Force.

   TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

The enclosed News-media release is  to announce a new association
of an old project, and which has been officially name-approved by
the United States Air Force.

The release gives certain basic information, but  should you desire
additional information, please do not hesitate to get in touch with
this office.  Naturally,  we are anxious to get the information to
as many as possible, and as soon as possible, because some of those
persons actively involved in UFO signting reports, or who made reports
themselves, are reaching advanced ages - and it is our wish to get
in touch with them as soon as we can.

For your further information, the new Project Blue Book, and those
associated with it, are sworn to uphold any secret, or sensitive,
information, which comes to our attention in the search for the UFO
information, and to with-hold any information which could be
considered to be detrimental to the security of our country.

Therefore, any source may feel free to offer information to this
office, and know that the information will be confidential, and the
reporter - anonymous.  Such information would be utilized only to
the extent of helping to solve a sighting report.

The new Project Blue Book is not an Air Force-funded agency, but is,
by design, a civilian agency - of former military personnel.

Please feel free to contact the Director, at the above address, or
phone, for interviews or additional information.

Sincerely,

PROJECT BLUE BOOK

Bill Pitts,
Director


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

    PROJECT BLUE BOOK, The United States Air Force Investigative Arm for
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's), has been reorganized as a civilian
research and investigative association, comprised of (but not limited to),
present and former, Air Force and other U.S. government agency personnel.
The New Project Blue Book, officially name-approved by the United States
Air Force, will study future UFO sighting reports, but devote further in-
depth studies of the older, classic, sighting reports from the Mid-1940's
through the 1960's.

    The original Project Blue Book closed its doors in 1969, but many of the
investigators of the  earlier reports found that the most important cases were
then, and still are to this date, listed as "Unidentified."  While some possi-
ble answers were made on many reports at the time, most "answers" did not fit
the actual reported sightings, and were later proven not to be the objects
reported by reputable persons, including those  persons who were in high-level
government positions when they made the reports.  The "Answers" did not fit
the reports.

    The New Project Blue Book will be directed by industrialist Bill Pitts,
a veteran investigator for all civilian UFO organizations and various govern-
ment agencies.  A high-level research team will re-evaluate the older reports
and endeavor to determine whether the objects reported have been solid
metallic-like structure and could be extra-terrestrial. An hypothesis long
considered as the predominate answer.

    In a statement released to the media, Pitts said: "We will be seeking
first-hand information, and materials, from individuals personally involved
in the earlier saucer-era sighting reports, and will greatly appreciate re-
ceiving from any such person,  or members of the immediate family, any copies
of  government-agency correspondence, sighting reports, photo's and movies,
(ESPECIALLY ON PLANE-GUN CAMERAS, IF AVAILABLE)."

    Also, FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE, OR PROOF, OF ANY ALLEGED UFO "CRASH RETRIEVAL"
SITUATION WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  Any such information that is received will be
handled in strict confidentiality, and persons sending such materials will
remain anonymous, and all materials will be returned in their entirety.  Any
person who may have been under "GAG-Restrictions" of the past, should come
forward immediately, while they are still able to do so to assist us in this
investigative endeavor of the world-wide phenomenon, Pitts said.

    Headquarters for the new Project Blue Book, will be at Pitts' office,
506 North 2nd Street, Fort Smith, Arkansas 72901.  It is this address, which
is centrally located in the United States, to which all materials should be
sent.

End of Doc..

I gave Bill a tour of Paranet Tau (in person) and a view of ParaNet Alpha
from remote.  He was impressed with our communications link and the Massive
Library of Paranet Alpha.  Bill considered the potential of ParaNet's ability
to convey information both from and to the public, and has decided to make
PARANET his Computer Link information system.

After speaking with Bill Pitts (Director of the New Project Blue Book)
for a short time he informed me that ParaNet Tau would be his Link with the
ParaNet systems.  Being administrator of ParaNet Tau I will report on the
information and facts given me by Bill Pitts and upload them directly to the
ParaNet Director & Administrator Jim Speiser at ParaNet Alpha for distribution
among the other ParaNet systems.

I gave Bill a copy of the ParaNet files directory as well as printouts of
several of the text files.  I expect to be hearing from him whenever he
receives any news concerning UFO sightings, I also expect to hear from him
concerning sightings reported through ParaNet.

Bill informed me that he is interested in UFO sightings but will be careful
in his investigations of UFO reports.  I will not quote his words here con-
cerning a subject that is all ready sensational and highly controversial, I
will say that I think they picked a good man for the job of Director of the
New Project Blue Book, and I look forward to working with him in the future.
