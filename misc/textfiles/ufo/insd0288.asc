INSIDE UFOLOGY
February 1988
--------------

There  already  seems  to be some controversy surrounding the series of UFO 
sightings  reported  in  Gulf  Breezes,  Florida.  In that case, a building 
contractor  claims to have taken as many as 16 Polaroid photos and one Beta 
videotape  of an object hovering near his home, not far from Pensacola. The 
sightings  started  around  the  middle of last November, and were exciting 
enough  to MUFON State Director Donald Ware that he immediately called Walt 
Andrus,  MUFON's  Grand  Poobah,  in  Texas  and said, "You better get over 
here."  He did get over there, and was duly impressed by what he saw. "Very 
high quality stuff," was Andrus' reaction. 

Budd  Hopkins  has  reportedly  just  returned from Florida, where he, too, 
viewed  the  evidence,  and  he,  too, was very excited. And so was MUFON's 
Director  of  Investigations,  Dan  Wright. "This stuff puts Billy Meier to 
shame," seems to be the general reaction. 

But  the  comparisons  with Meier are more than just casual. For one thing, 
despite  repeated  appearances  by  the  object,  no  other  witnesses have 
stepped  forward,  although word has it that several ANONYMOUS witnesses do 
exist.  For  another,  its  amazing  how lucky one man can be, to be in the 
right  place  at  the right time, several times running, to knock off a few 
good  UFO  pictures,  when the rest of us slobs go entire lifetimes without 
even  seeing  a  strange light in the sky. And its been our experience that 
cases that seem too good to be true, always are.

Further,  its  reported that NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has given the 
videotape  a  cursory  examination,  and considers it a probable fraud. But 
the  examination  did not make use of JPL's sophisticated computer analysis 
facilities;  rather,  it  was  one man's opinion based on an eyeball of the 
video.

Its  entirely  possible  that we finally have definitive photographic proof 
that  alien  spacecraft are operating in our atmosphere, and only time, and 
widespread  distribution  of the video, will tell at this point. Certainly, 
judging  by  the  animated reaction of the normally stoic Wright, something 
worth  looking  into  has  occurred,  and  its  guaranteed to be one of the 
classics  of  the  field.  We don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but we  
counsel equal doses of caution and enthusiasm.

Speaking  of  JPL,  those  three letters seem to be coming up more and more 
often  these  days.  In  addition  to the above analysis, at least two high 
priests  of  that  high-tech  temple  of  Empiricism have held forth on the 
Brewster  video  of the Hudson Valley Object, one pronouncing it an unknown 
and  the  other  putting  the  lie  to  the  "planes  in formation" theory. 
Abduction  expert  Tracy  Torme' visited the lab a while back (in the guise 
of  the  new  Executive  Story Editor for Star Trek), and managed to elicit 
curiosity  in UFOs from some of the lab technicians and scientists. And Dr. 
Lew  Allen,  the  lab's  director,  has  been mentioned as a possible MJ-12 
member.  Recall  that  JPL  is  the West Coast outpost of mega-skeptic Carl 
Sagan....I'll bet they have some DANDY conversations there....

An  extremely reliable ParaNet source has uncovered confirmation, of sorts, 
that  a  group  calling  itself Justice for Military Personnel did exist as 
recently  as  1975/76.  It  was  apparently  a paralegal organization which 
specialized  in  providing  legal  assistance  to  military types and their 
families.  Our  source  tells  us that one of their assignments was to help 
cut  through  some  red tape at Bentwaters AFB in England, site of a famous 
UFO landing. (See JMP.UFO, Library Section 1).

AND FINALLY...

Allen   Benz,  president  of  the  Foundation  for  UFO  Research,  on  the 
cancellation of that group's highly touted banquet in Tucson:

      "Oh, well, no use crying over crashed saucers...."
