					By S. McElheney



	With all of the millions of stars and galaxies in our universe, any 
rational person would agree that we could not be the only intelligent
life. The chances of life occurring elsewhere in the universe on a planet 
like ours are very high, and that the civilizations could have begun 
millions of years before ours is  another good possibility. And if these 
alien civilizations were much more advanced than ours, it is a good 
possibility that they
would be capable of interstellar space flight and perhaps even
visit worlds alien to theirs, namely Earth. To try and prove the
existence of unidentified flying objects is not a very difficult
task, there are thousands of reports and the evidence is there,
its just sorting through it all and coming up with the most
believable and best documentented. I will attempt to use the
evidence that I have collected to prove that UFOs exist; I'll
also talk about government involvement, alien abductions, and
some documented history of UFOs.

	Many UFO researchers--or ufologists--believe that aliens have
been making routine visits to our planet for millions of years.
Hieroglyphics in Egypt and rock paintings in Australia portray
alien beings descending from the sky. Some ufologists say that
the most impressive UFO stories are found in the Bible. The most
elaborate of the Bible's possible UFO sightings comes from the
prophet Ezekiel, a priest in one of Babylon's captive Jewish
settlements. When he was thirty years old, in about 593B.C., he
had a vision:

	"As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a
	great cloud, with brightness round about it, and fire flashing
	forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were
	gleaming bronze. And from the midst of it came the likeness of
	four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had
	the form of men, but each had four faces, and each of them had
	four wings." (Time-Life, 12-14) 

	Ezekiel interpreted this sight, which is all at the opening of
the old Testament, as "the likeness of the glory of the Lord." 
But some researchers said it was "the arrival of an
extraterrestrial spaceship" (Time-Life, 14). 

	Josef F. Blumrich, an engineer at NASA, who helped build the
Saturn V rocket, was convinced that Ezekiel's description would
fail under a rocket engineer's rigorous examination. However, he
found that the description could be adapted into a practical
design for a landing module launched from a mother ship.

	The date of the earliest UFO sightings is unknown.
Some UFO researchers believe that there were UFO sightings in
ancient times...  Most UFO researchers date the beginning of
the UFO phenomenon with the sighting of dirigible-like
"mystery airships" over the U.S. during 1896-97. The next
significant group of reports came during World War II from
Allied and Axis pilots who reported seeing strange metal-like objects, 
which they called "foo fighters," in controlled flight around their  
planes. In 1946 people in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, reported
large-scale sightings of silent "ghost rockets." None of 
these phenomena has been satisfactorily explained. (Jacobs, 1)

	At 3pm on Tuesday June 24, 1947 in the state of Washington, the
modern UFO phenomenon began. 32 year old private pilot, Kenneth
Arnold of Boise, Idaho spotted the strong sunlight reflecting
off of something far in the distance. When he got in closer to
investigate, Arnold saw nine flat-ended, cresent-shaped discs
flying in a formation not unlike that of a flock of geese. He
described their movements as being like "saucers skipping over
water" and thus, the term flying saucer was born. He later told
American radio journalist, Ed Murrow in 1950, that he "judged
their [flying saucers] wing-span to be at least 100ft across"
and that they were moving at over 1000mph. In 1950, that
out-flew anything that could be man made.                                                                               

	On July 6, 1947 one of the most famous UFO crashes and
government cover-ups occurred. In Roswell, New Mexico, a large
glowing disc was seen over the desert.  A sheep rancher who
heard an explosion went out the next day to investigate and
found strange wreckage. That was the sight were the UFO
allegedly crashed the first time, it left some pieces behind and
started out again. 150 miles away, in Magdalene, a man named
Barnett saw something shiny in the sand. He found the wreckage
of a disc that was 30 feet across. He had not heard about any of
the other sightings of the UFO that night. He thought that it
might be some type of experimental aircraft but,:                       

	"Barnett did not believe that this was so. He had good reason.
	He had seen bodies--apparently dead and thrown from the wreck.
	They were not wearing army uniforms. In fact they did not look
	human. From a distance, it was hard to see in detail, but they
	seemed to be wearing silvery suits, and they were only 1 meter
	(3 feet) tall!" (Randles, 18-19). 

	The debris from the crash was said to be remarkably light, yet
exceptionally tough, metallic in appearance but different from
any known metal and covered partially by pictorial markings not
unlike hieroglyphics. Many "...witnesses also spoke of an
undentable thin foil that, after folding, returned to its
original shape with no crease mark." (Clark, 92).

The government quickly took all the evidence they could move to
the Roswell Air Force base and made everyone involved swear to
secrecy. An official at the base originally and accidentally,
leaked to local radio and news stations that a UFO had crashed
but a few days later the report was denied by the government and
said it was only a crashed weather balloon. News of the crash
never really made it out of New Mexico.

	"It was definately not a weather or tracking device, nor was it 
	any sort of plane or missile... It was something I had never seen 
	before, or since... it certainly wasn't anything built
	by us."                                         
	  (Extract from an interview about the Roswell crash given in
	1979 by the intelligence officer who was first on the scene in      
	1947, then Major Jesse Marcel). (Randles, 20).



	"...the Air Force knew by the middle of July 1947 that the
	saucers were real and not man made... the technology  represented by 
	the (recovered) disc... was so far beyond our  own that it could not 
	be understood  immediately... Therefore it would be necessary to treat 
	the disc as a military secret. This would  mean containing all 
	information about it within one small group."       
	(Part of paper by US Navy Physicist, Dr. Bruce Maccabee.)
	(Randles, 22).

	In 1948, the U.S. Air Force started Project Blue Book. It lasted
from 1948 to 1969 and its purpose was to investigate UFO
reports. Witnesses received an eight-page questionnaire, the
photographs and negatives were analyzed, and field interviews
were conducted. The project, on the whole, successfully weeded
out UFO reports that were obvious hoaxes or could be explained
by natural phenomenon. However, the group operated under an
undisguised bias that UFOs did not exist. So, for the small
percentage of cases that could not be solved, investigators
would either admit they failed in indentifying the object or
embrace any remotely feasible explanation. In 1976, edited
versions of most of Project Blue Book's files were released
under the 'Freedom of Information' Act.

	The following cases are some of the most curious pieces of
evidence of alien life. Each of these cases are still under
investigation:

	The Kecksburg "Acorn"

	At 4:15pm on December 9, 1965, thousands of people in several
	Midwestern and Eastern states observed the passage of a glowing
	object whose long smoke trail remained visible 
	for as long as 20 minutes after the object itself was gone.
	Investigators who later tracked its trajectory concluded that
	the object had been moving slightly faster than 1,000 miles per 
	hour (meteors travel at a minimum of 27,000 mph) in a
	southeasterly direction from Flint, Michigan, to the Cleveland
	area, where it made a 25' turn and headed 
	east. Outside Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, a number of local people
	observed the object descend in a smooth and controlled fashion.         
	Those who ventured into the woods in the evening darkness,
	according to reports, discovered a large gold, acorn-shaped
	object that emitted a strange blue light. In a band along side
	of the object was hieroglyphiclike writing. Soon, as members of
	the Aerospace Defense Command's 662nd Radar Squadron appeared on
	the scene, civilians were ordered to leave the area. Later,
	Kecksburg residents reported an Army flatbed truck carrying
	something covered with a tarpaulin; its shape was that of a
	giant upright acorn. The official explanation of the Kecksburg
	object is "meteorite," although no such object has ever been
	produced and none of the eyewitness testimony supports that
	particular interpretation...



	Disc in the Desert

	In the Seventies, veteran UFO researcher Raymond Fowler
	investigated the case of the pseudonymous "Fritz Werner," an
	engineer who served at Wright-Patterson Air Force base and later
	at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. In an adfidavit Werner
	swore that on May 21, 1953, he and others were driven to nearby
	Indian Springs Air Force Base, but on a bus with blackened
	windows, and informed that they were to participate in the
	recovery of a "supersecret Air Force vehicle." After four hours
	they were let out in what Werner surmised was the Kingman,
	Arizona, area. They were shown an oval object that "looked like
	two deep saucers, one inverted upon another," about 30 feet in
	diameter. His particular job, he asserted, was to determine how
	fast the craft had been traveling when it hit the sand. At one
	point, Werner claimed, he happened to look into a tent at the
	site; there he saw the "dead body of a four-foot, humanlike
	creature in a silver, metallic-looking suit." As he was leaving
	he talked briefly with an airman who said that he had seen the
	interior of the craft, where there were "two swivellike seats as
	well as instruments and displays."
	All participants were sworn to secrecy. Another investigator,
	Leonard Stringfield. interviewed as former Air Force
	metallurgist who claimed that in the spring of 1953 he had been
	flown blindfolded to a "hot and sandy area" to participate in
	the recovery of a vehicle much like the one Werner described.
	(Clark, 93)

	Bruce Maccabee believes that  the government is covering up the
existence of UFOs, covering up that it really doesn't know
what's going on, and covering up that it doesn't know what to do
about it, namely what would happen if it went public with all
this. 

	Government agencies still have hundreds of UFO documents that
they refused to release after the Freedom of Information Act
made them release most of the files. The National Security
Agency (NSA) admits it has withheld more than 100 UFO related
documents, the CIA still has about 50 and the DIA (Defense
Intelligence Agency) says it's withholding six.

	UFOs  have been investigated by every major
government on earth, and are still being studied at the official
level in China, France, Spain, the USSR, the USA, and the United
Kingdom - to name but six leading nations. If UFOs were 'bunk',
or of no great importance, do you really think every leading
power and super power would make the same crass error and submit
to this absurdity?

	"Yet... these nations (except one or two who are
	refreshingly open) play a dangerous game of double bluff. Their
	records and actions speak for themselves."   (Randles, 8)

	Recently, Belgium's military has begun to work together with
private groups to track UFOs and it has been called the most
coordinated UFO investigation to date.  On November 8, 1989,
hundreds of people in two Belgian towns--Eupen and
Wavre--reported seeing a dark grey deltoid shape, with one white
light on each tip, gliding across the night sky. The unknown
object, with a wingspan of 50 to 100 meters, was apparently
silent and no one reported seeing it land.

	By March, 1990, everyone from farmers to teenagers to
high-ranking military officers and professors claimed to have
seen the UFO. On March 30th, controllers at a radar station in
Glons detected a foreign object on their screens. They confirmed
the slow moving blip with another station in Ghent.

	    "At this point it had become a scientific problem
	deserving serious investigation," says Professor Leon Brenig, a
	physicist at the Free University of Brussels. "It couldn't be
	steel coming back into the atmosphere because the edges were
	smooth, not bent. It couldn't be a NATO aircraft because its
	capacity for flight seemed to outreach current technology. I
	decided it was worth my time." (Livermore, 75)

	Belgium's military contributed two F-16's, an expert crew, and
instruments to hunt later that spring. When a watch group
spotted something, they alerted the F-16's, which were equipped
with infrared cameras to photograph the giant triangle. The
pilots couldn't get photographs because of the deltoid's  great
speed. 

	Engineers and physicists are analyzing radar images of the UFO.
UFO photos are being analyzed by computer at Ecole Royale
Militaire, the air force training school. Also, botanists are
examining burn patterns in the fields where the triangle was
reportedly seen.

	Aliens have also been accused of abducting people and inserting
BB-sized implants into them. Abductee's stories are generally
hard to prove and there is almost no evidence of alien
abduction, except for occasional odd burn marks, and the
people's descriptions, which tend to match up when they are
closely reviewed by researchers. Many abductees describe the
same scenery inside the UFO ships and the same aliens. 

	According to UFO abduction expert, Budd Hopkins,
	...a number of radiologists are privately doing MRI scans
	(magnetic resonance imaging)  on people who claim they have been
	abducted by aliens--and that the aliens have inserted devices in
	their bodies or brains. But a neurosurgeon advised... that if,
	as claimed, implants exist somewhere above the upper nasal
	passages, then they are near the optic nerve. In that case, he
	says, "it would be very risky for a surgeon to try and get one
	out." What does Hopkins say about the prospect of actually
	validating these weird alien implants? "It'd have a devastating
	societal impact," he says, "I am not looking forward to
	something like this." (McCarthy, 81)

	The amount of information I found on all topics having to do
with UFOs is overwhelming, to fully research, compile and
document all the information would have called for me writing an
entire book of my own. To fully get everything out of this
subject, I suggest that you, the reader, look into the books and
articles I have on the works cited sheet, so that you may
discover what has been going on in our skies for millions of
years. The UFOs are here, that much, I have no question about,
because I and others have seen a UFO with our own eyes and that
is enough to convince me. The evidence is there, its just a
matter of finding it all. The   government seems to be involved
with covering up most UFO crashes and sightings, saying that the
UFO was really something else or it was never there in the first
place. But why would the world governments spend so much time
and money investigating UFOs if they didn't exist?                                                                       

	They would be wasting their energy. Therefore, I must conclude
that they are investigating something.  The thousands of pages
of UFO documents generated by the CIA, FBI, Air Force, State
Department, and other government agencies, which were released
under the Freedom of Information Act, wouldn't be there if no
one were interested and the government thought UFOs did not
exist. There is something out there worth investigating.
