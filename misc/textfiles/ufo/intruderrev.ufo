It's late in the evening when a sudden and bizarre compulsion comes over
you to get some junk food at the local fast service establishment.  Donning
attire sufficient to make you presentable at the local Seven-Eleven you
slip into your auto and begin your trek to satiate your hunger.  And trek
it becomes!  Not two miles from you home, along a dark segment of the
roadway you spot strange lights in the sky - headed on a direct intercept
path with your car.  Your engine dies and the car glides to a halt.  Mist
surrounds the car but you can dimly see some movement as a short form
approaches.  Then you see it.  A non-human creature with large "compelling"
eyes, huge head and little or no mouth gestures in your direction.  You
attempt to scream but try as you might you cannot summon any movement from
your own body.  You are somehow extracted from the car and teleported into
the hovering craft....

And so begins a typical scenario reported in the best-selling book by
author/artist Budd Hopkins.  If you are into fantasy and science fiction
then this book is NOT for you.  Yes, I said NOT as Budd Hopkins is relating
an account of a life experience.  An experience very real to Kathy Davis,
the subject of his work "Intruders."

"Intruders" reports one bizarre account after another of the intrusion of
intelligent alien beings into the life of Kathy Davis.  Her case began in
early childhood and continues into the future of herself and her children. 
Even, it seems, to a child which is a hybrid between herself and the
alien beings. Only recently made aware of the experiences through the aid
of hypnotic regression, Kathy's story is perhaps one of the best documented
case events of this type.  These happenings were first seriously reported
in the mid/late sixties by John G. Fuller in "The Interrupted Journey" and
most recently by Whitley Strieber in "Communion."  Hopkins' new work
contributes much to the investigative reputation of the whole Abduction
Phenomenon. While Mr. Hopkin's literary style is not as polished and
refined as that of Whitley Strieber, this work is the first of its kind to
couple good investigative reporting technique with a sense of drama
that keeps the book in your hands and your eyes on its pages until it is
consumed.  "Intruders" will intrude on your imagination and have you
looking over your shoulder any time you find yourself alone ... and in the
dark.  "Intruders" will both scare you and infuriate you as you consider
the possibilities of a race of creatures taking liberties with humans not
seen since the days of Hitler.

Intruders.  Get it.  Read it.  But be don't be surprised if you find that
this book conjures up strange and elusive memories.  You wouldn't be the
first to have this book awaken memories, here-to-fore hidden from your
conscious mind, of a night of terror.
