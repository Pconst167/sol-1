Old  Nick and the inhabitants of UFOs have a lot in common -  although 
there  is  no objective proof for the existence of  either,  both  can 
claim  millions  of fervent believers. These  believers  credit  their 
chosen  belief-object  with amazing powers, and a desire to  rule  the 
world by covert means.

There is little cross-over between the two belief systems. Practically 
all  Christians ignore the UFO phenomenon - they're not in  the  Bible 
and  they are obviously demonic manifestations, anyway; UFO  nuts  are 
interested  only in "hard"-science explanations - what  does  religion 
have  to do with technology-advanced space beings? There is no  mutual 
interest,  and the two camps refuse to even acknowledge  one  anothers 
existence.

Yet  there  is  much common ground. Take for instance  the  US  cattle 
mutilations mystery, where cattle in the American Southwest are  found 
mysteriously  dead,  with holes drilled in the bodies  and  blood  and 
organs apparently missing. Significantly, there may be no human tracks 
about. 

The  Satan-watching fundamentalists declare that these  incidents  are 
the  work  of  Satanist groups performing  ghastly  rituals  upon  the 
hapless  animals - helicopters and giant extending ladders  make  sure 
there are no footprints to be found. 

UFO  enthusiasts  insist  the  mutilations  are  the  work  of  aliens 
performing horrific vivisection experiments upon the hapless animals - 
levitating force-beams make sure there are no footprints to be  found. 

As to why Satanists/aliens should want to do these things, both  sides 
offer identical conclusions: "Who knows the mind of a Satanist/alien?" 
And  both  sides choose to ignore  unexciting  explanations  involving 
poachers, parasites, wild animals, and human error.

Then  again,  take  many  UFO  abduction  stories.  Usually,  somebody 
contacts some well known UFO investigator and explains that one night, 
they  saw strange lights in the sky, felt unexplained terror and  have 
been  suffering from nightmares and strange symptoms ever  since.  The 
investigator  talks  to  them, puts  them  through  numerous  hypnotic 
regression  sessions, analyses their dreams. From all this he  deduces 
that  the person has actually been abducted into an alien  spacecraft, 
subjected   to  painful  physical  examination  and  probes   (usually 
concentrating on the sexual organs) and had their conscious memory  of 
the occasion wiped before being returned to Earth. 

Compare  this  scenario  to  the numerous "I  was  a  victim  of  evil 
Satanists" stories. Someone contacts a Christian occult  investigator, 
explains that they once played with a Ouija board/tarot deck/sat on  a 
bus  next  to a witch, felt unexplained terror, since when  they  have 
been suffering nightmares and strange symptoms. The investigator  puts 
the  person  through numerous regressions sessions,  administers  much 
counselling and healing, and analyses their dreams. From all this,  he 
deduces  that the person was forced to take part in  horrible  Satanic 
rituals, where bizarre-looking people chanting in a strange tongue did 
unpleasant things to their victims body (usually concentrating on  the 
sexual  organs),  afterwards  administering  drugs/hypnosis  to   wipe 
conscious memories of the occasion.

Seen  in this light, the story of American Kathie  Davies'  encounters 
with  aliens  makes  interesting reading for  anybody  aquainted  with 
"Devil worshippers-ate-my-baby" stories. 

In 1983 "Kathie" (a pseudonym) contacted UFO investigator Bud Hopkins, 
telling him that a UFO landed in her garden, leaving visible traces on 
the ground. She also told him that she believed that this had not been 
the  first  time she had had contact with aliens. Over the  next  four 
years,  hypnotic  regression  and dream analysis  enabled  Hopkins  to 
extract  from  Davies an incredible story. According  to  this  story, 
Kathie  had experienced various types of alien contact from  an  early 
age. 

At age two or three, her mother had protected her from a "threat  from 
the sky" by hiding her in a closet; at age six, she wandered away from 
home  and met a little grey-skinned alien (disguised as a  small  boy) 
who  cut  her leg; at age sixteen, she went on a car ride  with  three 
young men who acted strangely. Two years later, she was on another car 
ride  when  she  was  abducted  by  little  grey-skinned  aliens,  who 
subjected her to a painful gynaecological probe; her two companions in 
the  car were kept unaware of her disappearance.  Four  months  later, 
she was abducted again by the same aliens and again intimately probed. 

Hopkins  interpretation of this was that Kathie had been  artificially 
inseminated  at  the  first abduction and had  had  her  unborn  child 
removed at the second abduction. He writes about this: "I guessed what 
had happened, and shortly after I brought Kathie out of the trance she 
conformed  this.  They had taken her baby. " (my  italics).  The  next 
year,  when she was pregnant with her son Bobbie (she was  married  by 
this  time and Bobbies father was entirely human), she was abducted  a 
third  time and had her nostrils probed. A year later,  pregnant  with 
her  second  son,  she  received a  series  of  peculiar  phone  calls 
consisting  of a guttural voice moaning something indecipherable;  her 
second child was subsequently born with a speech defect that made  him 
sound strangely like the unknown caller. In June 1983, the UFO landing 
that caused her to contact Hopkins occurred; she was abducted a fourth 
time and had her ear probed. 

Hopkins  believes that something was implanted in Kathie  during  both 
this and the earlier nostril probing. Three months later she went into 
a  local  shop  for some shopping, to realise  with  horror  that  the 
"shopkeeper"  was  an alien and his "shop" a  spaceship.  She  hurried 
home,  to be later abducted for the fifth time. In the  spaceship  she 
was  medically  examined, had a small cut made in her  neck,  and  was 
shown  the artificially created child that had been taken from her  in 
1978.  A  month after this, she dreamed that the aliens  came  to  her 
bedroom  and  removed  ova  from her  while  she  was  sleeping,  also 
kidnapping  her  younger son. The child was abducted  again  in  1986, 
after which Kathy had a final, momentous dream: she is taken into  the 
spaceship,  shown two babies, told there are seven more  and  informed 
that  they are all hers. Later that year her elder son  starts  seeing 
lights  in  the  sky,  has mysterious nosebleeds  and  dreams  of  red 
tarantulas.

Such  is the Kathie Davies story. Regular ORCRO readers will notice  a 
familiar  pattern. There are all the kidnappings (unnoticed by  anyone 
else),  the forced insertion of various instruments into  the  various 
orifices, the encounters with strange and threatening people who  were 
not   what  they  appeared  to  be.  Then  there  is  the   artificial 
insemination  which results in a pregnancy which  even Kathie  herself 
notices  at the time, followed by forced abortion of a foetus that  is 
used  for unknown purposes. There is also the investigators  treatment 
of  the case; Hopkins accepts the most outlandish and  unsubstantiated 
claims  as facts, does not bother with independent  corroboration  for 
any part of Kathies evidence, "interprets" her dreams and memories  to 
fit  his  preconceived  beliefs  and  persuades  her  to  accept   his 
interpretation  as  real,  factual occurrences; she then  goes  on  to 
produce  more  "proof"  for  him in the form  of  dreams  and  strange 
happenings.

Largely for his work with Kathie Davies, Bud Hopkins is today honoured 
and  recognised as one of the worlds top UFO investigators. His  books 
are   bestsellers,  he  is  a  consultant  speaker  at  seminars   and 
conferences; he is the man to go to if you have ever been kidnapped by 
aliens  (especially the small grey-skinned type). "Kathie  Davies"  of 
course  also  has a small niche in the UFOLOGIC hall of fame,  as  the 
first  human woman (there were others afterwards) known to  have  been 
used by aliens for breeding purposes; she is justifiably a legend.

It  is most tempting to wonder what might have happened if Kathie  had 
contacted not Bud Hopkins but (say) Larry Jones or Maureen Davies,  or 
any  other of the "cult-cops" or self-styled "anti-satanists" who  are 
fervent  believers  in Satan and satanic abuse. In response  to  their 
careful,  sensitive  questioning and expert  therapeutic  counselling, 
would  she still have produced a story of being kidnapped, probed  and 
inseminated  by  little grey-skinned aliens? Or would she  (O  foolish 
thought!) have remembered that she in fact spent years being  drugged, 
abused  and  raped  by  baby-eating  Satanists?  O  foolish,   foolish 
thought.....
