          The recent INSIDE UFOLOGY article presented the possibility
that a medical anomaly might be an "alien implant."  The "implant" was
described as assuredly non-metallic (since an MRI did not "rip it right
out of her") and that its removal would be extremely dangerous, because
of its "proximity to the crucial nerve."

          First of all--as pointed out--the M in MRI stands for
magnetic.  The REAL truth is that MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging.  (Actually, it used to be called NMRI--Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Imaging, but the Nuclear was dropped for fear that the public
would connote that with radiation.)  An MRI works by magnetically
alligning the nuclei in each cell in a certain direction.  This allows
images which are highly resolved, and tumors and anomalies are therefore
seen more readily.  An MRI places NO magnetic pull on any molecule.  If
this were true, an MRI would be contraindicated for any patient having
any type of medical implant--a simple amalgam filling, for example.

          Second, the proximity of the "implant" to the crucial nerve
would not make its removal dangerous at all.  Why not?  Because there IS
no crucial nerve.  In fact, if this particular patient does have a
"crucial" nerve, then I believe we definitely have an alien on our
hands.  Not likely.

          Why am I raising a fuss about these two seemily small points?
Because I feel that gross inaccuracies as these is the primary reason
few serious reporters and researchers take ufology seriously.  This is
not likely to change, until ufology researchers become better versed in
the scientific method and the basic sciences.  Science-fiction authors,
artists, and other dreamers are unlikely to help the cause of ufology by
proposing preposterous explanations of scientific observations.  Contra,
they are VERY likely to hurt the cause, as they become the easy targets
of those who DO have the proper background and they can be easily
led and manipulated.

          It is not my purpose, here, to detract from ufology or from
those who have a serious interest in ufology.  Doubtless, most following
the recent developments are well-intentioned and sincere individuals.
However, for the good of the investigation, it is necessary to be able
to scientificaaly verify ALL theories and explanations if the truth is
ever to be learned.

          Certainly, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck,
then in all probability, it's a duck.  However, during the past year such a
myriad conflicting documents, theories, explanations and accusations
have been circulating, that I myself find it necessary to discount
almost everything.  If Moore, Lear, Cooper, and the rest have ANY real
evidence, then let's see it.  Either sh*t or get off the pot.  All we
have so far is a quackless duck.  The amusing question remains: where
(or, more appropriately, who) are the quacks?
