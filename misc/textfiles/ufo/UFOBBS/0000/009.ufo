SUBJECT: WARSHIPS SHOT DOWN UFO                              FILE: UFO9


U.S WARSHIPS PATROLLING PERSIAN GULF SHOT DOWN A UFO DURING
A BATTLE WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN'S TROOPS DURING OPERATION DESERT
STORM. NOW A TOP SECRET MISSION TO RECOVER THE UFO DEBIS IS
UNDERWAY.
THE U.S. NAVY DOWNED A UFO ON JANUARY 24, 1991, ACCORDING TO
A CLASSIFIED REPORT DETAILING ALLIED COOPERATION IN THE WAR
TO LIBERATE KUWAIT.
IT WAS DETECTED BY RADAR FOR NEARLY 30 SECONDS AND WAS FLYING
IN AN ERRATIC MANNER. THE ORDER TO DOWN THE AIRCRAFT WAS
GIVEN WHEN IT BUZZED SEVERAL AMERICAN SHIPS, INCLUDING THE
USS WISCONSIN, USS ENGLAND AND USS O'BRIEN AND TWO BRITISH
FRIGATES, THE HMS BATTIEAXE AND HMS JUPITER.
ALL VESSELS IN THE AREA FIRED ON THE ALIEN SPACECRAFT, 
WHICH WAS DESCRIBED BY OFFICERS AS A CHROMIUM PLATED AIR-
CRAFT WHICH EMITTED A HIGH PITCHED PIERCING SOUND UNLIKE
CONVENTIONAL JETS. THE UFO WAS MOST LIKELY DOWNED BY
A TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILE, ALTHOUGH EVERY SHIP IN THE U.S.
TASK FORCE DEPLOYED IN THE PERSIAN GULF EMPTIED ITS
CONVENTIONAL ARMAMENTS TO DESTROY IT.
NEWS OF THE ALIEN INVOLVEMENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR
WAS FIRST REVEALED WHEN PENTAGON INTELLIGENCE REPORTS OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES PERFORMANCE WERE PARTIALLY DISCLOSED
IN WASHINGTON. FOR SECURITY REASONS, MUCH OF THE SENSITIVE
INFORMATION IS STILL CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET.
BUT RUMORS OF THE UFO INCIDENT WERE VERIFIED BY LONDON
BASED REPORTER ANTHONY EDENS, WHO GAINED ACCESS TO THE
JOINT AMERICAN BRITISH ACCOUNTS OF THE UFO INCIDENT
REVEALED IN LONDON.
THE UFO SKIRMISH IS BY FAR THE MOST PERTINENT MILITARY
KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THE PERSIAN GULF WAR, SAYS EDENS.
THE SOPHISTICATED MILITARY HARDWARE OF THE UNITED STATES
WAS NOT ONLY SUPERIOR TO SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FEARED
REPUBLICAN GUARD TROOPS BUT ALSO TO THE UFO.
THE HUNT FOR THE UFO DEBRIS WAS REPORTEDLY DELAYED UNTIL
THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH ISSUED AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO RECOVER THE DOWNED SPACECRAFT.
INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS ARE RELYING ON SPACE SATELLITE
TRANSMISSIONS OF THE PERSIAN GULF TO RACE THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE UFO DEBRIS.
RESPECTED UFOLOGIST CRAIG SHOPLEY SAYS IF THE UFO INCIDENT
RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ANY ALIENS, THE RESULTS COULD BE
DEVASTATING FOR ALL MANKIND.
ALIEN SPACECRAFT ARE PROBABLY MONITORING THE EARTH TO
LEARN MORE ABOUT US, HE SAYS.
I'M SURE THAT MANY AMERICANS WILL DISAPPEAR THIS SUMMER,
AND WILL BE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS WHO WANT TO INTERROGATE 
THEM ABOUT THE GULF WAR.
