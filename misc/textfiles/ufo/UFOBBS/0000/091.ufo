SUBJECT: UFO'S AND OUR GOVERNMENT'S CONCEALMENT              FILE: UFO91

PART 4

   "The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until
 sometime in 1962 when a craft blew up not far from the test
 sight, in the air, and the explosion was seen over a three-state
 area. The pilots were killed, they had no idea what had happened
 or why the craft blew up, but they put Project Redlight on hold
 until a later date when the aliens supplied us with 3-craft and
 personnel to help us learn how to fly these craft. That project
 is ongoing and we now have not only alien craft that we are fly-
 ing, we have craft we have built, using the captured technology,
 and some of the UFO's that people report seeing in the United
 States, and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by United States
 personnel."
   "That may come as a shock to you. We have technology way be-
 yond the limits of what we have been told. A lot of our develop-
 ment technologically, since the end of World War II, has been
 due to the exchange of technology which occurs in the area
 called `Area-51' on a regular basis ...ongoing."
   "When James Oberth, professor Oberth retired, many of you
 don't know who he is ...not too many space people in here. Pro-
 fessor Oberth was probably one of the greatest rocket scientists
 and space commentists that ever lived. When he retired, the gov-
 ernment gave him a special award, there was a press conference,
 all kinds of ceremony, and when he got up to speak he said,
 `Gentlemen,' and I quote professor Oberth, he said, `Gentlemen,
 we cannot take credit for all the technological developments
 that we have had in the last decade. We have had help,' and
 that's where he stopped."
   "One of the reporters raised his hand and said, `Professor
 Oberth, can you tell us what other country helped us?'"
   "He said, `It was those little guys from out in space,' and
 then he got down and and would not comment any further. Now this
 occurred in 1959. I can go on and on but time doesn't allow it."
   "I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds
 of things going on all the time, we are making rapid progress in
 exposing this. Since I have begun talking, people have been com-
 ing out of the woodwork at a rapid rate, who know and have
 pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it together,
 because I don't have all the answers. I saw an awful lot of ma-
 terial, I have remembered an awful lot of it, I have probably,
 in my remembering, made some mistakes, and I guarantee you
 they're minor ones, if I have."
   "We have just recently, for those of you who didn't believe
 that the Jason Society of the Jason Scholars, the secret group
 existed, we now have a letter from the Pentagon, with 51 names
 of the Jason Scholars, an admission from the Pentagon that they
 hold the highest security clearances in the nation, an admission
 from the Pentagon that they hold the protocol rank of Rear Ad-
 miral, and are treated as such on any military installation or
 in any government office. There are 6 Nobel Prize winners on
 that list, there are the elite of the elite of the scientific
 world, they are the only ones who really know the truth about
 the technology today and about the real science of physics, be-
 cause the one that we're being taught all the time... If you
 send your kids to college to learn physics you're wasting your
 money because they're teaching them stuff that doesn't work,
 it's not true, it's not real. Gravity is not what we think it
 is. There IS a Unified Theory! We already know what it is, it's
 what makes these craft work. It's absolutely incredible what's
 going on."
   "How many of you keep up with Billy Goodman's show on KVEG out
 of Las Vegas? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning in
 on any night between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM. It's 840 on your AM
 dial, and the subject every night are those subjects that no
 other media person in the United States will touch with a 10-
 foot pole, every single night except Saturday night. It's the
 only show that you can call in and talk to another caller,
 you've got 3-minutes to say whatever you want to say as long as
 you don't cuss or swear or slander anyone, and every night
 they're helping to expose this."
