SUBJECT: ALIENS CALL OFF INVASION OF EARTH!                  FILE: UFO131


WARRIORS FROM ANOTHER WORLD HAD PLANNED TO ATTACK EARTH THIS JULY,
BUT THE DOOMSDAY INVASION HAS APPARENTLY BEEN AVERTED - THANKS TO
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ALIENS! FROM ALL
INDICATIONS, THE INVASION IS OFF, SAID A HIGH RANKING ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL. THE TALKS ARE CONTINUING, BUT FOR NOW WE BELIEVE THE
DANGER IS OVER. THE NEWS FIRST REPORTED THAT AN INVASION WAS PLAN-
NED AFTER SCIENTISTS INTERCEPTED AND TRANSLATED A RADIO TRANSMISSION
FROM SPACE IN 1987. THE BRIEF MESSAGE WAS DECODED BY AN INTERNATIONAL
TEAM OF SCIENTIST LED BY DR. GERHARD SCHULTZ, WHO SAID THE TRANSMISS-
ION WAS INTENDED FOR ALIEN SCOUTS ALREADY INVOLVED IN PRE-STIKE
ACTIVITIES ON EARTH. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - ALIENS FROM A DISTANT
PLANET HAVE SERVED MANKIND WITH A DECLARATION OF WAR, DR. SCHULTZ
SAID IN 1987. THEY ARE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY. DR. SCHULTZ SAID THE MES-
SAGE INDICATED THAT THE ALIENS WOULD INVADE EARTH ON JULY 6, 1993.
OTHER SCIENTISTS INTERPRETED THE MESSAGE TO SAY THE INTRUDERS WOULD
BE HERE AS EARLY AS THE SPRING. U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE WORKED FEVERISHLY
TO FIND A WAY TO AVERT THE ATTACK - GOING SO FAR AS TO OPEN NEGOTIAT-
IONS WITH AN ENVOY FROM THE DISTANT PLANET. THE NEWS REPORTED IN 1991
THAT FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAD MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH AN ALIEN
FROM AN UNKNOWN WORLD. SOURCES SUBSEQUENTLY REVEALED THAT THE PEACE-
LOVING ALIEN WAS SERVING AS A GO-BETWEEN FOR BUSH AND THE INVADERS.
THE SAME ALIEN LATER HELPED CLINTON NEGOTIATE WITH THE ATTACKERS -
AND EVEN TOOK THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT ON A TOP SECRET RIDE IN A
SPACESHIP TO MEET THEIR LEADER. WITHOUT THE EFFORTS OF THE FRIENDLY
ALIEN, WE WOULD BE BRACING FOR A DEVASTATING ATTACK, SAID A WHITE
HOUSE AIDE. BUT EARTH'S GOOD FORTUNE MAY DOOM ANOTHER PLANET IN A
REMOTE AREA OF MILKY WAY. THESE ALIEN WARRIORS ARE NO SAINTS, THE
AIDE SAID. THEY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING FOR MANY YEARS TO GET HERE AND
THEY AREN'T ABOUT TO JUST TURN AROUND AND GO HOME WITHOUT ATTACKING
SOMEBODY. UNFORTUNATELY, ANOTHER POOR PLANET IN ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM
IS LIKELY TO SUFFER THE WRATH OF THESE INTERGALACTIC DEATH MERCHANTS.
