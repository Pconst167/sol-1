SUBJECT: CROP CIRCLES MYSTERY SOLVED..THEY SPELL OUT WORDS!  FILE: UFO26


THE ELABORATE CROP CIRCLES THAT HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY APPEARED
ACROSS ENGLAND ARE ACTUALLY HIEROGLYPHIC FIGURES THAT HINT
OF A GLORIOUS MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD, SAYS A TOP ARCHAEOLOGIST.
THE MESSAGE WILL BE REVEALED IN DETAIL WHEN A LARGE ALIEN
EXPEDITIONARY FORCE ARRIVES HERE ON EARTH IN THE YEAR 1999, SAYS
PROFESSOR IVAN BRUSILOV. HE HAS BLOWN THE LID OFF THE PHENOMENON,
WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE SHRUGGED OFF AS THE WORK OF PRANKSTERS.
PROFESSOR BRUSILOV, OF THE MOSCOW INSTITUTE OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND
ASSOCIATED SCIENCES, USED A COMPUTER TO COMPARE THE MASSIVE FIELD
FIGURES TO ANCIENT MAYAN AND EGYPTIAN MARKINGS BEFORE COMING
UP WITH HIS STUNNING CONCLUSION. HE SAYS THE ALIENS WILL HELP THE
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS ERADICATE DISEASE AND DOUBLE MAN'S LIFE SPAN
TO A FANTASTIC 150 YEARS. CANCER AND AIDS WILL BE CURED INSTANTLY.
WHEN PUT IN THE CORRECT ORDER, THE FIGURES IN THE FIELDS REPRESENT
THE FIVE WORD STATEMENT: WE WILL ARRIVE IN 1999, HE SAYS.
ADDITIONAL FIGURES APPEAR TO BE PROMISES FROM THE ALIENS TO SHARE
THEIR ADVANCED MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THE MARKINGS
INDICATE THAT WE'RE IN FOR A GLORIOUS PERIOD OF REVELATIONS. THE
ALIENS ARE THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH TO GIVE US PLENTY OF TIME TO PREPARE
FOR THEIR ARRIVAL. THEY'RE WELL AWARE THAT A SUDDEN MASS LANDING
COULD CAUSE PANIC AND POSSIBLY BRING ABOUT A DEFENSIVE REACTION
FROM THE EARTH'S ARMIES. HE WANTS WORLD LEADERS TO BE READY TO
ACCEPT THE ALIENS WITH OPEN ARMS. HE BELIEVES POLITICIANS ARE
WELL AWARE THAT THE CIRCLES AREN'T MANMADE. THOSE FELLOWS WHO
CAME FORWARD AND TOOK CREDIT FOR MAKING THE FIGURES COULD VERY
WELL HAVE BEEN PLANTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO EASE THE TENSION
THAT WAS BUILDING OVER THE MATTER, BRUSILOV SAYS. THEIR
EXPLANATIONS SOUNDED PLAUSIBLE, BUT I DOUBT THEY COULD HAVE
DONE THE DETAILED WORK WITHOUT MESSING UP THE SURROUNDING
CROPS OR DRAWING ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES. IT WAS MEANT TO WRAP
UP THE MATTER NICE AND NEATLY. BUT I KEPT CHECKING THE FIGURES.
TOP UFOLOGISTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MONITORING THE PUZZLING SITUATION
SINCE THE FIRST FIGURE, FORMED OUT OF FLATTENED WHEAT, WAS
DISCOVERED IN THE 1980'S. THE AMAZING SHAPES CAN BEST BE SEEN
FROM ABOVE, A FACT THAT LED SOME OBSERVERS TO THINK THEY WERE
PRODUCED BY A SPACECRAFT. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE WONDERFUL
DRAWINGS FOUND ON THE PERUVIAN PLAINS, SAYS OTTO KRUEGER,A
GERMAN UFO EXPERT WHO'S STUDYING CROP CIRCLES. THEY MEAN
LITTLE TO SOMEONE ON THE GROUND, BUT IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
STORY FROM ABOVE. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE
SHAPES WERE PLACED HERE FOR A REASON. NOW, THANKS TO PROFESSOR
BRUSILOV, WE KNOW WHAT THAT REASON IS. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIAL MEANING BEHIND THE CROP
CIRCLES. PROFESSOR BRUSILOV DOESN'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY
NEW CROP CIRCLES BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORLY ALIENS HAVE SPELLED
OUT THEIR INTENTIONS. I CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN THE EXACT DATE
OF THEIR ARRIVAL, SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE ON GUARD ANY TIME
AFTER JANUARY 1, 1999, HE SAYS. MY INSTINCTIVE FEELING FROM
STUDYING THESE REMARKABLE FIGURES IS THAT THEY'LL BE HERE IN
THE SPRING TIME AND OUR WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. THE
MOSCOW BASED RESEARCHER SAYS THE INTRICATE CROP CIRCLES WERE
PROBABLY MADE BY A SMALL UFO SHIP SENT AHEAD TO SCOUT OUT
POSSIBLE LANDING SITES AND DELIVER THE MESSAGE OF HOPE.
