FISHING BOAT SKIPPER BARNEY SPOONER DIED AND WAS BURIED AT SEA
OF THE BERMUDA ISLANDS HE LOVED. BUT HIS CORPSE WAS SNATCHED
BY MYSTERIOUS FORCES IN THE DEVIL'S TRIANGLE - AND HE WAS
RETURNED TO THE REALM OF THE LIVING.
FOR MORE THAN 72 HOURS, THE 69 YEAR OLD SEAMAN DRIFTED IN THE
LIMBO OF THE LOST, THE TRIANGULAR GRAVEYARD IN THE ATLANTIC WHERE
HUNDREDS OF PLANES, SHIPS AND PEOPLE HAVE FANISHED.
I SAW THEM ALL - THE SIGHTLESS EYES, THE LIFELESS SHAPES, THE
GHOST SHIPS AND THE PHANTOM PLANES OF THAT UNHOLY PLACE, CAPT.
SPOONER TOLD THE NEWS FROM HIS HOME NEAR THE BAY OF IRELAND
ISLAND IN BERMUDA.
IT WAS LIKE SOME UNIMAGINABLE NIGHTMARE, BUT I REMEMBER THAT I
WASN'T AFRAID. THEY WERE ALL DEAD. BUT I KNEW I WAS AS DEAD AS
THEY WERE.
YET I HAD THE FEELING THAT I WASN'T REALLY ONE OF THEM...THAT
I WAS MERELY AN OBSERVER. I HAD THE FEELING I WAS IN A WORLD
WHERE I DIDN'T BELONG.
SPOONER'S JOURNEY TO THE NETHERWORLD BEGAN WHEN HE SUFFERED A
HEART ATTACK ABOARD THE MATILDA II WHILE FISHING IN THE FERTILE
WATERS SOUTH WEST OF GRAND BERMUDA ISLAND.
ABOARD THE BOAT WERE HIS 64 YEAR OLD WIFE, LILLIAN THEIR
GRANDSON, JONATHON, AND CREW OF 30 MEN.
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT GRANDFATHER DIED,
SAID JONATHON,27. HE JUST KEELED OVER AND THAT WAS IT. HE
HAD NO HEARTBEAT, NO PULSE AND NO BREATHING. HE WAS DEAD.
WE WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM INTO ST. GEORGE, BUT GRANDMOTHER
SAID NO. SHE SAID, DAD ALWAYS INSISTED HE BE BURIED AT
SEA AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WILL BE - HERE AND NOW.
WE TIED HIM UP IN A BLANKET, ATTACHED AN OLD ANCHOR AND THREW
HIM TO THE SEA HE LOVED.
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT ISN'T CLEAR TO SPOONER. HE RECALLS ONLY
THAT HE WAS IN A STRANGE WORLD, AS IF HE AWOKE FROM A
DREAM - AND PLUNGED INTO A NIGHTMARE.
I SAW THEM ALL ... EVERY ONE OF THOSE SHIPS AND PLANES THAT
HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THE DEVIL'S TRIANGLE, SPOONER SAID
I SAW THE LOST SHIPS - THE CYCLOPS, THE RAIFUKU MARU AND
THE WITCHCRAFT.
AND I SAW PLANES - THE FIVE NAVY AVENGERS, THE STAR TIGER
AND SO MANY OTHER PLANES.
I SAW THE FACES OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD VANISHED OVER
THE DECADES. THEY FLASHED BY ME LIKE A SLOW MOTION FILM
SPOONER SAID NEXT HE WAS SUDDENLY LOOKING DOWN AT THE SEA
FROM ABOVE AND SEEING HIS OWN LIFELESS BODY IN THE WATER.
I COULD SEE EVERYTHING AS PLAIN AS DAY, HE SAID. I COULD
SEE THE MATILDA II COMING TO RETRIEVE MY BODY.
SPOONER'S WIFE AND GRANDSON SAID 72 HOURS HAD PASSED
BETWEEN THE TIME HIS CORPSE WAS COMMITTED TO THE SEA AND
THE TIME HE WAS PULLED ABOARD THE DINGHY - ALIVE.
THE SEA IS A PLACE WHERE MANY MYSTERIOUS THINGS HAPPEN,
HE SAID. I GUESS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
MYSTERIES. SO BE IT.
