PART 2

His conclusions were that free electrons in the metal were spun
out by centrifugal force, a centripetal force being produced by
the static field in the metal.He decided to build a generator
based on the principal. It had a segmented rotor disc,passing
through electromagnets at its periphery. the electromagnets were
energized from the rotor,and were intended to boost the EMF. By
1952 the first generator had been constructed and was about three
feet in diameter. It was tested in the open by searl and a friend.

The armature was set in motion by a small engine.The device
produced the expected electrical power, but at a unexpectedly
high potential. at relatively low armature speeds a potential of
the order of 10 5 (ten to the power of  five) was produced, as
indicated by the static effects on near objects. A characteristic
crackling and the smell of ozone supported his conclusion.The
really unxpected then occured.While still speeding up the
generator lifted and rose to a height of fifty feet,breaking the
union between itself and the engine. Here it stayed for a while
still speeding up and surrounding itself with a pink halo,this
indicated ionization of the air at a much reduced pressure of
about 1-3 mm Hg.More interesting was the side effect,causing
local radio receivers to go on on their own accord! This could have
been due to ionizing disharge electromagnetic induction.Finally
and perhaps thankfully the whole generator accelerated at a
fantastic rate and is thought to have gone off into space.

Since that day Searl had made some 10 or more small flying craft
some of which have been similary lost,and developed a form of
control. Larger craft have also been built - some 12 ft and two
30ft in dia. The antics of his machines have given rise to much
speculation as to the origin of so called "flying saucers"
specially in the area of Warminster in Wilshire.

One wonders why Searl has not come to the notice of scientists
and the public at large. The fact is that "he has;but for fear of
being ridiculed, people keep the knowlege or interest to
themselves. the public has been educated to scoff at the subject
of flying saucers and the reported behaviour of the things cannot
be explained on current scientific theory. Such " difficult to
explain" topics( as telepathy,dowsing,homeopathic healing,etc)
must be given the "no comment" treatment so not to upset the
uncertain structure of present scientific theory. Searl"s records
do show however that his efforts have not gone unnoticed.

Goverment departments and people of all classes and education know
about him. Some have attempted to steal the idea, but their
thinking along the lines of electromagetic theory and the law of
conservation of mass and energy,has misled the more confused of
them.This narrow thinking has made many to conclude that searl is
a crank or imposter. Also some are prejudiced in their attitude
that new ideas are the prerogative of a hierarchy of intellectuals.

It is susppected that Searl is to come up with something more
momentous than his games with power lines and the unsuspecting
motorist. In that event, the convensional thinker must be ready to
adapt the Searl effect into existing theory. or chance the
alternative fate of a complete disruption revisal of physical
theory from Ampere,Galvani,and Volta onwards. Any theory must
explain these verious phenomena,some of which have been observed
by Searl himself and some by the general public.
