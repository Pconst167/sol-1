Our fellow sysops, the week of August 10-18, 1991 is
scheduled to be The Seventh National UFO Information Week. It
is during this time that we here at JACURUTU will be sending
out an informational file packet named, OPGOVUFO.ZIP to many
BBSs in the U.S. As well as the ten top newspapers in the U.S.

In this file packet will be 10 of the best un-explained UFO
cases in UFOlogy, the letter being sent to the editors of the
newspapers, and the most important facet of this operation: a
form letter to be sent to the Congressmen/women & Senators in
Washington, D.C. calling for a Congressional Investigation
into the UFO Enigma in general and the Roswell crash case in
particular.

UFOlogists in general believe that the time has come for such
investigations, as new information comes to light on the
Roswell crash in 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico.  Roswell as you
may or may not know is where the remains of two craft of
unknown (alien) origin were found, as well as the remains of
the crew (alien bodies) this was reported as a Flying Saucer
on the world news tickers and then hushed up as a weather
balloon. Enough witnesses have surfaced in this event to
state the culpability of the U.S. Government in the cover-up.

This is our "smoking-gun!"

With all the recent reports of "triangular-shaped" aircraft
being sighted, not only here in the U.S. but world-wide, the
best case of this was reported over the skies of Belgium, by
the Belgium government, and was tracked by F-16 fighters (this
being reported on NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries") who engaged and
got radar-lock, only to have ground based radar watch the
objects leave the area at over 7,000 mph, pulling an estimated
60 g's!  Russia has reported the same objects, as well as
Portugal, England, Sweden, Australia, and many, many more
countries.

With the continuing cycle of "crop-circles" worldwide as well,
people coming forth with "abduction" cases. We all believe it
is past time for "serious" investigations to start in this
country.  Other countries are way ahead of us in "public"
government investigations. France, Canada, and Japan come to
the forefront. Belgium has professional UFO Investigators on
the payroll, paid for by the taxes of their citizens.  Are we
any less than they are, or does the U.S. government have
something to hide???

In closing, all we are asking you, the sysops of FIDONET in
the U.S. to do, is make this file available to your users. The
only way we can get the Congress to act is with the "PEOPLE"
sending them this form letter. With enough people asking their
representatives to act on this, we can finally get to the
bottom of " The UFO Enigma"!

I would now like to thank you all for reading this and
hopefully acting on it. The file OPGOVUFO.ZIP is available
for FREQing from 1:379/103. Gail and myself would also like
to thank the folks at FIDONET for letting us put this up.

Many, many thanks to you all!!!
