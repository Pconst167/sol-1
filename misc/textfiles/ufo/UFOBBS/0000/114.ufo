PART 10

5.3  Walter Haut
[Second Lieutenant Walter Haut was a public information
officer at Roswell AAF in 1947.  Colonel Blanchard ordered
Haut to issue a press release telling the country that the
Army had found a flying saucer.  Here is the text of Haut's
press release.]
The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality
yesterday when the Intelligence office of the 509th Bomb
Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was
fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the
cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's
office of Chaves County.
The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime
last week.  Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored
the disc until such time as he was able to contact the
sheriff's office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel
of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.
Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at
the rancher's home.  It was inspected at Roswell Army Air
Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher
headquarters.
[Here is what Haut said on the American television program
"Unsolved Mysteries".]
I took the release into town.  And that was one of the
things that Colonel Blanchard told me to do, take it into
town, because if there was any validity to this, he didn't
want the news media to feel that we had jumped over their
heads and were not cooperating with them.
[Here is what Haut said in an interview for an article in
"Air and Space/Smithsonian" magazine, Sep-Oct 1992, when
asked what he thought really happened back in 1947.]
I feel there was a crash of an extra-terrestrial vehicle
near Corona.
5.4  Bill Rickett
[Bill Rickett was a Counter Intelligence Corps officer based
in Roswell.  He had an opportunity to examine some of the
wreckage recovered from the Foster Ranch.  He escorted Dr
Lincoln LaPaz, a meteor expert from the New Mexico Institute
of Meteoritics, on a tour of the crash site and the
surrounding area.]
[The material] was very strong and very light.  You could
bend it but couldn't crease it.  As far as I know, no one
ever figured out what it was made of....
It was LaPaz's job to try to find out what the speed and
trajectory of the thing was.  LaPaz was a world-renowned
expert on trajectories of objects in the sky, especially
meteors, and I was told to give him all the help I could.
At one point LaPaz interviewed the farmer [Mac Brazel].  I
remember something coming up during their conversation about
this fellow thinking that some of his animals had acted
strangely after this thing happened.  Dr LaPaz seemed very
interested in this for some reason.
LaPaz wanted to fly over the area, and this was arranged.
He found one other spot where he felt this thing had touched
down and then taken off again.  The sand at this spot had
been turned into a glass-like substance.  We collected a
boxful of samples of this material.  As I recall, there were
some metal samples here, too, of that same sort of thin foil
stuff.  LaPaz sent this box off somewhere for study; I don't
know or recall where, but I never saw it again.  This place
was some miles from the other one.
LaPaz was very good at talking to people, especially some of
the local ranch hands who didn't speak a lot of English.
LaPaz spoke Spanish.  I remember he found a couple of people
who had seen two -- I don't know what to call them, UFOs I
suppose -- anyway, had seen two of these things fly over
very slowly at a very low altitude on a date, in the
evening, that he determined had been a day or two after the
other one had blown up.  These people said something about
animals being affected, too....
Before he went back to Albuquerque, he told me that he was
certain that this thing had gotten into trouble, that it had
touched down for repairs, taken off again, and then
exploded.  He also felt certain there were more than one of
these devices, and that the others had been looking for it.
At least that's what he said.  He was positive the thing had
malfunctioned.
The Air Force's explanation that it was a balloon was
totally untrue.  It was not a balloon.  I never did know for
sure what its purpose was, but it wasn't ours.  I remember
speculating with LaPaz that it might have been some higher
civilization checking on us.  LaPaz wasn't against the idea,
but he was going to leave speculations out of his report.
