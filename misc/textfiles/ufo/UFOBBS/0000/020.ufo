SUBJECT: ALIEN MOON BASE                                     FILE: UFO20


Is there an "Alien Base" on the Moon. More and more people are coming
forward with stories of an Alien presence on the Moon. Rumors say that
there is an Alien Moon Base on the far side of the moon, the side we
never see from Earth.

Did you ever wonder why the Moon landings stopped and why we have not
tried to build a Moon Base? It does seem like a better and easier idea
than a floating space station with no access to any raw materials or
supplies? According to the NASA Astronaut Neil Armstrong the Aliens
have a base on the Moon and told us in no uncertain terms to get off
and stay off the Moon!

Sound far fetched? Milton Cooper a Naval Intelligence Officer tell us
that not only does the Alien Moon Base exist but the U.S. Naval
Intelligence Community refers to the Alien Moon Base as "Luna", that
there is a huge mining operation going on there, and that is where the
Aliens keep their huge mother ships while the trips to Earth are made
in smaller "flying saucers".

LUNA:  The Alien base on the far side of the Moon. It was seen and
       filmed by the Apollo Astronauts. A base, a mining operation
       using very large machines, and the very large alien craft
       described in sighting reports as mother ships exist there. -

Did Apollo 11 Encounter UFOs on the Moon?   from the Book "Above Top
Secret" by Timothy Good

According to hitherto unconfirmed reports, both Neil Armstrong and
Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that historic landing on
the Moon in Apollo 11 on 21 July 1969. I remember hearing one of the
astronauts refer to a "light" in or on a carter during the television
transmission, followed by a request from mission control for further
information. Nothing more was heard.

According to a former NASA employee Otto Binder, unnamed radio hams
with their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's
broadcasting outlets picked up the following exchange:

NASA:  What's there?  Mission Control calling Apollo 11...

Apollo11: These "Babies" are huge, Sir! Enormous! OH MY GOD! You
          wouldn't believe it! I'm telling you there are other
          spacecraft out there, Lined up on the far side of the crater
          edge! They're on the Moon watching us!

In 1979 Maurice Chatelain, former chief of NASA Communications Systems
confirmed that Armstrong had indeed reported seeing two UFOs on the
rim of a crater. "The encounter was common knowledge in NASA," he
revealed, "but nobody has talked about it until now."

Soviet scientists were allegedly the first to confirm the incident.
"According to our information, the encounter was reported immediately
after the landing of the module," said Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, a
physicist and Professor of Mathematics at Moscow University. "Neil
Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large,
mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the
moon module. But his message was never heard by the public - because
NASA censored it. "According to another Soviet scientist, Dr.
Aleksandr Kazantsev, Buss Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs
from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and
Armstrong went outside. Dr. Azhazha claims that the UFOs departed
minutes after the astronauts came out on to the lunar surface.

Maurice Chatelain also confirmed that Apollo 11's radio transmissions
were interrupted on several occasions in order to hide the news from
the public. Before dismissing Chatelain's sensational claims, it is
worth noting his impressive background in the aerospace industry and
space program. His first job after moving from France was as an
electronics engineer with Convair, specializing in telecommunications,
telemetry and radar. In 1959 he was in charge of an electromagnetic
research group, developing new radar and telecommunications systems
for Ryan. One of his eleven patents was an automaticãflights to the Moon. Later, at North American
Aviation, Chatelain was offered the job of designing and building the
Apollo communications and data-processing systems.

Chatelain claims that "all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed,
both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles
of extraterrestrial origin - flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to
call them by that name. Every time it occurred, the astronauts
informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence." He goes
on to say:

  "I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was the first of the
  astronauts to use the code name 'Santa Claus' to indicate the
  presence of flying saucers next to space capsules. However, his
  announcements were barely noticed by the general public. It was a
  little different when James Lovell on board the Apollo 8 command
  module came out from behind the moon and said for everybody to hear:
  'PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.' Even though this
  happened on Christmas Day 1968, many people sensed a hidden meaning
  in those words."

Rumors persist. NASA may well be a civilian agency, but many of its
programs are funded by the defense budget and most of the astronauts
are subject to military security regulations. Apart from the fact that
the National Security Agency screens all films and probably radio
communications as well. We have the statements by Otto Binder, Dr.
Garry Henderson and Maurice Chatelain that the astronauts were under
strict orders not to discuss their sightings. And Gordon Cooper has
testified to a United Nations committee that one of the astronauts
actually witnessed a UFO on the ground. If there is no secrecy, why
has this sighting not been made public?

A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was engaged in a
discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium.

Professor:  What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11?

Armstrong:  It was incredible, of course we had always known there was
            a possibility, the fact is, we were warned off!(by the
            Aliens). There was never any question then of a space
            station or a moon city.

Professor:  How do you mean "warned off"?

Armstrong:  I can't go into details, except to say that their ships
            were far superior to ours both in size and technology -
            Boy, were they big!...and menacing! No, there is no
            question of a space station.

Professor:  But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?

Armstrong:  Naturally - NASA was committed at that time, and couldn't
            risk panic on Earth. But it really was a quick scoop and
            back again.

Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into
further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up.
