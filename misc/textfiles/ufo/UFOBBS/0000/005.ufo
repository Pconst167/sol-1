    SUBJECT: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS                                 FILE: UFO5

We journey into the twilight zone with three people who recall,
under hypnosis, their astonishing experiences of alien abduction
- and bizarre experiments.
    You may find some of the facts far-fetched. Others you may
feel are simply figments of people's imaginations - but they
will all make you think twice about UFOs.
    We take a look at three close encounters, accounts by people
whom UFO experts believe have been abducted by extraterrestrials,
and talk to an Adelaide farmer who believes his property was used
as a landing site.
    Roy Lake, 53 chairman of UFO Studies, an international
organization with its head office in London, has been studying
UFOs for 33 years. He formed his group two years ago with three
people, and now has 18 investigators.  "The subject goes a lot
further than the public's perception of little green men," Roy
says.
    "When you mention abductions and flying saucers, people
ridicule it. But you can't dispute the evidence that is
materializing to the contrary. And unfortunately, a lot of people
are too scared to talk about it."
    Tony Dodd, 57, is the director of investigation and research
for UFO Magazine, and he had his first encounter with a UFO in
1978.  "I'm very involved with investigating abduction cases and
I'm usually present at the regression hypnosis sessions," Tony
says.  "The similarities of the stories related by the people
under hypnosis are so strong that even skeptics would change
their minds.
    "We believe the aliens are involved in genetic engineering,
but it's not new - it's been going on for centuries."  Harry
Harris, 50, a lawyer who has spent 12 years investigation
accounts of sightings, adds: "My conclusions are that these
people experience amnesia, and hypnosis is the only way they can
recall the time they've lost."            XX

              |* Aliens are visiting so often that a   |
              |spaceship is spotted somewhere in the   |
              |world every 15 seconds.                 |
              |* Aliens are abducting women up to three|
              |months pregnant and snatching their     |
              |unborn babies.                          |
              |* Male abductees are being used for     |
              |bizarre experiments before being return-|
              |ed to earth unharmed.                   |
              |* If you have seen a UFO, it is likely  |
              |you have unknowingly been abducted.     |
              |* Governments are covering up sightings |
              |to prevent mass civilian panic.         |
              |* US security services are withholding  |
              |50,000 documents about UFO sightings.   |
              |* UFOs have been recorded on radar sys- |
              |tems, travelling at 25,000 km/h.        |
