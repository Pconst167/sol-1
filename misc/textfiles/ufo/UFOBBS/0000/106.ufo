PART 2

1.2  Sequence of Events
On July 2, 1947, during the evening, a flying saucer crashed
on the Foster Ranch near Corona, New Mexico.  The crash
occurred during a severe thunderstorm.  (The military base
nearest the crash site is in Roswell, New Mexico; hence,
Roswell is more closely associated with this event than
Corona, even though Corona is closer to the crash site.)
On July 3, 1947, William "Mac" Brazel (rhymes with
"frazzle") and his 7-year-old neighbor Dee Proctor found the
remains of the crashed flying saucer.  Brazel was foreman of
the Foster Ranch.  The pieces were spread out over a large
area, perhaps more than half a mile long.  When Brazel drove
Dee back home, he showed a piece of the wreckage to Dee's
parents, Floyd and Loretta Proctor.  They all agreed the
piece was unlike anything they had ever seen.
On July 6, 1947, Brazel showed pieces of the wreckage to
Chaves County Sheriff George Wilcox.  Wilcox called Roswell
Army Air Field (AAF) and talked to Major Jesse Marcel, the
intelligence officer.  Marcel drove to the sheriff's office
and inspected the wreckage.  Marcel reported to his
commanding officer, Colonel William "Butch" Blanchard.
Blanchard ordered Marcel to get someone from the Counter
Intelligence Corps, and to proceed to the ranch with Brazel,
and to collect as much of the wreckage as they could load
into their two vehicles.
Soon after this, military police arrived at the sheriff's
office, collected the wreckage Brazel had left there, and
delivered the wreckage to Blanchard's office.  The wreckage
was then flown to Eighth Air Force headquarters in Fort
Worth, and from there to Washington.
Meanwhile, Marcel and Sheridan Cavitt of the Counter
Intelligence Corps drove to the ranch with Mac Brazel.  They
arrived late in the evening.  They spent the night in
sleeping bags in a small out-building on the ranch, and in
the morning proceeded to the crash site.
On July 7, 1947, Marcel and Cavitt collected wreckage from
the crash site.  After filling Cavitt's vehicle with
wreckage, Marcel told Cavitt to go on ahead, that Marcel
would collect more wreckage, and they would meet later back
at Roswell AAF.  Marcel filled his vehicle with wreckage.
On the way back to the air field, Marcel stopped at home to
show his wife and son the strange material he had found.
On July 7, 1947, around 4:00 pm, Lydia Sleppy at Roswell
radio station KSWS began transmitting a story on the
teletype machine regarding a crashed flying saucer out on
the Foster Ranch.  Transmission was interrupted, seemingly
by the FBI.
On July 8, 1947, in the morning, Marcel and Cavitt arrived
back at Roswell AAF with two carloads of wreckage.  Marcel
accompanied this wreckage, or most it, on a flight to Fort
Worth AAF.
On July 8, 1947, around noon, Colonel Blanchard at Roswell
AAF ordered Second Lieutenant Walter Haut to issue a press
release telling the country that the Army had found the
remains of a crashed a flying saucer.  Haut was the public
information officer for the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell AAF.
Haut delivered the press release to Frank Joyce at radio
station KGFL.  Joyce waited long enough for Haut to return
to the base, then called Haut there to confirm the story.
Joyce then sent the story on the Western Union wire to the
United Press bureau.
On July 8, 1947, in the afternoon, General Clemence McMullen
in Washington spoke by telephone with Colonel (later
Brigadier General) Thomas DuBose in Fort Worth, chief of
staff to Eighth Air Force Commander General Roger Ramey.
McMullen ordered DuBose to tell Ramey to quash the flying
saucer story by creating a cover story, and to send some of
the crash material immediately to Washington.
On July 8, 1947, in the afternoon, General Roger Ramey held
a press conference at Eighth Air Force headquarters in Fort
Worth in which he announced that what had crashed at Corona
was a weather balloon, not a flying saucer.  To make this
story convincing, he showed the press the remains of a
damaged weather balloon that he claimed was the actual
wreckage from the crash site.  (Apparently, the obliging
press did not ask why the Army hurriedly transported weather
balloon wreckage to Fort Worth, Texas, site of the press
conference, from the crash site in a remote area of New
Mexico.)
The only newspapers that carried the initial flying saucer
version of the story were evening papers from the Midwest to
the West, including the Chicago Daily News, the Los Angeles
Herald Express, the San Francisco Examiner, and the Roswell
Daily Record.  The New York Times, the Washington Post, and
the Chicago Tribune were morning papers and so carried only
the cover-up story the next morning.
