SUBJECT: MONSTER IN LAKE MICHIGAN                            FILE: UFO62


THE U.S. NAVY CAPTURED A 140 FOOT MONSTER IN LAKE MICHIGAN
ON OCTOBER 22 AND A SECRET PENTAGON PHOTOGRAPH PROVES IT.
THE PICTURE CLEARLY SHOWS A PAIR OF NAVY DIVERS CAUTIOUSLY
APPROACHING THE BEAST JUST MINUTES AFTER IT WAS IMMOBILIZED
IN A GIGANTIC STEEL NET.
AND WHILE IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHAT THE NAVY PLANS TO DO
WITH THE MONSTER, SOURCES SAY THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE
MADE TO KEEP IT ALIVE WHILE RESEARCHERS TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS, HOW IT GOT INTO LAKE MICHIGAN AND IF THERE ARE
MORE LIKE IT.
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A GAWKING TOURIST BUT THE LOCHNESS
MONSTER IS NOTHING, AND I DO MEAN NOTHING, COMPARED TO THIS,
DECLARED MARINE BIOLOGIST RICHARD CLARKE, WHO CITED PENTAGON
SOURCES AND DOCUMNETS WHEN HE BLEW THE LID OFF THE CAPTURE
OF THE BEAST AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
THE NAVY SPENT SIX MONTHS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS THING, HE
CONTINUED, AND BIG QUESTION NOW IS WHAT THE HELL DID THEY
CATCH? THE MONSTER LOOKS LIKE A DINOSAUR BUT THERE ARE
SEVERAL IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS.
FOR ONE THING, DINOSAURS WERE EXCEEDINGLY STUPID BUT THIS
LAKE MONSTER APPARENTLY HAS AN INTELLIGENCE RIVALING THAT
OF A DOG OR A HORSE. IT ALSO HAS LUNGS AND GILLS, WHICH
ENABLE IT TO BREATHE IN OR OUT OF WATER AT WILL.
ONE OF THE MORE INTRIGUING ASPECTS OF THIS CASE IS WHY NOBODY
HAS REPORTED SEEING THE MONSTER BEFORE, HE ADDED. THEN AGIN
PEOPLE MAY HAVE SEEN IT BUT WERE TOO EMBARRASSED OR AFRAID TO TALK.
PENTAGON AND NAVY SPOKESMEN DECLINED TO DISCUSS CLARKE'S REPORT,
BUT IN A PUZZLING CONCESSION TO REPEATED AND OFTER ANGRY
QUESTIONING FROM NEWSMEN, EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO
COMMENT BECAUSE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS MAY BE AT STAKE.
THE EXPERT HIMSELF SAID HE GOT HIS INFORMATION FROM PENTAGON
SOURCES WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT CALLED
THE CAPTURE OF THE MONSTER THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY INITIATIVE
SINCE THE ALLIED COALITION FORCES RAN SADDAM HUSSEIN OUT OF
KUWAIT DURING THE WAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF.
ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS, NAVY VESSELS SIGHTED THE MONSITER
WHILE ON A TRAINING MISSION IN LAKE MICHIGAN LATE LAST SPRING
AS A MATTER OF ROUTINE, THEY SCANNED THE AREA WITH SONAR AND
CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE MOVING OBJECT, IDENTITY
UNKNOWN.
PORTIONS OF THE REPORT HAD BEEN DELETED BY PENTAGON CENSORS
BEFORE CLARKE OBTAINED A COPY FOR HIMSELF. BUT THE DOCUMENTS
CLEARLY STATED THAT THE NAVY TRACKED THE OBJECT FOR 72 HOURS
BEFORE IT SURFACED THREE MILES WEST OF SOUTH FOX ISLAND IN
THE NORTH CENTRAL SECTOR OF THE LAKE.
ADDITIONAL VESSELS AND DIVERS WERE DISPATCHED FROM THE GREAT
LAKES NAVAL TRAINING CENTER TO CONTINUE TRACKING THE CREATURE
AND WITHIN SIX WEEKS, THE NAVY WAS SECRETLY DRAGGING AN
UNSPECIFIED AREA OF THE LAKE WITH A MASSIVE STEEL NET, SAID
CLARKE.
THE NOSTER ELUDED CAPTURE UNTIL OCTOBER 22. MY SOURCES SAY
IT IS NOW BEING HELD IN AN UNDERWATER CAGE WHILE THE PENTAGON
AND NAVY DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
THE MONSTER WEIGHTS AN ESTIMATED 35 TONS AND IS SAID TO BE
EATING AS MUCH AS A TON OF RAW FISH AND MEAT A DAY, SAID THE
EXPERT. THERE WAS INITIALLY SOME CONCERN THAT THE CREATURE
WOULD STRUGGLE FREE OF THE NET.
BUT IT CALMED DOWN CONSIDERABLY AFTER NAVY DIVERS DOSED IT
WITH MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF A POWERFUL ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER AND
IS NOW RESTING COMFORTABLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.
THE MONSTER'S HEAD IS AS BIG AS A STATION WAGON AND THE SHARP,
WHITE FANGS IN ITS MOUTH WOULD SEEM TO ANSWER A LOT OF
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS HERITAGE AND TEMPERAMENT, WHICH ARE
DESCRIBED AS BEING PREHISTORIC AND FOUL, SAID DR. CLARKE.
THE PENTAGON IS DEFINITELY TRYING TO KEEP A LID ON THIS, HE
ADDED. BUT A STORY OF THIS MAGNITUDE CAN'T BE KEPT UNDER WRAPS
FOREVER.
