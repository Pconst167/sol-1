PART 17

6.2  Secret Rocket or Airplane
*  If what crashed was any kind of secret military
apparatus, one would expect at least some of the pieces to
have recognizable letters or numbers on them.  Many of the
witnesses say that some of the wreckage bore a very strange
kind of writing, but not one witness has said that any of
the wreckage bore any recognizable symbols.
*  If what crashed was any kind of secret military
apparatus, the Army would have said simply, "This is secret,
and no more questions will be answered, period."  The Army
would not have concocted the flying saucer and weather
balloon stories.  In 1947, Americans were less skeptical
about the motives of their government, and the people of New
Mexico, including journalists and other civilians, were
dependent for their livelihood on secret military projects.
*  If what crashed was any kind of secret military
apparatus, the Army would not have waited for a rancher to
inform them of the crash before sending military personnel
to examine the wreckage, five days after the crash.
*  Rockets and airplanes that were secret in 1947 are not
secret now.  If what crashed was a secret rocket or
airplane, it would have been revealed as such years ago.
(Incredibly, the Army is sticking to its weather balloon
story, even though nobody believes it anymore.)
*  By July 1947, rockets launched from White Sands were
fitted with self-destruct mechanisms so that an errant
rocket could be destroyed before leaving the test range.
The Corona crash site is about 75 miles from the nearest
border of the test range.
*  They did not fly secret airplanes in New Mexico in 1947.
There was plenty of room for that in California, where all
the secret airplane projects were carried on.
*  There is no reason the Army would transport the wreckage
of a crashed rocket or airplane to Fort Worth AAF, then to
Wright AAF in Ohio.  The wreckage of a secret rocket would
stay in New Mexico, and the wreckage of a secret airplane
would be sent back to California, if anywhere.
*  Most of the witnesses who saw or handled the wreckage
would have recognized the remains of a crashed rocket or
airplane.
