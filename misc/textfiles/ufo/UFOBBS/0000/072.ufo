SUBJECT: FARMER'S TALES OF SPACE TRAVEL                      FILE: UFO72

PART 2

      He  also said he had photographed and filmed UFOs that
resembled hub-caps;  tape-recorded  their  noises, which resembled
sound effects from old science-fiction  films; conversed with
female UFOnauts, who taught him cosmic  truths;  flew  aboard  a
UFO  into space, where he photographed God's "eye"  and  the
Apollo-Soyuz  docking of 1975; and traveled by saucer into the
future, where he saw the ruins of San Francisco after an
earthquake.

      But  Meier's  "evidence"  dissolved  under  scrutiny,
ufologists say. Ufologist  Spaulding  used  a computer to clarify
blurry details in Meier's photos  and,  he said, detected threads
holding the "UFOs" aloft - evidence that  they were small models
suspended near the camera. Also, critics said, the  photos  of
quake-ravaged  San Francisco turned out to be copies of an
artist's  rendering  from  the September 1977 issue of Geo
magazine. And in Meier's  8mm movies of UFOs, the objects sway
back and forth as though they were lightweight models bobbing in
the breeze.

      Yet  the  Meier  story  has survived partly because of the
relentless advocacy  of his American backers, the Arizona
ufologists Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens  (US  Air Force, retired),
Tom Welch and Lee and Brit Elders. Years ago, they obtained the
legal rights to market Meier's photos and other memorabilia,
threatened  to  sue anyone who used the material without permis-
sion  and  built  a  small publishing industry, Genesis III. The
publishing arm  sells  books  and  videocassettes  (for  as  much
as $29 apiece) about Meier's adventures.

      Now  they've  landed a much bigger fish: royalties from
Kinder's 206-page  book,  published  May  26th.  They're sharing
royalties in return forgiving Kinder access to Meier's photos and
other documents.

      Much  money  may  be  made by all: Kinder will take 50
percent of the royalties,  then  the  rest  will  be  divided
among  Meier,  Stevens, the Elderses and Welch.

      Sales  have  gone "extremely well," Kinder said. The best-
seller list is  in  sight,  said the book's backer, New York
publishing whiz-kid Morgan Entrekin,  who paid Kinder an advance
of more than $100,000. Bay Area bookstore owners say its selling
moderately.

      The  book  has infuriated many ufologists who think it lends
an undeserved  patina  of respectability to a vulgar hoax,
although Kinder doesn't reach  a  specific  conclusion about
Meier's claims. "Face it, you're in it for  the  money like the
rest of the writers of superficial paranormal literature,"
Spaulding said in a bitter letter to Kinder.

      "It's  been  a real ordeal trying to fend off the entire UFO
community,"  joked  Kinder,  40.  "There were times when I would
look at Meier and think,  `He's nothing but a clever con man.'
There were other times would I would  look  at Meier and think,
`Here is a sincere and warm individual who has experienced
something far above his understanding and intellectual capabilities
and is trying to deal with it.'"

      The  Elderses  say  they've  received  threatening  letters
and phone calls  and  that  Meier  has  been  the target of
several assassination attempts.  They're  not disturbed by
evidence that Meier faked photos of, for example,  the  San
Francisco  earthquake;  in fact, they haven't even discussed  it
with Meier, Lee Elders said. His wife insists that just because
Meier faked "one or two things" doesn't mean all his photos are
phony.

      To Lee Elders, the best evidence for Meier's contentions is
an analysis  of  metal  samples  from an alleged UFO. The analysis
was conducted by Marcel  Vogel, formerly a chemist at an IBM
research center in San Jose. In the  New  York  Times  Book Review,
a full page ad for "Light Years" quotes Vogel  as  saying the
metallic composition was one "we could not achieve...on this
planet."

      However, the book doesn't mention that Vogel is a very, very
imaginative fellow. In fact, he also has claimed the ability to
communicate psychically with plants.
