PART 14

5.10  Melvin Brown's Daughter
[Sergeant Melvin Brown was a cook at Roswell AAF in 1947.
One day, he was called out to help guard material retrieved
from the Foster Ranch.  His daughter Beverly was interviewed
by Stanton Friedman in 1989.]
When we were young, he used to tell us stories about things
that had happened to him when he was young.  We got to know
those stories by heart and would all say together, "Here we
go again."
Sometimes, but not too often, he used to say that he saw a
man from outer space.  That used to make us all giggle like
mad.  He said he had to stand guard duty outside a hangar
where a crashed flying saucer was stored, and that his
commanding officer said, "Come on, Brownie, let's have a
look inside."  But they didn't see anything because it had
all been packed up and [was] ready to be flown out to Texas.
He also said that one day all available men were grabbed and
that they had to stand guard where a crashed disc had come
down.  Everything was being loaded onto trucks, and he
couldn't understand why some of the trucks had ice or
something in them.  He did not understand what they wanted
to keep cold.  Him and another guy had to ride in the back
of one of the trucks, and although they were told that they
could get into a lot of trouble if they took in too much of
what was happening, they had a quick look under the covering
and saw two dead bodies, alien bodies.
We really had to giggle at that bit.  He said they were
smaller than a normal man, about four feet, and had much
larger heads than us, with slanted eyes, and that the bodies
looked yellowish, a bit Asian-looking.  We did not believe
him when we were kids, but as I got older, I did kind of
believe it.  Once I asked him if he was scared by them, and
he said, "Hell no, they looked nice, almost as though they
would be friendly if they were alive."
5.11  Pappy Henderson
[Captain Oliver Wendell "Pappy" Henderson was stationed at
Roswell AAF in 1947.  He had flown thirty missions in B-24
Liberator bombers in Europe.  He had participated in the
postwar A-bomb tests in the Pacific and earned major
commendations for his flying.  Unfortunately, he died before
any UFO investigator could interview him, but near the end
of his life he old some of the people closest to him about
what he had seen in July 1947.]
