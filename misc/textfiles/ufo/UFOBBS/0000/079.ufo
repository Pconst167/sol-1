SUBJECT: AURORA NEW US SPY PLANE                             FILE: UFO79


Hi saw your msg re aurora perhaps I could provide some data on this.The usaf
denies the existence of aurora"jane"s editor bill sweetman says that it is
proberly one of the defence departments "black prodjects",a top secret prodjec
whose fundings is disguised in the defence procurement budget as one of
number of selected activities.Eight billion dollars has already gone into the
aircrafts development!
Knowledge of aurora first came from a 1986 defence department budget report
in which it was listed-apparently by mistake-next to the sr-71 blackbird and
the u-2,two air force spy planes.Analysts belive the new plane ,with a
distintive 66ft bat-wing design,is being prepered as a replacement for
blackbird,whitch retired from service in 1989.
in march 1992 aviation/weekly + space technology reported nightime sightings
of an unknown aircraft with a diamond-shaped lighting pattern near beale
air force base in yube county,califonia.It had a distinctive noise" like air
rushing through a big tube".Sweetman spectulated that it had been on a test
run from groom lake ,a research and development base near las vegas.I belive
that the sonic bangs that have been reported over scotland and europe could
be the aurora aircraft visual sightings have also be made from different parts
of the world.There have also been sonic bangs and sightings of strange lights
in the machrihanish region near the kintyre peninsula in argyll in november
1991.there is a joint NATO/RAF base at machrihanish,the airfeild is one of
the longest in europe?
It has played host to us f117a steath aircraft on nightime proveing flightsfrom nevada and to the sr-17 blackbirds.The "doughnuts on a rope " vapour
trails have been seen frequently across americathis year.The new trails ar
thought to arise from a new propulsion system,such as a pulse detonation
engine,developed from the pulse jet used on german v-1 flying bombs in the
1940s.
On the 16th march 1989 a mrs patricia anderson photographed a strange aircraft
over heathall wartime airfeild northeast of dumfries." It was oval shaped and
grey coloured, and much bigger than an raf tornado,with what I presume were
engine intakes looking like a pair of giant eyes as it approached.It was also very,very quiet" she reported the sighting to the C.A.A. (civil aviation
authority).Shortly afterwards,the police came round and interrogated her. the
local print shop told her that her film had come out blank?Later she was
informed by phone that she had see a top secret aircraft and should forget all
about it.(GLASGOW HERALD,8th sept 1992.
