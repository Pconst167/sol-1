SUBJECT: UfO Cover-Up ?                                      FILE: UFO135

PART 1

     UFO  Magazine was privileged--or is the word cursed?--to  be
let  in  on  the 'latest' inside information and  gossip  as  the
production of "UFO Cover-up? Live!" developed over the course  of
many  months in the latter part of 1988.  When the final  product
aired on October 14 of that year, it was both more and less  than
expected  by  the UFO Community--enlightening  some,  frustrating
many,  and throwing most of us back into that  endless,  spinning
circle  of  rumor  and speculation as to just  who  sits  at  the
controls  when UFO information breaks into big media.   Barry  E.
Taff  was the original writer hired to prepare the treatment  and
screenplay  for  the  show.   The  following  is  his  first-hand
impression  of  what transpired over the course  of  "UFO  Cover-
up..."   Though based on real events, the opinions  he  expresses
should not be taken as reflecting those of either ParaNet or  UFO
Magazine--Vicki Cooper/ASK UFO

            "UFO Cover-Up? Live!":  The Untold Story

                        by Barry E. Taff

     During the course of development and production of the  two-
hour,  prime-time  LBS syndicated special "UFO  Cover-Up?  Live!"
wild  and  unsubstantiated rumors circulated throughout  the  UFO
community  about what was happening, particularly in  regards  to
what (or who) the sources of information were and who was calling
the shots behind the scenes.

     As  the original writer for that much discussed show, I  can
reveal  some  rather  startling,   although  perhaps   less-than-
sensational  truths about what REALLY occurred during the  course
of  the  production,  and  why  the  resulting  program  was   an
amateurish  attempt at trying to chronicle and  document  current
events and the history of ufology.

     I  was  hired  at  a salary  well  below  scale,  which  was
acceptable  at  the time, for we all believed that  this  program
would be the chance of a lifetime, especially considering some of
the  creative staff:  Tracy Torme, Curt Brubaker, Bob  Emenegger,
Marty  (J.R.) Pasetta, Jr.  During my initial interview  for  the
job,  I  found  the producer to be extremely  friendly  and  very
concerned that the end product of the show reflect a high caliber
of writing regarding the show's topic or premise.

     The  situation couldn't have sounded any better,  and  given
the involvement of associate and segment producers whom I already
knew  and  had worked with, along with UFO  consultants  such  as
William Moore, Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, it was  truly
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

     However,  after  being  told  that  the  show's  budget  was
approximately  $1,250,000.00  only  later to learn  that  it  was
closer  to $825,000.00, I began to worry that things  weren't  as
they   seemed.   As  the  show  progressed  in  development   and
production,  I discovered that I was hired for my vast  knowledge
of  Ufology's  history, related technology  and  current  events.
Although  as it turned out, this zeal was not shared in  entirety
by the show's producer.

     As  we began to choose the sources of information and  those
individuals  we  wished  to be associated with  the  show,  based
entirely  on  the validity, accuracy and what we believed  to  be
corroborating  evidence of their information,  incredible  rumors
began to flourish that the show was being run and/or  manipulated
by insiders who were supposedly government intelligence  officers
from such agencies as CIA, NSA or even MJ-12.  This matter became
so comical that the creative staff made up a batch of "MJ" cards,
ranging  from one through twelve, and pasted one on each  of  our
desks just to get a laugh when visitors came to the offices.
