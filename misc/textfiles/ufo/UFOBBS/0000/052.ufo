PART 3 OF 3

     "I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was the
first of  the  astronauts to use the code name  'Santa  Claus'
to indicate  the  presence  of flying  saucers  next  to space
capsules. However, his announcements were barely noticed by the
general  public. It was a little different  when James Lovell
on board the Apollo 8 command module came  out from behind  the
moon and said for everybody to hear: 'PLEASE BE INFORMED  THAT
THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.'  Even  though this happened on
Christmas Day 1968, many people sensed a hidden meaning in those
words."

    Rumors  persist. NASA may well be a civilian agency, but
many of its  programs  are funded by the defence budget and most
of the astronauts  are subject to military security regulations.
Apart from the fact that the National Security Agency screens
all films and probably radio communications as well. We have the
statements by  Otto Binder, Dr. Garry Henderson and Maurice
Chatelain that the  astronauts  were under strict orders not  to
discuss their sightings.  And Gordon Cooper has testified to a
United Nations committee that one of the astronauts actually
witnessed a UFO on the ground.  If there is no secrecy, why has
this  sighting not been made public?

    A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was
engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA
symposium.
Professor:       What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11?

Armstrong:     It  was incredible, of course we had always
                 known there  was  a possibility, the fact  is,
                 we were warned  off!(by the Aliens). There was
                 never any question then of a space station or a
                 moon city.

Professor:       How do you mean "warned off"?

Armstrong:     I can't go into details, except to say that
                 their ships  were far superior to ours both in
                 size and technology  - Boy, were they
                 big!...and menacing!
                 No, there is no question of a space station.
Professor:       But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?

Armstrong:     Naturally  - NASA was committed at that time,
                 and couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really
                 was a quick scoop and back again.

Armstrong  confirmed  that the story was true but refused  to
go into further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind
the cover-up.
