SUBJECT: Aurora Flies in Scotland                            FILE: UFO36

        According to the Sunday Post newspaper on 9th May 1993
above the golf course by RAF Macnrihanish near Campbletown, not
far from the tip of the Kintyre peninsula flies the American top
secret new spy plane.

        This was first spotted flying high over the North Sea in
1989, the plane's existence has never been officially admitted by
the American authorities.

        They were equally secretive when the Stealth bomber also
used Machrihanish for secret trials before it took part so
devastatingly in the Gulf War.

        The New York Times, Jane's Defence Weekly and the US
magazine Aviation Week have all reported that the aircraft
exists.

        It is known as PROJECT AURORA.

        Oil rig engineer Chris Gibson is reported to have claimed
to have seen the aircraft from the rig Galveston Key. Gibson, a
part-time member of the Royal Observer Corps, saw the dart-shaped
plane taking on fuel from a US Air Force Tanker.

        First word of it using Macrihanish came when a report
filtered out about an RAF radar man picking up an unidentified
craft travelling at three times the speed of sound near the
Kintyre peninsula.

        Locals started querying terrific sonic booms ripping
through the sky near the base.

        Then the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute
investigated earth tremors and strange shock waves across the
Friesian coast, and said the probable cause was the sonic boom
from an aircraft flying at a speed of 4000mph.

        Machrihanish has the longest military runway in Europe
and the US is to invest œ7 million in the base.

        Moreover, the US's secret or black budget has pumped $8
million into Lockheed Corporation's ultra-high security Skunk
works in the California desert, believed to be for project Aurora.

        Aurora's task would be to fill in the fine detail of
observations by the spy satellites the US uses for routine
reconnaissance.

        Like the stealth bomber it would be capable of defying
alomost any radar system.

        Add it all up and there's little doubt about the most
curious birdie at Machrihanish golf course these days.
