SUBJECT: EXTRATERRESTRIAL INSECTS AT UFO LANDING SITE        FILE: UFO69


A LEADING RESEARCHER CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND A PAIR OF SPACE ALIEN BUGS
AT A UFO LANDING SITE - BUT HERE'S THE CLINCHER.
DR. PAUL FARNER HAS STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL
BUGS ESCAPED FROM THE STARSHIP AND ARE NOW BREEDING LIKE FLIES IN THE
ARIZONA DESERT.
THE INSECTS LOOK LIKE FLYING CRAB CLAWS AND HAVE POWERFUL, CRUSHING
JAWS THAT ENABLE THEM TO EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS, INCLUDING RAW MEAT,
BITS OF METAL AND OTHER BUGS.
IN SPITE OF THEIR SINISTER APPEARANCE, THE EXPERT SAYS THEY ARE AS SMART,
LOYAL AND OBEDIENT AS DOGS - AND WILL CLEARLY MAKE GOOD PETS.
I SIMPLY CANNOT OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY, SAID FARNER,
WHO CAPTURED THE INSECTS AT AN ALLEGED UFO LANDING SITE WEST OF PHOENIX
IN LATE OCTOBER.
THE BUGS THAT WE HAVE IN CAPTIVITY ARE NOT ONLY GROWING BY LEAPS AND
BOUNDS, THEY ARE LAYING EGGS AS FAST AS WE CAN COUNT THEM AND GIVING US
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY ALIEN LIFEFORMS.
THERE WAS INITIAL CONCERN THAT THE INSECTS WOULD WREAK HAVOC WITH OUT
ENVIRONMENT AND ECOLOGY BUT MY OBSERVATIONS ARE PROVING OTHERWISE.
THE BUGS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DESTRUCTIVE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
MY GUESS IS THAT THEY WILL TURN OUT TO BE A BOON TO OUR PLANET IF THEY
ARE BREEDING IN THE WILD.
FARNER'S REPORT SENT SHOCK WAVES THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND
TOUCHED OFF A CONTROVERSY THAT IS SURE TO RAGE FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS
TO COME.
INSECT SPECIALISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED ACCESS
TO THE BUGS.
BUT FARNER REFUSED, SAYING THAT MY RESEARCH - NOT PROFESSIONAL COURTESY
COMES FIRST.
THE EXPERT SAYS HE FOUND THE BUGS FLYING IN ERRATIC BUT COMPLETE CIRCLES
AT AN ALLEGED UFO LANDING SITE ON OCTOBER 29.
HE CAPTURED THE INSECTS AND TOOK THEM BACK TO HIS LABORATORY, WHERE CAT
SCANS AND OTHER SOPHISTICATED TESTS SHOWED THEM TO HAVE ONLY ONE
INTERNAL ORGAN AND NO BLOOD OR BODY FLUIDS AT ALL.
THEIR BODIES ARE AS HARD AS STEEL AND FOUR, GLOBULAR EYES THEY HAVE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR HEADS LITERALLY GIVE THEM 360 DEGREE VISION,
SAID FARNER. EVEN STRANGER, THE BUGS ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THEIR SURRO-
UNDINGS AND SEEM TO BE AS LOYAL, OBEDIENT AND INTELLIGENT AS DOGS.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO NOW IS DEVISE A WAY TO TEST THEM FOR INTELLIGENCE,
HE ADDED.
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG THESE THINGS WILL LIVE. FOR
ALL I KNOW THEY COULD DIE TOMORROW - OR SURVIVE FOR YEARS.
FARNER'S BELIEF THAT OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL INSECTS ESCAPED INTO THE
ENVIRONMENT IS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS HE MADE AT THE UFO LANDING SITE
ITSELF.
IF THESE BUGS ARE LOOSE IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE KNOW IT, SAID THE
EXPERT.
THEY SEEM TO LIKE HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP AND GIVEN ENOUGH TIME, THEY
COULD TURN UP IN EVERY HOME IN AMERICA.
