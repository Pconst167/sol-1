SUBJECT: Sighting at Air Show UK                             FILE: UFO86


I have read your bulls on the subject of UFO sightings. I thought
I'd send you my own experience of seeing something odd, I won't
claim it as a genuine UFO, particulary as it's "presence" brought
no noticable reaction from the RAF, it could have been a trick of
the light on high cloud, but it certainly looked solid.I have
always found the subject interesting but have never classed
myself as a "believer", I prefer to think I have an open mind.I
am very interested in aircraft and a regular pilgrimage is to the
bi-annual airshow held at RAF Valley on Anglesey. One of the shows

held six years ago was on a particularly good day, the weather was

ideal, almost totally clear skies with only a few very high wispy
clouds. The show had been underway for some time with all types of

aircraft flying at various altitudes, plenty of time to assess
visibility and the effects of distance etc.

During a lull in the display I was scanning the skies trying to
spot the arrival of the next aircraft when I spotted what I could
only describe as a "bar" very high, immediately overhead. I first
thought it was the wing of an aircraft but I couldn't see a
fuselage, I looked through my binoculars but could see no more.
The object was a perfectly straight line with slightly rounded
ends and was motionless,this I could judge by it's position
relative to the few small clouds in the vicinity. The object was
light coloured, white or silver and very high, this I could
judge by the fact that it's distance was causing a "blueing" of
the colour, an effect I had noted on planes in the display when
flying at maximum altitude (watch any commercial airliner flying
high on a clear day & you'll see what I mean). Being able to
judge it's altitude I could also estimate it's size which was
extremely large, as big as a commercial airliner or bigger.An
interesting point was that all planes which had achieved enough
altitude for the "blueing" to occur had also left a vapour trail,
this object had none.

I observed the object for about five minutes and brought it to
the attention of my family, I also noticed quite a number of
groups near to us also looking at, pointing and photographing the
object (I had run out of film).

After about five minutes I noticed a change in the object, it
appeared to be changing shape, becoming "fatter" in the centre,
more of an oval than a bar. Slowly it continued to change until I
realised that what I had been looking at was the edge or rim of a
circle which was now turning to present itself "full face". The
object now appeared to be a ring with no centre (like a Polo
Mint), although the centre may have been of a darker colour which
corresponded with the blue of the sky. The object remained in
this position for a further minute or so until one of the few
clouds in the sky drifted slowly over it's position. When the
cloud passed by, prehaps some five minutes later, the object had
gone. During the whole of the time the object had not changed
it's position in the sky.
