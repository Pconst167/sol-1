SUBJECT: THE ILKLEY MOOR ALIEN ABDUCTION                     FILE: UFO75

PART 2

You remember in part 1 you were told of a compass that had gone wrong due to
its polarity being reversed.well the man who we took it to is DR Spooner at
manchester university umist dept of electrical engineering.So how did the
compass become reversed?Dr Spooner did not have a ready answer he began very
simply by exposeing the compass to strong magnets but althought they deflected
the needle the effect ceased as soon as the magnets were moved away.a steady
magnetic field had no permanent effect.Dr Spooner and his assistant had
experimented with a rapidly applied,or "pulsed",magnetic field.eventally it
was found that this indeed would reverse the needle and back again under
laboratory conditions.This was fine but could the reversal brought about with
out recourse to such expensive and complex equipment?Dr Spooner showed it could
albeit with a certain risk to life  and property. a piece of wire was coiled
round one hand the the commpass was placed within it the ends were then
connected to the main electricity supply and a switch was thrown.There was a
bang ,but yes the polarity was changed north to south. this of course could be
done in the house althought at the very least fuses would be blown and there
was also the more serious prospect  of createting  an electrical fire. also
would jon have known how to carry out this dangerous process when Dr Spooner
an expert in his field - did not? In a report done by Dr Spooner whitch in
part said " It appears to be a relatively simple matter to bring about the
reversal without the need for any special equipment and may be accomplished
in the average house or garage.The intensity required is not great by some
standards; in fact we could not produce a field sufficiently low as not to
reverse the polarity  of the needle. The minumum field we applied had a flux
density of about 0.1 Tesla; this is still 2000 times greater than the earths
field (therefore)the required intensity is very large by other standards to
leave detectable magnetisation in samples of rock around the area where the
craft had been.
PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The picture that was took of the creature was taken to kodak peter suthurst
was the man who we talked to and who did the analysis of the picture after
about 2 weeks he contacted us and said as far as he could see the negative
was a first exposure negative and had not been  interfered with in any way
in his opinion.
With the examination of the compass,and the photo,our thoughts turned to the
missing time it was about one hour forty minutes that jon had lost.how?
I was determined to find out! So I got in contact with a Dr jim singleton
who was a clinical psychologist at a hospital at preston. We arranged for jon
to have a formal meeting with mr singleton at arthur tomlinsons home this was
16th march 1987 Dr singleton took jon over what was entailed alieing a lot of
jons misconceptions about hypnosis.we made a date the following week to do the
hypnotic regression session with jon.one person was also present in the room
with mr singleton he was mathew hill a journalist friend of mine he was to
opperate the three tape recorders.here is the whole transcript jim singleton
is abbreviated js and jon is j.
js I want you to cast your mind back to the 1st december last year when you
set off across the moor. I want you to clear your mind back to that and I want
you to re-experience that.I want you to tell me what you experienced.
j. Im walking along the moor,oh! its quite windy.theres a lot of clouds.walkin
up towards some trees.I see this little something ,can"t tell,but he"s green
it"s moveing up towards me.(we later found out that jon had took the photo
after his abduction and the creature was waveing goodbye)Oh! Im stuck I can"t
move and the creature still comeing towards me.Im stuck and everthing gone
fuzzy. Im,Im floating  along in the air I want to get down! (he later told us
he was levitated 2 feet off the ground and the creature was in front of him
like a child pulling a balloon on a string).
Im still can"t get down and I dont like it.Im going round this corner and this
green thing is in front of me. Oh God! I want to get down!(long pause)(
(breathing faster)There"s a "theres a big silver saucer thing there"s a doorin
it.and I don"t want to go in there.(worried sound in his voice)(sigh)everythin
gone black now (pause)
J S  you say everything gone black?
J  Mmmm! I can"t see anything  like Im asleep,can"t hear anything.(short pause
there"s a bright light now.canT see where it"s comeing from? Im in a funny sor
of room I can hear this voice saying don"t be afraid.I don"T feel afraid
anymore.I can still see this green thing but Im not afraid anymore of it.
Im being put on a table.I can move now if I want to, but I don"t feel frighten
d any more and there"s a beam like a pole it"s above me it"s moveing up toward
me. It"s got a light in it like a fluorescent tube. I  its comeing up from my
feet I can hear that voice again saying "we dont mean to harm you  and don"t
be afraid.makes me feel warm as it moves up me its comeing up over my stomach
towards my head. close my eyes I dont want to look at it in case it hurts my
eyes.its gone!(pause)theres something my nose feels funny(shows movment of
nose) thats gone as well,Im standing up now I dont know how I got stood up?
I can see a doortheres one  of these green creatures motioning for me to come
with him. dont relly want to go with him Id rather stay here I dont feel afrai
in here(pause).
JS  can you tell me whats happening now?
J  Im walking towards a door theres still a bright light  theres light all
around  want to know where its comeing from its just bright all around.walking
down a corridor theres a window. Oh! God!(sounds shocked)is that real?(deep
sigh) (pause) (sounds afraid) dont want to be up here want to be down there? I
can hear that voice again saying you"ve got nothing to fear. Its pretty though
didn"t realize it looked so pretty.(What jon was looking at through the window
was the earth seen from high in space just like the appollo astronauts saw.
Iv gone past the window now I"m walking down a corridor(long pause)
JS whats happening now?
J come to the end of the corridor. There"s a hole opened in it so I can walk
through. Im in a big room-a big round room Im on a raised platform against
the wall. my camera and compass are trying to get away from me.going towards
the ball. Its difficult to pull them back down again,and this balls moveig
round with strange its got some blocks on it he says we cant stay in here to long he
wants us to go out again the holes closed in the wall  its gone strange he
says i"ve got nothing to fear but  Id still like to go home (pause) its got
such big hands.
JS  whats happening now?
J  going down a corridor again. its very bright still I wish  I knew where
the light was comeing from. and theres"s another door,going through a door
it"s an empty room two of those green creatures have come with me.
there"s a picture ,it"s starting to move on the wall wonder how they get the
pictures?
JS  can you tell me whats happening at this point?
J Im  looking at the pitures on the wall.(long pause)
JS  pictures on the wall?
J  Mmmm.  creatures seem concerned at the damage that its doing.picture
changeing now there"s another picture,another filmhe"s asking me a question
he says do you understand? I said yes.its time to go everything gone black
Im walking up the moor again  Im walking near some trees some movement-I can
see something.a green creature. Iv shouted to it its tuned round. I don"t
know what it is I"ll photograph it  its turned around now its moveing quick
want to know what it is. Im running after it,its gone round a corner, I can"t
see it now. there"s .. theres a saucer(laughingly) big silver saucer!its
disappeared?Im walking on down gone past the trees.
JS  whats happening now?
J  Im going home. its ten o" clock on the town hall clock.can"t relly
understand it was only eight "o clock.
JS  you mentioned  some green creatures.would you try to describe them to me?
J  its quite small he"s got big pointed ears,its got big eyes.they"re quite
dark  he hasn"t got a nose he"s only got a little mouth.and his hands are
enormous.and his arms are long.he"s got funny feet.
JS  funny feet?
J  they"re like a v shape like two big toes must be difficult to walk like
that.he shuffles rather than walks.I don"t feel afraid of him although he
looks odd.
JS   you mentioned big hands ? can you say anymore about the hands?
J  it"s got three big fingers,like sausages.big sausages.they"re just very
big bigger than my hands.
JS  about how tall would you say these creatures are?
J  its about four foot.comes to the lump on my stomach.he"s about as high as-
just a bit bigger than my stomachis.
JS   okay. now I wonder if I can ask you another question?
you mentioned a film?
J  there were two films
JS  two films?
J   one was lots of scenes of destruction like on the news  can see lots of
waste    going into the river,and people like ethio-pians  who are starving
its not very good,its not very nice
JS  want to say anything more about that film/
J  its much of the same thing,only different.
JS  what about the other filmthen? do you want to tell me about it?
J  Im not supposed to.
JS  I"ll  leave that up to you entirely,do you want to say anything about that
J  Im   not supposed to tell anyone about the other film,its not for them to
know.
JS  is there any thing more?
J  no
