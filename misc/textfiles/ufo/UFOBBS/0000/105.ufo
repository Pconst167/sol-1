1  INTRODUCTION



1.1  Document Description

A flying saucer crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.
This document contains testimony from people who were
closely associated with this incident.

Most of the testimony in this document is from the 1992 book
"Crash at Corona" by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner,
published in the United States by Paragon House.  That book
contains lots of other interesting material, including
material regarding another crash site in New Mexico.  That
book is the source of all testimony in this document except
where noted.
