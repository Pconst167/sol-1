NASA:     Whats there?
          Mission Control calling Apollo 11...

Apollo11: These "Babies" are huge, Sir! Enormous!
          OH MY GOD! You wouldn't believe it!
          I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there,
          Lined up on the far side of the crater edge!
          They're on the Moon watching us!

    In  1979 Maurice Chatelain, former chief of  NASA
Communications Systems  confirmed that Armstrong had indeed
reported seeing two UFOs on the rim of a crater. "The encounter
was common knowledge in  NASA,"  he revealed, "but nobody has
talked  about  it until now."

    Soviet  scientists  were  allegedly  the  first  to  confirm
the incident.  "According  to  our  information,  the encounter
was reported  immediately after the landing of the module," said
Dr.  Vladimir  Azhazha,  a physicist and Professor of
Mathematics at Moscow University. "Neil Armstrong relayed the
message to Mission Control  that  two large, mysterious objects
were  watching them after  having landed near the moon module.
But his  message was never heard by the public - because NASA
censored it.  "According to another Soviet scientist, Dr.
Aleksandr Kazantsev, Buss Aldrin took  color  movie film of the
UFOs from inside the module, and continued  filming them after
he and Armstrong went outside.  Dr.  Azhazha   claims  that  the
UFOs departed  minutes  after the astronauts came out on to the
lunar surface.

    Maurice   Chatelain  also  confirmed  that  Apollo   11's
radio transmissions  were interrupted on several occasions in
order to hide  the  news from the public.  Before dismissing
Chatelain's sensational claims, it is worth noting his
impressive background in the aerospace industry and space
program. His first job after moving  from France was as an
electronics engineer with Convair, specializing in
telecommunications, telemetry and radar. In 1959 he was in
charge of an electromagnetic research group, developing new
radar  and telecommunications systems for Ryan. One  of his
eleven patents was an automatic radar landing system that
ignited retro  rockets  at  a  given altitude, used  in  the
Ranger and Surveyor flights to the Moon. Later, at North
American Aviation, Chatelain  was  offered  the job of designing
and  building the Apollo communications and data-processing
systems.

    Chatelain  claims  that  "all  Apollo  and  Gemini  flights
were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite
closely, by space  vehicles of extraterrestrial origin - flying
saucers, or UFOs,  if  you  want to call them by that name.
Every  time it occurred,  the  astronauts  informed Mission
Control,  who then ordered absolute silence." He goes on to
