PART 2

Tony's lost over three stone in the past three years. Now he's
almost too weak to dress himself and he often gets breathless when he
tries to speak.

   Looking after him is a full-time occupation for Sue, who admits:
"Sometimes I think I can't go on." The family live on social security,
a disability allowance and child benefit totalling 126 a week. The
boys worry about and sometimes resent their dad's mysterious illness.
"It isn't fair on them," says Sue. "On bad days they can't even put on
a light without upsetting him." But her main complaint is that no one
will take them seriously, although this isn't strictly true.

   Last October, Sue contacted the Ministry of Defence, who referred
the case to the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). As a
result, Ken Phillips, a UFO investigator with 23 years experience,
visited the Burfields last November. He says: "Tony is suffering from
the same trauma as other victims of UFO encounters. It's quite common
to get reports of burning sensations. Tony's other symptoms are
unusual but all cases are different. His story is consistent and I see
no reason, at this stage, to disbelieve it. It's obvious that he's a
very sick man. It's hard to accept little is being done to help him
medically."

   Tony first contacted his doctor about his condition in 1990. Now
he says his only medication consists of painkillers and anti-sickness
tablets, which have little effect on his condition. In 1990 he spent
six months in a phychiatric hospital, but his s symptoms didn't
improve. However BUFORA hope to arrange for him to be seen by a
clinical psychologist.

   Tony's GP, Dr Ann Read, wasn't willing to comment on the case or
on Tony's claim that he's suffering from radiation sickness. However,
Jill Wilkinson, of the National Radiological Protection Board, was
more forthcoming. "It doesn't sound like classic radiation sickness
which is caused by leakage from a nuclear reactor," she says. "It
sounds a bit like a condition suffered by people who are particularly
sensitive to the the non-ionising radiation given off by all
electrical appliances." Whatever it is, Tony's terrified. "I'm dying,
No one knows how I feel," he says. "I'm going to die in a way no
one's died before." Sue tries to reassure him, saying: "Of course
you're going to get well again." But she doesn't sound very convinced.
