PART 1

   The story of a man, a fled the vacuum cleaner.
Sue, 39, is trying to explain the situation, apologise and justify
herself all at once. "He gets terrible pains whenever I switch on
electrical appliances," she says despairingly. "But you were coming
and I felt really ashamed because the room looked a a mess."

   Sue's the first to admit - taking into account two sons and four
dogs - that her house isn't exactly immaculate. It's the first time
she's vacuumed for six months. Because of Tony's illness she usually
has to use a brush to sweep up. Sue rarely uses s her tumble drier
or electric kettle either. "The vacuum's the worst," Tony says. "I
feel as if my head's being pushed down and my teeth are being
squeezed out of my mouth." And although he can watch a black and
white television without feeling pain,  he can't watch colour.

   Tony, also 39, suffers from some other strange complaints, too.
He often feels he's suffocating, gets frequent burning sensations
in his body and a metallic taste in his mouth. He's allergic to many
foods and has difficulty swallowing. His diet conssists mainly of
tomatoes and oranges. He's so weak he spends nearly all his time
lying on the sofa. Stranger still, he believes his condition is
caused by radiation sickness as a result of - wait for it - getting
too close to a UFO in 1988.

   Tony and Sue from Bridgewater, Somerset, have been married for 18
years. Their three sons, Simon (who's left home), Daniel and Shane,
are 18, 16 and 9. Tony feels so ill that he's often irritable with
the boys and complains of violent pain whenever they play video
games.

   Before the sighting, he was a different man, one who liked a beer
and country walks. "I was perfectly fit then," says the former
builder's mate who's now frighteningly thin and hasn't been able to
work for years.

   His troubles apparently began one beautiful May day during a
solitary walk in the Quantock Hills near his home. At about midday he
noticed a strange black dot in the sky. But although he began to feel
nervous as it came closer and lower he managed to photograph it. "It
was going at about five miles an hour," he says. "It stopped about 50
feet above my head and was massive - it completely blotted out the
sun. It had two wings which folded into the side when it stopped and
there were flashing lights and two decks with windows."

   Tony claims an alien appeared at one of the lower deck windows.
His memory of the experience is patchy - though this is a common
experience after UFO encounters, according to experts. "The alien I
saw seemed to be glowing and wore a helmet," Tony recalls. He
believes the alien communicated with him telepathically, apologising
because the craft had come too close to him. "I felt tremendous heat
go through my hands. I thought I'd been badly burnt. But there were
no marks," he remembers.

   After what seemed like five minutes the craft moved silently away.
In fact it was two hours. Why wasn't he more frightened? Tony's
incredible explanation is that he'd seen two UFO's before.

   In 1972 he was walking to the station early in the morning when he
saw strange lights in the sky near Wincanton, Somerset.

   Two years later he was camping near Bridgewater with Sue when they
saw a red, saucer shaped craft in the sky at night.

   All of which is astounding if true. Understandably, Tony was afraid
other people wouldn't believe him. He mentioned the 1988 sighting to a
friend, who laughed at him, and to Sue, who thought honesty wasn't the
best policy. "This is a small town," she says. "People don't think
things like that happen here when anyone
used the vacuum cleaner. Once when it was on I was thrown across the
room by what felt like an electric charge. Sometimes I felt as if I
was on fire. One day my shirt started to smell as if it were
scorching." His condition deteriorated during 1990. He began to hate
water and hasn't had a bath since. Tony does wash occasionally but
can't bear to be immersed in water.
