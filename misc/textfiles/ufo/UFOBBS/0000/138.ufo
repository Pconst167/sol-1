A transcript with [notes] of the second hour of the program.


Robert Pozzuoli Videotape
-----------------------------------------------------------------
June 24, 1984 videotaped a UFO over Brewster, NY
(Westchester-Putnam county).  He is vice president of a major
electronics firm in NYC.  The videotape shows a disclike object
with a string of 6 bright lights around it moving across the sky.
It then moved behind a pine tree and was lost to sight for 3 sec.
As it emerged from behind the tree, the object was different.  "We
now saw a string of multicolored lights in the shape of a disc with
a red light flashing behind it.  The lights appeared to be rotating.
Then they went behind some houses low on the horizon and vanished."
This UFO was also seen over the Indian Point Nuclear Reactor at
Buchanan, NY, just south of Peekskill.

[These events are discussed (with pictures and drawings) in Night
Siege, The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and
Philip Imbrogno with Bob Pratt.  A man identifying himself as an
NSC agent tried to obtain the tape.  He was told that the tape
would not be turned over to him or any organization until
investigators were assured of complete cooperation and exchange of
information in return.  "You know, Phil," he said, "the government
has done away with people for a lot less."  The October TV show
evidently used some footage from this videotape.  You could see the
circle of lights and blinking rear one, but the circle did not seem
to be rotating in the tape segment shown.  See CLOSE ENCOUNTER ON
I84 by P. Imbrogno in the December 1988 issue of Oddysey on-line
magazine available on Paranet Alpha (602) 837-0062; 2400 8 N 1

Sep 23, 1980 UFO Escorted by 23 Helicopters
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Betty Cash reported that it was a very cold night in the piney
woods of E. Texas.  "Vicki and I and her grandson were coming back
from playing Bingo.  Suddenly, little Colby noticed a bright light
in the sky above the pine trees.  A tremendous amount of heat was
coming from this diamond shaped thing.  Fire was coming out of the
bottom of it.  When it moved, it made a "swishing" sound and there
was a beeping the entire time, that I still hear in my mind at
night."  Vicki said, "All three of us got out of the car, then
Vicky & Colby got back in.  Betty continued, "I just stood there
terrifed for about ten minutes.  The object lit up the
surrounding pine woods like it was daylight.  I was burning, my
skin was burning.  The craft hovered over me about 20 minutes.
Fire was coming out of it like a blowtorch.  Then it lifted up and
flew over the trees."

Vicki said, "That was when the helicopters came out.  (Colby
counted 23 helicopters which they later identified as CH47 Chinok
military helicopters)  The roar was like a tornado."

Vicki said, "When we got home, I washed Colby off and put him to
bed.  When water touched his skin, he cried out like he had been
burned, as if he had been out in the sun too long." Betty Cash was
too sick to go to work the next day.  Betty continued, "My eyes
swelled closed, welts appeared on my face and head.  I thought I
was going to die.  Vicki came and took me to the ER of the hospital.
They treated me like a burn patient.  Over the next few days, I
lost big patches of skin on my face and about half my hair fell
out.  They kept me in the hospital for over a month with no
improvement." Photographs were shown of her arm.  She now has
cancer and had cancer surgery in Mar 1983 but the doctors couldn't
say whether they got it all.

A government intelligence agent (FALCON) told the TV journalists
that the craft observed was an alien craft piloted by military
aircraft pilots. Although they had been trained and were somewhat
familiar with the craft, they found that it would not respond to
certain controls and radioed that they believed it was going to
crash.  Standard military procedure regarding crashed aircraft is
to deploy search and rescue helicopters. These were following the
craft but it did not crash.  (Project SNOWBIRD)
