PART 11

5.5  F.B.
[F.B. was an Army Air Forces photographer stationed at
Anacostia Naval Air Station in Washington DC when he and
fellow photographer A.K. were flown aboard a B-25 bomber to
Roswell Army Air Field sometime during the second week of
July 1947.  F.B. was interviewed by Stanton Friedman.]
One morning they came in and they said, "Pack up your bags
and we'll have the cameras there, ready for you."  We didn't
know where we was going.
[After a few hours' flight, they arrived at Roswell.]  We
got in a staff car with some of the gear they had brought
along with us in trucks, and we headed out, about an hour
and a half, we was heading north.
We got out there [one of the crash sites in the Corona area]
and there was a helluva lot of people out there, in a closed
tent.  You couldn't hardly see anything inside the tent.
They said, "Set your camera up to take a picture fifteen
feet away."  A.K. got in a truck and headed out to where
they was picking up pieces.  All kinds of brass running
around.  And they was telling us what to do.  Shoot this,
shoot that.  There was an officer in charge.  He met us out
there and he'd go into the tent and he'd come back and tell
us, "OK."  He'd stand there right besides us and [say], "OK,
take this picture."
There was four bodies I could see when the flash went off,
but you was almost blind because it was a beautiful day,
sunny.  You'd go in this tent, which was awful dark.  That's
all I was taking, bodies.  These bodies was under a canvas,
and they'd open it up and you'd take a picture, flip out
your flashbulb, put another one in [take another picture]
and give him the film holder (each holder held two sheets of
four-by-five inch cut film) and then you went to the next
spot.
I guess there was ten to twelve officers, and when I got
ready to go in, they'd all come out.  The tent was about
twenty by thirty foot.  The bodies looked like they was
lying on a tarp.  One guy did all the instructions.  He'd
take a flashlight and he'd come down there.  "See this
flashlight?"  Yes sir.  "You're in focus with it?"  Yes sir.
"Take a picture of this."  He'd take the flashlight away.
We just moved around in a circle, taking pictures.  Seemed
to me [the bodies] were all just about identical.  Dark
complected.  I remember they was thin, and it looked like
they had too big of a head.  I took thirty shots.  I think I
had about fifteen [film] holders.  It smelled funny in
there.
A.K. came back in a truck that was loaded down with debris.
A lot of pieces sticking out that wasn't there when they
took off.  We got debriefed on the way back to the airport
[Roswell Army Air Field].  About four the next morning, they
woke us, they took us to the mess hall, we ate, we got back
on the B-25 and headed back.  When we got back to Anacostia
we got debriefed some more, by a lieutenant commander.  [It
was made clear to both F.B and A.K. that whatever they
thought they saw in New Mexico, they hadn't seen.]
