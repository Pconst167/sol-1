SUBJECT: UFO'S AND OUR GOVERNMENT'S CONCEALMENT              FILE: UFO88

PART 1

   What follows is a transcript of a 45 minute lecture that I at-
 tended on 11-17-89 at the "Whole Life Expo." in Los Angeles,
 California. Speaking was Mr. Milton William Cooper who I first
 became acquainted with through a text file I downloaded from a
 local computer BBS. The file dealt with the subject of UFO's and
 our government's concealment of the truth about them in such a
 way that it made a lasting impression on me, which is why I
 attended his lecture; to learn more. Please forgive my probable
 misspelling of some of the proper names in the transcript which
 follows and allow that I have taken it as best I could, word-
 for-word, from a less than acceptable micro-cassette recording.
   If you are as moved by what you are about to read as I was in
 hearing it first hand, I ask that you please spread it as far
 and wide as possible. Upload it to every BBS in your reach and
 please, don't change anything. Also, please give considerable
 thought to Mr. Cooper's suggestions as to what we all can do to
 see that this information is confirmed by our government to make
 them stop what they are up to.
                Thank you, and now, Milton Cooper:

   "For those of you who don't know who I am, I was raised in a
 military family. My family, my ancestors, since they came to
 this country, have been government people. We have served in the
 military, we have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,
 we care about this country and believe in the constitution of
 the United States. We know, as many people don't know, that the
 Constitution of the United States of America IS the United
 States of America! And that's why we've always been ready ...to
 do the things needed ...to preserve and protect it."
   "When I left home I went into the Air Force, the Strategic Air
 Command. As a child I'd heard stories from my father and pilots,
 other pilots, my father was a pilot, about Foo Fighters, UFO's,
 strange craft that were not made on this Earth. And as a kid,
 you hear that in passing, and it's neat, and you giggle about
 it, and you go out and play "Space Man", and you forget it."
   "When I was in the Air Force I met men who had participated in
 alien crashed-craft recoveries. Now this intrigued me, it in-
 terested me, but it was usually after quite a few bottles of
 beer that these stories would come out, and sometimes the next
 morning I couldn't remember what the heck the guy said."
   "When I left the Air Force I went into the Navy, and this is
 where everything began to happen for me. I had originally inten-
 ded to just go from service to service and do something that
 very few people have ever done before. I was a very adventurous,
 very crazy ...young man, and I thought that that would be a
 pretty exciting life. I volunteered for submarines, and while on
 the submarine U.S.S. Tyroot, SS-416, on a transit between the
 Portland/Seattle area and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port;
 the Pearl Harbor sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft,
 saucer-shaped, the size of a Midway class carrier, aircraft
 carrier, for those of you who don't know how big that is; it's
 huge, come up out of the water approximately 2 1/2 nautical
 miles off the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left of
 the pointy end of the submarine. It tumbled slowly on its own
 axis, and went up into the clouds. It appeared to be moving
 slowly to me at a distance of 2 1/2 nautical miles, but in
 reality it was moving pretty fast because it came up out of the
 water, did a few tumbles and it was gone!"
   "I then reported it to the officer of the deck. I didn't tell
 him what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no
 fools and in case nobody else saw it I didn't want to be the
 only looney onboard the ship. So I asked the officer of the deck
 to help me cover that area, and he did, which is common for of-
 ficers and lookouts to help each other while on bridge watch be-
 cause they all hang together if something bad happens. After a
 few seconds of watching, the same craft, or another craft exact-
 ly like it, came down out of the clouds, tumbled again on its
 own axis, and went into the water. Ensign Ball, who was the of-
 ficer of the deck, was literally shocked! What could I say? Sea-
 man Dejeralimo, who was the starboard lookout, had also witnes-
 sed this, and ensign Ball called the captain to the bridge who
 was followed by the chief quartermaster who brought a 35MM cam-
 era, and we watched for between 7 and 10 minutes the same craft,
 or different craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave
 the water. It was an incredible show. I don't know if they knew
 we were there, or if they even cared, but the craft did not
 glow, they were metal, they were machines without a doubt, they
 were obviously intelligently guided, they were HUGE, and having
 been in the Air Force and the Navy and knowing what it takes, I
 knew without a doubt, and know it today, that that machine was
 not made on the face of this Earth. Because there's nothing that
 man can make, that can fly through the air at a speed like that,
 tumble on its own axis, and enter the water and effectively fly
 beneath the sea."
