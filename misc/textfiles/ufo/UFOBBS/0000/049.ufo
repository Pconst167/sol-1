8.00pm - 8.30pm 30th November, 1992
The road from Newport Pagnell to Tathall End, a country lane.
My six year old son, Matthew was with me.
WX - Crystal clear with the odd scattered cloud, windy.


I was driving down this country lane when an object that was racing between
two clouds caught my attention. At first sight, I thought it was a spot
light shining up into the sky. For the first three or four miniutes it was
shaped like a squashed oval. It was several shades lighter than the clouds,
I could not describe it as being bright. It was very similar in texture to
that of a cloud, but it was dense enough for me not to be able to see
through it. It had patterns on it similar to those that are on the moon, it
was exactly the same size as the moon. The edges of it were not well defined,
but almost fluffy just like a cloud. I stopped the car and watched this
object. It was hiding behind a cloud and you could see it glowing through. I
then reasoned that it must be a helicopter as it shone a ray of light behind
the cloud several times longer than itself. The light moved around for a few
seconds, as if it was scanning the cloud, then this object flew out from the
cloud at a fantastic speed. It had now changed shape into a rough circle. My
son watched all this with me. It repeated this process several times,
shooting from left to right, stopping behind a cloud for about two miniutes,
shining the ray of light, then going from left to right again. The strange
thing is that other clouds were blowing away, the cloud this object was hiding
behind stayed in exactly the same place for half an hour. I felt that I needed
an adult witness, so drove a short distance to a cottage and asked the owner
to look at the sky with me. In the few miniutes that took, the cloud and
object had completly dissapeared. My son commented that it whenever we looked
at it, it went behind a cloud, but whenever we glanced away it came out - I
cannot say if he is right or not.
