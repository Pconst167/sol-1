SUBJECT: ALIEN'S ENDORSED PRESIDENT CLINTON                   FILE: UFO8


HOURS AFTER BILL CLINTON WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, A SPACE ALIEN WHO ENDORSED HIM IN HIS RUN FOR THE 
OVAL OFFICE TOOK HIM ON A TWO-MINUTE RIDE OVER WASHINGTON,D.C.
IN A SAUCER SHAPED UFO!
THAT'S THE WORD FROM AUTHOR AND UFO EXPERT NATHANIEL DEAN,
WHO SAYS THAT CLINTON BOARDED THE HUGE 164 FOOT STAR SHIP AT
A SECRET LANDING SITE NEAR HIS HOME IN LITTLE ROCK,ARK. AT
5:37 A.M. ON NOVEMBER 4 FOR THE HISTORIC TOUR OF THE NATION'S
CAPITAL, AND LATER SAID: ASIDE FROM GETTING ELECTED PRESIDENT,
THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.
THIS EXTRATERRESTRIAL IS NO STRANGER TO AMERICAN POLITICS,
BUT TAKING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON A UFO IS
ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT PRECEDENT, SAID DEAN, WHO HAS BEEN TRACKING
THE ALIEN'S INVOLVEMENT IN U.S. POLITICS THROUGH INTELLIGENCE
SOURCES SINCE IT MET WITH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH AT CAMP DAVID
IN APRIL 1991.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE ALIEN WAS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH
CLINTON ON ELECTION DAY AND ASKED HIM TO BOARD THE STAR SHIP
FOR A VICTORY TOUR OF WASHINGTON LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER ALL
THE POLLS HAD CLOSED.
CLINTON WAS UNDERSTANDABLY RELUCTANT TO CLAIM VICTORY AT THAT
POINT.
BUT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HE WAS WIN-
NING A LANDSLIDE ELECTORAL VOTE, HE AGREED TO MEET THE ALIEN
AT AN UNDISCLOSED LANDING SITE NEAR LITTLE ROCK FOR THE FOUR-
MINUTE FLIGHT TO WASHINGTON AND BACK, WHICH INCLUDED A TWO-
MINUTE TOUR OF THE CAPITAL ITSELF.
THE LOGISTICS WERE TRICKY BECAUSE CLINTON COULDN'T ALLOW HIS
SECURITY TEAM ANYWHERE NEAR THE SITE. I'M TOLD THAT HE SLIPPED
PAST HIS OWN GUARDS WITH THE HELP OF A TRUSTED AIDE, AND DE-
SPITE THE RISK, MADE THE HISTORIC UFO FLIGHT ALONE.
CLINTON'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ALIEN REMAINS SHROUDED IN
MYSTERY, HE ADDED.
BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT IN SAYING THAT THE ALIEN HAS THE PRESI-
DENT'S EAR - AND MIGHT EVEN BE IN LINE FOR A GOVERNMENT POST.
SPOKESMEN FOR CLINTON EXPRESSED A TOTAL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT THE SECRET UFO FLIGHT BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE PRESI-
DENT ELECT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAS FORGED AN EXTREMELY 
STRONG FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL SINCE THE 
CREATURE ENDORSED HIS CANDIDACY AFTER A SECRET, 40-MINUTE
MEETING DURING THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION LAST AUGUST.
CLINTON HIMSELF, APPARENTLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY REPORTERS 
WHO QUERIED HIM ABOUT THE FLIGHT, HESITATED BRIEFLY BEFORE
SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE A FULL STATEMENT AND EXPLANATION
AFTER HIS INAUGURATION IN JANUARY. I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK
FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT MR. CLINTON'S STATEMENT SEEMS TO 
SUGGEST THAT THE ALIEN IS GOING TO FIGURE PROMINENTLY
IN AMERICA'S FUTURE, DECLARED DEAN, WHO NOTED THAT CONTRARY
TO RUMOR, CLINTON PROBABLY DID NOT THROW UP DURING THIS UFO
FLIGHT.
SOME PEOPLE AREN'T THRILLED WITH THE IDEA OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL
HAVING ACCESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE ADDED.
BUT JUDGING FROM THE TRUST AND TIME THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON
SEEMS TO BE LAVISHING ON THIS CREATURE, THEY'D ALL BETTER GET 
USED TO HAVING HIM AROUND.
