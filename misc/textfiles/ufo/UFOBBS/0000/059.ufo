SUBJECT: CLOSE ENCOUNTER                                     FILE: UFO59

PART 1

   Housewife Linda Jones, 49, considers herself to be an
ordinary person. She is married to Trevor, who works as a
heating engineer, and they have two children.  One August
evening 13 years ago, she was out walking with her daughter and
son, aged 15 and five, collecting wild flowers along the banks
of a local river. She was bending down looking at a plant when
her son suddenly said, "Look Mum, the moon's coming towards us."
    Linda saw an orange and pink ball of light heading towards
them.  "We all ducked really low in the grass," she recalls.
"There was no noise, and at the last moment the object shot off
to the right. It went over two hills and then appeared to drop
vertically onto a field. I thought it was a plane on fire, so we
started to run towards it.  We got to within 30 metres and we
could see this massive white light with an under-structure like
a bridge, made of what looked like a mesh material," Linda says.
    "It was hovering about a metre off the ground and appeared
to have no windows or doors. It seemed to be as light as a
feather, even though it was about 18 metres across.  "Normally,
I'd run away from any danger, but I felt myself being drawn
towards it. My daughter was terrified and kept shouting, "Come
away, Mum!" But my son was quite calm.
    "As we were watching, the object kept appearing and
disappearing - it was really weird.  Eventually, we turned
around and ran off. But as we ran, the grass blew over in front
of us and the thing just followed us.
    "The object then disappeared, but shortly afterwards we
spotted it trailing a plane that was about to land at the nearby
airport."  When she got home, Linda found the skin under her
eyes was burned and scaly. She and her daughter also had violet
scars on their left legs.
    Eighteen months later, Harry Harris, the lawyer who works
with Roy Lake, contacted Linda and persuaded her and her
daughter to be hypnotised. They gave their consent and, while
under hypnosis, were videotaped. Both related the same chain of
events.  "I was running downhill and bumped into a tall human
figure, then everthing blurred," Linda says on one of the
videotapes.
    "I then experienced a sensation of floating. Next I was on a
table being examined and I had a feeling of ice being put on my
legs. There were six very tall people who looked like clones.
They wore dark overalls up to their necks, their hair was dark
and their eyes were black and almond-shaped."
    Linda still cannot consciously recall this event. We have
not named her children because her son is terrified of reliving
the sighting  and, although now a teenager, he sleeps with the
light on.  Linda's daughter is now married and refuses even to
discuss the subject because she is afraid that people will mock
her.
    After the incident, Linda's periods stopped (she was 36
years old), and she has since had problems with a lump in her
neck that keeps appearing a disappearing. "I even went into
hospital to have the lump removed. When the surgeon came for a
last check, he found it had disappeared, so the operation was
cancelled. At the moment, it's back.  I feel like an idiot
because I know all this is not normal," Linda says.
    "I just wish more people who have had similar experiences
would come forward, because it would help me feel easier about
the whole thing."    XX
