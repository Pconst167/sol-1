SUBJECT: UFO REPAIR MANUAL                                   FILE: UFO7


GERMAN SCIENTISTS CLAIM TO HAVE FOUND A UFO REPAIR MANUAL THAT 
WILL HELP THEM BUILD A FLYING SAUCER AND MASTER INTERGALACTIC 
FLIGHT BY 1995.
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO BUILD A STAR SHIP IS RIGHT HERE AT OUR
FINGERTIPS, ASTROPHYSICIST PETER KRAMER TOLD REPORTERS AT A NEWS
CONFERENCE IN FRANKFURT.
THIS MANUAL CONTAINS ALL THE BLUEPRINTS AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION 
WE NEED TO BUILD AN EQUIP AN EXTREMELY ADVANCED STAR SHIP OF OUR
OWN. 
THE TECHNOLOGY FAR SURPASSES ANYTHING EVER BEFORE SEEN ON EARTH.
BUT THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE CAN DUPLICATE IT. WE'RE
ALREADY CONDUCTING TESTS AND BUILDING COMPONENTS.
I DON'T THINK I'M BEING OVER AMBITIOUS TO PREDICT THAT WE'LL 
HAVE A FLYING PROTOTYPE NO LATER THAN 1995.
KRAMER REFUSED TO SAY WHERE THE UFO MANUAL WAS FOUND AND ACTUALLY 
CUT THE NEWS CONFERENCE SHORT WHEN REPORTERS PRESSED FOR COPIES. 
BUT A COLLEAGUE, DR. HERMANN KAMPFER, GRUDGINGLY CONFIRMED THAT 
IT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE OF A STAR SHIP THAT CRASHED IN
THE AUSTRIAN ALPS EARLIER THIS YEAR.
THE 850 PAGE MANUAL IS INTACT, HE ADDED, AND WRITTEN IN A 
MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE THAT JUST ABOUT ANY SCIENTIST CAN UNDERSTAND.
A SINGLE PAGE OF THE MANUAL THAT WAS OBTAINED FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED
SOURCE CLEARLY SHOWS THE STAR SHIPS ADVANCED DESIGN.
IN SPITE OF THAT, AMERICAN SPACE AUTHORITIES REMAIN SHARPLY 
DIVIDED IN THEIR OPINIONS OF WHAT THE GERMANS MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
DO WITH THE MANUAL.
WHILE SOME SAY THAT IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A 
STAR SHIP WITH MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO 
THE GERMANS, OTHERS ARE CONVINCED THAT IT CAN BE DONE.
IN FACT, ONE SENIOR NASA OFFICIAL WARNED THAT THE GERMANS MIGHT
USE A UFO AS A MILITARY WEAPON IN A BID TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DISTRUST THE GERMANS, BUT IF THEY PULL
THIS THING OFF AND ACTUALLY BUILD A STAR SHIP, GOD HELP US ALL,
HE SAID.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF MILITARY AGGRESSION AND WHEN
YOU CONSIDER THAT OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS WOULD BE
POWERLESS AGAINST A STAR SHIP, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY 
WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.
A SINGLE STAR SHIP WOULD GIVE THEM UNDENIABLE MILITARY SUPREMACY,
HE ADDED. THEY COULD EASILY VANQUISH AND ENSLAVE ALL MANKIND
WITH AN ALIEN TOOL.
