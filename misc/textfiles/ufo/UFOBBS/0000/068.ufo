SUBJECT: EARTH IS SPINNING OUT OF ORBIT!                     FILE: UFO68


SCIENTISTS SAY THE EARTH IS GETTING TOO HEAVY TO STAY IN ORBIT AROUND THE
SUN - AND HAS ALREADY STARTED TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL!
IN AN UPDATED REPORT TO THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN MOSCOW, DRS. ALEXEI NIKA-
NOV AND DMITRI KHARLAMOV SAY OUR DOOMED PLANET WILL BE TOTALLY OUT OF OUR
SOLAR SYSTEM BY THE YEAR 2002 - AT THE LATEST.
THE RESPECTED SPACE EXPERTS BLAME THE PLANET'S WEIGHT ON THE ESTIMATED
60,000 TONS OF SPACE DEBRIS THAT RAINS DOWN ON US EACH YEAR.
THEY ALSO HAVE LITTLE HOPE MANKIND CAN STOP OR DIVERT THE ENORMOUS FLOW
OF METEORITES AND DUST BEFORE THE EARTH TOTALLY BREAKS FREE OF THE SUN'S
GRAVITATIONAL PULL - KILLING US ALL.
THE FUTURE OF THE EARTH AND MANKIND IS IN PERIL AND WE'RE POWERLESS TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, DRS. KHARLAMOV AND NIKANOV SAID IN THEIR FIRST REPORT
IN MAY 1991.
ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS THE PLANET IS ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF
BEING TOO HEAVY TO MAINTAIN ITS ORBIT.
THE MOST RECENT REPORT TOUCHED OFF A STORM OF CONTROVERSY THAT MAY NOT
BE RESOLVED FOR YEARS TO COME.
MANY OTHER EXPERTS, INCLUDING FAMED FRENCH ASTROPHYSICIST JEAN PIERRE
LAMBERT, AGREED THAT COSMIC DEBRIS IS MAKING THE EARTH HEAVIER BY THE DAY.
BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WILL TAKE 25 TO 30 YEARS BEFORE THE ADDITIONAL
WEIGHT THREATENS THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE EARTH'S ORBIT AROUND THE SUN.
WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SAID DR. LAMBERT. THE USE OF
LASER WEAPONS TO INCINERATE METEORS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE EARTH'S
ATMOSPHERE IS JUST ONE POSSIBILITY THAT'S BEING INVESTIGATED RIGHT NOW.
DRS. KHARLAMOV AND NIKANOV ARE AWARE OF THE PROJECTIONS THAT EARTH
IS 25 TO 30 YEARS FROM AN ORBITAL CRISIS. BUT THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR
POSITION THAT WE WILL BE OUT OF ORBIT BY THE YEAR 2002 AT THE LATEST.
IT IS A DOOMSDAY PREDICTION BUT AN ACCURATE ONE, THE RESEARCHERS SAID.
