SUBJECT: RADAR SIGHTINGS                                     FILE: UFO27


Good point . . . why don't they just say "we don't know", instead of
scoffing at people? I took a tour once of Oakland ATC center here in
the San Francisco Bay Area, and I asked the tour guide point blank
how many UFOs they spotted on the controller's radar consoles. He shot
back immediately "there are no such things as UFOs, period". Very
definite. The only problem is that he spoke too quickly and too soon -
UFO is just a *technical* term for a flying object that is unidentified.
Theoretically, every Cessna 152 whose transponder is not working
and with whom they have no radio contact is unidentified, is flying,
and is certainly an object. I can only gather that his quick response
is something he was instructed to do immediately when the question
came up.

The Belgian government is not as obstructive - they actually released
video tape of fighter jets locking onto a UFO, and showing the
UFO responding to the lock on with tremendous accelerations!

Given our imperfection and the vastness of space and time, it is inevitable
that some sightings will remain unidentified indefinitely. Anyone that
says that all sightings are explainable is either fooling themselves
or trying to fool you! I can only wonder why . . .
