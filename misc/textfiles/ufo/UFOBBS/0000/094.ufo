PART 7

   "How is it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand
 side of the car was able to blow off the right side of Kennedy's
 brain when the bullet actually entered in, and it would have
 been virtually impossible..." another person asked.
   Mr. Cooper seized the gist of his question and injected, "For
 those of you who have been listening to all these talk show
 hosts, whose job it is to be a talk show host, and who have not
 done any legitimate research into this, if you come to the work-
 shop, I will show you, on the tape, how it was done. You will
 see that Kennedy was, in fact slumped over against Jackie, his
 head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it was
 easy and you will see it with your own eyes."
   Another muffled, off-mike question from a member of the audi-
 ence inquiring why no one else had come forward with the infor-
 mation Mr. Cooper was disseminating, and why those who knew it
 had kept it secret for so long was quickly answered, "It hasn't
 been, I'm talkin' about it now. Bill English was talkin' about
 it 8-years ago but everybody laughed at Bill English. John
 Lear's been talkin' about it for 3-years and everybody laughed
 at him. Now there's so many people have been talkin' about it,
 people are startin' to listen and it's about time. Because it's
 about time we that we quit being fools, and that's exactly what
 they think we are and we prove it to them every day."
   Almost all of the questions from the audience were to faint to
 hear. The next one dealt with the alien technology and asked in
 essence, "Hasn't any one else [other than the government] come
 up with the energy technology that the aliens have?" to which
 Mr. Cooper answered, "There's been quite a few people who've
 come up with it and they've ALL been stopped, and they'll all
 continue to be stopped. Because once you have it you have FREE
 ENERGY. Once you have free energy they no longer have power over
 you. You understand? That's why they stop it."
   Another question asking, "In the film of the assassination
 which was examined greatly by experts, why didn't THEY conclude
 that Kennedy's driver shot him?", to which Cooper asked, "Exam-
 ined by WHO greatly?", and continued, "Most of the film that you
 can purchase has that segment cut out, and you can always tell
 it by the person running in the background, they'll run up to
 here... all of a sudden they'll be down here... running. You
 will see in most of the clips that you've ever seen on televi-
 sion, or in the movies, or that you're able to get your hands
 on, you'll see William Greer start to turn like this...", then a
 muffled comment from the audience, then Cooper answered, "That's
 because they clipped it out! And on a lot of them, I'll bet you
 most of you, every time you've seen the clip on television,
 never looked at the driver anyway. If you're really honest with
 yourself, and with me, you know your eyes were right on
 Kennedy."
   A woman asked if any of the alien technology was being used in
 present-day military equipment and was answered, "Yes, there's a
 lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber, that's
 right. The Stealth fighter was flying for 10-years before you
 even knew it existed."
   As the hour drew late another question, more clearly stated,
 was asked of Mr. Cooper by a woman closer to my ears, "Before
 you let us all out of here, there's a bunch of us here wondering
 what can we all do to help bring this all out?"
