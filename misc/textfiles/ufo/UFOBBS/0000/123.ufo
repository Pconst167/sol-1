SUBJECT: THE FARMER AND THE COSMONAUTS                       FILE: UFO123

PART 2

   The Pleiades of Greek myth were seven sisters, named Aleyone,
Asterope, Electra, Celaeno, Maia, Metrope and Taygeta.  They were
daughters of Atlas and Pleione.  As it happens, the leader of the
migration from Lyra was called Pleione, according to Meier.  Was
the mythical name a faint memory of the space traveller?  Or was
the space traveller's name suggested to Meier by the
half-remembered mythical name?

  ...The chief critic of the Meier case has been Kal Korff, and
the title of his book on the subject sums up his attitude more
than adequately: "The most infamous hoax in ufology."

  One instance of self-contradiction on the part of Meier and his
defenders concerns a sequence of photographs purporting to show a
Pleiadean spacecraft circling a tree.  An unfortunate aspect of
this series is that when independant investigators visited the
site, no tree was to be found. Meier's explanation for this was
that the spacecraft had subsequently disintergrated the hapless
arboreal specimen.  Wendelle Stevens told Korff that the tree
vanished because it had been teleported into "another time frame".
Kal Korff's suspicion is that neither of these things happened,
since a close look at the pictures -- reputedly taken within
seconds of one another -- reveals markedly different cloud
patterns from frame to frame. Genesis III's claim that the day in
question was particularly windy is not borne out by the weather
record, which shows wind speeds reaching a maximum of 15 miles per
hour (25 km/h).  Korff reasons that a model UFO and model tree were
superimposed on pictures of the site.  And indeed models of
Pleiadean craft have been found on the Meier farm -- though Meier
says that they were inspired by his actual encounters.

  Possibly the least plausible of Meier's defender's is Jim
Dilettoso, of Genesis III.  Kal Korff prints a long interview with
him ... in which he says that in the 1950s Wendelle Stevens and
another ufologist, Richard Miller, performed something called
'transchanneling' on aliens for the US Air Force: "They would fly
up to Alaska because they were told that the magnetic fields
there were proper for resonance induction, and we have hundreds
and hundreds of audio recordings of Richard and other CIA officers
doing transchannelings of aliens.... Two of these CIA officers ...
have developed serious personality aberrations...

  The paucity of photographs of the Pleiadeans themselves is
explained by Wendelle Stevens thus: "They are afraid of being
hurt ... they do not want to be recognised.  Supposedly, they do
walk the streets in Europe and don't want to be compromised." Billy
Meier, on the other hand, has happily admitted to the strong
resemblance between Semjase and his own girlfriend -- so who is
really worried about being recognised on the streets of Europe?

  Less edifying are the claims made by Meier and Genesis III
concerning the sample of metal and crystal given Meier by the
Pleiadeans as examples  of their technological wizardry.  Meier
actually produced these while Stevens and his team were in
Switzerland. They called on him one morning and were told that he
had his 105th contact during the night and "had a surprise" for
them.  This turned out to be a package, handed over by the
cosmonaut Quetzal, of four metal, one biological and nine mineral
and crystal specimens.  According to Stevens's book, the scientists
who conducted "in-depth, highly sophisticated examination" of
these samples found them to have unique qualities and said they
had "never seen anything like it before". The level of purity in
the metal was not "immediately explainable" while the general
characteristics "seemed to indicate a non-electrolytic,
cold-fusion synthesis process not generally known to earth
technology".

  Kal Korff found rather less to be excited about. He interviewed
Dr Marcel Vogel, who had analysed the samples for Genesis III --
and had drawn rather different conclusions from those published in
the book. Only the first sample was unique, said Dr Vogel,
consisting of aluminum, silver and thulium, each having a high
degree of purity. The other samples were ordinary crystals of
quartz, citrine, amethyst and silver solder, and there was no
reason to believe they are of extra-terrestrial origin. Jim
Dilettoso characteristically failed to further the cause by
claiming that Genesis III hold a 10-hour videotape of "the entire
lab proceedings" (which Dr Vogel denies having made), "And ... we
have about an hour of him discussing why the metal samples are not
possible in earth technology, going into intrinsic detail of why it
is not done anywhere on earth, that type of chemistry." Of course
Dr Vogel may not be the only scientist to have analysed the samples
(no mention is made by either party of the biological specimen),
but then Genesis III are notably coy about naming any of the 200
scientists they say have verified Meier's remarkable story...
