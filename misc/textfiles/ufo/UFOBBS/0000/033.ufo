SUBJECT: POLICE CHOPPER ATTACKED BY UFO IN KENTUCKY!         FILE: UFO33


TWO HELICOPTER POLICEMEN PATROLING THE SKY OVER LOUISVILLE
KY., SAID THEY WERE FIRED ON DURING A HARROWING, TWO MINUTE
DOGFIGHT - WITHA PEAR SHAPED UFO. THE STRAGE CRAFT REPORTEDLY
SHOT THREE FIREBALLS DURING THE ENCOUNTER THAT ALSO WAS
WITNESSED BY TWO OTHER OFFICERS WHO MONITORED THE SITUATION FROM
THEIR POSITIONS ON THE GROUND BELOW. THE COPS INVOLVED HAVE
BEEN TIGHT LIPPED, DECLINING INTERVIEW REQUESTS. BUT OFFICIAL
REPORTS, WHICH ARE A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD AND AVAILABLE FOR
ANY CITIZEN TO SEE, CLEARLY SUGGEST THAT THE AIRBORNE OFFICERS
WERE LUCKY TO HAVE ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES. I KNOW WHAT WE SAW
AND WE WEEN'T HALLUCINATION, KENNY GRAHAM, WHO WAS PILOTING THE
HELICOPTER, SAID IN HIS REPORT. I WAS AFRAID THE UFO WAS GOING
TO COLLIDE WITH US, HE CONTINUED. THEN IT TURNED AT THE LAST
SECOND AND ROARED AWAY AT A SPEED I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. GRAHAM,
39, AN 11 YEAR POLICE VETERAN, AND KENNY DOWNS, 39, A FIVE YEAR
POLICE VETERAN WHO WAS OPERATING THE CHOPPER'S SPOTLIGHT, WERE
ON ROUTINE PATROL WHEN THEY SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A FIRE OFF TO
THEIR LEFT. DOWNS INSTINCTIVELY AIMED HIS SPOTLIGHT ON THE OBJECT
WHICH WAS SHAPED LIKE A PEAR AND DRIFTING BACK AND FORTH LIKE A
BALLON ON A STRING. WITHOUT WARNING, THE OBJECT SPED TOWARD THE
HELICOPTER AND CIRCLED IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE ZOOMING OFF IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION, DOWNS SAID. THEN THE UFO TURNED AND HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR THE CHOPPER, SHOOTING FIREBALLS THAT BY LUCK OR
DESIGN FIZZLED OUT BEFORE THEY HIT, ACCORDING TO GRAHAM. AFRAID
THE UFO WOULD RAM THE HELICOPTER'S TAIL ROTOR, GRAHAM PUSHED HIS
SPEED TO MORE THAN 100 M.P.H. FAR FROM BEING OUTRUN, THE UFO SHOT
PAST THE CHOPPER, INSTANTLY CLIMBING HUNDREDS OF FEET. IT
DESCENDED AGAIN MOMENTARILY. BUT WHEN GRAHAM STEERED TOWARD THE
CRAFT FOR A CLOSER LOOK, IT FLEW INTO THE DISTANCE AND DISAPPEARED.
THE AMAZING AERIAL MANEUVERING OF THE UFO DIDN'T GO UNNOTICED ON
THE GROUND. OFFICER MIKE SMITH SAW THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.
HE CONFIRMED IT FIRED THREE FIREBALLS AND DISAPPEARED. OFFICER JOE
SMOLENSKI SAID HE TRIED FOR MORE THAN MINUTE TO CATCH UP TO THE
UFO IN HIS PATROL CAR. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR UFOS FOR 14 YEARS AND
I GUESS THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE COME TO SOMETHING I CAN'T EXPLAIN,
SMOLENSKI SAID. A LIEUTENANT DESCRIBED THE TWO HELICOPTER OFFICERS
AS SOLID GUYS AND GOOD COPS. DOWNS SAID: KENNY AND I BOTH GO TO
CHURCH EVERY WEEK. AFTER THIS, I MIGHT START GOING TWICE A WEEK.
