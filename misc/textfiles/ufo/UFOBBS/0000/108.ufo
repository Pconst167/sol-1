PART 4

2.5  Glenn Dennis
[Glenn Dennis was a mortician in Roswell in 1947.  His
employer provided mortuary services for Roswell Army Air
Field.  Dennis drove a combination hearse and ambulance for
both civilian and military assignments.  On July 9 or 10,
1947, Dennis got several phone calls from the Roswell AAF
mortuary officer, who was more of an administrator than a
mortuary technician.  The officer wanted to know about
hermetically sealed caskets ("What was the smallest one they
could get?"), and about chemical solutions.  Dennis was
interviewed in August 1989 by Stanton Friedman.]
This is what was so interesting.  See, this is why I feel
like there was really something involved in this, because
they didn't want to do anything that was going to make an
imbalance.  They kept saying, "OK, what's this going to do
to the blood system, what's this going to do to the tissue?"
Then when they informed me that these bodies [had] laid out
in the middle of July, in the middle of the prairie, I mean
that body's going to be as dark as your [blue] blazer there,
and it's going to be in bad shape.  I was the one who
suggested dry ice.  I'd done that a time or two.
I talked to them four or five times in the afternoon.  They
would keep calling back and asking me different questions
involving the body.  What they were really after was how to
move those bodies.  They didn't give me any indication they
even had the bodies, or where they were.  But they kept
talking about these bodies, and I said, "What do the bodies
look like?"  And they said, "I don't know, but I'll tell you
one thing: This happened some time ago."  The only thing
that was mentioned was that they were exposed to the
elements for several days.
I understand these bodies weren't in the same location as
where they found some of the others.  They said the bodies
weren't in the vehicle itself; the bodies were separated by
two or three miles from it.  They talked about three
different bodies: two of them mangled, one that was in
pretty good shape.
[That evening, Dennis took a GI accident victim to the base
infirmary, which was in the same building as the hospital
and the mortuary.  He walked the injured GI inside, then
drove around to the back to see a pretty young Army Air
Forces nurse he had recently gotten to know.]
There were two MPs standing right there, and I got out and
started to go in.  I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did if
I hadn't parked in the emergency area.  They probably
thought I was coming after somebody.  The doors were open to
the military ambulances and that's where some wreckage was,
and there was an MP on each side.  I saw all the wreckage.
I don't know what it was, but I knew there was something
going on, and that's when I first got an inclination that
something was happening.  What was so curious about it, was
that in two of those ambulances was a deal that looked like
[the bottom] half of a canoe.  It didn't look like
aluminum.  You know what stainless steel looks like when you
put heat on it?  How it'll turn kinda purplish, with kind of
a blue hue to it?  [Dennis later said that he saw a row of
unrecognizable symbols several inches high on the metal
devices.]  I just glanced in and kept going.
