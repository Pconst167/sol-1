  A NAZI U-BOAT THAT SAILED OUT OF HAMBURG IN 1942 WAS CAPTURED
BY A NAVY DESTROYER AFTER IT SURFACED IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC JUST
  NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE HOW THE VINTAGE WORLD WAR 2 SUBMARINE
SAILED FROM THE PAST TO THE PRESENT BUT SOURCES SAY IT IS ALMOST
CERTAINLY LINKED TO A SECOND, SUNKEN U-BOAT THAT MADE
  EQUALLY AS STRANGE, THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF THE CAPTURED U-BOAT
INSIST THAT ADOLF HITLER AND PRESIDENT FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT
ARE ALIVE, CALL THEM SELVES "PRISONERS OF WAR" AND APPARENTLY
  "THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE," SAID THE
WASHINGTON BASED NAVY OFFICER WHO LEAKED THE REPORT A FEW DAYS
  "FIRST WE FIND A SUNKEN U-BOAT IN MINT CONDITION OF THE JERSEY
COAST AND THEN WE FIND AN ARMED AND MANNED U-BOAT CRUISING THE
NORTH ATLANTIC LESS THAN 150 MILES FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE FIRST
  "THE CREW ITSELF THINKS THE YEAR IS 1942 AND THEIR UNIFORMS ARE
NOT ONLY NEW, THEY'RE AUTHENTIC. BOTHE THE U-BOATS ARE 50 YEAR
OLD SHIPS BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE
  "THE CRAZIEST THING ABOUT ALL THIS IS THAT THE CREWMEN HAVE
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS SAILORS WHOSE NAMES HAVE BEEN VERIFIED
IN WAR RECORDS. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL YOUNG MEN IN PRIME
  "I DON'T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT TIME WARPS," HE CONTINUED,
"BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR THIS WHOLE
  "WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? SOMETHING'S GOINMG ON IN THE NORTH
  THE CAPTURE OF THE VINTAGE GERMAN U-BOAT REPORTEDLY UNFOLDED
WHILE THE DESTROYER WAS ON MANEUVERS A FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF
  ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER'S REPORT, THE UNIDENTIFIED NAVY VESSEL
PICKED UP THE SUB ON SONAR AT 5:10PM AND LESS THAN A MINUTE
  THE U-BOAT BORE NAZI INSIGNIAS. BUT EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE
  THE WASHINGTON BASED OFFICER SAID THE U-BOAT'S CREW OF 63 WAS
IN GOOD HEALTH BUT EXTREMELY DISORIENTED WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN
  THE ONLY ENGLISH SPEAKING NAZI ON THE U-BOAT, GERMAN S.S.
OFFICER HEINRICH MARTIN, INSISTED THAT THE DATE WAS AUGUST 24,
1942, WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERROGATED ON THE DESTROYER. HE THEN
PLEDGED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO ADOLF HITLER AND DEMANDED TO SEE
  THE SOURCE REFUSED TO SAY WHAT NAVY HAS DONE WITH THE U-BOAT
  NAVY SPOKESMEN DECLINED REPEATED REQUESTS TO BE INTERVIEWED AND
THREATENED "TO DAMAGE" ONE TV NEWSMAN WHO ACCUSED THE NAVY OF A

  PARANORMAL RESEARCHER ART GARRETT IS ONE OF SEVERAL EXPERTS WHO
HAVE OFFERED TO HELP THE NAVY IN ITS INVESTIGATION.
  HE SAID: "IF WE REALLY ARE DEALING WITH TIME WARP THEN THE
PORTAL FROM PAST TO PRESENT MUST HAVE OPENED TWICE - ONCE TO LET
THE LIVE SUBMARINE AND CREW INTO 1991 AND AGIN TO LET IN THE
