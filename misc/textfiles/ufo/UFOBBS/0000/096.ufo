SUBJECT: UFO'S AND OUR GOVERNMENT'S CONCEALMENT              FILE: UFO96

PART 9

   The lecture was then essentially over. The "Alternative-2 and
 -3" that were referred to briefly are, to the best of my know-
 ledge, two government contingency plans and I don't know which
 is which, to 1: Declare Martial Law and invalidate the Constitu-
 tion on the premise that a terrorist group had entered the coun-
 try with a Nuclear weapon with plans to detonate it in a major
 city. All dissidents would be rounded up and placed in concen-
 tration camps and the press and media would be nationalized. All
 this, if the information becomes public before they want it to
 or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and 2: Another contingency
 plan to contain or delay the release of this information, the
 details of which I am probably wrong about anyway.
   My own personal reaction to Milton William Cooper; Mr. Cooper
 is a man who appears to be in his late fourties, of medium
 height and weight, and was dressed casually when I saw him. His
 hairline was receding slightly and he carried himself with con-
 fidence and purpose. Bill Cooper, as he was called by several in
 attendance, is not a professional speaker. His presentation
 lacked the polish of repeated deliveries which all the other
 lectures I heard during the Expo. had, but what it lacked in
 fine tuning was easily made up for in its content. Weather or
 not everyone in the audience was convinced of his sincerity I do
 not know, but the thunderous peal of applause which exploded as
 he concluded the session spoke for me and the majority of those
 in attendance. I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that
 Bill Cooper believes everything he said, and I'm about as
 skeptical as they come.
   Please read the attached file written by Milton William Cooper
 which describes some of the government operations, projects, and
 code names that pertain to the above transcript. Perhaps from
 the two documents you can reach your own conclusions as to what
 "Alternative-2 and -3 are.
 The following is the original file "OPER-MAJ.TXT" which
 introduced Mr. Cooper to me.

   FINAL RELEASE
   THERE WILL BE NO CORRECTIONS TO THIS FILE
   C - COPYRIGHT 1989 BY MILTON WILLIAM COOPER
   ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
   YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO QUOTE FROM THIS INFORMATION IN PRESS
   RELEASES, PERIODICALS, AND SPEECHES.  INCLUSION IN ANY OTHER
   MEDIA REQUIRES MY EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION.

   This file contains the absolute true information regarding the
 alien presence on earth and the US Government's involvement with
 the aliens.  This file contains only the information as I saw it
 and only my information.  It does not contain any information
 from any other source.
   It was necessary for me to issue the information previous to
 this release in a manner which would deceive the Government
 until someone was able to independently confirm my identity, my
 employment, my service record, my intelligence background, the
 identity of the person to which I gave the information in 1972,
 his acknowledgment of the information and when it was given to
 him, that the information is correct, that I have not seen him
 since 1974, and that I have not communicated with him in any
 form since 1976.  This was necessary because this file is my
 death warrant if MJ-12 continues to operate in a manner
 consistent with its history.
   All in the last paragraph has been independently verified by 2
 different people who have no connection with each other. I will
 only list one for obvious reasons.

   The original information that I first released was not much
 MAJI that I was not a threat long enough to have independent
 verification of the facts before I risked death. [TRANSMISSION
 GARBLED]  I wish to make it absolutely clear that I do not
 consider myself a hero.  I believe that most of you would do the
 same thing if you knew the truth.  I gave an oath that I would
 uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States of
 America and I take that oath very seriously.  I am doing no more
 now than I did when I fought in Vietnam.  I am doing my duty.
