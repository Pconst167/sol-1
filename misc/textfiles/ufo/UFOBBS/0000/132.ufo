SUBJECT: UFO'S AND THE NEW'S MEDIA                           FILE: UFO132


     For many years the news media have considered the
subject of UFOs to be one of a circus atmosphere. With the
goings on in the world concerning sightings in Belgium,
Russia, the Far East, and this country. I belive the time has
come to let the public in on the truth of the story as well
as a call for Congresional Investigations into the matter.
     You will find in this disk ten (10) of the best case
sightings that you can find in any good library. These ten
reports should convince even the most hardened skeptic that
there is indeed something most mysterious going on.
     The news media claim that they act in the publics
interest, then should they not report what is going on in the
same light that they treat other world events? This is going
on not only in the newspapers, but T.V. and magazine media as
well. The only places that the general public can get
information such as this is thru either "talk radio" shows
which the Federal Government has enacted legislation to keep
"talk radio" from exposing the UFO subject. Please see a book
called "Matrix II" by Val Valerian. This is under the Nevada
Aerial Research Group, Chronology, pg 431 it states:
"October 25,1990: Congress works on legislation to make radio
talk shows liable for statements made by callers in an effort
to shut-down radio talk shows, where UFO/Alien data is being
avidly discussed."
or thru "tabloids" and they just print disinformation for a
guliable segment of the population. This being "UFO
Information Week" across the country, would be an excellent
time to put forth good solid information about the UFO
Enigma.
     This information is being sent to the top 10 newspapers
across this country. It is also being sent thru the FIDO
network of BBSs (computer Bulletin Board Systems) that number
around 9 to 10,000. We hope to get grass-roots support to get
a Congressional Investigation into the UFO Enigma. Please see
enclosed form letter to that effect.
     I think it is past time to get the government of the
United States to finally come clean with the information they
posess. Should you not be a part in this effort, as you are
supposed to serve the publics interest.
