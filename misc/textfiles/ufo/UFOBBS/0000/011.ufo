 Forth of May 1989, I was asleep in bed.  Her indoors wasn't!  She
was in hospital in labor.  Home was a semi isolated house 5 miles
from Tiverton, Devon, UK.

 Woke up about midnight by a tremendous noise which was so loud it
was shaking the house violently.  It wasn't an earthquake.  Whatever
it was was going overhead but looking out of the window I could see
nothing.

 As a lot of military activity takes place in Devon, my first thoughts
were that an aircraft was in trouble but as there were no lights (or
even sign of an aircraft) this obviously wasn't the cause.  Scratched
my head and went back to bed.

 Sometime during the night, (it's really impossible for me to remember
exactly when), I woke to a repeat performance but this time the shaking
of the house really was horrendous as was the noise.  I estimate that
it lasted two minutes or so.  If this was military aircraft, they
were sure having a lot of problems that night!

 I wouldn't have told anyone but I didn't need to as whatever it was
affected a pretty big area and was reported for miles around Tiverton.

 A few weeks later, I saw a red ball of light float over the house.
I made it about 50 feet across and this time it WAS silent.  The same
week, a little old lady in Taunton claims that an identical sight
made her fall off the toilet as she thought it was coming through
the window!  I checked with a friend who is interested in aircraft
and he informed me - and this I stand to be corrected on - that all
aircraft use FLASHING red lights.  I.e. if the light is strident,
it isn't an aircraft.

 I telephone the MOD and the conversation went as follows....

Me, "Do you know anything about either incident?"
MOD, "NO!"
Me, "Would you tell me if you did?"
MOD, "NO!"

 Oh well.....
