SUBJECT: CREATURE ON ILIKLEY MOOR                            FILE: UFO19


hello  again  last  time  you  read  about  the  hypnotic  regression  of the
man  who  took  the  picture  of  a  small  creature  on  ilikley  moor.
Now  I will  tell  you  what  professional  experts  had  to  say  about  the
picture,and  the  compass.(you"all  remember  the  compass  was  reversed  by
some  strong  magnetic  field).
Peter  sutherst  of  kodak  was  shown  the  picture  here's  what  his  expert
opinion  was,
it  (the  exposure) is  underexposed  by  at  least  two  stops. it  is  usual
for  these  films  to  produce  grainy  pictures  when  underexposed.
The  negative  shows  a degree  of  camera  shake  making  it  difficult  to
decide  what  the  small  figure  might  be. Identification  is  made  more
difficult  because  of  underexposure. I  would  not  care  to   commit  myself
to  any  observation  beyond  saying  that  the  film  had  not  been  inter-
feared  with  after  processing"
According  to  peter  this  was  not  a  photograph  of  a  photograph. and
the  figure  - whatever  it  was  - was  actually  there  at  the  site  where
it  was  photographed.
Peter  also  said  in  regard  to  image  enhancement  of  the  picture,
Image  enhancement  is  a  costly  exercise  and  I have  some  doubt  about
the  benefits  in  this  case. The  size, distance  of  the  subject, camera
movement  and  underexposure  mean  that  there  is  insufficient  detail  to
enhance.
Well  that  was  kodak"s  photographic  analysis  of  the    ilkley  moor photo
Next  we  decided  to  have  the  compass  looked  at  for  this  we got  in
contact  with  a  Dr.  raymond  leonard, head  of  the  total  technology
department  at   the  university  of  manchester  institute  of  science &
technology (UMIST),  He  arranged  an  appointment  for  us  with  aDr spoon-
er  Dr.  spooner  heads  the  department  of  electrical  engineering & electr-
onics  at  umist.  he  agreed  to  examine  the  compass  it  was  to  prove
a  very  interesting  morning.
To  Dr.  spooner  it  was  a  very  interesting  problem. just  how  could  the
polarity  of  a  compass  be  reversed?  Expert  though  he  was,  at  this
stage  he  had  no   ready  answer.
He  began  very  simply  by  exposing  the  compass  to  some  strong  magnetic
magnets.  but  although  they  defected  the  needle, the  effect  ceased  as
soon  as  the  magnets  were  moved  away.
A  steady  magnetic  field  had  no  permanent  effect.  Dr.  spooner  and  his
assistant  then  experimented  with a rapidly  applied, or" pulsed " magnetic
field.  Eventually  it  was  found  that  this  indeed  would  reverse  the
needle, and  back  again.  under  laboratory  controlled  conditions.
This  was  fine, but  could  the  reversal  be  brought  about  without,
recourse  to  such  expensive  and  complex  equipment?
Dr.  spooner  showed  it  could,  albeit  with  a  certain  risk  to  life and
property. A  piece  of  wire  was  coiled  around  one  hand, then the  compass
was  placed  within  it.  the  ends  were  then  connected   to  the  mains
electricity  supply,  and  a  switch  was  thrown. There  was  a  bang,  but,
yes  the  polarity  was  changed  north  to  south.
This  of  course  could  be  done  in  the  house, although  at   the  very
least  fuses  would  be  blown, and  there  was  the serious  prospect  of
creating  an  electrical  fire.
Also  would  john  know  how  to  carry  out  this  dangerous  process, when
Dr.  spooner an  expert  in  his  field  did  not?
Dr.  spooner"s  report  said, It  appears  to  be  a  relatively  simple  matte
to  bring  about  the  reversal  without  the  need  for  any  special equip-
ment.  and  may  be  accomplished  in  the  average  home  or  garage.

The  intensity  required  is  not  great  by  some  standards; in  fact  we
could  not  produce  a  field  sufficiently  low  as  to  not  reverse  the
polarity  of  the  needle. The  minimum  field  we  applied  had  a  flux
density  of  about  0.1  TESLA; this  is  still  2000  times  greater  than
the  earth"s  field.(therefore) the  required  intensity  is  very  large by
other  standards  to  leave  detectable  magnetization  in  samples  of  rock.
Dr.  spooner  went  on to  say  that  perhaps  one  way  of  determining
evidence  for  or  against  the  claim  would  be  to  carry  out  a  magnetic
survey  of  the  surrounding  rocks.  If  we  accept  the  story  at  its  face
value, that  some  sort  of  powerful  magnetic  field  associated  with  the
"craft" had  affected  the  compass  then  it  would  assuredly  also   have
affected  the  surrounding  area. This  made  sense    and  it  was  another
line  of  research  we  wished  to  follow up.  But  then  we  were  presuming
that  the  compass  had  been  affect  near  the  ground,  later  events
indicated  otherwise  thus  making  the  necessity  for  a  magnetic  survey
almost  redundant.
Well  that  is  the  illkley  moor  case  I  leave  it  up  to  you  and  I
can  say  that  in  my  mind  that  this  is  not  a  fake.    Ill  leave  the
last  words  to  the  clinical  psychologist  who  did  the  hypnotic  regress
ion  on  john  to  sum  up; I think  if  people  make  unusual  claims  we
should  at  least  listen  to  them, and  very   carefully.  we  don"t  know
answers  to  everything. If  we  are  going  to  be  even  remotely  scientific
we"ve  got  to  entertain  these  different  ideas, thoughts  and  impressions


Well  that's  it  I will  be  talking  about  another  case  that  I investigated
d  but  that's  for  another  time.
