This next case is more recent it happened on the 7th may 1989 in south africa
at 13h45 gmt the naval frigate "sa tafalberg" radioed cape town naval hq to
report a ufo that had appeared on radar scopes.heading toward the african
continent in a north westerly direction at a calculated speed of 5746 nautical
miles per hour! naval hq acknowledged and confirmed that object was also
tracked by airborne radar,military ground radar installations and df halan
international airport at cape town.
The object entered south african air space at 13h52 gmt radio contact was
attempted with object, but all communications proved futile. valhalla air force
base was notified and 2 armed mirage fIIG fighters were scrambled. the object
suddenly changed course at great speed which would be impossible for military
aircraft to duplicate. at 13h59 gmt squadron leader goomen reported radar and
visual confirmation of the object.the order was given to arm and fire the
experimental aircraft mounted thor 2 laser cannon at object, this was done.
squadron leader goomen reported several blinding flashes emanated from the
object. the object started wavering whilst still heading in a northerly
direction.at 14h02 gmt it was reported that object was decreasing altitude
at a rate of 3000 feet per minute then at great speed it dived at an angle of
25 degrees and impacted in desert terrain 80km north of south african border
with botswana.
identified as the central kalahari desert. squadron leader goomen was instructed
to circle the area until retrieval of the object was complete. a team of
air force intelligence officers,together with medical and technical staff were
promptly taken to area of impact for investigation and retrieval of the object.
The findings were as follows,
1) a creator 150 meters in diameter and 12 meters in depth.
2) a silver colored disc shaped object 45 degrees embedded in side of creator.
3)   around object sand and rocks were fused together by the intense heat.
4) an intense magnetic and radioactive environment around the object resulted
in electronic failure in air force equipment.
5) it was suggested by team leader that object be moved to a classified air
force base for further investigation and this was done.
the terrain of impact was filled hi sand and rubble to disguise all
evidence of this event having ever taken place.

craft specifications. the following are specifications as indicated by
preliminary investigation at classified air force base..

             weight  50.000 kilograms estimated.
material of construction   unknown  pending further laboratory results.
outer surface of object flawless polished smooth silver color.no visible
seams noted inside or on outer surfaceã÷opulsion, unknown  pending laboratory results.
NOTES
A hydraulic type landing gear was fully deployed suggesting that electronic
malfunction caused object to crash. this may have been due also thor 2 laser
cannon being fired at craft.while the investigating teams observed the object
at classified afb. a loud sound was heard it was them noted that a hatch or
entrance on lower side of craft had opened slightly.this opening was later
prized open with heavy mechanical gear.

of investigation.one way passage has been requested for both humanoids to

investigation and research.
date of passage to wright patters on afb 23 june 1989
This information has come via very good source a friend of mine who was a police
sergeant in yorkshire for 25 years.
the initial info re this case came from south african intelligence sources
by a person inside the intelligence network who gave this information to my
friend. this had come from BOSS (bureau of state security) in pretoria S.A.
