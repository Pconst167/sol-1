PART 7

4.2  Lydia Sleppy

[Lydia Sleppy was a teletype operator at Roswell radio
station KSWS.  The event she describes below took place
around 4:00 pm on July 7, 1947.  She was interviewed in
October 1990 by Stanton Friedman.]

We were Mutual Broadcasting and ABC, and if we had anything
newsworthy, we would put it on the [teletype] machine, and I
was the one who did the typing.  It was in my office.
Mr Tucker [Merle Tucker was the station owner] was in
Washington DC trying to get an application approved for a
station in El Paso, when this call came from John McBoyle
[another KSWS staffer].  He told me he had something hot for
the network.  I said, "Give me a minute and I'll get the
assistant manager," because if it was anything like that, I
wanted one of them there while I was taking it down.

I went back and asked Mr [Karl] Lambertz (he came up from
the big Dallas station) if he would come up and watch.  John
was dictating and [Karl] was standing right at my shoulder.
I got into it enough to know that it was a pretty big story,
when the bell came on [signaling an interruption].  Typing
came across: "This is the FBI, you will cease transmitting."

I had my shorthand pad, and I turned around and told [Karl]
that I had been cut off, but that I could take it in
shorthand and then we could call it in to the network.  I
took it in shorthand, as John went on to give the story.  He
had seen them take the thing away. He'd been out there
[presumably at the Foster ranch] when they took it away.
And at that time, if I remember correctly, John said they
were gonna load it up and take it to Texas.  But when the
planes came in, they were from Wright Field.



4.3  Walt Whitmore Jr

[Walt Whitmore Jr was the son of the owner of Roswell radio
station KGFL.  Here is his description of wreckage from the
crash.]

[It was] very much like lead foil in appearance but could
not be torn or cut at all.  Extremely light in weight.  Some
small beams that appeared to be either wood or woodlike had
a sort of writing on it which looked like numbers which had
either been added or multiplied [in columns].
