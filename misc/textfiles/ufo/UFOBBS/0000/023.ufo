SUBJECT:  U.S. F16 SHOOTS DOWN UFO OVER SAUDI DESERT         FILE: UFO23


A HIGH LEVEL SOURCE HAS REVEALED THAT AN AMERICAN AIR FORCE F16
GUNNED DOWN A UFO OVER SAUDI ARABIA DURING DESERT STORM AND FIVE
NATIONS ARE TRYING TO COVER UP THE ENCOUNTER. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE
DETAILS BUT I'M SURE THAT WHEN THIS STORY COMES OUT IT WILL SHAKE
THE WORLD," SAYS COLONEL GREGOR PETROKOV, A SENIOR RUSSIAN OFFICIAL.
IT IS A COVER UP WAITING TO EXPLODE. COLONEL PETROKOV SAYS HE WAS
ONE OF THE FIRST EXPERTS AT THE CRASH SITE IN A BARREN DESERT REGION
250 MILES NORTHEAST OF RIYADH, THE SAUDI ARABIAN CAPITAL. THE
AMERICANS WON'T ADMIT IT WAS A UFO THEIR PLANE SHOT DOWN, BUT THE
DEBRIS WAS NOT FROM ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT, HE SAYS. THE SAUDIS WITH ME
WERE SO FRIGHTENED THAT THEY ASKED AMERICAN, BRITISH AND FRENCH
INVESTIGATORS TO COME TO THE CRASH SITE IMMEDIATELY. THE COLONEL
SAYS HE WAS VISITING IN RIYADH AT THE TIME AND THAT HE AND A SMALL
RUSSIAN TEAM WERE ABLE TO INSPECT THE WRECKAGE BEFORE AMERICAN
FORCES FROM DESERT STORM ARRIVED. THE CRAFT WAS CIRCULAR AND MADE
OF A MATERIAL I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, HE SAYS. ABOUT A THIRD OF IT
SEEMED TO BE MISSING POSSIBLE BLOWN AWAY BY THE AMERICAN MISSILES.
THE SAUDIS WOULDN'T LET US TOUCH ANYTHING, BUT WE SAW INSTRUMENTS,
MACHINERY AND OTHER THINGS THAT COMPLETELY BAFFLED US. HE SAYS
THE MARKINGS ON INSTRUMENT PANELS AND DIALS WERE NOT IN ANY LANG-
UAGE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH. IT SEEMED TO BE A RELATIVELY SMALL CRAFT,
MAYBE 15 FEET ACROSS, HE SAYS. THERE WERE THREE CHAIRS, PROBABLY
FOR CREW MEMBERS, BUT THEY WERE SO SMALL THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
MADE FOR CHILDREN. EVIDENTLY SPACE ALIENS ARE ONLY ABOUT THREE FEET
TALL. MOST AMAZING, THOUGH, IS THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO BODIES AT
THE CRASH SITE NOR DID THERE APPEAR TO BE AN ENGINE IN THE CRAFT.
THE AMERICAN MISSILES MAY HAVE SCORED A DIRECT HIT ON THE ENGINE,
CAUSING IT TO DISINTEGRATE, HE SAYS. BUT I CHECKED WITH THE SAUDI
RADAR TECHNICIANS AND THEY CLAIM THEIR INSTRUMENTS DIDN'T SHOW
ANYONE EJECTING OR BAILING OUT FROM THE CRAFT. SEARCH HELICOPTERS
WERE ALL OVER THE AREA, WHICH IS A DESERT, AND THEY DID NOT SPOT
ANY SURVIVORS IN THE VICINITY OF THE CRASH. DURING INTERVIEWS
WITH THE RADAR TECHNICIANS, PETROKOV WAS TOLD THAT THE BLIP IDEN-
TIFIED AS THE UFO APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AS FOUR F16S WERE
STREAKING TOWARD BAGHDAD. ONE OF THE AMERICAN PLANES BROKE FROM
FORMATION AND HEADED FOR THE UFO, HE SAYS. THE ALIEN CRAFT STARTED
STARTED MOVING SOUTHWEST, AWAY FROM THE F16, AND THE AMERICAN PILOT
GAVE CHASE. WHEN THE F16 WAS WITHIN THREE MILES, THE ALIEN CRAFT
SEEMED TO FIRE SOMETHING AT THE PLANE BUT MISSED. THE AMERICAN
THEN FIRED TWO MISSILES. BOTH HIT THE SAUCER. THERE WAS A TERRIFIC
EXPLOSION, AND THEN THE CRASH. WHEN AMERICAN INVESTIGATORS ARRIVED,
PETROKOV SAYS, HE AND HIS TEAM WERE IMMEDIATELY ORDERED OUT OF
THE AREA AND FLOWN BACK TO RIYADH. THERE WERE THINGS THEY DIDN'T
WANT US TO SEE-MORE, I THINK, THAN THE FACT THAT THE CRAFT WAS
CIRCULAR, THAT THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS AND THAT IT WAS MADE OF A
FOREIGN SUBSTANCE, HE SAYS. PETROKOV SAYS MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM
WERE ABLE TO SNEAK PICTURES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SAUDIS
OR AMERICANS, BUT HE WAS ORDERED TO TURN THEM OVER TO RUSSIAN
AUTHORITIES THE NEXT DAY. PETROKOV SAYS AMERICAN ARMY ENGINEERS
GATHERED UP ALL DEBRIS AND CARTED IT AWAY FOR SHIPMENT TO THE
U.S.
