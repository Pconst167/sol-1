     North America has "caught" the crop circles.  If events in
England are any indication, they will increase in number and
complexity as time goes on.  It's time we got organized.

     I would like to propose the creation of a data network.  Its
purpose would be to ensure that each of the major researchers on
the continent gets the information gathered by all the others.

     There are a number of ways it could be organized.  One
possibility is to assign each person one or two other people to
whom they automatically send everything they discover or receive.
Since everybody would have an "input" and an "output," one could be
sure that by sending a new piece of data to their "outputs,"
everyone else would eventually get a copy.

     I would like to solicit organizational suggestions.  There are
several criteria that a successful network must meet:

*    It must be fast and efficient.  This rules out circular
networks, for example, because one's "input" would have to
wait for information to be mailed all the way around the
circle before he or she got it.

*    It must be readily expandable.  It should be possible to add
    new members to the net without difficulty.

*    It must be fault-tolerant.  If a person goes on vacation, or
    drops out, the net should be able to keep going without
difficulty.  This would seem to rule out highly centralized
networks.

*    Each member must be productive as well as distributive.  They
    should have some way of contributing new information to the
  net, whether by fieldwork, literature searches or data
analysis.

     I would like to suggest that the network be named "The North
American Circle."  If you have suggestions as to how the net could
be organized, or would be interested in joining it, please write:
