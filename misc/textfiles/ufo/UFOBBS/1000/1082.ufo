PART 6

Then I focussed upon his eyes.  In the past, we had two pet cockatoos,
a Moluccan and a Sulpher-crested, both of which had eyes as black
as coal.  It is said that the birds can be sexed by examining their
eyes for the subtle hint of brown, and I thought of the many times
I had stared intently into the birds' eyes.  It was like a feeling
of deja' vu, for I was sure that within the alien's eyes, I could
pick up some extremely subtle gradations of color.  Furthermore,
these ever-so-sublte variations in the color seemed to indicate not
just one circular iris within each eye, but perhaps two or more,
although I somehow "knew" that their eyes were more than just visual
organs, and the non-primary circular markings were not really a visual
iris.  (...that they had only one real visual iris within  each eye)
Additionally, it struck me at how the eyes were far less almond-shaped
and less wrap-around than I had thought before.  It made me think
that the illustration of an alien on Communion was analogous to the
Kroft puppeteer's version of Ronald Reagan: a highly stylized caricature.

Then the image came to life!  The thought was somehow conveyed to
me that he was acknowledging the presence of orthodontic braces on
my teeth.  In a manner analogous to "I've seen yours, so now I'll
show you mine," he proceeded to open up his little round mouth and
let me look in.  When his nearly lip-less mouth was shut, it seemed
to call no attention to itself, but when opened, I noticed that he,
like us, had muscles beneath the skin.  The effect of seeing the
tightened muscles beneath his skin made me think that he was capable
of expression, in an otherwise expressionless face.  Within the mouth,
I observed a semicircular ridge of hardened tissue, which he called
his "primary mastication NOUN."

  It seemed like he was using telepathy to communicate, and my mind
was responsible for translations into the English language.  The
"NOUN" carried a meaning like "organ", "appendage", or "device,"
but the exact word to convey the true meaning is not within my vocabulary,
and it's making me very frustrated as I write this.  I somehow seemed
to "know" that they eat very soft foods, like being a vegetarian
in England.  The hardened ridge of tissue was unsegmented, unlike
ordinary human teeth.  With that, the image faded from my mind.
What has taken me two long paragraphs to write happened in only a
few seconds of time. The image was definitely a memory, and not something
that was happening at that moment.  Whether the memory is of a dream
or reality, I will probably never know.

After recalling the unusual experience above, the feeling of contentedness
overwhelmed me.  My bladder now empty and Jim's warm body next to
mine, I immediately fell soundly asleep.  I didn't wake up until
after 11 am the following morning, and was relieved that I had finally
(post 6 am) been able to get a normal night's sleep.  Fully cognizant
of the aforementioned experience, I immediately proceeded to the
computer and wrote everything down.  While sitting at the keyboard
and unconsciously scratching at my dandruff patch, I became aware
that my dandruff was severely aggravated, and I had a painful welt
next to it!

For about a year, more-or-less coinciding with people telling me
that I had a sunburn (polycythemia), I have had a localized patch
of dandruff at the base of my skull.  More specifically, if you run
your finger up along the cervical vertebrae, you will reach a slight
concavity between two muscles at the point where the neck meets the
head, in the occipital region of the cranium.  It is in that spot
that I have my dandruff patch.  I use the word "dandruff", for lack
of something better, because it is most likely some other skin disorder,
since I have an otherwise oily scalp .  I have tried every name-brand
dandruff shampoo, and nothing seems to help, but fortunately, it
hasn't spread beyond that highly localized area.  On this day, July 18,
and for several days afterward, the patch seemed to be draining some
sort of fluid from the painful welt which was just above and to the
left of my patch.  As of this writing, (August 7), that welt has
not entirely subsided.  On July 19, the following day, I developed
another painful welt on the right side of the dandruff patch,  almost
a mirror image.      Coinciding again with the development of my
dandruff patch and my polycythemia, for about a year I have been
plagued by excessive perspiration.  For no apparent reason, I would
sweat from my armpits in phenomenal amounts.
