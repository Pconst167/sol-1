PART 10

JUNE 13, 1987

Dear Sirs,

Although I missed your very recent radio and tv shows, a
friend suggested that I write this letter and share my
information with you.  I am fifty year af age engineer that
has worked in the private sector, as well as with the
government.

From 1975 to 1980, i was involved with several investigations
having to do with E.T. material.  Even though the project was
very well covered, I am still very much surprised that
Project Pluto and results have not surfaced yet.

In as much as the project was handled by others, there was no
question that the government was in full control.  For
security purposes, Project Pluto had five levels.  Those who
investigated one level had nothing to do with the next, and
would only turn in the results of data of these findings to
the next level, then go on to another area.

No one that I knew ever had the results of two levels at the
same time.  There was only one very rare exception to the
rule which took place in 1975, and was in fact my very first
assignment with the project.  I was employed by a non-
government firm that of course was directly involved with the
government, and probably fronted for them on the projects.

I would assume that eventually government records could be
made available to the general public, but not from the
private sector.  I'm not really sure.  In any event, several
others and myself were rushed to a rather remote place in
upstate Pennsylvannia.

We were informed that every thing was top secret, and had to
remain that way.  We were even housed in a hotel close by,
and security people were assigned to us.  Some type of
aircraft had crashed in this area, and the government felt
that it would be easier and faster to do all of their
investigation right there rather than to move the remains of
the wreck, and whatever evidence the soil may contain.

The wreck site was rather difficult to get to, however, we
turned it into a construction site, clearing the area, and
building two small and one very large metal pre-fab buildings
over and around the wreck.  Heavy equipment, materials, and
workers were flown in and out on a daily basis.

We were moved from the hotel to some mobile homes that were
brought in for us, and many more top level people who joined
us.  I might add that the local people who still lived some
distance from the site, were led to believe that a large
private corporation was preparing to build an electrical
power supply for the area.  But it was off limits to everyone
in the area.

We were some of the first ones on the scene other than lots
of security people.  The wreck had already been covered by
very large canvas blankets, and large nets were tented over
head to protect the site from any possible air traffic.  I
did manage to get a very good look at the wreck on several
occasions.  My first thoughts were that it may have been and
experimental air craft of our government, or perhaps the
government of another.

It was later suggested to us that it was a new type of air
craft of a foreign government, and it was a super hush hush
project.  That air craft was nothing like I have ever seen or
probably ever will again.

The crash site was also something quite different.  The
disturbed soil was about a hundred feet in diameter, although
the craft was much larger in length.  I only saw what
appeared to be about two/thirds of the rear end, and even
that was about ten feet below the surface.  When it crashed
on about a 30 degree angle, it pushed all the earth back away
from the craft itself.  Almost as if the hole were made
first, and then something half the size was put in place.

My best thought of this rather strange hole is that some kind
of magnetic field had pushed all the earth away from the
craft at impact.  It was reasonable to assume that I was
looking down at the rear end of the air craft, yet there was
nothing to indicate that it had any kind of engine as we know
it.  Not even one little opening.

I don't really like to use the term cigar, but since I could
not see the front part, it certainly appeared to have once
been shaped like a large cigar.  That's by best description.

If it was a craft from a foreign government, then we are in
big trouble.  I actually held one small portion of the wreck
in my hand.  Incidently, there was only a very small reading
of radio waves in the area.  The area was quite safe.  There
was on the other hand, a great deal of free magnetic energy
in that area.  It was very difficult using our instruments.
It was very difficult just to establish the correct time.
Every wrist watch was a different time.

The piece of physical evidence that I held in my hand, was a
material that I really can't identify.  It may have been torn
from the front of the craft when it crashed.  A few of us
compared thoughts as to what it might be, but no one was
really certain.  None of us had ever seen anything like it
before.  It was about one square foot and about an inch
thick.  It weighed almost nothing, and one had the feeling
that it may blow away if you let go of it and the wind
increased.
