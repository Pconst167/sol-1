                   "SAUCER" SOARS OVER INDIANA

MICHIGAN CITY, Ind., April 28 (UP) - An amatuer radio operator
said that the pilot of a private plane had reported having seen
a "flying disk" sailing over this city today.

   The radio operator, Floyd Zerber, said he was listening to a
conversation between a pilot who identified himself a Leon A.
Faber, Sandwich, Ill., and amatuers on the ground in this area.
"Hey, there's one of those flying discs", Zerber said Faber
exclaimed. He said that Faber reported he was flying 145 miles
an hour at an altitude of 3,000 feet over the Indiana state
prison on a flight from Peoria, Ill. to Lansing, Mich.

   "Wait a minute, what have you been drinking," Faber was asked,
according to Zerber.

   "I'm serious," said Farber. "It looks like a big aluminum disc
and it's spinning very fast. It can't be a weather ballon because
it's headed east against the wind and it's moving too fast."
