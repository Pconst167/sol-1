SUBJECT: OPEN LETTER REGARDING PROJECT RED LIGHT             FILE: UFO1804



April 20, 1980

______________ ______________ ______________

Dear ________,

I read your letter of the 13th with considerable interest. It seems
difficult to believe that I have finally found someone that is as
interested in finding out the true story of Project Red Light.

First of all I would like to address the specific points requested in your
letter, and then I will expand on them and other items as well.

1.  I did not know about the UFO movie prior to reading your article.

2.  I found out the name of Project Redlight almost by accident.  I was
____________________________________________ in a warehouse at Area 51 and
saw a large number of wooden shipping crates (the type made with tongue and
groove lumber and used for shipping heavy items securely) with the code
name "Project Redlight" written with grease pen or felt tip pen.  Also on
the crates was a stencilled "Edwards AFB" in standard military type of
letters.

3.  The article in Readers Digest that I referred to was about a UFO that
flew over the US from the East Coast to where it "blew up" somewhere over
eastern Nevada.  The article did not state that the pilot was human.  I'm
sorry for the confusion on this.  The reason that I felt that this Digest
article is important is that I remember a period shortly after the date
given in the article (I don't remember what it was, sorry) everything came
to a screeching halt at Area 51.  As you can see, I am just putting two and
two together, but I am satisfied that the UFO of the Digest article and the
UFO of Project Redlight are/were one and the same.

Now for some additional information that has come to mind since I talked to
you.

Your report about the motorcycle riders is interesting.  I can remember
hearing similar rumors while I worked on the test site and I would not
doubt the authenticity of your report.  The security force at Area 51 while
I serviced the Area were heavily armed and I considered them dangerous.
There  were several times that I was in the wrong place at the right time
and had it not been provable that I was not snooping or trying to snoop I
really don't think I would be writing you this letter.  Incidentally, the
security wore standard air police uniforms but looked nothing like any of
the AP's I have ever dealt with.  They were all in their 30's to 40's, and
looked like dock  workers.  Also, as I remember it, the only markings they
wore just said Air Police.  They did not have Nellis AFB on anything but a
few of their vehicles, and I believe that they were assigned to Edwards
rather than Nellis.  The reason I remember this is that it seemed strange
to me during my first trip to Area 51 I noticed a slight difference in
their uniforms from Nellis AP's, and I over heard a couple of remarks that
indicated they were from Edwards.

Another interesting point.  I was accustomed to going out onto the Bombing
and Gunnery Range and had a number at Indian springs (Nellis AFB maintains
a forward area base there) to call to get clearence onto the range.  This
was SOP. How ever, in the case of Area 51 I called the security office at
Area 51.  This indicated to me that Nellis AFB had nothing to do with the
operation of Area 51.  Also the designation of Area 51 was classified TOP
SECRET.

Incidentally, although I carried a "Q" clearance from the Atomic Energy
Commission as well as an inter agency TOP SECRET clearance I was
investigated for a special Air Force TOP SECRET clearance in order to
operate in Area 51. 

At this point I am going to give you just a series of disconnected
observations that I made in the hope that they may tie in with something
you or Len Stringfield may know.

1.  I saw some crates being unloaded from a cargo plane.  The aircraft was
a super constellation with standard markings and had nothing to indicate it
had any military connections. There was no airline name on it.

2.  I only saw the UFO one time.  It was on the ground and partly hidden
behind a building and at first I thought it was a small private aircraft
until I noticed it had no wings or tail.  I was probably 1/2 mile or
farther from it but I would guess it 20 to 30 feet in diameter and sort of
a pewter color rather than bright polished aluminium.

3.  The reason I know it flew silently is I was present on a number of
occasions when it was landing or taking off (I was always taken inside and
out of view of the runway at these times) and at no time did I hear
anything that sounded like a conventional or any other kind of engine.

4.  I was working on their ______ several times when they just_______.
However since I was there to work on them I really didn't think anything
about it.  Oh yes, they would ___________ again just as suddenly.  Also
there were a number of times that I was called out to work on ______ and
could not find anything wrong with it.                                     
                

5. One of the men that I knew were "Pilots" was just slightly larger than
me. 

6.  Most of the test flights occurred in the daytime rather than at night.

7.  The radio frequency they used at that time was in the regular
commercial VHF band and was a simplex frequency.  At one time I had the
Freq. written down but I have no idea now what it was.  Anyway, I really
think that someone with a scanner could pick them up if they were to park
on the road to the east of the test site and use some kind of directional
antenna.

8.  Before I send this letter I will try to get a USC&GS map of the area
and will mark the location of Area 51 on it.

9.  There was a Radar Station at the north end of the test site near the
town of Tonopah, Nevada.  A fellow from my home town of _______,________
was an operator there.  His name is __________  __________ . We were
talking about the test site one day when he mentioned that he was always
picking up UFOs over the test site but was told to ignore them.  I remember
him telling about one that he picked up on the edge of his RBI on the first
revolution was directly overhead on the second pass and was just going off
the scope on the third revolution of the antenna.

10.  For some reason I seem to remember that the Redlight is spelled
Redlight i.e. all one word.

11.  I always had the impression that the flight test area was from Area 51
north because there is a natural valley that runs in that  direction for
200 miles or so.  Also the area to the south was more populated.  Also I
entered Area 51 from the north and there were a couple of times that I was
questioned about whether I had 'noticed' anything on the way in.

12.  I was reminded constantly that no matter what I saw I could be in
serious trouble if I ever talked about any of it. I can't stress how much
how tight the security was, it was almost paranoid.

13.  I don't think this has anything to do with Redlight, but I remember
when I was a kid back in the 40's, on two occasions I saw a story about
UFOs included in the weekly Pathe' News.  There was one story about a UFO
that had crashed somewhere and another story about a UFO thaqt was found in
some farmers barn.  Both of those stories were given the usual news
treatment.  The reason that I am mentioning this is that I recently read an
article about the entire library of Pathe' movie film being given to an
institution of some kind which would make it available to researchers.  I
am certain that if these film clips could be located they would be useful. 
Realizing that these stories appeared prior to Blue Book and at a time of
Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, there is probably a better than even chance
that they can be located by someone willing to spend the time viewing a few
hundred hours of old news film.

14.  More on item #7, the air-to-ground frequencies were in th e 200mc
range. I believe there is a standard set of air-to -ground or government
frequencies either just above or just below the 220mc ham band and their
communications were on those frequencies.  

Well there you  have it ______.  I hope that I have shed some light on some
dark areas.  Should any other thoughts come to mind that I feel may be
important I will try to catch you on the ____________.  Hopefully if I can
get things settled down to a dull roar I will be able to start checking in
on a more permanent basis.  Of course, should you have any questions or
want further clarification please contact me.

NOTE...Any information that would identify the sender or recipient of this
letter has been deleted in order to protect them.  The original document
contains both names and addresses but will be given to no one without their
permission.  The reason Len Stringfield's name is left in is that he is a
known UFO researcher and it cannot hurt him as he was not the sender or
receiver.
