===================================================================

"Last Monday night, about 10:30," said Alexander Hamilton, "we were
awakened by a noise among the cattle. I arose, thinking that
perhaps my bulldog was performing some of his pranks, but upon
going to the door saw to my utter astonishment an airship [U.F.O.]
slowly descending upon my cow lot, about 40 rods from the house.

Calling my tenant, Gid Heslip, and my son Wall, we seized some axes
and ran to the corral. Meanwhile, the ship had been gently
descending until it was not more than 30 feet above the ground, and
we came within 50 yards of it.

It consisted of a great cigar-shaped portion, possibly 300 feet
long, with a carriage underneath. The carriage was made of glass or
some other transparent substance [poss. aerolite substance]
alternating with a narrow strip of material [poss. airfoil]. It was
brilliantly lighted within and everything was plainly visible - it
was occupied by six of the strangest beings I ever saw [poss.
Alien]. They were jabbering together, but we could not understand
a word they said.

Every part of the vessel which was not transparent was of a dark
reddish color [poss. negative ion type propulsion]. We stood mute
with wonder and fright, when some noise attracted their attention
and they turned a light directly upon us. Immediately on catching
sight of us they turned on some unknown power [Power-up], and a
great turbine wheel [poss. generator & electromagnetic driver as
main power source], about 30 feet in diameter, which was slowly
revolving below the craft began to buzz [common sound of ion arc]
and the vessel rose lightly as a bird [Negative Repulsion]. When
about 300 feet above us it seemed to pause and hover directly over
a 2 year old heifer, which was bawling and jumping, apparently fast
in the fence. Going to her, we found a cable about a 1/2" in
thickness made of some red material [sim. to Soviet Rocks found to
be not of earth substance, also red in Oct. 1989 at UFO landing],
fastened in a slip knot around her neck, one end passing up to the
vessel, and the heifer tangled in the wire fence. We tried to get
it off but could not, so we cut the wire loose and stood in
amazement to see the ship, heifer and all, rise slowly,
disappearing in the northwest.

We went home, but I was so frightened I could not sleep.  Rising
early Tuesday, I started out by horse, hoping to find some trace of
my cow. This I failed to do, but coming back in the evening found
that Link Thomas, about 3 or 4 miles west of Le Roy, had found the
hide, legs and head in his field that day. He, thinking someone had
butchered a stolen beast, had brought the hide to town for I.D.,
but was greatly mystified in not being able to find any tracks in
the soft ground. After I.D. was made of the hide by my brand, I
went home. But every time I would fall to sleep I would see
[visions] the cursed thing [U.F.O.], with its big lights and
hideous people.  I don't know whether they are devils or angels, or
what; but we all saw them, and my whole family saw the ship, and I
don't want any more to do with them.

Hamilton has long been a resident of Kansas and is known all over
Woodson, Allen, Coffey and Anderson counties. He was a member of
the House of Representatives. He staked his sacred honor upon the
truth of is story.

An affidavit follows:

As there are now, always have been and always will be skeptics and
unbelievers whenever the truth of any thing bordering the
improbable is presented, and knowing that some ignorant or
suspicious people will doubt the truthfulness of the above
statement, now, therefore, we, the undersigned, do hereby make the
following affidavit:

That we have known Alexander Hamilton for 1 to 30 years, and that
for the truth and veracity we do verily believe his statement to be
true and correct.
