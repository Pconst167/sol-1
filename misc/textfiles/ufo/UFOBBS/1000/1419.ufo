PENTAGON TO CURTAIL ELECTOMAGNETIC TESTS
(Environmental Impact Study Required for Experiments 
Involving a Type of Radiation)


SPECIAL REPORT: WFBR 1300 AM - BOB OECHSLER

     We've been reporting our investigations over the past several
weeks into the activities surrounding the Bay Bridge UFO Sightings
in Annapolis and our inquiries into the possible interest these
UFO's might have in this area.

     Our theory was that perhaps they may have more than a 
passing interest in the EMP tests (electromagnetic pulse) that we
discovered were being conducted in the area.  It was reported
that MORE THAN A MILLION FISH WERE KILLED in the Chesapeake
Bay during one of these tests early this year.  We reported that
a suit had been filed in federal court against the government to 
stop the testing.  Discussions with officials at EPA resulted in a plea 
of ignorance.  An official with the Navy indicated that the EMP
tests were probably the result of degaussing of ships in the Bay.

     Today in the Washington Post it was announced that The Defense
Department, under a legal agreement reached Friday night, must
stop or moderate its electromagnetic pulse experiments at 
laboratories in Maryland, Virginia, Alabama and New Mexico 
until the government determines whether the energy is harming
people and wildlife.

       The article goes on to say that electromagnetic pulse (EMP)
is one type of radiation generated by nuclear explosions.  The 
Pentagon has been simulating EMP to determine how to protect
the circuitry in its planes, tanks and ships from being disabled
by it.  The Soviet Union, according to duscussions with the Pentagon,
is far along on a "zap gun" that would use EMP radiation to kill
troops and disable vehicles, and the Pentagon is interested in
developing a similar weapon.

     The Justice Department, representing the Pentagon, reached the
agreement this weekend with the Foundation on Economic Trends,
an environmental group that sued on the grounds that the
experiments were proceeding without the government first assessing
their potential harm.  The foundation had taken steps to question
two employees of a Woodbridge, Virginial laboratory constructing
EMP generators, about their environmental concerns and the 
alleged suppression of documents when the Justice Department
suddenly decided to settle the case.

     The settlement states that the Navy's EMP facilities at Patuxent,
Maryland Naval Air Station must be operated at low voltage, not
more than one kilovolt per meter, until the environmental risks
are assessed.  AND the Navy's Empress I EMP simulator in the 
middle of the Chesapeake Bay may not be operated at all until
the impact of its pulses is assessed.  The projected Empress II
pulse generator can not be built unless the  Pentagon first
files an environmental impact statement.

     What impact will this have on UFO activity over these areas?
Only time will tell.
