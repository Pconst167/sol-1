     Gulf  Breeze,  FLA.   (UPI) -- Photographs of an eerily  lit
cylindrical object drifting through the night sky have scientists
debating  whether  unidentified flying objects are  visiting  the
Florida Panhandle.

     More  than 135 Gulf Breeze's 6,000 residents  have  reported
seeing  a  strange craft hovering in the skies over the past  one
and a half years, the Tampa Tribune reported Sunday.

     One resident, asked to be identified only as "Ed" to protect
his anonymity,  has produced startling photographs of the alleged
UFO.   Those  pictures,  showing a cylindrical craft ringed  with
lights and what may be windows,  lie at the heart of a  simmering
battle between two UFO investigating groups.

     The  Mutual UFO Network,  a 20-year-old group of  scientists
and layman researchers, believes Ed's pictures are real.  But the
Center  for  UFO Studies,  a non-profit group found by  the  late
astronomer, J. Allen Hynek, does not.

     The  network  cites a 90-page study done by  Navy  physicist
Bruce  Maccabee.   Maccabee  said  Ed could not  have  made  such
perfect fakes, and that the pictures are real.

     "A  professional magician would have a difficult time  doing
this," he said.

     Maccabee  also cites circumstantial evidence in Ed's  favor,
including  sightings  by others who described UFOs  identical  to
those in Ed's photos.

     The  center  relies  on its own researchers  and  on  Robert
Nathan of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Nathan, who conceded
he  had  not studied the pictures as completely as did  Maccabee,
said  the photos show glaring inconsistencies typical  of  double
exposures.

     Mark  Rodeghier of the Center for UFO Studies said the  Gulf
Breeze  case had "deteriorated into a shouting match" because his
group  was  forced  to play devil's  advocate  when  the  network
endorsed the pictures.  That endorsement biased Maccabee's study,
he said.

     "Except  those  intimately connected with  the  network,  90
percent  of serious UFO researchers think Gulf Breeze is a hoax,"
Rodeghier said.

     For  many Gulf Breeze residents,  what the experts think  is
beside the point -- they know what they saw.

     "I  was  exhilarated," said Brenda Pollak,  a  City  Council
member who said she saw a large, lighted craft twice in one night
in spring of 1988.   Ms.  Pollak said she watched the craft hover
over Pensacola Bay while, unknown to her, Ed shot pictures of the
UFO from only a few blocks away.

     "I can tell you now -- for every one person who has reported
seeing  the craft,  there are 10 who talk about it but don't want
anyone to know," Ms. Pollack said.

     "I'm not saying that I believe it's from another planet, but
it's  something  I  had never laid eyes on  in  my  life,"  added
Shirley McConnell.   Mrs.  McConnell and her husband,  who is the
medical examiner for Florida's District 1, say that last June the
craft  hovered  within  75 yards of their house for  nearly  four
minutes before drifting off.

     "People can say whatever they want about me, but I know what
I saw.  Ed didn't make this up," Mrs. McConnell said.
