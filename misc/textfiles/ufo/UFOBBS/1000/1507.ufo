           Of all sightings in Australia none has generated so
     much
       worldwide attention and concern than that of Fredrick
     Valentich,
       a twenty year old flying instructor who disappeared in his
     Cessna
       182 aircraft shortly after reporting a UFO sighting over
     Bass
       Strait near Cape Otway, on a flight from Moorabin,
     Victoria, to
       King Island, Tasmania on October 21/1978.
           Forty-seven minutes after taking off from Moorabin
     Airport,
       Melbourne, at 6:19 pm, Valentich reported seeing an
     unidentified
       aircraft to the Melbourne Flight Service Unit Controller,
     Steve
       Robey.  The official transcript of the recorded
     transmission
       between the Cessna (registration VH-DSJ) and Melbourne
     Flight
       Service Unit (FSU) is provided here.  The following
       communications between the aircraft and Melbourne FSU were
       recorded from 19:06 hours.

     Seismicity Report for Northern California, the Nation, and
     the World for the week of January 9 - 15, 1992

     Data and text prepared by Steve Walter, Barry Hirshorn, and
     Allan Lindh U.S. Geological Survey 345 Middlefield Rd.  MS-
     977, Menlo Park, CA  94025 Graphics by Quentin Lindh

     San Francisco Bay Area

            Seismicity remained low in the Bay Area during the
     past 7 days with minor activity along the San Andreas,
     southern Calaveras, and Concord faults.
         During the 7-day period ending at midnight on Wednesday,
     January 15, 1992 the U.S. Geological Survey office in Menlo
     Park recorded 27 earthquakes of magnitude one (M1) and
     greater within the San Francisco Bay area shown in Figure 1.
     Only four were as large as M2, including one M3 event.  This
     compares to only 18 earthquakes greater than M1 recorded
     during the previous 7-day period, three of which were as
     large as M2.0.
         The largest earthquake in the Bay Area during the week
     was a M3.1 earthquake that occurred last Friday morning on
     the Calaveras fault, about 5 miles northeast of Gilroy
     (#2/1).  It was accompanied by two M1 aftershocks.  This
     segment of the Calaveras has experienced a number of M2
     events in the past year though none were as large as this
     week's M3 event.  The Calaveras fault was otherwise quiet
     during the past week.
          The Concord fault experienced three small earthquakes
     last Friday and Saturday evenings (#3/1).  The largest of
     OO 2-03                      Page 6                    8 Feb 1992


     these was only M2.0 and no reports were received that any
     were felt.
          As usual, a number of small earthquakes occurred along
     the creeping segment of the San Andreas.  The largest of
     these were a pair of M2.3 events that occurred within
     seconds of each other last Sunday morning (#4/1).  Both were
     located about 4 miles northeast of Watsonville.


     Northern California

          Seismicity remained at low levels throughout the rest
     of northern and central California during the past week.
     Only 18 earthquakes larger than M2 were recorded in the area
     of figure 2, down from 34 during the previous week and close
     to the lowest weekly total observed in the past year--17
     events during the last week of April.
          In northern California, three M2 earthquakes were
     observed in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino.  The largest of
     these were two offshore earthquakes that occurred Sunday
     evening along the Mendocino escarpment (#3/2).  Both had
     similar magnitudes of about M2.6.  A slightly smaller
     earthquake occurred onshore of Cape Mendocino last Friday
     about 24 miles south-southeast of Eureka (#1/2).  A M2.2
     earthquake occurred Wednesday evening, Jan. 15, beneath the
     northern Sacramento Valley 7 miles east-southeast of Redding
     (#5/2).

          In central California the San Andreas was completely
     quiet at the M2 level, with the exception of the two
     Watsonville earthquakes discussed above.  The only notable
     earthquakes in central California were two events that
     occurred Tuesday beneath the Diablo Range near Coalinga
     (#4/2).  One of these was the week's largest earthquake, a
     M3.8 event that occurred about 13 miles north-northwest of
     Coalinga.
          Some activity occurred in the eastern Sierra-Nevada
     including a M2.9 event 15 miles south of Lone Pine (#2/2)
     and a M2.1 event 20 miles northwest of China Lake.

     Long Valley Caldera

           Activity remained low in the vicinity of the Long
     Valley caldera, both within the caldera and in the Sierra-
     Nevada terrane to the south. The only earthquake as large as
     M2 was a M2.2 event in the southeast corner of the caldera
     near the northern end of the Hilton Creek fault and very
     close to last week's lone M2 event (#2/3).  Three other M1
     events occurred near the northern end of the Hilton Creek
     fault and four M1 events occurred at the western end of the
     south moat area, near the town of Mammoth Lakes.

     USA Seismicity

        The National Earthquake Information Center recorded only
     one notable earthquake in the lower 48 states during the
     OO 2-03                      Page 7                    8 Feb 1992


     past week, a M3.0 event in central New Jersey (#1/4).  This
     small temblor occurred early last Thursday morning and was
     felt throughout Monmouth and Middlesex counties.

     The Planet Earth

        The number of notable earthquakes worldwide remained low
     during the past week with only one earthquake as large as M6
     and only seven as large as M5.  The week's sole M6
     earthquake occurred Monday near Halmahera Island in the
     central Indonesian archipelago (#5/5).
         M5 earthquakes occurred beneath the central Philippines
     (#3/5), in southern Greece (#1/5), in the northern Easter
     Islands region (#2/5), beneath the Bay of Bengal (#4/5), and
     in the Dominican Republic region (#6/5).
         Two M4.9 earthquakes occurred that are worth noting.
     The first occurred near the coast of Venezuela last Thursday
     and was felt at Port of Spain, Trinidad as well as at
     coastal communities in Venezuela.  The second occurred late
     Sunday night offshore of Vancouver Island, British Columbia
     (#2/4).  This location is just slightly northeast of a M6.1
     earthquake that occurred last week.

     * Seti Protocalls


     Following some recent discussion of the SETI Protocols on
     the network, Robert Arnold of the SETI Institute has sent me
     an electronic version of the SETI Protocols.  Here now is
     the material:


     Date: 10 Jan 92 10:11:52 U Subject: Re: Electronic SETI
     Protocols To: skingsle@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu From:
     bob_arnold@qmgate.arc.nasa.gov



               Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities
     Following
                    the Detection of Extraterrestrial
     Intelligence


     We, the institutions and individuals participating in the
     search for extra-terrestrial intelligence,

     Recognizing that the search for extraterrestrial
     intelligence is an integral part of space exploration and is
     being undertaken for peaceful purposes and for the common
     interest of all mankind,

     Inspired by the profound significance for mankind of
     detecting evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, even
     though the probability of detection may be low,

     Recalling the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities
     of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,
     Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which commits
     States Parties to that Treaty "to inform the Secretary
     General of the United Nations as well as the public and the
     international scientific community, to the greatest extent
     feasible and practicable, of the, nature, conduct, locations
     and results" of their space exploration activities (Article
     XI),

     Recognizing that any initial detection may be incomplete or
     ambiguous and thus require careful examination as well as
     confirmation, and that it is essential to maintain the
     highest standards of scientific responsibility and
     credibility,

     Agree to observe the following principles for disseminating
     information about the detection of extraterrestrial
     intelligence:

     1.   Any individual, public or private research institution,
     or governmental
          agency that believes it has detected a signal from or
     OO 2-03                      Page 11                   8 Feb 1992


     other evidence of
          extraterrestrial intelligence (the discoverer) should
     seek to verify
          that the most plausible explanation for the evidence is
     the existence
          of extraterrestrial intelligence rather than some other
     natural
          phenomenon or anthropogenic phenomenon before making
     any public
          announcement.  If the evidence cannot be confirmed as
     indicating the
          existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, the
     discoverer may
          disseminate the information as appropriate to the
     discovery of any
          unknown phenomenon.

     2.   Prior to making a public announcement that evidence of
     extraterrestrial
          intelligence has been detected, the discoverer should
     promptly inform
          all other observers or research organizations that are
     parties to this
          declaration, so that those other parties may seek to
     confirm the
          discovery by independent observations at other sites
     and so that a
          network can be established to enable continuous
     monitoring of the
          signal or phenomenon.  Parties to this declaration
     should not make any
          public announcement of this information until it is
     determined whether
          this information is or is not credible evidence of the
     existence of
          extraterrestrial intelligence.  The discoverer should
     inform his/her or
          its relevant national authorities.

     3.   After concluding that the discovery appears to be
     credible evidence of
          extraterrestrial intelligence, and after informing
     other parties to
          this declaration, the discoverer should inform
     observers throughout the
          world through the Central Bureau for Astronomical
     Telegrams of the
          International Astronomical Union, and should inform the
     Secretary
          General of the United Nations in accordance with
     Article XI of the
          Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States
     in the
          Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon
     and Other
          Bodies.  Because of their demonstrated interest in and
     OO 2-03                      Page 12                   8 Feb 1992


     expertise
          concerning the question of the existence of
     extraterrestrial
          intelligence, the discoverer should simultaneously
     inform the following
          international institutions of the discovery and should
     provide them
          with all pertinent data and recorded information
     concerning the
          evidence:  the International Telecommunication Union,
     the Committee on
          Space Research, of the International Council of
     Scientific Unions, the
          International Astronautical Federation, the
     International Academy of
          Astronautics, the International Institute of Space Law,
     Commission 51
          of the International Astronomical Union and Commission
     J of the
          International Radio Science Union.

     ----Cont in part 2------------------------------------------
     ----------------

     4.   A confirmed detection of extraterrestrial intelligence
     should be
          disseminated promptly, openly, and widely through
     scientific channels
          and public media, observing the procedures in this
     declaration.  The
          discoverer should have the privilege of making the
     first public
          announcement.

     5.   All data necessary for confirmation of detection should
     be made
          available to the international scientific community
     through
          publications, meetings, conferences, and other
     appropriate means.

     6.   The discovery should be confirmed and monitored and any
     data bearing on
          the evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be
     recorded and
          stored permanently to the greatest extent feasible and
     practicable, in
          a form that will make it available for further analysis
     and
          interpretation.  These recordings should be made
     available to the
          international institutions listed above and to members
     of the
          scientific community for further objective analysis and
     interpretation.

     OO 2-03                      Page 13                   8 Feb 1992


     7.   If the evidence of detection is in the form of
     electromagnetic signals,
          the parties to this declaration should seek
     international agreement to
          protect the appropriate frequencies by exercising
     procedures available
          through the International Telecommunication Union.
     Immediate notice
          should be sent to the Secretary General of the ITU in
     Geneva, who may
          include a request to minimize transmissions on the
     relevant frequencies
          in the Weekly Circular.  The Secretariat, in
     conjunction with advice of
          the Union's Administrative Council, should explore the
     feasibility and
          utility of convening an Extraordinary Administrative
     Radio Conference
          to deal with the matter, subject to the opinions of the
     member
          Administrations of the ITU.

     8.   No response to a signal or other evidence of
     extraterrestrial
          intelligence should be sent until appropriate
     international
          consultations have taken place.  The procedures for
     such consultations
          will be the subject of a separate agreement,
     declaration or
          arrangement.

     9.   The SETI Committee of the International Academy of
     Astronautics, in
          coordination with Commission 51 of the International
     Astronomical
          Union, will conduct a continuing review of procedures
     for the detection
          of extraterrestrial intelligence and the subsequent
     handling of the
          data.  Should credible evidence of extraterrestrial
     intelligence be
          discovered, an international committee of scientists
     and other experts
          should be established to serve as a focal point for
     continuing analysis
          of all observational evidence collected in the
     aftermath of the
          discovery, and also to provide advice on the release of
     information to
          the public.  This committee should be constituted from
     representatives
          of each of the international institutions listed above
     and such other
          members as the committee may deem necessary.

     To facilitate the convocation of such a committee at some
     unknown time in the future, the SETI Committee of the
     International Academy of Astronautics should initiate and
     maintain a current list of willing representatives from each
     of the international institutions listed above, as well as
     other individuals with relevant skills, and should make that
     list continuously available through the Secretariat of the
     International Academy of Astronautics.  The International
     Academy of Astronautics will act as the Depository for this
     declaration and will annually provide a current list of
     parties to all the parties to this declaration.

     SATURDAY SKYSHOW ON TAP AS ASTRONOMERS PREPARE FOR RARE
     ECLIPSE, METEOR SHOWER

     (JAN. 3) UPI - Amateur and professional astronomers alike
     geared up for a double- barreled celestial skyshow
     Saturday, a pre-dawn meteor shower visible across North
     America and a rare sunset solar eclipse visible from the
     far Western United States.

     The potentially spectacular partial eclipse of the sun was
     expected to be visible late in the day as Earth's star set
     on the western horizon.

     Unlike a widely seen total eclipse of the sun that thrilled
     spectators in Hawaii, Mexico and Central America last July,
     the event Saturday is known as an annular eclipse, one in
     which the moon moves directly in front of the sun but fails
     to fully cover the star's disk.

     In this case, the Earth is relatively close to the sun
     while the moon is nearly as far from Earth as it ever gets.

     Sky & Telescope magazine reported that the moon would cover
     just 91 percent of the sun at maximum, around 4:50 p.m.
     PST, creating a ring of light in the sky for observers in
     southwestern California near the coast.

     Edwin Krupp at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles said
     if the weather cooperates, the eclipse ''will be
     stunning.''

     ''A ring of fire will slip into the Pacific,'' he said.

     Observers along the coast of California, from near Oxnard
     to Los Angeles and San Diego, expected to see the moon move
     directly across the sun's disk, weather permitting,
     creating a rare annular eclipse at sunset.

     Spectators in Mexico, western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,
     Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Oregon,
     Washington, northwest Canada and Alaska awaited a partial
     eclipse, one in which the sun's disk would appear crescent
     shaped.

     The unusual celestial event - with the moon blocking the
     sun at sunset - occurs at any given location only about
     once every 20,000 years.

     But forecasters said cloud cover threatened to ruin the day

     for Southern Californians planning to watch the eclipse.

     ''There is a chance that people won't be able to see it,''
     said Scott Entrekin
     a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ''It's
     really going to be a hit-and-miss proposition.''

     In any case, spectators should take precautions whenever
     viewing the sun. While the sun will not be as bright near
     the horizon as it is when it is high in the sky, experts
     said one should never look directly at the sun long enough
     for heat to build up on the retina.

     ''The usual eclipse warnings about danger to eyesight from
     looking at the sun may not apply in their usual simple form
     for this event,'' writes Alan MacRobert in Sky & Telescope.
     ''A setting sun, dimmed and reddened to an unpredictable
     degree, presents too many uncertainties.''

     ''Thus, prudence would dictate taking only brief looks even
     when the sun is fairly comfortable to view,'' he writes.
     ''Don't stare long enough for heat to build up on your
     retina.''

     While the eclipse was limited to observers in western North
     America and on islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean,
     a possibly spectacular meteor shower was expected to be
     visible across the United States early Saturday.

     The annual Quadrantid meteor shower, unrelated to the
     eclipse, was expected to peak around 5 a.m. EST.

     According to Sky & Telescope, observers with clear, dark
     skies could expect to see ''as many as 50 or possibly over
     100 meteors ... per hour before dawn.''

     ''The peak of the 'Quads'' last only a few hours,'' the
     magazine reports in its January issue. ''If you're watching
     when it arrives, this can be one of the year's best meteor
     displays.''

     WEST COAST RESIDENTS ANTICIPATE BRILLIANT SKYSHOW WITH
     SUNSET SOLAR ECLIPSE

     (JAN. 5) UPI - Astronomers aimed their telescopes Saturday
     and amateur stargazers stood in line to buy eyescreens in
     anticipation of a rare sunset solar eclipse expected to be
     visible along the West Coast.

     The eclipse - the second in the region in six months - was
     expected to be visible west of a line running from Oaxaca,
     Mexico, through eastern Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, to
     Alaska.

     The partial eclipse of the sun was expected to be visible
     late in the day as Earth's star set on the western horizon.

     Unlike a widely seen total eclipse of the sun that thrilled
     spectators in Hawaii, Mexico and Central America last July,
     Saturday's event is an annular eclipse, in which the moon
     moves directly in front of the sun but fails to fully cover
     the star's disk.

     In this case, the Earth is relatively close to the sun
     while the moon is nearly as far from Earth as it ever gets.

     Sky & Telescope magazine reported that the moon would cover
     just 91 percent of the sun at maximum, around 4:50 p.m.
     PST, creating a ring of light in the sky for observers in
     southwestern California near the coast.

     Edwin Krupp at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles said
     if the weather cooperates, the eclipse ''will be
     OO 2-03                      Page 19                   8 Feb 1992


     stunning.''

     ''A ring of fire will slip into the Pacific,'' he said.

     Observers along the coast of California, from near Oxnard
     to Los Angeles and San Diego, expected to see the moon move
     directly across the sun's disk, weather permitting,
     creating a rare annular eclipse at sunset.

     Spectators in Mexico, western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,
     Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Oregon,
     Washington, northwest Canada and Alaska awaited a partial
     eclipse, one in which the sun's disk would appear
     crescent-shaped.

     But forecasters warned clouds from the third storm in a
     week could spoil the celestial show in Southern California.

     Nevertheless, some residents booked window tables at their
     favorite restaurants in anticipation of the eclipse.

     Meteorolgists and astronomers cautioned spectators to take
     precautions when viewing the eclipse. Experts warned one
     should never look directly at the sun long enough for heat
     to build up on the retina.

     About 100 poeple lined up in front of the Reuben H. Fleet
     space theater in San Diego, which was selling $4 filters to
     view the eclipse.

     Griffith Observatory was also selling $5 orange filters
     designed to protect eyes while allowing enough light to
     pass through so that people can view the eclipse.

     NASA'S NEW DIRECTOR CRIPPEN REPORTS PLANS TO ELIMINATE
     5,000 JOBS BY 1996

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 6) UPI - NASA managers, trying to
     chop $500 million from the shuttle budget, plan to
     eliminate some 5,000 jobs across the nation by 1996, but an
     agency official said Monday safety will be maintained
     despite the cuts and a higher launch rate.

     Former astronaut Robert Crippen, who took over Jan. 1 as
     the new director of the Kennedy Space Center, told
     reporters that attrition alone will not save enough money
     to meet the projected budget and that an undetermined
     number of contractor layoffs will be required over the next
     few years to make up the difference.

     ''We're talking about cutting out of the shuttle program
     approximately $500 million by the time we get to '96,'' he
     said. ''You can translate that into approximately 5,000
     jobs across the country. We're going to be reducing, across
     the country, the number of people we put on shuttle.''

     The goal, announced late last year, is to cut the shuttle
     budget by 15 percent
     OO 2-03                      Page 22                   8 Feb 1992


     or about 3 percent per year, over the next five years. At
     the same time, the space agency is attempting to increase
     the number of shuttle flights conducted each year while
     maintaining strict safety standards.

     Crippen agreed that it will not be easy. But he said NASA's
     post- Challenger emphasis on flight safety will remain just
     as high in years to come as it is at present.

     ''There've been some insinuations that my arrival here at
     KSC was going to put a different focus on safety,'' Crippen
     told spaceport employees earlier Monday. ''Well, I'd like
     to borrow some words from the president ... read my lips.
     Safety is our number one concern and it will remain so.''

     Asked how he could maintain flight safety while
     implementing budget cuts and increasing the flight rate,
     Crippen said ''we have redundancy in several different
     areas. We believe there are some places in those that we
     can eliminate some of that redundancy without compromising
     the hardware or assuring that it's safe and ready to fly.''

     NASA launched six shuttle flights in 1991 while at least
     eight missions are on tap in 1992. Crippen said eight to 10
     flights likely would be the maximum the agency would be
     able to support in a given year.

     Crippen took the helm at the Florida shuttleport Jan. 1,
     replacing retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Forrest McCartney, who
     was forced to step down after five years on the job by
     William Lenoir, associate administrator for manned space
     flight.

     Crippen's arrival in Florida coincides with the
     implementation of a variety of proposed management changes
     in the shuttle program.

     The changes are the result of several outside studies that
     called for moving shuttle program managers, now based at
     the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Marshall Space
     Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., to the Kennedy Space
     Center.

     Leonard Nicholson, a top manager at the Johnson Space
     Center, recently was named to replace Crippen as shuttle
     program director.

     ''We're going to move that job from Washington here to
     Kennedy,'' Crippen said. ''And during this upcoming year,
     we're going to be looking across our management of the
     shuttle program to look at what other areas of management
     we'd like to move to KSC, both government and contractor.
     The who, what where and when of that has not been
     defined.''

     Critics have argued that the net effect of the plan will be
     OO 2-03                      Page 23                   8 Feb 1992


     to put officials from Johnson and Marshall in charge of
     shuttle processing, traditionally a Kennedy Space Center
     task. If so, critics say, channels of communications will
     be blurred and more intra-center rivalry will develop.

     Crippen disagreed Monday, saying: ''I believe that Kennedy
     is still going to be in charge of processing the
     hardware.''

     ''Our intent is that this is where all the shuttle hardware
     is,'' he said. ''This is where it's at. Consequently, this
     is the proper place to manage it instead of doing it long
     distance like I was doing from Washington (as shuttle
     program director).''

     NASA'S MAGELLAN PROBE SUFFERS RADIO PROBLEM DISRUPTING
     MAPPING OF VENUS

     (JAN. 6)  UPI - Problems with a critical radio transmitter
     aboard NASA's remarkably successful Magellan probe have
     forced engineers to interrupt the $550 million spacecraft's
     mapping of cloud-shrouded Venus, officials said Monday.

     The trouble developed Saturday and while the solar-powered
     spacecraft is equipped with a backup ''X-band''
     transmitter, that unit has a tendency to overheat, which
     degrades the quality of the science data that is beamed
     back to Earth.

     ''They appeared to have lost a component on the main
     downlink transmitter, that's the X-band,'' said James
     Doyle, a spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
     Pasadena, Calif. ''That stopped mapping.''

     When engineers switched to the backup transmitter, it
     overheated after about 25 minutes of operation. Last March,
     engineers discovered that the backup radio had a tendency
     to draw more power than expected, generating unwanted heat.
     Since then, Magellan has been using its primary transmitter
     to relay data back to Earth.

     ''The spacecraft is in good health in every other way,''
     Doyle said. ''They're going to study this apparently for
     quite a while. They've got to find out exactly what
     happened.''

     At least one of the two Motorola-built transmitters - each
     one is believed to have cost at least $1 million - is
     required to relay photo- like radar images of Venus back to
     Earth. Similar radios are in service aboard nearly two
     dozen other spacecraft, according to Magellan builder
     OO 2-03                      Page 24                   8 Feb 1992


     Martin Marietta Astronautics Group of Denver.

     Doyle said if the primary transmitter cannot be fixed,
     engineers would attempt to work around the backup radio's
     tendency to overheat. Should both transmitters ultimately
     prove inoperable, Magellan would be unable to continue
     mapping the surface of Venus.

     The 2,880-pound Magellan accomplished the primary goal of
     its mission last May 15, when it completed a 243-day radar
     mapping sequence covering more than 80 percent of the
     planet's once-hidden surface.

     Since then, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have
     been using the spacecraft to fill in blanks in coverage and
     to map the planet's south polar region. As of Saturday,
     Magellan had mapped more than 95 percent of Venus during
     more than 3,880 orbits.

     By any standards, the Magellan project repressents one of
     NASA's most successful missions, generating a flood of data
     that has allowed planetary scientists to create maps of
     Venus that are more accurate than those of Earth, where
     oceans prevent precise seabed mapping.

     NASA hopes to operate Magellan for nearly two more years at
     least, and while a failure now would deeply disappoint
     space scientists, program officials said enough data
     already has been returned to keep researchers busy for
     years to come.

     Launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, Magellan
     slipped into orbit around Venus on Aug. 19, 1990. The
     spacecraft uses radar beams instead of visible light to
     ''see'' through the thick clouds that block the planet's
     surface from view.

     After getting off to a shaky start - a faulty computer
     memory knocked the craft out of contact with Earth several
     times during initial operations - Magellan has been
     steadily mapping the hidden surface of Venus, stripping
     away the veils of mystery that have shrouded Earth's sister
     planet since antiquity.

     The tortured planet revealed by Magellan's radar imaging
     system is a hellish world dotted with giant volcanoes,
     impact craters, lava flows, mountain ranges and tremendous
     fault systems, a violent planet that appears to be active
     to this day.

     SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY'S CREW PREPARES FOR JAN. 22 LAUNCH

     OO 2-03                      Page 25                   8 Feb 1992


     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 7) UPI -  The shuttle Discovery's
     crew strapped in and worked through a smooth practice
     countdown Tuesday, setting the stage for takeoff Jan. 22 on
     a seven-day science mission.

     Wearing bulky, bright-orange spacesuits, the six-man,
     one-woman crew climbed aboard the $2 billion spaceplane
     early Tuesday for the final hours of the ''terminal
     countdown demonstration test,'' an exercise designed to
     give the launch team and the astronauts a chance to
     practice launch-day procedures.

     At 11:01 a.m. EST, the two-day countdown was stopped at the
     T-minus 4-second mark after the simulated ignition and
     shutdown of Discovery's three main engines.

     Commander Ronald Grabe, 46, co-pilot Stephen Oswald, 40,
     Norman Thagard, 48, William Readdy, 39, David Hilmers, 41,
     Canadian researcher Roberta Bondar, 46, and European
     scientist Ulf Merbold, 50, then practiced emergency launch
     pad escape procedures.

     All seven planned to fly back to the Johnson Space Center
     in Houston later in the day for final training.

     ''Everything went as planned in today's countdown test,''
     said NASA spokesman Mitch Varnes. ''The managers feel we
     have a healthy vehicle and are on schedule for a launch.''

     An official launch date will not be set until Thursday, but
     engineers are shooting for a liftoff at 8:54 a.m. Jan. 22.
     Launch will mark the first of at least eight missions
     planned for 1992.

     Nestled in Discovery's cargo bay is a European-built
     Spacelab laboratory module loaded with materials science

     LOCKHEED LAB COMPLETES FIELD TEST ON SOLUTION TO WIND SHEAR
     AND SPACE LAUNCHES

     PALO ALTO, CA (JAN. 8) BUSINESS WIRE - Lockheed Palo Alto
     OO 2-03                      Page 26                   8 Feb 1992


     Research Laboratory and Coherent Technologies Inc. of
     Boulder, Colo., have completed a field test program at NASA
     Kennedy Space Center to evaluate using the world's most
     powerful solid-state coherent laser radar to detect wind
     shear in the atmosphere above the space shuttle launch
     site. Lockheed Project Manager James Hawley directed the
     effort.

     The Coherent Launch-Site Atmospheric Wind Sounder (CLAWS)
     is a lidar atmospheric wind sensor designed to measure the
     winds aloft at space launch facilities to an altitude of 20
     kilometers (16 miles).

     The aim of the field test program is to appraise the
     ability of CLAWS to meet NASA goals for increased safety
     and launch/mission flexibility at Kennedy Space Center.


     The National Research Council, in a 1988 report entitled
     ''Meteorological Support for Space Operations,'' recognized
     the importance of high fidelity measurement of weather
     phenomena ''to make all phases of the manned and unmanned
     space programs more efficient, less threatened by delay,
     and free of weather-related hazards that could lead to
     damage or loss of spacecraft of even human lives.''

     Wind shear, the sudden and violent change of wind
     direction, was of particular concern to the authors of the
     report. They acknowledged that severe wind shear
     encountered by the Challenger space shuttle on Jan. 28,
     1986 may have contributed to the accident which ended in
     the loss of the orbiter and cost the lives of seven
     astronauts.

     Present approaches to the measurement of wind shear involve
     the release and tracking weather balloons to launch.
     Because there is often an hour delay between these
     measurements and launch, the result is at best a crude
     picture of the dynamics of the atmosphere along the flight
     path of the launch vehicle.

     Lockheed's approach, CLAWS, utilizes a powerful
     ground-based lidar, or laser radar, that measures wind
     velocities along the flight path. It accomplishes this by
     comparing the frequency of the laser pulses with the light
     reflected back from the moving aerosols, or suspended
     particles, in the atmosphere. Wind velocity is proportional
     to the change in frequency of the light reflected back to
     the instrument.

     These measurements are made in real-time and can continue
     during vehicle flight, thus making available valuable data
     that could be uplinked to the guidance and control systems
     of the vehicle. Also under study is the potential for
     incorporating a CLAWS instrument aboard present and future
     launch vehicles.

     The CLAWS instrument can be used to support both the launch
     and landing operations of the space shuttle, as well as
     expendable vehicles. Lockheed is the prime contractor for
     the program. The program is managed by NASA Langley
     Research Center, Hampton, Va.

     U.S. SCIENTISTS FIND TWO NEW PLANETS IN MILKY WAY GALAXY

     WASHINGTON (JAN. 9) XINHUA - U.S. ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND
     EVIDENCE OF AT LEAST TWO AND POSSIBLY THREE PLANETS
     ORBITING A DENSE STAR IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY. THEY SAID,
     IF CONFIRMED, THE PLANETS WOULD BE THE FIRST KNOWN OUTSIDE
     THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

     SEVERAL PRIOR STUDIES HAD CLAIMED TO FIND SUCH PLANETS, BUT
     SOME OF THOSE STUDIES HAVE BEEN PROVED WRONG OR REMAIN
     UNCONFIRMED.

     THE NEWLY DISCOVERED SUPPOSED PLANETS ARE IN ORBIT NOT
     AROUND A 'NORMAL' STAR LIKE THE SUN BUT A DENSELY PACKED,
     DEAD STAR KNOWN AS A PULSAR. PULSARS LEND THEMSELVES TO
     MEASUREMENT BY EXISTING EARTH TECHNOLOGY, BUT ASTRONOMERS
     SAID THEY WILL NEED MORE CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE
     SIMILAR DISCOVERIES INVOLVING ORDINARY STARS.

     THE TWO PUTATIVE PLANETS, EACH ABOUT THREE TIMES THE MASS
     OF EARTH, ARE CIRCLING A NEWLY DISCOVERED PULSAR LOCATED
     ABOUT 1,300 LIGHT-YEARS FROM EARTH IN THE PLANE OF THE
     MILKY WAY. THE PLANET ON THE INSIDE TRACK APPEARS TO ORBIT
     THE PULSAR ONCE EVERY 66.6 DAYS. THE OTHER PLANET ON THE
     OUTSIDE TRACK APPEARS TO ORBIT THE PULSAR ONCE EVERY 98.2
     DAYS.

     RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF A THIRD PLANET
     THAT ORBITS  ABOUT ONCE A YEAR.

     SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUPPOSED PLANETS 'ARE NOT
     UNLIKE THOSE OF THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM,' ACCORDING TO THE
     DISCOVERERS. BOTH PLANETS ARE IN ORBITS ABOUT THE SAME
     DISTANCE FROM THEIR PULSAR AS MERCURY IF FROM THE SUN -- AT
     33.5 MILLION MILES AND 44 MILLION MILES OUT.

     THE NEW STUDY WAS PRESENTED BY ALEXANDER WOLSZCZAN, A
     SENIOR RESEARCHER WITH THE NATIONAL ASTRONOMY AND
     IONOSPHERE CENTER AT THE ARECIBO OBSERVATORY IN PUERTO

     SHUTTLE DISCOVERY CLEARED FOR JAN. 22 LAUNCH, SEVEN-DAY
     SPACELAB MISSION

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 9) UPI -  The shuttle Discovery
     and its six-man, one-woman crew were formally cleared
     Thursday for blastoff Jan. 22 on a seven-day Spacelab
     mission dedicated to medical research and materials
     science.

     Top NASA managers at the Kennedy Space Center breezed
     through a review of launch processing Thursday and with no
     problems of any significance under discussion, William
     Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space flight,
     officially cleared the spaceplane for liftoff at 8:53 a.m.
     EST on Jan. 22.

     At the controls will be commander Ronald Grabe, 46, and
     co-pilot Stephen Oswald, 40. Their crewmates are flight
     engineer William Readdy, 39, Norman Thagard, 48, David
     Hilmers, 41, German researcher Ulf Merbold, 50, and
     Canadian scientist Roberta Bondar, 46.

     Hilmers and Thagard are making their fourth shuttle flights
     while Grabe has two previous missions to his credit and
     Merbold one. Oswald, Readdy and Bondar
     the second Canadian to fly aboard a shuttle, are rookies.

     Nestled in Discovery's cargo bay is a European-built
     Spacelab module, a roomy laboratory connected to the
     shuttle's crew cabin by a pressurized tunnel. The $1
     billion lab is packed with racks of experiments that will
     be operated around the clock throughout the seven- day
     flight.
     OO 2-03                      Page 30                   8 Feb 1992


     Discovery's mission, the first of at least eight planned
     for 1992, marks the fifth flight of a Spacelab module,
     provided by the European Space Agency to permit shuttle
     crews to conduct sophisticated research in orbit.

     Merbold flew aboard the shuttle Columbia in 1983 as a West
     German when the Spacelab module made its maiden flight. He
     will be the first non-NASA space flier to make two shuttle
     flights.

     If all goes well, Merbold and his six crewmates will fly
     from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to the Florida
     spaceport Jan. 18. The countdown is scheduled to begin at 1
     p.m. the next day.

     The astronauts plan to work around the clock throughout the
     mission, staffing the orbiter in two 12-hour shifts. The
     night shift, called the ''red'' team, is made up of Readdy,
     Hilmers and Merbold, while the ''blue'' day shift is made
     up of Grabe, Oswald, Thagard and Bondar.

     By the time they arrive at the Kennedy Space Center for
     launch, the astronauts already will be adjusted to the
     split-shift sleep cycle. Nonetheless, the red team has the
     unenviable task fo trying to go to sleep a mere 4 1/2 hours
     after Discovery's adrenalin-producing takeoff.

     Assuming an on-time liftoff, the mission is scheduled to
     end Jan. 29 with a landing at 7:05 a.m. PST at Edwards Air
     Force Base, Calif.

     DISCOVERY OF NEW PLANET IN JULY WAS A MISTAKE, ENGLISH
     PROFESSOR ADMITS

     LONDON (JAN. 16) DPA - The first reported discovery of a
     planet outside the Earth's solar system was a mistake,
     Professor Andrew Lyne of Manchester University admitted in
     the latest issue of the British magazine Nature.

     Lyne's team of astronomers reached their erroneous
     conclusion last July after forgetting to include
     irregularities in the Earth's orbit in their calculations.

     The conclusions drawn from the radio impulses emmited by a
     neutron star that proved the existence of a planet ten
     times the size of Earth were fundamentally wrong, he said.

     Last week American astronomers reported the discovery of
     two planets outside the Earth's solar system.

     TRW-BUILT NASA'S COMPTON OBSERVATORY FINDS THREE NEW GAMMA
     RAY QUASARS

     ATLANTA (JAN. 14) BUSINESS WIRE - NASA's Compton Gamma Ray
     Observatory, built by TRW, has found three new gamma ray
     quasars that are approximately 10 to 20 million light years
     from Earth, a scientist reported during a news conference
     at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in
     Atlanta Tuesday.

     TRW Space & Technology Group of Redondo Beach, Calif.,
     built the 17-ton Compton Observatory and integrated its
     four scientific instruments under contract to NASA Goddard
     Space Flight Center.

     Dr. Carl Fichtel, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
     Greenbelt, Md., co-principal investigator for the Compton
     Observatory's Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope
     (EGRET) instrument told astronomers and reporters meeting
     in Atlanta that his instrument appears to have detected
     ''still more distant and very luminous gamma-ray sources,
     even more distant than the massive quasar 3C 279.''

     The EGRET team reported three sources of intense localized
     gamma radiation, quasars Q0208-512, 4C38.41 and
     PKS0528+134, detected between May 16, 1991, and Sept. 18,
     1991, located in the constellations of Eridanus, Hercules
     and near the Crab Nebula, approximately 10 to 20 billion
     light years from Earth.

     In addition to the quasar observations, EGRET scientists
     released an image Tuesday of the June 11, 1991 solar flare
     made by the telescope.

     Dr. Gerald Fishman, principal investigator for the Burst
     and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) reports that his
     team has detected more than 200 cosmic gamma-ray bursts
     since Compton's launch last April.  BATSE is designed to
     study the mysterious phenomenon of gamma-ray bursts.

     BATSE scientists announced last September indications of an
     apparant random distribution of the bursts in the sky.
     More recent observations by the BATSE team have further
     confirmed the earlier observation with almost twice as many
     bursts as the original report.

     The Compton Observatory is the second of NASA's ''Great
     Observatories.''  The first was the Hubble Space Telescope,
     launched in April 1990.  The other is the Advanced X-ray
     Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), expected to launch in 1998.

     Deployed April 7, 1991 from the Space Shuttle Atlantis,
     Compton Observatory currently orbits Earth at an altitude
     of 268 x 252 statue miles (432 x 422 kilometers).

     HUBBLE TELESCOPE TAKES DRAMATIC PICTURE OF TITANIC BLACK
     HOLE, SCIENTISTS SAY

     (JAN. 16) UPI - The Hubble Space Telescope has taken a
     dramatic picture of what astronomers said Thursday appears
     to be evidence of a titanic black hole pulling in stars and
     spewing out torrents of radiation and hot gas in the heart
     of a distant galaxy.

     If spectroscopic data later confirms theoretical
     predictions, astronomers finally may be able to confirm the
     OO 2-03                      Page 33                   8 Feb 1992


     existence of black holes, the bizarre remnants of super
     massive stars with gravity so intense not even light can
     escape.

     The Hubble photograph clearly shows a pronounced
     condensation of stars and a brilliant point-like source of
     light at the very center of a galaxy known as M-87, 52
     million light years from Earth. A light year is the
     distance light, traveling 186,000 miles per second, covers
     in one year.

     The picture almost exactly matches theoretical predictions
     of what one could expect if a black hole with 2.6 billion
     times the mass of the sun lurked at the center of the
     galaxy.

     While the black hole itself would be invisible, radiation
     produced as dust and debris were sucked inward would result
     in a brilliant beacon like that seen in the picture.

     The color photograph from NASA's $1.5 billion Hubble Space
     Telescope ''is the highest resolution image ever taken of
     this galaxy,'' said Tod Lauer, one of the astronomers who
     made the discovery.

     ''The thing we find is that the stars are packed very, very
     densely in the center of this galaxy,'' he said in an
     interview. ''Those are all sharply concentrated toward the
     center and the question is, what does this kind of thing?
     And a massive black hole would do that.''

     The photograph, and another taken in ultraviolet light,
     were released Thursday at a meeting of the American
     Astronomical Society in Atlanta.

     Black holes are thought to be the end result of a
     particularly violent line of stellar evolution.

     When stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, they can no longer
     produce the outward energy needed to offset the inward pull
     of gravity. If a star is massive enough, it can suddenly
     collapse on itself and explode in what is known as
     supernovae.

     Depending on the original mass, the collapsing core can
     become a neutron star, that is, a star in which
     gravitational collapse has crushed atomic particles
     together with such force that only uncharged neutrons
     survive in an ultra-dense sphere as small as 10 to 12 miles
     across. A spinning neutron star is called a pulsar.

     But current theories hold that if the mass of the doomed
     sun is great enough to begin with, gravitational collapse
     can proceed beyond the neutron star stage, producing a
     ''black hole'' with such intense gravity not even light can
     escape.
     OO 2-03                      Page 34                   8 Feb 1992


     Because of its titanic gravity, a black hole would suck in
     dust and debris, creating an ''accretion disk'' of material
     around it. As that material is accelerated toward the black
     hole and subjected to the effects of powerful magnetic
     fields, it can give off torrents of radiation.

     A super massive black hole at the center of a galaxy also
     would be expected to pull stars into a tightly concentrated
     core and to give off intense radiation. And that is
     precisely what the Hubble Space Telescope picture appears
     to show at the heart of M-87.

     ''I would call it tantalizing,'' Lauer said. ''I was really
     excited to get this because it looked just like the
     predictions, it looked dead on like the predictions.''

     M-87, a galaxy in the constellation Virgo containing more
     than 100 billion stars, has long fascinated astronomers
     because it has a tremendous jet of hot gas extending away
     from the core into space. Lauer said the jet likely is made
     up of gas particles that were accelerated toward the black
     hole and then shot outward due to electrical and magnetic
     effects.

     So just what does the Hubble picture show to the trained
     eye?

     ''You're looking right down the throat of this swirling
     accretion disk, that is, there's gas swirling around that's
     falling into the black hole,'' Lauer said.

     More important, however, is the appearance of the stars at
     the core of M-87.

     ''If you put a lot of mass at the center (of the galaxy),
     it's going to cause it to collapse,'' Lauer said. ''Picture
     putting a magnet near iron filings, it all kind of clumps
     inward. And so the whole center of the galaxy is drawn
     in.''

     Instead of looking at what appears to be light from an
     accretion disk, ''Look at the stars and see how they just
     go from black and it just gets brighter and brighter right
     before the sharp bright thing,'' he said. ''That's what
     theory says a black hole does.''

     Final proof could come later this year based on
     spectroscopic data from Hubble that should allow
     astronomers to measure the velocities of the M-87 core
     stars. If the velocities match what theory predicts,
     scientists will finally have hard evidence of the existence
     of black holes.

     PARAMOUNT PICTURES TO LAUNCH NEW "STAR TREK" TV SERIES

     LOS ANGELES (JAN. 20) UPI - Paramount Pictures announced
     Monday it will launch ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''
     television series early next year, a ''Wild West''-style
     version of the durable ''Star Trek'' series.

     ''If, as (the late) Gene Roddenberry often said, 'Star
     Trek' is 'Wagon Train' in space, then 'Deep Space Nine' can
     be compared to a wild west town on the edge of the frontier
     with all the excitement and adventure that kind of locale
     can generate,'' said Michael Piller, who is co-executive
     producer on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the new
     show.

     ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' will revolve around a new
     cast of Starfleet officers who take command of a remote
     alien space station near a strategically located
     ''wormhole,'' or a shortcut through space.

     Paramount said ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' will begin
     airing next January with a two-hour premiere movie,
     followed by 19 one-hour episodes. Shooting will begin in
     June at Paramount's soundstages in Hollywood.

     As a result, the new series will air concurrently with
     OO 2-03                      Page 39                   8 Feb 1992


     Paramount's ''Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' currently
     in its fifth year and consistently in the top three of
     syndicated television shows. Both series are set in the
     24th century.

     ''Setting 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' during the same time
     as 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' will allow an exchange
     of characters and occasional story lines between each
     show,'' said Rick Berman, Piller's co-executive producer.

     ''Star Trek,'' created by Roddenberry, first aired on
     network television in 1966 and lasted three seasons before
     it was canceled by NBC because of low ratings.

     But the original series attracted a core of loyal fans and
     became a hit in re-runs of its 78 episodes. Not only is the
     original series still being seen on reruns, it has also
     spawned six movies featuring the original cast that have
     grossed nearly half a billion dollars for Paramount.

     ''Star Trek: the Next Generation'' has one year left on its
     contract after it completes the current season. Speculation
     has arisen the characters from that show may then do a
     seventh ''Star Trek'' movie because the stars of the
     previous movies have indicated that the sixth movie -
     ''Star Trek: the Undiscovered Country'' would be their
     last.

     Paramount also announced Monday it would launch an
     18-episode version next year of ''The Untouchables,'' a
     popular TV show in the late 1950s and early 1960s. ''The
     Untouchables'' also became a hit movie in 1987, with Kevin
     Costner, Robert De Niro and Sean Connery, who won the
     Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

     Kerry McCluggage, president of the Paramount Television
     Group, told a news conference the two properties are
     Paramount's ''crown jewels.'' The studio is planning 26
     episodes of both shows for the fall 1993 season.

     '''The Untouchables' is one of the best crime-fighting
     franchises that exists, while Star Trek redefined the
     science fiction genre and is arguably the most visionary
     space drama ever conceived,'' McCluggage said.

     Paramount said XETV in San Diego, KCPO in Seattle and the
     Paramount's stations have committed to carrying one or both
     of the new series. It said the it expects to announce a
     significant number of deals shortly and predicted that it
     would have a high percentage of the nation ''cleared'' for
     both shows.

     ''The Untouchables'' will be set in Chicago in the 1930s
     and its executive producer will be Christopher Crowe, who
     developed and produced ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' for
     NBC.

     U.S. SPACE SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS GEAR UP FOR FULL SLATE OF
     EXPERIMENTS

     CAPE CANAVERAL FL (JAN. 23) UPI - The shuttle Discovery's
     crew, working around the clock in 12-hour shifts, plowed
     through a full slate of experiments Thursday, taking turns
     in a rotating chair to study how weightlessness triggers
     motion sickness.

     While his crewmates carried out research in a $1 billion
     Spacelab module mounted in Discovery's cargo bay, shuttle
     co-pilot Stephen Oswald attempted to use a large-format
     IMAX camera to photograph parts of Africa and Europe,
     including shots of Moscow and other points of interest, for
     a movie to be called ''Destiny in Space.''

     Cloudy weather and other activities on the orbiter combined
     for mixed results.

     ''Pass on our regrets to the IMAX folks but we weren't able
     to get either the England or the Denmark shots for them,
     I'm afraid,'' Oswald radioed at one point.

     With Discovery sailing through space in tip-top condition,
     other activities Thursday included work with a series of
     materials-processing experiments and medical research to
     study the effects of weightlessness on humans, plants,
     insects and other biological specimens.

     Astronaut David Hilmers and German physicist Ulf Merbold
     began work Thursday with an experiment that calls for crew
     members to be spun in a specially designed computer-driven
     chair while looking at an imaginary object in the distance.
     The tests are designed to help develop means of countering
     motion sickness on future space flights.

     Later in the day, the astronauts planned to take turns
     riding a sled on rails down the center aisle of the
     Spacelab module as part of a test to investigate how the
     body interprets messages from the inner ear organs that
     control balance.

     The seven astronauts during Discovery's seven-day mission
     plan to perform more than 50 experiments developed by some
     200 scientists from six space agencies representing 14
     nations.

     Because so much is contained in the flight plan, the crew
     is working around the clock. Commander Ronald Grabe, 46,
     Oswald, 40, Norman Thagard, 48, and Canadian neurobiologist
     Roberta Bondar, 46, are on the day or ''blue'' shift as
     Discovery orbits between 186 and 184 miles above the Earth.
     OO 2-03                      Page 41                   8 Feb 1992


     William Readdy, 39, Hilmers, 41, and Merbold, 50, comprise
     the night shift, or ''red'' team. One team works while the
     other sleeps in small crew cabin cubicles.

     As the blue team finished its tasks Wednesday night,
     controllers on the ground expressed satisfaction for how
     smoothly the day had gone.

     ''Thanks a lot, you all have really done an outstanding job
     for us and have a good sleep and we'll talk to you
     tomorrow,'' Roger Crouch at the Marshall Space Flight
     Center in Huntsville, Ala., radioed to Bondar. The center
     is overseeing experiments carried in Spacelab.

     ''Sounds good, Roger, thanks a lot,'' she replied, as
     Thagard added, ''Is that the Roger the Dodger on Com?''

     ''The R.D.,'' Crouch replied.

     ''Well, Roger, if you come down the Spacelab tunnel
     sideways, it looks like an entirely different place,''
     Thagard radioed back.

     ''Well you guys sure do put on a spectacular show, so it
     ought to look like a different place from time to time,''
     Crouch replied.

     ''If you can believe it, they actually pay us to do that
     stuff,'' Thagard said.

     ''Copy that,'' Crouch replied.

     Activation of the $1 billion European-built laboratory
     proceeded nearly flawlessly.

     A major objective of the medical research in the
     International Microgravity Laboratory in the Spacelab
     module is to try to help scientists learn what causes space
     sickness, a debilitating nausea that affects about half the
     men and women who fly in space.

     Payload manager Harry Craft, who is overseeing the research
     from the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
     said Wednesday another goal is to see how radiation affects
     cells in certain organisms as a way of helping improve
     space travel.

     ''We're looking at the radiation effects of living in a
     space environment like that - all of this focused toward
     being able to take this information and apply it to the
     Space Station Freedom activities where man will be living
     in space for long durations,'' he said. ''And then we'll
     take it even a step further then and look at interplanetary
     flight.''

     Biological specimens in the 23-foot-long Spacelab, which is
     OO 2-03                      Page 42                   8 Feb 1992


     mounted in the shuttle's open cargo bay, include fruit
     flies, frog eggs, roundworms, slime mold, brewer's yeast,
     bacteria spores and lentil seedlings.

     The seven-day mission also is designed to test how crystals
     useful in electronics and infrared detection might be
     produced in space to avoid impurities and other problems
     caused by Earth's gravity.

     Discovery thundered into orbit Wednesday. The ship is to
     land next Wednesday at Edwards Air Force Base in
     California's high desert.

     SHUTTLE DISCOVERY CREW BUSY WITH FULL SLATE OF MEDICAL
     EXPERIMENTS

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 23) UPI -  The Discovery
     astronauts rode a slow- motion space sled, took turns in a
     rotating chair and plowed through a full slate of other
     medical experiments Thursday to learn more about what
     causes unpleasant bouts of ''space sickness.''

     At least one member of Discovery's six-man, one-woman crew
     may have experienced the very ailment the astronauts have
     been studying since their ground-shaking liftoff Wednesday.

     Early Thursday, commander Ronald Grabe radioed mission
     control and asked for an unscheduled ''private medical
     conference,'' or PMC. All shuttle missions feature
     regularly scheduled, blacked-out medical conferences to
     give the astronauts a chance to discuss health issues in
     private.

     ''We have some follow-up information relative to the
     discussion we had with (flight surgeon) Larry Pepper
     (Wednesday),'' Grabe radioed.

     ''The surgeon's listening, Ron, go ahead,'' replied
     astronaut James Halsell from the Johnson Space Center in
     Houston.

     ''OK, I'll need you to set up (blacked-out) comm for
     that,'' Grabe said, referring to a private communications
     channel.

     Halsell responded: ''Understand you want a PMC. We'll set
     that up for you and let you know when we're ready.''

     About half the men and women who fly in space suffer
     nausea, vomiting and other symptoms as their bodies adapt
     to weightlessness and Discovery's crew is carrying out a
     battery of experiments to learn more about the causes of
     OO 2-03                      Page 43                   8 Feb 1992


     the illness.

     The astronauts showed no obvious signs of sickness in video
     beamed down to Earth Wednesday and Thursday. NASA will not
     discuss crew health issues unless they threaten the success
     of a mission and in this case, that did not appear to be
     the case.

     Joining Grabe, 46, aboard Discovery are co-pilot Stephen
     Oswald, 40, Norman Thagard, 48, William Readdy, 39, David
     Hilmers, 41, Canadian neurobiologist Roberta Bondar, 46,
     and German physicist Ulf Merbold, 50.

     Encountering remarkably few problems, the astronauts are
     working in two 12-hour shifts to gather as much data as
     possible during their seven-day flight. Grabe, Oswald,
     Thagard and Bondar are working by day and sleeping by night
     while Hilmers, Readdy and Merbold are pulling an overnight
     shift.

     Thagard, Hilmers, Bondar and Merbold are responsible for
     the bulk of the experiments packed into a $1 billion
     Spacelab module carried in Discovery's cargo hold. The
     23-foot-long module is connected to the shuttle's crew
     cabin by a 19-foot-long tunnel.

     The goal of the International Microgravity Laboratory - IML
     - research is to study the effects of weightlessness on
     people, plants, insects and a variety of industrial
     materials.

     The Spacelab astronauts took turns Thursday strapping into
     a space sled mounted in the center of the laboratory module
     to study how the balance and orientation mechanisms of the
     inner ear respond to changing accelerations. In another
     experiment, they strapped into a rotating chair to study

     SHUTTLE DISCOVERY CREW LEARNING MORE ABOUT WEIGHTLESSNESS,
     "SPACE SICKNESS"

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 23) UPI -  The Discovery
     astronauts took turns riding a space sled, spun in a
     rotating chair and endured mild shocks Thursday to learn
     more about how weightlessness can trigger unpleasant bouts
     of ''space sickness.''

     At least one member of Discovery's six-man, one-woman crew
     apparently experienced the very ailment the astronauts have
     been studying since their ground-shaking liftoff Wednesday.

     Early Thursday, commander Ronald Grabe radioed mission
     control and asked for an unscheduled ''private medical
     conference,'' or PMC. All shuttle missions feature
     regularly scheduled, blacked-out medical conferences to
     give the astronauts a chance to discuss health issues in
     private.

     ''The surgeon's listening, Ron, go ahead,'' astronaut James
     Halsell radioed from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

     ''OK, I'll need you to set up (blacked-out) comm for
     that,'' Grabe said, referring to a private communications
     channel.

     Halsell responded: ''Understand you want a PMC. We'll set
     that up for you.''

     More than half the men and women who fly in space suffer
     nausea, vomiting and other symptoms as their bodies adapt
     to weightlessness and Discovery's crew is carrying out a
     battery of experiments to learn more about the causes of
     the illness.

     NASA officials will not discuss crew health issues unless
     they threaten the success of a mission and flight director
     Wayne Hale said no such threat existed.

     ''The flight surgeons have told us there are no mission
     impacts from any of those conferences,'' he said.
     ''Something like two thirds of all the people who go into
     space the first time have symptoms of space motion sickness
     (and) typically they pass within the first two or three
     days.''

     Joining Grabe, 46, aboard Discovery are co-pilot Stephen
     Oswald, 40, Norman Thagard, 48, William Readdy, 39, David
     OO 2-03                      Page 45                   8 Feb 1992


     Hilmers, 41, Canadian neurobiologist Roberta Bondar, 46,
     and German physicist Ulf Merbold, 50.

     Back on Earth, scientists said they were thrilled with the
     early success of the 45th shuttle mission.

     ''The crew is doing a marvelous job and the scientists are
     quite enthused about it,'' said mission scientist Robert
     Snyder.

     The astronauts are working in two 12-hour shifts to gather
     as much data as possible during their seven-day flight.
     Grabe, Oswald, Thagard and Bondar are working by day and
     sleeping by night while Hilmers, Readdy and Merbold are
     pulling an overnight shift.

     Thagard, Hilmers, Bondar and Merbold are responsible for
     the bulk of the experiments packed into a $1 billion
     Spacelab module carried in Discovery's cargo hold. The
     23-foot-long module is connected to the shuttle's crew
     cabin by a 19-foot-long tunnel.

     The goal of the International Microgravity Laboratory, or
     IML, research is to study the effects of weightlessness on
     people, plants, insects and a variety of industrial
     materials.

     The Spacelab astronauts took turns Thursday strapping into
     a space sled mounted in the center of the laboratory module
     to study how the balance and orientation mechanisms of the
     inner ear respond to changing accelerations.

     Using ear plugs and wearing a blindfold to eliminate visual
     and sound cues, the test subjects glided back and forth
     along two 40-inch-long rails. Electrodes attached to the
     back of each subject's knee applied very mild shocks. The
     response, measured by other electrodes, provides an
     indication of how the gravity sensors in the inner ear
     respond to different accelerations.

     In another experiment, the crew members strapped into a
     rotating chair to study how the inner ears and eyes work in
     space to determine body position. The chair malfunctioned
     at one point, causing a circuit breaker to pop open, but
     scientists were confident the crew could correct the
     problem.

     The research could help scientists determine what causes
     disorientation and other physiological changes during the
     onset of weightlessness that are thought to contribute to
     space sickness.

     Hilmers and Merbold also started an experiment to study how

     DISCOVERY CREW MEMBERS BUSY WITH SPACE RESEARCH, PLAN TO
     CHAT WITH PRES. BUSH

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (JAN. 24) UPI - The Discovery astronauts
     grew ultra-pure space crystals Friday that could lead to
     improved telescopes and spy satellites, turned to vise
     grips to flush the shuttle's high-tech toilet and cleared
     the decks for an afternoon chat with President Bush.

     The president, scheduled to call the crew from Washington,
     OO 2-03                      Page 48                   8 Feb 1992


     ''is very interested in your mission,'' flight controllers
     said in a morning message to the astronauts. ''For the
     benefit of your audience, please introduce each crew
     member. Also, comb your hair and smile.''

     Working around the clock, Discovery's six-man, one-woman
     crew sailed into their third day in orbit Friday, studying
     how the absence of gravity affects humans, plants, insects
     and exotic materials with a variety of industrial
     applications.

     On board are commander Ronald Grabe, 46; co-pilot Stephen
     Oswald, 40; Norman Thagard, 48; David Hilmers, 41; Canadian
     neurologist Roberta Bondar, 46; German physicist Ulf
     Merbold, 50; and William Readdy, who celebrated his 40th
     birthday Friday by spotting the Russian space station Mir
     as it zoomed past a scant 45 miles away.

     ''The sun glint off of the Mir is almost like somebody put
     a strobe light on an airplane. It's about the size of
     Mercury when you can see that when the sun goes down,''
     Readdy said.

     To gather as much science data as possible, the astronauts
     are working in two 12-hour shifts. Grabe, Oswald, Thagard
     and Bondar are working the day shift while Hilmers, Readdy
     and Merbold are pulling an overnight shift.

     In keeping with the international flavor of the 45th
     shuttle mission, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Canadian
     Prime Minister Brian Mulroney plan to call the astronauts
     Monday and Tuesday.

     The goal of the year's first shuttle mission is to learn
     more counteract - the effects of weightlessness. But Friday
     afternoon, Grabe and Oswald were forced to focus on a more
     mundane task: fixing the flusher of their zero-gravity
     space toilet.

     ''The mode control lever will pull up, but it feels like
     there's no linkage attached to it and it will not slide
     forward,'' Grabe radioed mission control in Houston.

     ''OK, Ron, we copy that. We're looking at an IFM (in-flight
     maintenance procedure) that may allow us to control the
     linkage from underneath,'' said Peter Wisoff at the Johnson
     Space Center. ''We'll get words to you.''

     ''OK, we anxiously await,'' Grabe replied.

     After the repair procedure was faxed up to Discovery,
     Oswald reported he had no luck, saying ''we're back to
     where we were and I see that you want us to just operate
     that control linkage with the vise grips'' when flushing is
     required.

     ''Affirmative,'' Wisoff required. Meanwhile, the science
     continued.

     Thagard, Hilmers, Bondar and Merbold are responsible for
     the bulk of the experiments packed into a $1 billion
     Spacelab module carried in Discovery's cargo hold. The
     23-foot-long module is connected to the shuttle's crew
     cabin by a 19-foot-long tunnel.

     The goal of the International Microgravity Laboratory, or
     IML, research is to study the effects of weightlessness on
     people, plants, fruit flies, other biological subjects and
     a variety of industrial materials.

     Early Friday, the astronauts concentrated on materials
     science research, activating one experiment to grow
     triglycine sulfate crystals and another to grow crystals of
     mercury iodide. The latter experiment did not work as
     expected, prompting the astronauts to make changes in their
     procedure to eliminate small growths on the face of the
     main crystal.

     Mercury iodide crystals can be used to detect high energy
     X-rays and gamma rays while triglycine sulfate crystals can
     detect low-energy infrared radiation. What makes these
     materials so potentially useful is they can do so at room
     temperatures.

     Current infrared detectors, for example, must be chilled to
     extremely low temperatures to be effective, which adds to
     the cost and complexity of such systems.

     On Earth, gravitational effects prevent scientists from
     growing room temperature detector crystals large enough to
     be useful. But in space, those effects are absent.

     If scientists can learn to grow ultra-pure crystals of
     mercury iodide and triglycine sulfate, engineers may be
     able to build cheaper, more efficient detectors for use in
     spy satellites, space telescopes, hand- held detectors for
     monitoring nuclear plants and medical diagnostic devices.

     PRES. BUSH TALKS WITH SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS, CALLS FOR
     INCREASED SPACE FUNDING

     WASHINGTON (JAN. 24) UPI - President Bush chatted Friday
     with America's astronauts - past, present and possibly
     future - and announced he wants to increase the nation's
     quest for space exploration.

     Bush said he will soon propose establishment of a new
     office of space exploration, which will be led by NASA and
     OO 2-03                      Page 50                   8 Feb 1992


     include input from the Defense and Energy Departments and
     other federal agencies.

     The president also said that when he submits his fiscal
     1993 budget to Congress next week, it will mark for the
     third straight year, ''a real increase in spending in our
     civil space program.''

     ''This includes full funding for Space Station Freedom,
     $2.25 billion, an increase of 11 percent,'' Bush said told
     a White House gathering that included 20 former astronauts
     and members of the Young Astronauts Council, a youth group.

     Afterward, Bush and some of the young would-be astronauts,
     via a telephone hookup, talked with astronauts aboard
     Discovery as the spaceship circled the Earth.

     The president, in unveiling his budget plans, said, ''More
     than 23 percent of NASA's programs will increase by 10
     percent over the current year.''

     ''The budget will include a dramatic expansion of two
     exciting programs - $250 million to triple funding for our
     new launch system to develop a new family of rockets for
     the 21st century, and $80 million for the National
     Aerospace Plane
     which may one day enable direct flights from Earth to
     orbit,'' he said.

     Bush said, ''I'm asking Americans to make a farsighted
     commitment, one that looks dozens of years and millions of
     miles beyond the recession and other things that tend to
     occupy us today.''
