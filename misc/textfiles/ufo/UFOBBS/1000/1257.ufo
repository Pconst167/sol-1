THOSE STRANGE LIGHTS WERE...

By Julie Warner
Quill Staff Writer

     If  you  were  one of the several area residents  who  spied
unidentified bright yellow lights hovering in the sky at night in
the past couple of weeks, the Missouri Air National Guard has the
answer to what you saw.
     Last Tuesday evening about a dozen West  Plains,  Mtn.  View
and  Peace  Valley residents reported sightings of bright  yellow
lights in the night sky.   Some witnesses said the lights were in
a straight line and others saw them in formations.  The number of
lights  varied from two to as many as eight.   The witnesses  all
said  the  lights didn't seem connected to any objects  and  that
they would flash on and off,  sometimes all at once or a few at a
time, and then would just disappear.
     Howell  County Sheriff Hubert Holman told the Quill today  a
report  came  into his office Tuesday evening that bright  orange
lights  were  spotted  above Fair View  Elementary  School  on  K
Highway.  A deputy was dispatched to the area, but the lights had
disappeared, Holman said.
     Among some of the witnesses who spotted these lights Tuesday
were a West Plains Policeman and Mtn. View Policemen Ron Pruett.
     According  to Capt.  Ken MacNevin,  a public affairs officer
for the Missouri Air National Guard in Jefferson City, the lights
were probably not UFOs but glows from maneuvers being  undertaken
by  members  of the 131st tactical flight wing flying out of  St.
Louis and practicing weapon-deceiving techniques.
     MacNevin   explained  that  one  of  the  standard   defense
techniques   used  by  the  military  in  avoiding  or  deceiving
missiles,  some  of which are heat-seeking,  is to spit  out  hot
flares.  He said that if a heat-seeking missile was to be shot at
one of the U.S.  fighter jets,  the pilot would shoot off one  of
these flares and the missile should be deceived and veer  towards
the flare instead of the jet.
     In  recent weeks this unit acquired some of these flares and
has  been practicing some of these flight maneuvers with  Phantom
F-4  fighter  jets  in  what  is  called  the  Meramec   Military
Operations Region,  which covers a large portion of south central
Missouri.
     MacNevin  said the practice maneuvers have been taking place
on Tuesdays and some Wednesday evenings from 5:30 to 8,  and they
will continue for the next several weeks.
     He  said  that  sightings  outside of this  time  frame  can
probably  also be attributed to  military  operations.   MacNevin
said  that  this air space is dedicated to all and  any  military
units  in  the  United  States,   and  units  from  Missouri  and
surrounding  states have probably all used this area for practice
maneuvers at some point in time.
