                  'MAGIC' CIRCLE

HAVE ALIENS landed at Lewes?  Or are these crop circles on farmland to the west of the town an elaborate hoax?
     Local photographer Tom Fenn spotted the three perfect circles on Sunday while taking aerial pictures on a business assignment.
     He later visited the strange circles on the ground, saying:  "They are quite beautiful and fantastic," he said.
     "Strangely my brother stumbled on one at the same place last year.  I'd like to think that UFOs made them but, as a sceptic, I think the wind is responsible."
     The three rings are toughly the some size, about 20 feet wide.  Two are liked by a path, and the third has a thin outer ring.
      The wheat is firmly pressed down in a clockwise direction, but there is no obvious evidence of how it was done.
     Crop circles appear nearly every year in Wiltshire but are rare in Sussex.  Several years ago crop circles near Alfriston were visited by thousands of tourists.
     These are thought to be the first to be spotted since then.
     Farmer Martin Brickell, from Southease, was unaware of the circles when the Express contacted him.  He said he was keeping an open mind on how they got there.
     Mrs. Barbara Withcombe, who lives near the Lewes circles, said:  'We haven't seen any flying saucers.  I think foxes or badgers did them.'
     National Farmers Union technical adviser William White said the NFU had no official view about them but he was sure they were not the work of humans as they had been sighted all over the world.
     "I personally think they have been made by energy fields-charges of electrical energy manifested in the ripening wheat," he ventured.
     "We would all love to know the answers: then the whole issue could be allowed to settle."
     East Sussex countryside management officer Paul Millmore said:  "They amaze me, but I don't pretend to understand them."
     However crop circle expert Pat Delgado was quite sure of his position when the Express contacted him in Wiltshire where an elaborate crop circle i gaining national publicity.
     After we described the three circles he said:  "Every logical possibility has been thoroughly examined and has led us nowhere.
     "We are daling with things we don't understand...I believe the circles are controlled by a higher invisible intelligence."
