  ADVERTISER, HEYWOOD, ENGLAND-Nov. 16, 1989

MYSTERY lights have once again been spotted in the skies over Heywood.

     A huge,glowing white ball was seen over the Darnhill area by Mrs. Janet
Nicholson of Trent Avenue, Summit, who told the Advertiser about her strange
experience. She said: "I was driving down Cherwell Avenue on Sunday with my
husband when I noticed a big white light over Darnhill way.

     "It didn't move or change shape, but it was far too large and bright to be
a star.  "When I got home the light was still there, and so I drove as close to
it as I could, ending up near the flats at Darnhill.

     "I watched it for 10 minutes and then went to get my children, who were as
mystified as I was.  "About half an hour after I first saw it, the light started
to move towards us.

     "As it got closer it became clear that it was triangular in shape and
consisted of what appeared to be two white lights and a red one.  It then moved
above us and went over and out of sight.
     "I've never seen anything like it before.  I know the difference between a
plane and something unexplained.  "It was an incredible experience, and I'm sure
other people in Heywood must have seen something."

     The Advertiser put Mrs. Nicholson in contact with a Heywood UFO research
group.  A spokesman from the group said: "Mrs.  Nicholson's sighting is still
under investigation.  We haven't come to any definite conclusions as yet, but we
are especially interested in the description of the triangular shape."
