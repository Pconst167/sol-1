WYTHEVILLE UFO UPDATE --

HUGE UFOS EQUIPPED WITH STROBES CONTINUE TO FLY OVER WYTHE
COUNTY, VIRGINIA, WHERE MORE THAN 1,000 SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN
REPORTED SINCE THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER, ACCORDING TO BROAD-
CAST NEWS DIRECTOR DANNY GORDON OF WYVE RADIO IN WYTHEVILLE.
ALTHOUGH BOTH THE PENTAGON AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HAVE
REPEATEDLY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OR INVOLVMENT IN THE RAFT OF
UFOS, GORDON, WITH TWO OTHER RESEARCHERS, SUSPECTS A MILI-
TARY EXPLANATION MAY BE FORTHCOMING.  "WE THINK IT MAY
BE A MILITARY CRAFT OF A HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL NATURE," GORDON
SPECULATES, "OR SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S
NOT THEIRS!  (WYTHE COUNTY) IS A TESTING AREA FOR DAYTIME 
FLIGHTS BY THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE."
SENATOR PAUL TRIBLE (R-VIRGINIA) IS OFFICIALLY CONTACTING THE
MILITARY REGARDING THE UFOS, ACCORDING TO HIS WASHINGTON,
D.C. PRESS SECRETARY JOHN MILLER.  SUBSEQUENT ACTION
WILL DEPEND ON THE MILITARY'S RESPONSE MILLER SAYS.
REPORTS HAVE DEPICTED V-SHAPED CRAFT, ROUND AND DOME-TOPPED
OBJECTS AND FAST-MOVING COLORED LIGHTS.  WITNESSES HAVE DES-
CRIBED SEEING THE CRAFT MANAGE 90-DEGREE TURNS AND SPEEDS
FASTER THAN KNOWN AIRCRAFT, ALONG WITH INCIDENTS OF THE 
UFOS DOGGING AUTOMOBILES.  ONE WITNESS CLAIMS HE SAW SOMETHING
ON NOV 2 WHICH RESEMBLED A SHIP FROM STAR WARS.
DAYTIME MILITARY ACTIVITY PROVES INCONCLUSIVE AS A POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION.  THE SILENT UFOS ARE MOST OFTEN SEEN AFTER DARK,
AND AT ALTITUDES APPARENTLY INCONSISTENT WITH POSSIBLE TEST
FLIGHTS OR REFUELING OPERATIONS.
GORDON FIRST BROKE THE NEWS TO WIRE SERVICES AFTER LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS REPORTED UFOS ON OCT. 2, SEEN IN THE 
NORTHERN SECTION OF THE COUNTY OVER INTERSTATE 77.  "LESS
THAN A WEEK LATER, THE SHERIFF'S DEPATMENT REPORTED THAT A 
FAMILY VISITING FROM OHIO - WHO WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY UFO
SIGHTINGS BEFOREHAND - HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A ROUND OBJECT,"
SAYS GORDON.  
"IT CAME AT THEM AT A LOW ALTITUDE WHILE THEY WERE ON A
SECONDARY TWO-LANE ROAD."
REPORTS OF SIMILAR OBJECTS - DOME-SHAPED CRAFT OUTFITTED
WITH BRIGHT LIGHTS AND OFTEN FOLLOWED BY A SMALLER, RED-
LIGHTED OBJECTS, POURED INTO GORDON AT WYVE.  AS INTEREST
IN THE SIGHTINGS MOUNTED, HE DECIDED TO HOST A CALL-IN
PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE COULD ANONYMOUSLY REPORT WHAT THEY
HAD SEEN IN THE AREA.  "I HAD ABOUT 25 CALLS IN THE FIRST
HOUR," HE SAYS.
MILITARY MANEUVERS IN THE WYTHE COUNTY AREA ARE NOT UNCOMMON.
GORDON, WHO'S HAD ONE DAYLIGHT AND FOUR NOCTURNAL SIGHTINGS
HIMSELF, IS CONDUCTING AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO
THE WYTHE COUNTY UFOS.  WITH FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER JOHN
STEMBER AND MILITARY DECEPTION SPECIALIST ANDREW CONVERY, WHO
BOTH OFFERED THEIR ASSISTANCE AS NEWS OF THE "FLAP" WENT
NATIONAL, GORDON MADE SEVERAL VISITS TO LOCAL SIGHTING
VICINITIES.  THEY OBSEVED A LARGER UFO ("HUMUNGOUS CRAFT
ABOUT 900 FEET LONG - BIGGER THAN A 747") LINKING WITH A
SMALLER CRAFT IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DOCKING MANUEVER.
SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND POOR-QUALITY VIDEOTAPE WERE
TAKEN.
OFFICIALS AT THE TENNESSEE AIR NATIONAL GUARD, WHO SPOKE WITH
GORDON SHORTLY AFTER SOME OF THE FIRST SIGHTINGS, SUGGESTED
THAT THE UFOS WERE CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT CONDUCTING REFUELING
OPERATIONS.  THE PENTAGON DENIES THAT, GORDON SAYS.  "PEOPLE
LOCALLY ARE MAD - THEY'RE LIKE ME; THEY'VE SEEN SOMETHING AND
THEY KNOW IT WASN'T REFUELING."  
ON OCT. 23, GORDON ANDHIS COLLEAGUES HELD A PRESS CON-
FERENCE AT WYVE STUDIOS IN WYTHEVILLE.  THE PANEL DES-
CLARED THEIR BELIEF THAT SOME SORT OF CRASH TOOK PLACE IN 
THE AREA - BUT DECLINED TO ELABORATE.
a REPORTER RECENTLY QUESTIONED GORDON ON THE UFOS FEASIBLY
BEING EXTRATERRESTRIAL.  "BECAUSE I'M A REPORTER, i 
HAVE TO DEAL IN FACTS AND LOGIC," GORDON RESPONDED.
"THERE'S NO PROOF THAT THE UFOS COME FROM ANYWHERE BUT THE
UNITED STATES.  IF SO, THEY'RE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF 
SNEAKING IN AND OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.  AND IF IT'S A STEALTH
EXPERIMENT, IT'S A ROUND ONE.
