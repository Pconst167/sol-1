FORGET MEN ON THE MOON.  HERE'S

NEW PROOF OF LIFE ON MARS

As these exclusive NASA photos show, the 'men on Mars' myth now takes on a startling new signficance with the discovery of two new 'faces' on the red planet

     Was there life on Mars?  Scientists haven't stopped arguing about the red planet's unique features since American space missions photographed them in 1972 and 1976.
     Recently the debate has heightened with the confirmed discovery of two more "faces" on Mars, in addition to a visage-like structure spotted on one of those missions.
     Some scientists claim these "faces" are actual monuments from a lost civilsation, while others maintain they are merely random geographical patterns.
     But there is one thing they agree on-the space missions' shots revealed several highly unusual rock designs on Mars.
     They include a configuration of huge "pyramids" near the planet's South Pole, sometimes called the "Inca City", and a giant "face" in the region known as Cydonia.
     The face looks like a giant sphinz, set squarely in the red planet's timeless sands, and is about the same size and shape as our own Ayers Rock.
     This enigmatic visage has been described as "simian" and "monkey-faced", with some scientists even claiming it resembles Jesus Christ and comparing its features with those on the controversial Shroud of Turin.
     More conservative scientists believe it is a natural formation, possibly caused by wind erosion.  Their views reflect established scientific theory, which dismisses the idea of a former civilisation leaving behind great monuments.
     However, meticulous computer image-enchancement work by two former National Aeronautics and Space Administration workers, Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar, supports the alternative theory that the face is an artefact built by a lost civilisation.
     DiPietro and Molenaar used their unique techniques to develop some startling colour-enhanced details of the Cydonia face that reveal, among other things, an eyeball in its one visible eye-socket.  Another US computer enhcncement specialist, Dr Mark Carlotto of the Analytic Science Corporation in Reading, Massachusetts, has since produced separate blow-up pictures that clearly show teeth in the mouth area.
     And the latest research from DiPietro and Molenaar suggests that there are two other faces on Mars-at least one of which matches the Cydonia face in many key details.
     This new evidence points away from the "wind erosion" theory and backs up the higher culture argument.

     DiPietro and Molenaar discovered the two new faces in the region known as Utopia.
     The first face bears a particularly strong resemblance to the Cydonia face.
     The first Utopia face and its Cydonia counterpart share three kdy aspects:  an indentation above the right eye cavity, a distinctive notch in the cheek below the eyes and and Egyptian-style "headdress" (or is it a space helmet?).
     Unlike the Cydonia face, the nose of the Utopia face seems to have been damaged-like our own famous Sphinx in Egypt, which had its nose smashed by a Muslim fanatic around 1400 AD.  
     The Mars face dwarfs its Egyptian cousin, measuring about 2.5 kilometres long and 2 kilometres wide.  It would have taken considerably more than a passing Bedouin to deface it!
     According to DiPietro and colleagues, the second Utopia face, further south, also has the three key markings, but its image is nowhere near as sharp as the other Utopia face.
     But why do we need a third face to confirm the existence of a Martian high culture?  Shouldn't the two faces already discovered be exciting enough evodence?
