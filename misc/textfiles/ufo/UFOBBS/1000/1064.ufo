SUBJECT : "FLYING SAUCERS" OBSERVED OVER
          OAK RIDGE AREA
          INTERNAL SECURITY-X

     There are being submitted herewith two photographs of reputedly
"flying saucers" which were seen at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, sometime
during July of 1947.  All of the information contained in this letter
was received from George Rateman, Resident Engineer, Air Material
Command, United States Army, who is the principal army technician
at the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft Research Center
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

     Mr. Rateman advised that the attached photographs were taken
by ______ in July of 1947.  He stated that interview with _______
revealed that he had been snapping photographs of his family in front
of his residence at 218 Illinois Avenue, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, late
in the afternoon, when he looked into the sky and observed the vapor
trail as exhibited by the photograph numbered "1."  __________ stated
that he took a snap of this trail, was winding the film to the next
number, when he looked into the sky and observed the ball of fire
as shown in photograph 2.  _______ made these photographs available
to reporters of the Knoxville News-Sentinel and a story concerning
them was run in that paper; however, as shown by the photostatic copy
of the newspaper clipping, which is also being submitted herewith
to the Bureau, the print was very indistinct; the news story did not
contain any factual information; and it was regarded generally by
the public at the time as a possible trick.

     Later, it was learned by Rateman And _________ that _________
had made several copies of this photograph and had distributed them
among his aquaintances at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  Upon ___________
finding that the photographs had received some distribution, he requested
Rateman as Head o f the Compliance and Investigations Division, to
recover as many as possible of the photographs, advise the persons
in whose possession they were found to say nothing to anyone concerning
them, and to return the said photographs to him for transmission to
the United States Air Force Intelligence Service.  Rateman advises
that he succeeded in rounding up twenty four copies of these photographs,
and that, according to the statements of ________, no more copies
were made or distributed.  Rateman further stated that _______ had
appeared extremely concerned over the matter and seemed quite emphatic
that the matter should be given no more publicity than was absolutely
necessary.  Rateman also advised that he studied the negatives from
which the reproductions were made, and they appeared to be authentic
in that trick photography should have been apparent, but from
the ______________ __________ ______.



NOTE: THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT WAS OBTAINED THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS,
INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA).  THE DOCUMENT IS
NOT A HOAX.  GUY HOTTEL WAS THE SENIOR AGENT IN CHARGE (SAC) OF THE
WASHINGTON FBI OFFICE IN 1950.  THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY DOCUMENTS THAT,
ALL TOGETHER, INDICATE A GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY COVER-UP OF UFOs
THAT MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE CHILDS PLAY.

Office Memorandum                         UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: DIRECTOR, FBI                             DATE: March 22, 1950

FROM: GUY HOTTEL, SAC, WASHINGTON

SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCERS
         INFORMATION CONCERNING


The following information was furnished to SA [blanked] by
[                               blanked                                ]
[                               blanked                                ]

An investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying
saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.  They were described as
being circular in shape with raised centers, approxi-mately 50 feet
in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape
but only three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine
texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout
suits used by speed flyers and test pilots.

According to Mr. [blanked] informant, the saucers were found in New
Mexico due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered
radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes
with the controling mechanism of the saucers.

No further evaluation was attempted by SA [blank] concerning the above.
