                BERLINER  SIGHTING  REPORT  CLASSIFICATIONS
               _____________________________________________

This is a two-part classification, with an escalating grade from one to ten
within each.  The "Strangeness Scale" expands on the HYNEK divisions, most
notably adding "Night Object" as distinguished from HYNEK's nocturnal light
and daylight disc; separating close encounters of the first kind into night
and daylight; dividing CE-2's into "ambiguous" (e.g. landing trace without an
aerial object report) and "unambiguous"; and separating CE-3's into observa-
tion only, occupant reaction and meaningful communication.

The BERLINER "Creditability Scale" ranks cases by the number and observation-
al expertise of the witness(es) or, as more highly rated, by the device to
verify the observation  (radar, still photo, movie/videotape and live TV).

Preliminary evaluations rely on the BERLINER gradings to determine the nature
of the event as described by the witness(es).  See the March, 1987 issue of
the "Journal" for Mr. Berliner's explanation of this grading method.
