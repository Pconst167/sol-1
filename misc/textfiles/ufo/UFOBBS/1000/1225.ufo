SUBJECT: CROP CIRLCES FOR FUN AND PROFIT                     FILE: UFO1225 




An experiment:  Walk into your wheat field with a small brick
with a hole in it and a twenty foot rope.  Stand in the somewhere
in the middle and twirl the brick at the end of the rope over
your head and slowly work your way down.  Invest an hour or so of
work, choose a light brick or stone to lighten your burden.
Better yet, start with a heavy one to hack and slash the first
layers and then degrade to a lighter one for finer touches.
Remember, only spin the weight in *one* direction.  Then go to a
hill and see if you did a good job.  Work at it and improve your
technique.  In time, try different stone weights and line types
to increase your effective radius of crop destruction.  Heck, in
no time you can do it in the dead of night... if anyone comes upon
the scene investigating the unearthly "wooshing" sounds, simply
let go of the line and the evidence immediately plummets out of
sight through the wheat. "Gosh, look here at this circle I just
found... and did you see that UFO that was here a minute ago?"

Next, setup a stand selling camera film, meteors, UFO books, and
beer... then telephone the National Enquirer.  Its sure to top any
proceeds from last year's roadside produce stand!

Maybe, its significant that the reported crop circles started off
small and slowly got larger?  Maybe it took some experimentation
or muscle building to get the really photogenic results?

Heck, I'll make snow-angels if y'all want to get all excited over
them and photograph and speculate about them... but the beers
gonna cost you!  8-)


If you like this one, maybe I'll explain the South American "Landing Fields"
and animal markings... naaawwww, that's worth a good article.  Maybe even a
computer simulation...
