			   SUMMARY REPORT             2 Feb 1990
	  
	 Sub: Robert Lazar
	  
	  
	 Scope: Background and personality
	  
	  
	  
	 1.  The purpose of this report is to detail the available
	 background of Mr Robert Lazar. Since his recent exposure to
	 the media and the attention it has placed on the activities
	 in the test range this will function as an internal document
	 for staff briefings on the matter.
	  
	 2.  The subject has been employed by a DoD contractor to
	 service and maintain ECM simulator sites in the test complex.
	 At no time has he been admitted to the advanced systems test
	 area. Contractor personnel are familiar with this area thru
	 the peer gossip that occurs. As far as can be determined Mr
	 Lazar has not had access to any current programs in the area
	 nor does the contractor support team he was associated with
	 have clearance for these projects.
	  
	 3.  After a review of his background it is highly likely that
	 the subject seeks recognition thru the spotlight of the
	 media. Mr Lazar has been featured on a local TV program as
	 well as visits to radio talk programs. All indications are
	 that he is highly intelligent but is not satisfied with his
	 level of achievement in his current profession. Checks with
	 his co-workers backup this assessment.
	  
	 4.  All inquiries about Mr Lazar should be handled thru the
	 Nellis AFB Public Affairs office. No further action is
	 recommended or required. As of this date Mr Lazar has not
	 released any sensitive or classified information for which he
	 may have had access.
