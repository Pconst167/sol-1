The following article was published by the newspaper EL VOCERO of
Puerto Rico and is related to UFO activities. Although I have
translated it from Spanish to English, I want to make it clear that I
am NOT a professional translator and that English is my second
language.


"UFO FEVER IN SPAIN. [AGENCIA EFE, MADRID.]
UFO SIGHTINGS REPORTED BY MANY SPANISH AIRLINES PILOTS, WHICH WERE
HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC BEFORE, ARE BEING PUBLISHED BY A MAGAZINE AND
ARE ATTRACTING PUBLIC OPINION'S ATTENTION. "WE SAW SOMETHING THAT STILL
FRIGHTENS US, A SORT OF METALLIC BALLOON WITH A VISIBLE BLACK SIGN. IT
WAS FORMED BY TWO SEMICIRCLES CROSSED BY A CENTRAL LINE," SAID IBERIA
AIRLINE'S PILOT CARLOS GARCIA RODRIGO. THE 54-YEAR-OLD PILOT ADDED
THAT THEY HAD THIS EXPERIENCE DURING A FLIGHT FROM BARCELONA TO MADRID
AT 30,000 FEET OF ALTITUDE. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY TESTIMONIES OF
UFO SIGHTINGS GIVEN BY SPANISH PILOTS TO TIEMPO MAGAZINE AND PUBLISHED
IN ITS LAST EDITION.  "WE SPANISH PILOTS KNOW THAT OUR ARMED FORCES
FILES ARE FULL OF REPORTS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENA BUT SINCE THEY
ARE CLASSIFIED, THEY BECOME SECRET," AFFIRMS RODRIGO. [...] ALSO, JOSE
LUIS RODRIGUEZ BUSTAMANTE, A COMMANDER OF AVIACO [AIRLINES] WITH 21,000
HOURS IN FLIGHT, TELLS TIEMPO WHAT HAPPENED A NIGHT DURING THE 1970s IN
A FLIGHT FROM TENERIFE TO GRAN CANARIA [CANARY ISLANDS.] "A LUMINOUS
OBJECT SHOWED UP SUDDENLY MOVING TOWARDS [OUR] PLANE AS IT WAS GOING TO
COLLIDE WITH IT. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO CRASH AND I BECAME
PARALYZED. THAT [OBJECT] WAS FLYING WITH US FOR THREE VERY LONG
MINUTES. IT VANISHED VERY QUICKLY. IT TURNED BACK TO THE NORTHEAST,
TOWARDS THE SAME POSITION FROM WHERE IT CAME ORIGINALLY. THE TRAFFIC
CONTROL TOWER AT THE AIRPORT ALSO TOLD US THAT IT SAW THE OBJECT SO WE
MADE THE REPORT. HOWEVER, BY ORDER OF THE AUTHORITIES WE WERE
FORBIDDEN TO MAKE THIS EVENT PUBLIC," SAID MR.  BUSTAMANTE.  COMMANDER
IGNACIO LORENZO, A 57 YEARS OLD PILOT WITH 28,000 HOURS IN FLIGHT,
ADMITS TO HAVE FELT SCARED DURING A FLIGHT FROM LONDON TO ALICANTE. "IT
WAS LIKE A HUGE BALLOON SHAPED LIGHT, WITH OTHER BALLOONS AT ITS SIDES.
IT SEEMED TO BE ALIVE FOR IT HAD A DEADLY PURPLE AND GRAYISH COLOR. IT
ALSO HAD A RESEMBLANCE OF VEINS THROUGH WHICH THERE WAS A LIQUID
PASSING, AS IT WAS A HUMAN EYE. WE HAD IT IN OUR RADAR WHEN IT WENT
BEHIND A HILL. WE FINALLY OVERCAME OUR FEAR. I PICKED UP THE MICROPHONE
AND STARTED TO SPEAK TO IT IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH USING THE EMERGENCY
CHANNEL. OF COURSE, WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY ANSWER. SO WE STARTED TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE USING THE LIGHTS. WE FROZE TO DEATH WHEN WE SAW THAT
THING TURNING ON AND OFF ITS LIGHTS ESTABLISHING THIS TYPE OF
COMMUNICATION WITH US. WE SPENT TEN MINUTES DOING IT. WHEN WE ASKED
THEM IF THEY WERE ENEMIES AND IF THEY WERE FROM THIS PLANET, THEY
ANSWERED NEGATIVE TO BOTH QUESTIONS," ADDED LORENZO."
