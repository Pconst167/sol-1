A BARNSLEY man is recovering after a close encounter with a flying
saucer! 

Mr. Joh Brook fled in fright after the UFO turned a blinding white
fluorescent type beam on him.  Mr. Brook, of Berby Street, Barnsley,
felt a tingling sensation throughout his body for the few seconds
he was transfixed by the light coming from beneath the oval shaped,
60 feet wide object.

He has spoken for the first time this week about the experience which
left him ashen-faced.  The UFO was hovering at a height of about 50
feet in the night sky somewhere in the direction of the Co-op Dairy
in Summer Lane.  The object had flashing red and purple lights on
its side.

Mr. Brook, an unemployed technical illustrator, said the close encounter
took place at about 10:50 p.m. on a recent Friday.

He told the Chronicle: "I was on my way home from the pub when I saw
the object in the sky.  From where I was standing, it looked as though
it was spinning on it axis.  Suddenly, this bright white light with
a fluorescent tint shone down on me. I had to close my eyes, it was
so bright.

"I felt this tingling sensation all over and through my body and the
hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.

"I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards home.  I know that
people will suggest that either I was drunk or just another nutter
but I had only drunk about three pints that night because I am unemployed
and that was all I could afford."

When Mr. Brook got home, he and his wife Josephine watched the UFO
from their garden before it disappeared. Mrs. Brook said: "When John
got home he was out of breath and his face was as white as a sheet.
I have known him for about six years and I have never seen him so
frightened."

This was the third time that Mr. Brook has had an encounter with a
UFO.  His first sighting was in the early 1970s and the second, which
took place last year while he was with his neighbour, Mr. Richard
Shirt, was reported to the Royal Air Force.

Reports of an unidentified flying object hovering over a Birmingham
hospital are being investigated by UFO experts.

The 400ft long by 60 ft wide cigar shaped object was spotted by staff
at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield during a night shift.

Three nurses and a doctor who were taking a tea break all saw the
silent object hovering about 800ft up.

The matter has been reported to UFO-Studies Investigations, an amateur 
organization funded by British Aerospace, and the sightings are being 
investigated. 

Mr. John Hurley, of the Midland branch of the organization said:
"Ninety-five per cent of all sightings can be explained away after
investigation as an aircraft an airship, balloon, helicopter or even
a bright star, but not in this case."

He added: "Birmingham airport said they spotted something on the radar."

A Forest Row woman still can not believe her eyes after sighting what
she can only describe as a UFO.

Last Thursday evening just after midnight Mrs. Penny Crowder was leaving
Ursula and Tom Scratchly's house in Post Horn Lane, Forest Row.  Before
getting into her car Mrs.  Crowder looked up at the clear night sky
and saw a glowing orange ball with a pale orange aura surrounding
it move across the sky from west over the Royal Ashdown golf course.

Thinking she might be imagining things she called out to her friend
Penny and they walked up the lane to get a better view.  The two women
were so astounded that they asked Penny's husband Tom to confirm what
they were seeing.

"It was a fiery colour and looked as though it was lit up in some
way." said Mrs. Crowder. "We were just incredulous, you couldn't relate
it to anything because you had never seen anything like it," she said.

The three stood watching the UFO for about ten minutes as it progressed 
noiselessly to the east and out of sight. 

Looking for a rational explana-tion for what they had witnessed, they 
telephoned flight control at Gatwick.  Gatwick said nothing had showed
up on radar but asked them to file a detailed description and a diagram.

They considered all the other possibilities, a hot air balloon, a satellite, 
but none of these fitted the description of what they had seen.  They
sat and talked until three in the morning about the strange fiery object.

"It gave you an eery feeling as it came straight towards you" said Mrs. 
Crowder, who has never before spent time puzzling over the arguments
for and against the existence of UFOs.  "When you started thinking
about it you got a bit frightened," she said,"I had the spooks all
a the way home."

Mrs. Crowder is not the first to be "spooked" by ball-shaped objects
flying over the Ashdown Forest. In the late 1970s a spate of sightings
over the forest exactly match the description of what Mrs. Crowder
and the Scratchlys saw last Thursday evening.

In April 1978 local police launched a search of the area after a Nutley
woman saw what she called a "ball of fire" hurtle past her window.
She then saw bits break off the object and fall directly on to the
Forest.  At least six people in the Forest witnessed it, and on that
night firemen were called to put out fires in two areas of the forest.

News in Focus would be interested to hear from anyone else who saw
the Thursday night fireball.
