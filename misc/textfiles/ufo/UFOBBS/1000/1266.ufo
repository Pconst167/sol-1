THE NIGHT THAT CHANGED HIS LIFE

By Pat Swift

     Former  policeman Alan Godfrey has never consciously claimed
to have met creatures from outer space.
     But whatever happened to him in the "missing minutes" in the
cold  early hours of a November morning over eight years ago  has
irrevocably changed his life forever.
     Alan  hit  the  national headlines over a year  after  first
putting  in  an official report that he had seen a  UFO  hovering
above Burnley Road near Mons Jill.
     At  first there was local interest and a lot of  speculation
about  the  sighting,  particularly  as five  other  officers  in
Calderdale  and Greater Manchester had reported seeing a  similar
object low in the skies on the same morning.
     But  Alan  was not the first police officer in Todmorden  to
put in an official report of a UFO sighting.
     It  was only when a senior police officer persuaded  him  to
reveal  details  of  tapes taken while  he  underwent  regression
hypnosis  that  he  really created a stir on the front  pages  of
nearly every national newspaper.
     For under hypnosis,  under stringent conditions and observed
by  police officers,  Alan told how he had been taken aboard  the
spaceship and had been examined by creatures from outer space.
     "To  this  day,  I  don't  know what  happened  to  me  that
morning," says Alan.   "I can clearly remember seeing this object
revolving  and  hovering  above the road as I  drove  up  towards
Lydgate in the police car.  I stopped the car, made notes and did
a  sketch and then got out of the car and started walking towards
it.
     "The  next thing I can remember is being further up  Burnley
Road beyond the point where I had seen the craft,  but it was  no
longer there."
     Consciously  he  has  no recollection of  what  happened  in
between, but there are physical clues which appear to back up his
story told under hypnosis.
     On  those  tapes  he tells how he was laid on  a  table  and
examined  with some kind of electrical probe fixed to the  insole
of his foot.
     At  the  time  of the incident he found  his  heavy  leather
police  boot had been ripped and he had a small burn mark on  his
insole.
     "It  would be a lot easier for me to believe that I made  it
all  up  under hypnosis...that it was  something  my  imagination
dreamed up.
     "But  the truth is I don't know what happened,  and probably
never will."
     When  the  details of the tapes were released to  the  press
they  linked  it to speculation about a case on  which  Alan  had
worked  five months before his UFO sighting--the mysterious death
of Polish born Leeds miner Zygmunt Adamski.
     Mr.  Adamski  had  disappeared  from near his  home  on  the
outskirts of Leeds.  He had set out to visit a nearby shop to buy
some  potatoes as his family had visitors in preparation for  the
following  day when he was due to give away his God  daughter  at
her wedding.
     He   never  returned--but  five  days  later  his  body  was
discovered in the coal yard near Todmorden station.
     Some  of his clothing was missing;  he had  mysterious  burn
marks  on  the  back of his head which had been treated  with  an
ointment which scientists could not identify as anything known on
earth--and  he had died of a heart attack brought on by  fear  or
shock.
     There  had  been  many  reports of  UFO  sightings  in  West
Yorkshire  around  the  time and Coroner Mr.  James  Turnbull  in
recording an open verdict, said he could not rule out speculation
about creatures from space.
     Alan  was one of the local officers working on the case  and
was surprised that no major investigation was launched.
     But although he was discharged from West Yorkshire Police on
medical grounds due to an injury he had received before all these
strange events, Alan is still bound by the Official Secrets Act.
     "Because  of this I am not allowed to talk about the  case,"
he says.
     After  he became a major news story,  Alan felt that he  was
being subjected to harassment in the force.  "Life was being made
difficult for me," he said.   "I was no longer 'one of the  lads'
and superiors sent me for medical examinations in efforts to show
I was having hallucinations,  but the doctors all gave me a clean
bill of health mentally."
     Eventually  Alan  and the police parted company when an  old
injury incurred during a struggle while on duty was the  official
reason for his medical discharge.
     "I felt I could have continued in the force, even if only at
a desk job," he says.
     But  losing  his job also cost him his home as he  could  no
longer  afford to meet the mortgage payments,  and he had to turn
his hands to other trades.
     "It put a strain on everything and life has been difficult,"
he  recalls.   "The police even raided my leaving party to  check
for after hours drinkers."
     Alan is regularly sought by TV and radio chat show hosts and
the Press.
     "Whenever there is another major sighting,  I start  getting
calls for interviews again."
     But  don't the fees from these TV and radio interviews  help
compensate  for  the difficulties he faced on first  leaving  the
force?
     Alan  smiles wrily.   "There's a sliding scale for interview
fees, and I'm definitely on the bottom rung of the ladder!"
     His  financial fortunes cold change if one of the  Hollywood
film giants decides to take up an option on using the transcripts
of the hypnosis sessions as the basis for a future film.
     But  in the meantime,  Alan is settling into his  new  life,
although he still misses police work.
     And has he seen any further strange objects in the skies?
     "I don't look," he says emphatically.   "If one landed right
in front of me,  I'd turn around and run.  I wouldn't want to get
involved."
