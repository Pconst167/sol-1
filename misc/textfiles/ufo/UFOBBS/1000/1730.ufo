The  following  file  contains what appears to be Tab  A  of  the
findings of the Robertson Panel in 1953.  The Robertson Panel was
a  highly  controversial meeting which was  conducted  under  the
veil  of a scientific panel, however it was later  reported  that
the  Central Intelligence Agency actually conducted and  possibly
influenced  the panel's findings, and that the whole purpose  was
mainly for the benefit of public relations.

Although  the document appears to be authentic, ParaNet  strongly
advises that the reader of this document take into  consideration
the possibility that it is a fake consistent with the rumors that
have  circulated among the UFO community over the years that  the
CIA  actually  released a "dummy" document to  conceal  the  real
findings of the panel.

TAB A

1.  Motion Pictures, Trementon, Utah

     This   case   involves  the   sighting   and   photographing
(Kodachrome Film) of ten bright lights moving across the sky on 2
July  1952 in rough formation.  Source is a Chief  Photographer's
Mate, USN, with 17 years photographic experience.  The local time
was  1110; weather conditions bright, clear, no clouds.   Objects
appeared  to  be "milling about" while traveling  in  a  westerly
direction across the sky.  Source was driving along the road when
the  sighting occurred.  He stopped the car and photographed  the
event with his personal camera.  Toward the end of the  sighting,
one object separated from the rest and reversed course across the
sky.

Status:   ATIC  Photographic Laboratory examination of  the  film
resulted in following conclusions:

          a.  10 objects, all alike in movement and size.

          b.   Decidedly  improbable  that  they  are  birds   or
balloons.

          c.  Exact nature cannot be determined, because they are
visible  only  as  small  spots of light.   It  can  be  deduced,
however, that they are either non-spherical in shape and  similar
to  bright metal in reflectance or else  variably  self-luminous.
Objects  which  follow similar courses  show  similar  brightness
fluctuations which could be caused by their taking similar flight
attitudes.

          d.   Apparently  a  coordination of  movement  to  some
extent  among  these objects.  They seem to  move  in  formations
which are probably 3-dimensional in arrangement.

          e.   The movements suggest flight paths  consisting  of
skew curves in space.
          f.   The single object which reversed  course  remained
reasonably uniform in brightness.  It followed a nearly  straight
line  path  with reasonable uniformity of motion  at  an  angular
velocity of about 2.1 degrees per second.  (This is equivalent to
the  following speeds:  37 mph @ 500 yards; 75 mph @ 1000  yards;
375 mph @ 5000 yards; 758 mph @ 10,000 yards; etc.).

          g.   It  would  probably  be  extremely  difficult   to
imitate this photography for fraudulent purposes.

This  film is currently under examination by the U.S. Navy  Photo
Interpretation Laboratory, Anacostia.  Estimated completion date:
15 January 1953.

2.   Bright  Light sighted from Presque Isle  and  Limestone  Air
Force Bases, [unknown]

     This sighting occurred the night of 10-11 October 1952  from
2300 to 0300 local time, by observers at the weather stations  at
these  Air  Force  Bases.   The  description  of  the  light  was
"circular   orange  object  with  four  green   lights   nearby."
Theodolites  sightings  of elevation and azimuth  were  obtained.
Weather was clear.

Status:  A comparison of observed azimuths and elevations of  the
supposed object with the calculated position and relative  motion
of the planet Jupiter leave little doubt that the observed object
was actually Jupiter.

3.  Reported Sightings of a Strange Object in Florida

          This sighting was reported by a Boy Scoutmaster to have
occurred  at  2150 local time on 19 August 1952  near  West  Palm
Beach,  Florida.   According to the story given, the  source  was
driving  along deserted road in his car, together with  four  Boy
Scouts.   Sighting  a  strange light,  source  stopped  the  car,
cautioned the boys to wait, and entered the palmetto  undergrowth
alone.   When he did not return in a few minutes, and  witnessing
some strange lights in the vicinity of the scoutmaster, the  boys
went for help, returning with a deputy sheriff.  The  scoutmaster
appeared, badly firghtened, slightly burned on the forearms.  His
story  was that he had seen a large curcular object  about  eight
feet  over  his  head  which had released  a  "fire  ball"  which
descended on him.  He stated that he had thrown himself upon  the
ground and "blacked out."  There were various other [unknown]  to
the  story.   His cap was burned slightly and  samples  of  grass
taken  from  the immediate vicinity of  the  "sighting"  differed
strangely in appearance from samples 75 yards away.

Status:   The  background  of the source  indicates  an  unsavory
personal reputation and criminal record, resulting in the  belief
that  the report may have been an elaborate hoax.   However,  the
unusual condition of the grass samples is currently  unexplained.
This  fact, together with other aspects of the case, leave  final
determination in doubt at this time.

ParaNet note:  The following text is taken from an attachment  of
the Robertson Panel Tab A document.  It was included in the  FOIA
release  and contains a memorandum for record dated 16 May  1958.
It should be considered in the same way as the previous document.

16 May 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT:  Meeting with Air Force Personnel Concerning  Scientific
Advisory  Panel Report on Unidentified Flying Objects,  dated  17
January 1953 (Secret)


     1.   A meeting was convened this date eiwht  representatives
of the Air Force to discuss what steps should be taken concerning
the subject report in order to take care of inquiries such as the
letters written by Mr. Leon Davidson.  Mr. Davidson has been most
insistent  upon  getting the entire report  released.   The  full
report  is  classified  "Secret."   A  declassified  version   is
available, a copy of which was given to Mr. Davidson.

          The following personnel were at the meeting:

          Mr. Philip G. Strong          DAD/C/SI, CIA
          Major Joseph E. Boland        SAF LL-3
          Major James F. Byrne          AFCIN-XIA
          Major Lawrence J. Tacker      SAFIS
          Dr. A. Francis Arcier         ATIC
          Mr. George Cary               Legislative Counsel, CIA
          Mr. W. E. Lexow               OSI, CIA

          3.  Paragraph 3 of the report cites examples of actions
that  could  be  taken  by  an  enemy  with  possibly   dangerous
consequences to national security.  This is the principal  reason
that  the entire reason the report cannot be declassified.   This
was agreed to in the meeting.  In addition, it was pointed out by
Mr.  Strong  that  several  of  the  panel  members  specifically
requested  that while they had no objection to their names  being
used  in  connection with this report, they did  not  want  their
names connected to the Central Intelligence Agency.  So far it is
believed  that all connections between the panel members and  CIA
have been made by unofficial personnel.

          4.   In dealing specifically with Mr. Davidson  it  was
agreed  that  Major Tacker would answer for the DCI at  the  same
time  that  he was answering for the Air Forces.   (Mr.  Davidson
sent  a  copy  of his letter to Major Tacker to  the  DCI  for  a
response.)

          5.  Mr. Strong pointed out that perhaps the best way to
forestall any future inquiries along these lines was to put out a
press  release  covering  the  subject  of  unidentified   flying
objects,  utilizing the panel report as much as possible.   Major
Boland  agreed that this was perhaps the best way to  handle  it,
inasmuch as in his capacity of Legilsative Liaison, it would best
satisfy  congressional requirements.  Major Tacker will draft  an
Air Force press release, clearing it through the various sections
of the Air Force, and will then submit it to Mr. Cary for  Agency
review,  Mr. Cary will consult with the Office of  Security,  Mr.
Strong  and  the  undersigned when he receives  the  draft  press
release.

          6.  The Air Force representatives believe that much  of
the  trouble they have been having with Major Keyhoe along  these
same  lines  could be alleviated if the Major did not  have  such
important  personages  as Vice Admiral R. H.  Hillenkoetter,  USN
(ret.),   former   DCI,  on  the  board  of  governors   of   his
organization.   They  suggested that perhaps if the  Admiral  was
shown  the  Secret  panel report he  would  understand  and  take
appropriate  actions.   Mr. Cary said that he would  relate  this
suggestion to Mr. Houston (General Counsel).

          7.   Major Boland suggested that it might be  advisable
to contact the panel members to consider a rewording of th epanel
report somewhat along the lines that Dr. Menzel suggested in  his
letter to all the members of the panel.  Dr. Menzel has  received
the  unclassified  version from Mr. Leon  Davidson.   Mr.  Strong
feels that this may be inadvisable at the present time,  inasmuch
as the report has already been made available to thge public  and
any  change may arouse suspicion.  However, he will  contact  Dr.
Roberston and disucss this.

ParaNet  Note:   The  folowing document was  released  under  the
Freedom of Information Act.  It was contained in the same package
as  the previous material.  As before, we do not  represent  that
the information contained is accurate.

The  documents lists various people who attended an  Intelligence
Advisory  Committee  meeting  to  deal  with  the  UFO   problem.
According  to information gleaned from the document,  it  appears
that  the meeting was number 90 in a series of meetings  of  this
committee.  This does not necessarily mean that the meetings were
specifically  regarding  UFOs, however we are attempting  to  get
information  on  this.   It is further interesting  to  note  the
number   of   CIA  personnel  in  attendence,   indicating   that
information  that has been passed along over the years  that  the
UFO problem was highly regarded by the CIA.

          a.   Enlist  the  services of  selected  scientists  to
review  and  appraise  the available evidence  in  the  light  of
pertinent scientific theories.

and  peripheral  considerations,  and  noted  that  most  of  the
available  evidence  is  processed  by  ATIC.   General   Samford
offerred his full cooperation.  It was recognized that he problem
is  best approached if directly related to specific  problems  of
intelligence  and  defense.  It was thought  desirable  that  the
action  noted  above under "a" be  undertaken  immediately,  with
consideration  of a proposed NSCID to depend in some  measure  on
the results achieved by the scientist's studies.
