SUBJECT: DUTTON, ALABAMA SIGHTING REPORT                     FILE: UFO1315


LOG # 890803 - Event 07/18/89, in Dutton, Alabama.  Investigators Carol and
Rex Salisberry.  A couple had retreated inside due to threatening weather
when an acquaintance (of reputed psychic ability) phoned to say they should
be looking for UFO's.  Returning outside, the sky was totally clear.  Moments
later, they observed an oval white light moving slowly past in the distance.
Ten minutes later, the thunderstorm ensued.  [Notes: The wife may have
experienced a bedroom intrusion by a cloaked figure later that night.  She
had numerous experiences, alone and with others, of a triangular object in
connection with the Fyffe, Alabama sightings.]
