        About the Author -

        Stuart A. Kingsley is a fiber optic consultant and Director of the
    world's first Amateur Optical SETI Observatory.  He received a B.Sc.
    Honors and Ph.D. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from The
    City University, London (1972) and University College London (1984),
    respectively (England).  He worked at Battelle Columbus Division as
    Principal Research Scientist and then as Senior Research Scientist from
    1981 to 1987.  He has been involved in producing a variety of fiber-
    optic sensors, including fiber-optic rotation sensors.  He invented
    the fiber-optic line-stretcher and fiber-optic line-squeezer phase
    modulators that are now important components in fiber-optic sensor
    systems.  He shared a 1984 Rank Prize in Optoelectronics for pioneering
    work on fiber-optic sensing.

        Stuart's other professional interests include the possible health
    effects of electromagnetic pollution and adverse effects from fluor-
    escent lighting/VDT flicker.  He is the author of 38 papers in fiber-
    optics, mainly related to coherent systems and distributed fiber-optic
    sensing, and several patents mainly in the area of coherent fiber-optic
    systems.  He is a member of the IEE, a British Chartered Engineer, a
    senior member of IEEE and a member of Eta Kappa Nu Association.  He
    is also a member of The Planetary Society, the Columbus Astronomical
    Society, and a former member of the Astronomical Society of Haringey
    (ASH) in London.
