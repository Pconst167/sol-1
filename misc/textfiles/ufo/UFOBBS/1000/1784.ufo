RE: Could it have been Hanger-18?
        Well fellow stargazers, here is one of my experiences.
It pertains to what is now known as the "Hangar-18 incident".
        I was living in Miami, circa 1975, when I happened to read a short,
four paragraph article on the last page of Section A of the Miami Herald.
It was about a space craft of unknown origin that had crashed in the Mojave
Desert and was taken to an undisclosed Air Force base somewhere in New
Mexico.  The article fascinated me, and I could kick myself in the *** for
not cutting it out for future reference.  The reason I didn't was probably
because I passed it off as another hoax.  Nevertheless, I scoured the paper
for the following month looking for a follow-up article, thinking that
there surely would be one.  There was none to be found.  Squashed like a
bug.  Hmm, I thought.  Was this a writers idea of a funny joke, or did
something potentially volatile just get squashed?
        Anyway, about a year or two later, I found myself working part-time
at a Drive-In theater trying to put myself through college.  I met a guy
there who was interesting enough to talk to, so we did.  After getting to
know each other, he told me he was in the Air Force stationed at
Davis-Monthan <SP> AFB.  He then told me about one night when he was on
guard duty and a strange craft was brought in to be transferred to
Wright-Patterson ASAP and with no questions or comments.  He saw it with
his own two eyes, he claims.  He was also screened to keep his mouth shut,
etc.
        Along comes circa 1985 and the movie "Hangar-18".  Now at first
when I read the article in 1975, I was skeptical.  To conclude this story,
I am still skeptical at each individual account on its own.  When you
consider three, separate, un-related accounts, that corroberate <SP> the
same incident, it tends to diminish the skepticism in my mind.
        BTW, the guy at the Drive-In described what he saw as a weird
looking craft about 24 feet across with 2 passengers aboard who were about
3 feet in length.  That is, of course, off the record...
