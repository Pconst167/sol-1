                           from the 1-2-90 issue of
                            Dan Wright's newsletter

In a recent case occurring in Florida (related below), two men standing
long a road were distracted by the sudden, excited barking of numerous
dogs.  They then noticed bright aerial lights approaching and observed
a large anomalous vehicle.

On a windy night in March 1980, two women and their eight children
watched as a 12 - 15 - foot object of undefined shape within a glowing
aura approached and remained some 50 feet from their door, performing
feats and color changes over a 2-hour period.  At various points, each
of three dogs was let outside, yet none appeared to notice the
intruder.

As noted by Allan Hendry "The UFO Handbook" (Doubleday, 1979), animals
do not share the technological fantasies and anticipations of humans.
Pets such as dogs and cats, moreover, possess more acute senses, most
notably hearing, and can detect emanations which we cannot.  [Whether
an animal can detect microwaves, low-strength magnetic fields or
minute static charges is not known.]  Consequently, if an animal
reacts during the reported observation, it is inferred that
*something* was there to be sensed.

The expectation that animal reactions are linked closely with UFOs is
a preconception in the consciousness of the American public.  To state
the obvious, animals can't speak for themselves, so the interpretation
of their actions is left to the human witness.  Cats have been
reported to arch their back, hair standing on end, at the sight of a
strange airborne vehicle.  Of course, the sight of a strange cat would
have caused the same result.  UFOs have long been linked to dogs
howling, barking, or cowering.  Dogs likewise howl at the moon and
bark at just about anything, including the barking of other dogs.
Some dogs cower whenever an adult looks at them.

You should also keep in mind that pets are often closely attuned to -
and influenced by - the moods of their masters.  Thus, if a person is
acting excitedly or fearfully at the perception of a UFO, the animals
in his/her presence may well exhibit a strong response also.

Hendry concludes this chapter of his excellent book with an
observation:  "Clearly, while animals have different motives for
response to UFO and IFO stimuli than humans, the range is just as
complex and baffling to sort out."

We do seek to compile all the evidence available on animal reactions
to genuine UFOs.  When milk or egg production drops afterward, when
an animal is injured or when its behavior is described as totally out
of character, something physical seemingly caused it.  Animal reactions
will be included in our computerized records, sorting both by species
and type of reaction.

In Chapter VIII of the MUFON "Field Investigator's Manual", Ray Fowler
reminds us that a Form 4 should be completed (and mention of the
reaction included in the "Personal Account" section of the Form 1) for
all anecdotal evidence.  If the animal displays symptoms of residual
radiation, a Form 10 should be completed and a radiological
examination conducted as part of the treatment administered.  Where
physical evidence is apparent (e.g. an injury or significant loss of
fur or feathers, the animal should be photographed and a Form 6 filled
out.)

A final point:  The investigator should never ask a witness whether
animals were present.  This is a leading question and only encourages
the witness to speculate on behavior that may not have been otherwise
regarded as extraordinary.  Reactions (or a lack of reaction) regarded
as unusual at the time will in all likelihood be volunteered by the
witness.
