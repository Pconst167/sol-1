(5,Bert) Any time, Don is here with me.

(5,Wedge) Don, is Ed ********* with you?

(5,Bert) Ed is not here

(5,Don M) Dale, which Don

(5,Wedge) Sorry, Don Ware.

#;;C_ISSU: - Job 77: switching handles now

(5,DON) Hi you all.......

(5,Bill) hi Don

(5,Mark[Y]) Hello, all!

(5,Don M) hihi

(Ted) Are we ready? ga

(5,DON) go

(5,Don Ware) All set here

(5,Bill) yes

(Ted) Tonight's special guest is Donald Ware, head of the Gulf Breeze UFO
investigation for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Don is a retired Air Force
officer (fighter pilot) who resides in Ft. Walton Beach, FL and is also a state
director for MUFON.  He was spotlighted on NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" last
month.  Before we open the floor to questions I'll get things going with a
couple of basic questions. Ready Don? GA

(5,Don Ware) yes

(Ted) I understand there has been quite a bit of new activity in Gulf Breeze the
last few months. Could you tell us a little about what has been happening? --
Especially involving the incident last week where an airforce pilot and his wife
had a major encounter on the beach. I heard a rumor that a significant stretch
of beach was closed. Anything to that? GA

(5,Don Ware) First let me clarify for the record that Charles Flannigan is the
chief investigator on the GB case.  I have been coordinating some of the related
activities.  Regarding recent incidents a week ago Monday, about 10:15 pm, 3
teenagers on Pensacola beach were told by US Airforce security police that they
must clear the beach. Thirty minutes later, James Larken with another person
reported a UFO 12-13 ft in diameter, 25 ft above the tree tops two miles east of
GB. This is just north of the Sound from where the teenagers were, and I
understand that the teenagers told Mark Curtis of TV3 that an incident was in
progress. ga

(Ted) Thanks for setting us straight on the "head" investigator.  What's your
opinion of the attacks being leveled by individuals like Willy Smith? In a
report at a national UFO conference in Cleveland recently, Smith reported that
he believed the whole GB thing to be a hoax. GA

(5,Don Ware) First let me clarify that the teenagers were told by the POLICE
that an incident was in progress. I think Willy Smith has a personal problem.
We have not communicated with him since late March when his responses to our
communications became unreasonable. ga

(Ted) Can you elaborate? ga

(5,Wedge) !

(5,Tom Mickus) !

(5,Don Ware) I'd prefer not to elaborate further, because I prefer not to
discuss other people. ga

(5,DON) !!

(Ted) I will now open the floor, Dale and Mickus are already on the list (along
with Don) ga

(5,Wedge) Thank you. I was just wondering how you feel about the recent
reduction of Bob Boyd and Willy Smith in MUFON circles...since every case needs
to have both sides expressed, don't you feel that one sided censorship is taking
place?ga

(5,Don Ware) The change in MUFON status of Boyd and Smith has certainly not
changed their visibility. ga

(Ted) Mickus is next GA

(5,Tom Mickus) Don, can you tell us if the names of two of the people who also
have photos is going to be released...and has Maccabee analyzed these pics at
all and if he has, when is the computer analysis going to be made public in
print?...and one other question, if Mr. "Ed" is supposed to be a major
construction contractor in GB why can't someone determine who is really is?
Thanks. GA DON.

(5,Mark R. Owens) !

(5,Don Ware) The two photos from 1986 and the 9 photos from "believer Bill" were
taken by people who have not allowed interviews [A lady named Millie took 2
photos on 6 April the objects were quite small, .001 radians....

(Ted) Don Ware got knocked off. Please stand by.....


[Light music...]

(5,Wedge) <Light Beer?>

[Irritating commercial chatter]

[More Light music]

(5,G-WIZ) ha!

(5,Bert) got knocked off, we are back...

[Bert changes name to Don Ware]

(5,Don Ware) We have been unable to locate Mike Johnson, who dropped off an
undeveloped roll of film at the Gulf Breeze Sentinel. ga

(5,DON) Hang in there with me, the keyboard is acting up. Ok, Don, all around
the UFO community the entire "House" is in disarray perfect case in point is the
GB case this is one that has divided the ranks down the middle You, Walt,
Maccabee on one side giving the facts that this is very promising, on the other
side, People like Smith, etc, not to mention Klass using it to show the rest of
the world how we are our own worst enemies. My point is this,. first what do you
consider to be the most effective evidence to show that something is indeed
occurring, and then do you have any ideas on how you would suggest a healing of
the ranks??  and follow up.  ga

(5,Tom Mickus) !

(5,Mark R. Owens) !

(5,Don Ware) Bob Boyd and Willy Smith appear to me to be debunkers. We have 7
investigators in NW Florida who have been working on this case plus 3-4 others
working on nearby cases. We try to investigate according to the MUFON manual we
report what we learn. The reaction of other investigators or debunkers is not MY
concern. The NW Florida MUFON case number 15 has been investigated more
thoroughly than any case I know one couple has had 22 encounters, including 18
separate photographic sessions in a 5 and a half month period. They have taken
pictures with every kind of camera we gave them. The 1 May photographs show an
object 14.8 ft in diameter, and 14.8 ft high at a distance of 475 ft over the
water. The NIMSLO object is in the same frames calculated to be 132 ft away. The
object appears to be about 3 ft long. NUMEROUS REPUTABLE people reported objects
they described as similar to those photographed. ga

(5,Wedge) !

(5,Mark R. Owens) Thank you.  I would like to know what type of credentials that
Ed has and how does he fit into the picture with respect to previous association
with MUFON or other similar organizations. ga

(5,Don Ware) Ed has no previous association with MUFON or other UFO groups. I
met him on 20 November, the day after the first pictures were published. ga

(5,Mark R. Owens) follow?
(Ted)  We have a lot in line Mark. I have put you in Queue.  Dale is next ga

(5,Wedge) Don W is a book in the works?  And if so, can you tell us the
percentage of take that Ed will take?ga

(5,Don Ware) On 7 January, I told Ed that this case requires presentation to the
public in two forms. First a TV documentary, because it was primarily visual
evidence; and secondly a book must be written because that is the ONLY format
that can tell the whole story. ga

(5,Don Ware) wait... I have no knowledge of the finances. ga

(Ted) Tom Mickus is next ga Tom

(5,Tom Mickus) Don, I'm not sure if you answered my previous question as to
whether Ed is a moajor construction contactor in GB...and when the computer
analysis by Maccabee will be pout into print. And a suggestion: Why doesn't
someone work a deal with Sony and make sure that everyone down there scraps
their cameras and get camcorders instead. And lastly, do you know where I can
get a copy of a 1985 Air force regulation entitled "AF200-2"  Thanks...GA

(5,Don Ware) During the previous 5 years Ed averaged building 20 houses per
year.  During the past 12 months, he has only built 9.  The reason is that an
extensive and UFO investigation and building custom homes do not mix. Not
everyone wants to trust their life savings to someone who photographs strange
things. Dr. Maccabees photo analysis has been completed on select photographs.
Release date unknown.  Library of congress would be a source for info on
regulations. Or "Clear Intent" has a copy of AFR200-2..ga

(Ted) DON is next GA DON form Boise

(5,DON) Don, on my last question, I asked you what piece of evidence you felt
was most provocative from the stand point of showing that this was a very
serious case, so what piece of evidence do you feel would be the one and how is
the abduction phenomenon shaping up in GB??

(5,Wedge) !

(5,Don Ware) As I stated in my initial statement is the combination of excellent
photographs and the reputation of independent witnesses that makes GB "case 15"
greatly significant. We had 10 abductees at our support group meeting last
Tuesday (29 Nov.). My impression is that...


(5,DON) Ok, but is there any physical evidence, or military?

(Ted) Wait DON Please!

(5,Don Ware) they are being helped by our activities several abductees have
undergone extensive hypnotic regression.

(Ted) Mark O is next ga

(5,Mark R. Owens) I wanted to know if the government has been involved in this
thing, and if so, to what extent officially?  Also, has Ed been an abductee?
ga.

(Don Ware) Three mobile radars surrounded GB shortly after the photos were
published. Thompson 871111/0815 and McClellan 871202/00## both reported fighters
making a pass toward the UFO. Light aircraft showed up after other sightings.
Light aircraft were reported orbiting over East Bay almost every night during
the peak of the sightings. We suspect that the government knows more about
what's going on than we do. Ed has has at least 4 periods of missing time at
ages 17, 25, 33, and 41. Perhaps later details may be released. ga

(Ted) DAle is next

(5,Wedge) If the Ed story turns out to be real it is the story of the
century if it doesn't, it could it could really destroy Ufology.  Is there
anything about Ed that you think could be detrimental to your case?ga

(Ted) [good ? Dale]

(5,Don Ware) we are back

(Ted)  Dale can you repeat? ga

(5,Wedge) I think I said...and if not, Ted ask the q. This case could be the
most important one in the past century.  But, perhaps it may not be as it seems.
Is there anything in the case or in Mr. Ed that troubles you as an investigator?
Your case may be the downfall of MUFON, if it is wrong.  Let us) hope that is
isn't.  Are there no reservations?g

(5,Don Ware) There are no reservations. The GB flap is a large number of cases
ga

(Ted) Don is next ga Don

(5,DON) pass

(Ted) Mark Y is up GA

(5,Mark Y) Has any hardware or landing tracings been found? GA

(5,Mark R. Owens) !

(5,Don Ware) A circle 12-14 ft in diameter in the school yard was affected so
that the grass died and did not grow back in the Spring. Extensive investigation
has been unable to determine the cause.  On 17 Dec. Ed said he saw some liquid
fall from a UFO into a field. A "butter tub" with rainwater, dirt and algae was
found bubbling and apparently captured some of the fluid. Two analyses of the
fluid indicated diluted sea water. ga

(Ted)  Wedge is up GA

(5,Mark R. Owens) !

(5,Wedge) The Northeast Ohio sighting is unique in that not only are there
independent witnesses, photos, etc., but we have official document showing that
the event took "official" place.  Gulf Breeze is really big in event status, but
no documents, from what I can see from military sources.  Are there some?

(5,Bill) !!!!!

(5,Don Ware) There has been nothing from any government agency on GB. ga

(5,Wedge) ? follow

(Ted) Follow Dale

(5,Wedge) Is there a reason that Gulf Breeze is more important than the Lake
Erie sighting (which has an official U.S. document)?  Or is is that your case
has been commercialized by the Sentinel and Walt Andrus?  My case hasn't even
made the MUFON Journal, but I'm not writing a book.ga

(Ted) Dale tonight's subject is GB. Let's not forget!

(5,Don Ware) I have very little information on the NE Ohio case.

(Ted) Next is Mark, [then BILL of Anaheim] ga Mark

(5,Mark R. Owens) Don,  Now that you have had experience with several abductees,
has any determination been made as to what the motives are behind the GB
incidents. I have heard that there is something behind this, possibly some type
of programming or something of that nature.  And, what is the future as you see
it for GB?

(5,Wedge) Religious? Sorry!

(5,Don Ware) The abduction phenomenon was going on here before the photographs
were taken, and they have continued since 1 May. I think that the abduction
phenomenon and the GB photographs are 2 separate issues.
