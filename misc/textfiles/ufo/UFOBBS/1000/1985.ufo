SUBJECT: SPACE ALIEN HELPED U.S. GET TO THE MOON             FILE: UFO1985


Cape Canaveral, Fla. - A stranded space alien gave America the
technology to make it to the moon in the 1960s - in exchange for
NASA engineers repairing his spaceship so he could make it back 
to his home galaxy!

It was America's darkest secret...even more secret than the A-bomb,
a former NASA design engineer told this reporter in an exclusive
interview in his home here.

The retired engineer agreed to lift that veil of secrecy when the
NEWS agreed not to reveal his identity.

The alien, who came to Earth from a distant galaxy, gave NASA the
data needed to build the incredible Saturn 5 rocket that carried 
America's Apollo astronauts to their rendezvous with the moon in
July 1969, the engineer said.

It was before dawn on Feb. 16, 1963, when the alien crash landed
his ship at the Kennedy Space Center. He was taken into custody
and questioned by the FBI for more than a week.

He said he came from a planet almost 20 billion light years from
Earth and was making a routine flight ot our galazy when his main
life support pressure tank ruptured. With out the tank, the alien
said he wouldn't be able to get back to his planet.

At the time we were having trouble developing an engine powerful
enough to carry out a moon landing mission. We just couldn't design
a rocket powerful enough to lift a 5 million pound spaceship!

Well, the alien said he would give us the plans for an engine that
could generate more than 7 million pounds of thrust...if we repaired
his pressure tank and allowed him to go on his way.

To make a long story short, it was an offer NASA couldn't refuse. I
was called in and I installed a main tank and backup able to maintain
a pressure of 900 psi. The alien was delighted.

And he kept his part of the deal by giving NASA all the data it needed,
along with detailed plans, to build the engine we needed to make it to 
the moon.

And as they say, the rest is history.
