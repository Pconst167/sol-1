SUBJECT: GOVERNOR OF IDAHO SEES FLYING SAUCER                FILE: UFO1390



From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, July 3, 1947

                  MORE "FLYING SAUCERS" REPORTED

                       ARMY EXPERTS PUZZLED

   Persons in six states, including the lieutenant governor of
Idaho, today reported that they had seen the mysterious "flying
saucers".

   The projectiles, variously described as "too fast for an air-
plane and not fast enough for a falling star, not moving at all"
and "traveling at great speed," were reported seen again last
night streaking over Denver.

   It was the first report of the "saucers" in almost a week.
Persons in Oregon, California, New Mexico, and Idaho reported
seeing verious versions of the unexplained projectiles last week.

   << Lieutenant Governor Donald S. Whitehead of Idaho said today
that he saw a strange comet-like object hanging in the western
sky on June 24. That was the day Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Idaho
first reported seeing the projectiles over south-eastern
Washington. >>

   Their stories varied. Arnold had estimated the projectiles
speed at 1,200 miles an hour. Whitehead said the objects he and
three other witnesses saw "didn't move, but just seemed to go
below the horizon with the rotation of the earth".

   << WASHINGTON, JULY 3 (UP)  Army research experts can't find
an explain the "flying saucers" reported in several states. But
they are investigating, they said.

   They are even considering the possibility, however remote,
that some foreign power may have something to do with the flying
discs.

  The army air forces checked all of their research authorities
and contractors. But none of them knew or could suggest anything
concrete about the saucers. >>

  At Denver, Henry Martin and Walter Harrod said they caught a
brief glimpse of a group of "bright objects" flying at about
5,000 feet last night. Martin said they looked like coffee can
tops. They were traveling in a south-westerly direction, he said.

   State Highway Patrol Sergeant David Menary, of San Francisco's
Golden Gate bridge detail, reported seeing about a dozen bright
metal objects "about the size of a football" whizz over San
Francisco Bay yesterday and fall into the sea.

   Dick Rankin, former Portland, Oregon flyer said he saw the
discs high over Bakersfield, California going from 300 to 400
miles an hour June 23. There were 10 of them in formation, flying
north, he said.

   Three metalic gleaming were reported seen for the first time
in Southern California by Mrs. Ernest Michel of Beverly Hills and
her daughter, Marian. "They were going around and around in a
circle," Mrs. Michel said. "We watched them for 10 minutes before
they disappeared."

   Tiny, meteor-like tails were "clearly discernible," she said.
