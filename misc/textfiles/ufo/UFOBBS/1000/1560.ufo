                            TIBET, SHAMBHALA AND UFO's
                                        by

       PART ONE - THE KALACHAKRA - Wheel of Time

       I have been  a  UFO  investigator  for  ten years, working for APRO,
       MUFON and CUFOS.  I have had a lifelong interest in Tibetan Buddhism
       and last summer (1988) I made a  commitment  to  become  a  student.
       This July (1989)  I  will  be  receiving  ten  days  of  instruction
       followed for three  days  by  the Kalachakra Initiation given by His
       Holiness the Dalai Lama.

       In preparation for receiving the initiation I have been listening to
       many tapes and reading books selected  by  the  lamas.   I have been
       fascinated by the teachings concerning Shambhala.

       I should say here that I have not yet received any secret teachings.
       I would not  reveal those teachings.  What I am about  to  share  is
       part of the preparation and is given to anyone.

       The following is  a  compilation  of material from three sources:  a
       tape of a lecture given in English  by  Dr.  Alex  Berzin at Thubten
       Dhargye Ling, a  Tibetan Buddhist Center in Los Angeles  on  May  3,
       1988;  tapes of  a  series of lectures given in Tibetan with English
       translation at the  same center by  the  Venerable  Geshe  Gyeltsen,
       beginning March 2, 1989; and a book I received from  the center when
       I registered.  Words  in  quotation marks are the exact words of Dr.
       Berzin or the Ven. Geshe Gyeltsen:

       Shambhala is the name of both an actual ancient kingdom of Tibet and
       a metaphorical kingdom. The King of  Shambhala  traveled to India to
       meet the Bhudda and receive the Kalachakra teachings.   He then took
       the teachings back  to  Shambhala  where  they  were  preserved  for
       centuries.

       Part of the Kalachakra teachings concern a predicted invasion in our
       times, "the psychology of invasions",  "advice  on  how to deal with
       and cope with invasions" and "invasion mentalities."   Based on very
       sophisticated astrological/astronomical calculations it says that we
       are now entering  a  dark  age  when  the  powers of negativity will
       consist of men allied with demons.  It will become nearly impossible
       for a person to maintain his or her Buddhist spiritual practice.


                                      Part 1





       Detailed instructions are  given  in  the  Kalachakra  for "building
       various machines" to ward off the invaders.

       The Kalachakra predicts that one of  our worst problems will be that
       the powers of negativity will be "tampering with the  tables."  They
       are refering to astrological tables and Dr. Brezin specifically says
       on the tape  that  in  our  times  that  would mean messing with the
       programming of our computers! (see  Clear Intent p. 27-28.)  He says
       it's very hard  to  defend yourself if the enemy has  tampered  with
       your astrological charts or your computers.

       This dark age  will last until the year 2424 A.D. when a "great war"
       will begin in India.  The human  race  will  be  rescued  from total
       destruction by the  armies of Shambhala riding "flying  horses"  and
       "boats that fly in the air."  A Golden Age will begin in A.D. 2424.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       That is what I know so far.  I may be misunderstanding the teachings
       or perhaps I  am  like  a person who reads part of the Bible for the
       first time and, being impressed  by  the  story  of  Noah, tells her
       friends it's about boatbuilding.  I do not wish to  misinform and so
       I remind the  reader  that  I  am  a  novice.  I will update this in
       August or September if it is necessary.

       PART TWO - Sally Sheridan

       Above I have summarized some of the  Kalachakra  teachings  as  they
       relate to the  current  state of affairs in UFO research.   I  would
       like to share  a  brief  but  tantalizing  conversation  I  had with
       someone in July of 1988.

       THE MEDITATION INSTRUCTOR

       I am not an authority on Tibet or  Buddhism.  As I stated, I am just
       beginning my formal  study but my interest in Tibetan  Buddhism  and
       Tibet in general began thirty-one years ago when I was thirteen.

       Last July while  vacationing  with  my  family  in Colorado I made a
       decision to become a Buddhist.

       I flew to Denver and drove a rented  car to Boulder, the location of
       the Karma Dzong Center (I had called ahead).  I was  assigned  to  a
       meditation instructor I  will  call  Paul.   I  was  fortunate to be
       assigned to Paul on a number of counts.   He was knowledgeable about
       the Buddhism of many Asian countries and on that count  was  the one
       who could answer the kinds of questions I wanted to ask.

       I spent two  days at the center meditating with others and receiving
       some introductory orientation. Incidently,  there  were  no Tibetans
       around.  Then, on Sunday, I went to breakfast with Paul.  It was the
       first time we had met face to face.

       The restaurant was  very  busy and we had to wait outside  about  45
       minutes. Paul was  young  looking  but  I  guessed  him to be in his
       thirties.  He owns  a  computer consulting  business.   He  is  from
       Australia and has a pleasant accent.  Back in the Seventies  he  had
       left Australia with  a girl, to backpack around Nepal and India.  It
       was there, in northern India, where  he  encountered the clusters of
       Tibetans displaced from their own country by the Chinese.  He was so
       impressed by the Tibetan lamas he met there that he said good-bye to

                                      Page 2





       the girlfriend and  stayed  with the lamas.  Later he and some other
       young Australians built a center in  Australia and relocated some of
       the lamas there.  He began studying the Tibetan language.   For many
       years he has   worked   on   the   Translation  Committee  which  is
       translating precious ancient Tibetan writings into English.

       All of which is the setting for the  following conversation which we
       had while waiting to be called for breakfast:

          Sally:  So you left Australia and came here to  Boulder  to  work
                  with the   Tibetans.   Are  you  planning  to  stay  here
                  indefinitely?

          Paul:   No. My wife and I are  planning  to  move  to Nova Scotia
                  next year. *

          Sally:  Why?  Is it because of the center up there?

          Paul:   No. It has to do with the things that are  coming  out of
                  our translations of the old Tibetan books.

          Sally (wearily):   I  know.  I  know.  There's going to be global
                  upheaval and there are  only a few safe places and that's
                  one of them.  Right?

          Paul (somberly):  Well, something like that.

       I knew from his manner that he had said all he was  going to on that
       subject.  I don't  know  what  this  means  but  in  the  Kalachakra
       teachings it says that there are five sacred places on Earth.  I
       wonder if one of them is Nova Scotia.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       *Note:  I had noted during my two  days  at  the center that many of
               the staff either had moved to Nova Scotia already or
               were planning to do so.
