PART 18

 Nonetheless  it  seemed  unlikely that MJ-12,  EBEs,  and  other
cover-up  matters would pass away soon. The Dark Siders  appeared
well  on their way to starting a new occult movement  in  America
and   elsewhere.   Among  movie  conservative   ufologists   many
legitimate  questions about conceivably more substantive  matters
remained  to  be  answered.  A  reinvestigation  of  the  Roswell
incident  by  Don Schmitt and Kevin D. Randle of  CUFOS  produced
what appeared to be solid new evidence of a UFO crash and  cover
up.  The  emergence  of  Robert  Lazar,  who  even  a  mainstream
journalist such as television reporter George Knapp concluded  is
telling  the truth as he knows it possibly suggested a degree  of
substance  to recurrent rumors about developments in Area 51  and
S4.  Even  Moore's  critics were  puzzled  by  the  extraordinary
interest  of  intelligence operatives in ufologists and  the  UFO
phenomenon,   going   back  in  time  long   before   Bennewitz's
interception  of low-frequency signals at Kirtland and  ahead  to
the present. Why go to all this trouble and expense, with so many
persons  over  such a period of time, if there are  no  real  UFO
secrets to protect?

 Moore  says  he is still working with the "birds,"  who  are  as
active as ever. The birds tell him, he says, that  disinformation
is  used  not  only against ufologists  but  even  against  those
insiders like themselves who are privy to the cover-up. Those  in
charge are "going to great lengths to mislead their own  people."
At  one point the birds were told that there is no  substance  to
abduction reports, only to learn later, by accident, that a major
high-level study had been done. "Even people with a need to  know
didn't know about it," he says. "The abduction mess caused a  lot
of  trouble.  There may have been an official  admission  of  the
cover-up by now if the abductions had not come into prominence in
the 1980s."

 As  for  the  stories  of  ongoing  contact  between  the   U.S.
government  and  extraterrestrial biological  entities,  he  says
there is, in his observation, a "pretty good possibility,  better
than three to one," that such a thing is happening. "But I  don't
think  we  can communicate with them. Perhaps we  only  intercept
their communications. Or maybe they communicate with us."

 He  thinks  he  has found MJ-12. "It's not in  a  place  anybody
looked,"  he  says. "Not an agency one would have  expected.  But
when you think about it, it fits there" (Moore, 1990).

 Doty, now a New Mexico State Police officer, was decertified  as
an  AFOSI agent on July 15, 1986, for "misconduct" related to  an
incident  (not  concerned with UFOs) that occurred while  he  was
stationed  in West Germany. In August Doty requested a  discharge
from  the  Air Force and was sent to New Jersey to  be  separated
from  the  service.  But then, Doty  says,  the  Senior  Enlisted
Advisor for AFOSI made a trip to the Military Personnel Center at
Randolph  AFB,  Texas,  and  asked that  Doty  be  reassigned  to
Kirtland,  where  his son lived. In September Col.  Richard  Law,
Commander of AFOSI District 70, rescinded Doty's  decertification
and  assigned  him to Kirtland as a  services  career  specialist
(i.e.,  an  Air Force recruiter). When he left the Air  Force  in
October  1988,  he  was  superintendent  of  the  1606   Services
Squadron.  Doty remains close to Moore and  uncommunicative  with
nearly everyone else. All he will say is that one day a book will
tell  his  side  of  the story and  back  it  up  with  "Official
Government Documents" (Doty, 1989).
