THOSE CROP CIRCLES:  'NO CAUSE FOR ALARM'

UFOLOGIST Mrs. Marilyn Preston Evans, of Saltash, said this week that she had been mistaken when passing on a message from author Mr. Pat Degado regarding crop circles.
     She said in a recent article in the 'Mid-Devon Advertiser,' that Mr. Delgado, co-author with Colin Andrews of the book 'Circular Evidence,' had issued a warning on crop circles, following the discovery of circles in fields of corn at Bickington.
     "He has asked me to point out that there is no cause for any alarm or worry from entering the circles," she said.

                    CHECKS

     "In personally passing on his message I was apparently mistaken in implying that anything in the circles themselves caused any undue physical effects.
     "Such effects, I am assured, come from 'Psychological over-reaction' causing headaches, tension and associated feelings,' said Mrs. Preston Evans.
     She said that radiation checks in the circles had shown there was no difference to that registered elsewhere in the crop fields.
     "I trust the statement did not cause any worry or distress, as in no way was it meant to be alarmist," she said.
