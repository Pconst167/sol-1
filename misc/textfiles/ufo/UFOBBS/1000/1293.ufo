Nashville, Tenn. - Extraterrestrials beamed dead Lawrence Kacher aboard a gli-
mmering blue starship and brought him back to life while his wife and childre-
n watched! 

It's a miracle from Heaven and sign from God, said Martha Kacher, the man's
wife. Doctors said Lawrence was dead and there was nothing they could do for
him.

But those space aliens have powers greater than that of any man. They gave my
husband the most precious gift of all. They gave him back his life.

Authorities declined to discuss the incident. But a leading Christian newslet-
ter said the drama unfolded three days after Kacher, 53, suffered a fatal 
heart attack.

Rev. Paul Marin was reportedly conducting the dead man's funeral in a cemetery
when the starship swooped down from the sky and sucked Kacher's wife, son and
daughter aboard with a white tractor beam. The coffin went up, too, with Mr.
Kacher still in it, said Rev. Marin. The family cried out for help but we were
alone in the cemetery and there was nothing I could do. I prayed for God to 
protect them on their journey.

When the family vanished into the belly of the ship, the UFO took off over the
horizon. The minister reported the incident to authorities who, he said, trea-
ted me like I was a lunatic.

But six days later, Kacher walked back into town with his family in tow.

Curiously, their only recollection of the experience was the initial meeting 
with the aliens, who were shaped like human brains and floated in the air like
thick globs of smoke, Mrs. Kacher said.

When we suddenly found ourselves on the otskirts of town it was as if we had
awakened from a long and dreamless sleep, continued the woman.

We went directly to Rev. Marin and told him what happened, but he was as conf-
used as we were.

He told us that some things are not for men to understand.

He said the Loard works in mysterious ways.

Kacher pointed out that he feels better and healthier now than he did before
he died.

He does speak with a slight speech impediment that he didn't have before his
death, but he says, That's a small price to pay for my life.

I am rejuventated, he continued. But if you're asking me to explain what happ-
ened, I can't. for some reason, my life has been given back to me. Now it's
up to me to make the most of the time I have left.

Queried about the incident in a telephone interview, a spokesman for the Inst-
itute of UFO Research in Chattanooga called the family's experience a compell-
ing new chapter in the study of extraterrestrial intelligence.
