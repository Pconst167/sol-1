PART 2

The  Suffern Story: On October 7, 1975, a 27-year old  carpenter,
Robert  Suffern,  of Bracebridge, Ontario, got a  call  from  his
sister who had seen a "fiery glow" near his barn and concluded it
was  on  fire. Suffern drove to the spot and,  after  determining
that there was no problem, got back on the road. There, he  would
testify, he encountered a large disc-shaped object resting in his
path. "I was scared," he said. "It was right there in front of me
with  no  lights and no sign of life." But even  before  his  car
could  come to a complete stop, the object abruptly ascended  out
of sight. Suffern turned his car around and decided to head  home
rather  than  to  his  sister's  place,  his  original   intended
destination. At that point a small figure wearing a helmet and  a
silver-gray suit stepped in front of the car, causing Suffern  to
hit  the brakes and skid to a stop. The figure ran into a  field.
Then, according to Suffern, "when he got to the fence, he put his
hands  on a post and went over it with no effort at all.  It  was
like he was weightless" (UFOIL, n.d.).

 Within  two days Suffern's report was on the wire services,  and
Suffern   was   besieged  by  UFO   investigators,   journalists,
curiosity-seekers,  and  others. Suffern, who made no  effort  to
exploit his story and gave every appearance of believing what  he
was  saying, soon tired of discussing it. A year later,  however,
Suffern  and his wife told a Canadian investigator that  a  month
after  the encounter, they were informed that  some  high-ranking
officials  wished to speak with them. Around this time,  so  they
claimed,  they  were  given  thorough  examinations  by  military
doctors. After that an appointment was set up for December 12 and
on  that  day an Ontario Provincial Police cruiser  arrived  with
three  military officers, one Canadian, two American.  They  were
carrying books and other documents. In the long conversation that
followed,  the officers apologized for the UFO landing,  claiming
it   was  a  "mistake"  caused  by  the  malfunctioning   of   an
extraterrestrial spaceship.

 The  officers produced close-up pictures of UFOs, claiming  that
the  U.S. and Canadian governments had had intimate knowledge  of
aliens  since 1943 and were cooperating with them.  The  officers
even  knew  the  exact  dates  and  times  of  two  previous  but
unreported  UFO sightings on the Suffern property.  The  Sufferns
said  the  officers had answered all their  questions  fully  and
frankly,  but  they would not elaborate on what they  were  told.
Reinterviewed  about  the matter some months  later,  the  couple
stuck by their story but added few further details.

 The  investigator, Harry Tokarz, would remark,  "Robert  Suffern
strikes one as an individual who carefully measures his thoughts.
His  sincerity  comes through clearly as he  slowly  relates  his
concepts and ideas. His wife, a home-bred country girl, is  quick
to air her views and state unequivocally what she believes to  be
fact" (CUFORN, 1983).
