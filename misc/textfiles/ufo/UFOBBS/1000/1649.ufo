	One of the reasons I reject Ed Walters' claims regarding his
photographs of the Gulf Breeze object is the sheer NUMBER of
little controversies surrounding the photos and events there. One of
those controversies, of course, is the model that was found in Ed's
former residence. Ed has been very good at putting out fires, by
misdirecting people's attention to little details that would seem to
exonerate him. But now there is another controversy arising out of the
model, and that is the apparent attempt by someone to "go back in time"
and change the relevant evidence, or get rid of it altogether.

The evidence hinges on the house plans made by Ed Walters which appear
on the inside of the UFO model. Ed claims the plans were drawn up in
September of 1989, two years after his first UFO photos were made
public. But, according to Phil Klass' "Skeptics UFO Newsletter", July
1991 issue....

<<

It can now be revealed that in early January, 1987, Walters and Russ
McElhinney decided to build a a house "on speculation" at 712 Jamestown
Drive which would have a Living Area of 1740 sq. ft. and whose garage
entrance would be PARALLEL to the long dimension of the house -- as in
the UFO-model house plan. On Jan. 16, 1987, Walters and McElhinney filed
a building permit request with the Gulf Breeze City Hall and 12 days
later, on Jan. 28, they filed a building permit reqeust with Santa Rosa
County ... However, the Slab Area shown does NOT match the 2393 sq. ft.
visible on the UFO-model drawing.

But if one calculates the Slab Area for the Thomas house plan, it does
not total 2393 either. When I pointed this out to Maccabee, he replied
that "the term `slab area' does not mean just the area where there is
concrete slab. How Ed arrived at the [2393] number is a straightforward
caluclation for him, even though it may seem strange to you (and me)."
(The "Spec House" was never built. A short time later, Mr./Mrs. Gerald
Folkers contracted with Ed to build a somewhat different design at 712
Jamestown Drive.)

Soon after the small UFO-model was discovered, Ed Walters visited the
owners of his former residence to inspect the model they had found. A
short time later, Ed and his wife Frances visited City Hall to examine
house plans. Later it was discovered that the lower right corner of the
"spec" house drawing - where the Living Area and Slab Area figures
normally are shown - had been torn off by some "person unknown."

WHO WOULD HAVE ANY REASON TO VISIT THE GULF BREEZE CITY HALL AND TEAR
OFF THE CORNER OF THE "SPEC HOUSE" PLAN THAT SHOWED ITS LIVING/SLAB AREA
FIGURES? Several potential suspects come to mind: The KGB, The Pope,
Dolly Parton, Barbara Bush, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Saddam Hussein,
Donald Trump, and VP Dan Quayle. If you can think of any other possible
suspects, please submit name(s) to SUN.

I plan to scan the 1/28/87 building permit application into the system
and will distribute it. Again, not the smoking gun, but just another of
those "little controversies" that mar this case.

Note: This message originally appeared on ParaNet a few months ago. I'm
reposting it here because the controversy over the plans has come up here
recently and I wanted to try and clarify a few things.

  Hee hee!
  Also, I've been told that round about the same time, Gulf Breeze Mayor Ed
Grey visited the planning & zoning dept. (or whatever they call it) for the
very first time, all by himself. Unknown whether that was before or after the
Walters' visit.
