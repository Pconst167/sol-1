HUDSON - "They are here - whoever they are!"
     That's the message from researcher Bruce Maccabee about Unidentified Flying Objects that have been sighted throughout the world, including the Hudson Valley.
     A cililian employee of the U.S. Navy in physics research, Maccabee described his investigation of "The Gulf Breeze UFO Case" near Pensacola, Fla., when speaking Thursday night at Columbia-Greene Community College.
     Maccabee's talk centered on the UFO encounters and abductions of a Pensacola, Fla., couple near their home on the Gulf. Others in the Pensacola area also said they saw UFOs.
     He showed several photos taken by Ed and Francis Walters - some of which were published in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel newspaper. Maccabee said the photos taken by Walters, a contractor, indicated rotation of the object in the sky.
     "When you look inside it, you can't tell what it is or explain what's going on or how it is powered," he said.
     "When Walters went into the road outside his house to take photos he was engulfed in a blue mist as he raised his camera to take a photo," said Maccabee. "He reported feeling like he was frozen in concrete and couldn't move."
     Walters said he heard a "humming noise like mechanical winds heard mechanical words which said "don't be afraid, we won't hurt you." Maccabee said.
     Maccabee said Walters fell down in the street when hit with the blue beam, then was released. Walters estimated that he had been in the blue beam for about 10 seconds, and when he looked up saw nothing in the sky.
     Maccabee said Walters spoke about smelling a strange odor and explained that it had penetrated his nose while he was in the blue beam. He described it as a cinnamon-type odor.
     Walters said that he had felt sucked into the beam and wanted to alert the community so no children would be sucked into it and dissappear, Maccabee said. That prompted him to write a letter to the local newspaper about the UFO photos he had taken.
     When the photos were published, others in the community also said they had seen a sinilar object in the sky.
     Maccabee said Walters told him that after the first experience he would hear a humming noise in his head just before he saw another UFO.
     "When the UFO came back," said the investigator, "Walters received a communication in his head. They said that they had come for him, and that he should step forward and he would not be hurt."
     Maccabee said Walters and his wife had more experiences with the blue beam from the UFO when they again took photos. Once, Walters claimed the blue beam immobilized his leg while he was on a screen porch taking photos of the UFO.
     Maccabee said that Walters later saw an alien outside his home and had been abducted by the aliens with "missing time" involved.
     He said that under hyponosis Walters discovered he had been abducted several times by the aliens at the ages of 11, 17, 25, 33, and 42.
     Walters had UFO sightings in Gulf Breeze in 1987 and 1988 with the most recent one Sept. 12, 1989.
     Walters never got a photograph of one of the aliens. "The only photo taken of an alien that I know of was taken in England in 1986." Maccabee said.
     Maccabee said many people belive all UFO reports are hoaxes. Some UFO reports are actually other object in the sky that have been misidentified. Venus is often mistaken for a UFO, he said.
     But Maccabee said there are other "hard core reports," such as Walters', when people describe structural things seen in the sky.
     He described the encounters with aliens thaty Whitley Strieber, author of "Communion," reported at his Ulster County home near Accord. "Whitley was concerned over what happened to him and loads his books with his own speculation," Maccabee said.
     Strieber concluded "that there are vistors and that they do nasty things to people," Maccabee said.
     Maccabee also described the UFO investigations of Bub Hopkins, who wrote the book "Missing Time." He said Hopkins has a different approach and belives aliens are using people as guinea pigs.
     "There is speculation that there are genetic experiments and maybe inter-breeding going on with the aliens trying to learn something about our mental states," Maccabee said. "We do not know what it is all isfor. But it is not particularly amusing."
