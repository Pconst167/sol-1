SUBJECT: Alien Abductions by Dr Karla Turner                 FILE: UFO1018

PART 4
     
     An even more bizarre event happened to a woman in the Southwest
during her encounter.  She said she was "removed" from her body and
stored in some inexplicable way, still aware, however, and able to
communicate with her captors.  They told her that another entity was
now using her body, that it was going through all her regular
activities, and that no one would be able to tell the difference.
The day after the abduction when she returned to her job, she found
that her body had indeed been at work, even though she herself was
somewhere else.

'INTERDIMENSIONAL BEING'.

     These alien intruders apparently can behave and appear in a
variety of ways.  In one man's experience, a human-looking woman
often appeared, although she claimed she was an interdimensional
being whose real appearance was not what the abductee saw.  At times
she would be "completely there" and very three-dimensional, but at
other times only her head would be visible, or her head and hands.

     The evidence from several cases also shows that the aliens have
an odd interest in our animals, yet this is hardly mentioned in
standard abduction research.  During a period of intense ET activity
in my family's life, for instance, our dog was somehow moved one
night from a fenced back yard into a locked garage. And the same dog,
conversely, woke us up one morning barking in the back yard, when it
had been put in a locked garage the night before.  In both cases,
there was no sign that either the gate or the garage door had been
opened.  The old dog was quite blind, at any rate, and would have
had trouble getting anywhere, even if both passageways had been clear.

PET PUZZLER.

     Transporting dogs turned up again in the case of a UFO
researcher. Her dog slept outside, yet in the middle of the night
she was awakened by his wet tongue on her face.  She and the dog
were in her bed, but her bedroom door was still locked, as was the
outside door, and there were two other doors closed in between them.

     Horses also have been moved, leaving their abductee-owners to
track them down in corrals far distant from where the animals had
been locked away for the night.  It's hard to imagine the purpose of
such events, yet they are part of the larger phenomenon and must
have some relevance.

     There also seems to be a connection between abductions and the
disappearance or appearance of possessions and other objects. One of
the more humorous episodes occurred when a researcher was visiting
another city and staying as a guest in our home.  The day had been
spent in work with other abductees, and that evening the group
ordered Chinese food.


PREFERRED UTENSILS APPEAR.

     As we sat eating the food, the researcher remarked that she
preferred eating Chinese food with chopsticks, but we didn't have any.
After the meal, the researcher went to her room then returned moments
later with a very puzzled expression.  "I thought you didn't have any
chopsticks," she told my husband. "And I certainly didn't mean for
you to go out and buy them!  But thank you anyway for being so
thoughtful." She held out a pair of chopsticks wrapped in paper and
smiled.
     "Where did you get those?" he asked in amazement.
     "They were on my bed," she replied.  "Didn't you put them there?"
     "Of course not!" he exclaimed.  "There aren't--weren't--any
chopsticks in the house, I promise you.  And I haven't gone anywhere!"
     Other objects have appeared out of nowhere, such as metal balls
falling from abductees' bodies when they rose from their beds the
morning after an encounter.  In another instance, a mother saw what
looked like a white book floating horizontally in her son's bedroom,
but when she went in, there was no book to be seen.  In one
abductee's home, a fish disappeared from their aquarium, and then it
reappeared ten days later, twice as large as it had been.  Within 24
hours, however, it died, as did all the other fish in the tank.

WOMEN IN DISTRESS.

     Perhaps the most remarkable and disturbing set of cases
concerned two women I know but who are unacquainted with each other.
The first woman awoke one morning to find her bed soaked with blood.
It was during her menstrual cycle, yet she was surprised to have bled
so profusely as to soak through the tampon she had inserted before
going to bed.  When she went to the bathroom to clean up, she could
find no tampon to remove. Frantically she searched her bed, the
bedroom, and finally her entire apartment, but the tampon had
disappeared.  A few days later, she related the incident to me, but
neither of us knew what to make of it.

     A month passed, and I received a call from the second woman, who
lived far away from me.  She was perplexed by an event of the
previous night and wanted to tell someone about it.  This woman was
having her menstrual cycle also, and the night before had put on a
sanitary pad before going to bed.  Several hours later, she woke up
and decided to go change the pad, as she was an unusually heavy
bleeder.  In surprise, however, she found the pad was spotless, and
then she felt something inside her.  She told me that she removed
the tampon, but couldn't understand how it had gotten there.  "I
haven't used tampons in ten years," she said, "so this doesn't make
any sense."

ANOMALIES IN 'TYPICAL' REPORTS.

     Anomalies have turned up in some cases that might otherwise seem
to follow the "typical" abduction sequence of going into the "ship,"
undergoing an examination and being returned with little or no memory.
Sometimes, for instance, the surroundings in the "ship" are described
as messy or dirty, with foul odors and signs of sloppy housekeeping.
Sometimes the interior is said to be crowded, buzzing with numerous
entities engaged in rapid, inexplicable movements from place to place.

     Even more unusual are those accounts of abductions to inner space
rather than outer space.  In these cases, abductees tell of being
taken into large underground complexes, and their descriptions very
often include earthly--perhaps military-- apparatus as well as the
presence of both humans and aliens working together.  These
underground areas are reached through long vertical or corkscrewing
tunnels, the abductees say, and in one case the place looked like a
movie set of an old Western town.

'BATHROOM SETTINGS'.

     A third anomalous episode, which may have taken place aboard a
craft or in an underground setting, involves abductees taken into
"bathroom" settings.  There they are made to get into "stalls" with or
without toilets, and in most cases the abductees are thoroughly
frightened by the events that occur in these surroundings, often
having to do with examination of their sexual organs.

     Most of these anomalous details have come from a relatively
small group of abductees, yet similar cases are known elsewhere. In
the instance of the odd scar, which began this discussion, there are
cases of the triangular pattern turning up all over the world, yet no
prominent researcher has acknowledged this.  The scoop marks and
straight-line cuts are well known, but just as frequent are less
permanent scars and marks.  Single, double and multiple puncture marks
appear on abductees' bodies, as do wide paths of subcutaneous purplish
smears, triangles and other shapes made by skin discoloration rather
than punctures, and long claw- mark scratches, usually numerous,
accompanied by even longer welts of unbroken skin.

CHALLENGE TO 'POSITIVE' THEORIES.

     As to researchers who claim that the ETs are here to help us
evolve some higher consciousness or that they are here for some
other positive purpose--saving our plant, promoting world peace,
etc.--I challenge those researchers to incorporate anomalous data
into this view.

     What about those people who suffer total breakdowns after their
experiences?  What about those who undergo wild personality changes,
who find themselves obsessed with deviant sexual behavior they never
had before, often leading to the breakup of marriages and friendships?
These things have happened numerous times, but no researcher has yet
explained the higher purpose behind such results.

     Particularly disturbing are those cases where previously healthy
individuals have an ET encounter and then develop debilitating or
terminal illnesses.  It is well known that many women suffer
gynecological problems after their experiences, often leading to
hysterectomies.  But other instances have shown the development of
severe fatigue, horrible swelling and itching, and even cancer.
Where are the positive effects in these cases?

     Theories are starting places for research, not proven
conclusions, and UFO researchers must be willing to expand and alter
their pet theories according to the data they uncover.  It would be
wonderful if we could shape ET experiences into something positive,
but until the details of abduction encounters--all the details--are
given serious consideration, I think it's dangerous to cling to
theories that ignore data that will not fit.  We owe it to ourselves
to seek the whole truth.
