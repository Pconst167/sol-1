In The Beginning....
A Beginners Guide to UFOlogy
By Gayle Nesom

This new column, an introduction to the basics on the UFO phenomenon, 
is for newcomers to ufology. A relative newcomer to the subject myself, I 
am still trying to learn the basics, and I have lots of questions. The answers 
I am most interested in are those based on fact. Naturally, I am curious 
about other people's viewpoints and their reasons for them, but in general, I 
want to be able to form my own opinions.
Thus, the main goals of this column are to present the basics and, in the 
process, distinguish between fact and opinion. I also hope that the column 
will represent a different perspective and give other newcomers to HUFON 
a voice in the organization. My own limited exposure to the field will no 
doubt color what I write, so your comments and corrections are sincerely 
welcome.     

UFO Resources:

Sources for UFO information abound. Whatever your particular interest, 
there's probably an organization or publication for you. I thought it would 
be appropriate to begin this column by describing what's available for those 
who want to learn more and get more involved. The annotated list below is 
not complete, of course, but it does cover some of the best known 
organizations and periodicals, as well as various other resources. I will 
update the list from time to time, and I welcome your input.

Houston UFO Network
P.O.Box 942, Bellaire,TX 77042-0942
Founded 1988; $30/year
Publication (monthly): HUFON Report
Serving the greater Houston area, HUFON strives to disseminate UFO 
information, investigate local UFO sightings and abduction reports, and to 
provide lively monthly public meetings that both inform and entertain. 
HUFON's newsletter is one of the best in the field, featuring several 
"scoops" before national publications (submissions are invited).  



Mutual UFO Network
103 Oldtowne Rd. Sequin, TX 78115.
Founded 1969; $25/year.
Publication (monthly): MUFON Journal.
MUFON, which bills itself as "the world's largest UFO organization," is 
headquartered in Texas just south of San Antonio. For your membership, 
you get an interesting publication and a broader look at ufology than 
membership in a local organization can provide. The letters in the journal 
are full of caustic comments that provides a look at the controversy and 
dissension that is prevalent among UFO buffs and authorities.

Citizens Against UFO Secrecy
3518 Martha Custis Ave., Alexandria, Virginia 22302 or P.O. Box 218, 
Coventry, CT 06238.
Founded 1978; $15/year.
Publication: Just Cause (published sporadically).
CAUS, as it is sometimes known, battles what the organization perceives 
as unjustified government secrecy in relation to UFOs, working through 
the Freedom of Information Act and other legal channels. One court case 
(CAUS vs. NASA) reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980. CAUS has 
obtained thousands of pages of government documents that were previously 
unavailable to the public. If you are interested in the government cover-up, 
this is the group for you.

Fund for UFO Research
P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20712.
Founded 1974; associated with CAUS.
The Fund is a nonprofit organization that, like CAUS, is interested in the 
government's involvement in and cover-up of the UFO phenomenon. The 
Fund is currently pursuing the Roswell case and since 1990 has spent more 
than $50,000 on its ongoing investigation. Instead of a journal or 
newsletter, communication is a monthly letter from the director. Like 
Amnesty International, the Fund periodically mails out model letters for 
supporters to use in lobbying congressmen and senators. A contribution of 
$50 will get you a copy of the Fund's latest video of interviews with more 
than 30 witnesses to the Roswell incident.

J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies
2457 W. Peterson Ave., Chicago, IL 60659.
Founded 1974; $25/year.
Publications: International UFO Reporter (bimonthly) and Journal for UFO 
Studies (annual).
CUFOS was founded by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who coined the phrase "close 
encounters of the third kind" (and acted as technical advisor to director 
Steven Spielberg in the movie of the same name). Dr. Hynek, who died in 
1986, was professor of astronomy at Northwestern University, serving for 
many years as chairman of that department and director of the Dearborn 
Observatory. For 22 years he was chief scientific consultant on UFOs to the 
U. S. Air Force. (Dr. Hynek's 1972 book, The UFO Experience: A 
Scientific Inquiry, is an excellently written scientific analysis of the UFO 
phenomenon.) CUFOS serves as a clearinghouse for a two-way exchange 
of information where UFO experiences can be reported and researched. 
The organization also maintains one of the world's largest repositories of 
UFO data. In addition to the two journals, CUFOS also offers books, 
audiocassette tapes, and videos.

Canadian UFO Research Network
P.O. Box 15, Station A, Willowdale, Ontario, M2N 5S7, Canada.
This is one of at least four national UFO organizations in Canada. I also 
have addresses for organizations in at least 15 other countries. If you are 
looking for one in particular, get in touch with me at a meeting.

UFO Newsclipping Service
Route 1, Box 220, Plumerville, AR 72127.
Since 1969; $55/year.
The service sends 20-page monthly reports containing the latest U.S. and 
Canadian UFO newsclippings and a foreign section carrying British, 
Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is 
a three- to five-page section of Fortean clippings. A different news service 
is the UFO Reporting and Information Service, P.O. Box 832, Mercer 
Island, WA 98040.

Fortean Times
SKS, 20 Paul St., Frome, Somerset, BA11 1DX, U.K.
This is a quarterly journal of news and reviews about all sorts of strange 
phenomenon, including UFOs. The publication's name comes from Charles 
Fort (1874-1932), who was interested in the strange and unusual.

Flying Saucer Review
FSR Publications, Ltd., P.O. Box 162, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, 
HP13 5DZ, U.K.
FSR is one of the leading journals on UFOs and is reportedly subscribed to 
by a number of governmental bodies worldwide.

Arcturus Book Service

integrity of various UFO groups. Join and subscribe at your own risk, take 
what you read with a grain of salt, and form your own opinions!
