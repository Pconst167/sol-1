`UFO lands in Milan?'

Flattened corn mystifies farmer
By Trish Mehaffey
Staff writer

 The hazy morning sunlight brightened the field, but James Lawson
couldn't shake the eerie feeling that struck him when he spotted the
circular imprint in his cornfield Tuesday.
 Within the circle, the stalks were flattened neatly in rows following
a visible clockwise pattern. The stalks appeared to have been mashed
down. There was no evidence of cutting or signs of machines or humans
in the circle area.
Mr. Lawson reported the circle was measured this morning and was found
to be a perfect 46-foot diameter circle.
 ``It was about 9 (a.m),'' Mr. Lawson, of rural Milan, said. ``I was
just making my first trip (on a combine) through the field. ``The
first thing I thought of was a UFO (unidentified flying object). I
thought, holy smokes, what is this?''
 That's the same question being asked in hundreds of other spots
around the world where the mysterious crop circles have been spotted.
 Mr. Lawson, 70, said he didn't see the perfect 40- to 50-foot circle
until he was right next to it. The circle, in a field near the corner
of Andalusia and Turkey Hollow roads, is hidden from the highway.
 ``It feels weird. There's no road coming in. I couldn't imagine what
it was. It's like a racetrack or something. You can't see it from the
(Andalusia) road. It could have been here quite awhile, but the ears
are still on the stalks. Maybe it's been a month or so.''
 ``When I went in to tell my wife, she didn't believe me. She said
`You're goofy.' And I knew you'd (news media) be skeptical.''

Part 2 of Ufo Lands in Milan?

Can't explain circle


 Mr. Lawson, who has farmed for 42 years, couldn't explain the circle.
He didn't believe it was a hoax, but wasn't quite ready to accept the
idea of UFOs.
 ``It couldn't have been the wind because the dike would have stopped
it. And it's a perfect circle. The stalks are mashed in perfect rows.
Maybe it was a UFO that made the circle when it landed and then took
off,'' he said laughing.
 Rock Island County Sheriff Mike Grchan said his investigators were at
the scene Tuesday afternoon, but didn't find any answers.
 ``The investigators tend to believe someone did it,'' Mr. Grchan
said. ``They found some footprints, but Mr. Lawson said the prints
weren't there earlier and others had been at the scene since the
morning. Other than that, it's totally unexplainable. It could have
been the wind or a meteor, but there would have been a hole and there
wasn't.''
 Mr. Grchan said his office probably won't pursue the incident unless
another circle appears in the area.
 Mr. Lawson isn't alone in his curiosity. People have been doing
research on the mysterious crop field rings since one was sighted in
1976 when a farm worker in Hampshire, England, discovered a circular
pattern in his field.
 Since 1980, more than 600 similar circles have been reported in
Britain with about 250 recorded in 1989.
