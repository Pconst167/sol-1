REPORTS of unidentfied flying objects in South Cheshire and North Staffordshire have soared over the last 12 months.
     Officials at the Cheshire UFO Studies Centre in Earle Street, Crewe, received 120 calls on their 24-hour hotline-and increase of 20 per cent.

                    MYSTERY

     Most of the sightings concerned mystery lights in the night sky over the Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford areas.
     Investigations by experts from the centre have ruled out 95 per cent of the lights as UFOs-most of them being traced to aircraft or satellites.
     But they are still engaged in a six-month inquiry after two separate callers reported a close encounter with a 35ft "bright object with a glowing centre" which landed in a field near Audlem-and then vanished.
     Centre chairman Mr. Eric Morris said:  "most of the people who call us are genuine, and many are worried or frightened by what they have seen.

                 STRANGE

     "After onquiries with the RAF, the Ministry of Defence, airports and interviewing witnesses, we can explain about 95 per cent of the strange things people see-but there are still the rest which remain a mystery."
     The centre is to launch a magazine recording all its reports of Ufos, its investigations into each incident and conclusions.
