                                      and the
                                 Indian Rope Trick

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the book,  "Beyond  Telepathy", Dr. Andrija Puharich recounts his
       experience with an Indian fakir.   Also  present at the event were a
       colleague and several hundred other witnesses.

       A rope is cast up into the air where it remains suspended  yet  with
       no visible means of support.

       A small boy  goes  up  the  rope  followed  by  an  apparently angry
       magician wielding a knife.

       Both magician and boy seem to vanish at the top of the rope. Screams
       are then heard, followed by a grisly rain of dismembered parts.

       The magician reappears at the top  of  the rope and climbs back down
       holding a bloody knife.  He then places the bloody  parts  in a box,
       closes the lid  and within moments the boy emerges smiling and whole
       with no apparent damage.

       In some performances, witnesses see a dog run off with an arm or
       leg which of course has to be recovered.

       Puharich and his colleague saw the magician collect the parts of the
       boy in a basket, go back up the rope and return with the boy whole.

       All during this  spectacle,  pictures   were  taken  to  record  the
       phenomena.  When the film was developed, the fakir and boy were seen
       to be standing impassively by the rope lying coiled on the floor.

       Puharich concludes that the

          "hallucination was telepathically inspired and  extended  to  the
           several hundred people present."

       In 1934, the  Rope  trick  was  performed  in London on two separate
       occasions.  When the film from concealed  cameras was developed, the
       rope was seen to remain lying on the ground while  the  boy  sneaked
       off to hide in the bushes.

       Witnesses to the  event  were  seeing  scenes which did not actually
       occur in reality, but the mental projections  of  someone skilled in
       the art of either hypnosis or extreme concentration with the ability

                                      Page 1





       to telepathically project what they visualized.

       A variation on the Rope trick was witnessed in French West Africa by
       William Seabrook in 1930.

         "There were  two living children close to me.  I touched them with
          my hands.   And  equally  close  were  the  two  men  with  their
          swords....iron, three-dimensional,  metal, cold  and  hard.   And
          this is  what I now SAW with my eyes, but you will understand why
          I am reluctant to tell of it, and  that I do not know what SEEING
          means.

          Each man, holding his sword stiffly upward with  his  left  hand,
          tossed a  child  high  in  the air with his right, then caught it
          full upon the point.....No blood flowed....

          The crowd screamed now, falling  to its knees.  Many veiled their
          eyes with their hands, others fell prostrate.  Through  the crowd
          the jugglers  marched,  each  bearing a child aloft, IMPALED UPON
          HIS SWORD...

          ...and disappeared into the witchdoctor's enclosure."

       Seabrook later saw and touched the  children,  who seemed completely
       undamaged by their  ordeal.   Few  illusions  can be  so  arrogantly
       paraded through a disbelieving crowd.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Recent conversations with our friend Larry B. yielded an interesting
       story.

       Loosely told, our  friend said he knew a hypnotist who went to India
       to study the fakirs and prove that  neither  mesmerism  or hypnotism
       could be used  to  influence the actions or perceptions  of  another
       WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT or them being consciously aware of it.

       On docking, the  hypnotist was wandering around the dock when he met
       a small, kindly Indian man.  A discussion  led to the purpose of the
       visit.  The hypnotist was looking at the Indian and  stating that he
       was absolutely certain  the NO ONE COULD BE INFLUENCED against their
       knowledge or without being aware of it.

       As he spoke, a storm began to blow  in.   The  clouds  grew dark and
       ominous and the wind began to rage.  People were  being  blown  down
       and into the  water  while  boats  were  tossed around as if made of
       balsa wood.

       The hypnotist grew rather alarmed  at  what was happening around him
       and on looking  back  at  the  Indian, he noticed  a  kindly  smile.
       INSTANTLY, all signs  of  a  storm disappeared to reveal a perfectly
       clear day as if NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AT ALL.

       Needless to say,   the  stunned  hypnotist   actively   sought   the
       instruction of this unusual Indian.  Further exploits  involved  the
       introduction of the hypnotist to an Indian fakir.

       Discussions with the  fakir  came  to the inevitable point of proof.
       At that time the hypnotist saw the man pick up a flower pot and dash

                                      Page 2




       it against the corner of the room where it broke in many pieces.

       The fakir then  told  the  hypnotist  that an illusion could best be
       broken or avoided  by anything which  focuses  concentration.   This
       could be a  sensation  such  as  pain,  or intense concentration  on
       something which you know, without doubt to be true.

       The hypnotist was  told  to  select  such  a  fact at which he chose
       2+2=4.  The fakir instructed him to  continue to concentrate on that
       fact by repeating it over and over.

       As the hypnotist  carried out these simple instructions,  he  looked
       over at the corner where the broken flower pot was lying.

       To his amazement, there was nothing there.  On turning to the fakir,
       he saw the  flower  pot  held in the fakir's hand as if it had never
       been thrown.

       He was confused momentarily which caused him to break concentration,
       As this occurred, the flower pot in  the  man's hand disappeared and
       reappeared broken in the corner just as it had been  "thrown" in the
       beginning.

       On again focussing  his  concentration  on 2+2=4, the flower pot was
       restored in the fakir's hand.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Another story involved the witnessing  of  the  rope trick.  The man
       observing the event was quite taken up in the unfolding  drama  when
       he suddenly felt a sharp sting at the base of his neck.

       When the sting  occurred,  he  slapped at it and again looked toward
       the fakir and his assistant.  To  his  amazement,  the fakir and the
       boy were seen to be sitting quite still with the rope at their side.

       The crowd was  collectively looking into the air as  if  the  entire
       drama was continuing.

       Much of the  above  is unverifiable, however, there seems to be some
       basic observations here which do follow the premises of MIND1, MIND2
       and other mind control information.   We would be most interested in
       any information you might have on this subject.
