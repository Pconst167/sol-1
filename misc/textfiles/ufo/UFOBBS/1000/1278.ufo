HOW THE UFO SIGHTINGS HAVE AFFECTED SOME PEOPLE

A FIRST HAND GLIMPSE OF THE UFO

By Susan Stockman

     RAINSVILLE-Up until this past week,  I had only a reporters'
interest  in  the  UFO sightings which have taken  place  in  and
around Fyffe.
     I reported the stories and events,  took pictures and talked
with  people who had actually spotted the object.   I made  phone
calls  to various military bases,  talked to the world's  leading
skeptic  on  the  UFO  phenomenon and interviewed  a  person  who
believed  he  had  actually  had  an  encounter  with  an   alien
spaceship, not this time around, but previously.
     All  this was done strictly as part of my job as a  reporter
for the Weekly Post.  I had no personal interest.  I believed the
people who had sighted objects were actually seeing something,  I
just didn't know what.
     My  business  interest suddenly changed to a  more  personal
nature Wednesday night,  March 8,  when I saw the object that has
received so much attention.   As a bad as they were,  I made some
pictures.
     As  I  got a small taste of what others had been  getting  a
large dose of, my curiosity of the object grew.
     That next night Teri Baker,  co-owner and general manager of
the  Weekly Post,  and I decided to go back to Fyffe in hopes  of
getting  better  pictures.   That was,  if the object decided  to
reappear.
     We  were  fortunate enough,  and I use  the  word  fortunate
literally,  to  see  the  object again.   Teri made a  series  of
pictures of the movement of the object,  and, just for reference,
made  a  picture  of  an airplane  using  the  same  photographic
techniques.   That  set of pictures appear in today's edition  of
the Weekly Post.
     We still do not know what the object is but we do know  that
it  doesn't  move like any airplane we,  or anyone else  we  have
talked to, knows about.
     Teri's  pictures  were made with a Canon 35mm  camera,  shot
with  the  shutter wide open and a two-minute  exposure  time  to
allow enough lights in for the horizon to be visible.
     The  pictures  show the object moving slightly in  that  two
minute  time  span.   They also show the airplane to  have  moved
about  10 times as far.   One thing I need to mention is the fact
that  there  was only a silver of a moon  out  that  night.   The
pictures show what seems to be a full moon,  but that is only the
result of the time-lapse photography.
     When word of the photographs spread,  the media descended on
us  like people trailing into Fyffe on a Friday night.   We  were
literally  besieged  by television stations,  radio stations  and
newspapers  from all across the country.   We didn't tell a  soul
that  we  had made the pictures.   We still don't know  how  they
found  out.   They  were calling Teri at 7:30 the  next  morning,
wanting interviews or copies of the pictures.
     After a full week of doing interviews with those news crews,
both local and national,  and talking to what seemed like a  half
million interested individuals,  both in person and on the phone,
I  wondered  what  was the reaction of the other people  who  had
sighted the object.
     I  talked to as many of them as I could round up Monday  and
Tuesday.   Most said the same thing.   That they were  constantly
dealing  with reporters looking for a story,  just like I was  in
the beginning.
     Although  many residents have reported sightings,  the  ones
who  have  received the most attention are  Donna  Saylor,  Kathy
Green,  Jill Worley, her sister Rhonda Gipson, Fyffe Police Chief
Junior Garmany and assistant chief Fred Works.
     I  tried to call each of them to see what effect this  event
has had on their day-to-day lives.
     Saylor said,  "There are a lot of interruptions in my day by
the  press.   I  have had calls from as far away as  England.   I
really don't mind talking to the people, but when the people from
'Inside  Edition' aired the program like they did,  I was  really
put  out,  I gave those people four hours of my time and  it  was
wasted.   After  the  show aired,  I decided not to do  any  more
interviews."
     Saylor  said  the  only thing she regretted  was  using  the
description  "it was curved like a banana."  She said if she  had
it  to do over again,  she would have used another description of
the object.
     Kathy  Green said the only change in her day-to-day  routine
was  that people were always asking her what it is like  and  how
she felt when she saw the UFO.
     "I  really  don't find it a bother to talk to these  people.
It's  exciting.   Life  really hasn't changed  much  around  here
except  that I am now more aware of what's up in the sky,"  Green
said.
     Fyffe  assistant police chief Fred Works indicated that  the
"only way it has affected my life is my job.  I have to talk to a
lot more people now than I did before."
     Fyffe Police Chief Junior Garmany said,  "Basically, it goes
with  this line of work.   We are always dealing with the  media.
But,  this  has  been slightly out of  the  normal.   We're  just
sitting back and waiting for things to get back to normal."
     I could not reach Jill Worley or her sister Rhonda Gipson.
     As for Teri and myself,  it is getting a little easier to go
about our day-to-day activities.   Friday, we could not even work
for having to answer the telephone or talk to news crews.
     It  has  been  a  learning  experience  for  me.    Being  a
reporter,  I  am accustomed to asking the questions and doing the
interviewing.  It has been difficult to be the one interviewed.
     All  the people I talked to who reported the sightings agree
on one thing.  that given the same set of circumstances, we would
have spoken out about what we saw.
     The  people  have the right to know what is going on in  the
sky above.  Now, if we just knew.
