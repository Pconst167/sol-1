FENSIVE FORCES WILL BEGIN. ‘HISDEPLOYMENT SHOULD BE DONE IN A NEARINSTANTANEOUS MANNER UNDER CERTAINSPECIAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED

 THE INTERVALTHAT THE SYSTEM IS POWERED UP.10)◊HEN THE WEAPON IS USED IN ONESPECIFI POWER MODE, IN ADDITION TOCONTINUOUS DISCHARGE ON THE DI
SKS THATARE AIRBORNE AND THE GROUND BASEDWEAPONS, THE MIND CONFUSION ANDDISORIENTATION WILL BUILD IN THOSEPERSONNEL AT THE BASE AND UNDERGRO
UND.   ¡T THE END OF FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS ORLESS, ALL OF THEIR WEAPONS SHOULD BETOTALLY DISCHARGED AND THE POWERSHOULD BE OUT ON THE BASES. ÕO
STPERSONNEL, IF FNOT ALL, SHOULD BE TOTALLY INCAPACITATED. ∆EEDINGFORMULA PRODUCTION WILL BE DOWN ANDCRITICAL PROCESSING RUINED. ¡LL EMBRYOS
 SHOULD BE DEAD AND ALL OXYGENAND HYDROGEN CONSUMABLES SHOULD BEDEPLETED. 11) ¬ASED UPON DATA GATHERED ON THEPROTOTYPE WEAPONS, THE FULL POW
ERWEAPONS SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM HOLDINGOFF THE DISKS. …N MANY CASES SOME WILLBREAK WITHIN THE FIRST FORTY-EIGHT HOURSWITHOUT BEING DIRECTLY

UMMARY *****--------------------------------------- …T IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MY INITIALIMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPUTERCOMMUNICATIONS WAS 
NOT INSTIGATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF TALKING TO ONE OF THEALIENS 'FOR THE FUN OF IT', BUT WASDELIBERATELY INSTIGATED TO USE AS ATOOL TO STUDY, 
IN DEPTH, THE ALIENS ON A LONG TERM BASIS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION, ANDTO DETERMINE POSSIBLE STRENGTHS ANDWEAKNESSES. ‘HE
 WEAPON THEORY AND PROTOTYPES WEREBUILT TO CAPITALIZE UPON AND TEST THETWO À≈Ÿ AND PROMINENT WEAKNESSES THATWERE DISCOVERED. ‘HIS IN-HOUSE F
UNDEDPROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPENSIVE, IN EXCESSOF $200,000; ON BEHALF OF OUR NATIONAND HANDLED IN THE BEST REPRESENTATIVEMANNER HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
 (1) ‘HE –“…Õ≈ AND WEAKEST AREA THATWAS DISCOVERED, PROBED AND TESTED ISEXACTLY WHAT THE ALIENS ASSUMED WASTHEIR KEY STRENGTH - THAT BEING T
HEMANIPULATION OF AND CONTROL OF THEMIND. (2) ‘HOUGH THEIR SHIPS SEEM RATHERFORMIDABLE, THEY ALSO HAVE WEAKNESSES,SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR ME
THOD ANDUNIQUE MODE OF FLIGHT.-------------------------------------  …T IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORTTO IMPLY THAT THE OVERALL PROBLEM W
ILLBE SOLVED WITH THE CAPTURE OF THESEBASES. œBVIOUSLY IT WILL NOT, BUT ITIS A FIRMLY BASED BEGINNING WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF RATED PROJECTED 
SUCCESS.  …T IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF ALIEN ANDTHEIR HUMANOID WORKERS WILL NOT FIGHT;THEY MAY FIGHT, BUT THE
IR INCLINATIONIS GENERALLY THE OPPOSITE. ‘HIS BASINGAREA IS THE À≈Ÿ. ◊ITHOUT IT, THEIRMISSION IS IN VERY DEEP TROUBLE. …T ISNOTED THAT THESE
 ARE NOT THE ONLY BASES ON EARTH- THERE ARE OTHERS. ◊ITH ACONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE USING TYPICALLOGICAL SUPPORT NUMBERS, IT IS NOTUNREALISTIC T
O SAY THAT THERE ARE50,000 ALIENS WITHIN THE ECOSPHERE OFEARTH AND THE SPACE NEAR IT.   ”OME OF US WILL BE LOST IN THEENDEAVOR. ‘HAT IS OBVI
OUS. ‘HE À≈Ÿ TOOVERALL SUCCESS IS THEY THE ALIENS‘œ‘¡ÃÃŸ RESPECT ∆œ“√≈. ¡ND WITH THEM,THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD IS TO STUBBORNLY CONTINUE TO
