NOTE....Many sources of information were used to research
this paper.  Most of this knowledge comes directly from or is
a result of my own research into the TOP SECRET/MAJIC
material which I personally saw and read between the years
1970 and 1973 as a member of the Intelligence Briefing Team
of the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.  Since some
of this information was derived from sources that I cannot
divulge for obvious reasons, and from published sources which
I personally cannot vouch for, this paper must be treated as
a hypothesis.  Although, I firmly believe that this is the
true nature of the Beast.  It is the only scenario that has
been able to cohesively bind all the diverse elements which
have been driving researchers to tears in their quest for
answers.  It is the only scenario that answers all the
questions and places the various fundamental mysteries in an
arena that makes sense.  It is the only explanation which
shows the chronology of events and shows that the different
chronologies when assembled together match perfectly.  The
bulk of this I know to be true.  As for the rest I do not
know and that is why this paper must be termed a hypothesis

During the years following World War II the government of the
United States was confronted with a series of events which
were to change beyond prediction its future and with it the
future of humanity.  These events were so incredible that
they defied belief.  A stunned President Truman and his top
Military Commanders found themselves virtually impotent after
having just won the most devastating and costly war in
history.  The United States had developed, used, and was the
only nation on earth in possession of the Atomic Bomb which
alone had the potential to destroy any enemy, and even the
Earth itself.  At that time the United States had the best
economy, the most advanced technology, the highest standard
of living, exerted the most influence, and fielded the
largest and most powerful military forces in history.  We can
only imagine the confusion and concern when the informed
elite of the United States Government discovered that an
alien spacecraft piloted by insect-like beings from a totally
incomprehensible culture had crashed in the desert of New
Mexico.

Between January 1947 and December 1952 at least 16 crashed or
downed alien craft, 65 alien bodies, and 1 live alien were
recovered.  An additional alien craft had exploded and
nothing was recovered from that incident.  Of these
incidents, 13 occurred within the borders of the United
States not including the craft which disintegrated in the
air.  Of these 13, 1 was in Arizona, 11 were in New Mexico,
and 1 was in Nevada.  Three occurred in foreign countries.
Of those 1 was in Norway, and the last 2 were in Mexico.
Sightings of UFOS were so numerous that serious investigation
and debunking of each report became impossible utilizing the
existing intelligence assets.

An alien craft was found on February 13, 1948 on a Mesa near
Aztec New Mexico.  Another craft was located on March 25,
1948 in Hart Canyon near Aztec New Mexico.  It was 100 feet
in diameter.  A total of 17 alien bodies were recovered from
those two craft.  Of even greater significance was the
discovery of a large number of human body parts stored within
both of these vehicles.  A demon had reared its ugly head and
paranoia quickly took hold of everyone then 'in the know'.
The Secret lid immediately became an Above Top Secret lid and
was screwed down tight.  The security blanket was even
tighter than that imposed upon the Manhattan Project.  In the
coming years these events were to become the most closely
guarded secrets in the history of the world.

A special group of America's top scientists were organized
under the name Project Sign in December of 1947 to study the
phenomenon.  The whole nasty business was contained within
the shroud of secrecy.  Project Sign evolved into Project
Grudge in December of 1948.  A low level collection and
disinformation project named Blue Book was formed under
Grudge.  16 volumes were to come out of Grudge including the
controversial "Grudge 13" which I and Bill English saw, read,
and revealed to the public.  "Blue Teams" were put together
to recover the crashed discs and dead or alive aliens.  The
Blue Teams were later to evolve into Alpha Teams under
Project Pounce.

During these early years the United States Air Force and the
Central Intelligence Agency exercised complete control over
the Alien Secret.  In fact the CIA was formed by Presidential
Executive Order first as the Central Intelligence Group for
the express purpose of dealing with the alien presence.
Later the National Security Act was passed establishing it as
the Central Intelligence Agency.  The National Security
Council was established to oversee the intelligence community
and especially the alien endeavor.  A series of National
Security Council Memos and Executive Orders removed the CIA
from the sole task of gathering foreign intelligence and
slowly but thoroughly 'legalized' direct action in the form
of covert activities at home and abroad.

On December 9, 1947 Truman approved issuance of NSC-4,
entitled "Coordination of Foreign Intelligence Information
Measures" at the urging of Secretaries Marshall, Forrestal,
Patterson, and the director of the State Department's Policy
Planning Staff, Kennan.

The Foreign and Military Intelligence, Book 1, "Final Report
of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities." United States Senate,
94th Congress, 2nd Session, Report No. 94-755, April 26,
1976, p. 49 states:  "This directive empowered the secretary
of state to coordinate overseas information activities
designed to counter communism.  A top secret annex to NSC-4,
NSC-4A, instructed the director of Central Intelligence to
undertake covert psychological activities in pursuit of the
aims set forth in NSC-4.  The initial authority given the CIA
for covert operations under NSC-4A did not establish formal
procedures for either coordinating or approving these
operations.  It simply directed the DCI to "undertake covert
actions and to ensure, through liaison with State and
Defense, that the resulting operations were consistent with
American policy."

Later NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 were to supersede NSC-4 and NSC-
4A and expand the covert abilities even further.  The Office
of Policy Coordination (OPC) was chartered to carry out an
expanded program of covert activities.  NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2
validated illegal and extra-legal practices and procedures as
being agreeable to the national security leadership.  The
reaction was swift.  In the eyes of the intelligence
community "no holds were barred".  Under NSC-10/1 an
Executive Coordination Group, was established to review, but
not approve, covert project proposals.  The ECG was secretly
tasked to coordinate the alien projects.  NSC-10/1 & /2 were
interpreted to mean that no one at the top wanted to know
about anything until it was over and successful.  These
actions established a buffer between the President and the
information.  It was intended that this buffer serve as a
means for the President to deny knowledge if leaks divulged
the true state of affairs.  This buffer was used in later
years for the purpose of effectively isolating succeeding
Presidents from any knowledge of the alien presence other
than what the Secret Government and the intelligence
community wanted them to know.  NSC-10/2 established a study
panel which met secretly and was made up of the scientific
minds of the day.  The study panel was not called MJ-12.
Another NSC memo, NSC-10/5 further outlined the duties of the
study panel.  these NSC memos and secret Executive Orders set
the stage for the creation of MJ-12 only 4 years later.

Secretary of Defense James Forrestal began to object to the
secrecy.  He was a very idealistic and religious man who
believed that the public should be told.  When he began to
talk to leaders of the opposition party and leaders of the
Congress about the alien problem he was asked to resign by
Truman.  He expressed his fears to many people and rightfully
believed that he was being watched.  This was interpreted by
those who were ignorant of the facts as paranoia.  Forrestal
later was said to have suffered a mental breakdown and was
admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital.  In fact it was feared
that Forrestal would begin to talk again and he had to be
isolated and discredited.  Sometime in the early morning of
May 22, 1949 agents of the CIA tied a sheet around his neck,
fastened the other end to a fixture in his room and threw
James Forrestal out the window.  The sheet tore and he
plummeted to his death.  He became one of the first victims
of the cover-up.

The live alien that had been taken from the 1949 Roswell
crash was named EBE.  The name had been suggested by Dr.
Vannever Bush and was short for Extraterrestrial Biological
Entity.  EBE had a tendency to lie and for over a year would
give only the desired answer to questions asked.  Those
questions which would have resulted in an undesirable answer
went unanswered.  At some point during the second year of
captivity he began to open up and the information derived
from EBE was startling to say the least.  This compilation of
his revelations became the foundation of what would later be
called the "Yellow Book".  Photographs were taken of EBE
which, among others, I and Bill English were to view years
later in GRUDGE 13.

In late 1951 EBE became ill.  Medical personnel had been
unable to determine the cause of EBE's illness and had no
background from which to draw.  EBE's system was chlorophyll
based and he processed food into energy much the same as
plants.  Waste material was excreted the same as plants.  It
was decided that an expert in botany was called for.  A
botanist, Dr. Guillermo Mendoza, was brought in to try and
help him recover.  Dr. Mendoza worked to save EBE until until
mid 1952 when EBE died.  Dr. Mendoza became the expert on
alien biology.

In a futile attempt to save EBE and to gain favor with this
technologically superior alien race the United States began
broadcasting a call for help early in 1952 into the vast
regions of space.  The call went unanswered but the project
continued as an effort of good faith.

President Truman created the super secret National Security
Agency by secret Executive Order on November 4, 1952.  Its
primary purpose was to decipher the alien communications and
language and establish a dialog with the aliens.  This most
urgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort and was
code named SIGMA.  The secondary purpose of the NSA was to
monitor all communications and emissions from any and all
devices worldwide for the purpose of gathering intelligence,
both human and alien, and to contain the secret of the alien
presence.  Project Sigma was successful.  The NSA also
maintains communications with the Luna base and other Secret
Space Programs.  By Executive Order The NSA is exempt from
all laws which do not specifically name the NSA in the text
of the law as being subject to that law.  That means that if
the agency is not spelled out in the text of any and every
law passed by the Congress it is not subject to that or those
laws.  The NSA now performs many other duties and in fact is
the premier agency within the intelligence community.  Today
the NSA receives 75% of the moneys allotted to the
intelligence community.  The old saying "where the money goes
therein the power resides is true.  The DCI today is a
figurehead maintained as a public ruse.  The primary task of
the NSA is still alien communications but now includes other
Alien projects as well.

President Truman had been keeping our allies, including the
Soviet Union, informed of the developing alien problem since
the Roswell recovery.  This had been done in case the aliens
turned out to be a threat to the human race.  Plans were
formulated to defend the Earth in case of invasion.  Great
difficulty was encountered in maintaining international
secrecy.  It was decided that an outside group was necessary
to coordinate and control international efforts in order to
hide the secret from the normal scrutiny of governments by
the press.  The result was the formation of a secret society
which became known as the "Bilderburgers".  The headquarters
of this group is Geneva, Switzerland.  The Bilderburgers
evolved into a secret world government that now controls
everything.  The United Nations was then, and is now, an
international joke.

In 1953 a new president occupied the White House.  He was a
man used to a structured staff organization with a chain of
command.  His method was to delegate authority and rule by
committee.  He made major decisions but only when his
advisors were unable to come to consensus.  His normal method
was to read through or listen to several alternatives and
then approve one.  Those who worked closely with him have
stated that his favorite comment was, "just do whatever it
takes".  He spent a lot of time on the golf course.  This was
not at all unusual for a man who had been career Army with
the ultimate position of Supreme Allied Commander during the
war.  A post which carried 5 stars along with it.  This
President was General of the Army Dwight David Eisenhower.

During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more
crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live
aliens.  Of the 10, 4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in
New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South
Africa.  There were hundreds of sightings.

Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien
problem.  He knew that he could not do it by revealing the
secret to the Congress.  Early in 1953 the new President
turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on
Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller for help with the alien
problem.  Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the
secret structure of alien task supervision which was to
become a reality within 1 year.  The idea for MJ-12 was thus
born.  It was Nelson's Uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been
crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President.  The
whole Rockefeller family and with them the Rockefeller empire
had solidly backed Ike.  Asking Rockefeller for help with the
alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever
made for the future of the United States and most probably
all of humanity.

Within 1 week of Eisenhower's election he had appointed
Nelson Rockefeller chairman of a Presidential Advisory
Committee on Government Organization.  Rockefeller was
responsible for planning the reorganization of the
government.  New Deal programs went into 1 single Cabinet
position called the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare.  When the Congress approved the new Cabinet position
in April of 1953, Nelson was named to the post of
Undersecretary to Oveta Culp Hobby.

In 1953 Astronomers discovered large objects in space which
were moving toward the Earth.  It was first believed that
they were asteroids.  Later evidence proved that the objects
could only be Spaceships.  Project Sigma intercepted alien
radio communications.  When the objects reached the Earth
they took up a very high orbit around the Equator.  There
were several huge ships, and their actual intent was unknown.
Project Sigma, and a new project, Plato, through radio
communications using the computer binary language, was able
to arrange a landing that resulted in face to face contact
with alien beings from another planet.  Project Plato was
tasked with establishing diplomatic relations with this race
of space aliens.

In the meantime a race of human looking aliens contacted the
U.S. Government.  This alien group warned us against the
aliens that were orbiting the Equator and offered to help us
with our spiritual development.  They demanded that we
dismantle and destroy our nuclear weapons as the major
condition.  They refused to exchange technology citing that
we were spiritually unable to handle the technology which we
then possessed.  They believed that we would use any new
technology to destroy each other.  This race stated that we
were on a path of self destruction and we must stop killing
each other, stop polluting the Earth, stop raping the Earth's
natural resources, and learn to live in harmony.  These terms
were met with extreme suspicion, especially the major
condition of nuclear disarmament.  It was believed that
meeting that condition would leave us helpless in the face of
an obvious alien threat.  We also had nothing in history to
help with the decision.  Nuclear disarmament was not
considered to be within the best interest of the United
States.  The overtures were rejected.

Later in 1954 the race of large nosed Gray Aliens which had
been orbiting the Earth landed at Holloman Air Force Base.  A
basic agreement was reached.  This race identified themselves
as originating from a Planet around a red star in the
Constellation of Orion which we called Betelgeuse.  They
stated that their planet was dying and that at some unknown
future time they would no longer be able to survive there.
This led to a second landing at Edwards Air Force Base.  The
historical event had been planned in advance and details of
the treaty had been agreed upon.  Eisenhower arranged to be
in Palm Springs on vacation.  On the appointed day the
President was spirited away to the base and the excuse was
given to the press that he was visiting a dentist.

President Eisenhower met with the aliens and a formal treaty
between the Alien Nation and the United States of America was
signed.  We then received our first Alien Ambassador from
outer space.  His name and title was His "Omnipotent Highness
Krlll", pronounced Krill.  In the American tradition of
disdain for royal titles he was secretly called "Original
Hostage Krlll".  You should know that the Alien flag is known
as the "Trilateral Insignia" and is displayed on their craft
and worn on their uniforms.  Both of these landings and the
second meeting were filmed.  These films exist today.

The treaty stated:  The aliens would not interfere in our
affairs and we would not interfere in theirs.  We would keep
their presence on earth a secret.  They would furnish us with
advanced technology and would help us in our technological
development.  They would not make any treaty with any other
earth nation.  They could abduct humans on a limited and
periodic basis for the purpose of medical examination and
monitoring of our development with the stipulation that the
humans would not be harmed, would be returned to their point
of abduction, that the humans would have no memory of the
event, and that the Alien nation would furnish MJ-12 with a
list of all human contacts and abductees on a regularly
scheduled basis.  It was agreed that each nation would
receive the Ambassador of the other for as long as the treaty
remained in force.  It was further agreed that the Alien
nation and the United States would exchange 16 personnel each
to the other with the purpose of learning, each of the other.
The Alien "Guests" would remain on earth and the human
"Guests" would travel to the Alien point of origin for a
specified period of time then return, at which point a
reverse exchange would be made.  It was also agreed that
bases would be constructed underground for the use of the
Alien nation and that 2 bases would be constructed for the
joint use of the Alien nation and the United States
Government.  Exchange of technology would take place in the
jointly occupied bases.  These Alien bases would be
constructed under Indian reservations in the 4 corners of
Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and 1 would be
constructed in Nevada in the area known as S-4 located
approximately 7 miles south of the western border of Area 51,
known as Dreamland.  All alien areas are under complete
control of the Naval Department and all personnel who work in
these complexes receive their checks from the Navy.
Construction of the bases began immediately but progress was
slow until large amounts of money were made available in
1957.  Work continued on the "Yellow Book".

Project REDLIGHT was formed and experimentation in test
flying alien craft was begun in earnest.  A super TOP SECRET
facility was built at Groom Lake in Nevada in the midst of
the weapons test range.  It was code named DREAMLAND.  The
installation was placed under the Department of the Navy and
clearance of all personnel required a "Q" clearance as well
as Executive (Presidential) approval.  This is ironic due to
the fact that the President of the United States does not
have clearance to visit the site.  The alien base and
exchange of technology actually took place in an Area known
as S-4.  Area S-4 was code named "The Dark Side of the Moon".

The Army was tasked to form a super secret organization to
furnish security for all alien tasked projects.  This
organization became the National Reconnaissance Organization
based at Fort Carson, Colorado.  The specific teams trained
to secure the projects were called Delta.

A second project code named SNOWBIRD was promulgated to
explain away any sightings of the REDLIGHT crafts as being
Air Force experiments.  The SNOWBIRD crafts were manufactured
using conventional technology and were flown for the press on
several occasions.  Project SNOWBIRD was also used to debunk
legitimate public sightings of alien craft (UFOS).  Project
SNOWBIRD was very successful and reports from the public
declined steadily until recent years.

A multimillion-dollar SECRET fund was organized and kept by
the Military Office of the White House.  This fund was used
to build over 75 deep underground facilities.  Presidents who
asked were told the fund was used to build Deep Underground
Shelters for the President in case of war.  Only a few were
built for the President.  Millions of dollars were funneled
through this office to MJ-12 and then out to the contractors
and was used to build TOP SECRET alien bases as well as TOP
SECRET DUMB (Deep Underground Military Bases), and the
facilities promulgated by "Alternative 2", throughout the
nation.  President Johnson used this fund to build a movie
theater and pave the road on his ranch.  He had no idea of
its true purpose.

The secret White House underground construction fund was set
up in 1957 by President Eisenhower.  The funding was obtained
from Congress under the guise of "construction and
maintenance of secret sites where the President could be
taken in case of military attack: Presidential Emergency
Sites".  The sites are literally holes in the ground, deep
enough to withstand a nuclear blast and are outfitted with
state of the art communications equipment.  To date there are
more than seventy-five sites spread around the country which
were built using money from this fund.  The Atomic Energy
Commission has built at least an additional 22 underground
sites.

The location and everything to do with these sites were and
are considered and treated as TOP SECRET.  The money was and
is in control of the Military Office of the White House, and
was and is laundered through a circuitous web that even the
most knowledgeable spy or accountant can not follow.  As of
1980 only a few at the beginning and end of this web knew
what the money was for.  At the beginning were Representative
George Mahon, of Texas, the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee and of its Defense Subcommittee; and
Representative Robert Sikes, of Florida, chairman of the
House Appropriations Military Construction Subcommittee.
Today it is rumored that House Speaker Jim Wright controls
the money in Congress and that a power struggle is underway
to remove him.  At the end of the line were the President,
MJ-12, the director of the Military Office and a commander at
the Washington Navy Yard.

The money was authorized by the Appropriations Committee who
allocated it to the Department of Defense as a TOP SECRET
item in the Army construction program.  The Army, however
could not spend it and in fact did not even know what it was
for.  Authorization to spend the money was in reality given
to the Navy.  The money was channeled to the Chesapeake
Division of the Navy Engineers who did not know what it was
for either.  Not even the Commanding Officer, who was an
Admiral, knew what the fund was to be used for.  Only one
man, a Navy Commander, who was assigned to the Chesapeake
Division but in reality was responsible only to the Military
Office of the White House knew of the actual purpose, amount,
and ultimate destination of the TOP SECRET fund.  The total
secrecy surrounding the fund meant that almost every trace of
it could be made to disappear by the very few people who
controlled it.  There has never been and most likely never
will be an audit of this secret money.

Large amounts of money were transferred from the TOP SECRET
fund to a location at Palm Beach, Florida that belongs to the
Coast Guard called Peanut Island.  The island is adjacent to
property which was owned by Joseph Kennedy.  The money was
said to have been used for landscaping and general
beautification.  Some time ago a TV news special on the
Kennedy assassination told of a Coast Guard Officer
transferring money in a briefcase to a Kennedy employee
across this property line.  Could this have been a secret
payment to the Kennedy family for the loss of their son John
F.  Kennedy?  The payments continued through the year 1967
and then stopped.  The total amount transferred is unknown
and the actual use of the money is unknown.

Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller changed positions again.  This
time he was to take C. D. Jackson's old position which had
been called the Special Assistant for Psychological Strategy.
With Nelson's appointment the name was changed to the Special
Assistant for Cold War Strategy.  This position would evolve
over the years into the same position Henry Kissinger was
ultimately to hold under President Nixon.  Officially he was
to give "Advice and assistance in the development of
increased understanding and cooperation among all peoples".
The official description was a smoke screen for secretly he
was the Presidential Coordinator for the Intelligence
Community.  In his new post Rockefeller reported directly,
and only, to the President.  He attended meetings of the
Cabinet, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and the
National Security Council which was the highest policy-making
body in the government.

Nelson Rockefeller was also given a second important job as
the head of the secret unit called the Planning Coordination
Group which was formed under NSC 5412/1 in March of 1955.
The group consisted of different ad hoc members depending on
the subject on the agenda.  The basic members were
Rockefeller, A representative of the Department of Defense, A
representative of the Department of State, and the Director
of Central Intelligence.  It was soon called the "5412
Committee" or the "Special Group".  NSC 5412/1 established
the rule that covert operations were subject to approval by
an executive committee, whereas in the past these operations
were initiated solely on the authority of the Director of
Central Intelligence.

By secret Executive Memorandum, NSC 5410, Eisenhower had
preceded NSC 5412/1 in 1954 to establish a permanent
committee (not ad hoc) to be known as Majority Twelve (MJ-12)
to oversee and conduct all covert activities concerned with
the alien question.  NSC 5412/1 was created to explain the
purpose of these meetings when Congress and the Press became
curious.  Majority Twelve was made up of Nelson Rockefeller,
the Director of Central Intelligence Allen Welsh Dulles, the
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of
Defense Charles E.  Wilson, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Admiral Arthur W.  Radford, the Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover, and six men
from the executive committee of the Council on Foreign
Relations known as the "Wise Men".  These men were all
members of a secret society of scholars that called
themselves "The Jason Society", or "The Jason Scholars" who
recruited their members from the "Skull and Bones" and the
"Scroll and Key" societies of Harvard and Yale.

The "Wise Men" were key members of the Council on Foreign
Relations.  There were 12 members including the first 6 from
Government positions thus Majority Twelve.  This group was
made up over the years of the top officers and directors of
the Council on Foreign Relations and later the Trilateral
Commission.  Gordon Dean, George Bush and Zbigniew Brzezinski
were among them.  The most important and influential of the
"Wise Men" who served on MJ-12 were John McCloy, Robert
Lovett, Averell Harriman, Charles Bohlen, George Kennan, and
Dean Acheson.  Their policies were to last well into the
decade of the 70s.  It is significant that President
Eisenhower as well as the first 6 MJ-12 members from the
Government were also members of the Council on Foreign
Relations.

Thorough researchers will soon discover that not all of the
"Wise Men" attended Harvard or Yale and not all of them were
chosen for "Skull and Bones" or "Scroll and Key" membership
during their college years.  You will be able to quickly
clear up this mystery by obtaining the book "The Wise Men" by
Walter Isaacson & Evan Thomas, Simon and Schuster, New York.
Under illustration #9 in the center of the book you will find
the caption; "Lovett with the Yale Unit, above far right, and
on the beach: His initiation into Skull and Bones came at an
air base near Dunkirk".  I have found that members were
chosen on an ongoing basis by invitation based upon merit
post college and was not confined to only Harvard or Yale
attendees.

A chosen few were later initiated into the Jason Society.
They are all members of the Council on Foreign Relations and
at that time were known as the "Eastern Establishment".  This
should give you a clue to the far reaching and serious nature
of these most secret college societies.  The society is alive
and well today but now includes members of the Trilateral
Commission as well.  The Trilateralists existed secretly
several years BEFORE 1973.  The name of the Trilateral
Commission was taken from the alien flag known as the
Trilateral Insignia.

Majority Twelve was to survive right up to the present day.
Under Eisenhower and Kennedy it was erroneously called the
"5412 Committee" or more correctly the "Special Group".  In
the Johnson Administration it became the "303 Committee"
because the name 5412 had been compromised in the book "The
Secret Government".  Actually NSC 5412/1 was leaked to the
author to hide the existence of NSC 5410.  Under Nixon, Ford,
and Carter it was called the "40 Committee", and under Reagan
it became the "PI-40 Committee".  Over all those years only
the name changed.

By 1955 it became obvious that the aliens had deceived
Eisenhower and had broken the treaty.  Mutilated humans were
being found along with mutilated animals all across the
United States.  It was suspected that the aliens were not
submitting a complete list of human contacts and abductees to
MJ-12 and it was suspected that not all abductees had been
returned.  The Soviet Union was suspected of interacting with
them and this proved to be true.  It was learned that the
aliens had been and were then manipulating masses of people
through secret societies, witchcraft, magic, the occult, and
religion.  After several Air Force combat air engagements
with alien craft it also became apparent that our weapons
were no match against them.

In November of 1955 NSC-5412/2 was issued establishing a
study committee to explore "all factors which are involved in
the making and implementing of foreign policy in the nuclear
age".  This was only a blanket of snow that covered the real
subject of study, the alien question.

By secret Executive Memorandum, NSC 5411 in 1954, President
Eisenhower had commissioned the study group to "examine all
the facts, evidence, lies, and deception and discover the
truth of the alien question".  NSC 5412/2 was only a cover
that had become necessary when the press began inquiring as
to the purpose of regular meetings of such important men.
The first meetings began in 1954 and were called the Quantico
meetings because they met at the Quantico Marine Base.  The
study group was made up solely of 35 members of the Council
on Foreign Relations' secret scholars known as "The Jason
Society" or "The Jason Scholars".  Dr.  Edward Teller was
invited to participate.   Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski was the
Study Director for the first 18 months.  Dr.  Henry Kissinger
was chosen as the groups Study Director for the second 18
months beginning in November of 1955.  Nelson Rockefeller was
a frequent visitor during the study.
