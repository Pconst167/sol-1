Two reports of UFO sighting 8 hours apart on Oct. 6 and 7 in Lorain
County. Mrs. Cchrist, 23, of 208 Furnace St. said:  A wedgeshaped
object hovered above her parked car at 10:30 P.M. Oct. 6.  She had
noticed a bright starlike object as she was walking towards the vehicle.
Once inside, she peered out and saw the white light moving real fast
towards her.  She said: It dove down and it flipped on its side, she
said: A grayish, diamond -shaped outline blended in with the sky but
appeared to be about 25 feet long, she said: In the middle of the
object, hovering silently at the height of a telephone pole, was an
intense light surrounded by two green lights and two red lights.
A large strobe light falling from the sky was the way Mrs. Ward, of
1017 Chatum Court, described her sighting she observed a pulsating
light dropped down in the area or vicinity of State Rt. 57 a short
distance away. Mrs. Ward said: She has no way of gauging the actual
side of the object but in her range of vision it was the side of a
basketball.

Nassau County police sais: Last night, the unidentified object moving
across the evening skies was a blimp.  But then again, the Federal
Aviation Administration and the port Authority police said: It was
a prank by small planes flying in formation.  More then two dozen
Nassau residents phoned newsday last night to report a strange, silient
object with blinking lights crossing north by northeast over Valley
Stream, West Hempstead, Garden City, New Hyde Park, Westbury and Port
Washington. Leslie Gross reported that she and her husband were in
Manhasset about 8:30 p.m. when they saw an object like a kite....moving
slowly through the sky.  There were white and red lights flashing
on and off.  It was a seven-dot configuration.  Then it changed from
a triangular shape to an oval shape. It was quite large.It was low
enough so that If it was a plane, you would have heard the motor.
After South Shore precincts received more then 50 telephoned queries
a car was dispatched to the Hempstead area about 8:45 p.m.  Officers
Paul Scheibelein and Robert Schiller of the Fifth Precinct identified
the object as a blimp.  They said: They could see the oval shape and
identify the runing lights.  Port Authority police and the FAA said:
The UFO was probably four or five small planes flying in formation.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. ( AP )  Mrs. Sylvia Bagby reported observing a big
round, red object. She said: It was as large as a house and had a
yellow halo. Mrs.Bagby said: She felt a tingling sensation during
the experience that night of Nov 10, as if she had been out in the
sun to long. Mrs.  Bagby called the sheriff department but they just
"laughed".So I really haven't said that much about it. She said: It
makes you feel so alone. But four other people living near Lincolnton
said: They saw a Saturn-shaped object that maneuvered near their
homes for about 30 minutes on May 1, frightening animals and causing
power failures and telephone interfe-rence.  They said: It vibrated
their house,cast a beam  of light on one of them and gave off a heat
wave. Two other witnesses a woman and a pilot said: They saw a circle
red, blue, green, and white object with lights moving towards Elkin
on Sept. 2.  A man and his wife watched a round, white object the
size of an airplane cross the road in front of their car near Lowesville
on Oct. 8. They said: It had three tripod landing gears on the bottom
and made an intense humming sound in the area foer about five minutes.
A woman was returning home to Matthews from  work in Charlotte on
Dec. 5. when she saw two bright, oval-shaped objects, about 900 square
feet in area, shaped like diamonds on the rear. She almost hit a truck
whose driver also saw two huge UFOs with rows of white lighted area
surrounded by borders flying above the treetops and across the road.
These cases are still being investigated by George Fawcett a Mutual

sat there through the trees at a 30 degree angle, we tried driving
closer towards the direction they were coming from, but then lost
sight of them.
