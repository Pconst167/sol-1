ParaNet is pleased to announce the apppointment of Don Ecker as Director of
Network Security. ParaNet has experienced phenomenal growth and the need for
this has become very apparent. Don, sysop of ParaNet Alpha-Delta, has been
appointed Director of ParaNet Network Security.  Ecker is a veteran of Viet
Nam, having served 26 months in SouthEast Asia with Special Operations. Upon
returning to the States, he returned to college and after a year at school
applied to the municipal Police Department and was accepted.  Leaving after a
year, he rejoined the private sector and entered business in the world of
finance.  After several years he returned to police work, and after serving as
a uniformed officer was made a detective, and became a criminal investigator.
In 1982 he first became aware of the mutilation phenomenon when called upon
to investigate several cattle mutilations.  While involved in a SWAT TEAM
exercise in 1986, he was wounded which led to his medical retirement. While
recuperating he became interested again in the UFO enigma, and was soon
convinced that the best way to investigate it was to treat the subject like a
criminal investigation.  Joining MUFON, he was asked to serve as a State
Section Director and Investigator. Learning of ParaNet in 1987, he joined as
an assistant sysop with the old ParaNet RHO.  During additional investigations
of cattle mutilations occurring in Idaho, the first of a number of cases of
what appeared to be "human mutilations" came to his attention and resulted in
investigations into this bizarre area of research. Ecker has written articles
for UFO Magazine, reported news and written book reviews.  He spoke on his
research in mutilations at the 1989 MUFON Conference, has lectured on the
subject before numerous organizations, and appeared on both radio and
television programs speaking on the phenomenon. Security is a vital concern
for any type of network such as ours. I ask you to extend a warm welcome to
Don.
