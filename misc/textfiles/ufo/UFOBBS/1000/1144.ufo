SUBJECT: CRIPPLED STARSHIP SENDS DISTRESS SIGNAL TO EARTH !  FILE: UFO1144

Startled scientists her on Earth have received a desperate SOS from an alien
starship - sent more than 25,000 years ago!

Experts in the United States and Russia are convinced the bizarre Mayday mes-
sage came from a spacecraft attacked by a heavily armed enemy ship around 
23,000 B.C., German physicist Franz-Herbert Mooser told a European scientific
journal.

This shocking transmission was intercepted by American scientists at an observ-
tory in the jungles of Puerto Rico and by Russian scientists at a similar lis-
tening post in Siberia, Dr. Mooser said.

Although they deny this, the Russians and the Americans recorded the coded 
message on the same date - March 3, 1990 - and have spent years working to int-
erpret it, said the astrophysicist, who was part of an international team of
scientists that used special computers to translate the cry for help.

The transmission apparently originated in or near M13, a cluster of stars on 
the outer edges of the Milky Way.

From what we can determine, the message came from an unarmed passenger ship
engaged in interplanetary travel, the scientist said. The crippled ship appar-
ently radioed its distress call moments after being struck by missiles launch-
ed from a passing warship from another planet.

The message has been streaking its way toward Earth at the speed of light for
the past 25,000 years and it just now reached us.

But even if the message had reached us at the time they sent it, we would have
been little help.

Back then, Earthlings were still living in caves.
