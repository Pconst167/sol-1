 -------------------------------------- 
Last night (July 29) at 11:45 I looked out at the stars and saw a
very bright light above the lake.  I watached it flash through the
trees.  It was about four times the size of a star.  About an hour
later after it shot flashes and was very bright, it came into the
clear sky.  Above it was an object that hovered over it.  This was
at least 20 times larger.  The smaller object dipped continually
always going back to the space it occupied.  After an hour of this
behavior they moved to the right and the larger object went to the
side - a distance apart.  It was steady but the smaller one still
dipped.  At a little after 2 a.m. when the large one went above the
small one the one on top sped away to the right.  The little one made
dips but kept on lowering itself.  A dark cloud covered it and
then were both gone.

Ray Nethercott saw a "big hot dog" fly by his Valhalla home Thursday
night. "It was weird," the 18 year old said "It was going pretty slow
and had lots of lights on it."
 
Alison Yuri, 20, of Fishkill was driving through Ossining on Route 9
when she saw something hovering over her car.
 
"My boyfriend saw it first," she said.  "It was rounder than a hot
dog and had about 20 white lights and two red lights on it."
 
Nethercott and Ms. Yuri were among dozens of people along the Hudson
River in Westchester County and in New Jersey who called police
departments and local airports to report strange lights flying along
the river.

It moved ever so slowly through the night sky like a glowing, spiraling,
one- armed pinwheel.
 
Wherever it came from, whatever it was, the UFO gave 110 Metro Detroit 
stargazers more than they bargained for Tuesday night. 
 
It also spawned hundreds of calls of inquiry around the country Wednesday
after sightings of the mysterious object elsewhere in Michigan and
in nearly every other state east of the Mississippi.
 
Residents of Kentucky's Clark County, east of Lexington, heard a boom
accompany the show.
 
"Some people said they saw great big ball of fire," said Clark County
Deputy Larry Lawson.  "The people said their homes shook and windows
vibrated as if there had been an explosion or earthquake, but it was
just for just a very few seconds.  They said the whole sky lit up.
 
"All these people weren't imagining or seeing things.  Some of them
were very terrified over it right after it happened.  Some said they
smelled something like gunpowder."
 
The object was seen by Detroit skywatchers who had gathered at the
Troy Outdoor Education Center's farm for an outdoor lecture and a
look at the annual Perseid meteor shower.  The campfire was blazing
and marsh-mallows were roasting when suddenly one of the attendees
stood up, pointed up into the southeast sky and shouted, "What is
that?"

Researchers are scratching their heads, perplexed at an unusual sighting
by apparently thousands of people over the eastern United States shortly
after 10 a.m. Tuesday.
 
Nancy Miller of Ebensburg was among those taking advantage of a clear
night to watch for shooting stars.
 
Mrs. Miller was looking high in the sky when she caught a glimpse
of something moving at the bottom of her vision.  At first, she thought
it was an airplane. But she saw a bright light, then a light that
appeared to come out of the first one in swirls that she described
as almost cloudlike.
 
"It was moving toward me," she said.  "I was ready to go into the
house to call 
my husband and son when my son came out and he saw it too. 
 
"While we were standing there looking, it slowly changed - like three
lights in sort of a long thin cloud.  It became cloudlike and slowly
went away, becoming fainter until we couldn't see it."
 
At first, Mrs. Miller said, the object seemed far away, but it moved
quite rapidly toward her.  From start to finish, she estimated, the
sighting took no more than a minute.
