LETTER ON UFO CIRCUIT IGNITES CONTROVERSY
  by Vicki Cooper
      An  explosive  letter  making the rounds in UFOdom claims that offic-
ials  within the US government unwittingly entered a deadly conspiracy with 
aliens  over  20  years ago - a shocking and unprecedented pact that is now 
backfiring horribly.
      In  what  sounds  like a B-grade plot for a 50's sci-fi epic, charter 
airline  pilot  John  Lear of Nevada reveals information he says comes from 
reliable  sources in the American intelligence network. Because of the out-
rageous  nature  of the information and the questionable veracity of Lear's 
unnamed  sources,  the  letter  has met with a barrage of skepticism within 
the UFO community.
      In  highly  dramatic terms, Lear's 9-page missive chronicles the U.S. 
government/military  cover-up  of UFO data and the creation of a top secret 
group called MJ-12, which is described as "the top military-scientific per-
sonnel of their time."
      Lear  alleges  that after saucer crashes in the late 1940s and almost 
30  succeeding years of suppressed UFO events, the first communications be-
tween   aliens  and  our government took place. "The 'deal' was that in ex-
change  for  'technology'  that they would provide us we agreed to 'ignore' 
the  abductions  that  were going on and suppress information on the cattle 
mutilations,"  the  letter  states.  "The EBEs (extraterrestrial biological 
entities)  assured  MJ-12  that  the  abductions...were  merely the ongoing 
monitoring of developing civilizations."
      In  his  piece de resistance, Lear charges that the EBEs instigated a 
"grand  deception"  to  hide  their true motives, which include parasitical 
consumption  of  human  biological matter, "termination" of individuals who 
might  interfere  with  their plans, and the creation of human-alien cross-
breeds.
      The  letter  first  appeared in December on ParaNet, an Arizona-based 
computer  bulletin  board  featuring  miscellaneous  items on UFOs, Fortean 
subjects  and  other  paranormal  phenomena.  Though ParaNet's Director Jim 
Speiser  was  himself  initially skeptical of the letter, he decided to re-
lease  its  contents on a bet with Lear. The letter immediately made waves. 
"Its  being  taken  with  a pillar of salt, even by UFO believers," Speiser 
says. "They're backing (Lear) into a corner about his sources."
      Lear  acknowledges  the  high  potential of disinformation in what he 
wrote,  which  he  says  is  actually an "hypothesis" that should have been 
released  with  his  cover  letter  describing months of research trips and 
first-person  interviews  with witnesses and intelligence sources. He says, 
"If  we  are being fed disinformation, you have to ask -- what in the world 
could  they  be  disinforming  us  about?" Meanwhile, one of Lear's sources 
tells  him  that MJ-12 members are "wringing their hands" because of recent 
EBE warnings that something ominous is about to happen.
      Son  of  the  man  behind  the Lear jet, Lear has a long and colorful 
history  as  a  private pilot who has, among other adventures, flown covert 
missions  for  the CIA. He's currently employed as captain of a major char-
ter airline.
      Lear  stands  behind the information contained in his letter. "It was 
originally  for  my  friends," he says. "I had no idea that it would go out 
to the entire US and have to be backed up word for word!
      "People  want  proof  and  they want it now. All I can say is that if 
they'd  sat  where I have and listened to all the stuff that's come to me - 
each little thing adds to the veracity of the hypothesis."
      At  the  time he offered the letter to ParaNet, Lear, swore the stuff 
was  credible.  Says  Speiser, "He said if I didn't get a call from the Air 
Force  Office  of Special Investigations upon transmitting the letter, he'd 
buy me dinner at Caesar's Palace."
      At  the  time of this writing, Speiser is still waiting patiently for 
his call and his dinner.

------------------------
Corrections  and clarifications: 1) The letter, though written in December, 
appeared  in  mid-January. 2) Besides being initially skeptical, I am STILL 
skeptical.  3) Lear sent me the letter and INSISTED that I put it on ParaNet, which he knew to be a national network. His statement that he didn't know it would "go out to the entire U.S." seems to be what Jesse Jackson would call a terminological inexactitude. 4) Our agreement was to print EVERYTHING John sentme, not just the  letter,  and  I would be hearing from OSI. I can't say as I've held up my  end  of  the bargain, because John has sent me a lot of stuff;however, you'd  think the letter would be enough to flush out OSI, if anything in it were true....
