                  WHAT ON EARTH?
          CIRCLES APPEAR AT LOCAL AIRFIELD

FOUR strange rings-up to 200 feet across-appeared overnight in wheat fields on the edge of a Peterborough airfield.
     Parachutists at Sibson, near Wansford, were stunned to find themselves plummeting at over 100 mph towards a cluster of mysterious crop circles.
     And now the questions are being asked:  Waht on earth are they?  Alien IQ tests or amazing hoaxes?  Or something else?
     What is causing them?  Freak weather conditions or pranksters running rings round us?
     Pilots flying from the Peterborough Parachute Centre saw four of the mystery circles in fields a few yards from where their planes were taking off.
     The patterns are similar to the phenomena that have been baffling some of the best brains in the country for weeks.
     Evening Telegraph reporter Paul Gregan and chief photographer Rowland Hobson walked right into the centre rings of three of the circles.  They were amazed by the size of them-up to 200 feet across-and think they were beyond anynormal hoaxer.
     "We trod down wheat to get into the rings and those stalks were crushed and lying in all directions," said Paul.
     "But the crops inside the circles had not been trampled at all.  They looked more like they had been carefully plaited together."
     Norwich  Weather Centre said they were trying not get pulled into the national controversy raging round rings.  But a spokesman did say some of the local whirlwinds blamed by some experts for the circles had been reported in Norfolk.
  *A rainbow that appeared over parched Peterborough last night was caused by ice crystals 25,000 feet above the city, say weathermen.
     The parahelis, or mack-sun, happens when the sun hits cirrus slouds at a precise angle.
