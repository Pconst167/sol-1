MODEL UFO UNDERGOES TESTS, RETURNED TO FINDER; TESTS RESULTS DUE IN TWO WEEKS

PENSACOLA, FL (JUNE 12) UPI -  A model flying saucer that cast doubts on a
man's claim he photographed UFOs two years ago has been tested and is being
returned to the man who found it, a newspaper editor said Tuesday.

Ken Fortenberry, managing editor of the Pensacola News Journal, said results of
the tests would not be known for a couple of weeks. He declined to say what
tests were performed.

The discovery of the 9-inch model was the latest twist on a story that began in
1987, when contractor Ed Walters took photos of objects that appeared to be
flying saucers near his home in Gulf Breeze, a suburb of Pensacola.

The photographs prompted a wave of sightings from other residents that continue
to this day. Walters claimed he had dozens of additional encounters, including
a face-to-face confrontation with a 4-foot alien.

His book about the encounters is selling well.

A private group that investigates UFO sightings calls the Gulf Breeze flurry
among the most notable sightings in U.S. history. Skeptics have long claimed
the pictures were faked, but offered no proof.

Then came the model.

It was found in April by a man who moved into a house once owned by Walters.
The newspaper got possession of the model, and on Sunday printed pictures by
staff photographers using the model.

They look similar to Walters' pictures.

''This is a very critical piece of evidence and a very controversial story ''
said Fortenberry, who said the newspaper was besieged with calls Monday from
the media asking about the model.

Meanwhile, a UFO investigator claims his analysis of the pictures published by
the newspaper indicates it is not the same object as the ones Walters
photographed.

Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist at a Navy lab in the Washington area, said
he has not seen the model or the photos published by the newspaper. But he said
he had Walters take some measurements of the picture.

Maccabee said the model has different proportions from Walters' photos.

''What this means is that whatever Ed's UFO pictures show, they don't show that
model,'' said Maccabee.

The model was to be returned to the owners Tuesday.

The man, who wished not to be identified, said he was installing an ice-maker
in his home and had gone to the attic to trace some pipes when he found the
model under some insulation.

''It was not a shock or startling or anything,'' said the resident, a
scientist. He knew of Walters' involvement in sightings and figured the model
was one that Walters may have built for a reenactment. ''I thought nothing more
about it.''

Later, he saw a diagram of the Walters' UFO.

''I recall thinking to myself, that model looks a lot like this diagram,'' he
said. Last week he received a visit from a reporter from the newspaper.
''This, frankly, I find a little suspicious,'' said the resident, who said the
reporter showed up at the door and asked whether he had found any photographs
or models. That's when he told him.

''I wish I had lied,'' he said.

Walters insists there was ample opportunity for someone to plant the model.

''The house was on the market for 10 months, during which time it was opened
during the day and sometimes closed up and locked up at night,'' said Walters.
''Sometime, somebody planted this model.''

''The way I see it is this: It's very suspicious that three weeks before the
big international symposium, suddenly this model pops into the act,'' said
Walters.
