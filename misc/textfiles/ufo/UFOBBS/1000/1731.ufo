SUBJECT: AP LATEST MARTIAN NEWS                              FILE: UFO1731



THE FOLLOWING NEWS ITEM APPEARED ON AP (ASSOCIATED PRESS) AT 
4:41 PM EST MARCH 30, 1989:
.
"SOVIET RESEARCH CENTERS ARE NOW TRYING TO INTERPRET SO FAR 
'UNEXPLAINED OPTICAL PHONOMENA' ON THE PICTURES OF THE MARTIAN
SURFACE.  THE PICTURES SHOW AN INIGMATIC STRIP 23-25 MILES
WIDE AND A LARGE SPINDLE-SHAPED FORMATION."
.
According to NASA liason spokepersons in Moscow, the Soviets
had not turned on their camera and WERE NOT even taking
pictures of the Martian surface.  This is the information
which was relayed only a few weeks ago.  AP also stated 
that the Soviet news program "Vremya" showed a detailed
map of Mars "compiled from photos taken during the mission."
It DOES now appear that the Soviets WERE taking pictures and
furthermore, it looks like they may have found something
in those photographs which is quite interesting.
