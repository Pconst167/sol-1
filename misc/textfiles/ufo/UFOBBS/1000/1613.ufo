CAUTION
for UFO Investigators

Copyright (c) 1991 Jon Roland

There is an old saying, "Be careful what
you ask for. You might get it." It applies to
UFO investigators, most of whom are
motivated to try to find out what is behind
what so many people are reporting by a
mixture of curiosity, fear, and a nagging
suspicion that we are not being told
something that we have a right to know. The
UFO mystery has emerged as perhaps the
major unsolved mystery of our time that is
not being openly researched by organized,
governmentally supported science.

One family of hypotheses concerning this
subject, first advanced by Charles Fort, one
version of which I have discussed elsewhere
(see "Speculations on UFO Technology and
Operations"), supposes that at least one, and
perhaps many, alien races are based in the
vicinity of Earth, perhaps underground, and
have been for a long time; and that lifeforms
on the surface of Earth, including ourselves,
are the subject of long-term study and
perhaps experimentation by at least one of
those races.

The importance of this hypothesis is that, if
valid, it could be dangerous to verify it,
either for the investigator and his friends, or
even for humanity as a whole.

Much speculation on alien visitors tends to
suppose that they are occasional visitors to
Earth, based elsewhere, who regard us as
less developed than themselves, but who still
respect us as fellow sentients that may
someday join them among the family of
spacefaring civilizations. This may be
wishful thinking, a projection of our
attitudes toward primitive peoples in recent
history. We must consider the possibility
that they rather regard us as we regard
laboratory rats, with little or no sympathy,
as things which exist for their edification or
amusement, and which they are prepared to
manipulate or terminate when it suits their
purposes to do so.

If their purposes are scientific, then our
continued existence may depend on us
remaining interesting to their scientific
studies.

Experimenters don't care whether rats know
about them, because rats can't discuss their
situation among themselves, or contemplate
different ways of behaving that are affected
by their knowledge of the existence of the
experimenters and their purposes. Rats that
developed the ability to do that during an
experiment would thereby become useless
for behavioral studies. It would be a classic
case of the problem of the subject being
excessively altered by the act of observation.

Although there is already a widespread
belief among people that UFOs are evidence
of alien beings, the lack of official
acknowledgement that they are at least
leaves most people not behaving much
differently than they would if they were
unaware of the phenomenon -- much like
rats. Proof of the existence of aliens and of
their role in our fate could change that
situation suddenly. Before we find such
proof, we need to consider the consequences
of finding and disclosing it.

We also need to consider the role of our
species among other surface lifeforms,
which may also be the subject of alien study
