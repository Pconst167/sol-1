PART 13

Cooper's Conspiracy Theory: Soon Lear was joined by someone  with
an  even  bigger  supply of fabulous yarns:  one  Milton  William
Cooper. Cooper surfaced on December 18, 1988, when his account of
the  fantastic  secrets he learned while a  Naval  petty  officer
appeared  on a computer network subscribed to by  ufologists  and
others interested in anomalous phenomena. Cooper said that  while
working  as  a quartermaster with an intelligence team  for  Adm.
Bernard  Clarey, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Meet,  in  the
early  1970s he saw two documents, Project Grudge Special  Report
13 and a Majority briefing. (In conventional UFO history,  Grudge
was  the  second public Air Force UFO  project,  superseding  the
original Sign, in early 1949 and lasting until late 1951, when it
was  renamed  Blue Book. Whereas Sign investigators at  one  time
concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin--a conclusion  the
Air  force  leadership found unacceptable--Grudge,  as  its  name
suggests coincidentally or otherwise, was known for its hostility
to the idea of UFOs and for its eagerness to assign  conventional
explanations,  warranted  or otherwise, to the  sighting  reports
that came its way.) Cooper's account of what was in these reports
is  much  like  the by-now familiar  story  of  crashes,  bodies,
contacts and projects, with some elaborations. Moreover, he  said
the  aliens  were called "ALFs" (which as any  television  viewer
knows,  stands for Alien Life forms) and the "M" in MJ-12 is  for
Majority not Majestic. Later he would say he had seen photographs
of aliens, including a type he called the "big-nosed  grays"-like
those  that  supposedly landed at Holloman in 1964 or  1971.  The
U.S.  government  was in contact with them  and  alien-technology
projects were going on at Area 51.

 If  this sounded like a rehash of Moore and Lear, that was  only
because  Cooper  had yet to pull out all the stops.  On  May  23,
1989,  Cooper  produced  a 25-page  document  titled  The  Secret
Government:  The  Origin,  Identity  And  Purpose  of  MJ-12.  He
presented  it  as a lecture in Las Vegas a few  weeks  later.  In
Cooper's version of the evolving legend, the "secret government,"
an  unscrupulous  group  of covert  CIA  and  other  intelligence
operatives who keep many of their activities sealed from even the
President's  knowledge, runs the country. One of its  first  acts
was  to murder one-time Secretary of Defense (and  alleged  early
MJ-12  member)  James Forrestal the death was made to  look  like
suicide-because  he  threatened  to  expose  the  UFO   cover-up.
Nonetheless,  President  Truman, fearing an invasion  from  outer
space, kept other nations, including the Soviet Union, abreast of
developments. But keeping all this secret was a real problem,  so
an  international  secret  society known  as  the  Bilderbergers,
headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was formed. Soon it  became
a  secret world government and "now controls everything,"  Cooper
said.

 All the while flying saucers were dropping like flies out of the
heavens.  In  1953  there were 10 crashes in  the  United  States
alone.  Also  that  year, astronomers  observed  huge  spaceships
heading  toward the earth and in time entering into orbit  around
the   equator.   Project   Plato  was   established   to   effect
communication with these new aliens. One of the ships landed  and
a  face-to-face  meeting  took place, and  plans  for  diplomatic
relations  were  laid. Meanwhile a race of  human-looking  aliens
warned  the U.S. government that the new visitors were not to  be
trusted  and  that  if  the government got  rid  of  its  nuclear
weapons,  the  human  aliens  would  help  us  in  our  spiritual
development,  which  would  keep  us  from  destroying  ourselves
through wars and environmental pollution. The government rejected
these overtures.

 The big-nosed grays, the ones who had been orbiting the equator,
landed  again, this time at Holloman AFB, in 1954 and reached  an
agreement with the U.S. government. These beings stated that they
were from a dying planet that orbits Betelguese. At some point in
the  not too distant future, they said, they would have to  leave
there  for good. A second meeting took place not long  afterwards
at Edwards AFB in California. This time President Eisenhower  was
there  to  sign  a  formal treaty and to  meet  the  first  alien
ambassador,  "His Omnipotent Highness Krlll,"  pronounced  Krill.
He, in common with his fellow space travelers, wore a  trilateral
insignia  on  his  uniform;  the  same  design  appears  on   all
Betelguese spacecraft.

 According  to  Cooper's account, the  treaty's  provisions  were
these: Neither side would interfere in the affairs of the  other.
The aliens would abduct humans from time to time and would return
them  unharmed, with no memory of the event. It would  provide  a
list of names of those it was going to take. The U.S.  government
would  keep  the aliens' presence a secret and it  would  receive
advanced  technology from them. The two sides would  exchange  16
individuals  each for the purpose of learning from  and  teaching
each  other. The aliens would stay on earth and the humans  would
go  to the other planet, then return after a specified period  of
time.  The two sides would jointly occupy huge underground  bases
which would be constructed at hidden locations in the Southwest.

 (It  should be noted that the people listed as members of  MJ-12
are  largely  from  the  Council on  Foreign  Relations  and  the
Trilateral Commission. These organizations play a prominent  role
in conspiracy theories of the far right. In a book on the subject
George  Johnson  writes, "After the Holocaust of  World  War  II,
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories became repugnant to all but  the
fringe of the American right. Populist fears of the power of  the
rich  became  focused  instead  on  organizations  that   promote
international capitalism, such as the Trilateral Commission,  the
Council  on Foreign Relations, and the Bilderbergers, a group  of
world  leaders  and businesspeople who held one  of  their  early
conferences on international relations at the Bilderberg Hotel in
the  Netherlands"  [Johnson,  1983].  According  to  Cooper,  the
trilateral emblem is taken directly from the alien flag. He  adds
that  under Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter MJ-12 became  known
as  the  50  Committee. Under Reagan it  was  renamed  the  PI-40
Committee.)
