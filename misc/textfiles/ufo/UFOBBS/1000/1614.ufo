The following announcement appeared on ParaNet and represents a
cooperative effort by the ParaNet Information Service and the
Multinational Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon (MICAP).
All correspondence regarding this project should be directed to
ParaNet/MICAP Headquarters at the InterNet address given below.

Subj: Research Project

We are initiating a research project under MICAP which will outline
the various methods we could use to instrument the UFO phenomena as
it pertains to sightings and potential abduction experiences.  MICAP
has acquired the assistance of a highly qualified NASA engineer,
whom wishes to remain in the background at this time due to
job-related sensitive matters, who has an extensive background in
electronics, exobiology and physics.  Under this project, as yet
un-named, we hope to create a wish list of instruments which may
potentially lead to determing the physical nature of the objects and
possible entities.  As yet, there is a lack of knowledge adequate to
determine what instrumentation can be done, however we want to
extract the relevant data bits from the reports on file to date.

At this point, I would like to ask the cooperation of CUFOS and
UFORA in this  project.

We are in need of all cases that exhibit the following environmental
anomalies:
1)  Gravity effects;
2) Electric (Static) effects;
3) Magnetic effects;
4)  Electromagnetic effects, i.e., Infrared, Ultraviolet, RF Field
Strength.

Additionally, we are interested in incidents where animals and/or
people have been adversely affected by the phenomenon, and any
descriptions associated with the observation which may indicate one
of the above-mentioned anomalies, i.e., coronal discharges,
electrical/static discharges, etc.

Finally, in cases where interruption of a car motor and related
appliances or  devices has been reported, does the observer actually
re-start the appliance  or has the re-start been automatic as if the
motor had been somehow  suspended? I draw attention to a report
contained in The Hynek UFO Report on  Page 206, titled "The Radio
Announcer's Surprise," in which the witness  experienced his car
motor stopping, and then restarting after the object  left.  The
witness reported that he did not have to do anything to restart  the
car, it just restarted by itself.  I also recall in Close Encouters
of  the Third Kind, that the truck Richard Dreyfuss was driving at
the railroad  crossing did the same thing after the object left the
area.  I am assuming  that this is commonplace. If so, are there any
theories on this interaction?

This project shall be coordinated via this conference, and shall be a
cooperative between the aforementioned groups.

Anyone wishing to post papers concerning this are invited to do so
in order to begin a discussion.  We will post the results of our
study for further discussion and input on this project.

If these cases are on electronic format, they can be uuencoded and
transmitted to me via Internet at mcorbin@teal.csn.org.

I am hoping to see your cooperation on this.

Mike
