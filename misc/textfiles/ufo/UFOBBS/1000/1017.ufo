SUBJECT: Alien Abductions by Dr Karla Turner                 FILE: UFO1017

PART 3
     
     A regression session was arranged, and in the course of the
hypnosis, he was asked to look at that childhood experience. What he
recalled was an abduction in which he and his grandmother were taken
to a spacecraft in the company of reptilian aliens. He remembered the
aliens telling his grandmother that they were interested in learning
about her knowledge of medicinal herbs.

     And they offered to exchange medical information of their own.

     They gave the boy and the grandmother a liquid to drink,
explaining that it was beneficial and would make the grandmother
feel young and attractive again.  So both of them drank the liquid,
and the man remembered seeing his grandmother indeed looking much
younger.  That was the extent of his recollection.

     Both he and Ms. Bartholic, who was conducting the regression,
were puzzled by this, because there was nothing in the episode to
account for the guilt he had felt about the grandmother's death.  So
Ms. Bartholic deepened the man's trance level and asked him to look
at it again, with much clearer vision.  And what he then recalled
was much more disturbing.

     That must have been the wrong thing to say, because the
reptilian became very angry and threatened her.  "You will die for
that!" he told her, and the two people were returned to the bedroom
from which they'd been taken.  The next morning, the grandmother
told the little boy that the devil had been there the night before,
and that was when she insisted upon being taken home.  And, as it
turned out, she did die immediately thereafter.

     This, then, was the cause of the man's lifelong sense of guilt
about her death.           CENSORED  (2)                    , and her
death had followed shortly after.  But none of this story would have
emerged if Ms. Bartholic had done as most investigators do and
stopped the regression after uncovering the story about the exchange
of medicinal knowledge.

     There are other cases in our files that show a similar deception
at work in the initial hypnotic recall.  We cannot trust that first
memory, it is clear, for like so much else in the abduction
experience, there may well be further maskings of events.

     Before we allow ourselves to believe in the benevolence of the
alien interaction, we should ask, do enlightened beings need to use
the cover of night to perform good deeds?  Do they need to paralyze
us and render us helpless to resist?  Do angels need to steal our
fetuses?  Do they need to manipulate our children's genitals and
probe our rectums? Are fear, pain and deception consistent with high
spiritual motives?


Encounter Phenomena Defy "Set Pattern"; by Karla Turner.

     It is a myth that alien abductions of humans follow a set
pattern or agenda.  Perhaps the best-known proponent of this theory
is Budd Hopkins, who in his books made the genetics and cross-
breeding scenario familiar to the public.  Yet when you read back
through those books, you'll notice that several of the alien
encounters seem to have very little apparent connection to an
interest in breeding or DNA.  And even Hopkins, in the past couple
of years, has had to expand his theory to include a definite alien
interest in some other things, such as pleasure and pain in humans.

     Other well-known UFO researchers also harbor restrictive
theories about the abduction phenomenon.  Jacques Vallee, David
Jacobs, Whitley Strieber, Brad Steiger, John Lear, Raymond Fowler,
Jenny Randles, Kevin Randle, John Keel and other writers hold a
diversity of intelligent, often ingenious, theories, yet each makes
the same error.  They ignore parts of the abductions evidence--
whatever details don't support their ideas.

INADEQUATE THEORIES.

     Yet it must be clear that any present theory which cannot
account for all the known evidence is not acceptable.  At best, it
can be misleading, especially for victims of abductions who turn to
these prominent researchers seeking answers.

     A case in point occurred during a conversation I had with a
prominent researcher in 1989.  In his lectures, this researcher
always said that he had certain ways of testing the validity of
potential new abduction cases, and one of those ways was the
presence of particular scars on the victims' bodies.  I questioned
him about a different kind of scar, one which I knew often appeared
on abductees of my own acquaintance, and the researcher denied that
such a mark showed up in his cases.
     "Are you sure?" I asked incredulously.  "This mark is pretty
common around here, and I'd think it would show up in other places,
too.  In fact, I know it has.
     "No," he insisted, shaking his head, "the only marks I find are
like the ones I've already described."
     "And this other mark hasn't shown up at all?" I asked.
     "No," he repeated.
     "Not even once?" I persisted.
     "Well," he said reluctantly, lowering his voice, "there have
been a couple of instances.  That child I talked about tonight, she
had two of those marks, and I think there was another case. But
they're so rare that I have to ignore them.  When you have two
hundred cases with Scar A and only two cases with Scar B, you go
with numbers."

     And that was the message he delivered, to an audience where
anxious abductees were made to wonder if their anomalous marks meant
anything after all, or if, as so many of their friends seemed to
think, they were delusions of a troubled mind.

'NO SINGLE PATTERN'.

     In truth, however, although there are recurrent events in the
abduction phenomenon, there is no single pattern or structure.  And
until we know what all the events mean, we can't afford to ignore any
of them.

     What is one to make, for instance, of an ET-human encounter in
which two of the four aliens assisted the abductee in preparing a
roast for dinner?  Granted, other events occurred in this case, but
the dinner was indeed cooked, served and eaten by the abductee's
family less than two hours after the ETs departed.

     Other details of this encounter included the manipulation of the
abductee's neck, "for the purpose of instruction," and a discussion
of genetically-stored memories and knowledge that can be tapped open
in humans.  But there was no medical exam, no cross-breeding
activity, and no warnings of coming catastrophe, all of which are
events that have been used to construct abduction theories.  I know
this to be true, because it happened to me.

HUMAN DUPLICATES.

     Another anomalous event involves the duplication or replacement
of the human by an alien counterpart.  In one instance, a young man
and his fiancee were in their car when a "shimmering force" enveloped
him.  He passed out, but moments later he began to move, acting and
talking entirely different. His fiancee became terrified when he
tried to drag her out into the dark back yard, where he told her
"Something wants to see you there."  And only when a friend drove
into the yard did the young man return to normal, with no memory of
his aberrant behavior during the past ten minutes.

     Under hypnotic regression, the fiancee described the young man
as being kept in the car while the "other one" took his form and
tried to control her.  She called the "other one" a "hologram" and
consistently referred to it as "it," not "him." In fact, she said
she struggled to get away from "it" and back to the car where "the
real" young man was still waiting.

     Under separate regression, the young man recalled his version of
the evening and said that at a certain point he was "turned off" and
"unplugged," yet he couldn't say what sort of power was then
operating his body.
