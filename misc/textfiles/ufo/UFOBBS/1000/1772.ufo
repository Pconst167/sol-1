Subject: Bill Lear (donor unknown) contd
Excerpt #2
===========
     In his book of 1957, entitled, "The Flying Saucer
Conspiracy", Donald Keyhoe also mentioned some rather
indicting news on pages 200-201: "On 2nd February, while
visiting Bogota, Columbia, William P. Lear manufacturer of
aircraft and electronic equipment, told a news conference
that the flying saucers are real". "When Lear's story was
flashed to the United States by the AP, it was a hard blow
for the UFO censors. But this was only the beginning. Within
twenty-four hours Lear amplified his first statement: 'I
feel the flying saucers are real', he said, 'because of four
points'. First, he said, there have been numerous
manifestations over long periods of time. Second, many
observations have been made simultaneously by reliable
observers. Third, there are great possibilities linked with
the theory of gravitational fields. Fourth, there are now
serious efforts in progress to prove the existence of anti-
gravitational forces and to convert atomic energy directly
to electricity". "This new AP story dismayed the Pentagon,
for it could easily disclose our top-secret research to
duplicate the UFO's propulsion. There had already been one
hint despite Pentagon precautions. During a meeting of
aviation leaders in New York, on the 25th of January, G.S.
Trimble, vice-president of advance design for the Glenn L.
Martin Aircraft Company, had made an amazing disclosure...
"Unlimited power, freedom form gravitational attraction, and
infinitely short travel time are now becoming feasible', he
told the press. Then he added that eventually all commercial
air transportation would be in vehicles operating on these
fantastic principles".

Subject: Bill Lear
   Bill Lear, John's dad was totally responsible for the
research and development of "carbon fiber" airplane
construction, or better said both identified and
unidentified flying craft of many types.
   This can explain both his purported "interest" in UFO
vehicles while he was alive, and now his son's widely
distributed "opinion".
   If there are alien vehicles in our governments
possession, Bill Lear most certainly was apprised and was
able to closely inspect them or it. The stealth
helicopter's, fighter's and bomber's airframes and
fuselage/skins etc., are a direct result of Bill Lear's
innovation. Bill Lear's research was made available to
Northrup etc., early in the game. How much does a father
tell a son? In this case it's hard to tell.

     I agree, you're quite right about the tachyons hypothetical structure, 
but my point was not the structure of the particle itself, it was to
illustrate the point that hyper-optical speed IS theoretically possible.

     Maybe I can help you on the freefall toward a large mass....although 
your body would lack "weight" the mass of your body would still fall into
the curved space that represents the planet, whatever.  As your body nears
the large mass, the curvature (gravity) increases, "pulling" you faster. 
Think of it like rolling down a hill.
