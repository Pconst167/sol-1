Hilo, Hawaii - The "solar eclipse" that occurred on may 10, 1994, was not a solar eclipse at all - it was giant UFO passing between the sun and Earth!

That's the shocking news from famed astronomer Dr. Carl Naylors who says it wasn't the moon that blotted out the sun, as we were told, but a huge spaceship from a distant planet called Scanatia.

"To put it plainly, the U.S. and other world powers have pulled off the biggest hoax in history," said Dr. Naylors whose astronomical theories are taught in universities throughout the world.

"A solar eclipse occurs when the moon crosses between Earth and sun, blotting out the sun's rays. But a cursory glance at the moon's orbit shows it wasn't in a position to do that on May 10.

"There was no solar eclipse that day and the world scientific community knows it.

"They also know that for years, Earth's telescopes have been tracking an immense spacecraft from Scanatia, a planet in another galaxy, as it blazes through our solar system.

"Its home solar system is about 200 times the size of ours. Our best guess is that Scanatia is in some kind of trouble and the Scanatians are looking for a new home planet.

"Since our own galaxy is too small to accommodate them comfortably they probably pose no threat to Earth. They'll just keep on going.

"But our world leaders believed that if people learned that a spaceship, carrying thousands of aliens, was passing near us, they would panic.

"So they dreamed up this eclipse hoax to explain what we saw that Tuesday afternoon."

The respected scientist says he's come forward with the story because he believes the world has the right to know the truth.

He vows to keep the public informed on new developments, regardless of how alarming they might be.
