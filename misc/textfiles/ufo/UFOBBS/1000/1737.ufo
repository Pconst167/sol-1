SUBJECT: "MONUMENTS OF MARS: POSSIBLE PBS SHOW               FILE: UFO1737




			A few items of interest.

   I recently became a listener to WIBV, (1260 AM), a Belleville, Illinois
based radio station featuring "talk" radio programs. From 2:00P until 4:00P
they carry a program originating from the Sun Radio Network, Florida, called
FOR THE PEOPLE hosted by Chuck Harder. At first I thought this was just another
talk show until I heard that Richard C. Hoagland author of THE MONUMENTS OF
MARS: A City On The Edge of Forever, was going to be a guest.
   It was a very interesting interview, albeit too short. In essence Hoagland
discussed his recent invitation to speak at the NASA Education Conference and
his amazement at being asked. Apparently NASA has not been particularily open
to his theories. He also discussed a "mini-series" being produced for the
Public Braodcasting System entitled HOAGLAND'S MARS set to air this fall. He
and Harder also talked about something called an "N-Generator" which I know
very little about. They also mentioned the "Sedona Equations". Hoagland ended
by commenting that "they" have had this technology for a long time and it's
time we began to use it. As I said before, this interview was entirely too
short.
   Until recently I didn't know the SUN RADIO NETWORK existed. I am only fa-
miliar with the Harder program, so I can not address any of their other pro-
grams or hosts. But I am impressed with Harder and his program. For those of
us interested in UFOlogy he is a breath of fresh air. Each time the subject is
broached by a caller he is courtesous, interested and obviously very well in-
formed. On several occassions I have heard him discuss Lazar and Gulf Breeze.
Harder has also been instrumental in getting information about the "N-Genera-
tor" into public domain. From what I have been able to glean, this generator
works on magnetic principles, produces more energy than it uses, is based on
the work of a Dr. Bruce DePalma and is currently being manufactured in India.
A patent was applied for in the US but was turned down. The information on
this generator is being distributed in a book published by the SUN RADIO NET-
WORK titled THE FREE ENERGY HANDBOOK (approx. 150 pgs) $11.95 + $2.00 p&h.

			       TAKE ACTION

   HOAGLAND'S MARS is in its final stage of production. Call your local Public
Braodcasting System, find out if they have it scheduled.  If not, REQUEST IT.
[As an aside, our station in St. Louis, KETC, recently aired a program titled
LIFE ON ICE: ANTARCTICA AND MARS. It was excellent. It focused on the similar-
ities of Earth and Mars; the fact that Mars has liquid water, was once volcanic
and most likely will show to have the same primary life forms as earth had 3.5
billion years ago and still has in Antarctica. HOAGLAND'S MARS and LIFE ON ICE
make a compelling argument for life on Mars. As long as your asking...ask them
for both programs!!]

				  AND

   Call your local "talk radio" station(s). Tell them you want them to carry
the FOR THE PEOPLE program. Call Harder at: 800-878-8255, make your interest
in UFOs known.
