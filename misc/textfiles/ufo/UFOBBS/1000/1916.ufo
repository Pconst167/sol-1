Rash of murders baffles NM town (Excerpts)

By Gordon Dickson

ROSWELL -- There seems to be no simple answer to the question that plagues
Roswell: Why has our little town become so violent? Thirteen people were slain
in the city last year, almost twice the national average for similar sized
cities.  And last week, police found six members of a Roswell family dead in an
APPARENT multiple murder-suicide.   "I'm loathe to put some kind of explination
to it -- I'm not sure you can say economic problems are causing it," said
Latham Winfree, director of the criminal justice dept. at NMSU.  .... Roswell
has one of the highest unemployed rates in S. New Mexico....   Police believe
Ernie Lasiter Sr., 41 strangled and smotherd five family members, then shot
himself to death after he became suspected of sexually abusing his 17 year old
daughter.  .... Ernie was found dead hours later at a shooting range.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could these increased murders be attached to people who witnissed the crash at
Roswell?  Maybe Lasiter or some of the other thirteen were other cases, but
what about some of them? Can someone find out if Lasiter knew anything? Or if
someone could get a listing of the names on the list of the 13 and match them
to witnises. Who knows.... Just wondering....
