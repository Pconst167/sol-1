Andorra, Spain - Space aliens are appearing in the hospital rooms for dying children, gently touching their foreheads - and healing them of terminal cancer!

That's the incredible report from 14 highly respected doctors and staff members at Pyrenees Hospital de Los Ninos who have seen the four-foot extraterrestrials work their magic on four terminally ill youngsters in the course of a month.

"I couldn't believe my eyes," said night nurse Lupe Montoya, who was working on the oncology wing of the noted children's hospital during the aliens' first visit.

"I was filling out reports when I looked up and saw two small creatures moving toward me down the corridor. At first I thought two of the kids were out of their beds so I got up to take them back to their rooms.

"But when I approached them, I saw they weren't human. They were a brownish color with big heads and large almond-shaped eyes. They were like nothing found on this planet.

"I was afraid because they looked so weird. But at the same time I sensed a kind, loving intelligence in those strange eyes."

Nurse Montoya says the creatures went into the room of 7-year-old Juan Lopez, who was expected to die of leukemia within a week. She alerted security guards and called for Dr. Tomas Ruiz who was on the ward caring for another patient.

"When we walked into little Juan's room it was bathed in a bright golden light," says Dr. Ruiz. "The aliens were standing by his bedside. There seemed to be a mystical bond between them and the boy.

"One of the beings gently touched Juan's forehead with its long finger and he was instantly surrounded by a glowing aura."

"When the aliens left the hospital, doctors X-rayed and examined Juan.
He was completely free of cancer."

Since that evening, Maria Munoz, 9, Anita Pena, 8, and Hector Gomez, 9 - all of them diagnosed as terminal - have also been cured by the space creatures. And 14 staff members have seen the beings perform the miracles.

"There's a pattern to these visits, says Dr. Ruiz. "They always occur around 1 a.m., the aliens always come in pairs and they always heal with a touch to the forehead."

Dr. Dego Garcia, famed metaphysician who's been researching space alien sightings for 30 years, says the Pyrenees Mountains have long been known for lots of UFO activity.

"We've always believed that when aliens finally reveal themselves to Earth it will be in this area.

"Maybe they've begun to introduce themselves with this astounding goodwill gesture."
