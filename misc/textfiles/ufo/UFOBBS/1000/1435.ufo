     Gran Angell, MUFON-NC, Inc. Treasurer reported that we
had $184.00 on deposit but that this amount did not include
any new memberships and donations collected at the Charlotte
meeting, nor expenses incurred at the same, as this
information was not yet available.
     In opening the program part of the agenda, State
Director Fawcett stated that we had approximately 174 in
attendence at the meeting and some had to be turned away due
to the crowded meeting room. It was also noted that a PA
system was badly needed for future meetings also.
     The first speaker of the day was Wayne Laporte (Indian
Trail) who spoke and showed slides covering the topic
"Dimensionalism." Laporte pursued the theory that many (but
not all) UFO sightings are triggered by seismic energy
created by fault line activity and that such events cound not
only cause electromagnetic effects on soil, animals, machines
but in some cases can cause hallucinations concerning
occupant encounters.
     The second speaker was George Fawcett III (Lincolnton)
who gave an update on recent and upcoming books, T.V.
documentaries, symposiums, movies, ect. Fawcett chose for his
topic "An Update on England's Crop Circles" where he outlined
some of the morepuzzeling ones of over 800 found in England
in recent years. He also noted that similiar reports recently
have come from Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada, Kansas,
Florida and North Carolina. Some involved UFO's.
     Intermission came next with a selection of good food and
light drinks and was highlighted by a presentation of a
MUFON-NC, Inc. "First Anniversary" cake provided by Gail
Feilke, who designed and baked it for the meeting.
     Following the intermission period, a large number of
door prizes were given to the lucky persons, whose names were
drawn. A large number of printed handouts, which included
book lists, meeting notices, resource listings, questionars,
membership forms, UFO quizes, officer listings were also
distributed.
     Fawcett next thanked Robert Hair for his presentation of
a MUFON-NC, Inc. gavel to the organization and passed around
the engraved gavel to the audience to inspect.
     The thisd speaker of the day was Ginger Richardson
(Charlotte) whose topic "The John Lear Story, The Greys, Us
and Alien Bases" proved to be both interesting and
controversial. Richardson covered the hypothesis that our
government has agreements withe creatures from outer space.
Our government allegedly gets advances technical knowledge
in exchange for harmless medical experiments on humans. The
USA-ALIEN pact apparently has been violated by these
creatures, who have proceeded to abduct humans for food and
impregnate women to create hybrid offspring, ect.
     The fourth speaker was Mark Blashar (MUFON-Va. State
Director from Manakin-Sabot) who told of "Updated UFO Events
From Virginia." Blashar noted an increase of reports in
Virginia and told of auto chases, occupant encounters,
missing time experiences, radar interferences. These cases
involved domed discs, manta ray, and diamond-shaped objects.
     The fifth speaker was Dr. Steven Greer (Ashville) who
feels there is a real chance for bilateral exchange
(communications). Dr. Greers thesis and talk "The CE5
Initative" was well received also. He feels that humans must
extinguish destructive behavior like war, before alien
contacts can begin. They are seeing such contacts themselves,
but are cautious of their oun security as well. Case in
point: Father Gill "waving hands" contact in New Guinea, also
car "blinking lights" responses elsewhere.
     A reminder by Fawcett that after the meeting, members
and guests would ajourn and meet at a nearby Shoney's for
food and further questions came next.
     The five hour meeting came to an end after the showing
of a 52 minute video film entilted "UFOs: A Scientific
Enigma", produced by the MUFON-Mass. organization and
provided by Danny Barger of Lincolnton.
