Excerpt from:  For the People
Sun Radio Network
heard on affiliate KROL-AM Radio, Las Vegas, Nevada
12/[14 ]/89, 10 :00 am - 1:00 p.m.

Chuck Harder:
T.J., hello!

TJ:
I have a couple questions regarding Mr. Lazar and Mr. Knapp, whom
I'm associated with here in Las Vegas.

Harder:
Bless your heart!

TJ:
I originally heard that that was going to be aired today.  I seem
to think you have some kind of difficulty getting it on?

Harder:
The  bottom  line  is,  as you know, Bob  Lazar  does  a  lot  of
traveling, and trying to get him to a telephone and get it hooked
up to us seems to be a problem.  And we hope that he will be able
to get to a pay phone where he would feel comfortable or a  phone
where  he would feel comfortable and call the 800 number.  And  I
hope we'll be able to get him on.

TJ:
Oh, so you still are going to air that today?

Harder:
We're working on it.  I was just talking to George on the  break,
and  we're trying to get hooked up with Bob.  We have a bit of  a
problem  because there's so many doggoned many 800  lines  coming
in,  what we may have to do is screen them and apologize  to  the
people who are calling 'cause we're looking for Bob, okay?

TJ:
That makes sense.

I'm a very good listener to your program through George.  I would
like information to get "For the People," your subscription every
month.

Harder:
Write  to  us;  enclose  a check for  $15.   We're  a  non-profit
organization,  so part of that is income tax deductible,  and  we
send out a circular telling you how much; I think quite a bit  of
it  is if you itemize.  Send it to For the People, P.O. Box  101,
Cedar Key, FL  32625.

The next issue of our magazine will be very, very heavy into  the
UFO issue with some closeup color photos of what Bob Lazar  calls
the Sport Model.

TJ:
Right.  I'm familiar with that.

If I were to subscribe within the next couple of days, would I be
able to get that particular issue?

Harder:
Yes,  but  we'll  also  print some extras,  so  we'll  have  them
available.

TJ:
I  heard  you  and Mr. Andrus speaking  about  cattle  and  human
comparison in blood.  The only misstatement I heard -- I've  done
some  research  into this along with these guys --  from  what  I
understand,  in a government emergency, the cattle's blood  would
be  transferred  and  made into PLASMA so it could  be  used  for
humans,  a  direct  transfusion.   The  chromosomes  are   almost
identical in makeup.  And they can turn cow's blood into a plasma
for humans, but that would be it.

Harder:
That's pretty neat, isn't it?

TJ:
Yeah, absolutely.

These  little  guys  are  coming down and  picking  them  up  and
examining them.

Harder:
Other  people  say that the cow "squeezings," if  you  please  --
their  squeezing  a cow like we would squeeze an  orange  --  are
utilized as nourishment.

TJ:
Yeah,  they  make  an enzyme and spread it  upon  themselves  and
absorb it because their digestive systems are atrophied.   That's
information supplied by Mr. Lear, and I would assume some of that
through Bob also.

Mr.  Andrus of MUFON doesn't want to claim that they  know  where
the "greys" are from, but yet this information is pretty  readily
available  out  here in the Southwest.  They're  supposedly  from
Reticulum  4, just from Zeta Reticuli, just 37 light  years  from
the planet Earth.

Harder:
Walt  Andrus is a fine, fine gentleman, and you  understand  he's
extremely conservative.

TJ:
Oh,  I  understand that.  I didn't really even want  to  misstate
myself  there.  But I guess just being involved with  these  guys
down  here where we've got all this stuff going on so close  that
sometimes I expect everybody else to have the same information.

Harder:
I'm  glad  you're passing it on and I welcome  this  information.
The thing that we're trying to do right now -- and I'll just come
out  and  tell you -- we're trying to make sure  that  the  other
media has the information.  When George Knapp and I spoke for abo
ut  an hour, we transcribed it, and the transcriptions have  been
requested by several different people in the media.

And  this  morning, I even FAXed the transcription to  the  front
page editor of the Wall Street Journal because not only did  they
want it but George will readily admit, as I'm sure would Bob, and
yours truly, that we want them to have it for our own protection.
Because I feel I've dug a little bit too deep.

TJ:
Oh yeah, I'm sure. I'm surprised George hasn't been hassled  more
than he has because he's at the forefront of the media with  most
of  this  [relevant] information.  He's done an  outstanding  job
here locally.

Harder:
Well, I understand that George has had his own problems.  And  he
has told me what I feel what might be a tip of the iceberg.   And
he was on the air with us yesterday.

But  I  feel that for the protection of Bob Lazar and  of  George
Knapp  and   KLAS-TV and everybody else who's  been  involved,  I
think that the rest of America needs to know.

TJ:
Oh absolutely.  I've even been out to this area -- the Area 51 --
on   [viewing  it  from]  public  land,  and  observed  --   from
information  from George -- on where to go, where to  stand,  and
when to stand to see these things when they were testing them out
there before they moved them.

And he's right on the money!  They were there!  They're no longer
there, but they WERE there.  They moved them deeper into the Test
Site  to  an area called Area 10, to the best of  my  information
through a couple of MY sources out at the Nevada Test Site.

Harder:
Where are the aliens now?

TJ:
Aliens?  I  can't tell you.  I don't know anything  about  aliens
from  what I'm seeing.  I'm talking about the recovered  material
that  they had at S-4 out at Area 51 -- the disks.  But the  best
of our information at this point is that was moved from that area
and deeper into a site, deeper into the Test Site that they  call
Area 10.

So  it's  just because it got to the point that  when  they  were
running the tests, they had everybody locally interested in  UFOs
at  one point; I mean they even chartered buses and drove  up  to
the area to stand on public land and wait to watch for the tests.

Obviously, the Governmment got a little upset at that.  And  they
shut  the highways down, as a matter of fact, which  is  probably
not  public  information.  They shut down two highways  that  run
right by the Test Site, for a weekend.  One was Highway 375;  the
other  was Highway 318; and they shut them completely  down,  and
they  did a massive amount of moving in that area at  that  time.
They were using diesel trucks marked with Piggly Wiggly and  some
other supermarket chains to transfer a lot of their equipment.

Harder:
Why won't they tell us, TJ?

TJ:
It  depends on whose line you really want to believe.  I've  been
investigating  since  1980,  and not that I'm that  crack  of  an
investigator.   I  am a police officer.  I have  learned  how  to
investigate.  But Mr. Lear probably has a pretty good  foundation
on  a lot what's going on.  A lot of people don't choose or  care
to believe what he's saying.

Harder:
His  material,  by the way, will be in our next magazine  --  his
public material.

TJ:
Great!   I'm  sure  that it's going to startle a  lot  of  people
because  if  you subscribe to Mr. Lear's line  of  thought,  then
we're  in a lot of serious trouble.  It's to the point  that  the
Government,  and the Government has no control over what's  going
on,  and  they made a false treaty with them, because  they  knew
they were going to go ahead and do what they wanted to do anyway.
And  I guess we were trying to make some technology advances  out
of it, and our government got greedy again at that point.

And  I'm  sure -- I don't want to step on Mr. Lazar  or  George's
information  -- I'm sure they're going to want to get this  stuff
out about when they had a conflict out here.  Mr. Lazar allegedly
replaced  a  scientist that was killed by the aliens out  at  the
Test Site; and that's how he got involved in the program.  But  I
don't  know a lot about that myself; I can only go by  what  I've
been  told by these guys; and I'm sure they want to elaborate  on
that.

Harder:
Well,  the  information  has reached us  from  many,  many,  many
different  sources,  from people who want no money.   They  don't
even  want to be identified.  And they have no reason to give  us
the  information, and yet from 10, 15, 20, 30 different  sources,
we get the same information.

First  of all, we thought it was rumor and it was the same  story
going  around.  We tried to track it down further, and  we  found
out, no, it wasn't the same story.  So it's fascinating.

TJ:
It's definitely that.  And living this close to whatever  they've
got  going  on  out at the Test Site where  they're  testing  the
disks, it's pretty phenomenal to be able to --

Even  at  one  point earlier in the year,  I  mean  they  stopped
testing  out  there, as far as anybody could  tell,  probably  in
September,  because it just got too public at that  point.   Even
August may have been the last tests.

But we -- there was a group of people -- in fact, I was out there
with a photojournalist that got some photos one of the nights  we
were out there.

We had them developed, and you can't see disks, but what you  can
see  are  orange tracers in the sky -- I  mean  pretty  elaborate
orange  tracers from the fact that this thing MOVED over quite  a
distance during just the snapping in the shutter.  It left bright
orange  streaks across the photographs.  It's pretty  interesting
stuff.

Harder:
The  abductions, I think, are something that's going to  get  the
attention of America.  Why they are taking us.  Where I live, the
synchronicity  of the incidents is very, very fascinating.   Just
recently,  we  had a family disappear.  They were  camping  on  a
little  island  out  in the Gulf  of  Mexico;  they  disappeared.
Everything was found but them.

We  had a commercial fisherman disappear; a lot of fishermen  are
afraid to go out in ther Gulf.

Not  too far north of here we had other people disappear.   We've
had cattle mutilations right nearby.  So there's been a lot going
on.   And  a  tremendous amount of UFO sightings, and  a  lot  of
little  newspapers  around here have run articles  about  strange
lights in the sky.  You know, afraid to run the article, but they
just had to run them.  So they ran them with, "Gee, what's  going
on?  What is that?  We don't know.  Nobody will tell us."

And you start clipping these things and you put them all together
and you go, what's going on?

TJ:
Once  you  get  into researching,  it's  blatantly  obvious  that
there's  something going on.  It leaves you no room for any  type
of  doubt that there actually are some type  of  extraterrestrial
visitors here.  The evidence is overwhelming.

Other than the fact that if we were to send a flying saucer  down
on  the lawn of the White House, it's going to take an awful  lot
to  get  the Government to admit anything.  They're  so  involved
they've  got their hands bloodied over the whole thing.   There's
been  people disappear, people even murdered over all  this.   So
it's  obvious  that they're not going to come clean on  it.   The
issue  is  going to have to be forced.  There's no other  way  to
look at it.  That's my opinion.

Harder:
TJ, thanks for calling up.
