 ----------------------------------------
Two pilots reported observing while they were flying over Snoqualamie
Pass two amber spheres coming their way.  The pilots said that they
were on a collision course with these two objects and went into evasive
action to avoid the collision.  After the pilots had leveled off,
two objects turned around and started to follow their plane.  The
pilot tried to use his radio and said it was unoperative due to heavy
static.  The pilot described that one object was on one side of the
wing and one on the other.  The objects then accelerated at phenomenal
speeds heading due west in the direction of Seattle at which time
the pilot's radio became operative again.  The pilot, Shawn Kiaer,
was accompanied by an instructor.

 Report #: 89

  Subject: PAYNE FIELD, WA          

CASE TYPE:   LRS - NL    
     DATE:   1 MARCH 1986

 ---------------------------------------------
Saturday evening March 1, 1986 at approximately 8:30 P.M. the CUFON -
UFO Information Service in Seattle, Washington and the National UFO
Reporting Center started receiving calls of a UFO sighting in the
direction of Payne Field.  Witnesses said that they had spotted these
objects while driving on Interstate 5 near the north side of Mountlake
Terrace.  The witnesses described that the objects were large in size,
although they could only see large lights.  When questioned further,
they said the objects were the size of a quarter at arms length.
The witnesses said that there were nine objects total. They also said
that small white and blue objects were dropping out of some of the
larger objects but did not hit the ground, instead headed for the
north at fast rates of speed.  When asked how many witnesses altogether
there were, the witness described that he had counted fifteen cars
pulled off to the side of the freeway observing the UFO's.  The total
duration of the sighting was about 30 minutes.  The larger objects
were then seen heading north also in formation. At exactly 11:00 P.M.
all three news networks in Seattle, Washington gave their account
of the sighting.  All three had a different story.  One explanation
given was that FAA said that Payne Field was having aerial maneuvers.
Another station said they called Payne Field and they stated it was
possibly balloons. The next day after the sighting, CUFON called Payne
Field and talked with Sargent Tinsley-Army Opera- tions.  She checked
flight records for that evening and said that there were no military
maneuvers going on at Payne Field at the date and time of the sighting.
She also stated that most of the time they do not have maneuvers going
on after 9:00 P.M. because of noise levels. This is a highly residential
area also.
 
By coincidence there was a head on collision with two small single
engine aircraft two weeks prior to this sighting.  Two witnesses observed
two planes colliding overhead in the Black Diamond, Washington area.
The witnesses described the plane exploding in the air on impact then
watched the small plane head towards the ground.  They said the other
plane then went on its own way.  Although the witnesses said there
were two planes, none of them were able to describe it accurately
and the plane that departed was never found.  Two days later after
the incident, a helicopter that was leased by photographers for National
Geographics was found crashed.  The photographers were found dead
in the helicopter near Mount Saint Helens. The reckage was found on
flat ground with no reasonable explanation according to FAA.
 
CUFON contacted FAA investigator to find out if they had any details
on both accidents.  The FAA investigator told CUFON that the helicopter
may have had a "whiteout".  When asked about the mid air collision
with the two single engine aircraft, the FAA investigator said he
didn't believe there was another plane involved.  This meant that
he was disregarding the testimony of the witnesses. As to this date,
there has been no wreckage found of the second aircraft.
