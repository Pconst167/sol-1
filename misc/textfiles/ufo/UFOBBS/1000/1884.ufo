SUBJECT: BILL COOPER SPEECH: WHOLE LIFE EXPO                 FILE: UFO1884



Fellow computer enthusiasts,        11-24-89

  What follows is a transcript of a 45 minute lecture that I at-
tended on 11-17-89 at the "Whole Life Expo." in Los Angeles,
California. Speaking was Mr. Milton William Cooper who I first
became acquainted with through a text file I downloaded from a
local computer BBS. The file dealt with the subject of UFO's and
our government's concealment of the truth about them in such a
way that it made a lasting impression on me, which is why I
attended his lecture; to learn more. Please forgive my probable
misspelling of some of the proper names in the transcript which
follows and allow that I have taken it as best I could, word-
for-word, from a less than acceptable micro-cassette recording.
  If you are as moved by what you are about to read as I was in
hearing it first hand, I ask that you please spread it as far
and wide as possible. Upload it to every BBS in your reach and
please, don't change anything. Also, please give considerable
thought to Mr. Cooper's suggestions as to what we all can do to
see that this information is confirmed by our government to make
them stop what they are up to.
     Thank you, and now, Milton Cooper:

  "For those of you who don't know who I am, I was raised in a
military family. My family, my ancestors, since they came to
this country, have been government people. We have served in the
military, we have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,
we care about this country and believe in the constitution of
the United States. We know, as many people don't know, that the
Constitution of the United States of America IS the United
States of America! And that's why we've always been ready ...to
do the things needed ...to preserve and protect it."
  "When I left home I went into the Air Force, the Strategic Air
Command. As a child I'd heard stories from my father and pilots,
other pilots, my father was a pilot, about Foo Fighters, UFO's,
strange craft that were not made on this Earth. And as a kid,
you hear that in passing, and it's neat, and you giggle about
it, and you go out and play "Space Man", and you forget it."
  "When I was in the Air Force I met men who had participated in
alien crashed-craft recoveries. Now this intrigued me, it in-
terested me, but it was usually after quite a few bottles of
beer that these stories would come out, and sometimes the next
morning I couldn't remember what the heck the guy said."
  "When I left the Air Force I went into the Navy, and this is
where everything began to happen for me. I had originally inten-
ded to just go from service to service and do something that
very few people have ever done before. I was a very adventurous,
very crazy ...young man, and I thought that that would be a
pretty exciting life. I volunteered for submarines, and while on
the submarine U.S.S. Tyroot, SS-416, on a transit between the
Portland/Seattle area and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port;
the Pearl Harbor sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft,
saucer-shaped, the size of a Midway class carrier, aircraft
carrier, for those of you who don't know how big that is; it's
huge, come up out of the water approximately 2 1/2 nautical
miles off the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left of
the pointy end of the submarine. It tumbled slowly on its own
axis, and went up into the clouds. It appeared to be moving
slowly to me at a distance of 2 1/2 nautical miles, but in
reality it was moving pretty fast because it came up out of the
water, did a few tumbles and it was gone!"
  "I then reported it to the officer of the deck. I didn't tell
him what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no
fools and in case nobody else saw it I didn't want to be the
only looney onboard the ship. So I asked the officer of the deck
to help me cover that area, and he did, which is common for of-
ficers and lookouts to help each other while on bridge watch be-
cause they all hang together if something bad happens. After a
few seconds of watching, the same craft, or another craft exact-
ly like it, came down out of the clouds, tumbled again on its
own axis, and went into the water. Ensign Ball, who was the of-
ficer of the deck, was literally shocked! What could I say? Sea-
man Dejeralimo, who was the starboard lookout, had also witnes-
sed this, and ensign Ball called the captain to the bridge who
was followed by the chief quartermaster who brought a 35MM cam-
era, and we watched for between 7 and 10 minutes the same craft,
or different craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave
the water. It was an incredible show. I don't know if they knew
we were there, or if they even cared, but the craft did not
glow, they were metal, they were machines without a doubt, they
were obviously intelligently guided, they were HUGE, and having
been in the Air Force and the Navy and knowing what it takes, I
knew without a doubt, and know it today, that that machine was
not made on the face of this Earth. Because there's nothing that
man can make, that can fly through the air at a speed like that,
tumble on its own axis, and enter the water and effectively fly
beneath the sea."
  "If you've ever been aboard an airplane and then gone aboard a
submarine, I know there's probably some of you in this room who
have visited a submarine at one time or another, you can readily
see just without even any of the technicalities involved how
difficult such a thing would be to do. Where would it be built,
that size? It was absolutely incredible. It changed my life
because then all the stories that I'd heard all my life I knew
were true, and I began seeing the world in a different light."
  "It wasn't long after that I was trained by Naval security in
intelligence. I was sent to Viet Nam. I was assigned as a patrol
boat captain, first in DaNang harbor, given a crew, given a
multi-million dollar patrol boat. My job was to gather intel-
ligence from the people who lived around the harbor and the
fishermen who transited the harbor, and maintain the safety and
security of the harbor and the shipping. After about 5-months I
was sent up North to the DMZ, to a place called Qua Vieaf [sp],
on the Tacan [sp] river. Our base camp was at the river mouth.
We were only 3-miles South of the North Vietnamese border and
our job was to patrol the Tacan river from the river mouth to
Dang Ha [sp], and then up the Quang Tree [sp] cutoff to Quang
Tree city, again to get to know the people on the bank, gather
intelligence, and to patrol every night and maintain the safety
and security of the river and the river traffic."
  "It was while there that I discovered that there was a tremen-
dous amount of UFO and alien activity in Viet Nam. It was always
reported in official messages as `enemy helicopters.' Now any of
you who know anything about the Viet Nam war know that the North
Vietnamese did not have any helicopters, especially after our
first couple of air raids into North Viet Nam. Even if they had
they would not have been so foolish as to bring them over the
DMZ because that would have insured their demise. Our troops
were fired on occasionally by these `enemy helicopters,' enemy
troops were fired on occasionally by these `enemy helicopters,'
and occasionally people would disappear. And on one instance
that I know for sure at least one entire village disappeared one
night due to alien activity. The reason they used the term
`enemy helicopters' in messages and dispatches was that in Viet
Nam you could be overrun at any time, no matter where you where.
They did not bring crypto encoding equipment into Viet Nam, I'm
talking about the machinery. What we did is we had crypto tab-
les, and once we every 24-hours those codes would be no good. So
that's what we used. We also, because of the inability to use
crypto transmitting equipment, had to devise code words such as
`enemy helicopters.'"
  "When I left Viet Nam I was eventually attached to the head-
quarters staff of the Commander in Chief of the United States
Pacific Fleet at Macalappa, [sp] Hawaii, which is a little hill
overlooking Pearl Harbor, it's a beautiful white building up
there, and I was specifically attached to the Intelligence
Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States
Pacific Fleet."
  "It was during this tour of duty that, in the course of my
duties, documents were placed in my hands that were so unbeliev-
able and so incredible that it took me quite a while to adjust
to the fact that what I was seeing was real. Now for those of
you who don't understand how I could come to see this informa-
tion let me give you a little short course in security clearance
and "the need to know" and how you get to see classified infor-
mation if you're in the military or in the government, it does-
n't matter which, the rules are the same."
  "Number one you need a security clearance, and you've got to
have clearance at the level that the information you want to see
is classified at. In this instance it was classified `Top Sec-
ret, Magic, Restricted Information,' which I came to find out
later is the highest security classification in the Nation. To
get that type of clearance, all you have to have is a Federal
Bureau of Investigation background check, which takes about six
months and they send federal agents to your home, to your old
schools, to all your teachers, to your friends, to everybody you
put down on your security clearance forms, to all your old ad-
dresses, your neighbors, everybody that you've worked for, and
it's embarrassing because they don't tell them what they're
checking on. They just show them their identification and start
asking questions and that's when you find out who's your friend
and who's not, because a lot of people get scared and think,
`Bill just robbed a bank and I'm not talkin' to him anymore.'"
  "Now once you get that it's called a `B.I.' and for those of
you who have received a copy of my service record look on the
first page, the DD-214 where it says `Security Clearance,' you
will see the term `B.I.' That's a `Bureau of Investigation'
clearance. Now at that point, you have the clearance for every-
thing including Top Secret and above. What determines what you
get to see is your need to know, and the job that you have de-
termines what your need to know is."
  "I was assigned to the Intelligence Briefing Team of the Com-
mander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, who had to
know everything concerning his area of operations which was one-
half of the Earth's surface; the Indian ocean, the Pacific
ocean, and all the land masses in between. Believe it or not, if
we go to war, if we ever go to war, it's the United States Navy
that strikes the first blow and attempts to keep the enemy at
bey while we can get ourselves together, at least historically.
Nuclear weapons have kind of done away with that concept, but
military commanders like to talk about it anyway."
  "Because of this, and you have no conception of the amount of
material and information that an area commander has to know,
it's unbelievable, and he has to keep track of this, he has to
keep on top of it. He has to know what's happening, he has to
make the right decisions. Because it's almost humanly impossible
for anyone to do that, they have what's called a briefing team,
and it's our job to make sure that he has the correct informa-
tion, all the time, on a 24-hour basis. And every morning, be-
tween 8 and 9 AM, we would give a briefing which covered every-
thing that happened in the previous 24-hours, and everything
scheduled to happen in the next 24-hours, and all the pertinent
intelligence reports that we had received since the last brief-
ing that he needed to know and that his staff members needed to
know. Occasionally we would get messages marked `Top Secret,
Magic, Restricted Information,' and it would be coded in such a
way that all you had were answers to questions which you didn't
know what the questions were so you really didn't know what the
message was all about."
  "But eventually I found myself in possession, holding two
documents; one called `Project Grudge,' another one called `Op-
eration Majority.' Project Grudge contained the history of alien
involvement since around 1936, and it began talking about
Germany's involvement with a crashed-disk that they had reco-
vered in 1936 and were attempting to duplicate the technology.
They were not successful despite what all these Nazi hunters
want to tell you. If they had been successful, we would not have
won the war, because you cannot beat those weapons! You cannot
outfly those craft, you can't even think about it with conven-
tional aircraft. If Germany had been successful, we would now
have a German flag up in front of this podium."
  "They did make some headway. When we went into Punta Mundy
[sp] we captured documents, we got some scientists, we got some
hardware. The Russians also got some documents, some scientists,
and some hardware. It wasn't until 1947 that we were able to
capture a craft, a whole craft, not all together but it was
everything. And that occurred near the city of Roswell, New
Mexico. There were dead aliens recovered from the craft. In Pro-
ject Grudge I saw photographs of these dead aliens, of the
craft, I saw photographs of live aliens, I saw photographs of
autopsies, internal organs, I saw photographs of the alien des-
ignated `E.B.'[or Ebe] which was held in captivity from 1949 un-
til June the 2nd, 1952 when he died. I saw the history of what
they had been able to at that time put together, from incidents
in the 1800's which involved aliens and their craft."
  "I saw the names of projects. I saw a project that was to fly
recovered alien craft that had been recovered intact and undam-
aged, and some of them were recovered intact and undamaged, and
how that happened I have no idea. It was called `Project Red-
light,' and first was conducted from the Tonopah test range in
the Nevada test sight and then was moved to a specially built
area, ordered built by president Eisenhower, called `Area-51,'
code named `Dreamland,' in the Groom [sp] dry lake area of the
Nevada test sight, by secret executive order. It doesn't exist
officially, if you ask anyone, or if you write letters to the
government they will tell you it doesn't exist. However if you
go out there at several places and see it, fly outside the
boundaries and look down and see it, you know it's there, but
according to the government it doesn't exist."
  "The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until
sometime in 1962 when a craft blew up not far from the test
sight, in the air, and the explosion was seen over a three-state
area. The pilots were killed, they had no idea what had happened
or why the craft blew up, but they put Project Redlight on hold
until a later date when the aliens supplied us with 3-craft and
personnel to help us learn how to fly these craft. That project
is ongoing and we now have not only alien craft that we are fly-
ing, we have craft we have built, using the captured technology,
and some of the UFO's that people report seeing in the United
States, and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by United States
personnel."
  "That may come as a shock to you. We have technology way be-
yond the limits of what we have been told. A lot of our develop-
ment technologically, since the end of World War II, has been
due to the exchange of technology which occurs in the area
called `Area-51' on a regular basis ...ongoing."
  "When James Oberth, professor Oberth retired, many of you
don't know who he is ...not too many space people in here. Pro-
fessor Oberth was probably one of the greatest rocket scientists
and space commentists that ever lived. When he retired, the gov-
ernment gave him a special award, there was a press conference,
all kinds of ceremony, and when he got up to speak he said,
`Gentlemen,' and I quote professor Oberth, he said, `Gentlemen,
we cannot take credit for all the technological developments
that we have had in the last decade. We have had help,' and
that's where he stopped."
  "One of the reporters raised his hand and said, `Professor
Oberth, can you tell us what other country helped us?'"
  "He said, `It was those little guys from out in space,' and
then he got down and and would not comment any further. Now this
occurred in 1959. I can go on and on but time doesn't allow it."
  "I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds
of things going on all the time, we are making rapid progress in
exposing this. Since I have begun talking, people have been com-
ing out of the woodwork at a rapid rate, who know and have
pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it together,
because I don't have all the answers. I saw an awful lot of ma-
terial, I have remembered an awful lot of it, I have probably,
in my remembering, made some mistakes, and I guarantee you
they're minor ones, if I have."
  "We have just recently, for those of you who didn't believe
that the Jason Society of the Jason Scholars, the secret group
existed, we now have a letter from the Pentagon, with 51 names
of the Jason Scholars, an admission from the Pentagon that they
hold the highest security clearances in the nation, an admission
from the Pentagon that they hold the protocol rank of Rear Ad-
miral, and are treated as such on any military installation or
in any government office. There are 6 Nobel Prize winners on
that list, there are the elite of the elite of the scientific
world, they are the only ones who really know the truth about
the technology today and about the real science of physics, be-
cause the one that we're being taught all the time... If you
send your kids to college to learn physics you're wasting your
money because they're teaching them stuff that doesn't work,
it's not true, it's not real. Gravity is not what we think it
is. There IS a Unified Theory! We already know what it is, it's
what makes these craft work. It's absolutely incredible what's
going on."
  "How many of you keep up with Billy Goodman's show on KVEG out
of Las Vegas? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning in
on any night between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM. It's 840 on your AM
dial, and the subject every night are those subjects that no
other media person in the United States will touch with a 10-
foot pole, every single night except Saturday night. It's the
only show that you can call in and talk to another caller,
you've got 3-minutes to say whatever you want to say as long as
you don't cuss or swear or slander anyone, and every night
they're helping to expose this."
  "When John Lear and I first said what was going on out at
Groom Lake everybody said, `You're nuts, there's nothing going
on out at Groom Lake!' The listeners of the Billy Goodman radio
show put together an excursion and went up to Groom Lake and
they all, ever since, every night, they go up there and watch
them test fly the alien craft ...every night! The first night
they had 100 people there. And 100 people saw 4 alien craft fly,
doing things that no airplane and no helicopter can do. Now they
don't tell us anymore that there's nothing happening at Groom
Lake. What they tell us now is there's no such thing as aliens,
it's all government secret projects. That's okay because we'll
prove that wrong too eventually, it just takes awhile. Because
where we WERE ...it's not where we're AT, and I'm really happy
about that."
  "Now, if you want to see what's happening right now, keep
watching your movies, keep watching your television commercials,
your alien programs on television, read Whitley Streeper's
`Majestic' which is a part of the contingency plan called `Ma-
jestic' to test the reaction of the population to the presence
of aliens on the Earth. And I have just finished my study of
Whitley Streeper's book `Majestic,' and I'm gonna tell you right
now that most of the documents in there, that he says are fic-
tion, are real documents that came right out of Project Grudge.
It is part of the government's campaign to leak information out
in ways that they can always deny that it's real. There's only
one thing wrong with the information in that book, the stories
of the characters in there I know nothing about. What I'm talk-
ing about are the supposed government documents that he has in
that book. I'm telling you tonight they're real. Those are some
of the same documents that I saw in Project Grudge back between
1970 & 1973, and where we have wondered before, now we know that
Whitley Streeper IS working for the government. And we had a
suspicion anyway because in the front of his book he states that
he got information and was helped by the research team of Moore,
Shanderey, and Friedman. William Moore has publicly admitted on
July the 1st that he is an agent of the United States Govern-
ment, and we know that the others are too."
  "This is gonna come out, and the reason they're doing it the
way they're doing it is they know eventually you're gonna find
out that it's all true and real. They're desensitizing you so
that you're not shocked, so that there's no collapse of society
as we know it, so that the religious structure doesn't fall to
pieces, so that the stock market doesn't go crazy, because these
were their original fears. Now, there's nothing we can do about
the last one because it's already happened, there will be a seg-
ment of the population that worships the aliens, even though
they're no different than us they're just from somewhere else,
and they may look a little different. They are not gods. But
there are already people worshiping the aliens and they predic-
ted this would happen when they slapped the secret stamp all
over all this stuff."
  "You know, there's really nothing wrong with what's been hap-
pening except for 3 things;" [Cooper forgot to mention the 3rd
thing, or was sidetracked, or included it into the 2nd thing.]
  Number one, when they decided to keep it secret they needed to
finance it, they couldn't tell the public so they couldn't tell
Congress. They decided to finance it with the sale, importation
and sale, of drugs. Now in the documents that I read, in Opera-
tion Majority, it specifically stated that when George Bush was
the president and CEO of Sapata [sp] Oil, he, in conjunction
with the CIA, organized the first large scale drug importation
into this country from South and Central America by fishing
boat, to the offshore oil platforms of Sapata Oil, and then from
there into the beach, thus bypassing all Customs inspections and
law enforcement inspections of any kind. They are still bringing
in drugs, to a limited extent, in this manner. Another manner is
by CIA contract aircraft which, one of their bases of landing is
Homestead [sp] Air Force Base in Florida. We have affidavits
from air controllers who have vectored the planes in, who have
made sure that they're not interfered with in any way. We have
affidavits from personnel at Homestead Air Force Base who say
the planes have been met by Zeb Bush, who's George Bush's son.
We have affidavits from people who work in the Gulf of Mexico,
in the offshore oil business, that yes indeed, the drugs are
coming in, at least some of them, from the offshore oil plat-
forms."
  From the audience came a clear statement, "Just say no?"
  "Pardon? ...Right! Just Say No! Well that's what we're gonna
do ladies and gentlemen with your help ...we are going to say
NO, no more! And you gotta do it, you gotta act. You either
gotta act, or watch your country go down the tubes."
  "Now, that's one of the things that's wrong. The next thing
that's wrong is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people
who tried to leak it out. And if I hadn't done it the way that I
did it, you wouldn't be seeing me anywhere standing or walking
on this Earth now. They killed president Kennedy and during the
workshop, for those of you haven't seen the tape, I will show
you, on the tape, who shot the president and why. Between '70
and '73, in Operation Majority it stated verbatim that President
Kennedy ordered MJ-12 to cease the importation and sale of drugs
to the American people, that he ordered them to implement a plan
to reveal the presence of aliens to the American people within
the following year. His assassination was ordered by the policy
committee of the Vilderbergers. MJ-12 implemented the plan and
carried it out in Dallas. It involved agents of the CIA, Divis-
ion-5 of the FBI, the Secret Service, and the office of Naval
Intelligence. President Kennedy was killed by the driver of his
car, his name was William Greer, he used a recoilless, electric-
ally operated, gas-powered assassination pistol that was spe-
cially built by the CIA to assassinate people at close range. It
fired an explosive pellet which injected a large amount of
shellfish poison into the brain, and that is why, in the docu-
ments, it stated that President Kennedy's brain was removed. If
you've studied the case, you will find that indeed his brain
disappeared. The reason for that is so that they would not find
the particles of the exploding pellet or the shellfish poison in
his brain which would have proved conclusively that Lee Harvy
Oswald was NOT the assassin. In fact, Lee Harvy Oswald never
fired a shot, he was the patsy."
  Mr. Cooper paused briefly, and a lady in the audience asked
the obvious question, "Why haven't YOU been assassinated?"
  "If they were to kill me right now, what would you think?"
Cooper posed.
  "That it's the truth," several people chimed.
  "I've got `em right where I want `em. If they touch me,
everyone who's ever heard me talk is gonna be absolutely enraged
and is gonna know that everything I've said is true. As long as
they don't touch me there's gonna be some of you who are always
gonna be wondering. But eventually we're gonna bring enough
proof out, and if you're here during the workshop you're gonna
see an awful lot of it that's gonna prove to you that it's true.
It's real. And it's happening!"
  "Okay, I've tried to cover a lot of stuff, just briefly, be-
cause there's no time in 45 minutes to get into anything very
much."
  Mr. Cooper then announced the scheduled workshop session the
following day in which tangible proofs could be seen but regret-
tably I was unable to attend. He then opened up the floor to
questions and answers.
  A muffled question was barely heard coming from the front of
the room which in essence asked, "What about all the people in
the press and others who were in Dallas and who saw the assass-
ination? Couldn't they tell where the shot came from, why didn't
they come forward? There must have been plenty."
  "There was, we know that there was at least 18 who were all
murdered within 2-years of the event. The odds of that happening
are 1 in 300,000 trillion," Cooper replied.
  Again a muffled question, "Why did the DRIVER have to shoot
Kennedy?"
  "Because the other fools missed! There were a total of 3-shots
fired at President Kennedy, one hit him in the throat and didn't
kill him and 2 of them hit John Connelly [sp]. The one that was
fired from the grassy knoll hit the president in the throat. The
other 2-shots came from directly behind the limousine, not the
school book depository building, and hit Governor Connelly. Gov-
ernor Connelly, in intelligence community circles, is known as a
`can do' man, because he took 2-hits and still kept his mouth
shut."
  "How is it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand
side of the car was able to blow off the right side of Kennedy's
brain when the bullet actually entered in, and it would have
been virtually impossible..." another person asked.
  Mr. Cooper seized the gist of his question and injected, "For
those of you who have been listening to all these talk show
hosts, whose job it is to be a talk show host, and who have not
done any legitimate research into this, if you come to the work-
shop, I will show you, on the tape, how it was done. You will
see that Kennedy was, in fact slumped over against Jackie, his
head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it was
easy and you will see it with your own eyes."
  Another muffled, off-mike question from a member of the audi-
ence inquiring why no one else had come forward with the infor-
mation Mr. Cooper was disseminating, and why those who knew it
had kept it secret for so long was quickly answered, "It hasn't
been, I'm talkin' about it now. Bill English was talkin' about
it 8-years ago but everybody laughed at Bill English. John
Lear's been talkin' about it for 3-years and everybody laughed
at him. Now there's so many people have been talkin' about it,
people are startin' to listen and it's about time. Because it's
about time we that we quit being fools, and that's exactly what
they think we are and we prove it to them every day."
  Almost all of the questions from the audience were to faint to
hear. The next one dealt with the alien technology and asked in
essence, "Hasn't any one else [other than the government] come
up with the energy technology that the aliens have?" to which
Mr. Cooper answered, "There's been quite a few people who've
come up with it and they've ALL been stopped, and they'll all
continue to be stopped. Because once you have it you have FREE
ENERGY. Once you have free energy they no longer have power over
you. You understand? That's why they stop it."
  Another question asking, "In the film of the assassination
which was examined greatly by experts, why didn't THEY conclude
that Kennedy's driver shot him?", to which Cooper asked, "Exam-
ined by WHO greatly?", and continued, "Most of the film that you
can purchase has that segment cut out, and you can always tell
it by the person running in the background, they'll run up to
here... all of a sudden they'll be down here... running. You
will see in most of the clips that you've ever seen on televi-
sion, or in the movies, or that you're able to get your hands
on, you'll see William Greer start to turn like this...", then a
muffled comment from the audience, then Cooper answered, "That's
because they clipped it out! And on a lot of them, I'll bet you
most of you, every time you've seen the clip on television,
never looked at the driver anyway. If you're really honest with
yourself, and with me, you know your eyes were right on
Kennedy."
  A woman asked if any of the alien technology was being used in
present-day military equipment and was answered, "Yes, there's a
lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber, that's
right. The Stealth fighter was flying for 10-years before you
even knew it existed."
  As the hour drew late another question, more clearly stated,
was asked of Mr. Cooper by a woman closer to my ears, "Before
you let us all out of here, there's a bunch of us here wondering
what can we all do to help bring this all out?"
  A single word, "REVOLT" issued from several listeners simul-
taneously but Cooper responded, "Don't revolt. What you need to
do is what you should have been doing all along. You need to get
involved with your government. The first thing you need to do is
purchase a copy of the Constitution, which I know that most of
you don't have anywhere in your house, and if I were to go
around this room and ask each person what the Constitution says,
most of you couldn't tell me what the Constitution says from
your grocery bill. And that's the truth! And that IS your coun-
try! So if you don't know what your Constitution is you're dead
already, so the first thing you do is you get a copy of your
Constitution. The second thing you do is you learn it! The third
thing you do is you start calling your senators and your repre-
sentatives, and the President of the United States and you start
leaning on them, and you tell them, `Unless you straighten up
the government, and unless we start getting the truth, and I
mean the whole truth, and no more of this baloney, this's the
last job you're ever gonna have, period. And I'll do everything
in my power to make sure that comes true.' And then write them,
frequently, saying the same thing. And then when they're in your
area, in their area offices, take a little delegation and go see
them, and make them understand that they're gonna be living in
poverty because they're not gonna have a job anymore come elec-
tion day. You see, the secret government may own the executive
branch, but you people, all of us, we own the Congress, and the
Congress makes the laws, and the Congress can impeach the entire
executive branch! You also have the right to petition the gov-
ernment for a redress of injuries. So you ARE powerful, you've
just forgotten that you're powerful, you've forgotten that that
vote that you haven't been doing every time election comes
around, that vote has abdicated your power. That vote you did
not cast abdicated your power and gave it to those who are
subverting the Constitution and are ruining this country."
  A gentleman then asked, "What was traded to the aliens for
their technology?"
  "People and animals," replied Cooper succinctly.
  Another man asked, "Is the Soviet Union in on any of this?"
  "The Soviet Union and the United States of America have been
close allies since the end of World War II and have been closely
participating in the secret space program all this time. The
Soviets have the same thing we have, yes. What you see happening
in the Soviet block right now is not the result of people stand-
ing up and saying, `We want to be free.' It's the result of the
international bankers saying, `You tear down these barriers, and
you meet the West half way, give your people some freedom, the
West is gonna take some freedom away from their people so that
we can put together a one-world economic system ...and have all
the power. That's what's happening! If you don't believe it,
stick around and watch it!"
  A dubious woman then asked, "Why was the shellfish poison
necessary? A lot of his brain was blown off anyway."
  Cooper: "The shellfish poison? If you go to kill someone, one
thing I've learned, I learned it real good, I learned it espe-
cially good when I went to Viet Nam; just `cause you shoot some-
one doesn't mean they're gonna die. And if they don't die,
they're gonna be MAD. And if they've got a gun, you're dead. So
you want the first time to be the last time. So if you really
want to to kill somebody you don't play around. If you REALLY
want to kill somebody ...you KILL them, you don't play, you make
sure that when you shoot them, they're dead. That way they can't
hurt you, can't hurt you at all."
  Regrettably, the next question was totally unintelligible, I
was thankful however that Mr. Cooper had a good public address
system to amplify his reply, "The first moon landing was May the
22nd, 1962... or excuse me, that was the first landing on Mars.
I'm sorry, May the 22nd, 1962 was the winged probe that used a
hydrozine propeller, flew around approximately 3-orbits and lan-
ded on May the 22nd, 1962, was a joint United States / Russian
endeavor. The first time that we landed on the moon was sometime
during the ...probably middle 50's, because at the time when
President Kennedy stated that he wanted a man to set foot on the
moon by the end of the decade we already had a base there."
  "What about Mars?" came another quick question.
  "We have a base on Mars also," Cooper calmly replied.
  "When did that happen?"
  "I don't know the exact date but I know the project's name, it
was `Adam and Eve'."
  "How long have you known about this?"
  "Well, I revealed it publicly for the first time on July the
2nd, 1989, and within 3-weeks of the time I revealed it public-
ly, the government, to get the American people not to listen to
me, came out and said that they planned to build a base on the
moon and a colony on Mars. Now, 3-days previous to my speech,
representatives from NASA said, `We can never have a colony on
Mars, it's impossible that there's a colony on Mars because Mars
is a dead planet.' And it's NOT a dead planet, they've lied to
you about Mars."
  "My name is Dave [unintelligible], I'm a representative of the
Crystic Institute, and I'd like to know why it was that when we
sent a representative down to your home, at your request, you
failed to produce any documentation to substantiate your allega-
tions."
  "In the first place it was NOT at my request, I have never
contacted the Crystic Institute in my life. I was on the Carol
Hemingway Show, she contacted the Crystic institute, she told
Daniel Shehan [sp] that I had just said something about Bush and
drugs on her show. HE called ME and told me he wanted to send an
investigator, in fact he told me to even help the investigator
because he was new at the job, his name was Wayne Nelson, he is
a very good gentleman, he stayed at my house for 2-days, slept
overnight on my couch, I gave him everything I had. I never told
Daniel Shehan that I had any documents and I never told Wayne
Nelson that I had any documents. In fact what I told Wayne Nel-
son, and I quote, `Wayne, if I did have the documents I couldn't
admit it and I don't know you from Adam, and I don't know Daniel
Shehan from Adam and what makes you think I would give them to
you.' Who am I going to give them to and how quick are they go-
ing to disappear, that was my thought. Wayne Nelson also came to
my house with a stack of documents this thick already substanti-
ating the presence of aliens and extraterrestrial craft on this
planet, and they are keeping it a secret, because they're afraid
somebody'll laugh at them and they'll loose their credibility."
  "We need some patriots in this country, not people trying to
make a name for themselves, trying to expose some drug runners,
because those are just the bag-men. The real crook is in the
White House! And you can tell THAT to Daniel Shehan!"
  "Why didn't Jackie Kennedy report [the source of the lethal
shot]?" asked another audience member.
  "Who's she gonna tell? The Secret Service just killed her hus-
band and they're assigned to protect the President. Also, who
had her children? The same Secret Service had her children at
the time."
  "Wasn't the craft at Roswell, New Mexico destroyed and all the
aliens killed?" another young man asked.
  "All the aliens were dead but the craft was not completely
destroyed, it was severely damaged yes."
  On an unrelated note an older gentleman asked, "Does that mean
that `Alternative-3' is true?"
  "Alternative-3 is absolutely true and so is `Alternative-2'."
  Then a man in his late 20's or early 30's raised his hand,
said something I couldn't hear, and was apparently recognized by
Mr. Cooper who asked him to take the podium and address the aud-
ience.
  "What I said was that I thanked him [Cooper] very much for
coming forward and saying something. A lot of my friends out
here know that I was involved in the United States Special For-
ces, UFO Tracking and Research from the years 1971 to 1975. My
name is Richard Murray, I was based out of the 71st Tac Controll
Flight, McDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. We were `Mobile
Radar Command,' that was combat and war ready. We could be load-
ed on aircraft within an hour and many times were taken into
areas [to] set up radar. A lot of times we were set up around
Egland [sp] Air Force Base because that's where they have the
`Altered Temperature Weather Control', where they can test vari-
ous aircraft for their shrinkage and their dimension change dur-
ing altered temperature. So, you know, I was told to shut up
twice in 1982 and they finally threatened my parents life so I
stayed quiet, and, that's when Wendel Stevens was taken off the
streets... Just like that! And I hid for quite awhile, and deci-
ded to come back out when I heard that you're [Cooper] of such
high rank as you were, and I felt just in saying that your cre-
dentials are true, and that what you have to say, everything
you've said here today, I've heard before behind closed doors.
And you've really tied the link for me to the Kennedy killing.
And there's a few more links that have to go on with the Colum-
bia Cartel and the money laundering. I think there's more than
one cartel involved, and they're shutting one of them down so
one can maintain a power, it just seems to be the way it works."
  A muffled question then came from someone in the audience
regarding the person referred to as "Colonel Stevens."
  "Uh, Colonel Stevens is out of jail now," replied Murray who
was quickly asked another question I couldn't hear to which he
answered, "I sure hope to hell so, he is a wonderful man and I
give him my utmost respect and it was one of the saddest days in
my life to see what happened to him happen to him. But I don't
care what they say about Wendel Stevens, in my heart you can't
discredit that man to me. I don't care who the hell you are. I
won't listen to it, I don't give a shit if he was screwin' ba-
bies. You know... that doesn't... he's not that kind of a man, I
don't care what you say, I know him personally."

  The lecture was then essentially over. The "Alternative-2 and
-3" that were referred to briefly are, to the best of my know-
ledge, two government contingency plans and I don't know which
is which, to 1: Declare Martial Law and invalidate the Constitu-
tion on the premise that a terrorist group had entered the coun-
try with a Nuclear weapon with plans to detonate it in a major
city. All dissidents would be rounded up and placed in concen-
tration camps and the press and media would be nationalized. All
this, if the information becomes public before they want it to
or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and 2: Another contingency
plan to contain or delay the release of this information, the
details of which I am probably wrong about anyway.
  My own personal reaction to Milton William Cooper; Mr. Cooper
is a man who appears to be in his late fourties, of medium
height and weight, and was dressed casually when I saw him. His
hairline was receding slightly and he carried himself with con-
fidence and purpose. Bill Cooper, as he was called by several in
attendance, is not a professional speaker. His presentation
lacked the polish of repeated deliveries which all the other
lectures I heard during the Expo. had, but what it lacked in
fine tuning was easily made up for in its content. Weather or
not everyone in the audience was convinced of his sincerity I do
not know, but the thunderous peal of applause which exploded as
he concluded the session spoke for me and the majority of those
in attendance. I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that
Bill Cooper believes everything he said, and I'm about as
skeptical as they come.
  Please read the attached file written by Milton William Cooper
which describes some of the government operations, projects, and
code names that pertain to the above transcript. Perhaps from
the two documents you can reach your own conclusions as to what
"Alternative-2 and -3 are.
