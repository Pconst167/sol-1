FRENCH UFO EXPERTS PROBE HOLE IN CORNFIELD

ROUEN, FRANCE (JULY 11) REUTER - Police and scientists are examining a strange
dish-like hole in a cornfield in western France amid suggestions it could have
been caused by an Unidentified Flying Object.

Police said on Wednesday they had called in government-paid UFO experts to look
at a 10-metre (30-foot) wide conically- shaped hole that appeared in a field
last weekend after farmers reported hearing a loud thud.

There was no trace of fire but part of the field appeared to have been
flattened by a blast.

Circles appearing in wheatfields in southern England have baffled scientists
for years.

In Brussels Belgium's air force held a news conference on Wednesday to say its
radar stations picked up a UFO on March 30 which accelerated from 280 km (175
miles) an hour to more than 1,800 km (1,125 miles) an hour and altered height
by more than three km (two miles) in 15 seconds.

Colonel Wilfried De Brouwer said the UFO performed movements which no existing
airplane was capable of making.

Two F-16 fighter jets were sent to investigate after several policemen reported
seeing a huge dark triangle covered in lights in the sky about 40 km (25 miles)
south-east of Brussels. The planes chased the object for about 45 minutes and
made several radar contacts before losing it.

De Brouwer told reporters the object could not have been a plane, a balloon, a
laser beam or a thermic inversion, a meteorological phenomenon which disturbs
radio waves.
