            STUDY OF OFFICIAL AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT 

                            IN UFO CONTROVERSY

A PROGRESS REPORT BY BILL CHALKER

During 1982, I was able to:

a.   Examine the majority of the extent UFO files held by the Royal 
     Australian Air Force (RAAF).

b.   Examine the entirety of the extent UFO files held by the Dept. of      
     Aviation.

c.   Initiate discussions with a defence scientist privy to the 
     official files and the inner working of governmental policies and
     approaches to the UFO subject.

d.   Initiate enquiries with other Australian agencies and individuals 
     re UFO file holdings.

e.   Undertake enquiries with overseas government departments re UFO 
     file holdings (in particular, the Ministries of Defence in the 
     U.K. and the USAF re Project Blue Book, the latter, in relation 
     to Australian cases).

f.   Undertake discussions with the Department of Aviation/Bureau of
     Air Safety investigation on the Valentich affair, and

g.   publish some of the results of my enquiries.


THE RAAF FILES:

The RAAF files held by the Directorate of Air Force Intelligence 
(DAFI) were examined over four separate visits to the Department of 
Defence Russell Offices in Canberra during 1982 - namely, January 11-
14, May 7 June 4 and October 8.

A total of 56 files were examined.   They fell into categories:

1.   "Unidentified Flying Objects - Reports of Sightings" - 47 files 
     covering the period 1955-1982.   Three files covering the period 
     around 1973/74 have yet to be examined.

2.   "UFO's - Enquiries from Members of the Public and Flying Saucer 
     Organisations" - 7 files covering the period 1966-1981 and   

3.   "Investigation of Flying Saucers - Policy" - 2 files covering the
      period 1953-1969.   The current "policy" file has not yet been 
      made available.


THE DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION FILES

The DOA files held by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation were 
examined on November 19th 1982 during a visit to their Melbourne 
office.   Four files were examined and their contents included:

1.   Previously "secret" papers related to the famous Drury film
     affair.  (1)
2.   Details about early reports from 1952-1968.

3.   Early RAAF documents and reports (copies) no longer available in 
     the RAAF files, due to the original files, ostensibly, being 
     destroyed during the Department of Air (now Department of Defence 
     - Air Force) move from Melbourne to Canberra in the early 
     sixties.

4.   Papers relating to the controversial Bouganville Reef event of 
     1965, which appear to confirm that the Department of Civil
     Aviation (DCA) had no knowledge of it, at least at the level of 
     DCA-Director-General in Melbourne.


DISCUSSIONS WITH DEFENCE SCIENTIST

Detailed discussions have been undertaken with a retired scientist who 
has worked in the Defence Scientific and Technical Intelligence (DSTI) 
section of the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB now joint Intelligence 
Organization - J10).   The scientist, in a civilian capacity, had 
access to the RAAF/DAFI UFO files in 1954 and later, as JIB "liaison"
to DAFI, had access to the DAFI files during the late sixties.   He 
was in a unique position to examine the files and observe the policies 
and approaches of government agencies (DAFI,JIB etc.) to the UFO 
question.  Further to my discussions with him by phone and letter, I 
was able to meet him personally during May 1983.   I have found his 
information extremely informative and it has served to compliment and 
supplement data I have amassed from other sources.   A detailed 
picture of the history of official involvement in the UFO controversy, 
in Australia, can at last be discerned.


OTHER AUSTRALIAN AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS

Upon my request, on July 13, 1982, the Director of Naval Intelligence 
(DNI) declassified documents relating to the famous radar-visual Sea 
Fury incident of August 31, 1954.   These included written statements 
by the Sea Fury pilot and the Nowra Naval Air Station radar operator 
and a previously "confidential" memorandum from DNI to DAFI.   (3)
In correspondence with R.H. Mathams, former Director of Scientific 
Intelligence (JIB/J10) and author of the book: "Sub Rosa - Memoirs of 
an Australian Intelligence Analyst", he indicated to me that, "DSTI 
had only a marginal interest in UFO's; our analytical resources were
limited and I had to take the position that we could not afford to 
become too involved in investigation of UFO sightings until we had 
reasonable grounds for believing that they were of foreign - as 
opposed to alien - origin.   We relied on DAFI to make the initial 
investigations and, at times assisted in the interpretation of the 
resulting data".   Mr. Mathams is not the defence scientist mentioned 
earlier.   Other agencies and individuals have either been contacted, 
replied, or are in the process of being contacted.   I do not, at this 
stage, propose to possibly jeopardise results, with premature 
disclosures of current and future lines of enquiries.


OVERSEAS ENQUIRIES

Enquiries with some overseas government department have borne fruit.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD), Defence Secretariat, Division 8, of the 
United Kingdom indicated:

a.   MOD's records on UFO's go back to 1962.   Most of the material is 
     reports of individual sightings by members of the public, passed 
     on to us via ATC centres, police, RAF stations, etc.   As an
     indication of the size of our holdings, we received 2250 
     sightings between 1978 and 1981.

b.   MOD investigated UFO sightings solely to determine whether they 
     indicate anything of defence interest.   No attempt is made to 
     find a positive identification for every object seen.   We have, 
     therefore, no category of 'unexplained sightings...'.

A reply from New Zealand authorities confirmed that there appears to 
be little organised effort to investigate UFO's there.   No 
comprehensive records are maintained.   From the National Archives and
Records Service, Washington, D.C., USA, where the USAF Project 
Bluebook files are held, I have received copies of documentation held 
on some Australian cases.   I have also on order microfilm copies of a 
comprehensive Bluebook index and all photographic holdings. (4)  I 
have also been in contact with a number of overseas civilian 
researchers who have been assisting me in my enquiries.


THE VALENTICH AFFAIR

On May 26, 1982, the Department of Transport (now Aviation) released 
to me their Aircraft Accident Investigation Summary Report on the 
disappearance of VH-DSJ and its pilot, Frederick Valentich.   It would 
appear that this document was made available only to parties having a 
bona fide interest in the incident.   It would appear that, via my 
correspondence with the Department, they were satisfied that my 
interest, despite it being from a 'ufological' point of view, was 
never-the-less bona fide.   I am aware that the same report has been 
denied to other parties, whom on the face of it, appeared to have had 
a bona fide interest.   (5)

During my November 19, 1982 visit to the Bureau of Air Safety 
Investigation, I had the opportunity to discuss the Valentich Affair 
with Mr. A.R. Woodward, a Director of the Bureau.   He referred to the 
files on the case, he had in front of him, to answer some of my 
questions, however, access to these files was denied to me, on the 
basis that all "air accident investigation files were privileged 
information.   It was evident that they were only treating the affair 
as an accident/incident pertaining to air safety investigation.   More 
recently, when I questioned him on the alleged discovery of the 
aircraft, VH-DSJ, on Cape Otway, by divers, Mr. Woodward indicated 
that no action was planned by the Department of Aviation.   In the 
event that VH-DSJ was actually salvaged, the Department would 
confiscate the aircraft in view of it being the subject of an aircraft 
accident investigation.   Dr. Richard Haines has provided me with an 
advanced complimentary copy of his 'Journal of UFO Studies' paper; 
"Results of Sound Spectrum Analysis of the Metallic Noises of a Tape 
recorded Radio Transmission between Cessna VH;DSJ and the Flight 
Service of Melbourne, Australia".   (6)


PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS

I have been able to publish part of the results of my research into 
official Australian government involvement in the UFO controversy.

1-2  "UFO's and the Royal Australian Air Force - the inside story" in 
     the UFO Research Australia Newsletter (UFORAN), Vol.3 Nos 2,3, 
     and 4 (March-April, May-June and July-August, 1982) and MUFON UFO 
     Journal No. 175 (Sept. 1982) and No. 176 (Oct 8) the latter in a 
     slightly edited form.

     Science Digest, Dept-Oct, 1982 and the APRO Bulletin, Vol 30 No. 
     10 (Oct 82) and Vol 30 No. 11 (Dec 8) as "Australian A.F. UFO 
     Report Files".

     Cribb, the (Sydney) Sun, December 1982.

The British Flying Saucer Review (FSR) via Gordon Creighton have 
indicated an interest in publishing some of this material.   UFO Nyt, 
the Scandinavian publication have also been given permission to 
publish material.   The Orbis multiple part publication "The 
Unexplained" may also be briefly referring to this research with an 
article by Jenny Randles in the near future.   I will continue to 
release the results of my research as time permits.

I have made some limited copies of some documents available to those 
individuals with bona fide interests, e.g. Nebo area events of 1964 
and 1965 and a possible "landing" near Mandurana in 1978 to UFO 
research (FNQ); 1957 radar visual event in Tasmania and 1960 USAF 
aircraft encounter near Cressy to TUFOIC: Groote Eylandt (1964) 'EM' 
event, radar-visual event at Kalamunda (1969) etc. to UFOR (WA) and 
various 'aircraft/UFO encounters' to Dr. Richard Haines, who is 
specialising in such cases. (7,8,9,10,11,12).   In view of the fact 
that I have signed a DAFI document undertaking to preserve 
confidentiality I have to maintain strict control of the RAAF 
documents released to me.   As time permits documents will be released 
with confidential details (names etc.) deleted.


SPECIAL AREAS OF STUDY

During my reviews and research of official files several particular 
areas of study have received additional attention.   These include:

1.   The case for and against official 'cover-ups' of UFO DATA:  More 
     than twenty individual accounts from civilian sources allegedly 
     indicative of 'cover-up' activities were are being examined.   I 
     hope to report on my findings soon.

2.   The Drury Film Affair:  most of the original documentation is now 
     secured.   Frames from the film are in my possession, however, 
     they are of poor quality.   Mr. Drury has been contacted and was 
     most helpful with my enquiries.  A report on my investigations 
     will be made available when completed.

3.   Reports by military personnel.   Reports by service personnel 
     have been collected together and a report will be made available 
     when completed.

4.   Reports from aircraft:  Such cases have been isolated and are to 
     be added to an expanded catalogue in conjunction with Keith 
     Basterfield's revision of his existing document on this theme.

5.   Official policies to UFO's:  A number of official documents 
     relating to policy have been secured.   The evaluation of 
     official policy re UFO's in Australia from 1950 through to 1983 
     is fairly clear.   I will be reporting on this in due course. 

6.   Summarising and indexing official file holdings.   Preliminary 
     general indexes are already being worked on which will cover the 
     period 1950 to 1983.

7.   Search for missing files:  While it appears that I have been able 
     to examine the majority of RAAF/DAFI file holdings, a few 
     individual file parts remain to be located and examined.   These 
     include:

     a.  Three sighting file parts covering reports during about 1973 
         and 1974.   Major cases known to be in them have already been 
         secured (e.g. UFO over North West Cape and a physical trace 
         event near Nebo).

     b.  The "current" policy file.

     c.  The original DAFI files prior to 1955.   There is official 
         evidence that these may have been destroyed during the move 
         of Defence from Melbourne to Canberra in the early 1960's.       
         Fortunately, a previously secret report written in 1954, and 
         made available to me, summarises much of the DAFI files of 
         the period 1950-1954.   As already mentioned, early DCA UFO 
         files I examined also hold copies of a number of reports and 
         documents from these missing DAFI files of the early 1950's.

Other files are being searched for, however, it is thought that, in 
some cases, the "missing" files may have been recovered as new file 
series (or the earlier parts of more recent file series).   Following 
the erratic history of official UFO files has sometimes been daunting.   
I am confident that I have established a fairly thorough understanding 
of the DAFI UFO files, so much so that the DAFI intelligence liaison 
officer I have worked with during 1982 was once moved to tell me that 
I knew the DAFI UFO files better than he did, in fact better than 
anyone in the Department of Defence.   This can in part be seen as a 
reflection of the significance DAFI/RAAF may now appear to give to UFO 
reports.

CONCLUSION:  As someone who has taken a special interest in the degree 
of official involvement in UFO investigation in Australia, for more 
than a decade now, I have personally been amazed at the extent of the 
material I have been allowed to become privy to in just one short 
year, namely 1982.

We have gone from a confused and vague picture of clandestine official 
involvement to a detailed understanding basedon directly officially 
sanctioned file reviews by a civilian researcher.

In closing I will say that I will be working very hard at making 
available to each and all the full extent of what I have learnt during 
this study and the benefit of a much closer relationship with the 
RAAF.


REFERENCES AND NOTES:

1.   The Drury Film Affair refers to an incident during 1953 wherein 
     Mr. T. Drury, Deputy Director of DCA in Papua, took a movie film 
     of a daylight object which exited a cloud at high speed, climbing 
     at about 45 degrees and disappeared.   The film was examined by 
     RAAF and USAF, however, it appears the film itself subsequently 
     disappeared.   The affair has now been one mainstay o the claim 
     made by many civilian researchers that there is an official 
     "cover-up".

2.   The Bouganville Reef event involved the alleged photographing of 
     a UFO by a pilot of a DC6 aircraft.   It has been alleged that 
     evidence about the case, including the film, has been confiscated 
     by DCA officials and subsequently covered up.   The classified 
     papers I examined consisted largely of internal communications 
     between the Queensland Regional Director of DCA and the Director 
     General of DCA which appears to conform a lack of knowledge about 
     the event, at least at the level of Directors of DCA.

3.   The Sea Fury incident involved a naval pilot flying over the 
     Goulbourn area of New South Wales, encountering two unidentified 
     light, the presence of which were confirmed by ground radar.

4.   In particular the classic Drury affair of 1953 and the Willow 
     Grove close encounter of 1963, wherein farmer Charles Brew had a 
     very explicit sighting of a UFO on his property.   The incident 
     featured animal reactions and apparently related headaches for 
     Mr. Brew.

5.   See AFUFOS Bulletin, July 1982.   The 'Aircraft Accident 
     Investigation Summary Report' makes no definite conclusions as to 
     cause but indicated 'the reason for the disappearance of the 
     aircraft has not been determined'.

6.   See also, for example, "Valentich - Bass Strait (Australia) 
     Affair" in R.D. Story's "The Encyclopaedia of UFO's", Doubleday, 
     1980 and New English Library, 1980, and "The Devil's Meridian" by 
     Kevin Killey and Gary Lester (Lester-Townsend, 1980).

7.   These events refer to an unusual ground mark and an apparently 
     unrelated UFO sighting at the same location.

8.   An extraordinary phenomenon ostensibly had landed in a cane field 
     east of Mandurana, Queensland.  It was witnessed by four people 
     for three hours.

9.   This event occurred on August 27, 1957 and involved radar 
     tracking of a fast moving object by Met Radar at Hobart, after 
     being alerted via a visual sighting at Launceston ATC.

10.  On November 15, 1960, a USAF JV57 aircraft operating out of East 
     Sale RAAF base encountered a UFO at a closing rate in excess of 
     800 knots.

11.  In this case a light source approached a ship of Groote Eylandt 
     on January 23, 1964.   It came within 6ft of the ship, 
     underwater, and was described as "a ghostly white light, in the 
     centre was a shadow which rotated in a clockwise direction 
     causing the light to pulsate".   The ship, a barge, was 
     approached by the light at high speed.   In total six patches of 
     light were observed, varying in size from a mile across down to 
     quite small.   All were the same colour and all pulsated at 12 
     pulsations for 9 seconds, then irregular, then back to 12 for 9 
     seconds again.   The compass swung out of control, but became 
     worse as the light approached.

12.  ATC radar operator at Kalamunda, 1835 hours on May 23, received a 
     strong stationary "paint", 300 degrees 9N miles from the airport.   
     He had first observed the return whilst talking on the phone to a 
     woman reporting an object "like a big streetlight" over 
     Cloverdale at the time.   The "paint" was of 36 seconds duration 
     on the screen.  An aircraft was about 4N miles SE of the UFO, but 
     no visual sighting was made.   The woman reported the object had 
     departed to the North at tremendous speed and had disappeared 
     from sight.
