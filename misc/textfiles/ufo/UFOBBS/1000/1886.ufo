SUBJECT: HENRY SWERDLOFF BACKS UP BILL COOPER                FILE: UFO1886



25 Jan 1989 

Below is a possible explanation as to the reason why some of 
the United States Government's publications that describe 
extraterrestrials appear so wildly weird. 

Please feel free to use this document in any way that you desire. 

Some of the people that I have learned to trust are kind 
and concerned.  Because of information given to me by some 
of these people, I able to inform you of the following: 

The official publications, that Bill says that he was exposed to, do exist. 

Other people, besides Bill, appear to have read the 
same, or similar, official publications. 

These official publications were authored or assembled while 
following our American tradition of fairness.  So as to be 
fair to everyone, the authors or assemblers included 
all information from any source that they had 
access to, without exclusion. 

Because the official publications reflect our American 
tradition of fairness, they do include information that 
has no currently available proof, and they do include 
information that any reasonable person would think is wrong. 

The idea was NOT to present a bias.  The idea was NOT to 
take a position as to what could be true or untrue. 


The idea was to include everything, and not edit by exclusion.
