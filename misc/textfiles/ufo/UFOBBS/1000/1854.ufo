Memorandum for Mr. Ladd

    mr. ________ also discussed this matter with Colonel L.  H. Forney of
MID.  Colonel Forney indicated that it was his attitude that inasmuch as
it has been established that the flying disks are not the result of any
Army or Navy experiments, the matt er is of interest to the FBI.  He
stated that he was of the opinion that the Bureau, if at all possible,
should accede to General Schulgen's request.

SWR:AJB

ADDENDUM

I would recommend that we advise the Army that the Bureau does not believe
it should go into these investigations, it being noted that a great bulk
of those alleged discs reported found have been pranks.  It is not
believed that the Bureau would accomplish anything by going into these
investigations.

(Clyde Tolson)-I think we should do this.  (Dated 7/15)

(J.  Edgar Hoover)-I would do it but before agreeing t o it we must insist
upon full access to discs recovered.  For instance in the SW case the Army
grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.

DATE OF DOCUMENT 7/30/1947
(B) FLYING DISCS-The Bureau, at the request o f the Army Air Force
intelligence, has agreed to cooperate in the investigation of flying
discs.  The Air Forces have confidentially advised that it is possible to
release three or more discs in odd numbers, attached together by a wire,
from an airplane in high altitudes and that these discs would obtain
tremendous speed in their descent and would descend to the earth in an
arc.  The Army Air Forces Intelligence has also indicated some concern
that the reported sightings might have been made by subversive
individuals for the purpose of creating a mass hysteria.

(AUTHORIZATION TO INVESTIGATE)

BUREAU BULLETIN NO.  42         -2-
Series 1947

    You should investigate each instance which is brought to your
attention of a sighting of a flying disc in order to ascertain whether or
not it is a bonifide sighting, an imaginary one or a prank.  You should
also bear in mind th at individuals might report seeing flying discs for
various reasons.  It is conceivable that an individual might be desirous
of seeking personal publicity, causing hysteria, or playing a prank.

    The Bureau should be notified immediately by teletype o f all reported
sightings and the results of your inquiries.  In instances where the
report appears to have merit, the teletype s hould be followed by a letter
to the Bureau containing in detail the results of your inquiries.  The
Army Air Forces have asured t he Bureau complete cooperating in these
matters and in any instances where they fail to make information
available to you or make the recovered discs available for your
examination, it should promptly be brought to the attention of the
Bureau.

    Any information you develop in connection with these discs should be
promptly brought to the attention of the Army through your usual liason
channels.

Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO : DIRECT OR FBI                               DATE: January 10, 1949
FROM : SAC KNOXVILLE
SUBJECT : "FLYING SAUCERS" OBSERVED OVER
          OAK RIDGE AREA
          INTERNAL SECURITY-X

     There are being submitted herewith two photographs of reputedly
"flying saucers" which were seen at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, sometime during
July of 1947.  All of the information contained in this letter was
received from George Rateman, Resident Engineer, Air Material Command,
United States Army, who is the principal army technician at the Nuclear
Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft Research Center at Oak Ridge,
Tennessee.

     Mr. Rateman advised that the attached photographs were taken by
______ in July of 1947.  He stated that interview with _______ revealed
that he had been snapping photographs of his family in front of his
residence at 218 Illinois Avenue, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, late in the
afternoon, when he looked into the sky and observed the vapor trail as
exhibited by the photograph numbered "1."  __________ stated that he took
a snap of this trail, was winding the film to the next number, when he
looked into the sky and observed the ball of fire as shown in photograph
2.  _______ made these photographs available to reporters of the Knoxville
News-Sentinel and a story concerning them was run in that paper; however,
as shown by the photostatic copy of the newspaper clipping, which is also
being submitted herewith to the Bureau, the print was very indistinct; the
news story did not contain any factual information; and it was regarded
generally by the public at the time as a possible trick.

     Later, it was learned by Rateman And _________ that _________ had
made several copies of this photograph and had distributed them among his
aquaintances at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  Upon ___________ finding that the
photographs had received some distribution, he requested Rateman as Head o
f the Compliance and Investigations Division, to recover as many as
possible of the photographs, advise the persons in whose possession they
were found to say nothing to anyone concerning them, and to return the
said photographs to him for transmission to the United States Air Force
Intelligence Service.  Rateman advises that he succeeded in rounding up
twenty four copies of these photographs, and that, according to the
statements of ________, no more copies were made or distributed.  Rateman
further stated that _______ had appeared extremely concerned over the
matter and seemed quite emphatic that the matter should be given no more
publicity than was absolutely necessary.  Rateman also advised that he
studied the negatives from which the reproductions were made, and they
appeared to be authentic in that trick photography should have been
apparent, but from the ______________ __________ ______.

FROM: GUY HOTTEL, SAC, WASHINGTON

SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCERS
         INFORMATION CONCERNING


The following information was furnished to SA [blanked] by
[                               blanked                                ]
[                               blanked                                ]

An investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying
saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.  They were described as being
circular in shape with raised centers, approxi-mately 50 feet in
diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only
three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each
body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed
flyers and test pilots.

According to Mr. [blanked] informant, the saucers were found in New
Mexico due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered
radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes
with the controling mechanism of the saucers.

No further evaluation was attempted by SA [blank] concerning the above.

SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"
TO:      Commanding General
         Army Air Forces
         Washington 25, D.C.

         ATTENTION: Brig. General George Schulgen
                    AC/AS-2

1.  As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered
opinion of this command concerning the so-called "Flying Discs."  This
opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and
preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory,
Engineering Division T-3.  This opinion was arrived at in a conference
between personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2,
Office, Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and
Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.

2.  It is the opinion that:

  a.  The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or
      fictitious.

  b.  There are objects probably approximately the shpe of a disc, of such
      appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.

  c.  There is the possibility that some of the incidents may be caused
      by natural phenomena, such as meteors.

  d.  The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of
      climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must
      be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft
      and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects
      are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.

  e.  The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:

      (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface.

      (2) Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object
          apparently was operating under high performance conditions.

      (3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on
          top.

      (4) Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from
          three to nine objects.

      (5) Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a
          substantial rumbling roar was noted.

      [6] Level flight speeds normally about 300 knots are estimated.

        LETTER FROM GENERAL N.F. TWINING TO COMMANDING GENERAL,
                  ARMY AIR FORCES 23 SEPTEMBER 1947
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   f.  It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge - provided
       extensive detailed development is undertaken--to construct a
       piloted aicraft which has the general description of the object in
       subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate
       range of 700 miles at subsonic speeds.

   g.  Any devlopments in this country along the lines indicated would be
       extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense
       of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up
       independently of existing projects.

   h.  Due consideration must be given the following:

           (1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin
               -the product of some high security project not known to
               AC/AS-2 or this command.

           [2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash
               recovered exhibits which would undeniably prove the
               existence of these objects.

           (3) The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of
               propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our
               domestic knowledge.

3.  It is recommended that:

   a.  Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a
       priority, security classification and code name for a detailed
       study of this matter to include the preparation of complete sets of
       all available and pertinent data which will then be made available
       to the Army , Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB, the Air Force
       Scientific Advisory Group, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA projects
       for comments and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be
       forwarded within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed
       report thereafter every 30 days as the investigation develops.  A
       complete interchange of data should be effected.

4.  Awaiting a specific directive AMC will continue the investigation
    within its current resources in order to more closely define the
    nature of the phenomenon.  Detailed Essential Elements of Information
    will be formulated immediately for transmittal thru channels.

                                           N.F. TWINING

60,000 sightings can't be wrong, Seattleite insists, "The bottom line is:
Don't believe me, but do read what is available." Dale Goudie

By Peter Lewis Times Staff Reporter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
------In their most commonly reported from, the aliens have large heads
and stand 3 to 4 feet tall.  Their enormous eyes rest under a transparent
helmet. Clad in jumpsuits adorned with insignias, the humanoids walk in
sure, positive movements.  Far out?  Maybe so, but that's where they
probably come from.  And Seattle resident Dale Goudie has talked to people
who say they've seen them.  Goudie has spent the past 14 years researching
UFOs and using the Freedom of Information Act to collect federal documents
that he contends prove UFOs exist.  The official position of the U.S. Air
Force, for example, is that it got out of the UFO business when Project
Bluebook ended in 1969.  But Goudie says the Bluebook was succeeded by
Project Aquarius.  Since 1942, there have been an estimated 60,000 UFO
sightings in the United States alone and only 5 percent of sightings are
actually reported, Goudie says.  Feeding characteristics of the 60,000
sightings into a computer, 250 different shapes emerged, suggesting to
Goudie that there may be more than one species involved in UFOs.  "The
bottom line is: Don't believe me, but do read what is available," says
Goudie, who has dedicated a room in his home to countless files and papers
on UFOs.  "The real problem is, no one wants to take the responsibility of
telling the American public this (UFOs) is real."  Consider a series of
once classified material on Project Aquarius: An Air Force document dated
Nov. 17, 1980, from the Office of Special Investigations at Rolling Air
Force Base in Washington, D.C., to OSI at Kirtland Air Force Base in New
Mexico refers to a "request for photo imagery interpretation."  Other
papers indicate that the request stemmed from a series of "alleged
sightings of unidentified aerial lights" over the Manzano Wepons Storage
Area at Kirtland between Aug. 8 and Sept. 3, 1980.  An analysis of at
least two pictures of the sightings concluded that the film was unaltered
and that they were "legitimate negative(s) of (an) unidentified aerial
object," according to the Nov. 17, 1980, document.  Of the two confirmed
sightings, one "contained a trilateral insignia on the lower portion of
objects..."  The document also states: "The official U .S. government
policy and results of Project Aquarius is still classified top secret with
no dissemination outside official intelligence channels. ...Because of a
chance of public disclosure, no knowledgeable personnel with SPA (it's not
clear if SPA stands for Special Project Aquarius, or something else) will
be provided..."  But another Air Force document dated Jan. 25,1983, says
"possible unauthorized release of classified material" cast doubt on the
authenticity of the Nov. 17, 1980, document.  The later document says the
earlier one included nonexistent officers, and it sought to discredit the
validity of the purported imagery interpretation.  When a Freedom of
Information request letter dated Feb. 20, 1986, sought information on
Project Aquarius, the National Security Agency responded, in part, with a
letter dated March 3, 1986: "Please be advised that Project Aquarius does
not deal with unidentified aerial objects.  We, therefore, have no
information to provide you on the subject."  But when Sen.  John Glenn
wrote the National Security Agency on Jan. 7 of this year on behalf of a
constituent who was having trouble getting responses to Freedom of
Information requests about Project Aquarius, the reply letter, dated Jan.
27, said in part: "Apparently there is or was an Air Force project by that
name which dealt with UFOs.  Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project
by that name.  The NSA project does not deal with UFOs.. .."  It is
Goudie's contention that the responses about Project Aquarius demonstrate
the government is saying one thing and doing another.  He theorizes that
the government is reluctant to admit the existence of even one UFO because
as soon as it does, it fears opening the door to mass hysteria.  Spokesmen
for the Pentagon, the Air Force and the National Security Agency either
declined comment or denied that any government agency is actively
investigating UFOs.  The Air Force quit studying UFOs in 1969 after a
$500,000 study conducted by the University of Colorado concluded that "UFO
phenomena do not offer a fruitful field in which to look for major
scientific discoveries," according to Capt. Jay DeFrank.  DeFrank noted
that in 1977, President Carter asked the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration to look into the possibility of resuming active
investigation of UFOs.  This is the same man who in 1973, when he was
governor of Georgia, said, "I don't laugh at people anymore when they say
they have seen UFOs because I've seen one myself."  NASA spokesman Dave
Garrett recalls that agency's response to the president:  "We said, 'Thank
you, but no thank you.'  We have never been in the business."  Dennis
Chadwick, chief spokesman for the National Security Agency at Fort George
Meade in Maryland, an arm of the pentagon, would not say whether NSA or
any other government agency is actively investigating UFOs.  Goudie, a
45-year-old freelance ad man and former TV talk-show producer, is not
deterred by the government's stance.  Two years ago, he established a
computerized UFO bulletin board - CUFON (for Computer UFO Network) - that
has more than 1,400 members.  It spits out information, free of charge, to
anyone with a computer and a modem.  He also runs UFO Information Service
International, a global network of UFO sightings, and Puget Sound Aerial
Phenomena Research Inc.  None of these enterprises, he says, is a
money-making operation.  Goudie says he and others like him have been
helped in their many Freedom of Information requests by military personnel
who want the public to know about UFOs, but who can't afford to be named.
Many of the documents he's obtained indicate that "suspicious unknown air
activity" has occurred at top-security military installations where
nuclear weapons are stored.  The documents relating to UFOs dropping in on
Air Force bases have been published elsewhere - and professional skeptics
such as Phillip Klass, an editor with "Aviation Week & Space Technology,"
have written books debunking the authenticity of those and others
sightings.  But Goudie notes the government itself has never volunteered
any information, much less any explanations, about UFOs at military bases.
"You can explain anything away," says Goudie, referring to Klass and the
other debunkers.  "But these aren't solid answers." Goudie also says he
has consulted with "optical physicists" who have performed "video-negative
photoanalysis" of videotapes of UFOs to substantiate that the object are
not of this earth.  Goudie also says he has interviewed about 40 people
over the years who claim to have been abducted by UFOs.  All occurred in
rural areas, including some episodes outside Redmond, in Maple Valley and
north of Seattle.  He thinks about three-fourths of them are telling the
truth.  In many cases, the victims have suffered physical scars that they
didn't have before their encounter, Goudie says.  "I've tried to get these
people to come forward.  They don't want anything to do with newspapers.
They're scared to death of losing their jobs..."  Considering the threat
to national security and the risk to civilians, Goudie believes the
government has an obligation to be more forthcoming.  You don't have to
look to far away places for physical evidence of UFOs, according to
Goudie.  He has a videotape of an object flying over Tacoma in 1982,
enhanced by a process known as "video photo analysis" which allows the
viewer to see vertical and horizontal lines within what Goudie calls "the
plasma" that covers the true shape within.  He expects the video to air on
Sunday's "Town Meeting" on KOMO.  Television, specifically a Dick Cavett
show that aired in 1973, started Goudie's preoccupation with UFOs.  He's
since appeared on CNN's Larry King Show and CBS-TV network news shows,
among others.  He spent countless hours and dollars pursuing UFOs.  His
goal, he says, is to see the subject become an area of serious scientific
inquiry.  "I'm doing it because I think people deserve the facts, and no
one's taking the time to do it."

SUBJECT: Response for request of Information in Relation to UFO Contact
and Other Related Information

TO: Len Stringfield


1. In January of 1978, I was station at McGuire AFB, NJ.. One evening ,
during the time frame of 0300hrs. and 0500hrs., there were a number of UFO
sightins in the area over the air field and Ft. DIX Army camp. I am a
security policeman and was on routine patrol at the time. N.J. State
Police, and Ft. Dix MP's were runnig code in the direction of Brownsville
N.J.. A state trooper then entered Gate #5 at the rear of the base
requesting assistance and permission to enter.  I was dispatched and the
trooper wanted access to the runway area which led to the very back of the
air field and connected with a heavily wooded area which is part of the
Dix training area. He informed me that a Ft. Dix MP was pursueing a low
flying object which then hovered over his car. He described it as oval
shaped, with no details, and glowing with a blueish green color. His radio
transmission was cut off. At that time in front of his police car,
appeared a thing, about 4ft. tall, greyish brown, fat head, long arms, and
slender body. The MP panicked and fired five rounds from his .45 Cal into
the thing, and one round into the object above. The object then fled
straight up and joined with eleven others high in the sky. This we all saw
but didn't know the details at the time. Anyway, the ting ran into the
woods towards our fenceline and they wanted to look for it. By this time
several patrols were involved.


2. We found the body of the thing near the runway. It had apparently
climbed the fence and died while running. It was all of a sudden hush-hush
and no one was allowed near the area. We roped off the area and AF OSI
came out and took over. That was the last I saw of it. There was a bad
stench coming from it too.  Like ammonia smelling but it wasn't constent
in the air. That day, a team from Wright-Patterson AFB came in a C141 and
went into the area. They crated it in a wooden box, sprayed something over
it, and then put it into a bigger metal container. They loaded it in the

3. I will be getting out of the air force in about two months. Do Not

parents will forward it to me or I will be home already. Don't send it
here because they monitor all mail closely and I again don't want to take
any chances.
