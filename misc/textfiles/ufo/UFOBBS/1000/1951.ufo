In part one of this series,  UFO
focused on the background of Milton
Wm. Cooper. Cooper's information
raises many questions, especially in
light of its sensationalist nature and
the potential harm it may cause to
unsuspecting, gullible innocents.

   During the latter part of 1988 and
the very first part of 1989, Cooper's
story varied widely from what he is
presently disseminating. In early
January 1989, Cooper was interview-
ed by a California researcher, Paul
Shepherd. An excerpt of this inter-
view follows. Cooper: ''While serv-
ing in the United States Navy in
1972, I participated the intelligence
briefing team of the Commander-in
Chief of the United States Pacific
Fleet .  .  . During this participation
on the intelligence briefing team, I
came across a document called the
Grudge Bluebook Report Number
13, and a file called the Majesty
File .  . . classified Above Top Secret
with a MAJIC classification, which
means MAJI controlled; MAJIC is
the Majestic Agency for Joint In-
telligence.  It is the organization that
controls all the operations with UFOs
and with an alien race that is present
on the Earth.'' In later interviews,
and especially after he began accus-
ing researcher Bill Moore of being an
agent of the secret government,
Cooper began claiming that any file
with the word "Majestic or forms
thereof, are a fraud, a lie.''

 Attempting to check on Cooper's
claim of belonging to a permanent
intelligenee briefing team while serv-
ing in the Navy between 1970 and
1973, which would have allowed him
access to some classified documents,
UFO called the United States Navy
to determine how the Navy conducts
its briefing teams. UFO spoke to Lt.
Commander Ron Morse at the Office
of Information-West.
  Lt. Commander Morse stated that
the Navy did not have permanent
briefing teams, but would form a
temporary one on a need basis.

 "Usually if a team is put together,
it will last for no more that two
weeks," Morse said.
  Many of Cooper's claims have
been disputed not only by John
Lear and Bob Lazar, but also by
Tony Pelham, former reporter for
the Las Vegas Bullet newspaper. All
three men told UFO Magazine that
Cooper admitted early on that he
had never been on a briefing team,
but had in fact "taken the
documents, copied them and then
returned them.''
 ''Cooper told me that while he
worked on the graveyard shift, he
would wait for the Lt. JG [Junior
grade] to go on a coffee break, and
then somehow get into the classified
files," Pelham said. "l asked him if
he broke into the files, but he never
answered me.
  ''Cooper then told would
take a number of files,copy them,
and then carry them out in his lunch
pail. He said he did this until he got
all the files he needed." Cooper call-
ed Pelham in early August. "He asked
me why I had turned away from
him. He is really upset about all the
people who are attacking him . . . he
said that if I turned against him, he
will crucify me next." Pelham also
reports that when he asked Cooper
about his claim that all his stolen
government documents were lost in a
garage fire, Cooper refused to give
the date or location of the fire so
Pelham could check the police or fire
records, and would give no explanation
for refusing to provide information
that would validate his story.

records, and would give no explanation

that would validate his story.

  Other unsubstantiated information
from Cooper has apparently
stimulated the fears and concerns of
some people who have undergone the
''abduction''experience. East coast
researcher Marianne Shenefield, a
nationally-known abductee who
works with many abductees, called
UFO on several occasions and ex-
pressed her own concern about what
she heard while dealing with abduc-
tion victims. She told UFO, "When
Bill Cooper's paper 'The Secret
Government' came out, I had ab-
ductees all over the U.S. calling me.
Cooper said in his paper, and was
claiming in his lectures, that the
government was going to round up
abductees and put them in concentra-
tion camps.
 ''I knew it was going too far when
two abductees whom I have worked
with were talking about committing
suicide. They were terrified that the
Army was going to come into their
homes and take them off to concen-
tration camps.''
 Cooper has stated that he
doesn't care who his information
hurts or who it helps, but that he
will continue to put it out there
because people "deserve the truth."
 In his paper ''The Secret Govern-
ment," Cooper falsely claimed that
''Stanton Friedman has told me and
many others that years ago he helped
develop a nuclear reactor the size of
a basketball, to power an aircraft. It
was clean, turned out hydrogen, and
worked like a dream". UFO called
Friedman, a respected nuclear
physicist and one of the top
ufologists in the United States.
''Cooper's claim is totally
fraudulent,'' Friedman stated.
 "There is no truth to it at all."
Friedman expressed bewilderment
when asked why he thought Cooper
would make that claim.

THe 'Orange'

  UFO Magazine was present in the
fall of 1989 at a UFO conference
hosted by the UFO Data Research
and Intelligence Center, in Modesto,
California. Bill Cooper was one of
the speakers, and during the course
of his lecture was asked by a member
of the audience if he knew how
many types of aliens were presently
on earth. Cooper answered, "There
are four types, and four only. . .
one group (is) very human looking;
as a matter of fact they are starring
on television in "Alien Nation," the
Orange. . . .

According to the casting director
of Alien Nation, Irene Kagan,
these remarks of Cooper's are
totally false. ''I can assure you that
all the 'alien' actors on the show are
human," she said. "I hired them."
  On a recent broadcast of the "Bil-
ly Goodman Happening" on KVEG
from Las Vegas, researcher Lars
Hansson (see article, p. 17) debated
Cooper on the air and pointed out
some of the inconsistencies that
Cooper has espoused. Hansson
brought up the fact that at one time
Cooper himself gave Bob Lazar his
''stamp of approval.'' Cooper
vehemently denied ever having en-
dorsed Lazar's authenticity,
  UFO has been following the Lazar
story since it broke upon the UFO
scene. Cooper's claim that he never
gave Lazar his support or claims of
legitimacy is untrue. On November
21, 1989, Bob Lazar was a guest on
the Billy Goodman Happening, and
during the audience call-in phase of
the show, Cooper phoned in and said
the following over the air: "I'd like
to clear up a couple of misunderstan-
dings here. Number 1, I would really
like to thank Bob Lazar for coming
forward. I have been talking to him
for the last year, along with John
Lear, we have met in groups and
privately. The man (Lazar) is a
wealth of information. I am tickled
pink that he has finally decided to
come forward and use his real name,
because it helps all of us. .  . the
reason he has gotten into this
predicament is because he is a
Patriot. He cares about this country
and that is what made him do this. .
.'' Goodman then broke in, saying,
''That's beautiful, Bill, an unsolicited
testimonial, basically, that's what it
comes down to. "
   Then Cooper continued, ''First,
I'd like to say that I personally, and
also Tony Pelham and also the
Channel 8 news staff-George
Knapp and several other people,
John Lear-we have all investigated
this man's background thoroughly
because we did not want to be suck-
ed into a trap by the government.
And I can tell you that he is who he
says he is. He has worked at Los
Alamos. He is a physicist, he is a
theoretical physicist. He has worked
at AFea S4 in Groom Lake. We
have verified all of this-not just me
but several other people, and I have
verified it by two different sources of
mine who are in the government.
One is at Lawrence Livermore Na-
tional Laboratories .  . . We are
always on the lookout for somebody
trying to trap us and something that
we ean be discredited by. We have to
do that [background research] to
protect our own credibility.'' Cooper
has subsequently attacked Lazar with
claims that he knew all along that
Lazar was fraudulent. In his CAJI
Newsletter, he now presents a com-
pletely different tone than before,
and writes of "Lazar, the so-called
physicist who claims to have seen
flying saucers.

This information was not included into the Cooper story, and as
promised, I will now relay it.

Cooper, during his initial exposure in the public, was on the Billy
Goodman Happening over a year ago. One of the people that heard
Cooper was a well known Hollywood entertainment figure, Michael
Callan. Callan was fascinated by the information that Cooper was
giving, and ended up contacting Cooper. Callan, and a close friend
of his, Doug Deane, decided that they would use their entertainment
contacts, and professionally "market" Cooper. Callan and Deane set
up a business called "Need to Know Productions", and sunk money
into setting up Cooper on the "lecture tour".

Callan and Deane videoed Coopers lectures, and gave him the benefit
of their combined knowledge of Hollywood to go out and sell
himself. Setting up Cooper at lectures, and finding an agent for
him at "Spotlight Enterprises", Callan and Deane made a heavy
investiment. Cooper signed a contract with Deane and Callan, and
when he saw how much money he "could" be making, tried to squeeze
Callan and Deane out of their contract. Callan had had suspicions
earlier when Cooper spoke to him about trying to squeeze Stan
Barrington (business manager) out, but then Cooper found out that
it would cost him $15,000. Barrington stayed, but one night, Cooper
indulging in his childish temper tantrums, and drinking heavily,
made 10 ( thats TEN ) phone calls to both Callan and Deane,
threatening them with public ruin, death, property damage, and
slander if they did not give him the master copies of the tapes
that they had videoed for him. Both men (Callan and Deane) ended up
phoning the police, and they had Cooper placed on file.  Later,
Cooper went to Deanes home, was witnessed by Deanes gardner, and
tried to force his way into Deanes house. Later, when Deane
returned home, found all the tires on his car slashed.  It is
interesting to note, that one of Coopers threats to Deane mentioned
his car tires. The police investigated, but it ended up that no
charges were filed.

Prior to the above events, one of Coopers invitations to speak were
from a German UFO groups. Cooper was invited by Michael Hesseman,
a German "New Age UFOlogists" to appear in Germany.  Cooper had
accepted, and demanded 5000 Duetch Marks ( $3000 US ) plus his
plane ticket, room, board, and the other things that Hesseman had
promised.  Hesseman sent Cooper all of the above, but because of a
German Postal Strike, word of the event was late in getting out in
Europe. Cooper had planned, according to Hesseman, in making money
in "workshops" while the UFO event was going on, and because the
event would not be so well attended, became upset. Hesseman offered
to rescedual the event, or set it up later, but Cooper refused, and
then told Hesseman that if he wanted him to come, he needed another
5000 Duetch marks, or he refused. Hesseman did not have the money,
so Cooper informed Hesseman that he would not fly over, and then
refused to refund Hessemans cash.
