To the Editor:

     I  am  specifically  writing  because  of  the  alleged  UFO
sighting that occured in Easton.
     Now,  I  will  admit  right up front that I  would  describe
myself  as a real hard core UFO buff.   I search for  UFO-related
materials,  and own at least one UFO pre-recorded video and  many
books on the subject.  The subject is one that I find fascinating
and I am not afraid to admit it.
     The  recent 'incident' in Easton doesn't really surprise  me
and  the so-called excuses that are put forward when they  cannot
find  a  miserable excuse or a conventional explanation are  just
pathetic.
     Now,  as  far  as  I know,  blimps,  or  the  more  accurate
technical  term  airships,  do  not  often fly  at  night  and  I
sincerely  doubt  that one would be over the geographic  area  of
Easton,  either.  There are also rather few airships operating in
the  entire  nation,  which reduces the odds that it would  be  a
'blimp'.
     I  do  not  know  that some alleged  UFO  sightings  in  the
American  southwest,  specifically Nevada,  were very likely  the
recently  revealed Lockheed F-117A stealth attack fighter  bomber
and  not UFOs.   This is a case where the government exploits the
UFO  issue as a cover to test secret and  experimental  aircraft.
It is reported that the F-117A is wedge-shaped,  painted black or
dark  indigo blue and has its engines buried inside the  airframe
with large air mixing exhaust nozzles that mix hot engine exhaust
with  cool  air.   The end result is a very quiet  airplane  that
makes a kind of a low whining or buzzing sound when in flight.
     The  geographical  area  of Easton isn't too  far  from  the
Danbury  area and adjoining Duchess County area of New York state
where there have been numerous reports of UFOs, including alleged
landing  sights  and even reports of UFO  abductions,  which  are
technically known as close encounters of the fourth kind.
     The  fact  is that the people will never  get  the  straight
truth  from  the government because it has a vested  interest  in
keeping  the issue obscure and out of the mainstream of  American
political thought.
     The American people have heard every lame excuse,  including
the  cliche' weather balloon,  and in the case of Duchess County,
were told of snowmobile engine powered ultralight aircraft flying
in formations of various shapes and sizes.
     Because  these aircraft don't have any running  lights,  and
because,  unlike some military aircraft, they do not have special
radars  and  infrared  equipment to allow them to  fly  in  total
darkness, this doesn't make sense either.
     We are simply being lied to.
     I could rule out that the air force is testing either the F-
117A or other experimental stealth aircraft, but keep in mind the
government  prefers  to test such aircraft for safety  and  other
reasons in the southwest specifically in the Nellis Airforce Base
area and the Tonopah, Nev., region.
     Because  I  don't  expect the federal government  to  reveal
their secret UFO information,  which everyone knows they have,  I
simply  expect the government to tell the truth about  when  they
are and when they aren't testing experimental aircraft,  and when
they really aren't sure what's out there.
     I am coming around to the view that the government might not
be able,  for good reasons,  to really reveal all they know about
UFOs.   While it has been treated like a joke,  it is also a dead
serious issue.
     The  truth of alien visitation to the Earth may just be  too
much for many people, especially if the recent speculations about
genetic experimentation are true,  and I personally believe  they
are.
