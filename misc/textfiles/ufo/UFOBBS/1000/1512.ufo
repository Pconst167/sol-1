       Over the Portuguese coast (Sagres),the cmdt. Rodrigo Freitas was
   alerted by the flight mechanic technician,Francisco Duarte,because of the
   existence of a few strange lights in front of them.
       Mr. Freitas said that  there was a formation  of fdive lights or objects
   who formed a central block.Two of the lights were spinning.
       The phenomenon left a trail behind.The  event took place 80 miles   away
   of the airplane.At that point  the Boeing was flying at  a speed of 900 Km/H
   and  was 19000  ft above  ground.The objects,or  lights,were reported  to be
   16000  ft  higher.They tried  to  find  out if  somebody  else  from another
   airplane had  seen the phenomenon and  they got the information that another
   crew from a  South African Airways  airplane had observed  the same event 40
   minutes before. Knowing   the other airplane's  position,Mr. Rodrigo Freitas
   calculated that the  phenomenonhad moved at a  speed of 36000 Km/H.Later,Mr.
   Freitas made a report which  was sent to NASA in  the U.S.A.,as was usual in
   this kind of observation.

   Strange manoeuvres executed  by ufos were  observed by the  crew of a Boeing
   707,two workers from the Control Tower  at the airport,a worker in the hotel
   of Acoteias (Algarve),and several unnamed people all over the country.
       The ufo was said to be a main body extremely bright and blue, surrounded
   by otherhorizontal red or white lights.These were five to seven in number.
       Then,these lights separated from the  central body and exploded followed
   by an   enormous flash of light.
       Meanwhile,an airplane from the Portuguese  Airways (TAP) that was flying
   to southafrica almost hit the ufo which avoided it by changing direction.
       Two workers  from the  control tower  at the  airport observed  the same
   phenomenon  with  surprise.One of  them who  saw the  object with binoculars
   said it took off   with a speed three times faster than a jet aircraft.

       The "National Enquirer" dated on November 30,1976,published the
   following data about the case:
       "707 passenger jet on collision course with dazzling UFO"
   The dazzling ufo and  the Boeing 707 jetliner  carrying 101 passengers raced
   toward  each other  on a  collision course."We're  going to  crash!" thought
   co-pilot Armindo Pinto as he wrenched the plane into a steep bank.
       Startled  by the  violent manoeuver,capt.  Eloy Weigert,who  was checkin
   instruments,looked up in time  to see the ufo dead  ahead.It was so close it
   seemed to fill three quarters of the cockpit windshield.
       Spitting out what appeared to be fire  and sparks in bursts it shot past
   the portuguese airliner.Observed by two  other,astonished crewmen and an air
   traffic  controller  on  the  ground,the  extraordinary  encounter  occurred
   shortly after TAP flight  241 took off from Lisbon  airport at 2:10 AM local
   time on  September 19,bound  for Africa.TAP  is a  government-run airline.In
   their  seats in  the cockpit  were captain  Weigert,52,with 22,000  hours of
   flying time,co-pilot Pinto,34,flight  engineer,Gilberto Sarmento,48,and Jose
   Pinto,31,co-pilot  for a   second crew  that  would take  over the  plane in
   Kinshasa,Zaire.He was the first to spot the ufo.
        "We were climbing to 4,000  feet",he told the "Enquirer"."I was sitting
   behind   the capt. on the left hand  side of the flight deck and just before
   we reached    4,000 feet  I saw,through  the first  officer's window  on the
   right  hand   side  off   our   wing,coming  in   our  direction,giving  off
   flashes",Costa,59,continued:"I saw  this flying object expel
   "We were climbing and converging with  it.As we banked,it passed to the left
   and  slightly  below  us.Because  of  the  angles,and  the  location  of the
   passengers,it was impossible for  them to see.The front  of the aircraft was
   being used for cargo,and the passengers were in the rear".
        The ufo was traveling from west to east.Moments after flight 241
   encountered theobject,another portuguese 707,some 600 miles to east reported
   a strange sighting.
        Manuel Aleixo,31,co-pilot of TAP  flight 130,flying at 33,000 feet,told
   the  "Enquirer":"At  about 2:15 AM  we saw  a very bright  light moving very
   fast below  us.It was traveling from west to east and disappeared in about
   45 seconds.It didn't look like any aircraft or a meteor.We didn't know
   about capt. Weigert's  sighting,but we were  joking on the flight deck about
   having seen a ufo".

   Two pilots from different airlines observed two large ufo's as big as a navy
   ship,when they were  flying over Faro.Denis  Wood,british cmdt.,who has been
   flying for the last 20 years,said that the objects were seen by the crew and
   the radar station from lisbon.The  ufo's were reported to be sausage-shaped,
   bright and carried some  kind of mirror in  the center.At least,that was the
   description  made  by   a  witness  who   observed  the  phenomenon  through
   binoculars.The  british  pilot  got  a warning  from  the  radar  station in
   Lisbon,telling  him about  the  presence of  two  ufo's over  the portuguese
   territory.These objects werereported to be 10 Km away from the airplane.
       Antonio  Carvalheira,portuguese pilot,who  observed the  same phenomenon
   for eight minutes,said that such manoeuvres  executed by the ufo's could not
   be done by anyterrestrial aircraft.No one took pictures of the ufo's.

       The "Natal Daily News" from South Africa,published an article
   titled "UFOs as big as battleships,pilots claim".For fear of being
   ridiculed,pilots of three airliners kept  secret the sighting of three ufo's
   over  Portugal,later  described  by  one  of  them  "as  big  and  solid  as
   battleships".
       British Airways Trident jet pilot,captain Dennis Wood,who has been
   flying with  the airline for 20 years,said he and his crew first spotted the
   ufo's while flying from London to Faro,in the A
   The sighting,described by experts as the most important in the past
   decade,was  also made by the crew of a british Tristar below the Trident and
   the pilot of a portuguese airliner.All the stories tallied.
       Captain Wood,42,said he and the Tri-star crew made sighting reports when
   they   arrived  at London's Heathrow  airport but  kept it all  a secret for
   fear  of being  ridiculed.Captain Wood  has  come forward  in the  hope that
   Britain's ufo experts  will turn a serious eye to this particular sighting.
      "Suggestions that the three objects were balloons,stars or
   satellites,strange   clouds or reflections  are quite unacceptable to us",he
   said."As  I looked  to the  west we  saw  this very  bright headlamp  in the
   sky.All the  cabin staff saw  ittoo  and  I told the  passengers.Then it was
   joined by two cigar-shaped objects as big and solid as battleships".
       On the return trip captain Wood tilted his radar scanner."There,in
   exactly  the same spot  were these two cigar-shaped  things.We got to within
   seven miles ofthem when they disappeared from our screen".

   The official inquiry was conducted by the representative of the
   Portuguese government,Lt.  Henrique da  Costa Pessca,Commander  of the Santa
   Maria Airport facility.The information contained  in Lt. Pessca's report was
   made  available   to  Wing   Intelligence  Officer   Robert  D.  Gammell,1st
   Lieutenant,USAF, head  of the US  Intelligence Operations at  the Azores Air
   Transport Station  in   Lajes Field.Lt.  Gammell prepared  and submitted his
   report  to  Air  Force  Intelligence in  accordance  with  the  official UFO
   reporting format,AFR 200-2,the procedure used from 1953 through 1966,when it
   was revised for use in conjunction with the Condon Committee inquiry.
         The shape of the object was reported to be oblong,10 feet in length by
   5  feetin  height,and,of  a  light   metallic  blue  in  color.There  was  a
   plexiglass-type     section in the forward end,also blue,which contained the
   "pilot".There were fourpole-like appendages,two  at each end,which supported
   parallel aerials,and there was an orange light in the nose of the object.
         The civilian  guard,Mr. Monteiro,was  alerted to  the presence  of the
   object by a humming or whirring noise,similar  to the sound made by the wind
   passing  over   wire cables  or  telephone lines.The  object  approached and
   landed approximately  30feet from the  guard post,making  a slight nose-down
   approach to land;it  levelled off,hovered a  few feet above  the The witness
   was unable to  see any landing  gear.A blond-haired man,5  feet,10 inches in
   height,got out of a door located in the plexiglass section;he approached the
   witness,but "attempts  to converse  failed".The contact  lasted from  2 to 3
   minutes and was terminated by the  approach of an automobile.After the pilot
   reboarded and  "belted up",the  UFO ascended  almost vertically  and then
   accelerated rapidly into the night sky,disappearing in the darkness.
         The weather,according to the witness,was fair,with visibility
   unlimited.The  official weather conditions for Terceira Island (142 nautical
   miles to the  northwest of Santa  Maria Island) reported  the ceiling at 200

   the symposium,the ordinary  " Angels Hair "  became named "Fibralvis",a word
   composed from the  Latin "Fibra" (Fiber)  plus "Alvis" (Alvine),then adapted
   to Portuguese as "Fibralvina".
   Material deductions:

       The substance looks like flax which is linked by white filaments
   arranged in a random pattern.
       The filaments are from a natural source and not artificial
   fibers.They form  somekind of  felt with  wave shaped  fibers,sometimes with
   nodosity.Physical action  is the  only way  to separate  them. Compared with
   cotton it is much thinner.
       The substance  is a vegetable  product and not  animal.Its combustion is
   fast and  leaves a very tiny residuum of white ashes.                    The
   organism  found  in  the  experiments  is  entirely  connected  to  the  UFO
   phenomenon.
       This subject was presented for debate,by Mr. Joaquim Fernandes, Director
   of CEAFI at the time,as a team effort by his group.

   Mr. Pavao is a farmer.He was aged 55 at the time of the encounter  and
   deserves credibility.
   Everything  started on  a sunny  morning,as usual,Mr.  Pavao left  his place
   taking his sheep to the fields.Then,at about 11:00 hours,he heard a noise.At
   the same   time his  dog panicked,which made  Mr. Pavao  feel that something
   wrong was  happening behind  him..Then,he turned  back as  fast as  he could
   and,to his  surprise,two 8 ft  tall humanoids were  standing there,close and
   staring at him   continuously.
       Extremely tall and strong they were dressed with a complete grey suit.
   Their faces,without protection,were  close to the  human's.Only the eyes and
   skin were  different.Their hands were hairy and quite big.
      Then the strange  beings got closer  to the witness  and seeming friendly
   they   touched his left shoulder and  several other parts of his body.At the
   same time,they spoke a  strange language with a  modulation like the human's
   voice.At  this point the witness was able  to see that they had teeth,due to
   the movement  of their lips.
   Seeming to understand the  fear of the witness,one  of the beings pointed to
   the sheep,and,Mr.  Pavao told him  the name of  the cattle.Meanwhile,the two
   beings kept talking and laughing.Then,Mr. Pavao gave an order to his dog,for
   it to get one of the sheep and for a second he lo
   for the  beings to  disappear.When he  looked back  to the  place where they
   were,all he could see was an intense  flash of light which blinded him for a
   few seconds.After that everything became normal again.
     It was like a dream.Extremelly nervous and excited he returned home
   where his wife and son were surprised by the way he looked.
     This event became the subject of his nightmares for several
   nights.Mr. Pavao  can identify several languages and,says that the one
   spoken by the beings wasn'tfrom Earth.
      Materialization? Unfortunately at the time of the investigation
   there were no traces on the place.

   The following data reports  the event that was known  as "The Miracle of the
   Sun" which was witnessed by a great amount of people.


   1-Weather conditions:
      -Pressure: 749.7 mm  at 13:00 hours
      -Temperature: 13.2 Celsius at 13:00 hours
      -Humidity: 87.04 %
      -Direction of winds: W-NW (12:00/14:00)
      -Falling rain: 9.5 mm (12:00/14:00)
      -Speed of winds: 7 km/h at 13:00 h ; 24 km/h at 14:00 hours

      -Total visibility of Sun this day: 3:45 hours
      -Angle of Sun: 42 degrees 44'
   2-Before the "Miracle":
      50 000 people  wanted to witness the  event,announced three months before
   by       the         entity        to        the       three       children.
   Journalists,teachers,workers,priests,farmers,children,sick
   people,etc.,etc.,all  them,observed the  "dark cloud"  coming closer  to the
   usual place.By this,some people started praying.
   By 13:47 hours rain had gone and the sun was visible for a while.
     Another small white smoke cloud appeared over the oak tree while the first
   one  was still visible in the sky.
     Meanwhile,Lucia kept talking with the entity and,as the dark cloud moved,a
   silver "globe" was uncovered.At  the end of the  dialogue the entity pointed
   her  finger to the place where the  sun was,as if she was pretending to make
   a sign   to the silver "globe",and left.

    3-Description of the phenomenon:
       When the entity left,the clouds opened and a bright silver disk
   appeared,spinning and shining as if it was the sun.At this point the
   "miracle"  was done.It stayed like that for  8 to 10 minutes and then became
   dark.Then,for  unknown reason,the  disk looked  as  if it  would crash,which
   caused  a sensation  of  fear among  the  crowd.It took  off  with irregular
   movement.

    4-Secondary effects:
       Sick people recovered from ilness.
       Rising temperature dried clothes and environment.
       Sensation of fear,commotion and anguish.
       Environment colored by several colors.
   5-Percentage of witnesses:
      22% Farmers
      22% Housewives
      06% Lawyers
      06% Journalists
      01% Engineers


       A. Ribera's investigation concluded that the crowd that stood in a field
   at Fatima,a small village  in the district of  Leiria,some 62 miles north of
   Lisbon,on  October 13,1917,was  waiting  there for  a  miracle,because three
   children had been assured  such an event would take  place after a number of
   meetings with an "Entity" that came from the sky in a globe of light.
     The  witnesses were  shepherds:  Lucia,aged 10,and  her  cousins Francisco
   Marto  and Jacinta Marto,aged 9 and 7.
     Among  the crowd  was  Professor Almeida  Garrett,of  Coimbra University,a
   scientist,who described the phenomenon in the following terms:
        "It   was  raining   hard,and   the  rain   trickled   down  everyone's
   clothes.Suddenly,the  sun  shone  through  the  dense  cloud  which  covered
   it.Everybody looked in its direction.It  was not dazzling.I don't think that
   it  could  be  compared to  a  dull  silver disc,as  someone  said  later in
   Fatima."No.It rather  possessed a clear,changing  brightness,which one could
   compare to a pearl.It looked like a polished wheel.This is not petry.My eyes
   have seen it.This  clear shaped disc suddenly  began turning.It rotated with
   increasing  speed".

   There were a few  thousand people that could see  the "sphere of light" used
   by the entity to go to the place ofthe meeting.According to the verywords of
   the Reverand General Vicar of Leiria,who was one of the witnesses,the entity
   came  in an  "aeroplane of  light",an  " immense  globe,flying westwards,at
   moderate speed.It radiated a very bright light. "
         Some other witnesses saw  a white being coming  out of the globe,which
   several    minutes later took off,disappearing in the direction of the sun.
