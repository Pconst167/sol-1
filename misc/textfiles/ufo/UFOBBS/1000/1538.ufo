I spoke to James Oberg about this. He didn't know it had been on "Hard
Copy", but he's quite familiar with the video. Apparently it's something
that some UFO enthusiast taped off the "NASA Select" cable channel late
one night, got excited, and flew off the handle. The far-out fringe of
UFOlogy has been promoting it ever since.

Yes, it IS a piece of ice, floating in the payload bay of the shuttle
Discovery. It's illuminated by the lights in the payload bay. But what
your Trash TV program surely did not tell you is: what you saw was motion
of the CAMERA, not motion of the object. You see, NASA mission controllers
leave the camera on during the "night", while the crew is asleep. The
camera is then controlled from the ground, with a little joystick-type
arrangement. If the mission controllers want to look over here, or
over there, they just flip the lever, and the camera moves. And if
some brain-dead UFOlogist just happens to be watching as the camera
is turned away from a piece of ice, he says "Wow! Look at that baby
accelerate!!!!!!"

Well, hold on to your hats, this thread is getting interesting..

I got this off The Net just tonight:

This is from a current thread on Usenet re: STS-UFO video that Don Ecker
showed recently on "Hard Copy" . This suggests a different perspective
than what "net.skeptic" Robert Sheaffer has echoed in NASA's "It was ice and
thrusters..but no UFO's" postings on alt.alien.visitors.

Robert was quoted recently as saying:

First, I am using my wife's account.  Second, I am very familiar with
this footage (just by the description) because I was one of the researchers
who pulled the original tapes.  The trush is that the objects (not object)
were being referenced against an Earth background.  The atmosphere is
also visible as a thin band along the edge of the Earth background.
 This gives us the camera reference we are looking for.  The camera
did not move.  A rotation of the Earth versus the Orbiter reference
shows the camera very steady.

Next, we have the objects in question, and there are a couple of "hat"
shaped objects which are present at the same distance on different days.
 However, these do not make abrupt turns or accelerate.  They are very
stationary with respect to the background and surrounding smaller particles.
 The objects being mentioned that are seemingly changing velocity and
direction, are very hard to get a size fix on.  The stationary and slightly
wobbling hat types are also hard to judge size but they have a definite
observable shape to them; tophat if you will.

I am aware of Mr. Oberg's knowledge of this and the original ufologist
who brought these to our attention.  A very talented collegue of mine
and myself proceeded to do an extensive study of these and remained
collective throughout the study.  It then so happened that the astronauts
were attending a dinner locally to be congratulated on their successful
misison.  Digital zooming providing by me on all subject objects, with
color removed for clarity, and a tape of this was hand delivered to
one of the crew at this dinner.  A thorough study was promised.  By
this time, Mr. Oberg was in full defense.  A somewhat cocky attitude
was observed in his correspondence.  This was long before any rational
study was concluded.

My experiences with UFO's and video go deep into the Gulf Breeze sightings
case and beyond.  I know a tru-f-o when I see one.  The astronauts efforts,

Actually John, what I said was that IMHO it could not have been "ice", and
as far as it being a UFO, I mean in the truest sense of the word,
"Unidentified, Flying, and an Object". I SPECULATED a "shot", and the 140
degree turn was somewhat dramatic. I just received a 1st generation copy of
the tape and will have analysis done on it. I also have the official NASA
"explanation" of these events and more will be heard on this very soon.

This was just prior to the "water dump" which did have shuttle manuvers
connected with the "dump". In the dump, the camera, shuttle and everything
else did move. With event # 2, (object, "shot" etc.) nothing else had
movement. Stay tuned.
