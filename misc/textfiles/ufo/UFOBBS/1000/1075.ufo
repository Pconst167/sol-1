The discovery of a space alien doll at a UFO landing site stunned scientists, 
whose investigations have revealed the doll:

           1. Is made of a mysterious, unearthly metal.
           2. Maintains a constant temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.
           3. Has an extra eye and no mouth.
           4. Appears to be wearing a space suit.
           5. Has circular appendages at the ends of its legs.
           6. Makes the sound "nu-lee, nu-lee" when it 's turned over.
           7. Honks and snorts when it s face is rubbed.
           8. Weighs 300 pounds.

There is no doubt that this amazing doll's origins are extraterrestrial, said
physicist Milchael Dillion, who has studied the space toy since it was found
in Kenya in 1990. It's also probable that the creatures who left it here made
it in their own image, which means we now know what they look like. Because of
this doll, our knowledge of aliens has increased dramatically.

After three schoolchildren found the strange doll near their home west of Nai-
robi, police were alerted and they called in Dr. Dillon, who took the doll to
his laboratory for testing. 

There were traces of radioactivity on the doll and at the site where it was
found, indicating that it came from a spaceship fueled by nuclear power, Dr.
dillon said. And last month we identified the metal the doll is made of - an
extremely heavy alloy made of substances found in comets and moon rocks.

We are now planning to take it apart, so we can see the manufacturing techni-
ques used by people on other planets. We have much to learn from this toy.
