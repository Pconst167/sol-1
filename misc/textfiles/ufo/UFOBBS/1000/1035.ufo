PART 16

 One leader who was not immediately alarmed was Walter H. Andrus,
Jr.,  director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), one of the  two
largest  UFO organizations in the United States (the other  being
the  J.  Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies  [CUFOS]).  In  1987,
before Lear had proposed what some wags would call the Dark  Side
Hypothesis,  he had offered to host the 1989 MUFON conference  in
Las  Vegas.  Andrus  agreed. But as Lear's  true  beliefs  became
known,  leading  figures  within MUFON  expressed  concern  about
Lear's  role  in the conference. When Andrus  failed  to  respond
quickly, MUFON officials were infuriated.

 Facing  a  possible  palace revolt, Andrus  informed  Lear  that
Cooper, whom Lear had invited to speak at the conference, was not
an  acceptable choice. But to the critics on the MUFON board  and
elsewhere  in  the organization, this was hardly enough.  One  of
them,  longtime  ufologist  Richard Hall,  said  this  was  "like
putting  a  Band-Aid on a hemorrhage" (Hall, 1989). In  a  heated
telephone exchange Andrus called Hall's objections to Lear  "just
one  man's opinion" and claimed support, which turned out not  to
exist,  from other MUFON notables. In a  widely-distributed  open
letter to Andrus, Hall wrote, "Having Lear run the symposium  and
be  a  major speaker at it is comparable to NICAP in  the  1960's
having  George  Adamski  run a NICAP conference!  "  (NICAP,  the
National  Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, of  which
Hall  was executive secretary in the late 1950s and much  of  the
1960s,   was  a  conservative  UFO-research  organization   which
attacked  as  fraudulent the claims of Adamski, who  wrote  books
about his meetings with Venusians and distributed photographs  of
what  he said were their spaceships.) Hall went on, "You seem  to
be going for the colorful and the spectacular rather than for the
critical-minded approach of science; you even expressed the view-
in  effect-that having a panel to question Lear critically  would
be good show biz and the 'highlight' of the symposium. Maybe  so,
but it obviously would dominate the entire program, grab off  all
major  news  media attention, and put UFO research in  the  worst
possible  light." Hall declared, "I am hereby resigning from  the
MUFON Board and I request that my name be removed from all  MUFON
publications or papers that indicate me to be a Board Member."

 Fearing more resignations, Andrus moved to make Lear barely more
than a guest at his own conference. He was not to lecture  there,
as  previously planned, and hosting duties would be handled,  for
the most part, by others. Lear ended up arranging an "alternative
conference" at which he, Cooper, English and Don Ecker  presented
the latest elaborations on the Dark Side Hypothesis.
 Meanwhile  another  storm  was brewing. On  March  1,  1989,  an
Albuquerque   ufologist,  Robert  Hastings,  issued   a   13-page
statement, with 37 pages of appended documents, and mailed it  to
many  of  ufology's most prominent individuals.  Hastings  opened
with these remarks:

 "First,  it  has  been established that  'Falcon,'  one  of  the
principle  [sic]  sources of the MJ-12 material,  is  Richard  C.
Doty,  formerly  attached  to District 17  Air  Force  Office  of
Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  at  Kirtland  Air  Force  Base,
Albuquerque,  New  Mexico. Sgt. Doty retired from  the  U.S.  Air
Force on October 1, 1988.


 "How do I know that Doty is 'Falcon?' During a recent  telephone
conversation,  Linda  Moulton Howe told me that  when  Sgt.  Doty
invited  her to his office at Kirtland AFB in early  April  1983,
and  showed her a purportedly authentic U.S. government  document
on  UFOs, he identified himself as code-name 'Falcon' and  stated
that it was Bill Moore who had given him that name.

 "Also,  in  early  December  1988,  a  ranking  member  of   the
production   team  responsible  for  the  'UFO  Cover   Up?-Live'
television documentary confirmed that Doty is 'Falcon.' This same
individual  also identified the second MJ-12 source who  appeared
on  the  program,  'Condor'  as Robert  Collins  who  was,  until
recently,  a  Captain in the U.S. Air Force. Like  Doty,  he  was
stationed  at  KAFB  when he left the service  late  last  year."
(Collins,  a scientist, was assigned to the plasma physics  group
at  Sandia National Laboratories on the Kirtland Air Force  Base.
Following his retirement he moved to Indiana and remains actively
interested in UFOs.)

 Hastings   reviewed  evidence  of  Doty's  involvement  in   the
concoction   of  various  questionable  documents  and   stories,
including  the  Ellsworth tale and the Weitzel  affair.  He  also
noted important discrepancies between the paper Howe saw and  the
MJ-12  briefing document. For example, while the first  mentioned
the alleged Aztec crash, the second said nothing about it at all.
Hastings wondered, "[I]f the briefing paper that Sgt. Doty showed
to Linda Howe was genuine, what does that say about the  accuracy
(and  authenticity) of the Eisenhower document? If, on the  other
hand, the former was bogus and was meant to mislead Howe for some
reason,  what  does  that  say  about  Richard  'Falcon'   Doty's
reliability  as  a  source  for  MJ-12  material  as  a   whole?"
(Hastings,  1989). Hastings also had much critical to  say  about
Moore, especially about an incident in which Moore had flashed  a
badge in front of ufologist/cover-up investigator Lee Graham  and
indicated  he  was working with the government on  a  project  to
release  UFO  information. (Moore would characterize  this  as  a
misguided practical joke.)

 Both  Moore  and Doty denied that the latter  was  Falcon.  They
claimed  Doty had been given that pseudonym long after  the  1983
meeting with Howe. Howe, however, stuck by her account. Moore and
Doty said the real Falcon, an older man than Doty had been in the
studio audience as the video of his interview was being broadcast
on  UFO  Cover-up.  .  . Live. Doty himself  was  in  New  Mexico
training with the state police.
