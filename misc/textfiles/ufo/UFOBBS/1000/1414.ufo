*********** The Issues Forum  12/10/89 19:58:55


     Ted     | Tonight we are fortunate to have as our special guests...
             | Shirley and George Coyne (with Bert acting as a local host.)...
             | The Coyne's are not new to our forum as about a year ago they...
             | were guest in a similar Sunday night session....
             | For those of you who were not there the transcript is in LIB 10
             | under COYNE.CO.  Shirley is an Abductee and was mentioned in...
             | "Intruders".  Tonights CO will be formal and I will...
             | start out with a brief on-line interview...
             | Shirley,  at our last CO you were plagued with survailence by...
             | "Black Helicopters"  is that still going on? ga
     SHIRLEY | ok...
             | Funny you should mention that. At about 5:00 pm tonight...
             | a black helicopter flew slowly over our trailer....
             | It is interesting that George had told several people on
             | the 
             | phone that Bert was going to be here around that time.
             | However, Bert 
             | did not arrive until 5:30. So he did not see it. George did get 
             | some photographs of it. Hope they come out. It was low
             | enough to see 
             | the special insignia that we now recognize.  Also a few
             | months ago...
             | we were working with some abductees who were scheduled to be...
             | at our place at 7:00 pm. The copter showed up at 6:45 and 
             | hovered for 45 min. The people had had a previous experience with the 
             | copter and turned and ran when they got here and saw it. GA
     Ted     | Ok...
             | What do you think the significance is of the helicopters? Has...
             | you opinion changed since our last CO? ga
     SHIRLEY 
             | We still think it's the NSA as determined by their telling...
             | Senator Reigle to "bow out". GA
     Ted     | Please explain. ga
     George  | ok...
             | We had written to Reigle and he wrote letters to CIA, NSA and 
             | FBI...
             | trying to get them to cease harrassing us. FBI told Reigl that...
             | they were not interested in George and Shirley Coyne as ...
             | investigative subjects. And the NSA said that they were...
             | not interested in George Coyne as a subject. And the next day...
             | Sen. Reigle closed the case. GA
     Ted     | Ok...
             | Any new sightings/experiences since our last CO? ga
     Shirley | We have not had any. But there have been a number of new 
             | abuductees....
             | found who are waiting for help (regression). GA
     Ted     | Ok...
             | What is your advice to others who might find...
             | themselves victims of the abduction phenomenon? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | First we reassure them that we don't feel that any 
             | intentional...
             | harm has been exhibited, in order to set their minds at ease. 
             | ...
             | If they are not having any problems coping, we advise them to 
             | ...
             | leave it alone. Because once they embark there is no turning 
             | back. GA
     Ted     | Ok....
             | I will now open the floor to general questions GA People!
     Bill    | ?
     Ted     | Ga Bill
     Bill    | Shirley, I hope I'm not wasting the group time by asking for 
             | conjecture...
     Bill    | but...It has become quite apparent to me over the years...
             | that intelligent interests in our government work very hard...
             | to go WAY out of their way to make it bizarrely obvious to 
             | people...
             | that they are under sr
             | surveillance.  Would you care to offer...
             | a guess as to why??  What is their goal in this?  And why do 
             | you think...
             | your problems are NSA??  If the CIA didn't respond negatively 
             | to Reigle, maybe it's them.
             | ..
             | Besides, they are more often involved in the...less passive 
             | aspects of intelligence/ GA
     Ted     | GA Shirley
     Shirley | ok...
             | perhaps they are afraid we are being given secrets...
             | that might get in the wrong hands. We think it was NSA 
             | because...
             | Reigle closed the case the day after he heard from NSA. He was 
             | probably...
             | told to drop it. This was before he heard from CIA. Again the 
             | CIS said...
             | they were not interested in this. GA
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | I am sure 
             | you ment CIA not CIS....
             | GA Terry
     Terry   | Shirley, can you describe thew chopper's insignia?
             | ga
     Shirley | ok...
     Ted     | GA Shirley
     Shirley | It's an approximately two foot white circle...
             | with a small black circle in the middle of it. GA
             | Also...
     Terry   | On a black chopper?
     Shirley | the chopper is black with black windows, no numbers...
     Ted     | Does that strike a familiar note Terry? ga
     Terry   | No....do you measn a white disk with a black circle on it...
     Shirley | no letters....insignia is on left side partially on door and 
             | "nose" .ga
     Terry   | or a black circle withina white circle?
     Shirley | ok...
             | It's a black solid circle within a larger white circle. GA
     Terry   | Thanks,. ga
     julie   |  /
             | ?
     Ted     | Have you had a personal encounter or abdcuvtion since...
             | our last CO? ga
     Shirley | No we have not. ga
             | Our last abduction...
     Ted     | Ok, Julie is next
     Shirley | was August of 83. ga
     julie   | What do you think the purpose of the copter is--just letting 
             | you know they're watching?
     Shirley | ok...
             | we think they are trying to scare us out of the field...
             | because we do so much public speaking on radio, TV, 
             | newspapers...
             | private groups, etc. ga
     julie   | are you being scared at all?
     Jack    | ?
     Terry   | ?
     Shirley | We are more scared of the government than the "aliens". ga
     Ted     | Jack is next
     Jack    | Ok...
             | After reading several of the "abduction books" out on the 
             | market...
             | it seems that a common thread is the continuing (and previous 
             | from childhood)..
             | activity or interest by the abductors. Is this the case with 
             | most...
             | abductees (including yourselves) ? ga
     Shirley | Yes...
             | GA
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | Terry GA
     Terry   | If the chopper photos come out...
             | will copies be available? ga
     Shirley | Sure...
             | we also have a video from a previous encounter....
             | this on occured during a Michigan MUFON meeting with 54 
             | attendees. ...
             | We watched the video a number times that day during meeting. GA
     Terry   | How can I get a copy? ga
     Shirley | I'll see if I can have a copy made. Will try to get it to you 
             | through...
             | Bert. ga
     Terry   | Thanks. ga
     Ted     | Shirley, Jack talked about  the "common threads" from 
             | childhood...
             | can you tel us about your early childhood expereinces? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | In my first experience I was 9 years old. I was taken from my 
             | bedroom...
     Bill    | ?
     Shirley | after my mother shot at them a rifle. I was taken aboard the 
             | craft...
             | put through a painful examination. I encountered on 
             | particular...
             | entity that I know as Ooulaad. I have encountered the same 
             | "individual"...
             | on a number of occassions since that particular abduction. Not 
             | all...
             | of my experiences have been painful, and they have not all 
             | been...
             | bad. The experience in 1983 was a healing experience. After 
             | that...
             | experience I was cured of a life long bout with Lupus and 
             | Addisons Disease. ga
     Ted     | Ok, Bill is next ga
     Bill    | Shirley, I'm undergoing hypnosis with David Jacobs..,.
             | and I've recalled a number of abductions so far...
             | I feel emotionally calm, but I am not ready to accept...
             | the regression "memories" an anything other than fantasy yet.  
             | How do you...
             | distinguish the two and how long did it take you/or does it 
             | take...
             | most folks without a conscious contact experience, to accept 
             | the "memories"
             | as reality?  I have a second ? too, if there's no line. GA
     Shirley | ok...
             | first outside of Budd Hopkins, you probably could not do better 
             | than...
             | David Jacobs. He is one of the best....
             | David should be able to make a reasonable judgement as to 
             | what...
             | is fact or fantasy. It is very common...
             | to feel that it's fantasy during the first few sessions....
             | it's also harder for men to accept the experience than women....
             | because men are brought up to feel more in control. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Bill    | GA Terry
     Ted     | Ok, Bill any follow up? ga
     Terry   | Shirley, did any of your experiences o cur...
             | near St. Augustine, Fla? ga
     Shirley | One of my encounters when I...
             | was 17 was in Orlando, Florida. I think Bill had a followup 
             | question. ga
     Bill    | OK< sorry Terry...
             | Ted wanted me to ask about a thing I had on my finger...
             | It is a conscious memory, vivid.  I came home as a kid & 
             | walked...
             | in the house and there was this thing attached to my finger...
             | It was opaque, and yet you could not see the bottom...
             | It had the consistency of flesh or rubber, was on the end of...
             | my 2nd or 3rd finger from the thumb...
             | and had lots of little tiny glittery specs in it...
             | It could not be dislodged and I had no idea where it came 
             | from...
             | My parents noticed it first.  Two weeks later, just before a 
             | scheduled...
             | doctor's visit to examine it, it disappeared the same way.  No 
             | memory..
             | my parents noticed it first.  Ever heard of such an external 
             | "implant?" GA
     Shirley | ok...
     Richard Salts: (5-11 Richard) I a
     Shirley | I haven't really heard of anything like that. How big was it? ga
     Ted     | Ok...
     Bill    | It was the width of the finger, was towards the end...
             | Like a super big blister, I guess, but I'm not...
             | sure of the size of my fingers at the time.  It had no sense of 
             | ...
             | feeling or touch unless I tried to pry it off, then I felt the 
             | pull...
     Terry   | !
     Bill    | on the skin underneath.  Under hypnosis, I recalled it being ...
             | applied.  First, little holes were made in the skin, and then 
             | an...
             | adhesive was applied in the score marks and on the thing. GA
     Ted     | I have heard of something like that twice now (other than 
             | Bill)..
             | First time ws fro, Budd Hopkins and the "Glittery" implant..
             | was in a young boy's chest.  It "popped" out and broke...
             | and was described as "mica" like in substance.  The second...
             | time occurance was also on the finger.  At this point I can't 
             | recall...
     GEORGE FORD: ?
     Ted     | where I read it. But it was in the last 6 months...
             | I will check! GA Terry
     Terry   | Nothing, just a silly thought. ga
     Bill    | !
     Shirley | !
     Ted     | Nothing is silly here GA
     Terry   | I'm silly almost everywhere, Ted. I just thought it sounded 
             | like a ...
             | wart.
             | Sorry. ga
     Ted     | Ah! A Mica filled "wart." Ok, GEORGE is next GA
     GEORGE FORD: DID ANYONE SEE THE MOVIE COMMUNION? WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS  ON MOVIE? GA
     Ted     | Ok..
             | George we are having a formal CO...
             | with Abductee Shirley Coyne as a guest...
     John    | Hi, all!!
     Ted     | after we get through the formal; part we can talk about...
             | general experiences. GA Bill
     Bill    | ok
             | I just wanted to clarify a detail I provided about the 
             | "thing."...
             | The tiny holes scored in my finger were painless, and done with 
             | a chrome-
             | like hook thing.  Glue was dropped in there, and then the 
             | adhesive that was...
     GEORGE FORD: YES
     Bill    | placed on the "thing" was actually placed.
             | ...
             | on the RIM of the circular thing.  This made it impossible...
             | for me to get anything underneath it and pry it off.  It 
             | wouldn't budge.  GA
     Ted     | Ok...
     Jack    | ?
     Alf     | ?
     Ted     | Interesting!  Shirley did you have a comment? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | I have heard of situations where when the people came...
             | out of the craft, they had some sort of glitter on their body. 
             | I have...
             | not heard of the "attachment" procedure you describe. ...
             | This past week right after a series of "dreams" that George and 
             | I...
             | both had, we discovered a small yellow ball a little larger 
             | than...
             | a beebee....
             | it is very light and scored. I have tried to cut it with a 
             | knife...
     Terry   | ?
     Shirley | and took finger nail file to it. I could not mark it at all. 
             | The three...
             | of us are sitting here looking at it right now. It would be 
             | interesting...
             | to get it analyzed. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | Yes it would...
             | Bert, as a scientist what does it look like to you? ga
     Bert    | ok...
             | It looks pretty much like Shirley described. It sort of looks 
             | sort...
     Jack    | ?
     Bert    | of like a pearl, however it has some grooves in it....
             | when we look at it under a magnifying glass, it looks sort of 
             | like...
             | are you ready for this....
             | a small "brain" <grin>. GA
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | Ok...
             | (I'll refrain from comment.) GA Jack
     Jack    | ok...
             | Does the ball float ? Is it magnetic ? Also, Shirley have you 
             | verbal...
             | communication with the individual you named ? ga
     Bert    | ok...
     Shirley | We are testing it right now for flotation. Hang on...
             | OK, it does not float. It dropped like a rock...
     Terry   | ?
     Shirley | We are surprised because it is so light. ga
     Jack    | ga Terry
     Terry   | Where did you find it?
     Shirley | ok...
     Terry   | ga
     Shirley | It was in the living room besides George's chair. We are...
             | noticing right now that exposure to the water resulted in...
             | a change in color, from yellow to white. It also now seems to 
             | be...
             | acquiring some "glitter". ga
     Jack    | ?
     Bill    | !
     Ted     | Ok..
             | Alf is next GA Alf
     Alf     | ok...
     Jack    | sen 4 Bert It should be easy to measure density/specific 
             | gravity in the water
     Alf     | Shirley, among abductees has anyone reported memories...
             | of creatures that look like "elf"s (for lack of a better 
             | analogy)...
             | but not like those creatures that Strieber reports ? ga
     Shirley | Yes...
     GEORGE FORD: ?
     Shirley | we are aware of "creatures" (I saw one myself)...
             | 3 and a half to 4 feet tall...
             | brownish yellow hair about 4 inches long....
             | and they are stockier than the "grays"...
             | they sometimes wear a brown hooded cloak. When I saw it, George 
             | and...
             | another abductee were in the room with me, and they did not see 
             | it. ga
             | He laid his hand...
     Shirley | on my shoulder and then disappeared. ga
     Ted     | Tery is  next. GA Terry
     Alf     | !
     Terry   | I asked mine and was answered, Ted. ga
     Bill    | ?!
     Ted     | Ok.. GA ALF
     Alf     | thx...
             | Shirley , what you just said was NOT comforting! ..what did...
             | you mean it 'disappeared' ? (that I didn't expect you to saY!) 
             | ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | it was just as if it moved out of our dimension into another. 
             | The...
             | same way it probably came in. ga
     Alf     | ?
     Shirley | I know it's hard to swallow, but it's the truth. ga
     Ted     | Ga Alf
     Alf     | Was it in your room , your home? ga
     Shirley | It was in the home...
     Alf     | !
     Shirley | of an abductee that we were interviewing. ga
     Ted     | Ok..
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | Bill is next. GA Bill

             | Is glitter still appearing?  What color(s) are showing up?..
     Shirley | ok...
     Bill    | My both appeared and disappeared on uneventful walks home from 
             | the...
             | local swimming pool, so I was wet at the time. GA
     Jack    | ?
     Shirley | After holding the round thing, were are all noticing now...
             | that there is a little glitter on our hands. The thing is 
             | still...
             | it's changed color (white). It now seems to have a few ....
     Jack    | !
     Shirley | small black specks in it. ga
     Ted     | Ok..
     Bill    | F-U?

     Ted     | The order is: Alf, Terry and Jack GA Alf
     Alf     | thx...
             | the reason I brought up the 'elf' issue is a 'dream' that I 
             | had...
             | and I always brushed it off although it was so...
             | REAL.  I had just finished taking a shower and returned to...
             | my room. Sitting at the end of the bed I noticed after a few...
             | moments the presence of a very small person at the head of 
             | the...
             | bed. Dressed in all white. Looking at me with his round eyes 
             | with...
             | no white part to them, slighltly parted mouth with pure white...
             | teeth.  He had whispy whiskers, whitish/grey and grey hair...
             | skin was like someone from India but skin of a baby!...
             | I then heard a noise like someone was pushing an enevelope 
             | under my door...
             | and when I turned around he had gone!  It took quite a while 
             | tho...
             | and I was able to observe him very well...
             | even made sketches of it/him...
             | ga
     Ted     | OK. Terry then Jack. GA Terry
     Terry   | About these little creatures, Shirley....
             | Could you see them if you looked directly at them...
             | or only peripherally? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | Yes I was looking directly at him and saw him clearly. ga
     Terry   | Okay. Thanks. ga
     Ted     | Ok..
             | Jack GA
     Jack    | ok...
             | Shirley, are there any plans to have the ball analyzed. I would 
             | be very...
             | interested in the results. ga
     Bill    | ?
     Shirley | ok...
             | we were just talking about that. We will try to find a lab. 
             | Maybe...
             | Bert can help us on this. ga
     Jack    | ok...
             | I think I would document and photgraph it (and maybe )...
             | do some simple tests, just it case it gets "lost". ga
     Shirley | Good points. ga
     Ted     | GA Bill
     Bill    | This seems to be a ? that comes up...
             | over and over again.  At the risk of getting my...
             | "file" reactivated, shouldn't MUFON or CUFON or whoever...
             | select a scientific volunteer panel to study various aspects...
             | of precious physical evidence??  People you trust. GA
     Shirley | ok...
             | MUFON is actually in the process of doing that for exactly...
             | that purpose. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | GA George
     GEORGE FORD: thx...
             | Shirley, concerning your abductions experiences...
             | what do you think of Mr. Streibers works...
             | since he is / was foremost a fiction writer.. of war storees, 
             | etc. ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | we know Mr. Streiber well...
             | he is primarily a writer and has a good imagination....
             | he told us that when he couldn't make any more money in ufos,...
             | he would go into something else. Evidently, channelling. ga
     Ted     | Did he say channeling or is that your conclusion? ga
     GEORGE FORD: i had some trouble reading transformation, seemed so far 
             | from mainstrea.
             | ga'
     Terry   | ?
     Shirley | Transformation was stories from other people...
             | based on letters he received. ga
     Bill    | ?
     Ted     | Did Strieber say he would go into channeling? ga
     Shirley | He did not tell us...
             | but he has told other people that his next thing...
     GEORGE FORD: ?
     Shirley | would probably be channelling. ga
     Ted     | Ok... 
             | Terry is next ga
     Terry   | Shirley, do y'all have an aquarium?
             | ga

     Ted     | Bill is next GA
     Bill    | Oh, sorry...
             | I was going to ask if WS was being serious or funny.  ..
             | Of course, you can channel aliens and get 2 for 1 .  That's all 
             | GA
     Terry   | ?sen 10 Well, she's been describing a snail egg...
     Ted     | Ok..

     GEORGE FORD: thx...
             | Shirley, what has been said to abductees concerning...
             | prophecies, and general timing for ufos appearance to all?  ga
     Bill    | ?
     Shirley | ok...
             | Most of the abductees that we deal with feel that...
             | ufos will eventually be coming en masse. ga
     Ted     | GA BILL
     Bill    | En masse with hostility or to rescue us or as tourists??..
             | and, Is it common for abductees...
     Alf     | !
     Bill    | to WANT to interact with the "others" and to...
             | obsess years before thinking of this seriously about 
             | interacting with the,m?  GA
             | ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | first they are necessarily coming as hostile visitors, but 
             | they....
             | are coming for their own purposes. This comes up while people...
             | are under hypnosis and the people are usually shoced when 
             | they...
             | realize this. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | Ok.. GA ALF
     Bill    | FU?
     Alf     | perhaps if we could time their coming...
             | just right we might be able to ...
             | make a bundle at Wall St! ga
     Ted     | GA Terry
     Shirley | NOT necessarily hostile (correction). ga
     Terry   | Shirley, do they have any apparent weaknesses that you've 
             | noticed?
             | Physical or mental? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | I think they fear our size and strength and that's why...
             | they contol us. Perhaps WE are the hostile ones. ga
     Alf     | !
     Ted     | Ok...
     GEORGE FORD: !
     Ted     | Bill is next witha (F)ollow (U)P [FU] - sorry about the ..
     Bill    | I've already asked it in private, but I never..
             | did really get an answer about my "obsession" with them..
     Ted     | missunderstanding Bil) GA Bill
     Bill    | for years before I ever...

             |  GA
     Ted     | Ok GA Alf
     Bill    | Is that common, Shirley?  GA
     Alf     | ok...
             | perhaps indeed we are the hostile ones, but...
             | size and strength never seemed to favor the Gorillas in 
             | Rwanda...
             | and we might be talking here  of a space faring 
             | civilization(s)...
             | so much farther ahead of us than we of the Gorilla. ga
     Ted     | Good point Alf. ga
     Shirley | True. ga
     Ted     | GA George
     GEORGE FORD: thx...
     Bill    | !
     GEORGE FORD: we might be as in Zecharia sitchin's "Wars of Gods and 
             | Men"...
     Terry   | ?
     GEORGE FORD: are we created, prodigy of these people, have got in fight 
             | with them in past? ga
     Shirley | ok...
     Ted     | Comments George and Shirley? ga
     Terry   | ?
     Shirley and George: ok...
             | There is a possibility that they were involved with the ancient 
             | Sumarians....
     GEORGE FORD: ga
     Shirley and George: or some other group...
             | and contributed to our more modern evolution. ga
     Ted     | OK, GA Bill
     Bill    | As a child, I would go outside with a flashlight...
             | shine it up at the stars...
             | and say "I know there are people up there....
             | Come and visit me.  At least let me see you.  Fly by ONCE.!"...
             | This was YEARS before seeing UFO books in school or any of this 
             | stuff.  Is this...
             | type of early conscious manifestation of a history usual ??  GA
     Shirley and George: ok...
             | Yes, this is common. I (Shirley) used to sit on the step when...
             | I was five and look up at the sky and be angry...
             | and ask why they brought me here. And said why don't you come...
             | back and get me. ga
     Bill    | ?
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | GA Terry
     Terry   | You think they fear our size and strength; what about....
             | our weapons? Have they expressed any interest in....
             | gun control?
             | ga
     Shirley and George: They're not afraid of out weapons. ga
     Ted     | GA Bill
     Bill    | But is an emotion of lonliness and longing for them...
             | usual as well as fear and anger?  And do you feel...
     Terry   | ?
     Bill    | you are genetically or socially or spiritually partially with 
             | them...
             | and not with the remainder of Earthly humanity??  GA
     Shirley | ok...
             | Longing and loneliness is very common...
             | at some point in your experiences you seem to get over....
             | your fear and anger and beging to grow spiritually. I don't...
             | necessarily feel that I am "with them", however, I also feel 
             | that....
             | I don't belong here. I don't feel that I belong to the people...
             | that I call my family. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Ted     | GA Terry
     Terry   | Do the aliens show any sign of having, recognizing or 
             | understandxing...
             | a sense of humor? ga
     Shirley | Yes...
             | when I was 9 years old, during that experience, I said I...
             | don't know what the word unique is when he used it. He patted...
             | me on top of the head and chuckled and said that he would...
             | teach me many things. ga
             | They can also show anger. ga
     Ted     | Ok...
             | Any other questions? ga
     Bill    | ?
     Alf     | ?
     Ted     | GA Bill
     GEORGE FORD: ?
     Bill    | How many times have you been hypnotized in total by now?
     Ted     | GA Shirley
     Bill    | GA
     Shirley | ok...
             | about 15 times. ga
     Ted     | GA ALF
     Alf     | ok...
             | you said, Shirley, that they can show anger...
             | now that sounds very threatening! How have they...
             | manifested anger? to you? others? reason? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | the being got angry with me because he told me what to do ...
             | to help George with a heart problem. It frightened me and I 
             | jerked...
             | my hand away, and he grabbed my hand and put it back...
             | on George's chest. And was angry with me and told me...
             | that "I would do it". He told me to put my left hand on...
             | Georges chest and it felt like an electric shock. That is 
             | what...
             | frightened me. George was having chest pains and trouble 
             | breathing. ...
             | The result was that George's problem eased up. ga
     Ted     | GA GEORGE
     GEORGE FORD: ok...
             | Shirley, the aliens responses to the abductees..commanding, 
             | anger...
             | makes them seem god-like,,any abductee msessages concerning...
             | religious tie-ins, to any earth relighions, reincarnations> ga
     Ted     | Any others? ga
     Shirley | ok...
             | The beings have told us that reincarnation...
             | is a fact. As far as religion goes, the beings have told us...
             | that we are all of one "supreme being". ga
     GEORGE FORD: ?
     Ted     | Ok...
             | It is getting late and I would like to thank...
             | Shirley and George Cpyne for being our VERY special...
             | guest tonight.  Also I would like to thank Bert for...
             | traveling to the Coynes' and acting as our local..
             | host in Michigan. Any final comment  Shirley or George? ga
     GEORGE FORD: send 4  that we are like an atom in some larger existence 
             | "dimension?"
