                            Abstract


     In 1976 an unmanned NASA Viking spacecraft successfully photographed 
the surface of the planet Mars.  In the subsequent 13 years, a mystery has 
loomed . . . a mile-long, 1500-ft high humanoid "face" discovered in a 
northern Martian desert called "Cydonia."  Initially dismissed by NASA as 
"a trick of light and shadow," new analysis presented in this paper [see 
MESSAG.RSH, Lib 7] reveals a far more complex situation, and a far more 
significant conclusion:

     The "face" and its surrounding "enigmatic landforms" appear to be a 
carefully layed-out, highly-sophisticated, redundantly encoded 
"mathematical and geometric CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence) message" on the Martian landscape -- in the tradition of 
century-old proposals by Gauss, Lockyer, et al..


     This paper presents the evidence whereby the authors have reached this
"radical conclusion."  We -- one of us a science generalist and former NASA
consultant, the other a geomorphologist -- detail the extensive geodetic 
and mathematical analysis of "the Face" we have conducted over the past 
several years: specifically, its geometric relationship to other, equally 
enigmatic objects in the immediate vicinity.  This evidence includes 
multiple appearances of two specific mathematical constants: "e" and "pi," 
derived by angular measurement of the placement of key morphological 
objects around the "face" and the discovery of redundant angles and derived
constants from that placement.  We have also discovered the two constants -
- "e" and "pi" -- "coded" in the geodetic siting latitude of the "complex" 
on the planet.

     It is this multiple, diversified, but converging geodetic, geometric 
and mathematical evidence that, in the authors' opinion, now robustly 
supports the "radical conclusion" presented above.

     The geometry and mathematical constants we have discovered at Cydonia 
appear to be a highly-specific communication of "embedded tetrahedral 
geometry."  Its apparant purpose: the geometric prediction of a specific 
geodetic latitude -- 19.5 degrees N. and S. -- resulting from the location 
of the vertices of a "circum-
scribed tetrahedron" rotated inside a planetary or stellar sphere.   This 
conclusion is reinforced by the geomorphological observation of a major 
"tetrahedral pyramid" at Cydonia -- connected geometrically (by a 19.5-
degree angle offset to the local geodetic meridian) to equally obvious 
morphological representations of "spheres" at Cydonia itself.

     The purpose of all this appears to be to direct attention towards 
"something occurring at these two specific planetary latitudes."  When 
examined by the authors, using published geodetic planetary maps from NASA 
and U.S Geological Survey sources, these latitudes are observed to be 
associated with a hitherto unknown planetary and stellar energy phenomenon 
-- blatantly emerging at these specific latitudes -- on astronomical 
objects all across the solar system, including the Sun.  Further, the 
appearance of these "energy outpourings" seems to be modulated by the 
polarity of the planetary (or stellar) magnetic dipole moment -- raising, 
in the author's minds, the possibility that the "message" is attempting to 
direct us to a verifiable astrophysical manifestation of a basic, "unified 
field," connecting planetary angular momentum, gravity, and 
electromagnetism with surface energy release.

     The possibility that "the message" is directing us to, not merely 
energy transfer but energy generation, is also considered in this paper.  
Several convergent observations of the outer planets, most recently from 
Voyager 2, are presented to buttress our contention that we may be looking 
at a new astrophysically-
significant form of energy.  Evidence is also presented that some 
manifestations of this energy may be altering the local "gravitational 
space-time metric" -- consistant with current theoretical interpretations 
of tetrahedral mathematics by specialists, as "representative of higher-
dimensional n-spaces."  And, based on the "Cydonia equations," a specific 
prediction is ventured: that Voyager 2 Neptune observations will reveal a 
magnetic field polarity OPPOSITE the earth's, thus parallel to the fields 
of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

     The implications of these "real world" geophysical manifestations of 
"unified field tetrahedral mathematics" -- specific, localized energy 
release on planetary surfaces, apparently unrecognized until the "Cydonia 
tetrahedral mathematics" were decoded by the authors -- are profound: 
ranging from a possible breakthrough in the centuries-long search for a 
Unified Field Theory connecting the four elemental forces of Nature; to 
possible technological applications of this knowledge -- including a new 
energy source, and possibly, ultimate control of gravity itself.

     We conclude by urging immediate verification of the "Cydonia Message,"
via the 1992 unmanned Mars Observer spacecraft, as well as detailed follow-
up to our preliminary work presented here.
