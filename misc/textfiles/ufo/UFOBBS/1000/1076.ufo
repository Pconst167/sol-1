SUBJECT: Milwaukee UFO spoils fishing.                       FILE: UFO1076


08-10-89 OSHKOSH, Wis. Karen Sazama saw something strange during a
fishing trip Thursday, and it wasn't on the end of her fishing hook.

At 3:30 a.m. on waters near Omro, the Milwaukee woman saw what she
belives was an unidentified flying object. Sazama said she told her
fishing companion, Gary Michael Frye, that something funny was going
on after the pair saw a light in the sky. "It was a glowing light,
an orangish-reddish light," said Sazama, who was fishing with Frye
in a boat. "I really got scared out there. I was looking for a place
to hide in the boat." Sazama said the light stayed in the sky from
20 to 25 minutes before it disappeared.

The pair were fishing on the Fox River and Lake Butte des Morts. "The
fish weren't even biting," Sazama said. "We got nothing for fish, not
even a bite. I told Mike `I think the lights had something to do with
it."' Frye said the couple rented a boat from George's Bait Shop near
Omro at 7 p.m. Wednesday for a night of fishing. Frye said he's sure
the light was a UFO. "Yes, I would say it was a UFO. It was something
I had never saw before. I do believe in UFOs," Frye said. "(The light)
was bigger than a star. It was falling, but not very fast." The couple
reported their sighting to the Winnebago County Sheriff's Department
at about 8 a.m. Thursday.

George Wilz, owner of George's Bait Shop, said this's the first time
anyone ever reported an unusual sighting to him. "I know (Sazama)
was all shook up," Wilz said. "To me it's kind of serious." But did
the lights scare off the pair for good? "I don't think this will prevent
us from coming back again," Sazama said. "I just hope we don't see
anymore lights like that again."
