======================================================================
======================================================================

  NOTE:  Late December, 1989 phone interview between Billy Goodman
         of Las Vegas based KVEG Radio, and Grant Cameron, UFO
         researcher from Winnipeg, Canada.  Goodman is recently
         known for his nightly 3-hr radio program, "Billy Goodman's
         Happening".  Cameron is co-author of the soon to be publicly
         released, "UFOs, MJ-12 & THE GOVERNMENT", a report centering
         around the activities of a prominent Penn State President.

  <CAMERON>: "I wanted to quickly ask you about this Mr. Lazar,
              you've had this guy on your show a number of times?

  <GOODMAN>: "I certainly have yes."

  <CAMERON>: "What's your gut feeling on this guy?"

  <GOODMAN>: "My gut feeling?"

  <CAMERON>: "Ya."

  <GOODMAN>: "He's telling the truth."

  <CAMERON>: "Is that right?"

  <GOODMAN>: "Oh, ya.  I probably shouldn't say that word - telling
              truth.  As far as I'm concerned, what he has said and
              he has been on my show twice, and I've talked about it
              wide open and nobody has disputed it.  I have to go by
              the...nobody has disputed it.  It's been all over the
              west coast.  My show goes into ten states.  If people
              had any desire to dispute it they could have.  No one
              has.  Other people have confirmed it.  Some people say,
              "Ya they know about it".  They are saying it very non-
              chalant."

  <CAMERON>: "You have other people who have worked there?"

  <GOODMAN>: "They are very nonchalant saying they know there is
              activity there."

  <CAMERON>: "Some of your tapes are circulating around, and a lot of
              researchers are now working on this case."

  <GOODMAN>: "Terrific.  Let them circulate and let them contact me
              personally and we can go from there, but you've called
              me when I'm in the middle of about 9 different things.
              I'm producing a special.  You talk about a tape that is
              going to circulate.  I'll probably have the best show of
              the entire year coming up New Years Eve.  I'm going to
              have the Best of Bob Lazar, the Best of Bill Cooper, and
              the Best of Virgil Armstrong.  This is going to be a tape
              that the world is going to want.  All of their inside
              information."

  <CAMERON>: "Is there anyway I can get a copy of this tape?"

  <GOODMAN>: "I can give you a number.  It's area code 702-564-4404.
              I call the man Rodger the Dodger, but his name is Roger.
              And he tapes every one of my Happenings.  He has copies
              of everyone of my Happenings going all the way back to
              August.  He can run down who we have had on, basically
              what was discussed, what really outstanding information
              was revealed.  He has it all down pretty good - more so
              that I have.  So you are a UFO researcher?"

  <CAMERON>: "We're dealing in a paper that deals with a very high
              ranking Navy person that we are going to expose.  It
              will be published in 30 to 60 days."

  <GOODMAN>: "Why are you going to expose him?"

  <CAMERON>: "He's former President of Penn State."

  <GOODMAN>: "But why do you want to expose him?"

  <CAMERON>: "We want to prove there is something to this."

  <GOODMAN>: "Great.  Oh there's something to it my friend.  What are
              you talking about.  We had over 200 people up in the
              middle of the desert that saw it."

  <CAMERON>: "You were at the test?  You were on the Special?"

  <GOODMAN>: "That's where I was."

  <CAMERON>: "On the KLAS Special?"

  <GOODMAN>: "That was me.  You can imagine what we were doing up there.
              We had over 200 people.  You saw the busload of people.
              We are talking about a lot of listeners that don't imagine
              things.  I'm talking about doctors and lawyers.  We had
              policeman there too.  There's no fabrication here.  Every-
              body saw it."

  <CAMERON>: "Have you done any pressing to get any statements from
              anybody?  From Groom Lake or Nellis?"

  <GOODMAN>: "I've had them on my show.  They're on tape with what they
              saw.  I've had callers policeman say, "I can't say anymore
              but I was there and I saw it."  It's all over the tapes.
              As far as written form, no.  I don't do that kind of thing."

  <CAMERON>: "I was meaning the officials.  They must be denying this?"

  <GOODMAN>: "Well of course they're denying it.  Well theirs no denying
              it.  No one's denying a thing.  What are you talking about?
              There has not been one denial.  We had Senator Bryant on
              here - the Senator of Nevada.  He didn't deny it.  He says
              he can't talk about it.  That's what their answer is.  The
              Undersecretary of Defence said its too Top Secret to even
              discuss what's going on up there.  Your talking about an
              area where everything goes on.  Anything goes on there.
              Have you got my office number (gives it).  If you want to
              do an interview - some inside information or something.
              It's all happening here - there's no question about it.
              I guess you're getting the tapes.  This New Year's Eve
              thing will be phenomenal."

              "Lazar has been on at least two times.  Maybe once more
               where he called in.  He describes the UFO.  He describes
               touching them.  He describes how many there are.  What
               do they look like inside.  How their made.  How they get
               here.  I mean its phenomenal.  You call the office and
               we'll do an interview and put the whole thing in pers-
               pective."
