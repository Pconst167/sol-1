                               [From N.C. MUFON]
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Shelby Daily Star in Shelby, N.C. ran the following:

A womans body was found in Cleveland County over near PPG (a fiberglass
making plant).

According to offical sources her throat was cut.

Her body was partially clothed, she had on a watch, and three rings, a
diamond on each hand.

The body was estimated to be no more than eight hours old. And the cuts were
said to be "smooth"

An autopsy was performed at Chapel Hill, N.C. and the cause of death was
"unknown"

Now a person who works at the hospital where the body was taken has said:
"her tongue was cut out, and the skin around her chin and partially up her
left cheek was missing. There was no blood on the body, no bruises.

This happened sometime late monday night or early tuesday morning October 29
or 30th. Will keep you informed if I find out more.
