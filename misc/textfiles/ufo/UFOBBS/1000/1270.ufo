UFOS RETURNED TO FYFFE FRIDAY NIGHT

By Susan Stockman

     Residents  of  Fyffe don't know what it is,  or  where  it's
coming from, but they know they are seeing something.
     For  the  second  time  in as  many  weeks,  numerous  Fyffe
residents  reported  seeing an unidentified  flying  object  over
their town Friday night.
     The  reports  of 'something in the air' started around  7:30
p.m.,  the  same  time of early night sightings  on  February  10
occurred.
     Most  reports  were of a round,  bright object with red  and
green flashing lights.
     According to Rhonda Gibson and her sister,  Jill Worley, the
object  appeared  to be at tree-top level when they saw  it  near
their home Friday night.
     The  sisters were returning home from Fort Payne  when  they
spotted the object hovering over the tree tops.
     Gibson  said it was 'just sitting there,' and when they  saw
the  object,  they decided to follow it,  and turned into a  dirt
road  to  get  a closer look.   Worley said she had  'never  seen
anything like it in her life,' and it 'scared her to death.'
     According to Gibson,  after watching it outsider her car for
several minutes 'it just disappeared, like turning off the lights
at a football field.'
     After the object vanished,  Gibson said she returned to  her
car and went to her parent's home.
     The sisters spotted the object again while at their parent's
home, but said it appeared to be further away in the night sky.
     After  checking with the Fyffe Police Department,  they were
told  they  were not the only ones to see the craft  that  night.
The Fyffe Police Department received some 40 calls from residents
who saw the object.
     Gibson said after the object vanished, several airplanes and
a helicopter flew directly overhead,  and there were reports from
witnesses who say they saw an unusual amount of aircraft activity
in the area during the sightings,  and several identified some of
the planes and helicopters as military.
     According to Kathy Green,  a Fyffe resident who also saw the
object, said she and friends had gathered to play cards and first
observed  the object from the window of the home around 7:30 p.m.
She  said the group shared binoculars and watched the  object  in
the cold night air until it disappeared some two hours later.
     In an interview from his Arlington, Virginia home, Philip J.
Klass,  an editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine
for 35 years, told The Weekly Post that 99.999 percent of all UFO
sightings can be traced to a bright celestial body, such as Venus
and Mars.
     Klass  said the eye can be deceiving,  and given the weather
conditions  at  the  time of  the  sightings,  the  objects  were
possibly  Venus or Mars.   Klass stated that the shapes could  be
due  to  atmospheric distortion,  and that all people  have  some
slight stigmatism problems with their eyes.
     'The  disappearance of the object could be attributed to the
rotation  of  the earth,  or a cloud passing  over  the  planet,'
according to Klass.
     Klass  also stated that there was no way to accurately judge
the  distance or size of the object,  making it appear larger  or
closer than it is.
     However,  residents of Fyffe don't believe what they saw was
a star or a planet.
     All  military  bases,  such as Fort McClellan  in  Anniston,
Maxwell  Air  Force  Base in  Montgomery,  Fort  Rucker  in  Fort
Benning,  Georgia,  and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville,  told The
Weekly  Post  that,  to their knowledge,  there were no  military
exercises  in  the  north Alabama area during  the  time  of  the
sightings.
     A  spokesperson for the Lockheed Aircraft Plant in Marietta,
Georgia  said  no aircraft experiments were  being  conducted  by
Lockheed,  and the same answer was given by Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville.
     A check with the Federal Aeronautics Authority revealed that
no  experiments  took place during the sighting times,  to  their
knowledge.
     However,  a  check  with the National  Guard  in  Birmingham
revealed that the airspace in north Alabama, including that above
Fyffe,  is a training route for aircraft,  and is utilized by the
entire Southeastern states.
     The   National   Guard  spokesperson  said  night   training
exercises  were common in the area,  sometimes at an altitude  of
just several hundred feet off the ground.
     Although  no  agency would confirm the  fact  that  military
exercises  or  experiments  were  being  conducted,   many  Fyffe
residents believe that is what is taking place over their heads.
     Investigators  from  the Mutual Unidentified  Flying  Object
Network,  a  national  organization  that tracks  UFO  sightings,
reportedly  will be in Fyffe Friday night to ride with the  Fyffe
Police in hopes of sighting the object again.

A Letter to the Editor
-----------------------

DEAR EDITOR:

     There has been a lot of fun made of the two police  officers
from Fyffe, Alabama, who saw the UFO the week of February 10th.
     Now,  I  have never seen one myself and I have never  really
paid too much attention to what I read in the papers about them.
     Anything  is  possible in the world.   I have  known  Junior
Garmany  and his family for almost all his life,  and Fred  Works
for several years.  If they tell that a rooster chews tobacco you
can raise up its left wing and look for its spit cup.
     Besides, Junior and Fred were not the only people to observe
this UFO.  Different citizens saw it.
     Also,  there  were other officers in the area to see it  but
for some reason they did not come forward with their verification
of what they saw.
     I wonder why?
     All  these people who are throwing fun at these officers for
what  they saw should be shaking their hand for making Fyffe  the
UFO capital of the nation.
     UFO  defined  does not mean they saw a  flying  saucer  with
little green men and bulging eyes.
     It means 'unidentified flying object.'  To my knowledge, the
object they saw has not been identified.
     At  least  it makes me more aware that we are  under  police
protection in our area.
     Utmost  respect  to  these  two officers who  were  not  too
embarrassed or afraid to come forward with what they saw.
