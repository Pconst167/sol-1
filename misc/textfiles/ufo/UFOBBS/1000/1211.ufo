                            ROUND AND ROUND THEY GO
              NEW CROP OF ODDITIES HAS BRITISH GOING IN CIRCLES.

          A rare set of concentric rings lies quietly awaiting the answer
     of why -  and  how  - English crops are being sculpted.  Some of the
     circular depressions measure up to  100  feet  in diameter, and they
     have been cropping up in southern England since 1976.

          LONDON - Behind the hedgerows and stone fences of rural Britain
     lurks the Mystery of the Field Circles.

          The puzzle over the circles - large round areas  where maturing
     crops have been  partly  flattened and entangled - is something of a
     modern-day Stonehenge riddle for  the  millions  of Britons who have
     been reading about them all summer.

          Amid local  media  reports  of  newly  appeared  circles,  many
     Britons have taken to making Sunday drives in the country to see the
     mystery for themselves.  Even  the  international  press  has become
     interested.

          Pat Delgado,  a retired British  electrical  engineer  who  has
     written a book about the circles, said they can be up to 100 feet in
     diameter.  He has reports of circles being noted  as  early  as  the
     early 1950s, but  said  the  number  has increased dramatically this
     decade.

          "Last year there were 98 altogether," he said. "This year there
     have been 240."

          The circles,  which  appear  overnight  and  are  sometimes  in
     clusters, have been  found in fields of oats, barley,  corn,  wheat,
     rye, beans, spinach  and  other crops. Typically, the plants are all
     bent in the same direction, sometimes with their stems, branches and
     leaves interwoven in intricate symmetry.

          "These crops are not damaged in any way," Delgado said.
     "They are laid down and continue to  grow  and ripen in a horizontal
     field."

          Delgado said that for years the circles seemed  to  be confined
     largely to fields  on  three counties in southern England, including
     Wiltshire, the home  of  the Stonehenge  standing  rocks  that  some
     theories connect with ancient visitors form outer space.

          This summer, however, the circles have appeared  in  many  more
     counties throughout England.

          Delgado said  he  doesn't  subscribe  to any "little green men"
     theories, but he doesn't have any better ideas, either.

          "I'm as mystified as when I  started  investigating  nine years
     ago," he said. "The only progress we've made is by  elimination.  We
     have eliminated whirlwinds and hoaxes. We have eliminated crop over-
     fertilization and the wind vortices theory and animal intervention."

          One farmer, Geoff Cooper, called a nearby British military base
     to complain after finding circles in his fields this summer.

          "We thought  their  helicopters were doing it on exercises," he
     said.  "But they sent an expert round and he said a helicopter could
     only make that shape if it was flying upside down and stationary."

          Cooper said one neighbor believes  the  circles  are  caused by
     hedgehogs rolling over  and  over in the fields, but  he  calculated
     that it would  take  40,000 of them to make the circles in his field
     in one night.

          Some newspapers during the summer  reported  that  the  British
     Ministry of Defense was investigation the circles,  but the ministry
     denies it.

          Delgado, who   worked   for   the   British   Weapons  Research
     Establishment and NASA on missile-tracking  systems before retiring,
     wrote his book,  `Circular  Evidence',  with Colin Andrews,  another
     electrical engineer.

          They got  involved when a fellow engineer asked them to look at
     some circles found in a field near  his home. Delgado bristle at the
     suggestion that he might be regarded as a crackpot for spending time
     investigating the circles.  The  fact  remains, he  says,  that  the
     circles exist, and no one has explained them.

                     Additional information obtained from
              the January 31st, 1990 airing of Unsolved Mysteries

          Of particular interest are two points, the first involves the
     focus of the circles in a general triangle around  Stonehenge with
     a majority  of  the  others  being  proximal  to  other menhirs or
     megalithic structures.

          The  second is  by far  the  most interesting especially when
     considered in conjunction with our DNAMAST file.  It showed a view
     of the base a wheat stalk which was bent as if the stalk had been
     melted in one area, folded over and allowed to cool.  DNA, a complex
     molecular structure present in all tissues, can be "melted" in a
     process known as "denaturation".  This causes the hydrogen bonds
     which hold the "stair steps" to the "rails" of a double helix.

          When the bonds are disturbed, usually by heating at temperatures
     beginning at about 70 degrees Centigrade, the rails break up.  If
     the structure is allowed to cool before complete separation of the
     rails is achieved, in many instances the stair steps will re-form
     in the identical pattern as before.

          Bearing this is mind, we can see that some form of energy was
     produced in the immediate vicinity of the wheat stalks which would
     bring about an energetic state similar to that produced by heating.

          This could possible have been an anti-gravity force which we
     of Vangard believe can be beneficially used on living organisms as
     witnessed by the many UFO contact reports where the craft occupants
     indicate they are of extreme age (1000 + years) yet look in the
     early 20's or 30's.  When asked how this is achieved, the reply
     indicates that the aging process is suspended or greatly retarded
     when the under the impress of the ship's anti-gravity field.

          However, should the occupant of the craft remain away from the
     ship field too long, the aging process would resume, yet could be
     again halted if once again brought within the field of the ship.

          See the Plenum newsletter for articles on the rejuvenation
     process from a Vangard Sciences point of view.  There appears to be
     a relationship between counter-clockwise spin, cold, north pole
     energy and specific wave patterns.  More on this later.
