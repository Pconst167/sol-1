One witness observing while driving East bound a bright green incandescent 
about the one o'clock position from his car. It descended to about
35 degrees, vertically with a very slight horizontal component relative
to himself, in about one second. Witness said: At the 35 degree position
it did not fade out but rather blinked out.  He said: It seemed to
be describing an Eastward trajectory in its descent. The witnesses
vehicle was moving at approximately 30 mph at the time of the sighting.
The witness said: He could hear no sound from the object.  There were
no aircraft in the vicinity at this time witness said. The witness
is a private pilot with about 85 hours flying time logged, and does
not wear glasses.  The witness said: If he had to compare the object
with a known terrestrial object, it would be like an aircraft flare,
except that aircraft flares do not blink out, they fade, and last
much longer, and usually fall straight down.

area phoned Wilton police with sighting of strange red lights. The
lights hovered at treetop level for four to five minutes, started
to move slowly and then disappeared.  June Dober of Crosswicks Ridge
said: She and her son on Thursday night both sew a huge, hovering
object which looked like a spaceship. It flew low in the sky but didn't
make any noise, she said. About the same time that night a man asked
not to be identified said: He sew a strange light in the sky. Apparently,
other people saw it too, he said, because several cars traveling
north on Route 7 pulled over to the shoulder for a look at the sky.
Early Thursday evening, Mellissa Lorentson of Grumman Avenue reported
having seen stra- nge red lights moving at treetop level in a Northwest
direction. The witness said: The lights were very disti-nct, with
no form and were moving very slowly . Lisa Sforza a reporter with
