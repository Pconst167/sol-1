                           The Philadelphia Experiment
                         (the Invisible Ship Experiment)
                      by Alex Saunders for Search Magazine

    During the Second World War, all participant countries  were looking for
    a way to  end  hostilities  quickly, no matter how fantastic the manner.
    If some unorthodox or revolutionary  invention  could  do the trick, all
    the better, as long as the war terminated triumphantly for them.

    The U.S. Navy,  for one, seemed obsessed with the idea  of  the  perfect
    camouflage - the  ultimate secret weapon - INVISIBILITY.  If only one of
    their warships could be made invisible,  think  of  the  havoc  it could
    cause the enemy.   Havoc  that could conceivably bring  the  bitter  and
    long-enduring war to an end.

    On October 28,  1943,  an  experiment  was conducted at the Philadelphia
    Navy Yard.  This  event, appropriately  enough,  became  known  as  "The
    Philadelphia Experiment".

    A Navy escort  destroyer named the DE 173 (better known  as  the  U.S.S.
    Eldridge), with hundreds  of tons of electronic equipment aboard, lay in
    its dock.  Scientists on shore started the experiment which involved Dr.
    Albert Einstein's "Unified Field Theory",  a completed version appearing
    in the period  1925-27.  "Withdrawn" as incomplete, the  revised  theory
    returned in 1940.  The result of the experiment was brain-rattling!

    The ship faded  rapidly  from  sight  in  a  foggy,  green  mist  -  and
    COMPLETELY VANISHED!  Speechless    amazement   struck   the   wide-eyed
    scientists ashore.

    Then, after a  few minutes (another account makes that  "seconds"),  the
    ship reappeared where  it  had  formerly been, to its Philadelphia dock,
    and regained its visibility!  But that  was  not all.  Something equally
    stunning was discovered to have happened during its vanishment.

    During that period of a few minutes (or seconds) the ship  had  shown up
    at its other  Norfolk  Navy  Yard dock in Virginia!  So, not only had it
    successfully become invisible, but it had also been TELEPORTED!

    With the ship's  disappearance, so had  everything  aboard  disappeared.
    EVERYTHING!  The many   hundreds   of  tons  of  scientific   equipment,
    furniture, food, etc. - and ALL PERSONNEL SUCH AS SAILORS AND OFFICERS!

                        SOME WALKED THROUGH SOLID WALLS!

    More than half  of  them  went  insane  due  to the effects of pulsating
    energy fields and were quietly confined  to  mental  institutions.   Our
    report has it  that "they were kept at Bethesda Naval  Hospital  out  of
    communication with everybody for the duration of the war."

    Then there were  those  who,  discharged  as  mentally unfit for further
    service, were pensioned off and sworn to secrecy.  Several died.  Others
    recovered, but at what a price!

    Never were they to regain their former normalcy.  True, the invisibility
    experiment fo the  Navy ship was a total success, but to the men aboard,
    severe after-effects both physical and mental made it a real disaster.

    Some saw double,  became invisible,  laughed  and  staggered  drunkenly,
    fainted, caught on  fire to burn for days on end, walked  through  solid
    walls, disappeared temporarily and permanently, and worse.

    Worse a thousandfold  because  they  could  either  "Go  Blank"  or "Get
    Stuck".  The former,a not-too-unpleasant  after effect due to being too
    long insided the force-field, caused invisibility.  To "Get Stuck" was a
    side effect that kept the unfortunate from moving on his own volition, a
    truly Hell-on-Earth experience.

    He would remain transfixed unless two or more of the others  withing the
    fields quickly touched  him.  If not, he would lapse into "Deep Freeze",
    which was definitely NOT psychological.

    Now his position  must  be marked out  carefully  with  the  force-field
    cutoff.  Unable to  move,  and  unaware  of  time as  we  know  it,  his
    "unfreezing" could occur  in  an  hour  or  so  only  if another fellow-
    sufferer approached him and touched  his face or bare skin.  Or it could
    take twenty-four hours.  In one case it took SIX MONTHS!

    To do the  job  of  "unfreezing"  required  the construction  of  highly
    complicated equipment.  But  should  he be "frozen" for more than a day,
    he would usually go mad - "stark raving, gibbering, running mad!"

    If, within the vicinity of the Philadelphia Navy Yard a group of sailors
    were seen to be putting their hands  on  another  sailor,  or upon "thin
    air", an enlightened observer would know what was going on.

    Quoting from Moore's book, page 130 :

      "The experiment...had  been accomplished by using naval-type  magnetic
       generators, known  as  DEGAUSSERS,  which  were  'pulsed' at resonant
       frequencies so  as to 'create a  tremendous  magnetic  field  on  and
       around a docked vessel.'"

    Predictably, the Office of the Naval Information has consistently denied
    the force-field experiment based on Einstein's Unified Field Theory, and
    will send standard  form  letters  of denial, curtly worded,  to  anyone
    requesting information.

    Despite this, succeeding  issues  of  the  November,  1967 issue of SAGA
    magazine contained letters stoutly affirming the secret U.S. experiment.

    Some were written by sailors and officers  who  claimed to have actually
    been aboard the  U.S.S.  Eldridge  during  that time in  October,  1943.
    Another claimant was  the  mother  of  a  crew  member who was put in an
    insane asylum as a result, and who remains there still.  And so on.

                      THE CLOUD-LIKE MIST - GREEN IN COLOR

    When the experimental   Navy  ship   was   invisibly   teleported   from
    Philadelphia to Norfolk, the period of time that transpired  was, let us
    say, minutes-long, though as stated previously, some accounts declare it
    was done within seconds.


                                     Page 2





    Question : Where   did   the  vessel  vanish  INTO  before  its  visible
               reappearance in Virginia?

    Another dimension would be the most  logical  answer,  and  one that was
    obviously LIVEABLE.  It  had to be liveable for the simple  reason  that
    all the men  aboard  returned  once more to the ship's original berth in
    Philadelphia, not dead (as a poisonous  atmosphere would have positively
    left them), but very much alive.

    We come now  to two other great mysteries, UFOs and.....Well,  first,  I
    would ask the reader of this article to take a paper map of the world.

    Spread it on  a flat surface.  After drawing a line from Miami, Florida,
    to Puerto Rica, draw another line to Bermude and back again to Miami.

    What you will now have is a vast, watery triangle of the famous "Bermude
    Triangle" wherein ships and planes  (along  with  all those aboard) have
    inexplicably disappeared.  And  it  may very well be  that  there  is  a
    definite connection between  the  three  -  the  Philadelphia Experiment
    project, UFO's and the Bermuda Triangle.

    Furthermore, as the ships in the Bermuda Triangle disappeared, survivors
    and witnesses have reported a related  sight.   The ships were ENCIRCLED
    BY A CLOUD-LIKE  MIST,  GREEN IN COLOR - PRECISELY the  way  the  U.S.S.
    Eldridge was alleged to have vanished!

    Does this then mean that the "place" into which the above disappeared is
    the very same  "place"  where  ships  and planes of the Bermuda Triangle
    disappeared?  That is, through "doorways" into another dimensional world
    in time and space?

    Entering such a habitat was the hair-raising  claim  made by some of the
    crew of the U.S.S. Eldridge on their return from being  teleported.  Not
    only that, but they swore that while there they had SEEN, and TALKED, to
    ALIENS!

    From Moore's book, page 68, are these chilling words:

        "Presumably, if  a  vessel  could be projected into another space or
    energy continuum through mistake or  design,  it  might also be possible
    that its occupants  could encounter entities on the other  side  of  the
    curtain of invisibility, shrouding contiguous but nontangent worlds.  It
    is intriguing to  concieve  the possibility that an experiment sponsored
    by the U.S. Navy may have accidentally managed to pass through a doorway
    into another world  more  than  thirty-five   years  ago  and  that  the
    experiment and the results have been kept a closely guarded  secret ever
    since."

    So, can this other "place" be the home, or origin, of the elusive UFO's?

    For these vari-shaped  craft  have  been  observed  in  the skies of the
    Bermuda Triangle, not a few times, but many, many times.

    THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT  is  not  without  discrepancies.   Make  no
    mistake about that.  More than one are to be found, but  with  a subject
    as explosively stunning  and  momentous as the one in William L. Moore's
    book, this is to be expected.  Take these examples:



                                     Page 3





       Regarding the  time  period  of  the U.S.S. Eldridge's teleportation,
    some reports say it was a matter of SECONDS (see pages 24, 128 and 249),
    while other reports claim it was measured  in MINUTES (see pages 47, 89,
    110 and 135).

       Some reports claim the October 28, 1943 experiment occurred while the
    ship was docked in Philadelphia (see pages 130 and 131).   Other reports
    statethe experiment was  conducted  AWAY  from  the dock, out at sea (se
    pages 110 and 143).

       To add to the confusion comes a  claim  that  there was more than one
    experiment, with one  taking place at dockside, the other  at  sea  (see
    page 250).

       The copy  of  the  Navy's  form  letter  of  denial is odd in that it
    contains errors in spelling and grammar  (see  pages  134, 135 and 136).
    This from the  powerful  and  literate U.S. government!   Surely  a  top
    government agency does  not  issue sloppily composed forms?  Also, in it
    is the statement that Einstein never completed his Unified Field Theory.
    Yet elsewhere in the book mention is  made  that  the theory was finally
    revised and completed (see page 150).G
       The claim  is  made (see page 56) that "somefew people  can  somehow
    tell you a  man's  name  and his home address UNDER HYPNOSIS EVEN THOUGH
    NEVER HAVING EVER MET OR SEEN THIS  PERSON"  is  just  too incredible to
    believe.

       So much of men's existence depends on his ability  to  recollect  and
    recognize past experiences.   He  cannot  make  it through a day without
    this basic ability.   Consequently,   how   could   a   person  give  an
    individual's name, address,  etc.  when that person has  never  met  the
    individual before?

       In spite  of  the  foregoing  discrepancies  - and there are more - I
    would urge the very sober reading of  William  L.  Moore's  electrifying
    book, THE PHILADELPHIA  EXPERIMENT,  which contains much  more  than  my
    brief outline has   indicated.    Richly  detailed  and  including  many
    impressive photographs, I believe it is of paramount importance
    and should never - NEVER! - be ignored.

    VANGARD comments...

    Peter Kelly has an interesting theory  which  states  that  the magnetic
    field is gives  matter  its form while the electric field  contains  the
    information which determines the characteristics of the mass.

    Peter says that the magnetic field can be suppressed to allow access
    to the electric field.  When this occurs, the electric field can be "re-
    programmed" for the  desired  characteristics you would like the mass to
    exhibit.  The magnetic field is then  increased  while  the "charactered
    electrical field is maintained".  This then brings about transmutation.

    We of VANGARD  have  had many interesting discussions with our own group
    as well as  with researchers, writers  and  others  interested  in  such
    topics.

    If the magnetic field is intensified while being pulsed  at  the natural
    resonant field of a mass, it would act like a ballon filled with water.

    As the balloon  was squeezed, the particles which make up the mass would
    be pushed out, through a tube (4th  dimension?)  to  a point in the past
    where the mass  had  been.   At  that  point,  another   balloon   which
    represents the "phantom"  of  the  ship when it was there, would be "re-
    filled" to allow the mass to teleport to a previous location.

    Now, if the crew on the mass being  teleported  were  to panic, a sudden
    removal of the power BEFORE THE TELEPORTATION was complete  would result
    in the balloons  surging  from  one  to  another  until  equilibrium was
    restored.

    This would in turn, cause radical changes  in all structures involved in
    the process, especially living systems, refer to HOMEOPA1,  DNAMAST1 and
    DNAMAST2 on the  KeelyNet  BBS for further information as the ability of
    cells and mass to "record" patterns in which they occur.
