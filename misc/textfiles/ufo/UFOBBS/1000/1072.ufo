PART 29

Bill----Ok, tell me about Area 51.

Man-----Area 51 is at Groom Lake in Nevada.  Its the
        headquarters of Redlight.......The saucers are flown
        there.  Its part of the test range...Its on the map..
        its just a dry lake bed with a Top Secret
        installation built on and around it.

Bill----Have you seen one fly?

Man-----Yes, they are incredibly fast and make no noise at
        all.

Bill----Is the one at Area 51 the same as the one at Edwards?

Man-----One was the same....the other one I saw looks like a
        diamond.......like in a womans engagement ring.....if
        you take the diamond out of a ring and turn it upside
        down......thats what it looks like.

Bill----You mean literally like a diamond?

Man-----No, but the shape is the same.....it really
        glows....but only when it flys.  On the ground it is
        the same metal as the saucer at Edwards....when it
        flys it glows like the sun and sometimes changes
        colors.

Bill----How close were you when you saw it?

Man-----Not close...no one was allowed to get close....
        I think it emmitted radiation because we were all
        required to wear dosimeters and they had to be
        checked daily.

Bill----You mean it was atomic powered?

Man-----I don't know.....I only know there was a definate
        radiation hazard and our dosimeters were checked
        daily.  We turned them in to be checked and were
        issued new ones every day.

Bill----How long did you stay at Area 51?

Man-----The first time was for 3 months....Nobody ever stayed
        more than a few months.  The second time I was there
        was for almost 5 months.....its like wartime there
        were no passes while at Area 51....we had excellent
        recreation facilitys though.

Bill----I hate to press you but I would like to know more
        about Dreamland.  My information seems to conflict
        with yours.  I have information that the Alien base
        is in New Mexico, is that where Dreamland is?

Man-----There is more than one base and I have to go now....
        I should not be talking to you about anything at all.
        Its all too dangerous....even more than you
        think.....I don't know everything but I know that its
        way out of control and to tell you the truth I'm
        afraid of what is going to happen.....Don't ask me
        what because I don't know but........I know something
        is going to happen.......Giant underground shelters
        are being built under Groom Lake.....and in other
        places.  From reading your papers you know more about
        a lot of this than I do.....I really do have to go
        now....Its Christmas Eve and I live a ways off.

Bill----Before you go would you look over these notes and
        make sure they're right?

Man-----I watched you write and its right.  What are you
        going to do with those notes?

Bill----I'll make a file and release this in the form of an
        interview without identifying you.

Man-----If you do I'll call you a liar.

Bill----I won't identify you and just so you will feel better
        I have never identified any of my sources.  If you
        ever want to talk again you have my phone number.

Man-----I don't think so....you had better be real careful...
        I mean about yourself....I really wouldn't give
        anyone else those notes....You should think about it.

Bill----What do you think will happen?

Man-----The same thing that has happened to ......some others
        .......you should just drop it.....you....nobody can
        do anything.


The rest was just parting conversation.  He seemed to be very
sincere and very worried about what he was telling and
worried about my safety as well as his own.

This is the second person who has described a saucer at
Edwards, the same security badge, and reference to Dreamland
keeps coming up with these people.  This is the first time I
have heard that there is more than one alien base and it is
the first time I have heard of bounty hunters.  I think the
reference to a radiation hazard and the use of dosemeters is
also significant in view of the incident in Texas involving
the two women.  John Lear told me that Dreamland was at
Edwards.  Personally I do not know the location.  Just the
name "DREAMLAND" is so far away from the normal military
trend of naming projects and places that it provokes
questions.  I would like to point out that at one point my
sources told me the alien base was at Dreamland then they
told me it wasn't true and backed away from it.  The name
keeps cropping up in connection with the alien base.
Reference to loss of memory is also common with abductees.  I
found this interview to be personally disturbing.

Where possible I wrote down the questions and answers and
those are written exactly as asked and as answered.  At some
points the conversation is reconstructed from my notes but
was done as soon as I arrived home and I am certain that it
is accurate.  Having just met this man I have no clue as to
his motives or to the accuracy of the information.  However I
do believe he was sincere and the range of emotions he
expressed would have been difficult for even a very good
professional actor.

(NOTE!  A "dosemeter" is (or was when I was in service) a
piece of film in a small badge that is worn by personnel when
working in areas where they may be exposed to radiation.
If the film is hit by a dose of radiation it is exposed.  The
amount of film exposure determines the exact dose of
radiation.  When I was in the Strategic Air Command I had to
wear one because the alert pad aircraft carried nuclear
weapons.  Our dosemeters were checked weekly.  If the
dosemeter indicated that you had been exposed to radiation
then you had to go through a decontamination procedure.
During my time in service my dosemeter never indicated any
exposure to radiation.  This explanation is offered for those
of you who may not have known what a dosemeter is.)
