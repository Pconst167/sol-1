SOME SAY UFO IS AS BIG AS A FOOTBALL FIELD

     FYFFE-While  sightings of the mysterious object in the night
skies  over the Fyffe area continue,  the  occasional  television
crew,  armed  with camera,  lights and microphones,  wander  into
town,  eager  to  talk  with someone who has  seen  the  hovering
object.
     Telephone  calls from across the United States come daily to
the Fyffe Police Department from newspapers,  and television  and
radio  stations  wanting to know the most recent developments  in
the as-of-yet unexplained sightings.
     Portable signs advertise UFO specials at Fyffe  restaurants,
and  last Friday night an estimated 2,000 people flocked to Fyffe
to try to see the flashing red and green object.
     Sightings  were  reported in Fyffe and  several  surrounding
communities  each night last week,  and a news crew  from  Mobile
spent  the  night  in  Fyffe  last  Thursday  night,  doing  live
broadcasts over the radio.
     Jeff Ballard,  area director of MUFON,  said that while some
of the sightings that have been reported are legitimate, he feels
that perhaps some of them have been aircraft,  and some have been
planets  or  stars  that appear to be giving off  red  and  green
lights.
     Some  of  the reports checked out by the  police  department
were determined to be stars.
     However,  one of the most recent sightings took place Sunday
night,  near Geraldine.   A simultaneous sighting of an extremely
large object occured at 7:30 p.m.
     According to Gary Coker of Skirum, an extremely large object
with  red  and  green flashing lights on the side and  two  white
lights  approximately six feet in diameter on the bottom  hovered
some five miles away.
     Coker said he sent someone in the house for his  binoculars,
and  in the seconds it took the person to return with  them,  the
object  vanished.  "I never took my eyes off the object,  and  it
just disappeared," said Coker.
     At  exactly the same time Coker viewed the  object,  another
man five miles away, who at this time wishes to remain anonymous,
said  an  object  the size of a football field hovered  over  his
chicken house.   He said it had two white lights underneath, each
the size of a small house,  and red and green lights outlined the
sides.
     He went into his house to get a camera and when he came  out
it  had vanished.   The man said the object was close enough  for
him  to distinguish the color of the object,  and he described it
as  being  a  metallic blue that probably  would  not  have  been
visible against the night sky without the huge lights.
