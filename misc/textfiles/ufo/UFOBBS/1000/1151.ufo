OMAHA, Neb.(AP)-A cluster of flashing, multi-colored lights traveling through the sky Thursday night bedazzled and confused onlookers in different parts of the state.
     "It was moving quietly, and parallel to the ground," said Kristy Buckles, 36, of Lincoln.  She said she was walking her dog about 9:30 CDT when she saw the lights, which were heading northeast.
     "It appears there was something at the head of these lights, something metallic," she said.  "They traveled hundreds of feet, then they went through some clouds."
     John Kobar, meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Grand Island, and a dispatcher at the Douglas County Sheriff's office said they received a number of calls about the lights, described like a July 4th fireworks display.
     Radio station KLWN in Lawrence, Kan., reported flashing light sitings there, in Kansas City, and Topeka by a tower air traffic controller.
     People said they saw two parallel lights with behind, like a comet.
