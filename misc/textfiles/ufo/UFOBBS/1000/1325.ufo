LOG # 891002 - Event 09/03/89, near Ebenburg, Pennsylvania, investigator Paul

range while driving.  At first moving very slowly at utility line height, it
accelerated while simultaneously rotating counter-clockwise until lost from
view.  The vehicle was described as larger than an auto with an undercarriage
surface of gray-white transected by a broad black stripe.  A set of red lights
were at the lead apex, a set of whitish-green lights at one rear apex, and a
set of bluish lights at the other.  The youth's auto did not malfunction during
the 10-15 second encounter.
