Log # 890402 - Event 2/11/89, 11:15 PM, San Antonio, TX: duration 5 minutes.  
Lead investigator Robert Morgan.  A woman entered her kitchen and heard a 
humming.  Hovering at a distance overhead was a flat-bottomed disc.  The 
object emitted a beam which apparently extinguished a nearby streetlight and 
seemingly affected the witness in a noticeable manner.  After a few minutes 
the object moved out of view.  Immediately after, the streetlight came back 
on and a firetruck appeared on the scene.
