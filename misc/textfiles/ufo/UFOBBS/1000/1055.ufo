PART 12

In 1979, I was sent to the shores of southern Texas.  The
same type of situation, all the evidence led us to believe
that whatever it was, it landed in the water and flew away.

I understand that over twenty men actually saw it go into the
water, but the days that followed bore no fruit.  The Navy
divers had a good deal of evidence that some thing  has made
a very large recent gash on the bottom in about seventy feet
of water.

The very same magnetic field was present, and every thing
electrical in the immediate area was burnt out.  By the end
of 1979, I was sent back to the very same lake in Northern
Pennsylvannia.  It was a duplicate incident as the first time
we were there.  It had landed in the lake and was gone.  The
same electrical items were again destroyed, and the same
magnetic field was evident.  I really have no physical
evidence to prove one way or another the identification of
the air craft.  I can only examine what I have experienced
and wonder!  My opinion is another story.

I don't really believe that the air craft belongs to our
Government or any other government on this earth.  From 1975
to present, we would certainly have seen some kind of
revolutionary change in our air craft.  To date, I still have
not seen any material to even slightly match the very first
piece of physical evidence that I had examined.  That alone,
would have made a fantastic change in the material we use
today.  No corporation or government could keep that kind of
material quality under cover for over twelve years.  If they
had invented it.

After twelve years we probably don't even know what it is, or
how to make it.  I am positive that at the very least, they
have two of the air craft hidden somewhere, and probably have
learned very little from them, other than they exist.
However, the company that I was associated with has made some
gigantic leaps forward in electromagnetic forces.  Perhaps
they did learn something from it after all.  If we wish to
assume that these air craft are not from this earth, and are
from way out there in space, then my goodness, the planet
must be full of visitors.  The air traffic alone, must be
fantastic.  It seems to me that who ever they are they have
found it easier to land in the water rather  than on our dry
earth.  Perhaps it was designed to land on water or a very
flat surface.

I have never really had any feelings one way or another
abvout E.T.'s.  I have elected to deal with hard evidence
only, that was prior to 1975.  For those few years
afterwards, I could not help but interject some opinions into
my brain.

As I would rather deal with hard evidence only, I am forced
to put all of this on a scale, and take a good hard look at
the tilting of the scales.  There is far too much here to
ignore.  I must confess that I had some what leaned towards
the experimental air craft story.  But as the years passed,
it became evident that was only a cover story.  Too much time
has past, and our air craft are pretty much the same.  There
is no doubt in my mind that we as well as others, are
constantly experimenting with new air craft, however at this
late date, I am reasonably certain that those crash sites
were not made by anything that we are familiar with, and then
again, I still kind of reserve that possibility.  As you can
see, I have many mixed feelings about it.

Im addition, I have no way of knowing if I had been on every
crash site that occurred.  There may have been many more
during that period and many more since then.

I really don't know if any one had ever been removed from the
two wrecks, that I had personally seen.  Perhaps they were
only mechanical flights.  Perhaps the medical people were
only there - just in case.  And/or to test the wreck for any
form of unknown bacteria prior to removing it.  Their being
present is not really evidence that a life form was found.
It could go either way.

I just cannot imagine our government or any other keeping it
such a secret, if in fact, they were not from this earth.  It
really serves no purpose that I can understand.  Also appears
to me that if they were from somewhere else that they mean us
no harm.  I would suspect that after all these years, if they
meant us harm, we would most certainly know about it by now.

Even if they were only mechanical flights, the fact that they
could get here at all...so many times, is certainly a feat in
itself, and worthy of publication.

If the fact that they managed to get here at all, and the
physical evidence, the material that I examined is any
indication of how intelligent they are, then I would feel
safe in assuming that they have left us in the stone age.  On
a personal level, I have no fear of meeting or contacting
such a being.  In fact, the very first time I saw the craft,
the thought had entered my mind.  I didn't expect a being
like Frankenstein to come walking out.  And for a short time
I had wondered what I would do if suddenly a door opened and
some form of life came out.  What the heck!  If it didn't
look too bad I may have walked up and said hello just as I
would to anyone else who may visit me.
