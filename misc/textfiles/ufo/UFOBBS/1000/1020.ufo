EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES

 Perhaps the strangest and most convoluted UFO story of the 1980s
concerns   allegations  from  various  sources,  some   of   them
individuals  connected with military and  intelligence  agencies,
that  the U.S. government not only has communicated with but  has
an  ongoing  relationship  with  what  are  known  officially  as
"extraterrestrial biological entities," or EBEs.

The Emenegger/Sandler Saga: The story begins in 1973, when Robert
Emenegger  and  Alan  Sandler,  two  well-connected  Los  Angeles
businessmen, were invited to Norton Air Force Base in  California
to  discuss  a  possible documentary film  on  advanced  research
projects. Two military officials, one the base's head of the  Air
Force  Office  of Special Investigations, the other,  the  audio-
visual director Paul Shartle, discussed a number of projects. One
of them involved UFOs. This one sounded the most interesting  and
plans were launched to go ahead with a film on the subject.

 Emenegger and Sandler were told of a film taken at Holloman AFB,
New  Mexico,  in  May  1971.  In  October  1988,  in  a  national
television broadcast, Shartle would declare that he had seen  the
16mm  film  showing "three disc-shaped craft. One  of  the  craft
landed  and two of them went away." A door opened on  the  landed
vehicle and three beings emerged. Shartle said, "They were human-
size.  They  had an odd, gray complexion and a  pronounced  nose.
They  wore tightfitting jump suits, [and] thin  headdresses  that
appeared  to  be communication devices, and in their  hands  they
held  a  'translator.' A Holloman base commander  and  other  Air
Force officers went out to meet them" (Howe, 1989).

 Emenegger was led to believe he would be given the film for  use
in  his  documentary. He was even taken to Norton and  shown  the
landing  site  and the building in which the spaceship  had  been
stored  and  others (Buildings 383 and 1382)  in  which  meetings
between  Air  Force personnel and the aliens had  been  conducted
over the next several days. According to his sources, the landing
had  taken place at 6 a.m. The extraterrestrials  were  "doctors,
professional  types." Their eyes had vertical slits like a  cat's
and their mouths were thin and slitlike, with no chins." All that
Emenegger was told of what occurred in the meetings was a  single
stray "fact": that the military people said they were  monitoring
signals from an alien group with which they were unfamiliar,  and
did their ET guests know anything about them? The ETs said no.

 Emenegger's military sources said he would be given 3200 feet of
film  taken  of  the  landing.  At  the  last  minute,   however,
permission  was  withdrawn, although Emenegger and  Sandler  were
encouraged   to  describe  the  Holloman  episode  as   something
hypothetical, something that could happen or might happen in  the
future.  Emenegger  went to Wright-Patterson AFB,  where  Project
Blue Book had been located until its closing in 1969, to ask Col.
George  Weinbrenner  one  of  his  military  contacts,  what  had
happened.  According  to Emenegger's account, the  exchange  took
place in Weinbrenner's office. The colonel stood up, walked to  a
chalkboard  and  complained in a loud voice, "That damn  MIG  25!
Here  we're  so public with everything we have. But  the  Soviets
have  all  kinds of things we don't know about. We need  to  know
more about the MIG 25!" Moving to a bookshelf and continuing  his
monologue  about the Russian jet fighter, he handed  Emenegger  a
copy  of  J. Allen Hynek's The UFO Experience  (1972),  with  the
author's signature and dedication to Weinbrenner. "It was like  a
scene from a Kafka play," Emenegger would recall , inferring from
the colonel's odd behavior that he was confirming the reality  of
the   film  while  making  sure  that  no  one  overhearing   the
conversation realized that was what he was doing.

 The  documentary  film  UFO's Past, Present  &  Future  (Sandler
Institutional  Films,  Inc.) was released in 1974  along  with  a
paperback  book  of  the same title.  The  Holloman  incident  is
recounted in three pages (127-29) of the book's "Future" section.
Elsewhere,  in  a  section of photos  and  illustrations,  is  an
artist's  conception of what one of the Holloman entities  looked
like,  though  it, along with other alien figures,  is  described
only  as  being "based on  eyewitness  descriptions"  (Emenegger,
1974). Emenegger's association with the military and intelligence
he had met while doing the film would continue for years. At  one
point in the late 1980s his sources told him that He was about to
be invited to film an interview with a live extraterrestrial in a
Southwestern state, he says, but nothing came of it.
