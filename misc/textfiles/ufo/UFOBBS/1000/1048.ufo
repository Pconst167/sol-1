PART 5

As I walked in the small airport lobby after a 3 hour drive
from Richmond I immediately noticed 2 gentlemen who seemed
'out of place' for this locale.  Both were wearing pin
striped 3 piece suits, both had on dark glasses.  One was a
black gentleman.  One was stationed inside the lobby door
looking out at the parking lot, one was leaning up against an
airline counter.  I sat down and after a few minutes was
approached by a tall, bearded man in jeans and a heavy
jacket.  He asked if I wanted to have a drink.  We walked
outside and he introduced himself as Bill English.  We drove
in Bills car into town to a local bar.  About 5 minutes after
we ordered and had started to talk, the men I had seen at the
airport came into the bar and sat down.  We left for Bill's
house and never saw the men again for the next 2 days.

During the next 2 days I stayed with Bill and his wife and 2
children in a small trailer in the middle of a field at his
farm.  I asked him endless questions concerning the Grudge 13
document, how he happened to see it, what happened to him
after he saw it and literally thousands of questions about
the content of the document.  My impression of Bill English
was that he was totally honest, that he stood behind his
statements and recollection of the Grudge 13 papers, that he
was a devoted husband and father to his wifes 2 children.
That Bill English was ready to come forward and enter into
any debate regarding the legitimacy of the document and his
recollections thereof.  Of Bills compassion for his father
and his fathers feelings concerning Bill and the reasons for
their occasional disagreements.  I have tremendous respect
for Bill and what he has tried to do in getting this
information out to the public.  It has been at tremendous
personal risk not to mention the ridicule by sponsered agents
such as Bill Moore who has stated that the Grudge 13 papers
are a fraud.  (How would Bill Moore know?)

What follows is additional information about the Grudge 13
papers that I obtained from Bill during my visit.  In
addition to the following Bill painstakingly drew many
sketches of the photos of different types of flying saucers,
the equipment obtained from them including a sketch of the
football sized nuclear generator and sketches of the autopsy
photos.

From my notes taken during our 2 day meeting:  Bill described
a photo taken of 3 live aliens.  Very clear photo, aliens
standing against white tile wall, looking confused as if they
had been shoved, were looking in different directions.
Report said that aliens had contacted a U.S. Intelligence
Agency for initial 2 meetings, one at Holloman one at
Homestead.

U.S. Air Force relocation personnel (for persons involved in
close encounters) were referred to in report as 'men in
black'.

Major Cunningham was initially accused of murdering Sgt.
Jonathon P. Lovette.  Charges were later dropped.

Bill English's place of employment in England was RAF
Security Services Command, RAF Chicksands.

Entire Grudge 13 report was written as if report was geared
toward preparation of defenses.

Report told of ultrasonic weapons found in Germany at the end
of WW II that could shatter 4" thick armour.

Report told of sensitive military and industrial areas at
which personnel experienced missing time.

Report told about missing time experienced with personnel
associated with North American x-15 rocket plane project.

species accounted for up to the time of the report.

Extraterrestrials were referred to as A.L.F.'s, Alien Life
Forms in the report.

Report referred to one UFO that was recovered and test flown.
The UFO blew up as the 2 Air Force pilots aboard attempted to
leave the atmosphere.  English recalls the date as the mid
50's.

Report refers to flying saucer program as Project 'Red Light'
and that a secret installation had been constructed in the
middle of the Atomic Energy Commission testing ground in
Nevada.

At the time of the report 11 alien cadavers were being kept
at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

That additional alien cadavers were being stored at 4 to 5
other medical institutions.

been terminated 'to eliminate potentially dangerous elements
to the national security'.

That General James Doolittle had been mentioned several times
in the report with the notation that "His (Doolittle's)
predictions might be correct".  There was no indication of
what those predictions might have been.

A short segment containing the quotation, "By presidential
order, certain aspects of research had been undertaken."
