Log # 890603 - Event 1/18/89, Somerville, OH: duration 2 hours.  Lead 
investigator Dick Seifreid.  At 3:57 AM, a man (retired USAF noncom) was 
awakened by his barking dog.  Looking out, he observed three oval-shapes over 
trees bordering the property 50 yards away.  He woke his wife and two 
adolescent children. The family watched for most of two hours as the objects 
moved low over nearby farm buildings and land.  They displayed various bright 
colors (amber, red, green, blue and white) which covered the surfaces from an 
apparent belt or lights on each.  At one point, the father and son engaged in 
a chase with their auto before losing sight of them.  Shortly thereafter, two 
of the objects returned over an adjacent field before departing again.  
[Note:  The family subsequently reported a recurrence in the early morning 
hours of 1/27/89.]
