                                                        4 February 1990

1) Request data review and interpretation of aquired information concerning
unknown track.
2) At approx. 1540 hrs on 04 Febuary, 1990 an unknown aircraft entered
military restricted airspace on range site 2-i1a over gulf ACMI training
area. Four F-15C aircraft asigned to the 33rd tactical Fighter Wing were
scrambled to intercept and identify object.
3) Unknown would not respond to transmitted requests for identification and
no IFF/transponder frequencies were identified.
4) Pilot debriefing reviews concluded the following: the aircraft once
visually sighted, appeared to have no surface features, giving an unsure
depth of field appearance. General shape and configuration suggested  having
a lifting body design. Aircraft would appear on sweep radar at intermitant
intervals, suggesting some stealth capabilities. Pilots reported crafts
flight profile was not within any known envelope. Aircraft displayed advanced
maneuver capabilities, at times out turn and out accellerating chase
aircraft.  YE2 speed and thrust to weight suggested a high end ratio.
5) After a 22 minute engagement and multiple attempts at intercept the craft
entered the verticle and displayed constant accelleration in the verticle
until out of sight. At no time were any aggressive maneuvers noted.  AFSC
confirmed that no testing was performed at this time in that area.
6) Latest intellegence reports add that no Eastern D100 country nor known
Soviet Aircraft have the capabilities displayed by the unkknown. At time of
this dispatch incident is classified sensitive.
                               End of Report.

I thought of hatching this out over the BAMA tic, but in my evaluation it was
too significant to not be sent via BAMA, especially n the mist of the Gulf
Breeze Bashing going on.
