     An important advance in experimental research on the circles
effect has resulted from observations of the motion of vortices in
a gas-filled chamber. The experiments concern the production of
quintuplet circle sets by the impact of plasma vortices upon an
anode.

     The experiments are conducted using Tesla-generated high
voltage, low frequency currents in an inert mixture of neon and
argon gas. At certain frequencies around 150 KHZ, plasma vortices
form. The vortices are rendered luminous by the excitation of the
neon-argon mixture. The anode is spherical in shape, approximately
40mm in diameter, and is fabricated of carbon-steel alloy sheathed
in a ceramic insulating capsule.

     The vortices form spontaneously and glow brightly during their
approach to the anode. Upon striking it each vortex gives rise to
a regular set of five circles, the four satellite circles being
located at equal distances in the four right angle directions from
the primary circle. The experiment has been repeated many times.
The first color photographs taken in October 1990 using ASA 3200
film suggest that the satellite circles are created at the moment
of impact by the ejection of four subsidiary vortices from the
primary one, but the exact sequence will not be known until the
process has been filmed by a high speed video camera. Good
photographs have subsequently been taken in monochrome at F1.2,
1/250, ASA 3200 pushed to ASA 12500.

 /     This work helps to confirm the general ionized vortex theories
initiated by Dr. G. Terence Meaden for crop circle formation by
natural vortex processes in the atmosphere, in combination with the
theory of George Bathurst for quintuplet formation by satellite
 /vortex ejection. Next, it is hoped to film the life cycle of the
vortices using video film.

in a post-conference book of papers entitled "Circles from the
Sky". I welcome correspondence from interested parties)
