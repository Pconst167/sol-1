The Human Mutilation Factor
                   by Don Ecker



In the last forty years of UFO research, one of the most baffling
questions that have plagued researchers has been "Is
the UFO Phenomenon dangerous to humanity?"  Over the years, there
have been numerous cases where the phenomenon has figured into
human deaths, but as a rule, most cases have been officially
ruled accidental.  When speaking of cases where death has
resulted, usually most assume cases where military pilots have
died as a result of "chasing" the phenomenon.  One of the most
famous of these military chases that is discussed when ever the
subject of death and UFOs is raised, is the famous "Mantell
Case".  This case is so well known that I will not discuss it
here, but there are many others.  In one of the less well known
cases, during the mid 1950's, a military jet interceptor was
observed on radar being "absorbed" into a UFO over the Great
Lakes.  No trace of pilot or aircraft was ever found.  In another
case reported in the excellent work "Clear Intent" was the case
of the "Cuban MIG Incident". In this case a Cuban MIG was
locking on his weapons radar when the aircraft exploded in mid*air.
The wing man was certain that the UFO had fired some type
of weapon, but other than the jet exploding, no other smoke,
flame or other obvious weapon firing was observed.

The matter of either overt or covert hostility on the part of
UFOs has always been treated warily by serious researchers.  On
the one hand, if the enigma is hostile, then several questions
must be faced.  What if anything should the powers in authority
tell the public?  Is the government capable of handling a threat
of this type?  Is the public ready to face an issue as
potentially terrifying as a "possible threat from somewhere
else?"  Other than incidents involving military involvement, have
there been cases where civilians have been injured or killed
during some type of UFO encounter?  Is it possible that the
reported cases of UFOs and their occupants abducting unwilling
humans for some type of medical or genetic experimentation could
be true?  Now, if any of this is factual, then what ramifications
do the Human Race face in light of the above?

According to Mr. Phil Imbrogno, during the research that led to
the writing of "NIGHT SIEGE The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings" by
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip Imbrogno, and Bob Pratt, Imbrogno has
stated that on several occasions, Hynek specified that he wanted
no mention of the dozens of human abductions that they had
already uncovered at that time, to be mentioned in the book.
Hynek was afraid of the adverse publicity if word of this aspect
leaked out to the public.  After Hyneks death, Imbrogno stated
publicly on Compuserve and other public forums, facts of
abductions, animal mutilations, and EVEN several cases of
mysterious deaths of humans, that he indicated COULD possibly
be linked to the UFO Phenomenon.

While researching several stories for UFO Magazine, I interviewed
a number of prominent UFOlogists, over the last several months,
and in each case, the question of human deaths, in connection
with animal mutilations, invariably was raised.  Most readers of
this text will be familiar with Mr. John Keel, who many regard as
the last of the Great UFOlogists.  From the earliest days of
modern UFOlogy, Keel has been a force to reckon with.  The author
of numerous books that address various aspects of UFOlogy, and
magazine articles too numerous to mention, Keel has a unique
slant on the subject that most will never experience.  According
to Keel, the phenomenon has always had an unexplained hostility
towards humans, that have led to untold numbers of deaths.  While
Keel will be the first to explain that he rejects the ET
hypothesis, he does not doubt the phenomenon a bit.  In what many
UFOlogists consider as one of Keels best works "The Mothman
Prophecies", E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc. 1975, Keel related report
after report of animal mutilations involving cattle, dogs, horses
and sheep, and also related what were called "vampire killings"
of four humans in Yugoslavia, were the victims were "mutilated
and drained of blood".

After having spoken to John Ford, the Chairman of the Long Island
UFO Network, for a news story for UFO Magazine, I became even
more convinced that the aspect of potential UFO hostility should
be investigated.  Ford relayed a numbing number of animal
mutilations, human disappearances, human abductions, covert
Federal involvement in areas that suffered high numbers of animal
mutilations, and even armed military helicopters that chased UFOs
over civilian communities.  Ford, who is a officer of the Federal
Court system, did investigations into the disappearances of
mostly young adults over a year period, in areas of high UFO
overflights, and after having several personal friends who were
police officers of the local municipalities look into the
situation, came to the conclusion that the facts were being
suppressed.  The reason given was that there was "no need to
panic the public."  Although no iron clad proof can be made for
direct UFO intervention, the circumstances are extremely suspect.

After growing up in an age where the entire human race can be
decimated by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the human
race somehow manages to keep slogging on.  I have seen more
people "panicked" over a shortage of gasoline than imminent
nuclear holocaust, yet somehow when the subject of UFOs crop up,
the government doesn't want to panic anyone.  It really makes me
wonder what they know, that I should.  I really don't think that
they are going to talk to anyone soon, as you shall soon see.

In January, 1989, it came to the attention of the MUFON State
Director of Idaho, Mr. Don Mason, that cattle mutilations had
occurred once again in the southeastern section of Idaho.  After
an investigation by a MUFON investigator, the facts were as
follows.  The animals ( two cattle, same night, but each owned by
different ranchers ) were "somehow" killed, sexual organs removed,
body fluids drained, patches of hide "surgically"
removed.  All the appearances of what is today considered to be a
classic case of animal mutilation.  As of this date ( February
15, 1989 ) the final lab reports are not back yet, but already
the Sheriffs Department has labeled it a "cult killing."  No
tracks, tire or human, around the animals even though it had
just rained, no unusual activity reported by the ranchers that
evening, and one animal was found next to an occupied house.
One of the ranchers admitted that this was the second time he had
been "hit" by the mysterious mutilators.  The last incident had
only been a bit over a year previously, and they were worried
enough that all had their "deer rifle" within easy reach.

After having been personally involved in an investigation of
cattle mutilations as a police officer back in 1982, I was very
familiar with the "cult" theory of perpetrators.  The Idaho
Department of Law Enforcement drags it out every time there is a
new rash of mutilations.  The problem is, and every one is aware
of it, that no one has yet been brought to trial, or arrested yet
for these crimes.  Out here in the west, people know that you are
flirting with a ranchers bullet if you are caught fooling around
with the ranchers cattle.  They are his livelihood, and he will
defend it.  Yet, the mutilations keep occurring, and no one is
any the wiser, or are they?

With the subject of animal mutilations fresh in everyones mind, I
was once again speaking to Don Mason, when he informed me that
the investigator that had been assigned to the above mentioned
case had come across a very mysterious death of a man back in
1979.  According to the report, two hunters in the Bliss and
Jerome area of Idaho had literally stumbled across the nude body
of a man that had been hideously mutilated.  The body was in the
literal middle of nowhere, nude except for a pair of underpants,
his sexual organs had been removed, his lips sliced off, and
several other classic mutilation cuts.  Although he was in very
rugged country, his bare feet were not marked as if he had walked
in that terrain, but yet no other tracks, animal or human were
evident anywhere.  After the police were notified, an intensive
search was mounted, and miles away, the mans possessions were
recovered, yet no one yet knows how the body ended up where it
was found, or even more importantly, what happened to him.  It
should be noted that this area also had over the years, many
unexplained UFO reports and cattle mutilations.

Now I must explain that I had very mixed feelings about whether I
wished to attempt to explore this subject any further, or allow
sleeping dogs to lie.  On the one hand, I wanted more than
anything to discover just what was occurring, and on the other, I
realized that this had the potential to backfire on someone that
disturbed the status quo.  I was familiar with reports of human
abductions and mutilations that had surfaced in the last several
years in reports such as the Lear documents, Grudge 13 reports
and others, but yet I was not sure what I believed, or even if
there was anything to believe.  I ran across a friend that was still
employed with a police department in this area who was a
detective.  I had mentioned to him the recent cattle mutilations,
and what I suspected in the above mentioned case of a human that
had been mutilated.  Scot had also been involved in the last
several years with several cases of mutilations that he had been
called upon to investigate, always with negative results.  He was
as curious about this phenomenon as I was, and since he was still
an active duty police officer, he had access to the department
computer, to access the NCIC system that is maintained in
Washington D. C. by the FBI.  After giving Scot the criteria for
a search of unexplained human deaths, that involved factors of
mutilation, I asked that the search go back to at least 1973,
involving this area of the Northwest.  Scot ( not his real name )
ran the request through the department computer.  As he mentioned
at the time, he had expected to get realms of reports back that
we would have to wade through, to get to the reports that would
be are further study.  Scot ended up requesting that the inquiry be
run back to 1970, and involve not only Idaho, but also Utah,
Nevada, Oregon, and Washington states.  Because of the magnitude
of this search, Scot stated that it would take about one week to
get the results back into his department.  As a side note, for
anyone that is not familiar with the NCIC system, it is a
national data bank for Law enforcement agencies all across the
United States.  It is maintained and controlled by the Federal
Burea of Investigation, at FBI headquarters, in Washington D. C.
On the 14th of February, Scot contacted me in person, and
appeared very troubled.  His exact words were that "something is
really screwy, Don."  "I got the request back from NCIC on
Monday, and there has gotta be something wrong.  They told me
that they had NO unsolved murders at all, zero, that met that
criteria.  THAT ANY FURTHER REQUESTS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE BY
VOICE, TELEPHONE CALL, WITH PROPER AUTHORIZATION.  Somebody is
sitting on something, big as Hell."  I also knew that something
was as screwy as hell.  After all, anybody that has had any
dealing with law enforcement knows about the "Green River Killer"
in Washington state.  This serial killer is credited with at
least 30 to 40 murders of young women, and to this date, the case
is as big a mystery as ever.  Many of the killings showed some
types of mutilation, and if nothing else, at least some of these
homicides should have shown up.

Once more, as a side note, I had been warned by a prominent
UFOlogist, that there was a lid "screwed down tighter than you
would believe in regards to human mutes."  I also was warned that
in order to break through the secrecy, was going to be a long and
sometimes weary job, but that if enough persistence was applied,
then it was possible to get to the bottom of this facet of the
UFO enigma.  Do I think that this can be solved, along with the
rest of the puzzle?  Yes, I do, because I think that the secrecy
can only be maintained for so long, and then no longer.  I also
believe very strongly that only if the entire UFO community works
in concert will this be accomplished, and the infighting and arguments
MUST CEASE for the good of us all.  

On the ParaNet system and on Compuserve, I wrote and uploaded a
file entitled LIGHT.TXT, and in UFO Magazine Vol. 3, No. 5 I
called for a UFO summit to be held in order to get the UFO
community organized and to present a unified front.  Only by a
unified front, and calling for Congressional hearings, will this
lid ever get torn off, and the truth that is suppressed be
brought to the light of day.  Any help from the members will be
greatly appreciated, and I can be reached at ParaNet RHO at the
following number: 1)208)338)9187.
Also I can be reached on Compuserve by EMail, and my user number
is: 74270,3360.  Anyone with ANY INFORMATION is requested to
contact me at the above addresses as soon as possible.  The
secrecy game has gone on long enough.  It is past time to get to
the bottom of this.  Forty years IS LONG ENOUGH.
