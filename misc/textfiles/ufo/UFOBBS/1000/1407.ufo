     In the year of 1984, a group energy concept called Antahkarana
was given to the planet. In the ensuing years many phases of the Star
People Connection have been pursued to the present moment. Now the
plans for expansion are appropriate.

     We wish to present the following plan for your consideration. A
headquarters for national growth and development will be located in
Seattle, Washington. We are accepting applications for Coordinators of
other major areas within your state and Network Coordinators in
outlying areas connected to the nearest branch.

     The Seattle Branch will serve as a template for the further
expansion to other major cities in neighboring states. Those combined
energies will be designated regions and our plan is to ultimately
connect with each other through the National Headquarters.

     The purpose of a branch is to offer the higher, appropriate
energies a focus through which the plan for the further spiritual
development can manifest. Antahkarana is a group of "DO IT" people
whose purpose is to bring forth the energies of the Three Fold Flame.
The Three Fold Flame is represented as that which is focused through
the Heart chakra of Love, Wisdom, and Power.

     The aforementioned energies are focused through three identified,
out of body, groups: The Angelic Kingdom, The Masters of the Planetary
Hierarchy, and the Intergalactic Confederation of Space Brotherhood.
These three paths are honored individually although a particular group
or individual may have a particular focus.

     The major purpose on the Earth plane is to offer mutual support
to Star People/Light Workers to pursue their individual path of
spiritual growth while cooperating with the Greater Plan of Personal
and Planetary Ascension. Let it be known that we believe this
evolvement is happening throughout the omniverse.

     An emphasis is on the development of the Star Person/Light Worker
through cooperation with their greater self and other aspects
sometimes referred to as starseeds or walk-ins. A spirit of
cooperation is to be fostered on all levels and the art of negotiation
with spirit to perform the appropriate bridging between all levels and
dimensions.

     The participants in Antahkarana, The Star People connection, are
taught the Top Down View, "A Unifying Perspective of the Visitor
Experience," dealing with discernment of the various energies
contacting the earth plane individuals and groups. The most important
idea is to honor all paths.

     A spirit of cooperation with other Light Groups is fostered and
participation in Antahkarana is available to those who resonate with
the aims and purposes as published in the statement of purpose.

     The overlying emphasis is on creating a strong spirit of unity
rather than separation. The individual is honored and taught how to
integrate into the grater whole. Bridging on all levels, both vertical
and horizontal, is promoted.

     We are seeking Light Workers who have a strong sense of
dedication and commitment to their path with a great sense of the
evolving events happening on the planet and with the aim of assisting
the higher realms to manifest that plan on Earth. The individual is
able to maximize his need for spiritual growth while simultaneously
participating in the greater good for all.

     In every sense of the usage, Antahkarana: The Star People
Connection, is about building bridges and coming from the heart. The
original Sanskrit work means "The Bridge" and is the esoteric word for
the bridge between the heart and head and the bridge between Heaven
and Earth.

     ANTAHKARANA is for YOU. It is to assist you in becoming all that
you have chosen to be. We offer you the following opportunities to
experience:

  o  Something that will bring joy to your spiritual body and expand
     awareness of your greater self.
  o  A challenge for your mental body by assisting you to get a top
     down view and a unifying perspective of the mass of material
     regarding the visitor experience.
  o  Fun for your emotional body, support and fellowship. Balance to
     your physical body as it enters into its full potential as a
     light body/upper dimensional being of divine origin.
  o  Wonderful opportunities for networking and support with your
     individual path through such activities as our "Ambassadors from
     the Stars Talent Bank," a newsletter and a monthly networking
     conclave potluck.

     We have enjoyed meeting you in the past. We send you our love and
goodwill. We hope to see you again. As we close all of our activities
by saying, so also will we close this letter: "In Love we come
together, in Love we serve together, in Love we share together and in
Love we shall come together again."

     PEACE, LOVE, AND LIGHT

                           ANTAHKARANA IS:

  o  For Star People who want to come out of the closet.
  o  For Star People who want to stand up and be counted.
  o  For those who want to reach up and reach out.
  o  For Star People who want to remember their heritage and accept
     their destiny.
  o  A "Do it" group that believes just knowing is not doing.
  o  A belief that no one is perfect or has to have all the answers
     before he/she starts.
  o  A belief in love, support and fellowship.
  o  A belief that spirituality can be fun.

or starting your own branch, or if you have any questions in general,
