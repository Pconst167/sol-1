     Ordinarily,  I don't feel I have to explain my actions regarding this
     board  or  this network. I think I've developed a pretty good reputa-
     tion  for  reliability  and  fairness. I certainly owe nothing in the
     way  of an explanation to Messrs. Cooper and Lear. However, I can see
     where  some confusion may have arisen regarding my actions, especial-
     ly  on  the  part  of  Don Ecker, whom I have a great deal of respect
     for,  and  on the part of other users who have discreetly inquired as
     to my reasons.

     These  things  always  seem to come best in the form of chronologies,
     and so, a brief chronology follows.

     Bill  Cooper first contacted this board with a story of a sighting he
     had on board a submarine in 1966. The story (TIRU-1.UFO) was forward-
     ed  to  Vickie  Cooper for inclusion in a possible story in UFO Maga-
     zine.  It  was  also sent to Stan Friedman for verification. This was
     back in August.

     I  learned  from Vickie Cooper that Bill (no relation) had had a con-
     versation  with  her  in which the Majestic-12 documents had come up.
     When  she  mentioned  the  "proword" "MAJIC", he claimed to have seen
     that  word  on  several  documents  back  in his days with CINCPACFLT
     (Commander  in  Chief, Pacific Fleet). About a week later, I received
     the  first of many files from Cooper, in which he implied that he had
     firsthand contact with or knowledge of individuals connected with MJ-
     12.  (see  GUIDANCE.DOC).  He  further implied that anyone possessing
     this  knowledge  was  in  great danger. I forwarded this file to both
     Stanton  Friedman  and  Jamie Shandera, to see whether any of the in-
     formation in it checked out. I later found out that it did not.

     In  the  meantime,  Cooper took a more active role in the public mes-
     sage  base. He claimed publicly that he had lost his $75,000/year job
     as  a  marketing  director,  two  days  after having spoken with Stan
     Friedman.  He stated that he would not be providing any more info for
     this  reason.  In  the  meantime,  several  more documents written by
     Cooper  filtered  through the ParaNet system, by way of our Ft. Smith
     board.  They  were  uploaded anonymously, but were written by Cooper.
     They  each  contained  the same preamble, which claimed that the info
     was  for  myself  and  for Stanton Friedman only, and that we were in
     great  danger for possessing the info contained therein. (DANGER.DOC,
     MUGGER.DOC, PICNIC2.DOC).

     At  around  this time, a user named Jeff Felix began using the board,
     and  asked  via chat for a private meeting between him and myself. We
     set  up  a  meet at the Jerry's on Scottsdale Road in Tempe (the same
     one  at  which  the Phoenix Skeptics hold their monthly meetings.) At
     this  meeting,  Felix, who is all of about 24, told a bizarre tale of
     having  been  an  NSA  cryptology technician, of having been "fooling
     around"  on  the  NSA  computer, trying to come up with an encryption
     program,  and  had  "stumbled across" the Majestic file, the Aquarius
     file,  the whole ball of wax. "Its all true," he told us, "the under-
     ground  bases, the aliens, the crashed saucers, etc." He claimed that
     with  a modified modem, he could get back in to the files. Naturally,
     I  was extremely skeptical, and a few days later when I asked Felix a
     few  questions  on the phone, testing his knowledge of the most basic
     intelligence  terminology,  I  became  flat-out  incredulous  when he
     failed  the  test.  What was even more revealing was that Bill Cooper
     had  provided me with some of the questions I asked Felix, and I have
     a  captured chat session with Cooper in which he expressed his doubts
     of Felix's veracity.

     In  my  last  online  chat  with Felix, he mentioned something called
     Project  X-calibur  (his  spelling). He said he had discussed it with
     Cooper  on  the  phone  before he had called me. Cooper later told me
     that  no,  Felix had not mentioned it. He told me he had heard of it,
     but  that  it was VERY Top Secret, above his level. He said he didn't
     know anything more about it.

     Much  to  my  surprise,  Cooper  later called to tell me that Project
     Excalibur  is real, that his sources told him it was a project by MJ-
     12  to  extract  technology  from  the aliens. He told me that it was
     important  I  get  in  touch with Felix, that if "the kid knows about
     [Excalibur],  he's  for  real." Felix, in the meantime, would give me
     no  information  about Excalibur, except that a friend of his who had
     done  the  same  thing he had (broken into the NSA's Cray-3 computer,
     the  most advanced and secure supercomputer in the world), had "stum-
     bled across" the Excalibur file.

     My  thinking  on Cooper and Felix at this time began to center on the
     thought  that  the two of them were scamming me behind my back, and I
     had  visions  of  having  ParaNet  become a home for unwed paranoids.
     When  John  LEar  returned  from  his long absence, and began to join
     with  Cooper  in a series of mutual admiration sessions, I saw things
     getting out of control.

     I  knew  by now that Cooper was either engaging in fantasy role-play-
     ing,  or  something more sinister. The word "disinformation" has been
     bandied  about  quite  freely  during  this  entire  MJ-12 mess. Now,
     please  consider:  Cooper's  credentials  as a Naval NCO with a back-
     ground  in  intelligence  seem to check out. His information is self-
     contradicting  and  paranoid,  and  does NOT check out, at least with
     the  several  intelligence  sources  I  have contacted. After the UFO
     COVER-UP  broadcast,  Cooper  sent ANOTHER file by way of ParaNet RHO
     in  BOISE,  called  his  10-15-88 Position Paper. In it he completely
     contradicts  his  entire  previous  thesis, and claims that the MJ-12
     scenario  as painted by Moore's group (and implicitly, by himself) is
     a  hoax.  Further,  he  claims to be in full agreement with John Lear
     (which  agreement  seems  to  be  mutual,  based on Lear's support of
     Cooper).  Now  I  ask you, if agents of disinformation are at work to
     discredit  the  field  of  Ufology,  who  is the more likely suspect?
     Moore/Shandera/Friedman,  who  claimed  from  the  beginning  to have
     videotapes  of  bona  fide  government  agents, and produced them for
     live  TV,  or  Cooper/Lear, who seemingly plagiarized the Moore docu-
     ments,  gave  them  a slightly different spin, then turned around and
     contradicted  themselves  the  moment it became public knowledge, and
     can't  even  seem  to  agree  with each other, yet support each other
     publicly?  My  locking  out  of  Cooper was actually on the advice of
     Cooper  himself,  who  accused William Pitts and the New Project Blue
     Book  of  being  a military intelligence cover operation, and ParaNet
     of  being  an  unwitting  disinformation  pipeline. To avoid becoming
     such  a  pipeline, which I'm sure no one here wants, I simply got rid
     of the most likely suspect.

     As  to  Lear, I don't think any self-respecting Sysop would stand for
     being  accused  of borderline treason on his public board, especially
     from  a  man  who  proudly displays in his office enlarged telephoto-
     graphs  of  the installation at Groom Lake, the country's most secret
     tactical  aircraft  development  area,  obtained by himself after at-
     tempting  to  enter  the  area illegally. His unqualified support for
     Cooper,  which  seems  to  be  based  solely  on Cooper's unqualified
     support  for  him,  I  found  distasteful  and somehow disturbing, in
     light  of  the  fact that Cooper has contradicted Lear's information.
     And  consider:  John  Lear entered Ufology in early 1987, when it be-
     came  known  to  a few that Moore was going to release MJ-12. Lear is
     known to have been a CIA operative in the past. He wears his patriot-
     ism  on his office walls, in the form of autographed pictures of him-
     self  standing  with  G.  Gordon  Liddy.  Again, if disinformation is
     taking place, I ask you, who is the more likely source?

     And  is  it  working? Well, consider. What if Moore/Shandera/Friedman
     DO  have  the  real  goods?  If  so,  isn't  it  a shame that so many
     intelligent  people,  people  such as Don Ecker, watched UFO COVER-UP
     LIVE,  and  instead  of  asking if MSF were for real, began asking if
     Lear  and  Cooper  were  for  real? This, despite the obvious contra-
     dictions and obfuscations listed below:

     "The  documents you are looking for are for the most part labeled TOP
     SECRET MAJIC-RESTRICTED DATA"  -- Bill Cooper, 22 August

     "EVERY  DOCUMENT  YOU  SEE  WHICH USES...`MAJIC' IS A FRAUD!" -- Bill
     Cooper, 15 October

     "The  documents  produced  by Mr. Moore et al are photographic copies
     of  genuine  documents  which  were  procured at great risk." -- Bill
     Cooper, 22 August

     "I  CAN  PROVE  BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT TO ANYONE THAT MOST OF THE
     INFORMATION  RELEASED  BY  WILLIAM  MOORE,  ET  AL...ARE  OBVIOUS AND
     DELIBERATE FORGERIES." -- Bill Cooper, 15 October

     "Hmmm...let  me  think on that one for a while." -- Bill Cooper, when
     I  told  him  that  the  Aquarius Telex contained a compartmentalized
     routing  code at the top that indicated to anyone trained in military
     communications/intelligence  that  the document was either fraudulent
     or to be ignored for some reason. Phone conversation, 11 October

     "The code is ZNY." -- Bill Cooper, phone conversation, 12 October.

     "I  got  it, Jim, I just remembered after I hung up with you, its NOT
     ZNY,  that means something else, but its _________" (my deletion). --
     Bill Cooper, phone conversation, 12 October


     "There  is  a  code  at  the head of the AQUARIUS TELEX that tells me
     that  the information contained within it is not to be acted upon nor
     in  any way believed...________ on the telex net informs all stations
     that  the  message  CANNOT  BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY...The code is really a
     type  of  slang/graffiti  that was used by a lot of enlisted men, and
     sometimes  by  officers.  I  had  a  lot  of  fun  with  a  couple of
     Ufologists  on  that  one.  THEY STILL BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE TESTING
     ME."  -- Bill Cooper, 15 October
