SUBJECT: BACKGROUND OF MARS ET HYPOTHESIS                    FILE: UFO1741



Background information handy
to evaluating the martian
intelligence hypothesis'

Martian data

     () Viking analysis revealed a mars possessing all the
        elements of life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen

     () Viking analysis also confirmed an earlier epoch in martian
        history when life could have originated

     () Viking data and current evolutionary theory revealed
        that, though long enough to create martian microorganisms,
        that "benign epoch" would have been too short -- ^rby
        billions of years^r -- to have permitted its evolution
        into intelligence, certainly not human-looking
        intelligence


Therefore . . .
        
        If the "anomalies" detected in the viking images are
        artifacts, the "face" is a specific signal to us,
        -- and the artifacts are product of an intelligence
        that did not originate on mars


General physics

     () Thirty years of scientific discussion and observation
        has led to a general scientific expectation of a universe
        filled with life.

     () In those thirty years, the consensus has been that
        extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to contact
        neighboring civilizations would "phone home" --
        use interstellar radio transmissions

     () Recent reappraisals of terrestrial technological
        capabilities in the next century, however, indicate
        that sub-light travel between stars -- though extremely
        expensive and difficult by current engineering
        standards -- is not physically impossible

     () Thus, recent authors on "et"s in the scientific
        literature have rightly asked: "why not look for
        et-generated physical evidence^r on near-by satellites
        and planets?"


For these reasons . . .

        There is nothing "unscientific" in suggesting that the
        cydonia objects viking photographed -- including
        "the face" -- could be "extraterrestrially-generated
        artifacts," placed in an environment proven (by viking)
        suitable for colonization by an advanced civilization



Facts supporting the martian
'intelligence hypothesis'


"Intelligent life on earth first reveals itself through the geometrical 
regularity of its constructions."
        -- Carl sagan, cosmos



Qualitative observations

     () Discovery of bilaterally symmetric humanoid "face"
        in region called cydonia


     () Discovery of "pyramids" and other "architectural"
        objects nearby suggesting the presence of a "city"



Geometrical and mathematical analysis

     () Discovery of geometrical relationships linking all
        relevant objects at cydonia -- including "face" -- into
        one "complex": the "relationship model"


     () Discovery of fundamental mathematical constants --
        including "e" and "pi" -- expressed geometrically
        in one key object: a bilaterally symmetric, five-sided
        "pyramid"


     () Discovery of identical mathematics -- including
        "e" and "pi" -- in geometry linking entire "complex":
        elegent validation of "relationship model"


     () Discovery of direct mathematical connection between siting
        of "cydonia complex" on planet -- specific latitude -- and
        "e/pi" constants expressed geometrically in "complex":
        hardly explanable other than by intelligent design



Computer analysis

     () Sophisticated computer-graphics analysis and modeling of
        three-dimensional structure of "face," proves underlying
        form is not dismissable as "trick of light and shadow"


     () Computer-graphics reconstruction of resulting three-d
        "face" proves facial resemblance persists at all
        viewing and illumination angles


     () State-of-the-art fractal analysis of cydonia
        (computerized surface pattern-recognition), demonstrates
        that "face" and "city" possess unique "non-natural"
        surface texture patterns, compared to surrounding
        natural mountains



Conclusions of all analyses:
     
     Significant evidence, from variety of disciplines, points
     strongly to artificial origin . . .
