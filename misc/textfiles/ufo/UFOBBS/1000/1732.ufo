OK, I have a question for everyone: what would take for YOU to accept Cydonia
as artificial?

(Be as specific as you like, and please estimate *when* this is likely to be
accomplished, and by what means.)

Richard,
     In my book I propose a simple test.  The image of half a face is so
unusual that is must have only the slightest chance of occuring through natural
processes, such as wind erosion.  So, just take photos of the other side,
hidden in shadows.  If that looks like a natural formation, the whole structure
will lose its "artificiality".  If the unseen half looks like the complementary
half of a human face, well, what are the chances of that?  It would sure
convince me.

     NASA SHOULD have reprogrammed Viking to look while they still could. But
they didn't, so we must await Mars Observer.  --- Tom

Tom (and all those who gave basically the same response),

I'm a bit mystified.  We HAVE photos -- marvelous computerized, detailed
enhancements now (thanks to Carlotto), of both the original low sun-angle
frame, 35A72 (the version that's most well-known, with the right side of the
"face" indeed in shadow), AND, high sun-angle frames 70A11 and 70A13, with the
shadowed side revealed.  It's these frames (with the sun 20 degreees higher)
that amply confirm that the exquisite bisymmetry, proportionality, and image
structure we see hints of in 35A72 is continued in the so-called "hidden side."
The point is: with the Viking data we (NOT NASA!) have exhaustively analyzed
and published now (and will make available to anyone who asks), there IS NO
hidden side!  This feature's remarkable symmetry (which is about 95% -- erosion
could well account for the "missing" 5%) extends even to the detailed *shape*
of the "eyebrow ridges" at the structure's "top," left and right.  In a Viking
low-resolution "morning frame" (753A33 -- with sunlight coming from the right)
this "eyebrow" morphology can be matched perfectly to "degraded resolution
images" we specifically prepared (at SRI, in 1983) of these identical features
on 35A72 -- with sunlight coming from the left, as well as with Carlotto's 3-D
views, "lit" at the appropriate angle.  And they're a perfect match.

So, what's all this about "needing to see the whole structure."  We ARE seeing
the whole structure . . . (see examples on our stationery and Newsletter!), and
STILL no one is willing to "commit" on the basis of the face *alone*.  Com'on,
guys, what's the REAL reason?  -- Dick

Dick:

Now I'm the one that's mystified.

I'm looking at "Unusual Martian Surface Features," 4th ed., pg. 41. I see three
different enlargements of 70A13 on the right side. The first two look like raw
data, the third one looks like some kind of computer enhancement - at least, I
can't see how they got the "shadow side" information. Looking at the other two,
it just isn't there.

If that bottom blow-up is computer-enhanced, I would need to see a treatise on
the process used (S.P.I.T.?), and a refereed review of the appropriateness of
using such a process.

If that blow-up is "au naturel", its very impressive, but still too ambiguous
for me. I see flaws in the bisymmetry right off the bat - the right eye seems
lower and closer to the bridge of the "nose" than the left.

I hope your suggestion of an ulterior motive in my hesitance was in jest. If
not, your petulance is most unbecoming a man of science. You DID ask what would
CONVINCE us it was artificial. I'm very IMPRESSED, but unCONVINCED.

Jim,

Yes, my comment on "what's REALLY going on?" was in jest -- tinged, I guess,
with a bit of frustration.

Morphologically, as the geomorphologist in Torun noted, the D&M is far more
intriguing to us at this point than "the face" -- as it is a figure NOT
influenced by the psychological pitfalls of "humanoid projection" (as "faces"
inevitably are, and ALWAYS will be, viewed by "sceptics").  It is deomonstrably
there, with its own unique symmetry, specific alignments with the other "unique
objects," AND its own resitting precisely astride
the *one latitude* which ties all that interconnected geometry into its very
location on the planet.  Very hard to explain, Jim, *very* hard . . . other
than by deliberate intention.

Which bring me to your question: what would it take to convince me that this is
all a natural "fluke" (I'm paraphrasing).  Answer: for someone else (actually,
a number of "someone elses") to REPEAT all our geodetic and geometric
measurements, between all the objects at Cydonia -- and to have EVERY ONE of
these independent groups discover we were wrong in all the measurements.
Science IS measurement, observation, analysis of data , etc., . . . and, *
repeatablity*.  What this investigation needs now is what any science at this
point deserves: simple independent replication.

My frustration is that no one seems willing publically to test our
measurements.
  They say, instead, "Oh, they'll prove nothing!", or, "Let's wait for better
pictures."  When, in fact, by any standard of any science that I've ever known,
those measurements should now be the basis for any future *scientific*
judgements on Cydonia.  If they're wrong, then the whole thing is highly
suspect.  And I would be the first to admit it!  But if they're right . . .
It's like NASA not agreeing simply to "take the damn pictures in 1993": as long
as the "day of reckoning" can be put off . . . we don't have to make "the
decision."  And the REAL meaning of Cydonia remains in limbo.  Frustrating

In answer to your question re "raw images" and "enhancements" of 70A13:

Yes, on page 41 of "Unusual Martian Surface Features," 4th ed., the three
righthand images ARE THE SAME.  The top one is the full-frame of 70A13; the
righthand one is an enlargement of the "face" area in the same frame; and the
middle (bottom) image isht out," "something stretched," something
amplified," "something made visible above the noise," etc.  Here it does NOT
mean "something added!"

Dipietro and Molenaar's SPIT algorithm was not, strictly speaking, an
"enhancement technique" at all.  It was an "anti-aliasing (sp?) technique"; it
merely "smoothed the edges" between pixels (picture elements -- the "dots")
making up the computer image.  True "enhancement" removes noise, stretches
contrast, corrects geometric distortions, etc.  It ultimately redistributes
what data is available, so the human eye can SEE that data easier (like "false
color" )!  What Carlotto has done, in contrast (another pun . . .) to D&M, is
truly apply a range of these state-of-the-art enhancement techniques to these
images - - all carefully described in the Applied Optics piece.  I KNOW that
when you see the new images from the Mars Mission ("new" only in the sense of
the techniques applied to these, now, 13-year old data tapes), you'll be amazed
at what you see.  And realize why Erol and I think continuing arguments about
the "symmetry" of our friend here slightly miss the point. -- Dick

Dick,

Science is more than numbers and measurements. You have not left any room for
interpretation, nor evaluation of your conclusions. Imagine if I were to claim
that the mere existence of some 10,000 unexplained UFO reports over 40 yare subject to review, not my interpretation.

Bottom line: What percentage of possibility do you think there is that your
measurements are all correct, yet the "monuments" are still naturally formed?

I'll say it again, I'm impressed enough with your work to be willing to DEMAND
further research and more openness on the matter from NASA, but only becld
depend on the results of that series of independent replications, as to my next
decisions re "naturalness").

Over the years I've spent on this (six very intensive ones, as of now), as long
as we were dealing with "soft" data ("faces," approximate geometric
"alignments," etc.) I carefully maintained the appropriate "open mind" re the
ultimate interpretation of Cydonia -- believing that we would indeed need to
wait for high-res Mars Observer images, before we clarified the situation.

Then Torun, a geomorphologist, cartographer and geographer with Defense
Mapping, began in late 1988 *independently* testing my "relationship model,
established in "Monuments" as a "what would constitute 'ultimate proof' for or
against the Intelligence Hypothesis" (because he thought my assertion of
bilateral symmetry in the D&M "absurd" -- his word!).  To his amazement, nay
shock -- he found my assertion was correct: the D&M is bilaterally symmetric,
and is "aimed" directly at the "face."  Further, he extended those initial
observations, and discovered that the object possessed extraordinary internal
symmetry, mathematical elegance (the front is exactly a third of a circle), and
REDUNDANT geometric "constants" difficult to rationalize in any manner other
than potentially deliberate. Morphologically, after a broad survey of a lot of
other Viking images and geological regimes, and an assessment of realistic
processes and "weathering agents" proposed by the Viking geologists for other
surface features, he concluded that both mathematically and geomorphologically,

(Cont'd from previous message)

What really got me, however, was not "just" the mathematical elegence Torun
found within the D&M.  It was the fact that he discovered, completely
independently, a *second* example of a curious "coincidence" I included in
"Monuments" as a "throw away" on the very back of the book: that the tangent of
the (then) approximate lshington, from a total stranger currently working with Defense Mapping,
who has found -- not only additional apparent constants "encoded" in the D&M --
but good ol' "e/pi" itself!

Redundancy.  A possible (note I still say "possible") signal (see #194254 et
al) !

No, Jim, I could maintain a fascade, a political "front" on this, and I guess
make a lot of people feel easier.  Only, I have leveled with everyone all the
way along.  When it was uncertain, I said so.  Now, we have something VERY
specific that can easily be tested: *dozen*s of repeats, across the entire
"complex," of these two numbers and other specifically related constants
-together, alone, inverted, and even multiplied.  These multiple redundancies
BEG TO BE INVESTIGATED.  If they hold up, this "signal" is telling us NOW --
not in three years -- that Cydonia is real.  And that should *insure* that we
get those vital images! -- Dick

Dick,
     I object to your criteria in answer to the question about what would
convince you Cydonia was natural.  You have surely heard of numerology (the
attachment of special significance to certain numbers).  And you must know the
difference between *a priori* and *ad hoc*.

     Consider a randomly-generated set of millions of dots on a large, flat
surface.  If you specify IN ADVANCE (a priori) some special pattern, such as 24
dots forming a nearly perfect square with 6 dots per side, the chances are very
slight that it will occur by chance in a random pattern.  So if you find chance.

     So if you are searching for a 24-dot square, and find instead two sets of
four triangles, each making a perfect square, that is NOT significant, because
some improbable things MUST happen purely by chance.  Finding a rationale for
this pattern after you have found it is *ad hoc* (after the fact), and
convinces only those who have not dealt with large random sets before.

     I have asked for any *a priori* significance to the measurements you cite,
and received unconvincing answers.  If is not reasonable for us to accept your
measurements, replicated or not, as proof of anything unless they have *a
priori* significance.  This is the main stumbling block between us over your
whole "measurements" approach to proving artificiality.  It is also why I said
symmetry in the face WOULD be convincing, because it is *a priori* significant.

objects?  What about lying on the arc of a circle, lying at a perfect right
angle, or at an angle of 40.97 degrees, etc, etc.  Do you see the problem?

     Since you mention objects here on Earth, I agree there is a lot to be
intrigued by among the pyramids and other artifacts.  But if there is any
significance at all to the latitude (40.97 degrees) of the D&M pyramid on Mars,
and if there is any Earth connection, then WHY isn't there something
significant at that latitude on Earth???  That would be truly "a priori",
provided you don't open up the field of "something significant" to include more
than major ancient structures of possible ET origin.  --- Tom

Tom,

*a priori* and *ad hoc* are fine when you're dealing with a mathematical
puzzle.  What we have here, however, is something that "looks" very suspicious.
There is simply NO PRECEDENT for calculating odds for the possibility that
these may be or may not be ET artifacts. How many advanced civilizations have
arisen in the galaxy during the past 4 billion years?  How many are "humanoid?"
How many engage in monument building?  What do they consider important; 
geometry, art, faces, etc? Until we have answers to those questions, it will
simply be impossible to apply any "known formulander thousands of atmospheres of
pressure in ocean trenches; "advanced life forms" which breathe Hydrogen
Sulfide.  Almost everything we "knew" about the planets and their moons has
been proven wrong.  I vividly remember a statement made by a planetary
scientist regarding the riverbeds on Mars , "We considered every conceivable
liquid, including champagne, before finally deciding that the only possible
answer was vast amounts of liquid water." The "impossible" has already happened
too many times in the recent past to justify throwing this out just because it
in too incredible to be real.

I think there is a temptation to view the two sides in this issue as:  THOSE
WHO ARE CONVINCED (ARTIFICIAL) * VS * THOSE WHO ARE CONVINCED (NATURAL.)  I see
it in another context: THOSE WHO WANT TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH * VS * THOSE WHO
ARE CONVINCED...and finding out the truth demands further investigation by Mars
Observer.

wouldn't we be disappointed if such a table from ET's with interplanetary
capability stopped at 106 or sooner (i.e. told us nothing we didn't already
know).  I would then immediately suspect that the gold disk was a fraud. But if
it does go to higher elements, that's something we can use and verify.

perhaps intended for us and perhaps not.  We already know, from thinking about
our own attempts at communication, how difficult it is to imagine what would be

patterns, but should study them.

do not see a way that a few examples of simple, "special" patterns, whatever
they are, can argue for the artificiality of Cydonia.  Given that
artificiality, then everything about the site becomes interesting.  But just

Tom, Your comment "an unusual set of natural features" makes MASA's refusal to
"commit itself" even more suspicious.  This also brings to memory a discussion
I had with one of the planetary Geologists at the USGS. He stated "this is
nothing more than an example of bizarre geology." Now, if I had been really
quick on my toes, I would have commented, "well, you're a geologist aren't you?
Why are you opposed to photographing something that you, yourself, describe as
'bizarre?"

If NASA really has a problem lending "credibility" to Hoagland and the other
researchers, why don't they just agree to takes more pictures because it

Tom,

I believe that part of the problem we are having, on this very crucial aspect
of our work, lies in semantics: precisely how does one define "a priori" and
"ad hoc."  Let me give an example from the "standard" SETI community, then pick
up ( if the 37 lines permit!) on your own example -- the "million random
points" (any cousin to George Bush's "thousand points" . . .?).

SETI has been looking for The Signal for precisely thirty years, now.  A LOT of
people, over those years, have debated exactly wavailable specturm will look like true "white noise," the *real* signal will
look exactly like the Galactic background! -- until a proper "decoding
algorithm" is applied.  [Since we can't be expected to know what that decoding
algorithm is, say these guys, the "real" signals will be "from aliens TO
aliens" (who already have the code), which we'll merely intercept by accident. 
And so on.]  If you flew through the beam of Voyager 2's telemetry and dage.)

I've always been a bit suspicious of these arguments.  Trying to "crawl inside
the psychology of aliens" to me has always seemed both hopeless . . . and
somewhat chauvanistic.  The true "signal," I have come to suspect (after you
finally find it -- the hard part!), must contain WITHIN ITSELF ITS OWN "A
PRIORI" DEFINITION THAT IT IS A SIGNAL.  That's the only way it COULD work --
in a Universe of almost infinite possibilities and combinations, where each
"unique" reasoning about "a priori" must be based on the individual receiver's
experience, awareness, and level of intelligence (or, just as bad, the
"sender's" "guesstimates" of same).

What I'm saying is that, to be totally  "universal," the "senders" could make
NO ASSUMPTIONS regarding "a priori."  The "signal" would have to do its own
defining.  And the only way I could see that it could do that, would be if it
was SELF-REFERENTIAL.  Like "intelligence" itself.

So, how would this work in practice?  You're at your radio telescope,
attentively scanning the skies, looking for an intelligent signal that (so our
physics say) is going to be far down "in the noise" (simple distance andan "intelligent signal,"
against all that other "hash?"  Must it give you "pi" before you accept it?  A
prime number?  A raster scan of Vanna White?

No.  All it has to do is REPEAT something -- anything!  "Noise" IS random.  It
will not repeat (at least, not within a highly limited "search space" and
time).
  But a true signal will instantly be recognizable BY ITS SIMPLE REPETITION of
"the signal" -- regardless of WHAT that signal "thinks" it's important to
communicate.  It's the *redundancy* which immediately lifts it "out of the
noise of randomness." (And if you're thinking of the "pulsar problem," that's
NOT the kind of simple "time repetition" I'm describing. The precise PATTERN
must replicate. -- More)

There is a real difference between "a priori" and "arbitrary."  If we have "a
priori" defined our "sige combinations of
those SAME FEW DOTS.  To insist at that point that "only the square could be
significant" would be highly arbitrary.  The trianges, by their redundancy,
become the "carrier" for "the signal"; the redundant mathematics the
"modulation" of that carrier -- the actual information.

What we have found, Tom, is the equivalent of the "highly-redundant triaconstants amid these highly limited combinations (to repeated three sig. figure
accuracy), that has us convinced we're "on to something."

I would be the first to "throw away" our possible "first-cut" at a MEANING
(what "they" might have intended by this pattern).  That there is now an
intelligent PATTERN there -- "a message," which has defined itself by its
*extreme* redundancy -- I will defend quite strenuously.  And I insist that
others actually examine what we have discovered and then either replicate or
refute the *measurements*, BEFORE they criticize our logic and results -- "a
priori." -- Dick

Dick,
     If your other compelling measurements and relationships are like TAN
(latitude) = e/pi, I'll pass when it comes to replication of your calculations,
because "a priori" I don't attach any significance to that sort of coincidence.

     But perhaps we are reaching the point where I need to know more detail
before I can fairly criticize or support your finding that you already have
enough evidence to conclude that the Cydonia objects are artificial, other than
through the artificial appearance.

     I have been through the exercise of finding an amazing conclusion after
lengthy calculations (the breakup of the asteroidal planet); and then having
the frustration that others who don't repeat the calculations, but only hear my
description about how compelling they are, can never appreciate first hand to
what extent they are "air tight" vs. having "loopholes" or subject to
interpretation or experimenter bias.  So I can emphathize with your
frustration.

     So, what is the single most important single thing you would like someone
to replicate, and what raw materials would that someone have to possess to
begin?  If you make the task better defined and a little less formidable, you
may get some volunteers (maybe even me).  --- Tom

 120 deg., and for these and other angles that appear in more than
 one place.  This investigation would not be analogous to
he aforementioned sightline intersection point.
        - This bisected 120 deg. angle matches the geometry of
 the "front" of the D&M.
        - The City Square to Cliff(lower) to Tholus angle is 85.3
 deg., matching the sides of the D&M.
        - The Cliff(lower) to Tholus to D&M angle is 90 deg.

        These simple alignments, *combined with* the
 geomorphology of each object, should support the contention that
 nature may not have been wholly responsible for their existence.

Tom,

Erol and I debated a bit re how extensive to make our response to your request.
We decided to begin with the "basics" that Erol has now outlined in his note:
low): the main problem we've had all along is the
quality of the data itself.  Geometric measurements must be made on
orthographic rectifications of the original images.  But JPL only produced
*one* set of such "rectified images" (at least, that I've ever seen), and . . .
the image quality is lousy!; features are grossly over-exposed, or are
essentially black.  So, even recognition of "control points" for accurate
measurement is difficult.  For this reason, we've made very large blow-ups, in
several different scales, to assist in reducing simple identification
confusion.  And we've constantly crosscompared features between the NASA
"orthos" and our own "Carlotto *rectilinear* enhancements" -- which really pull
all the original imaging data from these tapes, and show features in *exquisite
detail*, but are geometrically useless. You might ask "Why haven't you produced
our own computerized orthographic mosaics?"  The answer is: it's extremely
difficult to do that *outside* of NASA.
  The geometric corrections must be derived from the latest navigation data
from the Viking spacecraft, which -- when we tried to get it -- we were
informed "that tape has been erased, as we (NASA) had no further need for it." 
This was in 1986.  So, we've had to live with "doing it by hand."  Some way to
do science, eh?  BTW: when Mert Davies (at RAND) offered to check our
measurements, he asked US for a set of decent rectilinear prints "because my
JPL copies are so bad."  Interesting buraucratic system we've established here,

Eric,

I was referring to the *Tan* of 40.87 = e/pi = 0.865, as being the significant
trig function of that "one latitude."  While it is perfectly true that other
trig functions, representing this same ratio (0.865), apply equally to some of
the other latitudes you mention (which opens up the interesting thought: what's
at THOSE latitudes on Mars . . . which we simply haven't had the resources to
examine!), Erol and I maintain that there is a "unique significance" to the Tan
of 40.87.  For one thing, it alone seems to derive the "19.5 degree latitude
predictions" (details in the paper) -- which demonstrably contain something
"going on" at that latitude (in fact, the "biggest somethings" -- the Hawaiian
Caldera, Olympus Mons, the Great Red Spot, and now the Great Dark Spot, 
Remember too that, every scientific inquiry has started out as a simple
catalogue of PATTERNS -- long before the physical reasons for those patterns
became "obvious."  It becomes a "science" when, from the original pattern and a
good theory (or mathematical model) you can PREDICT the next part of the
pattern.  We did that successfully with Neptune.  Which, in any "normal"
inquiry should make makentially significant, because that angle is to be found on the D&M pyramid
when viewed vertically (as it would be from space). The angle is formed by the
west ground-level edge and the edge that points from the apex towards the city
square.
      While I was impressed by the repeated expression of e/pi in many
locations, I was especially intrigued by its expression by three totally
different methods: the ratio between angles, the trig. functions of angles, and
the aforementioned radian measure.  What makes these three methods significant
(beyond redundancy) is the fact that they are not dependent upon the system of
mathematics used by the observer.  Just as our hypothetical architects could
not assume what method of analysis would first be applied, they also could not
possibly assume that an observer of Cydonia would count in the decimal system
(base 10) or use a 360 degree system for denoting angles.  The methods by which
I believe these numbers are expressed are independent of such assumptions.

      Your list of "significant latitudes" would reduce the odds that thappearance of possible architectures on one of them is deliberate, but this
requires the additional assumption that these latitudes are equally
significant.  The latitude of  40.868 deg. affords a good oppurtunity tots through the
aforementioned corner facing the city square AND the upslope terminus of the
"flat thing" on the front (towards the face).  This representation of both the
e/pi and (sqrt 3)/2 latitude requires not only that the D&M have a certain
latitude, but also a certain shape, size, and orientation.  Why not reprarguments as to
why that particular latitude was better than any of the others.

Science involves proving that the relationships you've found exist apart from
your rationalizion of them; you or others must make predictions based on your
theories, and see if they pan out.

The "physics guy" gave up after one day?  Haven't _you_ put a lot more time and
thought into it than that?  Also, your motivation is much better than his
was--you believed that there was a real message, while he was sure there
wasn't.
  Besides, what was it that "didn't work" for him?  If he picked another print
and tried to find the same numbers you came up with, he had the technique
backwards.  Aren't most of these relationships found by thinking about what
things might be suggested by the numbers?  There's a world full of things to
draw on, and the human mind is rabid about finding patterns.

I think you'd see the point if you'd ever read one of the "pyramidology" books.

the markings and changes in the passageways were quite real, but his reasoning

I believe that there is only one a priori fundamental indication of
consciousness - self-reference.  Meaningful redundancy coupled with indications
of self-knowledge or self-awareness in the physical record, regardless of the
class or type of data, is a unique quality of coference (within the Cydonia complex) of the D&M
pyramid to the face and to and among the other odd and prominent features at
Cydonia, the repetition of the same angles between different features, the
internal symmetry of the D&M pyramid as shown by sight-lines to the other
forms, the exact E-W alicy and self-reference would still be sufficient.

I agree that this is not absolute proof. Coincidence is possible and new data
must be obtained by a return visit with either much higher resolution imaging,
a remote rover, pickup and return of samples, or, of course, a humanned visit.
However, it is not likely, in my opinion, that the currently available hard
data - the angular alignments - will change. We already know these alignments
to 3 and 4 or more significant figures and I can't see what adding more
significant figures could add.

In spite of the enhancement techniques, I am not convinced that the face is
fully symmetrical. But I don't see how that matters. Even if there is only half
a face; even if the whole face is nothing but "a trick of light and shadow,"
that will not change the redundant, symmetrical, and self-referential
alignments. For me, the great mystery would be IF the Cydonia complex were
ultimately found to be natural, because that would require an explanation of
how - short of redundant coincidences - Mars could "know" where its prominent
(by Mars' standards ???) features are.

I do find the fractal analysis intriguing, but I don't have enough experience
with this tool to have developed a sense of perspective in its use.

I meant, if it turns out that the face is natural, but that the complex is not,
after we have examined new data, then that would be the greater mystery. While
it is true that the presence of what looks like a face started this
investigation, and while it is very unlikely, given the context of the
alignments of the other forms, that the face is natural, I still find the
alignments themselves - from the data we have - a much more compelling
indication of conscious intent than the face itself.

I am not attempting to dismiss the face.  It is just that given the low
resolution of the face, I find the high resolution of the alignments, by
comparison, more likely not to change with new data.

For example, it appears to me that the landforms at Cydonia were artificially
modified, but were initially chosen from the natural landforms available.  The
forms are very large and would have been very expensive to make if they were
all entirely artificial.  Even the face may/might have been adapted from a
conveniently placed and formed natural feature which might not have been
sufficiently symmetrical to start with for it to have been shaped into a
completely symmetrical face.  It is not even obvious to me that the face ought
to be symmetrical.  Real faces are not entirely symmetrical and artistic
lly carries information, not the symmetrical and redundant
carrier itself.  I believe that the presence of static symmetry may not be as
strong an indication of consciousness as slight asymmetry.  Moslem geometric
patterns always include a defect or an asymmetrical component because, among
other reasons, perfect order is considered to be the province of God and not
appropriate for man's view of reality which is always "defective".  The face
may be more than a weathered rock and still not be symmetrical. (more)

A closer look at Cydonia will improve the precision of our view of the face
significantly, but it is not likely to improve our knowledge of the alignments
between the forms to any significant degree.

I am prepared to find that the face is not entirely symmetrical even after we
find that the Cydonia complex is actually artificial.  As for absolute proof:
It would be beyond doubt an artificial complex if we were to find a map, chart,
or illustration of the complex or the face inscribed/written/drawn on the face
or on another object at Cydonia.  That would be the ultimate proof of conscious
design based on my a priori requirement of self-reference - even if the face
were completely asymmetrill NOT "go away."  While it is true that the
existing imagery reveals it is not "perfectly" symmetric (neither, in fact, is
any "face"; just look in the mirror!), the small differences we see (and they
are small) are easily explainable in terms of selective erosion.  The
prevailing winds at Cydonia -- as charted by the published global
meteorological models developed from the Viking surface observations,
uncomplicated by any "oceans" -reveal a long (millenia-long) pattern of
seasonal-dependence of compassdirection.  In other words, the right side (as
you look at it) should b

Additional factors are: the "photometric function" of the surface.  Light in
both existing high-res images is falling across the curved "cheek" on the right
at a significant angle, on a surface which strongly absorbs at low incident
lighting angles (because it is composed of myriad little dust particles, each
of casting a shadow on the next particle, at low angles).  This can explain the
rest of the *apparent* differences between the right and left side.

But, most important to me, is the simple fact that the "Face" is an INTEGRAL
part of the geometry and specific relationships we've found on the Cydonia
landscape.  One line -- the line that precisely bisects the 120 degree front
angle of the D&M Pyramid -- crosses the "face" at three critical points: the
lower left "corner," the "teardrop" (just below the left "eye"), and at the
upper "forehead" where the "face" literally ends.  These *three* points (on
that ONE line) in turn provide specific, redundant, angular relationships with
three other objects. No, Marty, the "face" will not disappear -- leaving just
the mathematical relationships (like the Cheshire Cat <grin>).  The *two* are
inextricably linked. -- Dick

Tom, I am sure that Richard will also reply to your message, but I thought an
opinion from someone who has the enhanced enlargements may also be in order. 
There are only two ** known ** photographs of the face. One was taken at low
sun angle (10 degrees) and the other was taken at high sun angle (30 degrees). 
In both photographs the right side is in shadow.  Even in the low sun angle
photo, it is possible to see what appears to be a "right edge" of the face. 
The high angle "stretch-contrast" Carlotto enhancement (which also distorts the
image) clearly shows **some symmetry** with the left side.  It does not show
the visual detail of the left side, this (right) side not being "filled-in"
with data.  Still, it ** tends ** to confirm rather than to ** disprove ** the
"artificial hypothesis," at least in my mind.

Obviously what we need are more AND BETTER photographs!!! Marty
 frames,
including made-to-order enlargements from those frames, are indeed available
from the Mars Mission (see message to Darrell Green re "Mars Mission Order
Form," # 194206).  As to source information on the initial imaging parameters (
frame number, spacecraft distance from Mars, lighting azimuth, lighting angle
to zenith, etc.), all these data are on the "data blocks" that accompany each
e IS a "second frame" with lighting at almost 30
degrees to the surface, which TOTALLY reveals the so-called "shadowed side." 
And under Carlotto's algorithms, it's a beaut!

I am aware of (and possess) at least one lower resolution, "morning shot" of
the "face" (frame 753A33).  As it was taken about five times higher than the
two previous frames, its resolution is about 5 times lower.  But, as I noted
earlier, it's facinating for the detail it reveals regarding the left "eyebrow"
region of the "face" at opposite lighting -- particularly when compared to both
a "deliberately-degraded 35A72," and to Carlotto's 3-D computerized "face"
model, the latter "lit" from the same "morning" angle.  All three images show
IDENTICAL DETAIL in this "eyebrow" region -- which is pretty impressive,

Richard, This may sound like a simple answer but I think Mars Observer really
will decide "once and for all."  We have, for example, a photograph of only one
side of the face.  The "face" IS the centerpiece of Cydonia.  If the "hidden
side" (even at Viking level resolution) shows nothing, I think this whole issue
will be settled.  No copouts like "The Martians only built half a face."  If,
on the other hand, the hidden side shows the same symmetry and detail as the
sunlit side, "just let someone suggest that we don't investigate or take higher
resolution photographs!!!!!!"

This brings up another point:  As you stated in your book, NASA "secretly" took
another photo of the face 35 days after the first photo.  It will probably
never be known whether this was the result of "normal mapping" or if there was
a conscious decision to do so. If they actually "made the decision," then it
would be safe to assume that they also took a "third" photograph of the hidden
side. If "that side" showed NOTHING, they could have used it to "disprove" all
of this "nonsense" (their choice of words, not mine.)

Note: beginning of this paragraph: I didn't mean they secretly took the second
photo, only that they never mentioned to the preDt: 03-Sep-89

Dick,
  The Cydonia observations/measurements/predictions are extremely interesting
and clearly warrant further examination by Observer, etc. My attention,
however, keeps being drown back to another region on Mars referred to as
Utopia, an area which is far away from Cydonia but in a similar latitude.
DiPietro, Molenaar and Brandenburg, in their book "Unusual Mars Surface
Features" (4th edition) point out two "faces" in the region.  One of the faces
looks remarkably similar to the Cydonia face, with its "characteristic" hair
(helmet?).  It is shown with comparisons to the Cydonia face on page 102 (Fig.
63) of their book.  I would think it would be possible to do some kind of
computerized comparisons between the two faces.  If indeed similarities proved
to be significantly "beyond chance", that would be supporting evidence for
artificallity.
   There are other intriguing features in Utopia, which you point out in your
book "Monuments" (Fig 22) --a "Runway" complex, etc. One particular feature
that caught my eye but was not specifically referred to is something that looks
like a complete "humanoid body".  This is just inside the right edge of Fig. 22
in your book.  The "head" is about one third the distance from the top of the
figure and has the "characteristic" appearance of the Cydonia face (most
distinguishable feature is the "hair". ). A "right arm" is stretched outportions resemble that of a
human.  When I pointed this out to my wife, she immediately saw still another
"face" within the torso. I'm curious if you or anyone else has noticed te additional significant information gathered there,
especially if certain mathematical relationships (similar to Cydonia?) could be
found. In any case, shouldn't there be some encouragement for Observer to look
city.  Although I haven't even spoken to any
"geology experts" about this, I feel they would explain this by some kind of
local faulting.

I think what had made Cydonia the center of attention is that here we have five
or six "bizarre looking" objects...all of which are very "DIFFERENT" from each
other.  That makes them much harder to explain through weathering or geology
than the other "interesting" areas.

PS Yes, I do see a "face."  It "looks" interesting, but I don't think it has
anywhere near the symmetry or "relief" that the face in Cydonia has.

Ok. Some questions which have probably already been answered, but I'm {
forgetful.

1) Who is the publisher of "Monuments"?

2) How can I obtain higher resolution photos (as opposed to halftones or
whatever you see in magazines and, I suppose, the book) of the region in
question?

Mike,

In answer to your questions: 1) "Monuments" is published by North Atlantic
Books, Berkeley, CA.  Its' available in Waldonbooks (even accessible here on
CIS, I believe), B. Dalton, Crown, and a lot of major independents, anywhere in
t that way, it's
signed, and the on-going research gets a percentage of the cover price).

2) The highest resolution photos are also available (as actual hard-copy 11 X
14 prints of 35A72, 70A11, and 70A13), with individual 11 X 14 enlargements of
the key features (high atical
"overlays."

Does that help?  --  Dick

P.S.  There's also, just out (Sept 1), an "updated audio 'docu-drama' of the
book" (NOT just someone reading "Monuments!") -- with illustrations, mosaics
and a map included in the "bookpac" containing the cassette.  Also called "The
Monuments of Mars," and available like the book.

Mike,

To order the 11 X 14 enhanced full-frame images, and detailed enlargements of
the Cydonia objects (or any of the other items discussed in previous messages
-like "Monuments," the new audio-version of same, the Mars Mission Newsletter,
the NASA-Goddard video, etc.), simply send a U.S Mail note requesting a list of
what's available to: The Mars Mission, P.O. Box 981, Wytheville, VA 24382.
You'll get a free issue of the "Mars Mission News" and an enclosed order form
by return mail, detailing everything we have -- with ilustrations.  If you have
a PC (and you must, or you wouldn't be reading this <grin>!), simply call the
Mars Mission BBS (703) 228-7822, and enter "Files."  Follow the "prompts" from
there to get to "RESOURCES" -- the file-name under which a detailed printout of

perimposes the "torso" of
the "whole-body figure", which has a much more symetrical Cydonia-like face.
That face is about a quarter the size of the other face and is slightly above
the latter. Let me know if you can see it.

      Speaking of "faces", I think that there has been too much attention over
the years given to the search for representations of the human form on Mars. 
The face in Cydonia is the only one that I feel has a chance of being real; the
others don't even come close. But while the face in Cydonia appears real, it is
NOT the most anomalous landform present from the viewpoint of geomorphology.
There are objects in Cydonia whose location, shape, and orientation more
strongly suggest intelligent design.  These objects include the "cliff" - a
straight ~2km long ridge located ON the ejecta apron of ancient pedestal
crater, the "Tholus" - a hemispherical structure with a flat ledge around its
periphery, the straight walled "city", and most anomalous of them all, the D&M
pyramid - with its five sides and bilateral symmetry oriented toward the face. 
I began my own investigations into the possibility of ruins on Mars not after
seeing the face, but as a result of seeing the D&M pyramid, a structure that
geologically should not exist on Mars (or any of the inner planets).

Bert. Now that you mention it I see both the larger face as well as the smaller
one (with the body.)  It seems as though the "body" is pointing to something to
the left of the picture.  The "legs" seem slightly misaligned though.  As for
the larger face, it.... well....sorta looks like.... <gulp!>...  Richard Nixon.

Ted,
  You're right the larger face does look sort of like Nixon. I thought it
looked familiar but I couldn't place it <grin>. Actually, the image looks
almost TOO real to be real (Ha!), but what's underneath it (the full figure) is
quite intiguing. Do you think the small face (the one above "Nixon") looks like
the Cydonia face? It would be interesting to see a "blowup" of it.

Guess I was shooting from the hip. How about a similarity of objects across

Dear Richard: I have seen the Carlotto photos and frankly they impress me as
giving the clearest indication as of now that the face is most likely an
artificial construct which in turn would lead to probable artificial
construction of the pyramids and other objects of Cydonia.  The only other
feature is the negative made of one of the Viking photos shown on p. 43 in "The
Face on Mars" by Dr. Pozos.  However I would prefer to have IMAX photos which
show the Face and the surrounding area in incredible detail enough to make the
skeptics and myself scream, "OH, MY GOD!"  But I must admit that Carlotto's
work has certainly lessened my modest skepticism eeven more.
