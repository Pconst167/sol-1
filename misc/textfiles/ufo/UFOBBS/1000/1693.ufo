		     OPEN LETTER TO JERRY CLARK




 Dear Jerry Clark:

 I have received from several UNICAT associates a copy of your opus
 magnum  THE SMITH PRINCIPLE.  To paraphrase and immortal line:  "The
 'gentleman' doth protest too much, methinks."  Here is why.

	(1) Whoa!  I must have touched a raw nerve to rate such a
 lengthy and passionate reply!  Or perhaps, as Michel (sic) Corbin
 and others have put it, I might be on target.  Remember, you are not
 supposed to be emotional; that is my province, according to you.  At
 any rate, words can't describe the satisfaction that you have given
 me with your piece, for which I thank you.  I hope you will find a
 place to publish it (other than the IUR).

	(2)  While I regret that you did not have the integrity
 (others would have say manhood) to send me directly a copy of your
 paper, I must admit that I was also pleased by your pusillanimity.

	(3) You can't really expect that I will release confidential
 correspondence from Dr. Hynek just to make a point, do you?  But
 maybe you do.

	(4) Sorry for calling you a "weekend ufologist".  Mea culpa!
 I didn't know your fortunes had improved enough to obviate the need
 for honest renumerated work, and I will refer to you from now on as
 the "pseudo-ufologist", unless you tell me otherwise.  What about
 that?

	(5) Your statements about Fuller et al, are foolhardy, as
 documented evidence exists that the anti-UNICAT article was
 solicited more than a year ago by you.  For which I thank you, as
 it has made me many friends around the world.  I assume that you
 have seen the many versions published abroad (sorry, I forgot that
 you know only English!).

	(6) My legal advisers have told me that your statement,
 "...has consistently misrepresented his educational background..."
 besides being false, is libelous and actionable.  But don't fret,
 Jerome!  I know that education --- specially others' --- has always
 been a sore point with you, and I have no intention of hurting you,
 as you are such a source of fun!  Besides, it would be a pyrrhic
 (consult dictionary if in doubt) victory, because you have no
 visible resources to pay if I were to obtain a judgement -- a rather
 easy thing, since your source is very likely a well-known forger
 of signatures and other things.

	Do me a favour: please do NOT reply to this open letter.
 And when you feel the urge to write against me, or UNICAT, or
 Dr. Hynek once again (perhaps the next full moon, or when you have
 a new row with wife Nancy) be more manly and mail me a copy.  OK?
