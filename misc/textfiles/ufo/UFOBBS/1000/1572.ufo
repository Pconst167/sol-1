Field Investigator Trainee:

The MUFON Board of Directors has adopted the attached Field
Investigator's Examination for ongoing use.  Together with UFO
case experience and related organizational involvement, the exam
constitutes a primary means to evaluate the trainee's potential
for advancement to field investigator status.

The exam comprises one hundred questions in twelve specific
areas:  light and optics, sound, electrical/magnetic properties,
physical traces, photography, radio and radar, celestial
objects, atmosphere and weather, conventional vehicles, witness
reactions, and the UFO experience.

In total there are sixty multiple-choice questions, thirty-one
true/false items, and nine to fill in the blank.  In completing
the answer sheet on the reverse side, note the eleven spaces
amrked "see below".  For efficiency of space, these multiple
response and fill in the balnk items are at the bottom of the
page.

This is a so-called "take home" exam.  You may take as long as
necessary to complete it, and you may use any resource
available.  The majority of answers can be readily found in a
dictionary or encyclopedia.  The remainder are major findings of
one or more basic texts on the subject or are otherwise obtained
through direct observations.  There is no minimum score.
Rather, your strengths as well as areas in need of improvement
will be taken into consideration along with the number correct.
In this manner, you state director will gain further insight
concerning your own and the organization's training needs.

When completed, please return the answer sheet for correction
and followup to

                Mrs. Shirley A. Coyne

Thank you for taking part in this assessment of MUFON
investigative abilities, and good fortune in completing the
exam.
