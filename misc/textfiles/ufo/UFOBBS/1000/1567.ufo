                   PROJECT: ABDUCTION REPORT
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PURPOSE:  The obtaining and compilation of Abduction Cases.
~~~~~~~
PERSONS/ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Budd Hopkins, Dr. David M. Jacobs, Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).

     This is a message with an extraordinary request for you.

       In 1964 the National Investigations Committee on Aerial
Phenomena (NICAP) issued a compendium of information about
UFOs called "THE UFO EVIDENCE".  This enormously influential
and useful volume drew together the various aspects of
sightings and witnesses into a systematic and powerful
testament to the reality of UFOs.  It was used to educate
congressmen and the public alike and it helped change the
direction of UFO research.

     Now we have the opportunity to proceed with a project
that promises to be even more powerful and influential.  Budd
Hopkins and Dr. David Jacobs are project directors, in
participation with The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), of a major
effort to bring together the complexity and variety of the
abduction phenomenon.  The project calls for a compilation of
abduction cases from around the country investigated by as
many UFO and abduction researchers as possible.  It is hoped
that new patterns will be identified, new questions can be
asked, and new directions for research can be developed.  A
compendium of this type can provide authoritative evidence of
the reality of the phenomenon for UFO researchers, scientists,
members of the therapeutic community, and skeptics.

     Obviously this type of endeavor depends on the
cooperation of the entire UFO research community.  Without
your help it cannot be done.  The time has come now to work
together in a cooperative effort for the good of UFO research.
It is only together that we can make substantial headway into
deciphering the mysteries of this most important phenomenon.
Both Budd Hopkins and Dr. David Jacobs will be contributing
their cases and I hope that you will want to make your own
contribution so that you can be part of this historic
undertaking.
     Additionally, those of you who have had an abduction
experience, or are aware of any person or persons who have had
an abduction experience, are requested to also become involved
in this endeavor.  Any information you deem to remain
confidential will remain so, as you will be dealing with
persons of very high professionalism and credibility.

     Here is a short biography of the principles involved with
this project:

Budd Hopkins - Began researching abduction cases in 1975, is
the author of a number of books, research papers and articles,
among which are "Missing Time", "Intruders", and his newest
book "A Crack In The Universe - The Psychological Impact of
UFO Encounters".  Involved with encounter groups.  He is also
on the staff of The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON)

Dr. David M. Jacobs - holder of a B.A., M.A., and a Ph.D.,
author of a number of books, research papers and articles,
including the book "The UFO Controversy in America". He's also
a contributer to the Academic American Encyclopedia.  He is
a Consultant with The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).

The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) - A scientific organization, in

SUBMITTING ABDUCTION REPORTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The following information is broken down into two
sections:

1. Researchers/Investigators who have been involved in the
research of abduction cases.

2. Individuals who have had an abduction experience, or are
aware of someone who has.

A. Researchers/Investigators - The cases should be as complete
as possible.  Short fragments are acceptable, but would prefer
comprehensive cases.  "Multiple" cases, in which abductees see
others abducted, nonabductees see others abducted, or two or
more people are abducted at once, are important for inclusion.

Documentation should accompany reports.  Names (or pseudonyms)
along with the age, sex, and pertinent information about the
abductee, e.g., physical infirmities, ethnic background, etc,
should be sent.  Include the time, place, and date of the
abduction.  All names and addresses will be confidential.  It
is also important to send supporting material like how the
abductee first suspected that he/she was involved with the
abduction phenomenon, where the abductee went for
investigation, and so on.

If possible, please send a transcript of the hypnotic
regression, and/or non-hypnotically recalled interview.  If it
is not possible to provide a transcript, copies of audio and
video tapes will be accepted.  If a taped account is used,
transcripts will be made by us and given to the investigator
at the project's conclusion.

Please include your name, address, and phone number along with
information about your years of investigative experience and
any other biographical data that you deem appropriate.  If
your cases are used, you will be asked to sign a release
allowing us to publish them.

Either Budd Hopkins or Dr. David Jacobs will be happy to
provide their professional opinion about the methodology
employed in your case, if you so desire.

Please send your cases either to:

Budd Hopkins                     David Jacobs
246 W. 16th Street    - or -     607 E. Gravers Lane
New York, NY 10011               Wyndmoor, PA 19118

We are looking forward to working with you on this most
important project.


  Budd Hopkins                    David M. Jacobs
