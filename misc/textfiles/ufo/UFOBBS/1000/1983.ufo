        DEAD COW FOUND WITH PARTS MISSING

     Helena police don't know what to make of a dead cow, with various body parts missing, found in a pasture this morning.
     While feeding his cows in Griffin Valley early today, Buron Griffin noticed one lying on the ground.  As he got closer, he saw it was dead and parts of the cow had been cut off.
     Helena Police Chief Boyd Williams, Sgt. Larry Summerhill with the Helena Criminal Investigation Division, and Phillips County deputy sheriff Ronnie White made the first investigation this morning.
     Williams said it appeared the cow's right ear, part of her udder, anus, and genital organs had been cut off.
     Griffin said the cow was a registered Brown Swiss and was one of five of that breed of cow, he had grazing there.
     Over the last three months, Griffin reported, he has lost several of his Brown Swiss cows.  Griffin said he had assumed that they'd been stolen.
     "Over a period of about three months, they've been disappearing out of the pasture," Griffin said.  "Four of them have disappeared, and now I have four left."
     When asked if they thought it might be youth-related or connected to some type of animal sacrifice or devil worshiping, Williams and Griffin said they had no idea.
