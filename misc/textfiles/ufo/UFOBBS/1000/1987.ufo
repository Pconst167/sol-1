SUBJECT: U.S. AIR FORCE BUILDS UFO!                          FILE: UFO1987


If there are beings living on any other planet in the universe, they
may soon be gawking in wonder at a glowing, saucer shaped UFO -made
in the USA!

A classified photograph and a test flight project report sent to this
reporter by an unknown source in the Pentagon has lifted the veil of 
secrecy surrounding America's most incredible space adventure since 
Neil Armstron walked on the moon.

The photograph shows the UFO, with U.S. Air Force markings, as it soars
through space 124 miles above Earth, which can be clearly seen in the 
distance.

High ranking Air Force and Pentagon officials flatly deny that America
has developed a flying saucer or that there are plans to do so "in the
foreseeable future.

But a NASA propulsion systems researcher - who agreed to talk on the
condition he remains anonymous - revealed that test flights of the made
in America flying saucer have been underway for several years.

What's more, test pilots reportedly flew one to Mars and back - on a
Wednesday afternoon.

Most, if not all the UFOs sighted in the U.S. were ours, he told this
reporter. Especially those where someone reported seeing a UFO hovering 
over their car on a deserted highway in the dead of night.

We did our test flights at night in remote areas.

And in the beginning, there were a lot of problems that sent the saucer
off course or forced it to hover low in case of engine failure.

The ships - there are six of them - are pretty much perfected now.

They are quite large. I'm told that they can accommodate a crew of 12.

I can't go into specifics, but they are very capable of carrying nuclear
weapons.

The NASA propulsion expert said the saucer's nuclear powered turbo rocket
engine, developed at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, is capable
of maintaining an almost endless uninterrupted velocity in excess of 22,000
miles per second.

He said to maintain the project's secrecy, the UFOs are launched from a 
small island in the caribbean once used as a downrange tracking site during
the Mercury program of the 1960s.

The secret was almost exposed five years ago when a network television
crew taped the site, believing it was the headquarters of a major drug
ring, the expert said. I don't know why, but the tape was never aired.

The expert said the almost endless power supply will allow the exploration
of the farthest reaches of space.

But they are the most awesome destructive force ever devised by man.

Like a fleet of nuclear submarines, they can cruise the heavens unseen,
undetected, where they can launch an attack at a moment's notice.

But unlike nuclear subs, the UFOs can complete their mission of utter
destruction in the mere twinkling of an eye.
