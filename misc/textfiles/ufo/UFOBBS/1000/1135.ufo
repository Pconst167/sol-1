SOUTHEND STANDARD, ESSEX, ENGLAND-OCT. 13, 1989



     The  number of UFO sightings in South East Essex is soaring, say experts.
     And 19 families in the last year claim to have made contact with a creature from out of space-some "losing" up to three hours of their lives after their close encounters.
     Sheridan Lane, of the East Anglian UFO and Paranormal Association, said 1,400 sky searchers contacted them between July 1988 and July this year.
     She said:  "The number of sightings has dramatically increased.  There seems to be more and more visitations by inidentified objects.
     "Nineteen people have told us that they have made contact with an alien.  In most cases individuals have been driving along when their car has suddenly stalled.
     "In most cases their memories have been vague as to what has actually happened but the amount of time they have lost has varied between 20 minutes and three hours."
     In the last fortnight dozens of people have contacted the society's hotline to report sightings.
     On September 29, two penioners on their way home from bingo in Southend report seeing a huge object, much bigger than an aeroplne.  It was diamond shaped with a brilliant white light shining through two windows.
     Earlier that night a man in Stanford-le-Hope asid he saw a triangular object above his house.
     On the same night a Basildon couple watched an object with red, green and white lights hovering above the Basildon telephone exchange.
     ON October 1, a widower in Tilbury was woken from his sleep at 12:12am by a bright white light which lit up his whole bedroom and garden.
     On October 2, a husband, sife and daughter walking their dog along Underhill Road, South Benfleet, spotted a triangular shaped object.  It was very large with red, green, blue and white lights.  It sped away after they had watched it for 20 minutes.
     And on October 4, a couple in Canvey saw a huge saucer shaped like a skate fish at 9:30pm.
