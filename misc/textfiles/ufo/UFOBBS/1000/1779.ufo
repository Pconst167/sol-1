*****************************************************************
This is Jim McCampbell making a recording of a remarkable episode
on  July 13, 1984.  It has to do with a UFO base, cattle
mutilation, advanced weaponry, contact with aliens, etc..  
  
   The episode began about a week ago when I received a little
semi- annual periodical titled STIGMA. It is number 21, the First
half of 1984.  This little bulletin is prepared by Thomas Adams
at P.O. Box 1094, Paris,  TX 75460. He has a hot line for
reporting possible or confirmed mutilation  at (214) 784-5922.
  
   He has a rather lengthy article. One finds point of interest
on page 9 and I suppose the only way to pursue this is to read
what he has here as it is fundamental to the entire story.  
  
   Quoting "In May of 1980 a most interesting event occurred in
northern New Mexico.  An event similar in many respects to the
Doraty Case. A mother and her son were driving on a rural highway
near Cimarron, New Mexico.  They observed two or more craft and
as Judy Doraty did, they  observed a calf being abducted. Both
observers were themselves abducted and taken on separate craft to
what was apparently an underground installation (woman witnessed
mutilation in the field-dead animal taken with them), where the
woman witnessed the mutilation of the calf. It has been alleged
that she also observed a vat containing unidentified (cattle)
body parts floating in a liquid, and another vat containing the
body of a human male. The woman was subjected to an examination
and it has been further alleged that small metallic objects were
implanted
into her body as well as into her son's body.  More than one
source has informed us that CATscans have confirmed the presence
of these implants.  
  
   Paul Bennewitz,  President of his own scientific company in
Albuquerque and an investigator with the Aerial Phenomena
Research Organization, has been the principle investigator of the
case.  Interviewed in his office in April 1983,  Bennewitz
reports that through regressive hypnosis of the mother and child
and his own follow-up investigation, (including communications
received via his computer terminal which ostensively is from a
UFO related source), he was able to determine the location of the
underground facility, a kilometer underground beneath the
Jicarillo Apache Indian Reservation near Dulce, New Mexico. 
(Since 1976, one of the areas of the U.S. hardest hit by
mutilations coincidentally or whatever).  Bennewitz's information
is that this installation is operated jointly as part of a
ongoing program of cooperation between the U.S. government and
extraterrestrial UFOnauts. The story continues that, after
initial contacts years ago, the aliens agreed to give "us"
certain technological advances while we provided them with the
location for the New Mexico base, and at least three others. 
Plus, the aliens were to be allowed to carry out certain
operations, abductions and mutilations without our intervention.
The mother and son, by the way, were returned back to there car
that night. Since the incident, they have suffered repeated
trauma and difficulties as they attempt to recover from the
episode.  We pass this along because the account is, of course,
most crucial if true; but we are not in a position to confirm the
alleged findings.  Hopefully, more information regarding this
incident will be aired in the near future.  We can only consider
such reports while continuing to seek the evidence to refute or
confirm." That's the end of this remarkable quotation from
STIGMATA.  
  
   As I have been studying the idea of a base for aliens for some
time, this has caught my attention and I also suspected
cooperation between the U.S. government and the aliens. It also
gives the name and location of a man who has his own scientific
operation, Dr. Paul Bennewitz.  I tried to get in touch with him. 
Through the telephone information service I was able to do so.  
  
            Dr. Paul F. Bennewitz  
            1413 Wagontrail Drive S.E.  
            Albuquerque, New Mexico 87123  
            (505) 298-1609  
  
(EDITORS NOTE* This is presumably Dr. Bennewitz home address. We
do know that the listed phone number is no longer good.)  
  
   I got in touch with Dr. Bennewitz by telephone and indicated
that I had seen this reference to him and his work and I wanted
to find out  whether he was being misrepresented or whatever.  I
told him that I would xerox a copy of it and forward it to him
for comments, which I did.  This morning July 13, 1984, he
telephoned me and said that he, having looked over the article,
found that it was substantially correct.  I forgot to mention
that in my letter to him I said that none of the details that
were in this particular article gave me any particular strain.
The Dr. Bennewitz, who I will refer to as Paul...took the time to
close the door to his office and elaborated upon the whole story
and the conversation lasted somewhere near an hour.  It is rather
mind boggling and here is the substance of that telephone
conversation.  
  

   The article is basically accurate and he does have the
coordinates of the base.  He is a physicist and he started four
years ago to determine in his own mind whether UFOs exist or do
not, and he has gotten much more deeply  involved than he ever
intended.  It has caused him a great deal of trouble  from the
government intelligence groups.  He has pictures from the
location. 

He went with a Highway Patrol Officer and they saw a UFO take off
from a mesa at the location.  He obtained photographs and what he
calls launch ships were 330 feet long and a 130 feet across.  The
cattle rancher named Gomez and he went back to this location
which is a mesa and saw a surveillance vehicle which was about 5
ft by 10 ft, like a satellite, he said.  He had been using a
polaroid camera and then got a Hassel-blad to produce much better
pictures. He set up a monitoring station and observed that UFO's
are all over the area.  He was also able to pick up signals and
obtain video pictures that are transmissions from alien screens.
He has been dealing heavily with a Major Edwards
("somebody")(security commander of manzano) who was with Monsato
Security and two (my wife and I) of them saw four objects outside
of a warhead storage area at a range of about 2500 feet and
obtained movies of them. He now has about 6000 feet of movie
footage, of which 5000 ft. is in Super Eight. The objects have
the ability to "cloak", that's his word, he spells the word like
cloak and dagger, like cover up and he says that they can cause
themselves to go invisible by a field that causes light waves to
bend around the object that (one sees(?))-the sky behind them.  
  
   He confirmed the fact that the woman was picked up when she
accidentally observed the calf being abducted.  He has paid for
pathology work and medical doctors.  The pathologist is the
former head of the micro-biology Department of the University of
New Mexico.  They have done CATscans to show that the woman (we
confirmed the woman-not the son) and her son did in fact have
implants in their bodies.  She has a vaginal disease like
Streptococci- bulbi(?) and tried many anti-bodies (antibiotics?)
to destroy the bacteria.  That it has survived off the antibodies
(antibiotics?) themselves.  The aliens keep hassling her. (Still
true to date)  
  
   Paul kept the woman and her mother at his house and the UFO's
were flying overhead constantly.  There is no ESP involved, but
it is just plain physics.  
  
   They beam down.(they send a beam down- not "beam down") They
have a beam through which they can sense her thoughts.  They can
communicate through this beam.  She picked up their
transmissions. He devised a method of communication based upon
hex alfbic (askii)(Editors Note-it's ascii (idiots) code; one is
equal to "no" and two being "yes".  Through this code he has been
able to talk to aliens.  He then computerized the system that
would reject extraneous inputs.  He said that they can be very
threatening and malevolent. One of them he talked to said he
would drop communication if he became to familiar.  He was told
about the base.  

  
   He then told the O.S.I. of the Air Force and he has (did give)
been requested to give several presentations to high level Air
Force people in briefings on the subject, wing level command and
many others including this fellow Edwards.  And he took a
helicopter to the site-no no no.  It turned out that the wing
commander (No-Twice to site-1st by OSI agent-2nd by Col.
Carpenter) after a presentation that this fellow made, then took
a helicopter to the side (site) and made photographs.  
  
   He says that you can see saucers on the ground.  He says there
is a kind of cone- a large cone- and the larger vehicles come and
land on top of the cone with the top of the cone fitting into a
large hole in the bottom.  There is an elevator inside of the
cone and that goes down into the mountain or ground about one
kilometer.  You can see the Aliens running around the base
getting into the vehicles and stuff.  They use small vehicles to
get around that have no wheels.  They are rectangular in shape
and they levitate.  They do not show up in color because they are
highly reflective, but in B & W they are visible.  He says that 
there are beam weapons that are floating in strategic locations
and there is a road into the base.  He obtained infra-red photo's
of the area from an altitude of 14000 ft.  There is a level
highway going into the area that is thirty-six feet wide.  It is
a government road.  One can see telemetry trailers and buildings
that are five sided buildings with a dome.  It is standard
military procedure.  There are many guard points and "stakes"(?)
and there are launch domes that one can see.  Next to the
(launch) dome he saw a black limousine and another at some
distance off.  (Apparently) The careful measurements showed that
the limousine was the same length as his Lincoln Town Car. It is
a C.I.A. vehicle.  Also there as a blue van.  He has been
cautioned about these limousines as they will run you off the
road if you try to get into the area and in fact somebody has
been killed in that manner.(see copy of alien msg. enclosed.) 
  
   To the north is a launch site.  There are two wrecked ships
there: they are thirty-six feet with wings, and one can see
oxygen and hydrogen tanks. There are four cylindrical objects,
Socorro type--two carrying something while flying.  The whole
operation is based upon a government agreement and a technology
trade.  We get out of it atomic ships that are operated by
plutonium.  
 
   The Cash-Landrum case was one of them.  The doors jammed open
and neutron radiation came out.  
 
   They are based at Kirtland Air Force Base and Holloman AFB and
some place in Texas.(No - only knew of one based at HAFB.[1/2/86
based at Kirtland now].  Possibly Fort Hood, Texas-a guess only.)
He said the government is paying the bills for Cash-Landrum
victims.(Editor's note*-This is true only because Cash 
and Landrum obtained an attorney who filed suit against the
government.) (OSI input-found out later this was not true unless
some one covering)(Editors Note*- It is in fact true. The
government did pay Cash and Landrums hospital bills. Both 
women and the grandson were diagnosed as suffering from radiation
poisoning.)  Refueling of the Plutonium is accomplished at Los
Alamos.  He has traced pictures as far back as 1948. It was there
even then.  Pictures in 1952 (1962), you can see many saucers and
the base and trucks in winter time.  The road was "passed 
off" to the local inhabitants as a lumber contract.  He has
photographs (I believe) of the firing of a beam weapon that
ejects (?) in two directions.  (That would be necessary on a
flying saucer.  The reaction forces would impede the vehicle.) He
has computed the speeds of flying saucers at 15,000 mph and
indicated that the pilots (of ours) are from N.S.A.,  the
National Security Agency.  The aliens have had atomic propulsion
system for 48 years and the saucers themselves operate on an
electrical charge basis having to do with a crystal
semi-conductor and (maybe a) a super lattice.  I think he said
"as you increase the voltage, the current goes down".  (No
typically).  At present there are six to eight vehicles, maybe up
to ten over the area and sometimes up to 100.  They can be seen
in the clouds and produce nitrogen nitrate (I assume or speculate
it is this).  You will see black spots in the clouds.  They eat
holes in the cloud.  If you see black spots in a cloud, then you
can tell that a vehicle is in there. 
 
   He says that they come from six different cultures and in his
communications that some come from a binary system,  possibly
Zeta Reticuli and from distances up to and larger than 32 light
years away.  The also (appear) have one to three ships in earth
orbit at 50,000 KM altitude (Based upon data).  He had to form
the words to try and communicate and he produced a vocabulary of
6(27) words in a matrix form and uses a computer.  The flying
saucer (we see) are limited to operation in the atmosphere. 
 
   Now with regard to the cattle problem, the aliens are using
the DNA from the cattle and are making humanoids.  He got
pictures of their video screen.  Some of these creatures are
animal like, some are near human and some are human and short
with large heads.  They grow the embryos.  After the embryos
become active by a year of training, presumably that is required
for them to become operational.  When they die, they go back into
the tank.  Their parts are recovered. 
 
   In 1979 something happened and the base was closed. There was
an argument over weapons and our people were chased out, more
than 100 people involved.(Some place later he indicates further
details on this point.) 
 
  


  The base is 4000 ft. long and our helicopters are going in and
out all the time.  When it became known that he was familiar with
all this, the mutilations stopped (true).  They are taking
humanoid embryos out of this base to some place else. I asked if
it was Albuquerque or Los Alamos (note 1/2/86-looks like it "is"
albuq.), but he said he didn't know.  He said there are still
quite a few of the helicopters in operation.  They fly at night
(all unmarked). He went up there himself in a helicopter and the
O.S.I. briefed the pilot and he thought perhaps the copter pilot
himself might have been an undercover man.  They saw the
helicopter pads up there-Viet Nam type, with bearing markers and
the trees pushed off away from the location.  It is such a wild
area he said.  He agreed to send me the coordinates of this base. 

   Regarding the abductions of people, they pick out medium to
low IQ personnel.  They are able to scope out each one.[so we can
do the same thing with electro- magnetic spectrum analyzer.](I
don't know this part-word mix up-drop).  They pick up these
people and then put implants into them and then take tissue
samples, including ovum from the women, sperm from the men and
DNA. 
 
   They can program these people as slaves to do whatever they
wish and they will have no memory of it.  They (the hard core
type) staunchly refuse to be x-rayed or hypnotically regressed.
You can recognize them because of their eyes. He says "peculiar
look in the eyes (an expression) and a funny smile".  Hynek knows
about all of this and has been in contact with Coral (Lorenzen).
He regards Hynek as a threat (Not really-I just think that he is
still a Gov. cover)  At his house, he showed Hynek films and out
in the back yard a flying saucer.  He asked Hynek about his view
with regard to abductions as to how many people might have been
abducted.  Hynek, un-hesitantly said about one in forty. 
 
   He said that many people come to his door to see him, just
"out of the blue" and he sees scars on the back of their necks.
That previous old scars are easy to detect and that new ones are
hard to detect.  He feels that this is a sickening situation. 
 
   The aliens have gone wild and use hypodermics [and notes a (I
don't known either) parallel four times".] (McCampbell: I don't
know what that means)  He has been paralyzed four times and has
been hit 250 times by hypodermics.  He says they knock you cold
and do whatever they want to do and the above points have been
verified medically. 
 
   A man came to see him with a top secret document that was
dated in the 50's, indicating if anybody found out about all of
this that they would kill them.  He was asked "doesn't that
bother you?"  He said "no it didn't." 
 



   He said he had sent in some film to Kodak and there were seven
rolls.  They were Ektachrome G which could not be processed
locally, so they had to go to Kodak.  He does all of the film
work commercially so that nobody could claim that he had
monkeyed, but one was (was missing for 2 months) plain
Ektachrome, but (when received) nine feet was missing and this
was close-ups of UFO's that he had taken.  The missing pictures
of the nine feet (the 9 ft didn't-other known only to me did)
showed up in a top secret document that he studied and the code
name is Aquarius and it is a project of the (I was told NASA)
National Security Agency.  They are the ones that kept his film
and copied it with deletions on Ektachrome and sent it back (I
suspect). 
 
   There have been indirect threats by Air Force Intelligence
against him. 
 
   The location of the base is 2 1/2 miles northwest of Dulce and
almost over looks the town. It is up on a mesa.  We discussed the
similarity between everything we have been talking about here and
the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind".  He said he
speculated that seemed to be a plan of disclosure, that is the
movie.  The coordinates of the location are not far off and the 
mountain where the actual base is looks much like the mountain in
the movie. 
 
   The next thing was -- Discussing the trade off--alright.  Here
is what we got in the trade off.  We got the atomic technology,
the atomic flying ships.  Several of them, the first one was
wrecked on the ground and it can be seen and photographed from
the air.  A second one was wrecked. A third one was wrecked. 
Apparently this last one was repaired and was the one that was in
Houston -- Near Houston in the Cash-Landrum case.  The second
item that we get out of it, are the beam weapons, the beam
technology and third (I speculate) is the thought beam.  That is
the means by which communication is accomplished.  It is
electrostatic in character with a magnetic (artifact)
componentand it is the only way of communicating with people.
They have to have the implants in order to use it.  In the crash
that occurred at the base when there was a disturbance of some
sort, the aliens killed 66 of our people and 44 got away (alien
computer input-true?-I do not know.) Over an argument they turned
on us. 
 
    I discussed with him whether he wished me to relay any of
this information to other people.  He said he had no objection. 
He would like to review any writing that I might do, to make sure
that it was right in advance, and also make sure that the source
of information was given.  I mentioned in particular, John
Schuessler, who would be extremely interested in part of this
data. 
 


   I gave him a summary of my analysis of the electromagnetic
environment around UFO's related to propulsion.  He was going to
study that, but he did not comment off hand.  He was familiar
with what the aliens called MPS which means manipulations per
second--no, manipulations per sequence. In an electrostatic 
field that can be manipulated into many configurations and the
craft can stall.  In order to prevent that, this field is
adjusted once every forty milliseconds.  He has studied the
trails from UFO's and they seem to break down at a pulse rate of
62 per second. Based upon the color movie pictures, there seems
to be a blast of light and a spectral components and composition
there, with a bow-wave in front of the UFO with nitrogen showing
green and oxygen showing blue, but with the saucer being
invisible.  They can run into a car or airplane and this bow-
wave will destroy them. Rockets can hit this bow-wave and be
destroyed.  They can't penetrate it.  At White Sands he was shown
pictures of an F-15 shooting rockets with a missile at a target
and the saucers came in behind the missile, 30 ft behind, and
then flew through the explosion.  He didn't know what the purpose
of this demonstration was, but suspected it might be just to show
how invulnerable they are.  But some times the saucers get into
trouble and they are all consumed in some kind of way. 
 
   When he went up to Dulce in a helicopter, they landed and left
some equipment there, but when they came back the pilot was
extremely nervous.  Paul wanted to land on the base, but the
pilot wouldn't do that. They came back to Dulce and landed on a
small strip there, where they found two large Huey Helicopters. 
The indian (Highway Patrolman) in charge there named Valdez went
aboard one of the choppers and they found them to be full of
commando's.  They estimated a total of about 75 commandos, fully
armed with M1 rifles (no-M16's) and rockets (and launchers). 
They did not have any indication of rank.  They only had shoulder
patches on (Valdez says no-not true-my mistake-I did not get that
close.) and the helicopters had no identification other than
numbers.  The helicopters were part of a project called Blue
Light and they were from Fort Carson, Colorado. (OSI input)  When
they left they were escorted by these two large Huey Helicopters. 
As they were flying along--in the background, they saw rise up
one of the advanced space technology vehicles that looked like a
manta ray with negative dihedral and projections coming down.  It
flew vertically past the two accompanying helicopters.  Paul
feels that it is imperative that this information be released
because he feels that it is unconstitutional for the government
to be involved in such an arrangement that invades the privacy of
the individuals by the implantation.  He said that "once they
have been tampered with by the aliens, they are never the
same."(I suppose one can easily see that.) (Jim McCampbell
comments) So it appears that the--for the privilege of collecting
the biological materials in the mutilation of and the abductions
and the operations on board the craft, the government has allowed
this to go on and even to assist for the privilege of getting the
Nuclear flight technology, plus also the embryos which are flown
out of the base. (A rather fantastic story) (Jim McCampbell
comment)  Paul strikes me as being extremely conservative,
extremely knowledgeable and reliable scientist, who was
intimately familiar with sophisticated laboratory equipment. 
He is thoroughly scientific and reliable.  (Jim McCampbell
evaluation)  The base was started in 1948 and in the text above, 
I indicated a reference to 1942 that should be 1952, showing
major construction of the base from the photographs that were
studied.  This is the end of the message.-Jim McCampbell.

Comments from the Editor 
 
   This is part one of two files concerning McCampbell's
interview of Paul Bennewitz.  At this point UFINET can neither
confirm or deny the content of this report, but will state that
since this time evidence has come to the fore that in many way
give weight to much of what was stated here.  It is suggested
that you read the analysis of the Bennewitz papers that was
prepared by William S. English, independent investigator, and who
was formerly with APRO.
