Two witnesses were watching news when suddenly a lot of thick black
lines of interference appeared on their TV.  They looked around the
house for the cause and finally went outside.  They saw two square
shaped lights in the sky, not very far from them so as they could
make out the shapes.  Up higher in the sky at the same time there
were about 8-10 of the same type of goldish white squarish objects.
They were moving very, very slowly in a wide spread formation towards
Monroeville.  They watched for 3-4 minutes until they could no longer
see them.  Their TV picutre came back clear when they could no longer
see the objects.
