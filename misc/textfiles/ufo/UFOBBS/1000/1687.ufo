SUBJECT: SMITH'S LETTER TO JIM MOSELEY, 2/89                 FILE: UFO1687 

 
 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Note:  The following letter was made available to UFONET by Dr. Willy
        Smith.  According to Smith, it was originally sent to Jim
        Moseley in confidence.  Subsequently, it was passed on to Ed
        Walters by Moseley, and soon found its way into a number of
        people's hands.  In part, this letter was responsible for some
        of the recent controversy surrounding Smith.

 Dear Jim:

 Here is a copy of one of the photos (the following five words are
 both underlined and darker than the rest of the text - TM) allegedly
 taken by Ed Walters in New York.  Normally, I would have done nothing
 except filing them, but Dr. Vigilio Sanchez Ocejo, who was visiting
 me when the mail brought the photos, suggested that I should get in
 touch with you.  What I did.

 I have only one question:

             DID ED WALTERS TAKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH?

   Then:

           (a)  if the answer is YES, the sequence will add
 credibility to his story, as it would indicate that the UFO
 events are not related to Gulf Breeze as a location, but to
 Mr. Walters, following him to other places.  In this case, I
 would like to know the exact date the photos were taken.

           (b)  if the answer is NO, the anonymous photographer
 has met the challenge issued by Ed-of-Gulf-Breeze in Vol.13, #5
 of the International UFO Reporter (p.23), when he wrote:

      "I suggest ...  that the best way to cast
              doubt on a UFO photo is to duplicate it."

 If   (b)  is the right answer, Ed's photos have been replicated.

 You can publish the photo if you want to, but (the following nine
 words are underlined - TM) it must be returned to me for further
 study, regardless of what Mr. Walters' answer might be,


                           Regards,




 c.c.  Dr. Sanchez Ocejo

 Encl: one photo, identified on back.
