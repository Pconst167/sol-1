MYSTERY OF METEOR ROAD STILL UNSOLVED

By The Tribune-Review

     There's  no  telling who'll show up in Kecksburg  August  13
when  the  Community Day Parade trumpets the 50th anniversary  of
the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department.
     A  chance  exists  that someone will boldly  go  beyond  the
inspiring  tales  of firefighting heroics into another  world  to
debate whether a UFO or meteor landed in a wooded area off Meteor
Road -- that's right, METEOR ROAD -- 24 years ago.
     Talk  threatens to climb beyond the stratosphere ever  since
a  Japanese  television crew visited the  area  in  Mt.  Pleasant
Township earlier in they year.   The footage shot -- no one seems
to  know what will be highlighted -- will form part of a two-hour
special  scheduled  to  air in that country later  in  the  year,
possibly September.
     Lore about what happened on Dec.  9, 1965, encroaches on the
Zone of Beyondo Bizzaro.
     The Office of Special Investigations at Wright-Patterson Air
Force  Base  in  Dayton,  Ohio,  won't  comment  on  whether  its
personnel were running around Meteor Road that day.
     The  township  supervisors thought enough of  what  occurred
then to christen the byway as Meteor Road.  As expected, the road
signs  disappear  as  fast as  a  shooting  star,  said  township
Secretary Ray Zimmerman.
     "They're a big item," he says.
     Kecksburg  Fire  Department President Jim Mayes was  on  the
road  that day,  looking down into a field as military personnel,
state police and a swarm of authorities converged to do something
mysterious and keep area residents from seeing it.
     "I remember it like it was yesterday," said Mayes.   "We had
the four-wheel-drive truck and we took the military  down.   They
kept  people there all night.   There was a tractor-trailer and a
couple other vehicles, and I still say they took something out of
there.   The  big thing about it was the blue blinding lights  --
like a timing light."
     The  field of Jerome and Valeria Miller was tramped  through
by  Boy Scouts a day later,  searching for the magnet that  would
later  draw college students from the University of Colorado  and
the film crew from Japan.
     Valeria  Miller  was  not at home at the time  of  the  most
famous  drop-in  since John Martin Keck started  the  village  of
Kecksburg in the 1860s.
     Stan Gordon,  who heads the Pennsylvania Association for the
Study of the Unexplained,  hasn't completely ruled out that space
debris -- and not a UFO -- went down in the area.
     But   the  easier  to  swallow  suggestion  has  choked  one
eyewitness who disputed that theory in talking with Gordon.
     The eyewitness,  identified only as Pete by Gordon, said the
object  resembled a giant metal acorn and contained writing  that
"looked like hieroglyphics" on part of its raised  surface.   The
object was supposedly loaded onto a flatbed trailer, covered with
a tarp and hauled to an unknown location.
     Gordon is in search of more witnesses who might want to come
forward  on  what  made the noise heard  around  the  world,  and
whether,  just  by chance,  anyone might have seen anything leave
that area before authorities arrived.
