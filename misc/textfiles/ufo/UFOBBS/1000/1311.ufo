SUBJECT: MAYLENE, ALABAMA SIGHTING REPORT                    FILE: UFO1311


LOG # 890712 - Event 11/09/88, near Maylene, Alabama.  Investigators Jeff and
Karen Ballard.  Returning from a friend's home, a woman noticed blinking
lights to her right.  On rounding a curve, she spotted an oblong metallic
object ahead, perhaps 40 feet in diameter.  It displayed two bright white
lights on the perimeter, four smaller yellow-white lights surrounding a
circular area on the bottom, and a dark raised portion ("hump") on either
side.  Seeming to hover momentarily, the object then rose and glided over the
woman's car from a distance.  As it did so, she felt disjointed consciously
from her physical surroundings, believing afterward that she watched
it from an elevated viewing angle as it left.
