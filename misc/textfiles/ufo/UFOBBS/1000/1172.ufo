	As UFONET is not itself an investigative body, but a forum for
 the thoughts and ideas of the public, UFOlogists, and research groups;
 part of our mandate is to alert people to the existence of worthwhile
 research organizations.  Recently, I learned of a new organization by
 the name of UFORIC, which is based in Vancouver.  Other than a having
 a packet of documents from them, I have very little first-hand info
 about the group.  However, from what I've seen so far, they do seem
 to be a professionally run organization, which in this field of study,
 is saying a lot.  What follows then is some reprints of some of the
 information that was sent to me.  If you're interested in pursuing
 this further, contact addresses and phone numbers will be listed.

	Again, what follows should not be construed as an endorsement
 of UFORIC, although my own personal feelings are that UFORIC seems
 to be a legitimate organization, and one in which your money wouldn't
 be wasted.  One thought to bear in mind is that this group has only
 been in operation for about 14 wks. and may be "here today, gone
 tomorrow".  However I don't think this will be the case with UFORIC,
 as they seem to have done their homework and started on a solid
 organizational foundation.  UFORIC was "Incorporated" earlier this
 year in the province of British Columbia.  UFONET is in no way
 affiliated with UFORIC, although its hoped that their will be two-
 way co-operation between both groups.  One of the Directors, Lorne
 Goldfeather, informed me that they were looking to have a BBS arm
 of UFORIC 8-12 months down the road.  At present, I'm trying to
 procure a UFONET node in Vancouver, in order that we might have
 quicker access to Directors and members of UFORIC in the B.C. area.

		     To Whom It May Concern


	UFORIC - U.F.O. Research Institute of Canada is pleased to
 announce its services to the civilian, medical, governmental, police
 and military communities.

	We maintain a 24 hour REPORTING AND NEWS DISSEMINATION SERVICE
 on our HOTLINE.  All incoming calls and information disclosed to us
 is held in strictest confidence, never leaving the office of the
 director or shown to others without the expressed permission of the
 confidant.

	As a non-profit organization, we depend on contributions to
 maintain our services as well as doing on-site research with
 monitoring equipment.  Any donations of $20.00 and over will entitle
 you to club membership for one year.  Every month you will receive
 material in the mail on the U.F.O. phenomena.

	Our government has had two official documented studies on
 the subject of flying saucers.  They even set up an observation
 post with electromagnetic detectors at Shirley Bay in the province
 of Ontario.  Canada now has an astronomical data collection agency
 in Victoria, British Columbia.

	An item we are currently offering consists of two interesting
 recordings on one audio tape.  The first part consists of a live
 conversation recorded by American BASE COMMANDER HALT at Woodbridge,
 England.  Halt, Lieutenant Bruce Englund, Major Zickler and Sergeant
 Nevells were taking radiation readings at a landing site in a forest
 close by.  Suddenly they saw several U.F.O.s fly near them and they
 became very frightened.  Former Woodbridge Base Commander Colonel
 Sam Morgan released the audiotape to British Solicitor Harry Harris
 in 1984.

	Following this, we have inserted a completely different
 recording of what we believe to be an extraterrestrial voice
 pleading for help four times.  This tape came to us during our
 research of a family who on several occasions encountered U.F.O.s.
 The father is a prominent local businessman.  His wife made a
 recording on audio tape which she planned to send to friends in
 Australia.  After finishing she played it back and was disappointed
 to find distortions in her voice throughout the tape.  Strangely
 it was only in the parts where she spoke about U.F.O.s  Her husband
 made a HIGH SPEED DUBBING, and oddly enough, it came out with her
 voice in slow motion overlaid by another eerie voice pleading for
 help four times.  At this time we are trying to determine if it
 has voice print.

	We will send you these recordings, one audio cassette
 for $15 (Money order).  Please send postal money orders to:
 Lorne Goldfeather, Dept. 25 - 1665 Robson St., Vancouver, B.C.,
 V6G 3C2, Canada.
