                     IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?
                       by Michael Corbin

    As we ponder the question of life elsewhere in the universe,
it  is now without question that we should be utilizing our  vast
technology  to listen for intelligent radio signals  coming  from
other possibly civilized worlds in the galaxy.

    As  we  continue  to breach worldly boundaries with satellite
communications -- television and radio transmissions  --  and  all
manner  of  electromagnetic emissions that occur on Earth 24 hours
per day, have you ever wondered what happens to the signals?  They
not only reach their intended destinations, but continue endlessly
into the vastness of space in all directions.

    To answer our question -- "Is Anybody Out There?" -- we must
turn back the pages of history to the beginning of the radio age.

    In a small laboratory in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a young
and  enthusiastic  inventor  and  scientist  tuned  in on what he
believed  to  be  intelligent  transmissions  from  outer  space.
Thoroughly  convinced  that advanced beings were trying to signal
us, Nikola Tesla revealed this event to the public in 1899.

    What did Tesla receive?  Was it a beacon - much like the one
from the monolith of "2001: A Space Odyssey" - intended  to  give
life  to  what  we  know today as the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence? A beacon to pique our  curiosity  and  to  formally
introduce us to perhaps our origins?  Or did this research perish
with  all  of  Tesla's  research papers when seized by the United
States federal authorities?  Read on.

    Twenty-two  years  later,  another  young  and  enthusiastic
inventor,  Guglielmo  Marconi, the father of the "wireless," also
claimed to have  received  intelligently  coded  signals  from  a
civilized world in space.

    Although  not  widely  known,  but nonetheless public, these
were not the only incidents where radio signals  of  a  seemingly
intelligent nature were received.

    A  professor of Astronomy at Amherst College, Dr. David Todd
made a photographic record of radio signals emanating  from  Mars
in 1924 as it made a close approach to Earth.

    According  to  Dr.   Ronald  Bracewell, a physicist with the
Radio Astronomy Institute at  Stanford  University,  strange  and
unexplained signals were received in 1927, 1928, and 1964.

    What  could  account  for  such activity aside from galactic
neighbors attempting to contact us?

    Some  unusual  radio  emissions  could  have  been  pulsars.
Pulsars  are  very  unusual  because,  rather  than  producing  a
continuous  radio  intensity at the Earth,  they  produce  short,
regularly  spaced bursts of  radio  emission.   Typically,  these
bursts  last  about  one-twentieth  of  a  second  and  occur  at
intervals of about one second.

    However,  pulsars  were  not the cause of an  incident  that
occurred  in  1959 -  an incident which shook NASA officials  and
began what could be the most intense "Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence"  to  ever come to the fore.   NASA  detected  radio
emissions from an unknown satellite circling the Earth.   Perhaps
this was a Soviet satellite;  it is unknown,  as our research was
unable to find more information.

    Following this event, a quiet effort was underway to begin a
listening  project.   It was called OZMA and was organized by Dr.
Otto  Struve,  one of the most distinguished astronomers of  that
time  and  associated  with  the  National  Science   Foundation.
Notwithstanding  a  public  gone  crazy  on  UFO  activity,  this
project's  credibility  was boosted by  Dr.  Struve's  impressive
background  and credentials which carried a lot of weight in  the
scientific community.   Dr. Struve announced soberly to the press
that  there could be one million intelligently inhabited  planets
in our galaxy alone.

    Appointed  by  Struve,  Dr.  Frank Drake was Project  OZMA's
director.   Drake also echoed Struve's sentiments by pointing out
the tremendous benefits to our world by establishing contact with
beings far advanced of us.

    Although  the  subject of UFOs was not  discussed,  the  Air
Force was very uneasy about this listening project.

    During  formation  of  OZMA,  it was  determined  by  Philip
Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi that a frequency of 1420 mHz  would
be a universally recognizable communication channel.

    In 1961, Drake and his staff at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia took their first step in
the  search  by  focusing on Tau-Ceti,  one of the  nearest  suns
likely to have intelligent life.

    Within  two  minutes something  totally  shocking  happened.
They were receiving intelligently coded signals from the Tau-Ceti
system.   As Dr. Drake related later, "the spooky signals had had
an  unexpected  effect  on everyone."  Within a short  period  of
time,  the  signals  faded  leaving the scientists  in  the  room
literally stunned.

    To avoid possible public panic, all discussion of this event
was kept quiet, but because of the sensational magnitude  of  the
event,  word  quickly  leaked  to the public.  A swift and lethal
blow to the credibility of the project  soon  followed  from  the
Pentagon, which stated that the strange signals had been received
from  a military station so secret that its identity could not be
revealed.

    Abruptly,  Dr.  Struve closed Project OZMA.  At a conference
before  a bewildered press,  Dr.  Struve shocked them by  stating
that  it  was  "folly" to listen for  messages  from  space,  and
besides,  it might be unwise for us to answer them without  first
knowing their identity and possible intentions.

    Quite peculiar behavior for a man  of  Struve's  credentials,
considering  his  strong  comments in favor of the project, not to
mention subsequent events in the SETI story.

    Were the strange signals  merely  from  an  earthly  military
station?  Perhaps.  But, if this were the case, would OZMA have to
close so abruptly?  One can reasonably argue "no."

    On  the other hand,  consider next the actions of a man  who
claimed it was "folly" to listen in on our galactic neighbors.

    With some urgency and in complete secret, November 1961 saw a
meeting held at Green Bank to  discuss  seriously  the  number  of
worlds  capable  of  communicating with Earth.  On this panel were
many well-known scientists, among them the man  who  had  suddenly
ridiculed the original project as "folly" -- Dr.  Otto Struve, Dr.
Melvin  Calvin,  Dr.  John C. Lilly, Dr. Frank Drake, and Dr. Carl
Sagan.

    It was concluded at this  meeting  that  "There  are  between
40,000,000 and 50,000,000 worlds which are either trying to signal
us or are listening for messages from Earth." This  statement  has
become known as "The Green Bank Forumla."

    Following this, control of listening projects was turned over
to  the  Air  Force  Office of Scientific Research in Puerto Rico.
Although the true story of Tau-Ceti may never be  publicly  known,
it is known that this was the birth of SETI.

    As  part  of  NASA's  Exobiology  Program, NASA SETI has been
ongoing  since  1982  and  is  geared  towards  understanding  the
origin, evolution and distribution of life in the Universe.

    What does it take to launch a program of this sort?

    Through  Stanford  University,  a   compact   and   flexible
prototype  Multi-Channel  Spectrum  Analyzer  (MCSA 1.0) has been
designed and built.  It  provides  144  channels  with  576-Hertz
spectral  resolution and 74,000 channels at 1/2-Hertz resolution.
Present signal recognition software algorithms have  demonstrated
efficient  and  near  optimal  detection  of continuous wave (CW)
signals and narrowband pulses whether stationary or  drifting  up
to (+/-)1 channel/observational frame.

    In  testing,  this  system  was able, in the Targeted Search
mode,  to  detect  the  one-Watt  signal  from  the  Pioneer   10
spacecraft  transmitter beyond the solar system using MCSA 1.0 at
Goldstone. In the test of the Sky Survey mode, it was able to map
a portion of the sky at a frequency corresponding to one sideband
of the Voyager 2 transmitter and to detect that  spacecraft  more
than 3 billion kilometers from Earth on its way to Neptune.

    The  operational  phase of the program will consist  of  two
modes:   the  Targeted Search and the Sky Survey.   The  Targeted
Search  will  examine  800  to 1000  nearby  Sun-like  stars  for
evidence  of  continuous wave (CW) and narrowband pulsed  signals
over  the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz (Gigahertz).   The  Sky
Survey  will  search  the  entire sky for  CW  signals  over  the
frequency  range  1 to 10 GHz.   The Targeted  Search  will  have
significantly  more sensitivity than the Sky Survey,  whereas the
Sky  Survey  covers  a  larger area of  the  sky  and  a  greater
frequency range.

    Are  the  millions  of  dollars  put  toward  this  research
justified?   Would  this  suggest that science is convinced  that
life exists beyond our tiny little planet?

    Consider  the next two statements from the Astronomy  Survey
Committee  of the National Academy of Sciences in 1972 and  1982,
respectively:

        "Our  civilization is within reach of  one  of
        the   greatest   steps   in   its   evolution:
        knowledge  of  the  existence,   nature,   and
        activities  of  independent  civilizations  in
        space.   At  this instant,  through this  very
        document,  are  perhaps  passing  radio  waves
        bearing the conversations of distant creatures
        -- conversations  that  we could record if  we
        but pointed a telescope in the right direction
        and tuned to the proper frequency...
        Indeed   there   exist   the   know-how    and
        instruments  to  search  for  extraterrestrial
        civilizations...Each passing year has seen our
        estimates  of the probability of life in space
        increase,  along  with  our  capabilities  for
        detecting it.   More and more scientists  feel
        that  contact  with other civilizations is  no
        longer  something  beyond  our  dreams  but  a
        natural  event in the history of mankind  that
        will perhaps occur in the lifetime of many  of
        us.   The promise is now too great,  either to
        turn  away  from  it or to  wait  much  longer
        before  devoting  major resources to a  search
        for other  intelligent beings...
        In the long run,  this may be one of science's
        most important and most profound contributions
        to mankind and to our civilization."

        "While  the  Committee  recognized  that  this
        endeavor  has a character different from  that
        normally    associated    with    astronomical
        research,  intelligent organisms are as much a
        part  of the universe as stars  and  galaxies;
        investigating     whether    some    of    the
        electromagnetic  radiation  now  arriving   at
        Earth  was generated by intelligent beings  in
        space may thus be considered a legitimate part
        of astronomy.   Moreover,  the techniques that
        can now be most effectively brought to bear on
        a  SETI  program for the 1980's are  those  of
        astronomy...
        It   is  hard  to  imagine  a  more   exciting
        astronomical  discovery or one that would have
        greater  impact on human perceptions than  the
        detection of extraterrestrial intelligence."

    What  if  we  do receive communication from extraterrestrial
intelligence?  What if we receive that big  "hello"  from  across
the galaxy? Do we answer?

    SETI -  to   be   distinguished  from   communication   with
extraterrestrial  intelligence (CETI),  which implies actual two-
way  formulation  of  a  mutually  understandable  language   for
discourse - has had at least nine searches since its beginning in
1960, with no reported success.

    Dr.  Arthur C.  Clarke, a highly respected author and space-
travel  authority,  believes  that a malevolent super-race  might

transmit vicious,  compelling information which could cause us to
destroy ourselves.

    Perhaps  one  person  responsible  for  the seriousness with
which scientists take the possibility of life in the universe was
Nobel Prize winner Sir Martin Ryle, who stated that no signals be
intentionally sent to other stars for fear of an  invasion  or  a
loss  of  human  values  when  contact  is  made  with a superior
intelligence.

    Despite  these  warnings,   for  over  fifty  years,  radio,
television  and  radar  emissions have been traveling  away  from
Earth at the speed of light,  making our presence in the universe
known.

    If it is found that life exists elsewhere in  the  Universe,
we  could  benefit  tremendously from such a discovery.  It could
revolutionize many aspects of earthly life.

    Or, on the other hand, it could be devastating to us.

    Dr.   Carl   Sagan  once  stated  we  should  refrain   from
transmitting "because we do not know the intentions of a superior
galactic society."

    Recently NASA was awarded $40 million dollars for the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence from 1993 to 1999.

    Through  efforts  of  a host of agencies associated with the
NASA/SETI program a set of guidelines have been established which
will act as a global protocol for  dealing  with  our  neighbors.
Called  the  "Declaration  of  Principles  Concerning  Activities
Following the Detection  of  Extraterrestrial  Intelligence,"  it
reads as follows:

     We,  the institutions and individuals participating in  the
     search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

     Recognizing    that   the   search   for   extraterrestrial
     intelligence  is an integral part of space exploration  and
     is  being  undertaken  for peaceful purposes  and  for  the
     common interest of all mankind,

     Inspired  by  the  profound  significance  for  mankind  of
     detecting evidence of extraterrestrial  intelligence,  even
     though the probability of detection may be low,

     Recalling the Treaty of Principles Governing the Activities
     of  States  in  the  Exploration and Use  of  Outer  Space,
     Including  the  Moon  and  Other  Celestial  Bodies,  which
     commits  States  Parties  to that  Treaty  "to  inform  the
     Secretary  General  of  the United Nations as well  as  the
     public and the international scientific community,  to  the
     greatest  extent feasible and practicable,  of the  nature,
     conduct,  locations and results" of their space exploration
     activities (Article XI),

     Recognizing that any initial detection may be incomplete or
     ambiguous  and thus require careful examination as well  as
     confirmation,  and  that it is essential  to  maintain  the
     highest   standards   of  scientific   responsibility   and
     credibility,

     Agree to observe the following principles for disseminating
     information   about  the  detection   of   extraterrestrial
     intelligence:

         1.    Any   individual,   public  or  private  research
     institution,  or  governmental agency that believes it  has
     detected    a   signal   from   or   other   evidence    of
     extraterrestrial intelligence (the discoverer) should  seek
     to  verify  that  the most plausible  explanation  for  the
     evidence  is the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence
     rather than some other natural phenomenon or  anthropogenic
     phenomenon  before making any public announcement.   If the
     evidence cannot be confirmed as indicating the existence of
     extraterrestrial   intelligence,    the   discoverer    may
     disseminate the information as appropriate to the discovery
     of any unknown phenomenon.

         2.  Prior to making a public announcement that evidence
     if  extraterrestrial  intelligence has been  detected,  the
     discoverer  should promptly inform all other  observers  or
     research   organizations   that   are   parties   to   this
     declaration,  so  that  those  other parties  may  seek  to
     confirm  the discovery by independent observations at other
     sites  and so that a network can be established  to  enable
     continuous monitoring of the signal or phenomenon.  Parties
     to   this   declaration   should  not   make   any   public
     announcement  of  this information until it  is  determined
     whether  this information is or is not credible evidence of
     the  existence  of  extraterrestrial   intelligence.    The
     discoverer  should inform his/her or its relevant  national
     authorities.

         3.   After concluding that the discovery appears to  be
     credible  evidence  of extraterrestrial  intelligence,  and
     after  informing  other parties to  this  declaration,  the
     discoverer  should  inform observers throughout  the  world
     through  the Central Bureau for Astronomical  Telegrams  of
     the International Astronomical Union, and should inform the
     Secretary General of the United Nations in accordance  with
     Article  XI  of  the Treaty  on  Principles  Governing  the
     Activities  of States in the Exploration and Use  of  Outer
     Space,  Including  the Moon and Other Bodies.   Because  of
     their demonstrated interest in and expertise concerning the
     question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence,
     the  discoverer should simultaneously inform the  following
     international  institutions  of the  discovery  and  should
     provide   them  with  all  pertinent  data   and   recorded
     information  concerning  the evidence:   the  International
     Telecommunication Union, the Committee on Space Research of
     the   International  Council  of  Scientific  Unions,   the
     International  Astronautical Federation, the  International
     Academy  of  Astronautics, the International  Institute  of
     Space Law, Commission 51 of the International  Astronomical
     Union  and Commission J of the International Radio  Science
     Union.

         4.    A   confirmed   detection   of   extraterrestrial
     intelligence  should be disseminated promptly, openly,  and
     widely  through  scientific  channels  and  public   media,
     observing   the  procedures  in  this   declaration.    The
     discoverer  should have the privilege of making  the  first

     public announcement.

         5.   All data necessary for confirmation  of  detection
     should  be made available to the  international  scientific
     community through publications, meetings, conferences,  and
     other appropriate means.

         6.  The discovery should be confirmed and monitored and
     any  data  bearing  on  the  evidence  of  extraterrestrial
     intelligence  should be recorded and stored permanently  to
     the  greatest  extent feasible and practicable, in  a  form
     that  will  make  it available  for  further  analysis  and
     interpretation.  These recordings should be made  available
     to  the  international  institutions listed  above  and  to
     members  of the scientific community for further  objective
     analysis and interpretation.

         7.   If  the evidence of detection is in  the  form  of
     electromagnetic  signals, the parties to  this  declaration
     should   seek  international  agreement  to   protect   the
     appropriate  frequencies  by exercising  the  extraordinary
     procedures  established  within  the  World  Administrative
     Radio Council of the International Telecommunication Union.

         8.   No  response  to a signal  or  other  evidence  of
     extraterrestrial   intelligence   should  be   sent   until
     appropriate  international consultations have taken  place.
     The  procedures for such consultations will be the  subject
     of a separate agreement, declaration of arrangement.

         9.  The SETI Committee of the International Academy  of
     Astronautics,  in  coordination with Commission 51  of  the
     International Astronomical Union, will conduct a continuing
     review of procedures for the detection of  extraterrestrial
     intelligence  and  the  subsequent handling  of  the  data.
     Should  credible evidence of extraterrestrial  intelligence
     be discovered, an international committee of scientists and
     other  experts  should be established to serve as  a  focal
     point for continuing analysis of all observational evidence
     collected  in the aftermath of the discovery, and  also  to
     provide advice on the release of collected in the aftermath
     of the discovery, and also to provide advice on the release
     of  information  to the public.  This committee  should  be
     constituted   from   representatives   of   each   of   the
     international  institutions  listed above  and  such  other
     members as the committee may deem necessary.  To facilitate
     the convocation of such a committee at some unknown time in
     the future, the SETI Committee of the International Academy
     of Astronautics should initiate and maintain a current list
     of  willing representatives from each of the  international
     institutions  listed  above, as well as  other  individuals
     with   relevant   skills,  and  should   make   that   list
     continuously  available  through  the  Secretariat  of  the
     International  Academy of Astronautics.  The  International
     Academy of Astronautics will act as the Depository for this
     declaration  and  will annually provide a current  list  of
     parties to all the parties to this declaration.

    We,  as  a  global  society,  must act  responsibly  in  our
endeavors in this search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

    This  is  only  one  small piece  in  the  overall  picture.
Perhaps  in  our  lifetimes we will discover the  truth  to  this
enigma concerning UFOs and the possible connection they have with
a government-funded search.

    So, the next time you turn on your television or you use the
telephone, ponder this question -- "Is Anybody Out There?"
