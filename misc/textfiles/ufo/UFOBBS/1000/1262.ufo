     Numerous   sightings   of   a   mysterious   aircraft   were
rep[reported  to  DeKalb County law enforcement  officers  Friday
night.
     From  Lickskillet on Lookout Mountain,  to Grove Oak on Sand
Mountain,  calls  started pouring into police departments  around
8:30 p.m. about an object "sometimes hovering above the treetops"
to an object "streaking through the sky."
     The  craft was not only observed by numerous  citizens,  but
several law enforcement officers also reporting it.
     The  first  report  that something was  flying  over  DeKalb
County came around 8:30 p.m.  to the Fyffe Police Department from
a Grove Oak woman.
     The  woman said she had watched the object for over an  hour
through a pair of binoculars.
     The  woman told The Weekly Post that she and her sister were
returning  home from Fyffe when they saw a  low-hovering,  bright
white light just above the treetops.
     The woman,  who asked to remain unidentified, said when they
were within one-half mile of her home,  the object appeared to be
behind her home.
     She  said she then rolled down the windows of her  car,  and
couldn't hear any noise.
     When  she  turned into her driveway,  she  said  the  object
disappeared.
     While  her sister ran into the house to get their  husbands,
the  woman went to a truck parked outside and retrieved a pair of
binoculars to see if she could follow it through the sky.
     She  said she could see the object on the  horizon,  looking
toward Collinsville.
     The  object was not moving,  she said,  and appeared  to  be
shaped "like a banana,  with a red light on each end, and a white
light in a line between them.   The top of the curve was outlined
in green lights."
     The  object  turned,  and  the green lights "looked  like  a
fireworks display," according to the woman.
     After calling the Fyffe Police,  a patrol car was dispatched
to  the  woman's home,  and according to Fyffe  Assistant  Police
Chief  Fred  Works,  when  they  arrived,  the  craft  was  still
hovering,  and  when  they got out of the patrol car and  started
walking toward it, it began moving away.
     The  craft then reversed directions and flew over the  heads
of the surprised officers.
     The  officers  estimated  the craft's altitude at  1,000  to
1,500 feet, but they said they were still able to get a good look
at it.
     One of the officers said it appeared as if the white  lights
underneath  the  craft  were  shining  upward,  illuminating  the
bottom.
     After  disappearing from the Grove Oak area,  the craft  was
spotted   by  an  Alabama  State  Trooper  and  by  officers   in
Crossville, Geraldine and Collinsville.
      A  Lickskillet resident called the DeKalb County  Sheriff's
Department  and said he "shot at the craft as it topped trees  at
his home, with a 12-gauge shotgun."
     An  official  at  the Sheriffs Department said the  man  was
"terrified.   He was about to have a heart attack,  and his  wife
was screaming."
     Officials in Huntsville,  Birmingham,  and Maxwell Air Force
Base in Montgomery were all unable to explain the sightings,  and
a National Weather Service spokesperson said that the description
of the craft "doesn't match any kind of weather balloon we have."
     The  woman that first spotted the craft Friday night saw the
object again Saturday night, in the same area, but said it seemed
to be "further away on the horizon than it was Friday night."
     She called officers at Fyffe again, and the officers came to
her house.
     When they arrived, the craft was gone, but, according to the
woman,  it reappeared,  and she watched it on and off for several
hours.
     According  to authorities,  the craft is still listed as  an
unidentified object.
