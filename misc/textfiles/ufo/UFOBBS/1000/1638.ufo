PART 24



  From the Gulf Breeze Sentinel, May 16, 1991........

  On May 10, 1991, I, Jun-ichi Yaoi and my Japanese film crew arrived in Gulf
Breeze in the hope of documenting the local UFO sightings. NIPON television
network, the largest/oldest commercial broadcasting company of Japan, sponsors
our investigative documentary to be aired as part of the two-hour special
nationwide in Japan.

  Bob Oechsler, a former NASA systems specialist, from WAshington, D.C.,
accompanied us as a consultant to advise and analyse any evidence that we might
be able to capture on film.

  At approximately 11:30 p.m. Bob Oechsler told us that a "red UFO" had been
sighted to the northwest of the Holiday Inn where we were staying. We were
preparing for bed but we quickly got our cameras and set up a "sky watch" near
the hotel swimming pool overlooking the Pensacola Bay.

  Fifteen or twenty minutes passed. Then, out over the water, a bright red
object suddenly appeared. The sky was clear over Gulf Breeze and the Bay, with
most of the rain clouds still visible over Pensacola. What we saw and filmed
was amazing! It was brilliant and I must say, beautiful. As recorded on our 36
to one zoom lens, the UFO moved to the northeast for one minute and twenty
seconds before suddenly winking out and the returning for a few seconds as a
small white ball of light which then also winked out.

  Our film of the UFO clearly shows a circular ring of red "energy" with a
center glowing orange core. It will be further analyzed to identify any
structure. We have interviewed dozens of local witnesses who have taken video
and photos of the UFO but we are particularly impressed with the similarity
with photographs taken by Ed Walters in 1988.
