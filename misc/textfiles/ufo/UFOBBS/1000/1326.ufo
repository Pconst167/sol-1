SUBJECT: MINERAL POINT, PENNSYLVANIA SIGHTING REPORT         FILE: UFO1326


LOG # 891004 - Event 08/26/89, near Mineral Point, Pennsylvania, investigator
Paul Kessler.  At 5 PM, four teenage boys resting from a game of touch football
spotted a shiny object in the sky.  It proceeded closer at moderate speed, then
twice reversed direction, halting momentarily each time.  Fifteen minutes into
the sighting, one of the boys ran home to beckon his parents outside.  They
were joined by several adult neighbors and watched for half an hour until the
object left.  It was described as a metalic sphere, at times displaying an
orange-like coloration and appearing to rotate about a vertical axis.  At it's
closest point, the object had an apparent size of a quarter held at arm's
length.  Actual size was estimated as larger than the jetliner which at one
point passed below the anomaly.
