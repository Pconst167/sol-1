Bright lights hovering over Green Mountain Reservoir and Kremmling...
 
Twenty-plus calls to the Summit County sheriff... 
 
And sightings by the sheriff's department and the police departments
of Dillon and Silverthorne.
 
Science fiction?  Even after seeing them, Kremmling police officer
Scott  Koch would like to believe it is.
 
On Sunday, April 20, a call came into the Kremmling PD from the Summit
County sheriff's department, reporting numerous UFO sightings and
inquiring if any similar calls had been received in Kremmling.
 
Koch, who was on the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift that night, saw stationary,
colored lights in the skies directly over Kremmling.  He then was
informed of sightings near Green Mountain Reservoir, and drove down
Colo. 9 to the county line.
 
There, a large group of law enforcement officers from Grand and Summit
Counties was witnessing something stranger than fiction.  The lights
were viewed over Williams Peak and the Gore, and through a high powered
telescope, the objects looked to be triangular in shape, with lights
on the outer edges.  They were observed to hover, then "take off"
to the southwest.
 
The most startling aspect of the occurrence was the evasive action
of a jet plane, which all present saw veer around one of the objects.
Koch figured they watched for about two hours.
 
Fact? Fiction?  These witnesses were trained ovservers, professional
men who viewed something alien to their natures.

They really don't want to talk about it. 
 
But they don't deny the fact that something truly strange was out
that night.

Area police said aircraft in the skies last night promted several
dozen calls to the Danbury and Brookfield police departments as well
as to state police barracks in Southbury and in Brewster with reports
of UFOs.
 
State police at the Southbury barracks said the crafts were probably
ultra-light aircraft, but a New York sate trooper said they were regular
planes "putting on a show."
 
"They few right over the barracks, it was very impressive," said Trooper
Peter Kontos of the Brewster barracks.  "If you didn't know what it
was, I could see how you would think it was strange."
 
Kontos said the barracks received a half-dozen calls and "a whole
mess of people" who stopped at the barracks to point out the spectacle
to troopers.
 
He said the Stormville, N.Y., barracks notified police about the
aircraft.  He said the pilots throttle the planes' engines to make
it appear they are standing still, and then suddenly take off at a
high speed.
 
The Putnam County Sheriffs' Depatment, Brookfield police and Connecticut
State Police at Troop A said they received a half-dozen calls each
about the planes. Danbury police said they received 20 calls.

Forensics testing UFO evidence
 
Examiners at the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences will be testing
the only evidence of a UFO which fell in Washington County in an effort
to unravel the origin of the object which apparently exploded before
it crashed into a backyard.
 
It left trees and plants broken and damaged, but no clues as to what
it was or what caused it.
 
Mr. Jim Small, a trace evidence examiner with the Forensic Science
lab who specializes in examining evidence from arson and explosions,
said the lab received samples of the damaged plants and trees from
the Washington County Sheriff's Department Wednesday.
 
The first thing that we will look for is some type of explosive residue.
Beyond that, I don't know, Small said.

The explosion, which occured March 5 in the backyard of the Jesse
Wallace Henson family in Frankville, was investigated by Washington
County Sheriff William J. Wheat.  Wheat said he had no idea what caused
it whether it was a land explosion or caused by something that fell
from the sky.
