15. Summary:
1.   This report forwards a narrative written and signed by J. R.
CARLOS  and  concerns his sighting of UFO's 23  April  1967.   It
should  be noted report is submitted as an IR since AFR 80-17  is
not available this station.
COMMENTS  OF  REPORTING  OFFICER:    a.   On  query,  Sr.  Carlos
described   his  portrayal  of  the  zig-zag  area  (on  attached
drawing) as representing his conception of the total path of  one
object which changed direction in rapid succession,  producing an
explosion  or  brilliant flash at each change of  direction.   He
thought also that the phenomenon he observed might have had  some
sort  of  connection  with  SOYUZ I which was  reported  to  have
crashed 24 April.
     b.    Source  became  visibly  agitated  and  excited  while
recounting the story.   He mentioned also that his children  were
pulling  at his elbow to use the binoculars as the two objects he
described  approached one another.   Therefore,  he was unable to
state  whether an actual collision took place or what might  have
transpired.   He knows of no one else besides himself and  family
who might have seen the objects.
     c.   This  report has been delayed in submission to  try  to
ascertain whether there were other observers.  No other observers
have  been  located and no local publicity has been generated  on
the subject.  Source is a responsible citizen, a florist in MIXCO
(1439N/090  36W),  a small town about 5 miles West  of  Guatemala
City  near the Pan American highway.   It should be noted  Source
came  in  of  his own accord after requesting an  appointment  by
phone.   He  first  reported  to the MILGP and  was  referred  to
DATT/AirA.  He was firm about not wanting any publicity as he did
not wish to appear foolish or overly imaginative.  His desire was
simply  to report the incident.   RO feels he seemed  believable;
there  was no joking about the subject and there is no  doubt  in
mind  of  RO that Source saw something [underlined] which was  to
him unnatural or at the very least highly unusual.
TRANSLATION OF WRITTEN NARRATIVE BY J. R. CARLOS
Memorandum  Concerning Phenomenon Observed Sunday,  23 April 1967
At Approximately 8:00 P.M.
     At  approximately  the hour indicated  above,  my  wife  was
watering the flowers in the window boxes of our house; I was near
a bedroom window which she had left open.   She asked me to close
the  window  and when I approached it I was surprised to see  the
sky so clear and full of stars.   At this moment I noticed a star
of  surprising  magnitude;  my surprise was even greater  when  I
observed it was moving from the Southwest to the Northeast.   Its
size  was  greater than Venus in its  most  visible  periods.   I
called  to my children and to my wife;  they saw the star (as  we
will  call  the object) which was moving and had a  very  intense
brilliance,  with  no change of color,  giving off a clear yellow
light with uniform rays.  We ran out to the fields near our house
and I carried binoculars (Zeiss) which are very powerful.
     As I leaned on a fence to control my nerves, I called out to
my  children that I saw a star of a dull red color,  without  the
rays  which normally appear around a star;  it was moving  toward
the  star which had first interested us.   At first I thought  it
was  an optical illusion since the other star wa also  moving  in
the  same direction,  but,  on training the binoculars on the red
star,  I noticed it was increasing in size and therefore must  be
moving.   I  called out to my children to look at the second star
but  found  it was not visible to the eye and it was  also  being
covered by a cloud.  The two stars rapidly approached each other;
both appeared to be at the same altitude or height on horizon but
the red star was moving faster.   On looking again at the area  I
could  only  see  the large star which had somewhat  changed  its
direction,  moving more to the North.  (Larger star is the yellow
star.)  I realized this change of direction later; I did not stop
to  think about it at the time but when I was  reconstructing  my
observations  I remembered it.   I did note at the time that  the
larger   star   was  moving  more  rapidly  but  without   losing
brilliance,  and while I was observing it there was no change  of
color or any flashes.
     The  drawing attached shows the larger star at the moment  I
saw multiple red lines moving from one side to the other,  making
a  kind of zig-zag and,  at the end of some of these lines,  what
appeared to be small rays,  completely rectilinear, forming small
stars of enormous brilliance.   The lines were red and the  small
stars  formed  at the end of the lines were of a  very  brilliant
clear  red color.   At this moment the clouds lifted and my  wife
could see the multiple lights or stars that formed.
     In summary,  this phenomenon seemed to come from one  object
which  moved rapidly from one place to another,  leaving behind a
red  line which faded out with a sort of flash;  it was not  like
the explosions of fireworks in which there are a number of rocket
flashes at the same time.
     I  believe  that  the  two  objects  crashed  together  but,
unfortunately,  I let my children use the binoculars and tried to
direct their vision toward the two stars;  also,  the observation
took  place during some 80 seconds so there was no  time.   I  do
know  that  the larger star was already somewhat out of the  zone
where I saw the explosions when they appeared.   It could be that
there  was  some  delay  in finding the  area  when  my  children
returned  the binoculars,  but when I again located  it,  it  was
difficult  to find as it was moving fast and had somewhat changed
its trajectory.  Signed:  J. R. CARLOS G.  26 April 1967.
