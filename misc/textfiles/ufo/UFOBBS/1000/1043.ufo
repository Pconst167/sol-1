PART 6

GUEST

ALIEN LIFE FORM HELD PRISONER IN AN AREA KNOWN AS THE ICE CAVE AT
LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO. THERE WERE ORIGINALLY 16 CAPTIVE ALIENS HELD
AT THIS LOCATION. 15 HAVE DIED. THE ALIEN "GUESTS" FURNISHED EXTENSIVE
INFORMATION ON THE ALIENS AND THEIR HISTORY WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE
"YELLOW BOOK". THESE "GUESTS" WERE INDEED FED ICE CREAM AND LIKED
STRAWBERRY ABOVE ALL OTHER FLAVORS. THESE ALIENS WERE HELD IN EXCHANGE
FOR 16 HUMANS WHO BECAME "GUESTS" OF THE ALIENS NO INFORMATION REGARDING
THE HUMAN "GUESTS" IS AVAILABLE FROM ANY SOURCE. THE "GUESTS" ENJOY
MUSIC OF A FAR EASTERN NATURE AND ESPECIALLY ENJOY MUSIC WHICH ORIGINATES
FROM TIBET.  THEY POSSESS AN EXTREMELY HIGH IQ WHICH IS IN THE 200
RANGE.  THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO LIE.


RELIGION

THE ALIENS CLAIM THAT MAN IS A HYBRID CREATED BY THEM. THEY CLAIM
THAT ALL RELIGION WAS CREATED BY THEM TO HASTEN THE FORMATION OF A
CIVILIZED CULTURE AND TO CONTROL THE HUMAN RACE. THEY CLAIM THAT JESUS
WAS A PRODUCT OF THEIR EFFORTS. THE ALIENS HAVE FURNISHED PROOF OF
THESE CLAIMS AND HAVE A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SHOW AUDIBLY AND
VISUALLY ANY PART OF HISTORY THAT THEY OR WE WISH TO SEE. THEY CLAIM
THAT O- BLOOD IS THE PROOF OF HYBRIDIZATION AND OUR OWN SCIENCE TENDS
TO BEAR OUT THEIR CLAIM.


The confusion over the location of the alien base has prompted me
to write this file.

My sources are terrified of revealing the location.  I do not know
why they are so afraid of revealing this information.  I do not want
anyone to go near the place because they may be subject to injury.

I know that the main base is in New Mexico.  There are may be two
small alien detachments.  One at DREAMLAND and one at AREA 51.  Both
of these locations are used to test fly alien craft.  The main location
for test flights is at AREA 51. The aliens are helping us with the
flights and with the craft technology and there is at least a small
detachment at those locations

Excalibur is being developed to penetrate ground such as that found
in New Mexico.  Paul Bennewicz swore that the base is in New Mexico.
John Lear's sources state that the base is in New Mexico.  My sources
originally told me that the base was in New Mexico.  The information
that I read with my own eyes stated that the base is in New Mexico.
My sources panicked when I told them that I was posting the information
on a public forum.  Because I do not wish anyone to be injured while
trying to "get a look" I will not reveal the exact location except
that it is located in the state of New Mexico.

On this subject I believe that MAJIC2.TXT and MAJIC3.TXT are both
correct and I add AREA 51

The information concerning The FAR SIDE OF THE MOON is bad in MAJIC2.TXT
but is correct in MAJIC3.TXT.  I hope that this file clears up the
issue.
