     A deighley UGO investigator is looking into a Steeton woman's sighting of lights in the sky above the Aire Valley.
     David Atkinson, who works with the Yorkshire UFO Society, will interview her to discover what she saw.
     The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, claims she saw an object aboveKeighley at 11:30pm.
     The lisht, similar to the bottom half of the moon but a different colour, gradually receded and disappeared.
     Later the woman saw five small dots of light in the same place grow bigger until they merged into a cigar-shaped object.
     Mr. Atkinson will contact the woman and ask her special questions designed to get a true picture of the sighting.
     Anyone who has seen strange lights in the sky recently should phone him on Keighley 680104.
