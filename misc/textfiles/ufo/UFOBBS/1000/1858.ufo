     A friend of mine the other day from the Atlanta area informed me that the
one and only Bill Cooper had made a recent appearence on an Atlanta Radio show
and held a symposium dedicated to Mr. Cooper's favorite subject: MJ-12 and
the government coverup of UFO's.
     During this symposium, he tied the Kennedy assignation into the US govern-
ment UFO coverup. He showed the now famous tape depicting the driver of the
car turning and apparently firing on Kennedy.
     Cooper states that the reason Kennedy was shot was because he was about
to reveal the existance of the US Government UFO coverup. This was first
brought up in Mr. Cooper's MUFON address on July 3,1989 in Las Vegus. Mr.
Cooper seems to have "toned down" his other more interesting statements, 
including those that claim "The US and the USSR have joint bases operating
on the darkside of the moon" or my personall favorite "The surface of Venus
is quite habitable, the various US and USSR probes data has been falsified to
mislead the public."
     Still, to this date Mr. Cooper has not offered one shred of documentated
evidence to support any of his claims, he still claims to have "Secret Inform-
ants" etc. who pass him information. I for one will not hold my breath waiting
for Mr. Cooper to come forward with hard evidence.
     If you agree with Mr. Bill on his outlandish ideas he will treat you like
a long lost friend. Of course, if you happen to disagree with his "Theories"
he throws a tantrum much like that of a three year old.
     My personal opinion of "Mr. Bill" is that of a raving paranoid maniac
who has done nothing but upset the UFO community. The one thing that does
surprise me is the fact that the general public would pay money to see this
total fraud and charlatan.
     Where is Mr. Sluggo when you need him.
