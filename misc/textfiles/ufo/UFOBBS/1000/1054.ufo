PART 11

It was the same color and texture of the large portion, so it
was safe to assume that it was part of the shell of the
craft.  It weighed nowhere near enough to be any metal that
we had ever seen.  It even weighed less than any plastic that
I had seen of a similar size.

I tried to scratch it with a pocket knife, and even cut away
a small piece of the edge, but the knife did nothing to it.
The surface was clear as glass, and stronger than anything we
had ever seen.  It was like trying to scratch the surface of
glass with a feather.  Of course, we had to turn it into the
security people.

After the site was secure, the first groups that included
myself were taken away.  There was a very thorough strip
search prior to us being given jumpsuits, and put into a
truck for the transportation to a waiting plane.  We were
taken to another area and debriefed before we were allowed to
return to our normal way of life.

About three months later, a few of us returned to the site to
remove the buildings, fill up the hole, and generally put
the area back into the same shape as it may have been prior
to the crash.  We went through the same type of security
search and debriefing as we had done the first time.
Whatever was left of the craft had been removed and sent to -
unknown-.

Almost one year to the day, I was sent to another crash site.
Everything was a repeat of the first time, except that there
were six of us.  Four of us were part of the first crash
site, and the other two were new.  This time the air craft
was buried so deep into the lower side of a hill that we
could not get a good look at it.

The security arrangements were just about the same, and we
constructed similar buildings around it.  It was very close
to a rerun of the first crash site.  Only this time we were
told, "as a matter of fact it was a top secret experimental
air craft that had crashed".  I could however, manage to see
the rear end of the craft.  It appeared to be the same type
as the first.  The code name of the project was Pluto, as it
was the first also.  Incidently, that was in upstate New
York, in 1976.  I do not know if there were any "people" or
life forms aboard.

Several years later, I had an occasion to be in the area of
site #one.  The bartender only recognized me because he
brought in our first room service the first night we stayed
there.  There was no room service there, but he made his one
and only exception to the rule for us.  He asked me lots of
questions which of course had no answers for, nor would I
give any.  He told me that he heard that there were lots of
medical people on the site.  He thought that rather odd for
an electric power station.  He assumed that there must have
been some kind of an accident, or lots of waste material in
the area.  We let it go at that.

It appears that security was very good, and no one had any
idea that an air craft had crashed there.  I suspect that the
air craft was fifty feet in diameter and as long as two
hundred feet.  I could be wrong in the length.  As I recall
the under portion of air craft #one had more of a flat
surface.  It was difficult to see, but I do recall the
difference in the portion of the under surface that I could
see.

There were also a few interesting grooves on the top and side
areas about twenty feet long.  We had speculated that either
a steering fin had been attached, or a place where it could
slide through from the inside, similar to the type of
system used to lower wheels on any air craft.  First
speculation!

In 1978, I was again sent to a crash site.  We arrived the
day after the security people.  This time the air craft
landed in a lake in upstate Pennsylvannia.  We went through
the same motions, and built several buildings on the edge of
the lake to house the craft, once it was removed from the
water.  Lots of Navy equipment was flown in, and there were
divers everywhere.  The same magnetic field was present as in
the first two incidents.  There was no air craft.

I spent three weeks there in the event that the buildings had
to be adjusted.  It seems that the divers had located the
exact spot that the air craft had rested on the bottom, but
it was gone.  There was lots of evidence on the beach that
something very large had crashed into the lake causing the
water of the lake to splash ashore, over thirty feet, and
what was normally a rather clean lake, was suddenly a very
large mudhole.  After three weeks, I left and was subjected
to the same type of security as the first two times.

I didn't have to return to dismantle the pre-fab buildings.
I would think that it was done by others very soon there
after.  There was some thoughts at first that the craft may
have been buried under the bottom of the lake, but by this
time, we knew enough about the craft to know if that were the
case.  It was not - it just vanished.  Perhaps it was not
damaged and managed to fly away.  That may sound silly, but I
believe that it is a reasonable conclusion.  There was some
damage to the immediate area.  Six large electrical
transformers, and some other equipment were burnt out and had
to be replaced by the electric company.  The government took
the electrical equipment and had it flown somewhere else.
