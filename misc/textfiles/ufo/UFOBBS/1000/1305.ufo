Log # 890407 - Event 11/10-20/87 (exact date undetermined), dusk, Pensacola,
FL: duration 3 minutes.  Lead investigator Vicki Lyons.  A couple noticed a
disc-shaped object hovering near treetop level while driving.  Slowing but
not stopping, they kept it in view for over two miles.  Later, having become
aware of the original Gulf Breeze photos, the man declared, "There's no doubt
in my mind then or now that what we saw was exactly what was photographed on
November 11 in Gulf Breeze."
