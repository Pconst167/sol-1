Even if cat scans are spaced at 5mm, you have a 50-50 chance that on  any
single cat scan you will hit the 3mm sphere.  I'm not all that familiar with
cat scans, but I strongly suspect that the normal 5mm spacing could be reduced
if there was some reason to but just taking multiple scans would almost assure
taht one would find the 3mm sphere if there was one.  I don't doubt that Bub
wants a "better way" to find thlem since the current methods somehow "miss"
them.

Sure copies would be nice.  Actually, if you have that lmuch stuff, why not
edit it down into a coherent documentary?  Does any of it stand on its own or
must it all be taken together to synthesize the big picture?  How much is
antecdotal as opposed to factual or physical?

Most people don't have Cat scans of their head unless their doctor is looking
for something.  I think it is fairly safe to assume thatýé if the Dr. saw a
mysterious 3mm dot he þòwould want to know what it was.

Perhaps X-rays and CAT scans MAY miss these devices... But I don't think a MRI
scan would... This may be worth investigating...

MRI is the new name given to the technique called Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance... The AMA didn't like the term "Nuclear", so they renamed the
technigue to MRI - Magnetic Resonance Imaging...

If it is the device I think it is, you must remove all metal object before
being "installed" in the machine.  It would quite pemanently ruin a watch due
to the high magnetic fields.  I think it would find the 3mm sphere's but of
course if it didn't then we would be told that was because the EBE's made them
out of something that has the same properties as brain matter so it won't show
up.  There is always ar reason why they can't find them, but it is never
because they aren't there.

Actually, the nuclei of many atoms posses angular momentun (spin) and
nonvanishing magnetic moments. The former may be characterized by an angular
momentum quantum number I (integer or half interger) of the nuclear particles.
As far as is known, stable nuclei with an even number of nuetrons and even
number of protons have zero spin and magnetic moment, hence are incapable of
exhibiting magnetic resonance. Thus NMR may be observed in insulators, metals,
paramagnetic salts, antiferromagnetic substances and other solids, liquids,
gases.

So then I assume MRI could find these "alien brain balls" without too much
difficulty...unless of course 3M developed the MRI machines, and conveniently
placed some sort of safety feature that "ignored" small spheres secretly
planted in the brain...

As a matter of fact, the company that I work for North American Philips is ONE

is no "safety" feature of the type you describe...

Ah, but what the designers don't (and can't) realize is that the EBEs
implanted devices in their brains to prevent them from designing an MRI
machine capable of detecting the implanted objects. It's all quite simple when
you think about it.

In short, a phenomena exhibited by the magnetic spin systems of certain atoms
whereby the spin systems absorb energy at specific (resonant) frequencies when
subjected to alternating magnetic fields in referred to as Magnetic
Resonance... These resonant frequencies can be detected and processed into an
image for diagnostic use. With MRI, we are NOT restricted by the location of a
"foreign" body under examination...Or the composition for that matter...

I know, I've seen some of the things that they can do with this sucker. 
Imagine being able to not only see a tumor for where it is, but to see it
alone, in 3 dimensions (spinning and rotating, and all that) from any angle. 
Or to see a skull fracture as it looks from inside the skull, including any
shards of bone in the brain.  We're talking Star Trek here!

John;
    I found your statement intriguing to say the least. It would seem that
your credibility is quite solid, yet I feel a certain hesitatency about
certain statements. And others I feel are mere pooh! As an ex-Air Force
Officer, I find it rather incredulous to think that an unknown object could
land at an AFB without a near riot occurring... And for ET to "walk" up to the
Wing Commander... Well I just can't buy this... I still wonder about why the
EBE's are letting you talk.

Like many of those responding you obviously know very little about what you
speak.  Bentwaters was one of the best documented UFO with Aliens debarking
incidents that the public is aware of. As an ex-Air Force Officer you would be
the least qualified to talk about UFO's on a network such as this if for no
other reason than JANAP 146. If you can find Gen. Gordon Williams ( I have) go
talk to him.  He is the one that the aliens went up to. Or you can talk to Col
Charles I. Halt (he wrote the memo to the British) or how about Col Ted Conrad
or how about Maj. Greg Williams or how about AF Security policeman Larry
Warren or how about AFSP Adrian Buztinsa.   ¨QÂ^’Ó¦N$Dae  ·ÄÚÈZwÃ•õ Just tell
me how many of these guys you have personally interviewed to make the
statements you have.  John

Yes.  I have pretty much dropped out of this discussion for that reason. Sort
of like trying to argue with JW's (Jehovah's Witnesses).  They have their
minds firmly made up, you can't speak logically with them -- and then they
tell you you're narrow minded (or stupid, or worship the devil, etc.).  Not
worth it, really. heheheheheh

It may be true (it could happen) that some alien probe found its way here and
crashed in Roswell NM.  It could also be true that our government retrieved it
and covered it up.  I don't find that assertion too hard to swallow.  We sent
out a number of probes and I beleive a few were specifically intended to be
"greeting cards" in the event they ever make it to some other inhabited
planet.  It doesn't seem reall likely, but it is possible and one might even
say reasonable.  Now to take that and expand it to the whole alien invasion
thing, that requires almost a complete suspension of all disbelief and reason.
 That doesn't mean it isn't true, but it would require more "proof" then has
been forthcoming so far.

Exactly my thoughts.  No disrespect intended to John Lear, but I've seen
claims of this sort before (they go back to the fifties), and although almost
all have had statements regarding evidence, none of it has ever come forth.
 I think that one explanation for UFOs to be taken seriously is alien life;
and in that respect, it is conceivable that one has crashed, and we could have
recovered it and kept that secret.  However, the rest of the story requires
far more than anyone's word.  It requires absolute proof.

I do not see why you or anyone for that matter thinks that the media are
somehow remiss in their coverage of UFO topics.  Every time they provide any
serious coverage they are presented with nothing but antecdotes, vague
allegations, blurry photos, etc.  I'm suprised they give it any coverage. They
still have some desire to maintain their credibility and reporting the typical
unbeleiveable, undocumented UFO story would hardly bolster the low opinion
many people have of the media anyways.  It seems you want it both ways, you
don't seem to think much of the media, but you want them tho cover your story
your way when you want it.

You're wrong, Jim. They have been presented with government documents which
show a clear intent to hide something from the American public. What that
something is may very well be quite mundane, but then why hide it for forty
years?

We don't want them to report the typical, unbelievable, undocumented UFO
story. But when we present them with an atypical, unique, well-documented
report from numerous credible witnesses with multiple independent photographs,
we not only want coverage, we want an in-depth investigation. That's their
job.
