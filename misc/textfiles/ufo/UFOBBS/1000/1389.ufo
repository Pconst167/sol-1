From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, July 2, 1947

              ANOTHER MAN SAYS HE SAW "SKY SAUCERS"

Portland, Ore., July 2. Richard Rankin, Palm Springs, California,
pilot, reports he saw 10 "flying saucers" over Bakersfield,
California, June 23.

   "These planes were maybe 9,000 feet up and fairly fast, maybe
300 or 400 miles an hour," Rankin said yesterday.

   "I first counted 10 of them in formation, going north. About
2:15 p.m. they returned on the reverse course, headed south, but
there were only 7 in the formation.

   "I couldn't make out the number or location of their propellers
and couldn't distinguish any wings at all. They appeared almost
round. They looked just like pictures of the Navy's Flying
Flapjack."

   Rankin said he hesitated to report what he saw until he read
that others had sighted the "saucers".

   The navy has reported it's "Flying Flapjack" plane has never
left Connecticut.

   Rankin, former Portland flyer with more than 7,000 hours
in the air, is a brother of the late Tex Rankin, stunt pilot.
