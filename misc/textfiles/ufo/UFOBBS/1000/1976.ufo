------------------------------------------------
In the new issue of UFO Magazine, I have written an update on the investigation 
of what appear to be more mutilations involving humans.

During the November 1989 Omega conference hosted by John White, Whitley 
Strieber castigated UFO Magazine for running my story on human mutilations in 
Vol. 4 Number 3.  In that news story, I related the results of an investigation 
I was conducting on what appeared to be a series of human deaths that greatly 
resembled animal mutilations.  Also, I included a report from Wm. "Bill" Knell 
of the Long Island Skywatch organazation.  Knell had been conducting research 
into an inordinate number of missing children in the area of Westchester 
County.  According to Strieber, he had received "hundreds" of phone calls from 
concerned citizens about the story.  ( That in itself is suspect, as anyone 
knows who has ever tried to call Strieber.  Strieber has an answering service 
or secretary that screens each call, takes a message and then Whitley decides 
on whom he will speak with. )  Anyway, I digress. Knell has many police 
contacts, and after checking with them, there were no contacts from Whitley.  ( 
One could surmise that what really had Whit in a snit was the way the print 
media had lambasted his flick, Communion, and his recent books, such as 
Majestic. He had just called all journalists - prostitutes. )

According to Knell and officers from the New York State Police, and the 
Connecticut State Police, the reported figures were in no way accurate, but the 
weirdest happening was when Knell received an inquiry from an Asst. Medical 
Examiner from Westchester County.  The Asst. ME wanted to know everything Knell 
could relate on humans that had been mutilated.  When Knell pursued this, it 
turned out that 3 morgues ( 2 in New York, 1 in Connecticut ) had been "hit" in 
the middle of the night.  Newly arrived human cadavers had been mutilated by 
removal of face, genitals, eyes, parts from the stomic, rectum, thyroids, etc. 
The morgues were immediately investigated by the police, but nothing could be 
placed on the employees.  There were reduced staff at that time of night, and 
the events occured in different areas.  High strangeness indeed.  According to 
the Asst. ME, the incidents were immediately concealed from the media and 
public. More than likely the reasons were that there was no explanation, nor 
were the incidents going to be solved in the near future.  As an aside, there 
were also quite a few animal mutilations that were occuring in New York and 
Connecticut, and once again no solutions were forthcoming for these events.

The Satanic explanation was examined, and according to the reporting witness, 
did not hold water.

Any ideas from the membership?  Needless to say, the investigation is ongoing.
