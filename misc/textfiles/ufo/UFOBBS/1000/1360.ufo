SPECIAL RELEASE: 2nd Alaska UFO Sighting

CUFON  01/12

Another Japanese Airlines crew has reported seeing an Unidentified Flying
Object ( UFO ) over Alaska, according to the FAA.

In a recorded announcement, Paul Steucke, Senior Federal Aviation
Administrator for the Alaska District, said that on January 11th at
approximately 7:35 AM,  Capt. Kinju Teryaki, piloting a JAL 747 cargo plane
from Europe to Anchorage, reported to the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Certer
(ARTCC) that he saw irregular lights that "looked like a spaceship".

The lights were, he said, "amber and white, and travelled from in front of him
to below him, and disappeared behind him."

The sighting was in two segments, the first for about 20 minutes, and the
second occured a little later for approximately 10 minutes.  Unlike the
November 17th sighting reported by another JAL cargo jet, there was no radar
contact by either ground or air-based facilities, "Steucke said".

The FAA began interviewing both the captain and co-pilot upon their landing at
Anchorage, he said.  Steucke made the recording as an alternative to answering
an unmanageable volume of phone calls,which have been pouring into the Alaska
FAA district since the November 17th sighting was made public on January 1st.
According to Steucke,the data from that sighting , voice recorder transcripts,
radar tapes and interviews, are being sent to the FAA headquarters in
Washington DC as are the data from the January 11th sighting.

"The Federal Aviation Administration is not in the business of looking for or
identifying UFO's", he said.  "We are involved in investigating these reports
because the lights violated our federal regulations, as humorous , as that may
sound."

Steucke's recording will be heard in its entirety tonight on KFYI AM  910,
Phoenix, Arizona on the John Giese show , beginning at 1am.  Giese will then
interview Seattle Ufologist Dale Goudie, who is involved in the JAL UFO
investigation.  Mr. goudie will also be on CBS once again this friday night on
CBS Nightwatch Jan 16/1987 concerning iboth sighting of the japanese
airliners.
