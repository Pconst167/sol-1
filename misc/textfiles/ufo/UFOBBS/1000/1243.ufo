        SUBJECT: BIBLE'S UFO CONNECTION                      FILE: UFO1243


        Many scholars and scientists claim that variety of references in the 
        Bible, expecially in Genesis, prove the UFOs influenced human 
        development and that modern man may even have descended from aliens 
        mating with humans.

        Fuyval Abrams, and Israeli scholar, even believes that Adam and Eve 
        were space travelers who crash landed on Earth, and the the Garden of 
        Eden was actually a space ship.

        There were others on the spaceship, but when it crashed they spread 
        out to other parts of the world, he says.

        These aliens mated with primitive humans who were already on earth, 
        Abrams adds.

        The Bible mentions the sons of God - aliens - mating with the 
        daughters of men - humans. Helmut Roche, a French astrophysicist and 
        biblical expert, claims humans did not develop on earth but came from 
        another planet to colonize Earth.

        References to UFOs and aliens are common in the Bible, he argues.

        These include Enoch ascending to heaven on a fiery pillar and Ezekiel 
        leaving earth in a blazing chariot.

        Roche says Sodom and Gomorra were destroyed by a nuclear bomb and the 
        cloud of fire that led the Israelites during their 40 years int 
        ehdesert was a UFO.

        He believes the mysterious and fearsome Ark of the Covenant which 
        destroyed the Israelites enemies with lightening and fire was in fact 
        an alien ray gun, with a mighty powerful blast.

        SUBJECT: WHAT HAPPENED TO ADAM AND EVE?

        According to the Bible, Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of 
        Eden for disobeying God were forced to work for their daily bread. 
        They also lost the gift of eternal life and were no longer allowed to 
        mingle with angels.

        They apparently settled on the east side of the Garden, not far from 
        the entrance, which was guarded by an angel with a flaming sword.

        Like Israeli scholar Fuyval Abrams, Dr. Brain Barnes, a British 
        expert, believes Adam and Eve were aliens and the Garden of Eden was a 
        spaceship.

        The craft provided Adam and Eve with food, which it produced 
        synthetically and protected them from the harshness of Earth's 
        environment, he explains.

        But after years aboard the ship waiting to be rescued, its machines 
        broke down and Adam and Eve were forced to leave it and live among 
        primitive humans in the area.

        The sons and daughters of adam and Eve eventually mated with these 
        primitive humans and produced children, who became our forefathers.

        Throughout their long lives, Barnes says, Adam and Eve probably never 
        went far from the disabled UFO in case a rescue partyh came for them.

        Others, like archeologist Neal Hogan, agree with Helmut Roche's 
        colomial theory and say Adam and Eve were eventually taken back 
        to their home planet, leaving behind their children and grandchildren.

        Adam and Eve and their children literally lived hundreds of years 
        because they were aliens, says Hogan. But the hybrids, off spring of 
        the aliens and primitive humans like Abraham, lived much shorter 
        lives.
