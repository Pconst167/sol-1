Jim:
And the candle:  Does it melt and the flame stand still in
this DISK that you're talking about?

Lazar:
Well, in the AREA, yeah.

Jim:
You don't have to put it in the center?

Lazar:
Right.

Jim:
Just anywhere in the area?

Lazar:
Well, the actual flame of the candle WAS in the area --
in the center of the disk.

Jim:
And you saw this happen?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Goodman:
You don't show much emotion.

Lazar:
Maybe that's my nature, but that's what happens after ten
o'clock if I'm sitting in one place.

Goodman:
I'm not being derogatory about it.  I'm just saying it
seems like there's no emotion.  Some of this stuff that
you're talking about just gives me chills!

We get mail from people at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and
McDonnell Douglas.  Would you like to work for people
like that?

Lazar:
I don't know.  I'm kind of used to working for myself.  I
don't know about going to work for . . . especially anything
attached to the Government again, [look with] distrust . . .

Goodman:
Off the air, I asked what would you like to see for the future
and what could you do for humanity?  He said we could talk about
that, but the main concern right now is how he can support
himself, and I didn't realize you were having difficulty as far
as that.

Lazar:
Oh no, not really difficulty, but it's something always
to look for.

Goodman:
How could anyone in our listening audience assist you?

Lazar:
Oh, they really can't.  There's several things I did
before I began to get into the program up there.  I used
to race my jet car.  I'll probably start that up again
this season and expand my scientific business, United Nuclear.
I'll probably increase that into a sales field and things
like that.

Goodman:
Okay, I just thought we could bring that up just in
case there was someone out there that could use your
services.  What service do you offer, if someone out
there could use it?

Lazar:
Someone would have to be fooling around with plutonium,
and there aren't many people that do that.

Goodman:
Don't bet on that.  You never know.

Caller:
Was the craft you worked on one that WE made or was it
one that was brought here by the aliens from another
planet?

Lazar:
This is a craft of alien origin.

Caller:
That was brought here BY them from another planet?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
Do we know anything about their way of life?  Do they
speak the same language or what?

Lazar:
I really don't know.  I really know very little about
that.  I'd LIKE to know a lot about that.  You assume
that they mass-produce the craft, so there must be
some sort of factory somewhere.  That means there must
be workers in the factory.  Do they have a social life?
I mean, the questions are endless.  I'd like to know
myself.

Caller:
And if they are here on this planet, WHERE are they?

Lazar:
That's another good question.  You got me.  I really
don't know.

Caller:
If one walked up to my door, what am I supposed to do?

Lazar:
I don't know.  I guess you'll find out really quick if
they're benevolent or not.  But as far as what to
do, who knows?

Goodman:
Say you're up in Kansas out in a farmland and you see
this person that looks really far-out, do you think
they're just going to wait for them to come to the
door or do you think they're going to shoot and ask
questions later?

Lazar:
Probably shoot and ask questions later --

Goodman:
That's the problem.  Wouldn't that cause all kinds
of consternation amongst these people if they find
out one of their people were --

Lazar:
Well, you have all the stories of the abductee
reports, about medical examinations; I mean they go
through a lot of trauma and stuff like that.  When it
came right down to it, if I was confronted by a bunch
of them -- my car stopped or something to that effect,
a craft obviously in sight -- yeah, I'd take on
a hostile attitude really quickly.

Goodman:
Unless you were told differently --

Lazar:
Right.

Goodman:
-- by the Government:  these people don't mean to harm
you; they're going to be landing in your cities, whatever;
just [kinda act friendly.]

<...Continued from previous message>

Caller:
Do you think in the future our President will tell us
on national television that the UFOs are here, that he
will make it known to us?

Lazar:
I doubt it.

Caller:
You don't think he ever will?

Lazar:
No, I don't think he could muster up enough to do that.

Caller:
One of the presidents in the past was supposed to say
that if he was elected he was going to tell us all about
it, but he didn't.

Lazar:
Carter.  That tells you something right there, because
he never got in and denied it.  He just got in and didn't
say anything.

New caller:
Did you have a badge when you went to work?

Lazar:
Sure did.

Caller:
Did it have any designation on it?

Lazar:
As far as what?

Caller:
What did it say?

Lazar:
It's a white badge.  It has two -- a light blue and a
dark blue -- diagonal stripes through it.  On the top
it says MAJ-12.  The clearance level is called
MAJESTIC; I don't know if that was, like I said before
I don't know if that means anything as far as the
MAJESTIC-12 documents go, or if they just called that
clearance that as a nostalgia type of thing.  My picture
was on it -- what else was on it . . .

Caller:
Did it have both MAJ and MAJESTIC -- both words?

Lazar:
The only place I ever saw MAJESTIC was on Dennis's
[Mariano] badge, who was my supervisor, and his badge
looks slightly different.  I don't know if it was an
older kind or what.

Caller:
You mentioned you were doing back-engineering, but
specifically, what was the breakdown of your duties,
for example, for one day, with respect to, say, what
your co-workers were doing?  What was the breakdown,
the division of tasks?

Lazar:
I have no knowledge of what the other people were doing.

Caller:
But you were not working simply by yourself.

Lazar:
No, just with one person.

Caller:
And what was the difference between what you did and
what he did?

Lazar:
Well, we were basically in the training phase.  He was
getting me up to date on everything, so we never split
off, and you know, he went and did his thing, and I --

Caller:
Did you ever see an analysis or spectrogram of 115?

Lazar:
Yes.

Caller:
And what did that tell you?

Lazar:
Well, that it was an unknown element.  Then we did density
and weight calculations, which are pretty basic, and of
course it was too heavy for its physical size.  It was
an X-Ray spectrograph.  I don't remember what other
tests we did to it.

Caller:
How did you know what the times of testing would be to
go up to the sites to view the object.  And do you know
where it's being tested now?

Lazar:
Dennis told me the testing times.  And of course those
were the times that I relayed to other people, and we
went out there.  What was the other question?

Caller:
Do you know where it's being tested now?

Lazar:
Oh, I have no idea. In fact, if I was them, the last
place I would test them would be S-4.

Another Caller:
Are you familiar with Alnico 5 magnetic material we
use here?

Lazar:
Yeah, it's a common -- I never heard the 5
designation.

Caller:
It's a very dense magnet.  Is that close to the
material of 115?

Lazar:
Oh no, not at all.  That's an acronym for aluminum,
nickel, iron, and cobalt, none of them being anywhere
near it whatsoever.

Caller:
Are there portholes on that craft?

Lazar:
At the very top, there is portholes; they are square,
though.

Caller:
But they must be able to see by TV or. . .?

Lazar:
I don't know.  I just saw from the outside.  When I was
inside, I never -- I don't think I really even bothered
to look up there; I don't recall.

Caller:
With the gravity generators running, is there thermal
radiation?

Lazar:
No, not at all.  I was never down on the bottom WHILE
the gravity generators were running, but the reactor
itself -- there's no thermal radiation whatsoever.  That
was one of the really shocking things because that
violates the first law of thermodynamics.

Caller:
The atomic weight of the 115 material:  Is that heavier?
We know the 115 atomic weight would be different from the
gravitational weight.  Is the gravitational weight of
that material very heavy?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
How does that stuff break off?  Do you saw it or does it
grind up.  How do you get to test grams or whatever it is?

Lazar:
I don't know.  I really don't know how that's machined into
it.  I know it is machined, but I don't know if there's
any special procedures employed.

Caller:
Does it melt?

<...Continued from previous message>

Lazar:
I'm sure it does.  And just historically, all heavy elements
are also toxic.  I imagine it is a very toxic thing.  What
else?  If you use the standard designations as started at
103, its name would be "unuspentium [sp?]." Its symbol --
if it's going to be plugged into the periodic chart -- would
be UUP.  In fact. I have a friend that gave it kind of a cute
name; he calls it "unobtainium."

Caller:
In your wildest dreams, do you think you would be able to
create any of this stuff on earth -- in order to do the same
thing?

Lazar:
In fact, I'm in the process of fabricating the gravity
amplifier, but then I'm at a tremendous shortage for power.
So yeah, I have even tried to do that stuff on my own.

Caller:
Is there any electronics as we know it -- chips or
transitors?

Lazar:
No, nothing like that.  Because of the tremendous power
involved, too, there was no direct connection between
the gravity amplifiers and the reactor itself.

Caller:
Are the wave guides similar to what we use with
microwaves?

Lazar:
Very similar.

Goodman:
You mentioned all heavy metals are toxic?

Lazar:
Yeah, they seem to be.  Lead, radium, plutonium . . .

Goodman:
Element 115?

Lazar:
You would just assume it would be toxic.

Caller:
Is Sector 4 also called Papoose Dry Lake Bed?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
Is it also in a place called Emigrant Valley?

Lazar:
Right.  You can see Papoose Dry Lake from out of the
hangar doors.

Caller:
In regard to the long-range method of travel, isn't
a propulsion unit the wrong idea?  I feel this device
is creating a situation where it is diminishing or removing
the localized gravitational field, and long-distance body
that they're heading toward is actually PULLING the vehicle
rather than it being pushed.  Am I correct in this?

Lazar:
The vehicle is not being pushed.  But being pulled implies
it's being pulled by something externally:  it's pulling
something else to IT.  IT's creating the gravitational
field.

Caller:
Is there any relation to the monopoles which [scientists]
have been looking for?

Lazar:
Well, they've been looking for the monopole magnet.
But then this [the UFO force] is a gravitational force.

Caller:
Different things but exhibiting similar effects?

Lazar:
Right.

Caller:
Last night I saw a four-door Japanese car.  On the
right-side, rear, passenger door there were three
9mm bullet holes, about a 12-inch group.  Is that
the vehicle that was shot at?

Lazar:
No.  That's similar to my car, but they missed me.

New Caller:
Do we give something in exchange for all this information
they're giving us?

Lazar:
I really don't know.  I don't know what went on behind
the scenes as far as how we got the technology.

Caller:
Did they give us the 115 in large quantities?

Lazar:
Yeah, 500 pounds is what I'm told.  The way I've
seen it, it comes in little thin disks close to the
size of a half dollar.

Caller:
Did you ever own any, or -- ?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
What happened to it?

Lazar:
It's gone.  It was stolen out of my house along with
some other stuff that I got from there.

Caller:
[By] the Government?

Lazar:
That's what I assume; I HOPE it's in their hands;
I'd hate it to be in . . .  A few people did know
about it -- some UFO-related people -- and I'd hate
for unexperienced people to be in possession of
the stuff.

But yeah, that was taken.  We did get some film of
it and some film of it doing some really unusual
things.

Caller:
How did you get hired at Area 51?

<...Continued from previous message>

Lazar:
I was referred by a well-known physicist to talk to
someone.  And I really don't want to go all into that
because then I'm pointing fingers at specific people.

Caller:
Were everyone's mouths shut where you worked?

Lazar:
Yeah, everyone wouldn't let you talk, and it wasn't a
really happy environment.  Everyone was just into what
they were doing and that was it.

New Caller:
What year were you working up there?

Lazar:
Last year.

Caller:
I heard from someone I know that's a pretty good
source that a small amount of plutonium, like a picogram,
might be good for you.  Is that true?

Lazar:
No, not at all.

Goodman:
What would you use plutonium for?

Lazar:
To die.  In the lungs, it's almost immediate lung cancer.
It's toxic in itself.  The body has a tough time getting
rid of it.  It's just bad news.

Goodman:
And you're messing with it.

Lazar:
I don't have any at my house.

Goodman:
You said that's part of what you're working on.

Lazar:
Electronic equipment to detect plutonium:  They're
called alpha radiation detectors or air proportional
detectors.

Goodman:
Why do you want to detect the plutonium?

Lazar:
They use them to screen personnel that are leaving an
area that's been plutonium contaminated; they check
equipment for plutonium contamination; so on and so
forth.

Goodman:
This is as bad as radiation?

Lazar:
Plutonium does produce radiation.

Goodman:
So it's as bad as when they've been clearing the people
in nuclear power plants and stuff like this?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Goodman:
And you're devising a device that's going to be
easier?

Lazar:
No, our device is just less expensive.

Caller:
Can you list your credentials?

Lazar:
As far as what?

Caller:
Schooling, degrees.

Lazar:
I have two masters degrees; one's in physics; one's in
electronics.  I wrote my thesis on MHD, which is
magnetohydrodynamics.

I worked at Los Alamos for a few years as a technician
and then as a physicist in the Polarized Proton Section,
dealing with the accelerator there.

I was hired at S-4 as a senior staff physicist to work on
gravitational propulsion systems and whatnot associated with
those crafts.

Caller:
What school did you go to?

Lazar:
I'd rather not say, the reason being I am currently
working with them under contract, and I'm having enough trouble
with this as it is.

Caller:
Why did you leave the Groom Lake project?

Lazar:
I don't want to go into that either.  That's a big,
long complicated story.  It gets into my personal life,
too, and I don't want to get into that.

Caller:
Have there been any attempts made on your life?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
When was the last one?

Lazar:
There was only one direct one.  I really don't remember
when that was, maybe six, eight months ago, something like
that.  Just being shot at getting out on the freeway.

Caller:
Did another car drive by and shoot you?

<...Continued from previous message>

Lazar:
Yeah.

Caller:
Are there any weapons on board the alien craft?

Lazar:
Not that I know of.  Of course, the gravity generators
themselves can be focused, and I imagine that can be
used as a weapon.

Caller:
How many alien people do they hold?

Lazar:
I don't know.  How many people can you fit in a car?
I imagine if there's a bunch standing up, you can pack
them in there.

Caller:
Is Element 115 an extraterrestrial material?

Lazar:
Yes, definitely.

Caller:
How do you suppose the S-4 project came to acquire
500 pounds if it's not from this world?

Lazar:
I would imagine it came on one of the craft.

Caller:
Extra fuel, huh?

Lazar:
Maybe.

Caller:
How close can a civilian get to Area 51 or Emigrant
Valley?  What is security like?  How many guards and
so forth?

Lazar:
I think the closest you can get is probably about 10 miles,
and then you get a mountain between you and them.

Caller:
A lot of patrols?

Lazar:
Oh yeah.

Goodman:
Off the air, you said you traveled one time on hydrogen
in your car.

Lazar:
Yeah, I had a 1978 TransAm I converted to run on hydrogen.

Goodman:
We were talking about this one night as a new fuel for
transportation.  Is that more dangerous than gasoline?

Lazar:
It depends how it's stored.  There's ways you can do it.

You can store it as a gas, compressed in a cylinder where,
yeah, it's dangerous and explosive.

You can store it as a liquid -- cryogenic liquid --
where it's also dangerous and explosive.

Or you can also store it in a hydride [sp], a chemical
that absorbs hydrogen like a sponge absorbs water.  When
it's in that storage state, it's really not flammable.
You heat the chemical using the radiator water, or electrically,
or the exhaust gas to produce the hydrogen, and there's only
a small amount at a time ever produced.  And in that instance
it's a lot safer than gasoline, and that's the method I use.

Goodman:
In other words, we could put these in automobiles?

Lazar:
Absolutely, definitely.  The only exhaust is water vapor --
essentially steam and very little oxides.

Goodman:
Where do we get hydrogen?

Lazar:
The most common place is from water.  When you pass electricity
through water, you break down the bonds and wind up with oxygen
and hydrogen.

Goodman:
What could we be charged if we pulled up to a tank and asked
for some water?

Lazar:
It takes energy to separate the water back into its molecular
state, or atomic state rather.


Goodman:
But forgetting what the components are inside the car, if
a driver were to drive up, they would just have to put water
into this particular unit?  Could they make it that simple?

Lazar:
You could make it that simple, yes.

Goodman:
Has this been known for years in the scientific field?

Lazar:
There's been plenty of cars that have been made to run on
hydrogen.  In fact one state somewhere has their entire postal
fleet with little jeeps that run on hydrogen.  There's a
company called Billings Energy that does the conversions.

Goodman:
Why do you think it's not being made readily available to us?

Lazar:
There's probably lots of reasons.  You're looking at the oil
companies. . .

Goodman:
Okay.  That's what I wanted to get to.

Lazar:
But you can always point your finger at them for anything.

Goodman:
But I mean, it's just being held back from us even though it
could be here.

Lazar:
But you've got the problem of availability, too, if you're
going to just use gaseous hydrogen.

Goodman:
What would it take to change our current motor in a car to
accept this?

Lazar:
Not very much at all.  It's very similar to a propane
conversion.

Goodman:
Have you heard from Mr. Teller at all?

Lazar:
No.

Goodman:
Not one word?  In other words, he's done nothing at all?

Lazar:
No.

Goodman:
You said we're nowhere near being able to have an
anti-matter reactor?

Lazar:
No, not at all.  The first thing we'll come up with
when we toy with that some more is -- and there's already
been talk of it -- is an anti-matter weapon.  Unfortunately,
that's the easiest thing to produce.  First we'll see that
before we'll see potential useful uses.

Goodman:
I was talking to Bob Lazar off the air, and Bob is a jet
car driver.  That's how he relaxes, doing 350 miles per hour.

Roger:
Are the nine disks quite different in appearance?

Lazar:
Yeah, they're all completely different in appearance.

Roger:
Are they then perhaps from different star systems?

Lazar:
Could be.

Roger:
You said the one you looked at, the Sport Model, was from
Reticulum, right?

Lazar:
That's what I READ.

Roger:
So that has the gravity propulsion system.  But then some
of the others may have some other type of propulsion system?

Lazar:
I was told that the reactors are all similar in them [the crafts],
and from that I just assume that the propulsion system is the
same.  But it is possible that the other ones have different
propulsion systems, yeah.

Roger:
How many light years from Earth to Reticulum?

Lazar:
32, 33, 34, somewhere around there.

Roger:
They must get away from Earth before they amplify these
gravitational systems, do they not?

Lazar:
They don't HAVE to, but it has to be a line of sight where
they can move to.

Roger:
In other words, it wouldn't have any effect on the Earth even
though it were close to it when they turned it on?

Lazar:
No.

Roger:
Where do the aliens fit into religion?  They must say
something about it.  I heard that they had a [bearing]
on us through religion, perhaps through colonization.

Lazar:
I've read some about that.  You know, I don't want to
go into that because that's going to upset everybody.

Caller:
What is the top speed of the craft?

Lazar:
It's tough to say a top speed because to say speed you have
to compare distance and time.  And when you're screwing
around with time and distorting it, you can no longer judge
a velocity.  They're not traveling in a linear mode where they
just fly and cover a certain distance in a certain time.
That's the real definition of speed.  They're bending and
distorting space and then essentially snapping it back with
the craft, so the distances they can travel are phenomenal --
in little or no time.  So speed has little bearing.

Caller:
Is the laser part of their technology or their flying speed?

Lazar:
No, I haven't seen anything along that line.

Caller:
Is Rockwell involved with that?

Lazar:
Not that I've seen.

Pistol:
You've mentioned anti-gravity generator and anti-matter
generator.  Are they different?

Lazar:
It's not a gravity generator; it's a gravity amplifier.  I
get tongue-twisted all too often.

The anti-matter reactor provides the power for the craft and
the basic low-amplitude gravitational wave, which is too low
of an amplitude to do anything.  It's piped into the gravity
amplifiers, which are found at the bottom of the craft.
There it's amplified into an extremely powerful wave, and
that's what the craft is flown on.  But there is an anti-matter
reactor:  that's what provides the power.

Roger Nelson, KBAY-Radio San Francisco  announcer:
Last time I asked Bob Lazar about the hyper-light propulsion
systems he had seen, he said the crafts have hyper-light
capabilities -- beyond the speed of light.  Do you know
anyone in our government or who worked on the craft who
might be from Earth who has taken those craft and flown
past the speed of light to other galaxies?

Lazar:
I don't, and I don't know if they have been used for that.

Nelson:
Is there any way to find how many of our guys on particular
programs have gone to space, what they're learning, exactly
where they are now, and whether or not there's any tie-in
with the Alternative Three Escape-Earth Plan that supposedly the
Government leaders are stirring up now.  Is there any place
that you know of that this information can be found?

Lazar:
I imagine, if any of that is in fact true, it would be found in
the midst of S-4 or 51 down there.  But how to contact those guys
and actually get them to talk is a feat not yet attained.

Nelson:
What is it you are now doing now that they have cut you off
at the knees?

Lazar:
I do other scientific research and produce, design, and
repair alpha radiation detection equipment.

Nelson:
A number of copies of these broadcasts and the show on
Channel 8 and all the other stuff has been getting around,
perhaps even internationally.  Has anybody bothered you since
you went public?

Lazar:
Other than the sily little things that have been done, no,
nothing, nothing big to be concerned about.

Nelson:
Are we going to see you at any of these things like the
January 7th conference ["An Evening With Bill Cooper," Showboat
Hotel Sports Pavilion, Las Vegas, Nevada, 5:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.,
$15 per person], or other symposiums in the future?

Lazar:
I don't think so, no.

Nelson:
Well look, I think you're a very brave man.  With that kind of
an onus on your head, it takes a lot of courage to keep coming
back to the airwaves.  I stand up and cheer as one.

Caller:
How do your magnetohydrodynamics studies relate to the hot
spots in the earth's magnetic flux, and does that relate to the
deep-hole theory, the Soviet Union's plan?

Lazar:
I don't know what the Soviet Union's plan was.  I looked at
it from a power point of view, as producing on a large scale
plasma-generated energy in a power-plant situation, or producing
something that would retrofit -- like a coal-fired plant that
has a lot of waste heat and high-energy plasma.

Caller:
The question is, are you experimenting using the earth's flux?

<...Continued from previous message>

Lazar:
No.  There's stand-alone high-energy magnets that I use.

Caller:
What is the atomic weight of 115?

Lazar:
I hate even to guess.  I know it because we've written it down
because we've calculated it, but I really don't remember.

Caller:
Can you give us a ballpark?

Lazar:
No, 'cause I'd be wrong!  Just like if I gave a ballpark on the
gravitational wave frequency -- and that's really bugging the hell
out of me.

There were three things, as a matter of fact, that for some reason
I've developed a mental block on.  I'll have to call Billy, and
then he can announce it on the air.  I'll just call him and then
he can relay it to everyone.

New Caller:
I'd like to stand up and cheer for Bob Lazar!  It does take a
lot of courage, and it's about time somebody stepped forward with
some information that's being kept from us for so long.

How long do you think it took them to make their journey here,
using their methods of propulsion?

Lazar:
An extremely short time.  I'd hesitate to say, but I don't think
you're even looking at days.

Caller:
Is that because of this gravity lines-of-force thing or because
time stands still for them and it really does take a long time
but they don't know it because time stands still?

Lazar:
No, they're actually traveling almost IN-BETWEEN time because
of the way that they distort time and space.  So that they're
traveling vast distances without the incrementation of time.
The time would be very, very little.  Days is probably --
I'm way off saying that, too.  But I hate to say something
and be really far off.

Caller:
Could these aliens be robots and not actually be native beings
from that galaxy?

Lazar:
I imagine it's possible.  Who knows what actually flew the
craft, whether or not aliens have ever been in Area S-4
down there, but it's possible that some automated creature
flew them.  Who knows?

Goodman:
You made a statement when he asked how long it took them
to get here, and when you were inside the spacecraft itself
you didn't see any sleeping quarters.  So perhaps they just
start in the morning and they're here in the afternoon;
it's that simple as far as OUR time goes.

Lazar:
If it even takes that long.

Barbara:
When your hypnotherapist, Layne Keck, talked on the air
about you, did you request that?

Lazar:
That he talk about me?

Barbara:
Uh huh.

Lazar:
No, George Knapp requested that, and then Layne called me to
find out if it would be okay, and I said yeah, go ahead.

Barbara:
Well, I called the office and that was what I was told,
and it didn't seem quite --

Lazar:
That I requested Layne to go on?  No.

Barbara:
That's what the person in the office said.

How was your experience there with him?  How did you feel
about your experience?

Lazar:
As far as what?  How I got along with Layne?

Barbara:
No.  As far as how you felt comfortable with going back
to some unpleasant experiences.

Lazar:
The emotions came up when you're under hypnosis, and that
part wasn't exactly pleasant.

Barbara:
How do you feel about it today?

Lazar:
I feel better.  At the time, it wasn't very pleasant.
But in general, just being under hypnosis is a really
good feeling.

Barbara:
You have the videotape of that?

Lazar:
Yeah.

Barbara:
It's in your possession?

Lazar:
I don't want to say where it is, but I know where it is.

Barbara:
I'm going to be doing that because I was with him.  So for
my own personal information, I just wanted to do that,
because I have good aliens, bad aliens, you know, it runs
in my family.  And there's an extreme reason why I'm going to
be doing this, so I wanted to clarify that and try to
make myself . . .Although I can do it on my own, I won't
go deeper than a certain point.

New Caller:
Is there any limit on the distance a spaceship can travel.
Can it actually travel out of our galaxy to the Andromeda
galaxy?  How far can 223 grams of Element 115 take you?

Lazar:
I really don't know.  From what I understand, the actual
consumption of the element is very low; I imagine it is
possible with enough [junk] made to travel to another galaxy.

Caller:
I assume the gravity wave is more powerful than the
gamma wave, correct?

Lazar:
Than the GAMMA wave?

Caller:
Or the spectral wave?  What's the limit on light waves
with the 10 billion light years or something -- how far light
can travel?

Lazar:
A limit as far as what?  It depends on the interaction:
the gravitational fields the beam passes through, the
photons pass through, and so on and so forth, so there's
no real limit at true dead space.

As I said last time, and only one person took advantage
of it, if anyone does have any questions they want to ask
me, they can write in care of this station.  A person called
earlier and wanted a copy of that newspaper article.  I
have no problem in copying that and sending it to him.
So just write to the station, whatever the address is.
