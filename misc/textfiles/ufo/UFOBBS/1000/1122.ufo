READING pensioner Peter Littlewood is convinced he saw an unidentified
flying object hovering above the town yesterday. Mr. Littlewood, aged
62, is so sure the jumbo jet-sized object was a UFO he wants to get
in touch with experts and have his sighting recorded.
 
He said: "I was driving up Peppard Road when I noticed an object in
the sky, in between the two rows of lime trees.
 
"It was stationary and remained in the air until the leaves of the
trees obscured it from my view.
 
"I parked in Moss Close and scanned the sky but all I could see was
a thin vapour trail which I think came from an aeroplane.

"I am positive it was not a hot air baloon or an airship.  It was
silver colored, shaped like a hamburger.

The hills of the Squamish Valley are alive--with something. 
 
Weird, UFO-like lights have been sighted at least three times dancing
around the Stawamus Chief mountain. And a fiery crash was also sighted
near Whistler's Blackcomb Mountain.
 
Late Saturday, more than a dozen wide-eyed watchers were treated to
a cliffside spectacular around Stawamus Chief.
 
"There were two bright lights right on the face of the Chief," said
Fred Bevilacqua, 38.
 
"One shot down really fast and disappeared.  Another turned and turned
up into the sky until you couldn't see it anymore."
 
Squamish carpenter Ken Granger was also blinded by the lights. 
 
"There was one large amber light in the sky.  A smaller light came
down onto the Chief.  But then it started going up diagonally across
the side.  It went around the corner and disappeared."

On June 27, several residents of Squamish's Valley-cliff area saw
two small lights and a large light travelling very fast in a northeast
direction.
 
And June 13, Greg Stoddard and Sam James of Whistler saw what looked
like a meteor crashing behind *ûBlackcomb Mountain.
 
"It was a small spherical fireball that glowed white in the centre
rimmed by blue and trailing a smoky white trail," said Stoddard.
 
The numerous sightings have been reported to RCMP, who have passed
it on to authorities in Ottawa.

Buenos Aires, March 24, 1986 (EEE)-Scared Argentine farmers from the
area of Corrientes province pordering with paraguay, claimed to have
"talked" with the occupants of a "Flying Saucer" that landed there,
it was reported today in Buenos Aires.
 
One of them, Rito Melgarejo, told the Telam news agency that he saw
how the "UFO descended and biinded him with its strong lights." Two
of its occupant came out, they looked like small Martians.  They spoke
to me in a language I didn't understand, and signalled me, said the
frightened worker.
 
I told them I couldn't understand them and went away.  When I turned
around they were gone, said Melgarejo, in an account that was corroborated
by other local residents.
 
Confessing he still has the headache he got since he spoke with the
occupants four days ago, he described them as small, wearing black,
tight fitting clothes.  Telam said that strange traces were found
at the spot, such as burned grass in a 6 meter circle, and the remains
of an eel that had not decomposed.
