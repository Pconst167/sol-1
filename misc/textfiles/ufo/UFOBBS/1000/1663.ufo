SUBJECT: "ED" DECIDES TO WRITE A BOOK                        FILE: UFO1663




An open letter for CompuServe from "Ed" of Gulf Breeze.

February 9, 1989

In answering a question about the rumors of a "book", I reflect
on the chain of events that finally forced my wife and me to 
agree.

Some people have been influenced by much telling and re-telling
of what happened.  Sprinkle in a critic or two with an unknown 
motive to twist a piece of truth into events that never happened
and it is understandable how distorted the details can become.

During Feb. 1988, a N. Y. publisher flew to Gulf Breeze and asked
me to sell my (very sloppy) log and my wife's diary.  The money 
offer was six figures.  I refused because of the publicity that might
disrupt my family.  Also Budd Hopkins advised that photo
analysis, lie detector, and psychological tests were required to
establish credibility. 

For the past year my first concern has been my family.  My efforts
to withhold my name and protect them were honored (with my
appreciation) by all the investigators and researchers with the 
exception of W. Smith and B. Boyd.

Only after the frequent blast of "liar", "hoaxer" and "con man"
from W. Smith did it become clear that the complete, accurate
story should be told.  So, It can be said that W. Smith's efforts to 
ridicule me and sweep Gulf Breeze away, actually caused my wife
and I to agree to a book.

I understand that the "book motive" will be hurled against me but
it doesn't seem to matter.  W. Smith or P. Klass will continue to 
degrade the photos and other witnesses, sight unseen.

So I conclude, Yes there will be a book.  If it makes money -- fine,
if not -- fine.  But at least the record will be clear and less easy
for a critic to distort the events to an unsuspecting listener. (One
hoax theory recently spread was based on two separate events --
twelve days apart.  The critic lumped the details together, created
and then debunked a non-event.)  Quite likely the people who 
write such reports really believe them.  I hope the "book" will
help them better understand the Gulf Breeze sightings.

If CompusServe network people have a personal comment, advice,
or criticism, you are welcome to write me at: Ed "Jones",
P.O. Box 715, Gulf Breeze, FL, 32562-0715.  (Please don't ask for
photos, the publisher requires that I not give out photos as I have
been doing.  He wants to put all of the color prints in the book.)

Ed
