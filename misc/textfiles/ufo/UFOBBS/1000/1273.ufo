3500 PEOPLE DESCEND ON FYFFE TO SEE NO-SHOW UFO

By Susan Stockman

     FYFFE-A  thousand  points of light descended on  Fyffe  last
Friday  night  as people from all over  the  Southeastern  United
States visited this small town in hopes of getting just a glimpse
of  what has become known around the world at the infamous 'Fyffe
Flying Banana.'
     For  the  most  part,  the UFO stalkers  were  disappointed,
because the only lights to be found in Fyffe on this cloudy night
were  those from the magnitude of vehicles roaming  the  highways
and byways.
     While  the estimated 7,000 eyes of the 3,500 people in Fyffe
were focused on the horizon Friday night, unofficial reports came
in  that the craft was sighted in the sky between  Macedonia  and
Grove Oak around 9:00 p.m. that night.
     A  traffic  jam in the middle of town was the most  exciting
event  that  took place all night,  and most of  the  side  roads
looked  like  a lover's lane,  with cars parked on the sides  and
necks stuck out the windows--watching and waiting.
     They  came in cars,  vans,  campers and trucks,  armed  with
cameras,  binoculars, blankets and thermos bottles of coffee, all
on the same mission--to see the mysterious,  flashing object that
has been roaming the night skies of Fyffe for the past month.
     A  bonfire  was  built  on the edge  of  town  to  lure  the
visitors, both from this world and, perhaps, beyond.
     Antenna's  were  pointed at the sky as  television  stations
broadcasted their nightly news programs from this small town.
     Media  descended  on  the town  like  locusts,  interviewing
everyone  that had an opinion of what was in the  sky--and  there
wasn't anyone who was in Fyffe that didn't have an opinion.
     Fire trucks were moved out of the fire station to make  room
for  a vendor to set up tables to sell air brushed T-shirts  that
said, "I survived the Sand Mountain UFO."
     UFO  seekers ran the gamut from babies blanketed in mothers'
arms,  to teenagers cruising with radios blasting,  to  someone's
grandmother  who  said she had had an experience with a UFO  some
years back.
     Fyffe  has  received worldwide attention  in  recent  weeks,
after  the  first sightings of a 'banana-shaped' object  hovering
over the area was sited by Donna Saylor of Grove Oak on  February
10.  Since the first sightings, many more have been reported, but
the description differed somewhat from the original banana shaped
object.
     Representatives  of  the Mutual Unidentified  Flying  Object
Network  (MUFON),  an international research group involved  with
UFO  studies,  were  also in Fyffe Friday night,  and there  were
unconfirmed reports of FBI agents and Air Force investigators  in
town.
     Fyffe  has  been the subject of numerous newspaper  articles
and  national news stories such as 'Inside Edition,' who aired  a
somewhat comical report of the sightings.
     But  the  residents of Fyffe who saw  the  mysterious  craft
don't find anything comical about the sightings.   They just want
to  know what it is,  and they continue to search the night skies
for  another glimpse of the craft,  waiting for someone  to  come
forth with information to identify the object.
     With  the  party atmosphere that prevailed in  Fyffe  Friday
night,  the  UFO could have,  in all probability,  landed on  the
outskirts  of town and no one would have seen it--the people were
just too busy searching the skies.
