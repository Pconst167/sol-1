PART 17

Moore's  Confession:  By  mid-1989  the  two  most  controversial
figures in ufology were Moore and Lear. Moore's MUFON lecture  on
July 1 did nothing to quiet his legion of critics. On his arrival
in  Las Vegas, Moore checked into a different hotel from the  one
at which the conference was being held. He already had refused to
submit his paper for publication in the symposium proceedings, so
no  one  knew what he would say. He had also stipulated  that  he
would accept no questions from the floor.

 Moore's speech stunned and angered much of the audience. At  one
point   the  shouts  and  jeers  of  Lear's   partisans   brought
proceedings  to a halt until order was restored.  Moore  finished
and exited immediately. He left Las Vegas not long afterwards.

 In his lecture Moore spoke candidly, for the first time, of  his
part in the counterintelligence operation against Bennewitz.  "My
role  in the affair," he said, "was largely that of a  freelancer
providing information on Paul's current thinking and activities."
Doty,  "faithfully carrying out orders which he personally  found
distasteful," was one of those involved in the effort to  confuse
and  discredit Bennewitz. Because of his success at this  effort,
Moore suggested, Doty was chosen by the real "Falcon" as "liaison
person,  although I really don't know. Frankly, I  don't  believe
that  Doty does either. In my opinion he was simply a pawn  in  a
much larger game, just as I was."

 From  disinformation  passed on by AFOSI sources,  and  his  own
observations  and  guesses,  according to  Moore,  "by  mid-1982"
Bennewitz had put together a story that "contained virtually  all
of  the  elements  found  in the current  crop  of  rumors  being
circulated around the UFO community." Moore was referring to  the
outlandish  tales Lear and Cooper were telling. Moore  said  that
"when  I first ran into the disinformation operation . . .  being
run on Bennewitz . . . [i)t seemed to me . . . I was in a  rather
unique position. There I was with my foot . . . in the door of  a
secret  counterintelligence  game that gave every  appearance  of
being  somehow directly connected to a high-level government  UFO
project, and, judging by the positions of the people I knew to be
directly  involved with it, definitely had something to  do  with
national  security!  There was no way I was going  to  allow  the
opportunity  to  pass me by without learning at  least  something
about  what was going on. . . . I would play  the  disinformation
game,  get  my  hands  dirty just  often  enough  to  lead  those
directing  the  process into believing that I was  doing  exactly
what  they wanted me to do, and all the while continue to  burrow
my  way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible  about
who  was directing it and why." Some of the same people who  were
passing alleged UFO secrets on to Moore were also involved in the
operation against Bennewitz. Moore knew that some of the material
he  was  getting--essentially  a mild version  of  the  Bennewitz
scenario, without the horror, paranoia and conspiracy--was false,
but  he (along with Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, to  whom
he  confided the cover-up story in June 1982; Friedman,  however,
would  not learn of Moore's role in the Bennewitz  episode  until
seven years later) felt that some of it was probably true,  since
an  invariable  characteristic  of  disinformation  is  that   it
contains some facts. Moore also said that Linda Howe had been the
victim of one of Doty's disinformation operations.

 Before  he stopped cooperating with such schemes in 1984,  Moore
said,  he had given "routine information" to AFOSI about  certain
other  individuals in the UFO community. Subsequently he  claimed
that  during this period this emphasis) "three other  members  of
the  UFO  community . . . were actively doing the same  thing.  I
have  since  learned of a fourth. . . . All  four  are  prominent
individuals   whose   identities,  if  disclosed,   would   cause
considerable  controversy in the UFO community and bring  serious
embarrassment  to two of its major organizations. To the best  of
my  knowledge,  at least two of these people are  still  actively
involved" (Moore, 1989b).

 Although  he would not reveal the identities of  the  government
informants  within  ufology,  Moore gave  the  names  of  several
persons "who were the subject of intelligence community  interest
between 1980 and 1984." They were:

 (1)  Len  Stringfield,  a ufologist known for  his  interest  in
crashed-disc   stories;  in  1980  he  had  been  set  up  by   a
counterintelligence operative who gave him phony pictures of what
purported to be humanoids in cold storage.

 (2) The late Pete Mazzola, whose knowledge of film footage  from
a  never-publicized  Florida UFO case was of  great  interest  to
counterintelligence types. Moore was directed to urge Mazzola  to
send the footage to ufologist Kal Korff (who knew nothing of  the
scheme) for analysis; then Moore would make a copy and pass it on
to  Doty. But Mazzola never got the film, despite  promises,  and
the  incident came to nothing. "I was left with the  impression,"
Moore  wrote,  "that  the  file  had  been  intercepted  and  the
witnesses somehow persuaded to cease communication with Mazzola."

 (3)  Peter  Gersten,  legal counsel  for  Citizens  Against  UFO
Secrecy  (CAUS),  who had spearheaded  a  (largely  unsuccessful)
legal suit against the NSA seeking UFO information.

 (4) Larry Fawcett, an official of CAUS and coauthor of a book on
the cover-up, Clear Intent (1984).

 (5)  James  and  Coral Lorenzen, the  directors  of  the  Aerial
Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) periodically "subjects  of
on-again,  off  again interest . . .  mostly  passive  monitoring
rather  than active meddling," according to Moore.  Between  1980
and  1982 APRO employed a "cooperative" secretary who  passed  on
confidential material to counterintelligence personnel.

 (6)  Larry  W. Bryant, who was battling without success  in  the
courts  to have UFO secrets revealed. Moore said, "His name  came
up often in discussions but I never had any direct involvement in
whatever activities revolved around him."

 These revelations sent shock waves through the UFO community. In
September CAUS devoted virtually all of an issue of its  magazine
Just  Cause to a harshly critical review of  Moore's  activities.
Barry  Greenwood  declared that the "outrageousness"  of  Moore's
conduct "cannot be described. Moore, one of the major critics  of
government  secrecy on UFOs, had covertly informed on people  who
thought he was their friend and colleague. Knowing full well that
the  government  people  with whom he  was  dealing  were  active
disinformants,  Moore  pursued  a  relationship  with  them   and
observed  the  deterioration of Paul Bennewitz'[s]  physical  and
mental  health.  . . . Moore reported the effects  of  the  false
information  regularly to some of the very same people  who  were
'doing  it'  to Paul. And Moore boasted in his speech as  to  how
effective it was" (Greenwood, 1989). Greenwood complained further
about  Moore's  admission that on the disastrous Cover-up .  .  .
Live  show Falcon and Condor had said things that they knew  were
untrue.  "In  the rare situation where two hours  of  prime  time
television  are given over to a favorable presentation  of  UFOs,
here we have a fair portion of the last hour wasted in presenting
what  Moore admits to be false data. . . . Yet he saw fit  to  go
ahead and carry on a charade, making UFO research look ridiculous
in  the process. Remarks by Falcon and Condor about  the  aliens'
lifestyle  and  preference for Tibetan music and  strawberry  ice
cream were laughable." So far as Greenwood and CAUS, skeptical of
the MJ-12 briefing document from the first, were concerned, "July
1, 1989, may well be remembered in the history of UFO research as
the day when the 'Majestic 12' story came crashing to Earth in  a
heap of rubble. Cause of death: Suicide!"
