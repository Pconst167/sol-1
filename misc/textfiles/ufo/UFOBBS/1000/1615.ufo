The following articles are part of a series on the Gulfbreeze
UFO's . I know of no other case in UFOlogy that has been
debated/contested as much as this one has. Much of the debate
centers around "Mr Ed", Ed Walters and the swirls of controversy
over his photos. There have been cries of "HOAX!" ever since
this case made the headlines a few years ago, and this was only
exacerbated even further when Ed wrote his book. Much of the
debate centers over the infamous "road shot" that appears in
this book and the tug of war between the various UFO groups
still continues to this day. To date, there has not been any
established or absolute conclusive PROOF as to the hoax claims,
though there has been quite a few theories advanced. What makes
Ed's claims the more difficult to accept by many is that he has
been the ONLY one who has photographed the UFO(s) in great detail,
where others have only managed to get "red blobs" in their pics.

Having followed this for a few years now..it is still NO closer
to being resolved. I think I could safely say that the ParaNet
UFO organization and CUFOS have rated Ed Walters as probable
hoax. MUFON on the other hand, has stood behind the Walters
case all the way.

Here's a partial list of characters so you will understand who the
principles are:

Ed Walters - The _center_ of the controversy.He took the photos
and wrote the book, "The Gulf Breeze Sightings".

Bob Oechsler - Investigator/reporter.

Donald Ware - Florida state MUFON director. Investigator.

Carol and Rex Salisberry - (former) State Section Directors for
Pensacola MUFON. Investigators.

Dr. Bruce Maccabee - Optical physicist for the US Navy and MUFON
State Director for Maryland. Principle photo analyst for MUFON.

Duane Cook - Editor of the Gulf Breeze Sentinel.

Willy Smith - Claims that Ed made the models and hoaxed the photos.
Got nailed in a "sting" by Antonio Huneeus and Manuel Fernandez and
was later dis-credited.

 - Others mentioned in articles on the BBS side -

John Hicks - Currently is the FIDO_UFO moderator and owner of a
camera business. Knows his optics pretty well and has done some
investigation in his own right in the Gulfbreeze area.

Jim Speiser - The guy I like to refer as the "curmudgeon of ParaNet" :-)
He's asked the hard questions and brought up several inconsistencies
of the whole affair on ParaNet. In this case, he is very much a skeptic.

Unfortunately, this case has also caused much division in UFOlogy with
the extremes of positions. It's quite probable that there has been
some dis-information involved as well.

There seems to be two issues here...one regarding sightings and photos
by Ed Walters and the other involving witnessed sightings _without_
Ed Walters. In the latter case, there has been quite a lot of those.
These sightings are *still* going on today. Some have speculated
that the recent skyquakes in the Gulfbreeze/Tampa area may be
associated with UFO's.

Who knows...if you're ever down in the panhandle of Florida and have
some time to spend..you just might be able to witness this phenomenon
for yourself. Bring a good camera or vidcam and do NOT trust the
autofocus, but learn to do it manually and you'll get good pictures.

Since there are quite a lot of these files, I would suggest that you
save them when they hit your system as I don't plan on re-posting them
again. This is a one time shot. There's going to be about 38 files
altogether totalling around 290K.
