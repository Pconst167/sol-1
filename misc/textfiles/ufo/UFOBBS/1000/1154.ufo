NEWMARKET srar-gazers could no believe their eyes when they saw what appeared to be unidentified flying objects bovering in the sky above the town in the earlt hours of Tuesday.
     Stephen Milne, of Tunbridge Close, Burwell, was arriving home at around 1:30am when he saw what he described as "strange green lights in the sky."
     "I was looking towards Cambridge and there were four lights that went together in a block and then round in circles.
     "I thought it might be lights from a fair but as far as I know there wasn't one on.  Lots of people saw it," he said.
     The lights were also seen by Clive Humphries, of Freshfields, Newmarket, at around 2am.
     "There were four green lights, like disco lights.  They dept splitting up and then going together again, just hanging in the air.  My sister Camilla and some of my friends saw htem as well," he said.
     USAF Mildenhall spokesman Frank Randall confirmed the lights had nothing to do with base activities.
     "We had no traffic in the air at that time on Tuesday as we close down from 10pm to 6am.  Our midnight shift reported no unusual sightings in the area," he said.
     *The latest theory is that rather than a visitation from an outer planet the lights were laser beams from May Balls at Cambridge Colleges.
