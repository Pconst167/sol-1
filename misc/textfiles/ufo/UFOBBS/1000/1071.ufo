PART 28

Bill----How did you see the saucer?

Man-----The hanger is only entered through one door.  Inside
        the door is the guard room.  On the other side of the
        guard room is a door that goes into an office.  On
        the other side of the office is another door.  We
        were not allowed out of the guard room but one night
        the duty officer asked me if I knew what I was
        guarding.  I said no that it was not my job to know.
        He asked me if I would like to see.  I thought he was
        checking me out and told him it wasn't necessary.  He
        motioned for me to follow him and then took me
        through the office and into the hanger.  I saw the
        saucer sitting on legs and it seemed to have jacks
        under it also.

Bill----Can you describe it for me?

Man-----It was about 30 feet in diameter, metal but not
        shiny.  Like tarnished silver.

Bill----How thick was it?

Man-----About 15 to 18 feet thick.......It had the insignia
        on the underside and again on the top.

Bill----Did you see any openings?

Man-----No but I only saw one side and it was only for about
        3 or 4 minutes.

Bill----Was it round?

Man-----Oh yes...just like the movies.

Bill----Were there any windows?

Man-----There was what looked to be windows around the raised
        portion but I could not see inside.

Bill----Were they round?

Man-----No, they were rectangular....I also saw a groove
        around the saucer about 4 feet from the edge all the
        way around and it was on the top and bottom.  There
        was an area on the bottom that looked like vents or
        louvres.

Bill----What did the Officer say to you?

Man-----Only that he did not show me anything and we went
        back to the guard room then he left.

Bill----Isn't that unusual?

Man-----Everything I did or saw on Delta was unusual.  I saw
        people break down and cry for no reason at times.
        When things like that occurred you would never see
        that man again.

Bill----What happened to them?

Man-----I don't know and didn't ask.

Bill----Lets deviate from this for awhile.  Do you mind?

Man-----No, I don't.

Bill----How did you get into Delta security?

Man-----I was recruited into the National Recon Organization
        and went to Fort Carson Colorado.  After a lot of
        training I was screened for Delta and then assigned
        to Delta.

Bill----Why did they recruit you?

Man-----I was told that it was because I was an orphan.  If
        something happens to someone connected to a secret
        project and they have family, the family could
        compromise the project in just trying to find out
        what happened to their loved one.

Bill----Is everyone in Delta orphans?

Man-----Just about, either that or their family died or was
        killed later in life.

Bill----Didn't that bother you?  I mean what could be so
        secret that they have to use orphans?

Man-----Some of the things I've seen......The stories...
        especially concerning dreamland....Did you know there
        are bounty hunters connected with dreamland?

Bill----What do you mean?

Man-----If you work at Dreamland and go on leave or pass and
        are not back on time or if someone doesn't come back
        they send bounty hunters after you.......Thats where
        the visitors...you know what I mean... live....there
        is an underground facility.......I don't think I
        should say anymore.....Most of the time I was there I
        can't even remember anyway.....We were supposed to
        talk about Redlight.

Bill----I don't remember agreeing to talk only about
        Redlight....Is this a new condition?

Man-----Yes, I don't want to talk about anything else........
        I will tell you that very strange things happen at
        Dreamland.

Bill----What do you mean when you say you can't remember?

Man-----I can't remember....I really don't want to talk about
        Dreamland.....I won't talk about it.

Bill----Please don't tantalize me.  Either talk about it or
        don't but don't do this to me.  What else can you say
        about Dreamland?  Can you tell me where it is?

Man-----No, I can't talk about it.  This is all very
        dangerous and I am married now.....I just can't take
        a chance.
