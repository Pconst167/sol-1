         MENORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:

                   The following is the information we have from GHQ
         at this mement regarding the air alarm over Los Angeles of
         yesterday morning:

                   "From details available at this hour:


                     1. Unidentified airplanes, other then American
            Army or Navy planes, were probably over Los Angeles, and
            were fired on by elements of the 37th CA Brigade  ( AA )
            between 3:12 and 4:15 AM.  These units expended  1430
            rounds of ammunition.

                     2. As many as fifteen airplanes may have
            been involved, flying at various speeds from what is
            officially reported as being very slow to as much
            as 200 MPH and at elevations from 9000 to 18000 feet.

                     3. No bombs were dropped.

                     4. No casualties among our troops.

                     5. No planes were shot down.

                     6. No American Army or Navy planes were in action.

                Investigation continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude
            that if unidentified airplanes were involved they may have
            been from commercial sources, operated by enemy agents for
            purposes of spreeding alarm, disclosing location of antiair-
            craft positions, and slowing production through blackout.
            Such conclusion is supported by varying speed of operation and
            the fact that no bombs were dropped.

                                                  Gen. George C. Marshall

                                                       Chief Of Staff
