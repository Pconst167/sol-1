Subj: Report of Sighting

I left a report of an unusual cirlce found in an alfalfa field by a farmer in
Kansas using your Report Sighting Program.  I did not witness this circle,
but it was reported to me by the farmer (my father in-law) over the
Thanksgiving holiday when I was in Kansas.  The 18 foot diameter circle (18
inches wide) appeared in July 1990, sometime between the time when the
alfalfa was cut down and the time it was raked (several days).  The color of
the "residue" was blue-grey and very different than the color of the newly
cut alfalfa and the growing alfalfa plants.  The farmer, who has lived on and
farmed this land for all of his life (over 50 years) has never seen anything
like this before.  He showed the circle to his wife and to a neighbor before
destroying it with a rake.  He did not take any photographs of the circle,
but he did keep a small jar of the alfalfa plants with the residue coating
He is willing to give the sample to anyone interested in analyzing it.  He
has given me permission to report his finding.  His name is:  Robert
Ackerman, Sr.

I have seen the sample and agree that it is unusual.  It has the appearance
of a fungus or mold growing on the alfalfa, which would not necessarily be
unusual except that it appeared "overnight" and that it was in the shape of a
perfect circle which covered not only growing alfalfa plants but also a newly
cut windrow of alfalfa.  Please call me at 873-5951 (work) or 872-8393 (home)
if you have any questions.

P.S.  I enjoy this BBS very much and appreciate your service. Thanks!
