PART 9

 In  the  1970s, as director of special projects for  the  Denver
CBS-TV   affiliate,   Linda   Moulton  Howe   had   produced   12
documentaries,   most   of   them   dealing   with    scientific,
environmental  and health issues. But the one that attracted  the
most  attention was Strange Harvest, which dealt with  the  then-
widespread  reports that cattle in Western and Midwestern  states
were  being  killed and mutilated by persons or  forces  unknown.
Most  veterinary  pathologists  said the animals  were  dying  of
unknown  causes.  Farmers,  ranchers  and  some   law-enforcement
officers thought the deaths were mysterious. Some even speculated
that   extraterrestrials  were  responsible.   This   possibility
intrigued Howe, who had a lifelong interest in UFOs, and  Strange
Harvest argues for a UFO mutilation link.

 In the fall of 1982, as Howe was working on a documentary on  an
unrelated matter, she got a call from Home Box Office (HBO).  The
caller  said  the  HBO people had  been  impressed  with  Strange
Harvest  and wanted to know if Howe would do a film on  UFOs.  In
March 1983 she went to New York to sign a contract with HBO for a
show to be titled UFOs-The ET Factor.

 The  evening  before her meeting with the HBO people,  Howe  had
dinner  with Gersten and science writer Patrick  Huyghe.  Gersten
told  Howe  that  he had met with Sgt. Doty, an  AFOSI  agent  at
Kirtland AFB, and perhaps Doty would be willing to talk on camera
or  in  some  other  helpful  capacity  about  the  incident   at
Ellsworth. Gersten would call him and ask if he would be  willing
to meet with Howe.

 Subsequently   arrangements  were  made  for  Howe  to  fly   to
Albuquerque  on April 9. Doty would meet her at the airport.  But
when she arrived that morning, no one was waiting. She called his
home.  A  small boy answered and said his father was  not  there.
Howe  then phoned Jerry Miller, Chief of Reality Weapons  Testing
at Kirtland and a former Blue Book investigator. (He is mentioned
in  the  October  28,  1980,  "Multipurpose  Internal  OSI  Form"
reporting on Doty and Miller's meeting with Bennewitz.) She  knew
Miller  from  an  earlier telephone conversation,  when  she  had
called  to ask him about Bennewitz's claims, in which she  had  a
considerable  interest.  Miller  asked  for  a  copy  of  Strange
Harvest.  Later he had given Howe his home phone number and  said
to  contact him if she ever found herself in Albuquerque. So  she
called and asked if he would pick her up at the airport.

 Miller  drove  Howe to his house. On the way Howe  asked  him  a
number  of  questions but got little in the way of  answers.  One
question  he  did  not  answer was whether  he  is  the  "Miller"
mentioned  in  the Aquarius document. When they got  to  Miller's
residence, Miller called Doty at his home, and Doty arrived a few
minutes  later, responding aggressively to Howe's question  about
where  he  had been. He claimed to have been at the  airport  all
along;  where had she been? "Perhaps," Howe would write, "he  had
decided he didn't want to go through with the meeting, and it was
acceptable in his world to leave me stranded at the airport-until
Jerry Miller called his house" (Howe, 1989).

 On  the way to Kirtland, Howe asked Doty, whose manner  remained
both defiant and nervous, if he knew anything about the  Holloman
landing. Doty said it happened but that Robert Emenegger had  the
date wrong; it was not May 1971 but April 25, 1964-12 Hours after
a much-publicized CE3 reported by Socorro, New Mexico,  policeman
Lonnie  Zamora. (Zamora said he had seen an egg-shaped object  on
the ground. Standing near it were two child-sized beings in white
suits.)  Military  and scientific personnel at the  base  knew  a
landing  was coming, but "someone blew the time and  coordinates"
and  an "advance military scout ship" had come down at the  wrong
time  and  place,  to  be observed by  Zamora.  When  three  UFOs
appeared  at Holloman at six o'clock the following  morning,  one
landed  while the other two hovered overhead. During the  meeting
between  the  UFO beings and a government  party,  the  preserved
bodies of dead aliens had been given to the aliens , who in  turn
had  returned  something  unspecified.  Five  ground  and  aerial
cameras recorded this event.

 At  the  Kirtland  gate  Doty waved to the  guard  and  was  let
through. They went to a small white and gray building. Doty  took
her  to  what he described as "my - boss'  office."  Doty  seemed
unwilling  to discuss the Ellsworth case, the  ostensible  reason
for the interview, but had much to say about other matters. First
he asked Howe to move from the chair on which she was sitting  to
another in the middle of the room. Howe surmised that this was to
facilitate the surreptitious recording of their conversation, but
Doty said only, "Eyes can see through windows."

 "My  superiors  have  asked me to show you this,"  he  said.  He
produced a brown envelope he had taken from a drawer in the  desk
at  which  he was sitting and withdrew several  sheets  of  white
paper.  As he handed them to Howe, he warned her that they  could
not be copied; all she could do was read them in his presence and
ask questions.
