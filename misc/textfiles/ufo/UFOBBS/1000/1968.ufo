Welcome to ParaNet Linda. Could you perhaps give us an update on current
prevalence of "cattle mutilations". Have they really dropped off dramatically
since 1983? In regards to this whole subject generally, what books would you
recommend as being the most comphrehensive? Seeing that your documentary was
widely publicized, is it very difficult for Video shops to acquire it? And I
know this is kind of putting you on the spot, but what's your reaction to the
Lear.txt, especially his comments relating to the genetic deficiency the EBEs
are supposed to have? One last question, how prevalent was the cattle
mutilation thing here in Canada, in particular, Ontario? Thanks, I shall be
awaiting your response...
                                            ...Tom

to Tom Mickus from Linda Howe About current status of animal mutilation
phenomena, I have written a softcover book entitled "Animal Mutilations:  The
UFO Factor" available now with 26 photos, documents and map.  It focuses on
recent cases, especially those involving UFOs.  In answer to your second
question  above, the mutilations did not taper off dramatically after l983.
There was intense activity iin South Dakota near Pine Bluff and Colorado and
several other parts of the United States.  Tom Adams in Paris, Texas, also has
files containing newspaper articles about the l980's and previous years.  He
is at P. O. Box l094, Paris Texas.  He also publishes "Stigmata" and "Crux"
about animal mutilations and paranormal phenomena.

About the availability of my documentary "A STRANGE HARVEST," in the week of
January 25th I am editing a new hour version that will contain a 6 minute
update of new material.  That video is available for purchase from me for
$47.50 including postage. Orders can be placed with a check or money order
made out to:  Linda Moulton Howe and sent to A STRANGE HARVEST,3208 East
Fremont Drive, Littleton, Colorado 80l22, PH:  303-694-9749.  I also have
available the complete transcript of the first broadcast version of A STRANGE
HARVEST, 77-minutes, with updates from l980 to l987 bound in soft cover for
$l8.00, including postage.  There are several published and video variations I
have and for further information about videos and publications, please contact
me by letter at the East Fremont address.

 About Lear's material -- he has aggressively been accumulating information
from many sources since the summer.  As is often the case in this hall of
mirrors with a quicksand floor (the UFO story), getting to any real hard rock
fact underneath the quicksand is difficult.  Out of frustration, many people
are tempted to run with conclusions based on second guessing and
circumstantial connections.  I sympathize with the frustration and energy
behind releases such as John's.  But as I have said to him directly, jumping
to conclusions and inferences without hard proof, especially in public forums,
can be a disservice.  After 7 years since producing A STRANGE HARVEST, the
only thing I can safely say is that there has been and is today deceit and
disinformation at many different levels, sometimes a single government agency
can be sending conflicting and contradictory messages simultaneously.  And
from the abduction cases, it is also clear that the ET's themselves don't seem
to level with humans either.  So, every piece of information that surfaces,
including John's paper,  has a question mark around it?
 Canada?  Many mutilation reports there in British Columbia, Alberta.... after
A STRANGE HARVEST WAS BROADCAST IN L980, i GOT A CALL FROM Lynn Lauber, Royal
Canadian Mounted Police in Calgray.  He wanted to screen A STRANGE HARVEST
because quite honestly in spite of the RCMP's public statements about being on
the trail of a cult killing the animals, the private fact was that they were
stymied like all the other law enforcement in this country and elsewhere.
Lauber screened HARVEST and maintained an exchange of photographic and other
- More (Y)/N/NS?
evidence with U.S. law enforcement. The most recent animal mutilation stories
surfaced in October l987 in Gunther, Alabama -- over 40- animals found slit
from th roat thru stomach, bloodless, and some internal organs removed.  No
person or thing caught.  In Wytheville, Va currently, much livestock reported
missing.

This is a follow up to my correspondence yesterday with Tom Mickus about John
Lear's text.  John gathered that material from several sources who were all
getting a similar dark scenario concerning the gray ET motives.  Since
September, several UFO investigators have received similar material from
confidential sources, so John has outlined some of what has surfaced and his
ideas about the material.  It's important to keep in mind that John is not
alone in receiving such material and the fact that similar stories are coming
from different sources in the U. S. and abroad might be significant.  However,
so far there still is no proof for any of it and I think it is helpful to keep
a mental distance on all the unproved material -- like watching a movie from
the back row in the balcony without becoming too involved in any particular
scene and sensing that the plot can still take some very unexpected turns.

Hi Linda;
    Nice to have you on ParaNet... I know this may be out of your area of
expertise, but do you know anything about the MIB cases?? Or how about the
EBE's that Mr. Lear spoke of?....Looking forwardûß to your ÿ  Sorrýéyß´—ÿ
about the line noise....

To Ralph Toscano from Linda Howe ... First, MIB's.  When I was investigating
the animal mutilation mystery in l979-l980 for A STRANGE  HARVEST, there were
at least 3 different kinds of ETs associated with the mutilations:  l)  the
Grays, the short large black eyed type such as those so often reported and
drawn by abductees in Budd H opkins research and others.  2)  Blonds, or
Nordic types -- taller, pale shoulder length hair and light eyes with pupils
bigger than human eyes but basically very similar in appearance to Northern
European humans.  3)  Dark skinned, brown, Asiatic type with slanted eyes and
dark black hair that make strange high pitched language sounds.  This is also
your MIB description in the UFO literature.  Are the Asiatic types doing
several things at once including scaring UFO witnesses and mutilating animals?
 Or are there several different types of ETs on the planet at the same time,
each with a different mission or motive?  I don't know the answer.  But I do
believe that human witnesses want to report exactly what they saw.  Most
people in my experience are try ing very honestly to deal with the
inexplicable by trying to explain it. EBE -- this is a government acronym for
"extraterrestrial biological entity or entities".  It is my understanding that
this acronym was used by our government; i.e.  the MJ-l2 types from around
l947 on.

Linda;
    If all three alien types are associated with the mutilations, then is it
safe to assume that each "race" has a parallel need for the parts that they
are so precisely removing?... I am also curious about government involvement
in these mutilations... Like Army testing of biological weapons on these
animals...Did you run into any resistance from the military or government
agencies while doing your research for Strange Harvest??

About the 3 different alien types related to the mutilations -- it has been
suggested that the particular blond type seen may have some direct connection
with the grays such as doing work for the grays without having the same needs
as the grays.  Further, it has also been suggested that the MIB types have
some kind of alliance with the grays but not necessarily the same needs.
Thus, various ETs might be assisting each other but for different reasons and
different needs. About government involvement -- the Head of the animal
mutiliation investigation, Carl Whiteside, at the Colorado Bureau of
Investigations perhaps summed up that questiion the best:  "Why would the CIA
or any other government agency go around mutilating cows or other animals out
on the range lands?  If they wanted to test for something in those animals,
they could simply buy those animals and examine them in government facilities
without causing public awareness and fear."  Contrary to usual military and
government secrecy about sensitive issues, the mutilated carcasses of animals
have oftenn been left in conditions of such high strangeness that it seems
clear that the mutilators want the animals to be found and wondered about.

Linda,
  With the opening of the UFO flap in Australia, I was wondering if you had
ever investigated any mutilation reports from "The Land Down Under."  With
such sightings as are occurring now, it would seem that the mutilations might
be a direct link.

Yes, I made several inquiries about Australia when I was doing A STRANGE
HARVEST.  There are a lot of cows there and I expected to hear a lot of
mutilation stories.  But the opposite -- no mutilation reports in Australia.
However, there was an intriguing blurb in an English publication about a
documentary film done in l9ll called "The Haunted Bilabong" about the
mysterious deaths and mutilations of sheep iin the outback associated with
creatures from outer space.  I tried for a couple of months to try to track
down such a film -- if it ever existed -- and wonder today if that magazine
blurb was more government disinformation?  Or if such a film was actually made
in l9ll, who made it?  If anyone out there in the Paranet syustem has ever
heard anything about such a film, I would greatly appreciate knowing.

1911? Hmmmm...the very emergence of film as a media itself. If this film did
exist, it is probably locked away in some film vault at one of the bigger
studios here, or in England. Do you know if it was a silent film? It seems
that, being so early, it probably was. I think maybe the best thing to do
would be to write all the major studios, asking of such a film. It is very
possible they may know of its whereabouts. I will scan my film books and see
if I can come up with anything. Also, what was the Englsh publication? Was it
recent? They may know how to get it.
