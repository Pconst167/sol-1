SUBJECT: Am I an Abductee?                                   FILE: UFO1081

PART 5

Sometime later that week, I developed a somewhat painful subcutaneous
pimple in my pubic hair region.  I didn't think much about it at
the time, except that I had never had a pimple in that area before,
nor one as deep below the skin and as painful.  I forgot all about
this until just recently, on July 19, when I developed another pimple
in the same area, just after another unusual nocturnal experience.
It took me some time before I could accurately place a time-frame
on the occurrence of my first pimple.

April 11, I flew out to Chicago to visit my mother in the hospital,
and forced my father to have his bad toe looked at.  Sometime while
I was away, Jim stopped protecting the door every night and eventually
forgot about it.  I returned home April 18, just in time to greet
our house-guest from Los Angeles, our good friend, Dave.  During
his visit with us, I took Dave aside and told him of the strange
events in March, and of what Carolina had said.  I convinced him
to try and hypnotize me, so that I might be able to recall the events
more clearly. It took a great deal of persuasion to talk him into
it, since he said that he had no experience at hypnosis, and was
not eager to try.  Nevertheless, he eventually gave in, but we had
mixed results at the effort.  Nothing of interest really occurred,
except that the following morning I felt really negative about the
whole thing and destroyed the tape-recorded transcript of my hypnosis
session.  I didn't remember what I had said, and at that point, I
didn't want to either.  I never admitted to Dave what had happened
to the tape.  Before he left for Los Angeles, Dave warned me that
anything I might try to find out about my possible abduction experience
would most likely be contaminated by all the books I've read.

Life went on more-or-less as usual for the next several months.  I
resumed smoking again, my performance at school dropped sharply,
and I started drinking before going to bed.  When Summer came, I
avoided getting a job, and stayed up later and later every night.
I tried to put the subject of UFOs out of my mind, but only with
marginal success.  My attitude on the subject fluctuated from wishing
that I could forget it all, to openly inviting another experience.
Twice I purposefully went camping in extremely remote areas, hoping
that I could induce an abduction.  Needless to say, my effort was
futile (at least as far as I can remember.)  If aliens were abducting
me, then they had their own schedule, and my invitation didn't matter
one bit.

Then on July 17, it happened again.  I had been plagued by an uneasy
feeling all evening.  I thought about having a glass of wine, but
Jim coaxed me into bed early that night (around 2 am), telling me
we needed to get up by a decent hour the next day.  I am normally
a very heavy sleeper, and I fall asleep quickly, but that night was
to be an exception.  I laid in bed, tossing and turning for what seemed
like hours, never truly falling asleep.  I can recall listening to
the slow, deep rhythm of Jim's breathing pattern, and being surprised
that my restlessness wasn't disturbing him.  The last thing I remember
is the sensation of my heart pounding rapidly as I was overcome with
extreme fear.  And then suddenly, it was light out!  A thought entered
my head, but before I could think further, "Rap Rap Rap", three loud
bangs resounded throughout the apartment, causing me to fear that
we were in the midst of another earthquake.  I looked at the clock,
and was shocked to discover that it was already after 6 am.  Whatever
that first thought was, it was completely lost in the immediate confusion.
I became aware that my bladder was painfully full, and gently got
up so as to not awaken Jim, who was still sleeping soundly beside
me.  When I returned to bed, Jim asked me what I was doing up already.
Apparently, as silent as I had been, my movement had awoken him,
even though the three loud bangs had not.  Further, I questioned
why my earlier restlessness had not disturbed his sleep, but this
had.

I haven't had to get up to empty my bladder in the middle of the
night since childhood, and I began to wonder why it was so extremely
full, especially considering that I hadn't had anything to drink
the night before.  I was sure that I had never actually fallen asleep,
but yet I seemed to "wake up", with the sun already shining.  I put
on my night-mask to block out the daylight, and returned to bed.
And then I remembered something...    With the clarity equal to any
image seen through my own eyes, I beheld the likeness of an alien.
In my mind's eye, I held that vision and examined it.  As I inspected
the roundness of his hairless cranium, I became amazed at how real
and three-dimensional the image looked, much more than any photograph
could ever approach.  I observed the color of his skin, and was quite
surprized to learn that my previous conceptions were all wrong.
My earlier ideas of what an alien should look like were based upon
the dust jacket of Whitley Strieber's book, Communion, and on the
TV movie about The Interrupted Journey.  His skin was a creamy grey,
much less grey than I had previously imagined.  There was a tinge
of green, but as subtle as the green in a black person's complexion.
I thought to myself that an unsophisticated eye might not even pick
up on the green.  Overall, I would describe his complexion as simply
pale.  Only if I wished to emphasize its unusual nature, would I
use the word "grey."
