The following brief articles appeared in the November 10, 1988issue of The Sentinel, Gulf Breeze, Florida.  This issue discussessome of the
 highlights of the UFO sightings that haveoccurred in the area over the past year.  The first article is by theprimary photographer "Ed".  O

IGHTING'SANNIVERSARY     On Nov. 11, 1987, as I opened the front door and stared at theglowing object partly obscured by several pine trees,
 I steppedinto a phenomena that jolted me to the reality of UFOs.  Aphenomena that is being witnessed all over the world and hereat home by 
dozens of our fellow residents.  This reality may behard to accept for those who have not had a sighting, so I do nottry to convince or pers
uade.  I have only reported my personalsightings and incidents as they happened.     The resulting photographs and video tape I took of the 
UFOhave been validated by computer imaging (Dr. Maccabee, physicistwith the U.S. Navy).  And, of course, there are otheres who feeldifferent
ly and offer little other than opinions.      When I was asked to use a 4 lens Nimslo 3-D sealed camera,I did.  When I was asked to use the 
SRS (Self Referencing Stereo)camera, I did.  The technical analysis of these photographs produced page after page of data with the end resul
t detailing anobject 14 foot in diameter at the bottom ring and 475 feet distant.     The accusation of hoax came fast from those unable to 
say"maybe", and I was asked to take a lie detector test.  Again theridicule was hurled toward me and yet another lie detector test.     As t
he controversy swirled, I began to hear preposterous talesbeing spread by the debunkers about devil parties and "ultimatepranks," etc.  Thos
e of you who know me will certainly laugh at such claims, but the object was to discredit me in the eyes of those who don't know me.  There 
was a very serious attempt  to destroymy reputation by twisting spooky party games into ritual seances.Having failed to discredit the photog
raphic evidence, the out oftown critics have mounted a slander campaign hoping to brand me.Thank you Gulf Breeze for ignoring these outrageo
us rumors.     Some of you may remember the front page headline "Expertsays Photos a Hoax."  The next day the "expert" publicly retractedhis
 claim and apologized.  A counterintelligence agency inMaryland was given an audio tape of me being interviewed.  Theresulting examination o
f the tape on a PSE (Psychological StressEvaluator) vindicated my word once more when the examiner said the result "does not show any reacti
on to cause this examinerto doubt his (Ed's) answers."     Soon I began to understand that no matter how many tests Iwas subjected to and ho
w many times the photographs wereanalyzed, I was still open game for the out of town media and clearly a target to be ridiculed by the out o
f town debunkers.  Many distant newspapers and TV crews played "hide and seek"with reporting the accurate details, and several times I haveb
een blackmailed in their quest for a scoop to expose my name.     The official MUFON investigation was even infiltrated earlyby a debunker w
ho took a liquid sample suspected to have fallenfrom the UFO for analysis only to issue a false report.  Later thesample was analyzed by an 
independant lab with startling results.The debunker was exposed and fired in discredit.  Anotherdebunker from Central Florida has recently b
een exposed and isnow being ignored by serious researchers.     From Nov. 11 to May 1, 1988 (my last sighting), I have been stedfast to the 
truth as the storm of controversy, both positiveand negative, continued to build in the media.  The mosttroublesome question of the controve
rsy is "Why have I had somany sightings?"  I can not explain the "why" questions, the mostdisturbing one being, "Why Me?"     In an effort t
o understand, I have undergone a battery of pshchological profile tests followed by six hours of regressivehypnosis.  The details of the hyp
nosis indicate previous encountersas far back as 11 years of age.  I was the first to shake my headin confusion but have come to the adjustm
ent that life goes on--even life we may not understand.     Thanks to all those who have stood up and reported what theysaw.  Thank you, Gul
f Breeze for being a good neighbor.------------------------------------------------------------------GULF BREEZE UFO FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE 
PERSPECTIVE                 BY DONALD M. WARE     During the past year, many residents in and around Gulf Breeze,FL have been part of a uniq
ue experience in this country.  Over a hundred people reported objects that we could not identify asplanes, planets, flares, etc..  Some rep
orted seeing alien beings,and six reported blue beams coming from the UFO.  One respectedGulf Breeze family had 22 encounters with UFOs, inc
luding 18 separate photographic sessions.  These sessions produced 41 photographs of at least five different types of flying objects.  Fived
ifferent cameras were used providing sufficient data to determinethe size of some objects.  For example, one object photographed on 1 May 19
88 was 14.8 (misprint?) feet high and had a light onthe bottom that was 14.8 feet in diameter.  I have seen over60 photos of UFOs from this 
area.     Investigations by Newspapers, TV and the Mutual UFO Networkwere generally accomplished without ridicule.  This encouraged12 people
 to tell of their UFO experiences that involved "missingtime" or extremely strange dreams.  Some of these people arehaving trouble coping wi
th their experiences. MUFON establisheda support group including abductees, investigators, and a clinicalpsychologist to help reduce fear of
 the unknown.  I think thesupport efforts, including time-regression hypnosis, have helpedseveral who seem to have been inside a UFO underst
and theirstrange experiences.     I suspect that the increasing national media coverage of theUFO phenomenon, spurred by the Gulf Breeze pho
tos and sightingswill cause many more abductees to gain the courage to talk abouttheir experiences.  Perhaps some will seek help in understa
ndingwhat happened to them.  I hope investigators and psychologistsacross the country will work together to provide this help.     Some peop
le have been unable to fully accept the reality ofalien visitors, including some "armchair investigators."  Perhapsthe Gulf Breeze photos wi
ll help people across the country acceptthe reality described in the MJ-12 documents and other governmentdisclosures. ----------------------
----------------------------------------------TO CELEBRATE OR NOT TO CELEBRATE           BY DUANE COOK     How do you celebrate the annivers
ary of an event you arenot yet sure was good?     Well, maybe celebrate is not the appropriate term.     Perhaps reminisce is a better word 
to apply to our thoughtsand activities on this 1st anniversary of the now famous UFOsightings by "Ed" and others in and around Gulf Breeze. 
    Initially we had no idea that printing Ed's photos would causesuch a worldwide interest in our fair community.     First, there were the
 wire services that broke the newsworldwide with a brief account of the first sightings.     Then came the National Enquirer with their offe
r to pay forthe right to print the photos if NASA Scientists found themgenuine.     MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) got involved in the investiga
tionearly and became the authority to which the explosion of localsightings were referred.     Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist unde
r contract withthe Navy, did the most extensive research on the Gulf Breeze sightings and photographs and has pronounced them real forlack o
f any evidence to the contrary.     And now we find ourselves contemplating why Gulf Breeze?     Is it because they (the UFOs) knew Ed would
 share his photoswith the whole town via the Sentinel and subsequently the local TVstations?     Or is it because Ed lives here and they (th
e UFOs) just followedhim here to continue their interaction with him as they have doneat eight year intervals since he was a child?     And 
what about the many other sightings we've had?  Is it justcoincidence that Charlie and Doris saw the same craft on the samenight that Ed pho
tographed it, thus assuring the Sentinel'sunflinching support while maintaining its unquestioned credibility?     Then there are the ministe
rs, the teachers, the law enforcementofficers, the district medical examiner and his wife, and even a citycouncil member.     Were these peo
ple just randomly in the right place at theright time, or is there an intelligent plan guiding the selection ofwho sees it and who doesn't? 
    Whether we call it a celebration, a reminiscence, or a review,we all found it amazing that it's already been a whole year since it all s
tarted.     And we wanted to share with you our thoughts and reflectionson this most interesting year. -------------------------------------
