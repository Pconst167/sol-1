SKEPTICS  ASIDE,  RUSSELL WOMAN,  OTTAWA DOCTOR CERTAIN OF  ALIEN
VISITS

By R.E. Ramcharan
Hays Daily News

     RUSSELL--Exactly what several dozen citizens saw or hoped to
see  in  the night sky over Russell County Feb.  24 may never  be
known for certain.
     What is known is that one woman claims to have been  invited
aboard alien ships on several occasions, and several people claim
to have been followed or chased by unidentified flying objects.
     In  a  story published that day in the Russell  Daily  News,
Donna  Butts,  36,  Russell,  said  that large numbers  of  alien
spaceships  would  appear in the sky after dark "so  people  will
know they are here, and that they do exist."
     In  fact,  according  to Russell Daily News  reporter  Irene
Jepsen, nothing happened.  Jepsen and three friends spent much of
that night driving around Russell County, watching for the ships.
She saw "a lot of activity."
     But,  she  added,  "I  did not at any time think  they  were
anything but ordinary aircraft."
     Several  people called her after that night with accounts of
UFO  sightings,  including one man who said he was sitting  in  a
pickup  with his wife and children in a field north of the  city.
Jepsen  said  he  claimed that at about 9:45 p.m.  a  cluster  of
lights  came out of a gully and headed for the  truck.   When  he
turned on his headlights, the apparition vanished.
     The next day,  Jepsen said,  "I did go to the area and there
was  nothing to see.   As far as marks on the ground,  there  was
nothing."
     Another  woman  claimed  that she had seen a  UFO  near  the
Pioneer exit,  about 5 miles east of here, Jepsen said.  That UFO
was described as a "strobe light" traveling northwest.
     None  of  these people are willing to say publicly who  they
are  and  what they saw.   Nor has anyone called  Russell  County
Sheriff Robert L. Balloun.
     Balloun said he was aware of the rumored sightings,  but, he
said,  "We  haven't  had any reports of anything unusual  in  the
county at all.  It's been pretty quiet; we'd like to keep it that
way.
     "I  did  have  a deputy out that night  and  he  didn't  see
anything  at  all.   Apparently some people can see it  and  some
people can't."
     That  so  many  people  claim to have  seen  UFOs  does  not
surprise Philip Klass, a contributing editor to Aviation Week and
Space  Technology  magazine  and a member of  the  Committee  for
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.
     "There is a psychological impact," Klass said in a telephone
interview  from his home in Washington.   "I have often said that
if  I could get the Washington Post to publish a story that  UFOs
had been sighted over Washington,  I can guarantee that 20 or  30
people will call in the next day to report that they,  too,  have
seen it.
     "Some  of them may really have seen something--others,  sort
of a 'me, too' effect.  If the Post, or any newspaper, follows up
with another story saying UFOs have been sighted over  Washington
or  Hays or wherever again last night,  then more people,  again,
not kooks, but just curious people, will go out looking."
     In 22 years of investigating UFO reports, Klass said, he has
yet to find one whose explanation was aliens from another planet.
     "Any person who will stand outside at night on a clear night
for two or three hours,  I can guarantee they will see  something
they  cannot identify or explain.   It may be a meteor  fireball.
It  may  be reentering space debris.   It may be  an  advertising
airplane.   It  may be a (Strategic Air Command) aircraft engaged
in refueling maneuvers."
     Butts  was one of two people quoted in the  Dec.  13,  1988,
edition of the grocery store tabloid Weekly World News.  "They're
coming!  Space alien invasion only three years away, says top UFO
expert," read the headline.
     A  recent  issue  of the newspaper  featured  the  headline,
"Space alien baby found on Mt. Everest" on the front page.
     In  the December story,  Butts was quoted as saying she  had
been  in contact with the aliens since 1984 and that  the  visits
were connected with prophecies scattered throughout the Bible.
     She  refuses  to  meet with reporters,  but in  a  telephone
interview  she said that she had been receiving messages from  an
alien named Peter or Cephas.
     "Peter  called himself a multidimensional being," she  said.
She described him as being 6 feet tall, with silver hair and blue
eyes, about 60 years old--"nice build, not great, but nice."
     On several occasions,  she said she had been invited  aboard
the alien's spaceships.
     "They take hold of you,  and they have this little black box
on  the  right side of their belt.   Then they push a  couple  of
buttons and next thing you know, you're aboard the ship."
     Once  aboard,  she  said,  the aliens told her about  future
events,   among   them   an  impending  collapse  of   the   Bush
administration  that  would result  in  Sen.  Bob  Dole,  R-Kan.,
becoming the next president.
     Klass was skeptical.
     "See if you can find out what horse is going to run first at
Hialeah tomorrow," he said.
     Also  quoted  in the Weekly World News was Ottawa  physician
Scott  Corder.   In a telephone interview,  he said Peter was  an
"Amorcan," one of 70 species of aliens now visiting Earth.   They
came  to  Russell,  he said,  because it is the focal point of  a
"transmutational channel" that covers much of Kansas.
     "It's  some  kind  of an entry point that  has  to  do  with
electromagnetic  fields  that  allows them to gain entry  to  our
plane of existence," he said.
     "They  want to focus some attention to  that  area,  because
it`s significant to them for prophecy."
     The  prophecies are scattered throughout the  Bible,  Corder
said.   Many  are connected with the Book of Revelation and  deal
with the end of the world.
     Corder  added  that Peter/Cephas is the same person  as  the
apostle, Saint Peter.
     Monday,  the  state Board of Healing Arts suspended Corder's
license to practice medicine for his public statements about  the
aliens.
     Ted Schultz, a writer on unconventional beliefs, is familiar
with  similar  accounts.   His  book,  "The Fringes  of  Reason,"
examines  a number of fringe social phenomena,  including  flying
saucer religions.
     "It's  interesting that this case combines both  things--the
classic '50's contactee and the abduction," he said.
     During the 1950s,  people claimed to have been contacted  by
alien beings, often with predictions of future events or messages
for the rest of the world.
     "It's  hard  to take any particular one at face  value,"  he
said.  "It seems to me that, as far as the question of whether to
actually  believe  them or not,  the fact that hundreds of  these
predictions that have never come true works against it."
     Abduction,  the notion that people are kidnapped by  aliens,
has been around almost since the first science fiction novels.  A
ghoulish  twist,  that  the aliens conduct experiments  on  their
prisoners, surfaced in 1968 with John Fuller's book, "Interrupted
Journey."  Similar accounts have recently been on the best seller
lists.
     "Now  it's  a  big  thing," Schultz  said.   "It  tells  you
something about human nature and the human mind,  a lot more than
it tells you about visitors from outer space."
