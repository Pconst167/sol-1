I could write a book on this and, indeed others have.   Is  China  3rd  world?
Mainland  China  has a UFO organization run by someone named Sun.  It began in
1979 as an underground movement and obtained millions of members.  Today  it's
membership is approximately 41,000,000.  Yes, that's right, forty-one MILLION.
That would be like a UFO organization with 8.5 million in the US - think about
it.

I just spoke with a gentleman from Peru.  He showed me a photo, taken in 1982,
of  a  9 foot tall, and rather skinny, ET that was published on the cover of a
major news magazine in Peru.  On April 13, 1991, a man that is  in  telepathic
communication  with ETs was challenged to prove it, so they got all the major,
and some not so major, news organizations in Peru to go to a place  along  the
coast  (I've  got the details at home in my notes) and, at the appointed time,
no craft showed up.  Many of the news people got drunk and made a  big  scene,
so the ETs didn't show up.  So,  a handful of reporters stuck it out and then,
the next night (it was a Sunday - April 14), at the same time they  were  sup-
posed  to  show up on Saturday, 3 extraterrestrial craft appeared overhead for
20 minutes, during which time they took lots of video, stills and so on.  This
was  shown as the main lead on ALL the TV channels in Peru.  It was the front-
page story on ALL of the morning newspapers in Peru.  It was  on  ALL  of  the
covers  of  the major magazines in Peru.  It played on most all of the Spanish
language TV channels here in the U.S.  Now think about it for a  moment.   Why
did OUR news organizations cover it up unless they are being controlled by our
government - the same government that  brought  us  free  and  open  (snicker,
snicker) reporting of the, so-called, Gulf War.  The highway, along the coast,
where this incident in Peru took place has so many UFOs, all  the  time,  that
the  government  has  put  up  a  road  sign  that  alerts motorists not to be
frightened if they see a UFO.  I am told that UFOs are such a common sight  in
Peru,  that  people do not pay a lot of attention to them.  In addition to all
this, a while back, an ET from somewhere, showed up and made 3,000 color draw-
ings  each  with  detailed written explanations as to the true history of this
planet.  They are on 3' x 3.5' papers.  I have seen  copies  of  8.   So,  the
Peruvians  now  have  the entire history of planet earth, including all the ET
influences.  One wonders why they chose the Peruvians, and not  the  so-called
"free"  nations?   Finally,  there  are  NO abductions that anyone knows of in
Peru.  Apparently, the United States Secret Government is the only  government
stupid enough to trade their own citizens for extraterrestrial technology that
sometimes works (to take over the world?).  Think about ....  a road sign?

Similar things are happening in Mexico.  I have had friends report to me  that
the U.S. Spanish language TV news programs report UFOs all the time in Mexico.
There is a place 1.5 hours outside of Mexico City where people go and  applaud
when  they  see UFOs.  It's a party and festive-like atmosphere there on week-
ends.  People see as many as 20 in a day there.

I know of similar stories in Brazil.

The crashes in South Africa have been  recovered  by  our  "Blue"  team  (blue
berets  -  UFO  crash  recovery team - go anywhere [even if it means violating
other countries sovereignty] - leave any time - be anybody [they can appear as
NASA,  CIA, the local police or military, or even Danish and/or Norwegian hel-
icopter pilots out on a training mission, like they did recently in the  Cali-
fornia  mountains  near  a  little town called Uncle Tom's Cabin]).  This hap-
pened, also, in the place I mentioned above in Mexico.

Puerto Rico - not 3rd world - has ETs walking along the streets  freaking  out
residents  of certain towns near Lake Cartegena.  This information could cover
2 or 3 books.  There  is  a  monthly  publication,  in  Spanish,  if  you  are
interested.  I think it's called Inigma.

Many UFOs are concerned with nuclear stuff.  So,  wherever  there  is  nuclear
something  (power  plants,  weapons, etc), there will be UFOs nearby.  Not too
many of that stuff in developing nations of planet earth.  UFOs also  seem  to
like to be around high power lines - something about radar invisibility.

There is so much.  Just keep turning over more stones, look under more bushes,
and  you will find a plethora of information.  Go to conferences.  Read books.
Talk to people.  It's there if you want to take  the  time  to  seek  it  out.
Ultimately,  our  glorious  government  WILL  make an announcement.  John Lear
seems to think it will be in October of this year.  My fingers are crossed.

I`m going on vacation to check out the conference in Denver,  then  onto  Fyfe
and Gulf Breeze.  So, please, save any email to me until the 3rd week of June.
Thank you.
