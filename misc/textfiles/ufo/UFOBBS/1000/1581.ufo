The next time you have one of those UFO sightings...in addition to looking at
the UFO...note the time...direction...and stick your arm out straight forward
toward the object with hand up fingers apart palm outward.  Those aliens will
think your waving at them.  In reality you will be comparing the size of the
craft to the size of your fingernails and determining the azimuth of the craft
by seeing how many outstretched hands you can put between the horizon and the
craft.

Your little finger nail isabout the size of an aspirin....and when aimed at
the moon will just about cover it.  The size of your thumb nail is twice that
size.  By knowing the distance from your eyes to your outstretched hand (take
a yard stick and measure it)...and estimating the distance between you and the
object...and using a little trigonometry, it is possible for you to determine
the size of the object.  Knowing the size of the object can be very helpful in
the field investigation to follow.
