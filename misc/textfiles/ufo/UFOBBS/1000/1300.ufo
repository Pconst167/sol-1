SUBJECT: ILLINOIS SIGHTING REPORT - MUFON                    FILE: UFO1300


Log #890302 - Event 5/10/88, New Haven, IL: duration, 3-4 seconds.  Lead 
investigator Francis Ridge.  A missile-shaped vehicle 25 feet long, light 
grey in color, with a slightly turned-up nose, stabilizing wings at the rear, 
and a reddish ring at the middle, cruised 50-100 feet above the ground at 
"tremendous speed" a few hundred feet from the witness.  One possible 
explanation, a Tomahawk cruise missile (strikingly similar in appearance), 
brought forward by Fran.  This would postulate that a test firing (from an 
unknown point) had gone awry.  An FOIA request for additional information is 
being pursued.
