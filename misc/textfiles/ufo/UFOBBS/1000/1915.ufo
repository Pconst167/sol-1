Re: ROSWELL INVESTIGATION
St:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I recently received from Dr. Bruce Maccabee a summary of grant
 proposals for the continuing Roswell case investigation. This
 summary is reproduced below for those of you who did not receive
 this inquiry. The names in parentheses are the proposers, dollar
 amounts are estimated Project costs.

 He would like us all to rank order of the following proposals by
 placing a "1" beside the project you think is the most important;
 a "2" next to the second most important, etc.

 The form should then be mailed to:

 Fund for UFO Research
 P.O. Box 277
 Mt. Rainier, MD 20712
 U.S.A.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 ___ Project A -- To conduct further research into UFO
 crash/retrieval cases (Leonard Stringfield): $1,200

 ___ Project B -- To interview six additional witnesses
 (Don Schmitt): $1,700

 ___ Project C -- To conduct hypnosis sessions with known and
 potential witnesses (Stanton Friedman): $15,860

 ___ Project D -- To conduct further research at the Truman and
 Eisenhower Libraries, the Sandia and Los Alamos Laboratories, and
 at the Library of Congress (Stanton Friedman): $6,545

 ___ Project E -- To produce a follow-up videotaped summary of
 witness testimony (Fred Whiting): $500

 ___ Project F -- To bring significant witnesses to Washington, DC,
 for a de-briefing by congressional staff and interviews with media
 representatives (Fred Whiting) $5,700

 Any further suggestions:..............

 My personal order of importance would be F (absolutely!),D,A,C,E,B
