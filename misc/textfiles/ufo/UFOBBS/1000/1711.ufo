Dear Major VonKevicsky:

This is in response to your letter of April 22, 1988 regarding the
declassification of Coast Guard records regarding Unidentified Flying
Objects operations around our coastal waters.

There are no records responsive to your request. This is not a refusal to
disclose information but rather is notification that there is no information to
disclose.

                                        Sincerely,


                                        M. D. SMITH
