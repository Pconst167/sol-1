          SOME BASIC PHYSICS ON ELEMENT CREATION
    (With a view toward the Robert Lazar UFO Revelations)

     The Big Bang apparently created only three elements.  They 
were Hydrogen, Helium and maybe Lithium, and probably some isotopes 
of these three like Deuterium, an isotope of Hydrogen.  Present 
theory is that the "explosion" which also created time and space 
was too rapid to create more heavier elements.  Those theories 
explain very well the observed abundances of Hydrogen & Helium in 
the universe today.
     When stars finally formed, the second phase of element 
creation was started.  The heat and pressure at the core of stars 
produces higher and higher elements.  The energy that the stars 
emit, (heat, light, radiation) comes mainly from this elemental 
fusion reaction at the core.
     Iron is the end however.  Because the creation of elements 
higher than Iron requires energy input rather than produce energy 
output, no significant higher elements are created.
     The final phase of element creation occurs in a supernova.  
The energy concentration is so great that during the explosion, all 
the naturally occurring heavy elements above Iron are created.  
This includes the radioactive elements, and almost certainly higher 
elements not found naturally on earth.  The reason they are not 
found on earth is that they have disappeared through radioactive 
decay over the 5 billion years the earth has existed.

     As for element 115, it remains a real puzzle.  If it can be 
created
naturally, then a supernova explosion would almost certainly have 
created it since they are likely the most energetic entities in the 
universe.  If if couldn't, then I seriously doubt that technology, 
advanced or otherwise, could create it.  Since the earth is a 
product of star core synthesis as well as supernova synthesis, and 
we find no trace of element 115 here, we must form one of the 
following two conclusions.
     A.  Element 115 cannot be created in supernova explosions 
which means that it likely does not occur naturally anywhere in the 
universe.
     B.  Element 115 is much more radioactive than Uranium and has 
disappeared over the 5 billion year history of the earth.
     Conclusion "B" does not necessarily eliminate the use of 
element 115 in UFO propulsion.  (I am trying to give the 
"Revealers" all the slack I can.) Recent "Revelations" indicated 
that element 115 is stable inferring that it is not radioactive and 
that it occurs naturally in heavy star systems.  To a physicist, 
heavy element stability usually means that it doesn't radioactively 
decay in minute fractions of a second.  So, it could be relatively 
stable, but still radioactive, enough so that it does not occur 
naturally on earth.
     The only place that element 115 would occur would be in the 
debris of a recent supernova.  Recent could mean hours or millions 
of years, depending on the stability of the element.  Heavy star 
systems, or binary stars have no properties that I am aware of that 
would make them more likely to contain element 115.  Also, there 
are no known natural processes occurring in these systems that 
could produce element 115.
     After the element is created (naturally in a supernova, or 
unnaturally in a lab), "ordinary" weight, heat, and pressure (or 
lack thereof) would have absolutely no effect on the element.
