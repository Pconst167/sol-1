E.T. first called Earth almost 100 years ago, experts believe.

The researchers believe extraterrestrials from as star system 11 light years
from Earth responded to the first message Guglielmo Marconi sent on his newly
invented wireless transmitter in 1899.

Morconi tapped out the letter "V" to colleagues 50 miles away, but scientists
believe aliens from the Epsilon Eridani star system also received the transm-
ission and replied.

The experts are relying on a series of strange events to prove their theory.

SPACE SIGNALS

In June, 1921, radio stations worldwide reported they were picking up weird 
signals that seemed to come from a specific point in space. All the signals 
were the same - Marconi's coded letter V. Twenty two years passed since the
signal was transmitted.

Two years after Marconi sent his letter V, he made history by sending the 
first radio message across the Atlantic in December , 1901.

The message was the coded letter "S". Again, exactly 22 years later in 1924, 
radio stations began picking up another strange signal from space.

This time it was Marconi's letter "S" that was beamed from space to receivers 
around the globe.

Speculation as to the source of these mysterious signals was popular topic in
scientific circles at the time.

Many researchers began to wonder if an alien civilization was trying to start 
a conversation with us.

Some dismissed the signals as a hoax but they couldn't explain how the alleged
practical jokers had managed to work together in more than 30 countries to 
send imitations of Marconi's signals to hundreds of stations at the same time.

NEW MESSAGE ?

Open minded thinkers, however, saw something more in the events.

For instance, each of Marconi's transmissions was replied to 22 years later.
Could this mean that each signal had traveled for 11 years through space be-
fore an alien receiver picked it up?

And did the aliens respond with a message that took another 11 years to reach
us?

Experts think a possible destination for Marconi's messages - the star system
Epsilon Eridani, which is exactly 11 light years or roughly 60 trillion miles
from Earth.
