      MJ-12 UPDATE
      
      
      ParaNet  Alpha  09/29  --  As  predicted  here,  Citizens Against UFO 
      Secrecy  (CAUS)  has published the most definitive expose' to date on 
      the mysterious MJ-12 documents.
      
      
      According to CAUS, the documents are a hoax.
      
      
      In  the  September  issue  of  the organization's journal JUST CAUSE,  
      editor  Barry  Greenwood  enumerates several points which, taken as a 
      whole,  fairly  conclusively show the documents to be fraudulent. The 
      most  impressive  of  these  has to do with the Top Secret "Executive 
      Order,"  a  document  allegedly signed by then-President Harry Truman 
      authorizing  the formation of the Majestic-12 group. The document was 
      listed  as Attachment "A", "Executive Order #092447", in the Schedule 
      of  Attachments  to  the Hillenkoetter Briefing. The number, "092447" 
      is  not  an  authentic  Executive Order number, but rather represents 
      the  date the order was signed - 9/24/47. CAUS's research at the Tru-
      man  Library  shows  that no EOs were signed that day; that EO's 9891 
      thru  9896 all cover the period in question; that none are missing or 
      out of order; and that none have anything to do with MJ-12 or UFOs.
      
      
      Other  CAUS evidence includes points which have been covered by Para-
      Net,  Saucer  Smear  and  CSICOP, such as the apparent fraudulence of 
      the  Cutler  to  Twining  memo,  the irregular dating format, and the 
      seemingly  shoddy quality of research employed by the Moore-Shandera-
      Friedman  team  (MSF).  CAUS  also  takes  great exception to several 
      other,  ancillary  documents, released by MSF in April, such as a CIA 
      memo  and  a  briefing  paper on "Project Aquarius." They report that 
      MSF  began de-emphasizing these documents over the course of the sum-
      mer,  especially  after  CAUS  confronted William Moore with the evi-
      dence for their fraudulence.
      
      
      But  the  most significant portion of the CAUS newsletter (this issue 
      of  which  is devoted entirely to MJ-12) deals in a discussion of who 
      may  be behind the concoction. ParaNet readers may remember that in a 
      recent  issue  of  Saucer  Smear, Supreme Commander James Moseley an-
      nounced  that he had a "name" that he was investigating in connection 
      with  the Majestic-12 controversy, and that he would release it soon. 
      That  name,  supplied to him by ParaNet, was Col. Richard Doty, Spec-
      ial  Agent,  Air  Force Office of Special Investigations. CAUS editor 
      Greenwood agrees with Moseley's, and our, suspicions. In brief:
      
      
      -  TV  producer  Linda  Howe,  best known for her landmark expose' on 
      cattle  mutilation,  STRANGE  HARVEST,  was contacted by a government 
      source  in  1984 to "aid in producing a documentary, essentially pro-
      viding
