     Welcome to the first issue of Odyssey Online, The official Fringe 
Science Research Newsletter of Odyssey.  I thought the best way to do an 
editorial for the first issue is to give a brief descriptioin of what Odyssey 
is and how Sysops can join our family.  
        I hope you enjoy the first issue of ODYSSEY ONLINE!

±€±€± WHAT IS ODYSSEY? ±€±€±

ODYSSEY is an association of Electronic Bulletin Board Systems dedicated to
the research of "Fringe Science" events in our world.  By Fringe Science we
are referring to the U.F.O. phenoneman, Legendary monsters such as Bigfoot,
Yeti and the Loch Ness Monster, and other paranormal type events such as
ghosts, esp, psychic abilities, etc.  As Charles Forte put it, the scientific
community has chosen to 'damn' information and data concerning fringe science
happenings.  ODYSSEY will attempt to gather, discuss and make public info-
mation in the most timely and  accurate way possible on unusual and fringe
events.

±€±€± HOW IS ODYSSEY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER NETS? ±€±€±

ODYSSEY is different from other Paranormal or Fringe Science nets in the way 
that we use echomail and the all important door programs that add another 
dimension for the user accessing an ODYSSEY Research Board.  EchoMail and 
Doors will be discussed later in this document.  Also, EACH MEMBER SYSOP HAS
A SAY BY WAY OF VOTING ON THE OPERATION OF ODYSSEY.

€±€±€ DEDICATION ±€±€±

ODYSSEY requires that its' member SysOps be dedicated and an active 
participant in the research of fringe science events and in the operation of 
the ODYSSEY Network.  ODYSSEY is not the type of Network where member sysops
can simply throw the ODYSSEY echos on their board for their users and 'let the
chips fall where they may'. ODYSSEY is looking for SysOps that set a high
standard for themselves and their boards. 

±€±€± SYSOP REQUIREMENTS ±€±€±

To become a part of the ODYSSEY Research Team, a SysOp must be willing to 
carry on the following duties:

1) Vote on applications for approval of other Bulletin Board Systems wishing
to join ODYSSEY. 
2) Vote on motions that a member board be removed from the ODYSSEY team for 
any infractions that may have occured in concern with policy and conduct.
3) Vote on ammendments and/or changes within the ODYSSEY network.
4) Be capable of running Bulletin Board External Door programs.  This is an 
essential part on becoming a member of ODYSSEY!
5) Participate in the echos and report, through the SKYWATCH echo any UFO 
related activity they might encounter.
6) Echomail Compatible.

±€±€± ECHOMAIL - TAG NAMES, DESCRIPTIONS AND ACCESS LEVELS ±€±€±

The following is a list of Echomail areas that the member SysOp MUST carry on 
their board to be considered a member and enjoy benefits of that membership.

AREA TAG NAME: BAMA
ACCESS LEVEL : Open to the general public.
THEME        : BAMA is the UFO echo for ODYSSEY.  Any user that wishes to 
               discuss the UFO phenoneman and related topics in a constructive 
               manner may access this echo.
MODERATOR    : Jerry Woody

AREA TAG NAME: MONSTERS
ACCESS LEVEL : Open to the general public.
THEME        : MONSTERS is an echo on ODYSSEY that discusses legendary 
               monsters.  This includes Bigfoot, Yeti, Loch Ness Monster, etc.
               Also discussed are monsters that are in old and modern 
               literature that may have a basis of fact. An example of this 
               would be the Grendel from the epic Beowulf.
MODERATOR    : John Feilke

AREA TAG NAME: UNKNOWN
ACCESS LEVEL : John Hrusovsky
THEME        : UNKNOWN is a discussion echo on ODYSSEY that deals with fringe 
               science topics (esp,ghost,paranormal,psychic,etc) that doesn't 
               fit in on the BAMA or MONSTERS echo.
MODERATOR    : -OPEN- : Taking Applications

AREA TAG NAME: CLIPPINGS
ACCESS LEVEL : Open to the general public.
THEME        : CLIPPINGS is an echo on ODYSSEY that is used ONLY in the 
               posting of News Clippings, Upcoming conventions or events, 
               Upcoming television shows or Radio programs that are related to 
               the fringe sciences.  THIS ECHO IS NOT A DISCUSSION ECHO BUT AN 
               ECHO DEALING ONLY WITH ANNOUNCEMENTS AND NEWS CLIPPINGS. The 
               clippings may then be discussed on BAMA,MONSTERS OR UNKNOWN 
               echos.
MODERATOR    : NONE/Jerry Woody

AREA TAG NAME: SKYWATCH
ACCESS LEVEL : Open to the general public - RESTRICTED FOR FORM UFO SIGHTINGS 
               AND RELATED UFO PHENONEMAN REPORTING.
THEME        : SKYWATCH is an echo on ODYSSEY that is used ONLY for the 
               posting of UFO sighting reports, Animal Mutilation Reports,
               Crop Circle Reports and Abduction Reports.  Users and Sysops 
               making UFO related reports should fill out the plain ascii form
               (provided in sysop package) and upload it in the SKYWATCH echo.
               Sysops should make these blank forms available to the user for
               download on their systems and encourage users to take an active
               part in investigating UFO reports and reporting them on 
               SKYWATCH.
MODERATOR    : NONE/Jerry Woody

AREA TAG NAME: SYSOP_ORPHAN
ACCESS LEVEL : Open ONLY to the families of ODYSSEY SysOps.
THEME        : SYSOP_ORPHAN is an echo on ODYSSEY that is a 'support' echo for 
               the families (Wives,Husbands,Boyfriend,Girlfriend,Mothers,
               Fathers,Children) of the ODYSSEY Sysop.  Lets' face it, running
               a Bulletin Board can put a strain on family life.  This echo is
               intended to get the rest of the family or friends, not 
               necessarily interested in the Fringe Science Research or the 
               actual operations of a bulletin board, a place to chit-chat and
               discuss whatever they want too.  Like a big pen pal echo.  
MODERATOR    : Kathy Puckett

AREA TAG NAME: ODYSSEUS
ACCESS LEVEL : ODYSSEY SysOps ONLY.
THEME        : ODYSSEUS is an echo on ODYSSEY restricted to ODYSSEY sysop use
               only.  Here technical questions about the doors may be asked,
               Policy decisions discussed, operational decisions discussed,
               Results of Votes Posted, Applications from other BBS's posted
               to be voted on, etc.
MODERATOR    : Jerry Woody

AREA TAG NAME: OD_FREQ
ACCESS LEVEL : Open to the general public in the READ ONLY mode.
THEME        : This echo is ONLY for the announcement arrival of new ODYSSEY
               fringe science files available to download. Each sysop should 
               be able to run the following echo file programs:
             --TICKET or TIC as it is commonly reffered to with its associated
               program HATCH.  
             --KDSN which is a file arrival announcer that will put an 
               echomail message concerning the file in the OD_FREQ echo area.
               More on this as new sysops come online.
             --PLEASE NOTE: Tic,Hatch and KDSN is not a requirement on 
               becoming an ODYSSEY sysop.  If you have a file to be hatched
               on the network simply send them to me at 1:3607/20 and I will
               put them on the network for you.

In England the crop circle season is now over as just about all fields
have been harvested. Recent events have brought about details of a
ministerial meeting in London about a year ago when Margaret Thatcher
was still PM.(though she was not present at the meeting).The purpose
of the meeting was to discuss Crop Circles and three ministeries were
involved in this namely Defence, Agriculture and Environment.
It was agreed at this meeting that the cause of Crop Circles was completely
unknown and and the meteological theory was *out of hand* and that all 
crop circles were *not* hoaxes although there had obviously been a fair
few hoaxes.
Responsibility for keeping a watch on crop circle developments was handed
over to the Ministry of Defence whose brief was to take *appropriate action*.
The MOD were to update the other two ministries but during this meeting
the word "disinformation" was mentioned on several occasions.The above
details were passed on by someone who attended the meeting.
During the last few weeks it appears as if this disinformation campaign
has actually started by the arrival of Dave and Doug. There is at present
no way of finding out who is behind the disinformation campaign but it is
certainly being seen to happen.The newspaper "Today" has now produced two
gents in the 60's who claim to have been creating crop circles for the last
13 years.They can obviously only fool a few people with these claims as even
if all crop circles were hoaxes two people of any age would not be able to 
create formations all over the English countryside let alone the world.
The assertation by the Today newspaper, famous for quoting that the 1990
pictogram at Alton Barnes was a Sumarian warning to double your wells as
there was going to be a drought,(could have been mistaken for oil wells
in the Gulf that needed the warning), that this explains the crop circle
phenomenon is absurd.
The scam relied largely on catching one of the leading Circles experts in
a trap which was carefully laid for him. This was undertaken by a informing
Pat Delgado that a strange crop circle formation had appeared in a field in
Sevenoaks, Kent, England, the paper said they believed it to be a hoax and
that the farmer also was sure it was a hoax. They asked if Pat D would give
a professional opinion.
Pat Delgado agreed and travelled to Ightham near Sevenoaks and was taken to
see the formation which, to his amazement, was an "insectogram" formation
closely resembling the ones in the Hampshire in June and July of this year.
All the features were present of the usual "insectogram" although imperfect
but Pat D gave his unqualified blessing which was recorded on tape and he
was filmed in the formation by a camera crew in a helicopter. The trap had
closed in on him.
The Today newspaper then waited until Sunday before bringing two alleged
hoaxers, Dave and Doug to Pat Delgado's house.There they confronted him
with a film taken of the two hoaxers making the formation in Kent that
Pat D had said was genuine.They claimed to have been faking circles for
13 years near Winchester and so on..Pat Delgado had to then make any
concessions that the Today newspaper demended of him. It is interesting
to find that at a later stage of the confrontation Colin Andrews appeared
and fought back by cross-questioning Doug and Dave. He soon found that
they were unable to answer many questions and their minders withdrew them
before their case was badly damaged.
Obviously at the stage the irreparable damage had been done to Pat Delgado's
reputation but nevertheless no concrete evidence had been presented that
Dave and Doug had faked any other known circle or pictogram apart from the
bogus one at Kent which has been conveniently removed in the meantime by
harvesting. The two appeared on TV on Monday to demonstrate to the press
and the TV how they create such a formation in a wheatfield in Chilgrove,
Sussex.The dumb-bell formation which they produced was a pathetic mess and
could be clearly seen on TV as such although the two hoaxers complained
that was due to over-ripe wheat.
The story in the Today Newspaper originated from a shadowy outfit called
"MBF Services" who suplied the story to Today and have doubtlessly paid
Dave and Doug, also indemnifying them against all lawsuits and claims
of criminal damage from Hampshire farmers.
MBF Services have been tracked down to an accomodation address in
Shepton Mallet near Bristol, England and are registered clients of an
expensive up-market firm of accountants, Barclay Jackson. All attempts
to identify the people behind MBF Services have failed and the Today will
either side-step or remain silent. The firm of accountants describe their
clients as a "scientific research and development" company but obviously
what or whoever is behind this front has a great deal of financial backing.
Undoubtedly this is infact a well organised and long planned attempt to
rubbish the crop circle phenomenon and may even turn out to be
government-inspired but when the 1992 season brings its new crop then
this fiasco will end.
I have personally met both Dave and Doug about 2 years ago at the site of
of a formation near Winchester. Dave is retired and has a hobby of recording
bird songs on a portable tape machine. He told me,whilst at the side of the
A272 main road that passes by Cheesefoot Head Winchester,that he had been
wandering through some crop fields recording bird songs back in the 1970's
when he came across a flattened swirled area of corn. A bit amazed he
wandered around the formation trying to ascertain what it was and unknowingly
left his tape recording. Basically when he played back the tape after he had
been in the crop circle he heard voices on a tape which was a brand new tape
previously, the voices were not heard whilst he was alone in the formation
but nevertheless he claimed he recognised the voices as a converstion he had 
had 30 years previously. I am not sure how he knows this or even if I believe
what he told me but it kinda shows he did not hoax crop circles back then
and was very enthusiastic about the crop circle we were by at the time and
could offer no explaination of how it had been created.
Doug was the more genial of the two he said at the time, back in 1990,
that he "could just imagine them [UFO's] darting between two clouds", that
were at the time directly over Winchester, "and creating a crop circle"
The day was very overcast and the clouds were the dark grey variety we get
quite a bit in the UK but there was a bright gap between two of these.
He definatley gave me the impression he was interested in UFO's and the
like and said to have taken photographs of crop circles (plain circles)
back as far as tha mid 70's but I never saw any of these.
One thing that really struck me is that they were not very pleased with
either Pat Delgado or Colin Andrews as they believe they (PD and CA) had
not given Don Tuesley, one of the original crop circle researchers, any
thanks for his help in the then current book "Circular Evidence". Dave
and Doug believed that the fame had gone to both Pat Delgado's and Colin
Andrews heads and that they did not give anyone else any credit for help
they received. I know both Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews and totally
disagree that this is the case as they go out of their way to credit any
photos or information received from anyone. I have had the privilege of
having a mention in their book "Crop Circles- The latest Evidence" for
finding the first pictogram, although Pat D seems to call me Bob and adds
an extra L. I am not alone in being credited with information or photos
as one can see in their books.
Sorry to waffle a bit but my opinion is that Dave and Doug are off their
trolley and I do not believe all crop circles are hoaxes by "D+D hoaxes"
or not. There is a genuine phenomenon and it is not a vortex, note that
D+D never claimed to have created any formations in Wiltshire.
PS. If you see a grey Nissan Sunny by the side of a field with two gents
in their 60's in it thats Dave and Doug hoaxers extraordinaire.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kuthumi, I surround myself with Love and Light and request that you
send me a transmission this evening. What message do you with to
deliver to the United Nations group on October 15, 1990?
Dearest daughter in the Light of the Most Radiant One. I, Kuthumi,
come through this frequency this evening to honor you and your
assignment to speak to a most distinguished group at the World
Headquarters for Peace. I am honored to address this gathering of
individuals, for this is a first time in the history of your modern
civilization that we have been granted the opportunity to address such
a distinguished audience with the dignity and respect for which we
have yearned. We are gathered in the chambers of the Tribunal Council
Assembly Hall on board the Starship Phoenix to witness an historic
moment in the history of humankind.
We move with much precision and deliberation to assure there will be
no room for error in the receiving of this transmission. So let us
begin.
The tribute we first wish to being to our sons and daughters of planet
Earth is a salute from the Most Radiant One, Sananda. We motion to all
that we understand and witness the yearning in your hearts for the
return of the Highest Being that has yet graced the surface of your
beloved Terra. We hail from the seventh dimensional ethers to first
speak to your hearts and then to your minds, for it is in the
receiving of these words with your hearts, that Sananda wishes you to
know that His love and devotion will soon be felt by all to an even
greater intensity then what you presently witness.
The message we bring is a collective one from the Tribunal Council of
the Galactic Command. It brings the gifts of love and peace to all who
hear the words and understand the truths that are inherent within the
lines. We have collectively prepared this message to help you
understand the depth and the breadth of the importance of these words,
for it is in the collective that we have formulated the direction
towards which we hope humanity will turn in the coming decade of the
nineties.
Before we begin, look around you, Oh Children of Terra, and focus on
the goodness and Light within each soul. See the surrender of the ego
to the Godself within, and know that when your inner eye sees this
radiance in all, you are on the path to the Light and the ascended
realms. Measure everyone with the rod of goodness and perceive the
darkness not, for it is in the sight from restored eyes that you will
soon be able to see the beautiful Light within yourselves, as well.
The world faces difficult times ahead, as we measure the direction of
the ethers. In this situation you must believe that no future is
secure except that which you alone create. You have the power in the
collective and in the singular to change any direction for the fate of
the Earth. As you move with quiet surrender and focus your hearts on
the Light and love of Sananda, know with much assurance that you will
not be disappointed. His radiance is everywhere and will soon be
prevalent even among those who do not understand or sense Him today.
The physical structure in which you are meeting is situated on a
global ley line that is synchronized with several power spots on your
planet. It also connects many sacred energy points in the etheric, as
well. The positioning of this Center for Peace was not accidental in
its design and construction, for in the universal plan for peace this
location was deemed to be of great importance.
What this means for you and the direction for the world is that the
window of time has been placed in the country of the United States of
America. The mirror for this realization is found in the beloved
capital city you call Washington, D.C. Have you never wondered, oh
children, why the Washington Monument contains the pyramid on its
structure? Have you never wondered why the great symbol of this same
structure was placed on your medium for exchange, which is what has
given you power till this present time? Can you not see that these
symbols are deliberate and that they are impressed in your essence to
connect you to your etheric roots, which are situated in another area
of your globe?
For the world, the Center for Peace mirrors the power of your great
capital city. These two energy vortexes contain the power to direct
the future of humankind. On one vortex sits the capital for world
governments that can control the balance of power of the people. On
the other vortex sits the capital of the people, which controls the
power for the vortex of the world. In this mirroring effect comes the
choice for all of you in the future race for time. Who will rule the
direction of your planet as the sands of the Sahara run through the
hour glass of time? Will it be the government of the people or the
people's government?
This question must be asked and pondered in the decade to come, for
the answer will change the future and the events that will befall. May
we, as the collective voice of the Tribunal Council, suggest that if
this question is answered from the heart and not the mind, a clearer
picture on the horizon for all will be seen. We state that if you
ponder the direction with your heart and feel its quiet voice guide
you that you will experience the confidence and peace for which you
yearn.
Truth is always in the heart. It is the sacred potent that directs
each and all to the highest forms of consciousness and the law. It
takes the darkness which surrounds the soul and brings in the Light of
freedom. It moves the mountains and positions them in ways where new
mysteries are discovered by all.
We, on the ascended realms , await the time when the children of Earth
do freely choose freedom and truth over the constraints of bondage. We
await for the moments of triumph when the masses will no longer cry
for the relief of the Most Radiant One. We have compassion for those
who do not see with eyes of clear vision. We know that in the pain and
the waiting there is also joy, for in the Oneness of the Creator all
is contained within.
The choices that will have to be made in the next decade will be those
that will bring either great hardships or delights to the people of
Earth. They will challenge all to know their values and limits, for
the forces that manifest both fear and love will be intensified. In
the moments or trial, oh dear ones, know what only love can win out
over darkness and fear. Know that the vibration of the Light is the
highest frequency there is and that this vibration will consume all of
the darkness. Understand that the trials are only those which you
impose upon yourselves, and work to discipline your minds and hearts
to follow the higher agenda of the Godforce.
We will assist any soul who comes forth in courage and dedication to
raise its vibrations to that of love and Light. We will bring the
gifts of the Magi to any who establishes a frequency of strength
through visualizing the Light within their essence and physical
structures. Know that you are guided always and that you do not walk
alone, for your elder sisters and brothers on the higher realms are
forever watching and protecting all who seek our strength. This is so!
Work first on yourselves and then seek to find the goodness in others.
Should you do so, you will find that this mirroring effect will result
in the perfection of both your inner and outer sight. Use this
technique then to being the peace and fulfillment of God's plan to the
world, for it is through your consciousness that the world will be
shaped.
You understand not the power you contain within your own essence. You
understand not the fortitude and strength that you really do command.
Many give their power away to those who deserve it not, only because
the strength of another's convictions is stronger than their own.
The contests of change and control manifest through the strength of
the will. These situations manifest through the intensity of the
emotions you exhibit. Know that your strength of commitment to change
is only as strong as your dedication to do so. If you choose to
acknowledge our words as truth, then you shall quickly discover that
your power has no limits.
We await to assist you on your journey to transform the Earth into a
Garden of Eden in the galaxy. We only wait to be asked. Know that
through our strength and support that the mountains will be moved and
that the streams will be purified. Believe in your hearts that the
animal kingdom will once again be free and that the birds will fly
with grace and spirit, should you begin the journey of bringing all
kingdoms back into the higher thought realms.
We see on the horizon the potential for the children of Earth to make
the desired changes for peace and prosperity. We do not, however, see
the commitment or awareness of our presence in your hearts, that we
are here to assist you. We have been waiting for a long time to assist
you on your Earth journey, and now proclaim we are here to do so. In
this proclamation we only wait for you to ask.
Many ask why we do not show ourselves to you in the physical form at
your beckoning. Others wonder why we do not speak to them. We tell you
that we are with all of you in your daily lives and that your sight
need only be opened with the changing of your frequencies, for in the
twinkling of an eye you can command the power to see and to know of
our presence.
The Galactic Command presently resides on a frequency that is higher
than that of Earth's. It is a vibrational measurement that speaks to
the refinement of the ethers. In this other dimension, we see and hear
the lower frequencies, but you believe that you do not have the power
to see us. Should you choose to refine your paths and individual
vibrational frequencies to match that of ours, which is closer to the
speed of Light, then you too will command the power of inner and outer
sight.
Each of us selected to accelerate our own paths in former incarnations
on your beloved planet. We have learned the curriculum of the Earth
and were granted the privilege of journeying to the higher realms of
consciousness. This provides us now with the opportunity to work with
each of you to help all who wish to journey to our home. We admit
those with the compatible frequency that allows the qualities of love
and Light to emanate form their souls. We call all to our home, but
only few are chosen, for it is you who do the choosing.
The choices you will collectively and singularly make in the decade to
come will be difficult for some and easy for others. The choices will
guarantee your futures and that of the planet's. You will see with
greater clarity the truths of what we impart this day, in the months
and years to come. Then you will know that our presence is real.
Should you turn inward to your heart you will know today that we are
with you always. Should you scoff and ignore, then you will prolong
the pain and the yearning for the return of the Most Radiant One. For
Sananda is coming to reclaim his lambs, and will touch each on both
the heart and inner eye areas. This gesture will awaken all who choose
to re-awaken after the long night of the dream.
We seek to bring the Light to the Earth and continue to channel the
higher vibrations into its essence from the Starships upon which we
ride. We have great power, but will not interfere because of the
universal law of non-interference. We honor and respect this law and
know that in obeying it, we stand in the truths which we created. You
too can stand in the truths should you choose, by turning your
consciousness to the higher thought forms and participating in the
laws that govern this parsec of the universe.
In the years to come the Earth will be cleansed of the negativity that
has choked its beauty. The options of how this will be accomplished
are yours. Choose those options from the position of the heart, Oh
Dear Ones, to lessen the pain of the inevitable. Cast aside the
darkness and the shadows in the minds from this day forward, and know
that the darkness is only the illusion. You have sixteen fears to
conquer on your paths of initiation. Know that as you tremble and draw
each to you, that you quickly pass the challenge and move on to higher
tests of courage. Stand as spiritual warriors, like your sisters and
brothers of the stars. Feel their presence and strength in the Light.
Let no mortal take your power or conviction that God protects and
watches over the children of Light. Rest in this assurance and see
that the long, dark night of the soul is finally drawing to an end.
You have been washed free of karmic debts as of the point of
convergence of the harmonies. The sound vibrations have intersected in
your souls with the colors of the Light frequencies of Sananda. Feel
this forgiveness and know that your debts have been paid. Look upward
now and see that your salvation is truly in the hands of the Great
Central Sun and Creator of the All. That is why we suggested in the
beginning that you look outward and see the perfection in each that
resides beside you.
We close this communication to you know, with an invitation to join us
in the chambers of the Tribunal Council. Under normal protocol, this
chamber is reserved for dignitaries who grace our ships with intention
and duty. We invite you to come to us in your dream states on the
etheric and in your meditations, and if you should do so, we will
grant you the voting power of the Center of Peace aboard the Phoenix.
Vote with confidence if you are admitted. As we have stated, it is you
who do the choosing. You are the ones who understand the days and the
nights. You are also the ones who know the power that you have taken
from yourselves.
Oh Children, remember that "Of you, you do nothing. It is the Father
within you that does it all." Work to bring your consciousness to the
Godself above you and connect to your Higher Self. Feel its presence
and discipline yourselves to reclaim your own divinity. It surely will
be restored in a brief moment of time.
This is the truth. This is the way.
We discontinue this transmission now, for our Daughter in the Light is
getting weak from our energy. We thank you for inviting us to present
our message through her this evening. We look forward to the time when
we will communicate to each of you in the same, direct manner, for
that is truly the most desirable goal.
Stand tall and in beauty, sisters and brothers of the stars.
I AM Kuthumi, your Father and World Teacher for the next millennium.
Good evening in the radiance of the Highest. Adonai.

                              REVELATIONS

Here's a short summary of _Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception_ by
Jaques Vallee (Copyright 1991, Ballantine Books, Released October 1991, $20
US ISBN# 0-345-37172-0).  I haven't the time to make this a masterpiece, so
please bear with me.  The following are what I thought were some of the
highlights.  They are generally listed in the same order as Vallee covers
them in his book.
 
 
 - The Holloman Tape -
 
(An alleged tape of an alien landing, circa 1970, which was taken at Holloman
AFB.)  Vallee has this to say:  "In recent conversations I have learned that
the footage exists and is not even classified.  It would seem that anyone
could leak it out without severe penalties, especially if it is credibly
deniable as simple theatrical footage (17)."  The obvious question:  Why
hasn't anyone leaked it out?
 
 - The Dulce Base -
 
Vallee apparently had some discussions with Linda Howe, John Lear, Et. al.
regarding the Dulce base.  He brings up what I regarded as an extremely valid
question:  Why has this supposed _massive_ base not been recorded by
satellites (SPOT, LANDSAT, etc.) capable of recording infrared images?  He
argues that NORAD (Cheyenne Mountain) is easily seen in this manner (54).
Furthermore, these are _not_ classified systems.  If you're willing to shell
out the cash, and have specific coordinates, I understand that these photos
are not difficult to obtain.  My geography textbook is full of examples.
 
 
 - Cooper -
 
Vallee had dinner with Cooper on the Queen Mary, somewhere in Southern
California I presume.  Other than Cooper's usual preposterous and unfounded
claims, there was one incident, a later telephone conversation, regarding the
Brizilian sightings, which I found quite entertaining.  "'Are you trying to
find the truth,' Cooper asked in the accusatory tone of a prosecuting
attorney, 'or are you trying to hide the truth?'"  Vallee explained that he
wouldn't have bothered to spend his personal money going to Brazil, if he
wasn't trying to find the "truth."  Apparently, this wasn't good enough for
Wild Bill.  "Cooper lashed out at me.  'We think you weren't using your own
money.  We know who you're working for...' (p. 72)"  Geez...I'm surprised
this bozo can even _dial_ a phone.
 
 
 - UMMO -
 
There is way too much to summarize here, suffice it to say that UMMO--the
planet as well as the contactee group--has been fairly well, in my opinion,
torn to shreds by Vallee.  Some interesting comments:
 
"A disturbing fact discovered by French investigators seems to link some of
the scientists of the UMMO group with the LaRouche extremist movement in
Europe (110)."
 
"A disquieting possibility, under serious investigation by some French
authorities, is that UMMO is linked to an Eastern bloc intelligence agency
specialized in scientific espionage (115)."
 
 
 - PONTOISE, FRANCE -
 
This case involved a young man, Franck Fontaine, who disappeared for a week,
after a fog was seen to envelope his car.  Two friends witnessed the event,
one of whom, Prevost, later became a contactee of possibly dubious intentions
(124-27).  Vallee points out some similarities between this case, and Travis
Walton's disappearance.  Perhaps the most unsettling revelation Vallee made,
unfortunately without naming specific names, was that the event might have
involved the French government, and a project called Cergy.  Essentially, an
informant from STET (the Service Technique des Engines Tactiques) claimed
that Fontaine had been abducted by quite human persons, under cover of the
"fog," and then drugged.  He was supposedly kept "under an altered state of
high suggestibility" during that time, and then later returned.  The purpose
was to observe the resulting social/political effects, and might have
involved even more sinister aims--a "second stage"-- that were not carried
out (149-150).
 
 
 - Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest -
 
Vallee believes this incident might have been an experiment in psychological
warfare on the part of the United States Air Force.  In other words, the
Bentwaters event was _staged_.  He makes the acute observation that OSI
agents were more than willing to discuss the event with a radar operator,
even mentioning aliens.  In addition, Vallee points out that the personnel
assembled to view this event represented a large collection of professions
(157-160).  Vallee summarizes it thusly:  "This is not what would happen if
a real UFO did land.  But it is exactly the sequence of actions one would
expect if the reactions of the men to a prearranged stimulus were being
tested (160)."  He spends quite a few pages on this incident, and IMHO, it
is a fairly interesting theory, which is worthy of further consideration.
 
 
 - Bill Moore -
 
There is quite about Moore in Vallee's book, generally pertaining to
disinformation leaks and MJ-12, but in one in particular I found interesting.
He points out a relationship, on the functional level, between the MJ-12 romp
and Moore's involvement with the Philadelphia Experiment.  Basically, Vallee
alledges that Philly, much like MJ-12, was a disinformation ploy to keep the
UFO community busy.  "Physical events of undeniable reality--like the Roswell
crash and the Philadelphia radar test--are used as convenient points of entry
to splice a manufactured story into the mind of an unsuspecting public
(188)."
 
Here is another interesting bit:  "When I returned to the United States in
1989, after a UFO meeting in Lyon, a meeting that had also been attended by
Bill Moore, a curious rumor started spreading among some of my friends."
The rumor was that Vallee had met with a doctor, in France, who had performed
autopsies on aliens.  I'm not sure whether Vallee is insinuating that Moore
was involved in this, but it sure seems curious "coincidence", doesn't it?
Especially in light of Moore's unsavory habits.
 
 - Other Things -
 
Vallee goes into Gulf Breeze, the GB-6, Grudge-13, A-51, Lazar, Roswell
(briefly) and too many other things to mention.  Particularly, he thinks
Roswell might have been faked by the Air Force (presumably the Army Air
Force, but he doesn't make that distinction) to cover something else up, like
a secret test.  This was really my only major gripe, as Vallee doesn't offer
any _real_ evidence as to what else it might have been.  He also used some
questionable evidence in his analysis of Gulf Breeze--and focused on _Ed_
rather than the other sightings.  Overall, it was a great book, though, and
I'd highly recommend it.  There's even an appendix with some frequency
statistics on CE-III and IV.

       OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THE LAGUNA CARTEGENA
       ---------------------------------------
              WITH OR WITHOUT UFO's
From EL VOCERO, San Juan, Puerto Rico, August 5, 1991
(AP) LAJAS - The Laguna Cartagena, National Refuge of Birds
between Lajas and Cabo Rojo, will now be open to the public.
The Federal Agency of game hunting, fishing and wild life has
made the announcement.
The announcement from the Agency of game hunting, fishing and
wild life was made known to the Interior Department of the
United States when residents of the area alleged they saw
unidentified flying objects in that place. They went to the
police to complain.
A lot of people (half a score or 10) went that night to the
coast near La Pargera and Maguayo to observe objects they allege
are UFO's. The police don't confirm or refute those versions.
The Public is invited
---------------------
The Doctor Fred C. Schaffner, Biologist, member of the Federal
Agency, invited the public to visit the immense Laguna of more
than 400 cords (cuerdas per original article) of swamp terrain
and sweet water. It is part of the National Refuge of Birds with
more than 800 cords (cuerdas per original article) of extension.
The Government of Puerto Rico, under the administration of
Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, acquired the Laguna, that until
1950 served as a refuge for aquatic birds, but in the last decades
was affected by the expanded agriculture.
In the press communique, Schaffner said there's still a collection
of interesting wild life, and they are trying to restore the place
to natural habitat of a lot of species.
But, the public interested in visiting the Laguna Cartagena must be
prepared to confront rustic conditions.

        Military Airplanes Follow a UFO
        -------------------------------
          by Agustin Munoz EFE Agency
Published in EL VOCERO, San Juan, Puerto Rico - August 30,1991
==============================================================
ADJUNTAS - Residents of Adjuntas say to be witness Wednesday
night of a spectacular presence in the sky when two military
airplanes followed a unidentified flying object. The townspeople
have made demands to the authorities and police of this place.
Tono Perez, resident of Barrio Garzas of Adjuntas said that at
7:00 PM he was on his way home when he noticed a light moved
rapidly, followed by two airplanes he couldn't describe.
Also two other brothers by the name of Belvis communicated with
a local radio station (WPJC) offering the same version.
Airplanes follow it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
But the most dramatic moment experienced by the neighbors of
Adjuntas happenned at 9:00 PM when they saw a group of airplanes
described as A-7 and F-14 following a lighted UFO, which they
claim flies every night over the town. The spectacular sight
was visioned more clearly in Barrio Yayales-Guilarte, as so
explained by Angel Luis Torres, owner of the residence where
they extablished a UFO observatory.
Torres said that three of the airplanes kept flying continuosly
around the area of Guilarte and then continued the pursuit
around the area of Sector Las Minas, when eight other military
airplanes were returning from (los barrios) Juan Gonzalez and
Pellejas located at the minera zone of Adjuntas.
Incredible for the town
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"It was incredible what the towns people saw last night; now
nobody could say that only a few of us saw the flying objects",
expressed Edwin Plaza, a young publisher that participated in
the investigation of UFO's, that was being made by some groups.
This week the Mayor of Adjuntas, Rigoberto Ramos said that
accompanied by his wife,Blanca and the president of the Municipal
Assembly, Cesar Nieves, watched the flying objects over the skies
of this town.

Here's another article that has been translated from Puerto Rico
having to do with UFO's in the Laguna Cartagena area of Lajas.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
               Confirmed Presence of UFO's
               ---------------------------
                    by Julio Victor Ramirez
                       Publisher - EL VOCERO
Article from EL VOCERO, San Juan, Puerto Rico September 2, 1991
===============================================================
Lajas- What could be confirmation of the experience lived last
Thursday by the publisher and ten other people who claim they saw
strange lights coming out of the Laguna Cartagena, thirty other
people witnessed the same on Sunday morning. The investigator of
UFO's, Wilson Sosa explained that a blue, red,orange triangle
of lights appeared in the water, lighting up the place.
The extraordinary spectacular started to be seen at 11:00 PM
Saturday until 3:00 AM. In the moment when the incident occurred,
Sosa said that he was in company of the UFO investigators, Jose
Luis Pacheco, Edgar Pacheco, German Castillo, Sonia Acevedo and
Rosy Castillo.
Also in the area of Laguna Cartagena was Hito Ramirez, his wife
Marisol, two of his sons and fourteen other people with them.
Also, two police agents witnessed the event but asked not to be
identified, Sosa said. "This confirms what was published by
EL VOCERO", said Sosa.
Sosa discarded that the lights coming from the lake were reflected
by other lights or luminized fish. "Definately something strange was
there and the authorities have the responsibility to investigate
what was seen", said the investigator.
This caused the attention of people visiting the surrounding area
of the lake to laugh and make jokes about this. "This is something
very serious that should not be taken lightly", said Sosa.

TWO MEN SAY THEY ARE BEHIND MYSTERIOUS "CORN CIRCLES" IN    
BRITAIN NOT ALIENS                                          
                                                            
LONDON (SEPT. 9) UPI - The baffling appearance of dozens of 
circles and other shapes in British grain fields may have   
been solved Monday when two men said they, not              
extraterrestial beings or freak meteorological forces,      
created the patterns.                                       
                                                            
The declaration of the hoax, itself still unsubstantiated,  
has brought forth yet another theory to be considered by    
scientists and enthusiasts who have been studying the       
mysterious phenomenon for more than a decade.               
                                                            
The shapes, known locally as ''corn circles,'' have appeared
overnight in fields, usually in southern England, without   
any obvious sign of human handiwork. They have been         
attributed variously to aliens, mating hedgehogs and        
swirling masses of electrically charged air.                
                                                            
Doug Bower and David Chorley told the newspaper Today that  
they used two wooden boards, a rope and a primitive aligning
device attached to a baseball cap to lay out the huge       
patterns. They said they eluded detection by walking in     
tractor paths to enter and leave the fields.                
                                                            
''How on earth can intelligent people of that sort -        
professors etc. - just walk into a corn (wheat) field and   
see some flattened corn and make all this out it over the   
years?'' Bower told Independent Television News. ''We're as 
astounded as anyone else.''                                 
                                                            
Some scientists who have studied the mystery remain         
sceptical of the Bower and Chorley's claims.                
                                                            
''I'm waiting for some hard evidence. I want to see them do 
what they claim they have done in front of me and television
cameras for all the world to see '' said Patrick Delgado, a 
retired NASA radar expert who has spent a great deal of time
studying the phenomenon.                                    
                                                            
Bower and Chorley derided the complex theories that have    
grown up around the corn circles, which also have been      
spotted in continental Europe and elsewhere.                
                                                            
''We used to laugh, we used to talk to each other when we're
doing this, that all it is is flattened corn. If you walk   
in, you flatten it.  The only difference was the shapes,''  
Chorley said.                                               
                                                            
Bower added, ''We love the shapes because of their artistic 
value. It's just become a big laugh as the years go by.''   
                                                            
The two men's hoax claim was made as 300 international      
circle- watchers gathered in Glastonbury for the first      
United Kingdom Cornconference.                              
                                                            
At the conference Sunday night, Delgado acknowledged that he
may have been fooled by a hoax.                             
                                                            
''I was taken for a ride like many other people,'' the      
retired scientist said.  ''But if it wasn't me who was      
duped, it would have been someone else later on.  This was  
obviously a great joke, lasting years, but somewhere or     
other it would have been exposed.''                         
                                                            
Delgado and the other conference delegates planned to       
discuss the hoax claim and observe a demonstration of the   
two men's technique.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER ANTI-GREENHOUSE EFFECT ON SATURN'S      
LARGEST MOON                                                
                                                            
WASHINGTON (SEPT. 11) XINHUA - AN ANTI-GREENHOUSE EFFECT ON 
A SOLAR SYSTEM BODY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY
U.S. AND FRENCH SCIENTISTS.                                 
                                                            
ACCORDING TO A NASA NEWS RELEASE, DRS. CHRISTOPHER MCKAY AND
JAMES POLLACK OF NASA'S AMES RESEARCH CENTER AND DR. REGIS  
COURTIN OF PARIS OBSERVATORY DESCRIBED THE TEMPERATURE      
STRUCTURE AND ENERGY BALANCE ON TITAN, SATURN'S LARGEST     
MOON. THEIR STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST DESCRIPTION OF A       
GREENHOUSE AND ANTI-GREENHOUSE EFFECT EXISTING              
SIMULTANEOUSLY, IN TENSION WITH EACH OTHER.                 
                                                            
THE STUDY RESULTS DEFINE AN ANTI-GREENHOUSE EFFECT THAT     
REDUCE TITAN'S SURFACE TEMPERATURE BY 16 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
THE EFFECT IS PRODUCED BY A THICK, ORGANIC HAZE IN TITAN'S  
UPPER ATMOSPHERE THAT ABSORB SOLAR LIGHT, BUT TRANSMITS     
REFLECTED INFRARED RADIATION.                               
                                                            
TITAN'S GREENHOUSE EFFECT, THEY REPORTED, INCREASE THE      
SURFACE TEMPERATURE BY 38 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  THE EFFECT IS
CAUSED BY ATOMSPHERIC GASES REFLECTING INFRARED ENERGY BACK 
TO TITAN'S SURFACE.  THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF TITAN, MINUS
290 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, IS THEREFORE 22 DEGREES WARMER THAN 
IT WOULD BE WITHOUT ATMOPSHERIC EFFECT.                     
                                                            
BETWEEN THE SIZE OF EARTH'S MOON AND MARS, TITAN IS THE ONLY
SATELLITE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A THICK ATMOSPHERE.      
                                                            
ITS ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IS SIMILAR TO EARTH'S -- ONLY ONE  
AND ONE HALF TIMES GREATER -- AND IT HAS THE SAME PRIMARY   
ATMOSPHERIC INGREDIENT -- NITROGEN.  ALSO, THE MAJOR        
GREENHOUSE GAS ON EACH BODY (WATER ON EARTH AND METHANE ON  
TITAN) CONDENSES ON ITS SURFACE.                            
                                                            
TITAN'S GREENHOUSE EFFECT DEPENDS ON A LINK BETWEEN HYDROGEN
AND METHANE, LIKE THE EARTH'S GREENHOUSE EFFECT DEPENDS ON  
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER VAPOR, SAID MCKAY.                 
                                                            
JUST AS TITAN'S GREENHOUSE AND ANTI-GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS A  
GOOD COMPARISON MODEL FOR EARTH, STUDYING THE FORMATION OF  
CLOUDS ON TITAN AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE GREENHOUSE BALANCE  
MAY HELP ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF WARM OR COOL THE PLANET.

SKYTEL CORP. INTRODUCES "SKYWORD" -- TEXT MESSAGES VIA      
SATELLITE NATIONWIDE                                        
                                                            
WASHINGTON (SEPT. 11) PR NEWSWIRE - "SkyWord," a new service
that sends messages from computers to people on a regional  
or nationwide, roaming basis via satellite was introduced   
today by SkyTel Corp., the country's leading provider of    
nationwide paging and voice messaging services.             
                                                            
"Now a message can be sent from a personal computer to a    
portable messaging unit in someone's jacket pocket or purse 
in seconds," said David W. Garrison, president of SkyTel    
Corp.  "By enabling users to send a message from a keyboard 
to a roaming subscriber, SkyWord extends the computer into a
form of personal communications that is no longer location  
dependent.  In short, it's E-mail for people on the move."  
                                                            
The new service sends messages of between 40-80 characters  
or up to 20 average length words in "alphanumeric" format   
(both letters and numbers).  This is more than twice the    
length of typical business messages such as "Missed my      
flight -- go to the meeting without me" or "Meeting changed 
to corporate headquarters, be there by 5 p.m."              
                                                            
"With SkyWord, subscribers receive a complete text message  
that enables them to make their next decision or next move. 
There's no need to stop and make a return phone call," said 
Garrison.                                                   
                                                            
SkyWord has been tested "on a limited subscriber basis for  
over two years," according to the company.  SkyTel, a       
subsidiary of Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corp.,  
(NASDAQ: MTEL), introduced "SkyPager" and "SkyTalk," the    
first satellite-based nationwide paging and voice messaging 
services in the United States in 1987 and 1988,             
respectively, and is the recognized leader today with over  
120,000 subscribers and coverage of hundreds of cities and  
towns.                                                      
                                                            
SkyWord relies on the computer-to-computer dial-up          
capability of personal computers and "on line" computers    
using standard electronic mail systems, as well as laptop   
computers with telephone modems.                            
                                                            
To send a message, the user inputs the text of the message  
along with the SkyWord subscriber's PIN (personal           
identification number).  The user then sends the message via
his or her E-Mail system which automatically dials SkyTel's 
national messaging control computer.                        
                                                            
From there, the SkyWord message is sent to a satellite      
uplink and then to the Westar IV satellite orbiting the     
earth.  The message returns to a satellite downlink and is  
then sent to SkyTel's transmitters located throughout the   
United States.  The entire procedure usually takes less than
30 seconds.                                                 
                                                            
SkyTel Corp. is the principal subsidiary of Mobile          
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel).  Mtel, based in
Jackson, Miss., is engaged in businesses that include       
nationwide and regional paging and nationwide voice

discovered in the milky way.                                
                                                            
The satellite, 30 meters in diameter, and to be launched by 
the national Institute of space inquiry (Inpe) in november, 
will carry 35 gama ray Detectors.                           
                                                            
Gama rays are the most violent phenomenon in the universe.  
The 35 detectors Will constitute a image telescope that will
reconstruct the forms of objects 1,100 light years away.    
                                                            
The inpe will also launch another satellite at the same time
with gama ray Detector.                                     
                                                            
Gama rays have the highest frequency in the electromagnetic 
spectrum and are Blocked by earth's atmosphere. However,    
these may be observed outside the Atmospheric strata via    
satellites.

THE EARTH, CAUSING MASS EXTINCTIONS.                        
                                                            
TWO WEEKS AGO DR DUNCAN STEELE USING THE BRITISH SCHMIDT    
TELESCOPE FOUND A NEW ASTEROID IN AN ORBIT THAT TAKES IT    
CLOSER TO THE SUN THAN MERCURY, BEFORE SWINGING OUT PAST THE
EARTH.                                                      
                                                            
WHEN HE COMPUTED THE ORBIT OF THE ASTEROID, DESIGNATED 1991 
RC, HE FOUND IT WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND ALMOST IDENTICAL TO  
THAT OF A LARGE ASTEROID DISCOVERED 42 YEARS AGO, CALLED    
ICARUS.                                                     
                                                            
DR STEELE SAID IN A PAPER RELEASED TODAY THAT IT WAS        
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT ICARUS AND 1991 RC SHARED THE SAME  
ORBIT BY CHANCE THE LIKELY EXPLANATION WAS THAT BOTH HAD    
BEEN CREATED BY THE BREAK-UP OF A LARGER OBJECT, PROBABLY A 
COMET, WITHIN THE PAST FEW THOUSAND YEARS.                  
                                                            
HE SAID ICARUS, ALTHOUGH CLASSIFIED AS AN ASTEROID,         
EXHIBITED IRREGULARITIES IN ITS ORBIT THAT SUGGESTED THAT IT
WAS EMITTING POWERFUL JETS OF GAS, JUST LIKE A COMET, WHEN  
IT APPROACHED THE SUN.                                      
                                                            
DR STEELE ALSO SAID IN HIS PAPER THAT THE NEW SCIENTIFIC    
DISCIPLINE CALLED CATASTROPHISM WAS DIVIDED OVER THE NATURE 
OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL IMPACTS. AMERICAN SCIENTISTS FAVORED THE
IDEA OF CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS BY SINGLE COMETS OR ASTEROIDS. 
                                                            
BRITISH AND AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS ARGUED THAT THE EARTH WAS 
PERIODICALLY SUBJECTED TO A SERIES OF IMPACTS SPREAD OVER   
THOUSANDS, EVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS.                 
                                                            
THE MULTIPLE-IMPACT THEORY FOLLOWED FROM EVIDENCE THAT LARGE
COMETS CREATED SWARMS OF SMALLER COMETS AND METEOROIDS WHEN 
THEY BROKE UP.  DURING THE PERIOD WHEN A GIANT COMET WAS    
FRAGMENTING, WHICH MIGHT TAKE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 100,000    
YEARS, THE EARTH WOULD BE ORBITING  IN HEAVY TRAFFIC , DR   
STEELE SAID.

EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS BEGIN UNRAVELLING BRONZE AGE GLACIER MAN
RIDDLE                                                      
                                                            
VIENNA (SEPT. 25) DPA - A top scientist said Wednesday it   
could take months to unravel the mysteries surrounding what 
experts regard as a unique corpse discovery high in an      
Austrian glacier Monday.                                    
                                                            
The well-preserved Bronze Age corpse produced a number of   
fascinating questions for archaeologists and scientists,    
said Professor Konrad Spindler of the Institute for Pre-    
History and Early history at Innsbruck University.          
                                                            
The mummified corpse, thought to be about 4,000 years old,  
was found in ice of the Similaun glacier, 3,200 metres above
sea level on the border between Austria and Italy.          
Scientists have named it Similaun Man, after the discovery  
area.                                                       
                                                            
Experts can roughly determine the body's age by its hay-    
lined leather clothes, the flint and tinder carried in a    
leather sack and a wooden-handled arrowhead which acted as a
dagger.                                                     
                                                            
Experts were descending on the site Wednesday to find out   
more details about the body, believed that of a man aged    
between 20 and 40, about one metre 60 tall, with well-worn  
teeth.                                                      
                                                            
The cause of ''Similaun Man's'' death is as yet unknown,    
though scientists suspect he may have been a murder victim, 
as he has signs of injury to his back and head. What remains
a complete mystery is how he came to be in the glacier.     
                                                            
Scientists are to examine the contents of the body's stomach
and also-tattoo-like marks on its back, thought to designate
the man's tribe.                                            
                                                            
The Bronze Age is generally agreed to have lasted from the  
end of the third to the beginning of the first millenium    
before Christ. The use of bronze was seen as a great leap   
forward, being harder than copper, but easier to melt.      
                                                            
It could be used to make weapons such as axes and daggers,  
and be crafted into jewellery, with arm and leg bangles     
extremely popular.                                          
                                                            
People during the early Bronze Age period were ''simply     
normal agricultural and cattle farmers,'' said Rainer Michl 
from Hamburg University's Archaelogical Institute. The      
glacier man is to their knowledge the best-preserved example
of a person living in that era.

WASHINGTON (SEPT. 24) XINHUA - DEEP SEA LIFE WAS VIRTUALLY  
OBLITERATED OVER LARGE PARTS OF THE OCEAN FLOORS 57 MILLION 
YEARS AGO BY A RAPID WARMING OF THE EARTH, A RECENT STUDY   
SAID.                                                       
                                                            
WHILE SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT AN INTENSE GLOBAL     
WARMING DURING THIS EPIC AFFECTED LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF THE
EARTH, THE STUDY SHOWED THAT A RAPID RISE IN TEMPERATURE    
ALSO CAUSED UP TO 50 PERCENT OF THE DEEP SEA SPECIES TO     
BECOME EXTINCT.                                             
                                                            
'A LOT OF THE CRUSTACEOUS FORMS OF LIFE WERE ZAPPED, NEVER  
TO SEE AGAIN,' SAID DR. JAMES P. KENNETT, A GEOLOGIST AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA BARBARA, WHO ALONG WITH   
DR. LOWELL D. STOTT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN           
CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES, WAS A CO-AUTHOR OF THE STUDY.    
                                                            
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY, THE EXTINCTION, ONE  
OF THE LARGEST TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST 90 MILLION      
YEARS, WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE EXTINCTION OF DINOSAURS   
AND OTHER LAND AND SEA LIFE DOME 11 MILLION TO 12 MILLION   
YEARS AGO.                                                  
                                                            
AS THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE HEATED UP, THE WATERS WARMED BY   
ABOUT 6 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, LEADING TO A DEPLETION IN THE   
OXYGEN LEVELS, THE STUDY REPORTED.  BECAUSE THE CHANGE      
OCCURRED RELATIVELY RAPIDLY, OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL     
THOUSAND YEARS, DEEP SEA LIFE FAILED TO ADAPT QUICKLY ENOUGH
TO SURVIVE, DR.  KENNETT SAID.                              
                                                            
BUT FISH AND OTHER FREE-FLOATING SPECIES LIVING CLOSE TO THE
SURFACE SURVIVED TO A GREATER DEGREE BECAUSE OF THEIR       
ABILITY TO MIGRATE TO COOLER WATERS, WHERE THE OXYGEN LEVEL 
REMAINED HIGHER.

SCIENTISTS RECREATE "MIRACULOUS" LIQUIFICATION OF SAINTS'   
BLOOD                                                       
                                                            
WASHINGTON (OCT. 9) UPI -  Researchers at the University of 
Pavia, Italy have found a scientific explanation for one of 
the Catholic Church's previously unexplained miracles.      
                                                            
Some blood sample remains of early saints have been held as 
relics for centuries, 'miraculously' changing from a hard,  
clotted state to a liquid when handled during ceremonies.   
                                                            
Such a ceremony has drawn thousands every few months to     
Naples, Italy, where a vial containing the blood relic of   
Saint Januarius or San Gennaro has been held and revered    
since 1389.                                                 
                                                            
Now, chemist Luigi Garlaschelli and colleagues have used    
materials that would have been available in the Middle Ages 
to create a brown gel that liquifies with gentle shaking.   
                                                            
In findings reported in a letter to the journal Nature,     
Garlaschelli put chalk in a solution of hydrated iron       
chloride, passed the solution through a membrane, allowed it
to partially evaporate, and added a small amount of salt.   
                                                            
This mixture gelled into a dark brown liquid that liquified 
when shaken and gelled again when allowed to set.           
                                                            
Hydrated iron chloride is a common, naturally occurring     
compound, found as the mineral molysite on active volcanoes 
such as Vesuvius.                                           
                                                            
The researchers said they cannot determine the actual       
content of the blood samples held by the Church in Naples   
because the Church denies such testing.                     
                                                            
Other mixtures of substances that would have been available 
hundreds of years ago also may exhibit the same solid-to-   
liquid property.  Garlaschelli said his team is             
experimenting with beeswax in alcohol, various pigments in  
linseed or castor oil and clay in water.
