PART 11

 In 1989 Moore said that "in early 1983 I became aware that  Rick
[Doty] was involved with a team of several others, including  one
fellow  from  Denver  that I knew of and at  least  one  who  was
working  out  of  Washington,  D.C.,  in  playing  an   elaborate
disinformation scheme against a prominent UfO researcher who,  at
the  time,  had close connections with a  major  television  film
company interested in doing a UFO documentary." He was  referring
to  Howe, of course. The episode was a counterintelligence  sting
operation,  part  of  the "wall of  disinformation"  intended  to
"confuse"  the Bennewitz issue and to "call his credibility  into
question."  Because  of  Howe's  interest  in  Bennewitz's  work,
according  to  Moore, "certain elements within  the  intelligence
community were concerned that the story of his having intercepted
low  frequency electromagnetic emissions from the  Coyote  Canyon
area  of  the Kirtland/Sandia complex would end up as part  of  a
feature film. Since this in turn might influence others (possibly
even  the Russians) to attempt similar experiments, someone in  a
control  position apparently felt it had to be stopped before  it
got out of hand." In his observation, Moore said, "the government
seemed hell bent on severing the ties that existed between [Howe]
and [HBO]" (Moore, 1989b).

 Doty's assertion that Howe had misrepresented their meeting  was
not  to  be taken seriously, according to Moore, since  Doty  was
bound by a security oath and could not discuss the matter  freely
Moore  said that the Aztec crash, known beyond  reasonable  doubt
never  to  have  occurred, was something Doty had  added  to  the
document after learning from Moore of his recent investigation of
the hoax.

 In December 1984, in the midst of continuing contact with  their
own  sources  (Doty  and a number of others) who  claimed  to  be
leaking  the  secret  of the cover-up,  Moore's  associate  Jaime
Shandera  received a roll of 35mm film containing, it turned  out
what  purported to be a briefing paper dated November  18,  1952,
and  intended  for  president-elect  Eisenhower.  The   purported
author, Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, reported that an "Operation
Majestic-12,"  consisting  of a dozen  top  scientists,  military
officers  and  intelligence  specialists,  had  been  set  up  by
presidential  order on September 24, 1947, to study  the  Roswell
remains  and  the four humanoid bodies that  had  been  recovered
nearby. The document report that the team directed by MJ12 member
and  physiologist  Detlev Bronk "has suggested the  term  'Extra-
terrestrial  Biological Entities', or 'EBEs', be adopted  as  the
standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as
a more definitive designation can be agreed upon." Brief  mention
is also made of a December 6, 1950, crash along the  Texas-Mexico
border.   Nothing  is  said,  however,  about  live   aliens   or
communications with them.

 In  July  1985  Moore and Shandera, acting on  tips  from  their
sources,  traveled  to  Washington and spent  a  few  days  going
through  recently  declassified documents in  Record  Group  341,
including  Top  Secret  Air Force intelligence  files  from  USAF
Headquarters. In the 126th box whose contents they examined, they
found  a  brief  memo dated July 14, 1954,  from  Robert  Cutler,
Special  Assistant to the President, to Gen. Nathan  Twining.  It
says  "The  president  has decided that  the  MJ-12/SSP  [Special
Studies  Project] briefing should take place during  the  already
scheduled White House meeting of July 16 rather than following it
as  previously  intended.  More  precise  arrangements  will   be
explained to you upon your arrival. Your concurrence in the above
change of arrangements is assumed" (Friedman, 1987).

 The   Cutler/Twining  memo,  as  it  would  be  called  in   the
controversies  that  erupted  after  Moore  released  the   MJ-12
document to the world in the spring of 1987, is the only official
document-not  to  be  confused with such  disputed  ones  as  the
November  17, 1980, Aquarius document-to mention MJ-12.  (Several
critics   of  the  MJ-12  affair  have  questioned   the   memo's
authenticity  as well, but so far without  unambiguous  success.)
The  memo does not, of course, say what the MJ12 Special  Studies
Project was.

MJ-12  Goes  Public: Just prior to Moore's release of  the  MJ-12
briefing  paper,  another copy was leaked  to  British  ufologist
Timothy Good, who took his copy to the press. The first newspaper
article  on it appeared in the London Observer of May  31,  1987,
and  soon  it was the subject of pieces in the  New  York  Times,
Washington  Post and ABC-TV's Nightline. It was  also  denounced,
not  altogether persuasively, both by professional debunkers  and
by  many  ufologists. The dispute would rage  without  resolution
well  into 1989, when critics discovered that President  Truman's
signature on the September 24, 1947, executive order (appended to
the  briefing  paper)  was  exactly  like  his  signature  on  an
undisputed, UFO-unrelated October 1, 1947, letter to his  science
adviser  (and  supposed  MJ-12  member)  Vannevar  Bush.  To  all
appearances  a  forger had appended a real signature  to  a  fake
letter.   The   MJ-12  document  began  to  look   like   another
disinformation scheme.

 Although acutely aware of the mass of disinformation circulating
throughout  the UFO community, Moore remained convinced  that  at
least some of the information his own sources were giving him was
authentic. In 1988 he provided two of his sources, "Falcon" (Sgt.
Doty according to some) and "Condor" (later claimed to be  former
U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Collins), to a television  production
company.  (Moore  and  Shandera had given them  avian  names  and
called the sources collectively "the birds.") UFO Cover-up . .  .
Live, a two-hour program, aired in October 1988, with Falcon  and
Condor,  their faces shaded, their voices altered,  relating  the
same  tales with which they had regaled Moore and  Shandera.  The
show,  almost universally judged a laughable  embarrassment,  was
most  remembered for the informants' statements that  the  aliens
favored  ancient Tibetan music and strawberry ice cream.  Critics
found the latter allegation especially hilarious.
