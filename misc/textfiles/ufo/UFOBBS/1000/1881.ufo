WHAT IS THE PHOENIX PROJECT?

 The   Phoenix   Project  is  a   private,   civilian,   research
organization   formed  in  1952  to  investigate  and   correlate
information  concerning  Unidentified Flying Objects  (UFOs)  and
Extra-Terrestrial (ET) activities. It has no affiliation with the
United  States Government or any of its agencies. Because of  the
nature of its work the Phoenix Project does not seek publicity.

 Staff  members are former military personnel who have  all  been
associated  with intelligence activities, and have  knowledge  of
covert government operations concerning UFO's. Their knowledge of
the  specialized  field of  "intelligence  correlation,"  provide
unique insights into various subject matter.

 From  time-to-time  and  in the  public  interest,  the  Phoenix
Project will publish research reports regarding certain subjects.
A   list  of  reports  is  available  from  our  publisher.   All

INTRODUCTION TO THE K-2 REPORT

SPECIAL NOTE:

 June 27, 1992

 The  original  "K-2  Special Report," dated July  28,  1989  and
included  in  this document, was  classified  "confidential"  for
circulation within the Phoenix Project only. It was not  released
for public distribution. There are compelling reasons for  making
it public at this time, and to update this information. Note  the
following:

 1)  In  the  last decade, there has been  a  growing  number  of
reports  of  hostile activity by alien beings,  directed  against
humanity.

 2)  Various  Departments  and  Agencies  of  the  United  States
Government have increased their activity on two different levels.

 One:  They  have  stepped-up  the level  of  their  covert  dis-
information  campaign  --  a campaign  aimed  at  disrupting  the
civilian  UFO  movement.  This  is  evidenced  by  an  increasing
quantity    of   dis-information   supplied    to    individuals,
organizations  and the public. It is an onoing program to  create
wide-spread  confusion throughout the UFO movement,  to  splinter
organizations,  and to discredit any investigators who  get  near
the  truth.  Many researchers are  spinning-their-wheels  chasing
down, deliberately planted, false leads. The tactics employed are
aimed  at diverting attention away from critical areas where  the
truth would be revealed.

 Trained operatives have infiltrated the UFO movement, poising as
sincere and trusted investigators while others adopt the roles of
professional skeptics and debunkers. By covering and  controlling
both sides-of-theence, they insure that the truth remains hidden.

 Two: This duplicity extends to their relations with the  aliens.
On  one  hand  they  continue the charade  of  working  with  and
assisting the aliens -- to obtain the advanced alien  technology,
while  they  secretly develop operations and weapons  systems  to
counter the threat the aliens represent.

 The aliens have indulged in the same duplicity. Saying one thing
to   the  super-powers,  to  create  an  appetite  for   superior
technology,  while  carrying  out  their  own  covert  activities
against humanity. They have created wellidden bases of their own.
Bases that allow them to continue their covert operations without
government interference or scrutiny. Bases unknown to the various
world governments.

 It  would  be  untrue to say that the  U.S.  Government  doesn't
suspect  the existence of hidden alien bases. However,  to  date,
they have had shown little success in locating them.

 It  is  not the intention or purpose of the Phoenix  Project  to
judge   the  government's  actions  or  the  actions   of   those
responsible and involved in the UFO coverup activity. Our efforts
are  not part of a vindictive crusade against the government.  In
our  opinion,  the  public  has a right to  know  the  facts  and
information revealed by our investigations. If this proves to  be
an  embarrassment  to  those  responsible  for  concealing   such
information, they have only themselves to blame.

 Our  efforts  may  help  wiser  heads  in  the  government   and
elsewhere,  to realize that the aliens have hidden objectives  of
their own. Objectives they have not made known to the  government
and  humanity.  Wiser  heads may also  realize  that  Washington,
Langley  and Fort Meade do not have exclusive possession of  that
called  "intelligence"  or intelligence data. Perhaps  they  will
finally recognize that "others" are able to obtain, correlate and
evaluate  important information on their own. A  rational  person
might  realize  the  value and importance  of  cooperation  with,
rather  than  antagonism  against, others  who  possess  valuable
information.

 The  objective  of  the Phoenix Project in  making  this  report
public is to accomplish the following:

 1) To reveal to the U.S. Government, civilian UFO  investigators
and  the  public, the existence and location of  a  hidden  alien
base.  It will also become known that the aliens have  used,  and
are  continuing  to  use, without  their  knowledge  or  consent,
personnel of the U.S. Forest Service to help conceal the presence
of this base. Details concerning this are included in the updated
information supplement in the Exhibit Section of this report.

 2) Revealing the location of this base will render it useless to
the  aliens.  This  will severely impact  part  of  their  covert
activity against humanity.

 3) To reveal one aspect of the alien threat to the public.

HOW THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN AND THE ALIEN BASE WAS DISCOVERED

 The  Phoenix  Project investigation into this  matter  began  in
early  June  of  1989. Our Staff Member # 2,  then,  overheard  a
strange short-wave radio transmission that aroused his  interest.
Every  night,  for  two weeks, he  monitored  this  unique  radio
transmission.  Then, using radio direction-finding equipment,  he
was  able  to  locate the source of the  transmission.  By  using
triangulation  techniques he found the signal was coming from  an
area some forty miles northeast of his location.

 On  June 10, 1989, he recorded the strange  radio  transmission.
The  broadcast  signal lasted nearly an hour. The  recording  was
sent  to  the Project's Headquarters for  further  analysis.  Our
analysis  of the recording caused the Project to launch  a  major
investigation  into  this matter. As a side  project,  our  Staff
decided  to  "test"  the current  degree  of  government  secrecy
regarding UFO research. We created a test.

THE TEST

 Our  staff  contacted Dr. Peter Sturrock  at  Stanford  Research
Institute  in Palo Alto, California. Dr. Sturrock enjoys a  quiet
reputation of being a "concerned" and reliable UFO Researcher. We
requested  that  he conduct a further study and analysis  of  the
recording. Dr. Sturrock was very interested and cooperative -- at
first.  However,  very quickly, his attitude  changed.  Within  a
week, and acting very reserved and guarded, he phoned us  stating
he couldn't have anything further to do with this matter and that
Stanford  Research  could not analyze the recording.  No  further
explanation  was offered. He suggested we take the  recording  to
Dr. James Harder at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
California. We thanked Dr. Sturrock for his initial interest  and
expressed  our  regrets that he was unable to pursue  the  matter
further.  In the next day's mail, we received the  recording  and
our analysis notes from Dr. Sturrock.

 A  courier  delivered  the recording to NASA's  Dr.  Harder,  in
person, the following day. A week later we called to ask how  the
analysis  was progressing. Dr. Harder was not available  when  we
phoned,  but his secretary could not recall having  received  any
recording  from us. Therefore, there was nothing to  analyze  and
they  were  unable  to  assist  us  further.  The  tone  of   the
conversation was abrupt and had the ring of an obvious dismissal.

 Fortunately,  the  "lost"  recording  was a  copy  and  not  the
original.  It  was becoming very obvious that  Dr.  Sturrock  and
Stanford  Research, and that Dr. Harder and NASA, were not  going
to  reveal what their analysis of the recording revealed.  Again,
the  official  research community had failed our "test."  It  was
time to move on.

 Meanwhile,  the  Project's  Staff  decided  to  investigate  the
location   thought  to  be  the  source  of  the  strange   radio
transmission.

 On  June  15,  1989,  a  Phoenix  Project  Survey  Team  made  a
preliminary  investigation to locate the site and origin  of  the
mysterious  radio  transmission.  The  site  was  located  and  a
preliminary investigation was completed.

 A  second  site  survey  and  more  detailed  investigation  was
conducted  on  June 28, 1989. The results of this  second  survey
prompted   the  need  for  an  in-depth  scientific  survey   and
investigation of the site.

 On July 19, 1989, the third survey was launched. A well-equipped
science  and  investigative team arrived at the K-2  Site  for  a
three-day effort. For security reasons, at the time, the  Phoenix
Project  assigned  the code name "K-2" to the site area  and  the
investigative  effort. The results of all three site surveys  and
the  results  of the investigation, were compiled  the  following
week.   The  following  report  reveals  the  details   of   that
investigation.

Date of original report: July 28, 1989

 Revised for updated information: June 22, 1992

K-2 -- A SPECIAL REPORT

A SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 K-2 is the Phoenix Project code name for a specific geographical
site   in  Northern  California.  It  has  been  determined,   by
investigation,  that  this site is the location of  a  previously
unknown  and undiscovered extra-terrestrial (alien)  installation
and base of operations.

 To  date,  the  U.S. Government  and  its  various  intelligence
agencies  has  given  no indication that they are  aware  of  the
existence  of  the  K-2 Alien Base or its location.  It  is  also
unknown  to  the general public and to leading  UFO  researchers.
This report is the first time its existence has been revealed.

 Alien spacecraft seen arriving and departing from this base, and
the  small, grey, alien creatures seen at this location, lead  to
the  inescapable conclusion that this base was built by,  and  is
operated  by, an alien race from the star system  Zeta  Reticuli.
This race, known in covert government and select public  circles,
and to UFO researchers, has been named the Greys.

CONCEALMENT FEATURES

 The site of this secret alien base is within the Plumas National
Forest. The base is well-concealed and hidden underground, inside
a  "land-mark" mountain -ilot Peak, in northern California.  This
site  is  located  in Plumas County, on  a  remote  and  isolated
stretch of county road between the towns of La Porte and  Quincy.
See Exhibit 1.

 The  site  is isolated and cut-off from general  access,  except
from the air or the use of snowmobiles, or ski's, 6 months of the
year  because  of heavy snow conditions. A well  constructed  and
permanent  "fire"  lookout tower on top of Pilot Peak  (K-2)  was
suddenly abandoned several years ago. Discussions with local U.S.
Forest Rangers, indicate there are no intentions of ever  manning
or  re-activating  the fire lookout station.  Budgetary  problems
were  not a factor. The explanation given, was that  the  lookout
was  obsolete.  Fire  spotting,  these  days,  according  to  the
rangers, is better accomplished by patrolling aircraft.

 This explanation, (in 1989) seems suspect and insubstantial,  at
best.  Evidence to support these claims are provided by the  fact
that   other  fire  lookout  stations,  in  nearby   areas,   are
operational  and manned throughout the peak summer  fire  season.
Why is the K-2 fire lookout an exception?

 An  outstanding "air approach corridor," provides  incoming  and
outgoing alien spacecraft with exceptional concealment. The  "air
corridor"  leading to and from this hidden base is, somehow,  not
covered  by  either  military or civilian radar  or  air  traffic
control.  This has been verified by examination  of  aeronautical
charts  of  the area. Terrain features, also,  provide  excellent
concealment from visual observation. See Exhibit 2.

TERRAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE:

 The main area of the Alien base is a "U" shaped bowl cradled  at
the northern end and at the foot of Pilot Peak and its associated
mountain  ridges. The site is protected on three sides by 400  to
600  foot mountain ridges. Two, level terrain, landing zones  200
to 300 feet in diameter are present. Well concealed and  expertly
camouflaged entrances to the Alien base are located near each  of
the landing zones. See Exhibit 3.

 High  mountains and deep valleys, leading to and from  the  open
mouth  of  the "U" shaped site, provides a 20 mile  approach  and
departure corridor that is secure from ground-based radar,  civil
or  military.  The deep valley and canyons  also  prevent  visual
observation  of  low-flying spacecraft. Visual  observation  from
high-flying  military or civilian jet traffic is not  likely,  as
the site is not on or near an established air traffic route.  See
Exhibit 17.

LANDING SITE EVIDENCE

 There  are  some physical indications present  at  both  landing
sites,  Landing Zone 1 and 2 (indentations in the  ground,  large
circular  areas of flattened native grass, and small  amounts  of
residual radio-active radiation). Most striking, however, is  the
fact  that  there  is  an unusual absence  of  animal  or  rodent
presence.  There are no animals; animal tracks, rodents,  snakes,
ground  squirrels or chipmunks present in or around  the  landing
sites.  However, these creatures are present everywhere  else  in
the  area.  Birds, also present elsewhere, seem to  avoid  flying
over  or  through the landing areas.  Insect  life,  particularly
flying  insects -- deer flies, common flies and  mosquitoes,  are
present  everywhere. Other researchers have established the  fact
that  the lack of animal or rodent presence in UFO landing  areas
is significant.

AREA NEAR CONCEALED BASE

 To  the casual observer visiting the K-2 site, everything  would
appear quite normal. The area seems peaceful and serene. However,
in  the  general  area  of  the  concealed  Alien  base,  to   an
experienced observer, it suggests and entirely different picture.
The  area is too tranquil and perfect, both in appearance and  in
the  general atmosphere of the place. The term "picture  perfect"
is  appropriate.  This  setting  is  completely  unrealistic  and
paradoxical when compared with other areas a mere half-mile away.

SURVEY PARTY OBSERVATIONS

 On  three  occasions  (in 1989)  trained  investigators  of  the
Phoenix Project have visited and investigated the K-2 site.  They
have   all  experienced  and  observed  unusual   phenomena   and
conditions in the area.

 1)  An uncanny stillness (the absence of normal  sounds)  during
the day. This was even more evident during the hours of darkness.
No  animal sounds. No owls hooting. No birds chirping.  No  cries
from coyotes. The absence of these normal sounds in the area  was
unsettling.  This phenomenon has been observed on every visit  to
this site.

 2) All the investigators experienced independent and  unprompted
feelings   of  being  observed  by  unseen  watchers.  This   was
particularly evident on the first visit to the site. Each  member
of  the survey party, independently, and with no solicitation  or
prompting from each other, reported, afterwards, strong  feelings
of being watched and frequently they turned around to look behind
them.  However, no unseen watchers were discovered. This  left  a
strong impression on the survey party.

 3) On the first survey there were observations of unusual  cloud
behavior. Clouds that formed out of nowhere. Clouds that appeared
and disappeared with sudden quickness. Thick, angry looking, grey
clouds  that billowed up in ominous manner, with a "boiling"  and
rolling  end-over-end motion, that quickly enveloped  the  entire
site  area. Survey party members wondered if the atmosphere  was,
somehow,  being controlled. All of this activity was confined  to
the  K-2 site area. A half-mile away, in any direction,  the  sky
was clear.

 4)  Observations  on the first and second visits  to  the  site,
revealed that an earthen dike (erected to maintain a 6 foot water
level  in a large pond near the concealed secret base)  had  very
recently,  been  deliberately  breached over a  ten  foot  width,
dropping  the pond's water level to a 6 inch depth. Shovel  marks
were  evident  in the breach area. The lack of  erosion,  on  the
sides of the breached area, indicated its recent nature.

 However,  on  the  third visit this  breach  had  been  expertly
repaired.  There were heavy equipment tracks (a  bulldozer's)  in
and  around the dike. Earth, dug from a nearby hill, was used  to
repair  the  dike. Forest Rangers, who patrol  the  area  several
times  each  day, when questioned about this, were at a  loss  to
explain  the  repairs.  No one using  heavy  equipment  had  been
observed  in the area. According to the Rangers, the pond is  not
used  for any known purpose -- yet it's there.  Someone  recently
breached it to lower the water level. Then, someone, unknown  and
unobserved, repaired it. See Exhibit 15.

 Why  the pond with no known purpose or function? Why breach  it?
Why  repair  it?  Why wasn't the use of heavy  equipment  or  the
repairs,  noticed by the patrolling Rangers? It should be  stated
that  the Rangers are very observant and notice everything  going
on  in  their area, as our questions revealed. Why is  K-2,  this
Alien base, seemingly, exempt?

 5) The county road between the towns of La Porte and Quincy is a
rough, poorly maintained, dirt road for some 30 miles. Rough dirt
roads  are  prevalent  throughout  the  area  for  miles  in  all
directions. There are no towns, settlements, fishing areas,  camp
grounds,  or anything else of significance, anywhere in the  area
near Pilot Peak (K-2). This site is out in the middle of nowhere.
Yet  --  the  county  road for 2-1/2 miles  either  side  of  the
entrance  to the K-2 site, is a modern, well  maintained,  black-
topped,  2 lane highway. Before and after this 5 mile stretch  of
modern  road, it is again a dirt road. Why? No one questioned  by
our  investigators had any explanation. And, more  curiously,  no
one seemed the least bit curious about it. Why? Refer to Exhibits
1 and 3.

 6) There is a rough, hard-packed, dirt road leading to K-2  from
the  town  of  La Porte. It is a narrow 2 lane road.  It  is  not
frequently  traveled.  On  the  third  visit  to  the  K-2  site,
extraordinary logging activity, by "two" major logging companies,
were  evident.  Only the trees within 20 feet on either  side  of
this  dirt  road  are  being cut and  hauled  to  sawmills.  When
questioned,  the  loggers  were  uncommunicative  regarding  this
activity.  However,  there is every reason to believe,  from  the
nature  of this activity, that this road is going to  be  widened
and improved. Possibly, even black-topped.

 One must remember that this road is an obscure county road  that
is infrequently used. It provides a secondary connection  between
the  two towns of La Porte and Quincy, some thirty  miles  apart.
Why the activity to widen and improve it? Why improve a road that
is hardly used by the general public?

 It must be remembered that all these secondary county roads  are
totally  impassible, because of heavy snow, for 6 months  of  the
year. No efforts are made during the winter to keep them open and
clear.  In fact, just outside of La Porte there is a heavy  metal
gate  that  is used to block the road during the  winter  months.
Why, then, all this activity? What purpose is being served?

METHODS USED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE, LOCATION AND SIZE OF  THE
ALIEN BASE

 Since the only way to conceal a large installation is to bury it
underground,  or  in the depths of an ocean, out of  sight,  only
certain types of sophisticated scientific instruments can  reveal
the underground presence of such an installation. Foremost  among
these  instruments,  is that known as a  portable  "total  field"
magnetometer.  This  instrument is widely  used  by  professional
geologists  to  detect  the  presence  of  valuable   underground
minerals,   oil,  and  water  deposits.  It  is  also   used   by
sophisticated  archaeologists  to detect the remains  of  ancient
buried   cities,  caverns  and  other  valuable  sites  of   past
civilizations.

 A  magnetometer is a precision instrument that  measures  minute
changes  or  deviations in the Earth's magnetic  field  within  a
given  area.  All  geological  features:  mountains,  lava  beds,
rivers, streams and lakes, plains, meadows and plateaus, and even
grains of sand, eventually, over thousands of years, align  their
molecular magnetic structure with the prevailing direction of the
Earth's magnetic field. Earthquakes, volcanoes and geological up-
thrusts,  and their resultant forces, in creating all  geological
formations, cause deviations in an area's basic magnetic pattern.
Underground  geological features such as: upthrust  dikes,  sheer
planes,  faults, mineral deposits, caverns, caves, tombs,  rivers
and lakes, etc., and other anomalies, leave their  characteristic
and recognizable magnetic signatures.

 In  a  like manner, any underground  excavations,  tunneling  or
shafts, create a deviation from the normal patterns prevalent  in
a given area. Such underground construction activity disturbs the
local  magnetic field in the area. This disturbance is caused  by
the material excavated or otherwise moved. The magnetometer  can,
by noting the strength of such deviations and disturbances,  then
determine  the  location, shape, size and depth  of  such  buried
features and anomalies.

 Sophisticated computer programs can then analyze the information
reported by this instrument and create statistical data,  charts,
plots and maps, which portray the underground features of an area
in  amazing detail. The magnetometer, in a sense, is  similar  to
having a form of powerful x-ray vision that is capable of looking
deep within the earth.

 For three days starting on July 19, 1989, a portable total-field
magnetometer was used by the Phoenix Project's scientific  survey
team to conduct a magnetic mapping of highly suspect areas of the
K-2 site.

 The  presence of our survey teams aroused intense  curiosity  on
the part of the U.S. Forest Service and their Rangers. The  first
day,  several  different Rangers questioned  us  intensely.  They
asked us who we were, what we were doing, how long we would be in
the  area,  where we came from, etc. We  had  prepared  plausible
answers  to  such questions in advance of being  questioned.  Our
answers  seemed to satisfy their initial curiosity. However,  the
second  and  third day of our presence on the site,  brought  the
Rangers  out  in  force.  Hardly an  hour  would  pass  before  a
different  Ranger or pair of Rangers would appear and  start  the
questions  all  over again. They seemed determined  to  find  out
exactly  who we were, why we were there, what we were doing,  and
why we were doing it, etc. Some of the Rangers stayed a while and
became interested in the scientific equipment and its  operation.
To  satisfy  them, we let them assist us in taking  some  of  the
magnetometer  readings. But, continuously, they tried to pump  us
for  additional  information.  Each time we gave  them  the  same
answers and eventually they would leave. The on-going visits  and
questions eventually became a game that was amusing. However,  we
couldn't help but wonder what was driving their curiosity and why
they continued the constant barrage of questions. See Exhibit 21.

 This  magnetic survey revealed the presence of a large  metallic
or metal constructed chamber of enormous size, thought to be  the
main alien installation or base, and other metal-lined  chambers.
In  addition,  various metalined tunnels and fused  natural  rock
passages   and   tunnels,  connecting  various   areas   of   the
installation, and providing means to enter and exit the base were
detected.

 Subsequent  computer analysis, of the data obtained,  created  a
highly-detailed magnetic contour map of part of this installation
(the  bulk  of  the  main installation lies  under  an  area  not
surveyed  on this occasion, but "linking" evidence indicates  its
direction and location) along with various tunnels, passages  and
entrances.  Exhibits  4,  5,  6, 7, 8, 9,  and  10  include  this
scientific information.

CONCLUSION (July 1989)

 It  is  the  opinion of the members  of  the  Phoenix  Project's
investigators  and  scientific  survey  teams,  based  on   their
personal  on-site  observations and in-depth study of  the  Pilot
Peak  (K-2)  site,  the  facts  revealed,  interviews  with  USFS
Rangers,  and  scientific analysis, that a  hidden,  underground,
major operational base of alien beings has been discovered.  This
investigation  and  survey were conducted by  highly-trained  and
credible  individuals  who  uncovered  --  incredible  facts.   A
complete  magnetic  survey of adjacent areas,  several  acres  in
extent, would reveal the true dimensions of this installation and
additional  valuable details, and is to be recommended.  However,
the  financial  cost of such an extensive survey  is  beyond  the
resources available to this group of investigators.

INFORMATION UPDATE

Date:  August 16, 1989 From: Staff # 1 Subject: Activity  Reports
concerning K-2

Comment from Staff # 1: Date: August 10, 1989, Time: 2215 PDT.

 At  2215  PDT, I received a phone call from Staff #  2  who  was
stationed forty miles southwest of K-2. In an excited manner,  he
described sighting a large glowing object that had, only  minutes
before, passed very near his observation point. He supplied a few
details. Knowing, from experience that the Phoenix Project phones
are being monitored by various government intelligence  agencies,
I  cut the conversation short and requested that  he  investigate
the  K-2  Site the next day and send me the complete  details  by
courier.  I received the following information from Staff # 2  on
August 14, 1989.

* * *

Report # 1: By Staff # 2: Date: August 10, 1989, Time: 2212  PDT.
Location: Approximately 40 miles southwest of K-2.

 A brightly glowing object was observed from my location. It  was
approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, moving slowly from south to
north at 500 feet above the tree-tops.

 When  first sighted, the object was approaching from  the  South
and slowing down. When opposite my observation point, it  stopped
in  mid-air  and hovered. The object was glowing  with  a  bright
white  light, as it approached. When it stopped and hovered,  the
color changed to a bright blue light.

 It  remained  stopped  for approximately  15  seconds,  then  it
changed back to a bright white color, as it started moving slowly
(10-15 mph) toward the North in the direction of K-2.

 Observations:  The object lit up the area, quite well,  when  it
was  glowing with the white light. No sound was produced  by  the
object.  Normal  animal  and  insect sounds,  in  my  area,  were
silenced.  A  light breeze, present before the  object  appeared,
disappeared.  Everything  became very still, as  the  object  was
approaching and while it was hovering.

 The  Moon  was still below the horizon. The sky  was  clear  and
dark, with stars clearly visible.

 A  "scanner" radio, I was monitoring, picked up severe noise  30
seconds  before, during, and while the object moved away from  my
location.

I did not experience any electrical effects (tingling or  prickly
sensations) during the sighting.

 The  sighting  lasted approximately 45 seconds.  There  was  not
enough time to get a camera and take pictures.

 Within  10  minutes, after the object left the area,  eight  Air
Force   jet  fighters  (F-4s,  judging  from  their   sound   and
appearance) and moving very fast, went overhead traveling in  the
same  direction  the  object had taken -owards  the  North.  Four
minutes  later, the fighters returned, heading south. I  presumed
the  object had been spotted by their radar. Their  quick  return
would indicate they lost radar contact with the object.

Report  # 3 By Staff # 2: Date: August 11, 1989, Time:  1500  PDT
Location: K-2

 Following the events of the night before, I made a quick trip to
check out the K-2 area.

 Observation:  There  was  a "burned" or  scorched  area  on  the
ground,  30  feet  in  diameter, at the  LZ-1  (landing  zone  1)
apparently, where an object had landed. In the rush to get there,
I  forgot  to take my camera. No pictures  were  obtained.  After
further  checking out the area, I left. I decided to  return  the
next day with a camera to get pictures of the burn marks.

* * *

Report  # 4 By Staff # 2: Date: August 12, 1989, Time:  1300  PDT
Location: K-2

 Observation:  Another  quick trip to K-2 -- this time  with  the
camera.

 "This  second trip -- brought a surprise. The burned round  mark
on  the  ground  wasn't there (the one I  had  observed  the  day
before.  The 30 foot diameter burned area). It looks like  "they"
(the  Greys)  had  removed everything that would  show  they  had
landed  there. I did some digging, but there was nothing to  show
for  it. They had replaced the ground (the burned area) with  new
soil, including the dead grass that covers the ground. They  seem
to know we are on to them, and are making it difficult for us  to
prove anything. From now on, the camera goes with me everywhere."
See Exhibits 19 and 20.

Memo August 12, 1989 From Staff # 1 To: Staff # 2

 Our contacts in the Air Force verify that on the night of August
10, 1989, at the time indicated in Report # 1 of that date,  that
eight  F-4's,  scrambled  from Beale AFB, CA. They  had  a  brief
radar-lock,  on  a "bogie" in the area described.  However,  they
lost the target, due to ground clutter when it suddenly descended
into  the mountainous terrain. They returned to the base  when  a
further sweep of the area proved fruitless.

 You're right, the AF had a blip on their radar, but lost it when
the ship dropped into that 20-mile approach corridor between  the
valleys and the radar dead zone.

* * *

Comments by Staff # 1 Date: 8/15/89, Time: 1300 PDT

 The events taking place, as described in the preceding  reports,
indicate  on-going activity at the K-2 site. This activity,  adds
weight  to  the conclusions and evidence gathered by  our  Survey
Team.  Those findings were included in the "K-2, Special  Report"
Dated  7/28/89. These recent events taking place at K-2  validate
our initial findings.

* * *

Comments by Staff # 1 Date: 8/29/89

 Observations of night-time activity at K-2, over the past month,
indicate  that  alien crafts are making supply runs at  two  week
intervals.  All of our attempts, on site, to photograph or  video
tape  their  arrival, unloading and departures have  failed.  The
aliens seem to detect our presence even though we have made every
effort to remain concealed. On two occasions, from our  concealed
location,  we have observed one of their craft making  a  landing
approach. The craft suddenly veers off, about two miles from  the
base,  and  quickly  leaves  the area.  For  both  practical  and
economic  reasons  we cannot continue this surveillance.  In  our
opinion,  we  have validated the existence of the  base  and  the
alien activity associated with this site.

* * * ADDENDUM:

6/23/92 ADDITIONAL CONCLUSION

 Previously, we mentioned the extreme curiosity exhibited by U.S.
Forest Rangers, and their barrage of questions while we conducted
the  scientific  survey of K-2 in July of 1989.  The  reason  for
their  conduct and questions became known in August of  1989  and
during  the course of subsequent investigations at K-2. Refer  to
Exhibit 21.

 As a result of the public disclosure of the Alien Base  revealed
in  this report, it will prove most interesting to  observe  what
action  is taken by any unit of the U.S. Government to deal  with
this  situation. It is doubtful they will allow an Alien Base  to
operate right under their noses.

 This  would  be an excellent occasion for the public,  in  large
numbers,  to  camp  out at the K-2 site,  use  their  home  video
cameras  to  record  what activity occurs and  whether  they  are
ordered to leave the area.

 Also, without a doubt, it is not difficult to predict a scenario
in  which well-paid and learned government experts will  proclaim
that no alien base exists at K-2. In the interim, nobody would be
surprised,  would they (??), if the area was suddenly fenced  off
by a double perimeter chain-link fence and patrolled by  security
guards.  The  public may even be denied any access to  the  area.
Now, what would that suggest to you?

 It's  something of a Catch-22 situation for the government.  Any
action  taken  to suppress the alien base will  be  revealed  and
noticed by the public, and any inction, hoping people will forget
it,  allows the aliens to continue their operations. It's  a  bad
situation  for the aliens, as well. All the publicity and  people
hanging  around the area will disrupt their activities.  Somehow,
the  term  "poetic  justice" seems  correct  in  this  situation.
Perhaps you'll agree.
