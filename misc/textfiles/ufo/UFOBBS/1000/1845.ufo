                   Initial Impressions of Lear Video Tapes

   I must say at the beginning, that the amount of video material that
John has supplied is impressive. My only misgiving is that all but the
last segment are taken from televised documentaries. I was hopeful that
the video material would include footage alluded to in the documentaries
that was not shown on screen. In several cases, particularly within the
documentary "UFO's Are Real" (Brandon Chase), there were references to
military footage of UFO's taken by military personnel.

   One of the most compelling films dealt with the CNN series on "The
Bentwaters Incident." There seemed to be quite a bit of circumstantial
evidence surrounding the alleged incident. The viewer is told through
interviews and artist conceptions, the details of the Bentwaters
UFO encounter. Allegations were made regarding physical evidence left
at the scene, but little or none of this was demonstrated by photos
of the effects. There was no indication within the context of the
Bentwaters Incident that correlates with John Lear's hypothesis except
one account by an eyewitness that one of the lead officers met briefly
with the aliens. Some of the possible explanations to explain the
pulsing light as an artifact of a lighthouse several miles away seemed
weak at first glance, but when an audio tape of the mission was
synchronized with the lighthouse frequency, there was a match. The
point was made that the correlation between the lighthouse pulsing and the
UFO pulsing did not continue. Without more information regarding the
encounter such as more physical evidence, this particular encounter
can not be taken at face value except to say that there is a chance that
something did happen, and maybe it involved UFO's of extraterrestrial
origen. As with all of these documentaries, it is difficult to pass
a judgment due to the lack of first hand knowledge and the tendancy for
television to capitalize on the sensational over the mundane. Still, I
would be interested in learning more about the Bentwaters Incident
because despite the problems I have mentioned, there are aspects of
the story that would likely be detailed in military documents that are
not currently available and the fact that this was carried on the news
without a great deal of hype, does lend some credibility to the idea
that something did in fact occur that has not been fully revealed.

   The least compelling documentary was "A Strange Harvest" which did
an excellent job of showing mutilations but was somewhat biased towards
a presumed extraterrestrial connection. Interviewed doctors were asked
leading questions regarding such matters as the lack of blood in the
specimens such as (and I'm paraphrasing) "there's no way then, that
you can account for the total lack of blood in the cadavers..." to which
the doctors explained a possible explanation being that the blood had pooled
on the underside of the body after death. Ms. Howe did not seem to pick
up on this point. For myself, unless the mutilations were made sometime
after death, one would have expected some blood in evidence around the
carcass. Some aspects were mysterious in any event such as the lack of
any physical evidence of how the animal got there, or why there were
such specific and consistent mutilations around the world. I have no
answer for this. The failure of the carcass to attract predators is
outside my area of expertise as well and is somewhat unusual at first
glance, however, I'm not about to rule out other mitigating circumstances.
Clearly the mutilations follow a pattern world wide... there are some
very unusual characteristics regarding the wounds which appear to only
be possible with technology beyond our own, again, I have no way of
validating this. The mere fact that the pattern is world wide does suggest
something strange... but as to what it means... this remains highly
speculative based solely on this documentary.

   The next two features; an HBO special "UFO's: What's Going On" and
"UFO's: It Has Begun," both offer further random hints at a coverup of
the UFO issue. In both cases, no hard evidence seems apparent, although
there is a reference in one of the documentaries, perhaps the last one
or the next one, showing a hand written note from J. Edgar Hoover of
the FBI explaining to  the army that they must allow access to the salvaged
alien spacecraft. That is one I can't explain away.

   The final documentary that I really understood was "UFO's Are Real" by
Brandon Chase which offered the greatest amount of video footage,
photocopied FOIA documents on UFO's, and an impressive display of
physical evidence, particulary regarding UFO landing sight soil
characteristics that was really turning the tide... until...

...the Billy Maier material was celebrated as one of the most complete
and significant cases of UFO evidence to date. Inclusive in the Maier
data was the contention that the photographs had been authenticated by
photographic analysis techniques. That last entry threw my entire
growing optimism that someone had done some exhaustive research into
doubt once more... this in the light of our recent feelings about the
veracity of the Maier materials.

   Despite the Maier material, I feel that this particular video presented
the most compelling evidence not only that UFOs are real, but that they
are literally not of this world. If followup on the specifics dealt with
in "UFO's Are Real" corraborates the conclusions drawn in the film, I
would be willing to accept the majority of the evidence as proof of
extraterrestrial involvement in earthly affairs.

   The last two entries, "The Tacoma Incident" and "Japanese Moon Pictures"
do not offer me any ideas at all regarding the UFO issue. I may need to view
these last two segments while following along in John's enclosed
documentation to glean whatever meaning they may have.

   Having viewed the video once, and skimmed the substantial number of
documents, I'm still unclear as to how John's hypothesis was arrived at
unless its a reference on one document that I have yet to locate. One
point seems much clearer to me now than it was before, there is no doubt
that there is something strange about UFO's and that they do represent
something that  we do not understand and that there may in fact be some
sentient beings involved from some other world. The Laear materials are
a good introduction to the scope of the UFO issue and I highly
recommend that anyone who is interested in UFO's should review these
materials. I myself must do alot more reviewing before making any final
summations. The jury is still out on the hypothesis Lear has presented
but I think the circumstantial evidence for the reality of UFO's is
enough to secure a conviction in most courts.

   I will likely have more to say about this at a later time, particularly
in light of the recent Texarkana sightings.
