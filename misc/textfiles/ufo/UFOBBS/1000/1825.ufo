Subj:Lear's Text
From: Brad Langton
To: Steve Gresser

Hi Steve,  I'm not sure you've been up on Lambda, but perhaps you
have read my rather caustic response, LANG.RES regarding the
Lear.txt that my initial reactions were inappropriate. I have been
enlightened regarding the mission of these forums. Our impatience
to get all the info yesterday has led many, including me, to be
premature in drawing conclusion. I'm not sure we haven't pressed
the reaction time.  I have interviewed Mr. Lear and while I have
many questions regarding the nature of his material, I'm willing
to give him a chance to present his case. I have found him anxious
to do so, and I'm sure he would be open to developing a similar
professional manner on these issues, yet we tend to forget that
we're human beings with fears, reflex reactions, an imprecise
language, and whether we like it or not... our own biases regarding
the UFO issue.  At one time I too experienced a sighting, without
putting anything on paper at the time. I never released it because
I was afraid of just the reaction Lear.txt has received.
Ironically, I was one of the first to put my emotions before my
head in dealing with the issue... not a good position for the sysop
of such a BBS! Why the idealized view of benevolent beings from
space being necessarily committed[ to the same values and ideals
as we here in western civilization. Examples from our own world,
even our august group of open minded skeptics in the Paranet
system, have altered this and do not take the time to give the guy
a chance to support his views,, then what are we doing this for in
the first place? Are we all, as Jim pointed out, fantasy prone even
at the level of discussion?  John has agreed to share this resource
of evidence with us. Perhaps Alpha will be afforded the same
opportunity if the climate here was a little less hostile. It took
a few days for Lambda to come around, but we have... and now, with
an OPEN mind, we're going to have the opportunity to see just what
Mr. Lear has to show us.
  It can't hurt, as one of Lambda's and Alpha's users has said,
"its time to put up or shut up." That's what we're about... that's
why we're here. I will keep you up on events from this end, but it
would be nice if we all could view the evidence that he is
presenting  Brad Langton
