SUBJECT: BILL COOPERS REASONS FOR GOING PUBLIC               FILE: UFO1855



This file contains the;  (1) My reason for releasing this
information to the public,  (2) My credentials,  (3) The
validity of the information (% from sources, % from my own
knowledge, % from research),  (4) The existance of one other
person to whom I gave the information in 1972 in anticipation
of one day needing to validate the information.

(1)  I have 2 reasons for releasing this information at this
time.  (A)  When I first saw the information I was sure that
the government would handle the situation and not allow the
people to be abducted, injured, or just disappear.  My belief
in the government has proven false.  Not only has it not been
handled but the situation has deteriorated and the incidents
have increased worldwide.  What has happened is against the
Constitution of the United States of America which I have
sworn to uphold and protect.  What is happening is against
every law in every state.  What is happening violates the
human rights of every citizen of the world.  It could happen
to any member or members of my family or your family at any
time.  I am a loyal american and have never divulged any of
my countrys secrets and except for this one I never will.  I
do not believe that revealing this secret is against the law
as the secret itself violates every law that has ever been
written.  Senator Barry Goldwater was the Chairman of the
Senate Commitee which aproved funds for the CIA and has
stated publicly that he has no knowledge of any of this.
That means and it is a fact that the Congress is ignorant of
what is going on.  In fact I believe that it is my duty to
expose it as thoroughly and as quickly as possible.  I only
regret that I have waited so long.  I waited because I
believed so much in our system of government.  THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT HAS BETRAYED ALL OF US.  (B) In my efforts
to get the information out it became obvious that soon the
government would discover what I am doing and my life would
be in danger.  I believe that my life is now in danger and
the only way to protect myself is to go public with the
information.  I realize that the information is hard to
swallow and that many people will not believe it.  I also
realize that I have exposed myself to ridicule.  So be it.
If I am prosecuted or harmed in any way you all will know
that the information is correct.  If I suddenly disappear you
will all know that the information is correct.

(2)  I am the son of an Air Force officer and was reared on
Air Force bases all over the world.  My father was a pilot.
As a child I repeatedly overheard pilots and airmen discuss
strange stories involving UFO's, Foo Fighters, strange
crashes of craft "not from here", and other subjects that
were exciting to me at the time.  I graduated from High
School in Japan and shortly there-after joined the Air Force.
I finished basic at Lackland Air Force Base and was assigned
to the Strategic Air Command.  I was an Aircraft and Missile
Pneudraulic Technician.  During my training instructors would
regale us with tales of lonely nights spent on flight lines,
alert pads, and missile silos.  They told of strange alien
craft that would come down and paralyse the men on station
and then remove the warhead from the missile and disappear at
fantastic speed.  I met a sargeant who told me that he was
part of a team that transported such a large crashed disk
that it could only be moved at night on back roads and fences
and poles had to be torn down and replaced as the convoy
passed.  I listened to all these stories and wondered what
was going on but didn't really believe them.  I was
discharged from the Air Force in 1965.  I was very
adventurous at the time and joined the navy in December of
1965.  I volunteered for submarines and was assigned to the
USS Tiru (SS-416) at Pear Harbor, Hawaii.  On a cruise to the
Portland Seattle area, while on lookout a UFO the size of an
Aircraft carrier rose up out of the water and disappeared
into the clouds while we were on the surface and I was the
Port lookout.  It descended back down into the water and rose
back up into the clouds again several times.  It was
witnessed by myself, The Starboard lookout, The Officer of
the deck, The Captain, and the Chief Quartermaster who took
pictures.  We were told not to discuss it with anyone ever.
Upon docking at Pearl upon our return a man in plain clothes
came aboard and talked to each of us with only the Captain
present.  He identified himself as an Intelligence Officer
(ONI) and asked me what I saw.  I began to tell him and he
yelled at me to stop and then he again asked me what I saw.
I told him that I had not seen anything and he smiled at me
and told me I was a very good sailor.  He told me that was
the right answer and dismissed me.  I soon grew tired of the
cramped quarters of a Submarine and de-volunteered.  The rest
of my history is as follows.

Since leaving the navy I have worked at several companies
engaged in work for the government or the intelligence
community.  Some of this work involved training foreign
military personnel.  I have also obtained a college degree in
photography.  This is a field I have long been interested in.

I am not now connected with the government or the
intelligence community except for friends that I have made
over the years.  Most recently I have been involved in
management of civilian training facilities.

Currently   The institute where I am presently employed is
known to 3 of you and I do not wish it to be disclosed as the
release of this information could have adverse affects upon
my employment.


(3)  Approximatly 50% of this information comes from
documents that I saw with my own eyes and I personnaly know
it to be true and absolutely accurate.  I saw and read GRUDG/
BLUE BOOK REPORT NO. 13.  I saw and read the MAJESTY document
which contained the Aquarius information.  I was present at a
briefing where much more information was discussed and some
of it has become cloudy over the years but has come back to
me when I saw information on that subject.  About 50% of the
information comes from my sources who will remain un-named.
About 60% of the information is backed up by research and
information available to you all however the information is
not generaly shared.  It is out there in various places and
on various boards.  Due to the potential monetary value of
the information I believe that it probably never will be
shared.


(4)  In 1972 I related this information to one other person
for self protection and so that the information could be
verified at some latter date should the government not handle
the situation.  I gave him the information on the eve of my
wedding.  The last person to person contact I had with him
was in 1974.  The last contact of ANY kind was in 1976 or
1977 by phone.  I have not seen him, written to him, phoned
him, or had any contact with him at all since that time.  I
maintained this distance to prevent any accusation of
collusion or hoax should it ever be neccessary to release the
information.  I also did it for his protection so that he
would not be involved if the government should decide to harm
me before the information could be released.  I have him a
copy of the information in the form of a copy of an original
document.  I retained the other copy but mine was destroyed
in a storage fire.  He can and will verify the information to
the right person with the right code (which we agreed upon)
to release it.  3 of you have his name, the last place he
lived in 1976, and the code.  I will not contact him until
the information is verified.  He can validate my intelligence
background and the information.  He can state all of this
truthfully and because of our seperation over the years will
be able to pass any lie detector test to prove this is not a
hoax.  I would also be able to pass the same test or any
other test, sodium pentathol etc.

I have also received a call from a man named Christopher who
called from an area code in Maryland.  By his conversation
with me on the phone I know that he has also seen the MAJESTY
information and the AQUARIUS document.  I also know that he
is a member of Compuserve.  That is all I know about him.  I
left out a graphic on the reconstructed document that I
posted in my MAJIC file and he questioned the ommission.  It
is a minor detail that I did not think important but he
spotted it.  The only way he could have known that the
graphic was missing would be that he has seen it himself.
The graphic was 2 lightning bolts which strike at the bottom
of the finned rocket which is enclosed in the circle.  Since
I could not put graphics in the document I only included a
short description.

I tested my father once by relating that I had seen
information while in the navy that the Government had
recovered UFO's which had crashed.  I did this to guage his
reaction because I knew that at one time when I was very
little he was the radar Officer at White Sands Proving
Ground.  He gave me a very knowing look and advised me not to
talk about it.  I have never discussed the matter with him
since.

COME FORWARD NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT ALL WHICH
WILL SUBSTANTIATE THIS INFORMATION.  THIS MAY BE THE ONLY
CHANCE TO EXPOSE THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION.  IF I FAIL YOU ALL
FAIL.
