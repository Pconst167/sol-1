CORN CIRCLES MYSTERY DEEPENS
Rings appear on dege of city
by: PAUL GREGAN

     The mystery of the corn circles deepened today after four huge rings appeared in fields on the edge of Peterborough.
     The perfectly formed rings-up to 100 metres across-have baffled fliers at Sibson aerodrome who spotted them.
     The fields of ripe wheat were untouched on Monday night-but the strange circular patterns materialised in the crops in just 48 hours afterwards.
     The Meacock family who run the Peterborough Parachute Centre live on the airfield and heard nothing during the nights they appeared.
     Alex Meacock was one of the first to examine the rings close up and does not think they are the work of hoaxers.
     "We would have seen them or heard them.  "These things are not small.  It would have taken an army hours to make them," he said.
     The smallest pattern is made of two concentric circles-but the flattened corn in the 30 metre outer circle is lying clockwise and inside the broader inner ring the stalks are anti-clockwise.
     The huge rings in a nearby field are up to three times as large.  One is two more concentric circles.  The other is one large ring with two spiral patches inside.
     One of the ring fields has a history of wind turbulence-blamed by some scientists for the rings all over the country-but the air over the other sites is usually calm.
     The Meacocks have never seen rings like this before and have videoed them from the air before the combine harvesters wipe them out for ever.
