Subject:  Additional  comments re documents released by William L.  Moore  in 
April 30, 1987 FOCUS.  Special Focus on MJ-12.

The  members of the MJ-12 Group were truly outstanding Americans all of  whom 
had  made major contributions during World War 2.   I have a mountain of data 
that links the various people all of whom have since died.

The  one surprising name on the list was that of Harvard Astronomer Donald H. 
Menzel.   I  had picked up on all the others in the course of reviewing  many 
files  at  the  National Archives,  the Library of Congress and  the  Truman, 
Eisenhower, and Kennedy Libraries.   DHM had written three anti-UFO books and 
made  numerous  negative comments about the reality of UFOs.   How  could  he 
possibly   have been a member of a top notch group(knowing full well in  July 
of  1947(after   the  crash and retrieval near Roswell NM of  an   Identified 
Alien  Craft)of   the alien origin of some UFOs??    I was stimulated by  the 
follow-up on  him by a brief letter in Bush's files from the attorney who had 
defended  DHM  in a USAF loyalty hearing in 1950.    There was nothing  about 
this hearing or  Menzel's clearing of any communist learnings in the NY Times 
which piqued my  curiosity.    I eventually gained access to Menzel's file at 
the   American  Philosophical   Society   Library   in   Philadelphia   (only  
contains   his  very extensive UFO correspondence),  the Menzel Files at  his 
Alma  Mater  (University  of   Denver)   and  most  important  after  getting 
permission  from  two  professors and his wife Florence,  the  all  important 
Menzel  files  at  Harvard.   There  was a great deal  of  evidence  strongly 
suggesting  that Menzel may indeed have  been  part  of  MJ-12.    In a  1960 
letter to President  elect  John  F.  Kennedy,   DHM stated that he had had a 
longer  continuous association with the highly  classified  National Security 
Agency  and  its  Navy  predecessor  agency than  any  other  person  (recent 
documents  prove  that the NSA has but refuses to release  even to a  Federal 
court  Judge  any of the more than 150 UFO documents it  admits  to  having).   
DHM  also noted that he had done classified work  for more  than  30  Defense 
Industry  contractors,   that he had a TOP SECRET  ULTRA security   clearance  
which made it all the harder for him to  understand  the USAF  fussing  about  
a  SECRET clearance.    His staunchest  defender  at  the extended   security 
hearings was Van Bush whom he had known since 1934!!    DHM served  the  Navy  
on  code  breaking  work  during  WW2,  taught  course  on cryptography,  had  
written a classified book on radio wave propagation,   and had  also  written  
many  science  fiction stories as well as  articles  for  a number  of  major 
newspapers.   He  was  very  heavily engineering oriented  besides  being  an 
astronomer.   Post  war  he served as the first commanding officer of a  Navy 
Reserve  cryptography unit.He was very well acquainted with Lloyd Berkner and 
Detlev Bronk.  Hunsaker was at nearby MIT.

At Harvard most of his associates new little about his government work.   His 
wartime  secretary  stressed  to  me  as did some others  that  he  was  very 
discreet.  He made very frequent trips to Washington DC, and also a myriad to 
New Mexico where the crashed saucer had been retrieved.   Menzel was aware of 
the  wartime breaking of the German Enigma code and of various disinformation 
schemes  to  fool the Germans and Japanese and had even learned  Japanese  to 
help  in deciphering.   He would have been an obvious choice to help decipher 
the  strange  symbols  found  on some of the Roswell  wreckage  and  to  help 
disinform  the  public  about this very important  subject.   His  UFO  books 
certainly  show  a great deal of nonscientific reasoning out of keeping  with 
his scientific work.  His first UFO book was even translated into Russian and 
helped  keep a whole generation of US and Soviet scientists from studying the 
UFO phenomenon.   He may very well have achieved one of the greatest feats of 
disinformation ever accomplished.

I  have  clear proof from the files of both Bush (library  of  Congress)  and 
Forrestal  (at  the  Forrestal Library at Princeton University where  I  have 
reviewed  them)  that they had indeed met with President Truman on  September 
24,  1947  and they had a long close and mutually admiring relationship  with 
each  other and with Truman,  frequently (in the 1947-49 period)  meeting for 
lunch  and often meeting with Truman.   It is interesting that  Hillenkoetter 
and  Souers had strong Navy ties,  Twining and Bandenberg,  strong Air  Force 
ties, and Gray and Montague strong Army connections.   All were at the top of 
the  Intelligence Community.   Bronkl besides being an Aviation  physiologist 
later  headed the National Academy of Sciences.   Hunsaker,  one of the  real 
aviation  pioneers  headed  the National Advisory  Committee  on  Aeronautics 
succeeding Bush in the late 1930s.  Bush was,  of course,  the US Science and 
Technology Czar during and after World War 2.  No one in the world was better 
suited to heading a small group of experts trying to determine the technology 
associated  with alien craft.   The following statement appears in a formerly 
Top-Secret  Canadian  memo dated November 21,  1950.   Speaking about  flying 
saucers  Wilber  Smith "made discrete enquiries through the Canadian  Embassy 
staff in Washington who were able to obtain for me the following information: 
a.  The  matter  is the most highly classified subject in the  United  States 
Government , rating higher even than the H-bomb. b. Flying saucers exist.  c. 
Their  modus  operandi is unknown but concentrated effort is being mad  by  a 
small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush.  d.  The entire matter is considered 
by the United States Authorities to be of tremendous significance."

There  is  truly  a mountain of evidence including more than  5000  pages  of 
documents  released under the Freedom of Information and the Canadian  Access 
to Information to establish that indeed the subject of UFOs represents a kind 
of Cosmic Watergate.  While I don't want all the technical data released ,  I 
do believe that Earthlings are indeed entitled to know that we are not alone.  
Havening  worked on classified government sponsored Research and  Development 
programs for 15 years,  I have a healthy respect for security and the ability 
of various government agencies to keep things secret.
