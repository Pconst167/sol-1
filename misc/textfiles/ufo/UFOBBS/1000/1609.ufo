EVIDENTLY NO LULL

   Based on one indicator, Indiana sightings (Indiana being on the `Top Ten'),
during the last eight months reported events a little over 60% of last years
total. Based on this more immediate information, and the fact that we are 60%
through 1990, we are pretty close to the same numbers for this time of year.
Also, input from other sources has resumed and the data appears to be pretty
consistent with that projection. As you may be aware, other input for June,
July & August is not yet showing up, but will within 30-60 days.

   I would not be surpised NOT to see a dramatic increase in significant
sightings for August-on, especially in the area of the Middle East, in light
of information that we have on file. However, this too, wouldn't show up until
October or November, except for some types of media coverage. Why an increase?
In the fall of 1973 we experienced a major world-wide UFO wave, the largets
concentration of sightings since 1952. It is quite interesting when you look
at the graphs which help illustrate the beginning, intensity, and end of the
wave.  At that time we were not collecting information on the total U.S. but
merely our region. According to research done by Richard Hall (`Uninvited
Guests'), in 1973 we had the OPEC oil embargo, a petroleum crisis and
political turmoil in the U.S., the Agnew resignation, and the last but
probably the important timely item, the Israeli-Arab war (Oct. 6-21).

   Our six state regional data showed a concentration of sightings which
started on October 5th & began to taper off on the 23rd. According to other
sources this pattern actually extended all over the country. The correlation
appears very suspicious at first glance. It seems to be meaningful when you
consider that four of our six states should be `rainguages' or `activity
indicators' since they are all on the top in the nation. Ohio ranks in 2nd
place in UFO activity, being 6th in population. Illinois ranks 6th, being 5th
in population.  Indiana ranks, 8th, being in 11th palce in population. And
Missouri ranks 9th, although 13th in population.

   Then according to Hall's research, in 1978 we had the continuing Middle
East Crisis, a petroleum shortage and an OPEC price increase. 1978 was another
peak year for UFO sightings, although not publicized. The wave occured between
October and December and was most intense in the Middle East, itself, and in
AUSTRALASIA! This includes Arab nations and an oil field landing at Kuwait.
When the regional graphs were checked to see if there was an increase in our
area, we were astonished to see that 1978 was another peak year. This time,
however, the sightings were spread out over the whole period. But it does
appear that multiple nation-threatening turmoil is the concern of ETI,
especially when it involves the Middle East. Their interest in our dependence
on fossil fuel is evidenced in the data.

   In the next few months it will be interesting to see if there are any cor-
relations with the current crisis, and especially if there is any UFO activity
reported in the Saudi Arabia/Iraq area. The big difference between older
events and the present situation, however, is that at press time we are not at
war, nor is anyone in that area.

   I just received the July/August 1990 issue of IUR by CUFOS and there was
yet another mention of interest. I.Scott, in his article `UFO Studies In The
Scientific Literature', mentioned: `I found significant relationships between
UFO activity and (a) sunspot activity, (b) power failures, (c) Israel military
activity. Nonsignificant relationships included war nerves, studied as years
of American wars and as years of American nuclear bomb testing...' I thought
this was an interesting independent comment and, also, an interesting
observation, since I had been thinking about the `war nerves' thing myself, in
the last few weeks in regard to other active periods.
