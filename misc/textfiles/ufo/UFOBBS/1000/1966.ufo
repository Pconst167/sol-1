	DID SATANIC CULT KILL HORSE?
	----------------------------

	SASKATOON (CP) - A Saskatchewan farmer suspects a satanic cult
	killed his horse and surgically removed its sex organs.

		Eugene Zagrodney, 38, of the Rose Valley area, said he
	found the family's pet gelding lying in a field Wednesday about
	60 metres from his farmhouse.

		It had an incision from the navel to the hind legs and
	its sex organs were gone.

		"I suspected cults," he said Friday.  "I've talked to
	somebody who knows about these cults and he said they probably
 mistook it for a stallion and when they found out it had no
 testicles it was abandoned.

		"The wounds were perfectly clean, there was no jagged
 edges," the farmer said.  "I used to work in a slaughterhouse
 and I've done my own slaughtering, and it had to be a sharp
 butcher knife or a scalpel."

		Nick Nation, head of veterinary pathology for the Alberta
	Agricultural Department, said coyotes are more likely to blame.

		In a recently published article in the Canadian Veterinary"
	Journal", Nation compared media reports of mysterious wounds on
	mutilated cattle with those known to have been caused by scavengers
 and finds them to be similar.
