GULF BREEZE UFOS CONTROVERSY HANGS OVER PANHANDLE TOWN

By Jennifer Tucker
Tribune Staff Writer

     GULF  BREEZE--Ringed by two story pines and six figure  real
estate, Gulf Breeze is a mostly unremarkable town severed by U.S.
98 in the Florida Panhandle.
     To  visitors,  its most memorable feature is a flashing neon
fish pointing the way to Pensacola Beach.
     To 6,000 residents,  its most pressing problem is a 70  mile
detour  around  the Pensacola Bay Bridge,  hit and crippled by  a
barge two weeks ago.
     In 16 years,  only two murders have torn this town.   In  12
years, only 10 bank robberies have occured.
        But  in  the last year and a half,  more than  135  local
witnesses have reported seeing something they can't identify.
     One  prominent  Gulf Breeze resident has taken more than  30
photographs  of  a UFO.   This man,  who protects  his  anonymity
behind  the name "Ed," has photographed a craft so fantastic  and
unfamiliar  that many people believe the pictures are first  rate
fakes.
     Skeptics  merely  point to the east where  Eglin  Air  Force
Base,  one of the country's largest military installations,  lies
like a wall to wall flying carpet.
     The  Gulf  Breeze  stories--told  to  the  nation  by  NBC's
"Unsolved  Mysteries"  and CNN,  among others--have inspired  UFO
researchers  to  undertake a dramatic debate of  possibility  vs.
probability.
     Researchers agree on only one thing:  Either the Gulf Breeze
UFO sightings are some of the most phenomenal ever  recorded,  or
the  Gulf  Breeze UFO sightings are some of the most  exaggerated
ever reported.
     Among the eyewitnesses are a federal judge, a politician and
a prominent physician.

THE NEIGHBORS
     Art and Mary Hufford don't even live in town.   Their homey,
ranch style house is on a sycamore lined street in  Pensacola,  a
bridge's drive away from Gulf Breeze.
     But the Huffords remember,  in perfect detail, an evening in
early November 1987.  The couple was in their car, just two miles
from home, when they saw something gray, oval and silent fly over
the treetops, Art says.
     The  craft  remained in view for several minutes,  yet  when
they got home and talked about it, Art says they couldn't come up
with a rational explanation.
     "It  just didn't make any sense," says Art,  a  soft  spoken
chemical engineer with a master's degree and 25 years' experience
at Monsanto Chemical Co.
     Both  Huffords  are elders in the Presbyterian  church,  and
Mary is a sustaining member of the Junior League of Pensacola.
     "We  thought UFOs were something that happened to Billy  Bob
out on a boat after too many beers," Art says, wryly.
     But then, several weeks after their sighting, the couple saw
Ed's  photographs  in the Pensacola edition of  the  Gulf  Breeze
newspaper.   "It  was like someone had taken a picture out of our
brains," Art says.  "That was it."
     Through 1988, the couple shared their experience with others
similarly affected.  At social gatherings, when Art mentioned the
sighting,  he  says  people would pull him aside  with  whispered
confessions of their own experiences.
     And  Art is convinced that what he saw was not a product  of
modern technology or man made trickery.
     "Frankly," Art says, "the debunkers make me mad.  I saw what
I saw."

PARTY INVITATIONS
     Fenner  and  Shirley McConnell of Gulf Breeze had  sent  out
invitations to their annual June get together with tongue planted
firmly in cheek.
     The  front  of the invitation featured a  cartoon  of  alien
creatures  rollicking through city streets,  and inside they told
revelers it would be a "UFO watching party."
     Two  days  before the 1988 party,  the  couple  says,  their
invitation sprang to life outside their bedroom window.  They saw
a cylindrical craft,  ringed in windows and lights, hovering over
Pensacola Bay.
     Fenner  McConnell,  a  physician and  medical  examiner  for
Florida's District 1,  says the craft came within 75 yards of the
house, and at one point "I thought it was going to land on it."
     Shirley McConnell,  a caterer,  says she was overcome by "an
eerie  feeling,"  but she immediately recognized the  craft  from
Ed`s photographs.
     The  couple went outside to get a better look.   It  hovered
for  nearly four minutes and then "kind of drifted away,"  Fenner
McConnell says.
     "I'm  not  saying that I believe it's from another  planet,"
Shirley McConnell says, "but it's something I had never laid eyes
on in my life.  People can say whatever they want about me, but I
know what I saw.  Ed didn't make this up."
     Likewise,  Brenda Pollak says the large,  lighted craft  she
saw  twice  in  one  night during the spring of 1988  was  not  a
figment of her imagination.
     She  was driving east across the Pensacola Bay  Bridge  when
she saw it the first time,  looking "too big and too bright...and
very different from anything I had ever seen before."
     Nearing  her home on Shoreline Drive in Gulf Breeze,  Pollak
pulled  into the parking lot of the city's recreation center  and
parked.
     She  says she watched the craft hover over the  bay--unaware
that  a few blocks away,  Ed was taking a photograph of the  very
same craft.
     "I  was exhilarated," says Pollak,  a two term City  Council
member who works with Ed on community projects.
     "I  can tell you now--for every one person who has  reported
seeing the craft,  there are 10 who talk about it but don't  want
anyone to know," Pollak adds.
     "And  I can also tell you if this is a hoax,  it can't be Ed
because  it would make him look like an idiot and  the  community
look crazy."

THE RESEARCHERS
     Scientists can't help making comparisons.
     In  the  1970's,  a  Swiss laborer named Edward  Meier  took
hundreds of photographs of a 'spaceship' near Zurich.
     Although  some  people consider his  photographs  authentic,
others  believe  they  are fakes,  basing  their  conclusions  on
damning photographic analyses.
     Nevertheless,  scientists acknowledge that Meier`s  pictures
are remarkably clever.
     So  it is with Ed,  whose photographs have been analyzed and
scrutinized  by  two  of  the  country's  foremost   photographic
experts.
     Moreover,  the  photographs--and Ed's cooperation with  some
UFO  investigators--have caused a political rift so powerful that
participants  think  the  case could damage  the  future  of  UFO
research in America.
     At odds are investigators with the Mutual UFO Network,  a 20
year  old group of scientists and 'grass roots' researchers,  and
the Center for UFO Studies,  a non profit conclave founded by  J.
Allen Hynek, a leading American astronomer who died in 1986.
     Network directors support Ed's story; the center does not.
     The  network bases its opinion primarily on the findings  of
Bruce Maccabee,  a Naval physicist studying optics and underwater
sound in addition to working with the FBI.
     The  center bases its opinion on its own researchers as well
as  on Robert Nathan,  a member of the technical staff of  NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

INTRICATE REPORT
     Maccabee,   who  published  an  intricate  90  page   report
examining the evidence, concludes that the photographs are real.
     He   applied   the   properties  of  physics   and   various
mathematical theories to determine things such as the size of the
ship,  the  distance  of the craft from the camera lens  and  odd
angles of the photographs.
     More important, Maccabee says, he wasn't "biased by the idea
that it's too impossible,  therefore it can't be real."   Critics
would  "rather take the approach that if the pictures could  have
been hoaxed then they must have been," he says.
     Maccabee  reasons  that  Ed  could not  have  performed  the
photographic feats necessary to pull off such an elaborate  hoax.
"A professional magician would have a difficult time doing this,"
he says.
     Last year,  staffers at a Pensacola television station tried
to reproduce Ed's photographs using a model.   They gave up after
their attempts failed miserably, Maccabee says.
     He  further admonishes skeptics for questioning the look  of
the craft--"Nobody knows what UFOs look like," Maccabee says.
     And  he  points  out  what he considers to  be  the  weighty
circumstantial  evidence in Ed's favor--including testimony  from
friends and witnesses, one of them Ed's wife.
     Skeptics,  however,  side with NASA's Nathan.   Although  he
acknowledges  that he "hasn't given the pictures the kind of care
Bruce  has,"  Nathan says a visual  examination  reveals  glaring
inconsistencies--typical of double exposures.

IRREGULARITIES IN PHOTOS
     The  spaceship  is  brighter  and more  in  focus  than  the
background,  he  says,  and these irregularities are repeated  in
picture after picture.
     Nathan  concludes  that the object looks like "a gas  burner
turned  upside  down" and that its apparent lack of  symmetry  is
simply  "inconsistent  with what you would expect from  a  highly
developed society."
     Mark  Rodeghier,  scientific director of the Center for  UFO
Studies,  says  the  Gulf Breeze case has  "deteriorated  into  a
shouting  match"  because  his organization was  forced  to  play
devil's advocate.
     Investigators  with the Mutual UFO Network were too quick to
judge  the photographs favorably,  he says,  and  those  comments
biased Maccabee's analysis.
     "Except  those  intimately connected with  the  network,  90
percent  of serious UFO researchers think Gulf Breeze is a hoax,"
Rodeghier concludes.
     Among those who agree with that assessment is Philip  Klass,
considered  the country's premier debunker of UFOs.   Although he
has  not  seen the Gulf Breeze photographs,  Klass  says  he  has
scanned Maccabee's report and finds it improbable.
     "Any UFO case,  whether it involves pictures or not, is sort
of  like  that  old  adage  that a woman  cannot  be  10  percent
pregnant.   If one photo is a hoax,  then they all must be thrown
out,"  says  Klass,  who surmises that the  photographs  are  too
"suspect" to be real.
     Klass  reiterates  his  claim by stating,  "In 22  years  of
investigating,  I have never investigated or heard of a UFO  case
that cannot be explained in prosaic terms."

JUST THE FACTS
     "I  deal in facts," says Jerry Brown,  Gulf Breeze's 42 year
old  chief  of police,  whose carpeted office smells  faintly  of
cinnamon and coffee.
     "Granted--anyplace,  any time,  anything can happen to  you.
But  why  would people call about a prowler and not call about  a
UFO that's landed in their yard?"
     The  police chief knows Ed and likes him.   Yet  Brown  says
he's  concerned  about  the possibility "that one  person,  as  a
practical  joke...could destroy what it's taken so many years  to
build."
     Ed`s supporters,  meanwhile,  believe Gulf Breeze  attracted
the  unknown visitors because of the reputation the city  already
had built--as a well off, well educated, open minded community.
     "There  is  a direct correlation between education  and  the
acceptance  of  the UFO phenomenon," says  Donald  Ware,  Florida
director of the Mutual UFO Network.
     "I  am  convinced  the  reason one man  was  given  so  many
photographic opportunities is because the aliens wanted us to see
those pictures," Ware says.
