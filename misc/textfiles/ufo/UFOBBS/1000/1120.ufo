The next day, the Air Force officers took Hoyt, his sister and nephew
to Hawthorne Municpal Airport, where they flew them to a command post
a few miles from the crash site, he says.  The visitors were treated
to lunch, then driven back up the mountain road where Hoyt said he
saw the crash.
 
"They wanted to know what the angle was when it came down," he said.
"They used some tool to measure something after we pointed at the
spot."

After developing the film in Hoyt's camera, he says, the Air Force
returned two sets of enlarged prints of the family camping trip -
minus the frames that could have shown the descending aircraft.

An Air Force officer who interviewed Hoyt and his relatives asked
them not to talk to anyone about what they saw,  "but said he couldn't
force me," he said.

The Air Force will confirm only that a plane crashed, killing its
pilot.  It refuses to divulge what kind of aircraft, the base from
which it took off or its mission.

Military guards armed with M-16 rifles have sealed off a large area
around the crash site.

Back home in Redondo Beach, Hoyt says he feels a bit bewildered by
all the attention his claims have brought.

Grandview residents were among several people who reported seeing
unidentified flying objects on Thursday morning and Sunday evening.

On Thursday, a Wapato policeman was the first to spot a UFO, about
4 a.m.  The object travelled slowly, and was last seen near Prosser
about 6 a.m.  It was described as large and changed colors.  Although
small in the night sky, it was larger than a star or planet.

An object brighter than a planet was spotted over the Rattlesnake Hills,
north of Grandview, on Sunday evening about 10:30 p.m.  It changed
colors rapidly.  A witness described it as alternating red and green,
and a ray of light seemed to be coming out the bottom.

RAAF has no plans to seek car-sized UFO 
 
An unidentified flying object much bigger then a family car" is lying
at the bottom of Encounter Bay Victor Harbor, after plummeting to
earth soon after midday on Saturday.
 
The object, unofficially logged as a meteorite by the RAAF base at
Edinburgh, was seen by dozens of people from as far south as post
MacDonnell in the South-East and south-Western Victoria.
 
Senior Constable G.A. Clemow, of Beachport, said he and several other
Beachport people had seen a large, smoke-colored vapor trail left by
the object as it speed past at cloud height.

The trail had taken more then five minutes to begin dispersing. Sen
Const Clemow said a thornleigh farmer Mr.Neil Sutherland, had told
him the object looked like a rocket, with a propeller-like device
at the rear, fins and a fair bit of red paint.
 
Mr.Sutherland had described the fast-moving tube as much bigger then
a family car.

Beachport resident Mr Gary Chambers said he had seen the object for
only a few seconds as it came down. It looked like a falling star,
but in broad daylight, Mr Chambers said it was very high up I thought
it burned up above the horizon.
 
Mr George Thorn, of Victor Harbor said his wife had seen the object
falling towards the sea. Moments later, though binoculars, he had
seen what he thought at the time to be a very large red and white
boat bobbing up and down in the heavy swell, about five kilometres
offshore. It had sunk monents later and three boats found nothing.
 
Police and RAAF Officials said they knew of no plans to look for the
object, lying in at least 20 fathoms of water.  A department spokesman
in Adelaide said no RAAF Hercules had reported anything and there
was no sighting on any radar screens. He said the department would
investigate but he knew only what had been reported. He said he was
curious about a witness who described the object as looking like a
"cruise missile."

What does a cruise missile look like?  I work in defence I've never
seen one, he said as for the chance that the object was an extraerrestrial
that not show up on radar, the spokesman said with a chuckle: "There's
a possibility it could be anything, if in fact there is something,
but at the moment we know nothing."
