This is a plot of the 6 equations that I found by my curvefit
program to estimate coming years for UFO flaps. The years for
previous UFO flaps were given as 1947, 1952, 1957, 1965, and
1973 which I got from a UFO encyclopedia entry. In the plot
below A=39.3+(6.5*X) where X is the flap number.

From an online encyclopedia on UFOs, I found that UFO flaps
or waves occurred in 1947,1952,1957,1965, and 1973. I used a
mathematical curvefit program on this info to find an equation
that fit this. Next, I incremented that equation into the
future to find when the next UFO flaps should happen. The next
should be spring or summer of 1991 and again in late 1997 or
early 1998. This might help some UFO researchers be better
prepared to do their investigations.
