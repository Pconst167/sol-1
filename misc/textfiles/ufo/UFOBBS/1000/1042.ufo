PART 5

ALIEN CRAFT

THESE ARE FLYING CRAFT WHICH USE GRAVITY AND ELECTRO MAGNETIC FIELDS
TO FLY.  I REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE BUT SOMEHOW GRAVITY
CAN BECOME ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT I
KNOW TO EXPLAIN IT.  THE CRAFT HAS AN ATOMIC REACTOR ON BOARD ABOUT
THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL.  THE CRAFT CAN "CLOAK". THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD
IT IS THAT IT BENDS LIGHT RAYS (AND CAN DO THE SAME WITH RADAR) SO
THAT YOU LOOK AT THE CRAFT AND SEE ONLY WHAT IS BEHIND IT.  THEY CAN
DO THIS WHEN THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE SEEN.  A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGY
OF OUR STEALTH BOMBER CAME OUT OF THIS.  A LOT OF THE INFORMATION
REGARDING THE ALIEN CRAFT THAT I SAW HAD A LOT TO DO WITH EINSTIENS
THEORY OF RELATIVITY. THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION REGARDING SPACE/TIME
"FOLDS".  MY EDUCATION WAS NOT EVEN IN THIS BALLPARK SO I REALLY CAN'T
TELL YOU MUCH BUT I LEARNED THAT THEIR CRAFT ARE NOT ALL THAT STABLE
IN AIR (THATS WHY SO MANY CRASH) BUT ARE STILL ABLE TO DO THINGS THAT
WE HAVE ONLY DREAMED OF.  THEY CAN TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE ACROSS/THROUGH
A "FOLD" IN A VERY SHORT TIME.


ALF

ALF IS THE ABREVIATION FOR "ALIEN LIFE FORM".  THIS IS THE ONLY TERM
THAT I HAVE SEEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE ALIENS.  THE ALIEN LIFE FORMS
ARE "MALEVOLENT" (DANGEROUS).  THEY REQUIRE BLOOD AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL
FLUIDS TO SURVIVE.  YES THEY DO LIKE ICE CREAM (NO JOKE) BUT THEY
CANNOT LIVE ON IT.  THEY ABDUCT HUMANS AND ANIMALS TO PROCURE THESE
FLUIDS.  THE ALIEN LIFE FORMS ABDUCT HUMANS AND IMPLANT A VERY SMALL
DEVICE/DEVICES IN OR NEAR THE HUMAN BRAIN WHICH GIVES THEM TOTAL CONTROL
OVER THAT HUMAN.  THE IMPLANTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT BUT CAN
BE DETECTED.  THE DOCUMENTS STATED THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE THE
IMPLANTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF THE PATIENT (1972).  THEY PERFORM
SURGICAL OPERATIONS ON HUMANS.  THEY COLLECT SPERM/OVA AND OTHER
BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FROM HUMANS.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS HAS YET TO BE
DETERMINED.  THESE ABDUCTIONS ARE ONGOING.  A LIST OF ABDUCTEES IS
PROVIDED BY THE ALIENS TO MAJI ON A PERIODIC BASIS.  THE ALIEN ALSO
CLAIM TO HAVE PLAYED A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART IN THE WORLDS RELIGIOUS
HISTORY AND HAVE PROVIDED MAJI WITH SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.  (See
description at the end of this document.)


UFO/IAC

UFO IS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT AND CAN BE ANYTHING UNIDENTIFIED
BUT USUALLY REFERS TO SUSPECTED ALIEN CRAFT.  IAC IS IDENTIFIED ALIEN
CRAFT.


BLUE BOOK

THIS WAS AN AIR FORCE UFO/ALIEN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND DISINFORMATION
PROJECT.  THIS PROJECT WAS TERMINATED AND ITS COLLECTED INFORMATION
AND DUTIES WERE ABSORBED BY PROJECT AQUARIUS.  CLASSIFIED REPORT NAMED
"GRUDGE/BLUE BOOK REPORT NO. 13" IS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION
DERIVED FROM THE PROJECT AND IS UNAVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. (FROM WHAT
I READ FROM BILL ENGLISH IT SEEMS THAT HE REALLY SAW THIS REPORT AS
HE DESCRIBES THE SAME INFORMATION THAT I SAW IN "GRUDGE/BLUE BOOK
REPORT NO. 13.)


I have information now (its about time) that the existance of Project
GABRIEL has been confirmed.  The weapon was developed and assembled
at Ling Tempco Vought in Anahiem California. It was described to me
as being able to totally level ANY man made structure from a distance
of 2 miles.  It was tested at White Sands Proving grounds.  It was
developed between 1975 and 1978.  It is a long horn shaped device
connected to a computer and amplifiers.

I have also confirmed the existance of an alien craft at a hanger
at Edwards AFB.  The hanger is at North Base.  It has been guarded
by NON Edwards personnel (NRO - DELTA).  The guards had a badge that
was red with a black triangle on the face of the badge.  No one was
allowed near the hanger without the badge.  These people are no longer
guarding the hanger.  The Edwards security force are instructed to
check the hanger each hour and report status.  The hanger is locked
and no one is allowed inside.  Edwards security personnel have been
instructed never to enter the hanger even if it has been broken into.

I have also confirmed the esistance of alien material at a hanger
designated HANGER 1051 at Edwards AFB.

This is the insignia that is on the alien craft.  It is called a
TRILATERAL insignia.  I do not know what it means. It is in GRUDGE/BLUE
BOOK REPORT NO. 13 and my sources confirm that this is the alien flag
so to speak.


MALEVOLENT ALIEN LIFE FORM (ALF) DESCRIPTION


The typical MALEVOLENT (ALF) as represented thus far can be described
as follows:

          1.  Between 3 to 5 ft. in height.

          2.  Erect standing biped.  Long thin legs.

          3.  Small build (thin).

          4.  Head larger than normal (to human proportions).

          5.  Absence of auditory lobes (external earlobes).

          6.  Absence of body hair.

          7.  Large, tear shaped eyes, opacque black with
              veretical slit pupils (cats eye).

          8.  Eyes slanted approx 35 degrees

          9.  Small straight mouth, thin lips.

         10.  Arms resemble praying mantis (normal attitude).
              Arms reach to knees (extended).

         11.  Long hands (small palm)

         12.  Claw like fingers, two short, two long.
              (webbed)

         13.  Tough, gray skin, reptile like in texture.

         14.  Small feet, 4 small claw like toes.

         15.  Some Organs are similar to humans but developed
              in a different evolutionary process.

         16.  The most significant finding is that they have
              a Nonfunctioning digestive system and two
              separate brains.  Digestive system in those
              examined were atrophied.  Conforms to absence
              of provisions in recovered craft.  (Prelininary
              finding)

         17.  Movement is deliberate, slow, precise.

         18.  (Secondary finding after study)
              Alien subsistance requires that they must have
              human blood and other human biological
              substances to survive.  In extreme
              circumstances they can subsist on other animal
              fluids.  Food is converted to energy by
              chlorophyl through photosynthesis and waste
              products are excreted through skin.  (Did they
              evolve from plant life?  Not known at this
              time.)  These creatures possess two separate
              brains separated by mid cranial lateral bone
              partition (anterior brain - posterior brain)
              with no apparent connection between the two.
