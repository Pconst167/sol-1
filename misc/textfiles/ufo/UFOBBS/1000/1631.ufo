  The UFO activity in Gulf Breeze, FL continues. According to a full page story
in the GB Sentinel, several witnesses observed and photographed a UFO on
January 8. (GB Sentinel, Jan. 11, 1990.) This time the witnesses included Duane
Cook (Editor of the Sentinel) and his wife. Two photographs were published. One
of the photos, taken by Chip Holston, appears to show "portholes" in the craft.
The article in the paper gives the story as reported separately by seven
different witnesses. After the UFO disappeared, numerous helicopters were
observed in the same general area.
