POSITION STATEMENT ON THE 1987-88 UFO SIGHTINGS
OF GULF BREEZE, FL

     As MUFON State Director living only 44 miles from Gulf Breeze,
I have helped coordinate the activities of seven local investigators
and three internationally known investigators of the many UFO
reports in this area.  There have been at least 68 reports of objects
that, after various amounts of investigation, we have not been able
to identify as either naturally produced or made by man.  These
include 135 witnesses of which 4 reported alien beings, 6 reported
blue beams, and 9 reported periods of missing time suggesting
abductions.  Over 60 UFO photographs have been taken.

     I am convinced that these sightings are proof of alien visitation.
The level of technology demonstrated indicates they can come and
go at will and can reside in a variety of places: the bottom of our
oceans, inside major high altitude ice fields, in earth orbit, on the
moon, on Mars, etc..

     One might ask why one couple in Gulf Breeze has been allowed
18 photographic sessions. The most obvious reason to me is the
aliens want people to see the photographs.  I hope this causes more
people to give serious thought to the idea that we, as an intelligent
species, are not alone in the universe.
