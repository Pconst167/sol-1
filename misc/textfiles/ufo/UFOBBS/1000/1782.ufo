SUBJECT: DON MASON RESPONDS TO COOPER                        FILE: UFO1782



Bill Cooper...
 Its a little bit difficult to to try and digest some of the drivel 
 that comes from what you are trying to make us belive..First of all
 most of everything that you`ve tried to say you got from John Lear
 as he has made his atempts at before and both of you tried the same
 thing on Para net Alpha. Now neither you or John have come out with
 anything but rehash of what others have been saying for quite some
 time. Some of the information is valid and some is pure crap..
  Now if you will recall when you started out you wanted to play games
 with everyone but that didn`t work because Jim Spieser nailed both of
 you for all of your nonsense. If you remember right off awhile back
 you admitted that a lot of your text was false and you did it on purpose.
 Also Spieser took you off of Paranet Alpha because of the games you were
 trying to play on his board and it was determined that you were putting
 out a lot of bunk there.      Now Mr. Cooper if you really want to help
 the cause,get some information that will add to what is known along
 with some evidence and put that out.. As far as your citing the O.H
 Krill papers, big deal you got that from John and by Mr."Krills "own
 admission that has been around for a while. Also if you look into it
 and do alittle research you`ll find that a lot of what Krill put togather
 was already published material and done by John Keel and many others.
 You might also read some of the old APRO files and you`ll find most of the
 rest of the information that`s in the Krill papers. All Krill did was
 put a bunch of what was known  togather to make it easier for alot of
 the people to see and to see how it fits togather.
 Above all of this Bill, I do feel that you do have the right to your
 say, but you need to remember that you need something to back up what you
 state in order to get the people to belive you. AS I told you before
 "without the evidence, somethings are best not said"..
 Oh ya, in case you haven`t looked at the printed copy of the O.H. Krill
 papers that John Lear has,the name Krill is merely an AKA (false name) the
 party that wrote it was so proud of it he didn`t want to put his name on
 it. It was done by a friend of Mr. Lears and some of us know who it is.
 Also on page three of the report it lists the names of the people that the
 material was actually done by.
 Now then if you want to make some postive input that you can substantiate
 in some manner, I`ll be glad to listen to it...
 Wish you well in better endeavors than what you`ve ventured into so far..
