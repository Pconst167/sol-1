RELATED INFO FROM FENWICK.INT OFFERED AS A PREAMBLE TO PROJ.BET
---------------------------------------------------------------

      If there is reason to question the accuracy of the information pre-
sented in the original AQUARIUS/MJ-12 document as well as the information
in the recent documents pertaining to MJ-12, does this logically imply
that the 1980 Kirtland/Bennewitz events should be considered questionable?
Any single-witness UFO sighting has always been somewhat questionable,
this is exactly why we look for multiple witnesses and any other support-
ing evidence. If Richard Doty, or Paul Bennewitz were alone in reporting
these incidents then the Kirtland events would never have become as major
an issue as they have. However there were numerous individuals involved
not only in the events precipitating the documents but in the preparation
of the documents themselves. A brief summary of the incidents is as fol-
lows:

      Early 1980, Paul Bennewitz becomes involved in observing and filming
      objects which he has sighted on the ground and in the air near Kirt-
      land AFB and the Manzano range. Reportedly his wife was also present
      to witness some of the first landings he witnessed and filmed in the
      Coyote Canyon area. Subsequently he contacts Earnest Edwards of the
      Kirtland Security Police who, over the period of the next few
      months, becomes concerned and requests the guards on the Manzano
      Weapons Storage Area report to him any sightings of unusual aerial
      lights. At the beginning of August 1980 three guards report sighting
      an aerial light which descends on the Sandia Military Reservation.
      This is the first sighting described in the complaint form signed by
      Richard Doty. Edwards reports the sighting to Doty unaware that Doty
      has already heard from Russ Curtis (Sandia Security Chief) that a
      Sandia Security guard sighted a disc-shaped object near a structure
      just minutes after the sighting by the three Manzano guards. Doty
      includes these reports and several others in his Complaint Form and
      forwards the report to AFOSI Headquarters in Washington.


From this point on many other persons became involved. Bennewitz was
called down to a meeting at Kirtland AFB at which several major Air Force
officers and Sandia personnel were present, including a Brigadier General.
Earnest Edwards has confirmed that the three guards under his command re-
ported what was described, and that the meeting took place. Bennewitz has
confirmed that Doty and Jerry Miller came to his home to view his mater-
ials and there is a document signed by Thomas A. Cseh, Commander of the
Base Investigative Detachment, to confirm this. Finally there is the com-
plete set of documents which were released by AFOSI Headquarters under
cover of the Department of the Air Force relating to the described events.


<Fenwick> "How old is John [Lear] by the way?"

 <Mickus> "He's about your age, in his 50's. He talks about SDI as
          being a weapon against the EBEs."

<Fenwick> "Oh yes, of course it is. That's well known among certain
          UFOlogists."

 <Mickus> "Could you elaborate then?"

<Fenwick> "Okay. Part of the exchange of technology which started in
          1975 was [that] SDI was given to the Americans."

 <Mickus> "What...lasers, particle beams?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, all this sort of thing. There was a little bit
          given mentally...in the 1930's to Bertrand Russel and
          Albert Einstein, about stealth technology. Which
          culminated in the 'Philadephia Experiment'. That was
          stealth technology, but the ship...[had] invisibility
          to radar, not invisibility...invisibility to radar.
          And that was continued. Then [with] the agreement,
          they were given more information in 1975 as to how to
          really set-up the stealth technology, also [with] the
          'Star Wars' system. Supposedly the 'good guys' are
          coming into this planet, and the 'grays' want to repel
          them using the Star Wars technology. Star Wars is not
          Soviet vs. American. It's Gray vs. the Nords or the
          tall ones. That's all it is. Its a cover operation.
          This is one of the things that John Lear was talking
          about, and Linda Howe...and also a fellow down in
          Arizona who has his scientific labs next to Kirtland
          Air Force Base."

 <Mickus> "You know the name of the lab?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, 'thunder'. Dr. Paul Bennewitz who is an electronics
          engineer. He was involved with the Kirtland sightings
          and so on. He's mentioned that 'stolen telex', having
          taken photographs of UFOs and so on...film, he's
          filming them."

 <Mickus> "This is the telex that Moore reproduced?"

<Fenwick> "Yes. He re-typed it.....

PROJECT BETA
---------------------
BY DR. PAUL BENNEWITZ

THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MILE POSTS ESTABLISHED OR DISCOVERED DURING THE
CONTINUING STUDY CONCERNING ALIEN INTERVENTION AND THE RESULT.  THE STUDY
IS SOLELY LIMITED TO NEW MEXICO.

1) TWO YEARS CONTINUOUS RECORDED ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND TRACKING
WITH D.F. 24 HR/DAY DATA OF ALIEN SHIPS PLUS 6,000 FEET MOTION PICTURE
OF SAME-

2) DETECTION AND DISASSEMBLY OF ALIEN COMMUNICATION AND VIDEO CHANNELS -
BOTH

3 ) CONSTANT RECEPTION OF VIDEO FROM ALIEN SHIP AND UNDERGROUND BASE
VIEWSCREEN; TYPICAL ALIEN,HUMANOID AND AT TIMES APPARENT HOMO SAPIEN.

4) A CASE HISTORY OF AN ENCOUNTER VICTIM IN NEW MEXICO WHICH LEAD TO THE
COMMUNICATIONS LINK AND DISCOVERY THAT APPARENTLY ALL ENCOUNTER VICTIMS HAVE
DELIBERATE ALIEN IMPLANTS ALONG WITH OBVIOUS ACCOMPANYING SCARS.  THE VICTIMS
CAT SCAN.  FIVE OTHER CASES WERE VERIFIED.

5) ESTABLISHED CONSTANT DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE ALIEN USING A COMPUTER AND
A FORM OF HEX DECIMAL CODE COMMUNICATION WAS INSTIGATED APPARENTLY

6) THROUGH THE ALIEN COMMUNICATION LOOP,THE TRUE UNDERGROUND BASE LOCATION

7) SUBSEQUENT AERIAL AND GROUND PHOTOGRAPHS REVEALED LANDING PYLONS, SHIPS ON
THE GROUND- ENTRANCES, BEAM WEAPONS AND APPARENR LAUNCH PORTS- ALONG WITH ALIENS
ON THE GROUND IN ELECTROSTATICALLY SUPPORTED VEHICLES; CHARGING BEAM WEAPONS
ALSO APPARENTLY ELECTROSTATIC.

8) CROSS CORRELATION AND MATCHING BY TRIANGULATION,ETC, TO OFFICIAL NASA CIR
(COLOR IR) HIGH RESOLUTION FILMS CONFIRMED BASE LOCATIONS AND RESULTED IN
REVEALING US MILITARY INVOLVEMENT YIELDING PRECISE COORDINATES AND THE US BASE
LAYOUT.

9) PRIOR ALIEN COMMUNICATION HAD INDICATED MILITARY INVOLVEMENT AND THE FACT
THAT THE USAF HAD A SHIP BUT DUE TO STUDIED ALIEN PSYCHOLOGY THIS WAS IGNORED AT
THE TIME.

10) SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ALIEN COMMUNICATED FOLLOWING VERIFICATAION WITH THE CIR,
THAT THERE WAS INDEED A SHIP; ACTUALLY MORE THAN ONE- THAT TWO WERE WRECKED AND
LEFT BEHIND AND ANOTHER BUILT- THIS SHIP IS ATOMIC POWERED AND FLYING.  THE
ALIEN INDICATED

11) IT WAS LEARNED AS STATED THAT TWO WOMEN AND A BOY NEAR AUSTIN,TEXAS WERE
EXPOSED TO SEVERE RADIATION AT CLOSE RANGE AND THE SHIP WAS LAST SEEN GOING WEST
WITH HELICOPTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE THE EXPENSES.

12) SUBSEQUENT INSPECTION OF MOTION PICTURE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN DDURING THE STUFY
REVEALED THE US SHIP OR ONE LIKE IT FLYING WITH THE ALIENS.  THESE MATCH THE CIR
WHERE TWO CAN BE SEEN ON THE GROUND AND IN THE LATER PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON THE
GROUND AFTER THE BASE WAS ABANDONED.


---------------------------------------
           -------------------
THE COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND CONSTANT INTERACTION WITH THE ALIEN IN THIS
MANNER WITHOUT DIRECT ENCOUNTER HAS GIVEN A REASONABLY CLEAR PICTURE OF THE
ALIEN PSYCHOLOGY, THEIR LOGIC AND LOGIC METHODS AND THEIR PRIME INTENT.

IT IS IMPORTENT TO NOTE AT THE OUTSET DECEPTION, AND HAVE NO INTENT OF ANY
APPARENT PEACE MAKING PROCESS AND THEY ARRANGED AGREEMENET.

IN TRUTH THEY TEND TO LIE, HOWEVER THEIR MEMORY FOR LYING IS NOT LONG AND
DIRECT COMPARATIVE COMPUTER PRINTOUT ANALYSIS REVEALS THIS FACT.  THEREFORE,
MUCH 'DROPS THRU THE CRACK', AND FROM THIS COMES THE APPARENT TRUTH.

IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS REPORT TO CRITICIZE OR POINT FINGERS.OBVIOUSLY WITH
THE ALIENS WAS OPERATAING ON OUR BASIS OF LOGIC AND NOT THAT OF THE ALIENS AND
IN DOING SO APPARENTLY WALKED INNOCENETLY, IN TIME, INTO A TRAP.

THE ALIEN INDICATED THAT THE 'GREYS', AGREEMENT WITH THE US GOVERNMENT, WERE
STILL UPSET ABOUT THE INITIAL CAPTURE AND SUBSEQUENT DEATH OF THE FIRST EIGHT OF
THEIR CO-FELLOWS.

ANOTHER GROUP, CALLING THEMSELVES IN THE COMPUTER LANGUAGE, THE 'ORANGE'-
MT.ARCHELETA-DIRECTLY WEST OF THE SOUTH END OF THE US BASE AND NEAR NW OF THE
APPARENT MAIN LANDING AREA THEY CALL 'THE DIAMOND', PROBABLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT FROM A DISTANCE.  THE RIDGED SE PEAK OF MT.ARCHELETA HAS NO NAME; I
CALL IT SOUTH PEAK.  THE BASE EXTENDS NORTH OF THIS PAEK TO THE EDGE OF THE
CLIFF DOWN A ROAD PAST A LARGE ALLOY DOME 38' ACROSS ,WITH A 20' HOLE IN THE
TOP.

BASED UPON SOME OF THE AERIAL PHOTOS DURING WHICH THE ALIEN WAS CAUGHT IN THE
ACT OF LAUNCHING, I WOULD GUESS IT IS AN UNDERGROUND LAUNCH EGRESS FACILITY.  IN
THE NASA CIR THERE IS WHAT SIDE THE DOME , ON A RAMP.  IT IS THE SAME SIZE OF MY
79 LINCOLN TOWN CAR.

WHEELED VEHICLES AND WHAT APPEAR TO BE SNOW-CATS OR CATAPILLARS CAN BE SEEN
THROUGH THE CIR- CAR AND TRUCK TRACKS, TRUCKS AND JEEPS.  I DONT BELIEVE ALIENS
HAVE WHEELED VEHICLES - HUMANS DO.

NUMEROUS ROAD BLOCKS EXTEND NORTHWARD MAINTAINED ROAD SOME THIRTY FEET WIDE.
THERE ARE @ADS MARKED WITH 26' X'S [X stands for X, Z or Q] AND SERVICING
FACILITIES,TANKS,ETC.  THERE IS ALSO AN APPARENT FOUNDATION FOR ANOTHER HELO
PAD, HUMAN HOUSING, AND ANOTHER BLACK LIMOSINE WITH TRACKS LEADING TO IT WEST OF
THE ROAD.  IF I WERE TO MAKE A GUESS, I WOULD ESTIMATE THE APPARENT BLACK
LIMOSINES ARE CIA.  THIS IS BUT A LIMITED INVENTORY OF WHAT WAS THERE ON SEPT
8,1978, AND IS INCLUDED ONLY FOR INFORMATION.  THE TOTAL ALIEN BASING AREA
APPARENTLY CONTAINS SEVERAL CULTURES, (ALL UNDER THE DESIGNATION 'UNITY')AND IS
APPROX 3KM WIDE BY 8KM LONG AND IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE ON THE
JICARILLA INDIAN RESERVATION WEST OF DULCE,NM.  BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPS
PRESENTLY IN THIS AREA, THE TOTAL ALIEN POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO BE AT LEAST
2,000 AND MOST LIKELY MORE.  MORE ARE COMING OR ARE ON THE WAY.

REPORT HOW THE INITIAL CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE US.  THE ALIEN HAS COMMUNICATED
HIS ACCOUNT, AND IF TOTALLY TRUE IS NOT PALATABLE.

COMPUTER COMMUNICATION HAS ALLOWED A CONSTANT ACCOUNTING OF WHAT IS AND HAS BEEN
GOING ON AS WELL AS CONDITIONS WHAT 'MAKES THE ALIENS TICK'.  THIS IS VERY
VALUABLE DATA.


       ------- BETA REPORT --------
1) MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE ALIENS WILL ALLOW NO ONE ABDUCTED TO GO WITHOUT AN
IMPLANT.  AFTER INSERTION KNOWLEDGE OF IT IS WIPED OUT.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE
THAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE ALIENS CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT THE IMPLANT (WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE USE OF THE BINARY AND THE COMPUTER).  THIS WOULD INDICATE A
POSSIBLE IMMEDIATE THREAT OR DANGER FOR ANYONE.

THE REASONS FOR THE IMPLANT ARE FOR BOTH LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION BY THOUGHT
(THERE APPARENTLY IS NO LANGUAGE BARRIER WITH TELEPATHY) AND ALSO FOR COMPLETE
AND ABSOLUTE CONTROL BY THE ALIEN OF THE HUMAN BY PROGRAMMINGTHROUGH A BEAM OR
BY DIRECT CONTACT.

I HAVE TESTED THIS AND FOUND THAT DURING THIS PROGRAMMING THE PERSON IS TOTALLY
ALIEN.  IF THIS EVER HAPPENED TO THE MILITARY....  I NEED NOT GO INTO THE
POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.  THE VICTIMS 'SWITCH' CAN BE PULLED AT ANY TIME AND AT
THE SAME TIME THEY ARE 'WALKING CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES' IF THE ALIENS CHOOSE TO
LISTEN IN WITH ONE OF THEIR BEAMS.  NO CLASSIFIED AREA IN THE US IS INVIOLATE
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.THE LOCATED AND CAN BE VIEWED BY X-RAY.


2) ALL OF THE ALIENS- HUMAN AND HUMANOID - MUST HAVE IMPLANTS.  WITHOUT THEM NO
COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE.  ONE COULD SAY THAT IF A PERSON STATES THEY HAVE
COMMUNICATED BY THOUGHT WITH AN ALIEN, THEY PROBABLY HAVE RECEIVED AN IMPLANT.
THEY MAY ALSO CLAIM TO BE OVERLY PSYCHIC AND BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS.  THROUGH THE
LINK-IMPLANT, THE PERSON IS FED INFORMATION WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE ORIGIN.

3) THE ALIEN, EITHER THROUGH EVOLVEMENT OR BECAUSE THE HUMANOID IS
MADE/PRODUCED, WILL EXHIBIT TENDENCIES FOR BAD LOGIC (BAD BY EARTH LOGIC
STANDARDS) SO THEY ARE NOT INFALLIBLE.

IN FACT, THEY APPEAR TO HAVE MANY MORE FRAILTIES AND WEAKNESSES THAN THE NORMAL
HOMO SAPIEN.  TO THE ALIEN, THE MIND IS THE KEY, AND THEREIN LIES A GREAT
WEAKNESS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER.

4) THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

5) THE ALIENS UNDER DISCUSSION KILL WITH BEAM WEAPONS.  RESULTS ON A HUMAN WILL
BE A 3CM-4CM PURPLE CIRCLE.  THE RESULTS ON CATTLE ARE THE SAME, ESSENTIALLY
EXHIBITING PURPLE BENEATH THE HIDE, WITH BURNED CICRCLES ON THE OUTSIDE.

6) CATTLE MUTILATIONS - IT APPEARS THAT THE HUMANOIDS ARE FED BY A FORMULA MADE
FROM HUMAN OR CATTLE MATERIAL OR BOTH AND THEY ARE MADE FROM THE USE OF FEMALE
ENCOUNTER VICTIM'S OVUM.  THE RESULTANT EMBRYOS ARE REFERRED TO BY THE ALIEN AS
AN ORGAN.  TIME OF GESTATION APPEARS TO APPROXIMATE 1 YEAR.


THE ALIENS ARE PICKING UP AND 'CUTTING' (AS THE ALIENS CALL IT)MANY PEOPLE EVERY
NIGHT.  EACH IMPLANTED INDIVIDUAL IS APPARENTLY READY FOR THE OULL OF THEIR
'SWITCH'.  WHETHER ALL IMPLANTS ARE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE I CANNOT PREDICT, BUT
CONSERVATIVELY I WOULD ESTIMATE AT LEAST 300,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED IN
THE US AND AT LEAST 2 MILLION WORLDWIDE.


    ----- WEAPONRY AND INHERENT -----
               WEAKNESSES
          ---------------------

WEAPONRY IS OF THE KEYS AND IN THE ALIENS PRESENT STATE WE CAN PREPARE AN
EFFECTIVE OFFENSE.  ONE TENDS AT THE OUTSET (I DID) TO LOOK AT THEIR MACHINES
AND SAY THAT THERE IS NO DEFENSE OR OFFENSE.  ONE IS OVERWHELMED BY THEIR SPEED,
APPARENT CAPABILITY OF INVISIBILITY AND 'CLOAKING', AND OTHER COVERT
CAPABILITIES NOT DISCUSSED AT THIS TIME.  IN PARTICULAR, THE BEAM WEAPONS ARE
THEMSELVES A DIRECT THREAT AND ONE THAT


LET US LOOK AT JUST WHAT THIS WEAPON IS.  IT IS AN ELECTROSTATIC WEAPON WITH
PLASMA GENERATING VOLTAGES - AND AN INTERNAL STORAGE DEVICE- IT IS PULSE
POWERED.  THE BEAM, TOTALLY EFFECTIVE IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAN BE LOADED WITH
HYDROGEN OR OXYGEN.  THE MAXIMUM RANGE APPEARS TO BE ABOUT 2KM IF IT IS DRY
WEATHER.  IT IS CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING A LIMITED NUMBER OF FULL-POWER CHARGES-
CONTINUOUS BASIS, SO THEY MUST BE RECHARGED PERIODICALLY.  IF IT IS RAINING THE
WEAPON BECOMES INEFFECTIVE AND IS SWAMPED AND THUS DISCHARGED.

          ----- SHIP WEAPONS -----

ON THE DISKS AND SAUCERS, THE WEAPON CENTER AND HAS A MAXIMUM RANGE OF 200
METERS AT WHICH POINT IT WILL PLOW A TRENCH IN THE SOIL.  WHEN FIRED, IT FIRES
BOTH TO THE FRONT AND TO THE BACK MIN FLIGHT.

           ------ HAND WEAPONS -----
ESTIMATE BASED UPON VISIBLE DAMAGE OBSERVED:  HAND WEAPONS ARE DEADLY AT CLOSE
RANGE.  AT ONE METER, ESTIMATE OF 1600 DEGREES F OR HIGHER; IT CAN VAPORIZE
