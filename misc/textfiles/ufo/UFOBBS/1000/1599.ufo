                                   BACKGROUND

This case was assigned to the investigator by the State Director on May 1, 1989.
He learned of it from Dr. Dan Overlade in Pensacola, FL who was called by the
witness father. The witness father had gotten Dr. Overlade number from Budd
Hopkins. the witness, who we will call Roger R. age 10, wishes to remain
anonymous. His father was called on May the 3rd, and the initial interview was
conducted on May 6, 1989.

   Although the witness had a severe cough and their were distractions from his
younger brother, their was a considerable amount of information recorded on the
3 hours of tapes during the interview. Follow-up interview was held on May 7th
and on May 30 and 31 Donald Ware came to Orlando to assist in the investigation.

                                  THE INTERVIEW

The accounts that Roger R. mentions through out this story are sometimes not in
the actual sequence that it happen but in the order as he told his story. For
the purpose of clarity, when Roger mentions his father, he is referring to his
step father that he now lives with unless otherwise stated.

Roger went to bed on Saturday night at 11:00 PM, April 29, 1989 after watching
Star Trek on television. Sometime after Roger went to sleep (time unknown) he
heard sounds like voices, he woke up and saw 4 entities about 5' 6'' tall. They
(the entities) put Roger on a table like device that had no legs or supports.
The table was white, glass like and about 2' wide and 6' long, Roger said that a
person could not see through it.

The entities put Roger on the table and they floated him over to the bedroom
window and at that time  Roger told them that if they opened the window the
burglar alarm would go off (Radio Shack-battery powered with manually activated
switch).  Then they informed him that it would not go off, and when they took
out the screen and opened the window, the alarm was silent. The entities floated
the table, with  Roger on it, out the window and along the side of the apartment
to a small open field. They approached a craft that was shaped like two plates,
one inverted over the other.

                                  INTO A CRAFT

Roger saw a door, into a craft hinged at the bottom, that opened  up on the side
of the craft. The inside of the door was flat, had lights along the edge, and
served as a ramp to enter the craft. At that time Roger does not remember what
happen, but the next thing that he remembered he was in a room standing next to
a black glass table with buttons on it.

Roger said the entities had heart shaped heads with two giant black eyes, two
holes for a nose, a slit for a mouth and were gold in color. When they talk to
him it was through his head, and he talked in a normal voice. (when asked to use
Zipatone color codes for skin color, he chose 2525 for the males and 2517 (a
more brownish color) for the females)

One of the entities pushed a button on the table and the floor lit up. There was
a large screen in the room with a panel under it. On the panel there were
numerous buttons.  Roger said that one of the entities pushed a button and the
craft went straight up off the ground into the atmosphere, this he saw on the
screen. The screen, that Roger was watch ing, was about 6' long and 4' high.
Roger said that he felt no sensation of movement when the ship went up and he
saw no stars on the screen.

They asked Roger what he was and he replied that he was a  human and a boy. They
then asked him what his name was, and he answered  Roger. Then they told him
that they knew his parents.

They took Roger to another room and showed him a film of his friend Nancy in a
hospital. They said that they could not let him see all of the film, because
there were too many things in the hospital that caused interference on the
screen. He asked them where Nancy was, and they said that she was on another
ship and she will not be reborn because she had been born to many times. They
also told him that his mother is going to get a good job and make a lot of
money. They showed him the building that she will be working in, orange with
mirrors on the outside. They showed him the past, where a boy in a blue bedroom
that asked his mother if he could come out . She said, "Not till your father
comes home". One more thing that they showed Roger was a small girl going into
a ship, and they were studying her.

When the showing was over they took Roger into another room. At that time he
mentioned that a small red ball, about the size of a golf ball had been
following him. The ball-like object had a blue, red and yellow ring around it.
After entering the room, Roger said a small device that looked like a micro chip
floated over to him, and a small probe came out and took a sample from a  sore
spot that he had on his finger. After the sample was taken the skin sample was
sucked into the device. Then the chip like device floated over to a computer
type device and the results of the sample were checked.

Roger also mentioned that he had a number of sores before he entered the craft,
but after entering they disappeared. He says that they brought back the one sore
so they could take a sample.

They took him to another table where a man was sitting up. He was about 30 yrs
old with blond hair and a mustache. Roger did not talk to him. Then he was taken
over to another panel where they told him to push two buttons which he did.
Roger asked them why they wanted him to push the buttons. They said, "To take a
blood sample", and they knew that he was afraid of needles.

Next they went into another room, and he started to feel the ship shake. The
door that led to the outside of the ship opened up. Through this door Roger saw
the inside of another ship. They told him to get back on the platform that he
came in on, and he was floated out the door into a larger craft.

                               INTO A LARGER CRAFT

Roger said the ship was large, about the size of 4 apartment complexes like they
live in. They told Roger that the ship was too large to land on earth. The
inside of the ship was white. They removed his night clothes and gave him a red
suit that clung to him. He describes it as looking like the clothing used in
Star Trek. The suit had writing on it that he could not understand. He describes
the writing as a form of hieroglyphics. When Roger entered the larger craft, he
said that the small red ball that followed him through the smaller craft stayed
there. When he entered the larger craft another ball followed him through out
the craft. This ball looked just like the red one except it was blue in color.
Both balls hovered about 3" over his head and occasionally omitted a red beam
over his body. He mentioned that they were taking brain scans.

After Roger put on the clothes they took him into a room and told him that they
have the ability to make themselves any shape they wanted. But the bodies that
he now sees are their natural bodies. They also said they have been visiting his
brother often. (His brother is three years old)

They showed Roger a map on the wall. It was of America. He said that they
started going straight at a point on the map which he recognized as Alaska, and
they said that some of their people are there. The aliens then showed him a man
in Alaska that heard some noise, and when the man saw them he started to call
them the devil. The man took a gun and shot at them. They left because they
told Roger that they were peaceful people.

They also told Roger that they hid some books by Shirley McLaine from his Dad.
They said that the books were wrong, and she wrote them just for money. They
also opened the book Communion to page 112 and left it popped open on the
bookshelf.
 This they wanted his dad to read. They told Roger they had to leave because
they were afraid that his dad might catch them. The inside of his house and the
entity hiding the books was all projected on a screen in the craft. Note:
later his dad said the book incident happened a few weeks before and that he
accuse Roger of hiding and rearranging the books.

They left and went into another room that was square and had  buttons located on
the walls. This room also had a screen on which they showed Roger in bed at
home, and his father came into the room to check on him. They said that he can
be on the ship and be at home at the same time. They told Roger that this is
happening now.

The aliens took Roger into another room that he described as round or circular
shape. In the middle of the room there was an  object that looked like large
clear glass box with two buttons on the side. Roger said that it was as tall as
two people standing on top of each other, and that two fat people could get into
it. They opened the door to the box and had Roger step into it. Then closed the
door behind him. The entities went to a computer-like device and started to push
buttons on the computer. At that time a flat, square, red laser-type light went
down over his head to his shoulders and went back up. Later they told him that
they were taking a brain scan. They removed him from the box and brought him
over to the computer. Brought up on the screen a picture of Roger when he has
about two years old and living in a apartment in Texas. There was a red spot on
the wall that kept getting larger.

Roger went into another room that was all black. They asked him what he would
like to do. He told them he would like to go skiing, and they said that he will
be going skiing when he reaches the age of 13. At that time they projected a 3-D
picture in the middle of the room of him skiing down a slope when he is older.
Roger said that he could feel the cold when he was watching the picture. Then
they asked Roger where he would like to go, and he responded by saying, "I don't
know". They said that he might be moving to some place in the United States or
Germany.

Roger entered another room after they left the black room. Here he said the room
also had a screen on the wall, but this one was about twice as large as the
others. The room looked like a hospital room. It had tables and the ceiling was
like a solid light. On the screen they showed Roger the time he and his parents
almost got into a car accident on the way to Dayton a Beach. They said that they
turned the car instead of his dad turning the car to avoid the accident that was
about to happen. They also told him what his dad thought was an airplane he was
watching on the way home from Orlando was actually them. They then took a light
and shined it along side Roger's arm. Then they took a glass light bar,
described as looking like a fluorescent light bulb with multicolored lights and
told him to lay down on the table. They then passed the light over his body.

Roger was taken to a round room that he said was in the middle of the ship. It
took a long time to get to it. In the room there were some aliens that were
different. They looked like the others, but their skin appeared "orange"
(Zipatone #2517) rather then gold. Their eyes were blurry black, and they had
only three fingers. He asked about them and was told that they were women. Also,
in the room there was a very large alien that Roger said he only came up to the
middle of his thighs. He looked liked the others except he was wearing a robe
that had a hood. Around his neck and down to his knees hung a scarf type cloth
with writing on it. Another alien had blue clothes on like Roger was wearing and
was about his height. Roger mentioned this alien had muscular arms and looked
like he could throw somebody across the room with no problems. There was another
alien that was just a little smaller than the larger one but he was wearing a
black cape and a helmet. All three left the room while Roger was still there.
They asked Roger how his people produce, and Roger replied by asking them how
they produce. They replied that they can not answer that and repeated the
question to him. Roger answered, "from his mother". Roger also asked them how
they eat, and they said some what like he does but a lot less quantity.  They
told Roger that his younger brother will be repeating the first or second grade
in school. ( note: at this time, Roger said that some of these things that they
told him was asked in the smaller ship )

After they left that room, they went into another room that was rather large. It
had a lot of glass cages with animals in them.  The animals looked similar to
the animals that we have on this planet  (cheetah, snakes, birds, fish ) but
some were different. One looked like part tiger and part alligator. Another
looked like part lion and part bear.  Roger said that they just walked through
that room with out stopping. They told Roger that his teachers were not telling
him the truth in school, because at one time there were people living on Mars.
Then they told him about his grandfather in Germany . On the first planet he was
killed and then reborn on this planet. The first planet is not in this solar
system, and it was destroyed. It is now an asteroid belt.  The aliens treat this
planet better than the first planet, because our ancestors ( from the first
planet ) would kill anything or everything on the first planet. Before the first
planet was destroyed they brought some of the people to this planet. They also
said that they made this planet.

At that time, Roger said that they left the large ship and went back into the
smaller craft. They took him back home, but instead of taking him back through
the window, they took him through the front door and then him to his room. They
told him that they would be back to see him in a couple of weeks or months. ( he
wasn't sure).

After the interview with Roger I asked him if he could remember anything else
that the aliens told him. He said that he did but could not tell me because he
was afraid that he would get N.A.S.A. mad at him. I assured him that I would not
tell N.A.S.A. His father also told him that I don't work for the government and
its was okay to tell me.

This is what Roger had to say. When he was in one of the rooms in the large
ship, the aliens showed him on one of the screens a large room with men walking
around with blue coats. A patch was on the arm with the letters "N.A.S.A".,  The
men were also wearing a face mask that Roger described as looking like a
radiation mask. In the room there were 4 or 5  aliens, and the men in lab coats
were sticking needles into some aliens and telling them that it will not hurt.
But the aliens told Roger that they were dying. Roger noticed that the aliens
were turning a different color, between yellow a nd green.

As Roger was watching the screen (later he said that this was the worst part of
the trip) they showed the men chopping up the aliens (Rogers words) and using
them for experiments. They also told Roger about the men in black. Roger asked
them who they were and they said the men in black are N.A.S.A..

At this time in the interview, Roger felt uneasy and wanted reassurance that
N.A.S.A. would not find out about this because he didn't want to get into
trouble.

Roger continued on and said that when the aliens are on the planet surface
trying to help us, the men in black capture them, perform experiments on them
and don't seem to care if they kill them.

Roger also mentioned that the room that they showed on the screen had other
doors in it. One of the doors looked like it was made of steel and had a round
window in it, and the words HOT ???? (he did not know what the other word was).
They showed the men taking the aliens into the HOT room and then, after removing
them , they would cut them into pieces and run a test. Along with the HOT room
there was a COLD room and a room that was used for acid experiments.

The aliens told Roger, that when one of their people died they can make another
one but sometimes they would die inside also. I asked Roger to explain that, and
he said that he thinks they were taking about there soul. He said that the
aliens told him that when a person dies, sometimes they are reborn. And if they
are not reborn they stay with them, A person can be reborn a thousand times, and
they said they are the ones that made the people on this planet. They also told
Roger that there are some of their people living on this planet that look just
like he does.

A few other things that were mentioned during this part of the interview:

1. They said they did not know what is happening to the ships in the Bermuda
   Triangle.

2. They said the reason that his father is always tried is that they are trying
   to teach him and he is not listening to them, also his father forgets when
   they take him on board their ship. They said that the next time that they
   take his father he will remember everything.

3. They said the men in black won't be N.A.S.A. anymore, they would be history,
   and it's the big men in N.A.S.A. that are ordering the test on the aliens.
   The workers do not want to do this but are told that they would be fired if
   they don't do what they are told.

4. The morning after the apparent abduction, when Roger woke up, he looked out
   his bedroom window and notice that a black 4-door Ford was sitting on the
   other side of the parking lot in the grass. He got his binocular and saw a
   man in a suit with dark glasses on facing him . When the man noticed Roger he
   started his car and turned around in the grass and left in a hurry. As the
   car left, Roger said the license plate had "Government" written on it.

5. During that day and into the next day after the apparent abduction, Rogers
   father said that there were many government helicopters flying around and
   over his house. NOTE: Rogers father spent most of his life on government
   bases around the world. He says that he is familiar with government
   helicopters and aircraft.

6. Roger mentioned that on one of the viewing screens, they showed him a man in
   a suit jumping over a fence outside of his father room. This they showed in
   slow motion. Roger said that the man cut his leg on a nail that was sticking
   out and he was holding his leg as he jump into a car that was waiting for
   him. He mentioned that the car looked like the one that was outside his room
   the next morning.

About two weeks before, Rogers father notice a man looking into his bedroom
window, he rushed outside and observed a man jumping the fence along side the
apartment. The man landed in some shrubs, picked himself up, ran over to a car
that was waiting for him. What he said was unusual about this incident was the
man was wearing a suit.


Before the end of the interview with Roger he drew sketches of;

1. The aliens that took him from his room.
2. The small ball with a ring around it.
3. The micro chip-type device that took skin samples.
4. The first craft that he was in.
5. The second or larger craft.
6. The inside of one of the rooms that shows control panel and viewing screen wi
th picture of two aliens.
7. A picture of another alien, with clothing, that was aboard the large craft.

                                THE INVESTIGATION

After the interview with Roger, a search of the area that Roger said the craft
landed. The area showed no signs of physical traces. There were patches of dead
grass and dead branches laying on the ground but could not find any depressions
or other evidence that we could link with the sighting.

Rogers father mention that after the incident, he notice that Roger has become
better behaved and more affectionate now to both parents.

Roger step-father seems to be a person highly dedicated toward service to
others. When he read communion he recognize similar events in his own life and
read many resent UFO publications. A list of these publications that were in the
home is attached. Many of the controversial issues involved in Rogers testimony
are discussed in this publication.

Rogers mother mentioned that her father was a officer in the military and she re
members that he was visited by three men in black. She was also at the interview
and concurs with what Roger and her husband said.

It seems unreasonable to assume that Roger had read these books because of the
first week in June, Rogers CTVS test showed that he was in the bottom 8 % in
reading comprehension which is extremely low. His reading problem has been
recognized and has been tested. We will have a opportunity to retest him later.

In the following weeks, with Rogers direction, his father made more detail
drawings in color of:

1. The lay-out of the inside of the smaller craft.
2. A more detail drawing of the small red ball with ring.
3. A more detail drawing of micro-type chip.
4. Roger in his bedroom with alien.
5. A alien that was in his room.

On May 31, 1989 a inquiry of the local Police and Sheriff Dept. turned up no
reports of sightings within the period before and after the incident. A ad was
also placed in the local newspaper seeking UFO  witnesses in the past 6 weeks,
and as of this report no response has come from the local community. (a alias
was used with a local phone number of a friend to avoid a disclosure of our
interest).

Rogers father work associate was asked about his character and honesty and he
replied "Hard worker, reliable, decision maker and talkative".

Character check was made with a person that Roger works for (he delivers
newspapers) and she replied that" he is a normal 10 yr. old, quiet at times and
very nice".

                                   EVALUATION

At this early point in the investigation this case is considered an unknown of
great significance; because the 10-year-old boy apparently had no memory block
while on board two UFO's, and his father seems convinced he could not have made
it up. The father said they showed him things about the past that the boy could
not have known normally. This case involves many of the most controversial
issues in ufology.
