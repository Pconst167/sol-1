UFO SIGHTING DESCRIBED BY BATTLE MOUNTAIN

     Elaine  Goldman  would like someone to tell her what it  was
she  saw  on  her way home to  Battle  Mountain  Monday  evening.
Failing  that,  she would at least like to know that someone else
saw  what she,  her sister and her aunt observed in the skies  of
northeastern Nevada.
     The  three women were driving west on Interstate 80 at about
5 p.m.  Monday, Goldman said, and were about 28 miles from Battle
Mountain  when  they first sighted the  object.   "At  first,  it
looked like a star, but it was so light outside," Goldman said.
     As  they drew nearer to the object,  which Goldman said  sat
motionless  hundreds of feet above Interstate 80,  they began  to
realize that this was no star.
     "We were close enough to it to tell it wasn't an airplane or
a helicopter, either," Goldman said, "I get kind of nervous."
     She described the thing as "kind of like an oval" in  shape,
its  size difficult to pinpoint because of the distance involved,
and bathed in a red glow.   Two short streams of what appeared to
be  smoke  emanated from the center of the  oval,  Goldman  said,
adding  the  streams in no way resembled the contrails of  a  jet
aircraft.
     At  each  end of the oval was a flashing  red  light,  which
could  have  accounted for the glow,  the Battle  Mountain  woman
added.
     Goldman  said she and her relatives kept the object in sight
for  10-15 minutes before they passed directly beneath  it.   And
then  it  was gone.   "It just disappeared," she said.   "It  was
there and then it wasn't."
     The  object may have vanished,  but not Goldman's  curiosity
about what it could have been.   A check yesterday at the Federal
Aviation Administration office in Elko provided little assistance
-- the official on duty said there were no UFO sightings reported
there Monday.
     But  Goldman  says  she is hopeful that  someone  will  come
forward to corroborate her sighting.  "I'm sure somebody else had
to have seen it," the Battle Mountain woman said.
