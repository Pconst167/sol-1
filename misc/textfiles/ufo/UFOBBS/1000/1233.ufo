Pete, you've obviously missed the difference betweebn the Pyramids,
Stonehenge, and the like. What was required to build those structurew was
well within the capabilities of the societies that built them. Similarly, any
significance they had was evident both in the cultural records available (in
the caes of the Pyramids) or directly relevant to their survival (i.e., some
theories re Stonehenge's use as a calendar to determine agricultural cycles).

But in order to develop the Mandelbrot Set, as I'd said, doesn't just require
technological advancement: it requires a very substantial body of
mathematical work behind it. (The ancients were advanced in mathematics,
obviously, but I don't see any evidence that they were aware of such things
as the square root of negative 1.) Similarly, one would have to be willing to
expend considerable energies performing lengthy, repetitive calculations on
values incorporating the value i, _and_ plot them on a grid in the apropriate
manner.

We have a pretty good understanding of how the Egyptians built the Pyramids,
and what's more, we also have a very good understanding of _why_ they built
them. (And I must remind you that the idea of finding a Mandelbrot Set in
some ancient carvings was hypothetical to begin with-- which makes your
original point seem even more nonsensical. Just what were you objecting to?)

I rather suspect, Mary, that _all_ of us are driven in various degrees by
both ego and intellect.  Witness the frequent emotional outbursts (such as
yours, above...but by no means limited to the pro-psi side of the stadium)
on this newsgroup as an example.

A proof is a very personal thing, and what constitutes a proof to you
likely will fail as sufficient evidence to another.  E.g., this stuff on
crop circles.  You remain unconvinced that the mundane answer is true...or,
at least, so I seem to read in your postings.  You defend it on the basis
that the declamation of these two fellows doesn't _prove_ that _some_ of the
cc's weren't made by extraterrestials...which, of course, it doesn't.  How-
ever, absence of proof does not constitute disproof, neither does absence of
disproof constitute proof...for some people.

The arguments here make me think of children playing games.  With the rules
set, most will get along pretty well.  When the rules are somewhat nebulous,
or when various kids have different ideas of the rules, watch out!  The fur's
gonna fly!

We have here people programmed to various different sets of rules for "prov-
ing" the "reality" of various matters.  Mucho years ago, it was proven that
it is _impossible_ to trisect an angle, in the plane, using only the compass
and straightedge.  The proof is group-theoretic, requiring essentially grad-
uate-school standing in mathematics (in most curricula) to find oneself in
a class where such proofs are expounded.  Most people with less preparation
would be completely bewildered by the proof; it would be beyond their com-
prehension and they would be unimpressed by it.  The compass and straight-
edge, however, are simple to use, and methods of using them are taught in
every decent (note that qualifier ;^) high school in the country.  Consequen-
tly, many people can understand the nature of the problem of how to trisect
an angle.  Many try.  Many fail, and admit it.  A few, by way either of er-
ror or simple misunderstanding, arrive at what appears to be a trisection, and
then become very, very annoyed when math types won't take it seriously.

This last is where ego comes into it...perhaps from both sides.

I see no particular reason to believe in anything except mundane explanations
for crop circles, although I should point out explicitly that I've not inves-
tigated the matter.  Nor will I.

Why not?

Why am I unwilling to investigate this matter?  Ego?

One might call it that, but I perceive it differently.  I, like yourself and
everyone else, have only a certain amount of time and energy to do the things
I want to accomplish.  If I wished to make money gambling, I wouldn't play the
slots, neither would I bet two dollars to your one on a coin coming up heads
or tails.  "Gamblers believe in probability; suckers belive in luck."

If one investigates the various areas of pseudoscience, certain repeated pat-
terns emerge.  _All_ of the popular (personal opinion:) fuzzy-headednesses of
this day, including Ancient Astronauts (in the style of Von Daineken (sp?)),
Crystal Power, (ahem) Crop Circles, Channeling, and, yes, _every_ case of
parapsychological testing that I've been able to examine (twenty years back, I
was _very_ interested in this stuff) have displayed those characteristics.

(I should point out that _reproducibility_ was the most common problem here.
All these things fail to be reproducible...if watched too closely, or tested
in ways which are objectively verifiable.  Such was, and is, my experience.)

Certainly, this does not constitute _proof_ that these fields/phenomena are
baloney, but it does suggest that the probability is rather higher than other-
wise might be assumed.

In my undergraduate days, I invested a good deal of time reading about various
"paranormal" stuff, attempting various experiments in various fields of psi,
attended a number of lectures on such topics as "energy healing", dowsing,
"free energy", and a few et ceteras, took several courses purported to in-
crease psychic abilities, began studying aikido (trying to understand the
principles of "ki"), and...well, the list goes on.

I discovered an interesting mixture.  I also developed (EGO WARNING) a bet-
ter-than-average bullshit filter.  There were certain truths here...and cer-
tain untruths.  Many things simply were unverifiable.  Great claims were
made...and very little in the way of convincing (to me) demonstration was man-
ifested.

After a while, this stuff ceased to entertain me.  My interest lagged.  I was
not content to "know about" this stuff...I wanted to _do_ it.  I concluded
that there was nothing mystical about "ki" as used in martial arts.  Bluntly,
I started applying a set of "scientific" (read: objective) criteria to these
hobby studies, as well as my scholastic work.  I discovered that I could know
a lot about this, but I couldn't do any of it.  Neither could anyone else.

I found I had a good deal of "faith" (probability that this will work for me:
pretty high) in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, aikijutsu, etc.  My
"faith" (probability that will work for me: pretty low) in parastuff faded
away.  I was no longer impressed, for a number of reasons, by the "catch-22"
that you have to believe in paranormal phenomena for them to manifest.

Why?  Because I couldn't separate the real from the unreal, whether that lat-
ter be a fraud, or simply my perception.  You see, another of my hobbies is
magic, with an emphasis on mentalism.  I bamboozle people as a hobby.  I
_know_ how easy it is (and how much fun it is) to be fooled.

I've never encountered a "believer" in parapsi who wouldn't admit that there
were frauds out there, and most would point to entire areas which they regar-
ded as fallacious.

At this point, I can't resist quoting Martin Gardner.  He wrote a book called
_Fads_and_Fallacies_ (In the Name of Science), and this paragraph he wrote as
the beginning of the preface to the second edition:

	The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters
	from irate readers.  The most violent letters came from Reichians,
	furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to
	them) outlandish cults as dianetics.  Dianeticians, of course, felt
	the same about orgonomy.  I heard from homeopaths who were insulted
	to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and
	chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky "pitied" me because
	I had turned my spine on God's greatest gift to suffering humanity.
	Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed
	that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles.
	Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter
	only, thinking all the others excellent.



Until a good filter is devised which will separate fraud from fair in these
matters, skeptical persons will not be convinced.

For myself, I admit the _possibility_ of almost any of these strange things.
That doesn't mean I _believe_ in them, and THAT doesn't mean I _disbelieve_
in them.  I remain simply unconvinced.  There's a difference, although many
won't accept that.

It's been said many times before, and I'll repeat it:  "Extraordinary matters
require extraordinary proof."  There's a problem there...it's simply not true.
"Extraordinary matters" of the sort we're describing don't require extraordin-
ary proofs at all;  they require only very ordinary, everyday proofs of the
sort we use to demonstrate the existence of, say, magnetism, solid objects, or
communication by verbal interchange.  The trouble is, these simple, straight-
forward proof don't seem to be there.

"Ordinary proof" shouldn't be particularly hard to come by..._if_ the pheno-
mena under consideration are real.  If they're not...if they're not, then they
should behave exactly as they seem to under serious and detailed examination.
I.e., they fail to manifest.

Yes, I'll grant the possibility of "shyness effects", "skeptic neutralizing",
or whatever the current buzzword is for "real" psi phenomena failing when ex-
amined by a skeptic.  I'll grant the possibility, but not the reality.  I find
it...let's just say...less than convincing.  It removes our only mechanism for
differentiating the genuine from the phoney.  And there are _always_ phoneys.
Even in the "hard" sciences, there are phoneys.  They embarrass their col-
legues.  There are mechanisms in place (and, to be certain, they don't always
work) to reduce this sort of thing, but still, some always seem to get through.


Now, let's land on that question:  WHY won't I examine, fairly and in detail,
the evidence for/against E.T. causes of crap, excuse me, crop circles?

Because it manifests so many of the characteristics of crackpot foolishness.
_Many_ things manifest those characteristics, and why should I choose cc's
over, say, Bigfoot or the Marfa Lights?

It seems likely to me that _all_ of these fields of endeavor have very, very
small probabilities of turning out to be anything other than the proverbial
wild goose chase.  There might be, among them, one or two which hide some
mighty, world-shaking matter, and would be well worth the pursuit.  But which
one?  Why should I choose cc's over Bigfoot or the Marfa Lights?

At least, the Marfa Lights allegedly manifest a single (long) day's drive from
Albuquerque.  I might be able to do some real investigations there.  But,
again, time and money...and always energy.  Note that's just to investigate
_one_ of these mysteries, and the nearest one that I mentioned, at that.  I
cannot practically investigate _all_ of these in any useful manner, even if
I could afford it.  As for just one...no, I'll not play the slot machines.
Neither will I bet two-to-one on the side of the coin that comes up next.
Neither will I invest my time in studying the Marfa Lights.  Or Bigfoot.  Or
crop circles.  If it pleases you to do so, then have at it, with my blessings.
I'll stick with aikijutsu, cave exploring, conjuring, and other "mundane"
matters.

I'll bet I come out ahead, too.



>None are so blind are those who WILL NOT see.

Nice rhetoric.  Here's the response:

   "Those who believe illusion, and accept as truth their own vain imaginings,
		perceive less that those entirely bereft of eyes."

Pretty snappy, huh?  I just coined it myself.  And, like your statement above,
it establishes nothing useful.

Like the pro/anti firearm matter bouncing across this group, the argument lies
with ideology.  Most discussions quickly degenerate into name calling, on
_both_ sides, establishing that ego indeed is an active principle.  There is
intellect, too, which is why I haven't long since unsubscribed to this group.

Well, the halftime show's over, and the band (that's I) is returning to the
bleachers to watch the rest of the game.

Here come the teams; I'm outta here....

They're hard evidence that crop symbols exist.  By what incredibly unfathomable
process did you come to the conclusion that they're hard evidence of PSI and
not of somebody dragging a board around a field?

The 'prime directive' is not advanced ethics, it's a blatant sci-fi plot
restriction ploy.  It's an unsubtle way of restricting the actions of
the advanced high-tech characters so that low-tech environments can
still be hazardous and uncertain.  As a practical matter, there would be
no way for it to work as it does fictionally: how do you land on a
planet and just "blend in" with the culture there when you're an oxygen
breathing, water drinking, carbon-based life form and they're monoxide
breathing, ammonia drinking, silicone-based life forms (with, in
addition, a considerably different appearance from yours)?

   The old men demonstrated how they used a board (about the size and shape
of a yardstick) with a single rope that is tied to both ends, looking
something like this:

      ____
     /    \
    (      )   <---ROPE
    ========   <---BOARD

 They would simply hold the rope in their hand and then walk with the board
under their foot. This quickly squashed large areas of crop. That's good
enough for me, but I still have two questions: What about the crops being
bent but not broke? Can this be done via this method? And, what about the
large areas were no circles were found the night before? Is this method fast
enough to produce large circles?

Yes and yes.  The news report I heard today went further into detail.
They bent the crops instead of breaking them so that the farmer would
still be able to harvest the crops.  So it wasn't destruction of
property.  And yes, apparently with their method you can make the
circle quite big.   Obviously, there's a limit, I don't know what it
is, but they had plenty of time to do it.

Of course not.  They will complain that because *NOT ALL* of the circles
have been proven to be hoaxes, they obviously *MUST* be heralding the

Why that's fine and dandy..but how do you explain and account for all
the circles that have been created in the UK for the last couple of
hundred years? (yes it has gone on that long)..and while you're
working up a "pat" answer for that..how about giving us the benefit
of you accumulated wisdom on explaining all the various crop circles
in other parts of the world.

Before you enjoy your (premature) gloating..best do your homework first.

A number of these circles are created each night..how do you explain the
method that the 2 old geezers use to span the whole of the UK to do _that_.

*plus* leap over to this continent and make circles in Canada and all over
the US.

Please explain to me what the "object" is in plate 50, page 92 of "Circular
Evidence" is to me. It sure *don't* look like 2 old guys with a "board".

Some of these "objects" have been videotaped buzzing over the newly created
circle. In fact, this tape was shown at the MUFON conference at Chicago,
complete with helicopters hovering *over* the object, watching it do it's
"thing".

I have absolutely no doubt that these 2 *could* hoax a credible looking
circle, however to lump the _whole phenomenon_ in with these 2 bozos
and claim that they hoaxed all the circles in the UK is in error.

Here's a simple enough test..the next few that are created in the UK..let's
see if fric and frac are anywhere near..no? they were in a pub the night
that an elaborate one is created? Tsk Tsk...

No doubt that some people are ingenious enough to hoax a circle..but
let's examine closely what _kind_ of circle they do produce and what
the evidence says by looking at all of it..do they press and swirl
the crop with the board and is it uniform with - no - breakage..no
damage,etc.

Sorry, but I just don't buy the explanation that's been given thus
far in all of this thread. Flimsy, verrryy flimsy.A Joke :-)

You're almost certainly correct on that score, the hoax explaination accounts
for both the very complex shapes and the concentration of the circles
in England.  Another problem with the plasma ball hypothesis is that it
didn't explain why so many circles were in southern England.

I'm a bit puzzled, though, about the non-English circles.  We are somewhat
at the mercy of the qualilty, or the lack thereof, of the reports on
non-English circles.  Did they all have the bent-but-not-broken effect?
If so, how come everybody who guesses the secret immediately goes and and
hoaxes a circle himself instead of announcing his discovery?  Its interesting
that some people, Randi comes to mind, came close to the truth without
hitting on the board trick.

I regard that it is possible (OK, slightly possible - OK, *very* slightly
possible) that a few of the simplest circles might have a natural origin.
After all, even the English hoaxers (BTW, great timing for the _The Economist_
article, huh?) were inspired by earlier incidents.  Not that that really
proves anything, of course.

This plasma ball/ball lightning stuff sounds pretty cool, although we still
need an explaination on how these things could be created naturally.

If I remember correctly, there is somewhat of a tradition of elegant hoaxes
in England. These gentlemen were continuing in that tradition.

There may also be natural crop circles. A fellow here at the office used to
be a wheat farmer in Kansas. He said that he occasionally would find circles
of downed wheat in his fields. He never thought much of it, since it seemed
to be a natural phenomenon. These observations were in the 50's and 60's in
Kansas.

What I love about believers in the paranormal is that when you slap
them in the face with PROOF that their belief is unfounded, they just
ignore it.  If Uri Gellar were to admit publically that he is a fraud,
I bet that there are several readers here who would claim:
-He is lying
-He actually uses PSI without knowing it.

WAKE UP PEOPLE.  They admitted that the crop circles were a hoax.
They have shown quite convincingly that they are easy to produce.
This is overwhelming evidence.  They is ABSOLUTELY NO evidence to
indicate that they were created otherwise.

  It's been a while since I looked at this, but a study by Glick and Snyder
(_The Humanist_, vol 46 pp. 20-25 (1986) showed that people skeptical of
astrology (I think) when shown data that supported astrology tended become
more receptive to the hypothesis. On the other hand, believers of astrology
when presented with evidence against astrology, did NOT change their
position. Hmmm.....

I find it amusing and disappointing that the new standard of skeptics proof
is a tabloid. Wow! Sounds more like desperation than proof. Maybe it is
possible that two 60 year old men could make over 500 cc in Europe in one
season. Now here is where I would say spacecraft were involved carrying
the men around. But that leaves the fact that the sound above and below
human hearing has been detected and presented.  So now skeptics run out
and buy some more tabliods to explain how dragging a board leaves a circle
with measurable sounds in it.  Skeptics are a hoax! Tabloids are real.

    It's worse than that.  A channeller was shown to be a fraud, and the
followers said "He's a fraud now, but before it was real". sigh.

No.  It isn't event close to "overwhelming".  It _is_ evidence that
these guys are capable of mashing a bunch of plants to make a poor excuse
of a duplicate of the patterns we've been seeing.

The bottom line?  I'm skeptical not only of the claims of those that the
circles are from aliens or from a "plasma vortex", but also of the claims
from ANYONE that they are solely responsible for the patterns created
for the last decade.

Until these guys can show, on demand, that they can just as _accurately_
reproduce one of the _complex_ patterns, I shall remain a skeptic,
believing only that no explanation has yet been found.

	There was an article in Fortean Times recently which described apparent
crop circles appearing well before these two hoaxers were born. On the positive side,
revelation of the hoax will allow investigators to determine characteristics of this
type of hoax. However the circles that have appeared in Asia, Canada, and America
could just be explained by copy cat hoaxes (although this seems less likely in Asia)

	I'm just keeping an open mind and listening to what goes on right now.
I can't make a final judgment without putting in a lot of work.

Nor does it explain how (as reported on this morning's BBC Radio 4 -

 These men may well not have been the fakers of ALL the crop circles
worldwide, or even of all the ones they claim, but the fact that they managed
to prepare a crop circle that fooled an expert does prove that fraud is a quite
reasonable explanation of the phenomenon.

It is clearly too soon for skeptics to conclude that the story is over. Anyone

are hoaxes is making the same sort of illogical leap made by the proponents
of so much UFO/PSI/Conspiracy/??? nonsense. However, it would not surprise
me at all to find:
  (1) all elaborate crop "circles" are hoaxes. I have not heard of ANY
      non-circular ones before crop circles became a tabloid phenomenon.
  (2) many simple crop circles are natural (I know someone who saw them
      over 20 years ago in Kansas).

The story is reported in today's _Guardian_ (10/9/91). The _Guardian_ report,
by the way, describes Bower & Chorley as "the Wessex Skeptics, from
Southampton University," which appears to be an actual Skeptics society, since
later the report mentions: "Robin Allan, spokesman for the Wessex Skeptics,
said their circle was made by hand last month in two hours with a garden
roller." (This doesn't seem consistent with the _Today_ report as to how the
circles were made - and certainly doesn't suggest that the stalks would be
unbroken) However, "Experts judged [the circle] a textbook example, and 100
per cent genuine. Dowsers reported strong reactions, and a medium was carried
away complaining of nausea."

"Martin Pitt, the farmer who lent his land to the TV company [before whose
cameras a circle was created], was less certain that the hoax admission has
ended more than a decade of speculation. 'We only set out to prove a circle
could be man-made and the experts couldn'tc really tell one way or the other,
But it does no prove that there are not genuine ones as well,' he said."

"Four days later, another circle appeared on Mr Pitt's land without his
permission or knowledge."

A Mr Colin Andrews, director of field operations at the Centre for Crop Circle
Studies, said of the Wessex Skeptics's circle "Straight away we can see
everything we would expect to see in a hoax. The plants are broken, it is
extremely ragged and obviously a hoax. There is nothing here to impress us
except two very fit 60-year-olds."

"[Mr Andrews] calculated that of 300-plus circles that have appeared this
year, about 70 were hoaxes - but that did not explain how 20 circles a night,
at the season's peak, were appearing.

"Mr [Patrick] Delgado said the confession of the two hoaxers did not explain
what had been happening worldwide.

"'Yesterday there were circles found on a prairie in Canada. Have these two
guys been there with their board?'"

According to the _Guardian_, the TV report will be shown on Channel 4 (UK) as
part of the _Equinox_ series - next month.

All the best,

Roy

It is your opinion that the crop symbols are hard evidence.  Lots of data
have been presented as hard evidence.  How the crop circles qualify as hard
evidence is something that you had better make a case for.  There are
a lot of arguments about "cannot be done by current technology, can't reach
them from the ground, etc.".  All of which is not true for every circle.  If
you have a group of circles that defy all current explanations, get the

A simple circle.  As long as James Randi is standing in the center of
it.  Just having the symbol show up somewhere and unobserved is an
invitation to fraud.

  After reading through the thread on crop circles, a
couple of questions :

Question 1:
  There is no parallel discussion of similar supposedly
alien visitations to livestock raising concerns. Presumably
the same space aliens are responsible for both. If so why
do they leave impressions in the soil and kill livestock in
one case, while only flattening plants in the second.

Question 2:
  If these circles are some kind of natural phenomenon,
then where are the reports of similar circles found
on moors, swamps, marshes, tundra, snow, parking lots, etc.

If there are not numerous "non-crop" circles, then natural
phenomenon seems to be ruled out.

If space aliens are to blame then there must be more than 1
kind of alien visitation device or species, or whatever.

Yes, but it's probably grounds for expulsion on many university
campuses - it's not politically correct, you know, to use the word
`black' in a phrase which implies that it's a derogatory term.

    Which gives rise to the urban legend (may or may not be true) about
a financial report that was run through a grammar checker that also made
political-correctness corrections; the phrase "in the black" was changed
to "in the afro-american".

If the crop circles are real, why don't we see them in the snow.
Snow would be the perfect medium for circles...

My guess is, because you can't hide footprints in the snow...
But I bet if we talk about enough we will see them this winter :-)

Hmmmm...  You just don't get it.  The hyperdrives of the aliens don't work

Of course, if we talk enough about it we will see some this winter.  The
Aliens read this newsgroup, and at this VERY moment, are working feverishly
on a winter-hyperdrive.

Sheesh, you guys are sooooo out of it.  EVERYONE knows that the hyperdrives
don't sieze up in cold air because they manage to go through outer space
where it is really cold just fine (and anyone who wishes to point out that
outer space isn't cold, it just makes anything in it cold can go away.  Dont
confuse me with reality).  The real reason is that the aliens attach religious
significance to the color white and refuse to desecrate it in any way.  Which
brings up the following experiment: Get 300 fraternity guys to hold a party
in the snow.  They will piss all over it and turn it yellow.  THEN the aliens
will be able to create circles in it.  See how simple science is when you
approach it in a rational manner?

Why not redirect this to sci.sceptic.stupid?

My guess would be -- because they would be called ``snow circles''
instead. ;-)

Or maybe the weather (snowing, cold, wind, and all that) might alter
whatever conditions might be required for their formation.

    A poor excuse of a duplicate of the patterns we've been seeing?  Is that
why "Corn circle expert Patrick Delgado [author of 'Circular Evidence' and
'The Latest Evidence'] admitted last night 'We have all been conned.
Thousands of lives are going to be wrecked over this'." ?  Your comments
are wishful thinking unless you can prove they're different.  The experts
who have seen both types say they're the same - where's *your* evidence?

    They did just that, showing how they made straight lines by using
primitive (but effective) surveying tools.  Also, they didn't claim they'd
made all of them, just a lot of them.

As my original posting stated, the British crop-circle creators claim
to have been making circles for thirteen years (13). They started off
by copying Australian circles that farmers over there created (thus
demonstrating the way in which the phenomenon spread from country to
country), but started developing more complex patterns later on. They
made very complex patterns, drawing them out on paper first.

What high E-fields in the centres?   In fact, I'm not sure what your
second paragraph is saying at all. Would you care to clarify?

>       This was just on an NBC News-minute thingie. I still am not convinced.

...of what?  I'm glad to hear that you are not prepared to believe
everything you hear, but I'd say that the article in Today (and the
one mentioned by another poster in "Science et Vie") seem to provide a
quantity of evidence for the hypothesis that crop circles (or at least
the complex patterns) are a hoax.

There may be other reasons for the appearence of crop circles. Some
might be created by space aliens from the planet Tharg, a few by
plasma and some more by a mystery weapon developed by the CIA and kept
secret as part of the well known worldwide conspiracy. However, I
think Occam's razor should be applied at this point.

What I am surprised not to yet have seen is a claim that the
perpetrators were actually channelers (unconciously, of course) for
someone or other :-)  No doubt such a claim will appear here soon.
Without a shred of evidence of any kind, of course. :-(

_Most_ interesting. I remember seeing such things in the Oz newspapers
some time ago. However, I seem to remember it was during the ***60's***
that the so-called `saucer nests' in Queensland were reported.
(But now that I think about it -- I _think_ there was something
of the same kind reported in or about Adelaide, SA).

Still strange that this could be kept a (relatively) good secret
for so long...

I find it hard to believe 20 crop circles appeared in one night. Please
list the locations, dates and discoverers.

Or maybe this is an attempt at misdirection?

I have a hard time believing this for a few reasons...

1) I find it hard to believe that two men in their 60's would be capable
of (or would even want to for that matter) finding the time to make hundreds
or thousands of corn field designs. (Not much of a social life that these
guys have, huh?)

2) Even if they could produce that many designs, I find it hard to belief
no one has caught them in the act.

3) This still doesn't explain the mysterious high pitched noise when you
take a microphone just inside of the crop circles and how the sound
disapears immediately after you step outside of the circle.

Yes, I guess I have.

During the early part of this century various people tried to pass
off all sorts of stuff as dinosaur remains.  Kinda got in the way
of serious research.

Just that good ol' human lust for notoriety, I guess.

This whole crop circle thing is fairly new to me but one has to
wonder, if it was so hard for two men to do the hoax unobserved, why
is it so easy for aliens to create the circles unobserved.

One could argue that the men would take much longer to create such
circles and therefore have more opportunity to be observed. On the
otherhand, one could argue that alien spacecraft ought to be easier to
spot and more noticeable than two hum-drum earthlings.

Well, this may be rather naive of me, but if these two guys have confessed to
being the culprits, and assuming that they aren't going to do it anymore, I'd
think that there number of crop circle incidents in the area would take a
nosedive...granted, others might attempt to 'take over the mantle', as it
were, but I kinda get the idea these jokers were fanatics.

   Many of the "skeptics" on this SIG are too quick to debunk crop circles.
There are several questions that still need to be met.

1- Is this method fast enough to create crop circles over night? If so, how
many people will it take to produce some of the "unhoaxed" circles?
[Above should read- how many people will it take to produce one of these
"unhoaxed" circles in one night?]

2- Has the "bending but not breaking" effect been proven to exist in crop
circles? If so, is the method able to produce such an effect?

3- Based on the amount of people needed to produce your average size crop
circle, how many people would it take to produce the amount of circles made
in one month or year?

4- Are there any other characteristics of crop circles that this method is
unable to produce? If so, are there any other known methods which can?

 If your simply going to reach a conclusion without putting the "solution" to
a few tests then your no longer a skeptic...

    Depends on the size of the circle, but based on some of my
experiments (based on the reports) I could make a 40' circle in about an
hour.  I've also designed a widget that would let me fold down the crops
as fast as I could walk.


>2- Has the "bending but not breaking" effect been proven to exist in crop

    Just depends on hjow much weight is applied and how high up on the plant.

    ("number", "not amount").  I suspect I could do three of four a night
without sweating.


>4- Are there any other characteristics of crop circles that this method is
>unable to produce? If so, are there any other known methods which can?

    Well, it was apparently announced as genuine by a "crop-circle
expert".  What characteristics do the mysterious crop circles have?

   Just a small observation...If you are a "skeptic", shouldn't you be a bit
skeptical about a board and a rope being the answer to a mystery that has
been on a good many "experts" minds? I only ask that we submit this "answer"
to the same thought process that made some of us skeptics in the fist place.

The important thing is not that we have two people who have been doing
this... they obviously could not have done them all.  The important
thing is that we have shown that there is a perfectly normal
explaination for crop circles.  The claims we've had are that such
things are too round, symetrical, too big, etc. to be made by humans,
and that the crop circle experts would be able to tell if it was made
by humans.

To which this proves:  Bullshit!   The crop circle experts are just as
easily hoaxed as the next person.  People can make the crop circles
attributed to aliens.  There is no need to involve a mysterious
unknown outside source to account for them.

wouldnt it be cool if Frank Bartyles and Ed James made a commercial
for their most excellent wine coolers, and in it they were making a
crop circle? Just a silly thought. :-)

That is about as much credibility as I give to Dave and Doug. All you
skeptics ACCEPTED their story TOO EASILY. Until I've done a circle
myself, I believe no one. Nuff said.

Douglas Bower and David Chorley, both in their 60s.

Yes, the story appeared in "Today" on 9 Sept, with a followup article
today (10th).  The equipment they claim to have used was a piece of
wood 4ft long with rope reins.  You hold the reins and put one foot on
the stick and push down on the corn.

They claim to have started making the circles in the summer of
1978.

I'll try to describe the demonstration "circle" that they made for the
paper:  Two large filled circles with a (8ft wide) line joining them.
The connecting line forms the diameter of two concentric rings.  From
the smaller filled circle there are two "antennae" (a line jutting out
of the circle with a small circle on the end) From the other circle
there is a "ladder" and there is a semi-circlular ring with the ladder
as its diagonal (roughly).

The 'expert' was Pat Delgado (author of "Circular Evidence") who is reported
as saying: "In no way could this have been a hoax".

>So, who is hoaxing who?  Are these two hoaxing the Circle students, or
>is the report that that they are, itself a hoax. :-)

>I attach NO value judgement to this report.

There were few details in the report so it is difficult to judge the
claims.  I may followup with some opinions when I have the time.

Again, the two guys are *proof* of nothing, except that the circles
are easily hoaxed and that the self-appointed "experts" are fools.
This makes the hoax hypothesis much more plausible than some
unspecified bullshit about UFO's.

If anyone said (which I doubt) that all crop circles were made by these
two, or there is *proof* that they are all hoaxes, then they spoke
incorrectly

It is reasonable to believe that Bower and Chorley hoaxed some or most
of the complex 'pictogram' designs.  However others in the past have
hoaxed some circles and then claimed in addition to be responsible for
starting it all off -- just continuing the hoax really. Therefore we
need to apply caution and check whether the story they give makes
sense.

Given only the information in "Today" I am not at all convinced.  Most
of the problems with the story listed below are a lack of detail which
prevent any definite conclusions from being drawn either way, but there
are several suspicious elements as well.

-- They claim to have been the ones to have started the circles in England
   in 1978.  However there were reports of circles before that time in
   local newspapers.  In particular there were several in 1977.  It is
   difficult to tell whether the historical reports refer to the same
   phenomenon due to the lack of the important details in the reports.
   However people have been finding circles that they can't explain for
   much longer than 13 years.

-- They claim that no one noticed the circles for three years.  They say
   that the first mention of the circles that they saw in the local
   papers was the 1981 event that Delgado first publicised.  Would they
   have missed the local coverage given to a circle appearing the
   previous year, when they were so eagerly awaiting for someone to
   discover them?
   The 1980 circle appeared in the newspaper, was investigated by a local
   ufo group (who said it appeared that it was caused by downward air-pressure
   or similar), and had been investigated by meteorologist Terence Meaden.
   So the circles were well known before the hoaxers realised that they
   had been discovered.

-- (I have not personally checked this yet)  Delgado was apparently
   not aware of the 1980 circle, when he wrote his best selling book,
   although it appears (with photograph) in other less well known later
   books.

-- No demonstration of making circles without walking down the tramlines
   was given.

-- The reliance of "Today" on Delgado as the foremost 'expert'.  I would
   have thought that a proponent of the meteorological explanation
   would have taken one look at the silly design and said that it was
   someone taking the piss.  Of course, had that happened, there
   would have been no story.

-- There were no details about whether the circles had the layering
   and banding effects that are features of 'real' circles.

-- They claim to have made ~ 200 circles since 1978.  "Today" made some
   comment about these including the very ones that Delgado had found to
   be the most unexplicable(?).
   Meaden has collected reports of about 800+ circles.
   That seems like a lot of copycat hoaxing going on, especially as there
   would be no reason to think that all their claimed hoaxes were discovered.
   There was no indication of whether the hoaxers records included impressive
   circles that had not been discovered.

   Perhaps those are:

The more posts I read by believers, the more certain I become that
they lack certain mental facilities.  This crop circle thing is a good
example.  Several posters have said (paraphrased) "How can two old men
make all of these circles?"

THIS IS NOT THE ISSUE!

The point is this, these guys showed a technique they claim to have
been using for many years to create these circles.  Now, does anyone
honestly think that they are the only two people on the entire Earth
who are capable of concocting this scheme?  Has noone else ever heard
of copy-cats?

The point is that a repeatable explination for these circles has been
provided and demonstrated.  This explination should be accepted as the
methodology behind the creation of all crop circles until another
repeatable, demonstratable explination is put forth.

No, we don't know that -- not in the scientific sense.  We know that
two men made something, that the "something" was said to be authentic
by Delgado, and that the men claimed to have made others.

How authentic was the something?

I don't know. How many crop circles are there?  What is the average
size? Why do the appear in southern England but not here in Wales?
How many aliens (or whatever) would it take to produce them?  If so
many, how come we don't seem to have seen any yet?  Obviously any
decent explanation must account for the number of circles that are
observed.

What characteristics?  The method demonstrated by the British hoaxers
fooled one of the "experts". Of course, the expert may have been a
pretty poor expert.  If there is some clear way of distinguishing hoax
circles from some "other" kind of circle, then that would be
interesting. Of course, it presupposes that there is an "other" kind
of circle.

The evidence supporting the hypothesis (and it is only a hypothesis)
that the circles (at least the complex patterns) are produced by
hoaxers seems stronger than the evidence for any other explanation. If
you can come up with a better explanation, then I am sure we would all
like to hear it.

have put up a hoax because they just can't accept any other
explanation? NOT that I believe, or ever did believe, that
the circles were evidence of anything.

Is the media prejudiced?  C'mon guys, If the money for miracles guys, the
real-estate riches guys, the government auction guys, the astrologers, and
the hot air chicks can buy air time, so can organized UFO research..

My wish-list : a syndicated special, pref at least 2 hours long.

Enough SOLID evidence to make a skeptic say "UFOs are around!"

How about that guy with all the CLEAR and (supposedly) irrefutable photo-
graphic evidence showing his stuff.

A brief history on hoaxes.

A history of classic incidents, Roswell, etc...  WITH DOCUMENTATION, there
has been talk about government papers being de-classified.

NO BULLSHIT, nothing like the bogus movies/shows of the past, Prove they are
here NOW, nowbody wants to hear about the Nasca lines again, how aliens built
the pyramids, etc...

If solid evidence is presented, and you are able to prove it, then you will
have your hands full with people coming out of the closets with sightings.
If you do not describe any aliens at all within the show(s), these people
coming outta the closet will either confirm or refute the stories about
Grays, if you describe a blue, fat, tall alien, people will start seeing them.
I believe that some of the reports may be true, but most ARE crackpots and
loonies, better yet, let this work for you, describe an outlandish alien and
you can seperate the crackpots this way after the show is over and they start
crawling outta the woodwork reporting aliens.

If the evidence cannot be presented in one show, make a mini-series out of it.

First, will the stations run it?  Yes, if they run Robert Tilton, if they
run "The Elvis Files" (a show some weeks ago that tried unsuccessfully to
prove Elvis is alive), then they will run this..

Second, will the advertisers pay?  Have you seen the ratings of "The Elvis
Files"?

Third, will the viewers believe?  That depends on the evidence.  Make it good
because the people who count will be hard to convince.

I would like to see this from professionals in the field, not some
pseudo-scientific presentation.  Sources MUST be credible.  Radar traces
not FAA certified (and advertized as such) can be created by any hardware
hacker in his/her garage using industrial/government surplus sources.

I know someone who brought this idea up one night when reading this newsgroup.
He would be willing to be an organizer for such a film, financial backing
must come from within the UFO research community.  If you expect another
"Chariots of the Gods", then go elsewhere.  We are interested in REAL evidence.

Any takers?

Most of the crop circle discussions lately have devolved into
the argument that these 60 year-old gents couldn't have done
all of them, and we can't account for all of them.  Ignoring the
fact that my gradnfather, when sixty, worked 14-16 hour days and
could lift a 500 lb calf to move it, examine the following line of
reasoning:

Assertion:  All rockets launched in the USA are launched by aliens.

Response:  But NASA launches rockets in the USA.

A:  Does NASA launch ALL the rockets in the USA?  What about before
    it existed?

R:  Gee, I don't know who launched rockets before NASA, or who else
    launches them now, but I am SURE that it is just people, like NASA.

A:  But you CAN'T be sure, until YOU PERSONALLY can account for EVERY
    launch that has occured OR been reported to occur.  Until you can,
    I will assert that some rockets launched in the US were launched by
    aliens.  In fact, until you can account for every report of events
    which RESEMBLE rocket launches, I will assert that you are wrong.

Does it bother anyone to see themselves arguing in this fashion?

Might I point out that, with the exception of the "flattened only at the
top" anomaly, the "problems" described above are _exactly_ what one
might expect from a human created circle with a board?

I am a bit dismayed that non-circularity, reversal of rotational layers,
untouched tufts, deformation near tractor lines are things that seem
contrary to human production of these circles.

Quite the contrary, a perfectly circular circle, 100 yards in radius
with absolutely seamless bending in the same direction all the way
around would be something of a mystery.

Well, we know that it was good enough to fool the "expert" most often cited by
those who claim the crop circles are NOT hoaxes.

Well, most believers tend to be soemwhat credulous.  In his statement,

believe this?  I don't know; there is no reason to expect that there

Now, two folks come along, demonstrate how this is done, and guess

Well, I guess we skeptics have never accused believers of being

I hear all these references to alleged "copy cats" associated with
the crop circle thread. Where is your proof of their alleged existance?
More circles? Not good enough. I want more substantiated confessions
before the copy-cat theory will carry any weight with me.

I, myself, many years ago painted a large white circle in the middle of
an intersection.  I remember choosing a circle because of it's simple
geometry and the fact that it was more appealing than a triangle or a
square.  The circle was inspired by a series of large footprints found
painted down several miles of nearby rural road and reported in the local
press.

Had I been a rural rather than a suburban child, perhaps I would have
tampered with crops instead.  So, to all those residents of Lacey, Washington
who have for the last 20 years worried about aliens painting arcane symbols
on public roads... rest easy.  It *was* a hoax.

Right.  And when you GET more substantiated confessions, you'll then be able to
claim:  "But the copycats didn't confess until the technique made world news.
They just heard about how the two Limeys did it, practiced for awhile, and then
made up their confessions."  As of a week or so ago, all the PSI, UFO, etc.
advocates were saying "If it's a hoax, show us how it could have been done.
All the experts say there's no way a human being could have done it".  Now that
the technique has been demonstrated, they change the standard of proof to
something that, given the publicity, is TRULY impossible.  C'MON GUYS:  GIVE US
A STANDARD OF PROOF THAT'S AT LEAST THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE, THEN
STICK WITH IT.
