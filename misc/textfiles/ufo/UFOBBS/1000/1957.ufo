   One wag has dubbed the problem "Terra and the Pirates."  
   The pirates, ostensibly, are marauders from another solar system; their  
victims include a growing number of troubled human beings who insist that  
they've been shanghaied by these otherworldly visitors.  An outlandish  
scenario -- yet through the works of such authors as Budd Hopkins[1] and  
Whitley Strieber[2], the "alien abduction" syndrome has seized the public  
imagination.  Indeed, tales of UFO contact threaten to lapse into fashion-  
ability, even though, as I have elsewhere noted[3], they may still inflict a  
formidable social price upon the claimant.  
   Some time ago, I began to research these claims, concentrating my studies  
on the social and political environment surrounding these events.  As I  
studied, the project grew and its scope widened.  Indeed, I began to feel as  
though I'd gone digging through familiar terrain only to unearth Gomorrah.  
   These excavations may have disgorged a solution.  
  
  
THE PROBLEM  
  
   Among ufologists, the term "abduction" has come to refer to an  
infinitely-confounding experience, or matrix of experiences, shared by a
dizzying number of individuals, who claim that travellers from the stars
have scooped them out of their beds, or snatched them from their cars, and
subjected them to interrogations, quasi-medical examinations, and
"instruction" periods.   Usually, these sessions are said to occur within
alien spacecraft; frequently, the stories include terrifying details
reminiscent of the tortures inflicted   in Germany's death camps.  The
abductees often (though not always) lose all memory of these events;  they
find themselves back in their cars or beds, unable to account for hours of
"missing time."  Hypnosis, or some other trigger, can bring back these
haunted hours in an explosion of recollection -- and as the smoke clears,
an abductee will often spot a trail of similar experiences, stretching all
the way back to childhood.  
   Perhaps the oddest fact of these odd tales: Many abductees, for all their  
vividly-recollected agonies, claim to love their alien tormentors.  That's  
the word I've heard repeatedly: love.  
   Within the community of "scientific ufologists" -- those lonely, all-too  
little-heard advocates of reasonable and open-minded debate on matters  
saucerological -- these claims have elicited cautious interest and a  
commend-able restraint from conclusion-hopping.  Outside the higher realms
of scientific ufology, the situation is, alas, quite different.  In the
popular press, in both the "straight" and sensationalist media, within that
journalistic realm where issues are defined and public opinion solidified
(despite a frequently superficial approach to matters of evidence and
investigation) abduction scenarios have elicited two basic reactions: that
of the Believer and the Skeptic.
   The Believers -- and here we should note that "Believers" and "abductees"  
are two groups whose memberships overlap but are in no way congruent --  
accept such stories at face value.  They accept, despite the seeming  
absurdity of these tales, the internal contradictions, the askew logic of  
narrative construction, the severe discontinuity of emotional response to  
the actions described.  The Believers believe, despite reports that their
beloved "space brothers" use vile and inhuman tactics of medical
examination -- senseless procedures most of us (and certainly the vanguard
of an advanced race) would be ashamed to inflict on an animal.  The
Believers believe, despite the difficulty of reconciling these unsettling
tales with their own deliriums of benevolent off-worlders.
   Occasionally, the rough notes of a rationalization are offered:  "The  
aliens don't know what they are doing," we hear; or "Some aliens are bad."  
Yet the Believers confound their own reasoning when they insist on ascribing  
the wisdom of the ages and the beneficence of the angels to their beloved  
visitors.  The aliens allegedly know enough about our society to go about  
their business undetected by the local authorities and the general public;  
they communicate with the abductees in human tongue; they concern themselves  
with details of the percipients' innermost lives -- yet they remain so  
ignorant of our culture as to be unaware of the basic moral precepts  
concerning the dignity of the individual and the right to
self-determination.  Such dichotomies don't bother the Believers; they are
the faithful, and faith is assumed to have its mysteries.  SANCTA
SIMPLICITAS.  
   Conversely, the Skeptics dismiss these stories out of hand.  They  
dismiss, despite the intriguing confirmatory details: the multiple witness
events, the physical traces left by the ufonauts, the scars and implants
left on the abductees.  The skeptics scoff, though the abductees tell
stories similar in detail -- even certain tiny details, not known to the
general public.  
   Philip Klass is a debunker who, through his appearances on such  
television programs as NOVA and NIGHTLINE, has been in a position to affect
much of the public debate on UFOs.  In his interesting but
poorly-documented work on abductions[4], Klass claims that "abduction" is a
psychological disease, spread by those who write about it.  This argument
exactly resembles the professional press-basher's frequent assertion that
terrorism metastasizes through media exposure.  Yet for all the millions of
words expectorated by newsfolk on the subject of terrorism, terrorist
actions remain quite rare, as any statistician (though few politicians)
will admit, and verifiable linkage between crimes and their coverage
remains to be found.  For that matter, there have been books --
bestsellers, even -- on unicorns and gnomes.  People who claim to see those
creatures are few.  Abductees are plentiful.  
   Both Believer and Skeptic, in my opinion, miss the real story.  Both make  
the same mistake:  They connect the abduction phenomenon to the forty-year  
history of UFO sightings, and they apply their prejudices about the latter  
to the controversy about the former.  
   At first sight, the link seems natural.  Shouldn't our thoughts about  
UFOs color our thoughts about UFO abductions?  
   NO.  
   They may well be separate issues.  Or, rather, they are connected only  
in this:  The myth of the UFO has provided an effective cover story for an  
entirely different sort of mystery.  Remove yourself from the  
Believer/Skeptic dialectic, and you will see the third alternative.
   As we examine this alternative, we will, of necessity, stray far from the  
saucers.  We must turn our face from the paranormal and concentrate on the  
occult -- if, by "occult," we mean SECRET.  
   I posit that the abductees HAVE been abducted.  Yet they are also spewing  
fantasy -- or, more precisely, they have been given a set of lies to repeat  
and believe.  If my hypothesis proves true, then we must accept the  
following: The kidnapping is real.  The fear is real.  The pain is real.
The instruction is real.  But the little grey men from Zeti Reticuli are
NOT real; they are constructs, Halloween masks meant to disguise the real
faces of the con-trollers.  The abductors may not be visitors from Beyond;
rather, they may be a symptom of the carcinoma which blackens our body
politic.  
   The fault lies not in our stars, but in ourselves.  
  
  
THE HYPOTHESIS  
  
   Substantial evidence exists linking members of this country's  
intelligence community (including the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Defense Advanvced Research Projects Agency, and the Office of Naval
Intelligence) with the esoteric technology of MIND CONTROL.  For decades,
"spy-chiatrists" working behind the scenes -- on college campuses, in
CIA-sponsored institutes, and (most heinously) in prisons -- have
experimented with the erasure of memory, hypnotic resistance to torture,
truth serums, post-hypnotic suggestion, rapid induction of hypnosis,
electronic stimulation of the brain, non-ionizing radiation, microwave
induction of intracerebral "voices," and a host of even more disturbing
technologies.  Some of the projects exploring these areas were ARTICHOKE,
BLUEBIRD, PANDORA, MKDELTA, MKSEARCH and the infamous MKULTRA.  
   I have read nearly every available book on these projects, as well as the  
relevant congressional testimony[5].  I have also spent much time in  
university libraries researching relevant articles, contacting other
researchers (who have graciously allowed me access to their files), and
conducting interviews.   Moreover, I traveled to Washington, DC to review
the files John Marks compiled when he wrote THE SEARCH FOR "THE MANCHURIAN
CANDIDATE"[6].  These files include some 20,000 pages of CIA and Defense
Department documents, interviews, scientific articles, letters, etc.  The
views presented here are the result of extensive and ongoing research.
   As a result of this research, I have come to the following conclusions:  
   1.  Although misleading (and occasionally perjured) testimony before  
Congress indicated that the CIA's "brainwashing" efforts met with little  
success[7], striking advances were, in fact, made in this field.  As CIA  
veteran Miles Copeland once admitted to a reporter, "The congressional  
subcommittee which went into this sort of thing got only the barest  
glimpse." [8]
   2.  Clandestine research into thought manipulation has NOT stopped,  
despite CIA protestations that it no longer sponsors such studies.  Victor
Marchetti, 14-year veteran of the CIA and author of the renown expose, THE
CIA AND THE CULT OF INTELLIGENCE, confirmed in a 1977 interview that the
mind control research continues, and that CIA claims to the contrary are a
"cover story."[9]
   3.  The Central Intelligence Agency was not the only government agency  
involved in this research[10].  Indeed, many branches of our government took  
part in these studies -- including NASA, the Atomic Energy Commission, as  
well as all branches of the Defense Department.
   To these conclusions I would append the following -- NOT as firmly-  
established historical fact, but as a working hypothesis and grounds for  
investigation:  
   4.  The "UFO abduction" phenomenon MIGHT be a continuation of clandestine  
mind control operations.  
   I recognize the difficulties this thesis might present to those readers  
emotionally wedded to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, or to those whose  
political WELTANSHAUUNG disallows any such suspicions.  Still, the open-  
minded student of abductions should consider the possibilities.  Certainly,  
we are not being narrow-minded if we ask researchers to exhaust ALL  
terrestrial explanations before looking heavenward.
   Granted, this particular explanation may, at first, seem as bizarre as  
the phenomenon itself.  But I invite the skeptical reader to examine the
work of George Estabrooks, a seminal theorist on the use of hypnosis in
warfare, and a veteran of Project MKULTRA.  Estabrooks once amused himself
during a party by covertly hypnotizing two friends, who were led to believe
that the Prime Minister of England had just arrived; Estabrooks' victims
spent an hour conversing with, and even serving drinks to, the esteemed
visitor[11].  For ufologists, this incident raises an inescapable question:
If the Mesmeric arts can successfully evoke a non-existent Prime Minister,
why can't a represent-ative from the Pleiades be similarly induced?
   But there is much more to the present day technology of mind control than  
mere hypnosis -- and many good reasons to suspect that UFO abduction  
accounts are an artifact of continuing brainwashing/behavior modification
experiments.  
Moreover, I intend to demonstrate that, by using UFO mythology as a cover  
story, the experimenters may have solved the major problem with the work  
conducted in the 1950s -- "the disposal problem," i.e., the question of  
"What do we do with the victims?"  
   If, in these pages, I seem to stray from the subject of the saucers, I  
plead for patience.  Before I attempt to link UFO abductions with mind
control experiments, I must first show that this technology EXISTS.  Much
of the forthcoming is an introduction to the topic of mind control -- what
it is, and how it works.
  
                              II. The Technology  
  
A BRIEF OVERVIEW  
  
   In the early days of World War II, George Estabrooks, of Colgate  
University, wrote to the Department of War, describing in breathless terms
the possible uses of hypnosis in warfare[12].  The Army was intrigued;
Estabrooks had a job.  The true history of Estabrooks' wartime
collaboration with the CID, FBI[13] and other agencies may never be told:
After the war, he burned his diary pages covering the years 1940-45, and
thereafter avoided discussing his continuing government work with anyone,
even close members of the family[14].  Occasionally, he strongly intimated
that his work involved the creation of hypno-programmed couriers and
hypnotically-induced split personalities, but whether he succeeded in these
areas remains a controversial point.    Neverthe-less, the eccentric and
flamboyant Estabrooks remains a pivotal figure in the early history of
clandestine behavioral research.  
   Which is not to say that he worked alone.  World War II was the first  
conflict in which the human brain became a field of battle, where invading  
forces were led by the most notable names in psychology and pharmacology.   
On both sides, the war spurred furious efforts to create a "truth drug" for
use in interrogating prisoners.  General William "Wild Bill" Donovan,
director of the OSS, tasked his crack team -- including Dr. Winifred
Overhulser, Dr.Edward Strecker, Harry J. Anslinger and George White -- to
modify human perception and behavior through chemical means; their
"medicine cabinet" included scopolamine, peyote, barbiturates, mescaline,
and marijuana.  (This research had its amusing side: Donovan's "psychic
warriors" conducted many extensive and expensive trials before deciding
that the best method of administering tetrahydrocannibinol, the active
ingredient in marijuana, was via the cigarette.  Any jazz musician could
have told them as much[15].)  
   Simultaneously, the notorious NAZI doctors at Dachau experimented with  
mescaline as a means of eliminating the victim's will to resist.  Jews,  
slavs, gypsies, and other "Untermenschen" in the camp were surreptitiously
slipped the drug; later, mescaline was combined with hypnosis[16].  The
results of these tests were made available to the United States after the
War.  [cf. Operation PAPERCLIP, which transferred thousands of German and
Japanese intelligence researchers directly into the U.S. intelligence
community.  "Our Germans are BETTER than their Germans!" - DR. STRANGELOVE

   In 1947, the Navy conducted the first known post-war mind control  
program, Project CHAPTER, which continued the drug experiments.  Decades
later, journalists and investigators still haven't uncovered much
information about this project -- or, indeed, about any of the military's
other excursions into this field.  We know that the Army eventually founded
operations THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT; other project names remain
mysterious, though the existence of these programs is unquestionable.  [?
