"There is a genuine UFO phenomenon and it is not explained by the 
revelations of alleged government agents.. nor is it explained by 
the cultists of UMMO. Some of the most remarkable sightings are 
actually complex hoaxes that have been carefully engineered for our 
benefit. The witnesses are merely the victims and instruments rather 
than the authors of the hoax."  - Dr. Jacques Vallee

On February 6, 1966, near a suburb of Madrid, a group of Spanish 
soldiers observed a circular luminescent object land near an ammo 
dump. The disk was approximately 30' in diameter and bore an unusual 
symbol (three vertical lines with a central horizontal line) on its 
underside. After the object shot off, three deep rectangular 
impressions were found at the landing site.

A year later in another Madrid suburb, a lens-shaped object with a 
dome on top was seen traveling along power lines just above tree top 
level. This object was also emblazoned with the same symbol seen by 
the Spanish soldiers. Two photographers sent pictures to the 
newspaper Informaciones, and several months later additional 
pictures were delivered by a third photographer. As with the earlier 
incident, landing marks (including a scorched area and a metallic 
powder residue) were found near the area of the sighting.

During the next few days, residents of the area discovered several 
strange objects, shiny metal cylinders with a central disk portion. 
When opened, the cylinders were found to contain a tough plastic 
strip embossed with the same symbol seen on the underside of the 
UFOs.

A reward for the recovery of more of the mysterious objects was 
posted by a Henri Dagousset, with instructions that the objects be 
forwarded to one Antoine Nancey in Madrid. One of the objects was 
turned over to a Spanish UFO researcher by a man named Antonio 
Pardo, who just happened to be one of the photographers who had sent 
photos of the UFO to Informaciones.

Curiously, investigators who attempted to locate Dagousset, Nancey, 
and Pardo met with no success, they did not exist. When the 
cylinders were analyzed they were found to be constructed of earthly 
materials. The photos of the alleged UFO were analyzed by the French 
satellite imaging company, SPOT, who concluded that the photos  were 
fakes. The UFO model in the photos was determined to be 8.5 to 10 
inches in diameter and was suspended 10 feet from the camera. In one 
photo, the suspension string was revealed after enhancement. In 
short, the entire affair was an elaborate hoax, but the story does 
not end there.

Shortly thereafter and continuing for several years, documents 
bearing the same symbol as the hoaxed photos were mailed to numerous 
European UFO researchers. These documents came to be known as the 
UMMO documents. UMMO was supposedly the planet of origin of both the 
UFOs in the hoaxed photos and the documents. The UMMOians mailed 
hundreds of pages of data on their technology, their planet, and 
their philosophy. The author(s) of these documents were obviously 
knowledgeable in college-level physics, although the UMMO computer 
technology as described in the documents was considered advanced by 
1960s standards, but is crude by comparison to 1990s computer 
technology.

A cult-like group (including several credentialed scientists) formed 
to study the UMMO documents and spread the word of the UMMOians. The 
UMMO phenomenon spread across Europe and Latin America. Among the 
UMMO revelations was the existence of a counterpart or mirror 
universe to our own, much akin to Billy Meier's DAL Universe. 
Comparisons between UMMO and the Meier's alleged Pleiadian contacts 
are unavoidable. Since the whole UMMO story is a hoax, one could 
conclude that the same group of hoaxers could be behind the Meier 
case. If so, the level of expertise in hoaxing convincing UFO photos 
has risen considerably. The most obvious question is, who is doing 
the hoaxing and why?

It was feared that UMMO was a means for East-Bloc intelligence 
agencies to establish contacts with Western scientists, which is 
also a possible explanation for the Meier affair. Consider this, 
Meier quit taking UFO photos a few years ago, coinciding with the 
end of the Cold War.  The KGB, who certainly possessed the expertise 
necessary to produce convincing UFO photos, could have simply pulled 
the plug on the operation due to the changing political climate. 

 Another possible explanation involves one of the more bizarre 
characters in U.S. political history. According to noted UFO 
researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee, several French UFO investigators 
believe they have uncovered a link between the ongoing UMMO 
activities and scientists associated with the shadowy Lyndon 
LaRouche organization. LaRouche has organized a number of European 
front groups that would have had both the financial resources and 
technical expertise to perpetrate a hoax of this magnitude.

Most readers are probably unfamiliar with LaRouche, a radical neo-
Nazi who controlled a "political cult" that raked in as much as $80 
million a year. Fundraising activities occurred in almost every 
airport, where LaRouche disciples would solicit donations under the 
banner of "Feed Jane Fonda to the Whales" and "Beam Weapons/ Fusion 
Energy Now!". Ultimately, it was LaRouche's illegal fundraising 
schemes (credit card scams, fraud and theft) that landed him in a 
cell in the federal penitentiary where he now resides..

Just because LaRouche advocated some bizarre policies, such as his 
belief that the Queen of England was the boss of the international 
drug trade, and as recently as the late '70s advocating a nuclear 
war with the U.S.S.R (he considered 150 million American deaths as 
"acceptable"), he was in frequent contact with some of the more 
radical elements of the Reagan administration. Indeed, LaRouche was 
probably the intellectual author of President Reagan's SDI program.

Dennis King, author of "Lyndon LaRouche and the New American 
Fascism", described LaRouche's successes thusly: 
 "The major media had failed over the years to vigorously unmask 
LaRouche. Jewish and Black organizations and the left had largely 
ignored his dramatic political inroads in the early 1980s, blithely 
allowing him to operate his international network of hate from 
midtown Manhattan with nary a protest. Reagan administration aides, 
GOP operatives, Teamster leaders, and others on the right had 
treated him as just another political ally, to be used as needed. 
When the Klan endorsed President Reagan, it immediately received a 
blistering denunciation from him. But when NBC exposed the 
administration's ties to LaRouche, the White House response was that 
it would continue to meet with whomever it pleased".

The links between LaRouche and the Republican Party become confused 
when in 1984 LaRouche became a Democrat, running in Democratic 
presidential primaries. Thousands of LaRouchians ran for office in 
Democratic primaries, disrupting Democratic party activities from 
coast-to-coast. The Democrats seemed unable to respond to the 
LaRouche disruption, which U.S. Senator Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) 
described as "..a breakdown in our political immune system". Local 
LaRouchian Claude Jones was elected Chairman of the Harris County  
(Houston) Democratic Party, apparently because his name was the most 
WASPish on the ballot. Local Democrats endured the embarrassing 
spectacle of stripping their Chairman of all authority by 
temporarily changing their by-laws. It could easily be inferred that 
LaRouche's disruption of the Democratic Party had the blessings, if 
not the complicity, of the GOP.

All attempts to expose LaRouche resulted in a bevy of slander, 
libel, and civil rights lawsuits against the offending news 
organization. One such legal blitz caused the Washington Post to 
delete all references to LaRouche's Nazi philosophy in reporter John 
Mitz' story on the connections between LaRouche and the Reagan 
administration. When mentioned at all by the media, LaRouche was 
usually described as a "conservative Democrat".

What does all this have to do with the subject of UFOs? A disturbing 
trend in UFOlogy has been surfacing in recent years. More and more 
UFO lecturers have begun to incorporate political ideology into 
their presentations. Terms like "Trilateralists, Council on Foreign 
Relations, The New World Order / One World Conspiracy and Zionists" 
are used with increasing frequency in UFO lectures and publications. 
The fact that these terms have been the buzzwords of extreme right 
wing fringe groups should send off alarm bells loud and clear.

Take the case of George Green. Mr. Green claims to have seen "flying 
saucers" in a hanger at Edwards AFB in 1958. After his discharge, 
Green went about making his fortune in financial services, and most 
recently, publishing. On October 18, 1989 Green claims to have had 
direct telepathic contact with the Pleiadian Commander Gyeorgos 
Ceres Hatonn, whose precise title is "Commander-in-Chief, Earth 
Project Transition, Pleiades Flight Command, Intergalactic Fleet - 
Ashtar Command : Earth Representative to the Cosmic Council on Earth 
Transition" (we'll just call him Hatonn for short).

Hatonn's communications (via psychic channeling) have filled up 26 
volumes of Green's "Phoenix Journal". Among the revelations: Hatonn 
has a computer that allows him to keep up with the day to day 
activities of every human on Earth; Hatonn is here to help; Pray to 
Hatonn. Green also publishes the "Phoenix Journal Express" "for more 
up to the minute information" i.e. first person narratives allegedly 
channeled telepathically from Hatonn (the English is really stilted 
in spots so it must be from aliens). Hatonn is deeply concerned 
about U.S. economic policy, U.S. income tax structure, the 
International Monetary Fund, the CFR, the Trilateralists, and of 
course, the Zionists. Hatonn apparently has a lot in common with 
right wing neo-Nazi fringe groups.

Watching one of Green's videotaped lectures can be enlightening. He 
spouts the usual fringe right litany, and occasionally lapses into 
the standard LaRouche rhetoric about beam weapons, AIDS, and the 
menace of the Zionists. He mentions the ongoing research of his 
friend, Eustace Mullins, an associate of both the neo-Nazi Sons of 
Liberty and the LaRouche organization. Oh yes, he spends a few 
minutes talking about Billy Meier's purported Pleiadian UFO 
contacts.

Green's wife Desiree then takes the podium. Desiree, according to 
her biography, "..has been elected by the 'Lighted Command' who 
refer to themselves as 'The Hosts from Heaven, sent of God/Creator' 
as one of their public spokespersons for sharing the WORD contained 
within the Phoenix Journal series. She presents the Cosmic spiritual 
knowledge regarding our Divine Spiritual Heritage Within" (their 
punctuation). What this boils down to is about 15 minutes of an 
uninterrupted stream of pseudo-religion, new age cliches and 
psychobabble. During Desiree's lecture, Green grins incessantly, 
either due to husbandly pride, or more likely from barely being able 
to keep a straight face at this nonsense being presented as fact.
 
Another interesting example is  Dr. Fred Bell. Bell not only claims 
to be in contact with the Pleiadian Semjase of Billy Meier fame, but 
to have had sexual liaisons with her. He was  recently a guest on a 
local radio talk show to promote his appearance at a metaphysical 
festival here in Houston. Bell recounted some of the teachings of 
the Pleiadian "Space Brothers", although, curiously, the name of His 
Supreme Cosmic Highness Hatonn wasn't mentioned. It didn't take long 
before the usual kook-right propaganda began, including the 
obligatory slam at "Zionists". The host, to his credit, cut Bell off 
and apologized to his listeners with words to the affect of "I 
thought he was going to talk about UFOs".

A pattern is developing. People interested in the subject of UFOs 
are hooked by talk of "Pleiadian Space Brothers" and then subjected 
to fringe right political propaganda. The fact that these neo-Nazis 
can proselytize an unsuspecting audience has apparently made 
infiltration of UFO organizations a political objective of these 
groups. 

After meeting with Robert (Area 51) Lazar, Jacques Vallee began 
receiving letters from a "colonel" in the Las Vegas, inviting him to 
spend a month (all expenses paid) with a group of  people who were 
preparing "a major belief change in America". The incentive for 
joining this group was "to establish contact with the aliens". 
Vallee was instantly put-off by this group's letterhead featuring a 
Nazi styled eagle clutching SS (sig runen) lightning bolts.

Says Vallee: 
"Another aspect many researchers in this field (UFOs) have 
studiously avoided is the link between the more eager proponents of 
imminent extraterrestrial contact and the American extreme right. It 
could well be the same kind of fanaticism that leads people to join 
neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic, or survivalist movements in the American SW 
also induces them to believe in the imminent arrival of aliens from 
the sky. But it could also be that some intelligence agency, or some 
rogue group within such an agency, has been bending the latest 
paranoia of some extremist political movements to its own ends as 
useful, convenient testbeds for covert psychological experiments".

In his excellent book "Revelations", Vallee recounts the Bentwaters 
(England) case to illustrate his point. As described by many of the 
witnesses, the incident could certainly have been a set-up to gauge 
the response of military personnel to this apparent CE3K. The case 
of the Gulf Breeze Six also raises questions for Vallee. Were these 
six soldiers deliberately exposed to materials that led them to 
believe a major UFO incident would occur at Gulf Breeze? The fact 
that the Gulf Breeze Six were simply discharged without disciplinary 
action should raise an eyebrow or two, considering that they all 
held high security clearances and their going AWOL could have 
represented a major security breach. Vallee believes that the U.S. 
has developed a convincing-looking UFO which is "being actively 
tested on military personnel, thus the persons who control the 
experiment can always contain the repercussion if the story ever 
leaks out".

There is an abundance of circumstantial evidence to indicate that 
UFO hoaxes are being perpetrated by persons or organizations with 
substantial resources. The anti-Semitic focus of some of these 
hoaxers should arouse immediate suspicion. The fact that many UFO 
enthusiasts believe in a pantheon of alien entities that features 
blonde, Nordic-looking "Aryans" from the Pleiades as the cosmic 
"good-guys" in an interstellar battle between good and evil should 
give an indication of how successful these groups have already been. 
In addition to the hoaxers' ability to infiltrate and influence UFO 
organizations, anti-democratic factions within intelligence agencies 
can conduct psychological and unconventional warfare experiments 
without scrutiny under the guise of UFOs. Due to the success of 
frauds like Messers. Green and Bell, ardent cadres of zealous "true 
believers" can be depended upon to embarrass  serious UFO 
investigators, while diverting attention from and casting doubt on, 
serious UFO reports, which may in fact be the hoaxers' ultimate 
goal.

When confronted with self-proclaimed heralds of Pleiadian Space 
Brothers, it would be advisable to remain skeptical. If there are 
alien visitors who wish to establish contact with the human race, 
they could certainly do so much more effectively than with the 
political extremists, kooks and scam artists that are currently 
acting as their ambassadors.


Notes: The UMMO symbol can now be seen being sported as tattoos on 
those noble defenders of European culture, the skinheads. They won't 
know anything about UMMO or Pleiadean Space Brothers, however. For 
them, the symbol is a stylized "HH" .. for Heil Hitler.

 Lyndon LaRouche is again seeking the Democratic presidential 
nomination, garnering a whopping 1% of the primary vote. Despite his 
incarceration, he still has the financial resources to run 30 minute  
political programs on national TV.
