     "the dearth that follows here does not reflect the views of
     Jerry Woody nor ODYSSEY Network. This stuff comes from us!
     John & Gail Feilke - Directors of BBS Mgmt."

                       WHAT's THE DEAL HERE?!?!?!
          Well folks it's time to climb back on the old soapbox
     and spout again. The topic this time is "Making Mega-Bucks"
          Don't know about y'all, but we here at KRALIZEC have
     been SWAMPED lately by mailed advertisments shilling every
     type of UFO & Paranormal media available, at a price of
     course. I won't mention any names here (can't afford any
     libel suits) but these folks have offered the following:
     videos, posters, books, pictures, copies of offical
     documents, convention tickets, crystals, catalogs, ect,ect.
     First off, where the hell do "they" get our names and
     address's? 2nd, how do you get them to stop? But that's not
     what ticks us off. What does is that there are people out
     there making a hell-of-a-lot of money by re-cycling the same
     old stuff over and over and catching the newbies (not us
     savvy old pros) and milking them for BIG bucks. Funny thing
     but 20 or so years ago there was none of this going on. You
     had a few books (paperback) and two organizations, NICAP &
     APRO and two or three magazines. These folks were in it not
     for the money, but for the explanation of the UFO Enigma. You
     would think with all the money being poured into this that
     there would be some sort of break-thru in respect to
     explaning these damned UFOs! But not so true believer, no
     these bucks are going into bank accounts. And then the cycle
     starts over again. Is this not defeating our purpose of
     finding out what's going on? And more important, only the
     ones that can pay are getting the information! Kinda mimics
     the government does it not, if you have money then you get
     the best treatment (police, firemen, ect,ect) But then again
     maybe the government is running the "whole UFO show", and
     there is always strings being pulled from the top, where and
     who is the top??
         Ok, enuf for now! bout to run outta lines and we don't
     want to see what happens if we go over(don't want to re-type
     this) We want to start a "letters to the editor" section
     here. If you have a beef, death-threat, want to see
     something, love-letter, or a compliment. Send them to:

     KRALIZEC 300/14.400 baud 1:379/103
     or snail-mail them to:

     These Come From My Friend Peter Cox, Living In London,
     England.

          DEMON SEED
     A 17-year-old girl living in a "manproof" nunnery in Sicily
     claimed that the devil made her pregnant. The girl was never
     alone while in care, except in bed. Her parents didn't
     believe her and police were investigating.

          COLOUR ME SILVER
     Andrew and Julie Lindley looked on in astonishment as their
     house in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, turned siver before their
     eyes. Furniture, doors, and windows changed colourand started
     to shine, as did some jellies, tomatoes and the feet of their
     11-year-old daughter Rebecca. The Outside of the house was
     coated with a silvery dust, though neighbouring houses were
     untouched. Council officals took away samples for testing.
          DAILY MIRROR - October 26, 1991

          CENTRAL ASIAN UFOs
     Soviet Scientists at a UFO conference in Munich in June 1990
     claimed that leaked documents and a picture of UFO wreckage
     showed that two MIG 25 fighters had intercepted a UFO in a
     remote region of Azerbaijan in March 1983. They fired two
     rockets when it turned on a collision course. The pilot's
     report said the UFO turned a bright colour and fell to Earth.
     The wreckage was discovered by mushroom pickers who later
     died - seemingly from radiation.
          DAILY EXPRESS / DAILY MAIL - June 25, 1990

     Further east during the past year, nomads in the remotest
     areas of Mongolia's vast territory have ofter reported seeing
     visitors from another planet who look like human beings but
     speak no language, communicating only by telepathy. One of
     the sightings was by a woman who was flown over the capital,
     Ulan Bator, in a spaceship.
          THE TIMES - July 25, 1991

          WEIRDNESS
     A woman ripped out her sister's tongue piece by piece with
     her fingernails while the two were in jail in Chester, South
     Carolina. Donna Doxie, 24, told police she was removing a
     demon from her sister, Melody Shelton, 26. Ms Shelton
     apparently did not resist.
          AP - October 10, 1991

     A couple from Tomelilla in Sweden were driving down a road to
     Lake Snogeholm, south of Sjobo in Scania, when a large bream
     (fish?? J&GF), fell from the sky and smashed their windscreen

                             US AND "THEM"
                                 by Andy Roberts
                                 Fortean Times Feb-Mar 1992

          ET or not ET? But is that the question? After forty-one
     years of UFO research the main theory id that, yes, they are
     extraterrestial in origin. But "how" do we know this? Mainly,
     because that's how we would like them to be. In some cases
     'they' have been kind enough to tell us. For instance Betty
     Hill - one of the first famous abductees - recalled, under
     hypnosis, a star map since interpreted as showing the
     formation Zeta Reticuli; a location popular in ufolore ever
     since.
          But it's a long way from Zeta Reticuli to Earth simplty
     to do pointless gynaecological experiments on humans; and
     let's face it, bearing in mind their past failures -
     Adamski's aliens told him they came from the Moon! - would
     you believe an alien anyway? Like the spirits of mediumship,
     the discourses of angles and the news from fairyland, the
     alien message is one of deception, not information. So why do
     people still listen and belive they come from 'out there'?
          Ufologist Budd Hopkins has taken a pragmetic view,
     reasoning that it's not where they come from that matters but
     what they are doing while here. An interesting approach but
     essentially a useless one if we can only infer what 'they'
     are and where 'they' come from by their percieved actions.
     This brings us back to the problem with fairies, discarnate
     spirits, and angles; the universe can't be so crowded as to
     accommodate them all, can it? If it is, we seem to be the
     only sane entities among a cosmic population of liars,
     deceivers and body-snatchers. Are we looking in the wrong
     place for the source of these aliens?
          Following a Close Encounter he had one Christmas, writer
     Whitley Strieber wrote "Communion" and its sequel
     "Transformation", highly personal accounts of his experiences
     with the 'visitors', as he called them, and became the major
     populariser of the UFO subject in the 1980's. Strieber never
     thought they were extraterrestrials, but his honest ambiguity
     played into the hands of those who did and claimed him as one
     of their own.
          Recently, Strieber issued a statement indicating his
     thoughts about the source of all alien contacts: "The
     abduction reports [UFO investigators] generate are not real.
     They are artifacts of hypnosis and cultural conditioning. We
     are experiencing a perceptual anomaly that is sufficiently
     ambigous and intense that it demands explaination. It is
     something that human beings have been experiencing for a long
     time. It is the cause of the 'alien abduction' belief. What
     is really behind these experiences? We are. This is a human
     thing. However, I would say that we, and our world, are
     vastly different and far more strange than we have ever
     dreamed or dared imagine." With this, Strieber leans toward a
     OO 4-07                      Page 9                   11 Apr 1992


     more broad-based, Fortean interpretation of phenomena than
     the 'us and them' view of traditional ufology.
          Of all the theories about the origin of UFOs, the
     possibility that they emanate from ourselves, here and now,
     is persistently discarded as though somehow neither we nor
     our planet have any remaining mystery. What a condescending,
     shallow, and narrow-minded view of the human species and
     Nature herself! Natural phenomena, the mysteries of the
     psyche (both social and individual), and how these interact
     to create mythologies, are far more interesting than the
     belief that in some distant galaxy aliens are packing their
     kitbags with sharp instruments for anothe trip into some
     luckless earthling's bedroom.
          As yet, no evidence of the extraterrestrial nature of
     UFOs has successfully withstood the tests of time or serious
     investigation.It is simply a belief.Strieber is correct, but
     will probably be ignored; his assessment will slip away from
     memory to be lost, like the mystery itself, in the forest of
     beliefs and suppositions.
          The UFO phenomenon seems to be a planetary, human-based
     phenomenon comprising a complex mixture of factors. As
     ufologist John Keel said in these very pages: "We are the
     intelligence which controls the phenomena...". We have been
     misleading ourselves. It is high time we began to solve the
     mystery of our own being, rather than abnegating
     responsibility to the rather incompetent pilots of the silver
     spaceships with their toy-town technology and exaggerated
     interest in our genitalia.
