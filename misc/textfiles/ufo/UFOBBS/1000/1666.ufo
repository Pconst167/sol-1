FLYING SAUCER PHOTOS: A Gulf Breeze, Fla., man whose photos of purported UFO's 
three years ago resulted in a book and worldwide attention, said a model 
flying saucer found in his former home isn't his. "If I were trying to pull a 
hoax -- and I'm not -- then it would have been stupid to leave it there," Ed
walters, 43, told the Pensacola News Journal. The newspaper used the 
foam-plate saucer in photos similar to the ones Walters showed in 1987.
