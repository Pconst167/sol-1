Russian fighters shot down a UFO which flew straight at them.
     They saw it change colour and plummet to the ground after their rockets slammed home.
     Two peasants who found a piece of wreckage died soon afterwards.  The rest of the craft is being kept hidden by the KGB.
     The amazing claims weremade yesterday by Soviet scientists attending a conference on UFOs in West Germany.
     Dr. Marina Popvich, a former Russian airforce colonel, said:  "I believe the military are holding on to something which originated outside our planet."
     The delegation said the UFO was shot down in 1983 by a pair of MIG fighters.
     Two peasants who found a piece nearly 20-feet square later died, apparently from the effects of radiation.
     Dr. Valery Uvarov said:  "We have seen the pilot's report.  It says the UFO did not explode but turned a bright colour and then fell to earth."
     A leading German scientist said:  "I am usually very sceptical about most UFO stories, but this one cannot be treated lightly."
