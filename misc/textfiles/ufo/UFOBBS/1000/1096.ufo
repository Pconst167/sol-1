Frances Shaw was driving south on N.C. 226 near her home in Shelby
Sunday night when she had a close encounter with a perfectly round
orange object hovering in the sky.
 
As Shaw kept driving, she said the object grew larger and the orange
light it was emitting intensified and began blinking. Shaw, was scared
and thought it was going to land in her front yard.
 
Shaw, said it didn't land but disappeared just as she was pulling
up to her house. Shaw said when the object disappeared, it left a
"trail of smoke."
 
County Sheriffs Department said three other people called, all with
in 15 minutes of each other, to report a bright light traveling west
to east.

The Sheriff's department contacted the Federal Aviation Administration
in Charlotte, which reported no unusual fight experiments over the
area or planes in distress.
 
Shaw, said she didn't think the object she saw was a plane. At first,
she said she thought it might have been a blinking light on top of
a tower. But as it grew in size and intensity. she could tell that
it wasn't.
