                                By Jacque Vallee


In his book "Passport to Magonia", Jacque Vallee, a computer scientist and
student of UFOlogy, traces the many parallels between the ancient myths of all
cultures and today's stories of UFO's.  He goes on to propose that UFO
experiences are paranormal in nature and are the space-age equivalent of a
phenomenon that assumes different guises in different historical contexts.
Vallee suggests that human life is controlled by imagination and myth and that
paranormal experiences are the means by which man's ideas about himself and his
universe are constantly shaped.  Such experiences, he adds, become especially
important in times of social stress.  In his view the UFO phenomenon is the
present-day "tool" in this control system.  The great mystery is whether this
control is part of man's genetic makeup or whether it is imposed upon him from
without -- through alien intervention.
