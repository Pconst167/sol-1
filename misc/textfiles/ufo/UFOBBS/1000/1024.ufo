PART 5

The William Moore/MJ-12 Maze: Late in the summer of 1979  William
L.  Moore  had left a teaching job in a small Minnesota  town  to
relocate  in Arizona, where he hoped to pursue a writing  career.
Moore was deeply involved in the investigation of an apparent UFO
crash  in New Mexico in July 1947, a case he and Charles  Berlitz
would  recount in their The Roswell Incident the following  year.
After  his move to the Southwest Moore became close to Coral  and
James  Lorenzen  of the Aerial  Phenomena  Research  Organization
(APRO) and in due course Moore was asked to join the APRO  board.
The  Lorenzens told him about Bennewitz's claims. Bennewitz,  Jim
Lorenzen thought, was "prone to make great leaps of logic on  the
basis of incomplete data" (Moore, 1989a).

 The Roswell Incident was published in the summer of 1980 and  in
September  a  debate on UFOs at the Smithsonian  Institution  was
scheduled  to take place. Moore set off from his Arizona home  to
Washington, D.C., to attend the debate and along the way promoted
his  new  book  on radio and television shows.  According  to  an
account he would give seven years later, an extraordinary  series
of events began while he was on this trip.

 He had done a radio show in Omaha and was in the station  lobby,
suitcase in hand, on his way to catch a plane which was to  leave
within the hour when a receptionist asked if he was Mr. Moore. He
had  a  phone  call. The caller was a man who  claimed  to  be  a
colonel at nearby Offutt AFB, He said, "We think you're the  only
one  we've heard who seems to know what he's talking  about."  He
asked  if  he and Moore could meet and discuss  matters  further.
Moore  said  that  since  he was leaving town  in  the  next  few
minutes,  that  would not be possible, though he wrote  down  the
man's phone number.

 Moore went on to Washington. On September 8, on his way back, he
did a radio show in Albuquerque. On the way out of the studio the
receptionist  told  him  he had a phone  call.  The  caller,  who
identified  himself  as an individual from nearby  Kirtland  AFB,
said,  "We think you're the only one we've heard about who  seems
to know what he's talking about." Moore said, "Where have I heard
that before?"

 Soon afterwards Moore and the individual he would call  "Falcon"
met  at a local restaurant. Falcon, later alleged (though  denied
by  Moore) to be U.S. Air Force Sgt. Richard Doty, said he  would
be  wearing a red tie. This first meeting would initiate a  long-
running  relationship  between  Moore (and,  beginning  in  1982,
partner Jaime Shandera) and 10 members of a shadowy group said to
be connected with military intelligence and to be opposed to  the
continuation  of  the UFO cover-up. The story that  emerged  from
this interaction goes like this:

 The  first  UFO crash, involving bodies of  small,  gray-skinned
humanoids,  occurred  near  Corona,  New  Mexico,  in  1947  (the
"Roswell  incident"). Two years later a humanoid was found  alive
and  it  was housed at Los Alamos until its death  in  the  early
1950s.  It  was called EBE,  after  "extraterrestrial  biological
entity," and it was the first of three the U.S. government  would
have  in its custody between then and now. An Air Force  captain,
now  a retired colonel, was EBE-1's constant companion. At  first
communication with it was almost impossible; then a speech device
which enabled the being to speak a sort of English was  implanted
in  its  throat. It turned out that EBE-1, the  equivalent  of  a
mechanic  on a spaceship, related what it knew of the nature  and
purpose of the visitation.

 In  response  to the Roswell incident, MJ-12-the MJ  stands  for
"Majestic"--as  set  up  by executive order  of  President  Harry
Truman  on September 24, 1947. MJ-12 operates as a  policy-making
body.  Project  Aquarius is an umbrella group in  which  all  the
various compartments dealing with ET-related issues perform their
various    functions.   Project   Sigma    conducts    electronic
communication  with  the extraterrestrials, part  of  an  ongoing
contact  project run through the National Security  Agency  since
1964,  following a landing at Holloman AFB in late April of  that
year.

 Nine extraterrestrial races are visiting the earth. One of these
races,   little  gray-skinned  people  from  the   third   planet
surrounding  Zeta Reticuli, have been here for 25,000  years  and
influenced  the direction of human evolution. They also  help  in
the shaping of our religious beliefs. Some important  individuals
within the cover-up want it to end and are preparing the American
people for the reality of the alien presence through the  vehicle
of popular entertainment, including the films Close Encounters of
the Third Kind, whose climax is a thinly-disguised version of the
Holloman landing, and ET.

 At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, there is a thick  book
called  "The  Bible," a compilation of all  the  various  project
reports.

 According  to his own account, which he would not  relate  until
1989,   Moore  cooperated  with  his   AFOSI   sources-including,
prominently,  Richard  Doty-and provided them  with  information.
They  informed  him  that  there  was  considerable  interest  in
Bennewitz.  Moore was made to understand that as his part of  the
bargain  he was to spy on Bennewitz and also on APRO as well  as,
in Moore's words, "to a lesser extent, several other individuals"
(Moore, 1989a). He learned that several government agencies  were
interested in Bennewitz's activities and they wanted to  inundate
him   with  false  information-disinformation,  in   intelligence
parlance-to  confuse  him.  Moore says he was not  one  of  those
providing  the disinformation, but he knew some of those  of  who
were, such as Doty.

 Bennewitz  on  his own had already begun to  devise  a  paranoid
interpretation of what he thought he was seeing and hearing,  and
the disinformation passed on to him built on that foundation. His
sources  told him that the U.S. government and malevolent  aliens
are in an uneasy alliance to control the planet, that the  aliens
are  killing  and mutilating not only cattle  but  human  beings,
whose organs they need to lengthen their lives, and that they are
even  eating  human  flesh. In underground  bases  at  government
installations in Nevada and New Mexico human and alien scientists
work  together on ghastly experiments, including the creation  of
soulless androids out of human and animal body parts. Aliens  are
abducting  as many as one American in 40 and  implanting  devices
which control human behavior. ClA brainwashing and other  control
techniques  are  doing  the same, turning life on  earth  into  a
nightmare  of  violence  and  irrationality.  It  was,  as  Moore
remarks,  "the  wildest  science fiction  scenario  anyone  could
possibly imagine."

 But Bennewitz believed it. He grew ever more obsessed and  tried
to  alert  prominent  persons to  the  imminent  threat,  showing
photographs  which  he held showed human-alien  activity  in  the
Kirtland area but which dispassionate observers thought  depicted
natural  rock formations and other mundane phenomena.  Eventually
Bennewitz  was  hospitalized,  but on  his  release  resumed  his
activities,  which  continue  to  this  day.  Soon  the  ghoulish
scenario  would spread into the larger UFO community  and  beyond
and  command  a small but committed band of believers.  But  that
would  not  happen  until  the late 1980s and  it  would  not  be
Bennewitz who would be responsible for it.
