SUBJECT: MSG THREAD ON THE PHOENIX PROJECT                   FILE: UFO1545

PART 4


PP> Do not expect us to respond to the other coincidences,
PP> suppositions, insinuations or innuendoes contained in your message.

Why?  Perhaps because there are other "insinuations" that cannot be
truthfully denied?  As a matter of fact, we now have solid confirmation
of another one of our "insinuations"--i.e., the fact that the Richard
Miller who owns Advent Publishing is indeed the same Richard Miller who
used to channel "Hatonn".  That confirmation came from none other than
Mr. Miller himself.  So I guess we're not doing too badly.

In consideration of your explicit denials of any ties to America West,
and in view of the additional information provided privately by Mr.
Miller, we withdraw our previous suggestion of possible connections
between the Phoenix Project and the America West/Phoenix Liberator
operation.  As we stated before, those suggestions were tentative
pending further investigation, and further investigation has not
uncovered any additional evidence to support them.  Unfortunately, this
is the kind of burden that the Phoenix Project inevitably took on when
it chose to publicly portray itself as a clandestine organization.

PP> Since you brought up America West and The "Phoenix Liberator," why
PP> not turn your investigative abilities loose on their organization.
PP> Just suppose that Milton Cooper is, quietly, linked to their
PP> organization. That should intrigue you.

It does, if true.  We also find it intriguing that you are, apparently,
using Cooper's material without attributing it to him--thereby lending
it credibility when there is every indication that it is completely
bogus.

PP> Equally intriguing, is
PP> where their funding comes from - not the obvious subscription
PP> income - the covert funding.  Or, how about the busy and numerous,
PP> off premise, writers that prepare the volumes of "Hatonn" material,
PP> and their use of high-speed modems to provide the copy for each
PP> weekly issue of the "Phoenix Liberator" and the dozens of books
PP> they produce. In our supposition, we're talking about a big-time
PP> operation. You might also check out their printing facilities,
PP> distribution centers, and world-wide circulation.  Equally
PP> fascinating is their sudden rise, in a few short years, to the top
PP> of the New Age Movement.  You might even think to ask yourself, why
PP> the New Age Movement?  What possible connection is there with
PP> covert government UFO activities, or a New World Order, with the
PP> New Age Movement?  The answer to that might be revealed, if you dig
PP> deep enough, and discover high-speed modem links between their
PP> headquarters and certain organizations located at Langley and Ft.
PP> Meade.  Yes, if you really dig, you might uncover all kinds of
PP> interesting things about America West.

Thanks for the tip.

PP> As to your effort in trying to identify staff personnel of the
PP> Phoenix Project -- good luck.  However, we do have to admit that
PP> you may get lucky and hit on a couple of them.  However, since
PP> there are many, it is doubtful you will ever get beyond that point.

Our only interest in the personnel of the Phoenix Project is to
determine whether the Project has a hidden agenda, and whether it is
covertly linked to other organizations whose agendas are known.  That
interest was made necessary by the Project's clandestine nature and
consequent lack of public accountability.  You brought it on
yourselves, and your continuing hostility and evasiveness suggest that
we were not entirely mistaken in our suspicions.

Our investigation continues.  We'll let you know what we find out.
