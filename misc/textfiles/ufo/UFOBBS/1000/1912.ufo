Executive Briefing {Memo}

Yesterday R2 requested briefing on Project "A".  In particular,
he wanted update info from [BLANK].  MJ3 advised that that
info was not available to R2.  Apparently, White House requested
info because of [         BLANK            ].  Can't seem
to make those fools realize [BLANK] info is not available for
any dissemination, per EO 01156, regardless of who requests
info.  Contact T-2P and see if he can assume custody of the
matter.

Don't allow AF to evaluate IDENT info.  They may open up a
little too much.  KEND-3 can assist to some extent.
