Subj: RE: ALIENS
I appreciate your comments. The genetics base (underground) co-run by the US
government and the Greys is near Dulce, New Mexico, just below the NM-CO
border. It is VERY dangerous to go exploring there, cause if you're caught,
you'll likely get a 1 way ticket to the base. One level is called Nightmare
Hall where the Greys are doing hideous experiments. You should read Matrix II
by Valdamar Valarian if you really want to be shocked. As the governments are
working with the Greys (including the Canadian gov't), there's not anything you
can do except by becoming as aware as you can and spreading the information.
There are a number of bases is the US and Canada as well as around the world.
These bases are connected by a vast underground tunnel system. Matrix II has a
map of the major bases of the southwestern US (underground/alien) and shows the
connecting tunnels. One they didn't list is the one beneath Boynton Canyon in
Sedona, AZ. When I visited there last month, the locals were very willing to
discuss their (common) experiences with alien craft. They tell of large
military trucks traveling through Sedona to get to the underground access.
These military trucks creep in during the wee hours of the morning. Locals tell
of the black helicopters and how, if you're daring enough, you can go to see
them in the distance. I wouldn't recommend it. The center of that base is said
to be in Secret Canyon and they strongly urge no one go investigating that one.
Human bones, I was told, have been found more than once and locals have
disappeared there as well. Did you also know that the government uses the term
IAC (identified alien craft) when refering to the ships? UFO is for civilian
purposes. Strieber, who it is said works for the CIA, was chastised by the
Greys for eating chocolate. According to his books, they can't use your bodily
fluids if you've been eating chocolate. Pass the Hersey bars!

        John Lear and I have been friends and colleagues got some years now.
Currently I live in New Mexico and have been researching the Dulce Alien Base
question since Paul Bennewitz began to send his reports to APRO in the
Mid-70's. Although we have not been able to track down the exact location, and
over the years it has become rumored that the base now no longer exist. However
both John  and I have been able to come up with witness accounts that indicate
that the base did exist. One such witness was abducted with her son and taken
there. We have a series of notes taken from Dr. Leo Sprinkle of the regression
session with this woman which pretty much substanciates everything, including
her viewing of a room with vats full of human body parts floating in it.
