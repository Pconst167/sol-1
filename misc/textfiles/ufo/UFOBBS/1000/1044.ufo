A series of PROJECT GRUDGE/BLUE BOOK reports have been
released over the years in connection with the USAF's
investigation into UFO's which was supposedly terminated with
the release of the Condon report in the late 1960's.  Reports
1 through twelve of GRUDGE/BLUE BOOK were generally innocuous
and contained no classified or truly sensitive material.
There was a final report, #14 which was widely circulated and
about which an entire book was written:  FLYING SAUCERS: AN
ANALYSIS OF THE AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT
NO. 14 by Leon Davidson: the fifth edition was published in
1976 by Blue-Book Publishers; 64 Prospect St., White Plains,
New York 10606.  Missing from public view, however, was
report #13.

Several years ago, Bill English, son of an Arizona state
legislator and former captain in the Green Berets had been
asigned to an RAF 'listening post' north of London as an
information analyst.  English was, in the course of his
duties, asked to prepare an analysis of the elusive GRUDGE 13
report.  On his discharge from his work at the 'listening
post' he returned to the United States and began to do a
little UFO research on his own.  English had been no stranger
to the UFO phenominon.  In Viet Nam he was a member of a
Special Forces investigative team that went in to retrieve a
B-52 that was forced down by a UFO and all the occupants
killed.  Communications had been received from the B-52
before it went down to the effect that it was "...under
attack by a UFO..", A "...large light...".  The plane was
found intact, sitting in the jungle.  There was no swath
indicative of a crash landing.  Only the bottom of the
fuselage showed any damage, there was no damage to the
underside of the engine pods.  Although the plane was
completely intact the entire crew had been mutilated.

English, through contacts he still maintains has determined
that the US Government 'most definately' supports a 'project
dealing specifically with UFO's and captured aliens'.
According to what he has learned, the US government captured
a trio of aliens, and that as of mid 1981, one of the beings
was still alive in captivity.  English also claims that "at
one point in the early 1950's until the mid 1960's the Air
Force maintained relocation and debriefing colonies for
people who had experienced close encounters of the 3rd and
4th kind.  They were isolated for all intents and purposes
for the rest of their lives.  He doubts that these colonies
are still in existence.

English dictated 2 audio casettes outlining what he
remembered from the Grudge 13 report.  These audio casettes
were transcribed into hand written notes by another person.
The information contained therein indicated what had been
suspected all along: that the US government was involved in
the greatest deception in the history of mankind and that not
only did flying saucers exist but that the government had
several in secret storage and had captured at least 3 live
aliens.

The following is a summary of what Bill English remembers
from what he read during that day in June, 1977 of PROJECT
GRUDGE/BLUE BOOK REPORT NO 13.
