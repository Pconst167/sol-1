     SHUTTLE ATLANTIS ASTRONAUTS FIND SPYING FROM SPACE
     DIFFICULT

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (NOV. 29) UPI -  The ability of
     astronauts to spy from orbit is ''marginal'' at present,
     but improved equipment and better training could make
     future space fliers a definite military asset, one of the
     shuttle Atlantis's crewmen said Friday.

     Astronaut Mario Runco told reporters during a news
     conference from space Friday that his ability to
     distinguish aircraft and ships on Earth is better than he
     expected, but not necessarily good enough to provide
     reliable tactical reconnaissance from orbit.

     ''I believe the astronaut can serve the military in
     space,'' he said. ''The observations I've made ... so far
     have been quite remarkable in terms of what we've
     accomplished in the past. They still have a long way to go,
     however, in terms of the equipment we use.

     ''As a real-time operational asset to the military, I would
     say our capabilities would be marginal. However, that may
     not be true in the future with a little investment in some
     better equipment and some more training.''

     Runco, 39, commander Frederick Gregory, 50, co-pilot
     Terence Henricks, 39, Story Musgrave, 56, James Voss, 42,
     and Army imagery expert Thomas Hennen, 39, accomplished the
     primary goal of the 44th shuttle flight Monday with the
     successful launch of an Air Force missile early warning
     satellite.

     Since then, the shuttle fliers have been carrying out
     on-board research, including two military
     space-surveillance experiments designed to help Pentagon
     planners determine the usefulness of astronauts as
     OO 2-01                      Page 3                    4 Jan 1992


     space-based spies.

     Wielding special cameras, Runco and Hennen have been
     photographing and assessing a variety of ground targets
     around the world to determine what they can see and how
     they interpret the resulting images.

     ''I'm surprised at what I can see,'' Runco said. ''I've
     been able to see large ships and airplanes. Whether I can
     identify those ships ... or airplanes, I haven't been able
     to do (because of camera limitations).''

     A major problem for the Atlantis's mission has been cloudy
     weather, which has prevented observations of various
     targets. Gregory and Musgrave, both shuttle veterans,
     agreed that the clarity of the atmosphere has diminished in
     recent years.

     But the weather cooperated Friday afternoon as Atlantis
     sailed over Cuba during the crew's 76th orbit, allowing
     Runco to photograph the Guantanamo Bay area and to
     distinguish the makeshift ''tent city'' set up there in
     recent days to house Haitian refugees.

     ''Calypso, Calypso, this is Atlantis,'' Runco radioed
     ground participants. ''Have on (film) on peninsula within
     bay several large white structures. This might be tent city
     you referred to. Again, at least three larger white
     structures or objects on peninsula within bay to the east
     of the first two piers. Over.

     ''Atlantis, this is Calypso,'' an unidentified man replied.
     ''Roger, solid copy. Believe you have identified tent
     city.''

     Nearly 5,800 Haitians fleeing their country in the wake of
     a military coup have been plucked from homemade rafts and
     overcrowded boats in international waters off Haiti since
     Oct. 29. Some 1,226 are housed at Guantanamo.

     Runco, a former New Jersey Highway Patrol officer, has
     primary responsibility for an experiment called M88-1.
     Hennen, an Army image analyst, is responsible for a project
     known as Terra Scout.

     While Terra Scout is devoted to studying how astronauts
     observe targets from space, M88-1 is designed to help
     military analysts better understand what the human eye can
     see from orbit and how astronauts might be of service in a
     time of national crisis.

     ''Occasionally we're going to have people up there and if
     there are world crises it would be good to know what our
     capabilities can be,'' Runco said before launch. ''It's
     kind of information of opportunity; if the asset is there,
     why not use it? Let's determine how well we can use that
     OO 2-01                      Page 4                    4 Jan 1992


     asset.''

     M88-1 is made up of two surveillance experiments -
     Battleview and Maritime Observation Experiments in Space,
     or MOSES - and one called Night Mist designed to evaluate
     the performance of UHF radio gear.

     Battleview involves surveillance of targets on land such as
     armored formations
     truck convoys, dust clouds and other natural phenomena.
     MOSES involves observation of ocean targets, such as ship
     wakes.

     The astronauts had hoped to use the UHF radio encrypt
     conversations with ground participants, but the radio's
     receiver is broken, forcing Runco and his crewmates to
     limit their radio traffic to unclassified material.

     Throughout the flight, Hennen has been using a computerized
     video camera with special lenses to observe a variety of
     ground targets around the world.

     ''What we're trying to do is document the manner in which a
     human observes and more specifically, analyzes data,''
     Hennen said before launch. ''What we want to do is
     translate that data into computer- assisted sensing
     systems. What we want to do is make smart sensors.''

     HUBBLE GLITCH CAUSED BY "BUG" IN EARTH-BOUND COMPUTER
     PROGRAM, OFFICIALS SAY

     CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (DEC. 11) UPI -  A ''bug'' in a computer
     program used on Earth to help control the Hubble Space
     Telescope knocked the satellite out of action Monday, but
     officials said Wednesday the costly observatory would be
     back in operation Thursday.
      ''This is one of those cases where the spacecraft once
     again protected itself from the humans on the ground who
     wrote the software,'' Hubble project scientist Edward
     Weiler said by telephone from Washington.
      The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, the most
     sophisticated astronomical satellite ever built, was
     launched from the shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990.
      Since then, ground controllers have struggled to overcome a
     variety of technical problems, ranging from trouble with
     the satellite's stabilizing gyroscopes to instrument
     problems and an unexpected jitter caused by solar panel
     flexing when the spacecraft passes from Earth's shadow into
     sunlight.
      The most serious problem, however, involves Hubble's main
     mirror. Shortly after launch, engineers discovered the
     mirror had been ground into the wrong shape, one that
     prevents it from bringing starlight to a sharp focus.
      NASA plans a 1993 shuttle repair mission to install
     corrective optics, new solar panels and replacement
     gyroscopes that should restore the satellite to design
     specifications.
      In the meantime, astronomers are using Hubble to make
     observations that are not severely affected by its flawed
     optical system. Science data is transmitted to Earth using
     two ''high-gain'' antennas that beam radio signals to a
     OO 2-01                      Page 7                    4 Jan 1992


     pair of NASA communications satellites.
      At 7:47 a.m. EST Monday, Hubble's on-board computer shut
     the telescope down, throwing the spacecraft into a form of
     electronic hibernation called a ''safe mode.'' The
     telescope is programmed to enter safe mode whenever a major
     problem is detected.
      Weiler said the problem Monday developed because of a
     software glitch on the ground that had gone undetected
     since launch.
      As Hubble orbits the Earth, its two high-gain antennas
     track the NASA communications satellite high above. When
     one such satellite disappears behind the limb of the Earth,
     computer programs on the ground calculate where the
     antennas should move to pick up the next satellite. Those
     commands then are radioed to Hubble and executed as
     required.
      Because of a bug in the ground software, Weiler said, the
     antenna was commanded to the wrong position on Monday.
      When Hubble's on-board computer checked the antenna's
     position later, it discovered the problem, ''found the
     antenna in the wrong place ... and it commanded (the
     antenna) to go over there and get there fast.''
      But safety provisions built into the telescope's on-board
     programming will not permit the antenna motors to exert
     more than a certain amount of force to prevent any possible
     damage.
      When Hubble's electronic brain attempted to correct the
     antenna problem Monday
     it caused the motor to work hard enough to violate the
     safety limits.
      ''We entered what we call a soft safe mode on Monday at
     7:47 a.m.,'' Weiler said. ''The reason we entered safe mode
     is ... the sensor that senses torque on the antenna motor
     said it was up to 10 inch-ounces of torque. That is the
     limit where the software will say stop, I'm going into safe
     mode.''
      He said the ground software is made up of three million
     lines of computer programming ''and as usual when humans
     build something, they left a few bugs in it. This bug has
     been there since launch. This was not a spacecraft
     problem.''
      He said the problem was identified Tuesday and that Hubble
     would be back in full operation Thursday.

     SOVIET COLLAPSE IS DAMAGING SPACE PROGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE,
     AVIATION WEEK SAYS

     NEW YORK (DEC. 13) BUSINESS WIRE - The chaotic state of the
     Soviet economy and accelerating disintegration of the
     Soviet military/industrial infrastructure is taking a
     serious toll on Soviet aerospace capabilities, according to
     the December 16 edition of Aviation Week & Space
     Technology.
      Soviet space launch operations have dropped to their lowest
     levels in 25 years and the evaporation of a stable central
     OO 2-01                      Page 8                    4 Jan 1992


     government has begun to affect planning for future U.S.
     space cooperation.
      Senior space editor Craig Covault describes the difficult
     conditions facing top managers of military and civilian
     space operations gleaned from exclusive interviews with
     high-ranking Soviet aerospace officials.  Shortages of raw
     materials are affecting spacecraft production, a large
     booster program is being terminated and a Soviet rocket
     recently exploded during ground tests, Covault reports.
      Aviation Week & Space Technology, published weekly by
     McGraw-Hill, is the leading journal for the worldwide
     aviation, aerospace and defense industries. The current
     issue also details the following developments:
       Issue of Control Over Soviet Nuclear Arms Worries U.S.:
     Central Intelligence Agency Director Robert Gates
     underscored grave concerns about the unravelling of central
     control of Soviet military forces and nuclear weapons,
     calling it a ''dangerously unstable'' situation.
      He and U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss provided a snapshot
     of the Bush Administration's concerns about the deepening
     political and economic crisis in the former U.S.S.R. during
     a Housing Armed Services Committee hearing last week.
      Senior editor John Morrocco reports that Gates predicted
     continued decay and breakup of the Soviet armed forces,
     while Strauss warned the panel that ''there are a lot of
     dangerous forces afoot'' in the Soviet Union that could
     affect the control and security of the Soviet nuclear
     arsenal.
      As support for a new confederation poses serious challenges
     to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's authority, the
     United States faces a period of great uncertainty while
     Russia sorts out who owns these weapons and creates a new
     framework for their control.
       What Doomed Pan Am:  The demise of Pan American World
     Airways closes a chapter in international aviation history.
      A team of Aviation Week & Space Technology editors traced
     its history and many achievements in a series of articles
     detailing the impact of Delta's announcement that it would
     not pump any more money into the ailing Pan Am.
      The inability of Pan Am to forge a place for itself in the
     changed environment of deregulation resulted in losses of
     more than $2 billion in the last decade.
     At the same time, United Airlines will probably become the
     premier U.S. international carrier if it completes the
     acquisition of Pan Am's routes to Latin America.  A senior
     financial analyst said last week that this acquisition
     would make United the ''North American business travelers'
     global airline.''
      Market Focus: Leading gainers and losers (Thursday, 12/12
     close): Continental Airlines down 29.92 percent; GenCorp.
     Inc. down 11/76 percent; Racal Electronics Plc. down 9.52
     percent.

     BOEING COMPLETES KEY DESIGN MILESTONE FOR SPACE STATION

     HUNTSVILLE, AL (DEC. 17) PR NEWSWIRE - Boeing Defense &
     Space Group has completed the initial design phase for work
     on Space Station Freedom, and received authorization today
     to proceed with final hardware design from NASA, NASA's
     international partners, and representatives from other
     station work packages.

     The authorizing certificate was signed as NASA and Boeing
     completed a major design review in Huntsville.

     The design review is a key milestone because Boeing now
     will begin work on final engineering drawings, and will
     initiate developmental and qualification tests leading to
     launch of the first pressurized module -- a node -- in late
     1996.

     Tests already are underway at NASA's Marshall Space Flight
     Center in Huntsville on about 10 major pieces of hardware.
     Results of this hardware-test phase will be used to


     complete final design for the space station by early 1993.

     Boeing is NASA's prime contractor to build the heart of the
     space station: its laboratory, living and logistics
     modules, connecting node structures and on-board systems.

     "Space Station Freedom is closer every day to reality,"
     said Richard Grant, Boeing program manager.  "The
     international orbiting laboratory has turned the corner
     from a strictly engineering program to a hardware program
     with tests underway."

     In Freedom's man-tended phase, which begins in 1996,
     astronauts will visit regularly to tend experiments in the
     OO 2-01                      Page 10                   4 Jan 1992


     unique microgravity environment of low-Earth orbit.  A crew
     of four will live there permanently by 1999, and over the
     next 30 years scientists will conduct life- and
     materials-science experiments.

     "Boeing and Marshall have made substantial progress during
     1991, also completing facilities and equipment for future
     hardware development," said George Hopson, NASA's project
     manager for Marshall's work package.  "The work has
     Press <RETURN> or <S>croll?s

     remained on schedule and within budget.

     "This progress has been made possible through the close
     working relationship of the Marshall, Boeing and
     subcontractor team," Hopson said.

     The coming year will have an aggressive hardware testing
     regimen that verifies the fundamental structural design of
     the space station's pressurized modules, nodes, hatches,
     windows and racks.

     "The thorough design and testing effort we've embarked on
     will ensure Space Station Freedom is a safe, highly
     operational facility to serve this nation and its
     international partners for decades to come," Grant said.

     Boeing employs about 2,000 people on the program.

     Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) and exclusive
     marketing rights to a procedure utilizing an organic
     compound, which has been researched and tested at AECOM for
     treatment of the AIDS virus, Thursday announced the release
     of the following report as it appears in the December issue
     of the journal AIDS.

     "Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine define
     chemical treatment that significantly lowers HIV's capacity
     to infect healthy cells.

     "Scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of
     Yeshiva University report that an in vitro treatment of the
     AIDS virus (HIV) and of HIV-infected cells with a mild
     chemical can significantly interfere with HIV's ability to
     further infect other cells.

     "The scientists evaluated the capacity of a group of
     chemicals, the alkylureas
     to inhibit infectivity of free HIV and to kill the virus in
     vitro in blood cells taken from AIDS patients. In
     particular, one type of alkylurea, butylurea, inhibited HIV
     infectivity at concentrations that have no adverse effect
     on red blood cell functions. The investigators showed that
     butylurea breaks the virus down to small, noninfectious
     particles.

     "Treatment of blood products with butylurea has the
     potential, therefore, to significantly lower the risk of
     HIV infection to transfusion recipients from donated blood
     carrying the the AIDS virus. The use of of alkylureas in
     patients will also be considered, since similar compounds
     have already been administered to patients with the blood
     disorder sickle cell anemia with only minor side effects.

     "This work was started in 1988 by Dr. Arye Rubinstein,
     professor of Microbiology and Immunology and of Pediatrics
     at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He was later
     joined by Einstein researchers, Drs. Harris Goldstein,
     Massimo Pettcello-Mantovani, Tobias R. Killman and Theresa
     Calvelli.

     "The researchers demonstrated that infectivity of HIV was
     decreased by more than 95 percent following treatment with
     butylurea, as measured by the activity of the virus's key
     enzyme, reverse transcriptase, and the concentration of the
     viral antigen p24. The current work extended preliminary
     data presented by Dr. Rubinstein at the Annual Meeting of
     the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology in San
     Francisco last year."

     Future Medical Products subsidiary Viromedics, which owns
     worldwide exclusive marketing rights for the patented
     procedure, further stated that the potential use for this
     compound can have a significant impact toward the reduction
     of HIV transmission through blood transfusions.

     PHILIPS MEDICAL SYSTEMS HAS NON-INVASIVE WAY TO IMAGE BLOOD
     VESSELS OF HEART

     SHELTON, CT (DEC. 19) BUSINESS WIRE - A new diagnostic
     technique under development by Philips Medical Systems is
     providing high resolution images of the heart and great
     vessels with less risk and less cost than existing
     technology.

     The new technique, called Gated Inflow, is an enhancement
     to existing magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and
     represents the latest advance in heart imaging technology.

     Doctors at Emory University in Atlanta have used the
     MRA-Gated Inflow technique to obtain images of heart
     conditions in infants and adults. MRA-Gated Inflow has
     enabled the doctors to avoid using the riskier and costlier
     cardiac catheterization technique, known also as X-Ray (or
     intra-arterial) angiography.

     Philips plans to apply for FDA approval next year and
     expects the system to be available for widespread use
     within two years. Ultimately, Philips scientists and Emory
     doctors predict that Gated Inflow will be used in routine
     heart screenings for older adults and those at risk of
     heart disease.

     MRA has been used with success to image vessels and
     diagnose vascular disorders throughout the body. However,
     until now, it has been difficult to obtain a clear picture
     of the heart and great vessels using MRA because of the
     movement caused by the pumping heart. MRA Gated Inflow
     solves this problem by reducing the image distortion caused
     by the action of the heart cycle.

     Heart problems have traditionally been diagnosed by cardiac
     catheterization, which is invasive and involves the
     injection of a dye, called a contrast agent
     into the vessels of the heart. An X-ray of the heart will
     OO 2-01                      Page 13                   4 Jan 1992


     detect the contrast agent and distinguish between blood and
     surrounding tissue. This method is often repeated to
     monitor patients with long-term conditions, subjecting the
     patient to several invasive procedures.

     SPACE BIOSPHERES VENTURES CONFIRMS SUPERIORITY OF BIOSPHERE
     2 SEAL

     ORACLE, AZ (DEC. 20) BUSINESS WIRE - Responding to media
     requests for clarification of a news release issued by
     Space Biospheres Ventures on Dec. 19
     Director of Systems Engineering William Dempster announced
     that a successful closure has been accomplished with a leak
     rate of 5-6 percent a year.

     Dempster explained that an annual 6 percent loss rate,
     which equals .0164 percent per day, results in a dilution
     of approximately one fourth of one part per million of
     carbon dioxide per day in Biosphere 2.  Dempster had first
     presented his data and methodology at a meeting of the
     American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air
     Conditioning Engineers in Montebello, Calif., on Dec. 3,
     1991.

     Comparing the seal efficacy of Biosphere 2 with other
     closed life systems, Dempster noted that the Russian closed
     experiment BIOS3 had a measured yearly loss rate of 50
     percent while NASA's breadboard systems measured
     approximately 1,000 percent per year, making Biosphere 2 by
     far the most highly sealed closed life system ever built.

     In addition, these two other experiments were metal
     containers whereas Biosphere 2, while employing stainless
     steel for regions in contact with the earth, utilizes a
     structure comprised largely of glass panes.  By thus
     excluding the use of artificial light in favor of true
     photosynthesis, a total biospheric system response could be
     measured as well as effects on individual crops and plants.

     To understand the tightness of the Biosphere 2 seal
     compared to an ordinary well-designed building, a 12-foot
     by nine-foot by eight-foot- high closed office operating at
     the EPA minimum standard of 15 cubic feet per minute will
     have an annual air exchange of about 100,000 percent, or
     about 20,000 times greater.

     This environment will build up approximately 1,000 ppm of
     CO2, although over 30 percent of new American homes and
     offices operate at higher levels, according to the EPA.

     The leakage tests conducted inside Biosphere 2 from the
     Sept. 26 closure until December resulted in a one-time-only
     atmospheric loss of about 10 percent, above and beyond the
     small loss due to leakage.

     At the completion of these tests on Dec. 9, this amount was
     replaced so that Biosphere 2 could operate at its designed
     volume of air, an important vector in the operation of the
     facility because of its buffering effect.

     The extra air lost in the testing during the first few days
     OO 2-01                      Page 15                   4 Jan 1992


     following closure averaged about 1,500 ppm of CO2, so that
     the 10 percent replacement on Dec. 9 diluted the relative
     amount of CO2 in Biosphere 2 by approximately 110-120 ppm
     from the amount in the air when taken out.  This means that
     it will increase the biospheric effort to raise or lower
     the CO2 percentage by about 5 percent.

     The restoration of the lost air also added an absolute
     amount of 9.24 kilograms, or 20.4 pounds, of CO2 to the
     atmosphere.

     ''These tests demonstrate that Biosphere 2 is operating in
     a more than satisfactory manner as a sealed apparatus,''
     Dempster stated. ''Our impossible target aim was 1 percent,
     our management target aim was 10 percent and our scientific
     upper limit was 100 percent per year leakage rate,'' said
     Dempster.

     ''We have come in halfway between the impossible and our
     management targets. On the scientific side, the safety
     factor on the Biosphere 2 sealing is much more than an
     order of magnitude.''

     All the key factors -- CO2, ocean coral reef, plant growth,
     species survival, agricultural production and leak rate
     measurements -- show the Biosphere 2 system to be operating
     at or better than expected levels, in spite of one of the
     cloudiest seasons in the region's history.

     Cloud cover affects the amount of light available for
     oxygen-producing plants inside the experiment.  ''The most
     important thing has been the integrated response of the
     entire system,'' added Dempster.

     ''However, to make the exact calculations required, we had
     to be able to adjust to even such small amounts as a
     quarter of a part per million of carbon dioxide per day,
     which our leak rate has turned out to be.''

     PRATT & WHITNEY HIGH PRESSURE TURBOPUMPS SUCCESSFULLY
     TESTED AT NASA CENTER

     WEST PALM BEACH, FL (DEC. 20) PR NEWSWIRE - A pair of Pratt
     & Whitney designed high pressure turbopumps has been
     successfully tested in a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME)
     at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.

     OO 2-01                      Page 16                   4 Jan 1992


     The Dec. 17 test was a 1.5 second ignition test.   The
     turbopumps are expected to demonstrate full power operation
     on additional engine firings early next year.   The pumps
     deliver liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to
     the main combustion chambers of the Space Shuttle's three
     main engines.

     Originally, the NASA-sponsored program called for the
     development and flight qualification of a set of turbopumps
     that would be interchangeable with current pumps and have a
     55-mission life, or approximately 7.5 hours of operation.
     Declining resources recently forced NASA to defer the fuel
     turbopump certification program until after flight
     certification of the oxidizer pump.

     Additional oxygen turbopumps are being assembled for tests
     next year.   The program's production phase requires
     turbopumps to be delivered between 1993 and 1997.   The P&W
     oxidizer turbopump is planned to be used on Space Shuttle
     engines beginning in 1994.

     A P&W SSME oxidizer turbopump weighs the same as a V-8
     automobile engine but develops 28,000 horsepower and could
     empty a swimming pool in 60 seconds. Its main shaft rotates
     at 24,000 rpm, compared to 3,000 rpm for an automobile
     engine operating at 60 mph.   The maximum equivalent
     horsepower developed by the Shuttle's three main engines
     combined is over 37 million, and the energy released is the
     equivalent to the output of 23 Hoover dams.

     Pratt & Whitney's Government Engines & Space Propulsion
     (GESP) facility, headquartered near West Palm Beach, Fla.,

     ORIGINS OF MANY CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS ARE GENERALLY UNKNOWN

     SEATTLE (DEC. 18) UPI - Christmas trees, mistletoe and
     gift-giving are well- known holiday traditions, but their
     origins are generally unknown to most Americans who go
     along because ''that's the way it's always been done.''

     But it hasn't ''always been done'' that way and to
     investigate the origins of the holiday's traditions is to
     discover a fascinating part of American and European
     OO 2-01                      Page 17                   4 Jan 1992


     history.

     Though most Americans celebrate the holiday to varying
     degrees, few are aware that it wasn't until the middle of
     the 19th century that Christmas was accepted into American
     culture. During the 17th and 18th centuries, large groups
     of colonists vehemently objected to the celebration,
     calling it ''an abomination.''

     The Puritans believed church government should not sanction
     anything that couldn't be found in the scriptures. In 1659
     in Boston, anyone found observing the holiday was fined.

     But, still, the celebration was catching on.

     One influence may have been separation of church and state,
     established by the U.S. Constitution in 1791. Members of
     the Puritan and evangelical churches were less likely to
     oppose the celebration when it was no longer a symbol of
     the religious and political dominance of the Church of
     England.

     During the 19th century, secular interest in Christmas
     spread rapidly with an influx of German immigrants who
     celebrated Christmas as both a religious and folk occasion.

     The English colonists in America weren't accustomed to
     giving gifts, not even to the children. They did, however,
     give to servants and the poor, as part of their duty to
     God.

     Christmas presents were advertised sporadically in
     newspapers in the 1820s, but for the next half century,
     gifts were referred to as New Year's gifts or simply
     ''holiday'' gifts. The custom of gift-giving didn't catch
     on until the mid 19th century, when stores were a flurry of
     activity.

     While firecrackers and noise-making are largely associated
     with Independence Day and to a lesser extent New Year's
     Eve, the old- fashioned Christmas was a cacophony of guns,
     cannons and firecrackers.

     The practice of making noise dates back to the notion that
     loud sounds would frighten evil spirits thought to be
     rampant at the winter solstice - celebrated as the point
     when days started getting longer, the coming of spring and
     the renewal of life.

     In about 320 A.D., Rome decided to convert the pagan
     solstice celebration and the Mithraic (Persian) ''Birthday
     of the Unconquered Sun'' into something more suited to
     their purposes. Christians believed Jesus was born on the

     chosen and the observance became ''Birthday of the
     Unconquered Son.''

     Christmas traditions have deep roots in European folk
     customs. The yule log, virtually forgotten in today's
     celebrations, came from England. The log was brought home
     on Christmas Eve, placed in the fireplace, lit from a piece
     of the previous year's log and, to prevent bad luck, kept
     burning for 12 hours.

     The popularity of the Christmas tree grew out of the yule
     log. As legend has it, the first Christmas tree was cut by
     Martin Luther, who brought it home and decorated it with
     candles to imitate the stars in the sky above Bethlehem.

     The first national recognition of the Christmas tree custom
     in the United States came in 1856, when President Franklin
     Pierce decorated one at the White House.

     Originally, the ''tree of life'' was a tabletop model. It
     was decorated with apples, the symbol of man's fall, and
     sacramental wafers, the symbol of man's salvation.
     Eventually, the apples were replaced by glass balls, the
     wafers by cookies cut in the shape of stars, angels, or
     animals.

     The poinsettia is perhaps the most popular of the several
     plants widely used in today's Christmas decorating. The
     plant with bright red ''bracts'' was brought from Mexico by
     botanist and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Joel R. Poinsett.
     The ''flower of the Holy Night'' is believed to represent
     the flaming Star of Bethlehem.

     Holly, ivy and mistletoe are symbols of fertility. Though
     ivy is largely overlooked today, in old English carols ivy
     represents the female and holly represents the male. Both
     were thought to have healing powers.

     The legend of Santa Claus rose out of the story of St.
     Nicholas.

     Nicholas was born about 270 A.D. in what is now Turkey.
     Tales of his charitable life and miracle-working were
     passed on by word of mouth. He was considered the patron of
     children and this is thought to be the reason he became
     tied to Christmas.

     The written description of the Santa Claus we know today
     was created by Clement Moore, the New York scholar who
     penned ''The Night Before Christmas.'' The visual image was
     developed by illustrator Thomas Nast, a political
     cartoonist who created the Democrats' donkey and the
     Republicans' elephant.

     Nast first drew Santa Claus for a book of poems that
     included ''The Night Before Christmas.'' After the success
     of the book, he drew Santa each Christmas for ''Harper's
     Weekly.'' Children and adults alike eagerly awaited the
     drawings, which appeared in the magazine for 23 years.

     The appearance of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is quite
     new, having appeared on the scene in 1939. Rudolph was
     created for an advertising campaign of Montgomery Ward. The
     story was used as a ''giveaway'' item for the Christmas
     shopping season and it wasn't used again until 1946. In
     1949 the popular song was recorded by Gene Autry and Bing
     Crosby and it swept the country.

     USAIR IS LOOKING FOR 13 WINNERS FROM THE 1991 PSA SPACE AGE
     CONTEST

     LOS ANGELES (DEC. 23) PR NEWSWIRE - USAir is looking for 13
     third prize winners of the PSA 1991 Space Age Contest held
     20 years ago by Pacific Southwest Airlines.  The
     promotional contest required entrants to depict what they
     thought PSA's aircraft would look like in the (far off)
     year 1991.  Third prize winners received a certificate good
     for round-trips for two, anywhere PSA flies in the year
     1991, including the moon.

     R. Brooks Stover, a 23 year old Stanford student, won first
     place in the contest by drawing a double-fuselaged aircraft
     in which sections of the plane detach and serve as
     monorails.  He won an all- expense paid trip for four to
     Tahiti back in 1971.

     One of the 13 winners who has already been identified,
     Sonia Manzo recalled, "I remember that in 2nd or 3rd grade
     I thought 1991 would never arrive -- and now it's
     practically over!"  The PSA 1991 Space Age Contest third
     prize winners will all receive two round- trips anywhere on
     the USAir system.

     CROP GENETICS AND DU PONT FORM BIOINSECTICIDES ALLIANCE

     HANOVER, MD (DEC. 27) PR NEWSWIRE - Crop Genetics
     International (NASDAQ: CROP) and the Du Pont Company
     announced today the formation of an alliance for the joint
     commercialization of Insecticidal Virus Products or IVPs.
     These biological insecticides consist of naturally
     occurring organisms which infect and destroy targeted
     insects.  Du Pont and Crop Genetics said that they formed
     the alliance to develop, produce, formulate, and market a
     broad range of viruses for insect control.

     Crop Genetics will become the exclusive producer of virus
     products for the alliance and focus its InSTARx(TM)
     division on the low-cost production of IVPs. Du Pont will
     become the exclusive global distributor and marketer of
     IVPs for the alliance.  Both companies will jointly develop
     new IVPs.  Under the alliance agreement, Du Pont agreed to
     fund development of IVPs at Crop Genetics for up to $3.75
     million over the next two years. The two agricultural
     companies said they will share the profits from the

     alliance under a series of sale and supply agreements which
     will be negotiated as IVPs are developed.

     Frank W. Owen, global product manager for insecticides at
     Du Pont Agricultural Products said that the safety and
     effectiveness of IVPs have been known for years but that
     success of IVPs has been limited because of relatively high
     manufacturing costs.  "The production and purification
     methods created by Crop Genetics' InSTARx(TM) scientists
     hold the promise of permitting large scale production of a
     range of IVPs at competitive prices." Owen said, "The
     alliance will broaden Du Pont's product offering of
     biological insecticides and demonstrates a commitment by
     both companies to provide growers with effective,
     environmentally compatible products for integrated pest
     management programs."

     Crop Genetics International is developing biological

     pesticides systems to control insects, diseases, and weeds
     in agriculture and forestry.  The company's research is
     focused on the creation of novel crop protection products
     that are effective and compatible with the environment. The
     company's InSTARx division is developing low-cost
     manufacturing processes for viral insecticides; the
     company's X-tend(TM) group is focused on developing weed
     control systems that combine biological and synthetic
     herbicidal agents; its InCide(TM) technology is designed to
     use genetically-engineered plant inoculants to protect
     corn, rice, and other row crops from insects and fungi; and
     its Kleentek(R) business markets disease-free sugarcane
     seed.

     Du Pont is a diversified chemicals, energy and specialty
     products company. Du Pont markets agricultural products in
     125 countries, has production facilities on five continents
     and is one of the largest suppliers of crop protection
     products in the U.S., offering more than 60 insecticides,
     fungicides and herbicides.

The `Harvest' Continues
ANIMAL MUTILATION UPDATE
                           by Linda Moulton Howe

  In 1989, there were so many cattle mutilations in southern Idaho
that Bear Lake County Sheriff Brent Bunn told me, "We haven't seen
anything like this since the 1970s." Sheriff Bunn sent me 16
neatly-typed  "Investigation Reports" about cattle mutilations that
had taken place in his county between May and December. Over half
occurred in a remote valley called Nounan. Only eighty people live
there. Ranching is their main income source, and cattle are
precious. Disease and predators are old and well-understood
enemies.

  What descended on Nounan, Idaho in the summer and fall of 1989
was not understood-and it scared people. Bloodless and precise
cuts-that's what bothers people. Officer Gregg Athay wrote in his
mutilation report, "There were no visible signs of the cause of
death. It appeared that only the soft tissues (nose, lips and
tongue) were gone off the head and four nipples off the bag. Again
there was no blood on the hair and ground."

  No veterinarian report was made on that cow. But a month earlier,
Dr. Charles Merrell at the Bear Lake Animal Hospital examined a
dead Hereford cow. Dr. Merrell wrote after his examination:  "Some
time between approximately 8 p.m. (August 31, 1989) and 7 a.m. 1
September, the anus, vagina to include uterus and ovaries and all
four teats (one teat deeply incised, the others shallow cuts) were
removed by knife cuts around these tissues.  There were no signs of
injury and no blood to be found on the ground. " A neighbor,
Bernice Laughter, said she saw lights in that area about 2 a.m. on
September 1.

Disks reported

  Throughout the history of animal mutilations, since 1967, there
have been numerous eyewitness accounts of large, glowing disks or
"silent helicopters " over pastures where dead animals are later
found. One Waco, Texas rancher said he encountered two four-foot
tall, light green-colored  "creatures " with large, black, slanted
eyes, carrying a calf which was later found dead and mutilated. In
1983, a Missouri couple watched through binoculars as two small
beings in tight-fitting silver suits worked on a cow in a nearby
pasture. The alien heads were large and white in color. Nearby, a
tall, green-skinned "lizard man" stood glaring with eyes slit by
vertical pupils like a crocodiles's. Several hypnosis sessions with
various UFO abductees have produced information suggesting that the
alien intruders are using the tissues and blood fluids for genetic
experimentation and sustenance.

  One Missouri woman, who has experienced repeated encounters with
small grey beings that have large, black eyes, said the creatures
told her, "We use substances from cows in an essential biochemical
process for our survival." In the 1989 continuing harvest, over
half of the Idaho mutilations were young calves. One mutilated
calf, found December 24, north of Downey, Idaho, was found lying on
its back with the navel, rectum and genitals neatly cut out of the
steer's white belly. No blood was found anywhere. (See photo, p.
18.)   This steer calf was taken for an autopsy to Dr. Chris Oats,
D.V.M., at the Hawthorne Animal Hospital. Dr. Oats checked all the
vital organs and was unable to determine the cause of death. During
the autopsy, a sharp cut was found in the right chest area, and Dr.
Oats discovered that a main artery had been severed under the chest
wound.

  She was surprised that "the steer had lost a large amount of
blood, but [she] could not understand where it went to. " There was
no blood on the steer or on the ground. Dr. Oats also determined
that the steer had not been dragged by the neck or tied up around
the feet.

  Residents of southern Idaho weren't alone in their fear and con-
fusion about the mutilations. William Veenhuizen woke up on July
17, 1989 to find his finest cow mutilated about 100 yards from his
farmhouse in Maple Valley, Washington, southeast of Seattle. The
six-year-old female was due to calve in about three weeks. But
mutilators had cut away a smooth oval section of the cow's mouth,
removed a section of jaw with teeth, excised the tongue and cut out
the entire udder, vagina and rectal area. The calf was still inside
the belly.

 Something woke Mr. Veenhuizen up around I a.m. that day, he
remembers. He even put his shoes on and went outside, but he
couldn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. He was so upset
after the mutilation, he started keeping the rest of his animals
inside the barn.  "A neighbor said to me that coyotes did it," he
said, "but I said the coyotes don't have that sharp a knife."

 Other farms hit

  Bill Veenhuizen wasn't the only farmer in Maple Valley,
Washington having mutilation problems. On Sunday, November 11, two
female sheep were found with their sexual organs removed. The
Hicks-Raburn King County Police found small holes on the carcasses
that they concluded might be BB gun pellet wounds, but no pellets
were found.

Mystery technology

  Another major question: Had the blood been drained from all those
animals without cutting them? If alien life forms are responsible,
and blood is a fluid they need for sustenance, do the aliens have
a technology which can transfer molecules of blood from within a
living system and leave mysteriously dead animals behind having no
cuts at all: The same question might apply to the hundreds of wild
horses which were found dead in Nevada in 1989.

  In November, 1989, in Red Cloud, Nebraska, rancher Ron Bartels
found a large, 1,000 lb. Chianina cow dead and mutilated. The
Franklin County Sheriff Department investigated, and veterinarian
Carl Guthrie, D.V.M., was asked to do a necropsy. In his report, he
stated that a four-inch straight incision had been made over the
cervical trachea. Beyond that cut inside the animal, over eight
inches of trachea and esophagus had been surgically removed- "The
skin over the abdomen was removed in a clear, demarcated line-no
musculature disturbed," he noted. And the rectum and vagina were
cored out.

Predators discounted

  Dr. Guthrie concluded:  "There were definite signs of suspicious
acts to the body of this cow-the nature in which the skin was
severed and removed was not characteristic of a predator strike."

  In addition to those cuts described by Dr. Guthrie, the neat
circular patch of skin removed around the cow's eye, along with the
eyeball, has been one of the hallmarks of animal mutilations since
the 1970s. Rancher Ron Bartels told me, ". . . after several days,
there had been no predation, and with the number of coyotes we now
have in this area, they completely strip a carcass very quickly."
But nothing touched the strangely cut cow.  How are the cuts made:
In my book An Alien Harvest, published in 1989, I show for the
first time that tissue gathered from mutilator cuts in Arkansas on
March 11, 1989, revealed the following characteristics under
microscopic examination:
1) The line is pinpoint thin;
2) The line was subjected to high heat, probably 300 degrees
Fahrenheit or above, leaving a hard and darkened edge;
3) The cuts were made rapidly, probably in two minutes or less,
because there is no inflammatory cell destruction which typically
begins in a few minutes after any trauma to tissue
(See contrasting photomicrographs).

  In addition to the 1989 mutilation reports in Idaho, Washington,
Nebraska and Arkansas, there have been other cases in Colorado,
Oklahoma, Missouri and Florida. Further, over 800 wild horses in
Nevada have died mysteriously, about 70 domestic cats have been
found dead and bloodlessly mutilated in Tustin, California and 30
more cats in the East Bay of San Francisco. A city employee in
Setauket, Long Island, NY, has reported to me that about a dozen
raccoons, opossums, dogs and cats have been found in Percy Rayner
bloodlessly mutilated with cuts similar to cows. I have also
received calls about mutilations in Canada, but have no firm
photographs or reports.

  After An Alien Harvest was released in June of 1989, I received
a letter from a security guard in Denver, Colorado. He described a
night in August when he was patrolling the grounds of a large
corporation west of the city. From his truck, he could see a large
circle of lights in the dark sky. The lights remained stationary
over a pasture a few hundred feet from the security guard. He was
afraid to report the unidentified flying objects, because UFOs
meant ridicule and he didn't want to lose his job. But he felt
guilty about not reporting it, because the next morning he watched
a farmer gather up a couple of dead and mutilated cows from the
pasture where the lights had hovered overhead. He asked me, "What
kind of technology are we talking about? I never took my eyes off
those lights. There was no beam, no sound, nothing. How did they do
it?"

  That's a question which has haunted ranchers and law enforcement
since the first worldwide reported mutilation of a horse in 1967.
Not only how-but why? If alien life forms are intruding on this
planet and harvesting from animals and humans, is a program of
genetic experimentation and sustenance the answer? Or only part of
a larger alien need? Will the 1990s finally bring humans face to
face with an alien intelligence that has secretly used earth life
for eons? As we become more conscious of its presence, will we
learn that the alien intent is simply to survive without human
help? Or is there some larger and more complex alien scheme which
could challenge the future of human existence?

Seismicity Report for Northern California,
the Nation, and the World for the week of
 December 12 - 18, 1991

San Francisco Bay Area

    Seismicity  remained low throughout the Bay Area during the past 7
days.  Once again, the creeping section of the San Andreas was the most
active with minor activity along the Calaveras fault system in the East
Bay.  The most notable earthquake of the past week was a M2.7 event that
occurred Tuesday morning  on the Hayward fault about 3 miles northwest of
Berkeley.  It was felt in the immediate area.
    During the 7-day period ending at midnight on Wednesday, December 18,
1991 the U.S. Geological Survey office in Menlo Park recorded 23
earthquakes of magnitude one (M1) and greater within the San Francisco
Bay area shown in Figure 1.  Four were as large as M2 including one M3.2
event along the San Andreas fault, about 13 miles southeast of Hollister
(#1/1).  This compares to 21 earthquakes greater than M1 that were
recorded during the previous 7-day period, only one of which was as large
as M2.0.

Northern California

     Seismicity also remained at low levels throughout the rest of northern
California during the past week.  The only exception to this was a pair of
M3 events that occurred early Sunday morning in the central Gorda Plate
about 110 miles offshore of Crescent City (#3/2).  Both events occurred in
the same vicinity as an active sequence last August that included two M6
earthquakes and a number of M4 aftershocks.  Neither of the recent M3
events was reported felt.
     A pair of M2 earthquakes occurred near the Cape Mendocino triple
junction later in the week (#8/2), both in the vicinity of the Petrolia
earthquake swarm that shook this area in mid-August.  A M2.2 earthquake
occurred last Saturday evening in the southern Cascades, 19 miles north of
Lassen Peak (#2/2).  Two M2 earthquakes occurred in this same location on
December 11.
     In eastern California, two M2.3 earthquakes occurred beneath the
northwest shore of Mono Lake on Monday (#5/2).  Both were probably
aftershocks to a M5.7 earthquake that occurred here on October 23, 1990 and
that was felt as far away as San Francisco.
     The creeping segment of the San Andreas fault was somewhat more active
than it has been in recent weeks with activity seen at both the north and
south ends.  Several M2 earthquakes occurred at the north end between
Paicines and Bitterwater, the largest a M2.7 event on Saturday morning
(#1/2).  Slack Canyon, at the south end, produced a M2.6 event Monday
evening (#6/2).  The next adjacent segment to the south, the Parkfield
segment, was also active, with a M2.6 earthquake occurring beneath the
Middle Mountain area 6 miles northwest of the town of Parkfield (#9/2).

Long Valley Caldera

     The only earthquake of note in the Long Valley caldera was a M2.9
event that occurred Sunday evening in the southeast corner of the caldera,
near the northern end of the Hilton Creek fault (#2/3).  This was the area
that was most active during the previous week, having produced six M 2
earthquakes and a number of smaller events.
     Two M1 earthquakes occurred at the west end of the south moat, about
two miles southeast of Mammoth Lakes.  Several M1 earthquakes occurred in
the Sierra Nevada terrane south of the caldera.

USA Seismicity

    The National Earthquake Information Center recorded one notable
earthquake within the contiguous United States during the past week, a M2.8
event that occurred last Friday morning in northeastern Arkansas (#1/4).
This is part of the New Madrid Seismic zone that stretches across the
central Mississippi Valley and produced three M7 earthquakes during the
years 1811-1812.

 The Planet Earth

     The most active zone worldwide during the past week was in the Kuril
Island region of the western Pacific (#2/5).   After producing several M5
earthquakes during the previous reporting period (see last week's summary),
the Kurils were rocked by four M6 earthquakes during the past week, the
largest a M6.6 event early Thursday morning (UTC).  A total of 17
earthquakes of M5.0 or larger have occurred here within the past week.
      Elsewhere in the world there was a M5.6 earthquake in the New Britain
region (#1/5), a M5.3 on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao (#3/5),
a M5.1 in the northern Argentinean province of Jujuy (#4/5), a M5.6 in
southern Peru just west of Lake Titicaca (#5/5), and a M5.5 along the
spreading ridge offshore of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (#6/5).

Notes: Origin time in the list is in GMT, in the text and on maps
       it is in local time.
       N RD: is the number of readings used to locate the event.
       N S: is the number of S waves in N RD.
       RMS SEC: is the root mean squared residual misfit for the
                location is seconds, the lower the better, over 0.3
                to 0.5 seconds is getting bad, but this is machine,
                not hand timed, data.
       ERH: is the estimated horizontal error in kilometers.
       ERZ: is the estimated vertical error in kilometers.
       N FM: is the number of readings used to compute the magnitude.
       REMKS: obtuse region codes that denote the velocity model
              used to locate the event.
       DUR MAG: is the magnitude as determined from the duration of
                the seismograms, not the amplitude.  Sort of like
                going to echo canyon and measuring how loud your
                yell is by counting echos.
       FIG: denotes the figure/event number in the maps posted separately.
