SUBJECT: BULF BREEZE, FLORIDA SIGHTING REPORT                FILE: UFO1323


LOG # 890911 - Event 08/23/89 in Gulf Breeze, Florida.  Investigators Carol
and Rex Salisberry.  Two women in their driveway observed a "silver" or
"white" delta shaped object (estimated 70 feet per side) pass low and almost
directly overhead.  On the leading apex was a globe or cluster of white
lights 12-16 feet in diameter.  Globes or clusters of red were at the other
apexes.  Three lights-one white and two red- followed closely behind.  After
trying to follow in their car, the women drove to a friends home.  There,
they saw the same or similar object and lights pass nearby.  This time, two
independent lights (now pulsating) led the vehicle as it moved slowly out of
sight.  Again they tried unsuccessfully to follow.
