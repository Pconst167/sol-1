                 SPEISER  SIGHTING  REPORT  CLASSIFICATIONS
                ____________________________________________


This is likewise a two-part classification, with an escalating scale from one 
to five within each.  The "Strangeness Factor", rather than ranking by 
distance or supporting evidence, rates cases as definitely, probably or 
possibly explainable as well as strange or highly strange.

The SPEISER "Probability Factor" concentrates on the creditability of the 
witness(es) as honest individuals and accurate observers, with ratings from 
"not credible" to "highly credible".  See the April, 1987 issue of the 
Journal for Mr. Speiser's explanation of this grading method.
