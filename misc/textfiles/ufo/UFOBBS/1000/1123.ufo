SPECTACULAR EVENT TRANSMITTED DIRECTLY BY A RADIO STATION - UFO FLEET
LANDED IN FRONT OF WITNESSES
 
Cordoba, Argentina, March 13 (AFP) - Four UFOs landed in the early
hours of this morning in a hilly area of Cordoba province, and many
witnesses are on the spot watching the phenomenon, which is being
transmitted directly by a local radio station.
 
The UFOs "have a big white light on one side and a red one on the
other side," said the reporter who went to the landing place.  The
Cordoba radio station (located 710 kilometers to the north of Buenoa
Aires) interrupted its program at 03.10 GMT to transmit the news and
describe "enormous saucers with intense red and white lights that
came out of its windows."
 
A few minutes later a direct transmission was made from the La Cruz
hill, which is located some 5 kilometers from the Uritorco hill (160
kilometers NW of Cordoba) where the UFOs landed.
 
A reporter said that one of the objects "took off and approached the
place where the group of observers was, scaring us a bit." He also
added that the craft remained "motionless for several hours."  The
transmission continued at 11.15 GMT and the reporter said that a group
formed by several UFO fans, three photographers and a nurse were
accompanying him.
