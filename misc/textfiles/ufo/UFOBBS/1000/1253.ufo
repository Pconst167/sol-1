SUBJECT: MEMPHIS TENNESSEE SIGHTING REPORT                   FILE: UFO1253


CASE # 10-?67TN - Location: Memphis.  Lead Investigator: John Komar, SD.
     This is a additional report from a case mentioned in a previous issue
of this newsletter.  Four friends, while playing golf in Douglas Park,
noticed an object in the sky just east of their position on the golf course.
Since the object was unknown to them, the four witnesses sat atop a small
hill and watched the object for approximately 15 minutes.  Following is a
statement from the witness;

     "It seemed to be aware that we were watching it, and moved off to the
      northeast at a high rate of speed, until it was
      barely visible."  "Then it returned to the same position [in the sky]
      over a chemical plant just to the east of
      Douglas Park, at an even higher rate of speed!"

     "It's flight pattern was erratic climbs, dips, and hesitations.  All
      movements were abrupt and extremely tight, kind of
      like square turns, climbs and dips."  "It hovered over the chemical
      plant for a few more seconds. then it left at
      such a high rate of speed that it was impossible to track."

     The object was reported to be round, about 30 feet in diameter, silvery
colored and opaque.
