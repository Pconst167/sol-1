SPECIAL RELEASE: PARANET
MEMBER DEBUNKS VATICAN STORY

      ParaNet  Alpha  12/05  --  Contrary to a published story, there is no 
evidence  that the Vatican has any plans to send missionaries into space to 
convert extraterrestrials to Catholicism, says a respected UFO researcher.

      The  story, which originally appeared in the London _Evening News_ in 
July,  claimed  that  a Fr. Pierre Thorel of the Vatican University had set 
up  a program to train missionaries to preach the Gospel to any aliens that 
may  be  encountered in space ventures. The story was later sent to the UFO 
Newsclipping Service by British Ufologist Timothy Good.

      But  John  Andrews, Vice President of Testors Corporation and a Para-
Net  member  in San Diego, says the story is bogus. "I contacted the editor 
of  a regional Catholic Magazine," says Andrews, "who contacted the Cathol-
ic Media Office in New York."

      "They  had  heard  of  the  story.  Apparently there is no Fr. Pierre 
Thorel,  there  is no new Chair at the Alfonsian Academy in Rome, and there 
is no effort to develop 'missionaries in space.'"

      Andrews,  a  pro-UFO  researcher  whose  stated goal is to market the 
first  authorized  plastic model of a genuine flying saucer, says the story 
had  him  fooled  as much as anyone. "I, too, was taken in...but only for a 
little while.

      "It proves the reason to verify whatever we hear."
