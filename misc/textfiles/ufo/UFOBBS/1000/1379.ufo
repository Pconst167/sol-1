SKY-GAZERS MISTAKE PLANETS FOR UFOS

      Visitors from another planet have nothing to do with the UFOs which
were reported along the lake shore Friday and Saturday nights. But,
according to the Coast Guard, the planets Jupiter and Venus are involved.
      When the US Coast Guard at Fairport Harbor received reports Friday
night of UFOs in the sky, it checked with area airports to learn what
their radar indicated.
      "We thought it might be someone in trouble setting off flares," said
Petty Officer John Knaub. "So we investigated ourselves."
      Coast Guard members saw the lights over the lake about 1/4 mile east
of the mouth of the Chagrin River. "But Lost Nation Airport advised us
that we were seeing the planets Jupiter and Venus, which are lined up
together in the sky. Apparently the gases in the atmosphere created the
appearance of smaller objects around them."
      The UFO reports rolled in again Saturday night, when the sky
remained clear and was dominated by a full moon.
      Knaub said the phenomena is visible around 9PM, as skygazers look
west along the lake from Fairport Harbor.
