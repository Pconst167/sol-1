The following is information about the Society for Scientific Exploration,
it's journal, and the upcoming annual SSE meeting (Jun 24-26) in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

========================================================================

The Society for Scientific Exploration (SSE) was founded in 1980 to advance
the understanding of anomalous phenomena and provide a forum where scientists
with differing belief systems can meet to exchange ideas concerning 
phenomena that appear to contradict existing scientific knowledge.  The
Reverend Ian Stand in his "High Weirdness by Mail" describes the SSE as
"repulsively academic ... just what eggheads, long-hairs and career college 
students have been looking for."  But in reality, the SSE is a dynamic
organization of almost 400 members that publishes the peer-reviewed quarterly
Journal of Scientific Exploration and holds an annual meeting.  The group is
definitely NO CSICOP.  Many SSEers belong to the Parapsychological
Association and the American Society for Psychical Research, as well as
mainstream organizations like the American Statistical Association, the
American Chemical Society, etc.  It is a forum where all kinds of views can 
be heard without censorship.

           UPCOMING MEETING OF SOCIETY FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION


    The Twelfth Annual Meeting of the Society for Scientific Exploration
    will be held at the Best Western Inn at Loretto in Santa Fe, New Mexico
    June 24 - 26, 1993.  Local arrangements have been made by SSE members
    Dr. John Alexander and Dr. Larry Dossey.  Any Associate or Member of
    SSE is entitled to present a paper at this meeting.

    The Program Committee for this year's meeting consists of Henry Bauer,
    Brenda Dunne, Michael Epstein, Beverly Rubik, and Michael Swords
    (chair).  The Committee has structured this meeting to be both
    educational and entertaining.  We plan to cover two areas of great
    current interest.  One is the so-called Mind-Body interactions with
    implications for health, placebo effects, psychoneuroimmunology, and
    bio-electromagnetism.  The other comprises UFO phenomena, especially
    concrete evidence, physical effects, and abductions.  These subjects
    will be the twin themes of the conference, with talks on these topics
    dominating two of the three days.  A tentative list of invited speakers
    includes:  Robert Ader, Larry Dossey, Beverly Rubik, Harry Rubin, and
    Jan Walleczek for mind-body topics, and John Alexander, Richard Haines,
    Donald Johnson, Mark Rodeghier, and Don Schmitt for UFO topics.

    To encourage in-depth discussion, the talks and panel discussions will
    have significant amounts of question time.  To allow other SSE members
    to present papers on their own research, the Program Committee has
    decided to create what they hope will prove an attractive format for a
    poster session, to be held in concert with a wine-and-cheese reception.

    An excursion to an "exotic" setting will be scheduled:  either the Los
    Alamos Supercomputer facility or the ancient Anasazi Pueblo ruins near
    Santa Fe.  Cocktails and a banquet are scheduled for Friday evening.
    SSE Associates and Members are encouraged to contribute papers for
    possible oral or poster presentation.  Please submit an abstract (of
    200 words or less, to be received by April 24) to the Program Committee
    Chair:  Dr. Michael Swords; Department of Science Studies; Western
    Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI 49008.

    To obtain your registration material please contact Professor Larry
    Frederick at Society for Scientific Exploration, P.O. Box 3818,

ABOUT THE JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION:

    The JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION publishes peer-reviewed research
    articles and invited essays in areas that do not fit neatly into the
    matrix of present-day science.  Now in it's 6th year of publication,
    this quarterly journal provides a professional forum for the
    presentation, scrutiny and criticism of topics falling outside the
    established scientific disciplines.  JSE publishes articles both "pro"
    and "con", the only criteria being quality and scholarship.  It is the
    official publication of the international Society for Scientific
    Exploration (founded in 1982).  For information contact:
