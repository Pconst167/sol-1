SECRET US AIRPLANE FLIES 5,280 MPH
BRITISH MILITARY-AFFAIRS JOURNAL SAYS
 
London--
   The US Air Force is operating a new generation of secret spy 
planes capable of reaching eight times the speed of sound, "Jane's 
Defense Weekly" said Friday.
   In a report prepared for next week's issues, the military-affairs 
magazine said the triangular-shaped planes have been in service 
since 1989.
   "We've been working on this report for about three years," Jane's 
editor, Paul Beaver said in a telephone interview.  "The evidence 
has grown overwhelming-all we need now is a photograph to prove that 
it exists."
   Beaver quoted the report as saying the $1 billion plane, dubbed 
Aurora, could reachcruising speeds of Mach-8  - or 5,280 mph, more 
than 2 1/2 times the official world record.
   The defense establishment continues to deny the existence of 
Aurora, he said.
   Chris Hudson, 30, a trained aircraft observer, told Jane's that 
while working as an oil-drilling engineer in the North Sea in 1989 
he saw a bizarre wedge shaped plane flying between two F-111 
fighter-bombers and a Hercules tanker.
