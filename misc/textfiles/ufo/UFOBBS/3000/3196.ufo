                   UFO SIGHTINGS OF THE STARS

              By David Wallechinsky and Amy Wallace

     A 1987 Gallup poll determined that about one person in 10 has
seen an unidentified flying object.  As reported in the press and
in works such as Margaret Sachs' "The UFO Encyclopedia," even some
celebrities and politicians have seen them.

1.   Muhammad Ali:  The boxer says he has seen several UFOs,
including a cigar-shaped one over the New Jersey Turnpike and one,
"like a huge electric light bulb," in Central Park.

2.   Jimmy Carter:  The former president reported having seen a UFO
in 1969.  The light was later determined to have been the planet
Venus.

3.   Jamie Farr:  A zigzagging light over the desert sands near
Yuma, Arizona, made a believer out of the actor in the 1960s.  The
object stopped in the air, hovered, and kept pace with his car
before disappearing.

4.   Glenn Ford:  A blue-green, disk-shaped object about 500 feet
in diameter was spotted by the actor in 1974 near his California
beach house.

5.   Jackie Gleason:  Gleason saw UFOs in London and in Florida. 
The comedian claimed that a U.S. government official admitted that
UFOs exist.

6.   Dick Gregory:  In 1967 at Big Sur, Gregory and his friends saw
three lights (one red, two green) that performed maneuvers for 40
minutes.

7.   Warren Oates:  In 1975, in the desert near Palm Springs, the
actor and four friends saw an oval-shaped UFO with flashing colored
lights.

8.   William Shatner:  Shatner, of "Star Trek" fame, was on a
motorcycle trip in the Mojave Desert when his bike stalled.  He
pushed it along in the blistering heat and was near exhaustion when
he noticed a silvery craft above him.  An unspoken message told him
the direction to go for help.
