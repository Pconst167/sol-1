The following transcript comes from a lecture made by Jerome Clark in
Australia, sometime in September of 1991.
 
==========================================================================
 
                              INTRODUCTION
 
...Much of what I am going to tell you is not true. I want to emphasise
this much. Simply by repeating what someone has reported as true, does not
mean I endorse it as true. What we're concerned with here is the anatomy of
a modern legend in the making.
 
When I know or have specific reasons to suspect that something is a
fabrication, I'll say so.  Otherwise I'll just recount stories whose
tellers may or may not believe what they're saying. But here even the lies
are interesting, because the liar's motives sometimes raise questions which
bear on the larger issue of what some have called The Ultimate Secret.
 
At the end of our exercise, we'll have few answers and many questions.
Probably - though far short of certainly - some of these questions will
have to do with our role as a planet and a race in a galaxy populated by
intelligent beings with an advanced space technology - possibly.
 
More certainly, we're dealing with another deep and human enigma, the
mystery of the human imagination as  it contemplates our place in the
cosmos.  If we are being led here by our own imagination, it has taken us
down some strange and dark paths indeed.
 
Whatever the truth may be at the end of the road, I can't take you
directly to its door and drop you off there. All I can provide you with
are brief, imperfect, vexing glances of "something" - a something that may
be a kind of truth - literal or metaphorical - or just the lie inside the
lie.  I can, however, tell you a story which, if it is in any way a
reflection of a cosmic reality, is going to affect all of us in the
profoundest possible way...
 
...In September, 1980, shortly after William Moore and Charles Berlitz's
book 'The Roswell Incident' was published, Moore, who then lived in
Arizona, set out for Washington .D.C. to attend a debate at the Smithsonian
Institution.
 
Now, along the way, Moore did publicity interviews to plug his book. One
of these was at an Omaha, Nebraska radio station .  Subsequently, as he was
leaving his hotel room, a receptionist in the lobby told him he had a phone
call.  The caller, who identified himself as a Colonel at nearby Offutt
(sp) Air Force base, said, according to Moore, "We think you're the only
one we've heard who seems to know what he's talking about."  He asked if
the two could meet to discuss matters further.  Moore, who was on his way
to catch a plane, begged off.
 
A few days later, on his way home, Moore did a radio show in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. On his way out of the studio, he was stopped to take a phone
call; this one from someone who said he was from nearby Kirtland Air Force
Base. He said " We think you're the only one we've heard who seems to know
what he's talking about."  And Moore said, 'Where have I heard that
before?'
 
Soon afterwards, Moore and the individual he would call 'Falcon', met at a
local restaurant.  It is believed, though Moore denies it, that 'Falcon' is
US Air Force sergeant Richard Doty.  Whoever Falcon may or may not have
been, this first meeting would initiate a long-running relationship between
Moore, and beginning in 1982, Moore's associate, Jamie Shandera, with
members of a shadowy group said to be associated with Military
Intelligence, and to be opposed to the continuation of the UFO cover-up.
This relationship, Moore claims, continues to this day and involves
something like thirty to forty individuals who have been given avian
nicknames such as Sparrow, Condor and so on.  Collectively they are called
"The Birds."
 
The story they have told Moore and Shandera goes like this:-
 
''The first UFO crash involving bodies of small gray-skinned humanoids,
occurred near Corona, New Mexico, in 1947. This is "The Roswell Incident".
Two years later, a humanoid was found alive and it was housed at Los
Alamos, a highly sensitive installation where the Atomic Bomb was
developed, until the creature died in the early 1950s.  It was called
'EBE' after Extra-terrestrial Biological Entity, and it was the first of
three the US Government would have in its custody between then and now.
 
''An Air Force Captain was EBE-One's constant companion.  At first
communication with it was almost impossible.  Then a speech device which
enabled the being to speak in English, was implanted in its throat. Then
EBE-One, the equivalent of a mechanic on the spaceship, was able to relate
what it knew of the nature and purpose of the visitation.
 
''In response to the Roswell Incident, MJ-12 - the MJ stands for
'Majestic' - was set up by Executive Order of President Harry Truman on
September 24th, 1947.  MJ-12 operates as a policy-making body. Project
Aquarius is an umbrella group in which all the various components dealing
with ET-related issues perform their various functions.  Project Sigma
conducts electronic communication with the extra-terrestrials, part of an
on-going contact project run through the National Security Agency since
1964, following a landing at Holloman Air Force Base on April 30th, 1964.
 
''Nine extra-terrestrial races are visiting the earth.  One of these races
- little grey-skinned people from the third planet surrounding Zeta
Reticuli - have been here for 25,000 years and influenced the direction of
human evolution.  They have also helped shape our religious beliefs.
 
''Some important individuals within the cover-up want it to end, and are
preparing the American people for the reality of the alien presence through
the vehicle of popular entertainment, including the film, 'Close Encounters
of The Third Kind,' whose climax is a thinly-disguised version of the
Holloman landing.
 
''At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, there is a thick book
informally called "The Bible: a compilation of all the various project
reports.''
 
As Moore was being fed these incredible tales, for which, it should be
noted, not a shred of real, verifying evidence was being offered, and about
which even Moore had doubts, he was asked to monitor the activities of a
man named Paul Bennewitz.
 
Bennewitz, an Albuquerque business man trained as a physicist, lived close
to Kirtland Air Force Base.  In the late 1970s, he became convinced that he
was monitoring electronic signals which extra-terrestrials were using to
control the persons they had abducted. Bennewitz tried to decode these
signals and believed he was succeeding.  At the same time he began to see
what he thought were UFOs manoeuvering around the Manzano nuclear storage
facility, in the Coyote Canyon test area, and he filmed them.
 
Bennewitz reported as much to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization,
whose directors concluded he was deluded. Undeterred, Bennewitz contacted
AFOSI agent, Richard Doty, -- the individual who as we have just noted, is
rumoured to be Moore's FALCON -- after having been referred to him by the
head of Kirtland's base security. Bennewitz met on two occasions with Doty
and others from Kirtland, including Jerry Miller, a well-placed scientist
at Kirtland, who is suspected of being another of Moore's 'Birds'.
 
By now Bennewitz had seized upon a dark, paranoia-driven interpretation. He
became convinced that he had deciphered the code the signals were
conveying, and they indicated the US Government was communicating with ETs
and was looking the other way as these ETs not only abducted human beings,
but killed and mutilated them.
 
What makes the Bennewitz affair so horrifying, however, is not the
spectacle of yet another deluded UFO buff. The importance of the incident
lies in the response of the Kirtland AFOSI office.
 
Now, I should explain that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations,
is the Air Force's police agency.  It conducts investigations, for example,
into security matters.
 
AFOSI agents began a blatantly illegal counter-intelligence operation
against Bennewitz because something he had learned really scared them. The
electronic signals, whatever they were truly about, were quite rea1 and
highly classified.
 
The plot was hatched to drive Bennewitz crazy in the most commonly
understood sense of the term.
 
AFOSI agents went to his house and confided what they said were the UFO
cover-up's darkest secrets.  They said the US Government and malevolent
aliens are in an uneasy alliance, that the aliens are mutilating human
beings, whose organs they need to lengthen their lives, and that they are
even eating human flesh.  In underground bases at Government installations
in Nevada and New Mexico, human and alien scientists work together on
ghastly experiments, including the creation of soul-less androids out of
human and animal body parts. Aliens are abducting as many as one American
in forty and implanting devices which control behaviour.  CIA brainwashing
and other control techniques are doing the same, turning life on Earth into
a nightmare of violence and irrationality. It was, as Moore would remark,
"The wildest science fiction scenario anyone could imagine."
 
But Bennewitz believed it.  He grew ever more obsessed, and tried to alert
prominent persons to the imminent peril.  As evidence, he produced
photographs which he claimed showed human-alien activity, but which
dispassionate observers thought depicted natural rock formations and other
mundane phenomena. Meanwhile, AFOSI agents were breaking into Bennewitz's
home when he was away at work, and re-arranging his furniture, so that
every evening he returned - inexplicably to him - to a new environment.
Badly distraught already, he was driven even further into the outer reaches
of paranoia. Eventually he was hospitalized.
 
All the while, Moore was meeting with him regularly, watching his, quote,
unquote, "friend's growing disintegration" and reporting his observations
to his quote, unquote "Friends at AFOSI."
 
This was not the first UFO hoax in which Richard Doty has been implicated.
Another - going back to 1978 - involved the mailing of an apparent carbon
copy of an offical US Air Force incident report to a tabloid newspaper.
The incident report described an encounter with UFO beings in the atomic
weapons area of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.  The tabloid sent
reporters to the area to investigate, and they concluded the report was
a hoax. At the time, Doty was assigned to the AFOSI office at Ellsworth.
Since then, Moore has identified Doty as among those responsible.
 
Another Doty-related hoax involved a letter sent to the Lorenzens of APRO
and signed by Craig Wetzell (sp) recounting a UFO sighting over Kirtland
Air Force Base.  Supposedly, Wetzell had taken photographs and these were
later confiscated by a Mr Huck from Sandia Laboratories which are located
on the base.  Wetzell is a real person who, when interviewed some time
later, said he had had a sighting, though a less dramatic one than detailed
in the letter, but had taken no photographs and knew nothing of a Mr Huck.
But he had reported the sighting to Sgt. Doty.
 
In January, 1983, a New York attorney, Peter Gersten, met with Doty in New
Mexico. Doty swore the Ellsworth story was true. He said the government
knows that UFOs are extra-terrestrial and [are] from 50 light-years from
the Earth. There had been at least three UFO crashes with bodies.  A
spectacular incident, much like the one depicted in the ending of the film
'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind' took place in the 1960s. The National
Security Agency is communicating electronically with ETs through a project
Aquarius.  Inside the UFO organizations, moles are collecting information
and spreading disinformation.  The most sensitive cover-up documents are
impossible to get out of the appropriate files. Some are protected in such
a way that they will disintegrate within five seconds exposure to air.
 
These documents tell of agreements between the US Government and
extra-terrestrials under which the latter are free to conduct animal
mutilations - especially of cattle - and to land at certain bases. All of
this is in exchange for information about advanced UFO technology.  Doty
also claimed that through the medium of popular entertainment, the American
people are being prepared to accept the reality of visitation by benevolent
beings from other worlds. At one point in the conversation, Doty asked
Gersten, quoting, "How do you know that I'm not here to either give you
misinformation, or to give you information which is part of the
programming, knowing you're going to go out and spread it around?"
 
In March 1983, a documentary film-maker from Denver, Colorado, Linda
Moulton-Howe was laying plans for a show to be titled "UFOs: The ET
Factor" and to be aired on Home Box Office, a cable television network.
Gersten arranged for her to meet with Doty and she flew to Albuquerque on
April 9th.  Though he was supposed to meet her there, Doty was not at the
airport, and Howe ended up calling Jerry Miller, whom she knew from an
earlier telephone conversation when she'd asked him what he thought of
Bennewitz's claims.  Miller drove her to his house and phoned Doty who then
arrived. Doty in turn drove her to what he described as 'his boss's office'
at Kirtland.  Asked if he knew anything about the Holloman landing, Doty
said it happened, but that Emenegger had gotten the date wrong; it really
took place on April 25th, 1964 --  now note, this is the _third_ date we've
heard for this alleged event -- and it had taken place twelve hours after
the famous Socorro landing witnessed by police officer Zamora. Military
and scientific personnel at the base knew a landing was coming but quote
"Someone blew the time and co-ordinates" end quote, and a quote, unquote,
"advanced military scoutship" had come down at the wrong time and place
to be observed by Zamora.  When three UFOs appeared at Holloman at six
o'clock the following morning, one landed while the other two hovered
overhead.  During the meeting between the UFO-beings and a Government
party, the preserved bodies of dead aliens had been given to the ETs who,
in turn, had returned something unspecified. Five ground and aerial
cameras recorded this event.
 
Doty insisted that Howe sit in a particular chair.  This led her to
believe their exchange was being recorded.  At one point Doty withdrew
several sheets of paper from a brown envelope and said "My superiors have
asked me to show you this." She could not copy their contents, she could
only read them and ask questions.  The document didn't indicate which, if
any, government, military or scientific agency had prepared the report,
which was titled 'A Briefing Paper For the President of the United States
On the Subject of Unidentified Flying Vehicles.' It did not specify which
president.
 
Written in a dry, bureaucratic sort of prose, it recounted the stories
we've already reviewed: UFOs have crashed since 1949; three EBEs have been
kept in US Government custody; through genetic manipulation aliens have
guided our evolution and helped direct our religious beliefs; various
ultra secret government projects have dealt with aspects of the
visitation... Doty told Howe she would be given thousands of feet of
film of crashed disks, bodies, EBE-One and the Holloman landing and
contact.  She could use this material in her documentary to tell the
story of how US officals learned that the Earth is being visited and what
they have done about it. "We want you to do this film," Howe quotes Doty
as saying.
 
When Howe asked why she, and not the 'New York Times' or the 'Washington
Post' was getting this, the story of the millenium, Doty replied bluntly
that an individual media person is easier to manipulate and discredit than
a major corporation with expensive attorneys. He said that another plan to
release the information through Emenegger and Sandler had been halted
because political conditions weren't right.   Over the next several weeks,
Howe had a number of phone conversations with Doty and she spoke on several
occasions with three other men, but did not meet them personally. Doty
even suggested that at some point she might be able to conduct a live,
televised interview with EBE-Three, but the current film project was to
have an historical emphasis -- it would begin in 1949 and end in 1964. But
if at some point Howe did meet with EBE-Three, there was no way she could
prepare herself for the shock and fear of meeting a live being from another
world.  Doty told Howe, she and a small crew would soon be able to
interview the retired Colonel - who was then a Captain - who had spent
three years with EBE-One who supposedly had died of unknown causes in June,
1952.  But first she was going  to have to go through a whole bunch of
security checks, as was her television crew.  But by October the contacts
had decreased. Her contract to do the documentary expired, and all she had
was the name of her Washington contact.  In March 1984, she spoke with this
man who told her that there would be further delays because of the 1984
presidential election.  Five years later, Bill Moore gave this explanation
of this bizarre episode:
 
Quoting Moore: "In early 1983, I became aware that Rick Doty was involved
with a team of several others, including one fellow from Denver, and at
least one who is working out of Washington, D.C., in playing an elaborate
disinformation scheme against Howe."
 
According to Moore, the episode was a counter-intelligence sting operation,
part of the wall of disinformation intended to confuse the Bennewitz issue
and to call his credibility into question. "Because of Howe's interest in
Bennewitz's work," Moore said, quoting again, "certain elements within the
intelligence community were concerned that the story of his having
intercepted low-frequencey, electro-magnetic emissions from the Coyote
Canyon area of the Kirtland-Sandia complex would end up as part of a
feature film. Since this, in turn, might influence others - possibly the
Russians - to attempt similar experiments, someone in a control position
apparently felt that it had to be stopped before it got out of hand." Moore
said, quoting again, "The government seemed hell-bent on severing the ties
that existed between Howe and HBO."
 
In his conversation with Howe, Doty had referred to an organization called
'MJ-12', which he insisted was short for 'Majority 12', a policy-making
body consisting of a dozen high-ranking government scientists, military
officers and intelligence officials. This was not the first time an 'MJ-12'
had been mentioned in what purported to be an official document.  Earlier,
Doty had showed Moore a supposed AFOSI teletype stamped 'Secret' and dated
November 17th, 1980.  After discussing several alleged UFO films, the
document concludes with a brief discussion of how official agencies deal
with UFO data under the rubric of 'Project Aquarius'. It notes, quoting,
"Results of Project Aquarius are still classified 'Top Secret' with no
dissemination outside official intelligence channels and with restricted
access to MJ-12." MJ-12 is not defined or explained.
 
In October, 1988, events took a farcical turn with the broadcast of a
two-hour documentary - using the word 'documentary' in the loosest possible
sense - called "UFO Cover-up: Live." Falcon, and another bird, Condor -
their faces shaded, their voices altered - related the same tales with
which they had regaled Moore and Shandera.  The show, almost universally
judged a laughable embarrassment, was most remembered for the informants'
statement that the aliens favoured ancient Tibetan music and strawberry
ice-cream...
