Topic: CSETI   
 
I helped Greer to speak at our first Symposium in Berkeley  (with  Dr. 
Marina Popovich,  Colin  Andrews,  Dr.  James Harder, et al).  I had a
chance to chat with him at length about CSETI.  I took his one day
class  on  protocols and joined CSETI (this over a year ago).  I have
seen and chatted with him several times since.  I have a friend that
was head  of  CSETI's  Northern California section.   I  have  another
friend that spent time with him in England on the famous crop circle
watch (which Sightings showed, among other things).

At the outset, everyone was incredibly excited that a trauma ward  M.D., 
with contact  experience himself, could put together such a feasible
plan of humans trying to contact ETs (CE5).  CE5 is Dr.   Greers  baby.
Well,  things went along  just fine until the event at Gulf Breeze where
he actually succeeded in contacting 3 to 5 extraterrestrial space craft
and  got  about  50 witnesses, audio recordings and, yes, video of it all.
 
After this event, CSETI began to go downhill due to the ego of  it's 
founder. He came up with this incredible, or should I say incredulous,
series of protocols.  They include such things as a person in the group
that will  remain in telepathic communication with the ETs as things
progress.  This, in itself, is not unusual since, as we all know,
especially those of us who have  been contacted,  that  this  is a
normal communication pattern.  But, this person must stay behind.  They
cannot go on board.  In the group, one  person  has  to be chosen  to  go
on  board  the  craft first, then second.  Someone has to be a recorder,
and on and on.  Then he professes to know what earth human borders
of  these  craft  should  say and do and goes on and on.  My God!  He
had this huge list of things that people have to fill out before they
can take his new classes  (his  latest one - this month I think - was
in Pheonix).  The guy has definitely gone off the deep end.
 
As a result, my friend that was gung ho and N.  California  group  leader 
has dropped  out.   I've  dropped out.  My friend that was with him in
England was unimpressed.
 
He has an excellent idea: Human initiated contact.  Too bad his little ego
got in the way and blew it for him
 
Perhaps I am speaking too soon.  At one point, and I told him this, I
was willing  to  give up an exciting, challenging, well-paying job and
work full time for him.  Unless he does a turn-around to a more humble
man, I  doubt  that I will be available for such adventures in the future.
