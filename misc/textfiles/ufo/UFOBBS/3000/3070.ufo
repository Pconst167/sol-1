Lauren Rose says as a teen-ager she was forced by aliens to strip naked and
undergo painful examinations. Until recently, she didn't know who or what to blame. "I have strongly suspected our cat," Ms. Rose said at the annual Ozark
UFO Conference on Friday. "I know that's crazy, but you don't know my cat."

Some 200 self-described UFOlogists from around the world will attend the
three-day conference that began Friday. Mayor Richard Schoeninger proclaimed
that the first alien brought to him'd be named an honorary citizen of the
resort town and given a free trolley pass. But don't make too many ET jokes
around here. These folks are serious about their aliens. Ms. Rose, 41, of
northern Virginia, said she's undergone therapy since she was 18 to fend off
fits of anxiety and depression. It wasn't until three years ago that Ms.
Rose linked the problems to abductions by aliens, she said. "It's a very
serious issue that can and does affect our mental health and belief systems,"
she said. Ms. Rose said she grew up feeling like she was being watched and
followed. In her late teens, she remembers feeling compelled to walk into
the forest near her home in Colorado. But she couldn't remember what happened
in the woods until undergoing hypnosis recently, Ms. Rose said. "Imagine
someone coming out of the trees making you take your clothes off and
forcing you through a series of painful examinations," she told the group. "I
don't remember those times, but my body did. That's why I was filled with
adrenalin afterwards. I realized in that abduction that I was nothing more
than a guinea pig. They stripped the clothes off me, did the job they had to
do and just dropped me," she said.

Shirley Coyne belongs to a Michigan support group for abductees. Ms. Coyne
said she and her husband were abducted in the summer of 1983 by a UFO that
landed in a corn field. After undergoing hypnosis, Mrs. Coyne said she could
remember little gray men cured her of lupus and Addison's disease in the
large domed spacecraft. Her husband can't remember the abduction, she said.
Ed Mazure, state director of Mutual UFO Network, said the experiences of Ms.
Rose and Mrs. Coyne aren't unusual.
