No Jenny that's not it. Nothing so exciting as that. I am no James 
Bond. I am not part of the CIA, NSA, NRO, the FBI, NRO, DNA, Rand, 
Lockheed, Wackenhut, or any other part of the vast and bottomless
military/intelligence/industrial complex.
 
If I really wanted to p*ss them off I would give the microwave and 
satellite uplink and downlink frequencies for Nellis and Area 51. 
As well as the stuff on the aircraft known as the Chroma. For instance 
this Chroma as it is called is huge, silent and generates a starry 
backround on its underside as camoflage when flying at night. It can 
turn on a dime and generally just floats along. I believe this involves 
the utilization of some propulsion method they got from one of the 
crashed disks. I also am pretty sure that Lockhead was involved in
 
the development and production of the actual craft. There are 2 of 
them at Edwards AFB that they take on test runs from Edwards to Groom 
Lake near Nellis AFB and back again at night. These are the closest 
thing between a marriage of our technology and theirs that I can tell 
is fully operational. Look for more sightings of it throught California 
and the southwest U.S.
 
Why am I telling you all this. Well, there is a good reason to shoot 
your mouth off if you thought "they" were after you. By doing so you 
make your self a better known target and if anything happened to me 
there would be several other researchers who would scream really loud 
about it to make it clear that we were on to something. This way the 
worst "they" can do without causing a major incident is to use harrassment 
techniques and when that doesn't work they just grin and bear it or 
perhaps they'll try to discredit me.
Remember what I said, I am no James Bond, just a UFO research who 
thinks he may have found a smoking gun AND a bullet.

NOt sure of the shape since there has never been an outline associated 
with it but it is supposed to be an emmense craft that opperates without 
any noise. I think the star field is generated simply because people 
don't really look up at night so much as they used to and if they 
did people would say "the stars moved". Something that I would be 
considered loony. Also the size of this craft is so huge it takes 
up a large part of the sky when flying at low altitudes and therefore 
it would stand out more if it were a black mass floating along. e.g. 
you could derive an outline from it. If it were a star field floating 
along you couldn't as easily derive the outline and therefore shape.
