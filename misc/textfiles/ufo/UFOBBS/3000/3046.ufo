Abduction Experience Classification

 By : Richard D. Butler

 The following is a brief description of the most commonly
reported abduction experience types. 

It is intended to provide a standard of classification in
abduction research.

 [AE-1] LUCID DREAM

This is a lucid dream experience generated internally by the
subject+s subconscious. There is no Human/ET  interaction at any
level. They are usually grandiose in nature and lack a logical
progression.

 [AE-2] TECHNO/TELEPATHIC  LUCID DREAM

This is a lucid dream experience, internally generated by
external forces. It is ET in origin and accomplished by
technologically enhanced psychic intrusion of the subject+s
subconscious. The subject reports the disassociation ,or
collapse of, a normal dream and the insertion of a scenario or
message which enhances certain ideals or beliefs. If the subject
awakens immediately after, they report a circle of glowing
whitish colored energy on the ceiling, approximately 2 to 3 feet
in diameter, with a shaft of the same energy slowly retracting
back into the circle. This shaft is approximately 3 to 6 inches
in diameter and 2.5 to 4 feet long. 

 [AE-3] PSY/BIO ENERGY FIELD EXTRACTION

This experience involves the extraction of a conscious energy
field from the subject+s body. It should not be confused with
naturally occurring OOBE phenomena, as separation is externally
induced. The technology employs the use of a white or
bluish-white colored extraction beam. Subjects describe a
feeling of deep penetration of this beam throughout their body,
followed by the sensation of an irresistible or attractive
force. The extracted field maintains cohesion, and is capable of
perceiving stimuli at a greatly enhanced level. Perceptions
include 360 degree sight and sensory feedback at the molecular,
and even atomic level. Experiences seem to focus around
communications and reinsertion of the bio-field into a humanoid
body other than the original. It is this type of abduction that
accounts for the severe missing time memory failure in some
cases.

Since the subject+s brain is not physically present, the
memories are not hard-written. There does appear to be a shadow
memory effect that can retain the memories of the events in some
type of energy memory matrix, within the subjects bio-field.
Full understanding of this process could lead to breakthroughs
in education and learning technologies.

 [AE-4] PHYSICAL ABDUCTION

This is the physical removal of a subject from their environment
to an ET environment. The subject is first tranquilized to
reduce possible injury to either side. These abductions follow a
very strict military-like protocol. Subjects are transported via
a small shuttle, lifting beam or  direct transfer. Direct
transfer utilizes a hyper-dimensional tunnel. It will appear as
a large brilliant white energy gate. The subject steps through
the gate and is instantly aboard the craft. Also reported is the
nullification of the nuclear repulsive forces in solid objects.
This allows the subject to physically pass through solid
objects. Once onboard, the person is subjected to various
physical tests and procedures. The main thrust is in the genetic
experimentation area. Reports of sperm and ovum extraction are
quite common. After these procedures are performed, the subject
is returned unharmed, to their original location. A screen
memory is then inserted into the subject+s subconscious. This
slightly shifts the reality recalled by the abductee but never
erases the event entirely. This distinguishes them from [AE-3]. 

 [AE-5] PAST LIFE RECALL

These experiences are the least reported and the most
interesting, in terms of their implications. They appear to
represent events in the experience of an ET life form. Subjects
relate being in an underground military facility, sometimes on
Mars, the Moon and even under the Earth's oceans.

Memories of being onboard a spacecraft and other ET environments
are also recalled. What is so interesting is that the subject
views this, not from an Earth human perspective, but from that
of an ET. This suggests two very interesting possibilities.  A.)
During telepathic communication some memories are subconsciously
transferred.  B.) The subject is recalling actual past life
memories of their own. This second possibility opens the door to
much speculation. It suggests that part of the abduction
phenomena may be a, massive and covert, reconnaissance
operation. It may also explain why the Greys have said they have
the right to do what they do. If abductees are souls that have
been transferred from the ET environment to Earth, then
technically they are not abducting human beings but volunteer
ETs.



CLASSIFICATION OF OBSERVED UFO OCCUPANTS

-And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness....+ Genesis, Chapter 1, Verse 26

-And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the Sons of
God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took
them wives of all which they chose... There were giants in the
earth in those days; and also after that, when the Sons of God
came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to
them....+ Genesis, Chapter 6, Verses 1,2,4

[GROUP A]-NON EARTH BORN HOMO SAPIENS

This group consists of three being types from three distinct
colony zones, namely Sirius, Pleiades and Orion. Genetically,
they are nearly identical to Terran humans with the following
exceptions. Abductees refer to these beings as the -talls.+
Males average uo to seven feet in height; females, up to six and
a half feet. They are extremely fine featured, pale in
complexion. Eyes are almond shaped, slightly slanted with a
natural black liner, much like Egyptians. There are three hair
colors apparently related to colony origin: blonde (Pleiades),
black (Orion), and red (Sirius). The insignia of these combined
human races is a triangular arrangement of three spheres. This
symbol has deep significance, and is found throughout Terran
history. History records these beings as goddesses, gods, devas,
etc. A subgroup of Group A females is in command of most Terran
projects.

GROUP B-TERRAN HUMANS

These are Homo Sapiens whose origin is the planet Earth. They
can be divided into two separate classes.

Class A (Ancient)-These humans were the companions and house
servants of a Group A military mining and occupation force. When
this force left the Earth sometime between 1,000 B.C. and 2,000
B.C., it was decided to remove all humans that had been in close
proximity with them. It was felt that leaving them would only
further disrupt normal human development. Class A humans are on
an equal level with Group A and cooperate fully in all Terran
projects.

Class M (Modern)-These humans are working on the same
cooperative level as Class A. They were taken from the Earth in
modern times. During some abduction projects, twins (either
identical or fraternal) are induced in a female subject. During
the first trimester, one of the fetuses is removed. It is then
grown to maturity by Group A. Abductees will meet their twins
during some abductions. Very limited contact has been made by
these humans.

[GROUP C]- GENETICALLY MODIFIED TERRAN HUMANS

These humans are comprised of two classes and should not be
confused with Group D Greys.

[Class W] (Workers)-This class is the smallest in physical
stature. They are described as approximately three and a half
feet in height, large head and eyes, pale white in complexion.
these workers were created by Group A through genetic
modification of Terran human fetuses. Their function is to
perform menial tasks requiring limited reasoning abilities. In
mental capacity, they are equivalent to a five year old child.
They are incapable of violence and, in come cases, are kept as
companions by Group A individuals.

[Class T] (Technicians)-These humans are basically the same as
Class W. they are slightly larger, at approximately four and a
half feet in height. Their complexion is tan or yellowish. Their
reasoning and deductive powers are higher. This allows them to
perform more complex operations. They are often seen operating
ship controls and in transport activities. Both Classes W and T
are telepathically camouflaged to appear as Greys by abductees.
This is done to conceal the true nature of Group C. It is felt
that perception of Group A maintaining a human slave population
would hinder future contact efforts. This point will undoubtedly
be a source of much heated debate in the near future.

[GROUP D]-GREYS

Of the six groups discussed in this paper, the Greys appear to
represent the only non-human contingent. The following data
should be considered tentative at best. Height is approximately
five and a half feet. The head is large; eyes large, black and
very slanted. Skin color is dark grey and non-porous. All data
so far indicates that they may be a cetacean-based life form. On
Earth, this comprises the species of whales and dolphins.
Descriptions of Greys+ skin color and texture closely match that
of dolphins. The stare and stun effects approximate that
performed by dolphins on potential enemies, such as sharks and
barracuda. 

Human and dolphin fetuses are nearly identical, up to a certain
development stage. Some say they share a common genetic
ancestor. If so, then this makes the hybridization of human and
dolphins theoretically feasible. 

There are two possibilities concerning the origin of the Greys.
The first is that a cetacean life form evolved on another
planet. Unlike Terran cetaceans, they did not return to the
oceans. The second possibility involves the genetic modification
of Terran cetaceans by Group A. When Group created workers in
ancient times, they may have used the two most evolved species
available. These would have been pre-humans and dolphins. There
is evidence for this in ancient writing, sculptures and
paintings. they show a close relationship between the gods
(Group A) and dolphins. In South America, there are ruins which
appear to have been massive water enclosures. could these have
been the breeding pens of the Greys?

[GROUP E]-HUMAN/GREY HYBRIDS

One of the main ET projects, now in the completion stage, is the
hybrid program. The goal of this project is to produce a being
combining the best physical and mental qualities of both races.
The following description is of a hybrid female, approximately
fifteen years old. Height is five feet, three inches; skin color
is pale white/grey. the head is slightly larger and rounder than
normal. Hair is dark, high above the forehead, and worn in a
very long ponytail. The face is very fine-featured, and
attractive. Like all the beings discussed in this paper, her
method of communication is telepathic. This has allowed a deeper
understanding of her intellectual and emotional make-up. They
consider themselves human, not Grey, in almost all respects.
They care about the Greys, as any child would a parent, but find
them agonizingly boring. The desire for human contact is greater
than all others. Their capacity for emotion is as great, if not
greater than, humans. Any physical attribute more human than
Grey is a great source of pride. their intellectual capacity is
well above human standards.  It is very likely they will exceed
the capabilities of both races.

[GROUP F]-SASQUATCH

These have been seen both near, and on-board, UFOs. Little is
known about them. Some have speculated that they are the
original pre-human species from which Homo Sapiens were derived.
