SUBJECT: PEOPLE REALLY DO HAVE SEX WITH SPACE ALIENS!        FILE: UFO3374

Cambridge, Mass. - Dr. John Mack was a well respected Harvard University 
psychiatry professor until he began taling about treating patients who've had 
sex with space aliens.

Now he is considered a quack by many of his high-brow colleagues who want to 
kick him out of the prestigious Ivy League school.

"I've know John since the 1950s. He's a brilliant fellow who occasionally 
loses it, and this time he's lost it big time," said Dr. Paul R. McHugh, 
director of the department of psychiatry and behvioral sciences at Johns 
Hopkins Hospital.

"John is saying there are people who have been abducted by aliens and need 
treatment for it, and that is just outrageous," Dr. McHugh added.

Before he began talking about space aliens, Dr. Mack was respected Pulitzer 
prize-winning professor at Harvard Medical School, woh founded the psychiatry 
department at Cambridge Hospital, one of Harvard's teaching facilities.

But some of Dr. Mack's Harvard cronies wondered if he had lost his marbles 
after he appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live and other talk 
shows last year to promote his book, Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens.

The book's 13 case studies included Ed, who remembers an alien woman taking a 
sperm sample from him when he was in high school; Jerry, who says she gave 
birth to a human-alien hybrid, and Peter, who tells Mack he had an alien wife 
in a parallel universe.

It may have been the "talk show" publicity that inspired the Harvard Medical 
Committee to investigate whether Dr. Mack's alien abduction research meets the 
school's standards for scholarship.

They could applaud his alien research work or boot him out of school. Dean 
Daniel Tosteson will make the decision based on the probe.

"History hasn't been kind to those who have unorthordox ideas," said attorney 
Roderick MacLeish, who represents Dr. Mack. "That's the whole point of having 
a free and open academic community. That's the whole purpose of tenure."

MacLeish says the medical commitee's action violates the principle of the 
tenure system, which gives professors jobs for life so they can feel free to 
pursue radical or unpopular research.

Dr. Mack, 65, told the Associated Press last year that he doesn't necessarily 
believe in space aliens. But he can understand why his colleagues could find 
his work troubling.

"We don't have room in our culture for this," he said. "It's the elite people, 
my colleagues, who decide what we're supposed to believe, and to them this 
isn't supposed to be."

A source close to the case, who didn't want to be identified, said that the 
down-to-earth medical professors feel threatened by Dr. Mack's other world" 
research.

"If Dr. Mack is right, it undercuts so much of the work of people over there," 
he said. "These people don't think anything is true unless they've got a 
controlled study with rats."
