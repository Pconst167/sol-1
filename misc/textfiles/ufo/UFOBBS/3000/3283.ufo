³HISTORY: This specimen was obtained from a female subject on        ³
³December 11, 1992. The subject will herein be referred to as        ³
³DS92009LT. The subject reported recovering the object from          ³
³her eye on the morning of December 11, 1992. She stated that        ³
³she awakened with an irritation and while rubbing her eye,          ³
³a small particle, about the size of a mustard seed, was             ³
³recovered. The specimen was turned over to Derrel Sims, Chief       ³
³Abductions Investigator, Houston UFO Network. The specimen          ³
³was photographed and stored in a plastic case.                      ³
³                                                                    ³
³Subject DS92009LT reported to have been part of a mass              ³
³abduction in Houston, Texas on the night of December 8, 1992.       ³
³The subject reports that an implant was placed behind one of        ³
³her eyes during the abduction. The complete report on the           ³
³mass abduction of December 8, 1992 can be obtained under            ³
³separate cover.                                                     ³
³                                                                    ³
³PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: The specimen has been viewed                  ³
³under a standard light and stereoscopic microscopes. It             ³
³appears flesh toned with an "egg" shape, approximately              ³
³1 - 1.5mm in length, and has a hollow interior. The apex has        ³
³been truncated and lateral splitting from the apical area           ³
³distally is noted.                                                  ³
³                                                                    ³
³The exterior of the specimen appears different from the             ³
³interior.  The exterior is smooth and non-porous with a             ³
³mottled appearance. The interior has a spongy "honey-               ³
³combed" appearance, and is lighter in contrast to the exterior.     ³
³The specimen is resilient and does not permanently deform           ³
³with pressure or manipulation.                                      ³
³                                                                    ³

³TAXONOMY: The specimen was taken to the Department of               ³
³Biology at the University of Houston. It was examined by            ³
³several doctoral and post-doctoral students. The specimen did       ³
³not fit any known taxonomic classification. It was determined       ³
³that the specimen was not biological.                               ³
³QUALITATIVE ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS: Qualitative elemental               ³
³analysis was performed on April 14, 1992 at the                     ³
³Superconductivity Laboratory, University of Houston, using an       ³
³electron microprobe. A small sample was taken from the              ³
³specimen for analysis. Microprobes were taken from various          ³
³locations on the sample, and are considered to be                   ³
³representative of the specimen.                                     ³

³The following elements were found throughout the probe. This        ³

³Although absolute percentages of elements cannot be                 ³
³determined with this method, the specimen appeared to be            ³
³carbon rich, suggesting that it is organic. The other earth         ³
³elements are suspected to be present in trace quantities            ³
³only, but have been determined to be part of the specimen and       ³
³not contaminants.  However, this hypothesis cannot be               ³
³substantiated without quantitative analysis.                        ³
³                                                                    ³
³The probe also determined that the material was electrically        ³
³non-conductive.                                                     ³
³                                                                    ³
³ANOMALIES: There are a few notable anomalies in the                 ³
³specimen. It is unusual for titanium and silicon to be present in   ³
³a compound which is carbon rich and containing oxygen. It is        ³
³also not consistent with the textural features of the               ³
³specimen. Compounds containing titanium and silicon tend to         ³
³be much more rigid and brittle. Also, the presence of               ³
³beryllium is unusual in that it is normally found only in           ³
³compounds which are electrically conductive.                        ³
³                                                                    ³
³SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The specimen obtained from                 ³
³subject DS92009LT is an ovoid, flesh-toned object approximately     ³
³1-1.5 mm in length with a hollow core. Based on taxonomic           ³
³examination it is non-biological. Qualitative analysis              ³
³suggests a carbon rich non-conductive material with some            ³
³unusual combinations of trace elements. The substance is most       ³
³likely a high molecular weight organic compound. Polymers           ³
³(plastics) are the most likely compounds to fit the elemental       ³
³profile.                                                            ³

³   accomplished through HPLC (high pressure liquid                  ³
