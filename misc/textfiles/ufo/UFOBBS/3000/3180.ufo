    While searching my files for information on the Australian case, I came 
    accross this article, published in March 1987, on cattle mutilations. 
    
      Dr.  Leo Sprinkle hypnotised Judy Doraty of suburban Houston, TX,  in 
    the course of trying to find the cause of recurring headaches. Hypnosis 
    uncovered an abduction in which she and her daughter Cindy, then age 5, 
    were taken onto a UFO and examined in 1973. 
    
      While still in her car,  she saw a beam of light that seemed like  it 
    had substance in it, shine down from the UFO and pick up a calf,  which 
    was squirming and trying to get free as it was taken up. 
    
      Later while on the UFO,  she saw the calf being cut up by the aliens. 
    They took the eyes,  tongue, and sex organs, then lowered the calf back 
    down to the ground. 
    
      She  was  telepathically  told  by the aliens that she  saw  this  by 
    accident,   and that she was not to tell anyone.  She had no memory  of 
    this until hypnotised. 
    
      The aliens were small men with large eyes and unusual hands with long 
    fingernails. 
    
      I checked the phone book for the Greater Houston area 1989-90 but did 
    not find the name Doraty. 
    
      I  do  not  have any personal experience with this,  I   merely  call 
    attention  to what I think is significant.  Don Ecker,  who takes  this 
    very  seriously,   is  a former police investigator,  and  has  a  good 
    reputation  in  the UFO community as a serious investigator.  He  is  a 
    sometimes user of this Forum. Dr. Leo Sprinkle is well known to the UFO 
    community  and  I  haven't heard anything negative about  him.   He  is 
    director of counseling and testing at the University of Wyoming. 
    
      I have heard cattle mutilation dismissed as the work of predators, or 
    weird cults, but never as disinformation. The phenomenon is accepted as 
    real, only the cause is debated. 
    
      I suggest you read HARVES.MUT in the DL10 library of the Issues Forum 
    of Compuserve. It is an earlier update on mutilations by Linda Howe. If 
    you  do not need protocol (I don't),  just type READ HARVES.MUT instead 
    of  the  menu choices offered.  You can also use the Browse choice  and 
    enter the keyword CATTLE, to get a list of files. 
    
      For articles by Don Ecker,  see UFO magazine, vol 5 #2,  page 13,  an 
    article on a  possible  connection  between  UFOs and missing children. 
    Also, back issue Vol 4 #3 page 6, an article on human mutilation, and a 
    secrecy crackdown.
