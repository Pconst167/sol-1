                         Aliens on Mars?
                           by UFO JOE
                         August 29, 1993

Scientist  always  wondered if there was life on Mars.  There  is
ample evidence that Mars was once flowing with water that is  now
locked up in it's polar ice caps. If there was intelligent  life,
where  did  it  go? Could the strange satellite  of  Mars  called
Phobos  actually  be a hollow space colony? What would we  do  if
Earth  dried up, head for the Moon? It's long been rumoured  that
if  NASA found proof of aliens on Mars or Phobos, that  it would
not  be released to the public. Just a few days ago a  NASA  Mars
Observer arrived at Mars and NASA has just announced that it  has
gone  missing.  Have aliens tampered with this probe or  is  this
part  of the government cover-up. Read on and make draw your  own
conclusions.

             Moon of Mars is a Massive Alien Colony

In 1959 a soviet scientist, Dr. Shklovsky announced that  Phobos,
one of the moons of Mars was an artificial satellite, a ten  mile
wide  hollow  sphere based on observations from  the  U.S.  Naval
Observatory. In 1963 a NASA official Raymond Wilson announced  to
the  Institute  of Aerospace Sciences that Phobos might  house  a
colossal  space  colony. Other scientists like Dr.  Fred  Singer,
(chief space adviser to President Eisenhower); Professor James A.
Harder (University of California); and Wells Alan Webb, respected
Mars authorities agree that Phobos may host an Alien colony. NASA
has  considered  the  possibility and made plans  to  send  space
probes to investigate.

                      Mars & UFO Sightings

Wilbert  Smith  the Telecommunications Engineer of  the  Canadian
Department of Transport notes the curious fact that the frequency
of  of UFO sightings is highest at times when Mars is closest  to
Earth.

                     The Phobos II Incident

On  July 12, 1988 the USSR launched two unmanned  probes  towards
Mars called Phobos I and Phobos II. Two months later Phobos I was
mysteriously lost. Phobos II arrived at Mars in January 1989 and
entered  an  orbit around the planet as the first phase  of  it's
real destination, a small Martian moon called Phobos. The mission
was  flawless  until the craft aligned itself  with  Phobos.   On
March  28,  1989  an elliptical craft  was  photographed  by  three
different cameras moving towards the satellite seconds before  it
failed. All indications were that the elliptical UFO had  somehow
attacked  the satellite which was now dead and left spinning  out
of control.

                        The Face on Mars

The surface of Mars is covered with strange shapes and  buildings
that  do  not appear to be natural such as the  pyramids,  square
buildings,  runways, etc. One structure shows the face of  a  man
with a helmet looking into space. It can be seen at the  National
Space Science Data Center, Viking photo with catalog number 76-A-
593/17384 Titled "Head". (Other photos are from NASA 070-A-13 and
035-A-72)  There  are  now  eleven  Viking  photographs  of  this
monument on the surface of Mars. The "Head" and other  artificial
features  such  as  the pyramids were studied  by  an  electrical
engineer and imaging specialist Vincent Di Pietro and a  Lockheed
computer  scientist. The analysis indicates that the  "Face"  had
been artificially sculpted.

                    Russian-USA Joint Venture

On  October 6, 1992 in a press release it was revealed  that  for
the  first  time in history. The Russian Space  Agency  and  NASA
would co-operate to rush another probe to mars. However,  rumours
leaking out of NASA say that transmissions from this mission will
not be made public. If anything alien is found on Mars/Phobos  it
will not be released.

       Another Phobos II Incident or Government Cover-UP?

Well  it's August, 1993 and the Mars Observer has  gone  missing?
Have the aliens destroyed another probe? Or could this be  NASA's
way  of  hiding it's findings to the public? Or is Mars  just  an
unlucky place to send probes. We have successfully sent probes to
the outer reaches of our solar system, but Mars is plagued by bad
luck?  I wonder if we will ever know what is really going  on  on
Mars. - UFOJOE
