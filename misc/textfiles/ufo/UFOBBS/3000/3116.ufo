INITIAL FINDINGS UPON EXAMINATION AND AUTOPSY OF THE BODY OF AN APPARENT ALIEN
CREATURE

1. External Appearance

This body was observed to be in a state of significant deterioration.  It had
been preserved with formaldehyde solution but not otherwise dissected.

The cadaver was 44 inches long with a weight of 27 pounds when the preservative
solution had been drained.

The external appearance of this cadaver was of a human embryo with an enlarged
cranium.  Hands and feet were normal.  Fingers and toenails had been had been
pared.  Fingerprints of a swirl-left pattern were observed and taken.  All ten
fingers and toes were apparent.  There was some vestigial webbing between first
and second fingers and toes.

Sexual organs appeared to be those of a male.  They were in an embryonic state
and revealed no evidence of pubescence.

Ears were partially formed, and showed some evidence of surgical intervention. 
Folds of skin had been drawn out from the surface of the scalp in an apparent
attempt to create the impression of a more fully developed ear than was actually
present.

Lips were vestigial and the mouth contained no erupted teeth.  The nose was also
in an incomplete state of growth and had also received surgical intervention,
resulting in what appeared to be a very thin a delicate organ.

Eyes were distinguished by extensive surgical intervention.  They were almond-
shaped and by far the most prominent facial feature.  The eyeballs were not
matured and appeared to have been sutured with artificial lenses of an unknown
type.  Because of their extremely unusual condition, dissection of these eyes was
not attempted.

2. Dissection

An incision was made from the thorax to the scrotum.  The skin was first extended
from the fascia and the fascia was observed to be consistent with the appearance
of an immature human male.  The fascia were then dissected and the internal
organs were observed.  The position of the heart was observed to be vertical, as
would be consistent with a very early fetus, prior to the fourth month.  The
organ was prominent and was weighed to be 1/70th of the mass of the body.  When
the organ was dissected it was found that there was direct communication between
the two auricles through the formen ovale.  The Eustachian valve was observed to
be large.  A ductus arteriosus was observed to communicate between the pulmonary
artery and the descending aorta.  This ductus opened into the descending aorta
just below the origin of the left subclavian artery.

Alterations in the structure of the circulatory system suggested that this body
had been surgically corrected to detach it from placental dependence in an
artificial manner.  The stomach was opened and found to be free of any food
substances.  The cardiac orifice was apparently atrophied, although the
deterioration of the corpus made this difficult to determine.  It is possible
that this individual did not eat.

The liver was prominent and it was clear that the blood of the umbilical vein
would traverse it before entering the inferior cava.  The umbilical vein itself
had been severed of its placental crown and returned to the circulatory system
by a means that was beyond the scope of this dissection to establish.

The lungs were not developed.  There were lateral pouches on either side of the
central diverticulum, open through into the pharynx.  The larynx was somewhat
cartilaginous and the trachea was developed.

It is probable that this individual did not breathe and more than he ate.  The
means of sustaining life is unknown, if he was ever alive in any practical sense.

The cranium was dissected and it was found that the skull was formed of
exceptionally thin and pliant cartilaginous material, appearing to be bone
precursor that had been affected in some manner, making it more than usually thin
and delicate.  The brain itself was extensively and surprisingly formed.  There
was an unknown cortex superimposed on the forebrain and extending as far back as
the fissure of Ralando.

Because of this extraordinary formation it was decided not to pursue dissection
of the brain at this time.  The organ was extracted and placed in fluid
preservation pending further study.

Overall, this corpus presented the appearance of a human embryo of three to four
months duration that had been the subject of considerable alteration and
modification, some of it obviously surgical.  Other modifications, such as that
of the brain, were harder to understand.  In addition to the alterations, there
was the matter of the size of the body and the relatively mature condition of the
epidermis and nails.  It would appear that this fetus was separated from its
mother and brought to a semi-functional state by artificial means.

3. Conclusion

This is a human fetus that has been subjected to forced maturation without normal
gestation.  Its degree of functionality while living if it ever was alive is
unknown.

INITIAL FINDINGS UPON EXAMINATION
AND AUTOPSY OF THE BODY OF AN
APPARENT ALIEN CREATURE

1. External Appearance

This body was observed to be in a state of profound deterioration.  It had not
been preserved but was delivered in a container of rubberized canvas, to which
some of the tissue had adhered.  The cadaver was 36 inches long with a weight of
8 pounds.  The external appearance of this cadaver was not of a human type.

The skin appeared smooth and a dark bluish-gray in color.  There was no clothing
on the body.  There were no genitals and no was of determining sex, if any.  The
nose consisted of two slits, the mouth was a small opening that did not appear
to be supported by an articulated law, and there were holes in the position of
ears.  The cranium was round and large in proportion to the body and the eyes
were almond-shaped.  The eyes were closed and could not be opened without
damaging structures, due to condition of decaying tissue.

Arms and wrists were very thin.  The hands displayed a three-digit arrangement
without thumb.  The arms extended to approximately three inches above the knee. 
The three fingers extended directly from the wrist, with no palm.

2. Dissection

The body was opened from crotch to chin.  A green liquid emerged from the
incision.  The skin was not backed by fascia, and the bone structure appeared to
be a cartilaginous substance of light green-blue color.

Internal organs were observed but their function was unclear.  The thoracic and
peritoneal cavities communicated and there appeared to be no respiratory system
and no stomach.  The esophagus was vestigial and dissipated before reaching
another organ.

There appeared to be two multi-chambered hearts and it was surmised that body
fluid could be pumped rapidly.  There was an extensive circulatory system that
involved three different types of vein.  Some material was extracted from one of
these systems and suggested possible waste, leading to the notion that waste may
have been exuded through the skin.

The fluid removed from the body was analyzed under the microscope and found to
be a vegetable substance, chlorophyll-based.  It is possible that photosynthesis
was the means of obtaining energy.

The cranium was dissected and it was observed that a ridge of cartilage separated
the brain into two completely isolated components.  The brain was severely
deteriorated, but appeared to be extensively fissured and divided into numerous
lobes.  Because of the deterioration the degree of bilateralism of the two halves
could not be determined with any accuracy.

This cadaver exuded an unusually foul odor.

3. Conclusion

This is not a cadaver of a kind previously observed by or known to this
pathologist.  It appears to be a form of creature utilizing elements of both the
animal and vegetable.
