                       New Kingston, Penn.

My Dear Dr. Jessup,

Your invocation to the Public that they move en Masse upon  their
Representatives  and  have thusly enough Pressure placed  at  the
right  & sufficient Number of Places where from a  Law  demanding
Research  into Dr. Albert Einsteins Unified Field Theory  May  be
enacted (1925-27) IS NOT at all necessary.

It May Interest you to know that The Good Doctor Was Not so  Much
influenced in his retraction of that Work, BY Mathematics, as  he
most assuredly was by Humantics.

His  Later computations, done strictly for his own edification  &
amusement, upon cycles of Human Civilization & Progress  compared
to  the  Growth of Mans General overall Character Was  enough  to
Horrify  Him.  Thus,  We are "TOLD" today that  that  Theory  was
"Incomplete."

Dr.  B.  Russell asserts privately that It is complete.  He  also
says that Man is Not Ready for it & Shan't be until after W.W.III
Nevertheless,  "Results"  of My friend Dr.  Franklin  Reno,  WERE
USED. These Were a complete Re-check of That Theory, With a  View
to  any & Every Possible quick use of it, if feasable in  a  Very
short  time. There Were good Results, as far as a Group Math  Re-
Check AND as far as a good Physical "Result", to Boot.

             YET, THE NAVY FEARS TO USE THIS RESULT.

The  Result was and stands today as Proof that The Unified  Field
Theory  to  a  certain extent is  correct.  Beyond  that  certain
extent  is correct. Beyond that certain extent No Person  in  his
right senses, or having any senses at all, Will evermore DARE  to
go.  I am sorry that I Mislead You in My Presious Missive.  True,
enough,  such  a  form of Levitation  has  been  accomplished  as
described.  True,  enough,  such a form of  Levitation  has  been
accomplished  as described. It is also a Very  commonly  observed
reaction  of  certain  Metals to  Certain  Fields  surrounding  a
current.  Had  Farraday concerned himself about  the  Mag.  field
surrounding  an Electric Currant, We today Would NOT exist OR  IF
We did exist, our present Geo-political situation would not  have
the   very   time-bombish,  ticking  off   towards   Destruction,
atmosphere that Now exists.

Alright, Alright! The Destroyer type, AND ALL of its crew,  While
at  Sea  (Oct.  1943)  The  Field  Was  effective  in  an  oblate
spheroidal shape, extending one hundred yards (More or Less,  due
to Lunar position & Latitude) OUT from wach beam of the ship. Any
Person  Within  THAT  sphere  became vague in  form  BUT  He  too
observed  those Persons aboard that ship as though they too  were
of  the  same state, yet were walking upon  nothing.  Any  person
without  that sphere could see Nothing save the  clearly  DEFINED
SHAPE  OF THE SHIPS HULL IN THE WATER, Providing of course,  that
the person was just close enough to see yet, just barely  outside
of that field.

Why  tell you Now? Very Simple; If You choose to go Mad then  you
would reveal this information. Half of the officers & the crew of
that  Ship  are at Present, Mad as Hatters. A few, are  even  Yet
confined  to  certain  areas  where  they  May  receive   trained
Scientific  aid when they, either, "Go Blank" or "Go Blank &  Get
Stuck."

Going  Blank IS Not at all an unpleasant expierence to  Healthily
Curious  Sailors. However it is when also, they "Get Stuck"  that
they call it "HELL" INCORPORATED" The Man thusly stricken can Not
Move  of  his own volition unless two or More of  those  who  are
within the field go & touch him, quickly, else he "Freezes".

If  a man Freezes, His position Must be Marked out carefully  and
then the Field is cut-off. Everyone but that "Frozen" Man is able
to Move; to appreciate APPARENT Solidity again. Then, the  Newest
Member of the crew Must approach the Spot, where he will find the
"Frozen"  Mans  face or bare skin, that is Not covered  by  usual
uniform Clothing Sometimes, It takes only an hour or so Sometimes
all  DayLong  &  Worse  IT ONCE TOOK 6 MONTHS,  to  get  The  man
"Unfrozen".  THIS "DEEP FREEZE" WAS NOT PSYCOLOGICAL. It  is  the
Result  of a Hyper-Field that is set up, within the field of  the
Body,  While The "Scorch" Field is turned on & this at Length  OR
upon a Old Hand.

A Highly complicated Piece of Equipment Had to be constructed  in
order to Unfreeze those who became "True Froze" or "Deep  Freeze"
subjects.  USUALLY  A "DEEP FEEZE" MAN GOES  MAD,  STARK  RAVING,
GIBBERING, RUNNING MAD, if His "freeze" is far More than a Day in
our time.ÿ

Check Philadelphia Papers for a tiny one Paragraph (upper Half of
sheet,  inside the paper Near the rear 3rd of Paper,  1944-46  in
Spring or Fall or Winter, NOT Summer.) of an Item describing  the
Sailors  Actions after their initial Voyage. They Raided a  Local
to the Navy Yard "Gin Mill" or "Beer Joint" & caused such a Shock
&  Paralysis of the Waitresses that Little comprehenssible  could
be gotten from them, save that Paragraph & the Writer of it, Does
Not Believe it, & Says "I only wrote what I heard & them Dames is
Daffy. So, all I get is a "Hide-it" Bedtime Story."

Check  obsever  ship  crew,  Matson Lines  Liberty  ship  out  of
Norfolk,  (Company  MAY Have Ships Log for that Voyage  or  Coast
Guard  have  it) The S.S. Andrew Furuseth,  Cheif  Mate  Mowsely,
(Will secure Captains Name Later)(Ships Log Has Crew List on it.)
one  crew  member Richard Price or "Splicey" Price  May  Remember
other Names of Deck Crew Men, (Coast Guard has record of  Sailors
issued "Papers") Mr. Price Was 18 or 19 then, Oct. 1943 and Lives
or  Lived at that time in His old Family Home in Roanoke, V.A.  a
small  town with Small phone book. These Men Were Witnesses,  The
Men  of this crew, "Conally of New England, (Boston?),  May  have
Witnessed but I doubt it. (Spelling May be incorrect) DID Witness
this.  i ask you to Do this bit of Research simply that  you  May
Choke  on  your  own  Tongue when  you  Remember  what  you  have
"appealed be Made Law"

                                     Very Disrespectfully Yours,

                                               Carl M. Allen

P.S. Will Help More if you see Where I can.

Admiral  Rawson  Bennett for verification of  into  Herein.  Navy
Chief of Research. He may offer you a job, ultimately.)

Coldly and analytically speaking, without the Howling that is  in
the Letter to you accompanying this, I will say the following  in
all Fairness to you & to Science.
