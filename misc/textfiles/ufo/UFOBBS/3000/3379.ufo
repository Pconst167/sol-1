Washington - A noted scientist has just produced startling proof that the 
lunar surface was once inhabited by intelligent beings: A 10-inch iron 
sculpture of an angel embeded in a moon rock!

Geologist Dr. Morris Wedler revealed last week that NASA lab workers chipped 
the angel from one of the rocks brought to Earth by apollo 11 astronauts 26 
years ago, in 1969.

Dr. Wedler was a NASA scientist himself for 23 years but left the agency in 
1987. He still maintains close ties to many of his former colleagues.

"The implications of this figurine are absolutely mind-boggling," Dr. wedler 
told reporters. "It means that at one time the moon had an atmosphere 
conducive to life. And what's more, it was once home to a sophisticated race 
of people with a highly refined sense of beauty."

The angel - a humanoid female with wing-like appendages on her back and long 
flowing hair - is made of an iron compound found exclusively in the highlands 
of the moon.

This rules out the possibility that it was dropped by a race of aliens from 
another planet. It's been hand polished to a silvery metallic sheen. Based on 
a chemical analysis of the metal, geologists estimate the sculpture to be 
200,000 years old which means it was made 170,000 years before the human 
species appeared on Earth.

It's been examined by art experts who concur with Dr. Wedler's appraisal of 
the culture that produced it.

"Whoever created this lovely piece had great talent and high intelligence," 
said one art professor.

And a Washington anthropologist added: "Clearly these beings had a sense of 
religion that parallels our Christianity. Perhaps they had a Jesus of their 
own, proving that the importtant spiritual principles are, in very literal 
sense, universal."

While may ponder the significance of the figure, others are curious about why 
it has remained a secret for so long.

"The artifact has been common knowledge among NASA insiders for years," said 
Dr. Wedler.

"But space agency higherups have kept the information highly classified, 
fearing world wide panic.

"It was smuggled out to me by persons who must, for obvious reasons, remain 
anonymous."

NASA officially denies Dr. Wedler's allegations. The statue was displayed to 
photographers and newsmen but is now being held for further study at an 
undisclosed location.

This discovery comes barely two years after the disclosure in 1993 that 
geologists also discovered something that appears to be a human fetus embedded 
in another moon rock.

That story made headlines around the world, including WWN Febrauary 9, 1993 
issue.
