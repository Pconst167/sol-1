Ken Caryl Residents report "UFO"
 
Deputy Mike Sensano doesn't know what he saw on Jan 24. but he's positive
that it wasn't from a helicopter, or an airplane, or a spotlight.
 
Sensano was among four Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputies that saw a strange
cluster of lights appear over the Ken Caryl Valley two Sundays ago.  And the
Deputies weren't alone.  Between 7:45pm and 9:00pm the Jefferson County Sherr
if's Department recieved 10 calls from residents of the Ken Caryl Ranch area
who also observed a bright white light and a group of yelow ones hovering
over
the air.
 
"When people ask me to describe the lights, I tell them I've never seen this
kind of light before, so I have nothing to compare it to." Sensano said.  "
If I saw some men coming out of saucers, I'd say so."
 
Sensano was dispatched to the location after an anonymous citizen reported
the sighting from his car.  The citizen called JCSD from a cellular phone.
When Sensano looked west from the Diamond/Shamrock gasoline station on Chat
field Avenue, he saw the lights above the mountain where the Ken Caryl West
Ranch subdivision is located.
 
According to a Sheriff's report filed by Sensano, the yellow cluster appeared
to be suspended in the air and not traveling in any direction.  Sensano said
he could not hear any engine sounds.  One deputy called officials at Staple
ton International Airport, who confirmed that they had seen the lights, but
showed nothing on there radar screen.
 
The lights abruptly dissapeared from the sky around 8:00pm, but reappeared
in a triangular form about ten minutes later in the same area as seen before.
Sensano said the hovering beams luminated the car of a man traveling on U.S
285 by the hogback.  He said the driver ws momentarily blinded by the bright
ness of the lights.  Since the incident, Sensano says he's heard numerous
theories explaining the phenomenon.  One theory is that the lights were mere
ly fiber optics created by the airwaves.  Another theory is that there was
some king of mirage reflecting heat waves.  Others claim that the lights
were the result of a secret military experiment.  Sensano himself offers
no theories on what he saw.
 
In his sherrif's report, the deputy classified the case as a "Suspicious
incident."
