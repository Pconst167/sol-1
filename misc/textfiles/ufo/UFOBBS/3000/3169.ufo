Hi all. Here's an article from the Sunday 12th issue of our
local newspaper, The Sunday Mail. The article is accompanied by
an aerial photograph of a sugar-cane field with random,
flattened cane areas reminiscent of perhaps a cyclone path. The
cane is not swirled, but appears (the photo is taken from some
distance) to have fallen from the centre outwards, or just any
which-way.

    CANING ALIENS OR SHAPING FUTURE?

 A more than slightly bemused cane farmer, Jack Walden, arrived
back at his Sunshine Coast hinterland property at Woombye
[about 100 klms north of Brisbane.M.W.] yesterday to find his
bottom cane paddock full of media and flying saucer devotees
looking for proof that aliens had landed.
   "This is just so enormous! You've got a world first here!"
an elated George F. Scott of Pomona, a member of the Gympie
[188 klms north of Brisbane] branch of the Queensland UFO
Research Bureau, said. [No, I've never met him nor heard of the
organisation. It is not listed in the telephone directory. It's
possible that the press have got the name of UFORQ - UFO
Research Queensland - mixed up. M.W.]

   Areas of flattened cane on Mr Walden's property are being
given wildly different interpretations, including a visit from
aliens.
   "I'd just been to Blackbutt when I got a message that all
this activity was happening." said Mr. Walden.
   Present in the otherwise empty field were news staff from
Channels 9 and 10, The Sunday Mail, and two flying saucer
believers who confessed they were absolutely riveted by what
they were seeing.
   "Ah well," said Mr. Walden philosophically. "Even if aliens
have landed, the cane'll harvest all right.
    "Maybe they'll have the technology to make the cane stand
up because it's a variety, Number 110 we call it, that lodges
(falls over).
   "I've been cane farming for 23 years and dad's been on the
property since the early Forties, and we've never seen any
signs yet of visitors from outer space.
   "But I'm not too worried about killing any aliens when I
fire the cane."
   Mr. Scott, who was with fellow UFO bureau member Carlo Riva,
from Traveston, said: "We've just had the most incredible
experience, the two of us.
   "I've seen a lot of crop circles in the UK and they are very
precise and symmetrical. What we got in the canefields is
incredible ... rectangles, they've sculpted the cane." [there
is no evidence of this in the photograph.]
  And who are they?
  "It's an intelligence from outer space,"  said Mr. Scott.
"It's not local people. It's got to be extraterrestrial
intelligence.
   "It's like somebody's been up with a laser tool and sculpted
it with a complexity you can't believe.
   "Somehow or other there's a message in these things."
   Mr. Walden said: "If aliens have landed, I might have to get
a few more cartons of XXXX so I can shout them a drink."
