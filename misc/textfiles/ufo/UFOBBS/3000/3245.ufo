Description and Purpose:
The Center for the Study of Extraterrestial Intelligence (CSETI) is an
international nonprofit scientific research and education organization
dedicated to the understanding of Extraterrestial Intelligence (ETI) and
Extraterrestail Civilizations (ETC). CSETI is especially interested in
the ETI-Human relationship and in the peaceful furtherance of this
relationship. A thorough review of existing data and documents
concerning 'UFOs' indicates that the earth has been visited by ETI and
Extraterrestial Spacecraft (ETS) for decades, if not centuries, and that
this contact has intensified over the past 45 years. The existence and
authentication of several top-secret documents confirming the retrieval
of crashed ETS and their occupants, the numerous photographs and films
showing ETS, the reports of thousands of credible civilian and military
observers, and the presence of associated landing traces all provide
compelling evidence for the ongoing contact between ETI and humans. In
addition to the investigation and analysis of credible ETI/ETS reports,
CSETI is committed to the thoughtful long term development of bilateral
ETI-Human communication and exchange, and open public education on the
subject. We regard this endeavor as the most important scientific and
educational project of the next thousand years, and invite you to join
us. CSETI is supported through the voluntary efforts and contributions
of its friends around the world, and we welcome your involvement right
now!

The CSETI Principles:
* There is strong evidence for the existence of Extraterrestial
Intelligence, Civilizations, and Spacecraft.

* ETI/ETS have been and are currently visiting Earth.

* Careful bilateral communication between ETI and Humans is of
continuing importance and will probably increase in the future.

* CSETI approaches the study of ETI with cooperative, peaceful and
non-harmful intentions and procedures.

* The establishment of a lasting world peace is essential to the full
development of the ETI-Human relationship.

* Both Humans and ETI, as conscious, intelligent beings, are essentially
more alike than dissimiliar; CSETI is dedicated to the study of both our
shared and unique characteristics.

* CSETI operates on the premise that ETI motives and ultimate intentions
are net peaceful and non-hostile.

* It appears probable that more than one Extraterrestial Civilization is
responsible for the ETI/ETS contact so far observed, and that it is
likely that this represents a cooperative effort.

* CSETI will attempt to cultivate bilateral ETI-Human contact and
exchange which will serve peaceful and cooperative goals; it is NOT a
goal of CSETI to acquire those advanced technologies which may have a
potentially military or harmful application if disclosed prematurely.

MAJOR PROGRAMS OF CSETI:

The CE-5 Initiative
is a major projrct whose goal is the further development of bilateral
and human-initiated ETI contact. This project involves scientists and
investigators, and is a long-term project of CSETI.

Project ETI-Inform
is a major public education program which utilizes the media, public
lectures and symposia and printed materials to inform the public and
government, officials throughout the world. The goal of this program is
to provide quality programming on ETI to all sectors of the public.

Rapid Mobilization Investigative Teams (RMIT)
are comprised of qualifoed scientists and investigators who can respond
swiftly to an area of ongoing ETI/ETS contact. Cases of high scientific
and investigative merit and credibility will be considered for this
special investigative approach, particularly when they also have the
potential for CE-5 Initiative involvement. The development and funding
of RMIT is a major goal of CSETI.

CSETI Conferences and Workshops
are designed to facilitate in-depth analysis and 'think tank'
formulations and planning on all aspects of ETI studies. Specific topics
include, but are not limited to, the following: Human initiated ETI
contact, the origins and motives of current ETI visitors, ETI biology,
anatomy, physiology, and medical implications; peaceful applications of
ETI technology and the 'new physics'; philosophical and spiritual
implications of ETI contact; possible risks and benefits to ETI arising
from human contact; the effect of ETI contact on the world's societies
and governments; shared and unique characteristics of ETI and humans;
world peace and unity as a prerequisite for extensive ETI contact and
exchange; diplomatic, governmental and security issues surrounding
ETI-Human contact.
