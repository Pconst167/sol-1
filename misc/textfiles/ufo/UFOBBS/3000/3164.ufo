Calvin Parker was the young man who was with Charles Hickson in the
Pasagoula, Mississippi incident. Calvin has finally come out of hiding and
will be telling his story of that incident. He is in the process of writing a
book with the help of Bill Roberson a news broadcaster that did the orginal
story in that area.
   Calvin just finished a taping with Budd Hopkins for a up comming series
called "In Contact". It should be available for viewing in about 45 to 60
days.
  If anyone out there think these Aliens that are doing the abductions are
sweet little guys from another part of the universe, listen to what Calvin
has to sayBudd Hopkins put Calvin under hypnosis the night before (first time
for Calvin) and when Calvin got on the show, he was madder than hell. Don't
miss this show when it is aired. He will tell how he grab the Alien (a
female) by the ears (yes, she was more human looking then Alien according to
Calvin) and bash her head against the wall until black substance came running
out of her eyes and ears. What happens after this--- wait for the showing.
