    It's interesting how Strieber describes these visitors as being "simple,
natural" -- I never told you about "my Gray", have I? Except the Gray was
never called a Gray -- this was called a "Giff" (from the tribe of Pau, the
elders). The concepts arose a long time ago. It will be nearly ten years
soon. They dominated my every waking thought clear up until a about a year
after moving to Flagstaff. They just waned and no longer preoccupied my
thoughts because I was busy putting my BBS together.

   "Amusing, very intelligent, clever, outspoken, whimsical, philsophical,
jesting, simple, mirthful. Passive, peacefull, high moral standards and will
not lie." (according to the concept, due to their nature they were incapable
of lying and cannot comprehend "lie". We know how to lie quite well and
sometimes don't even realize we do it because we can subconsciously lie to
ourselves).

    "Short, little, stunted, dimunitive. Strong in character, mentally
strong. Feet too big for his size. Long arms. Bald. No facial hair
whatsoever.... glaborous (best word I could come up with which means having a
surface without hairs or projection)."

     "Their basic facial features are a round head, slight tapering chin and
a thin nose with small nostrils... their lips are thin too.."

     "Heighth: 3'6" "

      "Huge dark compelling eyes that can pierce to the very soul and read
the heart. The mind is dual, plural in nature. There is a split brain."

And, from "The Histories" --

      "It is surprising because they are such a simple people, and they dwell
in the "Hollows" where rock and sand and soil have strange, ominous
formations... and it is here they carve their homes. They are very
intelligent.... although the Fairskins think otherwise."

Again --

      "Even though they don't appear to be, they are very intelligent
sentients... and keep to the simple things... for the elder Giff, keepers of
the ages past know about what caused the great catastrophe... it was their
forefathers who created the situation -- and what was once a great race, had
nearly destroyed themselves totally, and what has come out of it is a simple
philosophy of life that runs deeper than understanding itself.... for
nevermore do they want to be responsible for mass destruction... even thought
some things are vauge... and so are details, this is why the Fairskinned
think them to be so primitive and unworthy. So what was once strong, has been
drawn to simplicity through the ages, and what was once weak has grown into
power."

Any of it sound familiar to you? I may not be able to reflect through
Whitley, but I can reflect through the conceptuals as I am mentally
comprehend them. But, of course, there is absolutely no way anyone can
provide proof of what is inside of my head and I'm not going to try and prove
anything. I just want to discuss it.
