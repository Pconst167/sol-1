            (Ted)     Ok let's get started. Does anyone have an opening
                      remark? ga

            (DBC)     Yes, I just saw a piece on CNN news about the
                      sightings) in VA over the last several months. Its
                      seems they had some sort of conference with dan
                      gordon complaining about lack of  big media
                      coverage. ga

            (Ted)     Anyone else see the CNN coverage also DBC when was
                      it on today? GA

            (DBC)     yes, just about an hour ago.ga

            (Ted)     It seems, that Dan Gordon could supply Drax with
                      fodder for his JFORUM controversy. GA

            (DRAX)    I mentioned the Wytheville thing in the original
                      message on JFORUM. You saw the reaction. "Ho-hum."
                      GA

            (Ted)     Yes, perhaps now you could get some support. ga

            (DRAX)    Care to place a wager? Ha!

            (MJ-C)    Hi,could everyone identify himself/herself, so we
                      can know to whom we are talking.  The list of
                      users is not of much help. Thanks.

            (Dale)    hahahaha, I tried that Marge. No you can't

            (Ted)     Ok, one more time... I'm Ted Markley. Others GA

            (DRAX)    Jim Speiser

            (Joe)     Joe Reichardt

            (DON)     Don Ecker

            (Gerry)   There is a directory function where people have
                      left short descriptions of themselves.

            (Gerry)   I'm Gerry Zeitlin

            (Ted)     Ok, I guess thats all that care to reveal.  Marge
                      if you would hit a CR after about 60 characters or
                      so you don't go off the screen. GA

            (DRAX)    Yes, but its optional, and sometimes doesnt match
                      with CO handles. GA

            (Gerry)   Can it be searched for user id?

            (DRAX)    Yes












            (MJ-C)    ?Thanks! I appreciate it.  How do I get to the
                      directory function?

            (Ted)     Marge, In the main menu there is a member
                      directory entry try that GA.

            (Ted)     There have been some new developments last week
                      one or two DRAX has up loaded also I have heard
                      rumors that Gulf Breezes is falling under
                      question.  Any comments? GA

            (MJ-C)    Yes, I remembered ALT-S.  Both Bob Boyd and Dr.
                      Willy Smith have some doubts about Gulf Breeze
                      case now Bob Boyd has compiled a 19-pt. letter
                      stating his problems with the case.  Dan Wright
                      has a copy. Bruce Maccabee is analyzing film from
                      there and will speak on the photoanalysis at MUFON
                      Symposium in Nebraska.  Gulf Breeze witnesses will
                      be at Neb. Am I doing this correctly or should I
                      wait to be recognized to type message?

            (Ted)     Ok, just a reminder to those new to our CO.  We
                      operate under formal rules.  If you want to ask a
                      question or make a comment type a "?" or a "!" and
                      I will take down you name and put you in queue.

            (DRAX)    OK, Ted. Just wanted to ask if CNN had anything on
                      Gulf Breeze, and also Marge, you might want to
                      quickly identify those names for people who are
                      unfamiliar to the field (but do it in queue so as
                      not to confuse people). GA

            (DON)     Ok, a quick one, is there anyway to get a copy, of
                      the local Fla. broadcast of the Gulf Breeze news
                      tape?  ga

            (Ted)     Can any one answer That? GA

            (DRAX)    John Lear was sent a copy FedEx, I can ask him how
                      he got it. GA

            (Ted)     Good.  Do that GA

            (DON)     I tried to call Lear, no answer is he out flying?
                      ga

            (Ted)     Drax can you comment? I've gotten busy also. GA

            (DRAX)    He may be. Try later. GA

            (DON)     thanks..

            (Ted)     Marge perhaps you could fill us in on some of the
                      names you dropped earlier. GA












            (MJ-C)    Dan Wright is MUFON's Dir. of Investigations;  Dr.
                      Willy Smith is a physicist in Florida and he runs
                      a computer program called UNICAT with the most
                      credible cases.  Bruce Maccabee is an optical
                      physicist whose specialty is photoanalysis. Hope
                      this helps to fill you in on names I mentioned.

            (Dale)    Can anyone supply me with some  paperwork on the
                      proper way to handle an F.O.I.A. request??

            (DRAX)    Dale, do you get the International UFO Reporter
                      from CUFOS? There was an article by Don Schmitt, I
                      believe, which went through the groundrules. I can
                      send it to you if you want. GA

            (Dale)    OH. I must have it around here, but missed the
                      article will let you know. Thanks. GA

            (MJ-C)    I Suggest that you contact Barry Greenwood of
                      CAUS,(MJ-C) at Mass MUFON,. P.O. Box 176,
                      Stoneham, MA 02180

            (Ted)     Marge, can you tell us a little about UNICAT ?GA

            (MJ-C)    I am not exactly certain of the status of UNICAT
                      at present time.  at one time it had 400 cases,
                      and Willy Smith had a form with criteria and
                      information he required for listing a case there./
                      If you'd like I can furnish his address., but
                      would prefer to mail it to you rather than to put
                      it on computer.

            (MJ-C)    Ted, I got your EMail.  thanks!  I put a notice in
                      this month's MUFON Newsletter asking for persons
                      with modems to join in this ISSUES forum on
                      Sundays.

            (Dale)    Thanks Marge.ga

            (Ted)     Great, I think there would be a lot of mutual
                      benefit to ISSUES and MUFON to cooperate.  OkGA

            (MJ-C)    Are you aware of the recent letter sent by Richard
                      Doty to Barry Greenwood of CAUS in which he
                      reverses his stand on the Kirtland AFB sightings
                      from OSI document, 1980? ga

            (Ted)     No, Tell us more. GA

            (MJ-C)     Doty authored the documents which detail 5
                      overflights of UFOs (disc-shaped in one case) over
                      Manzano Weapons Storage Area at Kirtland AFB in
                      summer of 1980/  He also met with Peter Gersten
                      (NY attorney of CAUS) and Linda Howe at that time












                      and told them more about the sightings.  He now is
                      denying that he said the things they claim that he
                      said, and cites official AF policy, and asks that
                      no one contact him again.  The letter will be
                      published in the next issue of JUST CAUS  (CAUS=
                      citizens against UFO Secrecy).

            (DON)     Ok Drax, two questions for you. First is there any
                      more information on the Texarkana case, and the
                      most recent msgs that you sent to our board in
                      Boise concerned Gulf Breeze and two agents of some
                      kind bearing a warrant to seize info. Ok, do you
                      or anyone know who they were, and what kind of
                      warrant was it, and issued by whom?  Fed, local
                      etc. and were they genuine?   ga

            (DRAX)    OK, On Texarkana, no new information that I've
                      gotten, except a possible correlation with another
                      case just being reported by Washington State MUFON
                      (Don Johnson), a pilot reported seeing a "box-
                      shaped" UFO near Edwards AFB. Some of the Tex
                      witnesses reported a similar sounding craft. As to
                      the warrants, I only mentioned that the main
                      witness reported having two guys in civvies come
                      to his door and wave a "Material Seizure Warrant"
                      at him to confiscate the photos and camera. He did
                      not turn them over. I know nothing beyond that.
                      Don;t know if it or they were genuine or not. GA

            (DON)     Ok, in some corners this has the appearance of a
                      classic beginning of possible "MIB" interference.
                      do you know if there were any other attempts to
                      gather info, or breakins, etc, and was the witness
                      threatened?  Did he report to the local law
                      enforcement?  ga

            (DRAX)    Alas, Don, you're asking for details I'm just not
                      privy to. This whole schmear is unfolding as we
                      speak, and its hard to get a handle on just what
                      is happening or has happened, especially since
                      most of what we have heard on this side of the
                      country is second or third hand. The details are
                      going to spill out, they will just take some time.
                      GA

            (Dale)    I'd like to switch topics a second. Marge, has
                      MUFFON, in Texas, had any problems over the JMP
                      letter stating that people would write to Andrus?
                      And, received any letters? on this hoax document.
                      ga

            (MJ-C)    Gulf Breeze newspaper reports two uniformed AF
                      investigators visited one of the anonymous
                      photographers and demanded the photographs. He did












                      not have them to turn over.   No, M<UFON in Texas
                      has not had any problems that I know of over the
                      JMP letter, but Walt Andrus is putting a notice in
                      the Journal stating that MUFON is not in any way
                      involved with that group, nor will we accept any
                      mail for them. Speaking of MIBs, MIchigan MUFON is
                      reporting several incidents involving some sort of
                      surveillance, including black unmarked helicopters
                      over homes of witnesses; investigators' mail being
                      sloppily opened and resealed with scotch tape and
                      telephones being tapped.  Dan Wright has put a
                      note of warning to all State Directors in his
                      latest newslett er  to indicate if they have
                      sealed and reopened letters.  Is Big  Brother
                      Watching, or are we just getting paranoid? ga

            (DBC)     Marge, what part of MI are these things happening?
                      I'm in MI and have heard nothing. I have, however,
                      waking in the night a few times by what sounded
                      like a helicopter. (Prob. no connection>) ga

            (MJ-C)    They are mostly in the Lansing area and in
                      Flushing.) ga

            (Dale)    I was just wondering if everyone knew that if you
                      make a phone call and it is done through the
                      satellite, that the NSA makes transcripts and then
                      goes through it for buzz words.ga

            (DRAX)    They must be having a field day with THIS
                      conversation, then!

            (DON)     does ma bell know?

            (Ted)     Yes. I have heard that also.  So you better watch
                      out, you better not try. GA

            (Gerry)   Also have some thoughts about this buzzword
                      monitoring. I'm sure they do it, but I also know
                      the technology for speech recognition is still
                      pretty primitive except perhaps at NSA but
                      actually it is difficult for machines to recognize
                      words unless they are trained to recognize them
                      when spoken by specific speakers.ga

            (DRAX)    Its my understanding that the NSA is about five
                      years ahead of the rest of the world in computer
                      technology also, my gosh, the Sharper Image offers
                      telephones with speech recognition capabilities,
                      that don't require training! GA

            (MJ-C)    I have been told about the NSA monitoring phone
                      calls by satellite.  Someone from A T & T told me
                      that.  Also, all overseas calls are recorded by












                      NSA.  I also have reports of strange happenings on
                      calls to Indiana from Michigan. ga

            (Ted)     What kind of happenings? GA

            (MJ-C)    Michigan investigators called Indiana from a home
                      of a friend and got the same phone interference he
                      got when calling that investigator at his Michigan
                      home from the caller's Michigan home. ga

            (Gerry)   Have to agree with the replies to my comment. I
                      guess I should have thought it through more
                      carefully.ga

            (DON)     Ok, this phone interference phenomena is an old
                      story in ufology, it go's back over 30 years, and
                      Keel addressed it in several of his books rather
                      well. So it would appear that whoever is doing it
                      has had the tech. for quite a while.  ga

            (Dale)    I was just going to say that I don't think that
                      there is anyone here who hasn't had to send
                      something 2 to 3 times in the mail for it to get
                      where it was suppose to go and has anybody that
                      you know of ever filed with NSA for FOIA request
                      on whether they had a file with your name on it,
                      or are they exempt, since we don't even know what
                      their charter says. ga

            (Dale)    NSA = National Security Agency

            (Ted)     I don't think you apply to the NSA for FOIA
                      information.

            (DRAX)    Just wanted to know if anyone had any thoughts on
                      APRO finally calling it quits. Did you know about

            (Ted)     I think it is a shame.  Someone should pick up the

                      that there is only 1 real civilian organization
                      left.ga

            (DRAX)    According to Tom Mickus of ParaNet Pi in Toronto a
                      letter was sent out by an APRO underling whose
                      name escapes me saying that Coral is just in such
                      poor shape that she cannot continue publishing,
                      and the membership is dwindling steadily. The

            (Dale)    By civilian, I meant that MUFON, I believe is the
                      only organ that allows a low life like me to bee a
                      State Section Director I don't believe CUFO's does

            (MJ-C)    NSA is not exempt under the FOIA. We have NSA
                      documents. I didn't know about APRO.  Sad!  Jim,
                      should we go to ask Coral to donate the files to
                      the U of A? I doubt if she would let MUFON have
                      them, but there must be a wealth of case info.
                      there.

                      going to be in Phoenix on May 14 with the CUFOS

            (DRAX)    I didn't know the photo exhibit would be there
                      too, though I think we would have to pry the files
                      from Coral's cold fingers. But t'would be nice to
                      give them to U of A (or maybe Barry? Ha!) GA

            (DBC)     This is probably totally coincidental but I
                      noticed on the last couple of COs there have been
                      2 to 3 users (SIG, monitoring? or handles) showing
                      a node DCE which is Arlington VA...Isn't that CIA
                      headquarters and where is NSA?ga

            (Ted)     AH HA. The SOURCE is located in Arlington VA,
                      Those Thieves!!!! <ga don>

            (DON)     Ok, I've read from dl last year on one co.  that
                      Phil Kl ass had his "people monitor this ch. so if
                      various reports are correct that our govt. takes
                      this subj. seriously, do you really think that
                      they would not have a vested interest in
                      monitoring this forum. no, I didn't think so.  I
                      guess it really is past 1984, eh??  ga

            (Gerry)   NSA is at Ft. Meade, MD. You have to assume that
                      this conference is in the open. But why get
                      paranoid about it?. Anyway, NSA is very large and
                      I would expect there to be interested folks there
                      just as anywhere else.ga

            (Ted)     Ok. You know anyone of us might be associated with
                      NSA. Perhaps... But no! GA

            (Dale)    If you want to know about the NSA, read "The
                      Puzzle Palace" by John Bamford...Also, Klass does
                      have spies in the wings they send all my local
                      stuff to Klass from Free-Net in Cleveland lastly,
                      my sister in law worked for NSA, and they have
                      orders after they are out to report anyone that
                      tries to talk to them about their activities up to
                      5 years after separation.ga












            (Ted)     Ok. Mike welcome. Just a reminder to those new to
                      our CO.  We operate under formal rules.  If you
                      want to ask a question or make a comment type a
                      "?" or a "!" and I will take down you name and put
                      you in queue.

            (DBC)     speaking of sensitive issues, anyone know anything
                      new about the ontario triangle? Did Neil P get
                      scared off by someone loading last week's CO in
                      DL10? Ted did you speak to him by phone? also has
                      anyone found the map????!!!!ga

            (Ted)     Ok. Yes I spoke to Neil Yesterday.  HE said he.
                      could not be with us tonight but would be back
                      nest week.  I asked Neil to prepare a White Paper
                      similar to the one prepared by John Lear.  I asked
                      that he be sure to include VERIFIABLE facts such
                      that we may investigate and be prepared to ask
                      more meanful questions.GA

            (DON)     Earlier we were talking about paranoia in the
                      connection with the govet or NSA. it is not a case
                      of paranoia, but everyone should be aware that the
                      govt takes these cases much more seriously than
                      they let on.  ga

            (Randy P) Yes...I reviewed Publications of the U. S.
                      Geological Survey, 1971-1981, and cannot locate
                      any citations which would relate to Neil Palumbo's
                      case.  I have not done a full DIALOG search but
                      did establish that an Aerogmagnetic Map of
                      Westernmost New York is contained in the USG (open
                      file) OF 75-0028, and an in depth seismic survey
                      consisting of high-resolution seismic reflection
                      profiles and sediment samples from Western Lake
                      Ontario is contained in OF 80-0550.  I cannot find
                      any evidence which would corroborate Neil's
                      claims, however.  I will mention that the classic
                      book in this area is Ivan Sanderson's Invisible
                      Residents, which mentions sightings like Neil's in
                      the same area.  ga...

            (Ted)     Thanks Randy.  That was a nice piece of
                      investigative work. I hope you can return next
                      week when (if) Neil returns.

            (Randy P) I have an upload which goes into further depth
                      which I will put up later...ga

            (Ted)     Mike did you want to make a comment? GA

            (MIKE)    Not aware of all you're talking about














            (Ted)     Mike - ok, just sit back and listen (read) we're
                      talking about UFOs and related issues. <ga>

            (Gerry)   Ok.  I spoke to a friend at Ames who suggested
                      that the area would be better covered by LANDSAT,
                      not SEASAT and that NASA was forced to divest of
                      the distribution of these photos but that if I
                      would tell her the coordinates and times needed,
                      she would tell me which photos to get and how to
                      get them.  I sent email to Neil about this but he
                      did not reply.ga

            (Ted)     Neil doesn't get on too often.  BTW did you all
                      know that you can see who has been in the ISSUES
                      forum (or any other for that matter) by typing "u"
                      at most "!" prompts?  <GA>

            (Randy P) Thanks...anyone can obtain the satellite
                      images...I have an upload which goes into some
                      depth on how to get these, including the reference
                      numbers for all the LANDSAT catalogs for use in
                      any university library which is a Congressionally
                      designated Government Depository Library.  From
                      Neil's description, I believe he has a LANDSAT
                      image (originally ERTS).  In order to validate the
                      in water image he believes he is seeing, it would
                      be necessary to look at several loops from the
                      bird...each locale in the U. S. is imaged once
                      every 18 hours in four spectral bands.  ga...

            (Ted)     Please upload you're file into the DL10 Database.
                      GA

            (Gerry)   I'm not surprised to hear how available these
                      images are.  Actually I was wondering exactly what
                      I had volunteered to do.  Decided it was just to
                      open a dialog with an interested person at Ames.
                      And I did get a suggestion as to a non-paranormal
                      explanation. Mind you I'm not by nature a
                      "debunker" in the worst sense of the term.  But I
                      was told that zooplancton could be responsible for
                      what Neil saw. They form quite large formations
                      and local currents can make them be repeatable
                      over long periods of time.  ga

            (Randy P) I don't doubt that Neil has seen strange things
                      entering and leaving the lake...as this is well
                      documented and has been going on up there for
                      several years.  However, I doubt that he is seeing
                      a structure in the satellite image.  Normally,
                      perfectly clear water would appear black in the
                      false colored composite image made from the four
                      spectral images.  One needs to view the black-and-













                      white individual shots from each spectral band.
                      ga...

            (Ted)     When I spoke to Neil I asked him if perhaps he was
                      seeing planes disappearing in the horizon at
                      night. He said he didn't believe that was so.
                      Then I ask how BIG were these things (expecting to
                      get points of light)  he said "about the size of a
                      quarter at arms length." FOr what its worth that
                      is it. he also claims top be using "color" IR
                      Kodak film.  Now I don't know too much about IR
                      film but IR is just another wavelenght as are
                      colors. (Unless there is some Pseudo colorization
                      technique. ANy comments? GA

            (Randy P) He may be using color film with an IR filter...but
                      the size he describes for the lights he is seeing
                      doesn't agree with some of the sightings over the
                      Great Lakes which Sanderson, et. al. have
                      documented over the years.  I am fairly familar
                      with photoimagery, and have never heard of a color
                      IR film. ga

            (Ted)     Neil claims that the film he is using is KODAK IR
                      35 mm film. (Not color film with an IR filter.)
                      We use IR film in some of the products that are
                      manufactured at my company.  (We use an IR laser
                      diode)  I have asked our chemist/film people to
                      contact Kodak for more info....

            (Ted)     By the way,  I hope all of you have, or get, the
                      opportunity to read. my message board on
                      "QUESTIONNAIRE"  it is suggesting a "brain trust"
                      if you will of ISSUES members. GA

            (DON)     Ivan Sanderson, and the book he wrote "Invisible
                      Residents?" I am not familar with it, could you
                      discuss what the subject covers?  ga

            (Randy P) The book Invisible Residents is by a fairly
                      legitimate scientific type (Ivan Sanderson), so
                      should be available in many libraries.  It is
                      probably the classic work on sightings of unusual
                      "vehicles" entering and leaving bodies of water.
                      The book also covers many other types of sightings
                      of "balls of light", dissappearance of crews of
                      ships, and other odd happenings over water.  I
                      believe it was the first place where I saw any
                      theories of "vortices", and its chapters 10 and 11
                      are a classic reference on this subject as well.
                      I recommend it to anyone interested in getting
                      some background on what Neil Palumbo is talking
                      about.    I'm going to have to check out in a

                      for books, etc. and I know it is  difficult. I

                      Foundation.  GA

            (Gerry)   I know it's getting late but I did wonder if
                      anyone had read the file on "1st Earth Battalion"
                      which is in the veterans' forum and if anyone has
                      any thoughts about it.ga

            (Ted)     Gerry. Which dl is it in and what is th eactual
                      name of the forum? ga

            (DON)     Vetsig

            (Gerry)   standby and I'll ... right, vetsig ... but
                      standby... it's vetsig/dl7/earth.1st and it refers
                      to a unit of "warrior monks" of the US Army which
                      was trained in psychic warfare and which has just
                      been disbanded.ga

            (DON)     Where is John Lear when we need him?

            (Ted)     We'll) look it up.

            (MIKE)    Speaking of Lear. Has anybody heard of video
                      release to press yet ALA Lear.txt?

            (Ted)     No. Mike do you have reason to believe there is
                      one? GA

            (MIKE)    I thought he mentioned a tape to be released in
                      March?!














            (Ted)     Ok, he mentioned a tape that he had which was just
                      a collection of previously released stuff.) Also
                      he claimed that there would be a "Big
                      Announcement" soon but didn't get specific.   GA

            (Joe)     Where can I get a list of BBS's that cover UFO
                      material?  GA

            (Ted)     Ok, I can't give you a list but a good bet is to
                      get a list of PARANET BBS.  Jim SPeiser (DRAX) is
                      the chief honcho of ParaNet.  ANd it is based in
