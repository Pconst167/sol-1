                     MYSTERIOUS ELF SOUND AGONIZES NEW MEXICO;
                             SPREADS ACROSS THE NATION

       In the desolate  hills  and canyons of New Mexico, the land is alive
       with some strange phenomenon that  pulsates  in  the  hearts  of the
       people, driving them to exhaustion, distraction and  illness.   That
       phenomenon is known  simply  as  "The Sound".  Is it some top-secret
       underground operation in an area known for its legends about Area 51
       and alien bases? Is it an underground generator? Water? Wind? Or is,
       as some claim, "the voice of God" demanding attention?
 
       The Phoenix Foundation   was   recently    asked   to   conduct   an
       investigation by dozens of people whose lives are being  torn  apart
       by a throbbing,  pulsating  noise  that results in severe headaches,
       nausea, illnesses and even broken  marriages.  There's no doubt "The
       Sound" is real.
 
       Dana Hougland, an acoustic engineer with the firm of  David L. Adams
       Associates, Inc. of   Denver,  brought  her  equipment  to  Taos  in
       response to a plea for help from Catanya  Saltzman  and her husband,
       Bob, who contacted the Phoenix Foundation.
 
       Hougland, who said  her  interest was sparked by Catanya's  detailed
       records of the  sound,  identified it as being some sort of powerful
       pulse of 17 hertz, with overtones  up to 70 hertz. The Environmental
       Protection Agency has   ruled   these  frequencies   "psychoactive",
       meaning they have pronounced and harmful biological effects.
 
       The story of  "The  Sound"  reeks  with  drama.  The  Saltzmans have
       received telephone threats warning  them  to  "back  off" and "don't
       stick your nose  into something that's none of your  business."  The
       Taos News has  also received anonymous threats.  Marriages have been
       ruined because some people hear it  - or feel it - and others don't.
       The normal range for human hearing begins at about  20-30 hertz, but
       women and children  are more sensitive to these frequencies - and to
       higher frequencies - than men, according  to  video display terminal
       and other studies.
 
       Hougland is very skeptical that the sound is related to underground
 
                                      Page 1
 
 
 
 
 
       activities at nearby  Los Alamos National Laboratory, about 56 miles
       away.  "That would be a world record," she said, citing the distance
       a sound travels  through  any  medium   but  open  water  before  it
       dissipates.  The sound is low and the waves so elongated,  she said,
       that some people  can feel it vibrating inside their chests.  "Other
       constant sound exposure with pure-tone  components" - like prolonged
       traffic noise or the sound one hears flying inside  a  jet  -  often
       result in complainst  of  discomfort  and  illness  similar to those
       reported in several cities in New  Mexico  and  now in other states,
       such as Michigan and Texas.
 
       The most apparent  culprits,  Hougland  says,  are  a  local  sewage
       treatment plant, power  lines  spanning  the Rio Grande Gorge, large
       underground machinery, large tunnels  or  mine  shafts through which
       wind and/or water  is  moving in large volumes at high  speeds.  But
       that fails to explain similar sounds in far-off locations.  "I'm not
       ruling anything out,"  she  said.  "It  would  take  an awful lot of
       energy to transfer the sound waves out of the ground and through the
       air."
 
       Attempts to pinpoint a source, even with triangulation methods, have
       been fruitless. Also, Hougland is  skeptical  about  natural sources
       because the sound wasn't noticed until suddenly in about June 1991.
       "I'm sure the  sound  is there," she said. "There  is  a  legitimate
       problem here to  be l;ooked at. But we're not dealing with something
       horribly bizarre her4e. It's probably  a very common source." Others
       aren't so sure.
 
       "We've been inundated with people claiming there are  aliens running
       around in underground bases," Catanya said. "But I do not believe in
       UFOs and aliens." Yet the possibility cannot be overlooked entirely.
       Catanya and most  of  her  Taos  neighbors are not familiar with the
       claims of people like Bill Hamilton  who claim extraterrestrials are
       living in huge underground bases near Groom Lake, Nevada, not far
       from Taos. When I placed an overlay of a map pinpointing  The  Sound
       locations over a  map  of  alleged  underground  alien  bases,  they
       matched almost precisely.
 
       The bizarre events at Groom Lake have been widely reported in People
       Magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Wall  Street  Journal,  Taos News and
       elsewhere.  Groom Lake  is  said  to be a testing ground  for  alien
       craft piloted by  human pilots working with extraterrestrials. It is
       known to be where the Stealth bomber  and fighter were developed and
       tested and where a new, saucer-shaped craft is being flown.  Another
       possibility - just  as coinspiratorial - is that the  government  is
       developing some kind  of  powerful,  extremely  low  frequency "mind
       control" weapon and testing it on  an  unwitting  population. An Air
       Force lieutenant at  Kirtland Air Force Base guardedly  acknowledged
       that the Air  Force was well aware of the complaints - and wanted to
       know why we wanted to know more.
 
       The sound is  hauntingly  familiar   to  the  Woodpecker  Signal,  a
       psychoactive Soviet pulse  beamed  worldwide  at   10   hertz   that
       disrupted global communications,  aircraft  flights, and even - some
       say - the weather. It was the same  signal  beamed at the US Embassy
       in Moscow since  1963  that  caused  a  dramatic increase  in  birth
       defects and cancer among embassy personnel. Two ambassadors in a row
       died of cancer  and  a  third,  Walter  Stoessel, left with bleeding
       eyes. President Kennedy authorized Operation Pandora, a top-secret

       investigation. The report is still top-secret.
 
       The Phoenix Foundation,  through the Freedom of Information Act, has
       obtained once-classified documents  from  the  CIA  and DIA (Defense
       Intelligence Agency) that  prove  beyond  a  doubt that  the  United
       States has developed  this  technology  as  a  weapon "to mold human
       behavior in a manner consonant with  national  plans."  The judge in
       the Judas Priest "subliminal music" trial a few years  back  cited a
       litany of CIA use of "mind control" to influence national elections,
       but those written comments never made it into the mainstream press -
       or any news medium for that matter, until now.
 
       Catanya Saltzman, 44,  who is leading efforts to identify the source
       of this puzzle, first heard it in  May  1991 in her home eight miles
       south of Taos.  "In the middle of the night, it woke  me  up  and  I
       started running all  over the house for a place to get away from it,
       but I couldn't," she said. "At first, I thought somebody was digging
       a well or something." Her husband,  Bob,  a  photographer,  couldn't
       hear anything at first, then "snapped to it", he said.  "Once you've
       heard it, it's all over for you."
 
       The sound has been noted over a wide area - from Tres Piedras on the
       west to U.S>  Hill  on the east, and from 10 miles south of to a few
       miles north of Taos. It is heard at all times of the day, but mostly
       during the night and early morning  hours.  Coincidentally  perhaps,
       that is the time of day when the most intense activity  is  observed
       at Groom Lake.   Power  lines  were  the  first  suspect,  but  when
       electricity was cut off in the area due to a faulty transformer, the
       sound continued.  "The military conspiracy  is  the only one which I
       haven't entirely ruled out," Bob Saltzman said.   To  those  who are
       affected by it,  it  isn't funny.  "People are suffering from this,"
       said Catanya. "It's real. Your concentration is thrown off. My hands
       shake. It's hard to put words together . . . " "The hostility that's
       been directed at us is coming from  people  who  can't  hear  it and
       don't want to  know  about  it. It's like ostriches  sticking  their
       heads in the sand."
 
       The written threat  to "back off" was published in the June 18, 1992
       edition of the Taos News weekly newspaper:  "Stop snooping where you
       don't belong as far as 'the sound' is concerned. Someone  may end up
       getting hurt, so  you'd  better  cease before it's too late. We mean
       business. Don't pry into matters  that  don't  concern  you. You may
       find something you don't want to know. Beware."
 
       Editor Jess Williams said the unsigned, typed letter  with no return
       address bore an  Albuquerque postmark (common on internal Taos mail)
       and could be  either  a joke or a  serious  warning  to  either  the
       Saltzmans or to the Taos News.  Hougland's firm has  worked on sound
       insulation on 2,000  homes  around  Denver's  Stapleton  Airport and
       recent modifications of the city's  Boettcher Concert Hall. She said
       the 17-hertz signal carries a "rising harmonic" reaching  70  hertz.
       She said she, too, could plainly hear the sound.  She said a similar
       problem in Alabama  was  traced  to  a  large  ventilation fan in an
       underground mine. Pumps on sewage equipment can also emit vibrations
       in the sub-hearing range.
 
       Michael Valerio, water resource engineer  for  Taos,  said no recent
       additions have been  made to the plant that could  possibly  explain
       the noise. He also hears it at his home two miles from the plant.
 
                                      Page 3
 
 
 
 
 
       State Environment Department  environmentalist  Juan  Ortega visited
       the area twice. He also heard it, but is baffled for an explanation.
       U.S. Bureau of Land Management geologist Vickie Daniels said she and
       her two children can hear the pulse from their home on the west side
       of the Rio Grand Gorge. She has searched  in vain for the cause, and
       does not believe it is a natural phenomenon.  Neither  the Bureau of
       Land Management nor  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection Agency has
       equipment suitable to test for the source of the sound.
 
       "My hearing's very poor," said Sally  Howell, 79, who lives near the
       center of Taos, "but for maybe a year and a half I've  been  feeling
       these weird vibrations  in  different parts of my body - right where
       the ribs come together, inside my  ears and headaches." Paul Loumena
       and Alexandra Lorraine, owners of the Laughing Horse  Inn, stay in a
       motel two nights a week just to escape the terror.
 
       "My theory," Loumena says, "is the noise is above us and the town is
       in a swale.  Either that, ort the background noise of the town keeps
       us from hearing it (when we stay at  the  motel)." He suspects high-
       tension power lines.  Jon Samuelson, assistant to the vice president
       of external relations at Plains Electric Transmission and Generation
       Cooperative in Albuequerque, discounts that. The last change in area
       electricity transmission was when a new 345-kilovolt  line was built
       across the Rio Grand Gorge in 1981.
 
       K.C. Grams, of  Taos'  south  side,  said  her  husband doesn't hear
       anything, but she does. She replaced  her  home  heat pump - but the
       sound continued, even  from  15  miles away. She first  suspected  a
       neurological problem.  When during a function at her child's school,
       another mother asked  if  she  heard  the  hum,  she  said,  "My jaw
       dropped. I almost cried. It was very heartening . . . It's very hard
       to describe, especially a sound that  many  people don't hear. All I
       can say is that it affects me like scraping fingernails  against the
       blackboard. It's very irritating."
 
       "The Sound" has  been  reported  in Albuquerque and in several other
       northwest New Mexico cities. Schatzie  Hubbell  and  her husband, of
       Santa Fe, are among several who are trying to sell  their  home  and
       flee the state.  The Hubbles are going to Arizona.  "The most common
       theory we've heard is, 'Jesus is making this sound to wake you up,'"
       said Bob Saltzman.   A  Los  Alamos   resident,  Helen  F.  Stanbro,
       suggests a medical   cause.   "The  description  of   the   symptoms
       accompanying the sound   ("jaw   joint   pain,   nausea,   vertigo")
       immediately suggest an  inner  ear   problem  (infection?  Meniere's
       disease? Temporomandibular joint inflammation - TMJ?)"
 
       "In the case  of  the man who described the sound  as  'pulsating  -
       louder and softer  -  like  a slow heartbeat', it alarms me to think
       that it is  very likely to be exactly  that:  such  audible  carotid
       bruits are not uncommon and may signal serious condition  s  such as
       arteriovenous fistula, carotid  artery  disease  or  even  impending
       stroke."
 
       Tom Ladig of Taos suggests wind:
       "Out by the Stakeout Restaurant (site  of  the  Saltzman  occurence)
       there are power  poles  running  roughly east-west  along  the  main
       access road. These poles are set quite far apart and have dual lines
       well above the  trees.  Also,  there  exists  a perpendicular set of
       poles running roughly north-south in the vicinity." "What may happen
 
                                      Page 4
 
 
 
 
 
       is that the  wind  causes the wire to vibrate between the poles. Air
       in turn is set in motion with waves  radiating outwards at (for this
       system) subsonic frequencies.
 
       "A secondary phenomena must alkso be happening. Waves from different
       pole-line sets merge over distance and either reduce or add to their
       amplitudes. This would account for the energy to  rise  and  fall in
       intensity over time but still be subsonic."
 
       This past May, Albuquerque TV station KOB-Channel 4 broadcast a news
       brief about an underground geo-thermal shaft at Los Alamos which was
       built to probe  into  the earth's hot inner core. Some suspect that.
       "I live up at the Tierra Blanca,"  said  Peggy  S. SParks, "and have
       for 50 years. The noise out here is real, fairly  recent  in  origin
       and irritating as hell."
 
       "I only hear the noise at night, when the world is quiet. However, I
       had gotten to  be  quite an insomniac until I started using a fan or
       humidifier to block the saound out.   "I have spent hours outside at
       night trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. By  the process of
       elimination, the only  projects  in  the  last year or so that could
       create sound of this magnitude is  the  generator/pump  at  the golf
       course or the apparatus on top of Picuris Peak."
 
       What is that "apparatus"? No one knows, beyond it being some sort of
       radio transmission tower, perhaps for cellular phone transmissions.
       J.C. McLoughlin of  Talpa  puts  forth  one  of  the   most  bizarre
       theories: "I interviewed  'Moonhawk', a spiritual feminist. She says
       that deep within  the  Picuris  Mountains,   a   spaceship  full  of
       immortals from Uranus has lain buried for some 10,000 years. This is
       true; Moonhawk told me so. I'm not making this up.
 
       "The atmosphere of Uranus is composed of frigid clouds  of  ammonia,
       methane and other  gases  toxic  to  earthly life. Moonhawk says the
       aliens are digging  their  way  up  from  their  hundred  centuries'
       hiding; the basso  profundo we hear are from their  vast  excavating
       machines, and their  emergence  is  at hand.  "Not to worry, though,
       for these are feminist aliens, Moonhawk says, come to obliterate the
       patriarchy.
 
       "The Space Feminists are going to  pour forth from their hole like a
       horde of ammonia-quaffing killer hens from hell, to rid the world of
       wars, oppression, meat-eating,   social   injustice,    Republicans,
       tourism-based economic inequality,  suction-cup  Garfields,  airport
       extensions, golf courses and all  the  other  plagues  visited  upon
       long-suffering humanity by  the  ancient  ruling cabal  of  European
       males.  "Welcome to the UFO - Universal Feminist Order."
 
       Oh, well!  Rose  Woodell  of  Llano Quemado: "I, too, am hearing and
       feeling a low-frequency vibration dating back several months.  "When
       I leave the Taos Valley my physical  discomfort  (such as headaches,
       nausea, disorientation, etc.) disappear. I had previously thought it
       might be some sort of fallout from the Los Alamos area or a chemical
       spray.  "Could it be aliens? Nah, we'd be sending them foreign aid."
 
       Secret Military Studies
 
       September 18, 1990 - A tight lid of secrecy has been clamped on U.S.
       military studies of biological effects of electromagnetic field
 
                                      Page 5
 
 
 
 
 
       (EMF) radiation. The  Phoenix Foundation, through years of research,
       has accumulated a large database  of  information  dealing  with the
       biological effects of  EMF  and  is  the  only  civilian  non-profit
       research group in  America  specifically  chartered  to  explore the
       effects of Extremely  Low Frequency  (ELF)  electromagnetic  energy.
       Over the past  two  months,  the Foundation has released  dozens  of
       documents from its  files  pertaining  to  the  effects  of  EMF  on
       residents living near high-voltage  power  transmission  lines. "The
       time has come,"  says  Foundation Executive DirectorJim  Moore,  "to
       push this issue  into  the  public consciousness. For too many years
       the research has been classified 'for  reasons of national security'
       and has been  used  for advanced weapons research.'  The  Foundation
       claims to have  evidence that Americans may have been used as guinea
       pigs in nationwide    "mind    control"     experiments    involving
       electromagnetic fields. Adds Paul Brodeur, staff  reporter  for  The
       New Yorker and  author  of  several books, including "The Zapping of
       America": "Surely, if the questions  that  should  have  been  asked
       about the various applications of electromagnetic radiation continue
       to go unasked about future applications, this nation will one day be
       faced with a  public  health  disaster  of  monumental  and  perhaps
       irreversible proportions."
 
       The Phoenix Foundation  claims  that  the  reason  that  EMF  health
       effects continue to  be  denied   is   because   the   military  and
       electronics industry are  in  close cooperation over  what  to  make
       public about EMF  biological studies.  As an example, the Foundation
       cites a report  entitled  "Biological   Effects  of  Electromagnetic
       Radiation (Radio- waves   and   Microwaves)   -Eurasian    Communist
       Countries," prepared for the Defense Intelligence Agency by the Army
       Medical and Information  Agency  (you can order a copy of Report No.
       DST-181 0S- 074-76). This report  was  issued  in  March  1976  as a
       classified document. Most   of   its  contents,   26   pages,   were
       declassified in November  of  that year after Barton Reppert, of the
       Associated Press, wrote letters to  the  Pentagon requesting that it
       be made public  under the Freedom of Information Act.  The  Pentagon
       agreed, apparently to  help  win increased Congressional funding for
       electronics warfare systems.  After   acknowledging   in  a  summary
       section that microwave  exposure  standards  in Communist  countries
       ^'remain much more  stringent  than in the West," the report warned,
       "If the more  advanced  nations  of  the  West  are  strict  in  the
       enforcement of stringent exposure standards, there could be unfavora
       ble effects on industrial output and military functions."
 
       The DIA report  presents the rationale that "the Eurasian  Communist
       countries could, on  the  other  hand,  give  lip  service to strict
       standards, but allow their military  to  operate without restriction
       and thereby gain the advantage in electronic warfare  techniques and
       the development of   anti-personnel   applications."   Much  of  the
       declassified portion of  the  document   is  filled  with  obviously
       deliberate, but      unintentionalIy      comic,      contradiction,
       misinterpretation and omission,  the  Phoenix Foundation claims. For
       example, the first page of the summary says that "Eurasian Communist
       countries are actively involved  in  evaluation  of  the  biological
       significance of radiowaves  and  microwaves," while  the  next  page
       declares: "no significant   research   and   development   has  been
       identified that could be related  to  work  in  this  field  in  the
       People's Republic of  China,  North Korea and North  Vietnam.^'  The
       Soviet Union, in contrast, was not even mentioned in this paragraph.
 
 
                                      Page 6
 
 
 
 
 
       The entire middle   section  of  the  report,  entitled  "Biological
       Significance of Radiowaves and Microwaves,"  turns  out to be little
       more than a  general  review  of  well-known  studies  conducted  by
       Communist scientists from  1968  to 1975. Yet in its final paragraph
       of a section  entitled  "Trends,  Conclusions,  and  Forecast",  the
       authors reveal their most signifcant omission. Virtually  alI of the
       work whose usurpation  by  the  Communists  they are suggesting, and
       whose potentially disastrous consequences  they  are describing, was
       originally conducted by  Allen  Frey,  published   in   the  medical
       literature of the United States, and financed by the Office of Naval
       Research. That paragraph  states:  ^No  Eurasian  communist research
       activity has been  identified  which  can  be  clearly  or  directly
       related to any military offensive weapons program.  However,  soviet
       scientists are fully  aware  of  the biological effects of low-level
       microwave radiation which might have  offensive weapons application.
       Their internal sound  perception  research has great  potential  for
       development into a   system   for  disorienting  or  disrupting  the
       behavior patterns of military or diplomatic  personnel;  it could be
       used equally well as an interrogation tool.
 
       The Soviets have also studied the psychophysiological  and metabolic
       changes and the   alterations   of  brain  function  resulting  from
       exposure to mixed  frequencies  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  One
       physiological effect which has been demonstrated is  heart  seizure.
       This has been acomplished experimentally in frogs by synchronizing a
       pulsed ultra-high-frequency microwave  signal  of  low-average power
       density with the depolarization of  the  myocardium  and beaming the
       signal at the  thoracic area. A frequency probably  could  be  found
       which would provide  sufficient  penetration  of  the  chest wall of
       humans to accomplish the same effect.  Another  possibility  is  the
       alteration of the blood-brain barrier. This could allow  neurotoxins
       in the blood  to  cross.  As  a  result, an individual could develop
       severe neuropathological symptoms and either die or become seriously
       impaired neurologically.
 
       The next paragraph is even more chilling:  ^The  potential  for  the
       development of a numberofanti-personnel applications is suggested by
       the research published in the USSR, East Europe and the West. Sounds
       and possibly even    words   which   appear   to   be    originating
       intercranially can be  induced  by  signal  modulation  at  very low
       average power densities."
 
       (In the spring of 1973, Dr. Charles  C. Sharp and some colleagues at
       the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research conducted  an  experiment
       in which the  human  brain  received  a  message  carried to it by a
       pulsed microwave transmission. Sitting  in  an  anechoic chamber - a
       room with absorbent walls designed to prevent microwave reflection -
       Dr. Sharp was able to recognize spoken words that were  modulated by
       an audiogram -  a  graphic  representation  of  the sound waves that
       humans can hear - and that were  then  sent  into  the  chamber at a
       microwave frequency of  about  two  gigahertz.)  Later  in  the  DIA
       report, the authors  predict  that  the Soviets will continue to use
       internal sound perception,   perceptual    distortion    and   other
       psychophysiological effects, and   that   "the  results   of   these
       investigations could have   military  applications  if  the  Soviets
       develop methods for  disrupting or  disturbing  human  behavior."  A
       smalI portion of  this  DIA  report remains classified.  It  clearly
       indicates that the  US has been in volved in the development of such
       weapons for some years: ^A study published in 1972 by the U.S. Army

       Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center, titled "Analysis
       of Microwaves for  Barrier  Warfare^,  examines  the plausibility of
       using radio frequency energy in barrier-counterbarrier  warfare.  It
       discusses both anti-personnel and anti-materiel effects  for  lethal
       and non-lethal applications  for meeting the barrier requirements of
       delay, immobilization and  increased  target  exposure.  The  report
       concludes that:
 
            a.  It is possible to field a truck-portable microwave  barrier
                system that  will  completely  immobilize  personnel in the
                open with present-day technology and equipment.
 
            b.  There is a strong potential  for  a  microwave  system that
                would be capable of delaying or immobilizing  personnel  in
                vehicles.
 
            c.  With present technology no method could be identified for a
                microwave system  to  destroy  the type of armored materiel
                common to tanks."
 
       (NOTE: A television producer has  told  me  that a friend of his who
       was in a  band, went to the Gulf to entertain the troops.  Inflight,
       their sound equipment  was  lost,  but the military pulled up with a
       truckload "of the most sophisticated  sound  equipment  I  have ever
       seen in my life." When band members started to photograph the truck,
       they were stopped by military guards who told them  it was a highly-
       classified piece of  equipment  and could not be photographed. Other
       sources have told us they were puzzled when the Army placed powerful
       speaker systems throughout the desert  -  "but  no sound came out of
       them." An estimated 20,000 Gulf War veterans are now  suffering from
       the same symptoms  one  would find in the victims of electromagnetic
       non-ionizing radiation - aching teeth, jaws, joints, chronic fatigue
       syndrome, destroyed immune system,  etc. Still other sources tell us
       that this top-secret  ELF "barrier weapon" was used  against  Manuel
       Noriega in Panama;   the  "loud  rock  music"  blared  at  Noriega's
       hideaway was just a cover to mask  the real purpose of this powerful
       new weapon.)
 
       A bit later  in the same report, the authors reveal  that  the  U.S.
       Army Medical Research  Laboratory  at  Fort Knox, Kentucky conducted
       tests on microwave  burns,  using  human  guinea  pigs:  ^They  have
       produced third-degree burns  on  human  skin with twenty  watts  per
       square centimenter in two seconds, with frequencies of approximately
       two Gigahertz.^
 
       More than ten years ago, a CIA analyst suggested the same thing when
       asked to review Project Pandora, the still-secret investigation into
       the Soviet microwaves  beamed  at  the  U.S.  embassy in Moscow. Dr,
       Milton M. Zaret wrote: ^The primary emphasis of Soviet-bloc research
       on the biological effects of non-ionizing  electromagnetic radiation
       is concerned with   induced   neuro-physiological    or   behavioral
       aberrations. These may  be  either  inhibitory  or  excitatory;  the
       primary locus of action may be in  either  the peripheral or central
       nervous system, and  the effects may be reversible or  irreversible.
       Super-imposed upon these  three sets of variable are the concepts of
       thermal vs. non-thermal  effects,  the  role  of  continuous  versus
       pulsed waveform, and the degree of wavelength specificity.
 
       Although the various reports appear, at first glance, to represent a
 
                                      Page 8
 
 
 
 
 
       confused and conflicting  mass  of  data,  a  logical,  orderly  and
       meaningful pattern can be evolved  in  evaluating  their  data.  The
       basic factors which must constantly be borne in mind are
 
           (1) that microwave radiation is electromagnetic in nature,
           (2) that  the nervous system functions as an electronic  network
               normally shielded or protected from spurious fields and
           (3) that  when  extraordinary electromagnetic fields are created
               around neural  elements   this  can  produce  functional  or
               organic neurological anomalies.
 
       Zaret pointed out that Soviet research showed pulsed fields (such as
       those which appear  around  power  lines) were more  effective  than
       continuous radiation in affecting nervous system pathways.
 
       "For non-thermal irradiations, they believe that the electromagnetic
       field induced by   the   microwave   environment  affects  the  cell
       membrane, and this results in an  increase  of  excitability  or  an
       increase in the level of excitation of nerve cells. With repeated or
       continued exposure, the increased excitability leads  to  a state of
       exhaustion of the  cells of the cerebral cortex. This results in the
       Sechenov inhibition effect which is manifested by the elimination of
       positive conditioned reflexes or behavior.^
 
       This is the same result found in  studies  of  the  effects of power
       line fields on human cell samples. One hesitates  to  quote  such  a
       source as the  National  Enquirer,  but  the  response  this article
       elicited from the Department of Defense  warrants  it.  On  June 22,
       1976, the tabloid  reported  that  since 1973 the Advanced  Research
       Projects Agency had  been  sponsoring a program to develop a machine
       that could read minds from a distance  by  deciphering  the  brain^s
       magnetic waves.
 
       A scientist involved in the program had declared that  the  ultimate
       goal of his  work  was to exercise control over the brain. According
       to the article, scientists were  studying  various  aspects  of  the
       problem at the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  New  York
       University, the University  of  California  at  Los Angeles, and the
       National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center
       at Moffett AFB in California. The  amazing thing is that on November
       19, 1976, in a letter published in Paul Brodeur's "The Zapping of
       America^ and written by Robert L. Gilliat, Assistant General Counsel
       for Manpower, Health,  and  Public  Affairs  for the  Department  of
       Defense, the government confirmed such a machine actually exists:
       "As indicated in  my letter of November 12, information which I have
       received from the Advanced Research Projects Agency is to the effect
       that the so-called 'brain wave' machine,  which  was  the subject of
       the National Enquirer article . . . is not capable  of reading brain
       waves of anyone  other  than a willing participant in the laboratory
       efforts to develop     thatvparticularvdevice.     Its     technical
       limitations, I am told, do not permit any long range  use. I have no
       reason to doubt that information."
 
       What assurances do  Americans  have  that  this  will  ONLY  work on
       willing participants? The  implications   are   staggering.   It  is
       technologically possible that the entire power grid  of  the  nation
       could be used  not  only  as  a  means  of mind control "in a manner
       consonant with national plans" (as  put  in  a  top-secret  document
       submitted to the Warren Commission in 1964 by former CIA Director
 
                                      Page 9
 
 
 
 
 
       Richard Helms), but  could  also  be  used  as  a  national  tool of
       surveillance. Is it unreasonable to believe that efforts continued -
       and possi- bly even succeeded - to  utilize  this  weapon  over long
       ranges and on  unwilling  participants?  An intriguing  report  that
       links these effects  to  those  power  densities  "that  exist  in a
       typical urban environment" was recently  compiled  by  William Bise,
       director of the  Pacific  Northwest  Center for the  Study  of  Non-
       Ionizing Radiation, in  Portland,  Oregon. Entitled "Radio-frequency
       Induced Interference Responses in  the  Human  Nervous  System," the
       report describes preliminary  experiments  conducted  on  ten  human
       volunteers - five  men  and  five  women -between July 1975 and June
       1976. According to  Bise,  these   experiments,   conducted  without
       controls, showed that  "biological  interference  responses  in  the
       human nervous system can be elicited not only by pulse-modulated but
       by continuous wave  radio-frequency at power densities substantially
       below those levels that exist in a typical urban environment."
 
       Four of the male volunteers, subjected  to  irradiation  by electric
       fields of only  65-90  microvolts per meter, experienced  short-term
       memory impairment, followed   by  concentration  inhibition  and  by
       irritability, and three   of   the    women   volunteers   expressed
       apprehension and mild irritation during the course  of the tests. In
       the final section   of   his   report,  Bise  suggested  that  since
       approximately five percent of the  urban  population of the U.S. was
       believed to be  living  in  an environmental power density  averaged
       over several radio  bands of about two volts per meter, his findings
       indicated that "a meaningful risk  factor for the general population
       appears to exist." He then concluded that "since radio-frequency  in
       the environment continues to increase at a phenomenal rate, there is
       a need for further clarifying research of radio-frequency effects on
       biological systems."
 
       The importance of  this  research, claims the Phoenix Foundation, is
       in the similarity of its effects  to  those  found  from  power line
       radiation. Dr. Zaret  was  likewise  concerned  about   the   Soviet
       "woodpecker signal" that  interrupted  communications worldwide (New
       York Times, October 30, 1976), not  because of its interference with
       radio and telecommunications, but because of its potential threat to
       human health: "The broadband signal is being pulsed  at  an  on -off
       rate of ten  times per second. When I analyzed the soviet literature
       for Project Pandora back in the 1960s,  it  was very clear that such
       an encoding impressed onto carrier wavelengths could have a central-
       nervous-system effect. In the case of the present  signal,  I  would
       not be surprised  to  find that the on-off code at a repitition rate
       of ten per second could have an effect on the brain's inherent alpha
       rhythm. So whetever purpose the Russians  may  have  for  continuing
       this transmission, the  potential  effect  in  human   beings   from
       altering their alpha   rhythm   cannot   be  discounted."  Powerline
       radiation pulses at 60 times per second,  a  sixth-level harmonic of
       the brain waves  -  same as six octaves higher. The  biological  and
       cellular effects are  the same, according to study after study after
       study.
 
       As this article went to press, in  the  September  1992 issue of The
       Omega Report ($15/year-The  Phoenix  FOundation,  P.O.   Box  92008,
       Nashville, TN 37209),  we  continued  to receive reports from around
       the nation about  the  same  or similar  ELF  "sounds".  The  latest
       reports come from  Burbank  and San Anselmo, CA, near  Hamilton  Air
       Force Base.

       If any of you have information or knowledge about similar effects or
       activity in that  area  (or  any  other)  that may be related to ELF
       military experiments, please tell  us.  We  are  trying  to  map the
       locations of these incidents by computer.
 
       Before it becomes  illegal to do so (I face a potential  $1  million
       fine and imprisonment  under  a  propsoed  FDA law), I would like to
       give you a number of health approaches  (natural, non-drug) that MAY
       help combat the effects of this warfare in which we  are  the guinea
       pigs.  Exposure to  ELF  radiation  will, among other things, weaken
       the immune system and can cause skin  problems, as well as the other
       problems mentioned by Taos residents in this article.
 
       For skin problems, I recommend - on the advice of a  doctor who does
       not prescribe drugs  -  citricide (a concentrated cirtric acid), lay
       off coffee and use cooler water in  your  bath  (for skin problems).
       You might also   want   to  consider  alpha-  or  delta-wave   brain
       relaxation tapes (not  subliminal  tapes)  that  will counteract the
       theta-wave effect of ELF radiation. Our research indicates there may
       be a link between ELF radiation and AIDS - as it destroys the immune
       system. We have testified in federal  court  as an expert witness on
       this issue and will be doing so again in a court case  in  Springer,
       Mississippi in October 1992.
 
       By all means,  consult  your  physician  before taking any remedies.
       Even vitamins, if over-used, can  cause  damage.   We hope to have a
       special report in the next issue on what you can  do  to  combat ELF
       radiation effects. Please  note:  ELF  radiation  is  non-ionizing -
       unlike nuclear radiation - so its effects are different.
 
       If you are one of the growing number  of  Americans  whose health is
       being seriously jeopardized by "The Sound", please let us know.
