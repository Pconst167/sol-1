  Some time ago someone tried to post some material on the  
involvement of the Aurora Flying Saucer in the creation of  
earthquakes but lacked the facts and source of facts to back
up his statements.                                          
  The source of the following material is the May 11, 1992  
AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY pp 62, 63 - "New Evidence  
Bolsters Reports of Secret High-Speed Aircraft" by William  
R. Scott.  (Wasn't the poster of the material on this plane 
also named Scott?)  (This article predates Landers quake)   
  "Evidence of a high-speed, high-altitude classified       
aircraft powered by an advanced propulsion system continues 
to grow, despite U.S. Air Force claims that no such aircraft
are being acquired by the service.                          
  "Photographs taken over Amarillo, Tex., of contrails      
produced by a 'pulser' aircraft show the distinctive 'donuts
on a string' pattern previously reported by observers in    
California and Colorado.  The contrails are consistent with 
exhaust characteristics of several advanced propulsion      
concepts, such as a pulse detonation wave engine (PWDE).    
  "Sightings of high-speed 'pulser' vehicles that leave     
either this pattern or a segmented, 'sausage-link' contrail 
have been reported for about three years, but Pentagon      
officials continue to say they have no knowledge of such an 
aircraft.  Countering that position, a senior Air Force     
officer who recently addressed civic leaders in California  
hinted that Peale AFB will be assigned a new 'flight' or    
mission within the next two years.  Funding requests now    
being drafted by Air Force headquarters for facility        
construction at Peale would appear consistent with a new    
mission.   P/  "Unknown aircraft having pulse-type engines  
were seen at Peale in late February, but were believed to be
transients.   (Anybody, WHAT is a "transient? beth)         
  "The Texas contrails were photographed on Mar. 23 at 8:30 
AM after the aircraft had crossed Amarillo at high speed on 
a southeasterly heading.  Although the sky was clear and    
visibility unlimited, the vehicle was out of sight before   
Steven A. Doublass, the photographer, could spot it.  He    
described its engine noise as a 'strange, loud pulsating    
roar...unique...a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the   
house and made the windows vibrate."       >                
   "The powerplant produced a continuous series of short    
low-frequency pulses of uniform duration.  Douglass said its
sound was 'similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with 
evenly timed pulses.'   P/  "Douglass also is a radio       
PRODIGY(R) interactive personal service         10/04/92         2:40 AM

hobbyist who publishes 'Intercepts' a monthly newsletter    
about military radio monitoring.  As a result, he owns      
equipment capable of scanning ultra-high frequencies used by
U.S. Air Force aircraft.   P/ "After the vehicle passed     
Amarillo, Douglass detected digitally encrypted speech on   
288 MHz., a narrow-band military frequency used as a        
downlink by USAF communications satellites. The only traffic
previously monitored on this frequency occurred during the  
gulf war, suggesting that the channel is reserved for       
special missions."     P/ "Two North American Air Defense   
Command frequencies (260.8 MHz. and 364.2 MHz) also were    
active at the time.  The primary MORAD frequency (260.8 MHz)
is the airborne intercept command channel for the Southwest 
U.S. region.  Air-to-air communications on that channel were
between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign 'Dragnet 51'   
from Tinker AFR, Okla., and two unknown aircraft using the  
call signs 'Darkstar November' and 'Darkstar Mike'. Messages
consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics    NEXT

May 11, 1992  pp 62, 63: "New Evidence Bolsters Reports of  
Secret High-Speed Aircraft" by William R. Scott.            
   "It is not known whether this radio traffic had any      
association with the 'pulser' that had just flown over      
Amarillo.    P/  "On Apr. 5 (a Sunday) and Apr. 22, radio   
hobbyists in Southern California monitored transmissions    
between Edwards' AFB's radar control facility (Joshua       
Control) and a high altitude aircraft using the call sign   
'Gaspipe.'  The series of radio calls occurred at           
approximately 6 a.m. local time on both dates.              
  "Controllers were directing the unknown Gaspipe aircraft  
to a runway at Edwards, using advisories similar to those   
given space shuttle crews during a landing approach. The    
monitors recorded two advisories, both transmitted by Joshua
Control to Gaspipe; 'You're at 67,000, 81 mi out,' and      
Seventy mi. out, 36,000. Above glideslope.'                 
  "The first transmission implied Gaspipe was a special-    
-mission aircraft flying at 67,000 ft., well above a 50,000 
ft. limit observed by pilots of modern military aircraft    
such as the F-15, F-16 and F/A-18.  When flying above 50,000
ft., USAF crews typically wear pressure suits as protection 
against adverse physiological effects related to low        
atmospheric pressure.  Crews routinely flying high-altitude 
aircraft such as the U-2/TB-1 and the SB-71 above 50,000 ft 
always wear full pressure suits.                            
  "When AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY queried Edwards AFB
and Pentagon officials last week about the Gaspipe          
communications, they said Joshua Control's documents contain
no record of controllers having 'worked' an aircraft with   
such a call sign on those dates.  They also confirmed that  
no U-2/TB-1 or NASA-operated SB-71s were controlled at those
times.       P/  "Data from the Texas and Edwards AFB       
observations are augmented by multiple reports of at least  
five low-pitched, rumbling sonic booms heard by residents in
the Los Angeles area over the past year. (AW&ST Nov. 15,1991
p.23; Nov. 11, 1991 p.15)  Initially these were thought to  
be mild earthquakes.  On Apr. 16 about 7 a.m. two shocks    
were detected approximately 2 min apart -- a now-standard   
pattern consistent with two aircraft flying with slightly   
different tracks.  So far, all the Los Angeles-area booms   
have been heard on Thursday mornings between 6 and 8:30 a.m.
   "The U.S. Geological Survey's earthquake monitoring      
system has recorded five sets of the distinctive shock waves
PRODIGY(R) interactive personal service         10/04/92         2:44 AM

as they rolled over Southern California, and confirmed they 
were not earthquakes.  James J. Mori, a USGS seismologist,  
plotted time-of-arrival data from the activated sensors and 
compared them to patterns produced by the space shuttle and 
SB-7a.     P/  "These reference shock-data were derived from
a shuttle orbiter as it descended supersonically towards    
Edwards AFB, and from the SB-71 during its 1990 trans-      
continental speed record flight.  The data provided an      
approximate speed/altitude calibration of the USGS sensor   
array.  Based on those benchmarks, Mori estimated the       
unknown aircraft's speed at 'several times the speed of     
sound,' possibly as high as Mach 3.      P/ "Separately,    
during the last seven months, a small team of observers in  
southern California logged at least 30 sonic booms believed 
to be produced by the same unknown aircraft type that       
periodically triggered the USGS sensors.  Because its 'boom'
and subsequent engine sound was quite distinctive, observers
claim they could easily distinguish the 'pulser' from  NEXT
