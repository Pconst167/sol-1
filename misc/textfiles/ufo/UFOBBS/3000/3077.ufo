before he became governor.
 
He did not specify the date or place, but noted that he had been with friends

Carter Asked Space Agency to Investigate UFO's
 
President Carter had asked NASA to establish a panel of inquiry to
investigate
UFO's.  Dave Williamsom, NASA's assistant for special projects, answered on
friday that NASA was "not anxious" to get into the controversy because it's
not wise to do research on something that is not a measurable phenomenon.
 
There is no measurable UFO evidence such as a piece of metal, flesh or cloth.
We don't even have any radio signals. A photograph is not a measurement. But
he added that a group of technical experts he headed would recommend by the
end of the year what NASA's response should be to the white house request.

NASA Refuses To Reopen Investigation of UFO's
 
NASA administrator Robert Frosch, in a letter last week to Pres. Carter's
science advisor Dr. Frank Press, rejected a White House request to
investigate UFO's saying that such an inquiry would be "wasteful and probably
unproductive."
 
Dr. Press said: he accepted NASA's conclusions and did not plan to pursue the
matter further.  NASA said: that it stood ready to analyze any "bona fide
physical evidence from credible sources," but such evidence has never been
found.

UN Urged To Set Up An Agency For UFO's
 
Mr.Wellington Friday, a delegate from Grenada, spoke before the UN General
Assembly Special Political Committee yesterday at the start of a debate on
how
the UN could contribute to UFO research.
 
He said: the UN should establish an agency to study the sightings of physical
alien objects, contact with such objects and the exchanges with alien
creatures occupying UFO's.
 
Grenada's Prime Minister Sir Eric M. Gairy has for many years asked the UN to
establish a UFO agency; delegates agreed that they needed time to prepare for
a debate on the issue later this week. ---------------------------------------

United Nations Hears Case For UFO's
 
For the second time in two years, the Prime Minister of the West Indies
island
of Grenada, Sin Eric Gairy, is campaigning to get the UN to set up an agency
to "collate, coordinate and corroborate information" on UFO's.
 
In 1977, Gairy succeeded in getting UFO's on the General Assembly's agenda
which resulted in an agreement that any country with information or ideas on
the subject could send them to UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim; however,
in
the year since Waldhein has made no public mention of co-operation from
member
nations.
 
Earlier this week, Gairy was at the UN making his case again: "We've passed
the stage now whether or not these things exist. I think it is accepted that
these things do exist.  I think we now want to know the nature, the origin
and the intent of these saucers.  Some people think they have come to do
good.  Some think they have come to dominate human beings."
 
He cited reported that aircraft have been put out of commission, but not
destroyed, after attacking saucers.  "That comfirms my thought on their
positive intent.  I believe they are coming here to help mankind because man
is so self- destructive...
 
It would be very conceited for man to think that he is the most intelligent
of
God's creatures.  "Sir Eric says he hes seen two UFO's in the last three
years; the second time earlier this year from a hotel room in Grenada. "The
time is going to come when everybody on Earth will have to pay attention to
the UFO phenomenon."
