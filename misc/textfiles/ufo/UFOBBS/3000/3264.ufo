                             Denver UFO Report

Date: Jan 31st, 1993

Follow-up report on the reported UFO (unusual lights in the sky)
near Denver, Colorado. Original Report titled UFODEN.TXT.

At or about 16:30 hours sic [4:30 P.M.] the investigative team
met near the site of the reported UFO or unusual lights in the
sky. From this point South-West of Denver, at the Ken Caryl Ranch
area; we proceeded to the Bradford Elementary School. This was
the main spot from which Deputy M.S. reported seeing a strange
ball of light that was hovering at about 800 to 1000 feet above
the mountain peak about 1/2 mile away. He had pointed out the
specific spot to investigators during an earlier interview. He
also pointed out the other areas that he personally observed the
lights from.

From this first point at the Bradford Elementary School, we were
able to take several daylight photographs of the area for
familiarization. Then we drove around the housing additions to
get a better perspective on the road structure throughout the
area. Then the team retired to a restaurant to discuss the
expected procedure for later that evening.

The sun set, and the light started to fade at about 18:00 hours
sic [6:00 P.M.]. The team members were deployed out to their
respective observation points to await the hour that was listed
as the time when the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office received
the first calls reporting the lights in the sky. This had
occurred at 19:40 hours sic [7:40 P.M.] on the date of the
incident. Each observation point was manned by 2 investigators.
Each team had at least 1 camera [35 MM] to take photographs.

The primary team was set up at the Bradford Elementary School
parking lot. At 19:40 hours sic [7:40] they photographed the, now
darkened mountainside, with the houses in the foreground. This
was shot with a 35 MM, SLR camera, with a 55 MM Pentax lens, and
Kodacolor ASA 400 film. These photographs that were aimed at the
center of the peak did not show the planet Venus in or near the
frame of the photographs. The planet Venus was quite prominent
in the sky at that time at night. However, it was also at a very
high angle that was West and at a higher azimuth than the
reported objects.

At the base of the saddle between the mountain that was the focal
point of the "strange lights sightings" and the next mountain
South, there is a low profile house. The occupants of this house
will be questioned at a later date, to see if they were aware of
any "strange lights" in their area on the night of January 25th,
1993.


At 20:40 hours sic [8:40 P.M.] photographs were taken from
Bradford Elementary School parking lot again with the same camera
and film. In this photograph, no lights were seen in the area of
the mountain peak. However, it is noted that the planet Venus had
now traversed low enough in its arc in the Western sky to be on
the extreme top and Western edge of the photograph. The
photographer might have set the camera up at an angle slightly
Western of the original shot to get the planet Venus in the
photograph. However, with the ambient light levels in the area,
it would be extremely hard for an experienced police officer and
the other witnesses to mistake the planet for a "ball of light
about 1/2 mile away, about 12 feet in diameter, and ten times
brighter that the street lights across from the parking lot".
