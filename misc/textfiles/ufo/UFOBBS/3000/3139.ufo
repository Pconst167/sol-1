          That UFOs can harm humans, we already know; they can also, though 

     less frequently, heal. Both the beneficial and the deleterious effects 

     on human tissue seem to be brought about by controlled radiation, most 

     probably in the microwave frequency band.

          An early case, investigated by Janet and Colin Bord at a time of 

     considerable European UFO activity involving entity cases, occurred on 8 

     November 1954 in Croydon, Surrey. Philip Molava, aged thirteen, was out 

     of doors late at night feeding his rabbits when he saw a small discoid 

     object fly past him at close quarters. Next day he became very ill and 



                                126

          was taken to hospital with suspected food poisoning, lying in bed 

     partially paralysed. He reported that at 2 a.m. three cloaked figures 

     appeared out of a mist that had materialised beside his bed. He lost 

     consciousness, but next day was found to be completely cured. He said 

     that following this visitation he had experienced a number of out of the 

     body experiences (OBEs) and received telepathic messages about impending 

     dangers to humanity. (Randles 1988)

          That case in some ways prefigures a much stranger and more 

     important one which, though it illustrates very well two areas I wish to 

     consider, I would scarcely dare to quote were it not attested by two of 

     the most respected names in French ufology. The full story has never 

     been told, according to Jacques Vallee (1990), although the original 

     encounter was investigated by Aime Michel and reported by him in two 



                                127

          well-known articles published in Flying Saucer Review (9/69 and 11/71) 

     These first reports described how Dr. X, at the age of 28, had suffered 

     severe war wounds fighting in Algeria, such that he was left with a 

     permanent disability affecting the right side of his body. Ten years 

     later, on 31 October 1968, he also accidentally cut a vein in his leg 

     while chopping wood with an axe, producing severe haemorrhage and 

     inflammation. Three nights later he was still in pain from this when, 

     some time after midnight, he was awakened by the crying of his baby son, 

     who was standing up in his cot and pointing to a bright light visible 

     through the shuttered window. He gave the child a bottle, opened the 

     window and stepped out on to the balcony, only to see two identical 

     discs, later estimated as having a diameter of one hundred feet and a 

     height of fifty feet. Each had a vertical antenna on top and a 



                                128

          horizontal one at the side; they were emitting small sparks between 

     their horizontal antennas, which therefore must have been on different 

     sides of each disc, so that one disc would be the mirror image of the 

     other, a significant point supporting the suggestion that the apparent 

     duality was in fact an optical illusion. The two discs then merged into 

     a single object that moved slowly towards the witness, shining a white 

     beam downwards and then suddenly moving to a vertical alignment so that 

     the beam shone directly at the doctor as he stood on the balcony. The 

     UFO then vanished with a bang, emitting a "bright wire" which flew up 

     into the sky, exploding like a firework. This is the same sort of 

     pyrotechnic display observed by Colonel Halt at Rendlesham.

          If the purpose of the display was to impress the visit on the mind 

     of the witness, it was certainly achieved, especially as Dr. X 



                                129



ALIEN ENCOUNTERS



          discovered that not only his war wounds but also the recent haematoma 

     produced by his axe mishap had both vanished as swiftly as the UFO 

     itself. About a fortnight later an area of skin around his navel 

     reddened into an equilateral triangle with six inch sides, which 

     disappeared after a time. The same pattern appeared on the body of the 

     baby and both were subsequently replicated annually, perhaps as a 

     reminder of the existence of a debt of gratitude. A bone fracture 

     suffered later by the doctor also healed spontaneously and exceptionally 

     rapidly.

          Eleven years after the original incident, Jacques Vallee first 

     made the acquaintance of Dr. X and learned that the UFO sighting had 

     been only the prelude to a series of quite extraordinary events which 

     seemed to suggest that the intelligence controlling the UFOs might be 



                                130

          much more intimately concerned in human affairs than had hitherto been 

     generally supposed.

          About a year after the miraculous healings, Dr. X was on holiday 

     in southern France when he began to hear a whistling sound inside his 

     head, in the same way that Ed Walters at Gulf Breeze had been contacted, 

     together with a strong mental suggestion that he should return to his 

     hotel. When he did so he found that someone was waiting to speak to him 

     on the telephone. The caller told him that  they were soon to meet in 

     the doctor's home town to discuss what he had seen. Back home, he again 

     heard the whistling sound and felt guided to a place where a stranger, 

     driving the latest and most expensive Citroen car, awaited him. The man 

     was tall, with brown hair and piercing blue eyes, conventionally dressed 

     in a smart suit. He began by apologising for the outbreak of poltergeist 



                                131

          activity which had recently troubled the doctor's household, though it 

     is unlikely that he was claiming to be the direct cause of this; but it 

     is frequently the case that, when a door into an alternative reality is 

     opened for an individual, one can never be sure what entities may make 

     use of it. Presumably Monsieur Bied, as the doctor decided to call the 

     stranger, had opened this door and indeed he later caused Dr. X to 

     experience teleportation and time travel, together with an episode on a 

     road that does not exist in our world, in an alternative landscape that 

     probably exists sometime else.

          M. Bied often appeared unannounced in the doctor's garden and on 

     one occasion came into the house, accompanied by a three feet tall 

     humanoid whose skin had a mummified appearance. Furthermore the doctor 

     often felt that aliens were present around the house. These happenings, 



                                132

          as can well be imagined, were very distressing to Mme. X. An incident in 

     1971, however, rather suggested that 'M. Bied' was also a person of some 

     importance in Paris, perhaps even a government functionary.

          It happened one day when Dr. and Mme. X were expecting luncheon 

     guests. He went to move his car out of the sun, but was then overcome by 

     an impulse to drive into town, where the mysterious M. Bied awaited him, 

     telling him that they had to go somewhere. He then found himself lying 

     on a bed in a room in Paris, near the Ministry of the Interior. From the 

     window he saw M. Bied's car entering the courtyard below and being 

     saluted by the sentries there. There was a telephone in the room, so he 

     called his wife, who told him that twenty minutes had elapsed since he 

     had left the house and their guests had just arrived. Some time later he 

     saw M. Bied's car drive out and then found himself once more at home, 



                                133



ALIEN ENCOUNTERS



          ready to join his guests but quite bemused by the strange happening. 

     Jacques Vallee suggests that there is yet more to be told, so perhaps 

     one day we shall know the rest of the story of this peculiar 

     relationship between a provincial medical practitioner and a being who 

     seems to commute quite effortlessly between worlds.

          The idea that "they", or at least some of "them", are living here 

     among us without our knowledge has been around for quite some time; when 

     St.Paul (Hebrews 13.2) wrote that "some have entertained angels 

     unawares" he doubtless had in mind Abraham (Genesis 18.2) and Lot (Ibid. 

     19.1 seq.) entertaining three and two angels respectively. In Lot's case 

     hospitality to his guests is said to have saved him from death in what 

     sounds very like a nuclear holocaust with which they destroyed Sodom and 

     Gomorrah. The sacred writings of many ancient peoples contain anecdotes 



                                134



ALIEN ENCOUNTERS



          suggesting that supernal beings frequently visit mankind, but there is 

     of course the corresponding suspicion that infernal entities may do so 

     too. Humans should therefore keep their wits about them in such 

     circumstances, and cease thinking of 'angels' as pretty youths in white 

     nighties.

          Somewhat sinister individuals collectively known as Men in Black 

     (MIBs) are often believed to be alien sojourners in our midst. In 

     America UFO contactees frequently report being visited by black clad men 

     in Cadillac sedans, both of which disappear as soon as they get round 

     the next corner. The alleged government agents who visited Ed Walters in 

     Gulf Breeze, demanding the surrender of his photographic evidence of UFO 

     presences were, in their brusque and hectoring attitudes, typical of the 

     kind of individuals ufologists know as MIBs. In Bolton, Lancashire, a

          young female receptionist named Shelley McLenaghan, walking the few 

     yards between the bus stop and her home, was abducted one afternoon in 

     January 1976 and suffered severe after-effects. She and her family 

     subsequently endured a series of unusual phone calls, followed by a 

     visit from two men in dark suits, one of whom had lost an arm and was 

     called 'The Commander'. These men harshly interrogated Shelley and her 

     parents for two hours and seem to have attempted telepathic thought 

     manipulation. (Randles 1988) If the usual claim of MIBs to be government 

     agents is investigated, official sources invariably disclaim all 

     knowledge of them, but they would do so even if they were genuine. 

     Whoever they represent, the efforts of MIBs are invariably directed to 

     the suppression and confiscation of any evidence which might tend to 

     validate the reality of UFO close encounters.

          Some "extremely terrifying statements" which claim that a 

     successful clandestine occupation of strategic areas of our planet has 

     already been completed, that "all is over bar the screaming" are 

     referred to by Gordon Creighton in his editorial to Vol. 35, No. 4 of 

     Flying Saucer Review, dated December 1990 and making reference to a book 

     entitled The Matrix by one "Valdemar Valerian", otherwise John Grace, 

     published by Arcturus Books in Georgia, USA in very limited and highly 

     priced editions. Although uncertain whether any credence can be given to 

     this publication, Creighton observes that "there seems to be 

     overwhelming evidence for the presence here of many more than just one 

     species of 'Alien'." What we really need now, however, is equally 

     overwhelming evidence of their identities and intentions. Creighton, 

     however, urgently believes that "a powerful force from outside of 



                                137

          mankind is engaged in driving us, like the Gadarene swine, over the 

     cliff and into the abyss ... "Demonic possession is nothing new. All the 

     great Religions have warned of it. But evidence now accumulating 

     suggests that  ... sinister non-human forces are now engaged in a broad 

     plan of genetic-sexual tinkering with our species." - FSR, Vol. 37, No. 

     1, 1992.

          Though an individual may be quite unable to resist manipulation by 

     aliens, humanity's strength, if such attacks are really in prospect, may 

     lie in its powers of co-ordinated action and sheer weight of numbers. If 

     there are several kinds of alien, those most inimical may be contained 

     in alliance with others less so for if, after the dust of these 

     ufological controversies has settled, the final conclusion turns out to 

     be that there are both good and evil forces at work in the world, one

          would have to be extremely ingenuous to find this either novel or 

     surprising. Religiosity and secularism alike have blinded us to the 

     stark ethical imperatives which ineluctably confront humanity in this 

     age of decadence just as they have always done, while our predominantly 

     sheltered urban modes of living have encouraged us to forget how feral 

     Nature functions. There is no reason to suppose that UFOs are either 

     invincible or supernatural, even if their existence may oblige us to 

     recognise that the natural realm has many more mansions than we had 

     previously imagined.
