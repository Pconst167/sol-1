UFO Alien Rescues Girl Buried Alive

Kindhearted Aliens swooped down and rescued a  young   girl from being buried

alive just as her  coffin was being lowered into the ground.



As the priest gave the final blessing over the body of Teresa Saravia 17 an

enormous UFO appeared over the gravesite  in a cemetry near Barboza  in the

Phillipines scattering the terrified funeral procession.



GRUSOME

Eyewitnesses say that the graft hovered over the coffin, which was suspened

in mid-air  and lowered a gangplank to the ground.

Eusebio Malanipa, Teresa's Uncle and one of the pall bearers, says three

aliens descended and exmanined the casket. One of the three four-foot-tall

extraterrestrials then guided the coffin from the grave withj a device

that "looked like a remote control

from a   television panel. I was so frightened that I couldn't move", he

says. "I thought they were on some kind of  gruesome   kidnap mission  and

that we were next.

The Alien being then held the gadget over the coffin and the lid came up. I

couldn't bear the thought of them disturbing the remains of my poor little

niece.



SAVED.

"The Alien waved that  gizmo again and suddenly my niece sat up. I thought I

was going to have a heart attack. She was as alive as you and me. Poor Teresa

was bewildered, here she was sitting in a coffin over her grave with three

strange  looking creatures  smiling at her like she was some sort of prize

catch. When she realised that she was neither dead or sleeping she let out a

wail that  made those little extraterrestrials nearly jump out of their

skins. They didn't know what to make of it. Here they had saved her from

certain death and she was crying like she had lost her mother.

"Mama Mama",, she sobbed. Her mother heard the cries even though she had run

away. She rushed back to the grave and lifted her daughter out of the coffin

without so much as a glance at the aliens. Then suddenly she realized that

these  funny little men and had saved her daughter and proceeded to hug them.

This was too much for the extraterrestrials. They beat a hasty retreat to

their ladder, quickly scurried up the gangpank  and dissappeared in the UFO.

The craft had gone in seconds and everyone who had run away came back to

celebrate Teresa's return from the dead.

Government officials are investigating the astonishing mission of mercy, but

there is no need for any inquiry as far as Mrs Saravia and Teresa are

concerned.

"Those little men are perfect angels," says   Mrs Savavia. "We would have

buried my little Terresa alive if it had not been for them. I think that they

should investigate the bonedheaded doctors who  said my loverly daughter was

dead. I think that they are the ones that should be buried alive. Just let

them see how it feels."

Plucky Teresa - a real life sleeping beauty - has been quick to shake of the

terrifying experience.

" I was scared when I woke up in that  box, but I know my mama will never let

that happen again. I wish those strange men could come back again so that I

could thank them. I was afraid of them at first, but I am  not any more.



It seems that this group of aliens earned their "brownie points" for the day.

Maybe they do really care?
