³       Witnesses Claim They Saw Aliens at U.S. Bases        ³

³The U.S. government has a close working relationship with   ³
³alien beings, three unnamed witnesses told a California     ³
³radio station in a program aired in June.                   ³
³                                                            ³
³  The four-hour program, produced and broadcast by KPFA-FM  ³
³in Berkeley, Calif., ranged widely over the UFO topic, but  ³
³the most explosive segments were the testimony of a         ³
³construction contractor who said he saw aliens at Edwards   ³
³Air Force Base and at the China Lake Naval Weapons facility ³
³in California; the testimony of a man who described         ³
³"saucers" being launched from a Northrop facility near      ³
³Edwards; and a woman's second-hand account of a meeting     ³
³between aliens and U.S. military officers.                  ³
³                                                            ³
³  Moreover, it now appears that KPFA's voice in the         ³
³UFO area has been silenced. Although in June the program    ³
³producer Ralph Steiner promised additional coverage of the  ³
³UFO issue in future broadcasts, inquires from the Forum were³
³met with this blunt message from Mr. Steiner: "Do not re-   ³
³broadcast the tape.  Persons whose testimony is on the tape ³
³have been threatened and their lives are in danger."        ³
³Subsequent inquiries from The Forum to Mr. Steiner have gone³
³unanswered.                                                 ³
³                                                            ³
³  The Forum has obtained a tape of the KPFA broadcast. What ³
³follows is a summary and excerpts from witness No. 1. The   ³
³testimony of witness No. 2 and No. 3 will be discussed in   ³
³Part Two of this article next issue.                        ³
³                                                            ³
³  According to the KPFA broadcast, the interviews were      ³
³conducted in April 1991 in communities surrounding Edwards  ³
³Air Force Base in the Antelope Valley of Southern           ³
³California. Witness No. 1 described himself as a Vietnam    ³
³veteran, former Green Beret, military medal-holder, and a   ³
³licensed general contractor who has worked on construction  ³
³projects at Chuna Lake and at Nellis, Scott, Edwards, and   ³
³Andrews Air Force Bases. The projects, the witness said,    ³
³were "mostly underground."                                  ³
³                                                            ³
³* Underground Structures, Alien Beings                      ³
³                                                            ³
³  Each of these facilities has extensive underground        ³
³installations, and they are "definitely not normal          ³
³military structures," the witness said. He described        ³
³4-foot thick concrete walls and electronically-con-trolled  ³
³oval-shaped doorways.                                       ³
³                                                            ³
³  "In one building I worked on at Edwards, called Haystack  ³
³Buttes, it took us over 5 minutes to get from the top to the³
³bottom by elevator," the witness said. "We estimated it was ³
³30 stories deep." It was here that the witness first saw an ³
³alien.  "We were walking down a hall," the witness said,    ³
³"and these doors opened and there was a very particular     ³
³person or things that caught my eye for an instant. This man³
³was over seven feet tall. I'd say between 8 and 9 to 10     ³
³feet, wearing a lab jacket and talking to two [human]       ³
³engineers.                                                  ³
³                                                            ³
³  "This man's arms were almost down to his knees!  It threw ³
³me into shock," the witness said. "And then the doors       ³
³closed. Security saw us and told us to get out of there.    ³
³Next day I walked off the job," the witness said.           ³
³                                                            ³
³  Asked if the being he saw was a human, the witness        ³
³replied, "Definitely not. He had big slanted eyes. A big    ³
³head. Fingers were extremely long.  Greenish skin." The     ³
³witness said he saw the being for "just a couple of seconds.³
³Three-quarters of its face is what I saw and I said, this   ³
³guy would make a hell of a basketbail player!"              ³
³                                                            ³
³* One Witness Scared, the Other Dead                        ³
³                                                            ³
³The witness said his co-worker " 'bout died" when he too saw³
³the being. The witness compared the height of the being to  ³
³the height of the humans standing next to it. He said he    ³
³knew one of the humans, whose height he estimated at 6 feet ³
³6 inches.                                                   ³
³                                                            ³
³ Witness No. 1 described a second encounter with aliens. He ³
³said he and co-workers saw "greys" at the China Lake naval  ³
³facility.                                                   ³
³                                                            ³
³ "They [security] thought we had left--me and two other     ³
³guys. But we decided to stay over and finish this job. We   ³
³walked past a hangar and we could see through a window," the³
³witness said.                                               ³
³                                                            ³
³  "One of the guys I was with, Paul, he saw them first. He  ³
³said, 'Come here! Hurry up! I want to show you sometning!'  ³
³And we looked in the window and there's these four little   ³
³grey guys about 3 feet tall.                                ³
³                                                            ³
³  "Right then, security saw us and they told us, 'We        ³
³thought you guys left.' And they escorted us and said,      ³
³'You're not allowed around this hangar. This hangar is off- ³
³limits to everybody. You'll get yourself shot.'             ³
³                                                            ³
³  "And it messed with Paul's mind so much that every chance ³
³he got he snuck over there. He finally got caught and was   ³
³kicked off the base. About three months later they found him³
³mysteriously dead in Orange County. This kinda put a scare  ³
³in me. I know why not to mess with something," the witness  ³
³said.                                                       ³
³                                                            ³
³  "After that I said, Ain't nobody pulling the blanket over ³
³my head any more. l know what's going on now. l know what I ³
³saw at Edwards is real. Somebody's playing games with us,"  ³
³the witness said.                                           ³
³                                                            ³
³  It should be noted that KPFA is one of five "Pacifica"    ³
³stations, the first of which was founded in the late 1940s. ³
³The Pacifica stations, in New York, berkeley, Los Angeles,  ³
³Fresno, and Washington, D.C., are alternahve, non-commercial³
³and listener-sponsored, with a long tradition of political  ³
³activism and precedent-making First Amendment struggles.    ³
