Subject: mind control and mental telepathy

August 1, 1993


In 1969 Mr. Warden scored in the 98th percentile in a standardized, high school
intelligence test. He was a National Merit Finalist, and graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley with honors. His background is in the
liberal arts with an introduction to the physical sciences. He again scored in
the 98th percentile in the verbal and mathematical sections of the Graduate
Record Exam in 1977. For what he is about to relate, Mr. Warden was
hospitalized twice on psychiatric wards for paranoid schizophrenia, first for
ten days and then for two weeks, culminating in forced confinement to a state
mental institution for eight months in 1986. Today he works as a public
relations writer for a non-profit organization providing disability services in
Los Angeles.

Circa 1980 he was the subject of a recruitment attempt and an experiment
involving mental telepathy, conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Shortly thereafter he was contacted by means of mental telepathy, operated by
the governments of the United States and other major world powers, in
particular, that of the former Soviet Union. The purpose of the contact was,
first, to inform him of the true nature of the disembodied voices he had been
hearing in his mind that by the medical profession had been ascribed to
schizophrenia, and second, to recruit him as a public relations officer for the
CIA and the Mental Telepathy System (MTS).

The MTS is operational on the public and involves what might commonly be known
as mind control. It is a system of technology that operates apparently by radio
and microwaves, and that can broadcast voices and visual images, including
somatic sensations, and affect the autonomic nervous system across distances.
It is a hardware-based system that involves transmitters, antennas and
amplifying devices. Though in its most primitive form the MTS mimics psychic
phenomena, it involves man-made technology as distinct from whatever natural
psychic phenomena may have occurred throughout time.

Without their knowledge, many people are under the influence of the MTS, which
due sometimes to foreign control, can manifest itself in the bizarre and
disturbing psychopathic outbreaks that appear from time to time in the news
media. The voices that the Son of Sam serial killer thought he heard from the
dog in the backyard of the neighboring apartment building in the mid- to late
1970's probably resulted from the MTS. The foreign student at UC Berkeley who
took hostages at the street cafe around 1991, claiming he was under the
influence of government mind control experiments, also probably was affected by
the MTS. Events such as David Koresh's control over the Branch Davidian cult in
Waco, Texas during 1993 can also fully be accounted for by, and probably were
the result of, his being unknowingly influenced by the worst aspects of the
MTS.


BACKGROUND

The MTS goes back as far as the time of the Kennedy Administration and the
outbreak of Beatlemania shortly after the President's assassination. It's
actual origins are unclear, but may have had something to do with Nazi war
experiments. In the early 1960's the Soviet Union had the advantage with this
technology, and deployed it in western nations in the form of a mood altering
broadcast wave that put people under its sway. Known a few years later as the
Biofeedback Transponding Crowd Control System, the Soviet mind control
technology was installed in places such as Berkeley, California, where it was
used for subversive purposes to foment mass demonstrations, and also for
international exchange and quasi-diplomatic efforts to promote understanding
and sympathy for the Soviets among American people.

Mental telepathy technology was the joint and evolving development of the
intelligence forces of the United States, the CIA, and the Soviet KGB.
Reflecting the international tensions between the two countries, it grew in a
manner similar to the competition of the space race, with civilian and military
implications. The Soviets, who had the upper hand on the mental telepathy
technology, used it in the US for espionage and subversion, trying to gain
access to the minds of scientists involved in government weapons research, and
to foment civil unrest and pro socialist sympathy among the younger generation
of Americans.

Faced with the missile gap of the late 1970's, the advances by the Soviets with
their particle beam accelerator, and similar national defense issues, the
Reagan Administration came to power and began a concerted push, known as
COINTELPRO- the CounterIntelligence Program. Through COINTELPRO, the defense
buildup and the beginning of the space shuttle program, which was able quickly
to put into orbit more of the intelligence and communications satellites that
operate the MTS at its upper levels; the US was able to gain the upper hand in
the MTS. Truth as we know it in the US won out over the disinformation
propagated by the Soviet mental telepathy system, known informally as "Vodka."
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the mental telepathy wars conducted
between telepaths, or mental telepathy operatives, of the CIA and the KGB have
come to an end, although why psychopathological outbreaks continue among the
population remains unclear.

The American MTS, which was influenced and partially operated by the KGB in
particular during the 1970's, politically fell under the observation and
verification clauses of the SALT I and II treaties. When it became clear that
the Soviets were gaining too much influence over the American public, SALT II
drew increasing discontent among government leaders and was scuttled. Under the
provisions of SALT, the Soviets were permitted to operate mental telepathy in
diplomatic colony zones such as Berkeley, also known as "Pacifica." The US
essentially was blackmailed into accepting the Soviet proposal of detente
during the Brezhnev era and their mental telepathy operation in this country,
due to their relative superiority in research and development in the field of
artificial mental telepathy. COINTELPRO recruited a sufficient number of
Americans, however, to develop the American MTS, and the intelligence
satellites that play a primary role in propagating it across wide areas, to the
point whe re it effectively could combat the Soviet Vodka telepathy.

Present control of the MTS is improving, with better mental and psychological
conditions for the telepaths who are affected by it, because the KGB is no
longer intact to propagate its particular brand of psychological mischief and
violence; but because the MTS still remains under wraps, the heirs of the
Soviets, apparently the Russians and affiliated republics, probably still
continue to foment the violence that periodically erupts in the form of serial
killers with bizarre and demented notions, and other forms of psychopathology
in the news media. The provisions of the Detente-era treaty governing the MTS
and Vodka hold that Russian telepathy will continue in the US until the MTS is
operated en pleine jour, or in broad daylight without government camouflage and
denial, in the US-or elsewhere in the world for that matter. In other words,
the Russians will continue to operate Vodka in the US, though at a more
hospdŸ, until the government, or someone, "blows the cover" on mental
telepathy, and this new technology becomes pthe national security;

including abbreviations, shall conform to the standards prescribed in 
implementing directives issued by the Information Security Oversight Office. 

 (d) Foreign government information shall either retain its original 
classification or be assigned a United States classification that shall 
insure a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the 
entity that furnished the information. 

 (e) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor orders 
shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the 
omission of other required markings. Omitted markings may be inserted on a 
document by the officials specified in Section 3.l(b). 

 SEC. 1.6 Limitations on Classification 

 (a) In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal 
violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent 
embarrassment to a person, organiz,atjon, or agency; to restrain competition; 
or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require 
protection in the interest of national security.

the information may reasonably be recovered. These reclassification actions 
shall be reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office. 

 (d) Information may be classified or reclassified after an agency has 
received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) 
or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review 
provisions of this Order (Section 3.4) if such classification meets the

  Derivative Classification 

  SEC. 2.1 Use of Derivative Classification 

 (a) Derivative classification is (1) the determination that information is 
in substance the same as information currently classified, and (2) the 
application of the same classification markings. Persons who only reproduce, 
extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply 
classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a 
classification guide, need not possess original classification authority. 

 (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall: 

 (1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and 

 (2) carry forward to any newly created documents any assigned authorized 
markings. The declassification date or event that provides the longest period 
of classification shall be used for documents classified on the basis of 
multiple sources. 

 SEC. 2.2 Classification Guides. 

 (a) Agencies with original classification authority shall prepare 
classification guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative 
classification of information. 

 (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an official 
who: 

 (1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is the 
senior agency official designated under Section 5.3(a); and 

 (2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level of 
classification prescribed in the guide. 

 (c) Agency heads may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of the 
requirement to prepare classification guides for specified classes of 
documents or information. The Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office shall be notified of any waivers. 


                                    PART 3 

 Declassification and Downgrading 

 Sec. 3.1 Declassification Authority. 

 (a) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national 
security considerations permit. Agencies shall coordinate their review of 
classified information with other agencies that have a direct interest in the 
subject matter. Information that continues to meet the classification 
requirements prescribed by Section 1.3 despite the passage of time will 
continue to be protected in accordance with this Order. 

 (b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded by the official who 
authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in 
the same position; the originator's successor; a supervisory official of 
either; or officials delegated such authority in writing by the agency head 
or the senior agency official designated pursuant to Section 5.3(a). 

 (c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines 
that information is classified in violation of this Order, the Director may 
require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the 
classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the 
National Security Council. The information shall remain classified, pending a 
prompt decision on the appeal. 

 (d) The provisions of this Section shall also apply to agencies that, under 
the terms of this Order, do not have original classification authority, but 
that had such authority under predecessor orders. 

 Sec. 3.2 Transferred Information. 

 (a) In the case of classified information transferred in conjunction with a 
transfer of functions, ant more
positive in its implications than negative. Above all, one's greatest hope
should be for freedom from external control and liberty to enjoy a restored
privacy of the mind.
