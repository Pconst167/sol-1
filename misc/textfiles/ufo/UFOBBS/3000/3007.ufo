SUBJECT: DISTANCE THAT UFO'S TRAVEL TO GET HERE              FILE: UFO3007




It helps to put into perspective the distances that UFO's must travel if
come from the nearest galaxy to us.  Showing how long it would take at 6
isn't really the best example but the time it would take at the speed of
is interesting.
 
Distance to the Sun (at perihelion) = 91,400,000 miles
                     Speed of Light = 186,232 miles per second
                     Speed of Light = 670,615,200 miles per hour
      Number of seconds in one year = 31,536,000 seconds
                     One light year = 5,874,589,152,000 miles
  Years to Sun at 60 Miles per Hour = 173.8964992 years at 60mph
 
       Distance to Proxima Centauri = 25,260,733,354,000 miles
    Light Years to Proxima Centauri = 4.3 light years
        Seconds to Proxima Centauri = 135,604,800 s. (at speed of light)
          Hours to Proxima Centauri = 37,668 hours (at speed of light)
           Days to Proxima Centauri = 1569.5 days (at speed of light)
 Years to Proxima Centauri at 60MPH = 48,060,756 (at 60 miles per hour)
 
         Distance to nearest Galaxy = 1,174,917,830,400,000,000 miles
      Light Years to nearest Galaxy = 200,000 light years
          Seconds to nearest Galaxy = 6,307,200,000,000 (at light speed)
            Hours to nearest Galaxy = 1,752,000,000 (at light speed)
             Days to nearest Galaxy = 73,000,000 (at light speed)
   Years to nearest Galaxy at 60MPH = 2,235,384,000,000 (at 60 MPH)
 
 
Here is a guide to pronouncing some of the extremely large numbers up
there:
 
Zeroes  Name         Zeroes  Name
     3  Thousand         33  Decillion
     6  Million          36  Undecillion
     9  Billion          39  Duodecillion
    12  Trillion         42  Tredecillion
    15  Quadrillion      45  Quattuordecillion
    18  Quintillion      48  Quindecillion
    21  Sextillion       51  Sexdecillion
    24  Septillion       54  Septendecillion
    27  Octillion        57  Octodecillion
    30  Nonillion        60  Novemdecillion
                         63  Vigintillion
