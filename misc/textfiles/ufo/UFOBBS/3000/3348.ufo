 Chinese-Russian team planning mission to red planet

 BEIJING - Chinese and Russian scientists are preparing for a joint
 mission  to explore Mars and  look for signs of life,  an official
 report said Sunday.
     For the past two years, scientists from the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences  have been working  with the Russian Academy  of Sciences
 researching and making high-altitude soundine balloons for detect-
 ing cosmic rays and studying space environment, the official Xinhua
 News Agency reported.
      Yuri Sergeevich Osipov, the president of the Russian academy,
 was quoted as saying they were preparing to launch a spacecraft in
 1994 that will orbit Mars and collect data. A second launch in 1996
 will land  on the planet  to explore its  climate and  geology and
 search for signs of life.
        The project has been dubbed Mars-96.  France, Italy and the
 United States also are working on the project,  but Osipov did not
 give details of their work.
       The Soviet Union launched two Mars-bound spacecraft in 1988;
 but both failed to reach the planet, the report said.
        China's space technology has focused on satellite launches.
 It has said  it would launch  an unmanned spacecraft  by the year
 2000, but few details of those plans have been reported.
