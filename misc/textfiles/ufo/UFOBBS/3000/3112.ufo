  The report of a near collision last month between a mysterious aircraft and
a packed 747 could bring some unwanted scrutiny to the Pentagon, and perhaps
even the Boeing Co.

[Bunch of speculation deleted]

  According to the FAA, the near collision occurred over Southern California
on August 5, 1992 when the crew of a United Airlines 747 en route to London
reported that an unusual and unscheduled aircarft had zipped by within 1,000
feet of their widebody jet.

  The unidentified aircraft was described as having a sleek, wingless body
about 50 feet long and looked something like a miniature version of the now-
retired SR-71 spy plane.  The description does not fit any know aircraft.

....Pentegon spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Garner denied the mystery aircraft was
part of a "black" military project.
  "That wasn't onw of ours -- not to suggest we have black programs," Garner
said.

....The FAA says it does not plan an investigation, in part because no one
will admit operating or owning the mysterious aircraft.
