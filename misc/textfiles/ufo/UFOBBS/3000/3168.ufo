                        The 1992 Canadian UFO Survey

     Since 1989, UFO case data has been solicited from all known and
active investigators and researchers in Canada for analyses and
comparison with other compilations.  Before that time, individual
researchers would normally maintain their own files, with little or no
communication with others.  Even representatives of major UFO
organizations often do not regularly submit case data, and the parent
organizations themselves tend not to do much analyses with the data they
do receive.

     After favourable responses from the publication of previous
Canadian UFO Surveys, UFOROM decided to continue the systematic
collection of raw UFO report data in Canada and prepare yearly reports
for general circulation.  It has been always felt that the dissemination
of such data would be of great advantage to researchers, so it is
presented here once again as data with some analysis.

     The response from Canadian researchers to requests for 1992 data
was better than in previous years.  More cases were submitted from more
investigators, including those in Ontario, resulting in a marked
increase in the number of cases used in the analyses.  While this
prevents direct comparisons with previous years, this has the advantage
of being more comprehensive.  There are still those researchers,
however, who, for whatever reasons, do not submit cases for the annual
survey.  In addition, some researchers do not maintain useable case
files and do not retain quantitative criteria in their investigations
(for example, contactee groups).  It is now suspected that only a small
fraction of "active" ufologists and self-proclaimed "researchers"
actually investigate cases and maintain useable records.

     In 1989, 141 UFO reports were obtained for analysis.  In 1990, 194
reports were recorded.  In 1991, 165 reports were received.  In 1992,
223 cases were examined.  These reports came from contributing
investigators' files, press clippings and the files of the National
Research Council of Canada.  The NRC routinely receives UFO reports from
private citizens and from RCMP, civic police and military personnel.

     The number of cases in 1992 represents a 35% increase over the
previous year, which had been a 15% decrease from that of 1990.
Assuming an average of 180 cases per year, the variation is uniform in
either direction, and we can suggest that the number of UFO reports per
year in Canada is relatively constant, even allowing for the influx of
cases from new contributors.

     In 1992, there were apparent significant increases in the number of
reports in Manitoba, while there was an apparent decrease in reports in
Alberta and Quebec.  As usual, British Columbia represents the largest
fraction of UFO reports of all the provinces.  Since 1990, BC has
garnered between 35% and 40% of the total number of cases per year.  As
mentioned in previous annual reports, this is partly due to the highly
efficient UFO reporting system in that province, and the comparatively
large number of active investigators.  The rest of the Provinces appear
to have had average numbers of reports in 1991.

     The monthly breakdowns of reports during each year show slightly
different patterns from those of previous years.  In 1989, there was a
significant increase in UFO reports in the late fall, with other months
maintaining what appeared to be a fairly constant "normal" level of
reports.  But 1990 saw two major increases in report numbers in two
months: April and August.  The "normal" level of monthly report numbers
appeared to be constant in other months, with minor fluctuations.  In
1991, reports peaked in August, but there was no single obvious trough,
and there were an abnormally large number of reports in the winter
months.  The 1992 breakdown again shows no clear trend in monthly
distribution.  In fact, reports are fairly evenly distributed throughout
the year, with no marked increase in reports in either summer or winter.
This is curious, since previous analyses of UFO reports have almost
always shown a peak in the summer months, as would be expected because
most UFO sightings are simple NLs and there are generally more outdoor
observers available during the summer months.  This would be especially
expected in Canada, where the seasonal temperatures vary considerably,
and there is much less evening outdoor activity in the winter.
Nevertheless, UFO report numbers were not significantly less in the
winter than in the summer.  An average of 18 UFO reports per month was
calculated from the data.

                                  TABLE 2
                           UFO Reports per Month

     Selecting only the cases labelled "unknown," two peaks are seen:
one in March and the other in July.  Other months are distributed more
evenly.  While it is tempting to regard these two peaks as real
anomalies, given the relatively small number of cases in the sample, it
is more likely that they are statistical artefacts.

     An analysis by report type shows a similar breakdown to that found
in previous years.  The numbers of cases of a particular type remained
roughly constant except for the category of Nocturnal Lights, which
exhibited nearly a twofold increase in 1990.  However, numbers of NLs
were closer to a 1989 level in 1991.  Relative numbers of specific
report types remained within a close range of previous years' values.
Nocturnal lights, for example, were 60% of all reports in 1989, 73% on
1990, 67% in 1991, and 61% in 1992.  In general, NLs can be said to
comprise about two-thirds of all UFO reports.

For those unfamiliar with the categories, a summary follows:

     NL (Nocturnal Light) - light source in night sky

     ND (Nocturnal Disc) - light source in night sky that appears to
     have a definite shape

     DD (Daylight Disc) - unknown object observed during daytime hours

     CE1 (Close Encounter of the First Kind) - ND or DD occurring within
     200 metres of a witness

     CE2 (Close Encounter of the Second Kind) - CE1 where physical
     effects left or noted

     CE3 (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) - CE1 where
     figures/entities are encountered

     CE4 (Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind) - an alleged "abduction"
     or "contact" experience

     EV (Evidence) - a case where physical traces left by an event are
     the primary claim

     RD (Radar) - UFOs observed on radar

     PH (Photograph) - photograph(s) of a UFO, but no actual sighting

The category of Nocturnal Disc was created by UFOROM for differentiation
within its own report files.  Similarly, Evidence is also an ad hoc
creation, and may not be applicable by other researchers. Normally,
Evidence would include such physical traces as "crop circles", "landing
rings" and "saucer nests".  However, in 1990 there was a great increase
in the numbers of such traces discovered in North America, and it was
decided to treat these as separate from UFO reports in these Surveys.
[For the record, there were 27 "crop circles" and related traces
discovered in Canada in 1990, 39 in 1991, and 46 in 1992.  Many of these
were investigated by UFO researchers, and a few were reported to the
NRC. UFOROM is associated with the North American Institute for Crop
Circle Research, which investigates such cases and publishes separate
reports on its findings.]

     The breakdown by evaluative conclusions for 1992 cases can be shown
to be similar to results from previous years.  There were three
operative categories: Insufficient Information, Possible or Probable
Explanation, and Unknown.  Readers are warned that a classification of
Unknown does not imply that an alien spacecraft was observed; no such
interpretation can be made with certainty, based on the given data
(though the probability of this scenario is admittedly never zero).  In
most cases, the evaluations are made subjectively by both the
contributing investigators and the compiler of this report.  The
category of Unknown is adopted only if the contributed data or case
report contains enough information that a conventional explanation
cannot be satisfactorily proposed.  This does not mean that the case
will never be explained, but only that a viable explanation is not
immediately obvious.

     In 1992, a change was adopted in order to include Explained cases
in the statistics.  While all categories of UFO reports were solicited
from investigators, few included Explained cases in their submissions
because they were not, by definition, unidentified flying objects.
However, this raises several concerns.  First, it is known that many
UFOs become IFOs only after moderate investigative efforts.  There is no
question that many cases in the Possible or Probable category are in
fact IFOs.  Second, previous studies of UFO reports, including Blue Book
and the Colorado project, tabulated IFOs as Explained  cases and
indicated these conclusions in their reports.  Third, whether
consciously or subconsciously, researchers may discard IFO cases as
unnecessary and not submit them for the total analyses.  This will,
naturally, skew the statistics in favour of UFOs.  As an illustration,
one contributor to the annual survey noted that "dozens" of other UFO
reports were received but not tabulated because they were immediately
discernable as IFOs.

     In 1991, two UFO reports were Explained, but not included in the
statistical calculations.  In 1992, 17 were Explained, and were used in
the annual breakdown of data.

     The hourly distribution of cases tended to follow the same pattern
for 1992 as in previous years.  There appears to be a peak near 2200
hours local and a trough around 1000 hours local.  In 1992, a secondary
peak near 2300 hours local was also evident.

     The average number of witnesses per case went down from a value of
2.12/case in 1989 to 1.4/case in 1990, then up again to 1.91/case in
1991.  In 1992, the average number of witnesses was up again, at
2.36/case.  It is not known what this may indicate.  It is possible that
there might have been a tendency for only one of a pair or group of
witnesses to report an incident in some situations, and, hence, this
value would wax or wane depending on the social factor.  This may have
been true in the NRC files, which may not reflect the total number of
witnesses sharing a UFO experience.  However, these figures still show
that a typical UFO experience has more than one witness, supporting the
contention that UFO sightings represent observations of physical
phenomena.  In fact, other studies, including the 1992 analyses, suggest
that the typical UFO experience is shared by at least two witnesses.

     The category of Duration is interesting in that it represents the
subjective length of time the UFO experience lasted.  Naturally, these
times are greatly suspect because it is known that people tend to
misjudge the flow of time.  However, some people can be good at
estimating time, so this value has some meaning.  Although an estimate
of "one hour" may be in error by several minutes, it is unlikely that
the correct value would be, for example, one minute (disregarding the
claims of "missing time" during the abduction category of experiences).
Furthermore, there have been cases when a UFO was observed and clocked
accurately, so that we can be reasonably certain that UFO events can
last considerable periods of time.  The average duration of a sighting
can be calculated as a summation of all given durations then divided by
the number of cases with a stated duration.  The resulting value for
1991 was about 12 minutes, down from 19 minutes in 1990. In 1992, the
value is again around 12 minutes.  This surprisingly long duration is
likely due to the large number of sightings lasting only a few seconds
combined with a few that lasted several hours.

     In cases where a colour of an object was reported in 1992, the most
common colour was white (55 cases), followed distantly by red (24
cases).  Other colours were also represented, although there is a
noticeable change from previous years, when green was a dominant colour.
Since most UFOs are nocturnal starlike objects, the abundance of white
objects is not surprising.  The green coloured objects were, in general,
bolides, which were seen in significant numbers in 1991 and 1992.

Summary of Results
------------------
     As with previous annual Surveys, the 1992 Survey does not offer any
positive proof of the physical reality of UFOs.  However, it does show
that some phenomenon which is called a UFO is continually being observed
by witnesses.  The typical UFO sighting is that of two people observing
a moving, distant white or red light for a period of over 15 minutes.
In most cases, the UFO is likely to be eventually identified as a
conventional object such as an astronomical object.  However, in a small
percentage of cases, some UFOs do not appear to have an easy explanation
and they may be given the label of "unknown".

     What are these "unknowns"?  An additional classification is useful
to try and better understand this kind of report.  In the gathering of
data for the study, a value was assigned for a personal evaluation of
the Reliability of the report.  This value gives the likelihood that a
UFO experience "really" occurred as described by the witness.  Granted,
it is impossible for any investigator to judge this absolute value;
often, a subjective value for two categories of "strangeness" and
"reliability" is assigned.  The Reliability value is a subjective value
imposed by the investigator or compiler (or both) with a scale such that
the low values represent cases with little information content and
observers of limited observing abilities and the higher values represent
those cases with excellent witnesses (pilots, police, etc.) and also are
well-investigated. Naturally, cases with higher values are preferred.
The Strangeness value is another subjective evaluation of the case, and
assigned a value of 0 to 9, based on the peculiarity of the experience.
NLs with little variance from the appearance of a star or aircraft are
given low Strangeness values, while cases involving entities or
structured craft observed at close range and therefore unlikely to be
conventional objects) are given high Strangeness values.

     The average Reliability of reports was 6.21, and the average
Strangeness was 5.64.  In other words, most UFO reports are only
slightly unusual (perhaps a light maneuvering in an odd manner unlike an
aircraft's normal flight pattern), and are either minimally-
investigated, reported by average observers, or both.

     More revealing is the ratio of Strangeness/Reliability.  This is a
measure of the unusual nature of a case versus its information content.
A ratio of unity suggests that an "uninteresting" case, probably
explained easily as a conventional object, has a low information
content.  Alternatively, unity can suggest a case with high Strangeness,
perhaps a Close Encounter, has high information content and is well-
investigated.  A ratio near zero implies a conventional object that is
well-observed and is well-investigated.  A ratio greater than unity
implies a report has high strangeness but low information content.  A
possible such case would be a close encounter case that is not well-
investigated, and may be more anecdotal than "real".

     Explained reports had an average S/R ratio of 0.586.  Cases with
Possible or Probable explanations had an average ratio of 0.690.  Cases
with Insufficient Information had ratios greater than unity, at 1.062,
and Unknown cases had an average ratio of 1.092.  From these values, we
can suggest that as the Strangeness of reports increase, so does their
likelihood of being poorly investigated and of having less credible
witnesses.

     Cases were coded and entered into an ACCESS database on a common PC
clone environment.  The coding key is as follows:

     (i.e. 2 minutes, 15 seconds is 002.15)

     Field 9 is the number of witnesses.

     Field 10 is the colour of the primary object.

     Field 11 is the shape of the primary object.

     Field 12 is the Conclusion given to the case: I = Insufficient
     information for an assessment; P = Possible or probable
     explanation, given the facts; E = Explained; or U = Unknown or
     unexplained at the present time.

     Field 13 contains any short comments that distinguish individual
     cases.

     A further breakdown of Unknowns can be done to select only those
cases with high Reliability (i.e. Reliability   8).  In the 1991 study,
only 12 cases (7.3%) were high-reliability unknowns.  In 1992, this
number was 17 cases (7.62%).  This agrees reasonably well with the 1989
results (4.9%) and with the 1990 results (4.6%), but is slightly higher
for reasons that could include sampling techniques and inconsistent
subjective evaluations.

     The interpretation of this list is that these cases were among the
most challenging of all the reports received in 1992.  It should be
noted that many UFO cases go unreported, and that there may be ten times
as many UFO sightings that go unreported as those which get reported to
public, private or military agencies.  Furthermore, it should be noted
that some cases with lower reliability ratings suffer only from
incomplete investigations, and that they may well be more mysterious
than those on the above list.

     NL Case 9920720 has erroneous data, as 1215 is hardly a nocturnal
time.  The single C4 case needs some explanation as well.  In general,
Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind are "abductions," and are difficult
to use as data in analyses.  Often, C4s occur throughout an
experiencer's life.  Furthermore, an exact time of an abduction is
rarely given or deduced by investigators.  In fact, some C4s are only
uncovered through the (controversial) use of hypnosis, and the time of
occurrence is vague or in dispute.  Because abduction experiences are
difficult to pigeonhole into various rigid categories and time
constraints, it is usually inadvisable to include such cases in UFO
report analyses.  The C4 case included in the above list did seem to
provide enough data for inclusion.  The date and time were accurately
known, and represented a single event, not an ongoing series of
experiences.  In addition, the witness voluntarily provided details of
the experience and submitted to an investigation.

     In future analyses of UFO data, it is unlikely that similar C4s
will be included.  The experiences do not lend themselves to statistical
comparisons with other UFO reports, and can be interpreted in many ways.
The C4s included in the 1992 Canadian UFO Survey provided insight into
the problems involved in their objective evaluation.

     We have learned that UFOs are constantly being reported at a rate
of about ten per month across all of Canada, and one or two per month in
most provinces.  Witnesses range from farmhands to airline pilots and
from teachers to police.  Witnesses represent all age groups and racial
origin.  What is being observed?  In most cases, only ordinary objects.
However, this begs a question.  If people are reporting things that can
be explained, then the objects they observed were "really" there.  Were
the objects we can't identify "really" there as well?  If so, what were
they?

     These are questions only continued, rational research can answer,
and only if researchers have the support and encouragement of both
scientists and the public.

                              Further Comments


     It is most instructive to compare the UFOROM analyses with those of
the National Sighting Research Center of New Jersey, headed by Paul
Ferrughelli.  The NSRC results have been reported in a series of
publications, a recent one being the National Sighting Yearbook 1991.
The NSRC collected UFO reports from newspaper clippings and UFO
publications, and analyzed the raw UFO data.  Because of the difference
in data sources, a comparison with the UFOROM results will not be true.
However, it is still interesting to compare the two studies.

     The NSRC tabulated a total of 195 American UFO reports in 1990, and
197 in 1992.  These numbers are comparable with those of Canada for the
same years.  However, because of the larger population, it is likely
that the USA had many, many more sightings that were never obtained
through the NSRC's sampling technique.


     The NSRC study revealed essentially a reversed monthly distribution
for UFO reports compared with Canada.  Whereas US sightings peaked in
the winter and had a noticeable trough in the summer, the Canadian peaks
are traditionally in the summer.  However, the 1991 Canadian
distribution was much more even, with peaks in both winter and summer.
Grouping the two studies together yields a monthly distribution with
troughs in mid-summer and mid-winter, with slight variations month-to-
month.  It is possible to speculate that with adequate report sampling,
there would be no monthly variation in the number of sightings, except
for major flaps which would be more noticeable in an international
survey.  The 1992 monthly distribution is much more uniform,  The 1992
American data had monthly distribution peaks in March, September and
October.  No such peaks were evident in the Canadian data.

     Like the Canadian study, the American data was unevenly distributed
throughout the country.  Most American reports in the 1991 study
generally came from just two states, Florida and Indiana.  The Florida
flap is likely due to the Gulf Breeze reports which receive a great deal
of media attention.  The distribution of sighting duration was nearly
identical to the Canadian study.  The average duration of a typical UFO
sighting is about 15 minutes.

     For the hourly distribution of UFO cases, the American study found
a symmetrical distribution with a pronounced peak at 9 PM local time and
a trough at around 9 AM local time.  Canadian distributions are normally
about one hour later in each peak, but are otherwise identical in
distribution.  Breakdown by Hynek classification yields identical
distributions within both American and Canadian studies, with NLs being
overwhelmingly predominant.

     In summary, Ferrughelli's analyses of American UFO data yield
results remarkably similar to the UFOROM Canadian studies, despite the
differences in collection procedures.  The most marked discrepancy
between the two studies was in the monthly distribution of UFO reports.
This was probably an artefact of the NSRC sampling technique, which does
not involve solicitation of UFO reports from investigators but
significantly relies upon newspaper accounts for many of its cases.  The
two studies are complementary, and will aid further research into the
UFO phenomenon.
