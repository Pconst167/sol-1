correspondence from a friend. He has given permission to post it.

        Telephone Conversation with Ed Dames

              12-3-91  11:15 to 12:10

A. This report is transcribed from some very rough notes.  It
   is biased toward completeness rather than verbatim accuracy.  I
   am merely reconstructing my general impression of the
   conversation.  Only the greatest uncertainties are noted
   with question marks.

B. Ed has retired for some years from Army-Pentagon (DIA?)
   intelligence work.  He has gone commercial with his remote
   viewing work with PSI Tech.  Six workers, 2 currently on
   sebatical for screwing up an assignment.  Board of directors
   and a "technical" review board that includes scientists,
   philosophers and media types (e.g. BBC science editor).  Ed
   refers to himself as a "simple Christian guy."  He and ___
   both wore the "weird hats" wrt their resp. agencies.

C. Recent projects include viewing Iraqi military(nuclear)
   installations for UN team, and helping Russians with tracing
   unusual object photographed on Mars - Phobos probe.
   Proposal for crop circle RVing, and ahve done some already.
   Circles are done by angel types.

D. In the past couple of weeks Ed has given several TV
   interviews for possible later broadcast, including one for
   "48 Hours."  Would not mind my blabbing to others or on
   computer ntwrks, but avoid using the terms "angels" or
   "metaphysics" with any media types.  Would anybody else out
   there mind - blabbing??

E. 60%(?) of their viewing work has involved UFO's.  RV's of
   many UFO events are blocked by external agency, (cosmic
   censorship?).

F. UFO type viewing encounters 2 types of entities: aliens and
   angels.  Aliens are more physical with quasi-physical type
   craft.  They are in trouble and need our resources, which
   they take, and if humans are involved they recieve mental
   impressions to confuse what is really going on.  The angels
   are policing these alien activities.  The angels technology
   is more concerned with the mental and transcendental or
   metaphysical domains.  He suggests J Vallee's "Dimensions"
   for a handle on the angels.  Ed seemed ammenable to the
   dualistic view of angels and aliens as presented in the "Ra
   Material."  It is not clear to me whether it was angels or
   aliens that are manipulating human Cs wrt UFO contact?

G. Ed uses the terms ground zero or ground truth to refer to a
   spot in SW US where much of their work is done.  The angels
   led them to this spot, indicating that it would be a good
   place for contacting aliens, about 10 yrs(?) ago.  Various
   forms of contact then occurred.  High energy voltage - fire
   works, lights near a mesa, etc(?).  Others cautioned danger
   wrt first contacts, but Ed damned the torpedoes - guardian
   angels(?).

H. We discussed eschatological implications at some length.
   His group gets indications of unavoidable bad stuff in the
   next couple(?) of decades.  Deleterious climate changes,
   storms adversely effecting agriculture.  He also foresees a
   quasi-public contact w/ UFO's near the ground zero site,
   w/in 1.5 yr.  It would be an ongoing contact, of a prophetic
   sort with both A&A's involved.  His review comm. will work
   out possible coverage.  He is not so concerned about a
   global spiritual emergency, as about the
   physical(meteorological?) emergencies.

I. Ingo Swann, his early mentor, is coming out with a book
   related to eschatology.

J. He referred to the recent meeting that Maccabee attended,
   American Optical, Sandia, McGarrity.  He said Sandia or Los
   Alamos might be best for a joint CC project w/___.  But no
   one at Pentagon.  The informal Pentagon/Industry UFO group
   had reached a dead end about two years ago.  Too much
   infighting, etc.

K. I volunteered to help out particularly with eschat. concerns
   and Ed suggested there might be work wrt the review comm.

L. Several times I asked him about resistance to his contacts
   and he expressed very little concern.
