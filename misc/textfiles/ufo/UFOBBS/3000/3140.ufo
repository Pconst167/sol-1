a number of years ago I spend a year in the Big Bend country of Texas.  Of
course many of you wil be familiar with the Marfa lights.  Those
yet-to-be-explained luminaries west of the town of Marfa.  And the Big
Bend National Park has native legends abou ghosts (the mountains there,
the "Chisos" mean ghosts.) But what about the lights I saw and others as
well, does anyone have info about them?

I heard tell of a woman who insisted that her boss ride down the mountain
at night. Both of them saw the strange lights that had followed her every
evening.  Legend?  But I saw something too, though it was only the one
time.

The road goe through a near 6000 foot pass before descending to the desert
below.  Ultimately it reaches the Rio Grande river at 1300 feet.  one
evening about 11:00 PM I was going to park headquarters and about the time
the road started getting rtelatively flat I saw a light off to the right.
Since in this very dry country fire is a constant concern and there were
no campfires allowed at the time I stoped and backed up.  It was
yellow/orange with an angular diameter similar to a 1/3 a small finger hel
at three feet.  But it was quickly gone.  Puzzling over th imiage I
realized that it was not a fire.  ALso it was not the lights from another
car, because there was a low hill or mountain between me and the road.  I
drove on.  Afer a couple of mile I came to the intersection and turned
right towards park headquarters....Then I saw the light, or an identical
one off to my left, same everyting, including the interveing mountain.

At park headquarters I saw it again off to the north/left, but this time
it was very far in the distance.  It seemed to be at the base of a far
range of cliffs, maybe twenty miles away. (IN the Big Bend you can easily
see a hundred miles from the right vantage point).  I drove north form
quite a few miles, but never saw it again.

Later, I looked at a map.  From what I could tell the three points would
have lined up on a straight line...

There are many legends and not a few sightings in this area of the
country, does anyone have any additional info?

Brad.

Does anyone have any record of similar reports?
