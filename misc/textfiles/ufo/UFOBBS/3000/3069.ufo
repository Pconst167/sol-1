The year 1991 was an unprecedented year for sightings and encounters in the
Antelope Valley of California, embracing the cities of Palmdale, Lancaster,
and Rosamond (Edwards AFB is some 20 miles east of Rosamond.) I was
investigating the reports of sightings associated with a Northrop Skunk
Works facility 20 miles west of Rosamond in the Tehachapi Mountains on the
north side of the valley, when I heard about two witnesses who had
experiences of missing time. These two women, Pam and Jackie, lived within
eyeball range of the facility and had experienced a number of strange
events. In addition, Jackie, who could see the facility clearly from her
property in the high desert, reported two daylight sightings. In each case,
she contends that she witnessed a large disk ascend from the facility and
move eastward along the base of the Tehachapis. Construction workers have
informed me that the facility itself has several underground levels.
 
On the evenlng of May 14, 1991, Pam had her strangest encounter ever.
Shortly after 11:00 pm she reports that three "grays" appeared by her
bedside and started to lift her off the bed. She lives in a large,
custom-built pentagonal desert home that has one large room without
partitions. The kitchen, bedroom and living room are open to one another.
She started to struggle with the grays-the four-and-a-half-foot
category--when she spotted a human in the living room area. The man, dressed
all in black, was holding a device that resembled a small TV and dangling a
cord. Pam heard the man say, "You have no electricity."
 
At this point she somehow freed herself from the entities and went to grab a
light cord that would switch on a light from her twelve-volt system. The
light would not come on. She then yelled for her husband to awaken. Events
then took a bizarre turn. Hearing their 100-pound labrador, Casey, barking
in the yard, she and her husband went to the north-facing kitchen window.
Her attention was drawn to a man who lay prone on a projecting part of the
roof near a ladder. The man was dressed in full-dress air force blues. The
three grays were now on the ground below the man, as well as a K-9 sentry
dogt that was poised to attack Pam's dog. In the sky over the yard there
were a number of red lights. The man yelled to the grays, "Get her out of
the house," while Pam yelled back, "Don't kill my dog."
 
In the wake of this panic, Pam next remembers standing alone outside and
behind their generator shack. The man,the dog,the grays, and her husband
were no longer in sight. Red lights were revolving above her and a thick fog
was emanating from ports set around the large craft hovering above.
 
Her next memory was that of awakening, seated on her bed at 3:50 am. I
arrived at Pam's place the next morning and spent all day with her. That
evening we had a local certified hypnotherapist, Miranda Cunha, regress Pam
through the incident. We discovered a mental block in the missing-time
period. A few tidbits emerged from this session. Pam believes that she may
have been taken to a base inside the Tehachapis (the second case that
reported this) and that she was cautioned not to reveal what she knows. She
felt very threatened by this incident. This is just a brief recounting of
only one of Pam's encounters, but significant for its mention of human
involvement and its disturbing implications. Pam is a good observer and very
precise about her experiences. Jackie reports seeing Pam's yard enveloped in
a fog that same night, but does not remember seeing the lights, which may
have been directed downward and obscured by the fog screen put out by the
object.
 
Since that night, Pam has also been buzzed by low-flying helicopters. One
military helicopter hovered less than a hundred feet over her yard. Since
there have been some remarkable sightings over this area during the year and
Pam's account raises many questions, I would like to relate other events
that enlarge the scope considerably.
 
On May 28, the night of a full moon, I went to a certain observation area in
the Antelope Valley just west of the city of Lancaster and south of the
Northrop facility in the Tehachapi mountain range. Joined by three other
observers, we saw our first aerial light emerge at the crest of the
mountains south of us. The light was white with an amber tinge. It moved
west above the mountain ridge, reached a certain point, then started
strobing fluorescent red and white lights. As it continued to move west,then
northwest, it began to jump and dance erratically. When it reached the far
end of the west valley, I could see a silhouette against the twilight blue
sky. The object appeared to be boomerang-shaped with several strobe lights
dancing around its perimeter. This object suddenly vanished. A second and
third object appeared above the same mountains and followed roughly the same
pattern of activity, except that they continued on their course to disappear
in the distance. The wild "jumpers" were sometimes so erratic that normal
aircraft could not have withstood the structural stresses that would result
from such rapid changes in motion.
 
On the following night, with thirteen other witnesses gathered at our desert
observation post, I viewed a spectacular light show starting in the same way
as the previous night's. Researchers and abductees (including Pam and
Jackie) were present. We saw between 25 and 30 objects, several of which
danced and zig-zagged in all directions. One or two of the objects also
disappeared when in clear view.
 
In addition to the strobing jumpers, we saw what appeared to be a large
craft maneuvering to the east. It appeared to be triangular with a steady
fluorescent red light on the right and an aquamarine-colored light on its
left tip. This object flew both forwards and backwards and glided silently
sideways. It turned and tilted until it came to the south end of the street
as if it were peering at us. It then tilted on its edge and turned to
proceed back to its point of origin. I snapped four photos at that instant,
but the lights failed to register on 1000 ASA Ektar film. This light show
lasted two-and-one-half hours.
 
At one point two air force jets crossed from northwest to south-east and
returned, but did not attempt to close with any of the UFOs.
 
Nearby Palmdale is the site of a major Los Angeles Air Traffic Control
Center, as well as several aerospace facllities, and Air Force Plant 42.
 
Edwards AFB is a few miles to the north, near the town of Rosamond. Yet no
aircraft were sent out to intercept these strange aerial objects! I phoned
the Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office the next day, and the officer on duty
was extremely interested in our sightings, but could not offer no immediate
explanation for them except to say that he was aware that the Antelope
Valley had several secret projects that might involve advanced technology
aircraft, and that he had no access to that sort of information.
 
We feel that the people on these secret projects are well aware of what is
flying in the skies over Lancaster. In the early morning hours of July 25,
Pam and I were watching the valley skies, as we had made it a sort of ritual
during the warm summer nights. At 12:45 am, a string of gold-colored lights
approached silently and rapidly from the west, moving east. The golden
lights were surrounded by a coronal field that may have been ionized layers
of plasma. Some of this "plasma" appeared to be shedding from its source and
trailing behind. As the string reached the city limits of Lancaster, the
lights disappeared one by one.
 
At least two other sighting parties viewed this same light string from
separate locations. One of the other parties had a camcorder and starlight
scope, and videotaped this procession of lights. I have a VHS copy of the
tape. After one of the other witnesses mentioned the starlight scope's
ability to enhance night photography to his neighbor, his neighbor bought
one, and on the night of August 1 tested its ability to record the passage
of an airliner over downtown Lancaster. To his surprise, a small lighted
object appeared and raced around the airliner, executing a sharp-angled,
high-speed fly-around, and then faded out against the background stars. I
also have this segment on video and  have shown it on San Diego's ABC
affiliate Channel 10, which did a special report on UFOs on their nightly
news in late October.
 
One of the most spectacular sightings occurred on November 4. While driving
to work in the morning, Pam spotted a triangular shape over the Antelope
Valley Freeway (Highway 14) at 7:11 a.m. It gave off a bright flash of gold
and green. She was headed south on 60th Street West when the triangular
object appeared. She then entered the freeway traveling south toward
Lancaster.
 
At 7:18 am, a very large charcoal-black, arrowhead-shaped vehicle passed
over her pickup truck, which was headed north over the Avenue H overpass. It
had no windows or openings. Running the whole length of the bottom of the
craft was a tubular structure. The craft had no vertical stabilizers and
made no sound. It was traveling very slowly. She estimated its attitude as
300 to 500 feet (very low) and its dimensions as a football field in length
(300 feet) and as wide as the freeway, including the central corridor and
pullovers (about 80 feet). She exited at Avenue I and pulled into an ARCO
station and quickly jumped out to look for the object. The object was
nowhere in sight.
 
There have been other peculiar activities and light shows reported to me
from the east side of the valley. Some of these sightings are in the
vicinity of another secret underground facility owned by McDonnell-Douglas
Corporation. Near this facility is El Mirage Dry Lake and Shadow  Mountain.
A team of skywatchers from Victorville has seen many strange balls of light
and one huge lighted craft near Shadow Mountain. They have also reported
seeing an identical string of lights on several occasions similar to the one
we viewed on July 25.
 
Another abduction case was reported in the Victorville area. The abductee,
Diane, reported being taken to an underground facility jointly occupied by
grays and men in air force uniforms.
 
A Victorville psychotherapist is doing extensive work on this case. If we
take these reports seriously, and do not dismiss them as a product of the
witness' imagination, then there are significant implications in the
content of such reports.
 
The few informants from the aerospace sector who have approached me have
done little more than cautiously confirm the existence of these underground
bases, the reality of the alien presence, and verified advanced technology
projects. I am not advocating a wholesale belief in any conspiracy scenario
nor do I believe all the tales I hear,
 but I am advocating a need for
further careful and cautious investigation based on eye-witness testimony.
 
The light shows over Lancaster continue. The "jumpers" are still seen
frequently. Sky watchers are flocking to the Antelope Valley in hopes of
seeing UFOs.
