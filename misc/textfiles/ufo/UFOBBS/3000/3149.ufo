For your information, there is probably little chance of any classified
aircraft offloading at Boeing Field.  Boeing field lies between two of the
busiest highways in Washington State and the north ends of the two runways
are only about a mile or so from downtown Seattle.  There is a clear view
of absolutely everything on the field from a two mile stretch of I-90 with
the highway about a hundred feet above the two runways for most of this
length.
 
There is very little hangar space at Boeing field for large aircraft and
even a C-5A landing there would cause conversation all over Seattle
regardless of the time of day it landed.
 
However, at the south end of Boeing's factory area on the airport is a
blue and white (Boeing's colors) aircraft (747) with a specially designed
hump on its back which is supposedly an SDI test bed.  There are two
"doors" in this hump on the left side through which the laser or beam
weapons can be fired.
 
There is almost no ability to keep a secret on Boeing Field as this is a
very busy general aviation airport and the Air and Space Museum is located
very near this special 747.
 
If the aircraft in the article above were cleared for Boeing field, it
either carried another aircraft to the museum or landed somewhere else.
 
Boeing does operate out of an isolated airport in Washington State at
Moses Lake (119 deg 17 min W, 47 deg 10 min N).  Even this site has
residential areas bordering the field which is a county airport.
