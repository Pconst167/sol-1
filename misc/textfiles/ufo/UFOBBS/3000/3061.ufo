Topic: ALIEN ON ICE   
 
Does anyone know the history of GIF file called alien3.gif, with the
discription "Alien on ice"? That's the way it's listed on the "File Bank" in
Denver. 303-534-4646
It appears to be a somewhat dessicated alien corpse. The upper chest, mouth,
nostrils and something like a cheek area are visible. Presumably the large
eyes are covered with a frosty ice build up (like one would get in any deep
freeze). I and some friends have done some basic enhancing of the gif file,
and have found some very interesting and convincing segmented structures in
the left nostril and a corresponding area in the right that seems to be more
involved with ice (or frost) build up and not as distinct, but about the same
size and shape. With a little work we also brougt out small evenly spaced
light colored "pegs" just where the teeth in more familiar species would be.
The nose is also very unique and would be highly creative if it were a hoax.
It's a long verticle FLAT bone that appears to be about .75 inches wide and
as long as most of the exposed face. It's the most interesting image I've
seen to date and would like a little background on how the photo was
obtained, when, by whom and any comments on the experience.
The file may be called something else on other boards. ...Hope the
discription helps!
Thank You...

        About a week ago a few people on here were discussing gifs 
of a "dead alien". If these are the same GIFs that are listed on 
Clark Matthew's system (The Wrong Number BBS) I believe I have 
identified the creature in the pictures.
        Back during the last century sailors would catch rays, cut 
the fins off, dry them, and then sell them to the gullible as "Jenny 
Hanivers", "Sea Monks", or a variety of other names. Several books 
about sealore and sea serpents mention these and there are pictures 
of them available. The pictures are identical to the creature seen 
in the GIFs. 
        It is definitely NOT a dead alien. The obvious gills in the 
closeup of the "head" are what gave it away.
