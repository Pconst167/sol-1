Thanks for the detailed reply. But I am a little confused.

Is this a book about the Hudson Sightings?

 What do you mean by a "real unknown object"? Everything that you
describe below is of terrrestrial origin. In fact while the facts are
very interesting, I see nothing there that has to do with
extraterrestrail craft, aliens, etc It all sounds like a CIA training
center for operations like gun running etc. Not having military
experience I am not sure, but "Restricted" does not seem like very high
level secrecy or security. Many things on military bases are restricted,
and the response to the journalist's intrusion seems completely normal
to me, especially if the CIA is operating there. No need to introduce
the UFO theme. Even the cattle mutilation idea is speculation. If the
USDA is transporting infected cattle for example what better thing to
do with them than keep them in a government area.

I am not criticizing the research or facts, in fact I am very impressed
by them, but I just don't see why we should assume that UFOs are
involved, except in so far as the flights are mistaken for them.

Keep in mind that the O-2 is actually a twin engine aircraft.  It is the
military version of the Cessna "Skymaster" with one engine mounted in the
nose, and one mounted pointing aft, between the two tail booms.  It is not a
high-tech aircraft at all, but merely a utility/liason aircraft used for
Forward Air Control duties in Vietnam.  An on-board flight computer for
"stability" is highly unlikely, although the type of formation flying
discussed in this article could be accomplished with NO PROBLEM by any
proficient military pilot, especially in an aircraft flying at moderate
speeds
(such as would be flown in the O-2 - well under 300 mph).
