Hi All,                                                     
As a follow-up to Beth's article, the following is an       
article from the August 1992 issue of Popular Science, page 
22:                                                         
                WHAT HYPERSONIC AIRPLANE?                   
Something (in italics) very strange is flying around at     
terrific speeds.  Although no one has managed to -------->  
photograph the craft itself, its radar image, unique exhaust
contrail, engine sound, and sonic boom have all been        
characterized in multiple reports by observers in the       
Western United States and Great Britain.  Yet, questions    
directed to the prime suspect in mystery-plane cases - the  
U.S. Air Force - yield only denials of any knowledge.       
                                                            
The aircraft, betraying its shadowy presence may be a high- 
altitude hypersonic spy plane code-named "Aurora" that's    
presumed to have replaced the retired SR-71 Blackbird (see  
"Revealed! Mach 5 Spy Plane," Nov. 88).  On five occasions->
since June 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey's extensive     
network of earthquake-monitoring seismographs in Southern   
California has recorded window-rattling sonic booms produced
by an airplane traveling northeast at several times the     
speed of sound.                                             
                                                            
The booms have all occurred on Thursdays at about 7:00 a.m.,
says U.S. Geological Survey seismologist James J. Mori at   
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. "We call
them airquakes," he says. "This mystery plane has a         
distinctly different sonic-boom waveform than other large-->
supersonic aircraft like the space shuttle and the SR-71.   
"We track it because people have been calling us wanting to 
know if there's been an earthquake."                        
                                                            
Many observers in several states have reported hearing very 
loud, deep rumbling and pulsating sounds coming from an     
aircraft moving at high speed.  An aircraft emitting these  
sounds was spotted this past February taking off at night   
from Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif.  Its      
propulsion system may be a pulse detonation wave engine - a 
known type that develops thrust in intermittent bursts, --->
rather than continuously - according to reports in the trade
journal Aviation Week & Space Technology.                   
                                                            
Bill Sweetman, an ecpert on classified "Black" military     
PRODIGY(R) interactive personal service         10/04/92         7:30 PM

programs, suggests in Jane's Defense Weekly that the        
aircraft may be capable of reaching Mach 6 (4000 mph)       
burning liquid methane or hydrogen fuel.  He believes the   
plane is returning from hypersonic (greater than Mach 5)    
flights over the Pacific Ocean and decelerating over the Los
Angeles area as it heads northeast for a landing at the     
highly classified flight test base at Groom Lake, Nevada.-->
Sweetman reports that a Royal Air Force air traffic         
controller tracked an aircraft leaving the remote NATO-RAF  
base at Machrihanish in western Scotland last November at a 
speed of Mach 3.  No acknowledged aircraft capable of such  
speed is based there.

This is the final paragraph from the article that appeared  
in the August 1992 issue of Popular Science.

Call it Aurora, the mystery plane, or whatever.  The ultra  
fast, groundshaking high flyer may be one of the latest --->
in the long line of exotic aircraft that have resulted from 
Lockheed Corp.'s fabled Skunk Works.  Financial analysts    
note that the company's budget and work force can only be   
fully acconted for by one or more substancial black programs
secretly funded by the Pentagon - and perhaps the           
intelligence services.

This is the end of the article.  Accompanying the article   
are two photographs of the contrail of this aircraft and a  
seismic profile chart.
