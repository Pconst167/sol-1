20 SIGNS OF CLOSE EXTRATERRESTIAL ENCOUNTER
(by Richard J. Boylan, Ph.D.)

1. Unexplained persistent anxiety or restlessness after experiencing an
event which has no ordinary explanation.

2. A strong fearful reaction when confronted with objects, pictures,
stories, films, etc. which are associated with close extraterrestial
encounter.

3. Persistent insomnia after a highly unusual event, and/or nightmares
with themes of UFOs, extraterrestials, or close encounters.

4. Repeated daytime thinking about, or daydreaming about, or extremely
vivid "dreams" about UFOs, extraterrestials, or close encounters.

5. Compulsive behavior concerning UFOs or ETs, such as voluminous
reading.

6. Unexplained moodiness or irritability after an anomalous incident.

7. Body symptoms or marks characteristic of a close extraterrestial
encounter.

8. Experiencing an unexplained substantial period of missing time
following an anomalous incident.

9. Having sudden onset of feelings of social unordinariness.

10. Experiencing a new cosmic awareness and perspective, which
frequently breaks into one's daily thinking.

11. Suddenly feeling an affinity for CE-IV experiencers one sees or
reads about, or feeling an attraction to extraterrestials as somehow
familiar.

12. Having the sense of having received telepathic messages from the
extraterrestials, or repeatedly receiving gifted intuitions.

13. Having a sense of sharing the space in one's mind with an
extraterrestial.

14. Noticing the beginning of psychic ability, or, if already psychic,
noticing a marked increase in psychic abilities.

15. Feeling attracted to a spirituality or religious practice which is
based on the in-dwelling of the supreme source in all nature, and, as a
result, the importance of reverencing all lifeforms as related to you.

16. Having a longing for that extraterrestial individual with whom a
person has primarily had contact, especially over repeated visits.

17. Having an obsessive sense of mission, (whether clearly understood,
vague, or repressed into unconscious mind), acquired during the close
encounter.

18. Having a strong "pull" to travel to a specific area, either with an
intuition that a close encounter is impending, or for an unknown
reason, (which turns out to be a close encounter.)

19. Having a sense of partial extraterrestial heritage, either by
reason of sharing an extraterrestial perspective on the earth
situation, or having partial shared genetic heritage with certain
extraterrestials, or having somehow had an extraterrestial as one
biological parent, or having a sense of having been born elsewhere.

20. Having a sense that one's destiny is with the ETs elsewhere in the
galaxy, or a "pull" to go to one's final home, which is an
extraterrestial planet one was shown by the ETs during a close
encounter.
