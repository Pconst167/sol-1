                Golden Ears Mountain UFO Update

On Sept. 5/93 there was a rescue operation on top of the
Golden Ears mountain between 9-10.30 pm. During that period of
time there were flares released and a helicopter as well as an
airplane present from the Canadian Armed Forces out of Comox.
I spoke with those people the next day after receiving
numerous reports of UFO's. At that time I was convinced that
the public was witnessing flares and we had a classic case of
mis-identification. However, after receiving many more reports
due to newspaper articles we discovered many independent sets
of witnesses and crowds of witnesses who claimed that two
separate events were taking place over the area, ie; the
flares were being released at a lower elevation and other
anomalous activity was taking place at a higher elevation.
Witnesses were reporting that the flares were gradually
descending and giving off a yellowish glow and other higher
altitude objects were stationary for great lengths of time,
were making 'square, triangular, straight line formations and
playing tag'. 

So many witnesses reported this phenomenon that we were forced
to reassess our conclusions, particularly in light of the fact
that we were still receiving reports of the unidentified
phenomenon up to 02.30 am. long after the rescue operation
ceased and before it had been made public. We also received
reports of lights over the Golden Ears mountains on August
31st and September 2nd. Reports coming in from Coquitlam
(where the mountain is located) since the rescue operation
describes a brilliant light which has rotating green & red
flashing lights, quite different from the reports we received
both before & during the search & rescue operation. the names
and telephone numbers of the witnesses are on file with our
Institute and some of them have been made public. many of the
witnesses of reports called into our organization were not
aware of previous events reported.

If this were not enough, another mass sighting occurred on
September 10th 1993 in the city of Surrey which is very close
to Coquitlam. A number of witnesses poured out into the street
to watch a very large circular object the size of three
passenger planes hover over their apartment complex. It made
no noise, had a circumference of fast strobing red lights and
was seen at dusk while there was still light. It appeared made
of solid grey metal and was too thin for a human to stand
fully erect inside of. The geographical location is fairly
isolated but there are many living quarters in the specific
area. the object was seen after 10-15 seconds to tilt on it's
side and to shoot away at a high speed. At it's closest point
the vehicle was no more than 100 feet above the witnesses.
