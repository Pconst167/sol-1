Abductions by aliens usually not little green men with antennae, but gray or
white men about 3 feet tall have traumatized dozens of people in Michigan.
But they aren't suffering alone, according to a Flushing woman, who had an
experience with little gray extraterrestrials herself & found they cured her
of lupus & Addison's disease, a serious adrenal gland dysfunction. Shirley
Coyne says her abduction occurred on a hot summer night in 1983, when she saw
the bright light of a domed UFO moving over a corn field near her home. She
said she awoke her husband, George, & they ran outside barefoot to look at
it. The last thing they remembered was the feel of grass on their feet. Then
they were back in bed, said Mrs. Coyne, adding that her memories were revived
through hypnosis sessions. "It was very traumatic but you get over it," said
Coyne, reached Sunday at a three-day Ozark UFO conference in Eureka Springs,
Ark. Coyne & her husband helped organize a support group for alien abductees,
which she said has had a 100-percent success rate in helping people over
their trauma. "In Michigan we have 60 people we're working with who have
already gone through different stages of hypnosis & probably 20 to 30
waiting to be regressed (hypnotized)," Coyne said. "We've a certified
hypnotist & a clinical psychologist." Coyne said the support group is like
any other, helping helps people learn to deal with & accept the experience.
She said at least one person who had an abduction experience with aliens was
in an institution before meeting with the group but now is living a normal
life. "There are many who have gone through who aren't able to hold down
jobs. They barely function," she said. "There are others who are able to
cope with it very well." She estimated there were similar support groups in
at least 23 other states. Ed Mazur, Arkansas director of Mutual UFO Network,
said Coyne's story isn't unusual. Mazur said he's working with about four
abduction cases in Arkansas. Michael Swords, a professor of natural sciences
at Western Michigan University & editor of the Journal of UFO Studies, said
he believes support groups are helpful as long as they are "essentially
healthy. From what I'm hearing, it sounds as if support groups, as long as
they don't markedly demand certain behavior, are good for people," Swords
said. "There might be some professionals who disagree." Swords said,
however, that some researchers believe reports of alien abduction may be a
"shield fantasy" for some people, developed as part of a neurosis. Swords
said those researchers think the cause of the neurosis may be stress, a
desire to be "involved" or even a bad experience in childhood. Swords, who
earned a doctoral degree in the history of science from Case Western Reserve
University, said there seem to be a lot of abductions of people reported, but
it's not nearly as high as the number of reported UFO sightings. He also said
it's always hard to investigate the reports. "It may be as real as tomorrow's
breakfast" to the victim, Swords said, "but as long as there's no conclusive
evidence sitting there you still have to say, `I'm empathetic with you, I'd
like to believe you, but the evidence is just not there.'"
