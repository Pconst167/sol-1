SUBJECT: AM I AN ABDUCTEE ?                                  FILE: UFO3036



    
    
                               AM I AN ABDUCTEE? 
    
      Three weeks ago I went camping with my best friend,  the special type 
    of  friend to whom you can  tell anything,  no matter how incredible it 
    may  sound.  I  had planned the weekend carefully;  we spent two nights 
    nestled   in  the  heart  of  an  old-growth  redwood  forest   at   an 
    environmental  campsite,   far  removed from the  distractions  of  our 
    ordinary lives and of other noisy campers.  Within the secluded comfort 
    of our wilderness setting, I  proceeded to tell her exactly what was on 
    my mind:  "I think that I may have been abducted by extraterrestrials!" 
    After regaining her composure over the initial shock, she listened as I 
    recounted,  in depth, the numerous events which led me to consider such 
    a preposterous idea.  I  tried to illuminate my experiences by  drawing 
    parallels to recent books which had been written on the subject,  since 
    my  friend  was totally ignorant in the matter.  The campfire near  its 
    end, my body growing tired after hours of discussion,  she left me with 
    one  basic thought when I had finished my tale:  "Books by people  like 
    Whitley Streiber and Bud Hopkins sell so well because people  empathize 
    with  the  main  character.  They are people who  desperately  want  to 
    believe  that  they too  have been a part of the experience,  and  have 
    touched  the unknowable."  My friend obviously felt that I was deluding 
    myself.  It is true that I have had a life-long interest in the subject 
    of UFOs. I have read a vast number of books written on the subject over 
    the past ten years.  The first UFO book I'd ever read was in the eighth 
    grade,   one  about George Adamski.  Even earlier,  in  1969,   I   was 
    preoccupied with drawing pictures of "aliens"  during the art period in 
    first grade. Stretching back to the earliest limits of my memory, I can 
    recall when,  in 1964 or '65 at the age of 3, I  ran screaming from the 
    room in terror as I watched an "alien"  on an episode of The  Munsters. 
    Of interest is that I had never been the least bit scared of any of the 
    regular  Munster  characters,   but the sight  of  an  extraterrestrial 
    absolutely  horrified me.  My life has been dotted with  minor  strange 
    anomalies,  all of which I have filed away as "unsolved mysteries", and 
    forgotten.   I  usually deal with problems that way.  When any conflict 
    occurs in my life,  I tend to ignore it first,  hoping that whatever it 
    is  will  blow over,  so I can forget it.  If the first step fails,   I 
    usually  try to find a book or two on the subject which might help  me. 
    When  a book doesn't provide me with the necessary tools,   I   usually 
    discuss  that problem with a friend.  It would seem like I have such  a 
    problem now, and I am discussing it with you. Something has been eating 
    away at me for the past six months or so, and I'm not sure exactly what 
    it  is.  In one semester,  my grade point average has dropped  from  an 
    outstanding 3.56  over the past 76.5  semester units in college,  to  a 
    rock bottom 0.00  for the 1990  Spring semester; I  failed every class! 
    Also,  I  have taken to drinking far more often than I should.  I  have 
    this fantasy that if I've had a few glasses of wine before I go to bed, 
    then  I'll  be useless to the nocturnal visitors,  and  they  will  not 
    bother me.  That might seem to be the case, because I have never had an 
    unusual nocturnal experience after drinking.  (Of course I realize that 
    there  are probably people in New York who are convinced that  crossing 
    their fingers will keep wild lions away!  In other words,  my statement 
    is  an illogical syllogism,  in which the premises do not  warrant  the 
    conclusion.) Additionally, my sleeping pattern has changed drastically. 
    Over  the past six months or so,  I  have avoided sleeping  each  night 
    until I was utterly exhausted.  Currently, I am staying up until abo ut 
    5:00 am, and sleeping until 1 pm. Although I desperately need the extra 
    income from a Summer job,  I have avoided getting one because I knew it 
    would mean going back to a normal sleeping schedule.  I  put to you the 
    following dilemma:  Has my life-long interest in UFOs finally caused me 
    to  go off the deep end,  whereby I have deluded myself into  believing 
    that I may have had numerous abduction experiences?  Or,  have I  truly 
    been subject to numerous abductions throughout my life,  and my way  of 
    dealing with it has been to investigate the phenomena? At this point in 
    time,   I  would consider either hypothesis equally,  but I desperately 
    want  to  know which is the cause,  and which is the  effect!   In  the 
    following  paragraphs I will relate my experiences as accurately and as 
    unbiased  as  I am able.  It is my hope that someone reading this  will 
    provide  me  with further insights,  or that this document  will  spark 
    further  investigation,  so that I can finally know the ultimate  truth 
    behind it all,  not only for my own peace-of-mind,  but for others  who 
    may be in a similar situation. 
    
                             --------------------- 
    
    On April 3, 1990  I decided to call on an old friend who I hadn't heard 
    from in over two years. My friend, Carolina, is a gifted psychic, and a 
    well-kept secret.  Santa Rosa has its share of palm-readers and fortune 
    tellers,  but  Carolina is in an  entirely different league.  A  deeply 
    spiritual person, Carolina has never sought recognition, publicity,  or 
    a rep utation for her abilities,  nor has she ever taken any money from 
    me  for her services.  I'm not exactly sure why I felt compelled to see 
    her that day; I had nothing in particular on my mind. It was a pleasant 
    reunion.  We chatted for some time, and then Carolina decided to see if 
    there was anything "out there"   that  she could "pick up" for me.  She 
    proceeded to give me  a  reading  lasting nearly an hour.  It must have 
    been an exceptionally good day for her,  because  there  was a lot "out 
    there"  and it was amazingly  accurate. Among other things, she told me 
    that I had a blood  disorder,  and that she kept seeing "too much red"; 
    she sensed that I would be quitting smoking soon,  and informed me that 
    I  would  be successful;  she told me that my mother was about to  fall 
    ill; she told me my father might loose a toe due to gangrene;  and most 
    amazingly,  with a surprized  and quizzical look on her face, she asked 
    me "Have you recently had contact with extraterrestrials?"  Up to  that 
    point, everything she told me had been phrased as a statement, but this 
    was apparently so preposterous that even she doubted it, and phrased it 
    as  a question instead.  I  was completely taken aback by her query-  I 
    hadn't thought about aliens or UFOs in years.  Caroli na had absolutely 
    no idea that it had been  a former interest of mine.  For a moment time 
    seemed to stand still-  on the inside, I  thought that she was entirely 
    off-base, and I was ready to tell her so,  but my body seemed to have a 
    mind  of its own  as  I watched myself mumble, "I don't know." I  still 
    wonder why I said that, because it truly betrayed what I was feeling at 
    the moment.   She immediately answered back by saying,  "I think you do 
    know, because I'm seeing this very clearly now." 
    
      At that statement,  I felt the flush of anger course through my body. 
    I felt like a man who had just been told he was about to die, and given 
    the exact date.  I  blurted out,  "I don't think you're supposed to  be 
    telling  me this!  If you saw that I was going to be killed next  week, 
    would you tell me that too?" Carolina smiled and said,  "They only show 
    me  what I can tell a person.  If you're not meant to know,  my  guides 
    don't show me."  My stomach tight and my heart racing, I replied,  "But 
    don't you think this is a little too scary?"  Again smiling,  she said, 
    "Oh,  it's only scary in a fun kind of way." For a moment I thought she 
    was being sarcastic.  "How could she be so insensitive to my anxiety?", 
    I thought.  I felt the anger well up from within me again. "Fun!,  What 
    the  hell  is  so  fun about being poked and prodded  and  violated  by 
    hideously  ugly creatures in the middle of the night!",  I  thought  to 
    myself. And then something snapped. I thought to myself, "What in God's 
    name  am  I thinking about?  Why has such an  innocent  statement  from 
    Carolina caused such fear and anger within me? What is this about being 
    poked, prodded, and violated? Where did I get that from? Carolina never 
    said  anything  about  that!"   And then I  realized  that  my  outward 
    appearance was betraying my inner anxiety. True to my English blood,  I 
    appeared quite calm and collected to Carolina,  even though my mind and 
    heart  were racing.  She apparently didn't realize the implications and 
    consequences  of her revelation to me.  "This is a first for me,"   she 
    said,   "In  all  my  years,  I  have never picked  up  anything  about 
    extraterrestrials from a person." "Surely you have at least read a book 
    or two on the subject",  I replied. "No, I never have," she said, "It's 
    never interested me in the least. There are too many problems down here 
    to  be worried about what might or might not be going on up there."   I 
    was  amazed.   Like a curtain being lifted in my memory,   I   suddenly 
    remembered  a  night  about  two weeks prior during  which  an  unusual 
    occurrence  had  happened.   It  surprized me that I  hadn't  made  the 
    connection sooner.  I was sure this was what she was referring to!  (to 
    be discussed in full later) Carolina continued her reading,  and didn't 
    dwell on the subject of aliens, as if they were relatively unimportant. 
    Twice more during that hour,  she made reference to them,  although she 
    had  no idea she was doing so.  She said she had the image of an insect 
    with  large eyes,  but that it was symbolic,  and I would know what  it 
    meant.   (I  am sure this is symbolic for an alien.)  Later,  she  made 
    reference to "burrowing",  but couldn't get anything further.  (My  gut 
    feeling was that this is connected to them also,  but I'm not sure  why 
    or  how.)   The  following week I thought a lot  about  my  visit  with 
    Carolina  as I watched her short term predictions come true one by one. 
    Although  she  had no way of knowing that I was  planning  on  quitting 
    smoking,   almost  a month prior I had consented to  participate  in  a 
    clinical  study  at Stanford Medical Center for the approval of  a  new 
    drug by the FDA.  It was a double-blind, placebo vs. real study to test 
    the efficacy of the transdermal nicotine patch as a therapy for smoking 
    cessation.  Requisite to participating in the study,  I  had a complete 
    physical during my first visit on March 28.  On April 5, I  returned to 
    pick up my supply of nicotine patches,  but I was shocked to learn that 
    I had failed the blood test!  Although I was not disqualified from  the 
    study,   Dr.   Sachs  informed  me  that I had  a  condition  known  as 
    "polycythemia", and advised me to see a hematologist. Polycythemia, the 
    exact  opposite  of anaemia,  is the condition of having too  many  red 
    blood  cells.   Although smokers almost always have  slightly  elevated 
    hemoglobin and red cell counts,  mine was far too high to be  explained 
    by  such.   The  doctor  explained that it  can  be  caused  by  spleen 
    dysfunction,  but, that didn't appear to be my case,  as indicated from 
    the other test results of my physical.  He told me that having too many 
    oxygen-carrying  red  blood cells is usually the  result  of  prolonged 
    exposure to thin atmosphere,  and that athletes sometimes take  illegal 
    drugs to achieve such an effect in order to increase their endurance in 
    high  altitudes  (such as in the marathon up Pike's Peak  every  year.) 
    Further, he informed me that my ruddy complexion was most likely due to 
    the blood disease.  I was shocked! Not only was Carolina correct, but I 
    seriously  began  to wonder if this had anything to  do  with  possible 
    alien contact,  and "thin atmosphere."  For almost a year,  friends had 
    asking  me if I had a sunburn,  but I always dismissed it.  On  Friday, 
    April  6,   I  quit smoking.  Later that day my father called  me  from 
    Indiana  to  inform me that my mother had taken ill,  and  was  in  the 
    hospital.   She had a flare-up of her mitral valve heart condition,   a 
    bladder  infection,   and  an  extreme case of  shingles.   During  our 
    conversation,   my father told me that he wasn't doing so well himself; 
    he  has  diabetes,   and  his  big toe  had  turned  completely  black! 
    "OhmyGodOhmyGodOhmyGod...", my mind was reeling, "how could Carolina be 
    so correct about everything!",  I  thought to myself,  "If she has been 
    right about everything so far,  what am I to think about her claim that 
    I  have been in contact with extraterrestrials?"  As I  have  mentioned 
    earlier  in  this  paper,  during my visit  with  Carolina  I  suddenly 
    remembered a night,  sometime in March, where there had been an unusual 
    occurrence.  I can't recall exactly what day it was, but Jim,  my lover 
    and  companion  of ten years,  confronted me as soon as he had  awoken, 
    "You  haven't  gone out this morning for anything,   have  you?"   "No, 
    honey,"   Ireplied,  still dressed in my nightshirt and sitting at  the 
    computer,   "does it look like it?"  "Well the door is  unlocked,"   he 
    informed me.  I got up immediately,  and Jim demonstrated that both the 
    dead  bolt  and the doorknob latch were undone.  I  thought  about  the 
    matter for a few moments and said "Are you sure you didn't open it when 
    you got up? I remember double checking it before I went to bed,  and it 
    was already locked." Jim replied, "I remember checking it before I went 
    to bed also, and it was locked then too." After a few moments he added, 
    "It's possible that I may have unlocked the dead bolt without thinking, 
    but that wouldn't explain why the doorknob latch is undone."  (The door 
    handle  has  to be turned to open the door from the inside  before  the 
    doorknob  latch  is undone,  and we never open the front  door  in  the 
    morning until we're ready to go out,  since we do not subscribe to  any 
    newspapers.   If  for some reason we want to check on the weather,   we 
    always  open the sliding balcony door.  Neither Jim or I would think of 
    opening the front door while still in our nightclothes.) The matter was 
    out of my mind within a few minutes,  but Jim was not about to let  the 
    subject drop. He made me call the manager that afternoon to ask if they 
    or  any  maintenance  people  had been in  our  apartment  without  our 
    consent.  The manager assured me that they had not,  and said that they 
    would  always consult us before such an intrusion.  Jim became obsessed 
    with  the matter,  and forced me to recreate every step I had taken the 
    night before. After all the thinking he made me do, I  just became more 
    sure that I had checked the lock at night, and certainly had not opened 
    it in the morning. Before going to bed the next night,  Jim stacked two 
    spare  stereo speakers up against the front door,  so that  if  someone 
    were to open it,  they would come tumbling down and alert him. Jim is a 
    very  light  sleeper;   he had served in the armed  forces  during  the 
    Vietnam War,  and his father was a policeman, which may help to explain 
    why the thought of someone breaking into our apartment bothered him  so 
    much.   I   also noticed that he made sure the baseball bat was  within 
    reach of the bed that night.  The following morning, I  awoke first.  I 
    stumbled  out of bed and headed for the computer,  my  morning  ritual. 
    Along the way to the den, I noticed that the stereo speakers Jim had so 
    carefully  set  out the night before were strewn across the  floor.   I 
    guess the seriousness of the situation didn't hit me at first.  It took 
    me  a few minutes before I decided to go back into the front  room  and 
    check the lock.  One would think that I should have been alarmed at the 
    prospect of someone breaking in,  but honestly,  my thoughts were  only 
    about how alarmed Jim was going to be when he discovered the situation. 
    I checked the door, and it was locked. I  told myself that the speakers 
    had somehow accidentally fallen over in the night,  and I stacked  them 
    back up again, hoping that I could conceal it from Jim. 
    
      I  returned to the computer,  but couldn't concentrate on what I  was 
    doing; my conscience was bothering me. Jim and I have an extremely open 
    and honest relationship, much more so than any married couple I've ever 
    met. I went back out and put the speakers as I had found them, deciding 
    to  let him know the truth.  I'm not sure what Jim really thought.   He 
    found  it hard to accept that the speakers had fallen over without  his 
    hearing them.  Further,  he questioned why the door was locked from the 
    inside,   and  yet the speakers had been knocked over.  He  thought  my 
    behavior was particularly odd, in that I had initially tried to conceal 
    the fallen speakers, but then put them back as I had found them. At any 
    rate,  we never discussed the subject again,  and I was glad!  I   just 
    wanted to forget about the whole thing.  Every night for several weeks, 
    Jim  jammed the plastic runner up against the front door,  but  nothing 
    else unusual happened. Sometime later that week, I developed a somewhat 
    painful  subcutaneous pimple in my pubic hair region.  I  didn't  think 
    much about it at the time, except that I had never had a pimple in that 
    area before,  nor one as deep below the skin and as painful.  I  forgot 
    all  about  this until just recently,  on July 19,   when  I  developed 
    another pimple in the same area,  just after another unusual  nocturnal 
    experience.   It  took me some time before I could accurately  place  a 
    time-frame on the occurrence of my first pimple.  April 11, I  flew out 
    to Chicago to visit my mother in the hospital,  and forced my father to 
    have  his  bad toe looked at.  Sometime while I was away,  Jim  stopped 
    protecting  the  door  every night and eventually forgot about  it.   I 
    returned home April 18,  just in time to greet our house-guest from Los 
    Angeles,  our good friend, Dave. During his visit with us, I  took Dave 
    aside and told him of the strange events in March, and of what Carolina 
    had said.  I convinced him to try and hypnotize me,  so that I might be 
    able  to  recall  the event s more clearly.  It took a  great  deal  of 
    persuasion to talk him into it, since he said that he had no experience 
    at hypnosis, and was not eager to try. Nevertheless, he eventually gave 
    in,  but we had mixed results at the effort. Nothing of interest really 
    occurred,   except  that the following morning I felt  really  negative 
    about  the whole thing and destroyed the tape-recorded transcript of my 
    hypnosis session. I didn't remember what I had said, and at that point, 
    I didn't want to either.  I never admitted to Dave what had happened to 
    the tape. Before he left for Los Angeles,  Dave warned me that anything 
    I  might  try to find out about my possible abduction experience  would 
    most  likely be contaminated by all the books I've read.  Life went  on 
    more-or-less  as usual for the next several months.  I  resumed smoking 
    again, my performance at school dropped sharply, and I started drinking 
    before going to bed.  When Summer came,  I  avoided getting a job,  and 
    stayed  up later and later every night.  I  tried to put the subject of 
    UFOs out of my mind, but only with marginal success. My attitude on the 
    subject fluctuated from wishing that I could forget it all,  to  openly 
    inviting  another  experience.  Twice I purposefully  went  camping  in 
    extremely  remote  areas,   hoping that I could  induce  an  abduction. 
    Needless  to  say,   my  effort was futile (at least as far  as  I  can 
    remember.)   If  aliens  were abducting me,  then they  had  their  own 
    schedule, and my invitation didn't matter one bit. Then on July 17,  it 
    happened again.  I had been plagued by an uneasy feeling all evening. I 
    thought about having a glass of wine,  but Jim coaxed me into bed early 
    that  night (around 2 am),  telling me we needed to get up by a  decent 
    hour  the  next day.  I  am normally a very heavy sleeper,  and I  fall 
    asleep quickly,  but that night was to be an exception. I  laid in bed, 
    tossing  and  turning for what seemed like hours,  never truly  falling 
    asleep.   I   can recall listening to the slow,  deep rhythm  of  Jim's 
    breathing  pattern,   and being surprised that my  restlessness  wasn't 
    disturbing him.  The last thing I remember is the sensation of my heart 
    pounding  rapidly  as  I  was overcome with  extreme  fear.   And  then 
    suddenly,  it was light out!  A  thought entered my head,  but before I 
    could  think  further,   "Rap Rap Rap",   three  loud  bangs  resounded 
    throughout the apartment,  causing me to fear that we were in the midst 
    of  another  earthquake.  I  looked at the clock,  and was  shocked  to 
    discover  that it was already after 6 am.  Whatever that first  thought 
    was, it was completely lost in the immediate confusion. I  became aware 
    that  my  bladder was painfully full,  and gently got up so as  to  not 
    awaken Jim,  who was still sleeping soundly beside me.  When I returned 
    to bed, Jim asked me what I was doing up already. Apparently, as silent 
    as I had been,  my movement had awoken him,  even though the three loud 
    bangs had not.  Further,  I  questioned why my earlier restlessness had 
    not disturbed his sleep, but this had. I haven't had to get up to empty 
    my bladder in the middle of the night since childhood,  and I began  to 
    wonder  why  it was so extremely full,  especially considering  that  I 
    hadn't had anything to drink the night before.  I  was sure that I  had 
    never actually fallen asleep,  but yet I seemed to "wake up",  with the 
    sun already shining.  I put on my night-mask to block out the daylight, 
    and  returned  to bed.  And then I remembered  something...   With  the 
    clarity  equal  to any image seen through my own eyes,  I   beheld  the 
    likeness of an alien. In my mind's eye, I held that vision and examined 
    it.   As I inspected the roundness of his hairless cranium,  I   became 
    amazed  at how real and three-dimensional the image looked,  much  more 
    than any photograph could ever approach.  I  observed the color of  his 
    skin,   and was quite surprized to learn that my  previous  conceptions 
    were all wrong. My earlier ideas of what an alien should look like were 
    based upon the dust jacket of Whitley Strieber's book,  Communion,  and 
    on  the TV movie about The Interrupted Journey.  His skin was a  creamy 
    grey,  much less grey than I had previously imagined. There was a tinge 
    of green, but as subtle as the green in a black person's complexion.  I 
    thought to myself that an unsophisticated eye might not even pick up on 
    the  green.  Overall,  I  would describe his complexion as simply pale. 
    Only if I wished to emphasize its unusual nature,  would I use the word 
    "grey."   Then I focussed upon his eyes.  In the past,  we had two  pet 
    cockatoos, a Moluccan and a Sulpher-crested,  both of which had eyes as 
    black  as  coal.  It is said that the birds can be sexed  by  examining 
    their  eyes  for the subtle hint of brown,  and I thought of  the  many 
    times I had stared intently into the birds' eyes. It was like a feeling 
    of deja' vu, for I was sure that within the alien's eyes, I  could pick 
    up some extremely subtle gradations of color.  Furthermore, these ever-
    so-sublte  variations  in  the color seemed to indicate  not  just  one 
    circular  iris within each eye,  but perhaps two or more,   although  I 
    somehow "knew"  that their eyes were more than just visual organs,  and 
    the  non-primary  circular  markings  were not really  a  visual  iris. 
    (...that   they  had  only  one  real  visual  iris  within  each  eye) 
    Additionally, it struck me at how the eyes were far less almond- shaped 
    and less wrap-around than I had thought before.  It made me think  that 
    the  illustration  of an alien on Communion was analogous to the  Kroft 
    puppeteer's  version of Ronald Reagan:  a  highly stylized  caricature. 
    Then  the  image came to life!  The thought was somehow conveyed to  me 
    that  he  was acknowledging the presence of orthodontic  braces  on  my 
    teeth.  In a manner analogous to "I've seen yours, so now I'll show you 
    mine,"   he proceeded to open up his little round mouth and let me look 
    in.   When  his nearly lip-less mouth was shut,  it seemed to  call  no 
    attention to itself,  but when opened, I noticed that he, like us,  had 
    muscles  beneath the skin.  The effect of seeing the tightened  muscles 
    beneath his skin made me think that he was capable of expression, in an 
    otherwise  expressionless  face.   Within  the mouth,   I   observed  a 
    semicircular  ridge  of hardened tissue,  which he called his  "primary 
    mastication NOUN." 
    
      It seemed like he was using telepathy to communicate, and my mind was 
    responsible  for  translations into the English language.   The  "NOUN" 
    carried a meaning like "organ", "appendage", or "device," but the exact 
    word to convey the true meaning is not within my vocabulary,  and  it's 
    making me very frustrated as I write this.  I  somehow seemed to "know" 
    that they eat very soft foods,  like being a vegetarian in England. The 
    hardened ridge of tissue was unsegmented,  unlike ordinary human teeth. 
    With  that,  the image faded from my mind.  What has taken me two  long 
    paragraphs to write happened in only a few seconds of time.  The  image 
    was definitely a memory,  and not something that was happening at  that 
    moment.  Whether the memory is of a dream or reality,  I  will probably 
    never know.  After recalling the unusual experience above,  the feeling 
    of  contentedness overwhelmed me.  My bladder now empty and Jim's  warm 
    body next to mine,  I immediately fell soundly asleep. I didn't wake up 
    until after 11  am the following morning,  and was relieved that I  had 
    finally  (post  6 am)  been able to get a normal night's sleep.   Fully 
    cognizant of the aforementioned experience, I  immediately proceeded to 
    the computer and wrote everything down.  While sit ting at the keyboard 
    and unconsciously scratching at my dandruff patch, I  became aware that 
    my dandruff was severely aggravated,  and I had a painful welt next  to 
    it!   For about a year,  more-or-less coinciding with people telling me 
    that I had a sunburn (polycythemia),  I  have had a localized patch  of 
    dandruff  at the base of my skull.  More specifically,  if you run your 
    finger  up  along  the  cervical vertebrae,  you will  reach  a  slight 
    concavity  between  two muscles at the point where the neck  meets  the 
    head, in the occipital region of the cranium. It is in that spot that I 
    have  my  dandruff  patch.  I  use the word "dandruff",   for  lack  of 
    something  better,  because it is most likely some other skin disorder, 
    since  I have an otherwise oily scalp . I have tried  every  name-brand 
    dandruff shampoo, and nothing seems to help, but fortunately, it hasn't 
    spread beyond that highly localized area. On this day, July 18, and for 
    several  days afterward,  the patch seemed to be draining some sort  of 
    fluid from the painful welt which was just above and to the left of  my 
    patch.   As of this writing,  (August 7),  that welt has  not  entirely 
    subsided.  On July 19,  the following day, I  developed another painful 
    welt  on the right side of the dandruff patch,  almost a mirror  image. 
    Coinciding  again  with  the development of my dandruff  patch  and  my 
    polycythemia,   for  about  a year I have  been  plagued  by  excessive 
    perspiration.  For no apparent reason, I would sweat from my armpits in 
    phenomenal amounts. 
    
      Neither  nervousness,   heat,   nor physical  exertion  seemed  to be 
    responsible.   All of my good shirts are permanently stained.  When  my 
    armpits  were on a roll,  the sweat would pour forth at a rate  roughly 
    equal  to that achieved by crying;  perhaps between 4 to 8 ounces in  a 
    half  hour.  This had been an embarrassing situation for me  for  quite 
    some  time,  and when I mentioned it to Carolina during my  visit  with 
    her, she told me that I should drink the juice of a whole lemon in warm 
    water every day.  I  tried that a few times without noticeable success, 
    so I gave up.  I  had also invested a small fortune in a vast array  of 
    brand-name antiperspirants,  but to no avail. Now suddenly, on July 18, 
    the  perspiration stopped,  however I didn't realize as such until July 
    19. Whether this is psychosomatic or real, I will be eternally grateful 
    that my sweating ordeal is finally over!  Thank you!!!  On July 19,   I 
    developed a rather painful pimple, deep below the skin in my pubic hair 
    region.   It struck me as really strange that I should develop  another 
    one in that same general area,  so shortly after my first. Prior to the 
    first, which I placed at a few months earlier, I had never had anything 
    like that. My skin in that area is nothing like the skin on my forehead 
    or upper back,  which tends to be more oily. Furthermore,  this was not 
    an ordinary pimple; it was very deep and painful.  For most of the rest 
    of  the  day,  I  tried to place a time-frame on the occurrence of  the 
    first pimple. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that it had happened 
    sometime in mid to late March,  using my journal and computer  calendar 
    as  a  reference.  I  found this as somewhat  noteworthy,   since  that 
    coincided with my first unusual nocturnal experience.  Sometime  during 
    the next few days,  the Goodyear Blimp flew over. I  was sitting at the 
    computer  when  Jim called me into the front room,  bringing it  to  my 
    attention.   I  would say that the event was slightly unusual,  because 
    I've  never seen the blimp this far removed from a  major  metropolitan 
    area;  we're about 50  miles north of San Francisco.  It was travelling 
    from  the Southeast to the Northwest,  heading directly toward us at  a 
    leisurely pace.  I ran and grabbed the camcorder and recorded it as the 
    blimp  proceeded  to fly directly over us.  We could clearly  hear  the 
    whirring  of  its  engines as it passed our exact zenith.   I   am  not 
    exaggerating  when I say directly over us!  We both wondered  where  it 
    might  be going to,  for at its present course,  it w ould be over  the 
    ocean in a matter of minutes, and the nearest major city north of us is 
    Portland  OR,   nearly  600  miles away.  I'm sure this  event  can  be 
    explained  rationally,   but  I decided to mention it  because  of  its 
    unusual  nature,   and  the proximity in time to my  strange  nocturnal 
    event. 
    
                            -----------------------
    
      During the  course  of writing this document,   I   have  had several 
    flashbacks  to strange memories.  In one memory,  I  seem to  be  quite 
    frustrated  that I can't see as clearly as I'd like,  because  I'm  not 
    wearing  my  eyeglasses.  I  thought this was taking place in an  alien 
    craft.  In another memory,  I  seemed to be getting a lecture about the 
    anatomical differences between the alien's brain and ours.  He was very 
    interested in a small part of my brain,  lying at its center,  which he 
    described as "primitive." I  think it may have had something to do with 
    emotion,  and they didn't have that part of the brain. In contrast,  he 
    showed  me an image of a part of their brain which we do not have;   it 
    was  an extra small lobe in the occipital region,  overlying both right 
    and left hemispheres equally.  I  have the feeling that it was used for 
    communication. I don't know how old these memories are, and I don't kno 
    w  if  they're  memories of dreams or of reality.  I  am  beginning  to 
    seriously doubt my sanity.  As I had written earlier,  my life has been 
    dotted with minor strange anomalies, most of which I have filed away as 
    "unsolved mysteries", and forgotten. 
    
      I have  several early memories,  centering around the age  of  three, 
    which might be suggestive of an early abduction experience. Then around 
    the time I reached puberty, a  lot of strange things started happening. 
    There  have also been a few occurrences during my high school years and 
    continuing  into adulthood.  A  summary of these anomalous  experiences 
    will  be the subject of a future essay.  I  want to stress  my  honesty 
    about  everything  contained  within this narrative.  I   have  neither 
    fabricated or exaggerated a single word of the experience.  I  consider 
    myself to be a happy,  well adjusted individual. I  have a small circle 
    of  close  friends,  and a healthy family life.  I  am normally a  high 
    achiever both at work, and in school. I  try to balance my intellectual 
    lifestyle with a healthy proportion of outdoor physical activities.   I 
    have  never  needed the services of a psychologist,  and  there  is  no 
    history  of mental illness in my family.  It has only been  within  the 
    past  few months that my life seems to be slipping downhill.  I   would 
    like  to  resolve this situation by reaching some conclusion as to  the 
    reality of my experiences,  so I can get on with my life. I  would like 
    to  know if I am going crazy,  perhaps due to some undiscovered br  ain 
    tumor,   or if this could possibly be real.  This essay is a  desperate 
    plea   for   help.   If  there  are  any  qualified  UFO   researchers, 
    psychologists,   or otherwise interested parties who feel like my  case 
    warrants further investigation, and would like to help me come to terms
