³Though I have been mystified by the UFO phenomenon for 30   ³
³years, I'm at least bemused by the attitudes of many who    ³
³haunt its meeting places, special events, lecture halls,    ³
³magazines and...newsletters.                                ³
³                                                            ³
³With the certitude and messianic fervor of the chosen, they ³
³expound their cherished beliefs: "I know there's an         ³
³international conspiracy to keep us from the truth!" says   ³
³one.  "The revelations being channelled from the Arcturians ³
³are really illuminating!" gushes another.  "We have star    ³
³children!" writes a lady who claims communion with          ³
³Venusians.  "...A powerful force from outside mankind       ³
³is...driving us...into the abyss!" exclaims a European      ³
³ufologist who insists the "evidence" is mounting.  At least ³
³"3.7 million" men, women and children have been abducted by ³
³UFOs, concludes a recent Roper Poll - according to some.    ³
³What? UFOs?  Shucks, friend, they're just a lot of "ionized ³
³air," states a plasma vortex theorist, as if summarizing a  ³
³stranger-than-fiction phenomenon that's been making fools of³
³folks for over 45 years.                                    ³
³                                                            ³
³And, meanwhile, in the midst of all the self-indulgence and ³
³egospeak, the ubiquitous Phil Klass, who apparently sees    ³
³himself as a minister to the misguided, and is seen by      ³
³others as the Prime Minister of Misinformation and          ³
³Misinterpretation, declaims, with equal acumen and          ³
³assurance, that UFOs are all a lot of beguiling baloney and ³
³that the very idea our government is hiding information     ³
³about UFOs is...unpatriotic.  Whatever happened to the UFO  ³
³mystery?  Has it finally been solved by the disinformation  ³
³lobby and the same species of simpleton who, a few decades  ³
³ago, would have called it "marsh gas?"                      ³
³                                                            ³
³Has it been levitated out of consensus reality by those who ³
³channel 2,000-year-old entities, party with star people,    ³
³have transcendental visions and access to revealed truths?  ³
³Or has it become the tool and teething ring of "New Age"    ³
³messiahs and missionaries, cultists and confabulators,      ³
³hustlers and hoaxers in pursuit of emotional, psychological,³
³economic, and other misbegotten agendas?                    ³
³                                                            ³
³There is, still, regardless of what anyone tells you, a UFO ³
³mystery.  Maybe they're extraterrestrial.  Maybe not.  There³
³is, still, an abduction mystery.  Maybe the abductors are   ³
³engaging in what Flying Saucer Review calls a "broad plan of³
³generic tinkering."  Maybe not.  Maybe crop circles are the ³
³work of fairies, or a sign of imminent earth changes, or    ³
³clever hoaxes, or unidentified natural phenomena, or a      ³
³combination thereof.  And maybe not.  Why must we have a    ³
³fixed and fatuous notions regarding such phenomena?         ³
³                                                            ³
³Someone once claimed that just saying "I don't know," when  ³
³we most assuredly do not, "know", is the beginning of       ³
³wisdom.                                                     ³
³                                                            ³
³=END=                                                       ³
