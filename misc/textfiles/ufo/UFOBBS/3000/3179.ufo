 Cattle Mutilations.
 
  I, like most of us, have been skeptical of the stories about cattle
  mutilations. But I will relay one story that happened to me personaly.
 
 A few years back I was involved in a remote mining operation in Nevada.
 The location, was just a few miles from the border of the Test Site.
 
 The terrain in that area was as flat as a pool table and you could see
 for at least 50 miles to the east.
 One night a vehicle was approaching the main camp at a high rate of
 speed. Coming down the very twisting dirt road at that speed was very
 foolish, especialy at night. I figured it must be something of
 importance for anyone to drive that foolishly.
 
 As the vehicle got closer, and into the compond lights, I could see it
 was one of the company trucks. Skidding to a stop, the driver jumped
 out and was yelling at me to come down and go with him to see something
 strange.
 It was the company Geologist: He was extreemly excited, and by the
 looks of him, very upset.
 He relayed to me a story about a dead Cow he had found while he was out
 that night popping off rabbits with his new rifle.
 He was a young fellow straight out of College..but he didn't ever give
 me the impression that he was one to be easily spooked.
 
 We told some of the people at the camp where we were going, and took
 another employee who wanted to come along. To say were were well armed
 was a understatement....as most Gold mining operations are, for obvious
 reasons.
 I drove back along the road, following the Geologist's directions for
 about 15 miles and turned north heading up into the foothills of a
 large range of mountains. The dirt road/trail went for another 5 or so
 miles and by the weeds and brush growing over the trail.... and other
 signs, it was apperent that it hadn't been traveled over for quite some
 time.
 Getting to the end of the trail, the dead Cow was now in the headlights
  As we got out, I cautioned them to stay back near the truck, as I
  didn't want a bunch of footprints fouling up the area.
 Looking over the area of the dead Cow I could only see one set of
 footprints, and they matched the geologists boots.
 
 There were no other tire tracks other that that of the truck we were
 driving. and no other signs that there had been anybody up in that area
 for years.
 Looking over the Animal, it's corpse exibited all the clasical signs
 that I had read about in many publications: ...ie:.. It's sexual organs
 were missing.... A neat oval hole cut into its belly about 150mm dia.
 looking as they say, cut out with a laser.
 There was no blood, on the ground or on its skin. It's eyes were still
 intact, but it's upper lip was missing,.. neatly cut away . I would say
 that if the damage was done by predators, they would have not have been
 so selective as to take only the above mentioned parts,and to bore a
 neat hole in it's side.
 I have seen dead animals in the desert before, and the scavaging
 animals rip thier prey apart. and the birds will usualy go for the eyes
 first.
 
 
 There were no insects present,...and again; the most disturbing thing
 is that there was no Blood! There were no signs of a struggle of any
 kind. It looked like the animal had been dropped there as it's left
 horn was buried 6 ins. straight into the ground making a neat hole
 without any disturbed earth around it,  as the animal would have to
 wiggle it's head to bore it's horn that deep into the ground.
 
 We looked around for a few hours and couldn't see anything else. We
 guessed that the Cow had been there for only a short time, or the
 insects would have taken over, and also the rotting smell would have
 been present.
 The next day I drove the 20+ miles over to the Ranch that I supposed
 the Cow belonged to, and informed the forman of what I found. He didn't
 seem too surprised by what I told him as he said it happens
 quite frequently.
 And I had the distinct feeling that he didn't want to talk about it
 much and nerviously changed the subject.
 Quite unusal for people living that remote to not want to "chat it up
 with someone" ,as most others I had encountered would talk for hours
 just to have somebody to talk to.
