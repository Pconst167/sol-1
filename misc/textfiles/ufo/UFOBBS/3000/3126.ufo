³o³SOLUTIONS OFFERED FOR BAT SIGNAL                            ³o³
³o³Times, Gadsden, AL Feb 23, 1993                             ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³  An Etowah County woman thinks she has solved one of       ³o³
³o³North east Alabama 's UFO riddles.                          ³o³
³o³  Last week, Susan Eads video taped a bright light over     ³o³
³o³her Fort Payne home. When she used the camera's zoom        ³o³
³o³lens on the light, the result was an image with some        ³o³
³o³similarities to the light used to signal Batman, the        ³o³
³o³fictional super hero of comic book, television and movie    ³o³
³o³fame. Law enforcement officials who viewed the light        ³o³
³o³agreed it was unusual.                                      ³o³
³o³  Sunday, a Hokes Bluff woman videotaped a similar light    ³o³
³o³near her home on U.S. 278.                                  ³o³
³o³  Also on Sunday night, Mary Buffington saw what she and    ³o³
³o³her husband determined was a bright star in the sky         ³o³
³o³over their Duck Springs Road home. She had taken her        ³o³
³o³video camera outside after Sunday's severe                  ³o³
³o³thunderstorms in hopes of documenting some of the hail      ³o³
³o³that had fallen.                                            ³o³
³o³  She decided to tape the bright star.  She was             ³o³
³o³surprised when she zoomed her video camera on the           ³o³
³o³light.                                                      ³o³
³o³  "It looked exactly like the image that was in the         ³o³
³o³newspaper," Mrs. Buffington said.  "I was panicking. I      ³o³
³o³thought I've seen the space ship, or whatever it was."      ³o³
³o³A photo from Ms. Eads' videotape ran in Saturday's          ³o³
³o³Gadsen Times.                                               ³o³
³o³  Then, by accident, Mrs. Buffington moved the camera       ³o³
³o³and caught a neighbor's security light in the lens.         ³o³
³o³She focused.  The Batman signal appeared.  She tried        ³o³
³o³another security light.  Again, the Batman signal           ³o³
³o³appeared.                                                   ³o³
³o³  Mrs. Buffington thinks it's just the effect of            ³o³
³o³zooming a video camera in on a bright light in the          ³o³
³o³night sky that somehow creates the strange image.           ³o³
³o³  While Mrs. Buffington described the light she taped       ³o³
³o³as a bright star, Ms. Eads and Marie Edwards don't          ³o³
³o³think they saw a star.                                      ³o³
³o³  Ms. Eads said the light was much brighter than any of     ³o³
³o³the stars in the sky over Fort Payne last Thursday          ³o³
³o³night.  Ms. Edwards said no stars were visible Sunday       ³o³
³o³when she saw the light in the area near Calhoun County.     ³o³
³o³  Until the Sunday sightings, all reports of strange        ³o³
³o³lights in the night skies had come from DeKalb County.      ³o³
³o³Reports began in late January and have continued this       ³o³
³o³month.                                                      ³o³
³o³  Ms. Edwards also went outside Sunday night to check on    ³o³
³o³the result of a hailstorm. She saw the light about 8:30     ³o³
³o³p,m. She said it stayed in the same place for about an      ³o³
³o³hour before it appeared to move behind some trees. Ms.      ³o³
³o³Eads also had reported that the light she taped stayed      ³o³
³o³in one Piace for a long time.                               ³o³
³o³  According to a report in today's Birmingham Post-         ³o³
³o³Herald, some people may be mistaking the planet Venus       ³o³
³o³for a UFO. Thomas Wdowiak, a physics professor and          ³o³
³o³astronomer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham,      ³o³
³o³said the planet is very bright right now and atmospheric    ³o³
³o³conditions could make it resemble a spacecraft. He said     ³o³
³o³Venus will be right next to the moon on Wednesday           ³o³
³o³night.                                                      ³o³
³o³  Those making earlier reports of strange lights in         ³o³
³o³DeKalb don't buy Wdowiak's explanations, the Post           ³o³
³o³Herald reported. Sue Johnson of Dog Town said what she      ³o³
³o³saw out side her home on Jan. 28 after hearing a            ³o³
³o³humming noise was a long, ova]-shaped aircraft hover        ³o³
³o³ing below the treetops.                                     ³o³
³o³  Geraldine police dispatcher Susan Austin said what        ³o³
³o³she saw and videotaped wasn't a star because it was         ³o³
³o³moving. A photo taken from her tape appeared in the         ³o³
³o³Gadsden Times. The image was compared by some to the        ³o³
³o³light pattern of a Stealth bomber. The Air Force            ³o³
³o³discounted the possibility that it was a Stealth.           ³o³
