         Subject:  Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash
         Text:
         
         On 25 Aug 74, at 2207 hrs, US Air Defense radar detected an unknown
         approaching US airspace from the Gulf of Mexico. Originally the
         object was tracked at 2,200 (2530 mph) knots on a bearing of 325
         degrees and at an altitude of 75,000 feet, a course that would
         intercept US territory about forty miles southwest of Corpus
         Cristi, Texas. After approximately sixty seconds of observation,
         at a position 155 miles southeast of Corpus Cristi, the object
         simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 (1955 mph) knots,
         turned to a heading of 290 degrees, and began a slow descent. It
         entered Mexican airspace approximately forty miles south of
         Brownsville, Texas. Radar tracked it approximately 500 miles to a
         point near the town of Coyame, in the state of Chihuahua, not far
         from the US border. There the object suddenly disappeared from the
         radar screens.
         
         During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at
         45,000 feet, then descended to 20,000 feet. The descent was in
         level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level
         was maintained for approximately five minutes.
         
         The object was tracked by two different military radar
         installations. It would have been within range of Brownsville
         civilian radar, but it is assumed that no civilian radar detected
         the object due to a lack of any such reports.
         
         The point of disappearance from the radar screens was over a barren
         and sparsely populated area of Northern Mexico. At first it was
         assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon and
         a watch was kept for any re-emergence of the object. None
         occurred.
         
         At first it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because
         of the high speed and descending flight path. But meteors normally
         travel at higher speeds, and descend in a smooth arc, not in
         "steps." And meteors do not normally make a thirty-five degree
         change in course. Shortly after detection an air defense alert was
         called. However, before any form of interception could be
         scrambled, the object turned to a course that would not immediately
         take it over US territory. The alert was called off within twenty
         minutes after the object's disappearance from the radar screen.
         
         Fifty-two minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic
         indicated that a civilian aircraft had gone down in that area. But
         it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso
         International with a destination of Mexico City, and could not,
         therefore, have been the object tracked over the Gulf of Mexico.
         
         It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area
         and at the same time.
         
         With daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for
         the missing plane. Approximately 1035 hrs there came a radio
         report that wreckage from the missing plane had been spotted from
         the air. Almost immediately came a report of a second plane on the
         ground a few miles from the first. A few minutes later an
         additional report stated that the second "plane" was circular
         shaped and apparently in one piece although damaged. A few minutes
         after that the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all
         search efforts.
         
         The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA.
         Possibly as many as two additional government agencies also
         received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date.
         The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with
         which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that this
         was either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed
         prior to this event.
         
         In the meantime requests were initiated at the highest levels
         between the United States and Mexican governments that the US
         recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to "assist." These
         requests were met with professed ignorance and a flat refusal of
         any cooperation.
         
         By 2100 hrs, 26 Aug 74, the recovery team had assembled and been
         staged at Fort Bliss. Several helicopters were flown in from some
         unknown source and assembled in a secured area. These helicopters
         were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Eye
         witness indicates that there were three smaller craft, very
         probably UHl Hueys from the description. There was also a larger
         helicopter, possibly a Sea Stallion. Personnel from this team
         remained with their craft and had no contact with other Ft. Bliss
         personnel.
         
         Satellite and recognizance aircraft overflight that day indicated
         that both the crashed disk and the civilian aircraft had been
         removed from the crash sites and loaded on flat bed trucks. Later
         flights confirmed that the convoy had departed the area heading
         south.
         
         At that point the CIA had to make a choice, either to allow this
         unknown aircraft to stay in the hands of the Mexican government, or
         to launch the recovery team, supplemented by any required military
         support, to take the craft. There occurred, however, an event that
         took the choice out of their hands. High altitude overflights
         indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited
         areas or major roads. Recon showed no activity, and radio contact
         between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters had ceased.
         A low altitude, high speed overflight was ordered.
         
         The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps
         stopped, some with open doors, and two human bodies laying on the
         ground beside two vehicles. The decision was immediately made to
         launch the recovery team but the actual launching was held up for
         the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel.
         It was not until 1438 hrs that the helicopters departed Ft. Bliss.
         
         The four helicopters followed the boarder down towards Presido then
         turned and entered Mexican airspace north of Candelaria. They were
         over the convoy site at 1653 hrs. All convoy personnel were dead,
         most within the trucks. Some recovery team members, dressed
         bioprotection suits, reconfigured the straps holding the object on
         the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the Sea
         Stallion. By 1714 hrs the recovered object was on its way to US
         territory. Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery
         team gathered together the Mexican vehicles and bodies, then
         destroyed all with high explosives. This included the pieces of
         the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air
         collision. At 1746 hrs the Hueys departed.
         
         The Hueys caught up with the Sea Stallion as it reentered US
         airspace. The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the
         Davis Mountains, approximately twenty-five miles north east of
         Valentine. There they landed and waited until 0225 hrs the next
         morning. At that time they resumed the flight and rendezvoused
         with a small convoy on a road between Van Horn and Kent. The
         recovered disk was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it
         and capable of being sealed totally. Some of the personnel from
         the Huey's transferred to the convoy.
         
         All helicopters then returned to their original bases for
         decontamination procedures. The convoy continued non-stop, using
         back roads and smaller highways, and staying away from cities. The
         destination of the convoy reportedly was Altanta, Georgia.
         
         Here the hard evidence thins out. One unconfirmed report says the
         disk was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson AF Base.
         Another says that the disk was either transferred after that to
         another unnamed base, or was taken directly to this unknown base
         directly from Atlanta.
         
         The best description of the disk was that it was sixteen feet, five
         inches in diameter, convex on both upper and lower surfaces to the
         same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows. The thickness
         was slightly less than five feet. The color was silver, much like
         polished steel. There were no visible lights nor any propulsion
         means. There were no markings. There were two areas of the rim
         that showed damage, one showing an irregular hole approximately
         twelve inches in diameter with indented material around it. The
         other damage was described as a "dent" about two feet wide. The
         weight of the object was estimated as approximately one thousand,
         five hundred pounds, based on the effect of the weight on the
         carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck.
         
         There was no indication in the documentation available as to
         whether anything was visible in the "hole."
         
         It seems likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the
         collision with the civilian aircraft. That collision occurred
         while the object was traveling approximately 1700 knots (1955 mph).
         Even ignoring the speed of the civilian aircraft, the impact would
         have been considerable at that speed. This is in agreement with
         the description of the civilian aircraft as being "almost totally
         destroyed." What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of
         the civilian aircraft.
         
         The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with
         the ground. The speed in that case should have been considerably
         less than that of the first impact.
         
         No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian aircraft. It
         is not known if any body or bodies were recovered. Considering the
         destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may
         well not have come down near the larger pieces.
         
         Unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team
         is not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the
         disk as a result of the damage, to a microbiological agent. There
         are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team.
         It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have
         taken one of the bodies back with them for anaylsis. But there is
         no indication of that having happen. Perhaps they did not have
         adquate means of transporting what might have been a biologically
         contaminated body.
         
         Inquires to the FAA reveal no documents conserning the civilian
         aircraft crash, probably because it did not involve a US aircraft
         nor did

         Subject: Research Findings on the Pinehurst "Abduction"
         Text:
         
         Given the small amount of data to go on and the number of years
         that have passed since the original incident, very little
         importance should be placed on this report. The group first
         learned of it through a verbal transmission from an Air Force
         Officer. He stated that he had learned of it from a report filed
         with the Intelligence Officer at Fairchild AFB a few days after the
         event. He admitted that he did not meet those filing the report,
         nor was he actually involved with any type of investigation.
         Apparently the original report as filed by a civilian was
         "humorous" enough to get passed around among some of the officers.
         
         His statement (summarized):
         
         On 24 June 71 a man and his wife came into the base headquarters at
         Fairchild and stated that they wished to make a report of a "flying
         saucer." They were turned over to the base Intelligence Officer as
         would be proper under AF guidelines for UFO reports at that time.
         He allowed them to write down their story but apparently placed
         very little importance in their statements for report indicated
         that he asked no questions and apparently told the civilians that
         their report would be "passed up the channels." It is not known if
         that was ever done, or if that officer, disbelieving the report
         because of the possible abduction aspect, merely filed it without
         following standard UFO reporting procedure. It is possible that he
         did not even file the report, but merely passed it around the its
         "amusement" value then trash canned it.
         
         The facts remembered from the report were as follows:
         
         On 21 June 71, Mr John Stacy (23) and his wife, Gloria (23), were
         in their home near Pinehurst, Idaho. Their home was a distance
         from the town and somewhat isolated. It was after dinner and both
         were sitting down, Mrs Stacy watching TV, John reading a book. At
         approximately 2215 hrs John's attention was caught by a light
         outside the window, a reddish light of rather deep color. He went
         to the window and saw a column of light described as "deep red"
         descending to the ground from above. The place where the light
         struck the ground was only about a hundred feet from the house and
         he could not see from his position what was causing the light.
         
         After showing the light to his wife, he went out the back door,
         accompanied by her, to investigate. He took with him a 22 caliber
         pistol, the only weapon in the house. He stated that the light was
         like nothing he had ever seen and "a little scary." Once clear of
         the roof, they could see that the light was coming from the center
        of a circular shape hovering approximately two hundred feet in the
         air. The shape was dark, no lights apparent other than the red
         beam shining directly down from the center. He estimated the
         diameter of the "disk" to be fifty feet.
         
         For a few minutes they both just stood there, staring in wonder at
         the thing. Then John realized that it was no longer there. He was
         still standing outside, looking at the sky, but there was no object
         and no light. He stated that he didn't remember seeing it go, just
         that he was suddenly aware it wasn't there any longer. And that he
         was suddenly chilled.
         
         He turned to his wife but she wasn't there. He also noticed that
         his revolver was no longer in his hand. Puzzled, he went back into
         the house, searching for Gloria. She was not present. He then
         took a flashlight and searched the area around the house but failed
         to find her. Returning to the house, he was about to call law
         authorities when he noticed a red flash out of the corner of his
         eye. The light had been outside a window. He was going to the
         door again when he met Gloria slowly walking back into the house.
         
         He began questioning her about where she had been but she was in a
         daze and unable to answer coherently except to say that she felt
         she had been "somewhere. n As she recovered she seemed very much
         afraid of the outside of the house but could put no words to her
         fears. He got her to bed and calmed down. The next day she could
         not remember where she had been and seemed anxious whenever he
         asked questions.
         
         In the report, John Stacy stated that he had noticed there were red
         marks encircling his wife's wrists and ankles but she could not
         explain how they had gotten there. It appeared that the skin was
         somewhat raw as if rubbed or chaffed.
         
         On the second day after the sighting, Mrs Stacy told her husband
         that she was sure she had been inside the "flying saucer" but still
         could not remember anything else. That is when he decided to go to
         the nearest AFB and report the incident and inquire as to what it
         might have been. It appears unlikely that his questions were
         answered by the AF officer who took their statements.
         
         This is the end of the original verbal account, given to a member
         of the group in early 1983. It was recorded and filed for possible
         investigation but with a low priority due to the amount of time
         that had passed.
         
         In 1985 one of the group happened to be not far from Pinehurst and
         decided to investigate. The trail was pretty cold by then. Casual
         interrogation of long-time residents did, however, reveal two men
         who remembered the couple and the incident. Apparently it had been
         written up in a local paper. Attempts to locate that paper proved
         negative as it had apparently gone out of business years before.
         
         Additional information gathered from the locals include: Gloria
         Stacy died in 1980 from causes unrelated to the incident. John
         Stacy moved to California right after that.
         
         The original newspaper article described only the dark "saucer" and
         a red beam, but not the possible abduction. Apparently the Stacy's
         had decided to not reveal that part. But those who knew them said
         that years later John told them several additional facts. Unable
         to sleep after the incident, John lay in bed awake for quite a
         while. It was then that he realized that it was far later than it
         should have been. He knew the time he saw the red light because of
         the TV show that was on. But when Gloria returned and they went to
         bed, it was over four hours later. Even allowing for two hours as
         he searched the area around the house and to calm his wife down
         after she returned, that still leaves approximately two hours
         unaccounted for.
         
         Also Mrs Stacy had "bad dreams" for quite a while afterwards but
         never did remember anything additional about the time she was
         missing. For a couple years after the incident she would not leave
         the house at night.
         
         There had been no additional incidents with unknowns or anything
         that could be related to the original incident, at least none that
         were related to the two locals interviewed.
         
         Without the ability to interview the primary witnesses, there is
         little that can be made of this report. As it stands, this
         incident contains some of the standard elements of abduction cases,
         yet differs in some ways. The beam of red light has been reported
         only a few times, mostly not in conjunction with abductions. The
         missing time element is a key factor, of course. But the marks on
         her wrists and ankles suggest some form of physical restraint, not
         a common element. A similar occurrence has been related in only
         one other abduction, that in which the woman claimed to have been
         bound to a chair and left alone for a period of time by the
         "aliens." There is no evidence of any other marks on her body, nor
         of any post-abduction symptoms other than bad dreams and a
         nervousness about going outside at night. It is possible,
         considering the second-hand evidence, that such symptoms may have
         simply gone unreported.
         
         This couple apparently felt it their duty to report this sighting
         to the AF, or perhaps because they felt that the AF might help
         explain to them what had happened. They certainly did not seek
         publicity afterwards, in fact apparently avoided it. This argues
         strongly in favor of a real incident of some type having occurred.
         
         Some limited attempts have been made to local John Stacy in the Los
         Angeles area but have proved negative.
         
         This case is not considered worthwhile for further investigation.
