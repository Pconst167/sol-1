NEW 'PULSER' SIGHTINGS
 
"Donuts-on-a-rope" contrails produced by an unknown high-speed,
high-altitude aircraft have been reported throughout the U.S.
and Europe, suggesting the classified "pulser" is no longer
confined to a test range (AW&ST May 11, p.62).In late January,
a similar contrail--described as a "coiled spring"--was seen
over Scotland behind a very fast aircraft flying east to west.
The distinctive contrails have been spotted during daylight hours
over Portland, Ore.; Washington Dulles International Airport, Va.;
Denver, Colo.; and Edwards AFB, Calif.Observers said the main
plume appeared to be connected directly to the aircraft, which
was so high its shape could not be determined.Typical jet
contrails become visible at some distance behind an aircraft as
moisture in the exhaust condenses.  The pulser's rings or "donuts"
appeared to grow out of and encircle the plume a few seconds later.
Propulsion experts have suggested the "pulser" may be powered by
a ducted rocket, or a hybrid of a pulse detonation engine.
 
 
COMBINED CYCLE POWERPLANT
 
"DOUGHNUTS ON A ROPE" contrails produced by unknown high-speed,
high-altitude aircraft may be the result of a Pratt & Whitney
powerplant program aimed at developing what the company calls
an "impulse motor".  The engine is believed to be a combined
cycle powerplant that integrates conventional gas turbine and
rocket technologies.  Such a powerplant would be capable of
operating from a ground takeoff up to speeds approaching Mach 6.
   [ and of course that is the magic "Aurora" number! :-> ]
 
The unusual contrail could be the result of running the powerplant
off its narrow design point, according to U.S. propulsion experts.
Officials have suggested that in the past, impulse engines have
been located at Edwards AFB, Calif., and at government facilities
at White Sands, N.M.
