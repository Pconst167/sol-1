Topic: CSETI   
 
OK, I'll stick up for these guys.  I am not sure why everyone is
trashing CSETI.  Has anyone seriously looked into them?  I have, and
have personally talked with several members, as well as Steven Greer.
 
CSETI is an all volunteer organization consisting of several local
groups, and a central group called the Rapid Mobilization Investigative
Team.  The latter is where the action is.  RMIT members travel to UFO
wave areas (on their own money), where they put into practice their
protocals for interacting with the aliens.  These protocals involve the
use of high powered lights, playback of sounds recorded in crop
circles, and directed, sequenced thought.
 
Most of the "new age" criticism concerns this last item.  Is it so hard
to imagine that the aliens can pick up on human thoughts?  Abduction
reports consistently describe most alien communication as telepathic.
I personally have talked to several UFO witnesses who have described
UFO sightings in which the craft seemed to respond to their thoughts -
(Gee look at that, I wish it would come closer, hey - here it comes!)
I am not saying that these types of reports prove anything, but it
seems premature and closed minded to absolutely rule out this
possibility.
 
Now, let's talk about CSETI's results.  What happenned in Gulf Breeze
is minor compared to what the group was able to achieve last summer in
England, and more recently in Mexico.  If you saw the Sightings
episode, you heard the story of the near landing of a structured craft
near the crop circle area.  In Mexico, the results were even more
spectacular.  I talked on the phone with Greer when he had just
returned from this trip.  The man sounded absolutely excited.  An
estimated 800 foot diameter craft had responded to the groups signals,
approached, and again virtually landed in clear view of them.  Greer
also related, rather exasperatedly, that all their video recording
equipment had failed to function during this event, while other
electronic equipment such as hand help audio recorders continued to
work.
 
Before everyone jumps up and says, AHA, how convenient, once again a
lack of hard proof, let's look at some possible reasons for this.  Is
Greer, and a host of other people, lying to us to create some grand
hoax.  I find this difficult to believe.  Consider CSETI's own theory
that the aliens just do not want us to get such footage, and have the
power to selectively disable our equipment at a distance.  The ball is
in their court, not ours.
 
So rather than disparage these guys, I admire them.  They are out there
on the front lines, collecting data on UFO's first hand.  It takes a
bit of courage to venture out for face to face contact with these
aliens, especially in view of all the horror story abduction reports.
I talked to one woman who said that a carload of CSETI researchers had
experienced a period of missing time on the ride back from a night of
field work.
 
As for the big $$$'s, CSETI's dues are $40 per year.
 
If your really interested,  call CSETI and talk to them first
hand (704-274-5671). Or order the tape of Greer's lecture at last
November's UFO Symposium in Las Vegas from Video City Productions for a
whopping $10. (510-428-0202).
