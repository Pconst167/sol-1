The Believers Gather

Mr. Ford's stories, told with the drama of midnight campfire tales, would give
the staunchest cynic the crawling heebie-jeebies.  But Mr. Ford is not an
entertainer.  He considers himself one of the many students of the blossoming
science of ufology.

Apparently, he's not alone.  Many of the attendees recounted tales of their own
sightings and confirmed that they believe in life on other planets.

One man who wanted to know why there were so few photographs of UFOs said, "I
have no problem with UFOs - I firmly believe they exist."

Asked outside the meeting if she was a believer, a woman said, "Oh, yes,
definitely.  I saw one in the 1950s with my family in Brooklyn when I was a
child."

Although Mr. Ford has studied accounts of UFO sightings avidly for 20 years, it
wasn't until three years ago that he and several co-alien watchers formed the
society.  Since then hundreds

A Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist, whose identity is being protected,
told Mr. Ford that we have been in an "adversarial condition" with an
extraterrestrial civilization for the past five years.  The latest
confrontation of the condition was Sept. 28, 1989, when a boomerang-shaped
alien ship was shot down in the bay.  One family witnessed a blue-white light
pulsating in the dunes, which LIUFON believes was a plasma field being
generated by the charging of an electronic weapon using superconductors and
carried by the Stealth Bomber.  Helicopters engaged the object to bring it into
the narrow range of the weapon, and a "fake air-sea rescue operation" was
staged by the Coast Guard to cover up the activity.  The weapon, which was used
because conventional weapons cannot penetrate the intense plasma field with
which aliens surround themselves, "scrambled the propulsion drive" of the
object causing it to crash in the shallow water of Moriches Bay and kill 18
aliens.  William Floyd parkway was then closed down so a military convoy of
flatbed truck could take the wreckage and bodies to BNL, where it is still
undergoing testing.

Mona Rowe, a spokesperson for BNL, read Mr. Ford's report Tuesday and said she
spoke to the man in charge of the Star Wars machine about it.

"We didn't shoot down a UFO on the night of Sept. 28," she said adding that the
Star Wars expert said BNL does not have the equipment to connect a
superconductor to a high intensity laser as was described by Mr. Ford.  But she
said she did see the lights in the sky on Sept. 28, while coming home from an
amateur orchestra rehearsal in Shoreham.

"I think it's amazing that I had actually seen this myself," she said.  "To me
they looked like flares, but maybe my perception is colored by the fact that I
work in a very scientifically-minded environment.  Basically, people believe
what they would like to believe."
