                    EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL EXPOSURE LAW
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Already Passed by Congress
 
 On October 5, 1982, Dr. Brain T. Clifford of the Pentagon
announced at a press conference ("The Star",  New York, Oct. 5,
1982) that contact between U.S. citizens and extra-terrestrials or
their vehicles is strictly illegal.
 
According to a law already on the books
 
(Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, adopted on
July 16, 1969, before the Apollo moon shots), anyone guilty of such
contact automatically becomes a wanted criminal to be jailed for one
year and fined $5,000.  The NASA administrator is empowered to
determine  with or without a hearing that a person or object has been
"extraterrestrially exposed" and impose an indeterminate quarantine
under armed guard, which could not be broken even by court order.
 
 There is no limit placed on the number of individuals who could
thus be arbitrarily quarantined.
 
 The definition of "extraterrestrial exposure" is left entirely
up to NASA administrator, who is thus endowed with total dictatorial
power to be exercised at his slightest caprice, which is completely
contrary to the Constitution.
 
 According to Dr. Clifford, whose commanding officers have been
assuring the public for the last 39 years that UFO's are nothing more
than hoaxes and delusions to be dismissed with a condescending smile:
"This is really no joke, it's a very serious matter."  This
legislation was buried in the 1,211th subsection of the 14th section
of a batch of regulations very few members of government probably
bothered to read in its entirety, the proverbial needle in the
haystack, and was slipped onto the books without public debate.
 
 Thus from one day to the next we learn that, without having
informed the public, in its infinite wisdom, the government of the
United States has created a whole new criminal class: UFO contactees.
 
 The lame excuse offered by NASA as a sugar coating for this bitter
pill is that extra-terrestrials might have a virus that could wipe out
the human race.  This is certainly one of the many possibilities
inherent is such contact, but just as certainly not the only one , and
in itself not a valid reason to make all contact illegal or to declare
contactees criminals to be jailed and fined immediately.
 
 It appears the primary effect of such a law would not be to prevent
contact, it would be to silence witnesses.  If enforced, the law would
prevent publication of contactee reports except under cover of
anonymity, and unleash a modern inquisition in the Land of the Free.
However, it is unenforceable,  so obviously absurd and unfair that the
public will refuse to accept it.  The citizens of the United States
will greet it with a resounding Bronx cheer and laugh it out of court,
forcing it to be repealed.
 
 It should be replaced by clearly worded legislation, not open to
interpretation in a multitude of different ways, humanely relevant to
the contingency of E.T. contact, debated and passed by Congress openly
instead of slipped through "under the table" without the public being
informed.
 
 According to NASA spokesman Fletcher Reel, the law as it stands is
not immediately applicable, but in case of need could quickly be made
applicable.  What this means is that it is ambiguously worded, so that
it can be interpreted either one way or the other, as the government
desires.
 
 It is certainly not a coincidence that Dr. Clifford held his press
conference during the period when the popularity of the film E.T. was
at its peak.  As E.T. portrayed a type of extraterrestrial that was
benevolent and lovable, the inference is that the press conference was
intended to discourage attempts to communicate or fraternize with UFO
occupants.  However, instead of having the intended effect, it
backfired, causing public furor.  There may be some relationship
between this fiasco and the next semi-officially endorsed attempt to
deal with the subject of extra-terrestrials, the TV film V, which was
featured with repeat performances and maximum publicity by major
networks worldwide.  The aliens portrayed in V are the most horrifying
and repulsive nightmares imaginable, who are defeated thanks largely
to a CIA hit man specializing in covert operations, the tough guy with
the heart of gold who with the aid of the handsome hero saves the
human race.  This is obvious and transparent propaganda, designed to
do what the government's widespread use of dis-information, and Dr.
Clifford's press conference about the absurd lemon of a law already on
the books failed to do:  squelch attempts to communicate or fraternize
with UFO occupants.
 
 One way to avoid widespread panic at the announcement of the news
that we are under surveillance by nonhuman intelligent beings with a
technology far more sophisticated than our own is to point out that
this situation is nothing new, but has literally been going on for
millennia.
 
 If the "flying dragons" mentioned in the I Ching intended to attack
and destroy us, they could easily have carried out this objective long
ago.  Along with this article, the text of the E.T. Law will be
presented.  However, there are several points that I wish to make:
 
 1211.101 Applicability.  The provisions of this part apply to all
NASA manned and unmanned space missions...
 
 I could dismiss this whole controversy as a tempest in a teacup if
the above passage contained the word "only", so as to read: "The
provisions of this part apply only to all NASA manned and unmanned
space missions..." However, it does not contain that one little word
which would have made such a big difference.  If the government was
suddenly faced with the accomplished fact of an undeniable overt E.T.
visitation, this regulation could therefore, be construed as being
applicable to all space missions, NASA or non NASA, whether of
terrestrial or extra-terrestrial origin.  As it stands, this law is
applicable to UFO contact.  The meaning would have to be stretched,
but the built-in loophole does exist.
 
 1211.102 Definitions. (b) (2):  Touched directly or been in close
proximity to  (or been exposed indirectly to )...Even without involved
in a UFO close encounter would become eligible for indefinite
quarantine under armed guard according to the above.  By including
indirect exposure, the NASA administrator is empowered to make the
definition mean just about anything he wants it to.  An example of
indirect exposure is given, but an example is not a definition.
Unless indirect exposure is defined precisely, it can mean almost
anything.  The possibility is not specifically ruled out that other
types of indirect exposure than the example given might be considered
valid grounds to "quarantine" a citizen or group of citizens.
 
 In my opinion, it is vital that we challenge the validity of his law,
for if it is allowed to stand unchallenged, UFO contactees and
researchers may all meet behind barbed wire and armed guards somewhere
in Alaska.  I strongly urge everyone who reads the E.T. Law, Title 14,
Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations (at the end of this
article), to clip it out, and send it on to your congressman, with a
demand penciled in, to repeal this absurd and potentially lethal law.
We must use reason, and transcend fear in order to make this planet a
place where all may live in peace and harmony, as One.
 
       Text of the E.T. Law
 
 1211.100 Title 14 - Aeronautics and Space
 
 Part 1211 - Extra-terrestrial Exposure
 
 1211.100 - Scope
 
This part establishes: (a) NASA policy, responsibility and authority
to guard the Earth against any harmful contamination or adverse
changes in its environment resulting from personnel, spacecraft and
other property returning to the Earth after landing on or coming
within the atmospheric envelope of a celestial body; and (b) security
requirements, restrictions and safeguards that are necessary in the
interest of national security.
 
 1211.101 - Applicability
 
The provisions of this part to all NASA manned and unmanned space
missions which land or come within the atmospheric envelope of a
celestial body and return to the Earth.
 
 1211.102 - Definitions
 
(a) "NASA" and the "Administrator" mean, respectively the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration or his authorized
representative.
 
(b) "Extra-terrestrially exposed" means the state of condition of any
person, property, animal or other form of life or matter whatever, who
or which has:
 
 (1) Touched directly or come within the atmospheric envelope or any
other celestial body; or
 
 (2) Touched directly or been in close proximity to (or been exposed
indirectly to ) any person, property, animal or other form of life or
matter who or which has been extra-terrestrially exposed by virtue of
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
 
      For example, if person or thing "A" touches the surface of the
Moon, and on "A's"  return to Earth, "B" touches "A" and,
subsequently, "C" touches "B", all of these - "A"  through "C"
inclusive - would be extra-terrestrially exposed ("A" and "B"
directly; "C" indirectly).
 
(c) "Quarantine" means the detention, examination and decontamination
of any persons, property, animal or other form of life or matter
whatever that is extra-terrestrially exposed, and includes the
apprehension or seizure of such person, property, animal or other form
of life or matter whatever.
 
(d) "Quarantine period" means a period of consecutive calendar days as
may be established in accordance with 1211.104 (a).
 
 1211.104 - Policy
 
(a) Administrative actions.  The Administrator or his designee..shall
in his discretion:
 
      (1) Determine the beginning and duration of a quarantine period
with respect to any space mission; the quarantine period as it applies
to various life forms will be announced.
 
      (2) Designate in writing quarantine officers to exercise
quarantine authority.
 
      (3) Determine that a particular person, property, animal, or
other form of life or matter whatever is extra-terrestrially exposed
and quarantine such person, property, animal, or other form of life or
matter whatever. The quarantine may be based only on a determination,
with or without the benefit of a hearing, that there is probable cause
to believe that such person, property, animal or other form of life or
matter whatever is extra-terrestrially exposed.
 
(4) Determine within the United States or within vessels or vehicles
of the United States the place, boundaries, and rules of operation of
necessary quarantine stations.
 
(5) Provide for guard services by contract or otherwise, as many be
necessary, to maintain security and inviolability of quarantine
stations and quarantined persons, property, animals or other form of
life or matter whatever.
 
(6) Provide for the subsistence, health and welfare of persons
quarantined under the provisions of this part.
 
(7) Hold such hearings at such times, in such manner and for such
purposes as may be desirable or necessary under this part, including
hearings for the purpose of creating a record for use in making any
determination under this part for the purpose of reviewing any such
determination.
 
(b)(3) During any period of announced quarantine, no person shall
enter or depart from the limits of the quarantine station without
permission of the cognizant NASA officer.  During such period, the
posted perimeter of a quarantine station shall be secured by armed
guard.
 
(b) (4) Any person who enters the limits of any quarantine station
during the quarantine period shall be deemed to have consented to the
quarantine of his person if it is determined that he is or has become
extra-terrestrially exposed.
 
(b)(5) At the earliest practicable time, each person who is
quarantined by NASA shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
communicate by telephone with legal counsel or other persons of
his choice.
 
 1211.107 Court or other process
 
(a) NASA officers and employees are prohibited from discharging from
the limits of a quarantine station any quarantined person, property,
animal or other form of life or matter whatever during order or other
request, order or demand an announced quarantine period in compliance
with a subpoena, show cause or any court or other authority without
the prior approval of the General Counsel and the Administrator.
 
(b) Where approval to discharge a quarantined person, property,
animal or other form of life or matter whatever in compliance with
such a request, order or demand of any court or other authority is not
given, the person to whom it is directed shall, if possible, appear in
court or before the other authority and respectfully state his
inability to comply, relying for his action on this 1211.107.
 
 1211.108 Violations
 
Whoever willfully violates, attempts to violate, or conspires to
violate any provision of this part or any regulation or order issued
under this part or who enters or departs from the limits of a
quarantine station in disregard of the quarantine rules or regulations
or without permission of the NASA quarantine officer shall be fined
not more that $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.
 
 Write or call your congressman and tell him you want this law
taken off the books.
