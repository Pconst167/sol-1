          1993 CROP CIRCLE REPORT BULLETIN #4



                                            June 11, 1993

From Rosemary Ellen Guiley, director

Crop circle activity in England continues at a modest pace, according
to reports from members of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies.
Farmers are increasingly resistant to permitting access to formations.
Some farms that have been sites of significant activity in recent
years are closed to visitors this year.  Irritation continues over
human-made formations.  Near the Silbury Hill cark park, a note was
found pinned to a tree threatening hoaxers.

The most recent activity is given first.  The Center for Crop Circle
Studies, England, has assigned a quality rating scale from 1-9, with 1
being the poorest, especially in terms of "authenticity" (of unknown
origin) and 9 being the highest.  Ratings are given in some reports.
Map reference numbers are for Ordnance Survey maps.

June 1: Beckhampton, Wilts.  Ringed circle with radial design in
wheat.  Estimated diameter of circle 15 ft., and 10 ft. between circle
and ring.  Found muddy, believed to be human-made.

May 26:  Peasemore area, N. of Newbury, Berks.  Circle in rape, 19-m.
laid straight off center, swirled anticlockwise.   Nearby (100 yds.) a
7-m. circle, anticlockwise, believed to have been formed later.
Rating: 6.

May 22: Beckhampton, Wilts.  Tiny circle in unspecified crop.  Rating:
4.

May 20: Tawsmead Copse, Wilts.  Unconfirmed report of circle activity
associated with UFO sighting.  Circle-UFO activity reported here last
summer.

May 17: West Ilsey, near Harwell, Oxon.  Map reference SU 484845.  80-
ft. tight, neat circle in rape, with a 1.5-foot spiral and a ridged,
"ripple wave flow effect."  Rating: 6.  No sign of entry to field or
bruising to flowers.  Difficult area to access.  Inspected by Stanley
Morcom, Lucy Pringle and Una Dawood, CCS.

May 13: West Overton, Wilts.  Map reference SU135698.  60-ft. circle
in rape with sunburst center.  Rating: 6.  Remote location, found by
Busty Taylor, CCS.  Later was inspected and videotaped by two
individuals.  Samples taken.

May 13: Near Ropley, Hants.  Map ref. SU642339.  D-shape growing in
grass.  Possible wind damage.  Rating: 1.

May 12: Glazedgate Crs., Totnes, Devon.  Circle reported in Torquay
Herald. May be reference to 1992 activity.

May 11: St. Neots, Camb.  Tailed shaft with large and small circles in
wheat.  Visible from housing opposite field.  Found by Montague Keen,
CCS.  Farmer denied access for inspection.

May 5: The following five events were reported by Maria Ward, and were
confirmed by a private pilot.  They all occurred near the Ridgeway
Trail.  Details still unavailable.

1:  Stoke Hayward.  A large circle in wheat.

2:  Ivinghoe, north of Tring.  A large circle in wheat.

3:  Leighton Buzzard.  30-ft. ring in rape.

4:  Childrey Field in Bucks.  A 50-ft. circle in grass, not rape as
originally reported.  Busty Taylor believes that this was a natural
depression in the land.

5:  Near M40 before Wantage.  50-ft. circle in rape.

May 1-2:  Aston Rowant near Ridgeway, Oxon.   60-ft. donut-shaped ring
in rape. Reported to be "perfectly laid, bent not broken," swirled
anticlockwise with an eight-foot standing crop center.  The site is
not far from a dumbbell found in wheat last July.

May 1:  Saltford near Bath, Avon.  115-foot circle with seven
grapeshot satellites on one side and four satellites in wheat.
Probable human origin.  The formation is marred by muddy bootprints,
and the wheat shows evidence of having been trampled by foot.

April 21:  Near Kennington, Oxon.  Double ring in grass.

1993 surveillance/research projects in England:

...The CCS is working with small teams of Germans (a group called FGK) and
Americans to measure environmental changes (sonic, ultrasonic, electromagnetic,
etc.) in high activity areas, specifically the Vale of Pewsey, near Silbury
Hill, and in the vicinity of Alton Barnes.  Teams will work from early June
through the end of July and beyond if necessary.

...Project Argus, the U.S.-U.K.-Canadian sampling effort mounted in 1992, will
not return to England this year. Soil samples from last year are nil, and plant
sample results are inconclusive.  Publication of a final report awaits
additional funding.

... Dr. W. C. Levengood (Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in Grass Lake, MI)
is working with Nancy Talbott (Cambridge, MA) to continue plant sampling in
England.  Levengood's findings of significant results in samples to date are
contested by some plant biophysicists.

...Dr. Steven Greer, founder and international director of CSETI (Center for
the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence), Asheville, NC, will again
experiment for CE5's and circle activity in Wilts. Unconfirmed if he will
return to the Carson farm in Alton Barnes.  The Carsons do not want a repeat of
last year's crowds.

...Andrew Collins, English paranormal investigator and author of The
Circlemakers, will work out of the Carson farm in late July (where Project
Argus was based last year).  His project, ORGONE93, will investigate a
relationship between biologically or organically produced energy (orgone), crop
circles and luminous anomalies.
