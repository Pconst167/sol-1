            NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGIES FOR SPACE EXPLORATION
               August 16-19, 1992  Jackson, WY, USA

Theme: TO GO TO MARS...

"The permanent colonization of the Moon and exploration of Mars
will be major technological challenges, with nuclear power,
nuclear propulsion, and other nuclear technologies playing
significant roles.  Historically, aerospace engineers have
employed nuclear technologies only as a last resort, and most
nuclear engineers are trained primarily in terrestrial
applications, so there is a need for increased collaboration and
education.  This Topical Meeting will consider all nuclear
technologies which may find application in space exploration,
with emphasis on academic research and education."
