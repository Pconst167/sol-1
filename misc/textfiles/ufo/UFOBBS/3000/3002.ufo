        Recently the French sociologist Bertrand Meheust made an
important discovery that further clouds the question of what counts as a
'UFO precedent.'  Meheust came across an abduction report involving a
Belgian citizen named Mr. Belans.  The event took place in a remote area
near Brabant where farmers had reported suspiciously crushed vegetation
in their wheat fields.  While walking in this area, Belans noticed a man
dressed in black under a tree, apparently waiting for something.  His
curiosity aroused, Belans waited and watched.  Soon an unusual feeling
of fatigue came over him, as if some force had taken control of his
actions.  This was followed by a strange buzzing sound, then by a very
bright light, as an elongated craft landed nearby.  When a door opened
over a barely lit rectangle, the man in black stepped into the object.
Belens felt compelled to follow.

        The interior of the craft was evenly illuminated but without an
apparent source of light.  Momentarily, the craft took off with a faint
vibration, after which a tall man entered through a wall of the room.
This man seemed to know Belans's every thought.  Speaking in French, the
tall man revealed that he hailed from a faraway star.

        "Why don't you establish open contact?" asked Belans."

        "Because we do not wish to force the rapid evolution of elements
that are foreign to our own civilization," the ufonaut answered.

        When Belans was later returned to Earth, he discovered a
significant period of amnesia, missing time, a theme known to those
familiar with abduction narratives.

        This abduction is dated _1934_, twenty-seven years prior to the
Hill abduction.  More precisely, the case appeared in a science fiction
story entitled "Hodomur, Man of Infinity," published that year by Ege
Tilms. [pg. 67]
