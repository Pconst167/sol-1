  Here are just a few Canadian UFO Projects

MAGNET PROJECT:
The  Canadian Government investigated UFOs between 1950 and  1954
under  PROJECT  MAGNET. It was shut down in 1954 because  it  was
attracting  too much public attention. One of their aircraft  was
photographed with the words PROJECT MAGNET painted on it's tail.

SECOND STOREY PROJECT:
While  PROJECT  MAGNET  was  under way in  Canada  in  1950s  the
Canadian  Government started a second UFO research  group  called
PROJECT SECOND STOREY. It was a highly secret group to filter the
UFO report before being passed to PROJECT MAGNET.

ALBERTA LURE PROJECT:
Due  to  frequent UFO sightings by the RCAF (Royal  Canadian  Air
Force) over Alberta Canada in the late 1940's and early 1950's  a
novel approach to attempt an Alien Contact was put forward by the
Defense  Research  Board of Canada called a 'LURE'. To  date  the
only attempted contacts were were unsuccessful jet pursuits.  The
Defense Research Board established a restricted landing area near
it's own station at Suffield, Alberta, Canada. All Royal Canadian
Air Force and commercial aircraft were banned from the area.  The
object  was  to  encourage the UFOs to land  at  that  particular
location  so they could be contacted and studied. Capture of  one
of  the UFOs by force was also considered. Radio and  searchlight
signals  were also considered to attract UFO  attention.  Similar
projects have been suggested in the USA and France.

AVRO PROJECTS:
In the 1950s the Royal Canadian Air Force and A. V. Roe Ltd. firm
of Toronto Ontario were trying to devise man-made flying saucers.
The  two  major projects were called the AV-9 and the  VZ-9.  The
AVRO  PROJECTS  were monumental flops. The vehicles  were  highly
unstable  and  never flew very far or very long. It  is  believed
that  the AVRO devices were a decoy to explain away  either  real
UFO   sightings  or  the  test  flights  of  a  USA   captured
extraterrestrial UFO.


PORT MCNEILL PROJECT:
The Canadian Government set aside 1,000 square miles of land near
Port McNeill British Columbia to attract Aliens and persuade them
to land and make contact. Landing pads were prepared for UFOs and
similar pads were set up at St Paul Alberta. See PROJECT  ALBERTA
LURE.
