Subject: Aliens in Our Sky.
  I will now put down a list of some of the aliens that are seen in UFOs in
our sky.
1. Grey Type A. Also known as Zeta Reticuli from the Zeta Reticulan star
system (The Bernard Star) neighboring the Orion area.
2. Greysof the hawkish, abrupt, crude and blunt temperment.
3. The  master race of reptilian=type aliens. They boss the greys around.
4. Tall greys from Orion. Usually about 7 to 8 ft. tall. They have large
noses.  These grey are less viscous towards humans than the smaller greys
but are still considered hostile.
5. Grey type C. These are the shortest of the greys and tend to be about 3.5
ft. tall.  They are just as hostile to humans as the Zetas. They are from a
star system near the shoulder of Orion called Bellatrax.
6.  Human type A. These are of a genetic base similar to humans of earth.
They appear of normal height (5 to 6 ft. ) and tend to be fair-skinned with
blonde hair.  These entities have been abducted by the greys or are the
offspring of abductees and have been trained by the greys as servants.
These entities are totally subservient tolatrax.
