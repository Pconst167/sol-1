Marty:
        "Secret Life" is disinformation from the falsified "research" of
David Jacobs. His M.O. strongly points to his being a conscious asset of the
Intelligence's PSYWAR disinformation campaign about extraterrestrial presence.
 Reputable researchers develop quite different findings.

Hi Rich,

That's pretty strong words. Have you seen evidence of his disinformation
efforts?

Don:
        But, of course! Just reading "Secret Life" in comparison to serious,
unbiased CE-IV research disaplays the prejudiced nature of his findings. Even
"internal criticism" of his book shows its faulty construction.
        I am a serious, published Ph.D. researcher, who presented at M.I.T. a
clinical paper on close extraterrestrial encounters, which was well received.
I will have a book out in September from Wild Flower Press, "Close
Extraterrestrial Encounters: First-Hand Personal Accounts and Research
Findings". Watch for it. David Jacobs declined to debate me at the November
UFO Congress, and Budd Hopkins refused to debate me at the San Francisco
Whiole Life Expo. Why? Because I am doing serious scientific research, and am
exposing their shoddy disinformation, not to mention their close association
with a Las Vegas casinos operator who bankrolls their efforts, and is
probably a money-conduit for Agency financing of these two rogues. Enough
said.

Don:
        The name of the M.I.T. paper I presented is: "research On Close
Extraterrestrial Exposure with Positive Mental Health Outcomes Prompts
Revision of Attitude and Diagnostic Category".
        The "proof" of the association of Budd Hopkins & David Jacobs with
Casinos Bob Bigelow of Las Vegas is not hard to find. Besides their fawning
association with him at M.I.T.'s Abduction Study Coference (June, 1992), he
features prominently as financial angel (along with Prince Hans Adam of
Lichenstein) of the Abduction Study Conference, and the Roeper Poll of
prevalence of extraterrestrial contacts in America, and no doubt, is behind (
financially) Hopkins' "Intruders Foundation". While I cannot provide the
documents (if any exist) that Casinos Bob is the money-laundry for the agency
on the Hopkins-Jacobs Ce-IV Disinformation Project, the number of spooks
present at Casino Bob's Abduction Study Conference, and the way the agenda
was tilted to give the Dark Side presenters about abductions the bestand the
bulk of the time, strongly point to an Intelligence front operation. The fact
that Casinos Bob felt he had top lie about bankrolling the Abduction Study
Conference, and about how he makes his money, further provide indication of
an operation which tries to remain covert.
        The "M.I.T. Abduction Study Conference Proceedings" should be
published (finally!) in the next month or two. With that, the cover-up will
end: because either 150 ofthe best minds in America on CE-IV are all crazy,
or the Phenomenon is real!
        At The S.F. Wholew Life Expo, I challenged Budd and David to debate
me, after Budd chickened out, and offered $50.00 to either if they would. So
far, my money is safe.
        To the UFOlogical community: wake up! These clowns are palpably false,
 with their monolithic portrayal of a complex, multi-racial phenomenon that
extraterrestrial contacts with humans represents. Besides my research and
that of John Carpenter, just a cursory reading of the CE-IV accounts in the
past few years shows a varity of races and methods of operation, unlike the
single style (terrorist) that Budd & Dave would have you believe.
        Watch for future (oon) coming events.

Don:
        Yes, I've read "The Controllers" by Martin non. Seems to hit pretty
close to the mark. MK Ultra is alive and well, and elements of it are
probably going to be used in the DIA's disinformation pseudo-uncoverup of
Alien Presence; watch for it at a news stand near you.
        As for the Aviary, add the name of Colonel John Alexander, who
confessed to me his membership, while we dined at the Abduction Study
Conference.

        I refer to Bob Bigelow, of Robert Bigelow Enterprises, AKA Bob
Bigelow Holding Corporation of New Mexico. His corporate address is in Las
Vegas, where he principally operates, and also manages properties.

Tim:
        Tobe clear, the disinformation is contained in the whole of the book,
"Secret Life", by David Jacobs, whose appearances and soime of his
publication activities appear to be financed by Bob Bigelow, possibly
fronting cash from "other" sources.

        I presume you have read the current issue of (California) UFO
Magazine, with several articles on PSI-Tech, the
extraterrestrialmanifestation of presence here that will occur in New Mexico
allegedly by August, on remote viewing, by Army iuntelligence types (INSCOM)
posing as civilians, etc. Eschatological enough?

Tim:
        The term "eschatalogical" refers to the End Times, and, in Christian
tradition, to the second Coming of Christ and the End of the World. The term
has been borrowed by certain UFO writers to refer to the Open Manifestation
of the Extraterrestrials among the people of Earth, and the World-changing
implicationsof that event.
        You can read my mail elsewhere, particularly a piece to John Komar
dated today, May 21, on PSI-Tech's disinformational twist and intrusion into
the Extraterrestrial Manifestation event.
