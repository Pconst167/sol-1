Orlando - Three saucer-shaped UFOs buzzed Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom on 
the morning of June 7 in an apparent bid to investigate the park's new 
ExtraTERRORestrial attraction, which simulates an encounter with aliens from 
outer space.

And far from being what rearchers call "a benign visit," the UFOs reportedly 
sprayed visitors with a bluish-green ray that caused at least on victim to 
develop psychic powers - and the ability to move small objects just by looking 
at them.

Air Force jets managed to photograph the UFOs but failed in their bid to 
intercept them. As the reconnaissance planes approached, the UFOs glowed 
bright white and, eyewitnesses said, vanished into thin air.

Neither the Air Force nor the Pentagon is talking for the record. But military 
insiders have confirmed that both agencies are "taking the incident seriously 
because the Disney park attracts millions of civilian visitors who might 
conceivably be in peril."

Disney spokesman Bill Logan initially declined to comment on the report.

He later issued a brief statement stating that "we can neither confirm nor 
deny the occurrence of UFO activity in this area."

"Any Air Force involvement will have to be discussed with the Air Force."

While Logan chose his words carefully, a Pentagon source got right to the 
point - calling the encounter "a chilling reminder of our helplessness in the 
face of extraterrestrial activity on Earth."

He went on to say that a 17-year-old Orlando youth has become the subject of 
an intensive investigation after reporting the onset of psychic and 
telekinetic powers following the encounter.

"We suspect that the UFOs were interested in Disney's new Alien Encounter 
attraction, but proving it is another matter," continued the source.

"As usual, we have questions - but no answers."
