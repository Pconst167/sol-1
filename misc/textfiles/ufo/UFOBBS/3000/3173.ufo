Pulsed microwave research was carried out by Dr. James M. McCampbell.  He
wrote a book called _UFOLOGY_, which went into the how's and why's.  His
research was an attempt to reproduce conditions reported by UFO witnesses,
those people having had a sighting while in their cars.  He found high
intensity pulsed microwave emissions could allow an engine to stall, and to
restart mysteriously once the UFO departed.  He said microwaves could cause
an audible hum sound to a witness, and to cause radio interference and such. 
I don't have the book, nor the specifics, but it was an excellent read.  By
frozen, I think you may mean the electrical system is 'overloaded' - in
effect -  shorted out.  You have proper current/electron flow from the
voltage 'pressure' in the circuitry, or you don't.  A short is basically a
misdirection of the positive to negative current flow.  Thus, ELM
interference could result in a series of cyclic fluctuations to the normal
operating voltage/current through the electrical components.  My ignition
coil died recently, I know the consequences.  ;-)
 
Reports of lights dimming/radio static/engine hesitation, and finally failure
altogether, indicate that some type of distance dependant, radiant
interference is present in the area of the affected car.  Similar to when you
have the radio tuned to an AM station, and pass under a bridge experiencing a
decrease in the strength of the radio signal (due to partial
blockage/absorption of the radio waves).  FM is a shorter (more penetrating)
wavelength, and is not affected as markedly as AM. This would follow that the
electrical flow is impeded somehow, causing engine stalling and other
anomalies.

To explain automobile engine stalling, we can assume that the UFOs anti-mass
field can similarly ionize air in the magnetic fields that exist around the
wiring and ignition coil inside of the car's engine compartment.  Once
ionized to form a plasma, air loses its normal insulating properties and will
conduct electricity at lower voltages.  [Commonly referred to as the
insulator 'breakdown voltage'.]  Thus, the automobile's high voltage
electrical current will follow the path of least electrical resistance to
jump directly from the grounded engine block through the ionized air
surrounding ignition wiring, to enter any cracks in the wiring's insulation
to make its way back to the positive pole of the car's battery rather than
jump across the still-ionized air between the spark plugs.  The ionized
coating of grime on the ignition wires or, if there is extensive ionization
of most of the air in the engine compartment, directly through this ionized
air.  When this happens, the spark plugs will not fire properly, the engine
will miss, and eventually stall as its idle speed drops.  Ionization near the
ignition coil's [electromagnet's] external magnetic field may also allow high
voltage short-circuiting here that can stall the engine.  Again, as the UFO
departs, the plasma that causes this malfunction deionizes and the ignition
system can function normally again because its high voltage components are
again properly insulated by air with its normally high resistance to high
voltage electrical current.
 
Automobiles with diesel engines seem to be immune to being stalled by the
proximity of a UFO, the reason being that diesel engines do not utilize a
high voltage ignition system.
 
Once the car is stalled, the motorist may, upon seeing the UFO, desperately
try to start his or her engine.  Upon turning the ignition key to the 'start'
position, a heavy electrical current will flow through the starter motor
field and armature windings which are usually wired together in series.  As
battery current flows through the starter's field windings, it produces a
powerful magnetic field that projects out of the starter's die-cast aluminum
housing.  This magnetic field then combines with the UFOs anti-mass field
radiation penetrating the engine compartment and the air around the starter
becomes highly ionized.  The resulting ions will now orbit around the
magnetic field of the field windings to form an 'ionic vortex' of moving
atmospheric ions.  This vortex then generates its own magnetic field of the
field windings.  The two opposed magnetic fields then cancel each other out
and, for all practical purposes, it is as though the starter had no field
windings which, of course, means that the starter cannot turn the pinion gear
attached to its armature to crank the engine.  After the UFO leaves the
scene, the ionic vortex will dissipate and its collapsing magnetic field will
cut across the starter's field windings to induce a powerful current flow in
them. It is this current that activates the starter and often will restart
the again functional engine without any effort on the driver's part as long
as the ignition key is still in the 'on' position.

Text goes on to say that many devices (i.e. power lines, compass needles,
computers, TVs), practically anything that has current flow along an
electrical path, and generates or operates with magnetic fields could be
affected.  The chapter more fully explains why ionized air would be produced
by an anti-mass field.  As a side-note, ball lightning may exist upon a
similar type of ionized air/plasma formula, due to its localized electrical
charge.  It is usually associated with thunder storms.  BTW, if you see ball
lighting, stay away from it -- if you can.
