Article  How to Terminate a Negative Close Encounter

General Defensive Concepts

1. You must first try to determine if you are dealing with a
positive or negative entity. A general rule is that entities
that create in you feelings of joy and happiness along with
spiritual advancement are "good." Those that create dread,
fear, or sensations of power or desire are "bad." However,
some believe powerful negative entities can falsely create
good feelings in a victim.

2. Entities with eyes that glow white or blue are generally
thought to be "good" while those with red or yellow eyes are
thought to be "bad." An accompanying foul odor (particularly
of sulphur) indicates a definite negative entity.

3. Both positive and negative entities often travel as "balls
of light" or clouds. White and blue colored balls or clouds
are thought to be good. Black, brown, yellow and red balls or
clouds are thought by many to represent negative spirits.

4. You must believe that you can control, defeat, or banish
any negative entity that attempts to paralyze or exert control
over you. THIS IS A MUST.

5. You must overcome any FEAR that arises. THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT. Some paralysis may even be self-induced.

6. Be vigilant when you are in an altered state of consciousness
such as during some phases of sleep, drowsiness, meditation, and
watching television.

7. Do not look directly into a ball of light (or eyes of an entity)
especially if it's strobing, pulsating, or flickering in an
unusual manner.

8. Beware of very close contact - particularly of a very intimate
or sexual nature. There are indications some entities have strong
energy fields that can cause personal harm to humans.

9. YOU MUST BLOCK ATTEMPTS BY THE ENTITY TO CONTROL YOU. THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT. If you don't block the control attempt, you will
become a victim. The blocking must start early, preferably upon
first signs of materialization. These signs will vary with the
individual. SOme sense their presence, other hear strange sounds,
hear buzzing or humming sounds in the head, see lights or fog, or
experience a combination of signs.

10. YOU MAY HAVE TO USE A COMBINATION OF BLOCKING ATTEMPTS TO BE
SUCCESSFUL.
