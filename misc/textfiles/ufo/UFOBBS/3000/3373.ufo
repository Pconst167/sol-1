Taos, N.M. - A shocking top-secret government report has revealed that the 
alien infant who survived a UFO crash in September of 1993 is still alive - 
and the lovable tot may be facing a cold future of laboratory experiments!

The report, leaked to WWN by a concerned government psychiatrist, confirms 
that the little alien girl was rescued from the wreckage of a manned starship 
after it slammed into a desert mesa. She was the sole survivor.

The story of the baby's discovery made headlines worldwide and was featured in 
the Oct 12, 1993, issue of the NEWS.

The charred bodies of four adult occupants of the mysterious craft, which came 
here from another galaxy, were also discovered at the site.

Now, almost two years later, a psychiatrist involved with the child from the 
beginning has decided to release a 71-page classified file containing a case 
history, complete with pictures of the alien toddler, because he fears for her 
safety.

"She's fine and happy right now, but that's about to change," said the unnamed 
psychiatrist.

"When they found her, the military didn't know exactly what to do with her. 
They hid her away at a remote desert location - a temporary home where she's 
been raised and cared for by a loving nurse who's been like a mother to her.

"She's been taught by some of the best teachers on Earth - flown in secretly 
to feed her incredibly astute mind. And she's flourished. She's only 2 years 
old but she's doing advanced algebra and speaks 17 languages.

"But now that her I.Q. has been tested at over 180, top-level Washington 
officials have taken a new interest in her. They're planning to remove her 
from the only home she's ever known, take her to a cold, sterile laboratory in 
Washington, and subject her to a series of scientific experiments to learn why 
whe's so smart.

"But as a psychiatrist I can tell you, if she's cut off from the love of here 
nurse and the warmth of her home she'll wither and die. The whole reason her 
intelligence has blossomed is because of the tenderness and love this woman 
has given her for this last year and 10 months."

The space child is remarkably large for her age. She's hairless with large 
almond-shaped eyes, pointed ears and just a tiny suggestion of a nose.

Her long fingers taper down to suction cup-like tips. When she hugs her nurse, 
the child often uses the suction cups to gently cling to the woman.

The doctor said the woman - whom he refuses to name and is referred to only as 
"Nurse X" in the file - taught the child to walk and talk and spends up to 
five hours a day hugging and holding her. The woman has expressed an interest 
in adopting the starchild, he added.

"We don't know what planet she comes from," said the psychiatrist. "But we 
do know two things about these aliens. One: Thier intelligence far exceeds 
ours. And two: They seem to need prodigious amounts of love and affection.

"I'm coming forward in hopes that the American public, armed with this 
knowledge, will take steps to prevent the government from removing this 
innocent child from the only home she's ever known."
