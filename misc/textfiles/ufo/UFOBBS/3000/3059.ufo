Three star tells all..........

        While  I  was  in  Phoenix Arizona, at the Alternate Alien and
New Age convention, I met Tim, (Mr.. UFO Beckley) the  author  of  the
UFO  Magazine,  called UFO UNIVERSE. He seems like a very nice person,
and I enjoy reading his magazine.

        One  of  the  articles  in  his  Oct-Nov  1991  issue  of  his
magazine,  had  to  do  with  an unidentified 3 star general. Here are
some of the points he made; In  regards  to  the  book,  (The  Roswell
Incident)  I  was  given  some  articles  to look at, and was asked to
participate  in  the  "AWARENESS  PROGRAM",  which  is  a   means   of
disseminating  alien contact to the public. Although I had turned this
down, I later was shown some articles, a tape and  still  photographs.
In  these  I  saw  the alien craft, the frozen alien bodies, (from the
Roswell site)  and  the  live  alien  which  is  a  guest  of  the  US
Government.

        There  have  been  several  UFO  crashes  over  the years. The
aliens really have no "invasion" planned for this  planet.  They  have
visited on and off here, for thousands of years.

        Our  US  guest is over 300 years old. The aliens use about 55%
of their brain capacity,or ability; they do have DNA. The alien  which
is  a  guest  of  the US Government,is 5"3 tall, weighs 96 lbs., has a
large head (hairless) and large  slanted  eyes.  Some  of  the  aliens
abilities include moderate telepathy and telekinesis.

        Cattle,  as  well  as  humans  have  been used in alien and US
research for various biological  applications.  Most  humans  are  not
hurt  in  the research and experimentation. Some however have died due
to complications and downright carelessness.

        Several cross  breed  young  have  been  born  to  both  human
females  and  alien  females. We humans are fully biological with most
visiting aliens. Some we are not.(more than one type  or  species  has
visited  our  planet)  The  US  and  Britain have made a secret treaty
agreement, with the aliens, in exchange for technology, and  so-called
"recon"  missions,  during  times  of  human conflict. Aliens agree to
stay out of human wars, and not to interfere with society. Also, there
are special "teams" which are  designated  to,  eradicate,  discredit,
harass  and  trump-up charges to control those humans which experience
contacts or visitations from aliens, including  also  those  who  make
verifiable sightings.

        The   alien  crafts  have  been  more-or-less  copied  by  top
scientific  experts,  and  are  functional.  The   Awareness   Program
(mentioned  before)  was designed to inform the public gradually, in a
systematic,  logical  way.  This  is  a  joint  governmental-and-alien
program.  It  is coupled with the increased alien-human abductions and
contacts. If done correctly there  will  be  little  or  no  panic  or
resistance.  The  worlds  governments  will  retain  control, avoiding
chaos.

        In some of the reports it was noted  that  our  children  were
mentioned  as  some  of the cargo on the alien space crafts. There are
over a million missing children every year in the US alone. The aliens
take about 2,200 a year from the US and other countries combined.  The
rest of the children are due to mankinds Darkside.

        The  children are used in several ways; Biological, to educate
and return;  Experimentation,  disease  study,  the  same  as  adults.
Implants  are  being  used on the humans taken aboard the alien crafts
and returned. Some of these  implants  are  microscopic  in  size,(and
smaller) which influence the growth function and learning capabilities
of the individuals.

        The  A.P. (Awareness Program) calls for the funding of movies,
television series  and  specials,  and  books.  These  will  be  about
friendly  alien contacts. There are disks, triangles and oblong-shaped
craft. They range from 30 ft, for the smaller recon disc, to over  730
ft,  for the larger mother disc,(or flying saucers,if you will...) The
triangle shaped craft are 210 ft. in diameter. The oblong shaped craft
is the really big one of the  3.  The  only  one  ever  found  by  the
military  was  in  the  late  60's;  it measured 1,100 ft. long with a
circumference of 310 ft. There is some noise made, however, all  craft
are almost totally silent.

        In  closing,  these are my words; (John Winston) "These people
which were picked up at the Roswell are not my first choice  of  space
peoples  to  cooperate  with. Ike turned down my friend, Valient Thor,
from Venus, so I guess I will have to work with the space peoples  our
government  has  chosen."  As the uneducated person who cussed all the
time was sent to England to be educated and saw a group of  bow-legged
cowboys  for the first time, I'll leave you with this saying; "Low and
behold what fools are these who wear their legs in parentheses."

Don. Don is not me.
