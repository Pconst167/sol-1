Geest: Good evening, We would like to welcome William (Bill) S. English    
       tonight. 

English: Thank you Ken, I am honored...

Geest: thanks....ok Bill, first up, when did you first become interested   
       in UFO's?

English: My first involvement with UFOs came as a direct result of my      
         employment as a civilian Data Analyst for the United States 
         Department of Defence at RAF Chicksands, in England. I was 
         located at the Air Force Security Services Command listening 
         station there...

Geest: What did you do at the RAF position?

English: Essentially it was my job to analyse data that was taken from     
         Soviet Block Nations Broadcasts and communications via the 
         "Big Ear" that was located at Chicksands. When analising the 
         data after it was translated I was to gage it's probibility 
         and assign to it a factor or percentage in order to help 
         ascertain what the information may possibly pertain to..

Geest: At what point did UFO's come into the picture?

English: Well, where to begin....Hmmmm...It all began during the later     
         part of June of 1977. I reported to work as I normally did 
         and picked up my assignments sheet for the day. When I read 
         the assignments sheet there was only one job listed. I was to 
         analyse documents that had been brought in by Diplomatic Courier. 
         This didn't seem to be to much out of order since I had done this 
         type of thing before. After getting my morning cup of coffee and 
         picking on the enlisted men I went to my work station and rang the 
         duty officer on the intercom to inform him that I was ready to 
         receive the documents in question. Security messures at that time 
         required that the DO bring all materials for analysis and that 
         the Analyst sign for them directly. The D.O would then lock my 
         cubicle door until I informed him that I was finished or need a
         break, at which time he would come in and take pocession of the 
         documents and sign my log stating that he had them.. This occassion 
         he brought in a diplomatic pouch that was sealed and locked and 
         broke the seal and unlocked the pouch. This WAS unusual. In most 
         cases the pouches or material were already removed from whatever they
         were delivered in and placed in security jackets. He then presented 
         the documents to me and I signed for them and he locked the door 
         and I started reading.

Geest: Do you have any idea why the messanger broke the seal on the pouch?

English: He had no choice. The seal had to be broken in order to open the  
         pouch...

Geest: What did you read/ and or see?

English: The pouch contained what appeared to be a military Tech manual at 
         first glance, but when he handed it to me I saw that the title 
         on it was "Grudge/Blue Book Report #13", and it contained several 
         ultra top secret clearance codes on the cover. At the time I had 
         no idea what it was I was reading until I got about four or five 
         pages into it. I then discovered that what I had was what appeared 
         to be a complete Technical and Medical investigation report 
         concerning UFOs and Alien Beings...

Geest: Where was the pouch suppose to go to...ie was it to go to the       
       Pentagon etc...

English: I have no idea where it was supposed to go after I read and       
         analysed it. Once we did our job we put it back into the hands
         of the D.O. and that was the last time we saw the documents that 
         we worked on...It could have gone anywhere after I had it....

Becker: Why would you have been given this report?

English: At the time I assumed that it was to do the job that I was        
         employed to do. Analyse the documents that were given to me. 
         I asumed that at the time also they wanted someone with a pretty 
         good track record to take a look at it. The Desposition form with 
         the instructions said to analyse the document and it's various 
         sections and assign a probibility rating to it based on the 
         material that it contained..

Geest: A Probibility of what, please forgive we are not military folks...

English: Well, let me explain it a little so that maybe it will be a       
         little clearer than mud <grin> Essentially I was to evaluate the 
         material and information. Once I did this I was then to basicly 
         use my intuition and decide whether or not the information was true 
         or not. We usually had a basic criteria that we followed and that 
         criteria changed almost daily depending upon the information and 
         data that was available to us as as analyst. In short we had to 
         decide if it was true or if it was horse sh*t and then give what 
         we considered to be a percentage rating of this fact or fiction...

Petroski: Could you give us a simple example of the criteria that you went 
          by?

English: Essentialy the basic criteria could consist of any number of
         things...Example...We have received a transmission stating 
         that Commrade Smuck was in Petrograd on such and such a date....
         Based on the fact that two days previous we received a transmission 
         stating that Smuck's secretary had completed his travel 
         arrangements we then put two and two together and assign a 
         probibilty rating of 95% to the fact that Smuck is indeed in 
         Petrograd...Also there was the fact that in many cases we went
         on gut feelings based on our own general knowedge and skills in
         comparative data analysis. In short we would compare one fact 
         as presented in a document against another fact that was presented 
         in a document. This in fact is how I analysed the Grudge/Blue 
         Book Report since I had no previous knowledge concerning UFOs 
         prior to encounter this document.

Geest: What did you think when you first read the UFO material?

English: At the time I didn't know what to think.

Geest: Moving forward, after your military service, when did you become    
       interested in investigating UFO's....

English: You must remember that by this time I was already a civilian. My  
         then wife was employed by the Department of Defence Schools System
         and after my discharge from the service in 1974 I stayed with her 
         in Germany where we had first met and then she took a transfer to 
         England that had been offered to her, at RAF Chicksands. I was 
         employed about a month after our arrival when I met a former 
         Commanding officer that I had served with in Vietnam. By this time 
         he was employed by The Department of Defense in the Security 
         services Command...

Geest: How widespread is the knowldege of Project Grudge, or is there any 
       way to know?

English: At the time I read the documents, from looking at the traffic log 
         which is located on the cover of the book it looked like several 
         foriegn governments as well as the United States were very much
         aware of the contents of the Book. The last transmital record 
         showed that it had come from the American Embassy in Moscow..As 
         of this moment I cannot begin to guess just how wide spread the 
         knowledge is...

Geest: could you comment on the names of the various Gouvernments that
       were on the traffic log?

English: There were several, the most notable were Canada, England, Soviet 
         Union, East Germany, West Germany, and I think a couple of the Soviet
         Satilite Nations such as Poland, and Yugoslavia....

Becker: I have to ask what probility did you assign the report?

English: Based on the material that was in the book, to include            
         photographs of what appeared to be Alien bodies, autopsy reports,
         Technical reports on several recovered craft, and most particularly
         a report that involved me directly while serving in Vietnam, I 
assigned the Report a probibility rating of approximately 98.9999 percent...

Geest: ok...Let's move ahead a few years. In the last 2-5 years their has
       been a series of "reports" from various sources indicating the US
       Government is involved in a coverup of UFO's. Many of these reports 
       have come from William Moore, John Lear, Bill Cooper, and as of 
       late one Robert Lazer. Most of these "statements" seem to strech the 
       imagination of most UFOlogists. Could you comment on the Moore 
       material?

English: First of all, I would like to state for the record that my claims
         are right up there with all of the rest of them as far as 
         stretching the imagination. However, I will be the first to 
         acknowledge the fact that the material that I viewed could well 
         have been fraudulent information that I was supposed to see for 
         whatever reason.  I do not present any of this material as the 
         god awful truth, I only relate what I saw and what has happened 
         to me since the viewing of that information. This is something
         that I try to make clear whenever I speak on this topic....
         As far as Bill Moore is concerned....For the work that he did on the
         "Roswell Incident" and several other books, it is my opinion that 
         he is to be commended. But since then, with a few possible 
         exceptions, the material that he has presented, most notably the 
         material that he presented in that garbage television production 
         "UFO Cover-up Live" is material that he took from interviews with 
         me back in the late seventies. It is my opinion that everything 
         he presented as having been the direct result of his investigations 
         of those two buzzards Falcon and Condor, is a lot of CRAP!

Geest: There seems to be a new version of UFOlogy that is surfacing. We
       have reports from Lear, Cooper, etc., It is my thought that these 
       people are not UFOligists but rather Cases, and as such are not 
       really UGOlogists....would you care to comment....

English:I have a great deal of respect for John Lear as a man. In all 
        fairness to John I have not given his material very much thought 
        since I have not really had the opportunity to view his research 
        data and material. I cannot say for sure that his material is true, 
        however I believe that he believes it is. I would also point out 
        that were it not for John I would still be in hiding in Virginia. 
        He is the man directly responsiable for me coming out of hiding 
        and getting back into active investigations and public speaking 
        on the subject.

Geest: What do you think about the current status of the various UFO       
       groups around the country, ie are we working together or are we 
       working against each other?

English:  Well, unfortunately it is my feeling that currently we are all
          caught in a morass of wheel spinning. During the past two years
          I have noticed that very little legitimate investigation is 
          being done. Not because the desire is not there, but more because 
          we are forced to listen to such people as Bill Cooper and Bill 
          Moore. Moore is a jerk in my estimation, but there doesn't seem 
          to be anyone quite like Bill Cooper. Most of the organizations 
          have allowed themselves to become factioned by Cooper's statements 
          and such based upon their own personal beliefs and the horse sh*t 
          that Cooper spreads...There was a time when these organizations 
          were devoting themselves to serious research. When Cooper showed up
          it seemed that they became involved in other things...Frankly it 
          is my estimation that all of the UFO Investigative organizations 
          need to come together and share information of all types in order 
          to keep from working at cross purposes....UFINET has already 
          instituted a policy of open cooperation between all UFO 
          organizations and shares whatever information that it has 
          available  to anyone serious about researching...

Geest: I agree. It seems to me that the sharing of information should be
       the focal point, regardless if you are a member of MUFON, 
       CUFON, or what ever UFO group. one last question.....It seems that 
       UFO research is not recognized within "the media" and as such we are 
       now more or less starting our own communications media ie...the PC 
       and BBS....would you care to comment and please include the number 
       to your system....

English: I have to agree with you that "the Media" doesn't look upon UFO
         research with any degree of seriousness, however I think that 
         this is more our own fault than anything else. We have no 
         standardization criteria and as a result we attract those elements 
         that attempt to take advantage of us and those around us with 
         regards to research. The simple and basic cure for this would seem 
         to me to be a coming together as organizations and working out a 
         standardization of investigative criteria. Once that criteria is 
         in place and we begin to work within it's frame work, then we will 
         be recognised by first the scientific community and then the media.
         With regard to establishing our own communications network. That 
         is the natural course of things I think. With PC's and BBS's 
         becoming more and more available to the everyday persons it is 
         only natural that we utilize this media to exchange ideas and 
         information. I don't believe that it is exclusive to just UFO 
         information but as a whole...I will say that UFINET News and 
         information service is (as of this moment and besides the government)
         the only Professional UFO News and Information Service/Investigation
         group in the world. We are not a non-profit organization and 
         those members of UFINET  Who are certified by us are supported by 
         a host of professional services, to include legal aide, and resource
         information..We do however provide a free access system for people 
         to call and exchange information and investiative reports. that 
         number is (505) 437-7198. We also have a mainframe computer system 
         that is accessable through several regional Bell operating companies 
         and around the world. It is extremely new and we are still waiting 
         to see what the responce is going to be like...

Geest: I would like to thank Bill English for taking time to speak with us 
       tonight.......Bill thanks for the interview...

English: My pleasure Ken....
