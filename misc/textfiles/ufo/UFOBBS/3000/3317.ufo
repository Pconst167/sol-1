             VIDEO FOOTAGE OF ROSEWELL AUTOPSY

(This information is shared on our Web Site and comes from 
various sources posted on Internet) 
  
The information in this page is an example of Information we 
hope to share.  It comes from posts on the Newsnet sharing 
information published in a British Magazine.  While the 
video footage has not been confirmed, I (Joshua) did get a 
call from a friend who said a mutual friend of ours meet 
Colin Andrews, a leading British Crop Circle Researcher, who 
confirmed he had viewed this footage.  I believe it is only 
a question of time before official confirmation of UFOs is 
announced and this video may be one of the catalyst to help 
this situation.

Stop Press:  Video Footage of Roswell Autopsy Discovered  
  
Less than 15 hours before we were due to go to press, Reg 
Presley appeared on the BBC morning chat show, "Good Morning 
with Anne and Nick."  He disclosed some interesting 
information concerning the Roswell alleged UFO crash.  This 
is how the interview went (although Reg was supposed to be 
discussing the subject of crop circles on the chat show, he 
wasted no time in launching into the latest information 
concerning the Roswell case).  
 
(Concerning the alleged UFO crash at Roswell): "If you think 
that you aren't going to find out about that, I have some 
great information.  I was speaking to a producer the other 
day who has just got hold of some film footage of the 
autopsy done on the aliens."  This was followed by shocked 
reactions from Anne and Nick who bombarded Reg with 
questions as fast as they could before the end of the 
transmission in five minutes' time.  
  
They were over in America searching for some old Elvis film.  
This old guy, now about 76, said, 'If you think that this 
Elvis Presley footage is fantastic, what do you think about 
this?', and from underneath his bed he pulled out 15 
cartridges of old film, and he said, 'I thought this was so 
important at the time that I made a copy and I didn't tell 
anyone and I've said nothing since.'"  
  
"Have you seen this?" Reg was questioned.  
  
"I've seen the film, and the film has been analysed and it 
is original 1947 footage." 
  
"What does the video show?" Anne asked him  
  
"It shows an alien being worked on, in an autopsy, by 
humans. I've seen one (alien), but I believe there are three 
more.  There's 15 reels of this, so there's 150 minutes of 
the crash site, debris, and the autopsy."  
  
"How do you know it's an alien from what you've seen?" 
probed Anne.  
  
"Well, it doesn't look like you and I!"  Reg joked.  "It's 
longer than we've been led to believe.  We've been led to 
believe that they're four feet (in height), but the one I 
have seen has to be six feet or more."  
 
Although it remains to be seen what the outcome of this 
whole case is, if it is a genuine piece of footage then it 
will be a huge step forward in the Roswell case.  If there's 
footage on the cine film of the crash site as well, then it 
would certainly add credibility to the whole case.  It will 
be interesting to see how this footage turns out...

============================================================ 
  
It has been reported that the U.S. television show, 
Encounters, has purchased a copy of this footage for 
$150,000 and plans to air it later in the year.  There is 
another report that there will be two private showings of 
the footage within two weeks; one showing will take place in 
L.A., the other on the East Coast. No other details 
available.  
  
Colin Andrews, the well-known crop circle investigator, 
reportedly viewed 15 minutes of the footage which showed the 
bodies.  
 
============================================================ 
  
The following information was published in the February 1995 
Issue of The Circle Hunter magazine, published in England 
(Information on this Magazine below).  The excerpt below is 
a follow up to an article from their January issue 
concerning alleged video footage of the Rosewell incident in 
1947.  Reports of the footage being purchased by the U.S. 
television show Encounters have not been confirmed. 
 
============================================================ 
 
 (Begin magazine text) 
 
All the talk at the moment seems to be about the recently 
discovered video concerning the Rosewell alleged UFO crash 
and subsequent autopsy of alien bodies (see article last 
issue).  John Holman, UK co-ordinator of "Operation Right to 
Know", has been on the case talking to Reg Presley and 
people invovled in the Rosewell incident, and has uncovered 
some more details about the film.  The part of the film that 
contains footage of the debris reveals an abundance of 
military personel, as well as a large crane with lifting 
tackle. 
 
Perhaps the most astounding detail which has surfaced is 
that a number of recognisable persons can be made out.  One 
of these is President Harry Truman, the US President during 
the Rosewell incident.  The implications of this alone are 
quite startling, adding credence to the hypothesis that the 
video is not hoaxed.  The lengths that someone would have to 
go to, to obtain footage of President Truman in 1947 and 
somehow "mask" him on to set-up footage of a UFO crash site 
all on old cine film typical of 1947 would in itself be a 
very difficult task.  Take, for example, the 1994 Hollywood 
smash, "Forrest Gump" where the actor Tom Hanks appears to 
shake hands with President Kennedy in a piece of black and 
white footage.  This was produced using the lastest 
technology, at great expense to their budgest (alledgedly 
the most expensive scene in the whole film), and using a 
whole army of scientists and engineers.  In the case of the 
Rosewell film, cine footage of other recognisable persons 
would have to be masked on to the screen in addition to 
President Truman, and then all the different characters 
would have to interact with each other in an operation much 
more complex than the simple handshake performed in "Forest 
Gump".  
 
The BBC have already agreed to show the film on network 
television later this year, but the film will be studied 
further, before then, to help determine the origin of this 
bizarre footage.  Time should reveal the true nature of this 
old cine film, but one thing is certain: it is either a hoax 
of unprecendented proportion, or elese a UFO really did 
crash, alien bodies were really recovered, and the President 
of the United States was present at the site.  Different 
people will have different views, but at this stage we 
should all be open minded and prepared to accept either 
possibility.

Hi Joshua, thank you for the encouragement. At this point in 
time things are happening very quickly in England concerning 
the Roswell case, much faster than I can keep up with. I'll 
do my best to keep you informed, I believe it's very 
important that this info. reach out past just the UFO 
insiders. I know you have your own spin on this type of 
info., I believe that I can trust you to keep the spirit and 
intent in which this info. is being givin. Please also keep 
in mind that this could all be a hoax, and that this 
infomation could be givin out to pull us away from much more 
important matters. With that in mind here's part III (The 
two previous parts listed above).  
 
Here's the latest on the Roswell film/autopsy report part 3. 
I would like to give special thanks to the International UFO 
Congress & Film Festival for there help in making this 
information available. I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to give 
the name of the individual who faxed us this information. 
Hopefully he will allow us to use his name in the future. I 
received this fax on 02-28-95 from England via are friends 
at the International UFO Congress in Oakland Ca. No changes 
have been made to the text in any way, it appears just as I 
received it. 
 
============================================================ 
 
"With regards to your questions about the alleged Rosswell 
Film Footage. First of all I am very careful about what 
appears on these computer networks. In England It appears 
that everybody with a computer is trying to get into 
the act with the consequence that they are getting full of 
total rubbish".  
 
"The name of the person who went to the United State and 
purchased the film is Ray Santilli He is involved in the 
production of films, mainly musical. I have been in touch 
with him and he confirmed that he had purchased several 
reels of 1940s vintage miliary film footage which purports 
to show autopsy being carried out on alien beings". 
 
"So far he has allowed certain people to view 15 minutes of 
the film. I had chance to view the film but was not prepared 
to travel 250 miles in view of what I was told from people 
who had seen it". 
 
"The film which as you can imagine is very poor quality and 
shows a body on an ordinary wooden table, with the torso 
covered with a white sheet. Only the head arms and legs are 
visible. The head is turned away from the camera, so cannot 
be seen properly. Two men in white coats are shown taking 
samples of flesh from the arms and placing them in plastic 
bags. The autopsy appears to be taking place in a shed and 
the lighting is by gas pressure lamps. There is no sign of 
any contamination prceedures or even gloves worn by the 
Doctors performing the Autopsy. the film shows a date which 
is 17 days later than the Rosswell crash and the use of 
plastic bags for samples is to me unbelievable. I have 
attended hundreds of post mortem examinations and the use of 
plastic bags for samples is totally unthinkable. Glass 
containers have always been used for body samples because 
they do not contaminate the sample, but plastic does. In 
those days plastic bags were new and very primitive". 
 
"Santilli states that he has entered into contract with the 
giant Fox Lorber Corporation in America to produce a film 
and videos which will contain some of this footage". 
 
That's it, the rest of the fax is of a personal nature and 
is considered confidential. 
 
... I haven't lost my mind; it's backed up on tape 
somewhere!

Subject: Alleged Archive Film           
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
You will no doubt have heard of the alleged archive film. 
 
Whilst we must remain suspicious, there is an interesting 
article, a late inclusion, in the current issue of UFO 
Magazine (UK): 
 
"Several cannisters of mid-1940's movies footage was 
apparently copied by an official USAF photographer - and 
stored secretly until now. 
 
According to our information, the cannisters contain several 
reels of film which allegedly depict UFO crash sites and 
debris; more interestingly however, is the autopsy of at 
least two humanoid figures - 5 feet 7 inches tall, and 3.6 
feet respectively.  
 
One sequence, shows two surgeons appearing to take thin 
strips of "skin" from a tall humanoid figure who has a large 
oval-shaped head and black oval-shaped eyes. Together with 
other strips of skin, these were placed in a sealed glass 
container. In the background can be seen an armed military 
sentry wearing a cover-all. 
 
The environment was dark and gloomy, apparently resembling a 
field-type hospital tent, illuminated by paraffin-lit 
pressure lamps. 
 
The 76 year old former US Army veteran had met a British 
television producer who was searching archive material. We 
are told that this elderly man, appreciating the 
significance of the footage, whilst at the same time 
recognising perhaps his last opportunity to capitalise on 
his good fortune, entered into an agreement which would see 
him financially secure during his twilight years.  
 
We are led to believe that over 100 minutes of film exists, 
and negotiations have already taken place to release 
significant sections in the near future. Our understanding 
is that six-figure sums are involved, but this has now 
become a multi-national chase for exclusive rights between 
British, American and Japanese media corporations.  
 
It is also believed that some of the data is related to the 
infamous Roswell UFO crash which purportedly occurred in 
1947. 
 
Most remarkable of all, is the revelation that the then 
President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, can clearly 
be seen wandering amongst wreckage of a crash site which 
could well be linked to Roswell and/or Corona, New Mexico.  
 
UFO Magazine is making strenuous efforts to verify matters, 
and Anthony Dodd is in close touch with the English producer 
concerned and other key figures."

It's my understanding that a special screening of this 
footage was held today in the UK for the Archbishop of 
Canterbury... Fox is supposed to be airing the footage in a 
special this month... Apparently they outbid everyone else 
for the rights, paying $150K for 15 minutes of footage out 
of over 90 minutes... It also appears that initial 
examination/testing of the film showed it to be consistent 
with film from the 1940's... It supposedly shows footage 
from the autopsies of a Grey, and a "Technician "type (term 
used by R.D. Butler in his article on UFO Occupant 
Classifications ftp.webcom.com/pub/way/> to read it) smaller 
humanoid being.  This thing is causing a stir in the 
appropriate places. Talk is that this could be the beginning 
of things finally opening up. We'll see....  
 
Keep us clued in as to when this special will air.
