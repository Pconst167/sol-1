A fierce dogfight between UFOs in the North Atlantic is being blamed for 100-
foot waves that battered the coasts of New England and CAnada.

At first, meteorologists believed the monster waves were caused by changing 
weather patterns.

Now they've reconsidered in the light of eyewitness accounts of a spectacular 
air and undersea battle between alien craft.

The crews of three freighters and two fishing boats say they barely escaped 
with their lives as they were tossed about on boiling seas as the monstrous 
spacecraft battled.

"It was like being trapped aboard the world's greatest roller coaster," says 
Pedro Alvarez, a doctor on the Spanish fish-processing ship Alhambra.

"We rose and dropped so fast on 100-foot-high waves that we all became 
violently sea sick and some of the crew suffered broken bones."

FIRING BEAMS

According to Dr. Alvarez, the Alhambra and its crew were returning to port 
from fishing waters off Greenland when two spaceships suddenly materialized 
from a clear blue sky, firing at each other with beams of light.

"Three more spacecraft appeared and joined in the dogfight," he adds. After 
almost 10 minutes of mind-bending maneuvers in the sky, the UFOs suddenly 
swooped down into the ocean, still shooting at each other.

A Greek freighter blundered into the alien battle zone when the fighting was 
at its peak.

"One second we were on a relatively calm sea and the next we were riding waves 
seldom seen even in the worst hurricanes," says Captain Stefan Klashna of the 
freighter Sparta.

He says his ship shot straight up and then dropped like a stone.

"It was really frightening, like being on a malfunctioning elevator," Captain 
Klashna says. A Portuguese ship was badly damaged after being hit by a 
misfired beam from the battling UFOs.

"Metal melted and flowed on the deck like thick syrup," says Agusto Fuentes, 
the ship's first mate.

100-FOOT WAVES

The battles took place in March 1993, when 100-foot waves battered the east 
coast from Rhode Island to Labrador. The violent northeaste has been dubbed by 
weather experts as the Storm of the Century.

Waves produced by even the strongest of hurricanes seldom reach 70 feet, 
according to meteorologists.
