"73% of scientists believe in UFOs!"

"An incredible 73% of top scientist polled now believe in UFOs-and more
than half want the government to fund investigations into them.
Not only that, but a startling 52% of these scientists are convinced
that they had seen UFOs themselves. 'We tend to think of scientists as
being skeptical, but I think this poll disproves that,' said French UFO
expert Claude LaVoure.
'Intelligent scientists are now accepting the probability that UFOs do
exist.' Of the 1,200 scientists who took part in the university survey,
92% had master's degrees or higher. 'We ran a similar poll in 1981 and
it seemed a good idea to see how attitudes towards UFOs have changed
since then,' explained LaVoure. 'What is most striking is the high
number-7 out of 10-who at least think UFOs probably do exist. 'And only
4% of the scientists are prepared to answer 'definitely not' to the
question of whether UFOs actually exist. That result is identical to
what we had in 1981.' In the latest survey, 27 percent said they
'definitely' believe in UFOs, 46%  said they 'probably' believe, 12%
said they were 'undecided' and 11% said UFOs 'probably did not' exist.
The remaining scientists said 'definitely not.' According to the poll,
36% said they know of someone who claims to have seen a UFO."
