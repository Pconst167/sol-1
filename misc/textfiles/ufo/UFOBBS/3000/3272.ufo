   Reports of UFO sightings or abductions are numerous; evidence to
support the claims scarce.

   Here is one case study:

   Debbie Jordan of Kokomo was the subject of Intruders, a
best-selling book written in the mid-1980s by Budd Hopkins.

   Jordan, known only as "Kathie Davis" in the book, believes she
may have been abducted and even impregnated by aliens in the late
1970s.

   The book told a long story of memories lost and found through
hypnotic regression, and cited evidence of unusual, scorched earth
in Jordan's back yard when she lived in Indianapolis. There also
were claims of "positive blood and urinalysis tests," confirming
Jordan's impregnation, in the book.

Where's the paperwork?

   Yet, in a 1987 interview with The Indianapolis News, and again
in an interview earlier this week with The Star, author Hopkins
said it was Jordan herself who made the claims of proof of
pregnancy, and conceded that he did not actually have the
documentation nor had he seen it.

   (Jordan has said that she also does not have the documentation
in hand - her doctor had it but didn't want to get involved, she
said.)

   Furthermore, a soil analysis of ground taken from Jordan's back
yard, purporting to show that it could no longer hold water, itself
does not hold water. (Claims that soil cannot hold water are fairly
common in UFO landing cases.)

   Vernon Grebe of Mobay Chemical Corp. in Baltimore, who did the
soil analysis, told The News in 1987 that the sample he examined
did hold water and said he duly reported this fact to his superiors.
Family ties

   This finding was excluded from the lab report reprinted in the
book, however. Grebe did find that the soil sample was low in
nitrogen compared to a control sample, but what this would prove is
unclear.

   Additionally, Grebe said (and Hopkins confirmed) that the
Baltimore lab was run by a relative of Hopkins, a man married to
his niece.

   Hopkins said the lab report he reprinted in his book was the
only one he ever saw. "I wasn't dealing with Grebe," he said.
Furthermore, said Hopkins, when he tested the soil sample himself,
it did not dissolve in water.

   Hopkins also said he turned to the Baltimore lab, not because
of the family connection but because he knew no one else with the
expertise to perform the soil analysis.

   He added that any legitimate party with access to a lab can
test his soil samples if they wish.
