A source reports that elements of the US government are preparing
a mixed military operation, to take place in late spring or early
summer of 1993, against an underground alien base in the
southwestern US. The reported purpose of this operation is to
obtain alien technology, and perhaps information about alien
plans and intentions.  Although carefully planned over the last
two years, the source believes that it will fail, perhaps with
disastrous consequences. The source reports that there have been
previous assaults on lesser alien assets with mixed results, but
that the target of this reconnaissance assault is well-protected
and a vital alien asset.  Because of the way this operation is to
be conducted, the source expects that it will yield little new
information.  The effects of this attack upon alien behavior and
intentions are unpredictable.  The source believes that short of
White House intervention, nothing can stop this ill-advised
venture.

The planners are also preparing various cover stories and
disinformation efforts, depending on how the mission turns out.
This planning seems to involve two organizations. One is Psi
Tech, ostensibly a "remote viewing" consulting group, that
actually performs an intelligence-gathering role in support of
this mission.  The second is CSETI, a private group of UFO
investigators led by Dr. Stephen Greer, who it appears are being
prepared to be innocent propagators of the cover story the
government decides to issue.  CSETI is noted for exchanging
flashlight signals with UFOs on several occasions.  There is some
reason to believe, according to this source, that some or all of
their UFO encounters have actually been staged by the US
government.

The source also reports that President Clinton has thus far
received only a perfunctory briefing on activity involving aliens
buried amidst a general briefing on a number of military
matters.  It is reported that he was somewhat surprised and
disturbed, but also that he was assured that the military knows
what it is doing and has the situation under control, and he was
discouraged from asking questions about the subject.

The source reports that the briefing was deceptive, in that the
military does not know what it is doing and does not have the
situation under control.

It is possible that our new President may inherit a Bay of Pigs
fiasco of the alien kind, one that could have profound
consequences for humanity.
