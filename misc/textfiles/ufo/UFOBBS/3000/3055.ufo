                   HORSE-SAUCER MYSTERY GETS EVEN WEIRDER


        Alamosa, Colo. (AP)

        An autopsy on a horse, believed by its owner to have been killed by
        inhabitants of a flying saucer, has revealed that its abdominal,
        brain and spinal cavities were empty.

        The pathologist, a Denver specialist who wished to remain anonymous,
        said the absence of organs in the abdominal cavity was unexplainable.

        Witnessing the autopsy Sunday night at the ranch where the carcass
        was found were four members of the Denver team of the National
        Members Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

        The team included Dr. and Mrs. Ken Steinmetz, Dr. Herb Roth and
        Captain Dick Cable of the North American Air Defense Command Center
        in Colorado Springs.

        When the pathologist sawed into the horse's brain cavity, he found
        it empty.  "There definitely should have been a good bit of fluid in
        the brain cavity," the pathologist said.

        "This horse was definitely not killed by lightning," the pathologist
        said.  That was the official conclusion of Alamosa county authorities.

        The Appalcosa's owners said they believe the horse was killed by
        occupants of a flying saucer.  Several others in the San Luis Valley,
        where as many as eight sightings of unidentified flying objects have
        been reported in one evening recently, have said they agree.

                           -- DISPUTE --

        The controversy over Snippy, a 3-year-old gelding, began September 7
        when the horse did not return to the Harry King ranch.

        Two days later, King went looking for Snippy and found him dead about
        a quarter mile from the ranch house.  The ranch is 20 miles southeast
        of Alamosa in desolate mountain country.

        All the flesh had been stripped from the horse's neck and head and
        only bones remained.

        King called the owners of the horse, Mr. and Mrs. Burl Lewis, and
        together they investigated the area in which the horse had been killed.

                          -- HOLES --

        They said they found areas where the chico brush had been squashed
        to within 10 inches of the ground.  What appeared to them to be 15
        circular exhaust marks were found 100 yards from the horse.

        Another area was punched with six identical holes, each two inches
        wide and four inches deep, they said.

        The investigating committee Sunday measured markings on the ground
        and found the largest to be a circle 75 feet in diameter.  Several
        smaller areas where the chico brush had been flattened were 15 feet
        in diameter.

        The committee returned to Denver on Sunday night with several samples
        taken from the horse and an object, presumed to be a tool, Mrs. Lewis
        said she found September 16.

        Mrs. Lewis said she found the object on her second visit to the site.
        It was covered with horse hair and she said when she tried to wipe
        the hair off, her hand turned red and began to burn.  The burning
        persisted until she washed her hands, she said.

        The Denver pathologist remained at the King Ranch Sunday night.  While
        there, the group stood on the ranch-house porch and watched two
        unidentified flying objects pass over the house, King said.
