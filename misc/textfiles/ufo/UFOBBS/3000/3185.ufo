          Circles of Note: Bibliography on the Crop Circles
         Updated June 9, 1991

                        Michael Chorost

     Bibliographies always look rather dry.  However, a careful reader
can learn much from this one, since many of the entries have parentheti-
cal summaries attached to them.  Also, a close look at the topics will
reveal the diversity of the crop circles phenomenon and the responses it
has gathered.  Finally, the sections on books, magazines, and studies
include price and ordering information, where known.

     I should note two sets of exclusions.  First, I have not indexed
articles from journals devoted to cerealogy.  Much of the best information
has been printed in their pages; back numbers can often be obtained by
writing to the editors.  Second, I have tended to include newspaper arti-
cles only of particular interest or informativeness, such as ones reporting
circles in detail, non-English circles, or noteworthy points of view.

     Inclusion in this bibliography does not imply endorsement.

     I am indebted to my contacts and colleagues in England, Canada,
and the United States, who generously sent me many of the articles listed
here.  I would be grateful to receive any corrections and additions, which
will be included in future updates.  Contact me at:
