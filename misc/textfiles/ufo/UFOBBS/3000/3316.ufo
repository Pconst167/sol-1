COLORADO UNIVERSITY ENDS SAUCER STUDY BUT DOES NOT DISCLOSE RESULTS   
 
Field investigations of UFO reports by the U of Colorado research project were 
completed on schedule today, but findings won't be discussed until the final 
report is sent to the National Academy of Sciences in late September.  The U of 
Colorado undertook a $500,000 study of UFOs at USAF's request because critics 
accused USAF of failing to make a comprehensive, scientific investigation of 
saucer reports. 
 
In a related development, NICAP held a news conference yesterday to announce it 
has "broken with" the Colorado Project to "reveal the firing of top project 
scientists and other incidents leading to the project's failure.  "A May 14 
Look article by John G. Fuller told about the oustings last February of David 
R. Saunders, a psychologist, and Dr.  Norman E. Levine, an electrical engineer, 
and called the project the "flying saucer fiasco".  On the House floor 
yesterday, Representative J. Edward Roush quoted from the Look article and said 
Congress should take over the UFO investigation from USAF because grave doubts 
had arisen "as to the scientific profundity and objectivity of the Colorado 
project."
