1993 CROP CIRCLE REPORT BULLETIN
May 7, 1993


Crop circle activity has resumed in England.  Two formations have
been reported, one of which has been judged to be human-made by
some of the first investigators on the scene.

The following information has been provided by George Wingfield,
the leading circle researcher in England:

May 2: A 115-foot circle with seven grapeshot satellites on one
side and four satellites on the other was found in a wheat field
at Newton St. Loe near Bath.  The formation is marred by muddy
bootprints, and the wheat shows evidence of having been trampled
by foot.  Investigators conclude that humans made the formation.
The wheat is only about two feet high with no head, which in the
past has not been of sufficient height to support circles of
unknown origin.

May 3:  A 60-foot donut-shaped ring was found in oilseed rape at
Aston Rowant, Oxfordshire.  The crop is reported to be "perfectly
laid, bent not broken," swirled anticlockwise with an eight-foot
standing crop center.  The site is not far from a dumbbell found
in wheat last July.
