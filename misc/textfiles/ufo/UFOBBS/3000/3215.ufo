Excerpts from MUFON Journal, Clearing Ed Walters
        (author of Gulf Breeze Sightings)

"In order to keep this secret, they have obviously needed to
do some strange things.  For example, one guy who took some
seemingly pretty good photos of UFOs in Gulf Breeze,
Florida, was found to have apparently been hiding a model of
the EXACT craft in his attic (he sold his house and the new
residents found it).  Knell implies that the FBI visited
this man, stole construction material from him, crafted the
model, and planted it in the attic..."

   This from the MUFON Journal;

 "...In late December 1988, Ed Walters moved to a new home to
escape the attention of curiosity seekers. The residence he had
occupied at 612 Silverthorn Road was put up for sale. The home
remained vacant for 10 months, until it was purchased by Mr.
Robert E. Menzer. In March 1990, Menzer was trying to find a
shutoff valve on the water supply to his kitchen, so he could
hook up a new ice maker. This search led him into the attic,
where he found a UFO model under insulation and next to the
water line to the kitchen.
   On June 4, 1990, a Pensacola News Journal reporter, Craig
Myers, interviewed Menzer and asked a number of questions,
including: "Did you find any models of UFOs, anything like
that?" Menzer showed Myers the model, which Myers borrowed and
from which he published the story.

CONCLUSIONS ON MODEL

    Watson's [Gary Watson, MUFONs Chief Investigator for
Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties] investigation concluded the
model was not constructed before September 1989, at least 8.5
months after Walters had moved out of the home. Furthermore,
close examination of the model and Walters' photographs did not
show any exact match of markings, height/width ratios, etc.
Watson's final conclusion: 'The Model was built and planted by
persons unknown in an attempt to discredit Ed Walters.'"

  End excerpt.

The MUFON article goes into detial explaining how Watson
arrived at his findings. I'll briefly outline them here.

  Excerpts;

  "...The model was made out of plastic foam plates and a strip
of blueprint paper. The inside surface of the paper strip
suggests it was once a part of a plot plan for a home..."

  "..By his own admission, Ed Walters recognized the
hand-writing as being his own, suggesting the original
blueprint was from a home Walters had designed..."

  "...September 6-7, 1989:  Walters designs a custom home for
Mr. and Mrs. Lynn C Thomas....The home is to have 1740 sq. ft.
of living area, with a 2393 sq. ft. slab..."

   [These are the measurements readable from the strip of paper
from the model]

  The home was never built. Walters discards the house plans in
September 1989, 8.5 months after moving out of the home where
the model was found.

Of course, Ed could have built the model and placed it in the
vacant house, but why?

Wrong text file... Shoot...

I don't seem to have saved away the text with the proof -against- Ed Walters on
it. This one is the excerpts that MUFON used to help clear Walters after two of
their top researchers uncovered the hoax.

The researchers were later fired.

Among the report the researchers later made evident displaced the evidence
against the strip as being of an older house plan with the same dimensions
(they were common dimensions).

They were also quoted as saying: "We just said the wrong thing, MUFON has put
too much into this Walter's thing."

They also uncovered a teen photo expert in the area who said he helped Walter's
fake the photos.

The later, 'official', report posted above appears to be combatting 'selective'
evidence.
