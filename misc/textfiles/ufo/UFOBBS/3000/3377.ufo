Hundreds of eyewitnesses watched in fear and awe as space ships hovered over 
the French city of LYons a thousand years ago, according to historical records 
and written accounts.

Alien pilots even landed and gave tours of their home planet and bases to 
volunteers, calims Andrew Tomas, author of more than 60 books on UFOs and 
ancient astronauts.

Citing written accounts from before the time of Christ, Tomas, 89, syas the 
aliens were from ancient secret bases in China, Tibet and India.

Apperance of the UFOs was preceded by freak weather patterns in the eighth and 
ninth centuries, where storms and hail destroyed crops in France and other 
parts of Europe.

People also noticed mysterious flying objects in the sky.

SPIRITS OF AIR

These objects, declared charlemagne, emperor of France and much of Europe, 
were evil "spirits of the air" an respondsible for the bad weather.

But some educated men, including Zedechias, a Jewish mystic, and Agobard, the 
archbishop of Lyons, apparently knew the objects in the sky were not evil 
spirits but "immorals" known to an inner circle for more than a thousand 
years. "Zedechias appealed to the 'Celestials' to make themselves visible so 
that they could demonstrate their peaceful and kind intentions," Tomas says.

A number of "wonderfully constructed aerial ships" appeared over Lyons between 
830 and 833.

Thsi scared a lot of people who believed the ships were evil spirits as 
Charlemagne had said.

"To offset the alarm and prejudice against them," says Tomas, "the 
'Celestials' landed their cloud ships' and took volunteers on flights to their 
distant land and to explain their customs."

However, when volunteers returned, superstitious peasants, incited by priests 
and others, tortured and killed them.

Archbishop Agobard rescued four volunteers by convincing a frenzied mob they 
had imagined what they claimed to have seen.

After their release into his custody, Agobard questioned them and wrote of 
their air flight and "other marvels" they'd seen.

TORTURED

"They claim there is a region called Magonia whence ships came in the clouds," 
wrote the archbishop, later canonized a saint by the Catholic Church Magonia, 
Tomas believes, was on of three UFO bases known to certain mystics for more 
than a thousand years.

One of these, according to Chinese legend, was located in the "lofty Kun Lun 
mountains and tis hidden valley," he explains.

"It was the abode of immortals who flew from their secret sanctuary to the 
stars."
