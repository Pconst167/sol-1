This one is WILD!!   (i'm not yet 100% sure of it's accuracy though)

From: Intercepts Newsletter (Dec/Jan 92-93)

The following transmission was made in the clear (unscrambled)
Frequency: 6.812 MHz USB (Mystic Star)
Time: 2310 Zulu
Date: 12-10-92

(Note: Mystic Star is a worldwide network used by USAF aircraft
transporting heads-of-state, military VIPs, and it is also used by
Air Force One.)

A general placed a phone-patch from SAM (Special Air Mission) 204
through Andrews, AFB to "AF public relations".  Aurora was discussed.
The general quoted an article in the "Post" as well as the previous
article in "Jane's".

The general said "It is almost laughable the number of hokey inputs
they had - it's kind of similar to the UFO flap.  We need to develop
a release in response to inquiries.  The guts of this should be that
we've looked at the technical aspects of the sightings and what the
logical answers for them are.  You can quote Dr. Mori and site the
Lincoln lab physics and the FAA's efforts to debunk other incidents.
Most of the sightings were accounted for in a Q&A yesterday in a
media available press release.  Go through three or four of the
sightings, take each one on and conclude with a paragraph that
says the fantasy of Aurora doesn't exist."

They went on to discuss the sighting in the North Sea from an oil
drilling platform.  "Someone saw something accompanied by three
F-111s.  The secretary wants us to talk with McMann and say it was
an F-117.  I'll get together with Alex - write up a memo to the
Chief or the Secretary".
