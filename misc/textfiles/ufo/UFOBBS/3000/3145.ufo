Topic: The issue of linkage re: Wackenhut/Black Helicopters/UFOs   
 
Greetings to Everyone-
   There has been some discussion as to the viablity of the linkage
between the illustrious black helicopters and the general subject of
UFO's.  At this time I would like to make a clarification statement.
   My recent posts re: Wackenhut and the Black Helicopters. These relate
directly to several MUFON recognized incidents here in northern Calif-
ornia.  Last spring, residents outside of a small Sierra foothill
community called Georgetown were seeing what they felt were UFO's
very close in their neighborhood.  One gentleman was interviewed on the
local CBS affilitate and showed the black helicopters circling his home
up there.  He stated on camera that they had been doing it quite a bit
since he had taken videos of the ships.  He also stated on camera
that his home had be burglarized two times since the events.  MUFON
field rep Mike Mace, who is a member of the Sacramento UFO Group told 
me that there had been reports of what appeared to be reptoids on the
ground and that whoever was investigating up there had sealed off the 
area.  These folks were dressed in military type uniforms and were 
wearing night vision gear.
    During the summer, while working up in Yuba City (which is about 40
miles north of Sacramento), one of my co-workers had been out exploring
the back country to the west of Stoney Ford (a long lake that is in a 
slender valley that runs parallel to the Sacramento Valley to the west of
us.  He and his son had taken their dirt bikes up to Goat Mountain, which
is about 40 miles west of a small town by Stoney Ford called Lagoda (sp).
Up there he found an abandoned ICBM base (Minuteman I, circa 1964) and a
strange little military base on an adjoining peak (about 1/2 mile away).
This all occurred about the time that the Phoenix stuff hit this echo and
it piqued my curiousity.
    In late summer, Mike Mace told me that MUFON had been getting reports
of horse and cattle mutilations from the northern end of the Napa Valley 
and that a similar scenerio that occurred at Georgetown was happening there
also.  The area was sealed off and military types were combing the area.
The black helicopters were associated with these events also.  Very short-
ly thereafter, due to attention being drawn to these events by local farmers,
Harry Martin of the Napa Sentinel did a series on these occurances, including
information that he had gleened from his own personal sources as to who
they were and what they were up to.
    In addition, MUFON was getting reports from suction dredge miners on 
the Consumnes River about 7 miles east of a very small town called Fair
Play (which is about 15-20 miles SE of Placerville).  They stated that 
craft would come into the canyon and slowly move close to the canyon wall.
What they described then is very strange.  They said that the craft appeared
to fade and then get sucked into the side of the canyon wall.  There have
also been reports of the occupants being on the ground in the area.
   In my initial discussion with Harry Martin, he stated that the folks
from Wackenhut were the ones that were flying the black helicopters and 
that for some reason they were building underground facilities.  He also
stated that they were doing this all over the country.  Only once during our
discussion did the subject of UFO's come up.  I had not mentioned it at all,
but he did volunteer the statement that "Wackenhut has had saucers for
years."
   SUFOG has ongoing investigations into all of the above cases independent
of MUFON.  We are strictly a volunteer group and do not have any official
links to them, however we openly share information (which is our primary
objective).  I am very much of the opinion that if we work together, we can
piece together this mystery.
