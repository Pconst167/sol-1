From the Antimatter section, UFO Update:  Can UFO researchers prove that
aliens are tagging and tracking humans with tiny devices in the body or
brain?

"But how can anyone know whether a reputed implant is real or not?  How, some
UFO investigators have begun to wonder, can they authenticate an implant
should a sample emerge?"

Here's what a few had to say on that subject:

"One person addressing this issue is David Pritchard, a physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  According to Pritchard, no matter how
strange the structure or material of an alleged implant, if it is not some
'out of this world' material like 'heavy metals or quark matter' it won't be
possible to convince a lot of people.  But, Pritchard adds, there are other
ways to skin the cat.  For example, researchers could peg an insert as such
if it worked like a flashlight but was a hundred times brighter than any
flashlight on Earth.  If the implant sent complex but unrecognizable signals,
he says, 'that would be pretty convincing as well.'  Finally, Pritchard
believes, evidence would mount if investigators found the exact same type of
implant in numerous people making abduction claims."

"The technique [MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging] was tapped by reputed
abductee Whitley Strieber, who says he remembers the insertion of needles in
his head.  His MRI brain scans, he adds, now show strange white spots.  'Are
the unknown objects in my brain an outcome of such intrusions?' Strieber
asked in his recent book, Transformation.  Pritchard says the dots prove
nothing:  they could be air bubbles.  But a statistical argument could be
made he adds, if researchers can show that professed UFO abductees have
significantly more dots than a random control group."

"...UFO skeptic Phil Klass, who doesn't believe that aliens have ever come to
Earth, takes a different tack.  First, he says, he would want to know 'where
the implant came from,' and would feel more confident if it had been removed
by a surgeon.  Then, if it were something 'that could not form naturally in
the body,' he would want to know it if could be made with terrestrial
technology.  If the answer to that is no, says Klass, 'I think you have your
proof.'"

"...Robert Sheaffer, author of The UFO Verdict, who says the whole question
of UFO abductions is dubious and that the idea of alien implants is
'certainly rubbish.'  According to Sheaffer, the UFO is a slippery phenomenon
that always manages to fade away before the evidence becomes too convincing,
and alien implants are an example of this.  'Some people might be saying they
were kidnapped by aliens for the money,' says Sheaffer.  'Others might be
doing it because they really believe that they were abducted.  But there is
not a shred of evidence to substantiate this claim.  Alien implants are just
too good to be true.'"

"According to UFO abduction expert Budd Hopkins... a number of radiologists
are privately doing MRI scans on people who claim they have been abducted by
aliens -- and that the aliens have inserted devices in their bodies or
brains.  But a neurosurgeon advised him that if, as claimed, implants exist
somewhere above the upper nasal passages, then they are near the optic nerve.

In that case, he says, 'it would be very risky for a surgeon to try to get
one out.'  What does Hopkins say about the prospect of actually validating
these weird alien implants?  'It'd have devastating societal impact,' he
says.  'I am not looking forward to something like this.'"

Taken from UFO MAGAZINE Vol 2, No 2 1987

APRIL 1985.  "I've never committed this account to writing
until now, since it has always seemed very 'personal' to me.
But before another decade passes I suppose I should enter it
into the record."  Peter Gutilla, metaphysical teacher,
researcher and psychic in southern California, thus begins his
moving account of an encounter that portends some sort of
return visit-by hidden observers who seem to have quite a
lofty bag-of tricks!

      "It was near 1 a.m. on the morning of April 15, 1975.
After a meeting in Los Angles, I was driving home alone of the
Santa Ana Freeway, heading southeast in a small, dark blue,
1959 Mercedes coupe.  The sky was clear and the weather
moderate.  A few miles past the L.A. interchange, I'd just lit
a small cigar a friend had given me when a very clear voice
popped into my head, saying: "Is that a weapon?"

      "Before I go on, I should emphasize that after years of
working with psychics, not to mention my own ESP experience
since childhood, my reaction to things inward had become more
than a little casual.  So I replied in a perfunctory way, 'No,
this isn't a weapon' and then went on to describe the act of
smoking, ending with: 'Who wants to know?'"

      "Immediately I looked to the southwest sky on my right,
out the front windshield.  There, at about a 50-degree angle
and moving with me at what seemed to be the same speed, was a
ruby-red light traveling in an up/down, wave-like motion.
(Mentally I can 'see' that light in my mind as vividly as when
I saw it that day.)  I 'knew' it was a UFO - not an airplane
or helicopter with a running red light, even though I was
unable to distinguish an outline that would indicate a solid
object."

      "Intrigued, I asked: ' Are you following me?'  The
answer came, 'yes.' I slowed to the right lane of the freeway
and the light slowed immediately, doing this several more
times as I repeated the maneuver to see if it would follow my
lead.  Although I was calm at this point, I felt a growing
anticipation which prompted me to urge the light to stay with
me since I planned to exit the freeway a few miles ahead."

      "The light remained steady in brightness and continued
its wavy flight alongside my car, seeming to slow down and
follow my turn as I left the freeway at Valley View Street in
La Mirada."

      "I drove into an abandoned filling station (closed,
windows boarded) and parked.  Now I could vaguely discern an
oblate, circular shape surrounding the light, which had
stopped a few hundred feet above a huge industrial lot, across
the street from me to the south.  The area directly below the
object was completely dark with no cars anywhere around except
some sparse traffic on the freeway behind me."

      "The irony of it was that to the object's right and
below was a restaurant packed with people, their only view
outside being a large window facing the freeway, in the
opposite direction from the hovering object.  I remember
thinking, 'If they only knew what's hanging over their
heads!'"

      "Stepping out of the car, I stood facing the completely
silent object.  I waved my arms several times and the red
light blinking correspondingly, convincing me all the more
that it was indeed focusing its attention on me, and
coincidentally in the same place at the same time."

      "I repeated the mental message: 'What do you want?'
Here an odd thing happened.  For a quick moment I felt myself
'switch' to the object, and that's the only way I can describe
it - a switching of positions.  In the space of a few seconds,
I was inside the object looking out of a bubble-like window at
myself standing near my car!  There was no physical sensation
whatsoever, and I can only compare it to an out-of body
experience - but one that was clear and obvious - nothing
dream-like or imaginary about it.  Following this, the object
swayed back and forth several times in a kind of pendulum
motion, still soundless and in the same  position.  Here, I
remember taking notice of a 'buzzing' sound in my head which
had increased in intensity, to the point of distraction.  I'd
heard this sound before over the years, but never quite as
intense."

      "I glanced at my watch.  About 15 minutes had elapsed
from the time I'd left the freeway.  Mentally, I said 'I'd
like to see your craft.  Can you turn more lights on?'
Instantly port and starboard lights blinked on momentarily,
lighting up the entire body of the object.  The lights blinked
on and off for only a few seconds, but it gave me enough time
to see its disc shape, and that it was grayish in color and
maybe 45-50 feet in diameter."

      "With the blinking lights off, the red light glowed
steadily, swaying from side to side.  Only a minute or so had
passed when I heard the noisy clatter of what I assumed to be
a police helicopter approaching from the west, shining its
intense spotlight to the ground intermittently.  I said to
myself, 'Oh no - they're going to meet head on and I don't
have a camera!'  As the helicopter approached, I thought for
sure it was going to hit the object, but strangely, the
aircraft passed very near the UFO, apparently unaware of its
presence!"

      "The helicopter flew in a broad circle slightly south of
the UFO, shining it's spotlight to the ground and seemingly
taking no notice of the object whatsoever.  As the helicopter
wandered about, gradually fading in the distance, I couldn't
help but wonder if somehow the UFO occupants were able to
selectively choose who saw them."

      "I got back into my car, driving around the corner and
into an industrial lot.  The object pivoted slowly as if to
keep itself oriented to my change of position, a move I could
see clearly as I entered the darkened area.  I stepped from
the car and sent the thought: 'Can you land?  I'd like to meet
with you.'  A few seconds passed and the answer came, 'No, we
cannot - we are being watched... we will be back'"

      "I recall being both disappointed and confused.  Being
watched?  Maybe it was risky for them to come in low over
populated areas.  But why hadn't the helicopter seen them?
Being watched by whom?  Their own people?  Were others
watching from the ground, or could they have been referring to
radar, etc?  At any rate, the object seemed to shrink in size
to a star-like pinpoint of bluish light.  It moved westward in
the direction of the Pacific and was gone."

      "Over 10 years have passed since the incident, and not a
day has gone by that I haven't thought about it.  It has never
left me.  Although it all took place in a brief span of time,
I know something significant happened; something simple and
profound."

      "Since then, I haven't looked at the nighttime sky
without thinking I can hear a faint humming sound that
invariably brings to mind those parting words, '...we will be
back.'"

The following was taken from UFO Magazine Vol 2 No 4 - 1987
--------

        What do ET abductors want?  It's been suggested that to
insure species survival, they're inbreeding genes of emotional,
self-willed, individuated Earth humans into their own excessively
mental, regimented race-but perhaps that's projection.  What are
we learning?  Self-reflectiveness, perhaps-a keener idea of just
who we are?  Alicia Montell's testimony implies just such an
outcome.

    "Was I ever abducted? I mused over this question as I put
down a book I'd been reading, describing a person who through
hypnosis discovered having had an encounter with aliens at an
earlier time in his life."

    "I've never doubted that extraterrestrials exist.  I have
always accepted as fact that we are only a small but
not-so-forgotten planet out here on the fringes of the Milky Way,
and are visited quite often by a variety of travelers.  How could
anyone possibly ; think that we are the ONLY living, evolving,
experiencing creatures?"

    "My husband Bernt and I have read with great interest all the
stories we could lay our hands on, but at times had to smile-we
clearly saw that people's fear often created a lot of problems
for them.  If instead they had been able to keep cool and
cooperate with the aliens, their stories would have been quite
different.  They could have had encounters filled with awe and
understanding of those beings who impinged so forcefully upon
their lives."

    "Our seeming inability to identify with the fear in abductees
was somewhat altered by an explanation from our discarnate
friend, 'Arthur."  he told us, 'Your race deeply believes anyone
entering from outside this planet cannot possibly look like us;
they MUST look different, they MUST be feared.  You cannot see
these beings for what they really are.  When confronted, a shield
automatically blinds your vision and distorts anything or anybody
that does not belong on the planet... they most likely are very
much like yourself'

    'Arthur' went on to describe my inner travels and how I had
met many strange races outside Earth planet's confines. 'Remember
what happened when she met reaces similar to her own?  She got
very upset, could not at first visualize their features, because
it was difficult to accept that others existing out there could
possibly look like her own race back on earth.  Even in that free
a mental state, the race concept remained...'

    "Now I begin to wonder if I might find fear taking over
simply because the body reacts naturally, should I someday stand
in front of an alien.  Anyway, I think I am ready to put it to
the test!"

                        *  *  *

    "After reading the story about abduction, I began to think
seriously about examining my own childhood, to investigate a
little 'blank spot' I run across when I've reviewed my childhood
in order to better understand the roots of my beliefs.  How can I
describe it?  I sense a small spot in time that I purposely
forget when I try to visualize a childhood scene.  Sometimes I
thought it could be a molestation, completely buried yet
affecting my personal attitudes.  But never, never until this
moment did I associate it with extraterrestrials."

    "I underwent hypnosis.  The usual commands were given to
place me in a deep trance, Bernt suggesting I move to a time in
my childhood where something out of the ordinary had happened, to
become that child and perceive all clearly, to answer any and all
questions..."

    "I find myself going back.  the picture I get is weaving in
and out... I feel small, perhaps five years old.  I am playing in
the dirt next to the driveway...I can feel the heat on my back
and the soft, powdery dirt in my hands...something makes me look
up."

    "I see two small men standing right in front of me.  They are
about a head taller than I, very slim with stick-like arms and
legs with large, dark eyes and dressed in a mottled green
garment.  Fear begins to rise, but in that very moment everything
becomes completely silent and I can no longer feel the heat."

    "The birds aren't singing and my fear is gone.  I am in a
trance-like state.  They must have hypnotized me so I wouldn't
scream and run away.  They each take a hand and lead me along the
driveway.  I walk in a daze.  As we near the end of the drive,
the whole area seems filled with a huge, bulky, silver-gray ship.
Its rim is far above my head.  They lead me up a 'moving walk'
and we enter a large, round area-sort of an entry hall with doors
all around and a dome-shaped ceiling.  We go through a door and
down a short tunnel, enter a room with a row of chairs along one
wall.  The opposite wall is full of blinking lights and small
glowing glass frames."

    "The two small men turn me toward a little old man sitting in
a very elaborate chair.  His eyes are not too different from my
own.  Perhaps the two who brought me in were wearing sunglasses?
That would explain the large, dark and slanted eyes that caught
my attention at first."

    "The old man takes my hands in his, and as he does, I can
hear again.  he is pale and full of wrinkles, and has a white
beard neatly-trimmed to a thin edge from ear to ear.  He looks
like a leprechaun!  The ears stand out a bit from his head and
are slightly pointed.  He say something I don't understand and
as he does a bunch of small 'cubes' start to tumble into my mind,
where they get neatly stacked up...they don't hurt me, but as
they enter my mind I become terrified.  Instantly a curtain is
lowered.  I am again blank and standing in a soundless state."

    "Our discarnate friend Arthur clarified things later.  He
said the cubes are related to the mind only, that thee are ways
of depositing ideas into the mind. 'Perhaps she can touch them
mentally ; and get a slight understanding of what they contain,'
he said, 'The ideas contained in the cubes are so overwhelming
that there is no way she can encompass the whole message.  But
she is getting the feeling of it and it is a little
frightening...Alicia is being prepared for a physical
confrontation.  It could be very traumatic unless conditioning
has taken place over a period of years.

    "Her early encounter took place physically at the time and
space she described, and even though her recall projects a
physical picture, the incident was equally a mental experience.
The cubes are implanted in order to condition and encourage a
specific person to strive in a specific direction, because a race
on its own is very grounded in the planet's vibration is
therefore not prepared to confront any alien intrusion.'

    You are almost suggesting that we are really never alone of
this planet of ours, 'I interjected. 'No, you are not.  You are
being watched, used, manipulated-but that is the nature of
things,' Arthur responded. 'There are always interactions, a need
and wish to assist others, to make transitions easier..the
seeds are planted to help you.  Without them, you would not
develop or dream.'

    "We are so used to translating things into purely physical
terms.  We grant acceptance to the physical props we have around
us, but is it all right to accept our visions and beliefs in
whatever form we clothe them?  And once we stop laughing at it or
calling it just imagination-UFO sightings and all the
rest-perhaps then we can accept.  Perhaps a lot of these things,
even more that we are currently willing to accept, are our sudden
shifts of awareness and vision."

FROM UFO MAGAZINE Vol 3, No 2 1988

You won't necessarily find Mike Bershad nor many like him aboard
the bandwagon that salutes benevolent ETs and broadcasts a
hopeful message about their mission on earth.  Mike is "in touch"
with another form of entity, and if "they" have any mission, it's
an urgent, overriding necessity to plunder human anatomy with
speed and calculation.

The lives of many abductees distill abruptly into issues of
emotional survival.  Few are blithe and unaffected by their
ordeals in the netherworld, though an individual trauma can be
offset by the catharsis of "going public"

Abduction has not yet broken free of its identification with myth
and hallucination, but the time approaches.  For the time being,
Mike is content with partial memory.

---

    "This is the first time I've written about my abduction
experience, although I've been written about (see Budd Hopkins'
Missing time')  My name is not Steve Kilburn (the alias used in
the book) but Michael Bershad."

    "Many people have told me that they'd love to meet an alien
or be taken for a ride in a flying saucer.  My viewpoint is
somewhat different."

   "The most terrifying thing I've ever encountered was looking
into the eyes of one of these 'creatures.' To describe their eyes
as black, shiny and oval simply doesn't do them justice.  it's
true that the eyes lacked an iris, pupils, eyelids, eyelashes.
But there was more.  I sensed no emotion, no feeling, no
humanity, and consequently, no exchange of any understanding
whatsoever."

    "If anyone thinks that an abduction experience is
enlightening or fun, think again.  I was totally powerless, and
was made to comply with whatever they wanted me to do.  My
slightest thought was monitored, and I was accorded no more
respect than a laboratory rat.  An examination of my body was
made, and I now understand how a frog in a classroom of biology
students must feel.  But the sheer terror came from the
uncertainty of what was to come.  Would my heart be removed?
Would they pull off a leg, just to see what would happen?  I had
no way of knowing and they dealt with my questions the way most
adults handle children, by humoring me with idiotic platitudes or
simply by ignoring me altogether.  It's true that I was not
physically harmed, but I continue to bear the emotional trauma of
this experience even today, many years later."

    "I do not know that the creatures I saw were 'aliens' or that
the object I was taken into was a flying saucer.  I simply know
what I perceived, from the memory of my hypnotic regressions.  The
creatures were most assuredly foreign to me; where they were from,
I had no idea.  The object I was walked into seemed disc-shaped,
yet I had no way of knowing if it could fly.  These aren't mere
semantic quibbles; if any truth is to be ascertained from
abductees' stories, the abductees better stick to what they
actually experienced and leave 'conclusions' and speculation to
the investigators and science fiction writers.  Somebody has to
bear the responsibility for telling the truth as objectively as
possible, and it might as well be those who have had 'the
experience' itself.  It's hard enough dealing with the abduction;
adding bells and whistles only clouds an already muddled issue."

    "I have never claimed with 100 percent certainty that my
hypnotic memory of events is what actually happened to me.  But
that presents some problems for me, personally."

    "- When I recounted my story to my parents, I expected them to
be incredulous.  Quite the contrary.  They reminded me of a UFO
sighting I told them I had at the approximate time and place of my
abduction experience.  I was amazed, as I had no recollection of
this at all.  They found that strange!"

    "- A licensed polygraph administrator concluded that my test
results proved that I hadn't made up the story."

    "- A highly reputable neurosurgeon told me, after several hours
of consultation and examination in his hospital office, that a
science 'greater than our own' had examined my body.  He also
informed me that he had tried to trick me concerning the medical
examination that the creatures performed upon me; I was steadfast
in my recollections when he questioned me and this upset him.
Incidentally, he didn't believe in UFOs."

    "- The psychologists I dealt with were not convinced that UFO
beings carried me off.  They were convinced that something external
left an extraordinary impression on me.  In other words, it wasn't
my vivid imagination, as I would have preferred to believe!."

    "Some time after my hypnotic sessions were over, I had an
experience that bears repeating.  My wife and I were at a business
party in Southampton, N.Y.  It was a beautiful summer night, and
electric terrace lanterns illuminated the patio and house.  After
an hour or so, the lights suddenly went out.  We noticed the
neighbors also were without lights.  Most everyone loved the idea,
and candles were brought out to enliven the festive atmosphere."

    "I suddenly grew panicky, very nervous, and headed for a fence
at the perimeter of the yard.  I became nearly incoherent, mumbling
wild things to myself like 'they're coming back for me...they know
I've talked..' etc.

    "I know exactly where to look.  Up and off in a distance,
perhaps a mile away, a huge, glowing ball of light hung above the
tree line.  Fortunately my wife followed me and she, too, saw the
light.  To prove to myself that I wasn't crazy, I insisted that she
tell me exactly what she saw, and she told me she saw exactly what
I did.  The light slowly dipped behind the trees, and moments later
the electricity came on again."

    "Did the light have anything to do with the blackout?  I have
no way of knowing.  No one else at the party was drawn to the edge
of the yard, or even saw the light, as far as I know.  And my wife
implored me to 'keep it quiet,' as these were business clients of
hers."

    "Part of me doesn't want to believe that I was abducted and
examined by 'aliens'.  but as farfetched as this hypothesis seems,
it's more logical than any of the other explanations I've heard.
I'm well educated, and I'm aware of what whether balloons and
satellites look like;  I've also never involved myself with alcohol
or drugs.  And sadly, I no longer believe in the Easter Bunny or
Santa Claus."

    "But before I die, I pray that I get the answer to this one
question: What exactly happened to me that night on Route 40?"

------------------------------------------------------------------



TAKEN FROM UFO MAGAZINE VOL 4 # 3

In Vol. 4, No. 1 of UFO, columnist Ron Quinn told of his
friend
Sam, who claims he came upon and photographed a UFO alien
while
hiking in the Arizona desert.  Quinn was able to take a look
the
phone and was impressed enough to make some sketches based on
what he saw.

The photo-inspired drawing immediately caught the attention of
William Curtis, a retired gentleman living in Michigan.
Curtis
insists he's seen the same alien.  He went through an
elaborate
abduction, he says, during the course of which he got to see
the
'same being' up close.

Curtis speaks in a measured baritone voice that sounds like
the
late 'Duke' Wayne.  After seeing Quinn's story and
accompanying
sketches he called to tell us what happened to him, spending a
great deal of time in pensive recollection. 'You can't rush
this
thing,' he said.

At one point, Curtis labored to describe the alien's physical
characteristics in painstaking detail.  Not the regulation
large
headed, dark-eyed, assembly line 'greys,' in fact, according
to
Curtis this humanoid creature's penetrating eyes had pupils,
for
one thing.

The following is the witness' best recall of the UFO incident:

    "Now this little being that Sam drew, and was seen by Ron
Quinn-it's the first time I've seen a sure likeness of an
alien being.  There are a few differences from what I saw, but
the man is telling the absolute truth."

     "The reason I'm telling you this is because you can reach
the public.  Every word I say is the truth.  I've been to some
researchers; they knew I was telling the truth.  They wanted
me to come back for more hypnosis sessions.  But, nah, I
didn't.  I had too many other things on my mind.  My story
just sounds too fantastic.  I've talked to people who're
supposed to know that 'they' are here, who've seen them, and
even they have a hard time believing me. Sometimes a
psychologist can be the poorest person in the world to talk
to, especially the younger ones just out of school.  They
think you're crazy!  They may be very highly intelligent
people, but they don't have the experience."

     "I had a recollection in December of 1987 of an abduction
that took place in September of 1974.  I went to see a doctor
that month because I had all the symptoms of leukemia and
funny scars all over my back--scoop marks and everything.  The
doctors thought I had cancer, but they found out I had nothing
wrong.  I was cured in a few days, by myself.  The doctors
couldn't understand why I was cured so fast."

     "This is my recollection; it started out when I was in my
bedroom and suddenly found myself floating.  My left arm was
extended and there were these little beings in front of me,
but it was just an outline, kin of a grey-white blob.
Everything was misty.  I was laughing.  I was in a very jovial
mood."

     "It was more than a dream; in a dream you lie down and
see the abstract from the dream.  But I was a part of this.  I
got up; I seemed to be moving upwards.  I looked around and
there seemed to be faces around, 14 or 15 faces.  They were
about a dozen feet away.  I could see them very clearly and
started to get suspicious."

     "My emotions just turned from being jolly and everything,
to being really angry.  This emotional change happened in a
very short time - just boom, boom, boom like that.  I thought
to myself, 'remember you are not yourself.' I tried to reach
out to this one little individual and grab it by its neck, and
the next thing I know, I can barely ; move my arm, hands and
fingers.  I wasn't able to touch anything.  Something drifted
up or walked up to my right.  I turned and looked into this
face with black, slanted-up eyes and blue-grey complexion."

     "He had this frown on his face - I could see those black
eyes just boring into me, and it made me helpless, even more
so than I was.  The women - I say this because of a gut
feeling, and their size in comparison to the others - I call
them nurses, and they stand right next to me and are looking
at me very intensely.  I just sensed they were women, I don't
know.  But here's how one abductee can relate to another.  You
know certain things, but you don't know why.  You just know
it.  Part of your brain knows it, like mental telepathy."

     "You know Whitley Strieber's picture on the cover of
Communion?  Similar to that, but Strieber's had a more
elongated face.  These individuals appear to have surgical
caps on their heads.  They had me on a table and I seemed to
go back and forth, back and forth.  They seemed to be pulling
on me, doing things to me, but there was no pain, you see.  I
was just helpless.  But there was a feeling they were
experimenting with me."

     "And in another part of my recollection, I am sitting on
a stool and some beings is 'constructing' me on a stainless
steel panel.  The stool was hard, I remember, and I had a hard
time breathing.  I complained, I guess.  The next thing I know
- and this is very vivid - I reached out my right hand and I
feel this cushion under me!  And all of a sudden I feel better
with him.  I was making faces at him.  I remember putting my
hands up to my ears and sticking my tongue out at him."

     "Remember, you're not yourself! I was just scorning them
 -'the hell with you' sort of thing.  But I had a gut feeling
that these beings were friendly, these little fellas.  I can't
explain why I know this.  Anyway, he opened his mouth and
wagged his little tongue and it's this teeny little tongue way
back inside of his mouth.  He had no jawbone, no jaw hinge.
All he could do is open his mouth which formed a circle, and
there seemed to be little ridges around his gums.  I looked
like a dark burgundy color in there.  But I made a face at him
and he made one back.  Isn't that funny?  But it's true!"

     "The next thing I knew, someone came into the room and
said. 'We've decided to take you back home.' And I often
think, I wonder what the other alternative was -!  After this,
I'm floating.  Not one time did I ever feel the floor under my
feet or did I ever feel any pain - nothing.  No sensation at
all, except for having a hard time breathing."

     "Two little individuals are in front of me and two behind
me.  One of them said, 'Do you remember this place?  This is
where you came in.'  I didn't know, but didn't want to tell
him that - I'm obstinate.  They laughed, - no, not laughed,
but I got the feeling they were amused.  They knew what I was
thinking."

     "Then we go into this circular hallway, on the outer edge
of the AFM - that's what I call it, 'alien flying machine'
AFM, not UFO.  Something opened up and I got this gulp of
fresh air.  And I started to get afraid.  I looked down and
saw this distorted room.  And he said, 'go ahead, jump off' I
wouldn't do it at first.  I believe they came up and touched
my arm.  One in back of me said, 'go ahead, you're safe' or
something like that."

     "When I feel, it felt like...have you ever been on a
roller-coaster?  That's what it felt like.  It took my breath
away.  But I was cushioned about two feed from the roof.  I
could see the distortion of the shingles.  And then something
picked me up, straightened me out and spun me around, and it
dropped me down right through the roof!  They laid me back on
the bed, grabbed my arms and pulled me up.  My arms are folded
over my chest and the quilt is tucked up neatly under my chin.
And I'm lying there as if I were in a casket!"

     "This is where the vividness came in.  A white light is
coming through the roof and this little being is going up this
light.  I heard a whirring sound, like a generator coming from
above.  This little being as he went up was kicking his legs
real fast, and he turned, counter-clockwise, and I saw his
face.  His eyes were going back and forth; he was under some
kind of pressure.  The light became brighter, and pulsated,
and the noise got louder.  He put his hands together, like
diving, and appeared very agile, but had to coordinate himself
with that light.  He went up into a grey UFO.  It seemed as if
they had pressed a button and wanted me to see this.  What I
saw - the 'AFM' had duct-work underneath it.  The light went
up, the ceiling went into place and that was it."

     "I can describe this being.  Ron Quinn had him down
pretty pat.  I'll start with his uniform.  It ended at his
elbows, and was a lead color, with a metallic look, but it
wasn't metal.  It was a material strictly alien to us, but
well-tailored.  It adhered to his body and had a very slight
triangular pattern in it.  I saw a collar, and black boots as
part of the uniform.  I saw a black belt somewhere but I don't
think it was on him....."

     "This whole recollection took about 1 1/2-2 minutes, like
they wanted me to see it.  Ron Quinn had given him a large
jaw.  Take a little bit off his jaw.  He also gave him an
upsweep on his jaw like a human being.  Well, that's wrong.
It goes almost straight back to his neck, no hinge on his jaw.
The forehead is right; two furrows, that's what I saw.  He had
a broad forehead, but his head is rounded off more.  If you
took a ruler and started at his tailbone and ran up his
backbone and ran it straight up to his head, you'd hardly see
any daylight.  That's important."

     "The neck is well-developed.  He had muscles like a
swimmer - long and smooth, not bulging like a weight-lifter.
Broad shoulders.  The body was rather heavy-set, but not fat.
And it's a man - big in the shoulders and slanted down to very
slender hips.  The eyes are perfect, with colored irises that
get darker at the outer edge."

     "It's hard to relate this to a person who's never had
experiences like this.  when you're in a position like this,
you simply recollect what you saw.  You aren't telling
yourself, 'Now, I gotta remember this'... the expression in
his eyes was one of excitement, not fierceness.  The whites of
his eyes were actually grey. He had a definite eyeball with an
iris and a black pupil.  The nose was a pug nose, just a piece
of flesh, with nostrils almost straight up and down.  The
nostrils were prominent compared to the size of the nose.  His
ears were just a lump I remember on the sides of his head.
His arms were long, down to his knees; the only thing on him
that wasn't proportional.  He had four fingers like us and a
thumb that curved inside his palm."

     "Unlike some others, I haven't been told I'm on a mission
or anything like that.  It's hard for me to accept that sort
of thing.  They are experimenting with us, and in my case it
was very elaborate.  Some people are picked up and forgotten
about.  In this case, they never let me alone.  In other
words, they appeared to let me know they were around. They
still do.  It got so I would run inside the house.  I got
tired of 'em.  Most people look for 'em in the sky.  Hell, I
was runnin' away from 'em!  I got sick of it."

     "They communicated with me.  They said they had their eye
on me and were watching me for years and years.  This is only
part of the story.  You can't rush it.  The abductee is as
much in the dark as someone who suddenly sees and AFM in the
air and wonders what it is.  He calls it a UFO.  I believe
they are extraterrestrial.  They are not from our solar
system.  And they're extradimensional."

     "I don't know the rhyme or reason for all this, although
I do know they are interested in our intellectual and
emotional precesses.  I experienced laughter, suspicion,
anger, contentment and a feeling of comradeship with these
little beings.  I asked them questions.  They were very
interested in me for reasons I don't know."

     "One guy one time said, off-hand, 'you probably were
abducted,' and he laughed.  I had to laugh, too - I didn't
know what was going on and I still don't.  How could they go
through the roof?  How could they do these things?"

FROM UFO Magazine Vol 2, No 4 1987

For over 20 years Allan Drake has been obediently listening to
alien messages coming to him telepathically.  Though at first
resistant and disbelieving, Drake has finally come to terms with
his experiences-and his unseen mentors-enough to recall the
contact hopefully ;and passionaltely express his dismay about
general ignorance of extraterrestrial phenomenon. He sounds a
clear warning that such ignorance must end.

--------

    "It is difficult for me to describe my feelings.  But I feel
that for me and others the contactee experience has opened up a
window on the many mysteries that have gone unanswered for many
centuries."

    "It started in 1959 when I was 14. With my family, I was
living in a township near East St. Louis, Illinoise.  We kids
used to play in an old, abandoned train depot near the house.

    "One evening while I was alone and looking down the tracks, I
noticed a glow coming from a distance.  At first I thought it was
a train, but it didn't move and I got curious.  I started walking
down the tracks toward the glow."

    "I got within 50 feet of what looked like a round, metallic
craft sitting right on the tracks.  Three beings stood around it.
They were about 4 feet tall with rather large heads and no hair.
Their eyes were larger than normal;the noses were very small.
They had small mouths.  As I approached the beings seemed to
stare at me, making no moves."

    "I became frightened and tried to hide in a gulley which ran
alongside the tracks.  The beings turned to face me, still
staring. I could feel their eyes in my head!  While watching the
craft in a prone position, I was struck in the head by a blue
beam of light from the craft, and rendered unconscious. Later I
awoke but the craft and beings were gone.  I had the impression
they had done something to me..."

    "Since that time there have been other incidents.  About
eight years ago, while I was taking my son to the movies, my car
was bumped violently from behind while I was waiting at a stop
light.  There were no other cars near at the time.  When we
looked behind, there was nothing there."

    "When I arrived home I examined the rear of the car.  On the
trunk could be seen five round marks arranged in a circular
fashion, each about the size of half-dollar coins.  The paint had
been 'erased' in those areas.

    "About two years later, while working as a guard at a local
college in the hills, I was sitting in my car at the bottom of a
hill, while another guard was on duty at the top.  Later he told
me he had seen a blue ball of light over my car, and watched it
while it flew away.  He described it as the size of a basketball.
I was unaware of what was happening, but did have the impression
my memory was being scanned.  Different memories were coming to
mind, even of childhood times.

    "One night about three years later, I was in the living room
watching television.  It was about 2:30 a.m.  Suddenly the TV
started acting funny, and a kind of static charge seemed to fill
the room. Then a huge wind hit the house.  It felt like it was
going to tear the house apart!  I felt like there was some huge
object right over the house-I was petrified and couldn't leave
the chair.  It stopped after a few minutes.  Later we found the
TV antennae had been damaged.

    "Recently there have been other strange incidents in my
house. Knocks come from the walls and roof.  Things pop off the
walls at times.  All during this time I have had what I believe
is telepathic communication with alien beings, who tell me
they're from the 'Association of Planets' who started life on
this planet and others.  They have mastered what we call genetic
engineering and can create any life form they please by arranging
DNA cells.  They have powerful mental abilities and can move
objects by thought alone.  They control the human mind by
implanting suggestions, making a person think an objects there
when it's not, or making it invisble when it's there!  It's done
by controlling aspects of the brain.

    "It was decided they would build a whole new world on earth.
Association scientists got together and decided what life forms
would be here, and arrangements were made to create ones to fit
in with the various climates on the planet.  They wanted a
balance where no one life form would dominate.  One planet
learder named Lucifer did not agree with this arrangement and had
a dispute with the High Council...

    "Life was eventually planted on Earth.  Scientists
experimented with different life forms, and some of them didn't
work out...eventually it was decided that the intelligent form of
life would be human in appearance.  Different races of human
types in the Association wanted the first humans on earth to
resemble them.  The human races were each allowed to plant a man
and woman that resembled them in different regions on Earth, and
a sophisticated civilzation developed, along with advanced
science.

    "During this time, the Association has also developed life on
two other planets in this solar system, Mars and a planet known
as Vulca.  It was found during this period that mankind had
unstable emotions.  The one once known as Lucifer-dismissed from
the Association and called the "Fallen One" after attempting a
violent takeover-took advantage of this and created friction
between the various civilizations.  As a result, the planet Vulca
was completely destroyed, and the civilization on Mars also, with
most of its atmosphere blown away.

    "Civilization on Earth was destroyed too.  A few structures
from that time still remain, such as Stonehenge and the Great
Pyramids.  Mankind on Earth today is what remains of those people
long ago, and it is feared that the same mistakes of the past
will be repeated...

    "There are some people who will do anything to keep this
knowledge covered up.  They fear the changes that would result
from society's full understanding.  They want to remain on top of
the heap, though they should not be.  This knowledge is for all
people, regardless of race, nationality or creed.  To our fathers
in space, all peoples of the world are one people.

    "I realize what I have to say will bring me some ridicule and
will probably set me back socially-but I am willing to bear those
burdens!  I feel a compulsion to get this information out, no
matter what the cost to myself."

   Sometime ago I received a paper form a researcher in Columbia Missouri on
the Hill case. I found the paper very interesting but wondered if his conclu-
sions were accurate. I decided to contact Mrs. Hill. I told her about the BBS
and that I wanted to put the paper on the board, but wanted to let her know
what was being said and offer her a chance for rebuttal/corrections. She ac-
cepted. What follows is the paper, and then two letters from her. I have used
[brackets] to show her corrections.

#2  The Hill Abduction Case, 1961, source: Interrupted Journey

SEPT. 18-19  [Sept. 19-20] Barney and Betty Hill abducted in the White Moun-
tains of New Hampshire. They remember part of the experience but have over 2
hours of "missing time," of which they are totally unaware at first. Barney
remembers seeing huge object with "fins with red lights on the ends" and "crew
members behind glass" panels at very short range. This object was more than
100 feet across and hovered 50 feet above the ground only 300 feet away for
several minutes Barney watched through binoculars.

SEPT. 20  Betty Hill calls her sister and tells her part of the story. Sister
then calls a local physicist who suggested they check for radiation. Sister
also calls local police chief who suggests they call Pease AFB, Portsmouth,
N.H. Betty calls the Air Force Base, worried about radiation. The officer who
answers was at first "cynical and unresponsive" but finally did ask to talk to
Barney. After Barney mentioned the "fins with lights" the officer perked up
and said the call was being "monitored". Barney felt that the officer was
definitely interested. Barney did not mention the figures he had seen behind
the glass through binoculars.

SEPT. 21  Major Paul Anderson, Intelligence Officer for the 100th Bomb Group,
Pease AFB, calls back, says he has stayed up all night working on a report of
this incident. Asked Barney for the size of the object. Barney says it
appeared as big as a dinner plate held at arms length. Major Anderson filed a
report with Blue Book, #100-1-61.

SEPT. 23  Betty [Barney] Hill Goes to the local Library and finds one of Major
Donald Keyhoe's books on UFOs. Takes down his address.

SEPT. 26  Betty Hill writes to Keyhoe in Washington, D.C., describing the
incident as she remembers it. Fuller reports that NICAP (Keyhoe's
organization) was getting 40,000 letters a year.

SEPT. 30  Ten days after the sighting Betty Hill begins to have a series of
vivid and awesome dreams, which Fuller does not tell us about. They continue
for five days and then stop.

OCT. 4  Keyhoe is asked to lunch by Robert Hohman and someone named C.D.
Jackson, "senior engineer" for a "notable electronics company", name
withheld. They are supposedly working on a paper about extra-terrestrial
contacts that Nikola Tesla, David Todd and Marconi were alleged to have
experienced in the early part of the century. Keyhoe tells them about the
Hills.

OCT. 21  Walter Webb, investigtaor for Keyhoe's NICAP and an astronomer [lec-
turer] with the Hayden Planetarium, New York, N.Y., comes to interview the
Hills. He is there several hours. Betty does not tell him about her dreams.
Barney tells of the "captain" and others he saw through the glass.

OCT. 25?  Betty begins to have a series of dreams following an experience in
the car. She had panicked as she and Barney had come upon a stalled auto in
the road with some people standing around it. That night she dreamed of being
taken into a UFO and given some sort of examination.

OCT. 26  Webb's report goes to NICAP in Washington. He had not been contacted
by Keyhoe directly but through the mail by Richard Hall, NICAP's secretary. He
had been skeptical. He was very much impressed by the Hills, however.

NOV. 3  Hohman and Jackson write the Hills asking for an interview. They tell
the Hills that they are serious minded men whose interest is in "verifying the
origin of these vehicles according to existing scientific theory maintained by
Hermann Oberth." Oberth was of V-2 rocket fame. They did not reveal their
place of employment but permission was granted.

NOV. 25  Hohman and Jackson come to the house to interview the Hills. "Also
visiting that day" is Major James McDonald, a long-time friend of the Hills
and an Air Force intelligence officer. It appears he asks no questions about
who Homan and Jackson are. The Hills had "discussed the case many times with
Maj. McDonald." The three of them spend 12 hours talking to the Hills about
their experience, including the "men" behind the glass. Major McDonald
suggests hypnosis but does not know any therapists. The matter rests here for
some time. Both Hills begin to be concerned about the incident and the chance
they may have been hallucinating.

MAR., 1962  Betty Hill writes to a doctor recommended by a colleague. The
Hills see him and tell their stories. The doctor recommends they wait and see
if the problem subsides on its own. No therapy is attempted.

SUMMER, 1962  Barney begins to see a psychiatrist about his anxiety but only
briefly mentions the UFO incident.

SEPT., 1962  The Hills are invited to a "UFO Study Group" to informally talk
about their experience. That meeting is taped, by whom Fuller does not say,
unknown to the Hills. Betty talked of her dreams, the dream of the physical
examination.

SEPT., 1963  The Hills tell their church discussion group about the UFO inci-
dent. That same day Captain Ben Swett, from Pease AFB, was to talk about hyp-
nosis, which he had made a personal hobby of his. The Hills are encouraged by
Major McDonald to talk to their church friends about their experience and en-
couraged by Capt. Swett to undergo hypnosis. Barney is experiencing extreme
psychological disturbances as a result of the UFO sighting and abduction. He
would die in the late 1960's at the age of 46.

FALL [Oct.], 1965  Sensational articles run in Boston newspaper about the

NOV., 1965  Unitarian Church in Dover, N.H., invites the Hills to talk. Hills
meet with Admiral Knowles, NICAP, before they speak. Also on program is a
Public Information Officer from Pease, AFB, who is a member of the Church [not
a church member] and has helped set up the event. He does not attack the
Hills.  At this time a huge UFO flap was underway in the area and hundreds of
people were turned away from the church on a cold and raw evening. The usual
attendance for the weekly Unitarian sessions: 40 people.

Subject : Hill Abduction: 3 of 7

This is part 3 of an examination of the book Interrupted Journey by Fuller.
-+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AS YOU CAN SEE from the simple chronology above (assembled from John Fuller's
book with difficulty) there is more going on in the Hill case than meets the
eye.

WHO WERE "HOMANN and C.D. Jackson?" Who were they really working for? Why was
a "major electronics firm" paying them to investigate 60-year-old fairy tales
about Nikola Tesla? What "scientific theories" held by Hermann Oberth could be
of interest to an "electronics firm."  What we actually have here is a "cover"
for intelligence activity.

IN ALIENS FROM SPACE, 1973, Keyhoe says that these two "engineers" were
"aiding NICAP."  That is not the impression that is given in Fuller's book. In
INTERRUPTED JOURNEY the strong impression is that these two gentlemen simply
had an independent interest due to a strange research assignment from their
company. This could be accepted in 1966. In 1990 we know better.

YOU SEE, by the fall of 1963 a gentleman named C.D. Jackson was working for
Time/Life Corporation in an executive position. In fact, he was helping to
arrange a $25,000 payment to the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald.

IN CASE YOU HAVE forgotten, Time/Life bought the Zapruder Film for $150,000
and then made sure it was not shown as a film for many years. Then, when it
was shown, it had been obviously altered. David Lifton in BEST EVIDENCE says
that the film was at the CIA's photo interpretation lab the day Time/Life
bought it.

DOES THE FACT THAT Donald Keyhoe had lunch with C.D. Jackson just after
getting Betty Hill's letter "resonate" with you? It does with this author.
Donald Keyhoe was, in UFOsearch's opinion, running a two-track operation. In
the public and with his organization he was not interested in "contactee"
stories. But on deep background he was involved with another investigation,
one connected with the intelligence community. Were they running him?

CONSIDER THIS. In ALIENS FROM SPACE Keyhoe says that "A well-known journalist,
John Fuller, had learned of the case in a confidential talk at NICAP. It was
arranged that he should prepare the record using Dr. Simon's taped questions
and the Hill's answers." Then Keyhoe says: INTERRUPTED JOURNEY received a
surprising amount of serious attention compared to the usual treatment of
"contactee stories." How interesting.

YES--AND THE "abduction story" has become a staple of the UFO investigator.
Indeed, the sanitized Hill story became the ONLY abduction movie ever
made --- before COMMUNION, 1989. And the Hill saga appeared only on the small
screen, it never ran in theaters. The same could almost be said for COMMUNION
which was not widely distributed and died a very quick death. It will be in
video stores by mid-1990 which, I think, is the idea.

OTHER QUESTIONS: How did it happen that one of the Hill's best friends was an
Air Force Intelligence Officer who just happened to be visiting the day that
Hohman and Jackson showed up? Isn't it interesting that they were the ones who
first made the Hills aware of their "missing time?" Isn't it interesting that
they were the ones who suggested hypnosis?

ISN'T IT INTERESTING that the man finally called in to do the regressions on
the Hills was the Executive officer of the Army's main psychiatric hospital
during World War II, who did his undergraduate work at Johns Hopkins
University whose wartime president was a member of MAJESTIC-12 and who was the
technical advisor on the major WWII propaganda film made by the famous
director John Huston? The Hills went through two other therapists before going
to Simon. Did they have the money to pay this gentlemen, who must have been
very, very expensive? This is something Fuller does not talk about. Did NICAP
pay their way?

UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITY  The Hills were "set up" by the people dealing with the
so-called "Greys" out in New Mexico. The Hill case was either a deep-cover
check on what the "Greys" were doing under the "agreement" or it was an even
deeper-cover attempt at "disinformation" to get "abductions" in play--safely.

END HILL CASE

Letter from Betty Hill:

  Scientists, working at top level government jobs. Their HOBBY was ufos. As a
job protection for them, we agreed not to release their employment, altho it
was well known to us. C D Jackson was never associated with Time/Life. We had
continuing contacts with them. Jackson, in 1966, was still working in Alabama,
at the same employment.
   Most of our friends were officers at Pease AFB. Usually, we all met at the
Officers Club every Friday night. Barney's best friend was a Lt. Col. in
Intelligence. Jim McDonald was a Major; also a friend who dated one of my best
friends. Later they married. We visited each other regularly.
   Jim McDonald suggested hypnosis because our mutual friend, Capt. Ben Swett,
officer at Pease, did this. Ben felt his type of hypnosis was not adequate, as
he used only a light stage, which is the stage of suggestibility.
   Dr Ben Simon had left military service years before we met him and he was
in private practice. Dr Stephans referred us to him because he knew he used
medical hypnosis, taught in medical school, when Dr. Stephans had been one of
his students.
   As for the movie, "Let Their Be Light" dealt with medical hypnosis used by
Dr Simon to treat servicemen returning from WW2, and restoring them to good
health. A wonderful movie - it should be released to the public.
   As for two therapists; we consulted one, one appointment. Barney was seen
be Dr Duncan Stephans, but I was not.
   As for the cost of our appointments with Dr Simon, it is true he was very
expensive. Our health insurance paid one-half of this. Bill was submitted for
"therapy following ufo capture".  We paid the remaining half, which was in the
thousands of dollars.
   John Fuller did not learn of our experience from NICAP, or Donald Keyhoe.
From them, he learned the information which resulted in his book, INCIDENT IN
EXETER. He was in this area, gathering information for this, when the Boston
newspaper articles were published.
   As for "Unpleasant Possibility" - Pure Paranoia! Nothing "sinister" about
our experience or our friends. And the UFO definitely had nothing to do with
New Mexico.
   It would be appreciated if you would send me a corrected copy for your
computer. Nice to hear from you -

                                            Sincerely,
                                            Betty  (signed)
                                            Betty Hill

P.S. How I know those who captured us were not from New Mexico -- No alien-
government base exists there. Apparently this story began when a woman in a
light trance of hypnosis told of being taken there.
   Ed Conroy, a writer, and a friend Dora Ruffner did an investigation of
this.  They learned the locations of these so-called bases were located on the
reservation of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe, a restricted area. So they met with
the tribal leaders and obtained permission to research the areas, with guides
and without them. They explored the areas. All they found was an abondoned
water tower that had been used in the past when a railroad ran thru this area;
also a house habited by an Apache family. No gravel roads, no towers, no
government or any other kind of installations.
   Ed Conroy was the first person to research this report - He is a reporter
on arts and electronic media for the San Antonio Express News. He should be
included on your computer network.

I wrote to Mrs. Hill again and thanked her for her comments and asked if she
would like to make a statement for the BBS regarding her experience, the fol-
lowing is her response.


April  2, 1990

Dear Barbara Becker,

   I think probably the easiest way to answer your questions is to list the
events as they occured.
   Let me say first, that in a case like ours, our conscious mind did not re-
member all, but our subconscious mind did.
   We considered the beginning of our capture was the time when Barney was
standing in the field, watching the craft, when one of the humanoids said
something to him, resulting in his panic and running back to the car, yelling
they were trying to capture us.
   As we went speeding along the highway to avoid capture, we heard the
beeping sounds, and the car vibrated.
   When Barney turned into a secondary road, I thought we knew a short cut on
our way home, and did not question this. Then we saw what we called the moon
setting on the ground. We assumed the moon was setting, and we could see the
trees in front of this.
   The next, Barney turned onto a dirt road, in the direction of the setting
moon. Before I could question him about this, we saw the men standing in the
road, blocking our way - and we could not remember beyond this point.
   We remembered looking for the highway, but before we reached this, we saw
the craft again as it passed over the secondary road in front of us.
   When we entered onto the main highway, we heard a second series of beeping
sounds. And we came home, looking for the craft all the way and not seeing it.
   At home, Barney's first remark was "It is 5 o'clock, We should have been
home by 3 AM at the latest." This time was from our kitchen clock, for both
our watches had stopped running - this puzzled us, that both stopped about the
same time.
   Barney began to unload our belongings from the car. We agreed they should
not be brought into the house, so they were left on the back porch for a
couple of days.
   Then we took long showers, shampoos for we felt "very dirty".
   We agreed that something had happened, we did not know what it was, but we
could not talk about it. We would forget about it as quickly as possible.
   The next day I went out to my car, and found highly polished spots on the
trunk in a circular pattern. I became very upset, saying maybe we had been
exposed to something dangerous - the spots should be checked out. So I called
my sister who called a physist who suggested checking the spots with a
compass, which I did. When the compass was very erratic, I called my sister
again to tell her of this. At that time a police officer was at her home, and
I talked with him - told him about the night before. He said they had orders
to tell witnesses to call Pease Air Force Base and report this sighting. So we
called Pease and told them about the sighting, but ommitted about Barney
seeing the humanoids.
   Our next step was to return to the Mountains, looking for a secondary road,
the dirt road, thinking if we could find these, we could remember what
happened after we saw the "men in the road". We went back regularly, in all
kinds of weather, looking but not finding the dirt road. While we were there,
we asked everyone we saw, if they ever saw any strange lights in the sky,
received hundreds of reports - meeting with groups of 50 or more at a time,
who told of their sightings, but none with an experience similar to ours,
which we did not discuss.

   About six to eight weeks after this experience, we came home one night, and
found on the kitchen table a pile of dried leaves. Our first response
was - someone has been in our home! When I began to clean up the leaves, I
found my blue ear rings I was wearing that night. That was panic - how did I
lose them and who returned them? And how did they get into our home?
   Next was my dress. The second time I had worn this, and now it was covered
with a pink powdery substance. I put it outside, and the powdery substance
blew away, but it left pink stains all over my dress. Also the hem and some
seams were torn - it had a built in lining - badly torn.
   To go back, to ten nights after this experience, I had a series of dreams,
for five nights, of being captured, taken on board, given a physical exam. At
that time, Barney worked midnight to 8 AM, so he was not here. I typed out
these dreams and hid them, never discussed them until the time of our hypnosis
with Dr. Simon.
   As for Hohman and Jackson, they had attended some kind of Geological
Conference in Washington DC and met Donald Keyhoe there. After the Conference
they told him they had a hobby, and interest in flying saucers (the term at
that time) He let them read Walt Webb's report of his meeting with us.
   Hohman wrote to us, asking to meet with us. We agreed for at than time, we
knew nothing about ufos, and we were quietly seeking some explanation for our
expereince. Hohman was from New York, and Jackson was from Alabama, so we
needed to wait until these two were together.
   When they were here, Barney told them about the humanoid saying something
to him, which he could not remember - this was very upsetting to him.
   We told them about the setting moon just before we turned on to the dirt
road. They said we could not have seen the moon, for it had already set. Panic
by both of us.
   So they suggested we take a road map, and pinpoint our location at
different times. We knew we had left Colebrook about 10 PM, the restaurant
there. We were able to pinpoint the locations and times most of the way, but
at one point between Plymouth and Ashland was a blank. So they suggested we go
back to this general area. Then we talked about time - we could drive to
Canada in seven hours, and it had taken us seven hours to come home from
Colebrook. There had to be an explanation. Later this was called a missing
time period. But right from the beginning Barney and I knew the trip home was
much longer then it should have been.
   We continued to go back to the mountains, looking for the dirt road, asking
people about their sightings. Then we began asking if anyone had ever seen the
people aboard the crafts. No. No one knew Barney had seen them and remembered
this.
   As for a hallucination, I was and am a trained social worker. I know the
conditions which must exist for a hallucination to occur - for both people to
have the same one, at the same time, does not happen. Dr. Simon confirmed this
impossibility.
   As for the car incident, we both became upset at the same time, but I had
already had my dreams. We were puzzled as to the reasons we responded the way
we did.
   If we had not had all these upsetting events happen, without explanation,
we would had never have spent thousands of dollars going to Dr. Simon. We went
to him, to get rid of our anxieties, not for a ufo capture. He worked with us
for seven months, every week. But I learned during these sessions when he was
putting our amnesia back so we could not remember, that we must see him every
week for him to reinforce the amnesia. If we did not do this, we would
remember in about ten days - the same length of time, after this experience,
that I had my dreams. Now I know I recalled these events, in my dreams, as a
result of the lessening of their control of my memory.

   After our hypnosis, we went back to the area, and went directly to the
secondary road, to the dirt road. Found the cleared area in the woods where
the craft was down.
   Since that time, three labs have tried to analyze the pink stains on my
dress without success.
   I agree with you the field of UFOlogy is filled with disinformation. They
have done more to cover real activities by ufos than any other group. As for
my social worker background, I know that insecure people have a terrible time
with things they do not understand, and must develop an explanation,
satisfactory to themselves, which usually is a fantasy. I dislike the term
"missing time" for everyone has missing time. The human brain is incapable of
remembering every little detail of our lives, every moment. No one can
remember everything that happened yesterday.
   I have worked with those who have been captured, and with those who would
like to think they were. Five were real captures, reported almost immediately
to the police, and in three cases, they were at the emergency room at the
hospital within three hours.  Then for the others - five were beginning to be
mentally ill, were committed, diagnosed, and treated. Later, one became a
suicide. Then there are the hoaxes - I walked right thru the wall - how much
did it cost for repairs? They call back in a few days, and tell me how they
fooled the hypnotist by telling weird tales, which were believed. Finally,
there are those who are led astray by auto-suggestion, called hypnosis, by
those using it. I can take anyone, and in fifteen minutes, thru a simple
exercise can give them a ufo capture. But I am sure that they know it is only
a "Flight of Fantasy". But it is the same kind of "hypnosis" others are using.
It is not the hypnosis we had. We had the kind that is used in surgery. I
would like to see all those who use the wrong kind, try to do some simple
medical procedures.
   So many try to copy my experiences, so Dr. Simon wrote a segment about
hypnosis, the types, testing and characteristics. No one apparently read or
understood this section, pages 82 thru 85, for they ignore this. Unfortunately
it is ruining the field of hypnosis, which does have good medical uses.
   I went to a conference of so-called abductees. One told of her experiences,
right out of Star Trek. She took on the part played by Capt. Kirk. Used the
same names as in the tv program. Later we told her this, so she went back and
had "hypnosis" again and came up with a different capture. Such success. Such
fairy tales they tell.
   Thanks for letting me set the record straight. Some times I have heard my
experiences told in such a way, I did not recognize it.

                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Betty  (signed)
