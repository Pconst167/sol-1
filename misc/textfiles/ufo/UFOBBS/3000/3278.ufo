³o³Times-Journal, Fort Payne, AL  Jan. 30 1993                 ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³  DOGTOWN - Sue Johnson was drying her hair before          ³o³
³o³leaving for work early Thursday morning when a              ³o³
³o³strange, unearthly hum rose above. thc noise of the         ³o³
³o³hair dryer, accompanied by an odd vibration throughout      ³o³
³o³her mobile home.                                            ³o³
³o³  She clicked off the dryer and walkd to her kitchen        ³o³
³o³window, preparing to look upward into the sky,              ³o³
³o³thinking the noise must be a low-flying aircraft.           ³o³
³o³  "This thing was eye-to-eye," she said, moving across      ³o³
³o³the pasture toward me. I've never seen anything like        ³o³
³o³it. I don't know what it was; but I do know it was not      ³o³
³o³an airplane or a helicopter."                               ³o³
³o³  Sue ran to her back door, flung it open and peered        ³o³
³o³into the cold 5 a.m. darkness. "It was moving below         ³o³
³o³the treetops about three car-lengths along my back          ³o³
³o³yard fence." she pointed to show the spot. "I could         ³o³
³o³tell its image by the red and green iights pulsating        ³o³
³o³on it. It was about half the length of my 65-foot           ³o³
³o³trailer."                                                   ³o³
³o³  She stood, transfixed, until the object guided to         ³o³
³o³the end of her trailer, out of sight; then she ran to       ³o³
³o³the front door, hoping to keep it in view.                  ³o³
³o³  "I never saw it again," she shrugged. "It just            ³o³
³o³disappeared."                                               ³o³
³o³  Sue immediately called her mother, Shirley Akins.         ³o³
³o³  The first thing my daughter asked me was do you           ³o³
³o³believe in UFO's? said Mrs. Akins. "I told her any          ³o³
³o³thing was possible. I do believe my daughter. She is a      ³o³
³o³level-headed person."                                       ³o³
³o³  Mrs. Akins and Sue said a co-worker who lives in the      ³o³
³o³area mentioned at work Thussday she heard the same          ³o³
³o³sound around 5 a.m. And later that evening, at 6:30         ³o³
³o³p.m., Williams Akins of Adamsburg reported seeing the       ³o³
³o³object, which Sue sketched in the typical shape of          ³o³
³o³`fat-in-the-middle-and-tapered-on-the-ends."                ³o³
³o³  "I didn't want to say anything about this," Ms.           ³o³
³o³Johnson added. "I know people think you're crazy if         ³o³
³o³you do. Normally, I'm the type person where I don't         ³o³
³o³believe anything like that until I see it for myself.       ³o³
³o³Thursday was just a normal morning for me."                 ³o³
³o³  Ms. Johnson says she doesn't necessarily believe in       ³o³
³o³aliens, but feels the craft is nothing that mainstream      ³o³
³o³America is aware of.                                        ³o³
³o³  "I don't know what this thing was.  I was sizing it       ³o³
³o³up from one end to the other.  I stood there for            ³o³
³o³several seconds.  I was so amazed at what I was             ³o³
³o³seeing, it just blew me away."                              ³o³
³o³  Ms. Johnson said she knew very little of the              ³o³
³o³internationally publicized Fyffe UFO spotted by             ³o³
³o³numbers of residents (including Fyffe Police) in Feb.       ³o³
³o³1989, but her description of the Dogtown UFO closely        ³o³
³o³resembled those offered in Fyffe.                           ³o³
³o³  Mrs. Akins has notified the Federal Aviation              ³o³
³o³Administration, who suggested she call Agent Glenn          ³o³
³o³Slaughter with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         ³o³
³o³Attempts to reach Slaughter in Gadsen on Friday were        ³o³
³o³unsuccessful.                                               ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
