Washington, D.C. - WWN has obtained obsolute proof that our government has 
captured at least one space alien: A dramatic photograph of a living 
extraterrestrial!

The eerie black-and-white image was snapped by a U.S. Marine after he and 12 
others tormed a dsiabled alien starship. It was provided to this paper by an 
unidentified CIA agent with access to top secret U.S. Navy files.

"The spacship landed on the deck of the U.S.S. Nimitz in August 1991, and its 
extraterrestrial crew was taken in to custody," explained the high-ranking 
agent, who personally interviewed four aliens in a secret Maryland compound in 
1993. "Since then, at least two of the aliens are rumored to have died in 
captivity.

"An official photo of the aliens has never been seen by the public because our 
government won't even admit that the extraterrestrials exist. Yet they've kept 
these poor beings in an underground site, heavily guarded and totally 
isolated. It's a terrible inujustice. They should be freed."

The 48-year-old agent, who has tried for several years to force the government 
to free their captives, contends that the 4-foot-tall creatures are harmless. 
He says they landed on the Nimitz because their ship was having mechanical 
problemsl and did not resist when Navy personnel seized their craft.

In 1994, the source provided a classified government sketch of the 
extraterrestrials to the NEWS and this paper published the drawing in tis 
April 5 issue. The article resulted in a special White House investigation 
into the aliens' situation, but ultimately the plans to release the alien 
captives were dropped.

Last month, the agent contacted the NEWS again and delivered an actual photo 
of an alien taken when it was captured. The picture has been authenticated by 
outside experts who verify that the photo is genuine.

"The inside of the starship was pitch black, so the alien is illuminated only 
by the camra's flash," the agent explained. "It looks strange, but it si 
totally accurate. This is what these little guys look like. And it's absolute 
proof that we're holding messengers from another world."

The agent says his interviews with the aliens were friendly and convinced him 
that the intelligent creatures deserve sympathetic treatment.

"They just want to go home," he said. "But the Navy has dismantled their 
spaceship in the name of science so there's no way to get them there. We have 
to figure out what we're going to do with our alien captives before they all 
die and someone from their world decides to take revenge on us."
