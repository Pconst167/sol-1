    RICHMOND,  Va.  --  An Army publicist who claims he received a poor job 
    evaluation  because  of  his off-duty efforts to  expose  military  UFO 
    coverups  argued before a federal appeals panel he needs an  injunction 
    to protect him from his supervisors' ire. 
     
      But  a  three-judge panel of the 4th U.S.  Circuit Court  of  Appeals 
    suggested  Tuesday  the  entire  case  may  be  unnecessary  since  the 
    offending evaluation had already been excised from Larry Bryant's file. 
     
      Bryant, 52, a 32-year civil service veteran from Alexandria who works 
    as  a  civilian editor for the Army News Service,   claimed  his  First 
    Amendment  right to free speech was violated because his job rating was 
    based in part on his longtime interest in UFOs and the military. 
     
      In  1985,   after running ads asking for help in ending  "the  Cosmic 
    Watergate,"  Bryant received his first-ever unsatisfactory job  rating. 
    Bryant sued,  claiming the Army was trying to block his search for Army 
    whistleblowers.   The Defense Department later agreed to stop bothering 
    him  about the ads,  but Bryant continued to press his First  Amendment 
    case. 
     
      The  U.S.   District Court in Alexandria threw the case out,   saying 
    there  were other ways to settle the matter besides a lawsuit.  The 4th 
    U.S.   Circuit  Court of Appeals agreed,  but the U.S.   Supreme  court 
    overturned them both and ordered a hearing. 
     
      As the July 1989  trial began, Bryant asked for a delay because a key 
    witness -- a supervisor who allegedly was out to get him because he was 
    "an  embarrassment"   --  was on assignment in  Antartica.   The  court 
    proceeded  without the witness,  ruled in favor of the government,  and 
    this appeal followed. 
     
      To  Judge Francis Murnaghan Jr.'s inquiries about the proof of  UFOs, 
    Bryant's  lawyer,   James Heller of Washington contended Bryant  had  a 
    First Amendment right to seek answers to "unknown events." 
     
      "Why wouldn't he be an embarrassment" if he's following "a theory for 
    which no scientific basis has been found?" Murnaghan asked. 
     
      Judge  Dickson Phillips Jr.,  also wondered why Bryant couldn't  "get 
    his  supervisors  off  his back ...  without  getting  into  the  First 
    Amendment jurisprudence? 
     
      "If the ax really drops on him, then he can sue," Phillips said. 
     
      Heller   said  Bryant  fears  that  without  the  protection  of   an 
    injunction, he'll be fired. Since Bryant sued, all his evaluations have 
    been top-notch, Heller said. 
     
      In  answer  to  a question,  Koppel also  noted  that  the  offending 
    evaluation  wasn't  even in the file,  because they  are  automatically 
    thrown out after three years. 
      
      Phillips,   apparently convinced the revelation made the case legally 
    worthless, asked Koppel "Why didn't the Supreme Court look at mootness? 
    They put two courts to a lot of trouble for a moot case." 
     
      A decision is expected in about 60 days.
