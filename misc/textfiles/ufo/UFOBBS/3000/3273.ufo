HUMAN COMPUTER TRACKING NOW MORE EFFICIENT
By G.G. Stearman

From time to time, we feature an update on new technologies that might
ultimately be based as computer tracking devices, facilitating a cashless
society of totalitarian control. It is just a society that is depicted in
the 13th chapter of Revelation. Total control calls for the rapid
transfer of individual data, with a veritable electronic library
accompanying each citizen.
We have just come across news of yet another device that seems to be the
precursor of just such a system. In the August 19, 1991 edition of
_Federal Computer Week_, we took note a new invention called the "MicroCan."
Dallas Semiconductor has introduced what they call "a chip in a can, that
could replace bar codes, magnetic-strip cards and even smart cards in some
applications."
The new devices are slightly smaller in diameter than a dime, and slightly
thicker. They have the appearance of the tiny coin-sized energy cells that
are used to power everything from watches to hearing aids.
They contain a chip which "allows a user to instantly read or write up to
4 kilobits of data through the can's sealed lid with only a momentary
contact while the can is still attached to a product or identification
card, creating a small but portable database."
Both the chips and the readers that are required to access them are said
to be quite inexpensive. They are also rugged and easy to use. Rick Hall,
the company's product manager said, "The military is moving toward read/
write technologies. We're actually so new they might not even have a
category that describes the chip-in-a-can technology."
He added, "It is the ability to hold up-to-date information taht gives Touch
Memory its advantage over bar codes and other tracking devices. A bar code
just tells you a single number. This device actually becomes a database that
goes with the product."
A database includes a set of current records that accompanies any individual
member of a group. The many uses for the product include self-stick "Stick'em
Chips" for applications such as replacing bar codes on products or substituting
for magnetic strips on identification cards.
The company also plans to produce identification cards and plastic key fobs.
The company also manufactures "devices that can receive and transmit their
date as they pass near a special two-way radio link. The credit-card sized
Proximity Tags react to low powered radio signals as they pass by. "They can
also be used on vehicles that are scanned as they pass through gates,
exchanging up to 1 million bits of information.
More and more often these days, we are seeing the rapid development of tiny and
inexpensive devices that will allow the instant transfer of biographical and
financial data. Such instant data will transcend all prior Constitutional
protections and right of privacy.
In the hands of an evil man, future miniature versions of this device might
even be implanted under the skin of the right hand or forehead of private
citizens.
Such individuals would then become tiny parts of a huge database: their
whereabouts, financial records, relatives, acquaintances, preferences and
personal philosophies would be instantly available to any inquistor. They
would be unable to hide.
This is the horror that will accompany those who live under the system of the
Beast during the time of the Great Tribulation.
