Subject: Queries About Outerspace

Tonight I happened to be viewing on the television a special segment on
current affair about UFO abductions. It seems, through their reporting, that
our friendly Uncle Sam, at first did not believe that these people who have
reported it, been abducted by aliens. The fact was, it wasn't till many
reports, spread out through the world came in, did they even began to take
notice. A couple of questions were raised, but never really answered. The
first and foremost was, "Were these people actually taken aboard alien
spacecraft and used as test subjects?". Now, let me play the devils advocate,
and start by saying, that it is quite possible, in spite of the fact, that
when the aliens...all described as being large headed, not very tall, with
long black eyes, little or no nose, and a small slit for a mouth...were first
described, it took like wild-fire to dry bush, and many other reports came
out. Now the other question that this rises, is it fact or fiction. Let's view
this another way. Question: Why have our space travlers...shuttle
astronauts...seen these so called space vehicles or aliens? Why out of all the
people on the earth, were these men and women not abducted? To me it would
seem easier for our extraterrestrial friends to abduct them, deep in
outerspace, than to risk exposure by abducting someone from the planets
surface. Two things can be said in defense. One, that the constant radio
connections between the shuttle and earth are too frequent, and would be too
hard to bypass. Secondly, when our astronauts returned to earth, there
physicals, which are given alway's before and after a mission, would detect
tampering with
their bodies. But to offense that question, let's ask why there are no
physical oddities discovered about the people who were on earth. I will tell
you bluntly, that if I remembered being taken into a strange alien craft, and
had experiments preformed on me, I sure would want to see a doctor that same
night. No if's and's or but's about it. I would claim I was scared frightened
or otherwise, and I by nature am a very shy person! I find it hard to believe
that so many people were abducted, for a couple reasons. Too many constants in
their stories, and two, nothing noticable diffrent about then either. I do
however believe, one or two stories, but not fifty, and not the same tale told
in diffrent words. I am not here posting this to say that I do not belive in
aliens, because I do. What I want is to make people think about it
more...instead of just passing thoughts. Because if one day, we all are to
meet out space friends, then we'll have to have more knowledge than we already
do. We may have advanced technologicaly, but socially, we still live in trees!
I belive this is why we ARE being studied, and why our friends have not made
contact. Just look at the world around you, the violence, ignorance and crime.
To them, we must seem like barbarians!
