REJOINDER TO THE CRITIQUE OF BUDD HOPKINS

Until a certain dignitary steps forth, the "Linda
Cortile" case continues to generate controversy.

          By Walter H. Andrus, Jr.

  
   Beginning in January of this year, authors Joseph
Stefula, Richard Butler and George Hansen began cir-
culating a 25-page document titled "A Critique of
Budd Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction of Linda
Napolitano." Stefula is a former Special Agent for the
U. S. Army Criminal Investigations Command and a
former MUFON State Director for New Jersey.
Richard Butler is a former law enforcement and secu-
rity police specialist for the U. S. Air Force, now
researching abductions and government cover-up.
George Hansen is an author and parapsychologist liv-
ing in New Jersey. The document has been published
whole or in part in several UFO newsletters, including
the HUFON Report, and on various electronic bulletin
boards. As we go to press, we understand that it is
also scheduled to be printed, in whole or in part, in the
March/April issue of the International UFO Reporter,
edited by Jerry Clark and published by the J. Allen
Hynek Center for UFO Studies.

   Clark invited several of the people denigrated in
the "critique" by Stefula, Butler and Hansen to
write a rejoinder to be published concurrently
with their rambling article in IUR. After heading up
the Mutual UFO Network for 22 years, I have firmly es-
tablished my personal integrity and credibility in the
field of Ufology, therefore feel it is unnecessary to re-
spond to implied character assassination or to defend the
stature of MUFON to three publicity-seeking agitators.
   
   The following narrative, then, is basically an update
to the two articles published in the MUFON UFO
Journal by Budd Hopkins about the "Linda Cortile"
case for the benefit of UFO researchers. As a participant
in the October 3, 1992 meeting at Budd Hopkins' apart-
ment in New York City, I welcome the opportunity to
share with readers what actually occurred at the called
meeting. In previous correspondence with Budd
Hopkins, Stefula, Butler and Hansen asked for a hearing
of their charges that the case was a hoax perpetrated by
Linda. Mr. Hopkins made a wise decision by giving
them a tribunal to present their evidence to a panel of
qualified and vitally interested researchers, including
those of us who are now responding to their accusations.

LINDA ON TRIAL
 
   Linda, her husband and two sons related their indi-
vidual experiences in an environment reminiscent of a
courtroom trial. Rich Butler, acting on behalf of the
claimants, represented them as a proverbial antagonis-
tic prosecuting attorney, working from a prepared list
of charges. Linda was literally on trial. After several
hours of cross-examining Linda and presenting their
own testimony, Butler and Stefula reluctantly admitted
that there was insufficient evidence to support their
hoax theory. They conceded that there were a few
inconsistencies in the statements made to them by
Linda, in a private interview, versus what she had told
Budd Hopkins. Even though Butler and Stefula were
embarrassed by their lack of evidence to prove their
hoax claim, they have continued to write articles for
potential publication, probably encouraged by George
Hansen.
   However, based upon their knowledge of the case,
they felt that Linda should file charges to prosecute the
two security men, identified previously as "Rich" and
"Dan," for kidnapping and physical assault. Since we
have been unable to positively identify the security
agency employing Rich and Dan, going to the New
York City Police Department and filing charges for
such an unusual event might have made Linda's pre-
posterous story look like a joke in the eyes of police of-
ficials. Linda was also reluctant to file charges because
she felt that if Rich and Dan were government agents,
they were only acting in behalf of national security. It
was the considered opinion of several of us present that
under the circumstances this would have been a futile
and non-productive method to secure restitution from
Rich and Dan. It would have meant attempting to sue an
unknown security agency through a mailing of letters to
all possible such organizations within the U.S.
Government. This case has ramifications far more im-
portant than suing Rich and Dan.

MORE WITNESSES
    
   Since there were many more witnesses to the event on
the Brooklyn Bridge, and an unknown number of po-
tential witnesses in automobiles also stalled near the
security vehicle manned by Richard and Dan, it was
considered prudent to refrain from filing any court suits
that might squelch potential volunteer witnesses from
coming forward to testify. It is still imperative that Rich
and Dan reveal their last names and agree to testify
publicly or in confidence as witnesses. If the identity of
the "third man" could definitely be confirmed and if he
would agree to share his experiences, this would literally
"blow the lid" off the reality of the UFO abduction sce-
nario. Strong speculation exists that the visual abduction
of Linda was staged for the dignitary's benefit, because
he experienced the "full treatment," so to speak.


   Based upon the significant importance of such dis-
closures by the dignitary and additional witnesses, Jerry
Clark and I made an appeal to the team of Stefula,
Butler and Hansen to refrain from making a formal re-
quest for a federal investigation of the government
agents responsible for the alleged felonies for at least six
months. This would allow time for other witnesses to
come forward and permit present witnesses to testify pub-
licly. On October 3, 1992, Joe Stefula was MUFON's
New Jersey State Director, whereas Rich Butler and
George Hansen had no MUFON affiliation. After mak-
ing a sincere appeal to these three men, both Joe Stefula
and Richard Butler consented to the proposal to "buy
valuable time." Hansen, on the other hand, became very
belligerent, refusing to concede to the six-month de-
lay, and flatly stated that he was personally going to file
charges as a citizen of the U.S.A. The meeting effectively
adjourned, since it was apparent that as an outsider,
Hansen had decided to disregard any recommendations
and to take things into his own hands, irrespective of how
it might hurt Linda and her immediate family.
   
   Mr. Hansen has no connections whatsoever with the
UFO community and apparently feels that by denigrat-
ing the major personalities in UFO and abduction re-
search, he could thus elevate his own questionable
stature. After two somewhat threatening calls to Walt
Andrus, George proceeded to forge ahead on his own.
The January 8, 1993 article, "A Critique of Budd
Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction of Linda
Napolitano," was spitefully written, apparently in hopes
that someone would publish it.

   While I have no intention of responding to the
claims, falsehoods and implied innuendos that
are so prevalent in the article, obviously written by
George Hansen, but also signed and supported by Joe
Stefula and Richard Butler, I do feel that it is imperative
to mention one item which the trio has proposed to ex-
plain their suspicions that Linda orchestrated the story.
They selected passages, names of characters and events
from the science fiction novel Night Eyes by Garfield
Reeves-Stevens, published in Canada in April 1989, a
few months before Linda revealed her abduction expe-
rience to Budd Hopkins. In order to make these claims
sound legitimate, it was necessary to change names and
events throughout the book to find similarities between
Night Eyes and the Linda case. They imply that Linda
read the science fiction book and then proceeded to or-
chestrate the entire event, witnesses and all. Is this sci-
entific research or simply a "shot in the dark" by three
disgruntled individuals?
   
   Again, I have no intention of debating or refuting
point by point 25 pages of typed single-spaced accusa-
tions, references to diverse publications, a science fiction
book and even fantasy role-playing in the game
"Dungeons and Dragons." What does the latter game
have to do with scientific UFO research?

   George A. Filer, III, who replaced Joe Stefula as
New Jersey State Director, was also present and lis-
tened attentively at the October 3rd meeting. Mr. Filer
offered me an insight into what may have prompted
Mr. Stefula to become a party to this debunking exercise.
Having been trained in police investigative techniques,
Joe has difficulty accepting evidence in his own mind
that is not purely black or white. He has also admitted to
Mr. Filer that he really does not believe in the reality of
UFOs, therefore, like Philip Klass, he may have been
searching for an alternative explanation to the abduction
scenario. Richard Butler professes to be an abductee
and was attending Budd Hopkins' abduction support
group sessions where he met Linda. Butler brought Joe
Stefula as a guest to two sessions, where he interro-
gated two females present until they were in tears. As a
distinct outsider, George Hansen injected himself into
the Linda case by volunteering his writing ability, ap-
parently hoping to gain some degree of recognition in
the UFO field, regardless of whether it was positive or
negative.

CASE OF THE CENTURY?
  
   Both Stefula and Butler totally disregard the eyewit-
ness testimony of Rich, Dan, the dignitary and the lady
on the bridge, and then deny that such people really
exist. If they are actually trained in police investigative
techniques, as they profess, they must be cognizant that
eyewitness testimony is acceptable in a court of law. It is
difficult for me to understand that on one hand, the wit-
nesses do not exist, and in the next breath they want to
sue them for alleged felonies.
   
   George Hansen has written to several government
departments demanding that they conduct an investiga-
tion into their agents' atrocities. The U.S. Secret Service
contacted Linda and scheduled an interview with her
which was also attended by Budd Hopkins. After hear-
ing their testimony, the two special agents made an of-
ficial report for their records and thanked Linda and
Budd for their cooperation. They advised Linda that if
any other agency should contact her, she should simply
refer them to the Secret Service special agents who
conducted the interview for further information.
Apparently, they did not take Hansen's claims seriously,
treating him as another eccentric or "crank writer."
   
   In conclusion, after nearly 30 years in the UFO field,
I have developed a sensitivity to recognizing witnesses
who are prevaricating or fabricating a story. I am con-
vinced that Linda is telling the truth as she knows it. She
is mentally and physically incapable of planning and im-
plementing a hoax scenario of this magnitude. I predict
that continued investigation of reports from additional
witnesses and public disclosures by the known wit-
nesses will confirm that the Linda case is indeed "The
Case of the Century."
