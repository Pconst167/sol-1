 SUBJECT:  A TALE OF TWO WHALES ............

In the winter issue of UFO Magazine, I found some information that
comes from an unidentified space entity (seems like everyone wants to remain
unidentified now) One of the subjects covered  was killer whales. I've been a
skin diver before and most people know that the dolphin will not hurt a person
swimming.  As for the killer whale and  white shark it is quite a different
story. This information given, is according to the space person;   A few years
back the were a pair of Orcas, (killer whales) the female had gone to the
beach to die, while the male stayed in shallow water to wait..  A man came
along and attempted to get the female turned around and back into deep
waters, but she died anyway. The male orca became grief stricken, staying in
the shallow water.  The man then made a fence around the  male orca and got in
beside him and pushed food into it's mouth.  After quite a while, the orca did
finally get better. The man removed the fence when he saw  this had
attracted other humans, and let the orca go free.   This orca communicated
with the other orcas and now are aware of the good thing the human did. From
here on out we are off of the orcas menu.    It has been recommended that we
turn loose all killer whales, and dolphins after no more than three years, and
we will no longer have to capture them. Incidentally whales didn't evolve on
earth . And if you are awed by the gap in the human evolutionary history, you
will find even larger a gap in theirs. Killer whales and dolphins navigate by
echo location , like highly developed sonar. Sound waves are sent out and the
returning echoes are interpreted to produce and incredibly detailed three-
dimensional picture. By vocally mimicking the sound of the returning echoes,
these mammals can communicate pictures back and forth, like verbal television,
complete with dialog . When you enter the water with a killer whale, you won't
have to open your mouth to have your teeth examined. . . The orcas sonar
vision sees beyond the surface, so that it can see the remains of your meal,
just as easily as it can see your fingernails. you can't hide something from a
killer whale just by putting it behind your back !! It can see into you
through your closed fist. The orcas can pinpoint a tumor, exactly, wherever it
is in your body; it can swim around you, and can see it from every possible
angle. It can see your circulatory system, in detail, as well as spot blood
clots and aneurysms. Because it can sense differences in pressure within the
body, it could so also diagnose glaucoma, appendicitis, or inflamed tonsils.
Establishing communication with the orcas will greatly advance all medicine, (
evolved to that point) tremendously; not only because they already possess
incredible diagnostic abilities, but also a sophisticated medical knowledge
that is marine based and hence  totally different from human pharmacology.
Now I will give you some information from Earth Conventional Science; From the
OCT. 15th 1991 issue, dolphins are mentioned. Dr. Samuel Dreiden, President of
Stanford medical institute, says this; "We've known for a long time that
dolphins can sense when a human body is suffering from some ailment or
injury." This group has already enrolled a number of dolphins.
Dr.  Dreiden sees a time when one can go in to swim for an hour or so,
then after you come out, they will communicate your medical problem to a human
physician who would treat you. . . Now, these are my words; "Dolphins have
been known to cure tumors in humans, cause barren women to conceive, help
handicapped children to overcome depression,and they are definitely our
friends, if we would deal friendly with them.

I'll leave you with this saying;  "The first art of being a parent
consists in sleeping when the baby isn't  looking.
