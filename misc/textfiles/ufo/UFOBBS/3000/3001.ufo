UFO show too `bizarre' to convince policeman

Portsmouth, N.H.
When police officer Kevin Semprini was given his assignment to
cover a convention Sunday, he didn't know what he was in for - an
encounter with 500 true believers in aliens, flying saucers and
other unidentified flying objects.
"It's kind of bizarre," said Semprini, watching a slide show about
a giant face on the surface of Mars a speaker said may have been
carved by "ancient astronauts" from Earth or their Martian
ancestors.
"I'd like to believe it . . . but," said the officer.
Semprini was one of the few skeptics in the crowd.
Many of the convention participants, gathered at a restaurant in
Portsmouth for the Third Annual New Hampshire Mutual Unidentified
Flying Object Network conference, embrace the theory mankind has
blundered badly in caring for the Earth and aliens are coming to
take charge.
Roberta Puhalski, 47, of Connecticut said she saw her first
extraterrestrial in 1988. It was making noise in the hallway and
woke her.
"As it approached, I looked out from my waterbed and saw the
figure," said the part-time columnist for the New York City-based
Space Newsletter.
"It had the huge head, very frail frame and overly extended arms,"
she said, adding it was similar to the creatures in the hit
science fiction film Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
