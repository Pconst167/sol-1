             CRYSTAL JACKSON PLANTS NEW IDEAS ON IMPLANTS
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Crystal Jackson, an artist and ufologist, launched into
     statistics about implants.  Her research showed that about
     6% of UFO abductee cases include some kind of implant
     situation.  She also went on to say that in view of the
     progress we have made in the field of implants for heath
     purposes, it is not surprising that aliens would use this
     technology.  Implants small enough to travel through the
     bloodstream for diagnosis and treatment of diseases were
     being developed.  Pacemakers are being refined and made
     smaller.  In the future, implants may be available to
     re-program symptoms of many neuromuscular diseases.
     Presently, scientists are working with applications of
     electrical current to help wheel chair patients to walk
     again.

     Jackson said she was one of those people who never wanted
     to discuss outer space things or aliens.  She would smirk
     when others talked about those things.  When a series of
     events occurred in her life, she did a complete turn
     around.

     Jackson was born in England in 1923.  She states she is a
     Christian scientist, and, as such, never went to doctors,
     yet was always petrified of a needle near her stomach.  She
     said that when she was six years old, she decided to meet
     her piano teacher half-way on the route to her home and
     bicycled on her way.  Later, Jackson was found unconscious
     with a broken nose.  She was not taken to the doctor, but
     it was at that time she became aware of her fear of needles
     near her stomach.  Though she's often had nose bleeds,
     she's not seen any evidence of a nasal implant.

     She was six years old when her family moved form England to
     "the States".

     Jackson stated that an embarrassment she felt during her
     younger years concerning showing her legs in gymnastics
     class is attributable to the scoop marks on the back of her
     legs found by Budd Hopkins during a UFO convention.
     Jackson questioned her mother about the marks but got no
     answers as to their appearance or cause.

     Jackson has spoken to others with these mysterious scoop
     marks.  During a time of UFO sightings in the Ozarks, a
     woman in charge of a camp area discovered scoop marks on
     the back of her legs.

     A friend of Jackson's named Jack used to be a dive master
     in the Bermuda Triangle area.  He, too, has scoop marks of
     unknown origin on his arm.  His scoop marks have no tie to
     UFOs that she knows of.

     Jackson went deeper with her discussion by saying she feels
     she has met two or more aliens.  We were shown a picture of
     an attractive, reportedly tall young man, who Jackson
     believes may be an alien she met in Phoenix, Arizona.  The
     man is reported to be seven feet tall and is in the
     electronics business.  He wears an interesting pendant and
     purports to be from Reticuli.

     Jackson explained that an experience in Wisconsin is what
     ultimately pushed her into Ufology.  During a drive in
     Wisconsin, Jackson experienced a UFO following her car for
     about 10 miles.  Her vehicle finally began exhibiting
     classic vehicle interference symptoms.  Her headlights and
     tail lights went out and her engine stopped.  Afterwards,
     she went to newspaper offices to find many people in
     Wisconsin had reported seeing a UFO that evening.  She
     also found out that some people report the UFO sightings
     had scoop marks on their legs.

     Jackson began photographing both people in Wisconsin and
     others with scoop marks.  She noted that often there is a
     straight line of scar tissue near the scoop.

     Many years after her car experience, Budd Hopkins tried to
     regress her and failed. yet Budd felt that her whole family
     had been under surveillance in an ongoing fashion.

     Marjorie Sherrill added to the talk by reading an article
     to the group concerning the recovery of implants.  One
     involved a woman with UFO experiences sine age five or six.
     One evening a BB-type object came from her nose.  She put
     it in a Kleenex tissue, but when she went for it to show a
     friend she had told about the object, it was gone without a
     trace.

     The other report involved a man named "Al" who experienced
     "missing time". On his arrival home, his wife noticed what
     appeared to be dried blood as well as a wound to his
     temple.  A month later, the man was picking at the sore
     when a crystalline object fell from it.  He said it was
     egg-shaped and looked like quartz crystal.

     Additionally, it was mentioned that the MUFON Deputy
     Director John Schuessler had sent Sherrill some information
     regarding four types of implants:  Cochlear implants (in
     the ear); implants for epilepsy; implants of drugs to
     relieve cramps in muscles of paralysis victims and
     programmable devices to shock the heart back into beating.
