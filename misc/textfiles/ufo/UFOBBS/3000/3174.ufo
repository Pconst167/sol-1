                 Sighting Report 1/27/93
 
Date: The date of the incident was January 24th, 1993. The first
reports came in to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (9-1-1)
at 19:38 hours (7:38 PM). Two Sheriff's deputies were dispatched
to the area to meet with the first man reporting unusual lights
hanging in the sky at 19:39 hours (7:39 PM) to investigate.
 
Location: The area of the Ken Caryl Ranch [located South-West of
the Denver, Colorado metro area] - [centered over the top of the
mountain that is the apparent center of the Ken Caryl West
Ranch]. The primary object (large white intense light) was
estimated to have hovered about 800 to 1000 feet above ground
level. The five small objects (yellow lights) that were also
observed at the same time were located approximately 100 feet
above the ground, below and to the left of the large white
object. 
 
What occurred: The first reports occurred at 19:38 hours when the
public (twelve individuals) reported to the Sheriff's office that
they were seeing "strange lights illuminating their houses". One
person also reported that "someone was causing his
electra/mechanical garage door to keep opening and closing" and
[sic] that his "house was being light up by a bright light from
somewhere" [sic] an unknown source. A woman called for help from
law enforcement officers stating that "someone was shining a
bright light in her windows, and she was scared". A third car in
the area was dispatched. 
 
The first car in the area arrived only a couple of minutes after
the initial call to police. Officer M.S. (93012401.01) was first
observed the primary light from I-470 and Ken Caryl road. This is
approximately 3 miles from the later sightings. He was ordered to
meet with one of the public witnesses at that location. The
witness was not there, because he had not returned yet from his
home where he went to make the call to law enforcement
authorities. Officer M.S. (93012401.01) decided to continue
into the housing area and investigate the "bright light" that he
was observing. He had to drive West about 1/2 a mile to enter the
area through the "Hog Back" (for information: a geological area
that appears like small mountains with a cut through them for the
roadway). For the minute that it took to traverse that distance,
the bright object was out of his field of view. When he cleared
the area of the roadway cut he again regained visual sighting of
the object.
 
The officer proceeded up the road to a better visual vantage
point. He entered the parking lot of the " Bradford Elementary "
school and parked his car. From this position near the base of
the first range of mountains facing West; he and his K-9 partner
exited the police car to better observe the bright object over
the mountain. His dog didn't show any unusual signs as Officer 
M.S. observed the object. At this time Officer M.S. estimated
that the "bright white object was about a half mile away"
(West-North-West). The officer stated that he estimated that the
object was about 12 feet in diameter. And that it was about as
bright as looking into a high intensity flood light from close
proximity as compared to star light which is extremely dim by
comparison. {NOTE: One needs to know that this housing area is in
a very small valley that shields light and noise from Denver to
the North-East. When we (the investigative teams) have been in
the area at night: you can hear people on the street talking to
each other in a normal voice from several hundred feet away.
There is virtually no ambient light or noise in the area.}
Officer M.S. stated that during the whole 40+ plus minutes that
he was able to observe any or all of the lights; that there
was no sound associated with the objects.
 
Officer M.S. returned to his car and was contacted by other
officers that had also moved into the area and could also see the
lights over the mountains. A police supervisor who could see the
primary object, drove around the mountain to the back (Western)
side of the Ken Caryl West Ranch. It took him about an hour to
work his way to a point where he could again observe the area
above the housing area. Due to the time necessary to get to that
location, he was never able to see the bright white object again.
 
Officers engaged in discussion about the objects over the police
radio for about 40 minutes. Jefferson County Sheriff's
dispatchers contacted the Air Traffic Control Tower at Stapleton
Airport. Controllers there said that they could see the object
clearly from the control tower approximately 20 miles distant.
But stated that the object was too low to be observed by radar
due to the "ground clutter" caused by the reflectivity of the
earth surface. They contacted Centennial Airport tower. Personnel
there couldn't see it. Buckley Air Force Base tower (East of
Stapleton Airport) stated that they could see a light, but didn't
know what it was. They denied that any military aircraft were in
the area or working near the area. Norad Air Defense Command in
Colorado Springs was called. Controllers there stated that they
couldn't identify any airborne object above that area. They also
stated that they were unaware of any military aircraft that might
be operation high over the area. {They cannot "see" down close to
the ground there except by looking down by satellite.}
 
Commercial aircraft continued to fly an evening landing approach
to Stapleton near to the area without abetment. The tower from
Stapleton asked a couple of the landing aircraft if they had
observed anything flying close to the ground in the area with a
bright light, however they stated that they hadn't seen any
aircraft.
 
Officer M.S. changed his position several times, noting that the
primary light had now been joined by 5 small yellow lights that
were very low over the mountain, and to the South of the central
object. He noted that the lights would disappear for a minute or
so just as if someone had turned off a light switch. Then they
would come on again suddenly.
 
The atmosphere was clear with a visibility of a hundred miles
that night. No clouds were in the area, high or low.
Officer M.S. had a very clear view during
most of the 40+ plus minutes that he drove around the area or
observed from the side of the road. He stated that there was
never any noise observed during the incident; humming, turbine
sounds, blade sounds that are made by helicopters nor engine
sounds from any engine associated with the incident. All was very
quiet. The only occasional noise was associated with aircraft
that were approaching Stapleton Airport. He further stated that
he didn't see any "beams going down to the ground, or anything
like that". The lights didn't appear to move, flicker, change in
intensity, or maneuver in any erratic fashion. The only unusual
phenomenon observed was that the lights would blink out for a few
seconds; then reappear in about the same place a few seconds
later. This occurred while the officer was outside his patrol
car, within 3/4 of a mile of the light, and not moving. This
effect was observed by all of the officers except the police
supervisor who drove around the mountain to come up on the object
from the back side.
 
No ill effects were reported either by the officers involved nor
by the reporting public.
 
No physical trace evidence has been found nor is expected to be
found because the objects were not observed actually on the earth
surface.

***PLANETS***
 
MERCURY
The closest planet to the sun is never easy to see.
However, it will be in the early evening western sky from early
February to early March, from the last week in May to the first
week in July, and from the second week in September through
October. It will be in the pre-dawn eastern sky between mid-March
and the first week of May, the last week in July through the
third week in August, and mid-November through mid-December.
 
VENUS
Typically this planet is easy to find because it is so
bright. Look for it in the west after sunset from now through the
end of March. It will be in the eastern morning sky from late
April until early December.
 
 
Mars
This month the Red Planet is closest to Earth and the
brightest for the next two years. Although January is the best
month to view, Mars is in the evening sky until the last week in
December, though it will be lost in the glow of the setting sun
some weeks before.
 
The investigation is continuing.

A little more detail on the object scene in the Ken Caryl Ranch area on
Sunday Jan 24 1993.  I myself talked to the sheriff today and he shed a
little more light on a few things.  It was anywhere from 500 to 1000 feet
above the location, also it had a band of yellow lights below the bright
light as well.  Some Investigators from MICAP and ParaNet are as I type are
on there way to look it over and talk to the sheriff about this.  Also NORAD
was contacted to and did not show anything on there radar.  One other
possibility is our skys the past week have been clear and some of the planets
are visible, we are checking out a star chart to see if they had something to
do with being bright and maybe the source of this.  I will keep posting as
more becomes available..
