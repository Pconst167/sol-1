Space aliens are just make-believe, Eddie Hickson's father told him. Years
later, the elder Hickson said those same space aliens would snatched him from
the banks of the Pascagoula River in Jackson County and took him on board
their dome-shaped craft. Charles Hickson Sr., a modest Gautier man and a
retired shipfitter foreman at Ingalls Shipyard, told a crowd of about 200
conventioneers at the Great Gulf Coast UFO Gathering in Biloxi about the day
that changed his life. Hickson, now 59, and fellow shipfitter Calvin Parker
were fishing at an abandoned shipyard Oct. 11, 1973. "All of the sudden I
heard some kind of hissing sound like steam leaking out of a pipe," Hickson
said. "I saw some kind of craft hovering about 18 inches about the ground. I
didn't know what to do. It appeared round with a dome on top and there were
two blue pulsing lights on what appeared to be its front. A door opened and a
very brilliant light came out, then three things came out and two of'em took
ahold of me and one took Calvin. When the one took hold of my left arm, it
hurt, and then I didn't feel anything but my eyes. They were about 5-foot,
6-inches tall and they had elephant-like skin, grey and very wrinkled. The
skin ran horizontal. Their arms were very long in proportion to the rest of
their bodies." His book, UFO Contact in Pascagoula, may soon be made into a
movie. Once the beings released him inside the craft, Hickson became
suspended in midair and watched an electronic eye come out of the craft's
wall, scan his body, then retract into the wall. After hypnosis unlocked his
subconscious, Hickson recalled the faces of three male human-looking beings,
who observed the examination from behind a window. "I kept wondering what
they were going to do to me. They glanced at my eyes; then they carried me
back and out through the brilliant light and put me down on the ground.
Calvin was lying there on the river bank, his arms outstretched, and he
seemed to be going into shock. I had to slap him and scream at him to get his
attention," said Hickson, a Jones County native and Army veteran of the
Korean War. Parker now lives in south Louisiana and has suffered two nervous
breakdowns since the incident. Fearing they'd be labeled insane, Hickson and
Parker considered keeping their experience a secret, but reported it to the
Jackson County Sheriff's Dept. that night. Since that eerie evening, the
aliens have communicated with Hickson telepathically. Rubbing a flat, gray,
quarter-sized object, Hickson explained that the disc heats up before he
receives telepathic messages. Hickson's undergone numerous psychological
evaluations. "I know these things sound very strange and I don't expect you
to believe them, but I hope one day you will." Eddie Hickson, 36, has never
thought his father was insane. He's watched him turn down handsome cash
offers for his story over the years, fearing people would think it a hoax.
"I know in my heart and my mind that daddy didn't make this up."
