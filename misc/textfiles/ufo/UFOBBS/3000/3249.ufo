SUBJECT: FORTY WITNESSES                                     FILE: UFO3249







The following information is provided as general information
regarding the UFO phenomena. Although it is very unusual there is
substantial evidence to verify it as true and there are at least
forty individuals who witnessed various integral components of the
incident. The incident really did occur and the fallout of the
incident continues to plague those individuals involved. 

We will not reveal certain details about the incident because we
respect the integrity and privacy of certain individuals involved,
however if any person who has accessed this file investigates this
incident they will find all the necessary corroborating information
to verify this document. We warrant that the events outlined in
this document are absolutly genuine and we challenge interested
individuals to investigate the details of the following chronicle
of events and discover for themselves that the mysterious episode
is absolutly true.

Finally, it is not our intention to provide any assistance or
direction to individuals who may be interested in investigating
this incident further. We should note that we have provided the
information in such a way that only a professional and astute
investigator could authenticate the truth for the themselves. It is
not our intention to provide any information to the casual
researcher of unusual phenomena. The evidence is so explicitly
indisputable that to offer any supporting facts for this case would
make any third party investigations pointless. In other words, the
witnesses, the evidence etc. is all there. We know it's true. It's
up to you to prove it to yourself.

The incident is as follows :

In the fall of 1990 in a city east of Toronto, Canada a motion
picture went into production. In the months during extensive pre-
production planning and development certain individuals within the
corporation had been contacted by an informant who had certain
information about UFOS.

The company had been contacted because it was rare that a motion
picture was being produced in the generally uneventful area.
Because the informant felt that certain individuals connected with
the production might be able to uncover certain facts about the UFO
phenomena. The rationale was obvious, film people were interested
in anything and generally open minded. 

The informant instructed an individual from the film company to
meet them on a highway near a park. It was there, the informant
said, that documents and photographs would be provided that would
prove that aliens were visiting the planet and that abductions were
happening on a wide scale. The film company executive was very busy
conducting business and was unable to meet the informant other
individuals in the corporation also urged him to go. The film
company executive also had certain apprehensions about a cliche'
clandestine meeting with a stranger. Especially a stranger that
believed in such ridiculous speculation.
During the production of a motion picture there is a great deal of
off time where there really isn't much else to do but socialize and
talk. On one particular occassion the film company executive
revealed to some newly hired members of the crew that he had been
contacted by a very strange person who claimed to have information
regarding UFOS. One of the crew members expressed an interest in
contacting the individual and with the burden of pre-production
over, the executive, E.P, agreed that it might prove entertaining.

The crew member arranged to meet the informant at a "chip truck"
where they could discuss the information and receive copies of the
supposed evidence. While the crew member was away picking up the
information, Original Guardian received a phone call from someone
who identified himself as BOGEYMAN. There were individuals within
the corporation who had ties to the Canadian Federal Government but
it is doubted that those ties attracted the phone call to Original
Guardian.

Original Guardian was an executive with the motion picture and well
informed from E.P about the current UFO amusement. The phone call
was short. The caller insisted that if any leads regarding UFOS
were investigated or if a film resulted from any information that
was being received then the corporation would suffer severely. The
caller said that the entire production would be shut down and that
there would be a great financial loss if the company continued to
investigate UFOS.

Original Guardian informed E.P about the phone call but he didn't
consider it anything to worry about. He was more concerned about
the production of the movie and the quickly approaching winter
weather. E.P didn't worry that is until the end of October. 

It was rumoured amongst the crew that E.P had been abducted by
aliens before and he did have an unusual perfectly round scar on
his body that could not be explained. Nor could he explain some of
his other unusual supernatural experiences but he took it all in
stride. Until the end of October when the office noticed that he
had unexpectantly seemed to vanish from the city completely.

A production meeting had been called and E.P was nowhere to be
found. It was rumoured he was with Original Guardian discussing
finance but Original Guardian knew the truth. E.P had been
approached by an individual who had documented evidence of alien
encounters which included photographs, videotape and other
miscellaneous upsetting evidence. A young woman at a camera store
who was snooping at the collection of photograph's that E.P had
submitted for duplication was noticibly upset by the images
recorded on the film. Her exact words were,"What is that thing in
the photograph? What is it?" 

It was a photograph of what seemed to show an alien being and it
was unconditionally not a man in a suit. It should be noted that
the film was not a science fiction film. The figure in the
photograph was anatomically impossibly a human in a costume. A
slight blur in the upper body indicated it was moving when the
photograph was taken thereby eliminating the possibility of a
static figure. 

Numerous meetings occured in secret between E.P, Original Guardian
and the second informant. As promised by the threatening phone call
that Original Guardian received from BOGEYMAN the motion picture
was destroyed. The corporation was in ruin. Every prophesy that
BOGEYMAN had promised came to pass. Certain individuals had been
planted inside the corporation to destroy the production as
promised by the threatening phone call. Actor's in the film started
noticing unusual marks on their bodies and missing time. Behavior
among the producers, talent and crew at times almost resembled
paranoid schizophrenia. Once the pandora's box had been opened
virtually no individual involved with the motion picture had not
been cursed in some way.

The following is a list of some of the tribulation experienced by
the production that resulted from the exposure to the UFO material
and individuals who claimed to affiliated with subversive UFO
activities:
1. E.P became financially ruined, alcoholic and lost over eighty
pounds. He has not worked since. Only recently has he not come to
dread being abducted by aliens.
2. Original Guardian suffered from uncontrolable rages and wanted
to kill E.P. He also has not worked since. He continues to fear
being abducted.
3. Deaths occured during production that are statistically
improbable.
4. Strange illnesses and paranoia plagued certain members of the
crew.
5. Some persons involved with the production became so irrational
and paranoid that they were having hallucinations and feared they
were being monitored by something.
6. A certain actor was afraid to sleep after waking one morning and
discovering an unusual mark on his throat. He became mentally
unstable and alcoholic and has not worked in the film industry
since.
7. The motion picture could not be completed because of the
hysteria caused by the exposure to the UFO material and BOGEYMAN.
With the conspicuous maniacal jinx as promised by BOGEYMAN,
virtually no one with the production was able to continue working.

The aforementioned is just a sample of the unusual and strange
phenomena that plagued the production.  

It is obvious that a great many details have been left from this
narrative. On the surface some of the pitfalls that struck the
individuals involved with the production might seem ordinary or
even funny but only because we were unable to provide detail to
this account. There is a great deal of information surrounding this
case and the slightest investigation will reveal it all to be
agonizingly true. Naturally we could not elaborate on a great many
details because to do so, would open the individuals involved to
great deal of scrutiny and further anguish. This is truly a case
where lives have been destroyed by the UFO phenomena and three
years later the aftermath of the curse on the production and the
individuals directly involved continues.
