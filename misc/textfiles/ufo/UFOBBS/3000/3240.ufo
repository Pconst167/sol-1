DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE COLLECTIVE SELF-ESTEEM

For any of this to go forward, it is essential that we address the question of
how humans view themselves, and how the human race is viewed, by humans, as
a whole. How many times do we read in the UFO literature the word "superior"
in reference to the extraterrestial beings currently visiting earth. And how
often have we heard theologians and others indicate that we humans are the
only beings that really matter in this universe so grand! Both of these
extreme views - that of innate human inferiority and that of innate human
uniqueness and divine superiority - are dangerous distortions of the collective
appropriate self-esteem needed for a healthy ETI-Human long term relationship.

On the question of ETI superiority, we must make a distinction between
possessing more advanced technology or even more developed intellectual
abilities, and actual superiority as beings. Were the Europeans who possessed
greater technology superior AS PEOPLE to the Native Americans which they
found here? Certainly not! And is a MIT scientist with an IQ of 160
superior as a person to a wood craftsman with an IQ of 100? No! To state
that a race or people possess more advanced technology or social systems is
not to say that they are superior beings. On the other hand, it is
equally true that if their values and attributes vary from 20th century
human values and attributes then they are not inferior beings either. We
must be careful not to repeat the old mistake which humans have made with each
other: confusing sameness with equality. Both between two individuals and
between two peoples from two different planets we will find variation,
difference and strengths and weaknesses; this does not mean that one is
superior or inferior to the other, only that they are DIFFERENT. Our
equality as beings is founded in the fact that both humans and extraterrestial
beings are conscious, intelligent sentient creatures. Conscious Intelligence
is both our point of equality and our point of unity; it is the basis for
the relationship itself. If we look to our point of unity, we will discover
delight. While we must avoid the arrogance and chauvinism which has
characterized human relationships, we must also avoid a sense of inferiority
or worthlessness based simply on greater ETI technology or even intelligence.
For there is more to the life of a conscious intelligent being than IQ and
material advancement. WHile exhibiting geuine humility where warranted, we
must maintain the appropriate sense of collective self-esteem born out of
the realization that to be human is to be conscious, awake, intelligent and
self-aware, just as every other being in the universe is conscious, awake,
intelligent and self-aware. Beyond this it is entirely likely that humans may
have as much to offer to the development and enlightenment of ETI as the other
way around. If we are to gallop out steed into this arena, then mutual
respect and self-respect are required, not puffed up arrogance or cowering
inferiority. The strict materialist model of looking only to things and
differences, of endless reductionism and fragmentation, will assure us only
confusion, consternation and loss. We must be wise, and perceive the whole,
while yet discerning the distinctions. Our vision must be clear, for it alone
can be the foundation of our success. We must learn to see with the eye of
oneness, for in a universe so diverse we shall be lost without it. To be human
is wonderful: It is to be consacious, intelligent, loving and aware. And what
is wonderful about being human is what is wonderful about being any intelligent
being in the universe; this, let us share.

THE CE-5 INITIATIVE PRINCIPLES

DEFINITION: CE-5 is a term describing a 5th category of close encounters with
Extraterrestial Intelligence(ETI), characterized by mutual, bilateral
communication rather than unilateral contact. The CE-5 Initiative has as its
central focus bilateral ETI-Human communication based on mutual respect and
universal principles of exchange and contact. CE types 1-4 are essentially
passive, reactive and ETI initiated; CE-5 is distinguished from these by
conscious, voluntary and proactive human initiated or cooperative contacts with
ETI. Evidence exists indicating that CE-5's have successfully occurred in the
past, and the inevitable maturing of the human/ETI relationship requires
greater research and out-reach effort into this possibility. While ultimate
control of such contact and exchange will (and probably should) remain with
the technologically more advanced intelligent life forms (i.e. ETI) this does
not lesses the importance of conscientious, voluntayr human initiatives,
contact and follow-up to conventional CE's type 1-4.

CORE PRINCIPLES AND PREMISES OF THE CE-5 INITIATIVE

1. ETI and Extraterrestial Transports (UFOs) have been and currently are in
contact with human society.

2. ETI has a net peaceful, benign and probably protective motive for the
relationship with humanity at this time.

3. The CE-5 Initiative is proactive, bilaterally communicative and
multidisciplinary in nature and is not primarily motivated towards the current
acquisition of ETI technology, except as mutually permitted by the ETI-Human
relationship.

4. ETI's enigmatic and elusive behavior may be understood as human-protective
when viewed from their perspective; a wartorn, aggressive, nuclear armed and
disunified earth civilization must not receive further potentially harmful
technologies until a lasting world peace and unity is achieved, and
international human goals become peaceful, cooperative, and unified in nature.
Such a transformation will then indicate the readiness for a fuller contact and
exchange between humans and ETI. We must respect and accept ETI's control and
wisdom in this regard.

5. Notwithstanding the protective limits mentioned above, ETI is apparently
desirous of an expanded contact with humans, and is open to voluntary, human
initiated contact and exchange. There is strong evidence to suggest that ETI
has been systematically introducing themselves to human civilization for the
past 45 years or longer, and that such contact has steadily deepened and
intensified over this period.

6. CE-5 communication based in a paradigm of love, unity, non-violence,
cooperation and shared interests has been and will continue to be most
effective.

7. in addition to point number 4 above, we may expect a certain limited nature
to ETI contact so that the disruptive potential of such contact will be
minimized. Certainly, a massive influx of ETI culture, technology, etc. would
prove harmful to long term human evolution if said influx was sudden or ill-
timed. Though the exact limits as human civilization evolves and grows in peace
and unity, or at times of significant world-wide crisis.

8. All CE-5 Initiative contact will be for the benefit of all of humanity (as
well as ETI) and will not redound to the benefit of only one nation or
culture. This is essential.

9. All CE-5 Initiative contact will be free of hostile intent, and will be
free of the presence of any and all weaponry, defensive or offensive.

10. All CE-5 Initiative contact will be shared with all CE-5 Associates to the
extent possible. The CE-5 Initiative will cooperate with all other UFO/ETI
research organizations so long as such groups are credible and have non-
harmful and peaceful procedures and intentions.

11. Both humans and ETI have physical and mental/spiritual aspects to their
reality and contact and communication will proceed on all levels of our shared
reality.

12. The CE-5 Initiative affirms that humans and ETI, as conscious beings, are
essentially more alike than dissimiliar. Regardless of how different we may
externally or physically appear, the reality og humans as conscious and
intelligent beings establishes the common basis for communication, deeper and
bilateral contact, and mutual self-respect.

13. Our embryonic efforts now will have ramifications throughout the next
millenium and should therefore be undertaken with all due deliberation, vision
and integrity. Our goals, methodology and conduct are oriented towards a
broad-based long-term endevor.

14. The primary model for communication and exchange, as well as internal
communication within the CE-5 Initiative, is that of consultation and respect
for the views of others.

15. The most important charactersitics, required of CE-5 Initiative
participants are honesty, open-mindedness, intuitive ability, good
communication skills and trustworthiness. Technical skills and academic
credentials are certainly valued, but the above qualities are primary. CE-3
and 4 contactees are especially encouraged to participate as research
associates. Participant confidentially will be assured if requested. In
addition, CE-5 Initiative Core Groups will ideally have participants expert
or competent in:
    1. Medicine/Physiology
    2. Physics, Theoretical and Applied
    3. Psychology/Counseling
    4. Higher mental/spiritual functions(e.g. meditation, telepathy)
    5. Communications and Electronics
    6. Public Relations
    7. Research/Documentation, including video, audio and print
    8. Astronomy and Astrophysics
    9. Sociology and Anthropology

16. CE-5 Initiative Core Groups will work with ongoing research efforts to
maximize our collective knowledge and data base. Current and ongoing CE 1-4
sites/locales or individuals will especially be integrated into CE-5 strategic
planning.

17. CE-5 Initiative Projects, training and results will be shared through
conferences, symposia, and publications.

18. The activities of the CE-5 Initiative will maintain high standards of
conduct and professionalism, while preserving an atmosphere of open-mindedness
and creative 'brainstorming.' Anyone found to be spreading misinformation or
falsified cases intentionally will be prohibited from participating in any of
the activities of the CE-5 Initiative.

19. We hold that carefully planned Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind will
unlock new frontiers in the relationship between ETI and humanity. All
sincere researchers and theorists are welcome to join in this profound
endeavor on behalf of mankind's growth and evolution.

ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF THE CE-5 WORKING GROUP PARTICIPANT

The goal of the CE-5 Initiative is nothing less that the establishment of a
voluntary, mutually beneficial relationship between humans and those
extraterrestial people currently visiting earth. We have neither been
appointed nor outworldly selected to engage in so high an endeavor. Rather,
we have voluntarily come forward driven by an interest at once sublime and
urgent. As important as individual skills and capabilities may be such an
undertaken, they are nevertheless secondary to the consciousness and attitudes
of the individual and the group.

Personal integrity, honesty, selflessness, harmlessness, peacefulness,
patience, acceptance of diversity, courage, unity, maturity, a reasoned but
open mind, the ability to maintain confidentiality - these qualities must rank
pre-eminently among those needed by CE-5 Initiative Working Group participants.
For if we are skilled but selfish, we shall fail to succeed; if we are
knowledgeable but aggressive, our efforts will be in vain; if we are curious
but fearful, we will not be able to endure. We cannot expect to be saints,
but at the same time, a specific consciousness and attitude are required if
success is to be realized.

Basic to all these qualities is purity of motive and the essential condition of
being free from prejudice and malice. Those who are familiar with 'UFOlogy'
will know that this is no mean feat, insofar as there is a virtual epidemic of
fear, paranoia and wild and frightening speculations infecting the UFO/ETI
field. Subjective and reactionary interpretations of certain UFO related
events have spawned a cottage industry of those exponents of conspiracies,
goblins, good and evil E.T.s, Star Wars-type encounters and so on. This
poisonous and insidious millieu has expanded to encompass countless books and
organizations, and is slowing growing colonies of fear and paranoia in
innumerable minds and hearts. So pervasive is this attitude that some of the
individuals who claim to be most scientific and objective routinely use
words such as 'alarming', 'sinister', 'intruders', 'victims', 'deception', and
even 'rape' and 'murder' when describing UFO occupants and their interactions
with humans. It is little wonder that impartial observers consider many UFO
'buffs' to be kooks, crackpots or worse. There is a super-abundance of
emotionality, hyper-religiosity and superstition, and only a nominal amount
of seasoned analysis and sane yet visionary planning.

In this environment of fear and near hysteria, it is a challenge to the
conscientious. There is a tendency for students of UFOlogy to become colonized
by these fear-engendering ideas, and view this phenomenon through the darkened
visor of negativity. GOing beyond this fear and remaining free of these
negative prejudices is an essential condition which all CE-5 Initiative
Working Group participant must achieve. Our position, which is clear and
unequivocal, is that all extraterrestial people are to be regarded as non-
hostile and approachable. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest otherwise,
and until clearly PROVEN otherwise, our position is firm. Clearly, anyone who
holds one group of extraterrestials as 'good' and another as 'bad', and so on,
is wholly unsuited for this endeavor. To be so prejudiced is to subvert the
entire purpose of our mission, which is the establishing of a peaceful
relationship with any and all extraterrestial people visiting earth. In this
regard, we make no distinction between the so-called 'greys' and the so-called
Nordic types, or any other group for that matter. It is clear from
multiple case reports that these various groups are involved with a cooperative
project regarding earth and her people, and it is dangerous and unwarranted
to hold prejudiced views towards one group or the other. That one group or
the other is associated with certain activities is, we feel, a specialized
function of the overall cooperative effort currently under way. We must
remember that human perceptions of actions must not be confused with true
extraterrestial motives, and to reach prejudiced and negative conclusions based
on these fragmented perceptions is dangerous, premature and unproductive.

While every person is certainly entitled to his or her own opinions, it is the
uncompromising policy of CSETI at this time that no person holding such
negative and prejudicial views will be allowed to participate in CE-5
Initiative Working Group activities. The reasons for this are more than merely
philosophical: It is evident that these extraterrestial beings are capable
of assessing the views, attitudes and intentions of both the Working Groups and
their individual members. For any member to hold negative and prejudicial views
towards one or any other group of extraterrestial people may very well result
in the failure of the CE-5 Initiative protocols and all group endeavors. That
is, one member of a group holding such views may result in the failure of the
entire project, insofar as the extraterrestial people may feel both
unwelcome and unsafe in approaching the group. Nor should we arrogate to
ourselves the right to 'pick and choose' among various extraterrestial
peoples, anymore than we should 'pick and choose' prejudicially among various
races of human; all such prejudices are offensive and unenlightened, and
must be overcome.

To be free from prejudice is a significant challenge for many people. For CE-5
Initiative Working Group Participants, it is an essential requirement and
not an optional one. Let us free ourselves from the fancy, fiction and fear
which abounds, and hold to a higher vision, above fear, free from negative
preconceived ideas. Let us be visionary and creative, but grounded;
courageous but not foolish; open-minded but not gullible; analytical but not
fragmented or cynical; intelligent and yet loving. Our task calls for nothing
less, and our success is dependent on our arising to such inner standards
that no rumor or fear can defeat.

Peace be with you.
