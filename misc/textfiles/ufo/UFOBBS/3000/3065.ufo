                Strange Circumstances Surround Tavern Brawl

     Several  city  police officers responding to a call  to  aid
     members  of  the Navy Shore Patrol in breaking up  a  tavern
     brawl near the U.S. Navy docks here last night got something
     of  a  surprise when they arrived on the scene to  find  the
     place  empty  of  customers. According to  a  pair  of  very
     nervous  waitresses, the Shore Patrol had arrived first  and
     cleared  the place out - but not before two of  the  sailors
     involved  allegedly did a disappearing act. "They just  sort
     of  vanished into thin air...right there," reported  one  of
     the  frightened  hostesses,  "and  I  ain't  been   drinking
     either!" At that point, according to her account, the  Shore
     Patrol  proceeded  to hustle everybody out of the  place  in
     short order.

     A  subsequent  chat with the local police precinct  left  no
     doubts  as to the fact that some sort of general  brawl  had
     indeed  occurred in the vicinity of the dockyards  at  about
     eleven  o'clock  last night, but  neither  confirmation  nor
     denial  of  the  stranger  aspects of  the  story  could  be
     immediately obtained. One reported witness succinctly summed
     up  the affair by dismissing it as nothing more that "a  lot
     of hooey from them daffy dames down there," who, he went  on
     to say, were probably just looking for some free publicity.

     Damage to the tavern was estimated to be in vicinity of  six
     hundred dollars.

Patric  Macey, an electronic specialist and  researcher  recounts
this story told to him by another worker called Jim in 1977:
                                                        - UFO Joe

     "I was a guard for classified audiovisual material, and late
     in 1945 I was in a position, while on duty in Washington, to
     see part of a film viewed by a lot of Navy brass, pertaining
     to  an  experiment done at sea...it showed two  other  ships
     feeding some sort of energy into the central ship...After  a
     time the central ship, a destroyer, disappeared slowly  into
     a  transparent  fog  until all that could  be  seen  was  an
     imprint of that ship in the water. Then, when the field,  or
     whatever it was, was turned off, the ship reappeared  slowly
     out of a thin fog...Somebody mentioned an incident where one
     of  the crewmen apparently disappeared while drinking  in  a
     bar.  Somebody else commented that the crew were 'still  not
     in  their  right minds, and may never be.' There  were  also
     some  references  to  some  of  the  crew  having   vanished
     permanently."
