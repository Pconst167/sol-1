The driving force behind UFO Photo Archives, Wendelle Stevens, personally investigates reportedly significant ET contacts. When his investigations satisfy his own requirements for authenticity and significance, a book is produced.  The books contain direct quotes from the contactee and eyewitnesses with only limited comments from the publisher. They are published with the intent of reporting the interactions between Earth humans and ET's. The goal of proving ET activity on Earth is clearly secondary. This is a slight but significant difference. If you are looking for hard undeniable proof then you are going to find yourself up against the purposes of the ETs themselves (although evidence of such proof is possible to find within these books). 

To try and explain this you must develop some understanding of the ET situation. It will simplify things to divide ETs into two major groups:

Group 1 - ETs in service to themselves. Such do not make significant contacts - contacts where information is exchanged. Such contacts would appose their aims.

Group 2 - ETs in service to others.  Within this file I am referring only to the activities of this Group of ETs.

Neither group is interested in proving the possibility of interstellar space travel. Group 2 knows that this would encourage Earth humans to spread our style of society and philosophy. This style they find to be horrible. Perhaps they have been watching too much of our TV. Group 1 realizes that they will lose their ability to take advantage of us if we start to develop beyond certain understandings.

Group 2 is primarily interested in inspiring our spiritual awareness. More precisely the acceptance of metaphysics and the acknowledgment of the "higher-self". They wish us to learn and explore through the use of this higher-self and thus make the cognitions and intuitive jumps that are necessary for a civilization to truly move forward. This will not only advance our technology but will move us away from our false spiritual and scientific philosophies. 

For the ETs to allow themselves to be proven to exist will retard our striving for understanding. It is the striving for understanding, not knowledge, that will cause us to develop the spiritual awareness that they consider so important. 

If you understand what I am trying to say then you will realize why you need to immerse yourself in the experiences of the contactees and "feel" for yourself their validity. Reading brief summaries from the news media will only result in being mislead. Looking for some singular piece of evidence to hang your scientific hat upon will only yield frustration (this is by ET design). You must search and ponder or you will not *develop* significant awareness of the ET situation.
