Canada's Abduction Scene

From UFO Magazine Vol. 8, No. 1, 1993

Abduction matters in Canada are being researched by UFO Research
Institute of Canada, which submits the following report.

In a survey taken by UFORIC of individuals calling in to our hotline
(reports of genuine unidentified objects) from 1989-1992 it was found
that:

1:  40 percent of the witnesses had a near or distant relative in the
    armed forces (land, sea or air).

2:  68 percent were females and 32 percent were male.

3:  15 percent had mixed or pure Native Indian blood.

4:  12 percent were of Welsh or Basque heritage.

5:  35 percent showed classic symptoms of abduction, including
    indications of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, standard poltergeist
    activity and physical anomalies. (Psychologial questioning by
    seasoned investigators filtered out erroneous claims.)

6:  Abductions were uncovered within a 5-10 day period after a clearly
    identified UFO wave; this occurred on eleven seperate occasions.

7:  Phenomena which I have coined UBMs or "Unidentified Body Markings"
    appear in 60 percent of our abduction cases, and are being
    catalogued by our institute. Some resemble crop circles formations.
    We feel there may be a connection. Many are not visible under normal
    light conditions but can be easily seen under a flourescent tube
    ultraviolet lamp. Althought a dermatologist could easily explain
    away the skin lesions, bruises and burn marks, the shape and time
    sequencing of the appearance of these marks in relation to
    visitations, abductions and sightings in the subject's life suggest
    that some of them may be externally induced by an outside
    intelligence. I base this judgement on abductee journal notations
    (which I encourage) as well as repetitive and almost cyclical
    incidents.

8:  Fifteen percent of our abduction cases uncovered the fact that
    hydroelectric power substations or power grids were located either
    directly on the property of the abductee or within several hundred
    feet.
    One recent case were are working with involves a young Native
    American lady who contacted our institute when she began remembering
    her encounters. Several weeks after speaking with us, she became
    pregnant although her physician said her chances wee less than 5
    percent. She also reported a helicopter harassing and intimidating
    her by flying low over her apartment building. I believe the intent
    may have been to indicate to her that she move away from the
    dangerous electromagnetic fields which could injure the fetus.

9:  We have observed that many of the abductees with whom we work have
    an acute electromagnetic sensitivity. This extends to what may be
    early detection of earthquake activity. Long range plans are to
    clarify and structure incoming data from reports on a type of "early
    warning" call-in system we have set up.

10: Some of the abductees report a sort of numbness underneath parts of
    their skin, sometimes going deeply into muscle tissue as if novocane
    had been injected. Electrical voltages or "currents" are also
    reported with this anomaly. Changes appear to have been introduced
    into the nervous system. More cases, cataloguing and medical
    assistance will be required before we can draw any conclusions about
    these reports.

11: Many of the abductions occurred during a period of low, dark and
    fast-moving cloud cover with barometer pressure at readings between
    99.8-101.5 k.p.a.., and within a five-day period approaching the
    full moon. A security man tells us he witnessed a disc-shapped
    object in the center of a fast-moving dark cloud that had a "hose"
    attached to it which was expelling black smoke. This witness was
    convinced that a UFO was creating the cloud.

12: Some abductees have reported to me instances where they were
    subjected to low-frequency tones resembling the emissions of
    electrical dental tools or violent  physical vibrations of a table
    or against a platform. Some have expressed that such tones or
    virbrations were used to condition the victims against developing or
    evolving in certain ways, to prevent them from discovering weapons,
    technology or defense mechanisms which could be used against the
    "abductors" at some future time. OThers have reported that such
    techniques have been used to prevent some people from having a child
    (possibly for similar reasons).

13: We have observed that many people experience out-of-season, flu like
    symptoms within two to five days after their abductions. This could
    be one way to mask  side effects of possible nasal implantations,
    distracting the conscious mind away form the effects of such
    anamalous medical intrusions with what is typically and easily
    understood cause for any residual pain and otrher abnormal,
    uncomfortable symptoms.
