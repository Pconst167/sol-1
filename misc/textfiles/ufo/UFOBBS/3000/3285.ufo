Vangard Note...

Robert Lazar  is  a  physicist  who  claims  to have worked at a secret
government lab in the Arizona  desert area known as Area-51 or  Dreamland.  
Lazar claims to have seen several  types  of discoid craft, some which he
believes to be of alien origin.

In a  videotape done by an Arizona television station with Lazar and on the
UFO mystery in regard  to  Area-51, Lazar claims that the craft are powered by
an element 115.  He further claims that it not  only  provides  tremendous 
amounts of  energy  but  can produce an anti-gravitational field.

Element 115  does not occur in nature (on Earth at least) but is believed to
be extant in a star of sufficient density.  In other words, the only way one
could  collect  element  115 would be to scoop it out of a Sun.

There are   several  puzzling  bits  of  information   in   this particular
case  and the element 115 has given rise to even more speculation.  We have a
copy  of  the  videotape  and it shows a model (non-working) to show the
construction of  the device that Lazar claims uses the element 115.

Many other  questions  arise  from this particular case but they follow the
standard UFO trend  of  very  difficult  to  prove or otherwise verify.  For
that reason, we here at  KeelyNet  do not wish to  spend time better directed
towards energy or levitation or medical subjects with more basis in fact. 
However, this file deals with speculations of an  interesting  nature in areas
that KeelyNet does investigate, i.e. the elements, their  uses  and a
suspected harmonic relationship.

                 SOME BASIC PHYSICS ON ELEMENT CREATION
          (With a view toward the Robert Lazar UFO Revelations)

The Big Bang  apparently  created  only  three  elements.  They were Hydrogen,
Helium and maybe Lithium,  and  probably  some isotopes of these three like
Deuterium, an isotope of Hydrogen.

Present theory is  that  the "explosion" which also created time and space was
too rapid to create more heavier elements.  Those theories explain very well
the observed abundances of Hydrogen & Helium in the universe today.

When stars finally formed, the second  phase of element creation was started. 
The heat and pressure at the core of stars produces higher and higher
elements.  The energy that the stars emit,  (heat, light, radiation) comes
mainly  from  this elemental fusion reaction at the core.

Iron is the end however.  Because  the  creation  of elements higher than Iron
requires energy input rather than produce  energy  output, no significant
higher elements are created.

The final phase  of  element  creation  occurs  in a supernova.  The energy
concentration is so great that  during the explosion, all the naturally
occurring heavy elements above Iron are created.

This includes the radioactive elements, and almost certainly higher elements
not found naturally on earth.  The reason they are not found on earth is that
they have disappeared through radioactive decay over the 5 billion years the
earth has existed.

As for element 115, it remains a real puzzle.  If it can be created naturally,
then a  supernova explosion would almost  certainly  have created it since
they are likely the most energetic entities in the universe.  If if  couldn't, 
then I seriously doubt that technology, advanced or otherwise, could create
it.

Since the earth is a product of  star  core  synthesis  as  well  as supernova
synthesis, and we find no trace of element  115  here,  we must form one of
the following two conclusions.

     A.   Element 115 cannot be created in supernova explosions which means 
          that it likely does not occur naturally anywhere in the universe.

     B.   Element 115 is much more radioactive  than  Uranium  and  has
          disappeared over the 5 billion year history of the earth.

Conclusion "B" does not necessarily eliminate the use of element 115 in UFO
propulsion.   (I  am trying to give the "Revealers"  all  the slack I can.)  
Recent  "Revelations"  indicated that element 115 is stable inferring that  it
is not  radioactive  and  that  it  occurs naturally in heavy star systems.

To a physicist,  heavy  element  stability  usually  means  that  it doesn't
radioactively decay in minute fractions of a second.  So, it could be
relatively stable, but still radioactive, enough so that it does not occur
naturally on earth.

The only place  that  element 115 would occur would be in the debris of a
recent  supernova.  Recent could  mean  hours  or  millions  of years,
depending on  the  stability  of  the  element.   Heavy  star systems, or
binary stars have no properties that I am aware of that would make them more
likely to contain element 115.  Also, there are no known natural processes
occurring in these systems that could produce element 115.

After the element   is   created   (naturally  in  a  supernova,  or
unnaturally in a lab), "ordinary" weight, heat, and pressure (or lack thereof)
would have absolutely no effect on the element.
