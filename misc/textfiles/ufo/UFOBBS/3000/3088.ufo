I do not know.  It was very difficult to see any real form to the object -
all I recall seeing was the lighting.  It is difficult to describe, but I can
say that while it would be possible to recreate the event on a limited scale,
say on a computer or with some special video machine (maybe a Toaster?), what
I've seen so far on computers doesn't really come close, and this thing was
real and in the sky (not on video)!
 
 >    Could you make out an outline?
 
How so?  What do you mean, make an outline of what I saw?  Probably, but it
would just sort of be where I saw lights.
 
 >    Have you checked with the airport on flights yet?
 
There were probably 12 flights in the area at the time.  The only thing I
could really check at an airport with would be whether or not anyone else saw
this thing.  I do know that it didn't go to Scottsdale Muni, and that there
was a jet overhead heading for Phoenix when I first saw it, and that the
sound of the jet faded as it got further away, and I didn't hear anything
else (like sounds from this thing), but it's tough to say exactly how close
it was.
 
 >    Did it appear to be intelligently controlled?
 
There was no apparant significant winds that would have carried an object or
balloon in so straight a line and at such a speed.
 
 >    Did it make any erratic movements?
 
No, the movement was, in fact, exceptionally smooth, straight, and the turn
that it did make was (as far as I saw it) very clean and smooth.
 
 >    Any estimates on size or distance?
 
Yeah, over the lake about half a mile away and maybe ... well, bigger than a
helicopter, bigger than the AirEvac chopper by maybe twice or three times.

The brightness, clarity, and whiteness of the lights (first seen out of the
corner of my eyes, which makes it look even brighter at night as that makes
you use the rods, or B/W light-detecting nerves, of your eye).  When I
realized the color, number, and way in which the lights flashed, and when my
wife pointed out that it was slowly rotating, I finally realized that it was
not a normal aircraft.
 
 >    Has anyone else come forward to report this?
 
I have not heard reports on this specific object.  There have apparantly been
a few reports of strange craft over the valley in the past few weeks.
 
 >    Do I ask enough questions? <g>
 
Don't think me rude, but ... probably not.  These things have to be looked at
very, very closely and with a subjective, if not jaundiced, eye.  I don't
know what I saw.  If I saw it again and someone said, "Oh, that, it's just a
...", I'd be willing to accept it.  At this point, I do not believe that it
was a normal, prosaic aircraft.  I've been staring at them for years and have
yet to not at first get a little hope in the heart, followed by a, "Oh,
shucks, well, just another jet" or  "Oh, well, that's a helicopter", etc. 
This thing, I kept looking and looking and it never resolved itself into a
normal aircraft I could recognize or into ANYTHING I could recognize.  Even
the bolide I saw, at first I thought it was an aircraft blowing up, then I
realized it was a meteor (bolide, whatever).  Never did it cross my mind that
it was an alien spaceship or whatever, because it wasn't.  I'm still confused
about this thing - I just do not know what it was.
 
Thank you for your interest,
 
Steve
