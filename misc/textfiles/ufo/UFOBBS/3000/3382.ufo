Tucson, Ariz. - Scientists have discovered an aggressive object in space that 
moves at the speed of light and gobbles up stars and planets!

The violent star-eater is a mere 10,000light-years from Earth and experts say 
it's headed toward our sun - possibly with the idea of devouring our entire 
solar system.

"This thing is like nothing I've ever seen," says noted astronomer Dr. Carl 
Jevolin who's studied stellar and planetary phenomena for 20 years.

"At first we thought it was a blck hole- a star that collapses and creates 
strong gravity, sucking other heavenly bodies in and destroying them.

"But now that we've had a chance to observe it for a while we notice lots of 
differences. The main difference is that this object actually goes after stars 
- stalking them for thousands of miles across the universe as a wolf stalks 
its prey.

"Stars are fixed in the heavens and connot 'run,' making them sitting ducks 
for this monstrous thing."

The object was discovered last July by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, a satellite that orbits Earth 
and transmits data to scientist. Dr. Jevolin and others have watched it since 
then and have seen it strike repeatedly.

Experts say it grabs pieces of matter from stars and planets a little at a 
time like a crocodile yanking hunks of flesh off a dead wildebeest.

Dr. Jevolin will not go so far as to say our world will be in danger in the 
near future, but neither will he rule out the possibility.

"It's been traveling at the speed of light," said the respected researcher. 
"At that rate it will take 10,000 years to get here. "But we don't know what 
this thing is so we have no idea how fast it might be capable of moving. It 
could be able to go 10, 100 - even thousands of tmes the speed of light.

"If so, it could be here within months."
