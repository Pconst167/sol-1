A woman in northern Florida went outside her home to photograph her 
grandchildren - and instead captured a UFO on film!

These amazing pictures show a UFO in flight as it streaks across the night 
sky. Florence Dillard, 60, was using an automatic winder and snapped several 
pictures in sequence.

"I couldn't believe my eyes," she says. "I'm snapping shots of the little ones 
at play and the next moment I'm shooting a flying saucer."

She watched the object dart back and forth at an astonishing speed while 
multi-colored lights pulsated, matching its movements through the sky. 

"I didn't even realize what I was doing at first. I guess instinct took over 
when I spotted the streaking lights out of the corner of my eye." Florence had 
been a photo-journalist for an aviation magazine and was practiced at 
photographing swiftly moving objects.

Extraterrestrial

"I had to photograph new jets as they went over my head as quick as can be," 
says Florence.

"I only had a second to get it on film and I did. My reflexes are still quick 
after all these years.

"The objects shot above me like a streak of fire in the sky. After a few 
seconds it dived at high speed and what looked like an electrical charge surge 
round it. Then it flew away and vanished."

After developing the film in her darkroom, Florence handed copies over to her 
son-in-law, Roger Wilson, an astronomer and professor of astrophysics at a 
local college.

Roger studied the photographs closely and believes that the object in the 
series is extraterrestrial.
