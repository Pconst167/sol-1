     Rilla/Sysop: David, do you want to explain the rules?
     David/Moderator: Ummm, could you this first time, please?
     Rilla/Sysop: Sure...in a formal conference, David will be the
             | moderator...
             | he will keep track of whose turn it is to speak...
             | please dont interrupt the speaker and wait until it is your 
             | turn...
             | when you have a question type "?"...
             | David will notice and call on you in turn...
             | if you want, you can type "!" for a comment...
             | you still will be called on in turn...
             | when it is your turn you type your lines followed by elipses...
             | until you are finished.  Then you type "ga" which indicates 
             | that you...
             | are finished and ready to have an answer.  Is this clear for 
             | everyone?
     Tony Alicea: Yes\
     David/Moderator: What's an elipse?
     Tony Alicea: ...
     Rilla/Sysop: Elipses are a series of ...
             | <g>
     David/Moderator: ...OK...ga
     Rilla/Sysop: ok...then Ray will turn on the buffer and we will begin...
             | David> GA
     Tony Alicea: ?
     David/Moderator: ...OK, Tonight I thought we would start with the movie 
             | "Intruders"...
             | ga Tony
     Tony Alicea: You answered the Q. It's about UFO's, The CO?
             | ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Yes, we'll start off with Intruders I think... <g> 
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: I just wanted to say that I thought that it was a very good 
             | movie on the subject, considering it was on prime time TV...
             | I wonder if we will see more and more of this brought into 
             | mainstream. ga
     David/Moderator: It was good indeed, but I'm afraid many people will 
             | consider it science
             | fiction when in reality it is based on true facts from many 
             | people.  I think the biggest
             | problem most people have is admitting abduction scenerios 
             | actually exist...ga
     Tony Alicea: !
     David/Moderator: Tony > ga
     Tony Alicea: *I* have a problem w/abductions. I have read "Close 
             | encounters." by the guy
             | from  Northwestern U., and I find it hard to believe...GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: Abductions are a fact of life.  Too many people have 
             | experienced them...
             | with very REAL physical marks left over to just deny there 
             | existence..
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Many things that are too far outside of the norm people find

             | difficult to believe.  Hopkins makes a point in his book about 
             | the 
             | difficulty...
             | people had after the 2nd world war (even today) or accepting 
             | the Holocost.  This isn't because it wasn't real, but just too 
             | far 
             | outside the normal...GA
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: Ok...
             | I didnt see the program INTRUDERS...
             | but from what I can gather it was basically about abductions...
             | two questions...
             | Did it SAY plainly that these abductions were based on Fact and

             | cite the ...
             | cases?  Also...is it going to be a series or was it a one shot 
             | deal? GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Tony Alicea: !
     David/Moderator: OK...
             | It did cite, at the beginning and end of the movie, that 
             | the movie based on more than ONE....
             | account, in fact several, and had been put into movie form.  It
             | was just a one shot deal, from...
             | what I can gather.  No, it did not cite any specific cases, 
             | from what I could see...
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Rilla,  I would highly suggest reading the book 
             | 'Intruders'...
             | I think most books are better than movies, anyway.  Also, the 
             | book is a nonfictional account of the UFO experiences...
             | of several people.  The names have been changed to protect 
             | privacy, but this stuff is real, it has been brought back...
             | using hypnotic regression. GA
     Rilla/Sysop: !
     David/Moderator: Tony > ga
     Tony Alicea: Thanks,
             | ...
             | I meant to say "The UFO Experience" by J. Allen Hyneck, Tech 
             | Consultant to...
             | the movie Close Encounters of the...
             | ...
             | WHat about the Mileer case? Hypnotism was used, rigth?  ga
     David/Moderator: OK...
             | Tony, even Hyneck came to belive in the UFO abduction problem. 
             | He even researched several by himself...
             | About the Miller case?, I'm not sure I'm familiar with the one 
             | your stating,...
             | perhaps you could elaborate more.
             | Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: Tony, did you want to elaborate first?
     Tony Alicea: no,... ga
     Rilla/Sysop: ok...
             | I just wanted to say that I dont doubt the authenticity of the 
             | abduction...
             | stories.  My best friend found out through hypnosis..
             | that her phobias were a result of the fact that SHE is an 
             | abductee...
             | she cant confront the details yet...even in deep  hypnosis...
             | nor can she read anything about UFO's or Schribers books...
             | its really creepy.  What DO you think of Schribers books, btw? 
             | ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Schribers books are indeed excellant, but I worry 
             | sometimes about his...
             | reasons behind the books.  He says he was abducted, and yet 
             | some belive that he is in...
             | involved in the conspiracy with the government.  For the most 
             | part I believe what he has to say...Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Tony, did you want to elaborate further on your idea...GA
     Tony Alicea: about the miller case?
             | ga
     Joe Balsamo: yes ga
     David/Moderator: Yes, Tony, if Joe doesn't mind, would you elaborate..ga
     Tony Alicea: well give me a few mins... Others GA
     David/Moderator: OK, Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Ok...
             | I was just going to say that the Schreiber books are an 
             | interesting read, but I like a little more methodology to get 
             | to the heart 
             | of what is going on...
             | I also just wanted to interject on what the impression of the 
             | general in 'Intruders' was, I thought the movie did a good job 
             | of 
             | portraying the military point of view :) ga
     David/Moderator: Ok...
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: I agree with the military point of view the movie 
             | interjected, and many...
             | people DO believe the military is indeed involved.  The big 
             | problem is trying to decide just how...
             | deeply involved the military is.  Did they establish an Alien 
             | government pact, like many belive, ....
             | or are they simply trying to find answers to the UFO mystery as 
             | a whole...
             | Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: What WAS the military's view?...
             | and if the Aliens are of a higher enough intelligence...
             | to get themselves here in the first place...
             | I would think that they would be intelligent enough...
             | NOT to get involved with the miltary OR ESPECIALLY our 
             | government! GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Ok..
             | First, the governments point of view, in the movie, was they 
             | knew of UFO's but had not yet discovered....
             | why they are here, what they want, and if they prove a security 
             | risk....
             | Therefore, they refused to tell the people until they could 
             | answer these questions for themselves....AS for the second 
             | point...
             | many people believe the aliens are here for sinister reasons, 
             | and that they have entered into...
             | a collaboration with our government to avoid possible conflicts 
             | in the future...
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
     Rilla/Sysop: !
     Joe Balsamo: I think that the US government may have some recovered 
             | vehicles, may have some dead, frozen aliens, and _may_ have 
             | even had a live 
             | alien at one time...
     Tony Alicea: !
     Joe Balsamo: This is speculation drawn from eyewitness accounts and other 
             | data.  I DO NOT think the US government knows a lot more than 
             | it's 
             | citizens are being abducted in a specified manner by an alien 
             | technology.  I  DO NOT think that aliens are involved with 
             | the...
             | US government, for the very reasons that Rilla points out.  I 
             | also don't think the aliens _are_ a threat to us, in fact their 
             | ultimate purpose is quite unclear. GA
     David/Moderator: OK... Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: ok....
             | I know that I am somewhat of an idealist <g>...
             | but I have a really hard time believing that a civilization 
             | that is...
             | advanced enough to be capable of and have experienced space 
             | travel...
             | could be here for "sinister" reasons.  sigh...idealism dies 
             | hard. GA
     David/Moderator: Tony > ga
     Tony Alicea: I am sorry, It's not the "Miller" case *but* The Betty And 
             | Barney *HILL* case
             | ...
             | that I was reffering to! (long time...) I must leave now; so 
             | have a good...
             | weekend ... Peace!; Bye
     David/Moderator: Bye Tony, sorry to see you leave..ga
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: For the record..
             | will one of you elaborate on the Hill case...I think I remember 
             | it but not...
             | sure...werent they abducted and operated on?
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Would you like to elaborate Joe?  ga
     Joe Balsamo: Sure...
             | This case is very similar in its basic nature to the cases 
             | described in the general abduction literature that has happened 
             | to 
             | literally millions of people worldwide...
             | A couple was abducted, sperm samples [taken] from him, gyn
             | [gynecological] exam on her,
             | but one of the most interesting aspects of the Hill case is 
             | that 
             | Betty was 'shown' a star map...
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     Joe Balsamo: that did not conform to any known systems until years later 
             | when certain stars coincided propely denoting the Zeta Reticuli 
             | system. 
             |  GA
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: wow!  Ok...
             | Are most people's recollections <when they have them>...
             | of the abductions always NEGATIVE?  I would think that at least 
             | SOME...
             | woud be positive. And I have another question after tis one <g> 
             | ga
     David/Moderator: OK...
             | Well, some abductee's feel almost "special" to have been 
             | abducted.  Even though tests have been performed on them...
             | they feel they were selected for a higher purpose of some kind, 
             | and yet it seems almost ALL...
             | abduction cases involve medical exams.  Other are talked to and 
             | made to believe that they are some part of a plan, ...
             | which the alien's have planned for us... Rilla, next question > 
             | ga
     Rilla/Sysop: sorry...
             | trying to answer sen questions and talk...
             | ok...
             | my other question involves the phobias...
             | Are these common for abductees?
             | ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: I know what phobias are, but could you be more specific? 
             |  What kinds of phobia's exactly...ga Rilla
     Rilla/Sysop: Well...specifically flying...
             | but also issues of "safety"
             | you know...
             | abnormal worry about accidents, kids safety, health, financial 
             | problems...
             | I dont know how to be more specific.  CONTROL issues.  GA
     David/Moderator: I get it...
             | Yes, many people afterwards are afraid of such things as 
             | flying, medical exams, doctors,
             | they are scared of the dark, abnormally afraid for there 
             | children, constantly seem unclean, and so forth...
             | I believe that its just natural to have such 'phobias' after 
             | such a trying experience...
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: ok...
             | It seems to me from the stuff that I have read in the abduction 
             | literature, it seems that the experience is similar to any 
             | other 
             | kind of violent assault...
             | But it is worsened by the fact that the abductee KNOWS it will 
             | happen again, something that most crime victims don't have to 
             | contend with...
             | At the same time it seems that the aliens don't _mean_ to be 
             | causing harm, its almost as if they don't understand.  GA
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: That reminds me of another question...
             | has there been any change, according to the documentation...
             | in the way the abductions and examinations are carried out...
             | that would show that the aliens are coming to understand our...
             | physical or psychological makeup any better?  Are they being...
             | "kinder and gentler" aliens? <grin>  
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Rilla,...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: It doesn't appear that the aliens are learning anything 
             | from all those exams, in fact...
             | they seem to carry on the same work over and over again...
     Rilla/Sysop: excuse me..
             | that doesnt make any sense at all in light of how intelligent 
             | they would...
             | have to be...does it? ga
     David/Moderator: Not really....
             | unless they are here for sinister reasons, or something we 
             | can't yet understand...ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > ga.
     Joe Balsamo: Thanks...
             | I don
             | whoops...
             | I don't think that this is the case at all, there ddoes seem to 
             | be some indication that they have performed their experiments 
             | in a 
             | variety of ways...
             | I don't know how systematic they studies of the improvement of 
             | the procedures are...perhaps we can get an NSF grant to study 
             | it? :) 
             | GA
     Rilla/Sysop: <g>
     David/Moderator: <BG>
             | I don't necessarily agree.
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: the aliens seem to be conducting the same work, under 
             | different ways...
             | but the same type of tests over and over again.  Perhaps we are 
             | working with different groups of aliens?..... Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: I think part of the problem in researching this issue is 
             | that it is impossible to get any funding for serious
             | research...
             | this being the case, we have to rely on people like Budd 
             | Hopkins who do it as an advocation and help to abductees.   
             | But, of 
             | course, if the government doesn't want this info out...
             | that will never happen (getting funded research) GA
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: Yes, but another big in researching this work is the 
             | hypnotist's themselves...
             | if during regressive hypnosis, the hypnotist is not EXTREMELY 
             | carefull, he will push off his thoughts onto the person he....
             | or she is regressing......Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: Hypnosis is not the technique to use IMHO...
             | there are too many uncontrolled variables and we cant say for 
             | certain...
             | exactly WHO we are talking to while in a regressed situation...
             | the person, an ego state, a disembodied spirit, a separate 
             | personality...
             | etc. It is not an exact enough science to be trusted even by 
             | those of us...
             | who believe in it.  That said...my REAL question was...
             | someone has mentioned building a data base on here...
             | of known sightings and abductions...
             | what if you were to put the word out that we were doing such a 
             | gathering...
             | of data...
             | on a system as large and as international as this one...
             | SOMEONE would bound to take notice...
             | and if you began to get pressure or funny things started 
             | happening...
             | you would have some sort of clarification at least for 
             | yourselves. ga
     David/Moderator: Rilla, are you telepathic>  <bg>  ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Rilla/Sysop: David> yes
             | and clairaudient so watch what youre thinking!!
             | <g>
     David/Moderator: YES MAAM.....Joe ga
     Joe Balsamo: sorry...
     David/Moderator: Joe> ga!
     Joe Balsamo: minor kitchen crisis...
             | I think that Rilla's idea is fantastic!  I'm a database 
             | designer in real life, so I would love to design a system to 
             | input the data 
             | into...
             | If we do catch the attention of the CIA or whomever, it would 
             | not be the first time that people have been hassled over this 
             | affair. GA
     David/Moderator: Rilla...
             | What would be the possiblity of establishing such a database?   
             | ga
     Rilla/Sysop: what do you mean?  We have a data library here for your use. 
             |  More than that?
             | ga
     David/Moderator: I would think so, Joe....
             | are you talking of like a 'real' database type system?...ga
     Joe Balsamo: Well...
             | A real database wether it is computerised or not, has to have 
             | some internal consistency to be of any use...
             | for example, we are going to need to establish parameters that 
             | people are going to have to report on and try to quantify as 
             | much as 
             | possible...
             | the hard part is going to be the leg work (finger work?) of 
             | getting the word out and getting a report form and all that 
             | stuff, then 
             | building a hypercard stack or whatever ain' no big deal GA
     Rilla/Sysop: ?
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: Joe Walters> you have a better idea of the operations of CIS 
             | data bases...
             | Do you have any comments or suggestions here? ga
     Joe Walters: Not really...
             | That sounds more like the sort of thing...
             | that requires a single user to collate and construct...
             | into a user-accesible database form, hopefully...
             | in some manner usable by MS-DOS types, Mac users, Apple II...
             | folks, etc. etc. Beyond my fields of expertise! :-)   ga
     Rilla/Sysop: !
     David/Moderator: Joe...
     Joe Walters: (the HyperCard stack idea was probably the most 
             | user-friendly approach)
     David/Moderator: Would it not be possible to construct a PC based 
             | database system then to
     Joe Walters: !
     David/Moderator: upload the database itself here to be exchanged with 
             | others?  ga Joe
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Joe Walters: Could be, as long as it's in a form transportable. Another 
             | approach...
             | might be to have a "team" involved; one "leader" to gather...
             | the raw data, and three or four users to customize it for...
             | the various platforms; an MS-DOS person to put it in...
     Joe Balsamo: Wouldn't be a problem to do something on the PC as well.  
             | Like I say, the work part of it would be to come up with forms 
             | that could 
             | be filled in by people...
     Joe Walters: dBase form (or whatever is popular these days), a Mac 
             | person...
             | to put in a Hypercard stack, and I'd be willing to serve to...
             | build a HyperStudio stack for Apple IIgs users.
             | (ga)
     David/Moderator: OK,, Joe B > ga
     Joe Walters: Too many Joes in here! :-)
     JoeB    | yep...
     Joe Walters: Hehehe. All in favor of Joes ruling the universe.... Nahhh.
     Rilla/Sysop: !!!!!!!!!!!
     David/Moderator: no
     Rilla/Sysop: <g>


[At this point Joe Balsamo change is ID to JoeB to avoid confusion!}    

     JoeB    | Umm, I think the design of the report forms is the important 
             | thing, that and getting people to know that this forum is 
             | trying to do 
             | a data gathering project GA
     Joe Walters: Need one more so we can win! Where's Joe Kohn when I need 
             | him\??
             | !
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga, 
     Rilla/Sysop: hehehehe...finally...
             | <g>
             | I was going to suggest..
             | that you talk on the phone with Neil when he gets back..
             | and let him know what it is that you want to do...
             | I'm sure that he will know the limits of what CIS and this 
             | forum...
             | has to offer.  He's also a good idea person.  ga
     Joe Walters: Hmmm....
             | What is this "talk on the phone" concept? Isn't that some sort 
             | of...
     David/Moderator: Joe W > ga
     Joe Walters: low-speed voice comm method that uses equipment better 
             | suited...
             | for modems and computers? Anyway, I could certainly discuss 
             | it...
             | with Neil, but seriously the CIS databases are really 
             | LIBraries...
     Rilla/Sysop: <g>
     Joe Walters: and are not structured to handle what we normally think of 
             | as...
     JoeB    | !
     Joe Walters: "databases" with the exceptions of special areas (like the 
             | encyclopediae...
             | and so on). That would be a big pain to set up and maintain, 
             | and users...
             | who have automated access programs (Nav, TAPCIS, etc) can't 
             | really use...
             | those areas well. I think this would be better suited to having 
             | someone...
             | gather the data (that's where a standardized form & getting the 
             | word...
             | out comes in) and having users structure the data in an 
             | organized...
             | form comfortable to the end user. Download the file, load into 
             | your...
             | fave DB/Hypermedia program, and checkit out. GA!
     David/Moderator: JoeB > ga
     JoeB    | David...
     Joe Walters: brb!
     JoeB    | I was just going to suggest that Joe W's idea is pretty much 
             | what I have in mind, that way people can just d/l the standard 
             | form, 
             | fill it in, and u/l it...
     Joe W   | (back!)
     JoeB    | We could then be responsible for putting it into a more useable 
             | database offline, then upload THAT for usage by researchers.  
             | Whattya think? GA
     Joe W   | !
     David/Moderator: I like it.....Joe W > ga
     Joe W   | The two Joes are in perfect agreement! ...
     Rilla/Sysop: !
     Joe W   | Note that we can make use (probably) of What's New when we 
             | start...
             | this up, and I'm sure that there will be continuing mention of 
             | this...
             | project as appropriate both here and in ISSUES Forum, and
             | the...
             | UFO mags will probably give us some free publicity. We could...
             | become THE clearinghouse for this sort of info. Until we all...
             | mysteriously disappear, of course. :-)  GA
     Rilla/Sysop: <g>
     David/Moderator: Rilla > ga
     Rilla/Sysop: I was thinking that you could put...
             | an explanatory message on the board which we could put on 
             | HOLD...
             | so that it doesnt scroll...
             | and then add to the News Flash a pointer saying "go check 
             | message #XXX"...
             | about UFO survey...
             | I think that you could EASILY become THE clearinghouse with 
             | just a bit...
             | of work...which you all are doing already.  We'd be happy to 
             | help...
             | the extra publicity doesnt hurt the forum <g>.
             | ga
     Joe W   | Ah, yes! The old (H)eld message trick!
     Rilla/Sysop: hehehehe
     Joe W   | !
     David/Moderator: And the commanders need something to do too!... ga
     Rilla/Sysop: <slump>
     David/Moderator: Joe W > ga
     Joe W   | OK, well, I think we see what needs to be done on this type 
             | of...
             | thing. We can "self-start" it by seeding the initial
             | database...
             | with known cases and reports (The Hills, Jimmy Carter, etc)...
             | just to prime the pump. We really need to build (I hate to...
             | use this word) a committee now to actually do it. I need a ...
             | better word than committee, as those never do anything... 
             | Anyway,...
             | we need a team leader, a volunteer for each computer type...
             | of interest, and the leader may want to appoint a couple...
             | of helpers to assemble the data and get the forms together.
             | Oh, and Interested....
             | Computer Types would be defined when someone pipes up...
             | and says, "I wish there was a database of this for the...
             | Atari Whatever," and we immediately appoint him/her as...
             | the coordinator for that system. :-) DONE!
     David/Moderator: OK....
     Joe W   | (I Nominate the UFO Section Leader for the position of Team 
             | Leader.)
             | (hehehe)
     Rilla/Sysop: I second!
     David/Moderator: JoeW, thanks alot..
     Joe W   | Yer Welcome!
     David/Moderator: Ok, I would be willing to jump in, what the hey, I'm 
             | section leader right? ga
     JoeB    | !
     David/Moderator: OK...just a sec...
             | JoeB  > ga
     JoeB    | I just wanted to say that this really has quite a potential to 
             | start a systematic aproach to reporting, we may want to talk to 
             | MUFON or CUFOS or all of them to get some ideas...
             | forms that they are undoubtedly using and just use them or a 
             | variation of such, with the organizations permission, of course 
             | GA
     Joe W   | Good ideas!
     David/Moderator: Are we all genius's here or what?  ga

     Rilla/Sysop: I have bad news David...
             | my buffer got bumped about a half an hour ago...
             | and I wasnt watching it cause the screen was blanked...
             | so I DONT have a transcript of this co...did you make one? I 
             | hope!!! sigh
     David/Moderator: Don't worry, I think I recorded it all, at lease I hope 
             | so!
             | Should we go informal now?
     Rilla/Sysop: good!
     JoeB    | I have it to.
     Rilla/Sysop: yes!
             | <applause!!!!>
     JoeB    | YAAAAAAAAAAAA
     Rilla/Sysop: Great job David!!!!
             | you did it!
     David/Moderator: Thank you Thank you, just send money please!
     Rilla/Sysop: <g>
     Joe W   | We all survived!
     David/Moderator: Specially me!
     JoeB    | well done, good show indeed!
     Rilla/Sysop: What money, we already gave you a free account!!
             | hehehehehhehee
     David/Moderator: Not bad for 5 or 6 people?
     Rilla/Sysop: I think that you should make this a regular occurence.
     David/Moderator: I'd like to if its possbile, it has potential!
     Rilla/Sysop: Figure out how often you are comfortable with and go with
             | it.
             | Just dont schedule it the same time as the ISSUES co.
             | <g>
     David/Moderator: I did that on purpose... ha ha ha
     Rilla/Sysop: And dont feel badly about the show...
             | not very many people show for the co itself...
             | but LOTS will download the transcript!
     David/Moderator: Yea, CIA, FBI, NSA
     Joe W   | Hahaha!
     JoeB    | more and more info being sent out, that's what is important in 
             | this issue.
     Rilla/Sysop: hahahahahaha....they will have to add a new page to my file!
     David/Moderator: Anyhone interested, meet in room 2?
     Rilla/Sysop: Yes, I'll be there in a minute...
             | our Sunday co is scheduled for 9 and I need to check the board 
             | first.
     David/Moderator: Its been a pleasure, thank you all for coming!
     JoeB    | For a bit, then i gotta get some dinner!
     David/Moderator: Meet you in CO 2


THE END! (for now!)
