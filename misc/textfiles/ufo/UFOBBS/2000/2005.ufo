SUBJECT: E.T. HYPOTHESIS                                    FILE: UFO2005


The following is a transcript of the 12/29/87 rebroadcast of an episode from    the long running television series called "Man Alive".  The episode is entitled
"The E.T. Hypothesis", and originally aired in April 1987.  That particular program
received the highest audience rating of any episode in the 20-year history of
Man Alive.  The series is hosted by Roy Bonisteel, and this particular show has to do with issues relating to the abduction experience in connection with UFO's.  
     The program's format  involves location filming, which in this case includes
a short interview and hypnosis session with a middle aged woman abductee, along with a roundtable discussion about the abduction phenomenom and its many
implications. The participants include notably Budd Hopkins, recognized UFO
authority along with other interested parties such as a Futurist and a doctor 
specializing in hypnosis for the treatment of trauma. 
     As Roy Bonisteel is the host of the program, he acts both as a narrator, and as 
a direct participant. Therefore, when he is acting in either capacity I shall indicate it by placing an (N) or (P) behind his name in order to clarify things.
Other clarifying points not expressed in the dialogue, will be indicated by myself
through the use of these type brackets  < >.
     The half-hour program Man Alive is broadcast coast-to-coast in Canada on the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC), which also produces it.     

     -The program was videotaped and transcribed by ParaNet member Tom Mickus.

                                           "THE E.T. HYPOTHESIS"

Roy Bonisteel (N): Looking up at a star filled sky, how often do we wonder about                                  other life in the universe? From what we know today it seems                                 virtually certain that we're not alone. It follows that contact 
                            with an extraterrestrial civilization could happen, and at any
                            moment. Most of us would agree that this would be a significant
                            milestone in human history. But do we have any idea at all about
                            how it will affect us?                                                                                                       Popular culture often reflects a naive, comfortable vision
                            of extraterrestrials. They either look and sound like us <ala Mork
                            & Mindy>,  or are pets <A.L.F.>.  Sometimes the image is                                            threatening, a nightmare of unearthly evil <War of the Worlds>,                                but the good guys always win in the end. In more self reflective
                           moments we see extraterrestrials as saviours, crucified by our
                           fears <The Day the Earth Stood Still>. But what would the reality                             be like? What could happen to our culture,  our religions, our                                    view of the world, our very sense of ourselves as a Race?
                                  People have always looked to the skies and seen strange                                    things, but it wasn't until 1947 that an idea captured the public
                           imagination. That some of these strange objects may in fact be
                           somebody else's spacecraft. It's an idea that provoked a highly
                           polarized debate. But believers were often questionable types,
                           they claimed to bring us messages of love from our space
                           brothers. But the disbelievers were equally zealous in their
                           pronouncements, and often just as hard to believe.
                                   Though the evidence has accumulated, thousands of un-
                           explained sitings, pictures that have held up under analysis, it 
                          still is circumstantial.  The subject still provokes passionate
                          opinions, people who report UFO's are ridiculed in the Press.
                          Scientists make unscientific pronouncements. The beliefs about                              them, both pro and con, are sometimes expressed with a fervour
                          that can only be described as fanatical. It seems that a lot more
                          is at stake in the UFO controversy than just the evidence.

David Jacobs: The UFO phenomenom is strange in the extreme, and even to go ahead
                      and discuss some of the things that I will in fact discuss,                                        suggests....calls into question the quality of my judgements.

Bonisteel (N): David Jacobs is a professor of history at Temple University in 
                      Philadelphia.

Jacobs: ...academics, and other scientists must be EXTREMELY careful because                      there  is a tremendous amount of ridicule attached to this subject.
                 Starting in the 1970's, we began to receive large numbers of
            abduction reports. The abduction reports are I think extremely important.
            They are basically reports that people claim would have us believe that 
            they were... grabbed so to speak by occupants, they were given a physical
           examination of some sort, and then released. Now normally these kind of
           cases in "the old days" were simply dismissed, put in the CP file, CrackPot.
           These people would be labelled loonies, and there are loonies out there,                   there are people who lie out there, everybody is  aware of that, and this
           is probably just another manifestation of that. However, there are so many
           of them now, and they are so consistent, and the witnesses are so credible
           that UFO researchers are forced to confront them. They are forced to deal
           with them. Once we have begun to study abduction reports, it is almost as               if a door opened. <Scene Changes>

Budd Hopkins:  I have worked with 124 people to date who I feel have either had...
                       definitely seem to have had this kind of abduction experience, the
                       experience which most interests me. Of those people, 66 have 
                       remembered a full account.

Bonisteel(N): Budd Hopkins is a New York artist who has been researching UFO's                            since  a daylight sighting he had had in the '60's. He's well known
                     in New York art circles, his work is collected by both the Whitney                            and  Guggenheim museums. But Hopkins is also the leading researcher
                     into the UFO abduction phenomenom.

Hopkins: The people who have experienced these abductions include three people
              who hold Phd degrees, I have housewives, farmers, two police officers, I
              have two army officers, I have just about everyone you could imagine who
              has been involved in abductions.

Bonisteel(N): We felt that regardless of whether or not the abduction phenomenom
                      is real, it could give us a fascinating window through which we                              could explore the idea of extraterrestrial contact. Four people from
                     varied backgrounds came to my farm for two days to hear Budd 
                     Hopkins talk about his research.
                          Professor Allan Tuff, a futurist at the Ontario Institute for                               Studies In Education (O.I.S.I.E), University of Toronto.
                          Clarence Dickinson, astronomer and author.
                          John Musgrave, educational consultant from Edmonton, with an
                     interest in folklore and UFO's.
                           And Dr. Michael Kaufman, a general practicioner who uses                                   hypnosis in his practice for treatment of trauma.

Hopkins: I'm looking at all these cases and  obviously you have three alternatives
              essentially.  The person is making it all up, is lying to you, its a hoax.
              The second, and obviously much more rewarding area to look for is that
              there is some sort of psychological explanation of some sort, of any sort.
              The third alternative, is of course the only third alternative, is that they
              are describing what really happened to them, as best as they remember it.

Bonisteel(N): Its Hopkins contention that they are describing what really happened
                     to them. He began to show us some thought provoking slides.

Hopkins: This mark on the ground is a photograph taken in Indianapolis, in a case
              that is very central to a whole cluster of events that I'm working on
              now. In the morning after this event happened, this is what turned up on
              the ground <large circular patch of scorched earth>. The soil is 
              absolutely cooked, its almost like rock. It will not hold water, water runs
              straight through it, and this is the entire area.
                  Now this is the leg of that woman foreground <slides show small pock
              marks>, we'll call her name Cathy. Those little scars, those little scoop-
              marks are associated with two events that happened to her. One, when                     she was about six, and one when she was about thirteen. And under
               hypnosis she has remembered a UFO experience where a small tool took a
               little core sample. This is her mother's leg <similar marks on the slide>.
               Her mother had a missing time experience which was very distressing                    for her when she was a little girl, and at the end of it she had this little
              mark.
                    This is another woman who was a close friend, who had an
             abduction  experience, a missing time experience, and she remembered
             a great deal of it consciously. This is of course a very common type of 
             figure as we now know <shows classic picture of alien, four feet tall, big               head and eyes....> from so many of these reports. This predates Close 
             Encounters incidentally <the movie>.

Bonisteel(N): After lunch, Budd Hopkins began to present his latest findings                                  publicly for the very first time. Up to this point, only a handful of
                     people have been aware of the things that we now heard. Hopkins 
                     was understandably nervous.

Hopkins: A new aspect of the whole phenomenon which I have stumbled into
              has to do with this idea of some genetic experimentation.  And we have
              always known that there have been, suggestions at least, of ova being 

              taken form women and sperm from
