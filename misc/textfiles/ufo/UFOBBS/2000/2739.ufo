    SUBJECT:  MEN IN BLACK . . .


      In the past , a certain number of people often come around,  they ask 
    people who see space crafts all sorts of questions, then after they get 
    the  information they would threaten them with everything in the book , 
    if they didn t shut up about the sighting. They were called "THE MEN IN 
    BLACK"  because they wore black suits and drove black cars.  My teacher 
    once  told me not to attack them because they would just do  away  with 
    me. He said that my elder brothers would take care of them.  Due to the 
    fact  that the information is coming out about them now,  it seems that 
    it should be O.K. for me to repeat the information, so here goes; 
    
      They  are from the Sirius star system.  Although most of  the  "good" 
    type beings are from that system, such as Kadar,  they refer to the men 
    in black's planet as a rather , unsightly planet;; and from their frame 
    of  reference,  they do not claim them to be their own,  but they  must 
    acknowledge that they are,  even within their dimension, located within 
    our system. They do have the ability to change alter their appearances, 
    some-  what,.  Our U.S. government is now cooperating with the Sirians; 
    and  the  question  was  asked,  what  is  the power  that  the  entire 
    government has to go along with them? They have weapon sources, (I must 
    circumspect...)  that are believed by the powers on this planet,  to be 
    absolutely dominating. In other words, the government believes they are 
    looking  down  the  barrel of a very big gun.  The Sirians are  in  the 
    second dimension soon to  go into the third. We are in the third,  soon 
    to go into the fourth. The sirians are  trying to prevent us from going 
    into the fourth dimension. 
     
      The  negative  Sirians  are involved with  these  cattle  mutilations 
    because  of their desire create a species that can perpetuate itself in 
    the harshest of conditions. 
     
      The people from  Zeta Reticuli aren't doing the mutilations,  but the 
    "primitive" Zeta reticulans, which are from (what we would consider) to 
    be from the the past, (please don't ask me to explain! J.W) are helping 
    the Sirians. 
     
      One of the  beings that was being interviewed while  he was asleep is 
    called B'zal. You talk about a tough dude.  . . He would make the worst 
    person on earth look like Mr. Rogers.
