SUBJECT: SPACE ALIENS HANG OUT AT NEVADA BAR                 FILE: UFO2119



Rachel, Nev. - The little A'Le'Inn may not look like much, but the dusty pub
in the middle of the Nevada desert is one of the most fascinating places on
the planet - because it's the only bar on Earth where space aliens come to wet
their whistles!

Local folk who frequent the tiny tavern hardly bat an eye these days when a
visitor from some faraway solar system strolls in and plops down at a corner
table.

Some of these spacemen look pretty strange, but some of them look so much like
us you'd never know they weren't human if they didn't act so odd, says easy-
going Joe Travis, who runs the remote roadhouse with his wife Pat.

The other day one of 'em came in and sat right over there by the slot machines
for 12 hours. The entire time, he never said anything, never ate anything,
never drank anything - and never even went to the bathroom.

Then, when closing time came he just got up, walked out the door and disappea-
red. We didn't make a nickel off that guy.

But more often, the A'Le'Inn's interplanetary patrons grab a bite to eat and
something to drink before zooming off into the sunset. And they pay their tab
with crisp green bills.

I don't know where they get their money, but I'm glad they've got it, Pat Tra-
vis says. There are hardly enough real people around here to keep this place
open. 

Though Earthlings are scarce, UFO experts say there are more E.T.s strolling
around this sleepy hamlet north of Las Vegas than anyplace else on Earth, 
thanks to a constant stream of starship traffic in and out of nearby Nellis
Air Force Base.

Researchers swear the Pentagon is doing more than testing super sophisticated
warplanes at Nellis. They say it's also conducting tests on nine captured
alien spaceships stowed in hangars at the base - and meeting on the sly with
the occupants of countless UFOs that zip in and out of Nellis every day.

And when the top secret meetings are over, it seems, the E.T.s often head for
the Little A'Le'Inn (pronounced A-Lee-Inn) to unwind.

You never know when they're going to pop in and you never know they're going
to look like when they do, insists Pat Travis. But they pretty much keep to
themselves, and our regulars just leave them alone. This is a real friendly
place.

And the enterprising Travises, who bought the inn six years ago, keep it frie-
ndly by making sure their customers feel right at home - no matter what planet
they hail from.

Earthlings Welcome proclaims a sign outside the front door of the converted
trailer. And a few feet away, another sign invites UFO crews to come in and
quaff a few.

A wooden replica of a flying saucer sits outside the bar and a paper mache
alien's head is perched atop the jukebox. The restaurant's favorite offering
is the Alien Burger - made from unmutilated cattle - and the bar's best sell-
ing drink is a concoction called the Beam Me Up, Scotty.

But despite the frivolous trappings, those aliens snooping around Rachel are
no joke to the cowpokes, ranchhands and assorted good ol'boys who belly up
to the A'Le'Inn bar every day at dusk.

A lot of our customers have been abducted by aliens, Pat Travis says. Around
here, nobody kids them about it.

And Pat herself insists an invisible creature from another world has been her
constant companion for months.

Three psychics have told us that beings we can't see are present in this bar,
and one of them is with me all the time, she says. We call him Archilbald  and
he's been a good friend.

One day recently, the unsuspecting lady was barreling down Highway 375 when
Archibald's voice sounded out loud and clear.

He told me, Pat, slow this car down! I slowed down from 65 miles an hour to 35 
and suddenly there were two big black bulls in the highway right in front of
me. If he hadn't warned me, I'd have been killed for sure.

So around here nobody laughs about space aliens. One of them saved my life.
