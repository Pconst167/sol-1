SUBJECT: THE UFO MESSAGE                                     FILE: UFO2154



This message that your about to hear came about in a very strange way.
The circumstances which I still find very hard to understand. I'm not
going to reveal these circumstances at this time. I may never reveal
them. But, the UFO message will stand the test of critics and time.
And to me, and to those who will understand it, I'm sure that will be
answer enough.

This is the UFO message.

Two Presidents of the United States have had personal contact with
UFOs. They were Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman. In both
instances these presidents came away from these meetings with a new
and sober attitude toward world conditions. President Truman put the
brakes on an all out nuclear war in Korea. And, Eisenhower warned
about the perils of our giant military industrial complex.

The UFO people have warned these American Presidents, and other world
leaders against nuclear war. It has been these warnings that have led
to detente with Russia, and open negotiations with the Peoples
Republic of China.

For many years now, people around the world have been reporting
strange sights in the sky. These reports have come from Asia, Africa,
Europe, and the Americas. And, they all have an amazing similarity.
Round, disk, or cigar shape metallic craft that hover in the air. Go
up in down with fantastic speed, and have flashing lights, sometimes
blue, red, and or green. These strange crafts have been known as
flying saucers or UFOs. Unidentified flying objects.

From time to time these crafts have landed and creatures have been
seen by people of unimpeachable reputations. Yet despite all of this
evidence, no official of any government in the world has ever made any
pronouncement or official comment concerning UFOs.

Why?

They have long since known who and what UFOs were, and what they were
all about. The only reason that the truth has not been told is that
high officials fear that the truth will lead to panic and maybe even
chaos. According to one of the foremost authorities on UFOs in the
world, retired U.S. Marine Corp Major, Donald E. Kehoe. There have
been unrelenting federal secrecy on UFOs for over 25 years now. The
Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington have even issued Secrecy Directive
JANAP146, which not only covers Armed Forces airmen, but also
Commercial Airline pilots and crew. This secrecy directive is entitled
"Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence
Sightings from Aircraft". The directive orders and directs the
immediate transmission of all data, and information to the nearest
military command. Under penalties of this directive, hundreds of
pilots reporting UFOs have been officially silenced.

But, the truth that has been suppressed for so long, will be told. I
received the UFO message in November 1973, under circumstances which
were so unbelievable that it made it difficult to accept. And even
after the UFO people revealed this information to me, it was so
astounding, I demanded additional proof. I insisted that all doubt be
removed. Since they indicated to me that they could foresee certain
future events, I asked a specific question about the future. Then I
waited three months, until February 1974, to see what would happen. At
the end of three months, their answer came true with such clarity and
accuracy, that all of my previous concern was swept away.

The people who hear this message should also have the same proof. I
therefore asked the UFO people to give me additional predictions,
which I have made it part of this message. When these events occur,
any reservations or doubts about the message will then be removed.

The UFO people are surveying the world today and have been for several
years to determine how bad the planet earth has been damaged, and the
life upon it. These craft not only fly, but they also travel beneath
the sea. They are extremely concerned at the damage that has been
caused thus far. They have indicated many terrible disasters for the
earth.

When the UFO people first returned to the earth in the early 40s, and
I say returned, because the earth has previously been visited for
thousand of years. They had a number of personal contacts with world
leaders, individuals, and ordinary people. However they say that the
earth has become so contaminated through nuclear explosions, that
personal contact is now highly dangerous.

All of their contacts through recent times has been through robots.
The recent incident in Pascagoula, Mississippi is the most current
example. Robots were used to examine two men to see the level of
nuclear contamination. According to the UFO people the Gulf coast is
one of the most imperiled regions on earth.

On the night of October 11th, 1973, two men, Charles Hickson, and
Calvin Parker were fishing on a small wharf along the Simi River in
Pascagoula, Mississippi. They suddenly heard a humming noise behind
them. As they turned they saw a oval craft hovering a few feet above
the ground. An opening mysteriously appeared in this craft, and three
creatures came floating out. They took the two men aboard the craft
were they were examined, and what one of the men described as a huge
eye. Later these men were questioned by law enforcement officers, and
scientist. They were given lie-detector tests, and they were
hypnotized. Still the two men clung to their story. Subsequently the
Pascagoula, Mississippi UFO incident has since proved to be the most
astounding and believable of all UFO events.

As previously stated the earth was originally settled over 100
thousand years ago, when inhabitants were brought here from another
world in the universe. A civilization far more advanced then the one
we have now, flourished for thousands of years. This civilization was
totally demolished when a nuclear explosion destroyed a planet that
orbited Mars and Jupiter. Causing a cataclysmic upheaval upon the
earth. Continents shifted, oceans and mountains were formed. The
almost total geography of the earth was changed. According to the UFO 
people, by some unbelievable miracle a few earth people survived. 
However they were few in number, and were left with nothing but the raw 
elements to survive under. These small bands of earth people soon adapted 
to life in an almost animal state. They roamed the earth for thousands 
of years. Until some ten thousand years ago the UFO people returned to 
the earth. They had returned after the earth's disaster, but had found 
no trace of the people who had survived. And they had waited for the 
earth to stabilize, before they returned to inhabit it again.

They said that the problem began when some of the UFO people who came
back to inhabit the earth began to mix with the more animalistic
inhabitants on earth who had survived the catastrophe. Thus began the
long period struggle on earth between the mixed strain of inhabitants,
and the pure strain that came from outerspace. The UFO people have
kept a hands off attitude toward these opposing forces. Because, they
say universal law requires them to do so.

Regarding religions, the UFO people stated that the Bible, and other
religious books such as the Koran, are truthful allegories, but few
people actually perceive the concepts that are presented. They say
that the Bible not only provide great truth about life, history,
future, but it offers explanations of planets, space travel, and other
worlds with people on them.

For example; Ezekiel, Chapter 10, verse 12 through 16 reads: And the
wheels were full of eyes, roundabout, even the wheel that they fore
had. As for the wheels it was cried into them in my hearing, oh wheel
and everyone had four faces. The first face was a face of a Sheriff.
And the second face was a face of a man. And the third a face of a
lion. And the fourth the face of a eagle. And the celestial beings
were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river
Shaybar. And when the celestial beings went, the wheels went by them,
and then the celestial beings lifted up their wings to mount up from
the earth. The same wheel also turned not from beside them.

The UFO people would not specify to more direct religious questions.
Except to say that their lifestyle is on a higher plain then that on
earth. They say that the earth's lifestyle is in its infancy, and is
not at all advanced. It is merely at a beginning stage. They said that
there are other planets in the universe with a higher lifestyle then
their own. They stated that each individual has a life essence or what
we call a soul. This life essence is eternal, but must pass through
various stages of perfection, before it can advance to other stages.

When asked about Jesus, they provided this answer. At the time that
Jesus came into the world, man was at the point of completely
reverting to an animalistic stage. Jesus came to correct this trend in
man. They said that the motivating power or force in the universe had
given all inhabitants of the universe free will and choices. However,
this motivating force also interjects influences such as Jesus into
live situations to provide a bore-warp against an opposite force which
is also operating throughout the universe. They refer to this opposite
force in earthly terms as animalistic. They said two of the most 
important statements made by Jesus were: "Thou shall love thy neighbor as 
thy self". Since all the universe is bound on every force and being, 
working toward the good of the whole. And: "In my father's house are 
many mansions". Because he opened the door, and offered reservations in 
lifestyles to come in other worlds to those who would convert from 
animalistic lifestyles to higher goalsto human and spiritual pursuits.

The UFO people said that in their lifestyle there are no diseases.
They said that they do die, and are very susceptible to contaminants
of planets such as the earth.

They say they have lost several UFO crafts and crews on earth. And,
that the government of a number of countries on earth have large parts
and sections of these crafts. The UFO people said their crafts operate
on a simple free energy principle, that is present throughout the
universe. They say that one government in particular, the United
States has through research on the pieces and sections of the crafts,
which they have in their possession, have discovered this energy
principle. The UFO people say that this energy principle is being kept
as the most vital secret in the world.

They say the recent oil crisis was brought about when a small group of
people in the government was discovered about to leak this information
to the world. This group has been silenced. However they have stated
that the oil interest which now represents the most powerful group on
earth went into a panic. They contrive the oil shortage to force
prices as high as possible to make all the money they could in case
the truth leaked out.

The UFO crafts are atoms structured. The atoms are molecular
synchronous. The total molecular structure of the craft moves with
each turn of pitch. This accounts for its complex maneuverability.
There is a ring around the craft which in rotation makes a zinging
sound. This ring creates an electro-magnetic field which responds to
the positive and negative polarity as required of the atomic building
block structure of the craft. The brilliant light which covers a UFO
in flight as it begins to take off is caused by the electrical charge
that is built up when the power of the craft is turned on.

To give an indication of the speed of a UFO, imagine how fast current
travels in a piece of wire. When you flick a switch a light is
instantly lit. The UFO crafts are actually electrical particles, and
they travel on the electrical waves throughout the universe with that
exact speed.

The UFO people are Mongolian in features, and are somewhat shorter
then earth people. Their skin coloring is the color of a slight sun
tan, that has been tinted a faint bluish gray. Their language or
speech is in symbolic logic, or vocal logo-gram. The sound of this
speech pattern to the human ear is a soft humming sound. 
The UFO people were asked why they didn't just land a crew in a public
place amid television cameras, and a large crowd of people. Then,
there would be no doubt as to the truth. The UFO people stated that in
the beginning in the early 40s they had been willing to do that. They
had discussed just such a proposal with both President Truman, and
Eisenhower. However they said this proposal had been rejected. They
said the world leaders were afraid of the impact it would have upon
the people the world over.

Since that time, the UFO people said that the governments of the world
have become extremely hostile to their craft. The UFO people said that
many UFOs have even been shot down. In return the UFO people said that
they have shot down several aircraft, and had to destroy a number of
submarines in underwater encounters. They said they regretted these
incidents, but the importance of their own mission made it absolutely
necessary to accomplish.

The UFO people have warned that they will not allow a nuclear war to
occur on this planet. They have indicated that the universe is finely
balanced, and that giant nuclear explosions upset this balance. They
said they first detected the first atomic explosion in the early 40s.
And, that is when they re-established communications with, and
continued observation of the earth.

Other planets have been destroyed by nuclear disaster, which has
caused great catastrophes in vast areas of the universe. Earthquakes,
flood, tidal waves, and hurricanes can be caused by nuclear explosions
on this earth, or on other planets throughout the universe.

The UFO people said that they had many difficult encounters over
Vietnam. They said that their craft were under constant fire in that
area. But that the seriousness of the Vietnam conflict made it
absolutely necessary to keep that engagement under continuous
surveillance.

The UFO people said that they would not make a direct appeal to the
people of the world, except under two conditions. One, if the leaders
of the world asked them to do so. Or, two, a nuclear war was
threatened. They said they would do whatever was necessary to prevent
the present civilization on earth from being destroyed by a nuclear
holocaust. They said a nuclear holocaust not only would imperil the
earth, but it would also imperil other vast areas of the universe.

The UFO people stated that the most dangerous act that the world and
the United States in particular has committed, was a few years ago
when an atomic device was exploded above the earth. This explosion
occurred in the Van Allen Radiation Belt. A belt of intense ionizing
radiation that completely surrounds the earth in the outer atmosphere.
At the exact instance of this explosion, atomic fallout completely
engulfed the radiation belt, cutting off all communications in the
world for a short period of time. This explosion also caused many UFO
craft to go out of control in various areas of the universe. 
In retaliation, and as a warning against any further such atomic test
in the atmosphere above the earth, the UFO people caused and
electrical blackout in eight Northeastern states, and two Provinces of
Canada. Since that time there have been no explanations by the
government for the blackout. But, there has also been no nuclear
explosions in the atmosphere above the earth. The UFO people warned
that there will be no more, or they'll take more drastic steps the
next time.

The UFO people said there would be a Revelation soon which will have
an astounding effect on America, and will be the cause for turning
America back on to the right path. They said this revelation would
come out of the Watergate scandal, would concern former President John
Kennedy's assassination, and the energy crisis. They would not reveal
more then this, but said that it would occur prior to the 200th
anniversary of the United States in 1976.

The UFO people said that China is the key to world peace. But the
Middle East was a point upon earth that the future course of world
events would emanate.

Some would say that all of this is highly alarming in nature, and
certainly that is true. But it is far better to know the truth in
advance, then to have to face all of these things in some sudden
dramatic circumstance. I believe that through release of this message
now, it will lessen the total impact in the future.

They said that I would run a great risk in making all this information
public. However, they said that although I would run into some great
problems, that it would be alright in the end. They said that
animalistic forces would go to any lengths to stop the truth from
being told.

They said that they normally didn't make future events known, even
though they had the ability to do so. But, to provide me protection,
they would reveal certain events that would happen in the future, so
that once this information was released, and when these events
happened, then the people of the world would know the truth. They said
the animalistic forces could stop me, but they could not stop the
events from happening. They said nothing can ever stop the truth.

The UFO people said that among the founders of America, were some of 
the more pure strands of universe people. That, America had been
greatly blessed, because the principles and concepts under which the
government had been founded. However, since the early 40s, animalistic
forces have almost gained control over America. And, that the United
States is going to experience some very major difficulties.

A policeman in Faultville, Alabama photographed a mysterious silvery
creature walking along a country road. In the time since then, he's
been fired from his job. His family was harassed. His wife has left
him. And, his house has been destroyed by fire. The story about the
policeman in Alabama, and the misfortune that has befallen others who
have become involved with UFOs, caused me to deliberate for a long
time before deciding to release the information on this recording.
But, I finally decided that it was time that someone told the truth. In 
addition, the UFO people who provided me the information also
revealed a number of predictions, which upon occurrence would provide
me a measure of protection. It is for this reason, and for a great
concern for the truth, America, and the world that I decided to make
this recording.

The following are Revelations of events the UFO people promised me
would happen in the future.

*    One, a great disaster will occur on the Gulf coast of the United
     States concerning the oceans, and tidal waves. The UFO people
     said that their recent underwater explorations in the Gulf of
     Mexico shows that such a disaster is imminent.

*    Two, a small event emanating from the Watergate scandal in
     Washington will reveal information about the Kennedy
     assassination, which will also be connected to the present energy
     crisis.

*    Three, a great disaster will occur soon in north Georgia, and    
     eastern Tennessee, which will result from a convulsion of the    
     earth in that area.

*    Four, a disaster of monumental proportions will occur in the area
     of Ethiopia in the very near future.

*    Five, cure for cancer will be found in 1976.

*    Six, during the year 1974, UFOs will be sighted in even larger
     numbers then in 1973. One particular UFO event will occur in the
     eastern United States, which will force the President to reveal
     for the first time details which the government has managed to
     conceal for over 25 years. This event over the eastern United
     States will not only astound America, but the entire world.

*    Seven, and this is the strangest prediction of all. The UFO
     people said there is a strong Germanic influence now assuming
     leadership in America. This German infiltration into positions of
     influence is not by accident, according to the UFO people. They
     said that the philosophy of Fascism nurtured during Nazi Germany
     is alive and growing underground around the world. The greatest
     penetration is now concentrated in America. This will cause great
     problems in the near future, according to the UFO people.

These are the revelations that the UFO people provided to me. The
future will tell if they are true. The final thing that was revealed
to me was that the world is in great peril. The forces of the spirit
are enjoined with those of the animalistic. The UFO people said if 
anyone wanted additional truth of impending disaster, they should pay 
attention to the animal world. They said animals are instinctual in 
knowing when catastrophes are coming. The UFO people said that animals 
are already harrowing the problems to come in the southeastern United 
States. Millions of squirrels are in mass exodus from the northeast. 
Birds are flocking by the millions in frantic behavior, losing their 
normal migratory habits. Fish keels are becoming more and more common 
place. All of this uncommon animal reaction should be heeded as a sign 
of earth trouble.

The UFO people would not predict the outcome. They said that within
the universe there are many areas which these animalistic forces are
in control. They said these animalistic forces had great power, and
that they represented an eternal struggle. But, if the earth cared
enough, the forces of the spirit could win. That the final choice was
up to us.

         circa late 1970s.
