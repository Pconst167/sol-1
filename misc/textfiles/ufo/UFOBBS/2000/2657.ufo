    Around  1958,   the significant implications of  the  Earth's  magnetic 
    fields  and  radiation belts for future military activities  were  what 
    drew the attention of government physicists.  Nicholas Christofilos,  a 
    physicist working at the University of California's Livermore Radiation 
    Laboratory,   developed  techniques to harness and control  the  energy 
    released  in  hydorgen fusion reactions.   Christofilos  used  magnetic 
    confinment fields.  When the Soviets launched Sputnik I,   Christofilos 
    decided  that  the earth's magnetic field could be used to  contain  an 
    artificial  band  of relativistic electrons.  He speculated  that  this 
    artificial  radiation  belt  could be made intense  enough  to  destroy 
    satellites  in orbit.  The belt would produce worldwide radio noise  on 
    the  HF  and  VHF  radio  bands  that  carried  the  bulk  of  military 
    communications.  By accurately calculating the site for an explosion of 
    a nuclear device,  it's effects could be made to occur over a  specific 
    target area. Christofilos urged that the government test his postulates 
    by  exploding  a  nuclear device in space.  Christofilos  superiors  at 
    Livermore  placed his papers under top security control and advised the 
    President's Science Advisory group of the matter. The resulting program 
    became Project Argus.
