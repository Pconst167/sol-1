                              ROBERT LAZAR PAPER
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Slender and bespectacled, with the bookish air about him,
Bob Lazar certainly looks the part.  In fact, he is a young
scientist who has worked on our government's most highly
classified project, Galileo, which involves back engineering
alien technology.  His employment as a Majestic 12 scientist
required a clearance 38 levels above q.  Since going public
and telling of his work as a theoretical physicist at Area S-4
in the Nevada Test Site, he has had his life threatened and he
has been shot at.  Operatives have also erased hospital birth
records, college transcripts and employment records, including
those of his employment with Los Alamos National Laboratories
and through EG&G.

     Evidence supporting his claims is considerable.  Bob
claimed to have worked at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
The FBI is still dragging its feet in investigating his
employment there, even though Nevada Congressman James Bilbray
asked it to be investigated over two years ago.  Evidently,
FBI agents are still scratching their heads, wondering how to
both deny his employment at Los Alamos and explain why his
name is in an old telephone directory of Los Alamos
scientists.  That article in a July, 1982 edition of the
Los Alamos Monitor, which shows a picture of Bob by a jet car
and refers to his employment as a scientist with Los Alamos,
is also hard to explain.  The two-dozen odd Los Alamos
employees who told KLAS TV's George Knapp they remember Bob
are also a pesky problem for the FBI.  The W-2 form Naval
Intelligence mailed Bob is hard to explain as well.

     On several local Las Vegas radio shows and on Chuck
Harder's national "For the People" radio show, Bob has
answered questions about the propulsion system of flying
saucers, or discs as our government calls them.  According to
documents Bob read at S-4, discs fly by amplifying gravity
waves.  Gravity is actually two waves, identified as gravity A
and gravity B.  Gravity A is at the atomic level.  That is,
the wave does not go beyond the molecular level except in
element 115.  The propulsion system is an antimatter reactor.
In the disc Bob crawled inside, the reactor was a sphere,
about the size of a medicine ball.  The top half of it was
visible in the middle of the floor.  Fuel for the reactor is
element 115, ununpentium.  On a periodic table, ununpentium
would be listed as UUP.  It has 156 neutrons, and it is a
super heavy metal.  When it is bombarded with protons, it
becomes element 116, an element that has very unusual
properties.  That is, when it comes into contact with any
element, there is almost a 100% conversion of matter into
energy.  The fuel pellet aliens use is about the size of a
fifty-cent piece, and it weighs about 223 grams.  Supporting
the claim that ununpentium is a stable element, Bob notes,
"...in that heavy ion research facility in Germany, they
just discovered that in their dabbling in transmuting
elements, and as we got higher up on the periodic chart their
half lives got shorter and shorter.  Well, for the first time
they came up with element 109, I think, and the half life
became longer, and they are seriously considering that this
may be a trend and that it may lead up to a stable element.
And they theorize that it would be in the 115 area.  And, in
fact, this is true, and this is what this element is; it is
essentially stable."

     The wave that is produced from that matter-antimatter
reaction is present on the spherical reactor.  Attached to the
reactor is a transparent wave guide which is tuned in such a
manner that it provides an easy path for the wave to take.  It
takes less effort for the wave to travel up the wave guide
than go elsewhere.  The bottom of the tapered wave guide
touches the top of the reactor, while the top of the wave
guide extends to the ceiling.  Electric power is produced in
thermoelectric generators located at the bottom of the
reactor.  The generators are virtually 100% efficient.

     The gravity amplifiers themselves are three hollow tubes
about two feet in diameter and four feet long.  They are
arranged in a triangular configuration at the bottom of the
disc.  The reactor itself is centered between the three
amplifiers because the wave is also present at the bottom of
the reactor.  The reactor acts as a transmitter, similar to a
Tesla Coil, in that each amplifier is independently turned to
function as an amplifying receiver.  Gravity waves have
amplitude, wavelength and frequency, just like any other wave.
As the amplitude is increased, gravitational waves bend space
around the disc.  Each of the three gravity amplifiers
produces its own gravitational wave, and, depending on how the
gravity amplifiers are oriented, gravity waves can be focused
on a point or spread out.  On gimbols, each amplifier can
operate independently.  The waves are phase shifted, which
changes the wave's orientation and plane from zero to 180
degrees, thereby changing the attraction or repulsion of the
wave.  When a disc operates on only one amplifier, standing on
a pedestal of gravity, it is said to operate in an omicron
configuration.  In this configuration, the other two
amplifiers are freed for other uses, such as picking up cattle
or Ed Walters.

     In the delta configuration, discs operate on all three
amplifiers.  This configuration is used in space for long
distance travel.  In space, a disc tilts over on its back so
that the gravitational amplifiers focus on where the disc is
going, and the propulsion system is powered up, amplifying
gravitational waves that are out of phase with earth's
gravity.  The amplified gravitational waves distort time and
space, or "spacetime" as it is referred to in the documents.
That gravity distorts time is known in current physics.  For
example, if you and friend have atomic clocks synchronized to
each other and your friend climbs a mountain or goes up in an
airplane, the clocks will be out of sync when your friend
returns (your clock is closer to the center of the earth).
That gravity distorts or warps space is also currently
accepted.  That is why astronomers at certain positions during
an eclipse can see stars that are directly behind the sun (the
sun's gravity causes the star's light to bend around the sun).
In short, the disc warps spacetime, attaches itself to the
warp and snaps back.  Imagine a thin sheet of rubber stretched
out (this represents space).  Now, put a ball bearing on the
sheet (this represents the disc)   Now, with your fingers
under the sheet, pinch the rubber at a point some distance
from the ball bearing keeping the rubber pinched, move the
pinch to the ball bearing.  As you bring the pinch back to its
original position, the ball bearing will follow.  This is an
analogy of what happens.

     On the nine discs, each different, kept in
interconnecting hangers, Bob had hands-on experience with one
he dubbed the "sports model" because of its sleek appearance.
It was over 35 feet in diameter.  Before he worked on it, he
was shown a short demonstration of its ascending, moving to
the left, then to the right, and then alighting.  Before
ascending, the disc briefly gave off a corona discharge, a
sound like high-voltage electricity, and then it was
completely silent, its bottom glowing blue.  The hissing and
glowing are by-products of the tremendous electromagnetic
pulses generated from the craft.  Inside the "sports model",
Bob saw a console and children-sized chairs.  There were no 90
degree angles inside, and everything appeared softly rounded.

     According to the documents, the aliens are identified as
being from Zeta 2 Reticuli, the second star of a binary system
in the constellation Reticulum.  They come from the fourth
planet out.  Although it is about 37 light years from Zeta 2
Reticuli to Earth, discs take very little time to cover the
distance because discs do not travel in a linear mode. (Speed
is defined as a distance divided by time.  And since discs
operate by warping time itself and space itself, a more
complicated formula that s+d/t is needed to describe what
happens).  It's not so much that discs break Einstein's famous
rule that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light;
it's more accurate that discs get around the rule altogether.
Recall that Einstein died trying to understand gravity.
According to Bob, gravity propagates instantly.

     When traveling at relatively slow speeds near a planet,
discs again use gravity, but in a different way.  This time
discs balance on gravity waves and "fall" in the direction
they want to go.  Although discs are more unstable in this
mode, they still can perform maneuvers that are beyond the
capabilities of conventional aircraft, such as making 90
degree turns on a dime or accelerating rapidly.  Those inside
the discs experience no G forces during these maneuvers.
