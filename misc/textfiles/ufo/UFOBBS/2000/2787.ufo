        :BEIJING (MAY 11) UPI - Chinese scientists are huddling this :
        :week to explore the latest mysteries of unidentified flying :
        :objects, from reports of sightings and abductions to claims :
        :that Chinese mystics are in contact with life on other      :

        :UFO Research Society, the national organization that        :
        :coordinates studies in China of ''fei die,'' which in       :
        :Chinese means ''flying saucer.''                            :

        :in research that spans the gamut from cold science to the   :
        :weird and wacky, including efforts to speak to outer space  :

        :since the late 1970s, with all but around 200 later         :
        :discounted as natural or man- made objects such as weather  :

        :basketballs, orange-lit washbasins and flying straw hats.   :
        :Around 40 of those are the ''close encounters'' variety,    :
        :with reports of contact or kidnappings by vaguely           :

        :night. He lost consciousness and awoke the next morning at  :
        :the park gate to find the time on his watch an hour behind  :
        :the actual time.                                            :

        :A month later, he suddenly recalled having been abducted    :

        :Along with those reports, and research into related topics  :
        :like atmospheric phenomena, some of the 3,500 CURO members  :
        :nationwide are studying claims by Chinese mystics that they :
        :can locate UFOs or communicate with aliens.                 :

        :Chinese concept of life energy, to make contact. Although   :
        :qigong is an accepted exercise discipline, adherents also   :
        :make fantastic claims of supernatural powers or faith       :
        :healing ability.                                            :

        :mysticism cannot be separated only as illogic.''            :

        :UFO research is taken seriously in China. Several years ago,:
        :a UFO sighting over an open air film show in rural south    :
        :China sparked a stampede by panicked villagers that left two:
        :people dead and 300 injured.                                :

        :But not even scientists are immune to the more outlandish   :
        :aspects of UFOs, he added, noting a report by a CURO        :
        :researcher who claimed he had been ''invited'' aboard a     :
        :space craft and taken to a planet thousands of light years  :

        :''This man was a scientist, so we don't believe that what he:
