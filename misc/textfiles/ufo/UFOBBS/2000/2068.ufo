Another opinion:-


UFO's ????

Well fancy that, just after we get over the shock of the UFO
crashing into a Mesa (in the saga of the Alien Baby), we now
have a Wembley stadium size object diving into the sea. Not
just any sea but the famous Scotland-N.Ireland-Iceland
Triangle (Berlitze all is forgiven).
To top it all, apart from being sighted and chased by the good
old Royal Navy, we then turn the all operation over to the
American Navy (so they do prefer America, and perhaps got
detoured). Well the world has got to be safe now, and thanks
Sean (GI0NOX) for letting the world know this information
before the papers get swamped with dis-information denying the
whole incident. I for one feel relieved that such good
reliable stories get out on Packet first, as the people must
be told the truth.
Can anybody else corroborate this story? Has the Clive
Database included the report?
