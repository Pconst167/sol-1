SUBJECT: UFO ONLINE CONFERENCE                               FILE: UFO2989




        This is the transcript of the informal UFO online conference
        held on November 7, Saturday night. I have edited it somewhat
        to make it more readable. Specifically, I've cut out the hellos 
        and goodbyes the ...'s, !'s, and GA's, moderator comments, and 
        some other material unrelated to the content of the discussion. 
        I've also taken the liberty of changing the order of a few of
        the lines where more than one person was talking at once, in
        order to keep the flow of the discussion sensible.

        I will e-mail the original unedited transcipt to anyone who 
        asks. Ron Holtz [71035,3440].


     Ron     | So, Marc, you said something about a Ouiji board ? 
     
     Marc    | Yeh, about ten years ago We were "contacting"(I think)
             | some aliens I know that sounds weird but at the time 
             | it seemed pretty serious. anyway, we were told that the 
             | reason they couldn't contact us was that they had evolved 
             | in much higher radiation and that their crafts were also 
             | very highly irradiated. 
     
     Ron     | Hmmm. Anyone care to comment on that ? 
     
     Joseph  | Guess not... <g>
     
     Marc    | oh well, guess not 
     
     Ron     | I can buy the part about higher radiation
             | since that's a hazard of space travel.
     
     Frank T | Somthing I just thought of. Why is it that their 
             | craft crash i.e. thery're not omnipotent.
             | and yet we don't have a sliver of evidence in adbduction 
             | cases. 
     
     Joseph  | Theory has it that everyone makes mistakes... in Roswell,  
             | the crash was precipitated by a storm the likes of which 
             | the locals there had never seen before.
     
     Frank T | Umm... What about other crashes? And Hopkins has just 
             | said that ext 2% of population are abductees.
             | You'd think we'd have an alien head by now. 
     
     susan   | We do frank
     
     Joseph  |  2%?? I think Hopkins is over-estimating IMHO 
     
     Frank T | Hey Susan where?
     
     Ron     | The famous hanger 18, Susan ? 
     
     susan   | Hi guys are you speaking of ufo abductions?
     
     Joseph  | Susan pegged it Frank, rumor has it that several alien 
             | bodies were recovered at the Roswell sight, and one may 
             | have survived a short while. 
     
     susan   | Actually I know of a Roswell victim reincarnate
             | That's him
     
     Joseph  | Reincarnated? 
     
     susan   | Yes 
     
     Joseph  |  [No comment]
     
     Al      | Frank, you are attempting to make a point, what is it? 
     
     susan   | His name is Jerry Wills and lives in Phoenix
     
     Frank T | Whay doesn't someone kill one in there bedroom?
     
     Joseph  | Eh? Kill an alien, or kill a human?
     
     Frank T | I meant why hasn't anyone killed a grey in their bedroom. 
             | ANy comments? 
     
     Ron     | Ed Walters supposed was armed in several of his encounters. 
     
     susan   | Roswell accident was due to surveillance of Air Force Nuclear 
             | explosions not abductions
     
     Joseph  | They weren't viewing the actual explosions theory has it 
             | they were checking out the base itself. It was currently
             | the only Atomic bomb base in the USA at the time. 
     
     Frank T | What atomic explosions?
     
     Marc    | Do you mind if I take a pole?
     
     Ron     | IF you mean a poll, tell me what you have in mind. 
     
     Marc    | ploe, poll, you know what I meant,...
     
     Ron     | <G>
     
     Marc    | I am just wondering who in this room believes in alien visits. 
     
     Marc    | I do 
     
     Ron     | Marc has suggested a poll on who believes that we're being 
             | visited by aliens. 
     
     Ron     | I am not sure, personally, but the stories are beleivable. 
     
     Joseph  | in other words that's a yes
     
     Brad    | I'm willing to believe, but am not well informed. 
     
     Frank T | I'm confused
     
     Leo     | How about "Have _been_ being visited" (like for how long?)
     
     Frank T | yeah 
     
     susan   | are we voting ...yes
     
     Joseph  | Leo you asked about how long we've been visited.
             | There are ancient (as in Egyptian Pharoa times) drawings  
             | and depictions many have interpreted as being those of 
             | aliens. There is one in particular (memory fails) 
             | A drawing depicting a person in a space suit reclined  
             | in an acceleration chair... (It looks a lot like an 
             | astronaut). 
     
     susan   | joseph is talking of palenque in mexico
     
     Joseph  |  <bingo>
     
     susan   | but the face on mars 
             | along with the pyramids are probably 5 million 
             | years precession of the equinoxes indicate about 600000 
             | years since the great pyramid was built...guess so 
     
     Al      | Susan, face on mars vs pyramids on earth
             | last I knew great pyramid of cheops is aprox 2,600 BC. 
             | No estimate available for face on mars if its anything at all.
     
     Ron     | There's a Mars Observer satellite on it's way to Mars right 
             | now, btw, so about a year from now we should have close-up 
             | pictures.
     
     Frank T | My friend just finished a job at a company that he says 
             | he thinks does some type of alien research and they worked 
             | on the recent mars probe. And that the probe is going to 
             | Mars specifically to look at the face region. FWIW. 
     
     Ron     | Specifically ? 
     
     Joseph  | Neg on the specifically.
             | Mars sat is going to map the entire planet and was in the 
             | design phase prior to the pics ever surfacing (Face that is) 
     
     Ron     | What is this face supposed to be, I'd never heard of it  
             | before ?  
     
     Joseph  | The "Face" is a picture found while the last orbital sat  
             | was over mars it looks a LOT like a human face looking 
             | up into the heavens. If you've ever seen the Easter Island 
             | statues, blow them up about 100 times, and you'll get an 
             | idea as to it's size. there are also several apparent 
             | pyramids in the same area. 
     
     Frank T | Joe, I've seen pictures of the face going back quite a while 
             | ago not sure how long though but it's gotta be 10 - 15 years.
     
     susan   | the pyramids on mars are in about the same alignment as the 
             | giza pyramids in egypt they are proportionately spaced and 
             | also include a five sided pyramid based onthe harmonics of 
             | the golden mean in addition to the face. also it might 
             | interest you to know the the name Cairo in arabic means Mars 
     
     Ron     | Susan, aligned how ? 
     
     susan   | the same as the giza pyramids are aligned to where magnetic 
             | north is
     
     Al      | egypt pyramids are aligned to TRUE NORTH, not magnetic north.
     
     Marc    | Any comments on the Gulf Breeze sightings anyone?  
     
     Joseph  | Gulf Breeze: The jury is still out. There are too many 
             | credible witnesses to write the whole thing off as a hoax, 
             | however, some of the photos appear to have been faked, and
             | the fact that a model of the ufo was found in the attic of 
             | the original photographer didn't help his credibility any.
     
     Ron     | The gulf breeze case is what got me interested in UFOs again
             | after I read Ed Walter's book a few months ago.
             | At first, I was floored, especially because the physicist 
             | Maccabbee wrote the chapter on the photo analysis
             | and it all made sense at first but the more I thought 
             | about it the more problems I started having
             | so I'm not sure at all any more. 
     
     Marc    | The images looked like holograms to me...?
     
     Al      | I agree with you Ron, but do not give up on UFO issues in 
             | general the issues of animal mutilations...
             | adbuctions... sightings... so forth are too numerous and 
             | varied so, yes alot of hoaxing is going on, but still
             | something is occuring and its not just weirdos or pranksters.
     
     Ron     | Oh, I intend to get to the bottom of all this Al, some day
             | but as you note, it's a problem sorting out what to believe 
             | or not and there's a need for "common sense" as you've 
             | mentioned before.
     
     Joseph  | A quick note on mutilations: Have any of you seen "Sneakers"  
             | or counted how many times Dan Akroyd stated: "Cattle 
             | Mutilations are up this year"  ? 
     
     Ron     | No, haven't seen that, but I HAVE heard that cattle 
             | mutilations have increased this year. David B says there's 
             | a cattle mutliation "flap" in Missourri this past summer. 
     
     Al      | The mutilation stuff is fasinating, especially once you've
             | seen some photgraphs of the animals taken by police in the 
             | more remote farms that do not really have reason to fake 
             | something.
             | Anyway, just a question anyone payinmg attention to crop 
             | circles in England this year? 
     
     Joseph  | First: This year no, circles in general yes. Second:
             | Mutilations are definitly up, and I've had reports of 
             | mutilations recently in Sacramento Ca, as well as numerous 
             | sightings.(UFOS).
             | Third: Take everything with a grain of salt. (in the ufology 
             | world) Hoaxers abound out there trying to make a quick buck
             | IMHO: If they are trying to sell you UFO stuff, more than 
             | likely that UFO stuff is bogus. It's the unsolicited reports 
             | that have the  most credibility, and are the most intriguing.
     
     Ron     | But on the cattle mutilations in Sacramento, how recently,  
             | and were they cattle or something else 
     
     Joseph  | I -believe- they were indeed cattle. I used to live there, 
             | and this was reported to me by a friend of mine. The 
             | sightings were as recent as last month.

             (Conference ended at this point).
