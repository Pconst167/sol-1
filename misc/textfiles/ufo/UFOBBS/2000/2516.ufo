    To all interested parties,                                   12/06/92 


      With  the recent overwhelming evidence coming to light against  the 
    claims  of  the Phoenix Project concerning  the  alleged  underground 
    alien base in the Plumas County area of northern California,  as well 
    as our own on-site physical investigation, we have decided to suspend 
    all future expeditions to the Pilot Peak/K2 site. 
     
      After  considering  our own research findings and the  findings  of 
    others  that  have been verified,  we have no other recourse  but  to 
    consider the Phoenix Project's information on the Pilot Peak/K2  Site 
    nothing more than pure fabrication and fantasy. 
     
      We  had  originally wanted to give the Phoenix Project  people  the 
    benefit  of  the doubt in our continuing investigation,  but  in  the 
    light  of our investigation,  and other important information,   (the 
    origin  of  the  "Alien  Transmission"  audio  tape  being  the  most 
    damaging,)   we feel that waiting till next spring to make one  final 
    on-site  investigation would be a waste of time,  and only  serve  to 
    give the Phoenix Project the semblance of legitimacy.
