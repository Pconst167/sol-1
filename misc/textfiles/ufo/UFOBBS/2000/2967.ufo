                    UFO APPEARS IN PHOTO
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mainichi Daily News, Tokyo, Japan - June 14, 1992      
                                                            
Montevideo (AFP-Jiji) - A snapshot purporting to show a silvery
UFO landed on the front page of an Uruguayan newspaper Friday,
after a professional photographer unknowingly recorded the
alleged flyby on film.             
                                                            
The photograph run by El Diario was taken June 1 in broad
daylight in the city of Colonia, 177 kilometers west of here, and
shows a metallic object above the local lighthouse.               
                                 
                                                            
Photographer Nilo Molina, 58, said he did not notice the
unidentified flying object when he took the picture, and was
shocked to discover the image after he developed a roll of film.
