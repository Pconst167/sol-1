ParaNet Alpha 07/13 -- The lid on the "Cosmic Watergate" has been cracked
 open another inch.  Maybe.
.
According  to  documents  released  by the  UFO  Information  Service  in
 Seattle, WA,  there is  or was  a top  secret investigation  of the  UFO
 phenomenon  called "Project  Aquarius".  Dale  Goudie,  director of  the
 service, passed these documents on to ParaNet in early May, insisting he
 could "personally attest to their legitimacy".  .
Among  the documents  are  an Air  Force telex  dated  17 November  1980,
 referring to Aquarius  and MJ-12, a rumored high-level  brain trust that
 included  General Hoyt  Vandenberg  and Dr.   Vannevar  Bush [see  files
 MJ12-1.UFO and MJ12-2.UFO].  It also makes  mention of certain other UFO
 catchphrases, such  as "CR  44", "7602nd  AINTELG (Airborne  INTELigence
 Gathering)"  and "trilateral  insignia".   The  telex is  supposedly  an
 answer  to a  request  for  information made  by  an  unknown person  at
 Kirtland AFB  in New Mexico, following  a rash of  unexplained sightings
 there.  .
Based on this document, Goudie's source  (whose name he is not revealing)
 apparently filed a Freedom of Information  Act suit against the National
 Security  Agency for  further documentation  of  Project Aquarius.   The
 letter  he  received in  return  constitutes  another of  the  documents
 received by ParaNet.   It confirms the existence of  Aquarius, but gives
 no  clues  as  to  its  purpose, except  to  say  that  release  of  the
 information would pose an "extremely grave" threat to national security.
 .
The Air Force telex can be found  in the library as AFOSI.DOC, the letter
 is NSA.DOC.  You will note the telex is classified SECRET: since receipt
 of these documents, we have been  attempting to verify their status, and
 determine  a course  of action.   According  to other  documents in  our
 possession, the Air Force position on the  telex is that it is fake, and
 we know  of at least  one copy that was  sent by the  AF itself to  a TV
 station in Los Angeles.  Hence we have decided to go public with it.  .
An analysis  of the documents,  with more details,  will appear in  a few
 days on the Bulletins menu.
