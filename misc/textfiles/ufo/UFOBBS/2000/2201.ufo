SUBJECT: DESERTERS                                           FILE: UFO2201




Well folks don't let it be said that you didn't hear it first here...
Recently I have been in contact with a gentleman by the name of Clifford
Stone. Clifford, for those of you who aren't up on recent UFOlogical
investigative history, is a former Sergeant in the United States Army, and
who has been encountering all kinds of difficulties with regards to obtaining
document through the FOIA. Because of his efforts he has been subjected to
all kinds of problems and dirty tricks, the least of which was the army
trying to get his wife, a former Vietnamees national, deported from the
country. As a result of this last effort Clifford retired from the Army this
past Feburary, and currently is still fighting the Army for some of the
things that they tried to pull on him.
Just prior to his retirement Clifford was sent on a hardship tour to...you
guessed it...the 103rd Intelligence Battalion of the 701st Intelligence
Brigade, in Augsburg, Germany. During his tour over there he became
intimately aquainted with three of the deserters recently arrested in Gulf
Breeze, Florida. Clifford told me that on more than one occassion the three
would come to his quarters after duty hours and discuss with him the subject
of UFOs and occassionally they would call him over to the tunnels at brigade
headquarters and show him bits and pieces of information that they had
gathered during the course of their duties that dealt specifically with UFOs.
Clifford knew these people intimately for over a year. It is his contention
that the story that is being publicised about them being a cult group who
went AWOL to come to Gulf Breeze and meet the Anti-Christ on August the 6th
and kill him, is a bunch of crap. He has further stated that the three people
were professionals in every sense of the word. Another point that he brought
out that I find interesting is that they (the deserters) are being held at
Fort Benning, Georgia. He as well as I find this extremely interesting since
there are other military installations much closer and just as suited to
incarcerate them.
As it has been pointed out by various other people, it would seem that
something is afoot and the army is trying to cover it up. Either the
individuals in question came accross something that made them take the action
that they did, or the government sent them there and are covering the reason
why.
Another interesting point to consider is that civilian lawyers were refused
access to the 6, being told that they do not need civilian legal counsel as
the military will provide counsel to them. It's been my experience that if
the defendant, even in a military trial, wants to hire a lawyer outside of
the military, feeling that the military counsel will not provide an adequate
defence, then it is allowed. Even when it involves classified information.
It is my feeling that it is going to get extremely sticky. Perhaps an
investigator from Paranet, UFINET, MUFON, or even CUFOS should be in Gulf
Breeze on August the 6th, just in case.
