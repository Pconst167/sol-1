    The Secret Weapon Theory 
     
    This  theory,  which was more popular in the 1950s,  refers to advanced 
    technological flying devices constructed by the U.S. government or some 
    foreign power.  The proposition has some very serious problems.  First, 
    UFOs were reported soon after World War II,  when military jet aircraft 
    were barely operational. Had the U.S. had operational "saucers" capable 
    of the performance described,  it would not have expended the  hundreds 
    of billions of dollars that it has, since that time, in the development 
    of alternate and less efficient military weapons systems. 
     
    Secondly,   even  if such craft had been experimentally tested or  even 
    operationally deployed,  they would not have been permitted to approach 
    civilian  airports,  urban centers,  and all the everyday places  where 
    UFOs  are  reported.  Also,  they would not have been deployed  to  the 
    dozens  of countries where UFOs are reported.  On the other hand,  such 
    craft  would very probably have been revealed to the world as  a  major 
    technological   breakthrough   and  as  a  warning  to  all   potential 
    adversaries.   The  political advantages of the latter would have  been 
    enormous. 
     
    A third problem would be the question of security.  The development and 
    operation  of such craft would have involved many thousands of  persons 
    over  a long period of time,  and it is almost inconceivable  that  the 
    secret would not have eventually surfaced. These same arguments can, of 
    ocurse,   be applied to a Soviet secret weapon,  or one from any  other 
    country. A British/Canadian Secret Weapon Theory, for example, was once 
    in vogue,  and one organization has been promoting a Nazi Secret Weapon 
    Theory,   interwoven  with Adolf Hitler's possible survival and  escape 
    from  Berlin.   The organization has published a book  supporting  this 
    claim  and  also makes available other Nazi-oriented  books,   posters, 
    bumper stickers, and tapes (such as "Beautiful Nazi Songs and Marches," 
    "Songs of the Brownshirts,"  "Dr.  Goebbels and the Third Reich,"   and 
    "Adolf  hitler  Speaks to the Reichstag").  As with all  other  "secret 
    weapon" theories,  it is difficult to imagine how such craft could have 
    been  operated for more than thirty years without political utilization 
    or without the truth emerging.
