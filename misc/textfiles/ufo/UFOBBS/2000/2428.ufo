In the late 1940s and 1950s some theorists thought flying saucers might be 
space animals. The first to suggest this idea, however, was Charles Fort, in 
his 1931 book Lo! where he speculated that unknown objects in the sky could be 
"living things that occasionally come from somewhere else." A few days after 
Kenneth Arnold's sighting on June 24, 1947, John Philip Bessor wrote the Air 
Force to tell it what the flying discs were: A "form of space animal" 
propelled by "telekinetic energy." These creatures might be carnivorous. "Many 
falls of flesh and blood from the sky in times past," he declared, could be 
the leftover remains of unfortunate persons eaten by hungry UFOs. In 1955 
Countess Zoe Wassilko-Serecki theorized that UFOs were "vast, luminous 
bladders of colloidal silicones" that feed on electrical energy. California 
Trevor James Constable claimed to have photographed these "critters," as he 
called them, on infrared film.
