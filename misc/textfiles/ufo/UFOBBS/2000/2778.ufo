    Dr. Mundy sent me the following:

    Support Program for Abductee's Contact Efforts (SPACE)

    If  you  are a UFO abductee,  you are invited to join S.P.A.C.E.   (the 
    Support Program for Abductee's and Contactee's Efforts). 

    The support group, founded by abductees themselves,  is being formed in 
    the New York City metropolitan area to give us a chance to talk openly, 
    to explore our experiences on the human-alien frontier and to interface 
    with it. 

    The  formation  of this interactive and proactive group  would  try  to 
    provide   understanding,   caring  support,   meaningful  feedback  and 
    professional  resources to abductees who have been traumatized by their 
    experiences  and  to encourage them toward  positive,   transformative, 
    empowerment by devleoping new life skills, overcoming fears and through 
    interaction with aliens in a middle ground situation. 

    Meetings  will  be held in private places without public  participation 
    and notice to protect individuals.  For information,  please call (718) 
    748-8913.
