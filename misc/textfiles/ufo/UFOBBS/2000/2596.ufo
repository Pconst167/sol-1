From: RICHARD P. DELL'AQUILA (ab114)
Subj: EASTLAKE UFO REPORTED BY COAST GUARD
        In a reply to a recent question from Dale Wedge, Page 
Stevens has mentioned that an unusual UFO event occurring over 
Lake Erie in early March was the result of a misidentification 
of the planets Jupiter and Venus which appeared close to each 
other in the night sky.  Page mentioned that a Coast Guard 
report on the incident "agrees fully" with the Venus/Jupiter 
hypothesis.  The report has been submitted to an astronomer for 
his expert opinion as to whether the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis 
adequately explains all the phenomena described in the report 
by the Coast Guard personnel, also reported by at least a half 
dozen other independent witnesses.
       The sightings, which have continued unabated for the 
past month, have been reported by several independent 
witnesses, one of whom took photographs. The case is being 
investigated by Rick Dell'Aquila (ab114) and Dale Wedge (ae511)
       The document confirms that members of the Coast Guard 
saw a group of strange objects cavorting on and near the icy 
surface of Lake Erie. A local astronomer attempted to explain 
the sightings as resulting from the apparent conjunction of 
Jupiter and Venus in the night sky, coupled with "spontaneous 
gas emissions" caused by viewing the conjunction through the 
Earth's atmosphere.
       The incident involves a large blimp-like object, "larger 
than the Goodyear blimp," which released up to a half dozen  
triangular-shaped lights and objects, in close proximity to the 
Perry nuclear power plant and Eastlake coal burning plant, and 
multiple independent witnesses, apparent animal reactions, as 
well as government documents, and hence qualifies for high-
priority.
       The case is officially classified as a Close Encounter 
of the Second Kind.
The Coast Guard report reads as follows:

SUBJ: INCIDENT REPORT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
PLANT.
RPTNG A LARGE OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE LAKE AND APPARENTLY ON A 
SLOW DESCENT. THE OBJECT HAD A WHITE LIGHT AND WAS APPROX. 1/4 
MILE UP. [Blanked] WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE HOW FAR OUT IT 
WAS. THIS UNIT SENT 2 CREWMEMBERS TO INVESTIGATE. BEFORE THEY 
ARRIVED O/S, WE RCVD 2 MORE CALLS RPTNG THAT THE OBJECT HAD 
APPARENTLY DISPERSED 3-5 SMALLER FLYING OBJECTS THAT WERE 
ZIPPING AROUND RATHER QUICKLY. THESE OBJECTS HAD RED, GREEN, 
WHITE AND YELLOW LIGHTS ON THEM THAT STROBED INTERMITTENTLY. 
THEY ALSO HAD THE ABILITY TO STOP AND HOVER IN MID-FLIGHT. 
WHEN MOBILE 02 GO O/S, THEY RPTD THE SAME ACTIVITY. THEY 
WATCHED THE OBJECTS FOR APPROX. 1 HOUR BEFORE RPTNG THAT THE 
LARGE OBJECT WAS ALMOST ON THE ICE. THEY RPTD THAT THE ICE WAS 
CRACKING AND MOVING ABNORMAL AMOUNTS AS THE OBJECT CAME CLOSER 
TO IT. THE ICE WAS RUMBLING AND THE OBJECT LIT MULTI-COLOR 
LIGHTS AT EACH END AS IT APPARENTLY LANDED. THE ;LIGHTS ON IT 
WENT OUT MOMENTARILY AND THEN CAME ON AGAIN. THEY WENT OUT 
AGAIN AND THE RUMBLING STOPPED AND THE ICE STOPPED MOVING. THE 
SMALLER OBJECTS BEGAN HOVERING IN THE AREA WHERE THE LARGE 
OBJECT LANDED AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES THEY BEGAN FLYING AROUND 
AGAIN. MOBILE 02 RPTD THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE SCOUTING THE 
AREA. MOBILE 02 RPTD THAT 1 OBJECT WAS MOVING TOWARD THEM AT A 
HIGH SPEED AND LOW TO THE ICE. MOBILE 02 BACKED DOWN THE HILL 
THEY HAD BEEN ON AND WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE HILL, THE 
OBJECT WAS GONE. THEY RPTD THAT THE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE SEEN 
IF THEY TURNED OFF THERE LIGHTS. ONE OF THE SMALL OBJECTS 
TURNED ON A SPOTLIGHT WHERE THE LARGE OBJECT HAD BEEN BUT 
MOBILE 02 COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING, AND THEN THE OBJECT SEEMED TO 
DISAPPEAR. ANOTHER OBJECT APPROACHED MOBILE 02 APPROX. 500 YDS. 
OFFSHORE ABOUT 20 FT. ABOVE THE ICE, AND IT BEGAN MOVING CLOSER 
AS MOBILE 02 BEGAN FLASHING ITS HEADLIGHTS, THEN IT MOVED OFF 
TO THE WEST.
USING BINOCULARS AND AFTER CONTACTING LOCAL POLICE AND 
AIRPORTS, THIS UNIT WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECTS, AND 
RECALLED MOBILE 02.

       The Coast Guard report for the following evening 
suggests that the Coast Guard had misidentified the planets 
Jupiter and Venus.
       I ask the astronomers on this board, skeptical or 
otherwise, for their opinions as to the adequacy of the Venus/ 
Jupiter hypothesis in light of this report.
       Page, I ask you whether the foregoing report "fully 
agrees" with the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis, and also whether you 
believe that these Coast Guard personnel, experts in their own 
way and no doubt familiar with the night sky and celestial 
navigation, could have so grossly misidentified the planets for 
several hours.
