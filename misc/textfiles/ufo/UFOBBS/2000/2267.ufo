                  I have been asked to resend this under debate. Thank you.
           Hello, I have been reading the UFO info that has been put on the
my local bbs. I would like to make a few observations if I may.

I have heard that the US has a hanger full of UFO's or at least one UFO. 

(1) I have great scepticism about UFO reportings. However, I have read 
enough and heard enough reports from truly credible witnesses, that I must 
confess to a certain respect for the possibility that they do exist.

(2) From a totally different perspective, I wonder why people should find
the idea of extra terrestrial beings so hard to accept?  I believe that it is
totally unreasonable to believe that beings do not or could not exist on
other solar systems.

(2) First off, the statistics would guarantee that there would be millions of
suitable planets for life in our Galaxy alone.

(3) Of all the scientific theories I have heard about the origin of man, the
least "scientific" conclusion is that it all happened as an accident of
Nature. Then things started to get a little complicated and beautifully
integrated... all by accident!  Mr Darwin was an astute in his observation
of a grand organisation in nature.  The whole idea of his origins of species,
however, is so devoid of any shred of proof.  He certainly provided none,
that i can hardly believe the scientific community ever seriously considered
it. That it is currently popularly accepted is a telling comment on the
ability of people to believe the absurd in place of any original thought.
This is, unfortunately, common in popular scientific thought (ie. it has been
"proven" that the bumble bee cannot fly.)

(4) Things are so beautifully integrated and complicated in the biological
world alone; That any appeal to other than intelligent creation begs reason.
If, then, man were placed on Earth intentionally by a benevolent man, being,
God, or what ever, then why would he stop at Ear
th?
I firmly believe there are people that re-define the meaning of distant
relatives.  Could they possibly visit the Earth?  Why not?  Some say God did.
That is assuming that God does exist of course.
Why would they be benevolent?   Why not?   Would they mess with our human 
civilisation?  I doubt it.  Could they make mistakes and crash here?
Why not, we do!

Now let me say this about these UFO's that are supposed to be in this hangar
in the US. Nothing has been said by any one, except the guesses made, and the
stories that fly about mean nothing.  There is nothing that can be kept so
secret as a so called space craft from another world.  Some one some where
would leak this information to the world some how.  It is too big a story for
Christ sake!  And sure as eggs is eggs these intelligent beings aint going to
knock on the door of the White House or 10 Downing street, the Kremlin or
what ever, and say "Would you look after us old man, our space craft has gone
and broken down?"  Being intelligent beings, would YOU trust a politician?

I thank you for you're time in reading this, and would welcome you're views.
