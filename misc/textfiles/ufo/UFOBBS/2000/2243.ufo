                           Abstract

     In 1976 an unmanned NASA Viking spacecraft successfully 
photographed the surface of the planet Mars.  In the subsequent 
13 years, a mystery has loomed . . . a mile-long, 1500-ft high 
humanoid "face" discovered in a northern Martian desert called 
"Cydonia."  Initially dismissed by NASA as "a trick of light and 
shadow," new analysis presented here reveals a far more complex 
situation, and a far more significant conclusion:

     The "face" and its surrounding "enigmatic landforms" appear 
to be a carefully layed out, highly-sophisticated, redundantly 
encoded "mathematical and geometric CETI message" on the Martian 
landscape -- in the tradition of century-old proposals by Gauss, 
Lockyer, et al..

     This paper presents the evidence whereby the authors have 
reached this "radical conclusion."  We -- one of us a former NASA
consultant, the other a geomorphologist -- detail the extensive 
geodedic and mathematical analysis of "the Face" we have 
conducted over the past several years: specifically, its 
geometric relationship to other, equally enigmatic objects in the
immediate vicinity.  This evidence includes multiple appearances 
of two specific mathematical constants: "e" and "pi," derived by 
angular measurement of the placement of key morphological objects
around the "face" and the discovery of redundant angles and 
derived constants from that placement.  We have also discovered 
the two constants -- "e" and "pi" -- "coded" in the geodedic 
siting latitude of the "complex" on the planet.

     It is this multiple, diversified, but converging geodedic, 
geometric and mathematical evidence that, in the authors' 
opinion, now robustly supports the "radical conclusion" presented
above.

     The geometry and mathematical constants we have discovered 
at Cydonia appear to be a highly-specific communication of 
"embedded tetrahedral geometry."  It's apparent purpose: the 
geometric

prediction of a specific geodedic latitude -- 19.5 degrees N. and
S. -- resulting from the location of the vertices of a 
"circumscribed tetrahedran" rotated inside a planetary or stellar
sphere.   This conclusion is reinforced by the geomorphological 
observation of a major "tetrahedral pyramid" at Cydonia -- 
connected geometrically (by a 19.5-degree angle offset to the 
local geodedic meridian) to equally obvious morphological 
representations of "spheres" at Cydonia itself.

     The purpose of all this appears to be to direct attention 
towards "something occurring at these two specific planetary 
latitudes."  When examined by the authors, using published 
geodedic planetary maps from NASA and U.S Geological Survey 
sources, these latitudes are observed to be associated with a 
hitherto unknown planetary and stellar energy phenomenon -- 
blatantly emerging at these specific latitudes -- on astronomical
objects all across the solar system, including the Sun.  Further,
the appearance of these "energy outpourings" seems to be 
modulated by the polarity of the planetary (or stellar) magnetic 
dipole moment -- raising, in the author's minds, the possibility 
that the "message" is attempting to direct us to a verifiable 
astrophysical manifestation of a basic, "unified field," 
connecting planetary angular momentum, gravity, and 
electromagnetism with surface energy release.

     The possibility that "the message" is directing us to, not 
merely energy transfer but energy generation, is also considered 
in this paper.  Several convergent observations of the outer 
planets, most recently from Voyager 2, are presented to buttress 
our contention that we may be looking at a new astrophysically-
significant form of energy.  Evidence is also presented that some
manifestations of this energy may be altering the local 
"gravitational space-time metric" -- consistant with current 
theoretical interpretations of tetrahedral mathematics by 
specialists, as "representative of higher-dimensional n-spaces."

     The implications of these "real world" geophysical 
manifestations of "unified field tetrahedral mathematics" -- 
specific, localized energy release on planetary surfaces, 
apparently unrecognized until the "Cydonia tetrahedral 
mathematics" were decoded by the authors -- are profound: ranging
from a possible breakthrough in the centuries-long search for a 
Unified Field Theory connecting the four elemental forces of 
Nature; to possible technological applications of this knowledge 
-- including a new energy source, and possibly, ultimate control 
of gravity itself.

     We conclude by urging immediate verification of the "Cydonia
Message," via the 1992 unmanned Mars Observer spacecraft, as well
as detailed follow-up to our preliminary work presented here.
