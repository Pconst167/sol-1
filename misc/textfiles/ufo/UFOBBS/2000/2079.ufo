  A Kettering couple who believe they saw a UFO are appealing for
other people who may have spotted the object to come forward.
  Nicola and Peter Minney saw a triangular object with a brilliant
white light hanging in the sky just after 5 this morning.
  They say the object looked as though it was above the Kettering
rugby ground and then moved out of view above their Piper's Hill
Road home.
  A spokesman for the Met. Office said sometimes there were
thunderstorms in the distance and the clouds became brightly
illuminated which could be mistaken for UFO's.
