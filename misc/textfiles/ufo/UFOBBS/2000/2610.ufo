   UFO SIGHTING REPORTS
==========================

Ever since 1947, when a private pilot flying over the state of Washington
reported seeing nine crecscent shaped objects flying in formation, the UFO
(Unidentified Flying Object) phenomenon has been one of the greatest mysteries
of our time.

Most people are aware of the basic questions and controversies surrounding
UFOs, namely, where are they from?  Do they even exist?  If not, why are they
reported?  What many are not aware of, however, is the extent of the
phenomenon.  According to the latest available Gallup poll, 49% of Americans
believe flying saucers are from outer space, and 1 in 10 believes he or she has
seen one.  Many people are surprised to learn that the number of reports since
1947 exceeds 112,000 in this country alone, and that reports are still coming
in at the rate of 300-400 a year.

This file contains data collected from several organizations which gather
and analyze UFO sighting reports.  One of these is the UFO Information
Service, a computer database in Seattle, WA, which regularly posts the latest
sightings on a public bulletin board system. Another is the National UFO
Reporting Center, also in Seattle, which collects reports through a telephone
hotline known to most police stations and military bases.  A third is
ParaNet, which emphasizes the need for more thorough scientific investigation
of the UFO phenomena, and has devised the rating system by which sighting
reports are classified here according to "Strangeness" (the degree to which
each reported phenomenon challenges our world view) and "Probablity"
(a subjective estimate of the credibility of each sighting report). 

STRANGENESS/PROBABILITY RATINGS

At the bottom of each sighting report you will see ratings which assess the
case in terms of Strangeness and Probability on a five-point scale as
outlined below.  This rating system is used by the ParaNet BBS network of the
NFSIS to help quantify the credibility of sighting reports, and the challenge
they present to our world view.  

The ratings are appended to reports received from other sources, including the
Computer UFO Network (CUFON), but the Strangeness/Probability ratings are NOT
generated by CUFON, which as a matter of policy does not speculate.

S: Strangeness
--------------

The "Strangeness" factor of a case description is rated from 1 to 5 as follows:

    1 - Explained or Explainable
    2 - Probably Explainable, with more data
    3 - Possibly Explainable, but with elements of strangeness
    4 - Strange; Does not conform with known principles
    5 - Highly Strange; Definitely indicative of intelligent guidance

Examples:

    S1 - Aircraft, meteor, etc.
    S2 - Experimental aircraft; planet or star
    S3 - Slow, low flying objects in formation
    S4 - BOL (Ball of Light Phenomena); physical traces
    S5 - Close Encounters, Abductions, etc.


P: Probability
--------------

The "Probability" factor of a case relates to the credibility, number and
separation of witnesses and/or the soundness of evidence gathered. It is rated
from 1 to 5 as follows:

    1 - Not credible or sound
    2 - Unreliable; smacks of hoax
    3 - Somewhat credible or indeterminate
    4 - Credible; sound
    5 - Highly credible, leaving almost no doubt

Examples:

    P1 - Known hoaxer or UFO "Flake"; hoax photo
    P2 - Repeat witness; conflicting testimony
    P3 - Standard, first-time witness; slight radiation reading
    P4 - Multiple witnesses; pilot; clear photo
    P5 - National figure; multiple independent witnesses; videotape

The composite Strangeness/Probability Rating of a case consists of the combined
S & P factors, except that cases with an S factor of 1 are not assigned a P
rating.

SIGHTING CLASSIFICATIONS

Each report is also classified by the type of sighting, whether Close
Encounter (CE), Nocturnal Light (NL), Radar Visual (RV), etc.  

The following are the classifications of the various types of UFO reports
according to proximity and activity, as suggested by J. Allen Hynek and
implemented by the Computer UFO Network.  They are not to be confused with the
ParaNet S/P rating, which is a subjective estimation of the "worth" of
a sighting report. 

 o LONG RANGE SIGHTINGS (more than 500 ft distance from the object)

   - LRS-DD: Daylight Disk
   - LRS-NL: Nocturnal Lights
   - LRS-RV: Radar/Visual

 o CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (within 500 ft distance from the object)

   - First Kind (CE-1): Simple sighting of object
   - Second Kind (CE-2): Object interacts with environment (includes
electromagnetic effects, ground traces, radiation, animal excitement)
   - Third Kind (CE-3): Witness sights occupant(s) in or around object
   - Fourth Kind (CE-4): Occupants communicate with witness in some manner
   - Fifth Kind (CE-5): Abduction of witness

The remainder of this file contains representative UFO sighting reports
organized acording to the above-described ParaNet Strangeness scale, starting
with a few explained or explainable reports with Strangeness ratings of 1 (for
illustration) and progressing to Strangeness ratings of 5 - "Highly Strange;
Definitely indicative of intelligent guidance".

A red glowing light with a tail that flared across the sky in the southeast
prompted searches in several states for traces of a possible meteor or other
space object, but no remants have been found, authorities said Tuesday.

The flashing light was spotted about sunset Monday over parts of Tennessee,
Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi as it streaked westward, and aviation
officials said it was probably a meteor.

Maj. Walter Chipchase, a spokesman for the North American Air Defense Command,
said the light was not believe to be a disintegrating rocket or satellite.
"NORAD did not detect any rocket body or space debris re-entering the
atmosphere," he said.

Sgt. Ray Williams, a spokesman for Eglin Air Force Base in Fort Walton, Beach,
Fla., also said no weather balloons or flights were launched from the base at
the time the light was seen.

Although authorities said the object likely burned in the atmosphere hundreds
of miles from Earth, some local officials looked for fragments in fields and
other areas where residents reported sightings.

Joe Keltch, a deputy with the Rhea County Sheriff's Department in East
Tennessee, said he scoured an area near Graysville where a caller told
authorities something had fallen out of the sky.

"We got a report that it might have been a piece of a plane," he said. "We
looked around and didn't find anything."

Fireball Not Man-Made, Experts Say

Defense experts Tuesday eliminated "space junk or any man-made object" as an
explanation for a mysterious meteoric fireball that streaked across the Pacific
Coast.

The object, sighted at 8:22 p.m. (CST) Monday, dazzled stargazers from the
California-Oregon border to the Los Angeles area.

"It looked like a long, green meteor but it lasted way too long, arcing across
the sky toward the ocean, then it just blew up," Roy Jackson of Mountain View,
Cal., said.

"It wasn't space junk or any man-made object re-entering the atmosphere, and we
don't track meteors," Del Kindschi of the North American Aerospace Defense
Command at Denver said.  "We heard about it but there weren't any satellites or
man-made space objects entering the atmosphere at that time." (UPI)

A witness who was awakened by a severe headache, went to her kitchen for some
aspirin.  She looked out the window and observed a lighted UFO.  She told
reporters that she noticed that the object was moving all over, not like the
stars in the sky which were not moving about.  She thought that she might be
seeing a star, but after watching for quite a length of time, she decided that
this definately was no star, aircraft, or planetary body.

A witness reported observing a bright green light descending from an
approximate elevation of 60 d to about 30 d, directly in front of him. The
light did not seem to leave a trail, and did not flicker or vascillate in any
way. It took about 3 seconds to cover the distance. At the 30 d position it
just disappeared behind a cloud. Weather conditions were scattered low clouds,
and about 45 d f. The witness said the speed and the size did not seem to
correlate with a meteor. The witness said he checked with Lowell Observatory in
Flagstaff, AZ, about 75 miles north, and no meteors had been reported. The
International Center For UFO Research in Scottsdale, AZ, had several recent
reports of a similar nature.

One witness observing while driving east-bound a bright green incandescent
about the one o'clock position from his car.

It descended to about 35 degrees, vertically with a very slight horizontal
component rela- tive to himself, in about one second. Witness said: At the 35
degree position it did not fade out but rather blinked out.

He said: It seemed to be describing an eastward trajectory in its descent. The
witnesses vehicle was moving at approximately 30 mph at the time of the
sighting.

There were no aircraft in the vicinity at this time witness said.

The witness is a private pilot with about 85 hours flying time logged, and does
not wear glasses.

The witness said: If he had to compare the object with a known terrestrial
object, it would be like an aircraft flare, except that aircraft flares do not
blink out, they fade, and last much longer, and usually fall straight down.

I am in question as to a phenomenon I observed about three weeks ago.  It was
about 8:30 pm and looking out my window, I noticed a white light in the sky. I
watched for several minutes as the lights grew dim, and brightened again. It
did this about 4 - 5 times per-minute. I got a small 30 - power telescope that
I had gotten from a friend, and watch the object for about two more minutes.

As I watched, the lights continued to brighten and dim.  When bright, it looked
somewhat like viewing a spotlight from a distance of 20 yards. When it dimmed
down, I could see no shape, but only a speck that looked like a dying ember.
During the whole time, the object hovered, absolutely motionless. after about
three minutes it began to move across the sky at high speed, although from that
distance, my perception may have been fooled. However, it must have been moving
fairly rapidly, as it moved from the position it was to the southeast across
the sky and disappeared over the horizon. Yet it moved that distance in 30
seconds. I connot estimate how far the UFO was from me, but it seemed to be no
more than 4 - 5 miles, however, as  I said, I could not accurately judge the
distance, but it had the appearance of being that distance. I watch for it the
following night, but it appeared nowhere. I cannot say what it was.

On Oct 17, several Wilton residents in the Danbury and Grumman Hill road area
phoned Wilton police with sightings of strange red lights. The lights hovered
at treetop level for four to five minutes, started to move slowly and then
disappeared.

One witness from Crosswicks Ridge said: She and her son on Thursday night both
saw a huge, hovering object which looked like a spaceship. It flew low in the
sky but didn't make any noise, she said.

About the same time that night a man who asked not to be identified said: He
saw a strange light in the sky. Apparently, other people saw it too, he said,
because several cars traveling north on Route 7 pulled over to the shoulder for
a look at the sky.

Early Thursday evening, a witness on Grumman Avenue reported having seen
strange red lights moving at treetop level in a northwest direction.

The witness said: The lights were very distinct, with no form and were moving
very slowly. A reporter with The Danbury News-Times said: She was out in the
field on an assignment on Thursday night when she saw strange, V shaped red
lights move silently through the night sky.

A witness was driving south on N.C. 226 near her home in Shelby Sunday night
when she had a close encounter with a perfectly round orange object hovering in
the sky.

As the witness kept driving, she said the object grew larger and the orange
light it was emitting intensified and began blinking. She was scared and
thought it was going to land in her front yard.

She said it didn't land but disappeared just as she was pulling up to her
house. She said when the object disappeared, it left a "trail of smoke."

County Sheriffs Department said three other people called, all within 15
minutes of each other, to report a bright light traveling west to east.

The Sheriff's department contacted the Federal Aviation Administration in
Charlotte, which reported no unusual flight experiments over the area or planes
in distress.

The witness said she didn't think the object she saw was a plane. At first, she
said she thought it might have been a blinking light on top of a tower. But as
it grew in size and intensity. she could tell that it wasn't.

Widsom rancher Larry Seare and his wife Norell reported seeing eight or nine
separate lights in a staggered formation flying at about 100 miles per hour in
a northerly direction over the valley toword the West Pioneer Mountains.  The
witnesses said they were not helicopters nor jets performing night maneuvers.
He said he could see no body shapes of any type. The lights were in different
patterns in a staggered line.  He said far behind the others was a single
bright reddish colored light.  Some of them flashed at different intervals and
some of the smaller lights in the front stayed off more than the bigger ones. 
He said it was really kind of odd they didn't blink in the same pattern that
wing tip lights do.  He called the Butte/Silver Bow police.  Meanwhile, another
witness reported seeing a "V" formation of lights in the Timber Butte area.

A Lorraine McIntee said she saw six lights in the first group and three
trailing further behind.  They came from over the Timber Butte area and went
over the airport and disappeared in to a cloud bank.  Officials at Malstrom Air
Force Base in Great falls said they picked up nothing unusual on their radar
and knew of no night maneuvers over Southwestern Montana.

All witnesses said there were no sounds coming from the lights.  Also all the
witnesses turned off their cars and rolled down their windows and didn't even
breathe.  Witnesses said if it would have been airplanes or jets or helicopters
there would have been some sound.

near the East side.

The witness said while driving home to DeForest St. shortly after 5 pm Friday,
on highway CV, near Chase Lumber, he said: he saw three white lights hovering
20 to 30 feet above a farmhouse.

At first I thought it was an airplane, then I thought it was a helicopter, and
then I realized I didn't know what it was. The witness said: The craft was
roughly triangular, with its bottom sloped into contours. He said: It was
noiseless and disappeared when he got out of his car to investigate.

Joe Durkin, Madison Police spokesman said: His department received a similar
report from a Madison woman Nov. 19.  Durkin said: officers generally don't
write reports after talking to people who claim to have seen UFO's. But this
woman sounded normal, he said. The woman said: She saw a flying saucer, with a

police it had three white lights below it.

Mystery lights return to Saratoga

 By Kathy Holub
 Mercury News Staff Writer

A beautiful apparition has been glowing in the night sky over Saratoga, leaving
viewers baffled and entranced.

About 15 people, all agog, called Santa Clara County dispatchers on Tuesday
night to report a mysterious bright red light that hovered in the sky from 8:15
to 8:30 and then disappeared.

Dozens of callers described a similar phenomenon on Oct. 16, same time, same
place.

"It was very exciting," said Maureen Denton of Los Gatos, who watched last
week's display during a break in her real estate class at West Valley College.

"It was very bright, much larger than the lights you see on airplanes.  At one
point, something burning or flickering dropped from it.  It was just a tiny
little flicker that came down.  We all went: `Oooh, what was that?'"

No one seems to know.

That includes Vicki Yauger of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday night
while lounging with her husband in thier backyard spa.

Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving
toward them, then away.

Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights.

"It was scary.  When it started getting larger, it seemed to be coming down,"
she said.

Yauger didn't see the object fade from view because she had just gone into the
house.  Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly disappeared.

Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their
airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force
Base in Lompoc said they didn't launch a thing Tuesday night.  Ditto for Oct.
15.

Other watchers of the night sky - air traffic controllers and astronomers at
Lick Observatory - said they saw nothing unusual.

A guard reported to have seen several cylinder/cone shaped objects in a wooded
area while he was making his rounds.  He went into the woods to investigate and
stated that the light from these objects could be seen reflecting off the
trees.  The guard immediately notified the U.S. Air force, local police
department, and the FAA.  All of the government agencies that he called
referred him elsewhere.  None were able to give an explanation.

Nassau County police said last night, the unidentified object moving across the
evening skies was a blimp.

But then again, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port Authority
police said it was a prank by small planes flying in formation.

More than two dozen Nassau residents phoned Newsday last night to report a
strange, silent object with blinking lights crossing north by northeast over
Valley Stream, West Hempstead, Garden City, New Hyde Park, Westbury and Port
Washington. One witness reported that she and her husband were in Manhasset
about 8:30 p.m. when they saw an object like a kite....moving slowly through
the sky.

There were white and red lights flashing on and off.  It was a seven-dot
configuration. Then it changed from a triangular shape to an oval shape.

It was quite large.  It was low enough so that If it was a plane, you would
have heard the motor.

After South Shore precincts received more than 50 telephone queries a car was
dispatched to the Hempstead area about 8:45 p.m. Officers Paul Scheibelein and
Robert Schiller of the Fifth Precinct identified the object as a blimp.

They said they could see the oval shape and identify the runing lights.

Port Authority police and the FAA said the UFO was probably four or five small
planes flying in formation.

Subsequent investigation has turned up no authorized airship activity in the
area in question.

At 9:45 P.M.  the UFO Information Service in Seattle Washington received a
report of a UFO sighting that took place at Gighorbor, which is in the State of
Wash.

Three Witnesses reported observing a UFO Unidentified Flying Object. They
Stated that they first noticed the object hovering over some houses.

The witnesses said the UFO or object was oval shaped and said the color of the
object was blue. They stated when the UFO left the area it went straight up and
out of sight from them. They also stated that there was "no sequel to any
movement that the object made". This could be the same object that was reported

oval shaped and in both cases the object was blue. Interesting also is the
duration in both cases of 3 minutes.

A local air-traffic controller and a police helicopter pilot reportedly tracked
about 60 unidentified aircraft over Tucson Monday, but federal author- ities
are not investigating. Tucson International Airport radar picked up the
aircraft at 12:15 a.m. Monday. Radar monitored the objects for about 90 min.
The radar picked them up southwest of the city, near Ryan Field, and lost them
as they flew northeasterly through Redington Pass. The controller reported that
15 groups of four to six objects each were monitored on the radar. the UFOs
were travelling at about 250 knots, or 288 mph. The tower called the police
pilot on duty and said that they had some targets but no transponders.  The
transponders are radar transceivers that automatically identify individual air
craft for air traffic controllers. If you don't turn your transponder on, all
it shows up as (on radar) is a blip. The pilot tried to follow the objects and
did see some lights,but was unable to catch up with them. The pilot was up
about 4,000 feet and they were up at 7,000 feet. The Air Force said d-m jets
stop flying by 10:30 pm  and knew of no other military flights in the area at
12:15 AM Monday.

Soldiers and civilians around Ft. Devens have been keeping an eye on the sky in
the wake of several recent re- ports of UFO's sighted in the local area.
Witnesses said the UFO's looked like two glowing orange spheres. Eight
different individuals have reported seeing these over the past ten days.
According to the Boxboro, Mass. police log, the UFOs were first sighted by two
police officers on Oct. 19. Said patrolman Stephen Trefry, along with his
partner Robert Morrill: We saw two bright orange lights hovering over the tree
tops. We watched them for about 10 seconds, then they disappeared. Morrill
immediately radioed their sighting back to Boxboro police station. Suddenly
they observed the objects again about 150 yards away. moving diagonally over
the hillside, the UFO's lights glowed for another few sec- onds then
disappeared. Marcie Robinson, a physical therapist at Emerson Hospital was
driving her two daughters to school when they observed two round orange balls
high over a pasture off Prescott Road. Normally skeptical about UFO's, Robinson
admitted,"i'm not sure if there's a simple explanation for what we saw."

ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A mysterious unidentified flying object with flashing white
and yellow strobe lights followed a Japan Air Lines cargo jet across the Arctic
Circle, the crew says.

The three-man crew radioed air traffic controllers in Anchorage that a huge UFO
was flying "in formation" with them and the Air Force briefly confirmed and
object near the plane, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul
Steucke.

He said the FAA in Anchorage and Fairbanks did not pick up the object.  The
incident occurred Nov.17 but was not made public earlier.

Flight 1628 had left Reykjavik, Iceland, flying over the North Pole to Tokyo
with a stop in Anchorage.  When it landed at Anchorage, FAA security manager
Jim Derry interviewed the pilot, Co-pilot and flight engineer.  When the report
was made to the Air Route Traffic Control Center at 6:19 p.m., Steucke said
controllers tried to find the object on radar but "were unable to comfirm a
second target with our equipment."

At 6:26 p.m. Steucke said the Air Force told the FAA it "saw a second target
(object) 8 miles away (from the JAL jet) but they contacted us a mimute later
and said they were no longer receiving any radar return (of a second object)."

Steucke added, "At 6:32 the JAL pilot requested and received permission for a
descent from 35,000 feet to 31,000."  Air controllers asked if the lights were
still there, and were told, "It is descending in formation." At 6:39 p.m.,20
minutes after the lights first reported, the JAL crew said it no longer saw the
lights.

At 6:45 p.m. Fairbanks controllers authrized a United Airlines northbound jet
to make a 10 degree turn to better view the JAL plane and asked the United crew
if it saw anything besides the Boeing 747.  It did not. Nor did the JAL crew
see the lights again.

Witness got up around 4:15 - 5:15 a.m. to go to restroom and saw an object over
her home that covered five other homes as well.  The object was huge, pure
white and had no lights.  The object was the shape of a saucer and rotating. 
Even though the object was bright (brighter than any object she had ever seen)
it did not hurt her eyes to look at it.  She had no fear and wanted to run out
of her home and stand underneath the object but felt paralyzed.  The object did
return and her 12 year old son was able to see it.  Since the incident she has
had visions which she did not experience prior to the sighting of the object.
