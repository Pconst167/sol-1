SUBJECT: THE RECALL                                          FILE: UFO2649




 
    First, before I go into detail about my 1988 experience I want to thank 
    all  of  you for your interest and possible support.  I  hope  I  don't 
    disappoint any of you. 
     
    As  I  mentioned at the onset of my threads,  understanding where I  am 
    coming  from  is  an  essential element to how  you  may  look  at  the 
    submission of facts and that is why I uploaded "The Recall"  and why  I 
    listed the stories I have written along with their copyright dates. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      My  incident  took  place roughly three months after  writing  "Sayo" 
    which was about my second OBE or Astral flight. And,  by this time felt 
    positively  convinced,  beyond any doubt,  that what I was experiencing 
    was *REAL.* 
    
      Also  by this time I had listened to John Lear speak on a late  night 
    radio  talk show on numerous occasions and though I somehow  knew  that 
    much  of  what he said was true,  I  rapidly got sick and tired of  him 
    always saying the same thing. "If you see a flying saucer, run for your 
    life." So tired that on several occasions I tried to call the Las Vegas 
    station using their 800 number. I never got through and finally gave up 
    trying. I also quit listening to the show. 
    
      The night the tribulation happened was on my first night off and  had 
    gone  to bed early since I wasn't actively working on any writing.   At 
    roughly 1:30 a.m, September 13, 1988, I  woke up and at first I thought 
    someone  had called my name.  Which would have been impossible since  I 
    live alone. Anyway,  whatever caused my waking did so in such away that 
    further  sleep was impossible.  This being the case I got up  and  went 
    into my front room thinking that since I was up, maybe I should do some 
    more writing. 
    
      True,  I  wasn't working on anything important but I did have another 
    novel in progress. I hadn't gotten beyond chapter three and for me this 
    was very unusual.  Before this,  when the urge to write hit,  the words 
    nearly jumped onto the screen. 
    
      Instead  of turning on the computer,  I  turned on the radio and  the 
    first voice I heard was Art Bell talking to his guest, John Lear. 
    
      At  this point I wanted to turn the radio off,  but I  couldn't.   An 
    inner  force,   forced  me to sit down and listen  and  I  endured  his 
    comments.  That night he was speaking about the vortex at Blue Diamond, 
    saying  that  this  was  one of the points  that  the  UFOs  enter  our 
    dimension. This too, was old hat but the topic quickly changed when one 
    of  the  callers asked about Area 51.  That did it.  Area 51   and  the 
    government  coverup  was  John's favorite topic and he  went  into  his 
    normal squeal saying, "Run for your life." 
    
      That did it for me, too. I picked up the telephone and dialed the 800 
    number even though I honestly never thought I would get in.  But I did. 
    Art  answered  the  call on the first ring and when he asked  me  if  I 
    wanted  to talk to John,  I  nearly panicked.  Everything I planned  on 
    saying during all the other attempts vanished from my mind and I  found 
    myself almost speechless. I should have remained that way. I managed to 
    tell  John  I though he was full of it.  (I believe I used the  correct 
    four-letter word,  too) Naturally,  he wanted to know what I meant so I 
    told him. 
    
      Talk about a disaster. 
    
      John  wouldn't  have  anything to do with my  idea  that  there  were 
    hundreds,   perhaps thousands of Incarnates walking on the  planet  who 
    came from the stars.  He wasn't bending an inch and kept insisting only 
    bad aliens visited the Earth. 
    
      But he did ask me why I thought this. What could I do? As I mentioned 
    by  this time,  I  fully believed what I was writing as truth so I told 
    him that I myself, might even be one.  For that I got a quick laugh and 
    a quicker,  disconnect.  And,  as expected,  for the next fifteen or so 
    minutes the calls went something like: 
    
      'Who was that nut up at Tahoe.' 
    
      'Somebody  better get the guys in white coats up there before he does 
    some  damage.'   Etc.   Turning off the radio I went back  to  bed  and 
    immediately dropped off to sleep. I  woke just as suddenly but I wasn't 
    in my bed. 
    
      At  first  I didn't know where I was because I couldn't see  anything 
    because  a tremendously bright light shown down on my body.  It felt so 
    close, I could feel the heat it radiated and at the time I felt certain 
    the light would actually burn me. 
    
      I'm not sure,  but at that point I must have screamed because  that's 
    when  I got my first glimpse of one of the beings.  But it was  only  a 
    shadow and I knew right away I didn't want to be where I was.   Without 
    anyone saying anything, the light gradually dimmed as it rose and as it 
    did,   several other figures closed in.  This time I could see them.  I 
    have no doubt at all that I screamed when this happened.  I  also tried 
    to  move,   to get off the bunk,  bed,  or whatever I was  on,   but  I 
    couldn't. I couldn't move anything except my head and I could only move 
    that, sideways. 
    
      "You have been a bad boy, Jack." I wanted to know who said that.  The 
    thing standing at my side couldn't have. He didn't have a mouth and the 
    only thing I saw on his swollen head was large black eyes. The only way 
    I  can  describe those eyes is to say they appeared  fathomless.   They 
    reminded  me of the eye's of a deer I shot on my one and  only  hunting 
    trip. 
    
    [Note.  At this point in time I hadn't read or even heard of Strieber's 
    book,  Communion.  The only book I had read dealing with any aliens was 
    "Light Speed,"  and it referred to Meier's experiences in dealing  with 
    the  race who came from the Plaiedes.] When I realized that the voice I 
    heard  wasn't really a voice but only a feeling --  [like one gets when 
    reading  to  oneself  or  silently talking  to  oneself]  --   I   knew 
    instinctively the words came telepathically. The knowledge didn't help. 
    If  anything,   it  frightened  me  even more  because  my  only  other 
    telepathic thought transference was through whom I called Ya. 
    
      By this time the bright light faded enough for me to see the room and 
    the other creatures.  And, creature's was the only word to describe the 
    things  moving  about the low table I lay on.  None of them stood  over 
    four  feet tall and most stood only about three feet tall.  I   counted 
    five  or six of these beings.  The only thing any of them had in common 
    was their big swollen heads,  big eyes and grayish skin.  The character 
    standing next to me was the most human-like because he was the only one 
    that had four fingers and a thumb on each hand. The others had only two 
    or three fingers.  They all wore the same thing, a  one piece suit.  It 
    consisted of boots and gloves and had they not been in different colors 
    I could have said they weren't clothes but merely part of their bodies. 
    Talk about wearing something that was skin tight. 
    
      The   room  I  was  in,   wasn't  what  I  expected  considering  the 
    circumstances. Being abducted by space aliens, and I knew I was,  would 
    normally mean being taken aboard a UFO.  But I knew I wasn't on a  ship 
    of  any  kind  because the walls were rock and they extended  at  least 
    fifteen  feet  in one direction and ten feet in the other.   The  walls 
    appeared grainy. Not that I ever got to see much because various pieces 
    of  strange  equipment filled the room.  The wall closest to me  looked 
    like it had a mirror on it, a mirror that must have been five feet wide 
    and at least three feet high. 
    
      How I took all this in,  I don't know because since I first woke, the 
    voice kept saying the same thing, that I was a bad boy. I guess my mind 
    finally  reflected on this and must've sent out the standard  question: 
    why? 
    
      "Because you have been told never to talk about us." 
    
      This  statement  shocked me.  I  didn't know what he,  or  they,   or 
    whoever, was talking about. I hadn't talked about them. 
    
      "You were told you could write about us."  Now I really felt panicked 
    but I also felt a strange feeling of relief.  I  stopped all efforts at 
    praying  for help and though I knew it was illogical,  I  felt my  body 
    relaxing. So much, I managed to say something. I  asked the creature if 
    he meant we had met before and he told me yes, many times. 
    
      When, why, how? 
    
      I felt I didn't believe him but again the normal reflexes, the desire 
    to  run,  to get away,  remained out of my reach even when they told me 
    that  they couldn't tell me why or how.  At this point,  however,  they 
    proceeded to show me when. 
    
      That is when I discovered the mirror wasn't a mirror because it sorta 
    devolved  and I looked at an image from my distant past.  I  saw myself 
    walking  along  a  dirt road that ran along side a  wide  creek  and  I 
    instantly recognized the place.  I was roughly two miles above a dam on 
    Cache  creek.  And,  though I had been there many times,   I   couldn't 
    remember this incident. 
    
      Normally  when  I went there,  I  went there to fish but when  I  saw 
    myself  I  wasn't carrying a fishing pole.  When the  image  pulled  in 
    enough  for  me  to see myself better I noticed my nose  was  bleeding. 
    Seeing  this,   pained  me and the being by my side must  have  noticed 
    because  he  assured me everything was okay and that  soon,   I   would 
    understand. 
    
      It  lied.  I  didn't understand and it wasn't until months later  the 
    significance of the even surfaced. 
    
      I  must have still been questioning things because the voice told  me 
    to  pay  attention  to the screen.  That they would prove  we  had  met 
    before. 
    
      The image changed and this time when I saw myself I was inside a room 
    that had curving walls.  I  lay on a low table. I  was also naked and I 
    could see other beings touching me.  One creature was holding a strange 
    device and sticking it in my left leg. Oddly, watching the event didn't 
    bother  me.  My emotions,  like my body,  seemed paralyzed.   When  the 
    creature  finished what he was doing I saw three small holes on my leg. 
    Surprisingly, there wasn't any blood. 
    
      At  this point the creature told me they could prove I had been  with 
    them  before  and he proceeded to do just that when he said,  "Look  at 
    your leg, Jack." 
    
      Since  I  felt paralyzed I didn't think I could but right  after  the 
    command  came  I  discovered I could move.  Sure  enough,   though  the 
    indentions were not as obvious now I was able to see the three holes in 
    the exact place the image on the wall showed them. 
    
      I  must have asked the same questions I did before because they  told 
    me this too, would eventually return to my memory. 
    
      After that I don't know what happened. I got the impression they were 
    going  to tell me something but instead I seemed to have gone  back  to 
    sleep or blacked out and I woke up back in my bed. 
    
      Since it was almost one in the afternoon I wondered if I had I merely 
    dreamed it? 
    
      I  didn't  think  so because when I closed my  eyes  the  ugly  faces 
    appeared in my mind.  Often,  during the next three weeks,  I  even saw 
    those black eyes staring at me with my eyes open. 
    
      I also quit writing.  The novel I had started, I tore to shreds and I 
    even  seriously  thought of destroying all the stories I  had  written. 
    Oddly,  I couldn't and a few months later the being I called Ya,  again 
    spoke into my mind. Her question, startled me. "Do you believe now?" 
    
      I didn't want to respond. I didn't want to believe. If I did, I would 
    have to believe that what my mind was and had been telling me since the 
    ordeal,   was  true.   That whom I called the Greys,   were  right  and 
    everything I experienced,  my out of body experiences, my stories,  all 
    concerned them.  Worse yet, it confirmed that what John Lear said,  was 
    true. 
    
      "No,   Kontor."  Ya said,  using the name they pinned on me during my 
    first experience.  "That isn't the way it is.  What you are writing  is 
    true.  So is what you recently experienced. Don't worry,  it will never 
    happen again." 
     
      Since that time a few of the Greys predictions have come true. I have 
    remembered  the incident involving my bleeding nose and though  I  have 
    never yet been able to recall anything about my previous abductions,  I 
    do remember how I got the scars on my leg. 
    
      But I also know that what my mind remembers about the scars,  are not 
    true.  The way I remember it I used to play cowboys and indians with  a 
    friend  of mine.  I  always played the part of the cowboy and he always 
    played  the  indian.  And,  as it was in some real life episodes,   the 
    indian always won the battles. Now, this in itself doesn't seem strange 
    and  it  doesn't explain the scars.  That's the funny part.   While  we 
    played our games it seems like we liked to play realistically. I used a 
    Daisy,  BB pistol and John, my friend, used darts.  As I said,  this is 
    only what my mind tells me about the scars on my leg.  What it  doesn't 
    explain  is  how I could be so stupid to play such a game nor  why  the 
    wounds never got infected. 
    
      My bleeding nose isn't as clear but I do remember refusing to go  see 
    a  doctor  when I got home.  I  told my mother I must have done  it  to 
    myself by picking my nose. Thankfully, [I guess] she believed me. Had I 
    seen  a  doctor  I  feel certain he  would  have  discovered  I  hadn't 
    inflicted the damage.  I  felt certain that even back in the 1950's the 
    doctor  would  have  been able to determine that  something  a  foreign 
    object entered my head through my nasal passage. 
     
      Well, gang, that is my story. Could it have happened?
