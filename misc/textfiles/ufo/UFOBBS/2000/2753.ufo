SUBJECT: THE PHOENIX FOUNDATION                              FILE: UFO2753





    
    Welcome to the Phoenix Foundation 
    
      Many  of  you have probably at one time or another watched  MacGyver, 
    the popular TV series (no longer in production) about the guy who works 
    for the Phoenix Foundation. 
    
      There is a real Phoenix Foundation,  incorporated in 1981.  I've been 
    told  by a reliable source (who has been an actor on the series)   that 
    the show was inspired by a copy of a newsletter, The Omega Report, that 
    is produced by the real Phoenix Foundation. 
    
      The television show paralleled many of our real-world projects: UFOs, 
    power lines, espionage and politics. 
    
      I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about  the 
    Phoenix Foundation and invite you to join as a member.  We will also be 
    uploading  the texts of our newsletter,  The Omega Report,  to  various 
    CompuServe Libraries. 
    
      We are, to my knowledge, the only non-profit institute in America (at 
    least)  that is dedicated to the study of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) 
    energy.  ELF affects every one of us every day.  Our brains operate  on 
    the ELF frequency band (0-3000 hertz). So do the brains of every living 
    creature  on  earth.   Even  the  earth itself  oscillates  at  an  ELF 
    frequency. 
    
      I have testified in federal court as an expert witness on power  line 
    radiation.  If any of you are concerned about high-voltage power  lines 
    or substations near your home or office,  or about their  environmental 
    effects, you definitely need to know more about the Phoenix Foundation. 
    
      We  have received calls and letters from around the country  on  this 
    growing  problem (which a secret utility memo compares to the  asbestos 
    crisis),   and  we  would  like to form  an  international  network  of 
    citizens,   organizations and researchers interested in identifying the 
    risks  and  the  causes,  and in finding solutions that  are  fair  and 
    equitable to all,  including the utilities. In fact, we invite electric 
    utility participation. 
    
      The  story  of  the  Phoenix Foundation goes  back  beyond  1981.   I 
    personally  carried out a lot of the research since 1961,  and  founded 
    the  Phoenix  Foundation  as a formal organization to  further  my  own 
    personal research. 
    
      The  Phoenix Foundation - just like MacGyver indicates - is  involved 
    in    many   things:    weapons   research,    paraphysics    research, 
    extraterrestrial  research,  biophysics,  psychotronics,   electronics, 
    agriculture,    journalism,    AIDS  research,   conflict   resolution, 
    spiritual/scientific   research,   environmental   protection,    space 
    research, and political history. 
    
      I was the author, in 1975, of "A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone Files", 
    available  on  CompuServe  and must reading for  anyone  who  wants  to 
    understand  how  and why our society has deteriorated to the  point  it 
    has.  The story BEHIND the Gemstone story is one of the most incredible 
    you will ever come across, and it can be thoroughly documented. As time 
    and  finances  permit,  we will begin uploading thousands of  pages  of 
    documentation  to substantiate the claims made in the  Gemstone  Files. 
    These  files  were the reason behind the famous  Watergate  burglaries. 
    Richard  Nixon wanted to find out just how much we knew and who we  had 
    shared this information with. 
    
      We  (I)   have  investigated the assassinations of  John  and  Robert 
    Kennedy  since they happened.  We hope to upload a series of  exclusive 
    articles  I wrote for a national magazine in the 1970s that carries the 
    JFK story farther than Oliver Stone ever dreamed.  This information was 
    made  available,   upon  request,  to the Senate  Select  Committee  on 
    Assassinations.  It links Watergate to Dallas. This story also involves 
    mind control - something virtually unknown by the public that is  again 
    interested in what happened November 22, 1963. 
    
      I  have  personally spent months in jail in Tennessee for  trying  to 
    bring  this  information  to  the public.  My crime  was  publishing  a 
    newspaper on Sunday.  (More about this in future uploads).  My home and 
    office  were ransacked by sheriff's deputies,  the CIA and the Ku  Klux 
    Klan,   working together.  I  was virtually imprisoned as  a  political 
    prisoner right here in America. 
    
      I  have  been urged over the years by hundreds of people to  tell  my 
    story,   but  that  has been very difficult to do.  It has cost  me  my 
    employability except in the most menial jobs.  It cost me my family and 
    all  that  I owned (you can't pay your bills when you're behind  bars). 
    Perhaps  now  is the right time,  as America faces the  most  dangerous 
    period in her history. And perhaps CompuServe is the right forum, for I 
    can  ill  afford the cost of printing the thousands of  newsletters  or 
    magazines it would take to get this story out to the American people. 
    
      Unless  we are halted in our efforts,  we will begin uploading to you 
    the story behind Watergate and Iran-Contra,  the real story about AIDS, 
    and much more. I've been there, in a unique position to witness history 
    in the making. 
    
      In 1961,  at the age of 16, I  was building spy satellites.  (This is 
    documented in an accompanying upload - see OBSAT.TXT) Little did I know 
    then  how a science fair project would so dramatically alter my   life. 
    It  was in 1961,  in a tour of Boeing Aircraft-Wichita,  that  I  first 
    discovered that the United States had recovered a crashed aircraft from 
    an extraterrestrial civilization and had bodies in deep freeze. 
    
      In  1963,  I  was involved in tornado research at the  University  of 
    Kansas, using the super-secret U-2 spy plane. 
    
      By 1964, I was working with the Cuban Student Directorate (Des Moines 
    branch),   a  CIA-funded group of Cuban exiles involved in  clandestine 
    raids into Cuba to destroy sugar mills in an attempt to overthrow Fidel 
    Castro.  It was years before I learned that I had actually been working 
    for  the  CIA  and  that this group  had  been  involved  in  Kennedy's 
    assassination. 
    
      By 1966,  I  was a reporter for a daily newspaper (Pratt (KS)   Daily 
    Tribune).   At 19  I  was the youngest departmental editor of  a  daily 
    newspaper anywhere in the US or Canada. 
    
      Two  years  later  I was in Chicago,   working  as  an  investigative 
    reporter  and  national  columnist  for  National  Features  Syndicate, 
    investigating the Kennedy assassination and working with a staff member 
    from  the office of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison.  It was there  that  I 
    stumbled  across  the  story  of  how  the  US  was  using  "behavioral 
    modification"   (we know it as "mind control")  to monitor and  control 
    assassins such as Sirhan Sirhan and Jack Ruby. 
    
      While  there  I was savagely beaten by the Mafia - a warning  to  lay 
    off.   I   didn't lay off.  I  uncovered a  Mafia-operated  counterfeit 
    operation  that was manufacturing "Longines-Wittnaur"  watches  by  the 
    tens  of thousands,  undermining the legitimate company.  By the time I 
    realized what I was involved in, it was too late. The Chicago Mob's hit 
    men made their move. One helluva story there! 
    
      That  same  year I was working (briefly)  as a volunteer  for  Robert 
    Kennedy's presidential campaign. Then he was murdered. Within weeks,  I 
    was  Illinois State Chairman of Senator Eugene McCarthy's  presidential 
    campaign (not to be confused with rabid anti-  Communist Joe McCarthy). 
    I took on the Daley political machine in a courtcase that went all  the 
    way to the U.S. Supreme Court (I won). 
    
      That  case  has  been used as precedent  by  independent  presidential 
    candidates ever since - both conservative and liberal. The story of how 
    both  George  Wallace and Richard Nixon campaigns tried to fund  us  to 
    destroy  the Democratic Party is worth telling,  as is the story of how 
    the  movement  was  infiltrated and taken over  by  explosive  SDS  and 
    Weathermen radicals who wanted to dynamite the polling booths. How many 
    of these were federal "agents de provacateur"  I'll never know,  but  I 
    publicly  quit  in disgust and outrage.  Violence is not  at  all  what 
    democracy is supposed to be about. 
    
      In 1969,  with a Mafia contract out on me,  I  fled to Tennessee  and 
    started publishing a small weekly newspaper in 1971  that landed me  in 
    even more hot water.  I  discovered small towns are more dangerous than 
    the  cities.  They can keep a better eye on you,  and destroy you  much 
    more effectively. 
    
      My  children were shot at as they played in the front yard.   Friends 
    were offered money to put me in the hospital and shut me up.  A  deputy 
    sheriff was murdered one night when he tried to bring me a story he had 
    written  about  how corrupt the sheriff's department  was,   running  a 
    burglary  ring that covered several counties,  and dealing drugs.  When 
    all that failed, I  was arrested and jailed for three months for having 
    my  newspaper  office  open on Sunday.  (That story  made  the  papers, 
    television and even Editor & Publisher magazine). 
    
      When I got out of jail in 1975, I started writing my Modern People, a 
    Chicago  news  weekly (not to be confused with  People  Magazine).   My 
    assignment:   solve the Kennedy assassination.  My undercover work  for 
    Texas Senator Henry Gonzalez (who spearheaded the renewed JFK probe and 
    who later became committee chairman,  only to quit after he himself was 
    the target of a Mafia contract)  brought me even more problems after  I 
    revealed it was Watergate burglar E.  Howard Hunt who was in charge  of 
    the secret CIA photo team across the street from the Cuban consulate in 
    Mexico  City.  That team produced the photos of Lee Harvey Oswald  that 
    were not Oswald at all, but a CIA assassin. When it became obvious that 
    the  Senate Committee had been infiltrated by the very people  covering 
    up the assassination truth, both I and Gonzalez quit. 
    
      In April 1975,  I completed "A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone Files"  - 
    which  is  available for download on CompuServe.  In May  my  home  was 
    broken  into  and  a copy of the manuscript  was  stolen,   then  later 
    published in the City of San Francisco Magazine. 
    
      The Williamson  County  Sheriff's Department placed  me  under  heavy 
    surveillance.  My neighbor, a redneck if there ever was one, was making 
    lists  of the license numbers of every car that visited my house,   and 
    turning  them over to the sheriff.  I  was told by the Fairview  police 
    chief  (a friend)  that "something is going on"  and that it was out of 
    his jurisdiction.  He had been told not to intervene.  In exchange  for 
    his "help", my neighbor was given carte blanche to go through the house 
    of my other neighbor,  who had died,  and take whatever he wanted.  The 
    dead man's house sat vacant for months. 
    
      Not  too  long after that,  Hustler magazine  publisher  Larry  Flynt 
    (yeah,  I  know, he's a drugged out sleazeball), offered me $1  million 
    for what I had on the JFK murder.  I  sent him the Gemstone Files.  Two 
    days  after  I  discussed the story with his staff he  was  permanently 
    crippled  by  a  would-be assassin.  The story was rejected -  then  in 
    February 1979,  Hustler published it - without paying for it - and even 
    misspelled the same words I had deliberately misspelled as protection. 
    
      I  went to Charles Galbreath,  former Tennessee Appellate Court Judge 
    and a friend of Flynt's. I wanted to know what was going on.  Galbreath 
    wanted  to  sue.  The story got even stranger at that  point.   Hustler 
    admitted they had receiced the story from me and offered a $2,000  out-
    of-court settlement, which I rejected. (Maybe, in retrospect, I  should 
    have accepted it). 
    
      Suddenly,   Galbreath  backed  off,   after saying  Flynt  was  being 
    controlled by sinister powers. 
    
      At  the same time this was going on,  I  was helping Richard Fann,  a 
    former  cop,  in his campaign for the Fairview City Commission,  and  I 
    began publishing the Gemstone Files. 
    
      Within days,  I  was again arrested - on drug charges.  I  personally 
    watched  from  a creek (where I bathed)  as Williamson County  deputies 
    placed  marijuana  plants  on  my front porch  -  my  front  porch  for 
    Chrissake. I heard one deputy say "I want the first shot at him." I hid 
    in the woods until dark,  then tried to get away,  but they had  stolen 
    the  keys to my car.  I  walked on foot for miles to a friend's  house. 
    They nabbed me there.  I was jailed,  even though Judge Ann Franks told 
    them  to release me on my own recognizance.  Sheriff  Fleming  Williams 
    told the judge I had been released,  when in fact,  I had not,  and was 
    being  held incommunicado in the Williamson County Jail in Franklin.  I 
    was alone in the world like I had never been alone before. 
    
      My landlady went to my house to discover "men in suits" going through 
    my files. She was told "if you want to keeep your family alive,  you'll 
    get  your  butt  back up the hill and forget you  saw  anything."   She 
    didn't,   but instead went to the sheriff's department,  where she  was 
    ignored. I wonder why. Years later, I  found out who at least one these 
    men were - the Tennessee Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. 
    
      I  was told I would never leave jail alive.  They brought a humongous 
    deputy in (he must have weighed 400 pounds) and told me I would be shot 
    in the head trying to escape. They were going to take me for a ride. It 
    wouldn't  be  the first time this had happened  in  Williamson  County. 
    Earlier an inmate,  handcuffed behind his back, was shot in the back of 
    the head and killed when he "tried to escape." 
    
      I smuggled a letter out to the County Judge,  Wilburn Kelley,  whom I 
    had  helped in his election.  I  also led a work strike by the  inmates 
    when  the deputies were stealing our food and taking it home,  starving 
    us  out.  The letter was broadcast on the radio and Kelley visited  the 
    jail; things improved for awhile. 
    
      I am alive today probably only by the grace of God and the compassion 
    of  the Fairview police chief.  I  was taken to Fairview City Court  to 
    face "check forgery" charges. I had signed my wife's name on a $5 check 
    for  gas  (she  was at work and the gas tank was  empty).   She  didn't 
    intiate  any proceedings.  The bank saw the signature was different and 
    the  sheriff jumped at the possible charges.  He flew into a rage  when 
    the  judge  refused  to  force my wife to testify and  the  grand  jury 
    refused  to  indict me.  He swore he would take it over their heads  to 
    insure I was put away for good. 
    
      The  local  charges were dismissed and when  the  sheriff's  deputies 
    didn't show up to take me back to jail to face the "drug"  charges, the 
    local  police chief looked at me and said,  "I'm not going to do  their 
    dirty work for them.  I don't care where the hell you go,  just get out 
    of here."  I fled to Nashville and stayed with a friend until my county 
    court date.  When I showed up, they tried to arrest me for escape,  but 
    Judge  Franks  said enough is enough.  Stop right there.  I  was  found 
    guilty,   though,  on the marijuana charge.  I  didn't stand  a  chance 
    against that. Sentence: time served. 
    
      As  for Richard Fann,  the cop running for office,  he won with  more 
    votes  than anyone had ever received in Fairview history,   and  became 
    mayor. 
    
      My own life in shambles,  I went to Nashville and waited tables while 
    I  pursued  the  court case against Hustler,  on my  own,   without  an 
    attorney. I was doing alright, winning every motion, until a new lawyer 
    appeared  on the scene to volunteer his help.  He suggested I  withdraw 
    the  case from federal court and file it in state court,  where a  jury 
    would be more hostile to Flynt's values.  Worst advice I ever took. Two 
    days later the lawyer vanished.  I went to his house.  It was bare.  To 
    this  day I have no idea whatever happened to him.  Was he a  plant  to 
    sabotage the case? I don't know. 
    
      The  Gemstone Files was widely published - but heavily censored - and 
    was  made  into a movie and a book by a CIA front  corporation.   Their 
    objective  was to present it as fiction,  so people would  never  again 
    regard  it for what it was - FACT.  The corporation that  published  it 
    was,  in fact, a CIA proprietary airline like Air America. It was their 
    only venture into publishing.  One of their agents tried to take credit 
    for the work. 
    
      At  this  point,  I  guess any person in their right mind would  have 
    quit, just given up and said to hell with it. But then I guess I didn't 
    fit that description. I did tone it down (I had a family to support). I 
    held several nondescript jobs:  typesetter,  warehouse manager,  retail 
    store manager). 
    
      In 1980, I served as Davidson County Co-Chairman of the John Anderson 
    presidential campaign. The campaign was infiltrated by Republican dirty 
    tricksters.   When  Anderson's  daughter came to town,   one  of  those 
    tricksters,  who was posing as a doctor, was assigned as her driver. He 
    eluded  the Secret Service and drove Eleanora around trying to get  her 
    to do drugs.  The Secret Service was in a panic when they couldn't find 
    her.   I   can imagine what kind of front-page scandal that would  have 
    made. This is the first time anywhere that incident has been revealed. 
    
      It  was  during  this same year that the Iran-Contra  scandal  began. 
    Reagan's  people approached Anderson with information that  Carter  was 
    involved  in  some  secret arms deal for the  hostages.   It  was  pure 
    bullshit! More dirt tricks. 
    
      In  1981,   I   founded the Phoenix Foundation and set up  The  Omega 
    Report,   a   computer-run bulletin board service.  When I  once  again 
    started  publishing  the Gemstone Files,  I  was visited at work by  an 
    individual  who worked (and still does)  at a top-secret communications 
    facility just across the street from where I lived. 
    
      This  communications  facility  is  on  a  hill  that  gives  it   an 
    unobstructed  view  of  Nashville.  It  has  high-powered  surveillance 
    cameras on the tower. In fact, at a public meeting in front of some 500 
    people,  I  asked the head of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency 
    about  those cameras.  He bragged they could read license plates  at  a 
    shopping  center  several miles away.  My next action was a  letter  to 
    Mayor (and former Congressman)  Richard Fulton asking why these cameras 
    were  pointing into people's bedrooms (including my own)  and on  whose 
    authority.   I   would go out in the yard and the cameras  would  move, 
    following my direction. 
    
      The  individual who showed up at work told me there was a thick  file 
    on  me making the rounds of the facility and that I had better be  very 
    careful.  I  had pissed off some powerful people.  I  won't reveal this 
    person's name because I still have contact with him and do not want  to 
    jeopardize  his  job.  But he told me some of what was in  the  file  - 
    enough private details that I knew he was telling the truth. 
    
      As  Iran-Contra unraveled,  the Foundation published a special  Omega 
    Report  (still available in limited quantities).  We were the first  to 
    reveal the Reagan deal to delay release of the hostages. I called it as 
    I  saw it - treason.  We reported the concentration camps set up in ten 
    states  as part of Operation Rex 1984.  These camps were built to  hold 
    400,000   people - American citizens - who did not agree with  Reagan's 
    Nicaraguan militarism.  I  sent a copy to every member of Congress  (it 
    cost me a bundle!) 
    
      I've  been told that as ABC-News panned the Iran-Contra hearing  room 
    during breaks,  copies of the report were seen on the desks of  several 
    Congressional staffers.  I can't verify that.  We intend to upload that 
    report to CompuServe. You need to know what's going on! 
    
      We  were  the  first to predict the Berlin Wall would fall -  a  year 
    before it happened.  Using computer technology to analyze European news 
    events, we beat the CIA and the White House on that one! 
    
      We've  produced a lot of material on the phony "War on Drugs."   This 
    so-called war is a hoax. Uncle Sam is America's biggest dope dealer and 
    the  "war"   is simply an excuse to destroy the Bill of  Rights.   It's 
    working, too. (More to come on this). 
    
      We've  produced  a  lot  of  material on the  use  of  Extremely  Low 
    Frequency (ELF) radiation for mind control. We've obtained, through the 
    Freedom  of Information Act,  CIA and DIA documents that prove it.   We 
    are,   according to a CIA document submitted to the Warren  Commission, 
    being  programmed "in a manner consonant with national plans"  (Richard 
    Helms) in "the battle for the minds of men." 
    
      The  DIA document tells how,  in 1976,  the military was  using  mind 
    control  technology  as  a "barrier weapon"  to  literally  change  the 
    enemy's mind - creating temporary and permanent brain damage,  inducing 
    hypnosis and "voices in the head." 
    
      We  used  it  in Panama against Noriega and in  Iraq  against  Saddam 
    Hussein.  And in America against U.S.  citizens.  We suspect there is a 
    link between this and high-voltage power lines,  as outlined in the DIA 
    document.  The nation's electrical system and plumbing grid can be used 
    as  a powerful ELF brain-wave transmitter to condition the  population. 
    Even  the judge in the Judas Priest "subliminal control"  trial cited a 
    litany of how the CIA has attempted to use it "to alter the outcome  of 
    national elections." 
    
      Remember that as you vote in November. 
    
      Another area we've been involved in - stemming from my 1961  trip  to 
    Boeing - is extraterrestrial contact.  There are a lot of paranoid nuts 
    out  there  with  some  wild  stories,  but there  is  also  a  lot  of 
    frightening  truth to what is being circulated.  Our newsletters  cover 
    some of this. 
    
      My background is journalism,  engineering.  I  seek facts.   Provable 
    facts.   And  I  try to pass it on to you.  We also  present  differing 
    opinions  -  since  my  role  is not that of a  censor,   but  that  of 
    historian. Judge for yourself what may be real and what isn't. 
    
      Our involvement in high-voltage power lines has brought back the ugly 
    surveillance  and smear tactics of the powers that be.  Two years  ago, 
    when  a local utility company tried to place a high-voltage power  line 
    in  an  affluent Nashville neighborhood,  people were upset  about  the 
    aesthetics.   We pointed out that there was much more to  be  concerned 
    about - birth defects, brain cancer, etc. 
    
      We  were invited to speak to Brentwood homeowners - where a  175,000-
    volt line runs only 20 feet from children's swingsets. But a power line 
    "volunteer"   from Murfreesboro began writing letters and making  phone 
    calls accusing me of being a convicted felon,  a child molester, a  CIA 
    agent and a communist,  and warning people to stay away from me and the 
    Phoenix Foundation. I saw one such letter in court. 
    
      After $70,000  in legal fees (not my money),  we gave up on the case, 
    even though I think we had a chance of winning it. 
    
      Undaunted,  I  set up the Global Village BBS in Nashville - America's 
    first community electronic newspaper and electronic town hall, with the 
    participation  of  the Democrat and Republican parties,   city  council 
    members, state legislators, the governor and Congressmen. 
    
      Within 30  days,  I  was again under attack.  The State of  Tennessee 
    demands to do a "routine"  audit of every document,  every bill,  every 
    receipt, every check since 1988 - even though I've paid all state taxes 
    I've been told to pay. This audit is set to come up September 22. 
    
      That's where things stand now.  I couldn't find a job anywhere. I  am 
    unemployable.  Employers who have had government contracts were told to 
    choose  between me and their contracts.  My last employer told me I was 
    one step away from being "hit", according to a private investigation. 
    
      This is what America has come to. This is the price you can expect to 
    pay for patriotism.  I want to tell you - and those who may be watching 
    me - what patriotism is all about. It isn't relaxing in your easy chair 
    with  a  six-pack of Budweiser and Monday Night Football and  accepting 
    every  piece  of crap fed to you on the news.  It's about  loving  your 
    country  and  your  people enough to take the necessary risks  to  make 
    America the nation she should be, the nation she deserves to be. 
    
      Let's  not  forget that people still risk their lives to make  it  to 
    America's shores.  We are the best hope for freedom and democracy  this 
    world  has ever known.  I  just want America to be the best she can be. 
    THAT is my patriotism. 
    
      We've  strayed from the spiritual values upon which we grew over  the 
    past two hundred years.  If we lose that,  we lose it all.  And I'm not 
    talking born-again, conservative fundamentalist Christian soldiers. I'm 
    talking  God - in whatever form we know Him/Her.   Murder,   blackmail, 
    assassination - that has no place in my America. 
    
      Someone  once said,  "If you have nothing worth dying for,  you  have 
    nothing worth living for." 
    
      Dante wrote,  in The Inferno, "The lowest depths of hell are reserved 
    for  those  who  in  a  time  of  great  moral  crisis  maintain  their 
    neutrality." 
    
      One  of  Robert Kennedy's favorite sayings (and the one Ethel put  on 
    his funeral invitation) was:  "Some see things as they are and ask why. 
    Others see things as they could be, and ask why not." 
    
      The short-lived campaign of Ross Perot illustrated how hungry we  are 
    for the America we want. 
    
      This isn't political.  It isn't Republican or Democrat. It isn't even 
    just "America". The handwriting is on the wall for this New World Order 
    (Brave New World?) we face. 
    
      I invite you to join me - while you still can. The Phoenix Foundation 
    needs people like you who give a damn!  I,  personally,  have something 
    worth dying for.  I  just hope it doesn't come to that,  but I know  my 
    name  -  like many of yours - is on that list for  those  concentration 
    camps. I believe God will watch over me until such time as He/She calls 
    me home.  Until then, I  can only continue to do what I can do to prove 
    that  one person can make a difference.  You are one person.  And  you, 
    too,  can make a difference.  Please join the Phoenix Foundation.  Your 
    support will never go for anything more worthwhile.  or more needed  in 
    these times.

    upload as much documentation as we can before we are silenced.
