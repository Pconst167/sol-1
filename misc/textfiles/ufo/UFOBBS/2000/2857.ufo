 ----- UFO RELEASE: TEN TIMES O.J.? -----

One statement made by Glenn Campbell on the Larry King "Live from 
Area 51" special on Oct. 1 seems to have upset a lot of UFO buffs 
(confirming to some that Campbell must be a government agent).

Here is a transcript of the last few minutes of the two-hour show, 
pretty much summing up the position of each guest.

LARRY KING:  "Glenn, do you think they'll come to Washington and 
say 'Hello'?"

GLENN CAMPBELL:  "I have the feeling, personal[ly], that they 
probably obey the Prime Directive--That's from Star Trek.--that 
they should leave us alone and let us conduct our own lives.  They 
seem to not want a lot of attention."

DR. STEVEN GREER:  "Let me say, though, that I do think that 
within the decade that it is likely that an undeniable event will 
transpire.  There [is] the proliferation of video cameras and 
other technologies such that some of the events that have happened 
in the past decades, if they were to happen now in 1994, there is 
a higher and higher chance that this would result in undeniable 
evidence."

KING:  "Are you encouraged that this administration would help?"

DR. GREER:  "Yes."

KING:  "Therefore you think that President Clinton does not now 
know what you may know."

DR. GREER:  "I really shouldn't comment on that."

[Awkward pause.]

STANTON FRIEDMAN:  "That's a mysterious comment."

DR. GREER:  "What I think is that the current administration, the 
cabinet level people are probably not informed to the level that 
they should be.  And to the extent that they have been informed, 
it is probably disinformation not information."

KING: "Kevin, optimistic or pessimistic?"

KEVIN RANDLE:  "Looking at the history of the government, I'm 
fairly pessimistic.  I think it will take some kind of outside 
event to make us learn what is really going on."

KING: "Glenn?"

CAMPBELL: "I'm neither optimistic or pessimistic.  If the story 
hits, it will cause a big stir in the media for a while, but we'll 
go back to our regular lives."

KING: "Just for a while?  Come on.  Hard Copy would be there 
tomorrow morning up in Pluto."

CAMPBELL:  "Picture the O.J. Simpson brouhaha and multiply that by 
ten, and maybe you might have the UFO thing."

KING:  "Sex in space."

DR. GREER:  "I think it will be bigger than that, and I think that 
what you'll see is a transformation in the way we look at 
ourselves as a people.  People will evolve into a global society 
instead of national ones."

KING:  "Are you optimistic?"

DR. GREER:  "Yes, I'm very optimistic in fact."

KING:  "And you, Stanton?"

FRIEDMAN:  "I'm optimistic.  I am concerned that the American 
people are nowhere near aware enough of how much stuff is being 
covered up as we speak--the huge black budgets, all the documents, 
that scares me."

KING:  "Thank you all very much for being a terrific panel and for 
participating on this show that started in daylight and ended in 
darkness.  [...]  We also want to thank everyone associated in 
this wonderful little spot on this treasured earth called Rachel, 
Nevada, for their wonderful cooperation, and this great crew as 
well, our producers and the entire staff.  Thanks for joining us; 
have a great time and.... [looking heavenward] bye.


Through the pulling of strings, Psychospy had obtained a pass to 
the Larry King set, erected in the desert across the street from 
the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel.  We lurked in the shadows during 
the rehearsal and show, monitoring the radio traffic of the 
control room and camera operators.  There were a half-dozen 
cameras:  A camera on a moving dolly, a camera on a 20 foot boom, 
a camera behind Larry, three cameras facing the stage, and a 
camera on a hilltop a half-mile away.  From the outside, it looked 
like a graceful ballet of cameras dancing hither and yon, but we 
pitied the guests:  You couldn't pick your nose without the world 
watching.

Anyway, upon return to our Research Center, we found some forty 
messages on our answering machine, and the phone continued to ring 
all night.  Most of the callers were very angry and said: "I've 
tried the 800 number and can't get through.  Why won't you people 
take my call?  I've got important information about the government 
cover-up that must get on the air."

One message on our machine came from a Lieutenant Colonel at Fort 
Dix Air Force Base in New Jersey asking us to return his call.  We 
didn't bother, since we knew Fort Dix was an Army base.

The next most common kind of call were anonymous voices accusing 
Campbell of being a government agent.  These were deep breathers 
mostly, who left epithets and cryptic threats on the tape and then 
hung up.  The most coherent were similar to the email message 
quoted in DR #18:

   "The show is off the air 10 minutes and I am left with the 
feeling that Glenn Campbell works for the government.  I have no 
evidence to that fact, I am new to this whole line of information, 
but Mr. Campbell in my opinion seemed to soft-peddle the entire 
affair in a much too uncomfortable way for me to give him any 
credibility."

Other messages, faxed or mailed to us from supporters and 
detractors alike, seemed to focus on Campbell's "O.J." comments.  
"Only ten times O.J.?" they said.  We're talking about the BIGGEST 
NEWS EVENT IN HISTORY.  If the government releases info about 
UFOs, it could SHATTER OUR INSTITUTIONS.  World religions will 
CRUMBLE--or, alternatively, church attendance will skyrocket as 
humanity tries to come to grips with the fact that IT IS NO LONGER 
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.  World financial markets will fall 
into VIOLENT TURMOIL and may even COLLAPSE when investors realize 
that alien technology instantly makes ours obsolete.  There will 
be RIOTS AND LOOTING in the streets as humans see the 
meaninglessness of our earthly laws.  Millions of people will 
COMMIT SUICIDE, while others will refuse to go to work when they 
realize just how small and meaningless their lives really are in 
scheme of the universe.

Other correspondents sent us la-dee-da predictions, not unlike Dr. 
Greer's, suggesting that knowledge of the alien presence would 
draw all of humanity together into one loving, cooperative entity 
singing "Kumbaya."

"Balderdash!" we reply.  We may disagree with Campbell from time 
to time, and we are not ready to announce that any aliens actually 
exist, but we think his nonchalance, at least on a philosophical 
level, deserves our defense.

 ..... THE REAL EFFECT .....

Human history has always been filled with major disruptions and 
uncertainty, and still we have bounced back to at least an 
adequate level of functioning.  Any alien presence or agenda, no 
matter how sinister, must pale in comparison to the truly evil 
things that humanity had afflicted upon itself over the centuries.  
Take the Second World War, or any war for that matter:  How could 
the aliens, who seem clinical and disinterested at best, possibly 
cause as much disruption to society as people systematically 
blowing each other's heads off?

Most people's lives are irrational and meaningless enough anyway 
that it is hard to imagine that any release of information will 
push them over the brink.  Some people, already unstable, may 
indeed commit suicide, just like during every big snowstorm a few 
precarious senior citizens pass away; the notion of them jumping 
off cliffs like lemmings is ridiculous.  Humans are creatures of 
habit and convention.  They will continue to do what they are 
doing now unless they are physically prevented from it.  All the 
profound philosophical and technological implications of alien 
life would be absorbed only over time, at the rate that 
individuals and society are prepared to change.

Religions seem like the least likely institutions to be affected.  
Religious beliefs are based on faith and often fly in the face of 
reason anyway, so no amount of data is likely to change them.  We 
can expect only a temporary instability as leaders of the major 
faiths race around to find the alien references in their 
scriptures to prove that they had the idea first.  (We'd place our 
money on the adaptive and media savvy Mormons to easily win this 
P.R. race.)

The aliens have been variously described as centuries or even 
millennia ahead of us in technology.  As such, we can't expect 
that much of their gadgetry will be immediately useful or 
reproducible by us.  It is like giving a transistor radio to a 
cannibal on a remote desert island.  First of all, he's got no 
stations to listen to.  If he is very clever, he might be able to 
figure out how the radio works, but he certainly doesn't have the 
ability to reproduce it with the tools or materials at hand.  In 
all, the technology is so advanced as to be almost meaningless to 
the cannibal, who would much prefer a new spear or juicy 
missionary.

Thus, the earthly economy and financial markets would probably 
remain stable for many years.  People will still need to feed, 
clothe and house themselves in the traditional manner.  Alien 
technology will not immediately bring down the price of the 
Pentium chip or obviate the human need for air travel to sunny but 
meaningless tourist destinations.  Money will retain its perceived 
value, and Las Vegas, like other religious sites, will continue to 
prosper as a place for people to trade their money for the slim 
hope of salvation.

The only guaranteed effect of any alien revelations would be an 
increase in television viewership.  Television is our society's 
guiding light in any time of crisis or change.  People will want 
to know what Dan Rather and Peter Jennings have to say about the 
aliens, although they will probably produce only the obvious 
platitudes:  Yes, they could blow us out of the solar system if 
they wanted, but they haven't done it yet, so they probably aren't 
a major threat.  Dan and Peter will only be killing time before 
cutting to Washington for the long-awaited Big Announcement by the 
President of the United States.  Of course, by the time the 
President announces something, you know it will be old news, 
having already circulated on the tube for some time.  Still, the 
people need a leadership figure to offer them the same platitudes 
as Rather and Jennings, but with the strength and authority of the 
Man in Charge.  The President's popularity rating will soar that 
night as people cling to their leader, although it will probably 
fall again to its original level before the next election.

 ..... UFOLOGICAL CONFLICT .....

Most ufologists seem to be basically schizoid about the release of 
UFO information.  On the one hand, they say that the government 
MUST tell what it knows and that the people have a fundamental 
right to the data.  On the other, they say the news will probably 
send society spiraling into anarchy, destroy our economy, religion 
and government and drive people to mass suicide.  That is not the 
message to send to encourage the government to comply.

What we are talking about is only information, no more dangerous 
or destructive than how we choose to interpret it.  If prominent 
UFO researchers run through the streets yelling, "It's the end of 
our society!" naturally the rest of the populous is going to 
become upset at any mention of aliens, and the government will be 
all the more reluctant to release any info.  The duty of 
responsible ufologists is to help prepare society for the Big News 
by issuing only calm, reasonable statements and speaking about UFO 
information as though it were routine. 

Noisy outrage at the government doesn't advance the movement any.  
Ufologists say:  The government MUST tell us what it knows, and 
when it does, heads are going to roll in Washington for keeping it 
from us for so long.  No bureaucrat or government department wants 
to come forward with previously withheld information if they know 
they are going to be condemned for it in the end.  It is more 
useful to recognize the government for what it is: neither good or 
evil, but a necessary part of our society composed of individuals 
who don't all hold the same views.  To get what you want from any 
organization, you have to understand its needs and the concerns of 
the people who run it.  Instead of railing against the government 
as a whole, it may be more useful to support the elements within 
it that share our goals.

The disruption of society would seem to be a major concern of the 
people in charge; perhaps it is the whole raison d'etre of the 
secrecy.  Politically, it should be the goal of ufologists to 
allay that fear.  We want to send the message: "We can handle it, 
now."  Instead of blasting the keepers of the knowledge, we ought 
to pin a medal on them, tell them how proud we are of their 
accomplishments and let them turn over the reins to us in a 
dignified ceremony before we pack them off to the retirement home.  
These people, no doubt, have been pursuing what they have felt is 
best for the country, and because we do not yet understand the big 
picture, we cannot say that they were wrong.  There could be a lot 
of frightening aspects to the alien info.  In real impact, it may 
not be another World War Two, but the truth could still be 
disturbing enough, emotionally, to require some courage and 
maturity to face.  That it has taken so long to come out may have 
been justified, in which case we don't have to blame anyone for 
what has happened in the past, just proceed from the present.

Of course, Psychospy is not claiming that aliens, UFOs or any 
government cover-up of them are real.  We will not be pinned down 
on this point.  But if they ARE real, we believe the secrecy will 
collapse very quickly when a certain critical mass of social, 
economic and philosophical factors is achieved.  Like the fall of 
the Berlin Wall, it could happen almost overnight.  In fact, the 
collapse of the Soviet Union itself could be the most important 
contributing factor to the fall of the Alien Wall.  It means there 
are fewer bureaucratic niches in which to hide your crashed 
saucers and little gray bodies.  With the moral underpinnings of 
secrecy eroding, and a million internet users now collecting data 
and making it instantly available to the world, never in history 
has it been harder to keep a Really Big Secret.

Perhaps it is time for Psychospy to come out of the closet.  In 
1995, we hope to explore UFOs and alien issues more deeply here in 
the Desert Rat.  We will, of course, remain seated squarely on the 
fence (ouch!) and let the data speak for itself.  Even if there 
are no aliens, the philosophical topic is fascinating:  How do we 
approach a field of knowledge that seems way beyond our current 
understanding?

The solution?  Just panic.  Throw up your hands and run 
hysterically through the streets yelling, "Aggggghhhhhhh!"

Always works for us.

 ----- CAMPBELL GETS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR -----

TRIAL DELAYED TO FEB. 8

Who do you know who gets a Special Prosecutor?  Richard Nixon, 
Ollie North, maybe Clinton if he is lucky.  Campbell feels 
similarly honored to have a Special Prosecutor appointed for him.  
The new S.P. is Steve Dobrescu, a lawyer in private practice in 
Ely, Nevada, hired especially by Lincoln County to handle the 
Campbell obstruction case.  The District Attorney, Tom Dill, says 
that he appointed the S.P. because Campbell's political activities 
were creating a conflict, but we wonder if the D.A. isn't just 
passing the buck because he doesn't like to make difficult 
decisions or appear in court.  This sure must be costing the 
county a bundle.

Now that the D.A. has excused himself from the case, it is 
interesting to note that he can be subpoenaed as a witness should 
it prove necessary.

In any case, Campbell has talked with his Special Prosecutor on 
the phone, sent him his "press packet" and files on the case, and 
declares himself pleased with the choice.  "It is a pleasant 
change to deal with someone who understands both the letter and 
spirit of the law," said Campbell.  "From what I know of him, I 
think he is a straight shooter who will make his own independent 
judgment about the evidence."

Since the D.A. did nothing for five months, and waited until only 
two weeks before the scheduled trial to appoint the S.P., Dobrescu 
requested a further delay of the trial to give him time to review 
the case.  Campbell, acting as his own attorney, has agreed, so a 
new trial date has been set for Feb. 8.  The world is still 
invited.

Some readers have questioned why Campbell has not hired a lawyer 
to defend him in such an important case, given that Campbell does 
not even know how to format a motion [DR#19].  Campbell replies 
that he "wouldn't miss this opportunity for the world," especially 
the chance to strut and bluster before the captive jury.  "I'm 
learning how to be a lawyer by doing it," said Campbell.  
"Essentially, the county is providing my law school.  I may make 
mistakes, but regardless of the outcome, I will emerge as a more 
dangerous legal force in the end."

 ----- TWO NEW ACCUSED TRESPASSERS PLEAD NOT GUILTY -----

....AND ASK FOR A JURY TRIAL

It may be just coincidence, but two visitors recently accused of 
misdemeanor trespass near Freedom Ridge have pleaded NOT GUILTY in 
Pahranagat Valley Justice Court and have asked for a JURY TRIAL.  
Ryan Chivers and Jason Winget of Salt Lake City were intercepted 
by anonymous Cammo Dudes on the evening of Dec. 1, not far from 
the "Restricted Area" signs on Groom Lake Road.  The two admit to 
getting lost briefly in the dark while trying to find Freedom 
Ridge and that they may have unwittingly wandered across the line 
at some point.  The key question is whether they were on public or 
military land at the time of their capture.  According to their 
account, the anonymous Dudes intercepted them outside the 
"Restricted Area" signs and then marched them back inside the 
border, where they were later taken into custody by Deputy 
Lamoreaux of the Sheriff's Dept.

Unless the Cammo Dudes who captured them show up in court to 
testify that the accused were on military, not public land at the 
time of their capture, the two are simply not guilty of the 
trespassing statute they are charged with (NRS 204.200): (A) They 
did not WILLFULLY cross the line, and (B) they were not FOUND 
across the line, except after the Dudes kidnapped them back there.

In any real world justice system, the case would be thrown out 
instantly, but this is Lincoln County ("...now leaving America") 
so we can't expect the D.A. or judge to catch on.  That's why it 
is essential to request a jury trial, where at least there is a 
hope of justice.

This trial is scheduled for Feb. 15, one week after Campbell's.

 ----- LEGAL FUND ESTABLISHED -----

We find a jury trial to be a compelling concept.  It is a 
guaranteed right under Nevada law for any misdemeanor, but it 
won't be offered; you have to ask for it.  We are grateful to T. 
Lindeman for putting us on to this concept.  We regret only that 
we did not know about it in time to help the six defendants 
accused last January [DR#1, etc.].

Imagine what would happen if EVERYONE accused of trespassing opted 
for a jury trial.  This would be the best guarantee of fairness 
for each, especially when local justice and law enforcement 
officials seem so entangled in dubious alliances.  Imagine a full 
jury trial, with all the trimm'ns, happening every other week in 
Pahranagat Valley Justice Court.  The tiny system might be 
swamped, but if this is the price of justice, so be it.  Perhaps, 
in the process, Lincoln County might be encouraged to loosen it's 
secret ties with the Cammo Dudes.

To help encourage justice here, the Area 51 Research Center has 
just established a legal aid fund.  The Research Center will pay 
all or part of the fines of any accused trespasser, provided they 
opt for a jury trial and go through the full legal process.  Going 
to trial is a pain, especially for those who live out of state and 
must come back, but we also find it a excellent form of education, 
an opportunity to learn the legal system by doing it.

This offer applies only to INNOCENT accused trespassers, those who 
did not intentionally cross the line.  We cannot defend those who 
DELIBERATELY intrude into the Restricted Zone and happen to get 
caught.  (What if you get so "lost" that you wander 10 miles 
inside the Zone?  We would have to approach that on a case-by-case 
basis.)  The fund may also be used for other legal pursuits 
relating to the dubious cooperation between the Sheriff's Dept. 
and Cammo Dudes, like securing the release of lost film taken by 
deputies for "processing" and never returned.

Contributions already made by our generous readers to the Campbell 
Defense Fund will be transferred into the new Accused Trespassers 
Defense Fund.  New contributions may be sent to us at the Area 51 
Research Center.  (Please tell us your email address or Secret 
Agent Code Name and let us know whether we can print an 
acknowledgment of your contribution here in the Rat.)


 ----- LAND GRAB STATUS / OUTING PROPOSED -----

It isn't yet time to schedule our "End of the World Party" on 
Freedom Ridge.  The wheels of government turn slowly and there are 
still more steps in the withdrawal process.  We talked to Neil 
Talbot at the BLM Reno Office for the latest update.  First the 
BLM has to respond to the ten protests raised to the "Proposed 
Land Use Amendment" (which had to be filed by Dec. 9).  How long 
this takes will depend on the quality of the protests, but it 
seems likely to extend into the new year.  When all the protests 
are settled, BLM could issue a "final record of decision" 
approving the withdrawal.  However, the implementation of that 
decision can then be appealed to the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals--while the land, presumably, remains open.

We think it's a riot that this action, supposedly a shoo-in for 
the military, has stretched out for so long, miring one part of 
the government in the bureaucracy of another.  No matter what the 
end result may be, the military has lost this battle badly because 
it fought the WRONG battle:  It fought for the land instead of for 
the hearts and minds of the people.  The last laugh is, Freedom 
Ridge doesn't exist.  It is an artificial public relations concept 
created here in the laboratories of our Research Center.  It has 
done its job well--like a car that was supposed to last 100,000 
miles but you manage to squeeze 300,000 out of it.  No matter what 
happens now we can't complain.

We won't schedule our "End of the World" event until we have a 
solid closure date.  In the meantime, however, some readers have 
expressed an interest in holding another casual get-together on 
Freedom Ridge in January.  This could turn into the "End of the 
World Party" if the withdrawal process moves more quickly than 
anticipated, but for now we'll just call it an anniversary event.  
It will be a year ago in January that we unveiled the four wheel 
drive "Freedom Ridge Expressway."  At the ribbon-cutting 
ceremonies--reported way back in DR#1--we welcomed aviation 
writers and buffs for a "last glimpse" of the secret base before 
the land might be closed.  Hundreds have visited the ridge since 
then, including respectable journalists from all over the world, 
as well as the entire editorial staff of THE NOSE Magazine on one 
of their mindless drink-and-drive sex-house road trips out of San 
Francisco.

The dates proposed for this anniversary event are Jan. 14, 21 or 
28.  We encourage input from those interested as to which date is 
best.  We'll call this our Second-Annual-Could-Be-Closed-Any-Day-
Now-Freedom-Ridge-Inspection-Visit.  In January, the weather can 
be pleasant (or horrible) during the day, but it is too cold to 
camp at night.  (Last year, the wind was calm with daytime highs 
around 50 and nighttime lows in the teens.)

Meanwhile, the out-of-touch Cammo Dudes thought they were going to 
get the land Dec. 9.  In anticipation, we hear that they took down 
the yellow ribbons marking the public hiking trail to Freedom 
Ridge, which is not yet their authority to do.  Time to send 
another strong letter to the Air Force.

 ----- MORE LARRY KING COMMENTS -----

   "Now, I might have been temporally insane, but by any chance 
did you see those lights that started to appear around the end of 
the show?  A couple of them seemed to get brighter and dimmer as 
they hovered behind those 'expert's' heads and I saw at least one 
that zigzagged across the screen.  I counted around four that just 
hovered.  Were those search lights from Area 51? or something 
else?"
  -- OutKast00@aol.com

We offer two theories:  (1) Headlights of cars in the distance and 
(2) moths attracted to the bright stage lights after dark.  In any 
case, to avoid conflicts with the setting sun, the cameras were 
pointed to the north, away from Area 51.  When Larry King pointed 
to secret base "just over those hills," it was the wrong 
direction!

 ----- CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES -----

The ILLEGAL REPEATER STATION on public land reported in DR#18 has 
been removed to inside the military border.  (We are not sure 
whether it happened before or after the publication of DR#18.)

Several MORMONS on our subscription list sent us email about our 
suggestion in DR#18 that Lincoln County elections were dominated 
by local Mormons voting as a block.  These big-city Mormons say 
that any political lobbying from the pulpit is strictly forbidden 
by the church.  They say that it is unfair to blame the whole 
church for small-town attitudes, which might be the same in the 
rural South, where Southern Baptists rule, or in remote 
Appalachia, where folks just can't read.  We agree that there are 
other theories to account for the unhappy election results apart 
from the easy Mormon one:  The most prominent we overlooked is 
that, because the county lacks industry and is rich in family 
ties, almost everyone here seems to either work for the county 
government or be related to someone who does.  Naturally, these 
people aren't going to vote for anyone who promises "change" 
because that could mean that Uncle Fred will be out of a job.

 ----- INTEL BITTIES -----

PHOTOGRAPHY APPEAL.  If you have visited the Rachel area and lost 
film to the Lincoln County Sheriff's Dept. (for "processing"), 
please get in touch with us.  (If you have already talked to us, 
then reaffirm your presence.)  This information could be important 
in upcoming court cases.

PAPOOSE VIEWPOINT DISCOVERED.  Papoose Lake, the mysterious and 
inaccessible area 15 miles south of Groom where Bob Lazar says he 
worked with alien craft, isn't as invisible as previously 
supposed.  You can see the Papoose lake bed from at least one 
mountain far to the south, near US-95.  Unfortunately, the 
distance from the viewpoint to the lakebed is about 45 miles, so 
you won't make out much without a good telescope--but at least you 
can say you've seen it.  tmahood@netcom.com and spouse were the 
first to visit the viewpoint, discovered with the help of a 
mystery source we shall call "C".  For a free copy of tmahood's 
"Mt. Sterling Guide" describing the area, send him an email 
message.  (The internet impaired can send us $1 for a copy by 
regular mail, anywhere in the world.)

MONTEL ROASTED ON 20/20.  THE MONTEL WILLIAMS SHOW [DR#15 & #16] 
got its just desserts on a 9/16 report on ABC's 20/20.  In a story 
on talk-show ethics (or lack thereof), 20/20 recounted the story 
of a woman lured onto the Montel show under false pretenses, who 
was then told, on the air, that her sister had had "mercy sex" 
with her former boyfriend.  Pure sleaze, but we knew that already.

WWW SITE NEEDED.  The "World Wide Web" is quickly becoming the 
hottest thing on the internet.  (America On-Line promises to offer 
it soon.)  You type in a starting address, and a document is 
displayed on the screen.  Click on a highlighted word in the text, 
and another document is displayed, providing more details.  It's 
one of the best ways we've seen to organize complex information 
and make it available to the public.

Roland@cac.washington.edu has set up a WWW structure for back 
issues of the Desert Rat [See footer below.] but the Research 
Center has been working on a more elaborate structure pulling 
together a lot of diverse info on Area 51 and related topics (for 
example: a special section devoted entirely to "Modern Munchausen" 
Sean David Morton).  Our only problem is that we need a reliable, 
low cost Web server to keep our files on.  We've tried some 
commercial internet providers but haven't found what we need.  We 
welcome advice from other users in finding a "home" for this 
material.  (We would need direct FTP write access and require 5mg 
to start.  Also, we want to be totally "above board"--paying by 
the mg if we have to--so we can stay at this server permanently.)

NAME CHANGE.  To reduce the confusion of our many names and 
aliases, our mail order arm, formerly "Secrecy Oversight Council," 
has changed its name to "Area 51 Research Center."  Frankly, the 
entire "Council" could eat from the same bowl, so we thought it 
would be more direct to call ourselves by the simpler moniker.  
"Secrecy Oversight" is still our game, but it seems that Area 51 
will remain our focus for some time to come.

 ----- ASK PSYCHOSPY -----

Dear Psycho:

   "Are there any female 'Cammo Dudes'?  If not, why not, and does 
affirmative action apply?"

   --stephenh@netcom.com

Dear Stephenh:

   The C.D. force would never allow no bitches.  Mostly solid 
white males, the pride of our country.  You can see the Dudes' 
point of view, can't you?  It is doubtful that women could keep up 
with the rigorous physical demands of the job (sitting around in 
Jeep Cherokees all day) or that they have the brainpower to outwit 
those clever tourists.  Remember Tailhook?  That's EXACTLY what 
happens when you let women in.  We can't compromise national 
security or the integrity of the force.  (Now don't get us wrong, 
we don't mind a piece of "A" now and then, but sometimes it's just 
too close for comfort.)

   Psycho
