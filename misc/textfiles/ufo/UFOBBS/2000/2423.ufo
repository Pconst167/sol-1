SUBJECT: MON-KA OF MARS                                      FILE: UFO2423






Mon-Ka is many people's favorite Martian. According to one chronicler, he "has 
a wisdom that is light years beyond the most intelligent person on our 
planet."

Mon-Ka first communicated with earthlings in April 1956 at the Giant Rock 
Spacecraft Convention in Southern California, when contactee Dick Miller 
played recordings that he said had mysteriously appeared on tapes in sealed 
cans. On the tapes Mon-Ka asked a favor and made a promise: "On the evening of 
November 7, of this your year 1956, at 10:30 P.M. your local time, we request 
that one of your communications stations remove its carrier signal from the 
air for two minutes. At that time we will speak from our craft, which will be 
stationed at an altitude of 10,000 feet over your great city of Los Angeles."

In September Miller went to London and played the tapes for impressionable 
British saucer fans. The Associated Press' tongue-in-cheek treatment  afforded 
the story international attention. A subsequent Los Angeles Mirror-News 
account revealed that Miller had once faked a radio communication from a 
saucer in his native Detroit. Nonetheless, Southern California succumbed to 
Mon-Ka mania. Two mass rallies were held in Los Angeles in late October, and 
organizer Gabriel Green enthusiastically talked up the Martian on Art 
Linkletter's popular House Party television show.

When the evening of November 7 rolled around, the faithful climbed to the 
rooftops and scanned the skies. As publicity gimmicks two radio stations went 
off the air at the appointed hour, and a television station sent out a plane 
to look for the Martian spaceship. Mon-Ka did not show up.

He was not, however, gone for good. Since then Mon-Ka has channeled psychic 
communications to numerous contactees. Today he is beloved as a tireless (and 
garrulous) "soldier for the cause of peace," in the words of one admirer.
