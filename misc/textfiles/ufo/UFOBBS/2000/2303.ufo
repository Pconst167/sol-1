SUBJECT: BILL COOPER'S CLAIMS OF ATTACK                      FILE: UFO2303


PART 5




 I have known that Lear is an agent ever since February of
 1972 and I have confided that in not 1 or 2 people but in
 probably 12 or 13 people and maybe more than that over the
 last several years. I am sure that most of them will confirm
 it if the need arises. Bob Swan also knows it. In the
 "Secret Government" I stated that I saw Moore, Friedman, and
 Maccabee on a list of agents to be recruited ALONG WITH
 SEVERAL OTHERS THAT I DID NOT NAME AND IT IS STATED IN THAT
 PAPER. I told Lear that I saw his name on the list several
 days before MUFON. My wife was present and heard the entire
 conversation. Lear wasn't able to look me in the eye. The
 people helping him get MUFON organized wondered why I was
 not at Lear's home helping them and that is why. Lear stayed
 far away from me the whole time and even kept aloof from
 everyone else also. He was terrified that I would reveal him
 along with Moore, Friedman, and Maccabee. Lear gave himself
 away when he and Grace wrote the Krill papers. He is just
 like Moore. He throws truth mixed with lies out and then
 laughs at the public. Lear knows all about O.H. Krlll, the
 real one, and he got caught by me. O.H. Krlll exposed Lear
 not me. Anyone and everyone who has worked with this
 information knows he blew it. He honestly thought that no
 one else knew the truth. I played him just like I played
 Moore and I caught him just like I caught Moore. Lear KNOWS
 EVERYTHING. It's an old trick and Strieber is using it now
 with his book MAJESTIC. Now if anyone comes out with
 anything from GRUDGE about Forestall or the Roswell crash
 you will all say he stole it from Strieber. Sorry boys but
 it won't work anymore. People are sick of lies, deception
 and traitors and we are all sick of you.
 Lear showed me a copy of a 2 inch thick book written by
 employees of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory which is a
 very thorough parody of the "YELLOW BOOK". I pretended that
 I did not know what it was and Lear had a great time. I did
 recognize an old friend who works at Livermore Lab and it
 has turned out good for me. The friend is one who put
 together a ......... trip to the ........ of the
 ............. ............ of the ...... and I helped him
 prepare. Filling in the blanks would reveal his identity. I
 told Lear at the time that I knew one of the authors of the
 parody. The man owed me. Since his name was in the parody I
 knew that he had seen the real "YELLOW BOOK". That knowledge
 has been very useful.
     THIS CONCLUDES MY EXCERPT OF BILL COOPER'S ANSWER. IT SHOULD 
 PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO MEALY MOUTHS WHO STAND IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO
DISCREDIT PERSONS WITH HONEST OPINIONS. THERE ARE ALSO ENOUGFH FACTS 
 CONTAINED IN THESE WORDS TO THOROUGHLY CHECK OUT THE SIMPS WHO ARE TRYING TO
PULL THE WOOL OVER EVERYBODY'S EYES.
    CIAOU!!!!! T.S.
