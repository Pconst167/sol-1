Another Viewpoint: WHAT STARTED WORLD WAR II? A response to the Fencwick 
interview.


In the FENWICK.TXT file, an Interview done by Tom Mickus last year, created
some rather unusual repercusions in the UFO community, Fenwick talks about 
Hitler and WW 2. Let's look at a couple of excerpts from the lengthy interview.

1) "We talked about things other than UFOlogy for most of the time. As we left 
the property...we were about 35-40 feet away from Bob, and he called out to us. 
[and] he made this statement...and we wrote it down in the car, 'What was the 
cause of WWII?' He had been told...,the classified information about 
programming of Hitler..to cause WW II. And we did an article about the case, 
with the exception of that statement. As we thought it didn't fit in."

2) "We also discussed why the aliens view the human's as a "failed experiment".

3) "When referring to the programming of Hitler by the EBE's, which in effect 
caused WW II (the decision of one man)...."

   This, to this individual was a very deep statement -- and it was literally 
glossed over, and I believe very few really looked at in in any great depth. 
Why? Because it appeared to be so "off the wall". At certain intervals durring 
the interveiw, Fenwick is having a difficult time attempting to express the 
situation as he perceives it. My first impulse, prior to even being involved 
with ParaNet was to get down to the heart of the matter, and challenge Fenwick 
in the claims he made. But I didn't (Tom's board went down). Although his 
interview seems so highly "unusual", I have perceived some things in the 
interview which play a major undercurrent in the entire UFO scenario. There are 
constant dredgings of the Hitler programming theme followed with various 
religious implications. Yet nobody has offered to look directly into the 
motivation behind Hitler, and the belief systems which pushed Hitler and other 
Europeans onward. 
 
  In order to gain any benefit from this file, although their may be 
mentionings of many things such as Judeo/Christians, Aryans, Nazi's, it is 
important to view these things as a motivational factor which drive men to do 
the things they do. There are tendencies towards "blind acceptance". The word 
"acceptance" itself is indicative of belief. However, "understanding" indicates 
knowledge of the mechanisms behind things. All of us, who are interested in 
the phenomena itself, are trying to come to an understanding... As we attempt 
to understand, we are then forced to look at things from various angles. This 
file is not the sum total of angles, and is only offered in an attempt to 
present a small facet of the phenomena itself. 



   Let's examine some interesting things about the Third Reich from non UFO 
Sources --- and then ask ourselves, again, "WHAT Started World War II?"


   "The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide"

                      by Robert J. Lifton (C) 1986


Extreme rumors spread through the camp about Block 10. Prisoners considered it 
a "sinister place" of mysterious evil. There were widespread rumors that 
Clauberg was conducting experiments in artificial insemination, and women were 
terrified of having "monsters" implanted in their wombs. Some suriviors I spoke 
to believed that those experiments actually occured. Another account had 
Clauberg speaking of his intentions to carry out artificial-insemination 
experiments in the future. There were also rumors of a "museum" on Block 10: 
"Skulls, body parts, even mummies"; and one survivor insisted, "A friend...saw 
... our Gymnasium [high school] teacher stuffed [mummified] on Block 10." 
Again, anything was possible, and whatever occured there was likely to be a 
manifestation of the Nazi racial claim.

* Himmler's vision had varying gradations of abusrdity and pesudo science. For 
instance, he was an ardent believer (as were Hitler and Goring) in such 
expressions of mystical racism as the idea that the lost continent of Atlantis 
had been the original homeland of the Aryans, and that Aryans had not evolved 
from monkeys or apes like the rest of mankind but had descended to earth from 
the heavens where they had been preserved in ice from the beginning of time. 
Himmler, in fact, in 1937 established a meteorological division in the 
Ahnenerbe (see pages 284-87) to "prove" his "cosmic-ice" theory, though 
publicly the purpose of the new division was announced as developing new 
techniques for long-range weather preidiction. Sympathetic to nature healing 
and equally ardent critic of traditionalism and "Christian" prejudices of 
establishment doctors, he could view human experimentation in concentration 
camps as a form of liberation from these constraints in the name of bold 
scientific innovation.

           Anthropological Research: Specimens for a Museum


   Block 10 played an important part in a form of "anthropological research" 
that was among the most grotesque expressions of the Nazi biomedical vision. 
Dr. Marie L. tells of its Aushchwitz beginnings:

   "There appeared [on block 10] a new protagonist of racial theories. He chose 
his material by having naked women of all ages file ... in front of him. He 
wanted to do anthropological measurements ... He had measurements of all the 
parts of the body taken ad infinitum ... They were told that they had the 
extraordinary good fortune to be selected, that they would leave Auscheitz to 
go to an excellent camp, somewhere n Germany ... [where] they would be very 
well treated, where they would be happy."

   Dr. L. had seen enough of Auschwitz to suspect the terrible truth ("I told 
myself immediately,..."They are going to a museum'"), though she and others 
refrained from saying so because they "lacked the courage", felt it would be 
more kind to remain silent, and could not in any case be certain of their 
suspicion.

   These women were taken to the concentration camp at Natzweiler, near 
Strasbourg, which although not designated as an extermination camp, nonetheless 
possessed its own gas chamber with the usual false showerheads as well as one 
additional feature: a one-way mirror that allowed those on the outside of the 
gas chamber to observe those inside. This mirror had been installed because 
the gas chamber itself had been constructed as part of the necessary research 
equipment.

   A prisoner doctor reported that the group of Auschwitz women (thirty - nine 
of them according to their records) were given a sham phsycial examination for 
reassurance, then gassed, and then the corpses were immediately transported to 
the anatomy pavilion of the Strasbourg University Hospital. A French inmate, 
who had to assist the project's director, SS Captain Dr. August Hirt, told how 
"preservation began immediately" with the arrival of bodies that were "still 
warm, the eye ... wide open and shining." There were two subsequent shipments 
of men, from each of whom the left testicle had been removed and sent to Hirt's 
anatomy lab.

   Hirt, a professor of anatomy, had under Himmler's instructions prepared the 
cyanide salts used to kill the Auschwitz prisoners in what was the inaugrural 
use of the new gas chamber. He had originally advocated in a memo to Himmler 
the securing of skulls of captured "Jewish-Bolshevik commissars." The goal at 
that time was to "acquire tangible scientific research material" that would 
"represent ... a repulsive but typical speices of subhumanity." The memo 
recommended that a "junior phsycician attatched to the Wehrmacht" first take 
photographs and perform various measurements and studies on subjects while 
still alive, make sure that the head is not damaged in the killing, and then 
take other specific measures for preserving the head and shipping it to the 
designated research institute where various studies could be performed on the 
skull and brain including those of "racial classification" and "pathological 
features of the skull formation." In locating two ultimate evils (Jewish and 
Bolshevik) in members of that group, and anticipating specific anatomical 
findings in their skulls or brains, the Nazis were acting upon the most extreme 
blend of racial-biomedical and political ideology.

   But there were apparently difficulties in rounding up "Jewish-Bolshevik 
commissars" and possibly in severing heads, so that it was decided to make use 
of full skeletons rather than merely skulls and to collect specimens in the 
place where any such task could be accomplished -- neamely, Aushwitz. It was 
said that 115 people were victimized in this way, all Jews (79 men, 30 women) 
with the exception of 2 Poles and 4 Central Asians. The relatively high 
priority of the project is suggested by EIchmann's having been involved with 
it's arrangements. The whole enterprise, bizarre even by Nazi standards, was 
sponsored by the Ahnenerbe ("ancestral heritage") office of the SS, which 
Himmler had created in 1939 to develop "historical" and "scientific" studies of 
the "Nordic Indo-Germanic race." Ahnenerbe brought mystical concepts to science 
("the unity of soul and body, mind and blood') and combined the Gestapo mission 
of controlling Germany's intellectual life with Himmler's visionary ideas. It 
supported projects in archeology, German racial consciousness outside of 
Germany proper, and medical experiments in concentration camps. Under Himmler's 
order, Ahnenerbe even came to sponsor a research program making use of Jewish 
mathematicians in concentration camps to work out theoretical problems of 
rocket production. Experiments in camps that it sponsored included Dr. Sigmund 
Rascher's notorious research in Dachau on the effects of high altitude, in 
which he wantonly killed experimantal subjects: and the still more murderous 
work of Schuler in Buchenwald on typhus vaccines, in which six hundred people 
were killed.

   Hirt was said to have been brought into the Ahnenerbe by a  man who became 
his assistant in the Strasbourg project -- Bruno Beger, an SS officer on 
Himmler's personal staff who had been sent to study anthropolgy in Berlin. 
Beger tended to embrace Himmler's wildest theories, and it was Beger who made 
the original arrangements in Auschwitz and perhpas worte under Hirt's name the 
extraordinary memo I have just quoted.

   A former ardent Nazi, who remembered Hirt as a good friend and colleague 
during their days together as young instructors at a leading German medical 
center, described him as originally Swiss but a naturalized German, "a Nordic 
type with blue eyes and fair hair," an honorable and stable man even if at 
times a "bit impulsive," and an excellent anatomist with a promising academic 
career. A colleague of my own in the United States, however, who had studied 
under Hirt, remembered him as a very arrogant and threatening Nazi. In any 
case, there is no dout about either Hirt's passionate Nazi involvement or the 
centrality of the Nazi biomedical vision in his participation in the "museum" 
project, even if Beger was its driving force. (Pricesly that centrality was 
what Hirt's old friend wished to deny in his insisence that Hirt's entire 
behavior could be understood as an expression of the callouseness of the 
anatomist.)

   Toward the end of the war, there was apparently some confusion about 
whether and how much to continue with research procedures, and eventually the 
evidence was ordered to be destroyed. But that process could not be completed, 
and French forces liberating Strasbourg found in Hirt's dissection room "many 
wholly unprocessed corpses," many "partly-processed corpses," and a few that 
had been "defleshed ... late in 1944," and their heads burned to avoid any 
possibility of identification -- with "special care taken to remove the number 
tattooed on the left forearm." Hirt himself disappeared at that time and is now 
known to have killed himself shortly aferward.

   This museum project is remarkable for its merging of Himmler's racial vision 
with highly concrete, pseudo-scientific anthropoligical (Beger) and medical 
(Hirt) participation -- all a logical outgrowth of the Nazi biological and 
political mentality. 

                          ---------------------


I ran across this book, just by chance at the local Mall. I happened to just 
open the book up to the above chapter dealing with Ananarbe. It rather stuck in 
my mind for several various reasons. First of all, the mood generated by the 
accounts of what occured at the Museum reminded me of abductee horror stories 
about body parts, examinations, genetic experiments. 

Also, it appeared that the SS Museum was an inactment at the objective level of 
the subjective experience that many abductees report. The "High Strangeness" 
brought to a reality, in order to correct a "failed experiment" (inferior 
humans, as viewed through the eyes of the Nazis). The "High Strangeness" is 
brought out in numerous publications. Whitley Strieber had written about it in 
his "Communion". Bud Hopkins utilizes it to demonstrate what he feels, to be 
continual contact by alien intelligences. The Lear/Cooper camp creates the 
scenarios of alien undergound bases, collection of human specimens, 
mutilations, and the governments knowledge of these "secret pacts" and their 
desire to hide them from American citizens. Invaribaly, something "spiritual" 
always occur to these individuals who have had the experience. Then Fenwick and 
prior to him, the JWHITE files were circulated. Check your "local" ParaNet 
board for them, if you choose to research into this further.


Does this neccessarily, however, prove that Hitler was programmed by EBE's? If 
we think along the lines in which Lear would like us to think, and Fenwick 
expands upon, we could almost imagine that our government made a pact with 
Lucifer in exchange for technology, and saw the error of their way too late. 
The exchange, would be the "souls" of American Citizens, and of course, with a 
country which boasts of the Motto "In God We Trust", indeed would merit the 
effort to coverup the situation at all costs. It would be rather embarrasing to 
admit that a country which has such claims as The United States does, in 
regards to it's relationship with it's God, that it could conceivably be so 
decieved, as to imagine these "aliens" as being true representatives of God. 
However, if one were to look at it from a logical point of view, if there were 
to be influence exherted over the world, the United States would be the best 
place to "set up reconnaissance" zones, as it does have the resources available 
to achieve various ends, along with the afforded "freedoms" to allow the 
operation to continue without notice. It would be ironic to discover that
these freedoms could very well be the tool which these "aliens" are utilizing 
to gain a good grip in our social structures.

What I find highly interesting about what Fenwick has to say about Hitler, is 
the programming of Hitler. Was Hitler programmed? Or could he have been 
mesmerized by a belief system that was growing in great proportion durring that 
era? 

The 1800's had some rather intriguing events in it. Durring that era, fresh 
from the termoil the "Middle Ages" spawned, with full emergence from control 
over a ruling theocratic organization that did everything within it's power to 
bring things under subjection in the "Name of God", politicaly, religiously, 
and including the ability to freely exchange knowledge, what occured appears to 
be somewhat natural, in regards to the emergance of "Freedom of Speech and 
Expression of THoughts". Led to extremes, like children who are suddenly 
released from two weeks of being grounded, what resulted? Confusion, chaos, 
war, and bloodshed. Anger towards "god" (which in reality was earthly 
institutions) Rebellion against this conflict inspired Marx. It also brought 
"metaphysics" and "secret societies" more into the open. Men were once again 
allowed the freedom to grow in the exchange of information, along with the 
development of sciences without fear of being placed under an edict, or drug 
before the Inquisitors for heretic behaviour. Many theologens, philosophers and 
social psychologist look back upon this era as the "beginning of the end". 
Theologins blame philosophy for the degredation of society, yet, on the other 
hand, the philosophers blamed the theologins for suppression. These conflicts 
continue today, just as they did then. Things have not changed. 

In the United States, great religious revivals were spawned. Of these, most 
noteably, was Brigham Young who led his followers through the wilderness to 
Utah. Durring this era a group of Bible students were waiting for the physical 
arrival of the "prophets" of old, (these later became the Jehovah's Witnesses). 
The 7th day Adventist Movement begun, and Protestentism begun to flourish, 
bringing with it Democracy, and it's economical and political way of life which 
transformed the world into what it is today. Durring this era, the occult 
explosion hit America, and durring this time, H.P. Blavasky organized the 
Theosophical Society. Many could state that this is the beginning, but is it? 
To look for absolutes would be an encyclopediac undertaking, and cannot be 
achieved within a single file! So we will content ourselves with this era, 
since it itself appears to play an important factor in the minds of many who 
create the phenomena scenario we are presented with today. From LEAR in the 
prelude to his file, to George Hunt Williamson who claimed the "Visitants" 
had been attempting to indoctrinate the world to a new way of life since the 
1800's. (Road In The Sky (C) 1959 p.246).

The curiosity of the world was limitless, as archeological digs begun, in 
efforts to understand many mysteries that could otherwise not be explained. The 
pyramids became popular durring that era, the phenomena of the South American 
Empires, and the discovery that Europe, Africa, China and India where not the 
sum total of what had been at one time great civilizations. Durring all of this 
exploration, they discovered many common things which then created more wonder 
as to wether or not the things they were led to believe in were actually true. 

Old legends led many to wonder, just what occured in the past. Under Blavasky's
funding, a Mr. James Churchwald set out on a quest to discover just what the 
"true religion" may have been. From here, tales of Mu, Lamaria, and Atlantis 
came to the fore. These inquiries always led to some speculation that the 
United States could very well have been the "Motherland" which was laid waiste 
due to some ancient catastrophy. 

We could, politicaly, and moraly, based upon our own standards, view the system 
which motivated Hitler as brutal, barbaric, and uncalled for. Yet, we fail to 
see that this very type of religious motivation is the medium which drives 
the MidEastern terrorists in vindicating themselves in the name of Allah, their
God. This type of zeal pushed the Inquisitors foreward in mass killings in 
order to purge the land of "infidels" -- the psychology of a Jihid is very 
powerful and the Islamic Jihid is the very bases for the Dune science fiction 
story. The power behind a drug, a belief system, and politics. All drawn into 
one event, to drive the hearts of men onward to do deeds in the name of their 
god. If we strip away the politics of WW II, and look at the mood of the era 
which created the politics, one can wonder, just what started World War II? And 
where is the blame? And can we safely assume that Hitler was the single 
proginitor of the war? Close examination shows otherwise.

What is very interesting about this point in time in history (1800's), is the 
open investigation of mesmerism, along with the rapid advance in electricity. 
Durring this era, the usage of drugs was common. Many things were allowed due 
to not fully knowing the full consequences of what could happen. These early 
efforts could be equaited with irresponsible children playing with things they 
ought not to because they didn't understand them. The cause and effect, were 
still under investigation. Things were done, just to see what would happen. 
Many things were attempted in efforts to understand something. However, this 
does not mean that they did not realize the effect --- Durring this time, the 
effect would be ignored usually with a motivation in order to understand. 
Today, we can think in terms of "mad scientists" doing all kinds of crazy 
experiments --- yet, these very things are the price we pay for advancement. We 
can say that we owe much to science. A debt. It is, however, a point of view, 
as to what this debt is and how it is being paid. The "Mad Scientists" of today 
are not the Boris Karloff grade B 1950's type. Today, they could very well be 
with us.... in the guise of "National Security", or perhaps "subversive 
activists". 

Today we have rumors and tales of Telsa, and his radio-magnetic energies. 
Today, we have settled for the form of electricity which we use in our homes. 
Today, we are being led to believe that Telsa's inventions were ridiculed and 
set aside, but there could be another very real possibility in why Telsa's 
achievments have never made it very far in the world of consumers. There is a 
great possibility that Telsa's discoveries had unusual effects upon the human 
mind, and with knowledge of this, kept "under wraps" and never made available 
for the consumers of energy and power. We know electromagnetics exist, yet we 
also know it is not utilized at the consumer level. My first question is, "What 
happened with Telsa technology? And just how widely was it used? Many things 
back in this era were utilized to "enhance" occult powers. There is a great 
coincidence in the rise of electricity, preoccupation with "magnetics", and the 
sudden increase in "occult" powers. Can we state that the "aliens" gave us our 
technology? Or is there per chance that we created the situation due to our 
technological advances? There is a tendency for all "contact" to be in 
accordance with the advances of the decade. 


Techno Drugs?

In December 1988 issue of OMNI Magazine, the article entitled "Transending 
Science" deals with investigation of the TM experience. One excerpt of the 
article which was highly interesting, was Persingers work, in which he created 
a helmet, in which a computer was utilized to "contour" the electromagnetic 
forces which in turn manipulated the brain wave patterns of the temporal lobes. 
With this experiment, he discovered that with little effort, the subjects in 
the research could then be, with consistancy, brought into a subjective state 
in which they were then experiencing the abductee scene. It also took very 
little effort for Persinger to produce a UFO sighting. 

To determin the consistancy of this effect, he determined that it was more 
readily to occur while the individual was being subjected to the 
electromagnetic influence of the helmet. He also discovered that the 
participants found the experience highly pleasurable, and they wanted more. He 
also found that with very little effort after several sessions, tonal sounds, 
or various symbols would then put these subjects into the TM state without any 
effort on their part. In other words, Persinger indicated that with 
electromagnetics, it was possible to take different people and get them to see 
similar things while in the TM state.

Is it possible, that these early 20th Century Scientists, still fresh from 
metaphysical schools of thoughts (which are the precursor to applied sciences) 
stumbled across the above experience and utilized it in their own occult 
practices? 

In another book, called "Mind Wars" (C) 1984 St. Martin's Press, Ron McRae 
decided to look into the possibility of government use of "psychic powers" in 
warfare. On Page 135-136, we find the following:

"The second stage of the present psychic old war, according to Swann, is, "the 
many forms of external manipulations that are known to change the interior 
psychic formation of any man or woman...the most gross of these techniques was 
the early form of brainwashing, where subtle suggestion was enforced and 
embedded along with vicious and violent physical trauma. Since that time, 
however, we now have the refined techniques known as subliminal persuasion 
behavior modification and various forms of covert mind control."

"Swann probably understates the second point. I have said little of these 
techniques, in part because many are electronic and not "psychic" in the 
gernerally understood sense, in part because little information is available, 
and in part for another reason -- security.

"There is, according to the best sources, a real threat in the electronic 
manipulation of the human mind. The possibility arose from research that 
attempted to explain telepathy electrognetically. Unfortunately, although the 
researchers did not discover, as they sought, that thoughts could influence 
long-range electromagnetic radiation, they did discover that long-range 
electromagnetic radiation might influence the mind."

"According to Barbara Honegger, "the fundamental reason for the increased 
interest" in psychic warfare, and the area where the Pentagon spends most of 
its estimated six-million-dollar annual budget for psychic or related research, 
"is initial results coming out of laboratories in the United States and Canada 
that certain amplitude and frequency combinations of external electromagnetic 
radiation in the brain-wave frequency range are capable of bypasing the 
external sensory mechanism of organisms, including humans, and directly 
stimulating higher-level neuronal structures in the brain. This electronic 
simulation is known to produce mental changes at a distance, including 
hallucinations in various sensory modalities, particularly auditory." 

                        ----------------

When did these inquiries begin? As early as the 50's? 40's? 30's? Or should we 
move it back even further? And, is there the slightest possibility that 
electromagnetics in conjuntion with usage of drugs, noteably LSD, at some point 
in time in the past, could be a factor in "highly strange" experiences? Along 
with possible body chemistries? 

A book called "The Time Tables of History: A Horizontal Linkage of People and 
Events" by Bernard Grun, based upon Werner Stein's Kultufrahrplan, (C) 1982 has 
some interesting "linear scientific" achievments. Including electricity.

(there are, of course, numerous mentionings of various works done in regards to 
electricity -- these, I highlighted. Reference the book for complete linier 
progress of technology durring the era).

Back in the 50's, when UFO invasion appeared absolute in the minds of millions 
of Americans, there arose the UFO Prophets. Of the literature that I have read 
about these prophets, the works of Howard Menger's "From Outer Space" (C) 1959, 
and George Hunt Williamson's "Road In The Sky" (C) 1958, contain some 
interesting information. Even though these were considered after the passage of 
time a "hoax", there messages are thriving quite well these days. Menger, 
specificaly brought some interesting points up durring a Question and Answer 
session at the end of his book on  Page 163. (For complete Question/Answer 
session in Menger's book, refer to MENGER.)

The question is:

"How are the visitors trying to raise the mass consciousness of the people?"

Menger answers with:

   A. By various methods such as:
      a. Dissemination of saucer research data.
      b. Stories of contacts with their own.
      c. Their signs in the sky.
      d. Mechanically by means of mental capsulation and machines.

   Mental capsulation can be projected by sound, color, vibration. A 
high-frequency sound can be a mental capsulation; a song or a selection of 
music can be a mental capsulation.

    The machines which send out super-sonic high frequency sounds use a man's 
body as a terminal in conjunction with the mental capsulation. Ther are three 
terminal bodies in each state, The machines now operate on a silent carrier 
wave.

                           ---------------

    Now, let's skip back a few pages and review Mengers reactions when he was 
given these "devices" by the "Space Brothers". On page 62 Menger writes:

   "Then they talked further of their many contacts all over the world and my 
job in particular."

   "One of my tasks was the mental assistance of individuals often without 
their knowledge. Such could be accomplished by soun-frequency waves, light 
waves, the use of colors and other physical means. I had alays thought of such 
matters as being accomplished in some supernatural manner; but I was rapidly 
learning that the Infinite Creator accomplished all purposes by natural laws."

  "'Do not think of this as some artificial control of the human brain,' one of 
the men said, "as you may see in some of those horrifying science-fiction 
pictures -- though I must confess that he (and he indicated the other man) and 
I aw two of them on a double picture (I assume he meant to say 'double 
feature') and rather enjoyed them. We do not control the brain. Such an action 
is not in keeping with the laws of the Infinite Creator. Instead, with 
theproper instruments and techniques, you can accomplish a much larger purpose: 
YOU CAN RELEASE SOMTHING IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS ALREADY THERE.''

   "The instruments in the car accomplished such tasks. I would be asked to 
place them in four states: New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. 
With each intrusment would be aman or woman who would act as a human terminal 
in conjunction with the machine. These people would react according to their 
own individual brain development with the assistance of the impulses received 
by the machines."

   "I didn't quite understand how it was to work, but it seemed they were 
trying to get across that it was necessary to have both the machine and the 
human mind working in conjunction to accomplish such a purpose."

   "'A central location will be established for each instrusment. The range of 
each instrument is about 25 miles.'"

   "'After you place these instruments, Howard, you will notice an immediate 
and obvious effect. People within a raius of 25 miles of each instrument will 
automatically become more aware of and conscious of their interest in space 
travel and in our space crage. They will see more of our craft because they 
will be loOking up. Then when these people hear of your experiences, they will 
be inspired to come to you and offer to help you in any way they can."

   "They had already established many bases. The one in New Jersey was, they 
said, within 15 miles of my home, totally unknown to anyone, except, of course, 
those of this planet who had been working with the space people for many 
years."
                                ------------

   Points to ponder. In the OMNI article on Persinger's work, it demonstrates 
that their are particular images which are consistant in the laboratory when 
exposed to electromagnetics. Is there a slight possibility, that perhaps an 
early form of electromagnetics was utilized to influence these individuals? 
Today, it is said, these "beams" are coming from outer space. Then, they were 
down on earth. They appear to be proportional to the technological advances of 
the day. Remember, Menger utilized BOLD CAPS himself, within his book when he 
said 

       "YOU CAN RELEASE SOMTHING IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS ALREADY THERE"


    Of interest also, in Persingers research, is the ability to get people to 
see UFO's while under the influence of the electromagnetic helmet. 

   In the book "Flying Saucers: Serious Business", (C) 1966 Frank Edwards has 
as a preface the following quote:

   "Flying Saucers exist only in the imaginations of the viewers."

                        -- President Dwight D. Eisenhower
                           December 16, 1954

I ask, could this be literaly true? In light of possibilities in which such 
objects can be conjured from the dark recesses of the subjective mind on a 
consistant bases from the volunteers in research clinics, could we dismiss the 
possibility that Eisenhower was telling the truth? And could it be possible 
that the use of "imaginary" means the Government knew that they were not real? 
Could it possibily be true that the Condon report was true? Can it be, we are 
looking in the wrong place for the answers. And possibly the Government feels 
more comfortable with us thinking UFO's and aliens are responsible for the 
"intrusions"? If so, why would they wish to hide it?

 
In the book "Mind Wars" McRea then writes, on pages 116-117:

"According to Langley-Porter's Alan Gevins, who is generally cautious and 
skeptical of psychic claims, the reality may be worse. Extremely low frequency 
radiation (ELF), which the navy has proposed as a submarine communication 
system because the thousand-mile long wave forms are unobstructed by water, 
might be capable of shutting off the brain, killing everyone in 10 thousand 
square mile or larger target area. 'No one paid any attention to the biological 
effects of ELF for years," says Gevins, "because the power levels are so low. 
Then we realized that because the power levels are so low, the brain could 
mistake the outside signal for its own, mimic it [a process known as 
bioelectric entrainment], and respond when it changes.'"

"It is possible the Soviets have actually tested this technique. The microwaves 
beamed at the U.S. embassy in Moscow might have been a test. The navy is still 
investigating an even more ominous possibility -- a rash of aircraft carrier 
crashes in 1980 and 1981 might have been caused by electromagnetic waves beamed 
at incoming pilots from the Soviet spy ships tha shadow the U.S. fleet. Even a 
tiny uncertainty, electronically induced at the last critical second before an 
aircraft touches down on the pitching deck of a carrier, might cause disaster."

"I must stress that these results and speculations are tentative. Ther is no 
reason for panic, and the United States has INVESTED adequate resources to 
INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM. There is no need for a psychic Manhatten 
Project." [bold caps inserted].

                             ---------------

   Here we are told the United States has invested adequate resources to 
investigate the problem. In other words, can we then assume that a problem has 
been noted? At what level of investigation has the government undertaken in 
looking into the problem, and is it dealing with just the ELF situation? Or is 
there more? And what is the problem? Which agency, then, would be utilized? 
Could it possibly be HEW? (Health, Education and Welfare). In the past, the 
record of HEW's involvment with past experimentation seems to have been more 
then just lightly involved. By 1971 the court dockets were crowded with 
lawsuits filed on behalf of the "human guinea pigs" who were victims of 
research.

   The U.S. Congress, Senate, The Staff of the Subcommittee on Constitutional 
Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, "Individual RIghts and the Federal ROle in 
Behavior Modification", 93rd Congress, 2nd Session, Novemeber, 1974 was chaired 
by Senator Sam Ervin. It was largely ignored by the press, yet it revealed some 
interesting information. The report disclosed that thirteen projects were run 
by the Defense Department; the Department of Labor had conducted several 
experiments; the National Science Foundation conducted a "substantial amount of 
research dealing with understanding of human behavior"; even the Vetrens' 
Administration participated in psychosurgery experiments, which, in many cases, 
were nothing more than an advanced form of lobotomy.

   One of the largest supporter of "behaior research" was the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare, and its subagency the National Insitute of 
Mental Health. The subcommittee said that HEW had participated in a "very large 
number of projects dealing with the control and alteration of human behavior." 
Largest of all the supporters of behavior modification was the Law Enforcement 
Assistance Administration (LEAA) which, under the Department of Justice, funded 
hundreds of behavior modification experiments. 

In 1975 the Rockefeller Report to the President on CIA Activities was released. 
Shortly there after, the Owens family were informed that their father Dr. Frank 
Owens did not die of suicide, in 1953, but that he had been administered LSD 
without his knowledge, and his death was concealed due to "National Security". 
The Rockefeller Report also contains information which, in 1973, a total of 152 
seperate files were ordered destroyed by the CIA. It is rather interesting, as 
the type of death that Ownes suffered, is high in similarity to the death of 
General  James V. Forrestal, who also jumped to his death from a 16th story 
hospital window. It is said that Truman had quickly put the lid on the secret 
and turned the screws so tight that the general public still thinks that flying 
saucers are a joke. Lear then claims that Forrester's medical records are 
sealed to this day. Is there a possibility that Forrester could have been one 
of these "earlier" victims? Is it possible that due to this, Forrester's 
records are sealed? Why would they be sealed to this day, if it was "just a 
suicide"? Unless, of course, there is a need to coverup what CAUSED the 
suicide. Simple statements about "alien invasions" should NOT be accepted as 
being something that needs to be sealed, unless there was is a desire to hide 
the cause of death due to the interest of "National Security".

(The Owens settlement can be found in Senate S.B. 3035)

With the possibility of LSD the cause of Forrester's death, some may think it 
may have not been manufactured early enough to effect the era we are 
considering. However, it was being manufactured by Sandoz Laboratories since 
1938, and accidently ingested by Hoffman in 1943. In 1950 it was introduced to 
American Psychiatrists. These things are being brought up in order to 
demonstrate that there have been capabilities on the Government's part to 
coverup. To some, this may appear to be unrelated and very disjointed, but it 
is being related to make a point. There is a slight possibility that some of 
the things that have been "uncovered" in the past could be directly related to 
things we are trying to "uncover today". 

Remember what the OMNI article states about how easy it is to utilize tonal 
sounds, symbols or colors to put one back into such a state? How then, does 
Menger describe the encapsulation method? Is there some fact in what Menger 
states in light of current clinical research?

In the OMNI article, and other articles dealing with the abductee scenario, 
great care and concern are utilized to determin just how the experience is 
affected by audio/visual material, such as TV, the media, reading material, 
etc. But then, if we reflect upon what Menger states, what if the dissimination 
of information of contact with "our kind" has some merit? Is there some truth 
in this, and can we look at it as LEAR would like to have us believe, that we 
are being fed propoganda from various levels in order to solidify this 
acceptance? The same line of thinking which begun in the 50's continues with us 
today. Look at the following paragraphs garnered from Brad Steigers book 
"Fellowship" (C) 1988, Ivy Books, and see if the "thread" still holds true 
today, as it did back in the 50's.

Page 52 PRINCIPLES OF THE SOLAR LIGHT CENTER

1. Belief in an Infinite Creator (the All-Knowing-One, of the Space Beings) and 
in the Cosmic Christ, the Spritual heirarchy, and the Great White Brotherhood.

The message today, is the same as yesterday. Are we being fooled by the 
government itself, or some belief system which transends our political systems? 
And are these really spiritual entities, human agencies, or combination of 
both?

    As of late, certain groups have been complaining that the United States has 
been "jamming their transmissions". If this is true, then the government is 
well aware of some type of influence being exerted over our airwaves and are 
attempting to stop it. If this is true, and due to the nature of such 
possibilities, they would not wish to have the American citizens know that such 
a thing would exist. And so, they would then attempt to "jam" the frequencies 
in an effort to counteract the effect. In fact, there were, in some circles, 
threats issued, that if the government did NOT stop the "war would begin". What 
would this entail? Short circuiting of brainwave patterns to create utter 
chaos? It is indeed rather ominous to think, that such a war could be fought 
with such intensity without our even knowing what on earth is going on.


If we are being "manipulated" in any manner, is our government aware of it? 
Sometimes I wonder, although we may look back at the extremes of the McCarthy 
era, and the blacklisting of entertainers, screewriters and etc., if there 
could have been real reasoning behind the power of the media? We can now think 
of it as extremes, today, but then could there have been "hints" of concerns 
we are not aware of?

Were there or are their indications that the idealisms which "created and 
programmed" Hitler spread beyond Europe? Various writers have brought out that 
yes, indeed these thoughts were not confined to Germany and the surrounding 
immediate areas. 


"The Legacy of The Gods"
 Robert Charroux
 Translated into english (C) 1974 by Berkley Publishing Corporation
 Original (C) 1964 by Robert Laffont, Inc.

After their defeat in 1918 a few Germans, initiated into infernal occultism and 
intoxicated with racist pretensions, reorganized the Aryan society that became 
all the more secret becuase it was outside the law in all parts of the world. 
Their goal was to create a superior race; that is, a privelaged people who 
would subjegate and rule the rest of the world.

In his successful book, "The Myth of The Twentieth Century", published in 1930, 
the talented writer Alfred Rosenberg stated the laws and philosophy of the 
Aryan champions. "To rule the world," he said, "it is enough to have pure 
blood."

This new charter of the Aryan world was to be illustrated by rivers of blood, 
countless massacres, and mountains of corpses.

Actually, however, Rosenberg had not invented anything. Identical ideas had 
been professed earlier by George Grant, Gobineau, Houston, Chamberlain, and 
later, the German Ludwig Wilset, in "Origin and Prehistory of The Aryans". And 
the French historian A. Pictet, in a work titled "Migrations Primitives des 
Aryas" had announced the advent of the master race: "In an era before any 
historical record, lost in the mists of time, a race destined by Provedence to 
dominate the entire world grew little by little in its primeval cradle, 
privileged above all others by beauty of blood and gifts of intelligence."

The Thule Group was founded in 1910 by Professor Felix Niedner. Beginning in 
1919, some outstanding adepts -- Baron Ungern von Sternberg, Karl Haushofer, a 
disciple of Guderjieff, the writer Deitrich Eckart  -- gave it a new impetus 
and an emblem: the swastika, symbol of evolution, the rotation of the stars 
around the pole, and the creation of fire among the Hindus. (The swastika is 
actually a universal sign found amoung all peoples. It is carved on a stone 
lamp in the Madeleine cave, the tablets of Glozel, the stones of Moulin Piat, 
and the prehistoric ramparts of Mississippi, and it appears in the inscription 
on the Newton Stone in Scotland.)

In his book L'Europe Paienne du Vingtieme Siecle," the historian Pierre Mariel 
writes that Deitrich Echart was Adolf Hitler's initiator and brought him into 
the Thule group in 1922. 

Hitler was in great financial difficulties and may even have been a homeless 
vagrant, but he was consumed with ambition, rancor, and sincere, frenzied 
idalism. He was also somewhat clairvoyant; he served as a medium for the 
conspiracy, which bacame increasingly enveloped in the mists of a dubious 
occultism.

At the same time, similar movements were devloping on the European continent. 
In London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome there was clandestine publications 
containing an odd mixture of anarchism, spiritualism, "traditional research," 
and eroticism.

In about 1920 the Revue Balitque appeared in France. It examined the problem 
of the direct descendants of the Hyperborean ancestors: the Lithuanians, whose 
writing has so many points in common with Sanskrit.

The magazine Les Polaires (Paris, 1921) had the ambition of resucitating the 
old myth of Hyperborea, but this kind of writing floursihed above all in 
Germany, with Niedner's "Altnordische Dichtung und Pros," Dietrich Echart's 
"Auf gut Deutch," and "Die Hanuseen Zeitung," published by the magician Eric 
Jan Van Hanussen, the man who is said to have replaced Hitler as the medium of 
the Thule Group, and who later became his semiofficial astrologer.

The ORDENSBURGER

Beginning in 1934, the Thule Group became a powerful secret society whose name 
was not to be known to the public or even candidates for admission. The latter, 
before their intiation, were given to understand that the organization was the 
secret Teutonic Order.

This secret order had, of course, no connection with the real Teutonic Order, 
which still exists in Portugal and the Netherlands. Under the name of the 
Knights of Poseidon (still the ideas of knighthood and the western ocean of 
Atlantis), it has devoted itself to underseas adventure, and is surely in 
comunication with the THule Group. It has been said the Knights of Poseidon 
reprenst the temporal power of the German secret army, while the Thule Group is 
its spiritual power. This may be true.

There were three aspects of the education given in the Ordensburger: military, 
similar to modern military and police academies; political; and occult, similar 
to the doctines of Gurdjieff. (George Ivanovich Gurdjieff [1868-1949], born in 
the Caucasus, was both an adventurer and an enlightened occultist. Whether he 
was a miracle-worker, a secret agent, or simply a charlatan, he proagated in 
Europe and America strange, murky, and fascinating doctrines that troubled many 
weak minds. Perhaps he had a certain genious, but if so he was never able to 
express it in his books, which are unreadable, inane, and incomprehensible. He 
did, however, influence certain spiritualistic sects.)

In a Rhineland forest, amid tall firs, stands the white impressive Vogelsang 
castle which was the Ordensburg No. 1 of the THule Goup, with the main bureau 
of what would now be called psychological warfare.

                               -------------

The THULE Group itself, was rather active in world political affairs also. 
Below is a small excerpt to demonstrate this from a recognized writter outside 
of the UFO circls.


"The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler"
 by Robert Payne
 Popular Library Paper Back Edition
 (C) 1973  Page 125


   The reaction set in swiftly, as the extreme right gatherd its forces. The 
headquarers of the reaction was the Hotel Vierjahreszeiten, where several 
floors were given over to the THule Society, ostensibly a literary club devoted 
to the study of Nordic culture but in fact a secret political organization 
devoted to violent anti-Semitism and rule by an aristocratic elite. The name of 
the organization derived from ultima THule, the unknonw northern land believed 
to be the original home of the German race. The society had been founded during 
the war by Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff, whose aristocratic prensions reposed 
on imaginary foundations. His real name was Rudolf Glauer, and he was the son 
of a railroad engineer: he was more aristocratic than the aristocrats. He had 
ingratiated himself into Munich society, large sums of monery were at this 
disposal, and many of the most influential people in Munich were his disciples. 
The symbol of the Thule Society was a swastika with a dagger enclosed in laurel 
leaves.

Thule agents had penetrated the government; they were especially adept at 
foriegn documents and assembling cashes of arms and ammunition; they had 
powerful ties with the Freikorps, or Free Corps, the private armies led by 
rabid rightists, usually army officers supported by rich industrailists and 
they had begun to work among the industrial proletariat, especially among the 
railwaymen, because they realized that a successful counterrevolution could be 
brought about only by controling the means of transportaion. They were also 
working without much success on the Munich garrison troops, who continued to 
sit on the fence, observing the turmoil around them with extraordinary 
indifference.

And here, a glimps at early beginnings in creating a "perfect race".

From Page 23 , Footnote, The Nazi Doctors (C) 1986 by Robert Jay Lifton

Fritz Lenz, a German physician-geneticist advocate of sterilization (later a 
leading idealogue in the Nazi progrom of "racial hygiene"), could, in 1923, 
berate his countrymen for thier backwardness in the domain of sterilzation as 
compared with the United States. Lenz complained that provisions in the Weimar 
Constitution (prohibiting the infliction of bodily alterations on human beings) 
prevented widespread use of vasectomy techniques; that Germany had nothing to 
match the eugenics research institutions in England and the United States (for 
instance, that at Cold SPring Harbor, New York, led by Charles B. Davenport and 
funded by the Carnegie Instituion in Washington and by Mary Harriman); and that 
Germany had no equivalent to the American laws prohibiting marriage both for 
people suffering from such conditions as epilepsy or mental retardation, and 
between people of different races. Lenz criticized America only for focusing 
too generally on preserving the "white race" instead of specifically on the 
"Nordic race" -- yet was convinced that the "next round in the thousand year 
fight for the life of the Nordic race will probably be fought in America." That 
single reservation suggests the early German focus on a specific racial entity, 
the "Nordic" or "Aryan race," however unsupported by existing knowledge. 


There had been plenty of racial-eugenic passion in the United States, impulses 
to sterilize large numbers of criminals and mental patients out of fear of 
"national degenration" and of threat to the health of "the civilized races," 
who were seen to be "biologically plunging downward." Associated with the 
American eugenics movemnet was a biomedical vision whose exten is suggested by 
the following quotation from a 1923 book by A. E. Wiggam: "The first warning 
which biology gives to statesmanship is that the advanced races of mankind are 
going backward; ... that civilization, as you have so far administered it, is 
self-destructive; that civilization always destroyst the man that builds it; 
that your vast efforts to improve man's lot, instead of imporving man, are 
hastening the hour of his destruction". *

* Footnote: In a 1932 study of the sterilization movements in the United 
States, J.P. Landman spoke of "alarmist eugenics" and of "over zealous and over 
ardent eugenicists" who "regard the socially inadequate persons, i.e., the 
feeble-minded, the epileptics, the meantally diseased, the blind, the deformed 
and the crminals as inimical to the human race ... [because] these peoples 
perpetuate their deficiencies and thus threaten the quality of the ensuing 
generations. It should be our aim to exterminate these undesirables, they 
contend, since a nation must defend itself against national degeneration as 
much as against the external foreign enemy."

                             -------------

Can we assume that these influences are truly "alien" or "supernatural 
intelligences"? Or can we really, and with great dare, question if in fact it 
is a resurected belief which is posing itself for a final strike? If we can 
remove the politics of the situation, and reflect upon the zeal in which 
religion has moved the political formations of the world we live in, reflect 
upon the many mysteries that concluded with the end of World War II, and can 
look beyond Hitler, maybe something is their "in the air" waging war over the 
minds of men. One can disolve political institutions, but as various belief 
systems in the world have proven time immorial, it is difficult to destroy the 
belief in and the practice of it. The belief itself can still survive 
irregardless of what political boundries it may reside in. Including the USSR.

There is a great trend in regards to world viewpoints of Hitler, and the 
stigmatism of World War II. We cannot believe that such an individual was 
spawned naturally from the genetic pools of humanity. We cannot believe that he 
did not accomplish all these things alone. And we cannot dare believe that the 
thinking patterns of that era were also revelent here in the United States. 
Theologins would prefer to claim Hitler was Demon possessed, not laying claim 
to the errors of prior religious influences which spawned the rebellion. And 
could it be due to this, we skirt around valid questions? Nearly every book 
written about in regards to UFO's, at some point mention the Nazi's and their 
going "underground" to continue on. To think of the possibilities of this being 
so, one must remove the viewpoint of a political column, and think about the 
belief system which drove these onwards. These things just do not die. It may 
make us feel uncomfortable to think that during the 20's, the United States was 
the "leader" in eugenics which inspired Germany to increase it's own efforts 
until it reached the point of biological experimental sciences, eugenics and 
genocide. It may also make us feel uncomfortable to think that the "next 
struggle" could be here in the United States. But do we have the courage to 
examine it carefully? 

To what extent did this belief infiltrate other parts of the world?  Could 
there have possibly been some measure of truth in Menger's claims? Or is this 
all just fabrication? He cut there hair, got them prepared to send out 
into the world. He would show them where the water supplies were, where the 
schools were. He said they didn't need any legal documents to remain in the 
country. This took up so much of his time, he couldn't keep up with his 
signpainter's business. 

Could there have been Ahnenerbe type experimentation in other parts of the 
world, including the United States? What is so special about the ages of 30-40 
years old? And why has it been said more then once that the "children are very 
important"? Was there an actual attempt to extend the "national heritage" to 
Germans outside of Germany and Europe? We, perhaps cannot rationalize the use 
of science to further a belief system. The intellect, however exists, and has 
existed for centuries, in which reasoning can lead men to do these things in 
order to appease their god. 

These are but a small portion of the various questions that arrise. Perhaps, 
these "threads" have very little real meaning. Yet, on the other hand, they 
could have real meaning. The complexities which could be built out of this, are 
indeed great. But, as with all things, they must be viewed with balance. 

If there is interest in this, perhaps I will create another file. Please take 
note, however, if indeed we are now being put to the test, today as it was 
yesterday, it is imperative to test all "spirits" (or, things in the air).
