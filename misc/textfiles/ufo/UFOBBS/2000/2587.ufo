The following information comes from phone interviews I conducted with "John" on 11/19/93 and John Ford of the Long Island UFO Network.
At approximately 11 p.m. on Friday November 19, I received a call from a person identifying himself as "John", an electrical engineer that has worked with the government on UFO analysis teams. John was calling me by request of John Ford of the Long Island UFO Network. "John" is the only name he gave me. It may not even be his first name. He was very nervous about the whole subject. He told me Government agency that was in charge of the UFO investigations was the Naval Office of Foreign Technology. Other agencies such as the NSA, FBI, CIA, and others would like to get jurisdiction in these matters but the Navy's Office of Foreign Technology are the only ones with the proper equipment to handle such investigations.
The first investigation he told me about was about an incident on Long Island. Using the same system the Government uses to track the various satellites and pieces of space debris orbiting the planet, a large object was discovered heading towards Earth. At first it was thought to be a meteor, but when it entered orbit around the planet it became obvious it was something of far greater importance. The craft's orbit began to decay, and as it entered the atmosphere it began to break up. "John" told me film was shot of the object breaking up. As the object was breaking up a number of smaller crafts, evidently constructed for atmospheric flight, were released. One of these crashed relatively intact in Southhaven Park in Shirley, New York on Long Island. The crash occurred just after 7:00 p.m. November 24, 1992. Due to the fires caused by the crash, local fire departments initially responded. Not long after the crash, a team from Brookhaven National Laboratory responded and took command of the operation. The craft was sprayed with a chemical foam used to lower radiation levels. When the craft attempted to lift-off, it exploded.
Among the remains of the craft were by parts of aliens. That is to say creatures that never evolved on this planet. One of the volunteer firemen had with him an 8 millimeter camera and taped some of what he saw that night. What he supposedly captured on tape were pieces of the craft and shots of the aliens. This tape was confiscated by the government. A copy of this tape found it's way into the possession of the Long Island UFO Network who did extensive analysis of the tape and have brought forth clear shots of the aliens. "John", told me the pieces of the craft were probably taken to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. Brookhaven has facilities to store and deal with radiation "hot" materials. After Brookhaven the materials were probably taken to a facility in Ohio. The clean up of the site by the government appears to have been rather sloppy. After the park was reopened to the public, members of LIUFON found metal fragments and a radiation suit in the park.
"John's" part in the investigation was an analysis of audio recordings that were made. In investigations such as this, the government keeps the majority of the people involved unaware of the total picture that's being dealt with. "John" was only given tapes to analyze for sounds. Two of the tapes he received had no sounds he could find. The last tape he got to analyze had someone saying, "Touch it and we'll have to take you to the hospital." "John" was dropped from the project after he arranged to get a copy of the video portions of the tape from another researcher on the team in exchange for his audio tapes. "John's" information of the crash comes from contacts he made while working on the project and information he gained from their computer system.
An earlier project he was involved with occurred in the early 80's. At the time I talked to him, "John" wouldn't tell me an exact location. He  only said it was in the tri-state area. As for the date, he  only remembered it was either 1982 or 1983. He was flown into the location by helicopter. The entire area of this crash was covered by a ;large tent like structure. air was pumped in. Some type of inferred shield was used to protect the entire facility from detection by spy satellites. He was there to see if anything there was used as electrical components. He was able to leave with a piece of metal from the site. When the piece was analyzed it found to conduct electricity, be non-ferrous, non-metallic, and a carbon dioxide laser was needed to cut it. They did find it consisted of carbon and crystalline and was twelve layers thick.. The lab that tested it was amazed at the item and continued to ask what it was. "John" didn't tell them.
"John" is very nervous about what he has seen and found out. He told me helicopters painted black and gray have flown over his house, he has seen cars with government plates near his home, and he believes his phone is being tapped. He told me he used his knowledge as an electrical engineer to route his call to me through a satellite. He had been tapping into the computers being used by the NOFT but recently the passwords have been changed. Due to this he feels something very big is brewing.
