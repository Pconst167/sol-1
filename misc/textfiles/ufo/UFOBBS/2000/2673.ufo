    UFO TRAUMA 

      Alice  Bryant  remembers her first time well.  She was  driving  from 
    Denver  to Farmington when,  along the Del Norte Pass,  she saw  bright 
    lights and thought there had been an accident. She felt euphoric rather 
    than  worried and drove on,  reaching her destination hours before  she 
    logically could have. 
     
      What had happened?  Bryant is convinced today she was in the presence 
    of "Dimension Travelers,"  or aliens. For Bryant, a  67-year old writer 
    who lives in Alto,  the realization was an easy one,  another adventure 
    on a lifelong spiritual quest.  But she knew that for others,  seeing a 
    UFO  and meeting its inhabitants might be disturbing,  even  traumatic. 
    Where  do you turn after scaly creatures have scopped you up,   prodded 
    your body and deposited you back on Earth? 
     
      Bryant and her daughter,  Linda Seebach,  who holds a master's degree 
    in  social work and has had "onboard"  experiences with aliens,   wrote 
    "Healing  Shattered Reality:  Understanding Contactee Trauma"  to  help 
    those  who  think  they have been contacted by aliens deal  with  their 
    confusion. 
     
      "This  is  really the first self-help book for people who  have  been 
    contact,"   says Bryant. "We hope to reach those who are sitting on the 
    fence, who don't know what happened, don't understand what happened and 
    don't know what to do with it." 
     
      Her basic advice for "contactees"  is to find time to mediate or pray 
    and   seek  out  a  support  group  of  people  who  describe   similar 
    experiences. When it is accepted instead of denied,  Bryant and Seebach 
    believe  the experience of being in the presence of aliens can enrich a 
    person's life. 
      
      The potential audience for Bryant and Seebach's book is immense, they 
    believe.  "There's a possibility,"  says Bryant,  "that we're all being 
    contacted."
