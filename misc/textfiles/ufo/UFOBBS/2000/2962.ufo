Case Description:
                                                            
A Webster county woman was driving alone on a rural road 5 miles
south of marshfield, MO, when her attention was drawn to a large
red light in the northwest sky at just above treetop level.  She
pulled over to the side of the road and stopped, watching the
light.  As she stopped, the light became discernible as an object
and dropped slowly behind some trees and out of sight.  She
described the object as oval in shape, approximately 30 feet by
60 feet, glowing red and noiseless.  The object was less than
one-quarter of a mile away from the witness.
