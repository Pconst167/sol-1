    Strangely enough,  my first encounter with a alien beings was at age 5, 
    that was 30  years ago and I still remember as if it were yesterday.  I 
    had always been a loner as a child. At that age, no sisters or brothers 
    and  parents  that were too busy to pay attention to me,   therefore  I 
    spent a lot of time in my room.  Alone.  That is except for Foob.  Foob 
    had  been around for as long as I could remember.  Whenever I wanted  a 
    play  mate  he showed up.  Foob was about my size  and  talked  without 
    moving  his  mouth.   He  had  taught me to talk  like  that  too.   To 
    concentrate real hard on what I wanted to say and then send it.  It was 
    neat.   Foob  hadn't been out in the sun much,  as his skin was a  pale 
    green.  I  remember he had long fingers and when his hands were down to 
    his side they almost touched his knees. But I really hadn't thought too 
    much about Foob being a strange looking little boy. Just that he was my 
    friend and was always there when I called for him to play. We would sit 
    in  my room playing with cars and dolls for hours upon end.   Until  of 
    course  mom or dad came into the room and he would just  disappear.   I 
    asked  him  once why mom and dad couldn't see and talk with him and  he 
    told  me cause they could never learn to use their minds to talk.  Foob 
    had  strange eyes,  the kind of eyes you could stare into and it looked 
    like  dark pools of water.  They had great big centers and kinda yellow 
    around the dark spots, sorta like a cat, a black cat with yellow eyes. 
     
    Foob told me he was from,  up there, pointing to the sky.  That's where 
    he  lived.  He told me of things that were to come and the changes that 
    had  to occur now,  at this time,  (when I was five)  and that I really 
    could help people. If I wanted to. Cause Foob had always been there for 
    me,  I told him I would. And the next night,  when Foob came he told me 
    he was going to take me in his spaceship and let me see it.  Well I had 
    never been in one before and I gladly accepted the offer,  knowing that 
    Foob would be with me.  One minute he was holding my hand and the  next 
    minute we were inside of a white metallic room.  The walls extended  to 
    the  ceiling not in a straight manner but going inward at the  top.   I 
    laughed  at  the funny shaped wall and he told me it was the inside  of 
    the ship.  We walked down a long corridor into another room where a bed 
    was.  Foob helped me climb up on the bed and told me to lay perfect- ly 
    still.   It seems that I drifted off to sleep,  and looking around  the 
    room,   I  saw several other Foobs,  all having a wee bit of difference 
    about them and dressed like doctors.  Foob told me to lay on my stomach 
    on  the bed and I did as was directed.  He told me I could watch  if  I 
    wanted and I quickly said yes.  I  withdrew from the bed and stood next 
    to Foob, looking at the bed. I saw on the bed a girl, older, much older 
    probably  in  her  teens  or early 20's with  long  brown  hair.   Foob 
    explained to me that was me in a few years after I grew up.  I  watched 
    looking over the girl fascinated that it could possibly be me.  But how 
    could  it be,  I  was here and I wasn't that old?  Then the other foobs 
    were going around the girl,  looking at her,  examining her,  when this 
    big  round  some-  thing came out of the  ceiling  protruding  downward 
    toward  the  girl.  It was wide at the top and narrow  at  the  bottom. 
    Toward  the bottom of the circular thing was a needle.  The needle  was 
    positioned  over  the girl's neck and was slowing moving to  enter  the 
    neck area. 
     
    I  woke in my bed the next morning,  feeling pretty tired and when down 
    stairs  to get breakfast.  After we ate breakfast,  mom was combing  my 
    hair  and  noticed a rash on the back of my neck.  "What have you  been 
    into?"  she asked. "Nothing mom!" was my replied.  She brought out this 
    pink solution and rubbed it on my neck.

    UPDATE: 
     
    I now know the solution as being Calamine lotion. I have never lost the 
    rash on the back of my neck. At times when I concentrate on UFO related 
    things  the  rash  deepens  to a darker red color  and  also  takes  on 
    different   shapes  and  sizes  according  to  the  intensity  of   the 
    discussion.  This has been verified and looked at by several  connected 
    with the UFO field. 
     
    As  far  as  the  neck  itself goes,  I  have  been  to  two  different 
    chiropractors and BOTH have told me that my neck was TOTALLY  inverted, 
    the  wrong  way.   Both have tried to straightened  it  out  that  only 
    proceeding  in giving me severe headaches.  So nevertheless I've  never 
    let  them  complete  the bone breaking process of my neck  bones.   The 
    latest doctor, also, approximately 1989/90  told me the I must have had 
    an accident when I was VERY young.  Since I had already been told  that 
    one  by the first doctor,  I  relayed to this one that my mother said I 
    had  "never"   been in ANY accident of any kind,  not even  a  bump  or 
    jarring that could have caused the damage.  The last one told me that I 
    had  a  deteriorating disk in my neck that meant that if I was  in  any 
    kind  of collision and hit from the rear I would "probably"  be  killed 
    instantly  and that was why his insistence on readjusting my neck.   By 
    the look of the Xray,  it's possible that the area he refers  to  as  a 
    degenerating disk could possibly be  something  else.  Could this be my 
    implant? Who knows!
