SUBJECT: MUFON REMOVAL OF BOARD MEMBER                       FILE: UFO2456





Donald M. Ware was MUFON's Eastern Regional Director.  (MUFON State
Directors, who report to the Regional Director, are in charge of a
particular state and have Assistant State Directors reporting to them.
In some larger areas the heirarchy has an extra level or two.  The
Eastern Region is composed of the states:  ME, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI, NY,
PA, NJ, DE, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL, PR, AND VI.)

Here's the announcement:
------------------------

REMOVAL OF BOARD MEMBER

        The MUFON Board of Directors has the authority to elect people
to the Board through a mail ballot. Conversely, the same authority may
be applied to the removal of present Board members who continually defy
the corporate goals and objectives of the Mutual UFO Network to the
detriment of MUFON's scientific credibility. In an unprecedented
election, Donald M. Ware was voted to be removed from the Board
effective June 1, 1993. This action stemmed from continued advisory
statements by members of the Executive Committee to Don that he refrain
from mailing books to Board members and Eastern Regional State Directors
espousing "channeling" philosophies and techniques over a two-year
period.

        As a result of Mr. Ware's fascination with channeling as a means
of communicating with aliens or entities, he invited Dr. Norma
Milanovich, a professed channeler, to attend the closed MUFON
"Face-to-Face" meeting in Albuquerque, NM in July 1992 and allowed her
to read her channeled answers to the questions posed for discussion by
the participants. Much to the shock and dismay of MUFON officers
attending, Dr. Milanovich read the answers from a computer print-out
which she claims was obtained from "Master Kuthumi" during a 33-minute
period the previous night.

        Walter Andrus gave Donald Ware an opportunity to resign from the
Board. After he refused to resign, a vote by the Board of Directors was
felt to be the fairest way of determining his status. Since it has taken
25 years to establish MUFON's scientific credibility, it seems unwise to
allow one individual's unscientific interests to be taken as
representative of those of MUFON. The results from the mail ballot are
as follows: 15 (65.2%) voted yes to remove; four (17.4%) voted no to
removal, and four directors abstained as the third choice.

        MUFON is indebted to Don for the outstanding job he performed as
a Field Investigator, State Section Director, State Director and later
as MUFON's Eastern Regional Director. Any member of MUFON may study any
of the fringe aspects of Ufology such as channeling and the New Age
concepts, however, MUFON does not endorse these fringe aspects and is
strictly against any member's attempt to proselytize other MUFON
members. Channelers have produced no scientific evidence, thus far, that
is applicable to resolving the UFO phenomenon. The removal of Mr. Ware
from the Board was a difficult and painful decision and he will be
sorely missed.

        Eastern Region State Directors should discontinue sending UFO
sighting reports to Mr. Ware and instead mail them to Jerold "Ron"
Johnson, MUFON Deputy Director of Investigations, 12700 Silver Creek,
Austin, TX 78727, until such time as a new Eastern Regional Director is
elected.
