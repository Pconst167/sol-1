Excerpt from the tape:

THE MIND GAME & PATTERNS

You have heard us say that all is true according to the perception,
and [that] reality is far beyond what you can conceive of. There is
a vastness that is ever growing and expanding. There have been on
your planet quite a few humanities who have figured out the rules
and have learned a little bit better than other humanities how to
create, how to bring about what they are wanting and how to become
manipulators, rulers, and designers of the game themselves.

Your planet started off with a certain plan in mind. That plan was
to design a new world where there would be great exchanges of
information. The great computer-like mind connected a crystal
network of information that would beam out in this galaxy as a
storehouse perhaps. It was an exchange center. A world was designed
that was beautiful because this information was going to be held in
the cells of each and every creature and molecule of consciousness
that existed here. Consciousness was going to be endowed within all
things.

In the vast expansion of creation, many different forms of sentient
beings exist. They are all playing what you would call the mind
game. The Prime Creator, First Cause, was, or so it seems, the
originator of the mind game.

The Prime Creator thought itself into a reflected state and moved so
that it could see itself so that it could prove to itself it
existed. It created outside of itself. And so the game has gone.
Even the Prime Creator continuously surprises itself with the new
rules and the new possibilities of this substance that has been
endowed with consciousness.

The forms of this substance continuously mutate and change and even
the smallest portion of being has new potentials. Within this mind
game that all of existence plays, the rules constantly change. That
is part of the game.

What is occurring on the planet at this time is that you are being
instructed and given information because the rules have changed. It
is time for large numbers of humanity to call on their own innate
knowing, to bring about their own beautification of development, to
step wisely and to learn to play with all of the abilities.

You have heard us [say] to become aware of what you present to
yourselves. Every portion of the material that is outside of you
determines how you are going to feel and how you are going to set
the parameters of your experience and what you are going to allow
yourselves to put within your lives. What you see is determined by
what you believe is possible. You are in a double bind so to speak,
for you wish to change what you believe to be possible about
yourselves and yet you do not quite know how to change what you are
perceiving.

Codings are inside of each and every one of you. [They] are being
reactivated by some of those ancient creators who brought your
planet into being when they were playing with their own godhood.
There have been many struggles over the territory of this, your
Earth Sphere, Terra. Many have come here and reigned and have
utilized the rules of the game and developed societies according to
how they wished humanities to perceive.

You have been very often the product of a few individuals designing
the mass humanity experience. Once again you are involved in this.
This time, you are being told that you can be liberated through your
own thinking and through your own perceptive abilities. We wish to
push you further into this so that you can truly realize what your
boundaries are and realize that every portion is part of the game.

QUESTION: Do these creators compete against each other and have
their creations make war on each other?

PLEIADIANS: There have been competitions. There have been vast
amounts of information kept from the public for eons. There have
been humanities who have known the capabilities of mankind. You find
yourself attempting to expand your capabilities, yet you fight and
deny that you even have them.

The time has come for you to tap into this. Those greater humanities
who you have called gods, those more expanded beings, have indeed
made their own rules for the mind game. Within those rules they
designed societies where mankind was not encouraged to a state of
independence. Think about the history of your world for the last
2,000 of your years and look at the different societies. What did
these societies do? How many encouraged freedom? How many encouraged
independence? How many societies work with the idea of suppression?

You have heard us say that you live in the United States, the land
of the free, or so you think. We are not here to start a revolution,
we are here to expand what you believe to be possible and to assist
you in your own growth and to turn you ultimately to yourselves and
your own answers. There is nothing more to believe in than yourself.

When you believe in a God that is so outside of yourself you are not
acknowledging the God that is within you, that has been your
birthright. This is a major state of awareness for each and every
one of you to move into the holiness of your own being.

Each and every one of you are all that you need to believe in. When
you believe in yourself, expand what you think you are, you begin to
learn the rules of the great mind game and then you are up there
with the big guys.

QUESTION: I have been in a massive state of confusion, going back
and forth from one belief system to another.

PLEIADIANS: When you are about to make a change, in general, you
will go through a bit of disorientation so that you can come to a
greater understanding of yourself. Also the disorientation has to do
with the releasing of old behavior, with the relinquishing of
control, because wherever you are, in whatever state of development,
there is a certain amount of control.

The control forms the boundaries of what you think is safe behavior,
and safe avenues to traverse. So when you are about to make a change
you have to allow that to come down and reevaluate what you think is
okay for you as humanities to do. And you become impatient and you
cannot understand why it has taken you a long period of time to move
from one state to another. It is quite simple. You are not making
the decision.

The ideas that you are sending out to yourself are not clear. It may
seem to you that it is clear. You do not understand how intricate
your thoughts are and you think you make one statement and this is
going to create and you can forget about it and make all the other
statements that are going to uncreate it. Only you do not hear
those. Your thoughts are like fog and they seep out from you into
all forms. And they always seek to expand, to be out there in
territory. So, when you are not certain about what you are wanting,
you are not giving out a one-lined direction.

The energies at this time are becoming really very powerful, very
highly charged. You are learning that there is a certain intensity
of commitment that is going to be needed to lift yourself into
higher states of consciousness. All of your thoughts count. If all
of your thoughts are not lined up to your greatest intention, you
are not going to get there, not in completeness. You all need to
learn how to trust yourselves, how to have a greater love for
yourselves and, of course, much more joy.

Learn to utilize the greater vehicles that you have to keep you
within a balance so that you can move at these great speeds. When
you do not have balance you are not going to move forward with
acceleration. You will crash.

Many of you have bumped the heads and bumped the psyches because you
have gone after something that you thought that you wanted and have
not understood the rules of the game. Or you have sabotaged your own
rule making by thinking that you were not powerful enough, or
looking to others as being such great humanities, or thinking that
you were not worthy of what you were after.The kicks you get out of
talking about it [are more exciting] than it would be to manifest
it.

It is most interesting. What is happening on your planet at this
time really makes it an "in" place to be. If there were a People
magazine for the cosmos, the Earth Sphere Terra would be on the
cover. And you all are stars. So, live it up. Be alive because that
is what it is all about. Wherever you go and whatever state of
consciousness you are in, there is going to be stuff to learn. As
you learn how to utilize the rules here, then you would be changing
the game for all of the other players. As you all become awake, you
will be bucking the system. And you will be showing that the rules
indeed have changed and that even the most minute forms of
consciousness have figured out that they are like the gods.

QUESTION: What kind of freedom do we need to seek?

PLEIADIANS: When you are seeking freedom it is a freedom from
expectations. Many humanities, just as you, have figured that out
because word has been passed down on your planet and secret
societies have known for eons many of the rules, so to speak. Many
who learned how to play the games kept freedom as a precious food
from reach of the majority of humanity.

They called it by mysterious names and they said that humanity would
not know what to do with this if they have this. And so they kept it
for themselves. So, when we say to you to seek freedom, it is
freedom from anything that is going to define and suppress any of
your ability that would limit you.

Stay within that freedom, move outward in all that you would affect
within your life experience and your reality to extend that freedom
outward to others as well. There are no limitations.

QUESTION: How far is it possible to jump from the level we are now?

PLEIADIANS: A tremendous amount can be figured out from here. In a
very short period of time, the large majority of you will have made
a gigantic leap. Within one, perhaps two of your years, there [are]
going to be abilities to perceive in vastly different fashions.

Even now you are learning how to expand as you have seeded yourself
with light and as you begin to listen to the internal self. Many of
you are too intellectual with this. You are all "up here" and you
are all afraid to be "down here" because this is where you are going
to feel. You are going to connect your feeling and you are going to
develop a compassion. And then you would move into these realms.

They are not thinking realms. They are realms of the highest
connection of spirituality. And they would keep you tethered to
great beings of light who would communicate with you as they are
building light bridges to you at this time. You have no idea of what
is possible. Your mind cannot conceive of what is.possible for your
lifetimes.

We have recently spoken that something that is going to be and is
available for all of you is what we call the immortality of your
being the ability to extend life and to stop your nonsense of
labeling a programmed degeneration of the body. That is part of the
game.

That is a flexible rule. Why do you determine that you are getting
older? Why do you determine that the body loses with age? Because a
certain sector of society passed on a rule of the game. Someone
wanted to have power and make money and make up a portion of the
game that was called health.

Everything is the game and you buy into every portion of the game.
We [get] you very stirred up so that you won't be buying anyone's
game but your own. You can learn to work with one another for
support to make up the rules of your own game and then you will set
things flying. You are unlimited beings. That is the great joy that
you are experiencing. This is why you have all come here. To
participate in that. To remember it.

Many humanities on your planet are going through times of great
difficulty right now because energies are changing and there are
certain beliefs that are smacking them in the face. You have heard
us say that electromagnetic energy has completely changed on your
planet and all has been sped up within the cosmos because of the
movement of your universe into the new area of space.

You are being charged by new particles of existence. This is
bringing about the shift in consciousness. It is this that makes all
things different, that makes all things possible now. This is what
is ringing out within your souls to satisfy and to describe and many
who you study and who you read about are all telling you the same
thing. They may use different words.

All you need to do is have the lights begin to go off in your head.
It does not matter whose words say them to you for you have all the
information stored within you. What you are merely doing is exposing
yourself to certain triggers that you have set up in the outside
world to bring about the activation of certain patterns within you.
You do not have to get into a big sweat about the whole thing, you
know. You are working towards it. You are only a few steps away from
certain amounts of great changes. You will be awed by those and you
will be excited and then you will move into boredom once again and
you will be wishing for new abilities. You are moving quickly now.

Think about what you have done in a few of your years. Think about
when you all were at the beginning of [the 1980's] what you knew,
how you felt about yourselves, what was possible. And think about
where you were one year ago and what you know now. You are
definitely moving.

QUESTION: What's the difference between the old rules and new rules?

PLEIADIANS: There existed in what you would call biblical times,
certain entities that came to your planet that were playing. They
knew the rules were that if you created and if you sent out certain
ideas you could get masses of consciousness to follow this action.
So these entities came to your planet and they affected cultures.
They played with the alteration of your DNA and formed new men out
of the basic Earth stock that existed here at different times. These
entities sojourned and are written about in your Bible. They
affected mankind through the ways that you are presently feeling the
results of. The old rules were that this was a territory for what
you would call certain skylords.

These skylords made the rules. The rules were that humanities would
worship those that were in the sky and that they would develop all
sorts of expression of this worship. They would be given an
endowment of themselves but they would not be given the complete
information because then, who would they play with? There were other
skylords who wanted these humanities to have a decent game to be
playing in. And so there has been a challenge on your Earth Sphere
Terra as to the type of information that has come in to allow these
humanities to perceive what they can be. The old rules were that the
large majority of humanities were not given the understanding of who
they were. They were kept in ignorance. They were kept in darkness.
They were kept in submission. You were kept from ultimately
understanding who you were.

The new rules are that all is allowed. You are being blown wide open
so to speak. The gates have been opened and it is fine for you to
know your ultimate experience with creation.

Do you know who changed those rules? You did. After sojourning here
for thousands of times, you figured it out. This time was designed
for you so you could bring about what it is that you have been after
from the beginning.

One of the main rules, the one that you all are attempting to figure
out and put into being is the idea of thought manifestation that you
are a result of your thoughts. That is the one that is most
important for you to learn at this moment. Not to wait for great
beings to come from the sky to save you. You argue for your
limitations. You hold onto them. You clutch them dearly like little
dollies that you played with when you were young.

QUESTION: What about the dilemma of getting to know yourself and not
liking what you see?

PLEIADIANS: It is an excellent point the dilemma of getting to know
oneself, which comes with developing self-awareness and self-esteem,
and not liking what one sees. Change it. What you are seeing is only
your judgment anyway. You all love to call yourselves right or
wrong. "I am beautiful today," and the next day, "I am what the cat
dragged in." You do this to yourselves back and for, all the time.
Why judge it?

You are learning. You are on your journey and you are feeling that
certain expressions of behavior and experience give you
exhilarations and others make you want to turn your head. When you
are finding this within yourself you are allowing yourself to
develop along a pathway. If you are finding that there is a portion
of yourself that you do not like, allow yourself to love that
portion and to release it. If you don't like a part of yourself then
let it go.

Utilize the rules and make a new you. Change your behavior. Believe
that you can change a portion of yourself. But don't release it out
of hatred or anger. Allow yourself to realize that whatever it is
that you are perceiving that you did not particularly approve of,
you birthed it into being. Let it go. Do not tether it to yourself
any longer.

It is not that you are going to always love every portion of
yourself for you are teaching yourselves and you are bound to run
across something that is going to get your attention. It is a
message to gather more information and ultimately give you more
compassion for others. So, be more easy on yourselves.

Until you love yourself, you are not going to experience love from
anywhere else. This light energy that is being sent to you and this
light energy that permeates existence, is made up of love. It is a
substance of being that permeates all things. If your scientists
were to break down the particles of the most minute aspect of
existence to find out what makes everything go and everything tick,
it is love. It's what connects you. It is what keeps you alive.

Start with yourselves. Realize that in this game you picked
yourselves. You picked yourselves to be the player that you would
move around in this aspect of existence.

When you don't accept responsibility for the player that you picked,
you deny your participation in the game. And so you are moved across
the board of life without any control, always looking to connect
with love and never realizing that in order to connect with love you
must turn on your own light, which is turned on with self-love. When
you turn on your own light by loving yourself because you have
selected yourselves, and by not judging yourself, then the game
completely changes. Then you don't go looking for love. You are it.

When you are love, and when you move with love, all you bring back
to yourself is love because you are like a beacon and you draw it
all to yourself. When you do not love yourself and you go out
looking for love, you cannot even see it because you do not have the
electromagnetic capacity to even recognize it, to even draw it to
yourself.

Remember that you, yourselves, are your primary tools for enjoyment
and experience. It is you, yourselves, who are your greatest
teachers. So live, for you have it all within you. Everything .
else, when you discover this, will unfold before you in the most
glorious magic of being.

many of us came here from the Pleiades to participate in the new
experiment of Earth. The Pleiadians are here as ambassadors to help
Earth through her transition from the third to the fourth dimension
and to assist each of us in our personal endeavors of awakening,
remembering and knowing.
