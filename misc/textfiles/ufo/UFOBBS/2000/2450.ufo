A 90-foot UFO chased a news jet for two harrowing minutes during a cross-
country flight from Phoenix to Washington and we've got the photographs to 
prove it!

The glowing, saucer shaped craft literally materialized out of thin air a few 
hundred yards off our starboard side as NEWSAIR I, our company jet, cruised 
east over the Painted desert.

The starship proceeded to perform "impossible" in-flight maneuvers as three 
reporters and a photographer, including this correspondent, watched.

The UFO then dropped back into position behind us and flew a few feet off the 
tail of our jet.

Seconds later, it veered off to the right, stopped dead in the air - and 
vanished in a burst of light. "I've been a pilot for over 17 years and I've 
never seen anything even remotely similar to this," said pilot Thomas Dale, 
who monitored the UFO's bizarre flight pattern from the cockpit.

"It was 9:02 p.m., and we were flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet, when we 
noticed a 90-foot object that had its own brilliant, metallic light flying 
beside our jet. Even stranger, just a split second later, I realized it had 
changed positions and was now flying over our heads.

"The maneuver was so sudden that I couldn't decide if I was losing perspective 
or if the UFO really had changed positions that quickly.

"About that time I heard the reporters shouting in the back of the plane. Just 
then, the UFO shot out a mile or so to our left and literally stopped in 
midair."

Washington correspondent Mick Mann confirmed Dale's report - and picked up the 
story. "I'm not really sure how to describe this, but as the UFO 'sat' there 
in the sky, the craft began to dissipate until it looked like a cloud of 
sparkling white dots,"he said.

"A few seconds later, it began to glow brightly, and as it did, the craft took 
shape again. Then it began a rapid zigzag descent, which left a trail of 
bright, glowing material in its wake.

"It flew over us, ahead of us, beside us and behind us like a cat playing with 
a mouse. It was oval, actually shaped like a saucer, and intermittently gave 
off white or green light.

"The only distinguishing characteristic was a single design on the belly of 
the ship. To my eye, it looked like a backward 'K.' After flying all around 
us, it dropped back behind the tail of our jet. Moments later, it shot off to 
our right, stopped in midair and - BOOM! - vanished in a burst of light," said 
Mann.

"We must've been followed fro at least 20 miles," the ppilot said. "I know 
what I saw. I know I wasn't dreaming. But what that thing was doing was 
physically impossible. It was the damnedest thing I've ever seen."

Roving News correspondent Rex Wolfe, a former UFO skeptic, said the encounter 
left him reeling "in shock and disbelief."

"When everything started going down, I thought I was losing my sanity," he 
said. "Thoughts raced through my mind. I started thingking about all the 
people I've interviewed who claim to have had close encounters with UFOs. For 
the first time, I realized that these people weren't crazy - they were just 
like me. Through no fault of their own, they each had had an experience nobody 
can explain."

Photographer Tex Albright captured the UFO on film. He called the drama "the 
high point of my life and, in a way, the end of my career. There's no way to 
top pictures like these," he said. "The question now is: 'Where do I go from 
here?'"

Aviation officials didn't spot the UFO on radar and ther is no way for 
authorities to corrborate what the News team saw. " We have photographs but so 
do other people who have had close encounters with UFOs," said Albright. "As 
of now, we can't prove anything at all."
