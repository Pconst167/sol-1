  REPEATER IN TORONTO CE-1 REFUSES HYPNOSIS
  ========================================= (-by Lawrence Fenwick)

        A close encounter with two UFOs occurred in Toronto, Ont.,
  Canada in the early morning hours of March 11, 1988. This was
  less than 1/2 mile from Lake Ontario, one of the Great Lakes of
  North America and in a major metropolitan urban area. One of the
  observers, Deborah Theaker, later told investigators that this was
  only the latest in a series of UFO events that had seemingly
  followed her around wherever she lived in Canada.

         CUFORN was alerted to the report when Deborah and friend
  Darren Boyce called Metropolitan Toronto Police, who referred them
  to Downsview Air Force Base. Staff Corporal McKay had CUFORN's
  phone number and gave it to the couple who called us.

         Deborah, 25, is an actress an scriptwriter for SCTV (Second
  City Television), a famous TV comedy show. She and Darren had just
  arrived back in Toronto from Darren's native Australia, where they
  had just watched the Channel 7 special about the Nullabor Plains
  CE-2 of January 20, 1988. Darren, an electrician, 24, was a skeptic
  until the night in question.

  Flickering Lights
  -----------------

         Here is what happened in Deborah's own words: "It was
  approximately 1:10 or 1:20am on Friday morning that the incident
  occurred. I was watching television, sitting on the sofa, when I
  noticed lights out of the corner of my eye. Something seemed
  strange about it and so I looked out the window to my left which
  was uncovered and gave a clear, unobstructed view. I saw a very
  large oblong object surrounded by flickering lights. There were
  definitely red and white lights, but I'm not sure whether there was
  another colour or not. There might have been blue lights as well,
  but I'm not exactly certain. I am uncertain of the time, but I
  would think that I saw it around 1:20 or 1:30 at the very latest."

         "There was a large, luminous "headlight" in the sky over
  the trees across the street to the right. It was pulsing and I
  felt that it was communicating with the larger object. The larger
  metallic object moved towards the light. But I don't remember
  seeing it move there", Deborah said.

  Woke Up Friend
  --------------

         "I phoned my sister and she instructed me to wake Darren
  up as he was asleep in the other room. We both looked out the
  window at this point, I could no longer see the bright "headlight".
  I thought that the object moved slowly behind the trees on the
  street opposite Coe Hill Drive. It was either moving west or
  descending slowly. After a brief period of time, we lost sight of
  the object. Darren suggested that we phone the police. They arrived
  within approximately 20 minutes. It was just after 2:20am when they
  knocked on our door."

         Curiously enough, Deborah had a dream the previous night
  which she felt was a warning that "something was coming to get me".
  She called her mother in Sidney, British Columbia, 2000 miles away,
  that night, and told her "a UFO is coming to get me."

  Something Hovering
  ------------------

         Darren described his part in the observation: "Deborah woke
  me up shouting that there was a UFO outside the window. I went and
  had a look and could see something hovering beyond the line of
  houses across the street. While it was too dark to see the outline
  of the object, it appeared to be pulsing. It slowly moved away from
  us to the west. All the lights were on all the time, but each light
  would individually pulse bright. The pulse would take about one
  second to complete one revolution."

         That night was a clear one, with no wind and few stars
  visible in the glare of the city lights. There are high tension
  power lines in the area. No sound was heard. The objects were about
  20 degrees above the horizon.

         In our interview with Deborah, she said she was "scared. I
  felt like they were looking at me and I felt like I knew who they
  were and they were coming back."

         Investigators Harry Tokarz and Joe Muskat did what the two
  police officers had done on the night of the event -- they
  carefully looked at the area where the UFOs were seen -- a small
  park and a children's playground. No traces were found, nor was
  there any damage to the trees.

         Muskat and Tokarz personally investigated the case on March
  12. The next day, Tokarz spoke to Police Constable Wilkinson who
  had been summoned alond with Police Constable Sonsini. The officer
  said Deborah was "hysterical but sensible." The officer said a
  Staff Sargeant had gone to the area first, but on checking police
  records, there was no mention of any such prior check by a Staff
  Sargeant.

  Hearing Defect
  --------------

         Deborah recently had visited an audiologist who told her
  she had a congenital defect in both ears. She cannot hear low
  frequency sounds. Yet she could recall no ear problems in her past,
  except for the odd ear-ache.

         CUFORN investigators Tokarz and Muskat discovered in their
  interview with Deborah that she is a "repeater". She was born in
  Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Her father was Mayor of the town of
  Esterhazy in that Canadian province. Her mother was a nurse. She
  has one younger brother, Kent and one sister, Shelley.

         Deborah said that when she was three years old, she saw
  what she called then "the Easter Bunny". She remembered its eyes
  as being bright but otherwise normal. That would have been in 1966.
  At age seven, she and Shelley saw a circular object in their home
  town. In 1976, at age 13, she did not menstruate for four months.
  She did not go to her family doctor or tell her parents. She did
  tell CUFORN that at the time, she felt "something was taken from
  me." She has what Darren says appears to be a Caesarian birth scar,
  although she has never been pregnant.

  Looked Like Beans
  -----------------

         She said, when she was 13, she woke up one morning feeling
  sore all over. When she looked at her bed, she saw what looked like
  dried-up kidney beans covering the bed of her brother who slept in
  the twin bed next to her. She thought he had eaten some beans and
  had vomited in his sleep. He had not eaten beans, however. She
  slept through the night and was not awakened by anything that could
  have caused the beans to appear.

         She said that one night when she was at summer camp at
  Round Lake, Saskatchewan, she and other campers saw a formation
  of UFOs. The camp was Camp O'Neill. She recalled one other camper,
  Roger Keyes, and that the head of the camp, who was a Minister,
  also saw the object. The minister said he would report the sighting
  to someone, but, as far as Deborah can recall, no authorities were
  ever notified about the encounter. The year was 1978.

         We also found out that when Deborah lived in Saskatoon, in
  1982, she and her brother Kent observed a UFO on a summer night.
  She recalled that she could not account for a period of time
  amounting to an hour and a half.

         Not only is Deborah a repeater, but the element of missing
  time may mean that she was abducted. She has noticed in the past
  three years or so, that she has a hollowed out cut or scoop mark
  on her left shoulder.

  Fear Of Hypnosis
  ----------------

         All these stories remain just stories at this time, as,
  after some discussion with Tokarz, she got as far as agreeing to
  visit our consultant in regressive hypnosis, Dr. David Gotlib. And
  that is as far as it got, as after an interview with the doctor,
  Deborah said she was afraid to undergo hypnosis. She said that an
  amateur hypnotist had unsuccessfully tried to hypnotize her years
  ago. She used that and her fear of what she might find out as her
  reason for declining to pursue regressive hypnosis. Hypnosis would
  give some scientific credibility to CUFORN's investigation and
  could relieve her fear or the trauma she may have undergone as a
  result of an abduction by humanoids. Unless she changes her mind,
  we will never know for sure what happened to her over the years.



  GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SEES UFO WITH BLACK PIPES
  HOVERING OUTSIDE HER 44TH FLOOR APT. WINDOW IN MID-TOWN TORONTO
  ================================================================
                                              (-by Lawrence Fenwick)

         A lady whom we will call "Shelley Wells" was watching
  television while laying in bed at 7pm on Friday, March 18, 1988,
  when out of the corner of her eye she saw a strange object
  hovering outsider her 44th floor apartment in the Thorncliffe Park
  area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

         Interviewed by Joe Muskat and Harry Tokarz of CUFORN, she
  described the object as a charcoal grey metallic device about
  15-20 feet in diameter with black struts hanging from each end.
  She said she was "astounded and ran to the window". The UFO
  seemingly reacted to her movement by first moving slowly eastwards,
  then swiftly ascending to the clouds. She called the two appendages
  "pipes" which were about five inches long. The UFO had no seams
  and she could not hear any sound as her window was closed and there
  was no balcony on that side of the building, so she could not go
  out to observe more closely. She estimated the UFO was no more than
  ten feet from the window which faces north.

         She estimated the total observation lasted 15 seconds. All
  her neighbors were either away at the time or were elderly and no
  one else reported seeing anything.

         Ms. Wells told us that it was dusk, overcast and cool. The
  UFO had sharp edges. The area is near high tension power lines and
  a hydro-electric substation. She waited two months before calling
  the police about the sighting. They referred her to Downsview AFB
  who gave her CUFORN's number. Her disbelief in what she saw made
  her wait to report the sighting.

         Shelley is a former Air Canada stewardess and now works
  as Director of Communications for one of the Ministries of the
  Ontario Government in Toronto. She is 43, and has a male friend,
  Lawrence Sherman, Jr., who is an architect former U.S. Air Force
  officer who was based in the Pacific. Sherman's late father was
  Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Staff at the Pentagon and a
  friend of the late U.S. Air Force General NATHAN TWINING of MJ12.
  Colonel Lawrence Sherman, Sr. was also the Director of U.S.A.F.
  Intelligence for the Pacific.
