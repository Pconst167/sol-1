     David/Moderator: David > ga
     David/the other 1: ok...
     TIM GORDON: g
     David/the other 1: There's been some rethinking over Conference meeting 
             | day/times?  Is there a preference...
     Ron     | I'm ready to go GA
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: ready
     David/the other 1: Sundays are good for me but most evenings (cept 
             | wednesdays) are alright...GA
     Jason Reed: !
     David/Moderator: Jason > ga
     Jason Reed: ok...
             | later in the day would be better for me GA
     Jeff Morrow: !
     David/Moderator: Has anybody got any preferances as to day and times? ga
             | Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok...
             | Being on the west coast, I would like a later time, if 
             | possible...
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: !
     Ron     | !
     Jeff Morrow: I know this may not be convenient for the people on the east 
             | coast, so i'm flexible....
             | Sundays are ok with me.  GA
     David/Moderator: George > GA
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: Im flexiable also GA
     David/Moderator: Ron > GA
     Ron     | ok...
             | Either earlier OR later is OK, but earlier would be better...
             | I am on the East Coast. GA
     David/Moderator: Ok....
             | I would suggest that everybody send me a message as to what 
             | date/times you prefer, then I'll work it out from there.  Sound 
             | ok? ga
     Joe Balsamo: David
     Jeff Morrow: <ok>
     Ron     | <ok>
     MIKE HART: !GReat
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > ga
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: ok
     Teri Wheeler: ok
     Joe Balsamo: What is the currently agreed upon time that everyone is 
             | saying OK to?
     David/Moderator: Nothing yet, we were discuss this date and time, any 
             | suggestions from your end? ga
     Joe Balsamo: It's 2:00 right now, right in the middle of the day for 
             | me...I don't know...Of course I may not be in touch again 'till 
             | mid August!
     David/Moderator: Planning on leaving for somewhere, say Cygnius 5? ga
     Joe Balsamo: Atlanta
     Jeff Morrow: <yhay's close>
     David/the other 1: ?
     David/Moderator: Ahhh yes, of course, forgive me!  Ok lets get started 
             | folks....
     Jeff Morrow: >yhay's = that's>
     David/Moderator: David > ga
     David/the other 1: ok...
             | Two questions.  Did I see a posting that a software package had 
             | been found...
             | ...for the newsletter?  Also how was the conference...thumbnail 
             | sketch...GA
     David/Moderator: Well...
             | I did find a software package for the newsletter that works on 
             | the PC, it is excellant, and FREE!!!!  As for the symposium....
             | I thought it was great.  I learned a lot and met alot of nice 
             | people.  It did get dry though in places....
             | Joe, you have anything you want to say about it> Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | The symposium was excellent.  I learned much from Stan Friedman 
             | who is an expert on the Corona crash and the MJ-12 papers...
             | also, the info on the 14 witnessed abduction presented by Budd 
             | Hopkins is going to, IMHO, make or break UFOlogy...finally, the 
             | stuff on the mr. Ed Walters case presented by Jeff...
             | ntating as well. ga
     David/the other 1: ?
     David/Moderator: Anyone have any specific questions about the symposium?
             | David > ga
     David/the other 1: ok...
             | How was the database idea rcvd?
     David/Moderator: Well, from those I talked with they liked the idea, 
             | though I did not have the chance to talk to Friedman or 
             | anyone....
             | else big about it.  Joe did you mention it to anyone? Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: David...
             | No, I didn't think that it was my place, you being the official 
             | rep for the New Age/UFOlogy section. ga
     David/Moderator: Ok... but now your a big wig too!  <g> .....
             | I was thinking, everybody, of drafting a letter up that we 
             | could send, as a group, to the UFO organizations, and to ....
             | researchers like Hopkins, Vallee, Friedman, etc., explaing what 
             | we're doing and trying to get there supports.  Any comments? ga
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: ?
     David/the other 1: !
     David/Moderator: George > ga
     Jeff Morrow: !
     GEORGE D. HOPPER: Yeah...I think you may get some flake...other ufo 
             | organizations arent very co-operative...as a rule. ga
     David/Moderator: Good point...
             | David > ga
     Ron     | ?
     David/the other 1: ok...still a good idea...At the very least it 
             | documents attempts and responses.
             | ...ga
     David/Moderator: Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok...
             | I'm going to get on my soap box for a minute here (groans from 
             | all)...
             | Before we can ask for help or information from other parties...
             | we have to decide what it is we are doing with this project....
             | I'm in favor of trying to increase the amount of KNOWLEDGE 
             | about the UFO...
     David/the other 1: !
     Jeff Morrow: phenomena, not just keep a large catalog of rehashed data.  
             | Having said that, it is no small matter...
             | to address the mechanics of putting that formula in place.  I 
             | think the...
             | kind of things Jason has been doing with the K2 reports is 
             | going...
             | in the right direction.  Comments?  GA
     David/Moderator: Well...
             | I like the fact that Vallee mentioned in his paper for the 
             | symposium how a UFO database should be formed, and Ron here....
     MIKE HART: !
     David/Moderator: has made some interesting comments as well.  What we 
             | need, what all UFO researchers need, is a central point from 
             | which they...
             | can gather and input data...
             | Ron > ga
     Ron     | ok...
             | My turn on the soapbox!...
             | I think that two issues need to be addressed right away...
             | (1) Who will use it, i.e., who are the targeted users...
             | (2) What are the information sources 
             | ...
             | ga
     Jeff Morrow: !
     Jason Reed: !
     Ron     | !
     David/Moderator: David > ga
     David/the other 1: I pass my comment to Mike. Gotta mull this a bit.
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Mike > ga
     MIKE HART: ok...
             | I think that everyone agrees that a database you have been 
             | talking...
             | about is a great idea and you should, we should all lend our 
             | support...
             | just keep in mind that you need to push the issue with all 
             | the...
             | parties interested as I have seen, for 10 years now, this 
             | idea...
             | discussed in the usual circles, with no results...ga
     David/Moderator: Mike...
             | Thanks for the support, and you are very correct in what your 
             | saying!...
             | Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok...
             | I agree that Ron has two very valid points.  The information 
             | sources...
             | is an issue that must be addressed before anything else.  I 
             | think that...
             | much of the information available today is not information in 
             | the...
             | sense that it provides no verifyable evidence, or testable 
             | claims....
             | How do we sort that issue out with the resources we have.  I 
             | think...
             | collectively we have the intelligence, but what about the time 
             | and ...
             | financial resources.   Once we have sorted out the data source 
             | problem...
             | it will be more clear who can benefit from this data.  GA
     David/Moderator: Jason > ga
     Jason Reed: One thing...do *we* have the resources and manpower to do a 
             | good ...
             | job with both a NL and a dbase or should we concentrate on 
             | one...
             | and make sure we do it right...thoughts?  GA
     Deb Carlen: !
     David/Moderator: Jason,
             | Good point, IMHO I would think the database would take 
             | priority, but I am open to suggestions....
             | Ron > ga
     Ron     | ok... I lost my train of thought since the subject has changed 
             | some...
             | We need to pin down the following:
             | 1. Who will use it
             | 2. what will they use it for and how
             | 3. Where does the information come from
             | 4. And how will the informaiton be selected (i.e. EVERYTHING or 
             | just...
             | some specific things...
             | ...
             | From my point of view, as a serious UFO skeptic, I would 
             | benefit greeatlly....
             | from having a sort of quick & easy reference library...
     Teri Wheeler: I
     Ron     | maybe not necessarily a case-by-case database.
             | ...
             | Maybe the database should be thought of as a catalog of sourts. 
             | GA
     David/Moderator: Deb > ga,,,, Ron I'll get mack with you in a sec.
     Deb Carlen: Just wanted to say that we missed youat the NL seminar in St. 
             | Louis ga
     David/Moderator: Nobody called me about it! hint hint!
     Deb Carlen: Hmmmm.  Thought I gave you the date and time at the last 
             | CO...?
     David/Moderator: About the database and Ron's comments....
             | Who will use it?  Anybody interested, including serious UFO 
             | researchers...
             | What is it for...To have in one place all UFO evidence, instead 
             | of it being spread out over such a large area, AND...
             | for once to have ALL the evidence available for people to 
             | puruse...
     Ron     | !
     Jeff Morrow: !
     David/Moderator: Where will it come from, that's a good questions...How 
             | is it selected, another good question....
             | Ron > ga
     Ron     | ok... Good long range goal, indeed...
             | But, as i have been finding in going through some online 
             | searches...
             | lately, there are MASSIVE amounts of data...
             | The question really is WHERE DO WE START ?  GA
     David/Moderator: That's why we're here!    Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok..
             | Well, where do we start?  Do we go to MUFON and say *Excuse me 
             | guys,...
             | we are a group of people on Compuserve who want to get this UFO 
             | data ...
     Ron     | !
     Jeff Morrow: sorted out, would you please give us a copy of all your 
             | files?...
             | We then wait until a truck backs up at our collective door and 
             | dumps this stuff?...
             | How do we start?  Is there some way we can begin to gather data 
             | independent...
             | of the other sources, in case they are slow or reluctant to 
             | cooperate?  GA
     David/Moderator: Ok...
             | I thought along the same lines, let us collect independant data 
             | and inlcude into a database, while working with the MUFON and...
             | the others....
             | Deb > ga
     Deb Carlen: Nothing from here.  Must've been an earlier !
     David/Moderator: OK....Ron > ga
     Ron     | Comment request withdrawn, i need to think a little more    GA
     David/Moderator: Ok.. now MY turn!!....
             | All UFO organizations, including MUFON and CUFOS have there own 
             | extensive UFO computer databases....
     Ron     | ?
     David/Moderator: the problem is they don't allow most people to access 
             | them, or they charge a 'nominal' fee.  What is needed, as 
             | Vallee pointed out...
             | is a central clearing house sort of, where ALL this data can be 
             | gathered into one place.  Its time to start sharing...
             | and I think that as a group we can get it all started!....
             | Ron > ga
     Ron     | Would it be possible to have a "gateway" from CIS into the 
             | MUFON and
             | CUFOS databases. A subscription, if you want to callit that? GA
     David/Moderator: Yes...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: sortof, we can set up a gateway, easily done, but like 
             | CUFOS they charge like $1500 to access there system....
             | as for MUFON, they won't get back with me on any details, 
             | excpet they said that if I submit a formal request for...
             | information, they will search their systems for it....
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | Where is the money going to come from for this?  Even 
             | incidental expenses such as copies, searches, phone calls, etc. 
             | etc.  This is 
             | why CUFOS and MUFON charge money...
             | onest with you, unless we really pare this thing down, it's 
             | just not practical, IMHO. ga
     Ron     | !
     David/Moderator: Ron > ga
     Ron     | ok...
             | Joes got a good point...
             | Is it practical or possible to ask for sort of a "shareware" 
             | fee for
             | downloading of data from the libraries, or does that only work
             | for software. GA
     David/Moderator: Ok...
             | I suppose a shareware fee system could be set up, maybe, but 
             | will the cost be at first?  I mean if we all took what 
             | information...
     Ron     | !
     David/Moderator: each of uses, and put that in the DB, it would take 
             | awhile for that to all get setup, later on then the money issue 
             | may come ...
             | into play, but I don't see how it really does right now.  
             | Comments? ga
             | Ron > ga
     Jeff Morrow: !
     Ron     | I also wanted to agree with Joe on "paring it down" at first...
             | It looks like there's likely to only be at most 5 or 6 people...
     Deb Carlen: !!!
     Ron     | working on this thing at first ....
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok...
             | I think the money issue has to be adressed at the sta
             | [C
             | rt...
             | If we are going to acquire data, it is going to cost us.  Do we 
             | know how much?...
             | If we want to get going, we are going to need some form of 
             | capital or other...
             | financing, or else we are going to be really limited in what we 
             | can...
             | accomplish.  If we cannot meet the other UFO organizations on 
             | some sort...
             | of equal footing when we ask for help or data, we are going to 
             | be really...
             | limited in the amount of clout we can weild.  GA
     David/Moderator: Point taken....
             | but I think that if really start on the thing and get people to 
             | see that we are serious, and really TRYING to do something....
             | then they will fall in later and help us out.  Especially if we 
             | can get Vallee or Friedman on out side!...
             | Deb > ga
     Deb Carlen: Excuse my barging in from the business point of view but PR 
             | and articles/infor regarding your efforts re DB will generate 
             | costs, and all 
     Jeff Morrow: !
     Ron     | !
     Deb Carlen: the people here will have online costs if hthey help you 
             | (sorry msg got cut off) GA
             | !
             | Get a grant or other funding now and you'll have enormouly more 
             | credibility.
     David/Moderator: Thats true Deb, let me think that one over a sec....
             | Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok...
             | I think we have started in a manner of speaking.  Kason has 
             | taken this K2...
             | thing through a logical progression. He has seen a report 
             | alleging certain...
             | things, and has investigated them.  One thing he has uncovered, 
             | is the...
             | NASA heliport.  This has added to our knowledge, and perhaps 
             | ultimately...
             | to the explanation of activity in that area.  In any event, we 
             | now know...
             | more about K2 than we did.  This series of reports and 
             | investigations...
             | can form the first bit of available data in the database.  
             | Comments?  GA
     David/Moderator: Excellant!....
             | We have started, in a way, now lets take it a step further 
             | though and put it in a form besides just messages!....
     MIKE HART: !
     Jeff Morrow: <sorry Jason, Imispelled your name>
     David/Moderator: AND, set it up in such a way so as other information, 
             | other research can be added!...
             | Ron > ga   
     Jeff Morrow: <great!>
     Ron     | ok... I think we're looking at a spare-time, voluntary effort 
             | for the foreseable future, until we have a "proof of concept"...
     MIKE HART: Z
     Ron     | and that means a concept... Jeff is onto something and it kind 
             | of
             | goes back to what I said earlier about creating a depository of
             | reference resources, and using an online DB to catalog the 
             | holding...
             | I have to dissapear for about 5 mintues, but will be back  GA
     David/Moderator: Deb > ga
     Jason Reed: ?
     Deb Carlen: That's it from me.  Enjoyed it guys.  Good luck.
     David/Moderator: Thanks for joining us!    Mike/Irene > ga
     IRENE HART: Sorry my call waiting cut me off GA all...
     David/Moderator: Jason > GA
     Jason Reed: is the db a complete reference in itself or an index to other 
             | files...
             | that contain more complete references? ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
             | !
     David/Moderator: Jason,...
             | I was thinking a index of sorts, with limited descriptions, 
             | that would point the way to other more detailed files and/or 
             | sources....
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Pass, you answered what I was going to say.
     David/Moderator: Ok...
     Tony    | HELLO! Just came back from Convocation! Fully charged!
     David/Moderator: Mike have you got anything you'd like to add about all 
             | this? ga
     Mike    | ok...
             | Yes, not to change the subject you are discussing, but I have 
             | to leave and...
             | I will be in contact with you later as I am a professional fund 
             | raiser...
             | and will start a project, if you desire to raise some capital 
             | for this DB...
             | Please get back to me about later on tonight or when 
             | convenient...Mike GA
     David/Moderator: Thank Mike, will DO!!!!
             | Anybody else? ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | Have we come to any kind of decision, yet, as to what we are 
             | going to do, specifically?  IF so, perhaps we should divide up 
             | the 
             | work...
     Ron     | !
     Joe Balsamo: ind of from the old school of plan the work, divide and 
             | conquer, then work the plan. GA
     David/Moderator: Ron > ga
     Ron     | ok...
             | I am collecting data, of sorts, already, that you and joe 
             | already ...
             | know about. It's not a database of UFO sightings, but I'd 
             | describe...
             | it as building a collection of reference resources....
             | basically in the same manner in which I approach things I do...
             | professionally. 
             | ...
             | For example, the book list. After that, I plan to compile a 
             | bibliography of government reports (if any) and ...
             | a list of UFO periodicals and magazines...
             | ...
             | It's too early, from a "research" point of view, to start 
             | building
             | a case database...
             | except as a prototype to show to prospective financers...
             | ....
             | What I don't know is what I should do with all that stuff. GA
     David/Moderator: Well...
             | I think the data you are gathering right now would be very 
             | valuable to others when it is finished.  As for the database...
             | well is it not feasible for each of us to transcribe on the 
             | computer what case information we each have...
             | i.e. books, peridicals, journals, and basically start things 
             | from there?  ga
             | Anybody?
     Ron     | ! 
     David/Moderator: Ron > ga
     Jeff Morrow: !
     Ron     | Ok... It's a place to start. We got to start somewhere until 
             | we...
             | can flesh out a viable concept...
             | I will have further comments in a moment, but need to think a 
             | few minutes first GA
     David/Moderator: Jeff > ga
     Jeff Morrow: ok..
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Jeff Morrow: I have to go in a moment, but if there is anything I can do 
             | to assist in the preparation...
     Ron     | !
     Jeff Morrow: of the database structure, please let me know.   I have 
             | fairly substabntial computer resources, and programming...
             | knowledge in a number of languages (C, C++, FORTRAN, Lisp, SQL, 
             | Actor)....
             | I will be away for about a week, and will give this more 
             | thought.  If you ...
             | don't hear from me after that you will know the rattlesnakes 
             | got me.  GA
     David/Moderator: Thanks Jeff..
     Jason Reed: bye jeff
     David/Moderator: I will keep you posted on what happens and what we 
             | decide, I appreciate your help and support!...
             | Joe > ga
     Jeff Morrow: <thanks guys, Bye>
     Joe Balsamo: OK, I have several comments and suggestions, so bear with 
             | me...
     David/Moderator: Bye
     Joe Balsamo: First, i think that we need to start really organizing these 
             | COs to take better advantage of the time.  We need to come up 
             | with an 
             | agenda and we need to stick to it and try and get some things 
             | accomplished...
             | Secondly, it is impossible, for you, David, to do all of this 
             | yourself.  You need to start being a deligator of tasks and not 
             | try 
             | and accomplish everything yourself...
             | ON the database itself, I agree with what has been said, we 
             | need to decide WHAT it is for and WHO will use it, as Ron 
             | stated...
             | it is a terrible waste of everyone's good time and money to 
             | simply *do* a database for the sake of doing one.  Let's really 
             | pin 
             | down what it is going to be used for.  What types of 
             | statistical correlations are we interested in...
             | what trends are we looking for, what hypotheses are we 
             | attempting to test...
             | Finally, we really need to narrow down a small subset of data 
             | and go after that.  NOT based on what books people happen to 
             | own, but 
             | really try and fit our data collection into what we are trying 
             | to accomplish...
             | the computer part is going to be the EASIEST part of all.  
             | Deciding what the purpose of the project, the general thesis if 
             | you 
             | will, is where the work is going to come in. GA Ron
     Ron     | ok...this might take a page or two ...
             | Oh, BTW, is it my turn, David ?
             | GA
     David/Moderator: Yes, ga
     Ron     | thank you...
             | I dearly would love to be able to get my hands on a 
             | comprehesive UFO...
             | database, but it seems that it is not practical to go through 
             | MUFON or...
             | CUFOS for that. Financially practical. ...
             | SO, build our own...
             | But, as I said before, there are huge amounts of data to deal 
             | with...
             | and it will take years for just 5 or 6 people to get it to a 
             | useful...
             | point working in spare time on a volunteer basis...
             | ...
             | I think that we start small, but keep future growth in mind...
             | ...
             | For the foreseeable future...
             | the WHO is going to amount to Forum users. Regulars, temps, and 
             | visitors...
             | Maybe 3 dozen people in all.
             | But, as word gets around and as the collection grows, more 
             | people should start using it. I think we have to start building 
             | a reference
             | collection and see what happens. What kind of access rates we 
             | get.
             | ....
             | The WHAT is probably, at first, going to be the typical sorts 
             | of ...
             | forum uses. ...
             | Specifically, it seems to occur rather frequently that someone 
             | new
             | comes in (remember, I'm new myself, basically)...
             | and wants to argue a case, or insists on having references at 
             | hand...
             | Joe- you remember *****... (deleted by moderator)
             | SO, the "hot" issues are going to be the current ones...
     Joe Balsamo: <smile>
     Jason Reed: !
     Ron     | And that leads back to Jeff's point earlier about reports on...
             | current cases...
             | I'm monopolizing, so GA and I'll continue later..GA
     David/Moderator: Jason > ga
     Jason Reed: Sorry, but I've got to go...catch you all in the forums.
     David/Moderator: Glad you could make it Jason, keep in touch!
     Teri Wheeler: !
     David/Moderator: Teri > ga
     Teri Wheeler: I have to go also, but wanted to let you know that you have 
             | my
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Teri Wheeler: support...even if I am new!  I'm not sure what I have to 
             | offer, but I
             | ...would be glad to help. Bye for now. ga
     Joe Balsamo: bye
     David/Moderator: Teri, thanks for your support, and I'm glad your 
             | interested.  Keep an eye on the messages and I'll see you later!
             | Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: Yes...
             | Actually, I need to get going as well, perhaps we should 
             | continue this discussion next week...
             | Is there any thing we can do or talk about to kind of close 
             | this meeting in a manner that we can be thinking about for next 
             | time? ga
     Ron     | !
     David/Moderator: Ron, any suggestions from you? ga
     Ron     | yes...
             | I was leading up to the following proposal:...
             | As "hot" topics occur, someone (or anyone) uploads a short...
             | document with the facts and references...
             | Those will eventually form a foundation for a comprehensive 
             | DB...
             | and in the meantime, they can be cataloged...
             | In effect, I think I'm talking about a newsletter, that is 
             | cataloged...
             | and eventually turns into a database.  GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: So perhaps we should work with the newsletter first, 
             | then expand out later?   Joe > ga
     Joe Balsamo: As a start, I think that is an excellent idea and much more 
             | 'doable' at this time...
     Ron     | !
     Joe Balsamo: I think that what Ron is saying is that we'd have a master 
             | index that would crossreference to individual articles...
             | for example, this Don Ecker video deal.  Someone could have 
             | uploaded a short paper on what it was all about, and it would 
             | be 
             | cataloged in the index. ga
     David/Moderator: Ron > ga
     Ron     | Yes... Joe caught my idea....
             | David, I think with Joe gone, you and I are the only one's 
             | left...
     Joe Balsamo: I'm still here, but I need to get going
     Ron     | SO, we have lots of things to think about for next CO. I'd 
             | suggest...
     Ron     | having one NEXT SUNDAY to keep things moving...I am done, if we
             | have to clear out of here now. GA
     David/Moderator: Alright, everyone think on whats been said, we'll 
             | message with each other this week, and meet back here next 
             | Sunday...OK?
     Ron     | OK
     Joe Balsamo: ok
