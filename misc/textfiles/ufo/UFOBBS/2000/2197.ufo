-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Memorandum for Mr. Ladd  
 
    Mr. ________ also discussed this matter with Colonel L. H. Forney of   
MID.  Colonel Forney indicated that it was his attitude that inasmuch as   
it has been established that the flying disks are not the result of any    
Army or Navy experiments, the matter is of interest to the FBI.  He   
stated that he was of the opinion that the Bureau, if at all possible,
should accede to General Schulgen's request. 
 
SWR:AJB   
 
ADDENDUM  
 
I would recommend that we advise the Army that the Bureau does not believe 
it should go into these investigations, it being noted that a great bulk   
of those alleged discs reported found have been pranks.  It is not    
believed that the Bureau would accomplish anything by going into these
investigations.
 
                                          DML
 
(Clyde Tolson) - I think we should do this.  (Dated 7/15)   
 
(J. Edgar Hoover) - I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist 
upon full access to discs recovered.  For instance in the SW case the Army 
grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.

(B) FLYING DISCS -- The Bureau, at the request of the Army Air Force  
intelligence, has agreed to cooperate in the investigation of flying  
discs.  The Air Forces have confidentially advised that it is possible to  
release three or more discs in odd numbers, attached together by a wire,   
from an airplane in high altitudes and that these discs would obtain  
tremendous speed in their descent and would descend to the earth in an
arc.  The Army Air Forces Intelligence has also indicated some concern
that the reported sightings might have been made by subversive   
individuals for the purpose of creating a mass hysteria.    
 
(AUTHORIZATION TO INVESTIGATE)
 
7-30-47   
BUREAU BULLETIN NO. 42          -2-
Series 1947    
 
    You should investigate each instance which is brought to your
attention of a sighting of a flying disc in order to ascertain whether or  
not it is a bonifide sighting, an imaginary one or a prank.  You should    
also bear in mind that individuals might report seeing flying discs for    
various reasons.  It is conceivable that an individual might be desirous   
of seeking personal publicity, causing hysteria, or playing a prank.  
 
    The Bureau should be notified immediately by teletype of all reported  
sightings and the results of your inquiries.  In instances where the  
report appears to have merit, the teletype should be followed by a letter  
to the Bureau containing in detail the results of your inquiries.  The
Army Air Forces have asured the Bureau complete cooperating in these  
matters and in any instances where they fail to make information 
available to you or make the recovered discs available for your  
examination, it should promptly be brought to the attention of the    
Bureau.   
 
    Any information you develop in connection with these discs should be   
promptly brought to the attention of the Army through your usual liason    
channels.

Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
 
TO      :  DIRECTOR FBI                         DATE:  January 10, 1949    
FROM    :  SAC KNOXVILLE 
SUBJECT : "FLYING SAUCERS" OBSERVED OVER
          OAK RIDGE AREA 
          INTERNAL SECURITY - X    
 
          There are being submitted herewith two photographs of reputedly  
"flying saucers" which were seen at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, sometime during  
July of 1947.  All of the information contained in this letter was    
received from George Rateman, Resident Engineer, Air Material Command,
United States Army, who is the principal army technician at the Nuclear    
Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft Research Center at Oak Ridge,   
Tennessee.
 
    Mr. Rateman advised that the attached photographs were taken by ______ 
in July of 1947.  He stated that interview with _______ revealed that he   
had been snapping photographs of his family in front of his residence at   
218 Illinois Avenue, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, late in the afternoon, when he  
looked into the sky and observed the vapor trail as exhibited by the  
photograph numbered "1."  __________ stated that he took a snap of this    
trail, was winding the film to the next number, when he looked into the    
sky and observed the ball of fire as shown in photograph 2.  _______ made  
these photographs available to reporters of the Knoxville News-Sentinel    
and a story concerning them was run in that paper; however, as shown by    
the photostatic copy of the newspaper clipping, which is also being   
submitted herewith to the Bureau, the print was very indistinct; the news  
story did not contain any factual information; and it was regarded    
generally by the public at the time as a possible trick.    
 
    Later, it was learned by Rateman and _________ that _________ had 
made several copies of this photograph and had distributed them among his  
aquaintances at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  Upon ___________ finding that the   
photographs had received some distribution, he requested Rateman as Head   
of the Compliance and Investigations Division, to recover as many as  
possible of the photographs, advise the persons in whose possession they   
were found to say nothing to anyone concerning them, and to return the
said photographs to him for transmission to the United States Air Force    
Intelligence Service.  Rateman advises that he succeeded in rounding up    
twenty four copies of these photographs, and that, according to the   
statements of ________, no more copies were made or distributed.  Rateman  
further stated that _______ had appeared extremely concerned over the 
matter and seemed quite emphatic that the matter should be given no more   
publicity than was absolutely necessary.  Rateman also advised that he
studied the negatives from which the reproductions were made, and they
appeared to be authentic in that trick photography should have been   
apparent, but from the ______________ ________________.

                                                 23 September 1947    
SUBJECT:  AMC Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"   
TO:       Commanding General  
         Army Air Forces 
         Washington 25, D.C.  
         ATTENTION:     Brig. General George Schulgen  
                        AC/AS-2    
 
1.  As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered   
opinion of this command concerning the so-called "Flying Discs."  This
opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and
preliminary studied by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, 
Engineering Division T-3.  This opinion was arrived at in a conference
between personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence  
T-2, Office, Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, Power   
Plant and Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.    
 
2.  It is the opinion that:   
 
  a.  The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or  
      fictitious.   
 
  b.  There are objects probably approximately the shpe of a disc, of 
      such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made   
      aircraft.
 
  c.  There is the possibility that some of the incidents may be 
      caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors.    
 
  d.  The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of 
      climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which 
      must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly
      aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of 
      the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or    
      remotely.
 
  e.  The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:   
 
      (1)  Metallic or light reflecting surface.  
 
      (2)  Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object
           apparently was operating under high performance conditions.
 
      (3)  Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on    
           top.
 
      (4)  Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from
           three to nine objects.  
 
      (5)  Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a  
           substantial rumbling roar was noted.   
 
      (6)  Level flight speeds normally about 300 knots are estimated.

      LETTER FROM GENERAL N.F. TWINING TO COMMANDING GENERAL,    
 
               ARMY AIR FORCES 23 SEPTEMBER 1947  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
f.  It is possible within the present U.S. knowledger - provided 
    extensive detailed development is undertaken--to construct a piloted   
    aircraft which has the general description of the object in  
    subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range  
    of 700 miles at subsonic speeds.    
 
g.  Any devlopments in this country along the lines indicated would be
    extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense    
    of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up  
    independently of existing projects. 
 
h.  Due consideration must be given the following:
 
    (1)  The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the   
         product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or
         this command.   
 
    (2)  The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered
         exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these 
         objects.   
 
    (3)  The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of  
         propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic
         knowledge. 
 
3.  It is recommended that:   
 
a.  Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority,  
    security classification and code name for a detailed study of this
    matter to include the preparation of complete sets of all available    
    and pertinent data which will then be made available to the Army, 
    Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB, the Air Force Scientific    
    Advisory Group, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA projects for comments 
    and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be forwarded    
    within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed report  
    thereafter every 30 days as the investigation develops.  A complete    
    interchange of data should be effected.  
 
4.  Awaiting a specific directive AMC will continue the investigation 
    within its current resources in order to more closely define the  
    nature of the phenomenon.  Detailed Essential Elements of    
    Information will be formulated immediately for transmittal thru   
    channels.  
 
                                         N.F. TWINING  
                                         Lieutenant General, U.S.A.

REMARKS                  SUMMARY OF INFORMATION   
 
  1.  On 2 Sept 80, SOURCE related on 8 Aug 80, three Security Policemen   
assigned to 1608 SPS, KAFB, NM, on duty inside the Manzano Weapons Storage 
Area sighted an unidentified light in the air that traveled from North to  
South over the Coyote Canyon area of the Department of Defense Restricted  
Test Range on KAFB, NM.  The Security Policemen identified as:  SSGT  
STEPHEN FERENZ, Area Supervisor, ATC MARTIN W. RIST and AMN ANTHONY D.
FRAZIER, were later interviewed separately by SOURCE and all three    
related the same statement; at approximately 2350 hrs., while on duty in   
Charlie Sector, East Side of Manzano, the three observed a very bright
light in the sky approximately 3 miles North-North East of their position. 
The light traveled with great speed and stopped suddenly in the sky over   
Coyote Canyon.  The three first thought the object was a helicopter,  
however, after observing the strange aerial maneuvers (stop and go), they  
felt a helicopter couldn't have performed such skills.  The light landed   
in the Coyote Canyon area.  Sometime later, three witnessed the light take 
off and leave proceeding straight up at a high speed and disappear.   
 
  2.  Central Security Control (CSC) inside Manzano, contacted Sandia 
Security, who conducts frequent building checks on two alarmed structures  
in area.  They advised that a patrol was already in the area and would
investigate.   
 
  3.  On 11 Aug 80, RUSS CURTIS, Sandia Security, advised that on 9 Aug    
80, a Sandia Security Guard, (who wishes his name not be divulged for fear 
of harassment), related the following:  At approximately 0020 hrs., he was 
driving east on the Coyote Canyon access road on a routine building check  
of an alarmed structure.  As he approached the structure he observed a
bright light near the ground behind the structure.  He also observed an    
object he first thought was a helicopter.  But after driving closer, he    
observed a round disk shaped object.  He attempted to radio for backup
patrol but his radio would not work.  As he approached the object on foot  
armed with a shotgun, the object took off in a vertical direction at a
high rate of speed.  The guard was a former helicopter mechanic in the
U.S. Army and stated the object he observed was not a helicopter.
 
  4.  SOURCE advised on 22 Aug 80, three other security policemen observed 
the same aerial phenomena described by the first three.  Again the object  
landed in Coyote Canyon.  They did not see the object take off.

5.  Coyote Canyon is part of a large restricted test range used by the Air 
Force Weapons Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, Defense Nuclear Agency and  
the Department of Energy.  The range was formerly patrolled by Sandia 
Security, however, they only conduct building checks there now.  
 
6.  On 10 Aug 80, a New Mexico State Patrolman sighted an aerial object    
land in the Manzano's between Belen and Albuquerque, NM.  The Patrolman    
reported the sighting to the Kirtland AFB Command Post, who later referred 
the patrolman to the AFOSI Dist 17.  AFOSI Dist 17 advised the patrolman   
to make a report through his own agency.  On 11 Aug 80, the Kirtland  
Public Information office advised the patrolman the USAF no longer    
investigates such sighting unless they occur on a USAF base.
 
7.  WRITER contacted all the agencies who utilized the test range and it   
was learned no aerial tests are conducted in the Coyote Canyon area.  Only 
ground test are conducted.    
 
8.  On 8 Sept 80, WRITER learned from Sandia Security that another    
Security guard observed a object land near an alarmed structure sometime   
during the first week of August, but did not report it until just
recently for fear of harassment.   
 
9.  The two alarmed structures located within the area contain HQ CR 44    
material.

REMARKS                    SUMMARY OF INFORMATION 
 
1.  On 13 Aug 80, 1960 COMMSq Maintenance Officer reported Radar Approach  
Control equipment and scanner radar inoperative due to high frequency 
jamming from an unknown cause.  Total blackout of entire radar approach    
system to include Albuquerque Airport was in effect between 1630-2215 hrs. 
Radar Approach Control back up system also were inoperative.
 
2.  On 13 Aug 80, Defense Nuclear Agency Radio Frequency Monitors
determined, by vector analysis, the interference was being sent from an    
area (V-90 degrees or due East).  On DAF map coordinates E-28.6.  The area 
was located NW of Coyote Canyon Test area.  It was first thought that 
Sandia Laboratory, which utilizes the test range was responsible.
However, after a careful check, it was later determined that no test were  
being conducted in the canyon area.  Department of Energy, Air Force  
Weapons Laboratory and DNA were contacted but assured that their agencies  
were not responsible.    
 
3.  On 13 Aug 80, Base Security Police conducted a physical check of the   
area but because of the mountainous terrain, a thorough check could not be 
completed at that time.  A later foot search failed to disclose anything   
that could have caused the interference.
 
4.  On 13 Aug 80, at 2216 hrs., all radar equipment returned to normal
operation without further incident.
 
5.  CONCLUSION:  The presence of hostile intelligence jamming cannot be    
ruled out.  Although no evidence would suggest this, the method has been   
used in the past.  Communication maintenance specialists cannot explain    
how such interference could cause the radar equipment to become totally    
inoperative.  Neither could they suggest the type or range of the
interference signal.  DNA frequency monitors reporeted the interference    
beam was wide spread and a type unknown to their electronical equipment.   
Further checks of the area was being conducted by Technical Services, 
AFOSI.    
 
6.  High command interest item.  Briefings requested IAW AFOSIR 124-4 be   
completed at HQ AFOSI/IVOE.  HQ CR 44 and 51 items.

1.  Subject Negatives/Film were analyzed by HQ IVT and 7602 AINTELG, it    
and the following results were found:   
A.  Negative #1:  Deplicting C-5A aircraft on approach and streaking  
unidentified aerial object in lower right portion of film.  Film found to  
be unaltered.  Size differential was not consistent with size of aircraft. 
Conclusion:  Inconclusive
B.  Negative #2:  Deplicting cylinder shaped unidentified aerial object in 
upper left portion of photo.  Film found to be unaltered.  Film showed
object to be consistent with field depth and consistent with relative size 
of fixed objects.  Conclusion:  Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial 
object.  Bolton/Reinfeld method did not reveal visible markings on object. 
C.  Negative #3:  Deplicting irregular shaped unidentified aerial object   
in seven frames of 8MM film.  Because of the size and apparent speed of    
object no further classification or conclusion could be drawn.  Film shown 
to be unaltered.    
D.  34 inches of 8MM film:  Deplicting apparent colored object moving in   
front of still camera.  Film found to be unaltered.  Spectrography    
revealed colors to be basic prism features.  Depth analysis revealed  
object to be within 152MM of camera.  Object was not consistent with  
relative size of fixed objects observed for several seconds in film.  
Conclusion:  inconclusive.    
E.  Original Negative Deplicting Unidentified Object:  Film found to be    
unaltered.  Because of a lack of fixed objects in the film, no depth  
analysis could be performed.  Bolton, Reinfeld method revealed object to   
be saucer shaped, approximate diameter 37 feet.  Object contained a   
trilateral insignia on the lower portion of object.  Conclusion: 
Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial object.
2.  Ref your request for further information regarding HQ CR 44, the  
following is provided:  Capt. Grace 7602 Aintelg, INS contacted and   
related following:  (S/WINTEL) USAF no longer publicly active in UFO  
research, however USAF still has interest in all UFO sightings over USAF   
installation/test ranges.  Several other government agencies, lead by 
NASA, actively investigates legitimate sightings through covert cover.
(S/WINTEL/FSA)  One such cover is UFO Reporting Center, US Coast and  
Geodetic Survey, Rockville, MD 20852.  NASA filters results of sightings   
to appropriate military departments with interest in that particular  
sighting.  The official US Government Policy and results of project   
Aquarius is still classified top secret with no dissemination outside 
official intelligence channels and with restricted access to "MJ 
Twelve".  Case on Bennewitz is being monitored by NASA, INS, who 
request all future evidence be forwarded to them thru AFOSI, IVOE.    
4.  Ref your request for technical assistance.  Because of a chance of
public disclosure, no knowledgeable personnel with SPA will be provided.   
Continue to receive assistance from individuals mentioned in your

which provides for the withholding of information specifically protected   
from disclosure by statute.  The specific statutes applicable in this case 
are Title 18 U.S. Code 798; Title 50 U.S. Code 403(d) (3); and Section 6,  
Public Law 86-36 (50 U.S. Code 402 "note").  
 
    No portion of the information is reasonably segregable. 
 
    Since your request has been denied, you are hereby advised of this
Agency's appeal procedures.   
 
    Any person denied access to information may, within 45 days after 
notification of the denial, file an appeal to the NSA/CSS Freedom of  
Information Act Appeal Authority.  The appeal shall be in writing
addressed to the NSA/CSS FOIA Appeal Authority, National Security Agency,  
Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000.  The appeal shall reference the  
initial denial of access and shall contain, in sufficient detail and  
particularity, the grounds upon which the requester believes release of    
the information is required.  The NSA/CSS Appeal Authority shall respond   
to the appeal within 20 working days after receipt.    
 
    In your letter, you take exception to the amount requested by this
Agency for manpower and computer search fees to process your original 
request for all information on Project Aquarius.  Please be advised that   
NSA search and duplication fees are computed in accordance with guidance   
promulgated in sections 6-201 and 6-202 of Dod Directive 5400.7-R

Dear Mr. Clarke
 
This is in reference to your Freedom of Information Act request of 18 
November 1983 requesting access to information regarding photographs taken 
by Paul Bennewitz in 1980 near Kirtland AFB. 
 
The only information we have in our files regarding this incident is a
copy of a message, originator unknown, which apparently was placed in 
circulation in at least three cities in the U.S.  This message discusses   
analysis of UFO photographs, and, while it does not mention who the   
photographer was, it does mention the name Bennewitz.  The purported  
originator, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, has reviewed   
the message and confirmed that it is a hoax.  While the Air Force
Intelligence Service is listed as a recipient of the message, we have no   
record of ever receiving it from AFOSI.  The copy which we have in our
files was forwarded to us by the organization Citizens Against UFO    
Secrecy.  
 
We are attaching a copy of the document as we received it.  We have,  
however, removed the bogus security markings so as not to alarm any   
recipients.  We are also attaching other documents created by this agency  
as a result of the bogus message.  These documents have previously been    
released to the public through the Freedom of Information Act.   
 
For your further information, this agency collected information on UFO
sightings for a few years.  However, our interest in this topic was   
discontinued in the mid-1970's and our UFO records were transferred to
the General Services Administration for inclusion in Project Blue Book.    
These records are available for public inspection through the National
Archives and Records Service, Modern Military Branch, 8th and    
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington DC 20408.

Possible Unauthorized Release of Classified Material   
 
INSA (MSgt Heldman) 
DA   
 
1.  Per our telephone conversation today, I am forwarding Mr Robert   
Todd's FOIA request along with the AFOSI message for determination as to   
classification level.  As you can see, Mr Todd retyped the message "for    
easier reading."  I have talked to AFOSI/DADF, Nadine Dulacki.  According  
to her, they did not release the message to Mr Todd nor does she know how  
it came into his possession.  Maj Kilikauskas (AFSAC/INOB, 664-4488) has   
looked at the message and he feels that it is a fake for several reasons:  
 
  a.  There never has been an office within AFSAC (or 7602nd) with the
  symbol INS, INSR, or IT.    
 
  b.  There has never been a "Capt Grace" (or anyone with the surname 
  Grace) assigned to AFSAC.   
 
  c.  The purported imagery interpretation done is outside AFSAC's and
  AFOSI's mission.  Further, AFSAC has no individuals who are photo   
  interpreters.
 
  d.  The term WNINTEL is spelled phonetically on each occurrence.  OSI    
  should certainly be familiar with the correct spelling.  Further, the    
  document is replete with grammatical errors, typing errors, and in  
  general, makes no sense.    
 
  e.  The document is not in the standard, accepted format for   
  classified messages.   
 
Neither Maj Kilikauskas nor Mr Nehlig (who has worked in AFSAC many   
years) remember hearing of a "Project Aquarius."  Further, Maj   
Kilikauskas had no idea if the information purported supplied by this 
Capt Grace is, in fact, classified at the Secret/WNINTEL level.  He   
suggests that both NASA and Coast and Geodetic Survey be contacted to 
see if they have an interest in the message. 
 
2.  Finally, I have talked to Mr Earl Middaugh (AFOSI/IVOE, 767-5144).
He remembers a FOIA request that his office staffed which involved an 
AFOSI message similar to this one.  However, they were unable to identify  
it as OSI originated.  He thinks perhaps this might be the same message.   
I have forwarded a copy of the Todd request to the AFOSI Freedom of   
Information Office (Bob Walker, 767-5262).  Upon receipt both Mr Walker    
and Mr Middaugh will be better able to determine if this is a legitimate   
AFOSI document.
 
3.  Until a determination is made, we ill regard the document as 
classified.

Dear Mr. ________________
 
     This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request of 8   
January 1986 in which you request information on a group referred to as    
MJ12 or "Majestic 12" and Projects Sigma, Snowbird and Aquarius. 
 
     Please be advised that Sigma and Snowbird are not projects of this    
Agency, so we would have no records responsive to that portion of your
request.  In addition, no records were located relating to M12 or
"Majestic 12." 
 
     An initial survey of materials responsive to that portion of your
request dealing with Project Aquarius would result in search fees in  
excess of $15,000 for manpower and computer costs.  Our search would be    
facilitated and the search fees may be less if you provide us with    
additional information regarding the type of information in which you are  
interested.  This request for further specificity is in accordance with    
DoD regulations governing the processing of FOIA requests.  
 
     Should you wish us to initiate a search for records responsive to
your request as stated inyour 8 January letter, please be advised that our 
policy is to request advance payment of one-half the estimated cost, as    
well as an agreement to pay the balance, prior to initiating the search.   
 
     Please be advised that your agreeing to incur these fees will not
necessarily result in the disclosure to you of any information.  It has    
been our experience, that any records responsive to your request, if such  
records exist, most likely would be classified or otherwise exempt from    
release in accordance with the exemption provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.  The application of these exemptions to NSA information   
has been consistently approved by the Federal Judiciary.

Dear Mr. _________________:   
 
    This is in response to your letter of 20 February 1986 in which you    
stated that, regarding your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for  
information on Project Aquarius, you are interested in Aquarius as it 
pertains to unidentified aerial objects.  Please be advised that Project   
Aquarius does not deal with unidentified aerial projects.  We, therefore,  
have no information to provide to you on the subject.  
 
    In your letter you also ask for information on Projects Sigma and 
Snowbird.  The FOIA provides that a person has a right of access to   
federal agency records, except to the extent that such records are    
protected from disclosure by one of nine exemptions.  It does not require  
that an agency answer questions.  As I mentioned in my letter of 20   
February, Sigma and Snowbird are not NSA projects; therefore, we have no   
information to give you on these topics.
 
    Since you indicate in your letter that you will not be paying the 
$15,000.00 fee to search for records pertaining to Aquarius, this response 
completes our action on your request.   
 
                                           Sincerely,

Mr. Dennis C. Chadwick                                        3-7-86  
Chief, Information Policy
National Security Agency 
Fort George G. Meade
Maryland 20755-6000 
 
Dear Mr. Chadwick:  
 
Thank you for your letter of 3 March 1986 and reply to my previous letter  
on Project Aquarius.  I understand from your letter that you intend to
abide strictly by the letter of the law in responses to FOIA requests.  I  
had not realized that this was the attitude of the NSA or I would not have 
bothered you with questions in general.  I have gotten the impression from 
other sources that the NSA does not maintain a generally open attitude
toward the public, particularly where the subject of unidentified aerial   
objects is involved, and while completely understand the need to restrict  
some information what good is a country if its citizens are kept ignorant. 
Personally I feel that assessing a $15,000 charge for information is  
simply a convenient way to disuade requests. 
 
Let me therefore rephrase my request as I would prefer to judge for myself 
whether Aquarius has anything to do with my interests.  Firstly, I do not  
want to endanger this country or any of its intelligence gathering    
sources.  I am not a spy or a subversive, my father is a surgeon and Lt.   
Colonel in the Air Force and I wouldn't want to harm his career. 
Therefore I am requesting just a clean copy of the material NSA is    
maintaining which describes what the goal of project Aquarius is.  I am    
not asking for all material you have but simply the initial forms, papers, 
or letters, which initiated this project and those which outline its  
purpose.  
 
I cannot conceive that there should be anything but negligible costs to    
photocopy these materials.  This should be waived inasmuch as it should be 
in the interest of the public to be aware of what their taxes are paying   
for.  But if NSA needs reimbursement of copying costs then please let me   
know what the cost will be.   
 
Sincerely,
 
Mr.______________________

ATIN OF.  
 
SUBJECT:  Unexplained Lights  
 
TO:  RAF/CC    
 
     1. Early in the morning of 27 Dec 80 (approximately 0300L),two USAF   
     security police patrolmen saw unusual lights outside the back gate at 
     RAF Woodbridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been force 
     down, they call for permission to go outside the gate to investigate. 
     The on-duty flight chief reponded and allowed three patrolmen to pro- 
     ceed on foot.The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object 
     in the forest.The object was described as being metalic in appearance 
     and triangular in shape, approximately two to three meters across the 
     base and approximately two meters high. It illuminated the entire fo- 
     rest with a white light. The object itself had a pulsing red light on 
     top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering  
     or on legs. As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered th- 
     rough the trees and disappeared. At this time the animals on a nearby 
     farm went into a frenzy. The object was briefly sighted approximately 
     an hour later near the back gate.  
 
     2.  The next day, three depressions 1 1/2" deep and 7" in diameter    
     were found where the object had been sighted on the ground. The foll- 
     owing night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation.Beta/Gamma 
     readings of 0.1 milliroentgens were recorded with peak reading in the 
     three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed by the   
     depressions. A nearby tree had moderate (.05-.07)readings on the side 
     of the tree toward the depressions.
 
     3.  Later in the night a red sun-like light was seen through the tree 
     . It moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off    
     glowing particles and then  broke into five separate white objects    
     and then disappeared. Immediately thereafter, three star-like objects 
     were noticed in the sky.Two objects to the north and one to the south 
     , all of which were about 10 degrees off the horizon. The objects
     moved rapidly in sharp angular movements and displayed red, green and 
     blue lights. The objects to the north appeared to be elliptical thro- 
     ugh an 8-12 power lens. They then turned to full circles. The objects 
     to the north remained in the sky for an hour or more. The object to   
     the south was visible for two or three hours and beamed down a stream 
     of light from time to time. Numerous individuals, including the unde- 
     rsigned, witnessed the activities in paragraphs 2 and 3.

Dear Mr.Arnon: 
 
The subject of UFOs is one that has interested me for some time. 
About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was   
in the building at Wright Patterson Air Force Base where the information   
is stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was    
understandably denied this request.
 
It is still classified above Top Secret.  I have, however, heard that 
there is a plan under way to release some, if not all, of this material in 
the near future.  I'm just as anxious to see this material as you are, and 
I hope we will not have to wait too much longer.  
 
Sincerely.

First, let me tell you that I have long ago give up acquiring access to    
the so-called Blue Room at Wright-Patterson, as I have had one long   
string of deials from chief after chief, so I have give up. 
 
In answer to your questions, "one is essentially correct." I don't know    
of anyone who has access to the "Blue Room," nor am I aware of its    
contents and I am not aware of anything having been relocated. I can't
answer your question six, in fact, I can't find anyone who would answer    
it.  
 
To tell you the truth, Mr Graham, "this thing has gotten so highly    
classified," ecen though I will admit there is a lot of it that has been   
released, "it is just impossible to get anything on it."    
 
I am returning your papers because I know they are of value to you.   
 
Sincerely,
 
Barry Goldwater

Dear Mr.Steinman:   
 
To answer your questions, I have never gained access to the so-called 
"Blue Room" at Wright Patterson, so I have no idea what is in it. I have   
no idea of who controls the flow of "need-to-know" because, frankly, I
was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that 
I've never tried to made it my business since.    
 
I wish you luck on your investigation. I'm one of those people who    
believe that with some two billion planets scattered around our universe,  
there has to be a couple of more that can subport life on it.    
 
Sincerely,
 
Barry Goldwater

         MENORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:  
 
                   The following is the information we have from GHQ  
         at this mement regarding the air alarm over Los Angeles of   
         yesterday morning:   
 
                   "From details available at this hour:    
 
 
                     1. Unidentified airplanes, other then American   
            Army or Navy planes, were probably over Los Angeles, and  
            were fired on by elements of the 37th CA Brigade  ( AA )  
            between 3:12 and 4:15 AM.  These units expended  1430
            rounds of ammunition.  
 
                     2. As many as fifteen airplanes may have    
            been involved, flying at various speeds from what is 
            officially reported as being very slow to as much    
            as 200 MPH and at elevations from 9000 to 18000 feet.
 
                     3. No bombs were dropped.    
 
                     4. No casualties among our troops.
 
                     5. No planes were shot down. 
 
                     6. No American Army or Navy planes were in action.    
 
                Investigation continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude  
            that if unidentified airplanes were involved they may have
            been from commercial sources, operated by enemy agents for
            purposes of spreeding alarm, disclosing location of antiair-   
            craft positions, and slowing production through blackout. 
            Such conclusion is supported by varying speed of operation and 
            the fact that no bombs were dropped.

MEMORANDUM TO THE CONTROLLER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS:    
 
             For the past several years we have been engaged in the study  
of various aspects of radio wave propagation.  The vagaries of this   
phenomenon have led us into the fields of aurora, cosmis radiation,   
atmospheric radio-activity and geo-magnetism.  In the case of    
geo-magnetics our investigations have contributed little to our knowledge  
of radio wave propagation as yet, but nevertheless have indicated several  
avenues of investigation which may well be explored with profit.  For 
example, we are on the track of a means whereby the potential energy of    
the earth's magnetic field may be abstracted and used. 
 
             On the basis of theoretical considerations a small and very   
crude experimental unit was constructed approximately a year ago and  
tested in our Standards Laboratory.  The tests were essentially successful 
in that sufficient energy was abstracted from the earth's field to operate 
a voltmeter, approximately 50 milliwatts.  Although this unit was far from 
being self-sustaining, it nevertheless demonstrated the soundness of the   
basic principles in a qualitative manner and provided useful data for the  
design of a better unit. 
 
             The design has now been completed for a unit which should be  
self-sustaining and in addition provide a small surplus of power.  Such a  
unit, in addition to functioning as a `pilot power plant' should be large  
enough to permit the study of the various reaction forces which are   
expected to develop.
 
             We believe that we are on the track of something which may    
well prove to be the introduction to a new technology.  The existence of a 
different technology is borne out by the investigations which are being    
carried on at the present time in relation to flying saucers.    
 
             While in Washington attending the NARB Conference, two books  
were released, one titled "Behind the Flying Saucer" by Frank Scully, and  
the other "The Flying Saucers are Real" by Donald Keyhoe.  Both books 
dealt mostly with the sightings of unidentified objects and both books
claim that flying objects were of extra-terrestrial origin and might well  
be space ships

from another planet.  Scully claimed that the preliminary studies of one   
saucer which fell into the hands of the United States Government indicated 
that they operated on some hitherto unknown magnetic principles.  It  
appeared to me that our own work in geo-magnetics might well be the   
linkage between our technology and the technology by which the saucers are 
designed and operated.  If it is assumed that our geo-magnetic   
investigations are in the right direction, the theory of operation of the  
saucers becomes quite straight forward, with all observed features    
explained qualitatively and quantitatively.  
 
             I made discreet enquiries through the Canadian Embassy staff  
in Washington who were able to obtain for me the following information:    
 
a.  The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States  
    Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb.    
 
b.  Flying saucers exist.
 
c.  Their modus operandi is unknown but concentrated effort is being made  
    by a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush.   
 
d.  The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be 
    of tremendous significance.    
 
I was further informed that the United States authorities are    
investigating along quite a nubmer of lines which might possibly be   
related to the saucers such as mental phenomena and I gather that they are 
not doing too well since they indicated that if Canada is doing anything   
at all in geo-magnetics they would welcome a discussion with suitably 
accredited Canadians.    
 
             While I am not yet in a position to say that we have solved   
even the first problems in geo-magnetic energy release, I feel that the    
correlation between our basic theory and the available information on 
saucers checks too closely to be more coincidence.  It is my honest   
opinion that we are on the right track and are fairly close to at least    
some of the answers.
 
             Mr. Wright, Defence Research Board liaison officer at the
Canadian Embassy in Washington, was extremely anxious for me to get in
touch with Doctor Solandt, Chairman of the Defence Research Board, to 
discuss with him future investigations along the line geo-magnetic energy  
release.

I do not feel that we have as yet sufficient data to place before Defence  
Research Board which would enable a program to be initiated within that    
organization, but I do feel that further research is necessary and I  
would prefer to see it done within the frame work of our own organization  
with, of course, full co-operation and exchange of information with other  
interested bodies.  
 
             I discussed this matter fully with Doctor Solandt, Chairman   
of Defence Research Board, on November 20th and placed before him as much  
information as I have been able to gather to date.  Doctor Solandt agreed  
that work on geo-magnetic energy should go forward as rapidly as possible  
and offered full co-operation of his Board in providing laboratory    
facilities, acquisition of necessary items of equipment, and specialized   
personnel for incidental work in the project.  I indicated to Doctor  
Solandt that we would prefer to keep the project within the Department of  
Transport for the time being until we have obtained sufficient information 
to permit a complete assessment of the value of the work.   
 
             It is therefore recommended that a PROJECT be set up within   
the frame work of this Section to study this problem and that the work be  
carried on a part time basis until such time as sufficient tangible   
results can be seen to warrant more definitive action.  Cost of the   
program in its initial stages are expected to be less than a few hundred   
dollars and can be carried by our Radio Standards Lab appropriation.  
 
             Attached hereto is a draft of terms of reference for such a   
project which, if authorized, will enable us to proceed with this
research work within our own organization.

Dear Woody:    
 
     In your new function in the Unidentified Flying   
Object Program, it is our understanding that your 
4602nd people will do the "leg work" so to speak, and  
furnish ATIC with its findings.  For those types that  
cannot be identified by your Squadron, ATIC will handle
from an exploratory point of view. 
 
     Many times the publicity connected with this 
program has been somewhat embarrassing, in that we are 
dealing with a subject, parts of which, are not ex-    
plainable, and the public feeling is that we are holding    
back information they should know about.
 
     Due to a policy letter General Samford wrote this 
Directorate a while back, this office has assumed motor-    
ship of releases to the public.  I would like to quote 
the last sentence of General Samford's letter as it    
pertains to publicity:   
 
          "The Directorate of Intelligence, USAF, 
          will resist consistently any idea that  
          a releasable story can be developed
          about any intelligence activity, pro-   
          cess, or experience."    
 
     As you realize, there is a 10-20% area of unexplainable
objects, in this program.  Also, for this area, we believe  
General Samford's statement above applies, in that it deals 
in an intelligence process performed by ATIC.  Therefore,   
we would like to offer you guidance in the publicity angle  
as it pertains to your activity.   
 
                          CONFIDENTIAL

     We think it would be well for your 4602nd people  
in the ZI, to discuss a particular sighting with the   
public or press, anytime the object can be identified. 
Meaning, if they can verify the object as a balloon,   
aircraft, helicopter, etc., go ahead and inform interested  
parties.  However, for those times where the object is not  
explainable, it would be well to advise your people to say  
something on this order, "The information on this sighting  
will be analyzed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center   
at Dayton, Ohio", and leave it go at that.  If your people  
get into analyzing the 10-20% area to the public, every
news media across the country will pick up the story.  
 
     For your information, we have requested ATIC to sub-   
mit to this office, a report that can be released to the    
public.  If you desire we could forward to your office a    
copy of this report, that could be used by your agency,
for release purposes.

1. On 18 October 1973 at 2305 hours in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio,    
Army Helicopter 68-15444 assigned to Cleveland USARFFAC encountered a near 
midair collision with a unidentified flying object. Four crewmembers  
assigned to the Cleveland USARFFAC for flying proficiency were on AFTP
status when this incident occurred. The flight crew assigned was CPT  
Lawrence J. Coyne, Pilot in Command,1LT Arrigo Jozzi, Copilot, SSG Robert  
Yanacsek, Crew Chief, SSG John Healey,Flight Medio,All the above personnel 
are member of the 316th MED DET(HEL AMB). a tenant reserve unit of the
Cleveland USARFFAC. 
 
2. The reported incident happened as follows: Army Helicopter 68-15444 was 
returning from Columbus, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio and at 2305 hours east,   
south east of Mansfield Airport in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio while   
flying at an altitude of 2500 feet and on a heading of 030 degrees, SSG    
Yanacsek observed a red light on the east horizon,90 drgrees to the flight 
path of the helicopter. Approximately 30 seconds later, SSG Yanacsek  
indicated the object was converging on the helicopter at the same altitude 
at a airspeed in excess of 600 knots and on a midair collision heading.    
 
Cpt Coyne observed the converging object, took over the controls of the    
aircraft and initiated a power descent from 2500 feet to 1700 feet to 
avoid impact with the object. A radio call was initiated to Mansfield 
Tower who acknowledged the helicopter and was asked by CPT Coyne if there  
were any high performance aircraft flying in the vicinity of Mansfield
Airport however there was no response received from the tower. The crew    
expected impact from the object instead, the object was observed to   
hesistate momontarily over the helicopter and then slowly continued on a   
westerly course accelerating at a high rate of speed, clear west of   
Mansfield Airport then turn 45 degree heading to the Northwest.  
Cpt Coyne indicated the altimeter read a 1000 fpm olimp and read 3500 feet 
with the collective in the full down position. The aircraft was returned   
to 2500 feet by CPT Coyne and flown back to Cleveland, Ohio. The flight    
plan was closed and the FAA Flight Service Station notified of the    
incident.  The FSS told CPT Coyne to report the incident to the FAA GADO   
office a Cleveland Hopkins Airport Mr. Porter, 83d USARCOM was notified of 
the incident at 1530 hours on 19 Oct 73.
 
3. This report has been read and attested to by the crewmembers of the
aircraft with signatures acknowledgeing this report.

THAT THEY HAD SEEN STRANGE OBJECTS IN THE SKY.  SOME REPORTED A KIND OF    
BIRD-LIKE OBJECT WHILE OTHERS REPORTED A HELICOPTER WITH A LIGHT ON.  
THERE WERE NO HELICOPTERS AIRBORNE AT THAT TIME.------------------------   
------------------------- AFTER.  HE TOLD THE CITIZEN IT WAS ONLY STARS    
AND HAD TALKED TO MEHRABAD TOWER HE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR HIMSELF.  HE  
NOTICED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY SIMILAR TO A STAR BIGGER AND BRIGHTER.  HE    
DECIDED TO SCRAMBLE AN F-4 FROM SHAHROKHI AFB TO INVESTIGATE.    
 
  B.  AT 0130 HRS ON THE 19TH THE F-4 TOOK OFF AND PROCEEDED TO A POINT    
ABOUT 40 NM NORTH OF TEHRAN.  DUE TO ITS BRILLIANCE THE OBJECT WAS    
EASILY VISIBLE FROM 70 MILES AWAY.  AS THE F-4 APPROACHED A RANGE OF 25    
NH HE LOST ALL INSTRUMENTATION AND COMMUNICTIONS (UHF AND INTERCOM).  
HE BROKE OFF THE INTERCEPT AND HEADED BACK TO SHAHROKHI.  WHEN THE F-4
TURNED AWAY FROM THE OBJECT AND APPARENTLY WAS NO LONGER A THREAT TO IT    
THE AIRCRAFT REGAINED ALL INSTRUMENTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS.  AT 0140
HRS A SECOND F-4 WAS LAUNCHED.  THE BACKSEATER ACQUIRED A RADAR LOCK ON    
AT 27 NH.  12 O'CLOCK HIGH POSITION WITH THE VC (RATE OF CLOSURE) AT 150   
NHPH.  AS THE RANGE DECREASED TO 25 NH THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A SPEED    
THAT WAS VISIBLE ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND STAYED AT 25 NH.    
  C.  THE SIZE OF THE RADAR RETURN WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF A 707 TANKER. 
THE VISUAL SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN BECAUSE OF ITS 
INTENSE BRILLIANCE.  THE LIGHT THAT IT GAVE OFF WAS THAT OF FLASHING  
STROBE LIGHTS ARRANGED IN A RECTANGULAR PATTERN AND ALTERNATING BLUE- 
GREEN, RED AND ORANGE IN COLOR.  THE SEQUENCE OF THE LIGHTS WAS SO FAST    
THAT ALL THE COLORS COULD BE SEEN AT ONCE.  THE OBJECT AND THE PURSUING    
F-4 CONTINUED ON A COURSE TO THE SOUTH OF TEHRAN WHEN ANOTHER BRIGHTLY
LIGHTED OBJECT, ESTIMATED TO BE ONE HALF TO ONE THIRD THE APPARENT SIZE OF 
THE MOON, CAME OUT OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECT.  THIS SECOND OBJECT HEADED 
STRAIGHT TOWARD THE F-4 AT A VERY FAST RATE OF SPEED.  THE PILOT ATTEMPTED 
TO FIRE AN AIM-9 MISSILE AT THE OBJECT BUT AT THAT INSTANT HIS WEAPONS
CONTROL PANEL WENT OFF AND HE LOST ALL COMMUNICATIONS (UHF AND INTERPHONE) 
AT THIS POINT THE PILOT INITIATED A TURN AND NEGATIVE G DIVE TO GET AWAY.  
AS HE TURNED THE OBJEAZ FELL IN TRAIL AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 3-4 NH. 
AS HE CONTINUED IN HIS TURN AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY OBJECT THE SECOND OBJECT 
WENT TO THE INSIDE OF HIS TURN THEN RETURNED TO THE PRIMARY OBJECT FOR A   
PERFECT REJOIN.
  D.  SHORTLY AFTER THE SECOND OBJECT JOINED UP WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECT    
ANOTHER OBJECT APPEARED TO COME OUT OF THE

OTHER SIDE OF THE PRIMARY OBJECT GOING STRAIGHT DOWN. AT A GREAT RATE OF   
SPEED.  THE F-4 CREW HAD REGAINED COMMUNICATIONS AND THE WEAPONS CONTROL   
PANEL AND WATCHED THE OBJECT APPROACH THE GROUND ANTICIPATING A LARGE 
EXPLOSION.  THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO COME TO REST GENTLY ON THE EARCH AND   
CAST A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 2-3 KILOMETERS.   
THE CREW DESCENDED FROM THEIR ALTITUDE OF 26H TO 15H AND CONTINUED TO 
OBSERVE AND MARK THE OBJECT'S POSITION.  THEY HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN  
ADJUSTING THEIR NIGHT VISIBILITY FOR LANDING SO AFTER ORBITING MEHRABAD    
A FEW TIMES THEY WENT OUT FOR A STRAIGHT IN LANDING.  THERE WAS A LOT OF   
INTERFERENCE ON THE UHF AND EACH TIME THEY PASSED THROUGH A MAG. BEARING   
OF 150 DEGREE FROM EHRABAD THEY LOST THEIR COMMUNICATIONS (UHF AND    
INTERPHONE) AND THE INS FLUCTUATED FROM 30 DEGREES - 50 DEGREES.  THE ONE  
CIVIL AIRLINER THAT WAS APPROACHING MEHRABAD DURING THIS SAME TIME    
EXPERIENCED COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE IN THE SAME VICINITY (KILO ZULU) BUT    
DID NOT REPORT SEEING ANYTHING.  WHILE THE F-4 WAS ON A LONG FINAL    
APPROACH THE CREW NOTICED ANOTHER CYLINDER SHAPED OBJECT (ABOUT THE SIZE   
OF A T-BIRD AT 10M) WITH BRIGHT STEADY LIGHTS ON EACH END AND A FLASHER    
IN THE MIDDLE.  WHEN QUERIED THE TOWER STATED THERE WAS NO OTHER KNOWN
TRAFFIC IN THE AREA.  DURING THE TIME THAT THE OBJECT PASSED OVER THE 
F-4 THE TOWER DID NOT HAVE A VISUAL ON IT BUT PICKED IT UP AFTER THE  
PILOT TOLD THEM TO LOOK BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE REFINERY.  
  E.  DURING DAYLIGHT THE F-4 CREW WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE AREA IN A
HELICOPTER WHERE THE OBJECT APPARENTLY HAD LANDED.  NOTHING WAS NOTICED    
AT THE SPOT WHERE THEY THOUGHT THE OBJECT LANDED (A DRY LAKE BED) BUT 
AS THEY CIRCLED OFF TO THE WEST OF THE AREA THEY PICKED UP A VERY
NOTICEABLE BEEPER SIGNAL.  AT THE POINT WHERE THE RETURN WAS THE 
LOUDEST WAS A SMALL HOUSE WITH A GARDEN.  THEY LANDED AND ASKED THE   
PEOPLE WITHIN IF THEY HAD NOTICED ANYTHING STRANGE LAST NIGHT.  THE   
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT A LOUD NOISE AND A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT LIKE    
LIGHTNING.  THE AIRCRAFT AND AREA WHERE THE OBJECT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
LANDED ARE BEING CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE RADIATION ----------------------

Dear Sir: 
 
I am in receipt of your letter concerning your research on the mystery
of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and I understand that you are   
participating in an international effort to establish contact with    
persons having past experiences involving UFOs.   
 
In June 1970, I had occasion to come in direct contact with a UFO.  I was  
stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with the Federal Aviation Administra-  
tion (FAA) and was flying with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard.  In
the early morning, a report had been received from two air carriers;  
Pan American, and a local carrier, Caribair, that at dawn a large
balloon-like object was sighted drifting slowly southwestward at an   
approximate altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The object was detected on   
the Air Route Traffic Control Center radar and subsequently tracked.  
Movement appeared to be in a southwesterly direction at 4 to 8 knots per   
hour, varying slightly hour to hour.  I was a member of a flight of 104s   
and a T-33 aircraft that went to the site where the object had been   
sighted to observe and to photograph it if possible.  The object was  
visible from the ground at Isla Verde Airport, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
lying low in the skies on a south southwesterly heading.  Its appearance   
was similar to a balloon.  After becoming airborne and flying towards 
the object, it became immediately apparent that it was at a very high 
altitude and was quite a distance away.  The object was approximately 
40 miles southwest of Ponce, Puerto Rico, at an altitude in excess of 
60,000 feet, estimated roughly at 80,000 feet.  Myself in a T-33 and four  
other pilots in f104s observed and photographed the object.  The 
following details are noted:  
 
     1.  It was a manufactured item.    
 
     2.  It was at least 125 feet in width with the same approximate  
         length.    
 
     3.  It was shaped similar to the forward one-third of a speedboat
         hull with a flat rear section and a pointed nose section.    
         (See sketch.)   
 
     4.  There was an area of high reflectivity on the "keel" approxi-
         mately one-third from the nose of the object.  (See sketch.)

     5.  The object remained oriented in a northeasterly/southwesterly
         direction with the nose pointed northeast; the stern to the  
        southwest, and drifting slowly against the prevailing winds to
        the southwest about 8 knots per hour.
 
    6.  There were no signs of any type of propulsion unit on the object.  
 
Extensive gun-camera film was collected showing the object very closely.   
A B-52 from Ramey Air Force Base acquired the target on the radar.  Upon   
"locking on," the B-52 received electronic jamming.  The object was kept   
in surveillance throughout the remainder of the daylight hours and was
lost after dark.    
 
The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was clear skies and
unlimited visibility.  The object was viewed by the majority of the popu-  
lation of the island of Puerto Rico; visible in plain sight for most of    
the day, and reported to all military intelligence activities, National    
Weather Service, etc.  We have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation   
as to what the object was.  The San Juan Star published a series of   
articles concerning the incident.  
 
I am presently the Deputy Chief at the Kansas City Air Route Traffic  
Control Center and would welcome any additional inquiries on this subject  
and perhaps I could direct you to where film could be obtained of the 
object.   
 
Thank you,
 
 
CHARLES M. BUMSTEAD, Deputy Chief  
Kansas City ARTC Center

Dear Mr.________________:
 
     This is in response to your letter of October 21, 1978 
requesting information on MOONDUST AND BLUEFLY.   
 
     BLUEFLY was a project for the acquisition of airlift   
for a quick reaction capability.  It was determined that    
the need did not exist and the project was discontinued
several years ago.  
 
     MOONDUST is a program in which the Air Force provides  
technical assistance in determining the origin of space
debris, U.S. or foreign. 
 
     These programs are under the purview of Air Force Systems   
Command, Andrews AFB, MD, 20034.  Please write to the Director   
of Information there, if you desire additional data.  He    
may be able to help.
 
                              Sincerely,
 
                              ALBERT W. SCHUMANN

considered your appeal, and I have determined your appeal   
should be granted in part and denied in part.
 
     The Biographical Sketch, dated 1 January 1957, is exempt    
from mandatroy disclosure under the Freedom of Information  
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6).  The disclosure of this information
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy.  Release of this type of information is also  
prohibited by paragraph 27b, Air Force Regulation 12-35 (32 
CFR 806b).
 
     The two AFCIN memoranda, dated 11 February 1958 and 26 
December (no year indicated) are intra-agency memoranda con-
taining opinions and suggestions and are exempt from manda- 
tory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5
U.S.C. 552(b)(5).  These memoranda are withheld in an effort
to promote the free and frank interchange of ideas, opinions
and recommendations among Air Force personnel.  The infor-  
mation withheld is primarily opinion which would not be
routinely available through the discovery process.
 
     Portions of the AFCIN-1E-0 letter, dated 3 November 1961    
are releasable; however, the remaining portions are still   
exempt from mandatory release under the Freedom of Informa- 
tion Act 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1).  This information and the 
AFOIN-X(SG) memos are currently classified under Executive  
Order 12065, Section 1-301 (a) and (c), as implemented by   
Department of Defense regulation 5200.1-R, paragraphs 2-301 
(C) (3) and (5).  The continuing protection of this informa-
tion is essential to the national security because it reveals    
intelligence sources and methods.  The release of this infor-    
mation could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable   
damage to the national security.  The AFOIN-SSG letter has  
been declassified and is released. 
 
     This letter constitutes the final Air Force action on  
your appeal.  Under the Freedom of Information Act 5 U.S.C. 
552, provision exists for judicial review of this 
determination.

Dear Mr._________________
 
This responds to your 25 March 1986 Freedom of Information request.   
 
Attached is the only document in the Air Force Intelligence Office    
(AF/IN) relative to your request.  
 
AF/IN has no knowledge of "ICGL#4" dated 25 April 1961, pertaining    
to Project Moon Dust.  No "AFCIN SOP for Blue Fly Operations,    
February 1960" was located.  The programs (UFO, Blue Fly, Moon   
Dust) no longer exist and records were destroyed. 
 
There is no Air Force Intelligence unit responsible for collections   
under these projects since the projects are no longer active.    
 
Fees are waived in this instance.  
 
                                       Sincerely

          FACTORS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM:    
 
          2.   
 
 
 
 
 
            c.  In addition to their staff duty assignments, intelligence  
          team personnel have peacetime duty functions in support of such  
          Air Force projects as Moondust, Bluefly, and UFO, and other 
          AFCIN directed quick reaction projects which require   
          intelligence team operational capabilities (see Definitions).    
 
            d.  Normal personnel attrition, through PCS, discharge,   
          retirement, etc., has reduced the number of intelligence team    
          qualified personnel below a minimum requirement, and programmed  
          personnel losses within the next ten months will halve the  
          current manning.    
 
            e.  Personnel actions within the authority of AFFMP, AFCIN
          and AFCIN-1E can be taken to reverse the trend toward  
          diminishment of the intelligence team capability.

4.  ___ Criteria    
 
    a.  Intelligence team personnel can perfomr effectively only with 
an adequate background of training and experience.  Inadequately 
qualified personnel in such assignment would be a liability rather    
than an asset to successful accomplishment of the mission.  
 
5.  ___ Definitions.
 
    a.  Linguist:  Personnel who can develop intelligence information 
through interrogation and translation from Russion and/or Bloc country
languages to English.    
 
    b.  Tech Man:  Personnel qualified to develop intelligence infor- 
mation through field examination and analysis of foreign material,    
with emphasis on the Markings Program and technical photography. 
 
    c.  Ops Man:  Intelligence team chief.  Qualified to direct intel-
ligence teams in gaining access to target, in exploitation of enemy   
personnel and material, and in use of field communications equipment  
for rapid reporting of intelligence information.  
 
    d.  Airborne Personnel:  Military trained and rated parachutists. 
 
    e.  Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO):  Headquarters USAF has
established a program for investigation of reliably reported unidenti-
fied flying objects within the United States.  AFR 200-2 delineates   
1127th collection responsibilities.
 
    f.  Blue Fly:  Operation Blue Fly has been established to facilitate   
expeditious delivery to FTD of Moon Dust or other items of great tech-
nical intelligence interest.  AFCIN SOP for Blue Fly operations, 
February 1960, provides for 1127th participation. 
 
    g.  Moon Dust:  As a specialized aspect of its over-all material  
exploitation program, Headquarters USAF has established Project Moon  
Dust to locate, recover and deliver descended foreign space vehicles. 
ICGL #4, 25 April 1961, delineates collection responsibilities.  
 
DISCUSSION:    
 
6.  ___   
 
    a.  Headquarters USAF (AFCIN) maintains intelligence teams as a   
function of AFCIN-1E (1127th USAF Field Activities Group).  Personnel 
comprising such teams have normal AFCIN-1E staff duties, and their    
maintenance of qualification for intelligence team employment is in   
addition to their normal staff duties.   For example, the Chief of    
AFCIN-1E-OD, the Domestic Operations Section, additionally participates    
in approximately 18 hours of training per month for intelligence team 
employment.  Such training includes physical training, classroom combat    
intelligence training, airborne operations, field problems, etc.

           FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT DOCUMENT FILES   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    b.  Intelligence teams are comprised of three men each, to include
a linguist, a tech man, and an ops man.  All are airborne qualified.  
Cross-training is provided each team member in the skills of the other
team members to assure a team functional capability despite casualties
which may be incurred in employment.    
 
    c.  Peacetime employment of AFCIN intelligence team capability is 
provided for in UFO investigation (AFR 200-2) and in support of Air   
Force Systems Command (AFSC) Foreign Technology Division (FTD) Projects    
Moon Dust and Blue Fly.  These three peacetime projects all involve a 
potential for employment of qualified field intelligence personnel on 
a quick reaction basis to recover or perform field exploitation of    
unidentified flying objects, or known Soviet/Bloc aerospace vehicles, 
weapons systems, and/or residual componants of such equipment.  The   
intelligence team capability to gain rapid access, regardless of 
location, to recover or perform field exploitation, to communicate and
provide intelligence reports is the only such collection capability   
available to AFCIN, and is vitally necessary in view of current intelli-   
gence gaps concerning Soviet/Bloc technological capabilites.
 
    d.  Wartime employment of AFCIN intelligence team capability is   
currently primarily geared to the CONAD/NORAD air defense mission
(Atch I).  The intelligence team concept was originally developed
within the Air Defense Command (ADC).  The ADC Director of Intelligence    
was charged in 1953 with organizing the 4602d Air Intelligence Service
Squadron (AISS), with a wartime mission of exploiting downed enemy    
"people, paper, and hardware" for intelligence information that would 
contribute to the air defense of the continental US, and ADC was 
allocated manpower for this function (ADC Regulation 24-4, 3 Jan 53,  
Organization and Mission of the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron).  
 
    e.  As an economy move, the 201 spaces of the 4602d AISS were trans-   
ferred to AFCIN in July 1957 (Hq Comd General Order 46, dtd 8 Jul 57),
to provide manning for peacetime AFCIN functions, but with the contin-
gency that AFCIN would continue to maintain a capability to support   
CONAD/NORAD in the wartime people, paper, and hardware mission (Atchs 
2 and 3).  From the 194 spaces that AFCIN allocated to the 1006th AISS,    
activated by Hq Comd General Order #49, 2 Jul 57, this capability was 
provided for (Dept of AF ltr, dtd 16 Jul 59, subj: Mission of the 1006th   
AISS), and the capability has been maintained to the present time,    
through the redesignation of the 1006th to the 1127th USAF Field 
Activities Group (AFCIN Policy Ltr 205-13, 13 April 1960).  
 
    f.  The maintenance of the intelligence team capability over the  
four year period since inactivation of the 4602d AISS has been possible    
largely because members of the original highly select and trained 4602d    
personnel remained with the organization during its subsequent designa-    
tions.  _______________________________________________________________

______________________  In addition, a minimum number of new
personnel assigned to the organization and fortuitously possessing basic   
requisite skills, were further trained and integrated into the intelli-    
gence team program as additional duty.  
 
    g.  Manning of the intelligence teams from these sources has now  
reached the point of diminishing returns.  Only 21 qualified intelligence  
team personnel are now assigned, and of these approximately half are  
scheduled for PCS departure from the organization during the next 12  
months.  There is no forecast input of previously qualified personnel.
There are currently five basically qualified volunteers for further   
training and assignment to intelligence team additional duty.    
 
    h.  In an effort to augment the diminishing capability, USAF 
personnel assigned to organizations other than the 1127th within the  
Washington area who have airborne/intelligence team qualification, and/or  
who are former members of this organization's intelligence teams, and 
who have been approved by their organization of assignment and Hq USAF
(AFCIN) for wartime assignment to the 1127th, have been issued appro- 
priate orders, and participate in the peacetime training program for  
wartime employment.  Two such personnel are attached, with no known   
available additional personnel.    
 
    i.  The most serious immediate and forecast intelligence team
shortage  is in Linguists.  There are now only five Russion Linguists 
assigned or attached, and of these only two are of native fluency, with    
the other three of language school capability.  Four of the five,
including the two of native fluency, are forecast for PCS by November 
1962.  Only one gain, fortunately of native fluency, is scheduled for 
airborne training for intelligence team qualification and assignment. 
Two additional Russian Linguists are forecast for assignment to the   
1127th, but neither are yet intelligence team qualified or are known  
to be volunteers for intelligence team assignment.  All intelligence  
team personnel are volunteers.
 
    j.  ______________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________
Eight personnel in these categories are forecast for PCS loss within the   
next twelve months, with an input forecast of five personnel, four of 
whom are presently assigned, basically qualified volunteers for airborne   
training, and one of whom is a forecast gain to the 1127th. 
 
    k.  A sizeable number of qualified Linguists are presently assigned    
to _____________________________________________________________________   
_______ ZI bases.  Many of the Linguists are either airborne rated and/    
or have had intelligence team assignments to this organization in its 
present or former designations.  Reassignment of these individuals to 
AFCIN-1E upon completion of their present tours is a logical method by

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


 


Document #: 47
Subject: 1961 MOONDUST PAGE 5     


           FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT DOCUMENT FILES   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
which the current and forecast shortage could be met.  A problem that 
would be encountered in implementing such assignment is the lack of   
1127th Linguist AFSC manpower vacancies.  The 1127th has only twelve  
Linguist AFSC manpower spaces allocated and seven of these spaces are 
filled with either non-Russian/Bloc country Linguists or with non-    
intelligence team qualified Linguists.  
 
    1.  Possible solutions to the current and forecast shortage are:  
 
        (1)  Basically qualified personnel currently assigned to AFCIN-1E  
who volunteer for further training, to include airborne training, and 
assignment to intelligence teams, should be given such training and   
assignment as additional duty to normal staff duty employment.   
 
        (2)  Assignment to the 1127th of intelligence team qualified  
Linguists returning from overseas or completing other ZI assignments  
on an authorized overage basis.  Such authorized overages were previously  
assigned to the organization and provided not only for the intelligence    
team capability, but for fruitful peacetime ZI employment of Linguists.    
Ten such personnel could be fully and effectively utilized during peace-   
time in duties directly in or closely allied to their AFSC's, with the
intelligence team capability being an additional duty. 
 
        (3)  Qualified intelligence team personnel now assigned to the
1127th could be retained beyond their normal duty tours until a simi- 
larly qualified replacement is forecast or assigned.   
 
   e.  A standard AFPMP and AFCIN-P policy should be the identification    
to AFCIN-1E of previously qualified intelligence team personnel fore- 
cast for return to the ZI form overs3eas assignments for assignment   
against AFCIN-1E forecast personnel vacancies.  Latitude may be required   
and should be authorized in the assignment of such personnel be grade 
and AFSC.  For example, if a 204XX vacancy is forecast withing AFCIN-1E    
and an intelligence team qualified 203XX is forecast available, and the    
203XX is determined able to perform the staff duties required, either 
from personal knowledge of the individual's capabilities, or by means 
of an exchange of correspondence between the losing command and AFCIN-1E,  
authorization for asignment of the 203XX against the 204XX vacancy    
should be granted.  It is generally true that 203's with AISS background   
are normally able to perform 204 duties effectively with a minimum of 
experience on the job.  To a lesser degree, and on a selective basis, 
this is also true of 203's being able to perform intelligence organiza-    
tion 702 duties.    
 
   n.  Discussion to this point has covered the intelligence team
development, composition, current peacetime and wartime missions, and 
personnel problems.  To further establish the value of the unique
Air Force capability represented by the intelligence teams, their
future potential for employment should be considered.

CONCLUSION:    
 
7.  __ There is a valid current and continuing need for the AFCIN
intelligence team capability for peacetime and wartime employment.    
Actions necessary to maintain the capability in "cadre" strength 
should be immediately implemented, and actions to expand the capability    
should be implemented on a sound basis of personnel acquisition, 
training, equipping, and employment.    
 
ACTION RECOMMENDED: 
 
8.  ___   
 
    a.  Basically qualified personnel currently assigned to AFCIN-1E  
who volunteer for further training, to include airborne training, and 
assignment to intelligence teams, should be given such training and   
assignment as additional duty to normal staff duty employment.  Attach-    
ment 4 is a current request for airborne training quotas for five
qualified volunteers.    
 
    b.  AFCIN-1E should prepare, and submit through appropriate channels,  
individual justifications for the following: 
 
        (l)  Authorized overage assignment on a selective basis of an 
initial ten intelligence team qualified Linguists returning to the ZI 
from overseas assignment, with a later additional supplement in the   
event of AFCIN authorized expansion of cadre strength of the intelligence  
team capability.    
 
        (2)  Detention beyond normal duty tours of qualified intelligence  
team personnel now assigned to the 1127th until similarly qualified   
replacements are forecast or assigned.  
 
        (3)  Request for establishment of an AFPMP and AFCIN-P practice    
to identify to AFCIN-1E previously qualified intelligence team personnel   
forecast for return to the ZI from overseas assignments.  Latitude should  
be requested by AFCIN-1E in assignment of such personnel against actual    
or forecast vacancies in AFSC and grade spaces in variance with those 
possessed by the returnees if it is established that returnees have non-   
AFSC skills which can be effectively utilized in the vacant spaces.   
 
        (4)  Ninety-day TDY of AFCIN intelligence team to South Viet Nam   
for employment in Viet Nam/Laos against USAF intelligence requirements.    
Experience gained in establishing logistical support and operational  
employment will be invaluable in developing further plans for intelligence 
team utilization.  The team should be attached to the Air Attache, Viet    
Nam, and under his operational control for the period of TYD.

Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)                              20 OCT 1969 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SUMMARY   
1.  For more than twenty years the Air Force has had the responsibility    
within the Department of Defense for the investigation of unidentified
flying objects (UFOs) (Atch 2).  As stated in Project Blue Book, this 
investigative program has two objectives:    
 
   a.  To determine whether UFOs pose a threat to the security of the 
United States: and  
 
   b.  To determine whether UFOs exhibit any unique scientific information 
or advanced technology which could contribute to scientific or technical   
research (Atch 3).  
 
Procedures for Project Blue Book reporting are defined in Air Force   
Regulation 80-17.  This regulation requires the Commander of an Air Force  
base to provide a UFO investigative capability and for Air Force Systems   
Command to continue Project Blue Book (Atch 4).  In response to this  
regulation most Commanders have appointed a UFO investigating officer,
usually as an additional duty.  Project Blue Book has two officers, are    
NCO and are civilian assigned on a full-time basis.  In addition, Dr. A.   
J. Hynek served as a scientific consultant until 1 July 1969.    
 
2.  In 1966 the Air Force Office of Scientific Research contracted to have 
the University of Colorado conduct an independent scientific investigation 
of unidentified flying objects.  This study, directed by Dr. Edward U.
Condon and made available as the "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying  
Objects," serves as a basis for evaluating the Air Force investigative
effort (Atch 5).  After an extensive study of this report as well as the   
review of the report by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, past  
studies, Project Blue Book operations and other inputs, the Office of 
Aerospace Research concluded, and we agree, that the continuation of  
Project Blue Book cannot be justified, either on the ground of national    
security or in the interest of science (Atch 6).  
 
3.  The general conclusion of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying  
Objects is that "nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21    
years that has added to scientific knowledge."  As to what the federal
government should do with the UFO reports it receives from the general
public, the authors add that they are "inclined to think that nothing 
should be done with them in the expectation that they are going to    
contribute to the advance of science."  A panel of the National Academy    
of Sciences concurred in these views, and the Air Force has found no  
reason to question this

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
conclusion.  For example, it has been the Air Force that although a   
significant portion of the Air Force's environmental research program is   
concerned with natural phenomena that could be associated with unidentified
flying objects (Atch 7), Project Blue Book reports have not added any 
useful data to these research efforts (Atch 6).  Thus, we concur with the  
University of Colorado recommendation "that only so much attention to the  
subject should be given as the Department of Defense deems to be necessary 
strictly from a defense point of view." 
 
4.  As early as 1953, the Robertson Panel concluded "that the evidence
presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication that these    
phenomena constitute a direct physical threat to national security" (Atch  
9).  In spite of this finding, the Air Force continued to maintain a  
special reporting system.  There is still, however, no evidence that  
Project Blue Book reports have served any intelligence function (Atch 8).  
Moreover, reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect   
national security are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force  
Manual 55-11, and are not part of the Blue Book system (Atch 10).  The
Air Force experience therefore confirms the impression of the University   
of Colorado researchers "that the defense function could be performed 
withing the framework established for intelligence and surveillance   
operations without the continuance of a special unit such as Project  
Blue Book."    
 
5.  The conclusion which follows is that Project Blue Book does not merit  
future expenditures of resources.  Accordingly, we recommend that it be    
terminated and that the actions which follow from this decision, such as   
cancelling Air Force Regulation 80-17 and not renewing the consultant 
contract, be initiated.  Termination of Project Blue Book would have no    
adverse effect on Air Force operations or research programs.  It would
free manpower for useful purposes, eliminate the need for scientific  
consultant and relieve base commanders of a minor responsibility and an    
administrative burden.   
 
6.  Termination of Project Blue Book would leave no official federal  
office to receive reports of UFOs.  However, as already stated, reports    
of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled  
through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.  
Presumably, local police departments respond to reports which fall within  
their responsibilities.  Similarly, as to scientific research, the    
Colorado researchers conclude that, although they do not see "any
fruitful lines of advance from the study of UFO reports, we believe that   
any scientist with adequate training and credentials who does come up 
with a clearly defined, specific proposal for study should be supported."  
We see no reason why the normal channels and criteria for the funding of   
scientific research should not be adequate for UFO-related research.  
 
7.  Some feel that a central reporting center should be established, and a 
proposal has been made to establish a Rare Atmospheric Pehnomena Reporting 
Center (Atch 11 and 12).  Because the problem affects a number of
agencies, this center might be under the auspices of the Federal Council   
on Science and Technology.  However, in the light of the University of
Colorado recommendation  
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  

Document #: 56
Subject: 1969 BOLENDER MEMO PG. 3 

 
            FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT DOCUMENT FILES  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
that the federal government should not set up a major new agency for the   
scientific study of UFOs, we do not favor this suggestion and feel that    
UFO reports should be left to normal scientific and defense channels. 
If such a center is established, it should not perform an investigative    
function and should be initiated only on a trial basis for a specified
lifetime. 
 
8.  Project Blue Book has accumulated records on over 13,000 sighting 
cases.  During his study, Dr. Condon expressed concern about the possible  
loss of these records and their relative inaccessibility at Wright-   
Patterson Air Force Base.  He was assured by Secretary Brown that we would 
look into the feasibility and desirability of relocating the files in the  
Washington area and that no action would be taken until the Colorado  
report was released (Atch 13).  If Project Blue Book is terminated, the    
records should be transferred to an appropriate archive and preserved for  
historical value and to prevent charges that the Air Force is concealing   
facts.    
 
9.  To receive the candor and cooperation essential to the successful 
investigation of UFOs, the Air Force adopted a practice of confidentiality 
witnesses were assured that their names would not be used without their    
___________(Atch 14).  Therefore, access to these records and the
publications _____________________ access must be carefully reviewed and   
controlled.  SAFOI feels that an Air Force controlled archive away from    
the Washington, D.C. area is the most appropriate storage facility.   
Considering the existence of local, privately sponsored UFO investigative  
organizations, the ready availability of these records in the Washington   
area would result in an inordinate workicad in clearing investigators,
providing documentation, and reviewing and clearing manuscripts. 
Therefore, the Air University was queried about the possibility of    
storing these documents at the Air Force Archives (Atch 15).  Air Force    
Air University will acept these records providing:
 
   a.  SAFOI will answer all requests about Blue Book, and not require AU  
research to answer such queries.   
 
   b.  SAFOI will rigidly limit the right of access to recognized,    
legitimate researchers, and   
 
   c.  SAFOI will screen researcher's notes to insure that  
"confidentiality" is maintained (Atch 16).   
 
10.  Project Blue Book should be terminated, and Blue Book records should  
be transferred to the USAF Archives at Air University.  The attached  
memorandum would initiate these actions.
 
RECOMMENDATION 
 
11.  That the memorandum be signed.

The Honorable John Glenn 
United States Senate
ATTN: Mr. Mark Frondorf  
SH-503 Hart Senate Office Building 
Washington, DC 20510
 
 
Dear Senator Glenn: 
 
      This responds to your letter of 7 January 1987 on behalf   
of your constituent, Mr. Clifford E. Stone ( Enclosure 1 ). 
 
      The National Security Agency (NSA) has received numerous   
Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) requests for information  
pertaining to UFO incidents.  Our records show that Mr. Stone    
has submitted six such requests over the past 7 years.  One of   
those requests was for the information mentioned in paragraph 2  
of his letter to you, the UFO incident at RAF Woodbridge Base.   
In our 1 February 1984 response to Mr. Stone ( Enclosure 2 ), we 
notified him that the estimated manpower and computer search
costs involved in locating records responsive to his requests    
were $250.00.  We advised him that, upon receipt of half that    
amount, a search would be made.  Mr. Stone did not respond to    
our letter.    
 
     Regarding the information in paragraph 1 of Mr. Stone's
letter, we have no record of receiving an FOIA requests for 
documents dealing with a UFO destruction of a Cuban MiG-23. 
 
     Paragraph 3 of his letter ask for NSA analysis of the  
document he attached.  It appears to be an Air Force document.   
The project names which are referenced, Sigma and Snowbird, are  
not NSA projects.  We have no knowledge of the information  
contained in the document.    
 
    The subject of paragraph 4, project Aquarius, has been the   
subject of numerous FOIA requests.  Apparently there is or was   
an Air Force project by that name which dealt with UFO's.   
Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project by that name.  The  
NSA project does not deal with UFO's.  We believe that the  
confusion on this issue results from an FOIA requests submitted  
by another person with interest in UFOs, Mr. Christian Lambright.

      Mr. Lambright requested all information on the NSA project 
Aquarius, apparently believing that the project pertain to UFOs. 
We advised Mr. Lambright that our project does not deal with UFOs.    
He then requested records revealing the "goal" of Aquarius, and we    
withheld the document because it is classified.  We have reason to    
believe that our final response to Mr. Lambright, denying him access  
to the records, has been disseminated within a circle of those   
interested in UFOs and that subsequently a misunderstanding has  
developed regarding NSA, Aquarius and UFOs.  
 
     In responding to general FOIA requests for UFO information, 
certain documents have been withheld from the public pursuant to the  
first and third exemptions of the FOIA.  The first exemption
provides for the protection of information which is currently and
properly classified in accordance with the provisions of Executive    
Order 12356.   The third exemption protects information from
disclosure by statute.  The statutes applicable in this case are 
50 U.S.C. 402 note ( Public Law 86-36, Section 6 ), 50 U.S.C. 403(d)  
(3) and 18 U.S.C. 798.  This Agency's decision to protect those  
records has been upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia.
 
     We hope that the information being providrd to you will be  
of help to Mr. Stone.
