SUBJECT: THE JOHN SEARL STORY                                FILE: UFO2531









Dear Bill
         I have interviewed Prof John RR Searl, on three occaisions. 
 His last major public appearance was at the Glastonbury Symposium,
 held by the University Of Avalon.Aug 94.

John Searl has been betrayed, and imprisoned, due to a jealous wife,
when he was nominated for Knighthood.

Most of his previous data was destroyed but he is now licencing companies
to produce the Searl generator. This generator could be made to power a
small town.

This is Searl's Invention, and it is time he was fully credited,
and we started to use it in a BIG WAY.  It is the first prime mover,
invented since the electric motor.

Searl is scathing about his technology being ripped off in a half baked
version after he let out too much to Professor Laithwaite,  who applied some
of the principles.  Searl is now making his technology available,  under
controled release to industry,  under licence.

If you want video of Searl, send an E240 (S-VHS if you wish),  and return
postage.  I can send NTSC.

Richard Hoagland of the Mars mission has shown interest in the development
of an idependent Mars probe, using Searl's technology.  This probe would cost
$100 million to build and send, and then it can be used again.

Mission time to Mars unmanned would be a minimum time of 2 months.
If continuous contact is not required, then the probe could get to Mars
much faster. The limiting factor being travelling to Mars at a speed  which
does not cause too much of a frequency shift. Initial take off in the dense
atmosphere has to be slow, so that field, and gravity effects do not cause
damage to the ground.  If it took off at full acceleration, it could rip a
chunk of dirt  out of the ground the size of a small town.

Full acceleration The device runs at 4 Kelvin, and generates a field around
the disc which dispels atmosphere and any other mass. So the prospect of
being hit by space junk,  attacking missiles etc, does not arise.

The intention is to transmit back using laser beams, at fantastic power,
so that any radio amateur with the right gear can pick up the signal.

A three manned flight, using a 500 foot disc, would take $200 million.
Due to the failures of previous probes, sending TWO craft is being
recommended  by Miles Johnston, who is in contact with Searl and Hoagland.

The intention is to build the craft at Belfast plane makers SHORTS. However
there is a long way to go yet. The craft can be built in about 18 months.

Tests by Searl, on craft he flew to earth orbit, in the 1960s, show that
any traveler would have no sensation of flight, and have the benefit of
0.5G, of gravity on board the craft.

Communications would be received and transmitted through the central part
of the craft.

The device was invented by Searl in the 1940s, and constructed using home
materials, and special metals, of 99.9% purity, in his kitchen at his home.
The original generator kept taking off, and hit the ceiling. The effect is
electrogravitic.

Application of this can be applied to matter and time transmission.
Full applications of this technology will make Star Trek look like a
Sunday School picnic. (NOTE:- the Star Trek, disc part of the Enterprize,
is a Searl Disc, but you don't need the Warp Engines)

His full story is published in a series of full format (A4), books,
whicich are available from the US, at $50/60 each.  There are ten so far.

LICENCING FOR GENERATOR MANUFACTURE:- CONTACT MILES JOHNSTON FOR DETAILS.

INDEPENDENT MARS MISSION:- MANNED OR UNMANNED PROBE:- CONTACT MILES JOHNSTON.

Any Company or VERY Rich Multi Pound Backer:- Contact Miles Johnston:-
ITS TIME WE WENT TO MARS AND THE MOON, TOOK OUR OWN PICTURES,
AND FOUND OUT WHAT NASA WILL NOT TELL US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MANNED FLIGHT TO MARS:- $200MILLION.
UNMANNED FLIGHT TO MARS:-$70-100MILLION.



POLE SHIFT:- The next expected Pole Shift will occur, on or about May 5th
2000, it could be as late as 2003, or any time between now and then. This
will knock out all present means of electrical power generation. Only the
Searl generator will keep on going.

.(Miles Johnston is not representing Searl in any way.
 I have interviewed him, and want to let as many people know as possible
 about his invention.
