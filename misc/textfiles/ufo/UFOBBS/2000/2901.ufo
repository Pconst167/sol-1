Hi,

Let me try and answer a few questions on the Famed "AREA 51"

First off "AREA 51" is only a grid on a map and not a installation.
The facility at Groom Dry Lake NV. is located with in Grid/Area 51 of
the Desert MOA and was given the name "AREA 51" by a ufologist or and
Aviation buff. Some of the workers at the facility call it The Ranch,
The Box, The Zone, but, most just call it The Test Site.  Rachel, NV.
is located about 25 miles NNE. of "AREA 51"on HWY 375 and is home to The
Little A-le-Inn [Little Alien] bar and grill.

The facility called S-4 located at papoose Dry Lake is about 10 miles
WSW. of "51" The is the facility where Lazar claims to have worked on
UFOS.  Unlike "51" the Govt does acknowledge the existence of a facility
called S-4 but to my knowlage  will not say anymore the that.  Presently
The Air Force is trying to take control of 3,900 acers of public land so
that they denie access to a White Sides Mnt.  This is a good sopt to
look down on the facility a Groom Lake.  I do not know why thay wish to
do this as in 1994 the The Open Skies Treaty will be in force allowing
overflying of the area by other Govts. Satelite photos are for sale from
different sorces, inc. the U.S. Govt. If you would like more info the
this please let me know and I will get you the address. Please let me
know if I can answer any other questions.

Regards,
Michael
