SUBJECT: COMPLETE TEXT OF: JOINT ARMY-NAVY-AIR FORCE PUBLICATION

FILE: UFO2101


This file contains the complete text of: Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Publication 
(JANAP 146(E)),  CANADIAN - UNITED STATES COMMUNICATIONS INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
REPORTING VITAL INTELLIGENCE SIGHTINGS (CERVIS/MERINT) as released on February 
28, 1994 by the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense.  

The regulation is complete including "change No. 2", promulgated May 17, 1977.
Only ten of the 33 pages (not including blank pages) are the "original" 
JANAP 146(E), the remaining 23 pages are as "Change No. 2".

JANAP 146 is important for a couple of reasons:

        1. It is mentioned in the "Bollender Memo" (dated 1969) as being one of 
the "reporting channels" by which UFO reports which are matters of national 
security are reported; UFO reports "not part of the Blue Book system".  

        2. This copy is dated 1977 and still bears "Unidentified flying 
objects" as one of the items which must be reported despite protestations by 
virtually every agency queried that ther has been no interest in UFOs since the 
USAF Project Blue Book closed in 1969.

Some hand written notes appear in the released pages, and some typed text is 
crossed out generally by a single hand drawn line.  This information has been 
retained:  

1.  [ Text in [ ] brackets is crossed out in original ]

2.  { Text in curly brackets { } is hand written in original }

3.  _Text enclosed with underscores _ _ is underlined in original

4.  { |}, {| }, or {|} indicates bars drawn in margin (presumably 
     indicating areas of additional change)

201. _Information to be Reported and When to Report._

      a. Sightings within the scope of this chapter, as outlined in
paragraphs 102b(1), (2), (6) and (7), are to be reported as follows:

           (1)  While airborne and from land based observers.

                (a) Hostile or unidentified single aircraft or formations
of aircraft which appear to be directed against the United States or
Canada or their forces.

                (b)  Missiles.

                (c)  Unidentified flying objects.

                (d)  Hostile or unidentified submarines.

                (e) Hostile or unidentified group or groups of military
surface vessels.

                (f) Individual surface vessels, submarines, or aircraft
of unconventional design, or engaged in suspicious activity or observed
in a location or on a course which may be interpreted as constituting
a threat to the United States, Canada or their forces.

                (g) Any unexplained or unusual activity which may indicate
a possible attack against or through Canada or the United States, includ-
ing the presence of any unidentified or other suspicious ground parties
in the Polar Region or other remote or sparsely populated areas.

           (2)  Upon landing.

                 (c) Any airborne, seaborne, ballistic or orbiting
{|  }object which, the observer feels, may constitute a military threat
{|  }against the US or Canada, or may be of interest to military and civilian
{|  }government officials.

                            _SECTION II - PROCEDURES_

202.  _General._

      a. Communications procedures to be employed will be basically
those prescribed for the communications system or service used. Con-
tinuing efforts will be made by an aircraft originating a CIRVIS report
to insure that each CIRVIS message is received by an appropriate station.

      b. Every attempt will be made to verify the authenticity of
CIRVIS reports. Where possible, authentication will be required.

{|  }      c. The US Air Force, Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), for
{|  }such matters is the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence (AFIN),
{|  }Washington, DC 20330.

203. _Precedence (priority of transmission)._

      a.  To avoid delays by aircraft in rendering a CIRVIS report to a
ground facility, the word "CIRVIS" spoken or transmitted three (3) times
will be employed, preceding the call, to clear the frequency(ies) over
all other communications, except DISTRESS and URGENCY, to insure its
expeditious handling.

      b.  Should instances occur, when use of the above procedure fails
to clear the frequency(ies) over all other communications in progress
except as provided for in 203a, the International Urgency Signal "XXX"
transmitted three (3) times or "PAN" spoken three (3) times will be
employed to facilitate disposition of the message to the receiving faci-
lity.

      c.  When filing or refiling CIRVIS messages with commercial communi-
cations companies, US Government activities will use commercial class of
service designator XV GOVT/EMERGENCY, Canadian Government activities will
use commercial class of service designator RUSH.

     d. The following precedence will be employed in the transmission
of all CIRVIS reports, as appropriate, commensurate with the communica-
tions facilities used:

         Circuit clearance               CIRVIS CIRVIS CIRVIS

made to the nearest Canadian or United States military or diplomatic
representative in that area. The post-landing report will refer to the
airborne report(s) and, in addition, contain a brief resume of weather
conditions at the time of sighting(s), verification of the sighting(s)
by other personnel and any other information deemed appropriate. If the
sighting was identified as friendly and a report so stating was filed
while airborne, no post-landing report is required.

          (1) If no airborne report was made as a result of inability
to reach a Canadian or United States communications station, the post
landing report will contain all the information available concerning
the sighting.

206. _Addressing._

      a. Aircraft. - It is imperative that all CIRVIS reports reach
the appropriate military commands as quickly as possible. The reports,
therefore, shall be transmitted as soon as possible after the sighting.
Ground procedures have been established to handle CIRVIS reports by
Canadian-United States military and civil communications facilities, so
the same procedures as those now established and in use by pilots for
air traffic control shall be followed. When contact by civil or military
pilots cannot be established with any ground communications station,
maximum effort shall be made to relay the CIRVIS reports via other air
craft with which communication is possible.

                         {* Detachment Commander, AIRCOMHQ Detachment, }

       a. Amplifying Reports. -

          (1) When additional information becomes available to any
       observer and is of importance, it is to be
       transmitted as a "MERINT AMPLIFY" report.

                                 3-3                         ORIGINAL

 =============================================================================
                                                                JANAP 146 (E)

          (2) Amplifying reports are to be handled in the
      same way as the original report except that the first 
      two words of the text will be "MERINT AMPLIFY" followed
      by the date and time of filing of the MERINT report
      being amplified.                
   
          (3) Amplifying reports on aerial objects normally 
      consist of additional information pertaining to the
      sighted object's size; shape; description of jet or 
      rocket streams; color; sound; if multiple objects, the 
      number; type; method of propulsion; number of engines; 
      insignia and estimated speed.

           (4)  Amplifying reports on submarines or surface 
      sightings normally consist of additional information 
      on the state of sea and weather, including visibility; 
      actions of object (course, speed, evasive maneuvers, 
      etc.); identification marks, (flags, signals, numbers, 
      exchange of communication); closest range at which 
      object observed; any further remarks, (dived, surfaced, 
      commenced snorkeling, stopped snorkeling, etc.)

      b. _Cancellation Reports._-

           (1)  Cancellation reports should be made in the 
      event a previously reported sighting is positively 
      identified as friendly, erroneous or false.

           (2)  MERINT cancellations are to be handled in the 
      same manner as the original MERINT report except that 
      the first two words shall be "MERINT CANCEL" followed 
      by the date and time of filing of the MERINT report 
      being cancelled and, in brief, the information on 
      which the cancellation is based.

       c. _Delayed Reports._- In the event a MERINT report 
cannot be made by radio, the Master is requested to report 
the details of the MERINT sightings to the appropriate 
Canadian or United States military authorities. If the 
port of arrival is outside of Canada or USA, the report is 
to be made to the nearest Canadian or US military or dip-
lomatic representative in the area. This report should 
be submitted immediately upon arrival in port by any
available means and should be in the format prescribed 
in paragraph 304.  If photographs were taken and have not
already been forwarded, they should be forwarded as in-
dicated in paragraph 104 as soon as possible after reaching

                               3-4                   ORIGINAL

instructions.

      b. Communications Stations. Communications stations (to include
any commercial, government or military facility such as coastal marine
radio station, telegraph office, naval or coast guard shore radio station
or any other communications facility) receiving MERINT reports will
immediately after receipting process the report as follows:

           (1) Canadian or US commercial or government communications
stations will handle MERINT reports received from either vessels or
other communications stations by immediately forwarding them to a Canadian
or US military fixed communication facility as prescribed by agreement
with the appropriate military commander.

           (2) US military fixed communications stations receiving
MERINT reports on sightings in overseas areas will forward the report
