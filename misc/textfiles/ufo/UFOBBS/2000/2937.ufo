Dear Fellow Researchers,

I am writing you today to ask for your help.

Please write your Congressperson, Senators, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit
asking that they STOP the seizure of the Groom Mountain Range in Nevada.

The proposed seizure of 3,900 acres just outside the famed Area 51 is just one
more ploy by the military to make themselves unaccountable to anyone!  Hell,
the Base Commander is not allowed into Area 51.

If the Base Commander, Congress or Senators can not keep tabs on them, then we
as Americans MUST!  Nellis AFB. and the Test Site that surrounds it now covers
some 3.1 million acres.  What could they possibly do with 3,900 more acres that
they can't do with the more then 3 million acres that they already have?  Deny
people access to public land? Put an end to the checks and balance system of
govenment?

While the military must have secrets, it is also true me as citizens must have
a right to free access to public land.  The military should not be able to
seive land for no other reason then to keep people off of a mountain.  If the
military were to use the land for a visitors center or a golf course then I
would have no problem with the seizure.

Please help make YOUR military accountable before it's too Late.

Write your government officials today!


Regards,
Michael.
