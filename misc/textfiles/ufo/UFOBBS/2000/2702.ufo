         #2  The Hill Abduction Case, 1961, source: Interrupted Journey

    SEPT.  18-19 [Sept.  19-20] Barney and Betty Hill abducted in the White 
    Mountains  of New Hampshire.  They remember part of the experience  but 
    have over 2 hours of "missing time,"  of which they are totally unaware 
    at  first.   Barney remembers seeing huge object with  "fins  with  red 
    lights  on  the ends"  and "crew members behind glass"  panels at  very 
    short range.  This object was more than 100  feet across and hovered 50 
    feet  above  the ground only 300  feet away for several minutes  Barney 
    watched through binoculars.  SEPT.  20  Betty Hill calls her sister and 
    tells  her part of the story.  Sister then calls a local physicist  who 
    suggested  they  check for radiation.  Sister also calls  local  police 
    chief who suggests they call Pease AFB,  Portsmouth,  N.H.  Betty calls 
    the Air Force Base,  worried about radiation.  The officer who  answers 
    was at first "cynical and unresponsive"  but finally did ask to talk to 
    Barney.   After  Barney mentioned the "fins with lights"   the  officer 
    perked up and said the call was being "monitored". Barney felt that the 
    officer was definitely interested.  Barney did not mention the  figures 
    he had seen behind the glass through binoculars.  SEPT.  21  Major Paul 
    Anderson,   Intelligence Officer for the 100th Bomb Group,  Pease  AFB, 
    calls back, says he has stayed up all night working on a report of this 
    incident.   Asked  Barney for the size of the object.  Barney  says  it 
    appeared as big as a dinner plate held at arms length.  Major  Anderson 
    filed a report with Blue Book,  #100-1-61. SEPT. 23 Betty [Barney] Hill 
    Goes to the local Library and finds one of Major Donald Keyhoe's  books 
    on UFOs.  Takes down his address. SEPT. 26  Betty Hill writes to Keyhoe 
    in  Washington,   D.C.,  describing the incident as she  remembers  it. 
    Fuller  reports that NICAP (Keyhoe's organization)  was getting  40,000 
    letters a year. SEPT. 30  Ten days after the sighting Betty Hill begins 
    to  have a series of vivid and awesome dreams,  which Fuller  does  not 
    tell us about. They continue for five days and then stop. OCT. 4 Keyhoe 
    is  asked  to lunch by Robert Hohman and someone named  C.D.   Jackson, 
    "senior engineer"  for a "notable electronics company",  name withheld. 
    They are supposedly working on a paper about extra-terrestrial contacts 
    that  Nikola  Tesla,   David  Todd and Marconi  were  alleged  to  have 
    experienced in the early part of the century.  Keyhoe tells them  about 
    the Hills.  OCT. 21 Walter Webb, investigtaor for Keyhoe's NICAP and an 
    astronomer  [lec-turer] with the Hayden Planetarium,  New York,   N.Y., 
    comes to interview the Hills. He is there several hours. Betty does not 
    tell him about her dreams.  Barney tells of the "captain" and others he 
    saw through the glass. OCT. 25? Betty begins to have a series of dreams 
    following an experience in the car.  She had panicked as she and Barney 
    had  come  upon a stalled auto in the road with  some  people  standing 
    around it.  That night she dreamed of being taken into a UFO and  given 
    some  sort  of examination.  OCT.  26  Webb's report goes to  NICAP  in 
    Washington.   He had not been contacted by Keyhoe directly but  through 
    the mail by Richard Hall,  NICAP's secretary. He had been skeptical. He 
    was  very much impressed by the Hills,  however.  NOV.  3   Hohman  and 
    Jackson  write the Hills asking for an interview.  They tell the  Hills 
    that  they are serious minded men whose interest is in  "verifying  the 
    origin  of  these  vehicles  according to  existing  scientific  theory 
    maintained by Hermann Oberth." Oberth was of V-2 rocket fame.  They did 
    not reveal their place of employment but permission was granted.   NOV. 
    25  Hohman and Jackson come to the house to interview the Hills.  "Also 
    visiting that day"  is Major James McDonald, a  long-time friend of the 
    Hills  and  an Air Force intelligence officer.  It appears he  asks  no 
    questions about who Homan and Jackson are. The Hills had "discussed the 
    case many times with Maj.  McDonald." The three of them spend 12  hours 
    talking to the Hills about their experience, including the "men" behind 
    the  glass.   Major  McDonald suggests hypnosis but does not  know  any 
    therapists. The matter rests here for some time. Both Hills begin to be 
    concerned  about  the  incident  and  the chance  they  may  have  been 
    hallucinating. MAR., 1962  Betty Hill writes to a doctor recommended by 
    a  colleague.   The Hills see him and tell their stories.   The  doctor 
    recommends  they wait and see if the problem subsides on its  own.   No 
    therapy is attempted.  SUMMER, 1962 Barney begins to see a psychiatrist 
    about  his anxiety but only briefly mentions the UFO incident.   SEPT., 
    1962   The Hills are invited to a "UFO Study Group"  to informally talk 
    about their experience. That meeting is taped,  by whom Fuller does not 
    say, unknown to the Hills. Betty talked of her dreams, the dream of the 
    physical  examination.   SEPT.,   1963   The Hills  tell  their  church 
    discussion  group  about the UFO inci-dent.  That same day Captain  Ben 
    Swett, from Pease AFB, was to talk about hyp-nosis, which he had made a 
    personal  hobby of his.  The Hills are encouraged by Major McDonald  to 
    talk to their church friends about their experience and en-couraged  by 
    Capt.   Swett  to  undergo hypnosis.  Barney  is  experiencing  extreme 
    psychological  disturbances  as  a  result  of  the  UFO  sighting  and 
    abduction. He would die in the late 1960's at the age of 46. Television 
    movie THE UFO INCIDENT with James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.   Dr. 
    Simon  had  been technical advisor on a WWII movie made by John  Huston 
    called LET THERE BE LIGHT. JUNE, 1964 Sessions with Dr. Simon end. FALL 
    [Oct.],   1965  Sensational articles run in Boston newspaper about  the 
    Hills experience.  Information taken from tape made at the Sept.,  1962 
    "UFO Study Group"  meeting,  provenance unknown. NOV.,  1965  Unitarian 
    Church  in  Dover,  N.H.,  invites the Hills to talk.  Hills meet  with 
    Admiral Knowles, NICAP, before they speak.  Also on program is a Public 
    Information Officer from Pease, AFB, who is a member of the Church [not 
    a  church member] and has helped set up the event.  He does not  attack 
    the  Hills.  At this time a huge UFO flap was underway in the area  and 
    hundreds  of people were turned away from the church on a cold and  raw 
    evening.   The usual attendance for the weekly Unitarian sessions:   40 
    people. 
     
    AS  YOU CAN SEE from the simple chronology above (assembled  from  John 
    Fuller's book with difficulty)  there is more going on in the Hill case 
    than meets the eye.  WHO WERE "HOMANN and C.D. Jackson?"  Who were they 
    really working for?  Why was a "major electronics firm"  paying them to 
    investigate   60-year-old  fairy  tales  about  Nikola   Tesla?    What 
    "scientific theories" held by Hermann Oberth could be of interest to an 
    "electronics  firm."   What  we actually have here is  a  "cover"   for 
    intelligence  activity.  IN ALIENS FROM SPACE,  1973,  Keyhoe says that 
    these two "engineers"  were "aiding NICAP."  That is not the impression 
    that  is  given  in Fuller's book.  In INTERRUPTED JOURNEY  the  strong 
    impression  is  that  these two gentlemen  simply  had  an  independent 
    interest due to a strange research assignment from their company.  This 
    could be accepted in 1966. In 1990 we know better. YOU SEE, by the fall 
    of  1963   a  gentleman named C.D.  Jackson was working  for  Time/Life 
    Corporation  in  an executive position.  In fact,  he  was  helping  to 
    arrange  a $25,000  payment to the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald.  IN CASE 
    YOU HAVE forgotten, Time/Life bought the Zapruder Film for $150,000 and 
    then made sure it was not shown as a film for many years. Then, when it 
    was shown, it had been obviously altered. David Lifton in BEST EVIDENCE 
    says  that  the film was at the CIA's photo interpretation lab the  day 
    Time/Life  bought it.  DOES THE FACT THAT Donald Keyhoe had lunch  with 
    C.D.   Jackson just after getting Betty Hill's letter "resonate"   with 
    you?   It  does with this author.  Donald Keyhoe was,   in  UFOsearch's 
    opinion,   running a two-track operation.  In the public and  with  his 
    organization he was not interested in "contactee"  stories. But on deep 
    background  he was involved with another investigation,  one  connected 
    with the intelligence community.  Were they running him? CONSIDER THIS. 
    In  ALIENS FROM SPACE Keyhoe says that "A well-known journalist,   John 
    Fuller, had learned of the case in a confidential talk at NICAP. It was 
    arranged  that  he should prepare the record using Dr.   Simon's  taped 
    questions  and  the  Hill's answers."  Then Keyhoe  says:   INTERRUPTED 
    JOURNEY  received a surprising amount of serious attention compared  to 
    the usual treatment of "contactee stories."  How interesting.  YES--AND 
    THE  "abduction  story"  has become a staple of the  UFO  investigator. 
    Indeed,  the sanitized Hill story became the ONLY abduction movie  ever 
    made --- before COMMUNION, 1989. And the Hill saga appeared only on the 
    small screen,  it never ran in theaters.  The same could almost be said 
    for  COMMUNION which was not widely distributed and died a  very  quick 
    death.  It will be in video stores by mid-1990  which, I think,  is the 
    idea.  OTHER QUESTIONS:  How did it happen that one of the Hill's  best 
    friends  was an Air Force Intelligence Officer who just happened to  be 
    visiting  the  day  that  Hohman  and  Jackson  showed  up?   Isn't  it 
    interesting  that they were the ones who first made the Hills aware  of 
    their "missing time?"  Isn't it interesting that they were the ones who 
    suggested hypnosis? ISN'T IT INTERESTING that the man finally called in 
    to  do  the regressions on the Hills was the Executive officer  of  the 
    Army's  main  psychiatric  hospital during World War II,  who  did  his 
    undergraduate work at Johns Hopkins University whose wartime  president 
    was  a member of MAJESTIC-12  and who was the technical advisor on  the 
    major WWII propaganda film made by the famous director John Huston? The 
    Hills went through two other therapists before going to Simon. Did they 
    have  the money to pay this gentlemen,  who must have been very,   very 
    expensive? This is something Fuller does not talk about.  Did NICAP pay 
    their way? UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITY The Hills were "set up" by the people 
    dealing with the so-called "Greys" out in New Mexico. The Hill case was 
    either  a  deep-cover check on what the "Greys"  were doing  under  the 
    "agreement"  or it was an even deeper-cover attempt at "disinformation" 
    to get "abductions" in play--safely.
