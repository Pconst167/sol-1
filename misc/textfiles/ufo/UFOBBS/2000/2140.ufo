     At  the onset of this article I would like to say a word  of
appreciation  to  those of you who have shared  your  fascinating
experiences  with me.  The overwhelming interest  and  enthusiasm
you've  displayed  in UFO "phenomenon" has  made  obtaining  this
information a pleasure.
     As   was  the  case  in  my  opening  article,  this  is   a
presentation  of information collected in the Anza  area.   Names
will  once again be withheld and I will continue to  update  with
any new information that becomes available in future issues.
     The most recent reported sightings are as follows:

June 4, 1989 -- 10:00 P.M.:  A brilliant blue light was seen by a
Cary Road teenager in the proximity of the Laborers' School.   It
was  observed  in  a stationary position for  10  minutes  before
speeding  to the east and out of sight.  This may seem to  be  an
insignificant  accounting  but it coincided  with  the  following
experience.

June  4, 1989 -- 7:50 P.M.:  A 25 year old female  was  traveling
down  Cahuilla Mountain after a visit with friends.  She  recalls
reaching a certain area and has no memory beyond that point.
     Her  next conscious recollection was a brilliant blue  flash
of  light  speeding across the sky toward the  desert.   She  was
disoriented  and  found  herself to be in a remote  area  of  the
mountain at about 10:00 o'clock the same night.
     She experienced a two hour time loss.
     After  discussing this experience at length we went back  to
the mountain hoping to jar something in her memory.
     What  we did jar were her emotions.  She remains uneasy  and
confused about the loss of time.

June  10, 1989 -- 4:15 A.M.:  A 31 year old Bautista  Road  woman
remembers  going to bed June 9th at approximately 9:30 P.M.   Her
next  conscious  recollection  was at 4:15  A.M.  June  10.   She
remembered a briliant flash of light and found herself in an open
field  about 300 yards from her home.  The clothing she wore  was
soaking wet but her hair and skin were unusually dry.
     She remains disturbed about this experience.

June  20, 1989 -- 11:30 P.M.:  A woman in the Cary Road area  was
in her home reading when she heard a noise that reminded her of a
helicopter.   She  looked out and saw a huge red  flashing  light
that  she found to be quite unusual.  It moved about  erratically
in a southeasterly direction until she could no longer see it.
     She  settled  back in to read and once again she  heard  the
sound.   This  time she observed a large craft with a  nose  that
resembled  a jet and an enormous transparent body with  brilliant
flashing red lights on its underside.

June 23, 1989 -- Two Anza children, ages 7 and 9, spent the night
of June 23rd in Garner Valley.
     They  observed a large craft with 3 lights that  blinked  in
quick  succession  hovering  in the night  sky  above  Pathfinder
Ranch.   They  are  convinced  this was  not  an  airplane  or  a
helicopter.  Two other children are reported to have been present
during this sighting but I wasn't able to talk with them prior to
this deadline.
