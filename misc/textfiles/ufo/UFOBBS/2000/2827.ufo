	I'm sitting in my room , thinking about all of the wondrous things in this world, the fantasy, the fiction, the reality that occurs and I and wondering about the concepts of man. You want a download so that I may upload, and I find this a fair concept, however, can I say things that are true, while keep the interest of the common  man. Can I sit here and relate a story that I feel is real and convince the common man that what I feel is real. These are the things that I feel you are after. 
	UFO's are real,  period. Anyone who denies this denies reality. How can anyone sit in their rooms and not accept  the fact that the universe is so large that it contains life beyond ours. Now this may be a concept that most would deny, but I do not. The universe is too large to deny expansion. To deny the concept that there are worlds beyond ours that are more advanced than ours, denies the fact that a God exists. Yes, I write about God using the capitalization form. In some way I accept God. But in others I do not. My mind is so full of reality and alternate reality that I consider myself a contradiction of terms.
	Prove to me the reality of life beyond ours. Prove to me that aliens have taken our kind beyond this earth and have integrated themselves into our universe, our world, our life. I want to believe, but yet I find "belief" a hard concept to achieve.
	You know now that I sit down and actually set down onto writing what I feel about people, I find that man as a whole, is very confined. Their imagination about life is confined and so controled about reality that what we find is reality is but a factor if imagination. I watch people here in this town and find a structured so sound that anyone entering it is tested without their knowledge, without their assent, yet it happens. People arrive here, leave here so soon that a form of guild had been created, and if you are not a part of this guild you are considered an outsider. This concept of man to fear the unknown and consider it threatening is an all too familiar idea. But I like to think that reality is a dream and that what we consider real, another considers dream. 
	I watch the X-Files with considerable admiration. Sculley is the ever religious, realist and Mulder the fanatical dreamer. What he seeks is the solution to his sisters disappearance, and what she seeks is the truth to his cravings, although she does not realize her cravings. The difference, this abstract objection confuses the mear man's mortality and asks the question; is there more than the tangible. Can we conceive the abstract and can we believe?
	Can we believe in the abstract. Can man believe in the abnormal. Can man believe in the fiction of life. Can we watch an object perform aerial ballet and have ours limited minds believe that the object go vertical after perfoming a complex sequence of movements. Everything tries to communicate with us, but we are so obstinate that we do not understand.
	You ask, Paul, that I download before I can Upload, and of this I understand. Of  you I ask, can you accept me as a person who only wants to read and understand, who has never been gifted with the sight of things that are beyond this world, of aliens and demons, of nightmares and dreams. Can you accept my weightings of what I feel is real and allow me to research what others write.
	I do not say these things to trick you. I believe what I say. I want to know more. My fear is not understanding, but of being held back and closed off to the reality of things.
	To you I ask that you write back an tell me your questions, tell me your fears, and I will with your help discover them, not simple by saying what I think is right, but by leering what everyone else says. Because you know as I do, the answers to all our questions lie in our own minds. We are the answers to the facts, alien or not. Only our own minds know the answers, and only our own minds can accept the facts, but by the same tolken, our own concious minds cannot accpet the unkown. 
	It was said that man fears the unknown. I believe this. Mortal man cannot accept the unknown. It is up to us; you, me, the others that believe the "nonreality" that what we fear is our own ignorance. Freud was a genius, and at the same time ignorant, not because he was unintelligent, but because of his existance in our time line. Present man kind believes in so much. More than the man of the 1800's. Don't stop now. Go on and discover the things that are forsaken. I bet that the common man would reject these things.
	So are my thoughts. So are my beliefs. But by my own hand I accept ridicule. I accept comment. I accept the unknown. Talk to me. Tell me of your thoughts, cruel or not, fantasy or not, unreal or not, I want to understand the beyond..
