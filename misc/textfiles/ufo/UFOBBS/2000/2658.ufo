    From: Sandy Barbre
    Subj: ATAR

    This   is  a  communication  between  myself  and  Atar  that   occured 
    approximately 2315 hours on May 18, 1991 
     
    SANDY: I'm glad you decided to come tonight, I couldn't get to sleep. 
    
    ATAR : Could  it  be that you couldn't sleep because  you  knew  of  my 
           coming? 

    SANDY: Yeah, that could be it. <grinning> 

    ATAR : It's about time we did some more talking. 

    SANDY: I  know  and  I just want to start this out by saying  that  I'm 
           really  sorry that I didn't make it to the ship when I was  told 
           to. 

    ATAR : You still don't seem to understand parallel times yet.  The ship 
           will be there when YOU <much emphasis on this word>decide to go. 

    SANDY: You mean that I don't have to go on a specific date and time? 

    ATAR : Only  you  require  time as you know it,  but so  that  you  may 
           understand, it will be there when you decide to go.  Now that we 
           have  the  pelimanaries (SP)  out of the road we can move on  to 
           other  things.  I  understand that you have many questions,   so 
           begin. 

    SANDY: Why don't I smoke when I'm around you? 

    ATAR : Look around you. Do you see your cigarettes? 

    SANDY: Yes. 

    ATAR : Then get one. 

           I  try  reaching for my cigarettes and lighter that are  on  the 
           coffee  table and seem to kinda go right thru them.  Can't  pick 
           them up. But yet I see them. I look at him questioningly. ATAR : 
           That  is what I have been trying to explain to you the last  few 
           visits.  Yes,  you APPEAR to be in your place of residences  and 
           everything around you appears to be where it should, however you 
           are  in another dimension of time and space.  You are there  and 
           not there at the same time. This is your vibrations. 

    SANDY: Are  you trying to say that I raise my vibrational level  up  to 
           meet yours? 

    ATAR : Yes  and no.  You raise your vibrations up to meet me and I also 
           lower mine to met you. If I were to meet you in my natural state 
           you  would  not be able to see me.  My movements would  be  much 
           faster than your conscious mind could comprehend. 

    SANDY: Then what is your "natural" form? 

    ATAR : What  you've  considered "energy"  beings would  be  my  natural 
           state,   however for your peace of mind I come to you as you see 
           me now.  NOTE: My description of Atar, right now, right then.... 
           Approx 5'8 inches tall (I'm sitting down, but have stood next to 
           him before). No body or facial hair. Eyes almond shaped but with 
           pupils (pupils green,  almost snake like)  approximately 9 or 10 
           bumps on his forehead, similar to that of "Star Treks" Kilgon's. 
           Body, extremely skinny. No nose, slit type mouth. 

    NOTE : Also  for those of you who do not know,  Atar is from  a  planet 
           called Barconia. 

    ATAR : Is that all of your questions? 

    SANDY: You  know well that it's not but knowing you you have  something 
           you want to tell me. 

    ATAR : I have already learned patience, you have not. I can wait. 

    SANDY: Smarty. Ok. I  know we've been over this before but I'm going to 
           ask it again..... Why are you here?  NOTE:If he knew how to sigh 
           I'm sure he would be doing it right now. <grin> 

    ATAR : Since  we have discussed this previously we are going to go back 
           in  your mind a little bit differently.  When is the first  time 
           you remember seeing me specifically? 

    SANDY: <thinking....> Wellllll, I would have to say when I was about 26 
           or 27 years old. 

    ATAR : You  do know extend your memory far enough.  Go back farther  in 
           time. 
    
    SANDY: No, that's definately the first time. 

    ATAR : Since  you are so sure of your time,  let me ask you  about  the 
           evening that you camped out under the stars when you were  about 
           11 years old. There was a group of other children you were with. 
           Three females and two males. 

    SANDY: <STILL thinking about several campouts I had been on and nothing 
           was clicking> 

    ATAR : You were taking a walk with another female and talking about  ow 
           the stars were so bright and then you saw a light shinning  thru 
           the trees.  You remembered thinking about how the moon must have 
           been full and then you saw me. 

    SANDY: <sudden realization kicks in and memory> I  was walking out to a 
           stream  with Sally Jones (her real name)  when we saw this light 
           coming  thru the trees and were talking about how pretty  bright 
           the  moon  must be to sending shimmers of lights down  thru  the 
           trees. Yeah, I remember but I don't remember you being there. Is 
           this one of these mind tricks? Are you MAKING me remember this? 

    ATAR : Why would I want to trick your mind? Is this not a real memory? 

    SANDY: Yes, but...... 

    ATAR : Have no fear, this is recall from your own memory banks, nothing 
           that I have done or am doing. Just relax and let that night come 
           to you and remember. 

    SANDY: <sitting  back  and getting more comfortable>  (remembering  the 
           walk  to  the  stream and camping out and the people  that  were 
           there....it  was summer vacation and we had all rode our  horses 
           with  backpacks up into the woods on dad's property and  planned 
           on  spending the night out camping under the stars <this  is  in 
           Ohio>.  We had brought food and had forgotten the water and that 
           is why Sally and I are walking to the stream. We wanted to hurry 
           and get back to sit around the campfire and tell ghost  stories. 
           I remember looking at the light and seeing a light blue  shimmer 
           of  light  coming down thru the trees and  remember  talking  to 
           Sally about the light and how pretty it was......then I remember 
           a moment off to the right of me and looked and it moved so  fast 
           that  I  relooked as it was just going behind a tree.   I   said 
           something  to Sally about one of the guys was hiding behind  the 
           tree and was probably planning on scaring us and told her what I 
           had seen. She just told me we ought to be prepared for the scare 
           but  also  to hurry up and get back and be with the  others.   I 
           remember  going back to camp with the water and all the rest  of 
           the  crew asking where in the hell we had been and what took  us 
           so  long  to get the water,  that the stream was  not  that  far 
           away... 

    ATAR : I see you remember more now. 

    SANDY: Yes and I also just realized that I was missing time....<looking 
           at him strangely> 

    ATAR : You only missed approximately 20 minutes of your time.  That was 
           only part of your memory, you can go back and recall the rest if 
           you wish. 

    SANDY: <thinking....do I really want to? hmmmmmm> Do you have time? I'd 
           really like to. 

    ATAR : You are the only one that deals with "time". Go ahead. 

    SANDY: Ok,  thanks...<continuing thinking about that night,  going back 
           again>  I felt myself walking again in the woods. I  looked over 
           at  the  tree just as the shape was disappearing behind  it.   I 
           squinted  to  get a better look and saw a figure come  out  from 
           behind the tree and with a hand, it motioned us toward it. Sally 
           told me to look (at the figure) and I replied, "I'm looking, I'm 
           just  wondering who it is."  We both head over toward the figure 
           and as we get closer I notice a guy in a silver skin suit,  with 
           an emblem on his right shoulder.  Sally and I walked closer  and 
           then all of a sudden we were surrounded by the blue/white light. 
           I  get this sudden feeling of spinning,  up and up,  like I  was 
           caught  in the middle of a hurricane.  As soon as the feeling is 
           gone,   I   look around and am inside a ship.  Sally is  nowhere 
           around me and I'm looking around and am in a circular type room, 
           similar  but  not like the ship of Foob's,  (my  first  contact) 
           There  are  chairs  there  that  are similar  like  those  in  a 
           planetarium,  but not like them. A door slides open and in walks 
           this man,  who I now know as Atar.  <what follows is as far as I 
           went into memory on recalling the actual conversation aboard the 
           ship> 

    SANDY: Who are you and where am I? 

    ATAR : I  am  Atar.   And  you are aboard a fascimile  of  a  spaceship 
           hovering above your planet. 

    SANDY: Alright, I've been in one before, this is neat. Why am I here? 

    ATAR : Because we need your assistance. 

    SANDY: But how can I help you? 

    ATAR : Just by being you. 

    SANDY: I don't understand. 

    ATAR : You have been contacted before. 

    SANDY: Yes, so? 

    ATAR : In  your  lifetime  you will have the opportunity  to  met  many 
           humans who will need your assistance.  All we ask is that you be 
           there when needed. 

    SANDY: That's easy. Ok. Where's Sally? Did she come up here too? 

    ATAR : No, she is waiting for you and she will not remember this. 

    SANDY: Oh? Will I remember? I remember my other visits? 

    ATAR : Only if you wish to remember. 

    SANDY: I do, this is neat. But I can't tell anyone, no one believes me. 

    ATAR : It is not necessary. We will be here, if you wish. 

    SANDY: Oh, yes. 

           <I  came  back to this time to continue  the  conversation  with 
           Atar> 
           
    ATAR : Now, you remember. 

    SANDY: Boy that was a long time ago. But why didn't I remember that? 

    ATAR : Because  you  didn't  wish to remember it.  You  knew  that  you 
           wouldn't be believed so you didn't bother to recall it.  You can 
           now go back and remember the entire episode whenever you wish. 

    SANDY: But how can I do that? Didn't you help me go back? 

    ATAR : No,   you went back on your own.  Remember the studies we did on 
           memory recall? 

    SANDY: Yes, can we go into it again? 

    ATAR : I  know this is not for you because I see  that  you  recall  it 
           well. 

    SANDY: I  know  you know,  so let's just do it anyway.  It is  for  the 
           others that read my echo about you. 

    ATAR : Alright,  but that is something that we will also discuss.   The 
           others.  Humans deal strickly with emotions,  and knowing  that, 
           and  knowing that the brain is like a recorder,  you can  recall 
           anything that you wish to.  The easiest things for you to recall 
           are emotional things and this is a good thing to practice  with. 
           Lay  back  and try to think of the happiest time in  your  life. 
           Feel the sensation and go with it,  don't let any other thoughts 
           interrupt  the feeling.  Now picture in your mind what you  were 
           doing at the time.  Look around you and see what it is that made 
           you feel that way.  Try and use all of your senses. Smell, hear, 
           taste,  whatever fits the emotion.  Experience all of it to it's 
           fullest.  And the key to all of this is 'practice'...  the  more 
           you  practice  the better you get at recalling.  Now,  go  to  a 
           crowded place,  somewhere in time where you are in the middle of 
           a  conversation yet there are others around you that are not  in 
           your  conversation...recall  the  time,  recall  what  you  were 
           discussing  and  with  who and then branch out,   look  at  your 
           surroundings,  listen to music in the background, try and listen 
           to  the other conversations that you never paid attention to the 
           first  time  you  were there.  Also branch out  with  the  other 
           senses.... 

    SANDY: So  what  you are trying to tell me is that I can do  this  with 
           ANYTHING? 

    ATAR : Anything that you WISH to remember. First you have to 'want'  to 
           remember. 

    SANDY: But how would I be able to recall things I don't know I want  to 
           remember.   Like  how was I able to recall the first time I  met 
           you. 

    ATAR : All  I did was trigger your memory by REMINDING you of a certain 
           place you were at,  you did the rest.  By practicing,  which you 
           don't do as often as you need to,  you would recall quite a  few 
           things.   You have no problems with these conversations that  we 
           have. 

    SANDY: I  think  that's because you implant them so firmly in  my  mind 
           that I have no choice. 

    ATAR : Wrong,   you  ALWAYS have a choice.  It's whether you  chose  to 
           remember. 

    SANDY: I stand corrected. Now what about the others? 

    ATAR : There are several that you talk with (showing me a picture of my 
           computer)  that are indeed others that also have had experiences 
           with my species and a few other species. They need to recall the 
           experiences.   For their own purposes.  They don't have to  talk 
           about  it and you shouldn't push them to talk about it.  But  be 
           there when they need to ask questions. ALWAYS be there. You have 
           a  couple  of  ones that have no idea that they  have  ever  had 
           contact  with us before.  They REFUSE to believe that we in fact 
           exist,   but  they  need to remember  because  they  are  having 
           emotional difficulties because of it.  They need to practice the 
           recall techinque. 

    SANDY: Interesting. Can I put this on the echo? 

    ATAR : Yes. 

    SANDY: Can I say who they are? 

    ATAR : NO. 

    SANDY: Why? 

    ATAR : Because  one would not want it made open until he deals with  it 
           himself  and the other is very well known and it would ruin him. 
           That's all you need to know.  They know who they are.  This will 
           be enough for them. 

    SANDY: Ok. 

    ATAR : We  will  now talk about the underwater bases that you  have  on 
           your planet. 

    SANDY: This was something we've talked about and suspected by there  is 
           no way to prove it. 

    ATAR : You have 12  underground/water bases that "we" know of.  Five of 
           them  are  located in the Atlantic Ocean,  Four of them  in  the 
           Pacific Ocean,  Two in the Gulf of Mexico and one in the Persian 
           Gulf.   You  also  have a split in the governing  body  of  your 
           country,  with one side in cohorts with the greys and the  other 
           side with the species of underwater origin. One's that you would 
           call  Repotids.  Eventually there will be a war between the  two 
           species  with your governing bodies in the middle of it.  As far 
           as we are concerned,  that is totally between those two species, 
           both  outcasted  by  their own planets,  both  very  much  in  a 
           power/control mode, much like your people. It would be advisable 
           for you to take neither side. However because your country being 
           involved you need to learn to take care of yourself in a totally 
           primitive environment as the world you know today will no longer 
           be valid.  These are things you have been shown in the past  and 
           it  would do well for you to recall ALL that you have been  told 
           in  detail  and  pass  it  along to  those  you  feel  need  the 
           information. 

    SANDY: But  I  don't understand why we/humans have to  be  involved  in 
           anyway alien type war. 

    ATAR : It isn't a matter of involvement,  it's a matter of being in the 
           wrong place,  at the wrong time as you would say.  And not  only 
           that you would be involved BECAUSE you let the governing  bodies 
           rule  your thoughts and actions instead of being  free  thinking 
           individuals. 

    SANDY: So how did we get involved in the first place? 

    ATAR : As long as you have had governing bodies controlling others like 
           yourselves, way back in a time frame before yours,  you have had 
           humans  controlling  other  humans.  Humans  that  only  desired 
           "power".   This power they seek has always be the  power,   over 
           others. The dark powers prevailed. 

    SANDY: But what has that got to do with aliens? 

    ATAR : Because other species also have the same ultimate goal and  they 
           made pacts, all throughout your planets existance with humans in 
           control.   You have asked several times what your governing body 
           is  trying  to hide and my answer to that is that you have  been 
           told already,  you need to recall that communication between us. 
           And  you need to seek this information soon,  as it will be  the 
           cause of your planets shift and destruction of many humans. 

    SANDY: Save me the time, please, and tell me again, now. 
    
    ATAR : No.   It was a long communication then and if you desire to know 
           of  it,   then  do  the recall.  We have  much  more  that  need 
           communicating  BEFORE  ending this communication.   
    
    SANDY: Oh,  alright.....  what else is so important?  Or more important 
           than this? 
    
    ATAR : I believe you will find that human kind in itself is  important. 
           Things  that you need to think about and turn over  and  change. 
           You live very much in a world that lives only for yourselves. It 
           is  NOW  time for you to assist others.  You need to STOP  being 
           like other humans and taking all you can and give. You have many 
           starving children in your world and yet you throw away food that 
           you have not eaten.  You organize bodies of humans to take  care 
           of  these  children but the funds are ate up in paying  for  the 
           governing  bodies  and  not the children.  It is up  to  you  as 
           individuals  to seek out other humans in need in your areas  and 
           feed them,  or clothe them.  This is not something you can do by 
           yourself,  it must be all humans that must participate. Ones who 
           wish  to survive the holocaust.  Instead you take your funds and 
           gain  other  items  that  are not necessary,   you  build  giant 
           buildings  that  funds could be used to built shelters  for  the 
           less fortunate of your kind.  This also has been a fairly  large 
           communication between you and I.  But this is something that you 
           need to look at NOW.  Those of you who think you have everything 
           will have nothing.  Those of you that help will be rewarded many 
           times over from the love of those you help. 
    
    SANDY: Why do you teach me these things? Why do you care? 
    
    ATAR : You  are  all  children  of the universe and we  are  all  inner 
           related  in  one  way or other.  Parallel worlds  are  not  that 
           difficult to imagaine.  The best example that I can give you  is 
           to have you look back upon your life and see where you have made 
           major decisions.  These are "paths"  and each time you choose  a 
           path you've opened up another avenue that your "self" can and is 
           living  both lives at one time.  This would be the you now,   in 
           this world,  and the childless you in one of the other worlds. I 
           understand  that  it's  easier for you to except  that  with  us 
           rather  than  you,   but there are also other worlds  where  the 
           "other"  you exists. And because we are indirectly involved.  We 
           stand to lose our world if things go wrong on your planet.  That 
           is  why  we are here.  We will only help between the war of  the 
           species from the other planets. We will help aide your growth in 
           developing a peaceful nation, but we cannot interfere because of 
           your "free will".  You have brought this upon yourselves and  is 
           something that you need to deal with.
