\\\\\\\\\\\ INTERSTING THEORY OF CRASHED DISCS 12,000 yrs AGO \\\\\\\\
 
     High in the mountains of BayanKara-Ula, on the boarders of China and
Tibet - a team of archeologists were conducting a very detailed routine
survey of a series of interlinked caves.
     Their interests had been excited by the discovery of lines of neatly
arranged graves which contained the skeletons of what must have been a
strange race of human beings; strange because they had unnaturally spindly
bodies and large, overdeveloped heads.
     At first, it had been thought that the caves had been the home of a
hitherto unkown species of ape. But as the leader of the team - the Chinese
archeologist, Professor Chi Pu Tei - pointed out, "Who ever heard of apes
burying each other?"
     It was while studying the skeletons that one of the team stumbled on a
large, round stone disk, half buried in the dust on the floor of the cave.
     The team gathered round the discovery, turning it this way and that.
It looked, absurdly, like a kind of 'Stone Age Gramophone record'. There was
a hole in the center and a fine, spiral groove radiated to the rim.
     Closer inspection, however, showed that the groove was, in fact, a
continous spiralling line of closely written characters.
     The object was a 'record' ... in more ways then one. Only nobody at the
time - the year was 1938 - possessed the key to its incredible message. The
disc was labeled and filed away among other finds in the area. Even those who
knew of its existence knew nothing of its meaning.
 
     Many experts tried to translate the hieroglyphs in the 20 years the disc
languished in Peking. They all failed. It was not until another professor -
Dr. Tsum Um Nui - broke the code and started to decipher the 'speaking
grooves' that the extraordinary implications of the disc were realized.
Realized, that is, only by only a select few. The outside world remained in
ignorance. For the professor's conclusions on the meaning of the disc were
so shattering that they were offically suppressed. The Peking Academy of
Pre-History forbade him to publish his findings.
     Two years later, in 1965, the professor and four of his colleagues were
finally given permission to reveal their theory. It appeared under the long-
winded but intriguing title, "The Grooved Script concerning Space-ships
which,
as recorded on the Discs, landed on Earth 12,000 years ago".
     The 'records' - 716 of the grooved discs were later uncovered in the
same
caves - told an astonishing story of a 'space probe' by the inhabitants of
another planet which came to grief in the Bayan-Kara-Ula mountain range. The
strange, spiral script told how the peaceful intentions of the 'aliens' had
been misunderstood and how many of them were hunted down and killed by
members
of the Ham tribe, who lived in the neighboring caves.
 
     According to Tsum Um Nui, one of the lines of the hieroglyphs read, "The
Dropas came down from the clouds in their aircraft. Our men, women and
children hid in the caves ten times before sunrise. When at last they
understood the sign language of the Dropas, they realized that the newcomers
had peaceful intentions...".
     Another section expressed 'regret' by the Ham tribe that the aliens'
spaceship had crash-landed in such a remote and inaccessible mountains and
that there had been no way to building a new one to enable Dropas to return
to their own planet.
     In the years since the discovery of the first disc, archeologists and
anthropologists had learned more about the isolated Bayan-Kara-Ula area.
And much of the information seemed to corroborate the bizarre story recorded
on the discs.
     Legend still preserved in the area spoke of small, gaunt, yellow faced
men who 'came from the clouds, long, long ago'. The men had huge, bulging
heads and puny bodies and were so ugly and repellent that they were hounded
down by local tribesmen on horseback. Strangely, the description of the
'invaders' tallied with the skeletons orginally discovered in the caves by
Professor Chi Pu Tei.
     On the walls of the caves themselves archeologists had uncovered crude
pictures of the rising Sun, the Moon, unidentifiable stars and the Earth...
all joined together by lines of pea-sized dots. Along with the discs, the
cave drawings had been dated around 12,000 years old.
 
     The cave area was still inhabited by two semi-troglodyte tribes known as
the Hams and the Dropas, themselves extremely odd in appearance. The frail
and
stunted tribesmen averaged only about five feet in height and were neither
typically Chinese nor Tibetan. "Their racial back-ground," said one expert,
"is a mystery."
     But even with the publications of Professor Tsum Um Nui's amazing trans-
lation, the story of the 'space discs' was not over. Russian scientists asked
to see the discs and several were sent to Moscow for examination.
     They were scraped free of rock particles which had stuck to them and
then put through chemical analysis. To the suprise of the scientists, they we
found to contain large amounts of cobalt and other metallic substances. That
was not all. When placed on a special turntable - according to Dr.
Vyatcheslav
Saizev, who described the experiments in the Soviet magazine Sputnik - they
vibrated or 'hummed' in an unusual rhythm as though an electic charge was
passing through them. Or as one scientist suggested, "as if they formed some
part of an electrical circuit." At some time, they had clearly been exposed
to extraordinarily high votages.
