PART 2





      This is part two. I decided to go ahead and reprint this file.  Green 
    Cloud:   Later  that summer I saw the Green cloud for the last  time.(I 
    think.)   My  younger brother,returning home in the eveing spotted  the 
    cloud  once  again in the braches of the silver Maple that was  in  our 
    back  yard.  I  don't remenber much about this except I am pretty  sure 
    that  this time,I at least,walked down to get a closer look.   I   felt 
    happy.   I  felt as if I were meeting up with an old friend.  I  had no 
    doubt that this was the same cloud as before. I could "feel" it. I  got 
    the  feeling that he had found his way back to his family and that  all 
    was  well.  It seems as if he was just passing by and wanted to let  us 
    know  he was okay.  He seemed a little older,like me and a little  more 
    sure of himself,  again just like me.  I  didn't hear this in words.  I 
    felt  it  in  my head.  I  felt it the same way you might feel  that  a 
    certain  number  is the correct answer to a math problem.  That  is  as 
    close  as I can get to describing that.  I  don't remenber saying  good 
    bye.  I do remenber not feeling sad. I got the impression that we would 
    meet  again.  I  also knew I had a secert,a special secert.  I   wasn't 
    supppose to tell about "knowing" what he was feeling. It would hurt the 
    feelings of the others and there was no sense in doing that.  Only now, 
    right  now that I am writing this do I recall that I would "think"   to 
    him.   Tell  him about my day that sort of stuff.  And it seems that  I 
    would feel him talking to me. 
     
      But not in words in feelings, in that special kind of knowing. I wish 
    I  could  describe  it  better  but  sense it  was  a  thing  of  "not-
    words""words"  can't be used to describe it. I  can see that I am going 
    to have to work on remenbering more of that.  Now some more points.  By 
    this time I was trained well enough that I had little or no fear.  Once 
    again he shows up outside,in the same place,looking a little bigger. He 
    thanks us(me) and makes me feel all grown up. He is grateful to me. Can 
    you see this pattern?  I'm getting buttered up.  Also this communcation 
    is very much indilvuglezed to me.  I was the one who helped him. I even 
    think the feeling of the gender was made with this choice in mind.  Ten 
    year old boys are nervous around females.  The re was a brother in arms 
    kind  of tone to the whole thing.  The exchange of information was done 
    in "feelings". I  am sure that words would of worked best with me I not 
    sure that I would of heard words.  But as I learned when I was learning 
    BiO-Feedback I am not very good with words.  I  get my best results  by 
    remembering  a feeling and then making myself feel that feeling.  I  am 
    given  sercet.  That sercet bound us together just as much as if we had 
    become blood brothers.  Ten year old boys (me at l east)  take  sercets 
    very  seriously.  Even the sercet works for them it puts a small  wedge 
    between  myself and my siblengs.  The sercet also works to protect  me. 
    For a long time now I have felt that the "don't tell rule"  is for  the 
    protection of the witness not the ETs.  I don't think they have much to 
    fear  about people knowing they are here.  Hell plently of us know that 
    they are here,  and it hasn't hurt them yet.  I  don't want to give the 
    wrong impression here. Some people might think that because I feel that 
    I was being mislead that I believe that the ETs are evil.  I  don't.  I 
    think  they were doing the best job they knew how with what they had to 
    work with.  From time to time I do feel some anger,  thats just part of 
    therapy. But when that anger comes up I just work through it and get on 
    with  my  life.   There is something very different  about  this  third 
    encounter,(I don't know if that's a pun or not). The second happened in 
    the  early  morning.   As the sun rose the clould  got  thinner.   This 
    happened in the eveing as the sun set the cloud got more solid.  So far 
    that's  all I remenber,I can't help but think that maybe we  talked  on 
    into the night.  Maybe thats where I got the idea that I could  "think" 
    to him during the day.  Maybe thats when I learned what sort of  things 
    he wanted me to think. Maybe one day I will remenber. Green cloud four: 
    There  was a fourth visit,I feel very sure about this one,but I am  not 
    sure  of  the time.  It was warm because I ws wearning a  short  slveed 
    shrit. I think it was evening,but there was still plenty of sun left in 
    the sky. I don't remenber how I got there but I was standing very close 
    to the silver maple tree in our backyard and resting up in the branches 
    was my Green Cloud. 
     
      I kept as much of the tree between it and myself as I could.  I   was 
    sure  that if it made a move for me I easily outrun it.  It  was  while 
    standing   there,looking  at  it,that  I  began  to  have  a  kind   of 
    communication  with it.As is ususal with me there weren't anyreal words 
    thought  or spoken.  It was more of a collection of feelings along with 
    visual  displays fo events.  It worked okay.  Some where along  here  I 
    remenbered  and began to think about a black and white short feature  I 
    saw on television in this particular picece a young boy is playing with 
    a  ballon  that  somehow gets away from him.  He  keeps  sreaching  and 
    looking  for  it.  Finally after many trails he is  reunited  with  his 
    friend.   The impreesion I got from the Green Cloud was that "he"   was 
    older now than the last time I had seen him.  To his kind he was like a 
    teenager now. He justed stoped by to see how we were doing and to thank 
    us for letting him stay the last time he was here.  He also went on  to 
    give  the idea that I was the o nly one who could talk to him,so  maybe 
    it  would be a good idea to keep it a sercet,as it would only hurt  the 
    feelings  of  my brother and sister.  Being a young boy of about 11   I 
    thought this was just a great idea.  It made me feel really pround that 
    this "older"  person" was willing to trust me. Those are the only clear 
    cut meniories I have of that encounter although it does seem to me  now 
    that I use to check in with him from time to time by just thinking in a 
    certain  kind of way.  What I can't recall clearly is how or why I ever 
    broke  off talking to him at all.  It seems to me that something  would 
    have  to had happened to make me stop talking.  I  wonder what it  was? 
    Here  is  an other example of how the phenonmea presents it'self  in  a 
    favorable like. What child could resist an older presense,(a teenager!) 
    wanting to share a sercet.  I  certainly couldn't.  End notes:   Please 
    remember  my  understanding of the Phenomena is different in some  ways 
    now.  I hope to add more to these files later.  I  welcome anything you 
    may  want  to say to me.  You can usualy get to me on  Dream  Link  and 
    Eckar-1.   I  also have posted my mailing my address in case you  would 
    perfer  to  write to me.  Thanks for letting me tell my story and  good 
    luck to you in your Quest for answers!
