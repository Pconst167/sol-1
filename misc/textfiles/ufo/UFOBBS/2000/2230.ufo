   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A Lincoln police officer saw an unidentified flying
object descending on Union College, but his other-worldly experience turned
out to be a blimp gone astray.
   The officer was on patrol early Thursday when he saw an object descending
over the college campus, said Lt. Jon Briggs. It turned out to be a large
helium balloon in the shape of a blimp that had come unhitched from a new
Runza Drive Inn, Briggs said.
   The officer tried to grab the blimp but was nearly pulled into the air by
it, Briggs said. In the end, it took three officers to bring the balloon under
control, he said.
   The blimp, which Runza store manager Karolyn Johnston said appears to have
been released deliberately, was an advertisement for the new store, which
opened Sunday.
   Johnston said police told her citizens were calling them and reporting a
UFO sailing over Lincoln.
