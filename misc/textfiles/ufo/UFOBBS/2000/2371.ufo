**********************  FORWARD  **********************


     Thank you for participating in a pioneering publishing 

venture. 


     Mass communication has progressed through four major 

transformations. The first revolution separated the author from 

his audience by means of writing; the LITERATI became a secret 

society of COGNOSCENTI that used its exclusive knowledge to 

dominate the ignorant masses. Modern democracy began when movable 

type made it possible for a message to be received by everyone 

who could read. Recently, radio broadcasting countered the first 

and second revolutions by delivering messages to everyone who 

can't read; television is likely to be the MATADOR of democracy. 

The capital cost of printing plants and broadcasting studios 

limits the messengers to parties of power and wealth, whose 

messages are determined to maintain the STATUS QUO --- natcherly 

--- especially their own status plus all the more quid they can 

quo. The tragic consequence of mass communications has been the 

dissemination of tendencious knowledge to enslave the minds of 

mankind, rather than free us to experience our own ignorance 

until we learn better. A truly free press for truly free minds 

could not exist until the personal home photocopier brought 

publishing within the economic capacity of every person with a 

message and postage. As well as reducing the cost of copying to a 

few pennies per kilowatt hour, the computer completes the 

revolution of mass communications by restoring audience feedback. 

As camels and soups show, quality goes down as participation 

increases, but participation is better for the participators; 

eventually, participators support higher standards.


     Since authors began to write, instead of speaking directly 

to their audience, ideas have flowed in one direction, only. It 

is, however, as impossible to teach without learning as it is to 

learn without teaching, which is why so little is learned from 

reading books. For the first time since the advent of writing, 

the computer makes it possible for readers to contribute to the 

discourse and transform a lecture into a dialogue, a 

conversation, a seminar, a workshop, a global town meeting.


     Finding a publisher for my first book, How To Build A 
                                            --------------
Flying Saucer, took nearly ten years; nearly ten more years 
-------------
passed while my market grew to critical mass by word of mouth. 

Now people are reading my first book as if the ideas were as hot 

as tomorrow's news, but a whole generation has grown up to 

drinking age --- and another generation has died of cirrhotic 

livers --- since I was working out those early insights. My 

ideas develop so rapidly that I had to rewrite the manuscript 

every year until it was published. Once printed, however, the 

printing plates are as immutable as graven stone. As soon as I 

began to write my personal correspondence on computer, I 

realized that this electronic medium keeps discoveries alive and 

growing through pooling contributions in ways not feasible by 

any other means of communication. The entire industry is built

by fielding half-baked ideas and then improving them with 

consumer feedback, as it goes along; no other industry advances 

so fast, and in no other industry do the suppliers lag behind 

the advances made by their own demanders. And thus it came to 

pass as I was speaking to the Global Sciences Congress, held at 

Denver in August, l987, that the idea came to me to offer my 

audience my current manuscripts explaining HYPERSPACE to 
                                           ----------
everyone who would participate by also sharing their ideas on 

computer discs.


     Ideally, a book of this nature should be transmitted over 

wires to be downloaded by Special Interest Groups on 

international networks. In the present state of the art, 

however, computers still cannot replace paper. This 

unrealistically jealous industry has not yet made files 

universally readable, like sound and film tapes, and it is still 

impractical to transmit text formats and illustrations through 

wires. Even after the computer industry gets its parameters 

together, all of us early worms will remain stuck with our 

capital investments. Therefore, I have decided to print my 

manuscripts onto discs for postal distribution to the computers 

being used now.
           ---

     This enterprise will succeed only if each reader will make 

at least two copies and pass them on. Some readers may not know 

three other people with compatible computers, so it is hoped 

that readers with the most popular computer models will pass on 

to their computing friends as many copies as they feel this 

publication is worth. If anyone can make conversions to 

unpopular computers, a copy returned to me will be passed on to 

other readers out in left field.


     This brings us to the matter of copyrights. Most people 
                                     ----------
believe that anyone may freely copy published material in any 

numbers for any purpose as long as the copies are not sold for a 

profit (*1).  If legal process were not so expensive, a lot of 

copycats would learn how very mistaken they are. Copyright 

entitles the author to assign legal permission to make copies and 

set the conditions of contract. Although I am assigning all my 

readers the right to make copies and distribute this literature 

freely, the formal copyright remains mine. Any party enterprising 

enough to reproduce these discs by the hundred for sale at a 

profit will very likely interest my attorney to offer a royalty 

contract as a more attractive alternative to a court ordered 

remedy. Any party that fails to include my byline and copyright 

notice will be taken to task for the more serious offense of

plagiarism. 
----------

     Heckling is a part of all public speaking, and most of the 

fun. If hecklers had a fair chance to give their opinions, many 

of them would have more to say than the speakers, and some may 

have better ideas. The only way a reader can add his two bits 

worth to a discourse is by scribbling in the margins of public 

library books. Anything that can be done will be done, so 

hecklers will always be with us, and so will graffiti, along 

with carefully considered letters to editors. Since it is so 

easy to add and subtract opinions to a magnetic publication, a 

lot of opinionated readers are going to do it. The main purpose 

of this venture is to turn audience feedback into an advantage 

--- for everyone --- by encouraging constructive criticism 

guided by rules for fair comment within the laws governing 

copyright and public utterance.


     By the nature of this medium, this publication is going to 

be shared by an unknown number of readers. Those who want to 

give us the benefit of their superior information are asked to 

follow these rules. On those matters that readers can wait for, 

please append your comments to the end of the file. If you feel 

that your information needs to be interjected, then mark the 

beginning and end of your contribution with lines or stars.

Please include your name and the date so that we know whom to 

credit. If you find mistakes of fact, your immediate correction 

is eagerly asked for. Critics looking for an argument improve 

their chances by including their addresses. If you are so 

offended by some statements that you are compelled to make 

deletions, please mark your censorship with a notice of the 

amount of text you deleted, in numbers of lines or bytes, and 

include your name and date to prove the courage of your 

convictions. Anyone who wants to retain his copyright on 

contributions is advised to include notice of their legal claim 

so that no one will assume that all commentaries and 

contributions are in the public domain. Expect disputes; 

democracy is not for weak stomachs and faint hearts.


     Depending on the number of readers who distribute more 

copies, and the number of contributions added --- not to mention 

subtracted --- my original text will be unrecognizable by the 

time this print passes through a dozen recopies. There is no way 

to know whether all contributors have marked the changes they 

make. Neither is there any way to know whether they have their 

facts correct, unless they cite their sources for reference. 

Furthermore, these discs are communicated person-to-person 

through private, first-class mail, making the message into a 

conversation between acquaintances rather than a publication to 

strangers; it is permissible to say things in private and 

personal mail that is regarded as unethical, if not illegal, in 

public utterance. Therefore, all readers must always remember 

and bear in mind that the copy they are reading is a 

BOUILLABAISSE stirred by many cooks, not a FILET MIGNON SAUTEED 

by a chef. Unless you receive a copy that you can certify as 

unaltered from the original, do not believe anything that 

offends your common sense and don't hold the original author or 

signed contributors responsible for statements and/or context 

that may have been altered by hecklers who prefer to remain 

anonymous (*2). My own editors have altered my manuscripts until 

I could hardly recognize my publications as my own compositions 

--- usually for the better. If some party suffers personal 

injury from this special interest group disc, everyone who 

receives it becomes suspect. This is an utterly novel kind of 

case for the courts to rule on, not quite so much privileged 

privacy as a closed computer conference but still a one-on-one 

private correspondence. I dare say that honest mistakes will be 

excused with a pointed finger, but deliberate malice producing 

suffering to an identifiable person, when proven unjustified in 

these litiginous times, will be liable to legal penalties. We may 

protect ourselves from slanderous or obscene remarks by scanning 

each disc immediately before mailing, to check that no one else 

has run the copy and added comments disgraceful to polite 

company.


     I have enough discoveries in my head to keep me writing 

full time for ten years --- I should live so long. In the 

likelihood that my insurance is vastly underrated, I am 

curtailing my research and graphic design in order to put as 

much of my time as I can into getting my ideas written. 

Unfortunately, the charter members of this publishing revolution 

will receive bare bones of text, a dearth shared by everyone who 

buys Version 1.0 of any program. The economy of electronic 

publication, however, enables me to update my text whenever I 

get a break, add animated illustrations in colour, and enliven 

the text with creative layouts in future editions. Most 

important of all, as copies eventually find their way back to me 

with accumulated reader input, new editions can be issued with 

the latest and most extensive information --- better than 

anything I can do. This publication can be considered as a book 

written by its best qualified readers. In order to receive 

updates and new books, all readers will have to send me their 

names and addresses, regardless whence they received their 

copies. Please bear in mind that my resources are exceedingly 

limited, and expect to wait like a Christian for me to follow up 

in my spare time. I expect this enterprise to be taken over by 

more resourceful enthusiasts.


     The definitive version of this disc book will be written on 

an APPLE IIc, in ASCII files; the animated illustrations will be 

rendered with DAZZLE DRAW and FANTAVISION --- if I can't find 

more practical graphics programs. I invested in the APPLE system 

because I believed all the press reports that the computer field 

has more APPLE trees planted than anything else. I am deceived; 

MS-DOS is the most widely used operating system on this scene. 

This original version, however, is written on a KAYPRO II 

operated by CP/M 2.2 in WORDSTAR 3.3. files. It will take me 

time to convert WORDSTAR files to ASCII, and then convert both 

to MS-DOS. The few graphics included on this disc are drawn with 

keyboard characters. Since the ASCII code is standardized only 

for alphanumeric characters, computers using different keyboard 

codes will produce surprising characters --- the trouble is not 

in the disk or your computer.


     As long as computers remain inconvenient to read in bed or 

on public transportation, I shall concurrently try to find 

publishers for paper versions of my disc books. These discs hold 

the beginning of a 75,000 word paper book, heavily illustrated 

with animated illustrations included on disc, under the title 

TIME TRAVEL --- The Secret Science of The UFOs. Availing myself 
-----------     ------------------------------
of the impermanent and quasiconversational nature of magnetic 

correspondence, I have included many speculations and tangents 

on these disks to stimulate response; these unessential essays 

will be deleted from the paper version. The heaviest reading is 

the Second Chapter; once you establish the theoretical 

foundation laid in my repetitive manner of logic, the rest of 

the book is freeway, much like the First Chapter. For the first 

time, the theory and engineering of time travel are explained in 

sufficient practical detail for young physicists to begin 

constructing their own Philadelphia Experiments in their home 

workshops; at least one researcher I know is doing it already, 

in California. Let me know whether you are willing to buy 

TIME TRAVEL --- The Secret Science of The UFOs at a prepublication 
-----------     ------------------------------
price of $10 or a postpublication price of $16. Send no money. I 

only want to know whether there is a market for a paper book 

before I invest more than I can afford to print it. I apologize 

for my inability to acknowlege subscribers to this paper book by 

individual letters, as they are received; at a dollar a letter, 

the cost of mailing is prohibitive. Subscribers will be notified 

individually to write their cheques when the response is 

sufficient to underwrite publication. In the meantime, enquiries 

from royalty publishers are welcome. Zees is a bootstrap 

production, Dollink --- my apologies to Zsa Zsa. 


                         END OF FORWARD 


*1   This is the belief taken by the Government of the United 
States, especially its Public Broadcasting System. Assuredly, 
what the lord hath given us starving authors with one hand, he 
taketh away by truckloads driven by the other. With legal 
protection like we got, we are better off with our pirates. 
Unless you are a government authorized freebooter, however, the 
first hand lays down the law.

        Readers who copy programs published in magazines are 
subject to the same legal strictures. The magazine publishers do 
not assign its readers the right to make copies of their text to 
give to their friends, much less sell.


---------------------------------------------------------------

*2   The most heavily edited and censored book in the world is 
the Holy Bible, yet its readers are convinced every copy is the 
original and every last Word of God. Evidently, God has 
afterthoughts --- The New Testament. The Holy Koran is an even 
later Word of the very same God compiled from the very same 
orginal Scriptures. And don't forget the equally Holy Book of 
Mormon. I can relate to Him; I am also compelled to rewrite my 
original words innumerable times as I get my act together. 

     I believe the Bible; it is the publishers I question. I 
have no doubt that God inspires all His chosen publishers, but I 
wonder whether He chose every publisher; after all, the Bible is 
in public domain. If God inspired the American Constitution, in 
which I believe more than the Bible, He is the Source of the 
First Amendment --- entitling Larry Flint to turn a dollar in 
the pre-eminently profitable religious market. It isn't belief 
in the Bible that fomented the most vicious wars, but belief in 
the infallible veracity of the publishers.
