                                    ABDUCTION
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~  
     
     We have completed another abduction case.   There is always the likely 
     possibility  that another session would bring out more data,  but  the 
     expense,   time and effort control just how many sessions a particular 
     case will have.  There are still many people waiting for regressions. 

     In this particular case, the individual was contacted twice. The first 
     time was when he was a child.  Memories caused him to remember a small 
     fragment of the incident which in turn caused him to fear darkness and 
     being alone in a house.  The second time occurred just a year ago. 

     Indications  are that the victim will not have further  interruptions.  
     He and his wife talked over whether the victim should undergo hypnotic 
     regression.    They  decided  to have the work done.   The  very  next 
     morning a tiny bump at the base of the skull, on his neck, was missing 
     and a small hole had appeared.  Too, where a rash had previously been, 
     a small crescent scar was found. 

     Generally,  the case was rather classic.   The account ran pretty much 
     like  so many other abduction cases.   We are very excited about  this 
     one,  though,  for experiences and descriptions came forward that have 
     not  been  published,   yet,  other abductees  have  reported  similar 
     experiences.
