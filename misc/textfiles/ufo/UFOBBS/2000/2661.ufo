                   NEO-MYSTIC "SPACE BROTHER'S BATTERY"

    Bear in mind,  as stated before, the sun sustains a man-made power plant.  
    The light emanating to your planet is ther all the time even in the dark.  
    You are not utilizing this energy at all but are rather trying to use the 
    "heat" factor of the sun.   The heat is merely a result of the light rays 
    and not in itself of any importance except for heat.   The heat is caused 
    by  the  radiation of the light rays bounding off the magnetic  lines  of 
    force.  Enough for today. 

    January 29, 1975

    The heat is not present on all the planet except in the daylight  because 
    of  the  movement of the lines of force as the planet rotates around  the 
    sun.    On  other planets the heat and light are sustained all  the  time 
    because our power supplies rotate with us.   But you live in an unnatural 
    environment which we are all attempting to correct.   You need to go back 
    to your basic elements to recapture the solar force,  with a silica  base 
    instead of water.  Your small solar batteries are the best technically on 
    the  planet at this time,  but they are not right obviously for they need 
    to be recharged in the direct light of the sun.  You see, these are using 
    only  the visible light and no the invisible light or the magnetic force.  
    Yes,  we will be allowed to use the magnetic force within your own planet 
    - just not for interplanetary purposes until your people turn back to the 
    Law....  The energy will be used through a battery.  Yes,  we will satill 
    call it a magnetic battery,  and it does use bismuth, selenium,  ferrite, 
    silica,   and  manganese.   These will utilize the light,  magnetics  and 
    gravity,   which are your three forces at this time.   This is a  similar 
    energy force to the power that operates our ships,  except that you don't 
    use the time factor.  There will be a transformer need also... 

    Beginning new data regarding Earth energy...

    To  continue  with the light energy:  We are going to build a dynamo,   a 
    generating system capable of supplying quiet,  clean energy to operate an 
    average upper middle class American home,  to supplky 10  to 12  thousand 
    Watts  of energy per about one square foot of space.   This unit must not 
    be under cover.  The unit is in two parts:  a  battery and a transformer, 
    and  can  be  designed to plug on to the outer power connection  so  your 
    current wiring is not necessarily obsolete.   First of all,  for those of 
    you who remember the "Smith" antenna,  received by Wilbur Smith of Canada 
    (who is now part of this group,  by the way)  [deceased],  let me make  a 
    correction.  This was not an antenna, but a transformer - which is why we 
    could not complete the tests at that time [1953?].  This Ferrous Fe2  rod 
    is the basis of our transformer system.   We will use a piece one inch in 
    diameter,  one foot long to begin.   There is a difference in the ferrite 
    rods in densitiy.   We need a .16  or .18  density rod.   Drill two  1/16 
    holes  in  top  of  Ferrite rod,  making  sure  they  are  separated  for 
    insulation.   Drill 1/2 inch deep and insert one copper connection, using 
    epoxy  or other glue if necessary to hold in ferrite.   Make sure end  of 
    copper  connects with ferrite.   Insert conector of clear plastic  coated 
    silver rod in other hole.   Clear plastic is necessary to allow the light 
    to flow.  OK Now do the same to the other end of the rod.  Back later...

    Before  continuing with the power plant,  I  wish so assure you that  the 
    nuclear  power plants are not the answer.   They are spilling more  waste 
    than even the knowledgeable people realize.  However,  these units aren't 
    nearly as harmful as the new "clean"  weapons and machines that are being 
    tested and,  in some instances,  even used.   We are restoring as much of 
    this waste as possible [Footnote A].   It is still a slow process at this 
    time.  Again,  let me state this is a fairly new technical problem to us.  
    For  every  society such as yours has its own individual problems in  the 
    technical  area.    So  much  depends on how  the  so-called  fission  is 
    released.  Don't despair.  We are working to restore this awesome damagea 
    and, hopefully we can solve your energy problems before long.  It has not 
    been possible to do this,  politically, up until now, but it is felt that 
    with the fear of no power very imminent, together with the new freedom of 
    speaking, that it is safe for you to proceed.

    The battery itself is completely non-metallic.  That is, you must not use 
    metal  covers as you do now.   We will use simple old cardboard to begin.  
    Then,  of course, we can switch to plastic for production purposes.   The 
    ends  need  to be clear transparent.   For experimental purposes you  can 
    simply  use  your  transparent plastic wrap.   The battery is  formed  in 
    layers.   The Bismuth and Selenium are mixed.   To make a small battery - 
    take 10  gr (1/4 oz.)  selenium oxide SeO2  and mix with two parts BiPh4.  
    Place in bottom layer of cylinder.   Cylinder is to be made of  cardboard 
    or  inert  plastic with both ends clear transparent.   Place  Bi  and  Se 
    mixture  - mix thoroughly with glass or wooden rod.   Do not  use  metal.  
    Place  layer  of clear inert plastic or clear paper over Bi and  Se  mix.  
    Fill with Ferrous fine pulverized Fe3O2  and place clear plastic over the 
    other  layer  of  BiSe mix at other end.   Both ends are  the  same  with 
    ferrous in between.  Use copper wire 1/16 diameter for positive terminal.  
    Push  through top half way down into ferrous.   Use aluminum for negative 
    terminal  same dimension and same distance.   On bottom attach small thin 
    lead  rod  into  the  bottom  layer of  BiSe.    (No  more  came  through 
    regarding...)

    (To  ****   Relax  and let me through.)   I  truly want to give  you  the 
    complete  information  on how to build a solar energy system.    We  have 
    parts of it recorded there,  but now I will try this method.  First,  let 
    me  reiterate,  we will utilize light rays.   Also used are your magnetic 
    lines of force.  We will make this unit in two parts, a cell, or battery, 
    and  a  transformer.    The  transformer activates  the  battery  with  a 
    perpetual source of energy, thus eliminating any moving parts or liquid. 

    October 31, 1975

    The transformer is made with ferrite rod,  winding,  for those of you who 
    remember,   in a fashion similar to the Wilbur Smith antenna.    I   will 
    describe  this.   The rod becomes a transformer instead of an antenna  as 
    previously believed.  The winding of the wire around the rod captures the 
    magnetic  lines  of  force in a fashion so far unknown  on  your  planet.  
    Using one 1/8  inch copper and one 1/8 inch silver or silver coated wire, 
    wind as below.  OK to place transformer A on top of Battery B.  [See file 
    BAT_ATD.TIF,PCX,etc.] 

    Bring both wires back to both terminals,  leaving one end one fourth bare 
    except for straight ends.   Leave silver terminal on bare end.   With 1/8 
    inch  wire use 1/2  inch ferrite rod,  and,  since battery underway is  8 
    inches long,  suggest 8 inch rod for ease of handling.   Longer is OK but 
    not shorter.   Wind 6 turns per inch for 6 inches,  then straight.    Put 
    both straight wires on the silver terminal.  This we will call negative - 
    Cu plus.   The terminals need to 1/4  inch round wire,  drilled 1/2  inch 
    into rod and set firmly with plastic glue into rod center. 

    The battery is to made in a clear plastic container.  In this case we are 
    using a container approximately 8x4x1.  We use clear plastic for purposes 
    of non-interference.  Opacity in any color will block the invisible light 
    or  color rays,  which we are using.   (Cardboard or paper does not block 
    these  rays if made from wood.)   The transformer connects to the battery 
    at  the Al terminal in the center.   Connect with Ag covered wire from Ag 
    and Cu to Cu on transformer.  Wire length from transformer to battery not 
    important - just ease of handling.   Smae diameter needed as transformer.  
    The  transformer  connects only to the battery,  supplying  the  starting 
    energy. 

    The  battery  is  a horizontal sandwich consisting of 5  separate  layers 
    separated  by fish paper.   The 3 terminals are subsequently run  through 
    parts of the sandwich.  Bottom layer and top layers are the same: BiSeO2.  
    This  accepts  the  light rays which are unseen and  activates  with  the 
    ferrous which is magnetic.  Layer 2 is Fe2O3, layer 3 is MgO2,  and layer 
    4 in manganese (crushed).  Terminal 1, Cu goes to layer 5, contacting all 
    five layers.   Terminal 2, Al,  connects to layer 3,  contacting 3 layers 
    and terminal 3,  Ag, simply connects to layer 1.   Battery terminals need 
    to  be  round  also  for greater response.   These should  be  1/4   inch 
    diameter.  It is more efficient power-wise to keep terminals apart.   The 
    larger  the  battery  the  less this is necessary  but  for  now  suggest 
    separate.    We are also utilizing the area of the field,  which we  will 
    discuss later.   As you experiment of course you will try different forms 
    and  shapes  for more efficient service,  but I believe this is the  most 
    efficient way to prove the theory.

    Output 250  watts, 1000 cps.  Don't be misled: the cps are different from 
    your measurements but can be utilized with your light bulbs and other  ac 
    equipment.   The current flows in a circular motion since it utilizes the 
    light,   color  and magnetic rays.   This method will not  burn  out  any 
    equipment  for  there  is  no overload possible.   It  flows  off.    The 
    manganese and the Fe2O3 both have magnetic properties.  By exciting these 
    two  chemicals  through  the terminals a force is set up that  is  almost 
    perpetual  motion.   The energy measured in Watts is directly related  to 
    the surface area of the BiSe which absorbs the invisible light energy and 
    the area of the terminals connected to the chemicals in each layer.   See 
    drawings.  Back later.
