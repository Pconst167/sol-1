PART 4



     The abduction, at first, followed his initial recollection. But
when the liquid was drunk, he now remembered a very strong feeling of
change in his body.  And he saw that the grandmother didn't actually
look younger.  Instead, she was placed on a table and approached by one
of the reptilian aliens who wanted to have intercourse with her.  The
liquid had acted as an aphrodisiac, yet the grandmother resisted and
said that since her husband's death she would not have sex with anyone.
The reptilian laughed and disappeared from the room momentarily.  When
he returned, he was accompanied by a man who looked exactly like the
dead husband.
     At this point, the grandmother agreed to have sex, but as the act
was in progress, she suddenly realized that the image of her dead
husband was a cruel illusion.

"By Jesus,"
she shouted, "you will not touch this boy!"
     That must have been the wrong thing to say, because the reptilian
became very angry and threatened her.  "You will die for that!" he told
her, and the two people were returned to the bedroom from which they'd
been taken.  The next morning, the grandmother told the little boy that
the devil had been there the night before, and that was when she
insisted upon being taken home.  And, as it turned out, she did die
immediately thereafter.
     This, then, was the cause of the man's lifelong sense of guilt
about her death.  He had been forced to have sex with her, and her death
had followed shortly after.  But none of this story would have emerged
if Ms. Bartholic had done as most investigators do and stopped the
regression after uncovering the story about the exchange of medicinal
knowledge.
     There are other cases in our files that show a similar deception at
work in the initial hypnotic recall.  We cannot trust that first memory,
it is clear, for like so much else in the abduction experience, there
may well be further maskings of events.
     Before we allow ourselves to believe in the benevolence of the
alien interaction, we should ask, do enlightened beings need to use the
cover of night to perform good deeds?  Do they need to paralyze us and
render us helpless to resist?  Do angels need to steal our fetuses?  Do
they need to manipulate our children's genitals and probe our rectums?
Are fear, pain and deception consistent with high spiritual motives?
