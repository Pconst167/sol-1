    The  following was taken from a newspaper from Springfield,   Missouri, 
    dated Sunday,  December 9th, 1990.   The name of the newspaper I think, 
    is the NEWS-LEADER and article is in the section called Ozarks Accent.

    What   sets  Gerald  Anderson  appart  from  the  thousands  of   other 
    American's, including scores of Ozarkers, who say they've seen UFO's or 
    even insist they've been kidnapped by creatures from outer space? 
    
    Why   are   Gerald   Anderson's   childhood   recollections    stirring 
    international  interest  among UFO researchers whose  reputations  have 
    been built on healthy skepticism and willingness to debunk hoaxes? 
    
    Because  of little things he has to say and how he says them.   Stanton 
    Friedman, a nuclear physicist who has lectured on more than 600 college 
    campuses  about  UFOs,   decribes Anderson as  "a  really  significant, 
    potentially  the most important"  witness to what both men believe  was 
    the  aftermath of one of two space craft crashes in New Mexico in  mid-
    summer  1947.  Friedman is co-authoring a book based upon several years 
    of  painstaking  investigation  into  the haunting  mystery.    He  was 
    startled,  upoln meeting Anderson for the first time only a few  months 
    ago, to hear the Springfieldian echo details of the yet to be published 
    research. 
    
    "There's  no way he could know some of these things unless he had  been 
    there at the time," Friedman believes. Example:  only days before first 
    talking  with  Anderson,  Friedman coaxed a  heretofore  reluctant  New 
    Mexico  mortician  into recounting a run-in he'd had in 1947   with  an 
    especially  unpleasant  red-headed captain who was heading  up  a  team 
    recovering  bodies from a hush-hush aircraft crash.    Anderson,   too, 
    spoke  of a red-headed captain with a mean disposition.  Friedman  says 
    the  descriptions  of  the ornery officer provided  by  the  two  match 
    precisely, although Anderson and the mortican never have met. 
    
    In  sketches of the desert crash scene drawn by Anderson in Springfield 
    following a hypnosis, a lonely windmill appears in the distance.   When 
    Friedman  later  arranged  for  Anderson to return  to  New  Mexico  to 
    pinpoint the long-ago crash site,  no such windmill could be see on the 
    horizon--   until,  almost by accident,  the windmill wa spotted behind 
    tress  that  had grown up during the 43  years since Anderson was  last 
    there.   "I got shivers over that one,"  says John Carpenter,  who  has 
    extensively debriefed Anderson over the past 4 months and went along on 
    Anderson's return trip to New Mexico in October. Capenter holds degrees 
    in  psychology and psychiatric social work from DePauw  and  Washington 
    universities   and  trained  in  clinical  hypnosis  at  the  Menninger 
    Institute.    He's  in his 12th year of work at a psychiatric  hospital 
    facility in Springfield. 
    
    "When  Gerald tells his story,  it's not just a story --  it's his life 
    he's telling you,  intermixed with his feelings and his beliefs and all 
    that is Gerald," Carpenter says. 
    
    "When someone is spinning a hoax or tale, they only give you enought to 
    reaise  your  curiosity.   Not Gerald.   He gives you  everything,   in 
    detail,  much more than you ask him for.  He'd be setting himself up to 
    be  found out if it wasn't true.   He's so confident,  he goes so  much 
    further than a hoaxer would ever dare." 
    
    Carpenter  puts great stock in Anderson's recountings  under  hypnosis.  
    "It's  what  he  didn't say that  was  significant."   Caprenter  says, 
    explaining  that  despite clever prodding,  Anderson never  commited  a 
    hoaxer's  mistake of "recalling"  something that shouldn't be a part of 
    his own memory.  "And when he's under hypnosis,  all the bigger,  adult 
    words drop out when he  describes events from his childhood," Carpenter 
    found.  "He relates what he was in child-like terms." 
    
    Carpenter  also detected "genuine amazement"  when Anderson heard  what 
    had been dredged from his subconscious memory under hynosis.  "The look 
    on  his face was priceless when he realized he'd produced details  he'd 
    forgotten on a conscious level so long ago." 
    
    Most  subtle  but  perhaps  most telling,  in  Carpenter's  view,   was 
    Anderson's  reaction  to  being  accepted as a  viable  witness  to  an 
    extrordinary  encounter  with a spacecraft and  creatures  from  beyond 
    Earth. "He was so grateful at being taken seriously.  You could see the 
    relief and release after all those years, and the great hope that other 
    people would take him seriously too, once and for all." 
    
    Ironically,   Friedman points to Gallup Poll results indicating that 60 
    percent of Americans who have college degrees say they believe UFOs are 
    real.    With  such  a receptive constituency,   why  would  government 
    officials persist in what Friedman calls the "Cosmic Watergate"  -- the 
    coverup and denial of the New Mexico crashes?  Perhaps, some speculate, 
    because  it would be too embarrassing now to admit that some supposedly 
    made-in-USA  technologies  actually were plagiarized  from  confiscated 
    spacecraft. 
    
    Friedman  emphasizes  that  he's not as interested in  uncovering  past 
    misdeeds as he is in encouraging future progress.  "I believe we should 
    have an 'Earthling"  orientation rather than nationalistic orientation.  
    The  easiest  way to demonstrate the wisdome of this is to  prove  that 
    lifeforms from other planets are coming here.  If we can do that,  then 
    everyone will be forced to look at our world differently,  as a part of 
    a galactic neighborhood." 
    
    Ozarkers  wishing to learn more about UFO research may attend  meetings 
    of  the  local chapter fo the national Mutual UFO Network.    The  next 
    MUFON  gather  is scheduled for 7pm Tuesday,  Jan 29,  in  the  private 
    meeting room at Mr. Gatti's Pizza, 1508 E. Battlefield Rd.
