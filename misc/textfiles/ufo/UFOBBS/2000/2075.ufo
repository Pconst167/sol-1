Houston, Texas - Experts have discovered a definite but baffling link
between UFO activity and country music!

Newly released information indicates that an amazing number of reports of
alien spacecraft sightings occur in areas where the songs of Nashville
singers are being played.

We're not sure what to make of it, says Dr. Zachary Simms, noted UFO expert,
who's been investigating encounters with space aliens for more than 12 years.

It may or may not be significant.

But our research shows that in an incredible 68 percent of the cases where
UFO sightings are actually reported, country music has been playing - at
either a concert or in a so called honky tonk joint - within 14 miles.

The music of Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and Loretta Lynn
seem to be particularly common to the sightings.

Dr. Simms says he and his staff made the discovery by accident.

We were trying to find out what, if anything, all UFO sightings had in 
common with one another, says the 34-year-old researcher. We didn't know
exactly what we were looking for.

We fed information into our computer from over 700 reports of alien activity
over the last 15 years - everything from what time of day the sighting
occurred to what color clothes the witnesses were wearing.

We even logged in what thoughts the people were thinking just before they
encountered the aliens.

The only factor that came upl with regularity was country music.

Amazingly, Dr. Simms study included sightings not only in the U.S. but Peru,
Australia and Africa as well. And even in those foreign places, American
country music was playing at the time.

Dr. Simms refuses to speculate on the reasons for the strange finding.

But noted musicologist Henry Lebow is promoting his own theory.

There is a very unique style of playing the notes of most country and Western
songs, says Lebow. They have a certain 'feel' or vibration that no other
kind of music on earth has.

It could be that these creatures are somehow attuned to that particular
vibration - that they're drawn to it as moths are drawn to bright light.
