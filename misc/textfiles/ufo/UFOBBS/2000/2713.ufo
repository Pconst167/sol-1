     [...]

    the experience [Hill abduction] remains a fascinating story despite the 
    absence  of  proof that it actually happened.  Anyway --  that's  where 
    things were in 1966 when Marjorie Fish, an Ohio schoolteacher,  amateur 
    astronomer  and member of Mensa,  became involved.  She wondered if the 
    objects shown on the map that Betty Hill allegedly observed inside  the 
    vehicle  might represent some actual pattern of celestial objects.   To 
    get  more information about the map she decided to visit Betty Hill  in 
    the  summer  of 1969.  (Barney Hill died in early 1969.)  Here  is  Ms. 
    Fish's account of that meeting: 
     
      "On Aug.4,  1969,  Betty Hill discussed the star map with me.   Betty 
    explained that she drew the map in 1964  under posthypnotic suggestion. 
    It  was to be drawn only if she could remember it accurately,  and  she 
    was  not to pay attention to what she was drawing --  which puts it  in 
    the  realm of automatic drawing.  This is a way of getting at repressed 
    or forgotten material and can result in unusual accuracy.  She made two 
    erasures showing her conscious mind took control part of the time. 
    
      "Betty described the map as three-dimensional, like looking through a 
    window. The stars were tinted and glowed. The map material was flat and 
    thin (not a model),  and there were no noticeable lenticular lines like 
    one  of  our three-dimensional processes.  (It sounds very much like  a 
    reflective  hologram.)  Betty did not shift her position while  viewing 
    it,  so we cannot tell if it would give the same three-dimensional view 
    from  all  positions or if it would  be  completely  three-dimensional. 
    Betty  estimated the map was approximately three feet wide and two feet 
    high with the pattern covering most of the map.  She was standing about 
    three  feet away from it.  She said there were many other stars on  the 
    map  but  she only (apparently)  was able to  specifically  recall  the 
    prominent  ones connected by lines and a small distinctive triangle off 
    to the left.  There was no concentration of stars to indicate the Milky 
    Way  (galactic  plane)  suggesting that if it represented reality,   it 
    probably only contained local stars. There were no grid lines." 
     
    [...] 
     
      Now we are ready to return to the map drawn by Betty Hill.   Marjorie 
    Fish  reasoned  that  if the stars in the Hill map  corresponded  to  a 
    patter of real stars --  perhaps something like we just developed, only 
    from  an  alien's  viewpoint --  it might be possible to  pinpoint  the 
    origin  of the alleged space travelers.  Assuming the two stars in  the 
    foreground of the Hill map were the "base"  stars (the sun,  a   single 
    star,   was  ruled out here),  she decided to try to locate the  entire 
    pattern.   She  theorized that the Hill map contained only local  stars 
    since no concentration would be present if a more distant viewpoint was 
    assumed and if both "us"  and the alien visitors'  home base were to be 
    represented. 
    
      Let's  assume,  just as an astronomical exercise,  that the map  does 
    show  the sun and the star that is "the sun"  to the humanoids.   We'll 
    take the Hill encounter at face value, and see where it leads. 
    
      Since  the aliens were described as "humanoid"  and seemed reasonably 
    comfortable on this planet,  their home planet should be basically like 
    ours.   Their  atmosphere must be similar because  the  Hills  breathed 
    without trouble while inside the ship, and the aliens did not appear to 
    wear  any  protective apparatus.  And since we assume their biology  is 
    similar  to ours,  their planet should have the same temperature regime 
    as  Earth  (Betty and Barney did say it was uncomfortably cold  in  the 
    ship).   In  essence,  then,  we assume their home planet must be  very 
    Earthlike. Based on what we discussed earlier it follows that their sun 
    would be on our list if it were within 55 light-years of us. 
    
      The lines on the map, according to Betty Hill,  were described by the 
    alien  as  "trade routes"  or "places visited occasionally"   with  the 
    dotted lines as "expeditions". Any interpretation of the Betty Hill map 
    must retain the logic of these routes (i.e.  the lines would link stars 
    that would be worth visiting). 
    
      Keeping  all this in mind,  Marjorie Fish constructed several  three-
    dimensional models of the solar neighborhood in hopes of detecting  the 
    pattern  in  the  Hill  map.  Using beads  dangling  on  threads,   she 
    painstakingly recreated our stellar environment.  Between Aug. 1968 and 
    Feb. 1973, she strung beads, checked data,  searched and checked again. 
    A suspicious alignment,  detected in late 1968, turned out to be almost 
    a  perfect  match once new data from the detailed 1969  edition of  the 
    Catalog of Nearby Stars became available. (This catalog is often called 
    the "Gliese catalog"  --  pronounced "glee-see" --  after its principal 
    author, Wilhelm Gliese.) 
     
    
      The 16 stars in the stellar configuration discovered by Marjorie Fish 
    are compared with the map drawn by Betty Hill in the diagram on page 6. 
    If some of the star names on the Fish map sound familiar,  they should. 
    Ten of the 16 stars are from the compact group that we selected earlier 
    based  on the most logical direction to pursue to conduct  interstellar 
    exploration from Earth. 
    
      Continuing to take the Hill map at face value,  the radiating pattern 
    of "trade routes" implies that Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli are the "hub" 
    of exploration or,  in the context of the incident,  the aliens'   home 
    base.   The  sun is at the end of one of the supposedly  regular  trade 
    routes. 
    
      The  pair  of stars that make up Zeta Reticuli is practically in  the 
    midst  of  the cluster of solar type stars that attracted us  while  we 
    were  mapping  out a logical interstellar voyage.  Checking further  we 
    find that all but two of the stars in the Fish pattern are on the table 
    of  nearby solar type stars.  These two stars are Tau 1 Eridani (an  F6 
    star) and Gliese 86.1 (K2), and are, respectively, just above and below 
    the  parameters we arrived at earlier.  One star that should  be  there 
    (Zeta Tucanae) is missing probably because it is behind Zeta 1 Reticuli 
    at the required viewing angle. 
    
      To summarize,  then: (1)  the pattern discovered by Marjorie Fish has 
    an uncanny resemblance to the map drawn by Betty Hill;  (2)  the  stars 
    are  mostly the ones that we would visit if we were exploring from Zeta 
    Reticuli, and (3) the travel patterns generally make sense. 
    
      Walter  Mitchell,  professor of astronomy at Ohio State University in 
    Columbus,   has  looked at Marjorie Fish's interpretation of the  Betty 
    Hill map in detail and tells us, "The more I examine it,  the more I am 
    impressed by the astronomy involved in Marjorie Fish's work." 
    
      During  their  examination  of the map,  Mitchell  and  some  of  his 
    students  inserted  the  positions of hundreds of nearby stars  into  a 
    computer and had various space vistas brought up on a cathode ray  tube 
    readout.   They  requested the computer to put them in a  position  out 
    beyond  Zeta Reticuli looking toward the sun.  From this viewpoint  the 
    map  pattern obtained by Marjorie Fish was duplicated with virtually no 
    variations.   Mitchell  noted an important and previously unknown  fact 
    first  pointed out by Ms.  Fish:  The stars in the map are almost in  a 
    plane;   that is,  they fill a wheel shaped volume of space that  makes 
    star hopping from one to another easy and the logical way to go --  and 
    that is what is implied by the map that Betty Hill allegedly saw. 
    
      "I  can  find  no  major  point  of  quibble  with  Marjorie   Fish's 
    interpretation  of  the Betty Hill map,"  says David R.   Saunders,   a 
    statistics  expert at the Industrial Relations Center of the University 
    of Chicago. By various lines of statistical reasoning he concludes that 
    the  chances of finding a match among 16  stars of a specific  spectral 
    type among the thousand-odd stars nearest the sun is "at least 1,000 to 
    1 against". 
    
      "The  odds  are  about 10,000  to 1 against  a  random  configuration 
    matching perfectly with Betty Hill's map,"  Saunders reports.  "But the 
    star group identified by Marjorie Fish isn't quite a perfect match, and 
    the odds consequently reduce to about 1,000 to 1. That is, there is one 
    chance in 1,000  that the observed degree of congruence would occur  in 
    the volume of space we are discussing. 
    
      "In  most fields of investigation where similar  statistical  methods 
    are  used,  that degree of congruence is rather persuasive,"  concludes 
    Saunders. 
    
      Saunders, who has developed a monumental computerized catalog of more 
    than 60,000 UFO sightings, tells us that the Hill case is not unique in 
    its general characteristics --  there are other known cases of  alleged 
    communication  with extraterrestrials.   But in no other case on record 
    have maps ever been mentioned.
