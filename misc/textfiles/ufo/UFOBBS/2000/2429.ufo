A UFO sighting on the evening of December 29, 1980, changed the lives of three 
Texans forever - and not for the good.

While driving through the southern tip of the east Texas piney woods, north 
of Houston, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie's seven-year-old grandson 
Colby came upon a huge diamond-shaped object just above the trees and 130 feet 
away. Cash hit the brakes, and she and the elder Landrum stepped outside. 
Immediately, they noticed intense heat. Their faces felt as if they were 
burning. When Vickie reentered the car and touched the dashboard to steady 
herself, she left a handprint.

Blasting fire and heat, the UFO slowly ascended. Suddenly, numerous 
helicopters - 23 in all - appeared from all directions, positioning themselves 
near the strange craft. By this time the witnesses were back in the car and 
watching the spectacle from their moving vehicle. (Other motorists saw the 
object and the helicopters from different, more distant locations.) 
Eventually, the flying objects were lost to view. Unfortunately, the episode 
was only beginning.

Back home the three fell sick, Cash most severely. She suffered blisters, 
nausea, headaches, diarrhea, loss of hair, and reddening of the eyes. On 
January 3, unable to walk and nearly unconscious, she was admitted to a 
Houston hospital. Vickie and Colby were experiencing the same symptoms, though 
less severely.

The witnesses' health problems continue to this day. In September 1991 Cash's 
personal physician, Dr. Brain McClelland, told the Houston Post that her 
condition was a "textbook case" of radiation poisoning, comparable to being 
"three of five miles from the epicenter of Hiroshima." For years the three 
have pursued their case through the courts, seeking answers and redress, but 
official agencies deny any knowledge of the incident - even through the 
helicopters have been identified as twinrotor Boeing CH-47 Chinooks, used by 
both the Army and the Marines.
