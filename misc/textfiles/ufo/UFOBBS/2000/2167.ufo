Oddysey Guidelines

By James Vincent, Editor


Oddysey is the official newsletter of ParaNet Alpha. It is published
bi-monthly. Roughly three-fourths of it's content is taken from the
ParaNet Computer Network, while the remaining quarter is contributed
by myself, and my co-editor Keith Michaels. Anyone wishing to
contribute to Oddysey is more than welcome. We reach many people who
can't sign-on to ParaNet directly, as well as organizations such as
the New Project Bluebook, Crux Publications, the Hynek Center for UFO
Studies, Nevada Aerial Research, Caveat Emptor, and many others.

A call to authors!

We are open to any topic that can actively be discussed on ParaNet.
Any articles published in Oddysey will also be available in ParaNet's
libraries.

---------+

To submit to Oddysey:

1. Upload the article to ParaNet Alpha, with appropriate mail to me
(James Vincent) telling me of the upload and its location.
2. Or, send the article directly to Oddysey, P.O. Box 80313, Phoenix,
Arizona, 85060 (wish SASE if you'd like it back).

Oddysey pays in contributor's copies (up to four).

As of this writing (08/07/89) subscription rates are as follows.

Six issues of Oddysey (one year): $9.00.
Thirteen issues (two years, plus a bonus issue!): $18.00.

ParaNet sysops can get a continuous, lifelong subscription for a one-time fee
of $9.00.

I would also like to add that Oddysey's format is open to
modification. If for any reason you do not feel it is accomplishing
it's goals, things can be changed. We are open to new ideas and would
welcome regular contributors. If you can come up with an interesting
bi-monthly column, Oddysey is ready and willing to consider it. I can
be reached, between 12:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. (MST) at (602)-921-3340. Keith
Michaels can be reached at (602)-956-2173, between roughly the same hours.

Be seeing you...
