Washington - The mysterious face on Mars was designed and built by an advanced 
civilization that existed on the Red Planet over 4,000 years ago - in 2,500 
B.C.!

So say the authors of a secret and potentially explosive NASA report that 
compares the Martian civilization with one that developed in ancient Egypt 
during the same period.

As the report points out, the Egyptians were building pyramids about the same 
time Martian engineers were building the stone Face. The authors concluded 
that "civilizations on both planets were advancing simultaneously before a 
cataclysm of unimaginable proportions wiped out life on Mars."

Astronomer Dr. Paul Minart obtained one of only two known copies of the report 
from a highly-placed NASA source.

He called the document "a stunning admission from one of the most conservative 
agencies in government."

"NASA runs and administrates a limited and singularly unimaginative space 
program that normally doesn't even bother to address larger issues such as the 
evolution of life on ohter planets," he continued.

"To have this agency admit that life evolved on Mars is enough to boggle the 
mind. You can bet NASA found irrefutable evidence to support these 
conclusions, otherwise the report wouldn't exist. You can also be sure that 
some key people in NASA arranged to have the report leaked. Something's going 
on and they figure the best way to gauge public reaction is to get a 
preliminary report in the press."

NASA spokesmen declined to discuss the astronomer's report and would either 
confirm nor deny that the agency has solved the riddle of the Face on mars 
once and for all.

The Face, of course, is a mile-long stone monument that was first photographed 
by NASA's Viking probe in 1976. For years, the agency argued that the Face was 
nothing more than a natural formation. 

According to the report, analysts changed their tune after they subjected the 
original Viking photographs to a new form of computer enhancement - and 
discovered a series of strange inscriptions etched into the stone.

"Nobody has been able to decipher the inscriptions but NASA seems to be 
satisfied that they were placed there by intelligent beings," said Dr. Minart.

"They are assuming that these beings were human based on the design of the 
monument, which clearly depicts a helmeted human head and face.

"How they arrived at a date for the construction of the Face on Mars is a bit 
more complicated. The report seems to suggest that NASA is privy to additional 
information aleaned from a pair of top secret space probes that were sent to 
Mars in 1991 and 1992."

How Americans react to news that the Face on Mars was built by human hands 
remains to be senn. Dr. Minart believes NASA will issue "a full and very 
public report if people take the news in stride.

"But when you're dealing with extraterrestrial life, even extraterrestrial 
life that is extinct, there is always the possibility of panic.

"You've got to remember that most human beings still think of themselves as 
God's ultimate creation. When told otherwise, they begin to feel that they are 
no more important in His eyes than animals and insects.

"And that scares them to death."
