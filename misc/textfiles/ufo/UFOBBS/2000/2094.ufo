// This interview on Wednesday, November 13, 1991 is presented unedited. //
// Q> represents the interviewer, asking Questions.                      //
// A> represents Adam Andrews. Adam is a long time skywatcher in the     //
//    area. Adam is something of a UFO magnet, it seems, due to the      //
//    large number of UFO sightings he has had in this preculiar area.   //
//    Adam almost guarantees anyone will have an unusuall sighting       //
//    watching the sky for one, or perhaps two nights, in or around the  //
//    Clarkston, Wa. and Lewiston, Id. Snake River valley. Adam can be   //
//    reached through his dad's home: 1035 Alder Drive, Lewiston, Id.    //
//    83501. Telephone: (208) 743-5963. Adam is willing to talk to all.  //
// B> represents Bill, not his real name for reasons of privacy. He is   //
//    also a long time resident of the L-C valley area, and Pullman, Wa. //
//    fourty miles to the north (home of Washington State University).   //
//    He is concerned with the latest flap of sightings being related    //
//    to an unpopulated corridor running between the L-C area, and       //
//    AREA-51, which is DIRECTLY some 640 miles to the south.            //

Q> Tell me about the missing time. The whole story that led up to the
   missing time, and everything.

A> Tell you the truth, that's what the mystery is about. You can even
   ask Val about it, because she was complaining. She was asking me
   where I was all day long, and everything like that.
   // Val is Adam's longtime girlfriend //

Q> How did it start out? What were you doing that morning? What time of
   year was it? Do you know what month it would have been?

A> About this time of year.

Q> About november?

A> Yes.

Q> What year?

A> About three years ago.

Q> And you would have been about how old at that time?

A> 21 to 22 I believe.

Q> You and Val were living together then, over on ninth street?
   // In Clarkston, Wa //

A> Right.

Q> And that was 1980 what?

A> 88.

Q> So that's November, 1988?

A> Yes

Q> So, what did you start out doing that morning?

A> I was just headed up to my dad's, you know, I was going up there for
   something. I used to go up there to take a shower and everything. Clean
   up, and eat up there.
   // Adam's father's house is in the Southeast portion of the Lewiston //
   // Clarkston area, called the Lewiston Orchards, close to the airport //

Q> That's up in the lewiston orchards?

A> Right. And I took the back way. I always used to drive the back way.
   Towards, you know, Tammany.

Q> Ok, that's that road up past Hellsgate park up there. You go up Snake
   River avenue, that way?

A> Yes. Take a left, after you get across the bridge and all that. That's
   the direction I used to drive all the time, because it was a straight
   drive. It would take me right up to where I was going.

Q> Hardly anyone on it? Go fast?

A> That's what I used to do. I used to drive that road really fast, 65.

Q> What time did you do up there?

A> It was before noon.

Q> So you set out on the Tammany road to go to your dad's house, its up in
   the Orchards, because its the back way. Did you get to your dad's house
   ok? You remember getting there ok?

A> Yes. But that's the wierd thing though. In between the time I left and
   the time I got back, it took me 5 hours. You can even ask Val, even to
   this day she accuses me of going out and screwing around. And I didn't do
   anything.

Q> You remember driving to your dad's house, and you remember getting to
   your dad's house. Do you remember what time it was when you got to your
   dad's? Did you see a clock? When you got to your dad's house did
   everything seem normal up to that point?

A> I didn't even notice anything. Except until the end of the day, that it
   was later on. I didn't get back to my house until about 4 o'clock. And when
   I went up there, it was about noon.

Q> How long did you stay at your dad's house?

A> Well, let's see. Like I say, I had taken a shower. It used to take me,
   what, about, I would soak in the shower for about a half an hour. Eat
   something. All together I would be gone, usually, about an hour and a half
   at the most. But this one day, it was really wierd. It was like this time
   was just zipping. The clock was going like this. It was 4 o'clock by the
   time I got back there.
   // Adam indicated spinning clock hands motions //

Q> Which way did you go back? The same way, or through town?

A> No. I came back down through town. I would always take the direction
   up TO my dad's, taking the back way towards Tammany.

Q> Do you remember looking at your watch, or seeing a clock, after you got
   to your dad's house?

A> No

Q> I guess what I am trying to figure out is, if there was a period of
   missing time, where did it occur, or when did it occur. Was it while you
   were driving?

A> That's what I don't know. That's all I know, is that the whole day
   suddenly went, and I didn't fall asleep. You might say, to this day, Val
   still thinks that I went out and screwed around and did something. It
   irritates me because I knew where I was.

Q> Can you remember anything else that seemed funny to you at that time,
   that day, you know? Or, did you seem different or strange? Or, did
   anything hurt? Or, did anything seem funny about your person in the days
   following that?

A> No, because it has happened more that once.

Q> It has happened more than once? Did you just now remember that? Did
   you just now think of that?

A> Yes, just lost time, you know. I was thinking about it the other day.
   We were having an argument, and Val said "I rememeber there's been a
   couple of times when you've left to go up to your dad's, and were gone
   4 or 5 hours," and I'm "WHAT?"

Q> Did you drive the same way on those other times to get there? Did you
   take the same route?

A> Yes.

Q> You took the same route, the kind of unusual route, the back way
   throught the Tammany valley there?

A> Yes

Q> That's not too far from where that secret Blount plant is, is it?

A> No. You go right past there. They are up on the hill, just above it.

Q> They are up on the hill just above it? What can you tell me about that
   Blount plant? What have you heard about it? Some of the things you have
   heard.

A> From Jody, Hell, I've heard that they have got underground silos up
   there. And orders to shoot to kill anyone who tresspasses on the
   premesis up there after dark. The fact old Andy should be able to relate
   to that, because a he knows a guy who has been working at that place,
   Gregg.

Q> I guess they have really bright lights there?

A> Yes. Its in a circle. Its like they have a big circle surrounded by
   great big halide lights. Football field size.

Q> Where is that in relation to the airport? Is it fairly close to the
   airport?

A> Yes. You can see it from my dad's. You can see the runways, the runway
   lights, and then over to the left you can see the circle of bright
   lights. Looks like a football field. You can't see what goes on, all you
   can see is the lights. I've been told its all fenced in, razor wire and
   everything else.

Q> And in this area, lights in the sky?

A> Right. In that area. The first real sighting that I know that I saw
   something unusual. I was six years old, about 1971. In my dad's back
   yard. My dad, my mom, and two more relatives, my aunt, Dick and Sandy,
   that's my dad's sister's daughter and her husband. They were all sitting
   around drinking beer, and yucking, and laughing and doing everything,
   you know, in the lawn chairs. I was just looking up, and I saw this kind
   of a little glow. If you hold a dime about at arms length, that's how big
   it was. About as big as a dime. And then it just zipped, just like that.
   It came out of nowhere, and it just stopped right up above us, and it
   did a zigzag. If I had a flashlight I could show you what it did. It
   went over here, it went over there, and then it was gone, just like
   that.
   // Adam indicated its movements, with his hands, pointing in the air //

Q> So it actually stopped, motionless and hovered? And then you saw it
   startup instantly, with no startup speed, it just instantly accelerated
   and took off at sharp angles?

A> Yes. No sound whatsoever, and my dad got to see the last glimpse of
   it as it took off.

Q> Did you have any animals or pets around? Did they seem disturbed in
   any way?

A> Not that I can remember. I know that is what I saw.

Q> What time of day or night was it?

A> This was like, 11 o'clock, to midnight. Late at night.

Q> And it was in the summer time, what month?

A> July.

Q> of 1971?

A> Yes.

Q> And living by the airport, you knew what airplanes, and what different
   kinds of planes looked like? And you think it absolutely was not a plane?

A> Right. It all happened so fast. It happened in a period of three to
   five seconds, and it was gone.

Q> What about Oregon?

A> Oh yes, down in Oregon. My nefue was with me. We were skywatching and
   we got to see one. Yes, that was wierd, because I told Matt "yes, if you
   watch the sky long enough, you will be able to see something." I wasn't
   really too sure that we would see anything myself. And we were sitting
   out in the back yard, and sure enough. What it looked like was shaped
   like a fat bannana. It had lights moving through it, you know, how like
   if you take a pan of water and you set it on the floor, and the sun hits
   it just right, it reflects on the ceiling? Ok, if you move the pan, the
   water ripples. Thats the kind of light it had. It would just go back and
   forth, back and forth. And it just flew right over the top of us. It
   kind of curved over like this, over our heads and kept on going.

Q> What color was it?

A> Actually the lights, it was almost like a rainbow of lights. It was
   wierd. I have never seen anything like it. The closest thing thing I can
   come to describing it is a, like I say, a pan of water laying on the
   floor and the sunlight reflecting on it and you know hitting the ceiling.
   That's happened a couple of times just by accident. I've noticed my
   mother's houseplants. She would water the houseplants, and they would get
   over watered. And the sun would hit the water just right and would
   reflect on the celing. If the water rippled in any way, it moved back and
   forth. Thats the exact same kind of light it was.

Q> This was at then night then, apparently?

A> Yes.

Q> What time of year?

A> Summertime.

B> What about up around Albion up there? Where they had a rash of cattle
   mutilations going on, a, back in the mid seventies. They had a young
   couple that we happened to know out there. Then when some people went
   into their trailer one afternoon, there was cups of coffee warm,
   cigarettes smoldering in ashtrays, and not a sign of anyone around. And
   no one ever saw them again.

Q> What year was that?

B> That was 1976?

Q> What time of year?

B> Summer. Right around the time when they were having the cattle
   mutilations up around Albion. They thought it was devil worshippers or
   something. But a, there was quite a few of them, cattle that had their
   blood drained, their genitals removed, other things had been done. Then
   they just had the cattle mutilations down here. That were on the police
   scanner, that they haven't mentioned in the papers. I have seen one or
   two things in the night sky that didn't look quite normal. A little
   place up around there, that they call Magic Wood.

Q> Up where?

B> Up in Pullman. Its up above where a, up above Merman drive. Up above
   North Campus Heights, and out in the wheat fields. We used to go out
   there and camp, in the summertime sometimes. Case of beer, whatever.
   There was one occasion when there was me and two other people out there.
   They saw the same thing too. It was a light about the size of a, again
   about the same size, about the size, well, about half the size of a
   thumb at arms length. It looked like it was over the Kamiak Butte area.
   See the butte from up in that field, that little spot up there.

Q> What was it doing?

B> It a, was sitting. When we first spotted it, it was just kind of
   hanging in the air, you know. It was moving around real slow and lazy.
   Like a, almost like a hot air ballon would or something. You know, just
   kind of hanging, and moving really slowly. But the patterns. It would go
   straight up, then it would drop straight down, then it would move to the
   left and to the right. You know, so you could tell it had to have some
   kind of power. Because it was maneuvering. But it was doing it with a
   slow lazy movement of a balloon, you know. We watched it for about ten
   minutes. And then the thing came towards Pullman. We were kind of
   Northeast of town. It moved from Kamiak Butte towards the Northwest side
   of town, so it was kind of moving at an angle from where we were. It
   accelerated real fast in a direction, kind of coming towards Pullman.
   Then it was probably somewhere close to Albion. You know, it was somewhere
   between Kamiak Butte and Pullman on the Northwest side of Pullman. So it
   would have been moving almost due south from the butte. It was probably
   between half and three quarters the way towards Pullman when it increased
   in size to about, oh, fourty percent more than what it was. And it went
   straight up and disappeared. There were several people out there. There
   was me, Tim, Dave.

Q> What year was that again?

B> That would have been when I was nineteen. Would have been about 73, 74,
   something like that.

Q> What about those strange underground complexes? Another level below
   the normal heat tunnels on campus?

B> The library in pullman has several underground areas. WSU campus,
   from what I have heard, is like the third in line for federal capitol
   during a disaster. If it went down in Washington, it would go to Denver.
   If Denver went under, they would use the WSU / UofI campuses as a
   Government center. One of the reasons is because they have all those
   underground levels at the library that have all kinds of documents and
   stuff. They are supposed to have copies of every document DC has, on
   microfilm down there.

Q> Every document?

B> Yes. All the documents that are produced in congress and stuff are
   supposedly. They have copies of them on microfilm in the basement of the
   WSU library.

Q> Describe that underground area. You've been through those heat tunnels.
   How do you get to it?

B> I am sure there is access, there has to be access, through the library
   itself. I've been down in some of the sub-basements of the library. They
   were clearing out a bunch of old army rations, and my mom was getting a
   bunch of stuff from the fallout shelters that they were getting rid of.
   And I have been down in the fallout shelters up there. There are a big
   set of heavy doors that lead to an elevator that go down further.
   Through the heat tunnels there is one area where you come up to that's
   kind of behind the library. That is down on the intermural field,
   between the stadium and the bookstore down there, and in front of the
   gymnasiums. The heat tunnel goes over to the side of the hill, and then
   it just ends with some hatches that come up into a little concrete
   platform that is up above the field. The pipes go down. There is a door
   that you open up in the floor, and you go down. And there is a big huge
   bolt like blast door, and the cement wall, and the cabling and stuff
   runs through the wall and into that area. So you know, you can't get down
   any further than that, because there is a big huge door in the way.

Q> And that's another level down below, even where all the transformers
   and stuff that supply the library are?

B> There is a lot of other strange things around Pullman. The vortac OMNI
   for the airport. They have the regular OMNI beacon there. But the hill
   that it sits on top of, if you look at it, has obviously been added to.
   The top has been plowed flat on it. Up above the OMNI beacon there is a
   little dome, with signs on it that say "Government property, Warning:
   do not approach within 100 feet." I had a friend of mine who went up
   there once, and cut the lock off the door. Its a hatch that goes
   underground, and there is a bunch of sizemographic stuff and other
   things under there.

A> About 1984. I was with Jody again. In the dead of winter, the middle
   of winter. Wayne was with us again. You could see Potlatch's smog just
   creeping along the hill there. There weren't any stars. There wasn't
   really a breeze blowing or anything. It was colder than Hell that
   winter. It was below zero. We were all walking. We were up there by the
   theatre. The movie theatre right behind B&C Meats. We were cutting
   through behind there. We were walking. I think there were a couple more
   people with us too. All I noticed was, out of the corner of my eye, this
   flicker, you know. And I looked over, and I said, "WOW look at THAT" and
   it was a blue light. Just perfectly round. And it kind of did this. It
   just kind of bounced like this. And it did a circle like this. And
   another circle. And it flipped up, and it was gone.
   // Adam made more hand gestures in the air, to show maneuvering //

Q> How far would you say it was away?

A> It was over the Lewiston hill. It was probably that far above the
   hill. It looked like it was just riding right up along top of the hill
   up there. Everyone else got to see it too. It was really strange, just a
   blue light. Just blue.

Q> About the size of a dime at arms length?

A> No. This was much smaller. When it did that last flip, it disappeared
   into the smog, or a cloud, or something. Because you could see it just
   kind of like, it went behind a cloud, and then it was gone. It was colder
   than Hell that year. This was at night. About 9:30 to 10 o'clock at night.
   I've never seen anything like that since. One time I was with Dan, we went
   up to, a, Sacajawea Jr. High. I saw something that night too.

Q> What year was that?

A> 1985

Q> 85, a year later? What did it look like?

A> Triangles. Perfect triangles. Bright blue light. And there were two of
   them, right beside one another. I still think, you know. I don't know,
   it was wierd. If that is seeing things, I'll tell you, they are realistic
   as Hell, because Dan saw it too. It was there, and gone so fast, you
   know. It was just like somebody threw triangle lights through the air,
   and they just went over our heads, and then they were gone. But they
   disappeared behind the Lewiston hill. I mean, two blinks and you would
   have missed it.

Q> Did they show up as a triangle? Or were there like, just three lights,
   on the points?

A> They were just like glowing, whole triangles.

Q> Were they perfect triangles? Or were they more like a paper airplane
   viewed from top? Long on two sides, short on the back, arrow shaped?

A> Yes! More pointed, like an arrow. I am dead serious. Bright blue.
   Bright blue. Dan, he was funny, because he went 'WOW'. He was like this
   for about two minutes. Just, you know, pointing at the direction that
   they disappeared. We just looked at each other, and that was it. We
   left.

Q> Any sounds?

A> No sound. This was in '85, in the summer. Up at Sacajawea Jr. High.
   We were sitting on the bleachers. And they just, right over the
   Lewiston hill. Disappeared behind the Lewiston hill. They looked pretty
   good sized, from the direction. There were two of them. Side by side.
   Two of them. Let me think some more here. I have seen the ones that are
   about the same size as stars. Look like regular stars. You can always
   tell a sattelite when it crosses the sky. It looks like a star, but is
   just moving. Then there are the ones that blink on and off really fast.
   I was sitting out one night watching the stars. All of sudden, it looked
   like one of the stars was really bright. Brighter than all the rest. I
   noticed it, and I was watching it. I thought I was seeing a star burning
   out, exploding. Because you can see something like that, if you are
   lucky. You know, it takes millions of years for the light light to get
   here. This is what I thought I was seeing. It got really bright. Then
   all of a sudden, it got dim again. Then it started MOVING. Then it
   started moving to the north.

Q> What year was that?

A> 1981. Late summer. August. It started moving north. It stayed dim, you
   know. A little dimmer than all the rest of the stars. It just kind of
   moved north and kind of curved over. No blinking or anything.
