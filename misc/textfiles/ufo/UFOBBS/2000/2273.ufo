PART 3




     Having worked with so many decent, honest, positively oriented
abductees, however, I believe this theory is wrong.  It is worse than
wrong--it is despicable, as despicable as blaming a rape victim for the
violence committed against her.  This attitude leaves many abductees
feeling doubly violated, first by the aliens who took them and then by
the UFO researchers to whom they turn for explanations and help.
     But it is easy to understand why such a theory would be so popular.
Humans have a deep need to believe in the power of good.  We need for
the aliens to be a good force, since we feel so helpless in their
presence.  And we need for some superior force to offer us a hope of
salvation, both personally and globally, when we consider the sorry
state of the world.
     I think the aliens know this about us--they know that we want and
hope for them to be benevolent creatures--and they use our desire for
goodness to manipulate us.  What better way to gain our cooperation than
to tell us that the things they are doing are for our own good?  But
looking at the actions, the results of alien interference such as the
long list above.  There is a great discrepancy between what we desire
from them and what they are doing to us.
     Not all abduction reports are filled with frightening or painful
events, of course.  Many people say that their alien encounters felt
benevolent, that their abductors treated them kindly or at least with a
scientific detachment.  Some abductees recall being told that they were
"special," that they were "chosen," and that they have an important task
to perform for the benefit of humanity.
     Given such a positive message, the abductees may ignore the fear
and the pain of their encounters and insist to themselves and to others
that a higher motive underlies the abduction experience.  And, in some
cases, all that an abductee remembers is a benevolent encounter and so
has no reason to assume any negative action has occurred.
     But intensive research shows that at the core of the human- alien
interaction there is a clear pattern of deception.  We know, for
instance, that "screen memories" are often used to mask an alien
abduction.  Such accounts abound, in which a person sees a familiar yet
out-of-place animal, like a deer or owl, a monkey or a rabbit, and then
experiences a period of missing time.  The person often awakens later to
find a new, unexplained scar on his body.
     Uneasiness about the encounter will persist, however, and far
different memories may start to surface in dreams or flashbacks, and
then the person seeks help to explain the uneasiness.  Quite often,
hypnotic regression is used to uncover the events behind the "screen
memory," and that is when a typical alien abduction surfaces.
     The most recent research in which I've been involved has turned up
yet a second sort of screening process.  If it turns out to be accurate,
then thousands of abduction cases are in urgent need of re-examination.
     The typical scenario of undergoing the regressive hypnosis usually
results in penetration of the initial blocked memories.
     The abductee then recalls an encounter, hitherto unremembered, such
as undergoing a physical examination of some sort, perhaps having body
tissues removed or having a gynecological exam.  Other typical reports
include the taking of sperm and ova, of being told of an important task
to be carried out, or of receiving a warning of upcoming disaster.
     And in most cases, both the abductee and the investigator come away
from the hypnosis session feeling that they have discovered the truth
about the experience.  Rationalization leads them to believe that the
aliens' purposes must be scientifically objective or benevolent.  The
less threatening and more benevolent the hypnotically recalled event
seems, the more satisfied are the investigator and the abductee.  "That
wasn't so bad, now, was it?  These beings are our friends, or at least
they are not our enemies."  And everyone goes away with a sense of
relief.  I have yet to hear of a researcher who actually questions the
uncovered scenario.
     But from several recent cases, it is apparent that these recovered
memories may well also be yet another screen, masking events that are
much more reprehensible.  I will explain one such case, to make the
point clear.

A STRANGE REPORT.

     A man in his late 40's came to us to explore several alien- related
events in his life, and in the interview he told of a strange, although
not apparently alien-oriented, episode that had haunted him since
childhood.  When he was ten years old, his grandmother came to visit in
his home, and since the house was small, she shared his bed on the first
night of her visit.
     During the night, the boy was awakened by a loud male voice. He
couldn't understand what the voice was saying, but it sounded angry and
was addressing the grandmother lying beside him.
     The next morning, he asked his grandmother, "What was that voice in
the bedroom last night?"
     His grandmother, with tears in her eyes, pulled him tightly to her
and said, "That was the devil."  She said nothing more about the
episode, but she did insist that her son take her back to her own home
immediately.  It was an unreasonable request, and her son tried to talk
her out of it.  But the grandmother was adamant, and finally her son
agreed to take her home the following day.
     The entire family made the trip of over a hundred miles back to the
grandmother's farm, and within an hour of their arrival, the grandmother
suffered a massive stroke and died.  Ever since that event, the man had
felt a heavy burden of guilt associated with his grandmother's death.
Yet there was no conscious reason for him to have felt that way.  The
entire event was poignant and mystifying, but in all the alien
encounters he had subsequently undergone, he had felt that the aliens
were his friends and were helping him by expanding his psychic
abilities.
     A regression session was arranged, and in the course of the
hypnosis, he was asked to look at that childhood experience. What he
recalled was an abduction in which he and his grandmother were taken to
a spacecraft in the company of reptilian aliens. He remembered the
aliens telling his grandmother that they were interested in learning
about her knowledge of medicinal herbs.
     And they offered to exchange medical information of their own.
     They gave the boy and the grandmother a liquid to drink, explaining
that it was beneficial and would make the grandmother feel young and
attractive again.  So both of them drank the liquid, and the man
remembered seeing his grandmother indeed looking much younger.  That was
the extent of his recollection.
     Both he and Ms. Bartholic, who was conducting the regression, were
puzzled by this, because there was nothing in the episode to account for
the guilt he had felt about the grandmother's death.  So Ms. Bartholic
deepened the man's trance level and asked him to look at it again, with
much clearer vision.  And what he then recalled was much more
disturbing.
