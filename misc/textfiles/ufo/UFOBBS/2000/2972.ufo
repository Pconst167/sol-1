Well, I've just heard a rather interesting news. There is a UFO
that has been seen often during the last two months. Always in
the same area, and always between 21:00 and 21:30.

        Francois Bourbeau, which is heading the OVNI-ALERTE
(OVNI is the french for UFO) organisation, was called. He went
there and has seen the object, has videotaped it (for about 2.5
minutes). There was some observation done with binocular and
with a telescope (no mention of their respective
specifications).

        It has been detected by the radar at Mirabel airport.

        The object was at approximately 7 KM (5.25 miles) from
the observation point. Two days ago, a witness saw it over its
backyard (200 feet away).

        That's about all the data I've got for now. I'll add
some more if I find more.
                                                        Jacques
