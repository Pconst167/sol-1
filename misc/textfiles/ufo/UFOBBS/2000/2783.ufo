                  Yes! It's time for another installment of...

                          "Theater of the Long Winded"

          Brought to you tonight by the Society for Unintended Studies


      In today's episode Uncle Dan, that gruff but lovable moderator of the 
    Human Dimensions echo,  gets in over his head and,  as usual,  delivers 
    one of his typically off centered, but thoroughly strange editorials... 

      And now, with the wave of a hand, the curtain rises, the house lights 
    dim, and a small but steady spotlight finds its way to the podium where 
    our  evenings lector stands ill at ease,  but with enough enthusiasm to 
    keep from running off as he sees the audience, tomatoes in hand, poised 
    and ready as kittens on newly found mice. 

                         Nevertheless, he proceeds. . .

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Disclaimer: Since this is my personal theory, and only an editorial,  I 
                do not plan to include a bibliography, or overly long drawn 
                out exemplary structures in genetic coding, RNA/DNA, or the 
                structures of the neural pathways dealing specifically with 
                genetic  communication.  I  don't think my  typing  fingers 
                could  take that much abuse,  and proving natural selection 
                is not my specific point in writing this editorial. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
      In the past years,  through my observations and moderate studies into 
    the genetic structure of homo-sapien,  it has come to be my belief that 
    at  this  point  in time,  we are beginning to  visibly  experience  an 
    emergence of something exceptionally rare.  Our species,  in my belief, 
    is moving into a state where the genetic factors that control and route 
    our  neural-communicative structures are now reaching a point in  their 
    mutations wherein they are allowing dormant facilities to become viable 
    and active. 

      This is not something that has only recently happened,  but  has been 
    underway for countless millenia,  and has occurred several times in the 
    past to the human species as a whole since the beginning of our  genus. 
    This  process of natural selection has,  by nature,  always been one of 
    genetic  origin and has brought us to our present state,  and will take 
    us further, as I believe it is doing now. 

      With  the emergence of the humankind,  genetic  instructions  dealing 
    with the communication processes of thought and action were simplistic, 
    and allowed for only the simplest of neural-structural  communications, 
    that originally being "Survival."   As time moved onward,  the mutation 
    of the  genetic code allowed for the routing of other neural   pathways  
    to  become  active  wherein  other  forms of  new  communication   were 
    possible and manifested themselves accordingly,   and so on  throughout 
    all  of  the  classic  evolutionary forms of  higher  intelligence  and 
    communication. 

      So basically,  Man starts out as a really simple, and not too bright, 
    creature,   and evolves to what he is today through the extremely  slow 
    process  of  genetic mutation and concurrent re-routing of  the  neural 
    pathways.  Natural selection. . .

                       "Theater of the Long Winded". . .

      When  we last left off,  Uncle Dan was just about to get to the point 
    of  his editorial.   As we know from experience,  that is not something 
    that is accomplished easily for him. . . 

                               Now let's return.

    Ahem... (Clearing throat)... 
            (Taking a small sip of water)... 
            (Clearing his throat for the second time)... 
            (The microphone does not seem to work)... 
            (Tap... Tap... Tap... Testing 1 2 3...) 

      Ah, there we are!   In part one, we covered my view of the process of 
    natural  selection as brought about through the genetic code  mutation.  
    In  this  continuation,   I   will endeavor to connect  this  with  the 
    phenomena of specific extra-terrestrial activities on this, our planet. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Disclaimer:  I must,  at this point, clarify something.   Before anyone 
                 presumes  that I am theorizing that we as a race  are  the 
                 genetic experiment of some other-worldly civilization, let 
                 me assure you that this is not my attempt at such. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
      All life  forms that we are familiar with  continually  going through 
    genetic mutation on a day to day bases,  but every once in awhile, over 
    hundreds of thousands of years (as speculated,) the mutations reaches a 
    state  where  the  genetic  coding  can  structurally  allow  for   the 
    activation and maintenance of newly routable neural circuitry.  This is 
    the process of an evolving species in action!   The very keys of who we 
    were, who we are, and who we will be as we meet the future ahead. 

      From  a good section of the contact and abduction reports I have come 
    across, which is by no means an exhaustive collection, a  common thread 
    emerges.    In many reported conversations with  extraterrestrial  life 
    forms,  ET's, specifically a certain groups called "Greys",  and others 
    that are of similar makeup, have commented that their very existence is 
    threatened  due to genetic problems within their species and they  need 
    to radically improve/change their genetic strain,  else they will cease 
    to be. 

      If I may digress for a moment. . . 

      In my youth, I  found out where our planet was located in relation to 
    the  rest of the galaxy.   I  found myself questioning the reasons  why 
    extra-terrestrials would want to come here.   After all,  we sit in the 
    western spiral arm of the galaxy,  a  veritable desolate no-man's-land. 
    Surely  there  must  be some other planets with similar life  forms  as 
    ourselves,   and  inevitably  much  closer to the  center  of  galactic 
    activity that would easily be much more suitable for experimentation or 
    information gathering than our small, out of the way, little planet! So 
    why do they keep coming?  I have one speculative answer. . . 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
                                    Part III 

      Now  I  know  I'm  probably making a stretch here,  but  as  you  can 
    probably see, there is a highly possible connection between the genetic 
    evolution of the human species,  and the attention we are getting  from 
    the outside. 

      The  firing  off of formerly dormant genetically  triggered   neural-
    circuits  is something  so rare;   a  new phase in out evolution,   and 
    if  our  genetic  structures  are similar  to  those  of  other-worldly 
    cultures,  then this is an  event of such magnitude and importance that 
    it would draw  interest from near and far.  In the current state of our 
    genetic development,  we may  be  seen  by some as a source of  genetic 
    salvation for  an  ailing alien  civilization.    In  others  this  may  
    be  nothing  more  than  a scientific rarity that must be be catalouged 
    and  studied.    In  any case,  we  are  moving  into a new  era  as  a 
    species,  and with or  without  an audience,  it's the greatest show in 
    the universe. . . 

      To bring this into summary form, let me say this, then I'll leave you 
    alone and shut up. . . 

      The  unique genetic evolutionary state which we are in presently  has 
    made us a very curious and important commodity.  We are in the midst of 
    a  change  as a species,  and although this has been transpiring for  a 
    great  deal  of  time,  it has finally come to the place where  we  are 
    seeing genetic change in an ever increasingly tangible manner.   In  my 
    opinion, this is the about the only reason we are being visited at all. 
    Right now, whether voluntarily or not,  we have something to offer that 
    the rest of the galaxy wants,  or wants part in.  But we should rejoice 
    in this!   We are seeing the evolution of creation taking place  within 
    each of us. 

    Take care,
