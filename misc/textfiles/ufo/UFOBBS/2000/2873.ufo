            Navarro as mentioned in the Fate  article  on the 1897 Airships
            (AERO1 through AERO3 on KeelyNet).  Mr. Jimmy Ward has provided
            us with  a  series  of papers written by both  Pete  and  Jimmy
            several years  ago.  These papers are sourced from the original
            Dellschau notebooks with correlations  and information provided
            by the authors.

            In our  attempts  to  integrate  a wide range of studies, we at
            Vangard Sciences are of the opinion that the Airship inventors,
            particularly those Airships described  by DELLSCHAU, discovered
            one of the many gases we believe to exist below  Hydrogen.  The
            N.B. gas  would  easily  fit  within  the  26 anticipated gases
            having a mass number of less than 1.008, that of Hydrogen.

            If we  can  rediscover  how the  gas  was  extracted  from  the
            atmosphere, it will open up entirely new avenues  of transport.
            Note that   Hydrogen  is  the  MOST  ABUNDANT  element  in  the
            Universe.  If Hydrogen is a  composite  of  other  elements  as
            Keely found, then N.B. gas must be one of those elements and in
            greater abundance.

                            The Great Airship Inventors
                                  Fact and Fancy

       In 1896, all  up  and  down the Sacramento Valley of  California,  a
       blinding light was  seen coming from an aerial object and playing on
       the ground below.  The adverse weather appeared to have NO EFFECT on
       the object - it sailed majestically  and  smoothly along DESPITE the
       rain and wind, from Oroville to San Francisco and  from  Oakland  to
       Sacramento.  What was this strange object with the brilliant light?


                                      Page 1

       R. Boynton, editor  of  the Oroville Register, thought he might have
       the answer.  A few years back, he  recalled, there was a mining camp
       called Cherokee, at the top of Table Mountain, overlooking Oroville.
       Many of its  workers were of Portuguese extraction.   In  the  early
       80s, he said,  they  worked  the bluffs and celebrated big days with
       balloon ascensions.  Huge blazing torches would be suspended beneath
       the balloons on long ropes and they would float off over the valley,
       making for quite a show.

       The problem is that the torches would  soon  burn out and the people
       were now reporting a light MUCH BRIGHTER than a torch  and, besides,
       it was A  BEAM  OF  LIGHT that was reported shining down.  To top it
       all off, the mining had stopped and the Portuguese HAD LEFT THE AREA
       SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE.  Still, Table  Mountain  WOULD  make  an ideal
       site for secret experiments and base of operations due to its rather
       inaccessible location and yet nearness to a fair-sized town.

       Much has been written about these mystery airships,  but little real
       research has been  undertaken.   Most  writers  have relied on other
       writers and their own preconceived  opinions  and  errors  have been
       compounded.  The first sighting is usually given as "sometime during
       the week of Thanksgiving", but REALLY occurred during the first week
       in November, the   story  first  appeared  in  the   papers   during
       Thanksgiving week.  There  is  a  possibility  of  an  even  earlier
       sighting.

       On September 20, 1896, an astronomer  named  Swift  noticed  a light
       about the magnitude of Venus at its brightest out over  the  Pacific
       Ocean.  It was about 1 degree from the setting sun and thought to be
       a new comet.   The  next evening it was not there.  Weeks later they
       mystery light would be seen to go  out  over the ocean several times
       and disappear or come in from the ocean and head inland.

       There are differing  versions  of  the  first real sighting  of  the
       craft, but the gist of the event is as follows:

          As dusk  was descending on San Francisco, His Honor, Mayor Sutro,
          arrived at his mansion which was  West of the city and overlooked
          the ocean.  A light was seen coming in from the  direction of the
          Pacific.  It  passed  over  Seal  Rocks  shining  its beam on the
          seals, sending them complaining into the water.

       One account quoted the witnesses as describing the craft as having a
       bright light fore and aft and a  row  of  smaller  lights  along its
       side; however, this  appears  to have been an embellishment  by  the
       reporter because as  it  leisurely  sailed over Twin Peaks, all that
       could be seen was a bright beam  of  light  emitted  by  a  dark and
       formless source.  Cable  cars  stopped and the passengers  and  crew
       piled out to  watch the wonder silently pass overhead.  What was it?
       Where had it come from?

       November 1, 1896, the Detroit Free  Press  reported that in the near
       future a New  York  inventor  would  construct and  fly  an  "aerial
       torpedo boat."  On  November  17,  1896,  a telegram was reported to
       have been received by the Sacramento  Bee from a man in New York who
       claimed that he  was  about  to  fly to California along  with  some
       friends.  He said  the  trip should take about two days.  This might
       explain the later sightings, but  what  about  the  prior sightings?
       And there WERE earlier ones!

       One of the  earliest  man-made airship stories appeared in the Santa
       Fe Daily New Mexican of March 26,  1880.   It  told  of  an enormous
       airship that swept over this tiny town of Galisteo Junction.  It was
       cigar shaped with  a tail and was driven by a huge  propellor.   The
       occupants were described  as  inebriated  and a couple of items were
       thrown overboard - a beautiful rose  fastened  with  a  slip of fine
       silk-like paper containing what was thought to have  been  "Oriental
       characters" and a cup "of very peculiar workmanship."

       The next morning  the  items  were on display at the railroad depot.
       That evening a stranger appeared,  pronounced  them  of Asian origin
       and made the "owner" a financial deal he could not  refuse.  The man
       and objects then  disappeared as would happen again and again in the
       future of UFOs.

       The story of C.A.A. Dellschau and  the  Sonora  Aero  Club  has been
       presented as the core of this series of articles.  But they were not
       the only ones  who  laid  claim  to the invention  of  the  earliest
       airships in the   World.   In  "Milestones  of  the  Air"  there  is
       reproduced a pair  of  stereo photos  showing  Frederick  Marriott's
       "Avitor" airship/airplane combination, flown in California  in 1869.
       While Marriott was  not  THE man behind the Airships nearly 30 years
       later, his ideas  played a part in  many  later  designs.   And  his
       "Avitor" bore a striking resemblance to many of these  later  ships.
       One major difference  between  the "Avitor" and the airships is that
       the "Avitor" utilized a football-shaped  gas bag and the later ships
       were often described as MADE OF METAL or "Aluminum looking."

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       The famous Aurora,  Texas,  "spaceship"  crash  is a  good  example.
       While there is a good probability that this story was a hoax, it may
       have some basis in fact.  The following story was told to the author
       and permission to  tell  it in print was given PROVIDED the names of
       the people involved were changed.

       In 1888, a 15 year old boy was living  with  his  widowed mother and
       sisters on a small farm near the now extinct town of  Grundy, Texas.
       While working in  the  garden he heard what he thought was a clap of
       thunder.  Before he could look up  from his weeding, things began to
       fall around him, hard little pieces of metal, larger pieces and many
       heavy objects which  struck the ground.  He fled for  cover  in  the
       house.

       After things stopped  falling,  he went back outside and walked over
       to a large object on the ground,  which  moved,  and  proved to be a
       man.  He was  badly hurt, having fallen quite a distance  to  earth.
       His mother and  sisters arrived and helped him move the man into the
       house, out of the hot Texas sun.

       The people at Grundy heard the noise and some men rode out from town
       to investigate.  At the farm they  found out about the "man who fell
       from the sky."  Some doubted, some laughed; yet they  all had a look
       at this man.  And they told the mother and her children that the man
       was not to be moved until the Sheriff could be summoned to the farm.
       The Sheriff was  not at Grundy and it would take a couple of days to
       fetch him.  The man regained consciousness that evening and he spoke
       to them, but they could not understand  his  language.  They offered
       him food, but the only things he accepted were water and a piece of

                                      Page 3

       melon.  A few  hours  later  he died.  The family was afraid to move
       the body until the Sheriff came,  so  they  wrapped him in a blanket
       and left his body on the bed.

       The Sheriff did not show up the next day, but several hundred people
       from Grundy and  the surrounding countryside did.   The  riders  had
       told everyone in  sight  about the man out at the farm and they came
       in wagons, on  horseback,  and on  foot  to  see  him.   The  people
       crowding in at  the  window  flattened  the garden and  what  people
       didn't trample, the  horses  did.   All  day  long people showed up,
       needing water for their horses.   They  emptied  the tank and pumped
       the well dry.

       When night fell, the family slipped the body out  of  the  house and
       buried it away from the house along with the things the man had with
       him.  The well  went completely dry and, having no reserve water, no
       food left in the garden, and no money  to  have  a new well dug, the
       family was forced into abandoning the farm.

       This story may be considered a pure figment of the  imagination, but
       several years later, in 1944, this teen-age boy, now an elderly man,
       told the story  to  some friends.  Their faces must have shown doubt
       because he suddenly rose, left the  house and returned a few minutes
       later with several  pieces  of  metal,  one  he   handed   out   for
       examination and the rest he placed on the wood stove.

       The first piece  was  very light, about 1/2 inch thick and, roughly,
       6" by 9",  concave on one side, convex  on  the  other.   The  edges
       looked like they had been "torn", with a crystal structure  at right
       angles to the  face.   The  metal was a silver-gray color.  It could
       not be scratched with a file nor dented  with  a hammer, even on the
       edges.

       The old man then took the pieces of metal from the stovetop with his
       bare hands and passed them around.  It was heavier  than  the  first
       piece and of  smaller  dimensions.  It was a dark bluish color.  And
       it was NOT hot, although it had laid on the stove top long enough to
       be VERY hot!  Though of obvious different  composition,  this  piece
       could not be scratched or dented either.  When his friends commented
       that they must  be pieces of some new metal for airplanes,  the  old
       man laughed and said he'd had those fragments since HE WAS A KID!

       They were some of the pieces he had picked up when the man fell from
       the sky.  He  also  said that many of those who had come by had also
       picked up pieces, but he did not  know  if  any  of  them were still
       around.  He DID know that there were still pieces to be found around
       the old farm.

            (While the author has not personally visited the site nor knows
             of its EXACT location, he was in contact with  a gentleman who
             said he had found it in North Texas near the Panhandle.  (Near
             Amarillo or Canyon, possibly...Vangard)

             There were no buildings there, only traces where they had once
             stood.  He  also  found  a  few  small pieces of shrapnel-like
             metal slightly buried in the  soil.   But before a full report
             could be  made  or  the  metal tested, he died  in  a  traffic
             accident and  his wife threw the fragments away along with his
             notes.

             Anyone who  has  information  about strange fragments of metal
             from this  area  or  is  interested  in  pursuing  this  story
             personally, please  contact  me  through  KeelyNet   (info  at
             beginning of this file).)

       As mentioned previously,  the  Grundy airship and the Aurora airship
       stories have a  number of points  in  common.   We  may  never  know
       whether they are two different stories or one based  on  the  other.
       With the 3-ring  circus atmosphere at Aurora, the destruction caused
       by over-zealous "investigators",  as  well  as the harassment of the
       citizens, it is no wonder people began to deny the  event  ever took
       place and claimed it was a hoax from the beginning!

       But was it entirely a hoax?  Could there have been some truth in it?
       Could there be a stranger's body buried somewhere in the cemetery?

       Maybe not an Alien but A HUMAN BODY belonging to an airship inventor
       who spoke a language other than English?  To prevent the same things
       from happening in  the  Grundy  story,  the  names  of  the families
       involved and their present whereabouts  have  been withheld, pending
       further investigation.  The town of Grundy no longer  exists and had
       not for many  years, so no ones privacy will be invaded by divulging
       ITS name.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       More down to Earth, so to speak, are the following stories :

         The Galveston Daily News of April 29, 1897 reads:

            "It may be that those people  out  west  who  for  the last six
             months have  been  filling  the  papers  with  accounts  of  a
             mysterious airship  which  they  have  seen in the sky are not
             monumental liars after all.   It  is possible that experiments
             now being made by the U.S. Government with a view to producing
             a genuine air ship may be responsible for their visions.

            "For several years the government has had in its employ a well-
             known aeronaut, who gets, it is said, a salary  of  $10,000  a
             year, and  constant  work and experiment have been going on at
             Fort Logan,  near  Denver.    A   profound  secrecy  has  been
             maintained as  to  what  has  been  accomplished,   even  Army
             officers themselves  only  getting  vague  inklings of what is
             going on."

       Somehow this sounds familiar in today's  UFO  world.  Who this well-
       known aeronaut really was, was not divulged, but papers  across  the
       country listed dozens of POSSIBLE inventors of the mystery airships,
       among the many named included the following partial list :

              George Jennings                -  Fresno, California
              W. H. Warren                   -  Hayward, California
              John A. Horen                  -  San Jose, California
              Anton Pallardy                 -  Beatrice, Nebraska
              H. John O. Prease              -  Omaha, Nebraska
              Clinton A. Case (A.C. Clinton) -  Omaha, Nebraska
              Charles Clinton                -  Dodge City, Kansas
              Harry Tibbs                    -  Louisville, Kentucky
              Edward J. Pennington           -  Mount Carmel, Illinois

                                      Page 5
              C. Devonbaugh                  -  Vandalia, Illinois
              Valney Stewart                 -  Brule, Wisconsin

       Other names tossed around included :

             J. F. Calipha                  George Francis Train
             Prof. Charles Davidson         Albert Whipple

       Three names are not included in the above lists :

           C.A.A. Dellschau  -  the  central  character  of  this series of
                              articles,
           Mr. Wilson       - the pilot of an airship reported in the first
                              of this series  and  his  equally  mysterious
                              "rich Uncle", and
           Dr. Benjamin     - and HIS uncle.

       Early in November, 1896, a Bay Area attorney had received assurances
       from an inventor, who wished to remain anonymous, that  the problems
       of air travel  had  been  solved,  George D. Collins let it leak out
       that the mystery  craft seen over  Sacramento  and  the  surrounding
       countryside was the invention of his new client.   He  later  stated
       that $100,000 and  five  years had gone into perfecting the 150 foot
       machine and that he had been "favored  with  a  demonstration  at  a
       secret location."  By the 22nd, his home and office  were overrun by
       reporters and just plain snoopers, pressing him for details.

       Backed into a  corner, Collins admitted that the craft was hidden in
       a barn in Berkeley during the daylight hours and that a Dr. Benjamin
       had something to do with the builiding of it.  "Dr. Benjamin" turned
       outo be E. H. Benjamin of Ellis  Street,  a  34-year  old  bachelor,
       dentist, and dabbler with inventions and recently from  somewhere in
       Maine.  He denied  any  knowledge of this ship.  He did admit he had
       frequently visited an unnamed uncle  at  Oroville  and  that  he had
       privately confided to friends that he had invented  something  which
       would revolutionise the world.

       Government agents, detectives, reporters and railroad men were quick
       to swarm over Oroville especially when they heard Benjamin say that,
       if he HAD  invented the craft, he wouldn't be so foolish as to admit
       it in public.  The uncle was never  found  nor was any evidence that
       an airship had been built there as claimed.

       Attorney Collins, hounded  by  reporters,  the  curious,   and   the
       outright cranks, changed his story completely and denied ever having
       ANY knowledge at all of the craft.  The Patent Office in Washington,
       D.C., was flooded   with   inquiries   about   Collins  application.
       Disclaimers were returned instead.

       "Aluminum Benjamin", as he became  known  probably  because  several
       close witnesses claimed it looked "like aluminum", complained to the
       press that he had to move to escape the curious and  that  eating in
       public restaurants proved  to  be  impossible  because throngs would
       quickly gather to stare, giggle, and  gesture  at the windows of the
       establishment.  He feared  his  mind  would  soon  become  unhinged.
       Benjamin finally fled  the area leaving what personal effects he had
       behind in his apartment.

       In the meantime, Collins had been  fired  for  talking  too much and
       slowly faded out of the picture.  W. H. H. Hart now came forward

                                      Page 6

       claiming that HE  was  in  secret  communication  with the inventor.
       Hart was a former State Attorney General,  a  bearded, distinguished
       looking gentleman and one of the most respected men in California.

       In the 1907 issue of the National Cyclopedia of American  Biography,
       it was stated  that Hart was the discoverer of "the only mine in the
       world in which   osmium  is  found   in   metal   form....in   large
       quantities."  The metal  was  used  chiefly  in the  manufacture  of
       electric storage batteries.   One  of  the  chief  features of these
       aircraft were their powerful SEARCHLIGHTS that could turn night into
       day from hundreds of feet above.

       Hart also stated that while he knew  very  little  about the airship
       THERE, he had been concerned with its sister ship  IN  THE  EAST for
       some time.  He  refused  to  say  much about either ship and nothing
       about the inventors  or  where  the  ships  were  built  or  housed.
       Sightings became rare and with no NEW news, the story  was dropped -
       unsolved!

       Then in the  April 12, 1897, issue of the Chicago Journal appeared a
       brief item.  It stated that Oscar  D.  Booth  of  158  South  Peoria
       Street firmly believed  the  strange  object  seen   was  indeed  an
       airship.  It seems  Mr. Booth was ready to build one himself and was
       merely waiting for the return of the  Secretary  of the Booth Flying
       Machine Company whose name, by the way, was E. H. BENJAMIN!

       Coincidence?  Coincidences abound  in  the  story   of   the   Great
       Airships.  A few  have been brought out in this article.  Another in
       the following.

       Several times and in different parts  of  the country witnesses have
       stated that they  had met the captain/or crew of the  local  airship
       and had been informed the craft had been to THE MONTEZUMA MOUNTAINS.

       In researching the  Dellschau material, he, too, mentioned flying to
       the MONTEZUMA MOUNTAINS, but no map  could be found showing any such
       mountains.  Finally, two old maps were found.  One Mexican map shows
       a range of mountains in the southern part of California  just  below
       San Francisco that  bear  the label MONTEZUMA MOUNTAINS.  (The exact
       peaks have not yet been identified with today's labelling.)

       A second old map shows another Montezuma Mountains.  This one in New
       York.  It is now, ironically, a wild  fowl  preserve  and is not too
       far from Goshen, New York, the alleged home of the  mysterious  "Mr.
       Wilson" and HIS uncle!
