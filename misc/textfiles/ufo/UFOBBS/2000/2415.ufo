During the great sighting outbreak of early November 1957, a number of close 
encounters had a disturbing consequence: burns and related injuries to 
witnesses. One of the most dramatic occurrences took place at an army base at 
Itaipu along Brazil's Atlantic coast. At 2 A.M. on November 4 two guards saw a 
luminous orange disc coming in over the ocean at a low altitude and an 
alarming rate of speed. As it passed above the soldiers, the disc came to an 
instant stop. The two witnesses suddenly felt a wave of heat and a horrifying 
sensation as if they had burst into flame. Their screams brought other 
soldiers stumbling out of their barracks just in time to see the UFO streak 
away. At that moment the fort's entire electrical system failed. Amid great 
secrecy the two men were rushed to a military hospital and treated during the 
next few weeks for first-and second-degree burns to ten percent of their 
bodies.

But there were other burn cases as well. In the afternoon of the same day as 
the Itaipu incident, the engines of several cars along a rural highway near 
Orogrande, New Mexico, ceased to function as an eggshaped object maneuvered 
close by. A witness who stood particularly close to it contracted a "sunburn." 
In the early morning hours of November 6, outside Merom, Indiana, a hovering 
UFO, which bather his farm in light, also seriously burned Rene Gilham's face. 
He ended up spending two days in the hospital. At around 1:30 A.M. on November 
10 a Madison, Ohio, woman saw an acorn-shaped UFO hovering just behind her 
garage. She watched it for half and hour. In the days afterward she developed 
a body rash and vision problems that her doctor believed suggested radiation 
poisoning. Subsequent medical tests uncovered no apparent cause for her 
injuries.
