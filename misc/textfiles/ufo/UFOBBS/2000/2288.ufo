Description:  

Very few aircraft and/or anomalous lights in the sky were observed the
night of 18 June 1994.  At 9:42 PM I looked directly up and saw several
bight lights above me.  Two of the lights, however, began to move towards
the south-southwest past another bright star, probably Arcturus of the
Constellation Bootes.  Both lights were about the brightness of stars, and
a little smaller than Arcturus.  One light was ahead of the other and
closer to Arcturus.  I took a time exposure of the more western light
(furthest from Arcturus) at 9:43:38 (6 seconds).  I tool a time exposure
of the more eastern light (closest to Arcturus) at 9:44:20 (14 seconds). 
As I took the second picture the light closest to Arcturus stopped and
reversed direction (towards the north-northeast), and passed the second
light.  Then both lights disappeared (dimmed and blinked out). 
 
A third light was then noticed to the south near the Moon.  It was moving
southward towards the Moon, which was to the right of its trajectory. 
Another bright star was visible to the left of the moon, probably Antares
of the Constellation Scorpius.  This third moving "star" also dimmed and
blinked out following the time exposure at 9:44:49 (15 seconds). 
 
Arcturus is listed in the Skyguide (Golden Books) as the 4th brightest
star in the sky.  Bootes is described as the son of Jupiter and Callisto. 
Arcturus is called the Watcher of the Bear. 
 
Antares is listed as the "rival of Mars," and is the double star named
from the bright red color of the primary. 
 
A recent crop glyph from England is described as the Scorpion.  Its
authenticity is based on it being formed in Rape, a crop with very stiff
stems that will snap rather than bend at this time of the season.  This
crop was bent:  Therefore it was not a hoax.  The Scorpion seems to
portray Jupiter with its four moons and the Shoemaker- Levy 9 "string of
pearls" on a collision course with Jupiter. 
 
Linking Scorpius with the Scorpion is a straight forward deduction, and if
correct would imply that the "rival of Mars." or another God of War, is
involved.  Linking the reverse movement of the paired lights to Bootes, if
correct, might symbolize a relation to Arcturus or the "son of Jupiter." 
 
In Greek mythology Scorpius is the scorpion that stung Orion to death.  In
earliest Egyptian mythology, Orion marked the resting place of the soul of
Osiris.  Osiris, ithyphallic, is the symbol of regeneration, the cyclic
nature of the universal process, and the way of successive reincarnations. 
Perhaps all of these symbols and myths, when linked with the
Shoemaker-Levy 9 Jupiter event in July, indicate that the regenerative
cycle of mankind will be disrupted or even destroyed.  And that implies
some sort of cataclysmic even impacting Earth. 


Flames will be ignored.  Only serious discussion will be answered.
