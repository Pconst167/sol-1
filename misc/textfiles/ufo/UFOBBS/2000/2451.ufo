LOG # 891204.FL
Event 2140, Gulf Breeze, Florida.
Investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry.

     A teenage brother and sister, walking home from a convenience store,
noticed two lighted bell-shaped discs moving swiftly nearby.  As they stopped
to stare, the vehicles likewise halted and hovered.  The teens again started
walking and the objects resumed their flight, only to hover once more
seemingly in response to the witnesses stopping.  Momentarily these sped out
of sight and a third identical disc approached, then dropped below a tree-line
at which point a humming sound was detected.

     Racing home, they convinced their mother to go outside.  She also heard
the sound, which continued for over a minute, though nothing further was
observed.

     Dogs in the vicinity barked until the humming sound ceased.

     The surface of all three was described as blue-grey.  White light shown
on the bottom of each of the first two, while the underside of the third
displayed brighter yellowish light.

     The total duration was estimated as five minutes.
