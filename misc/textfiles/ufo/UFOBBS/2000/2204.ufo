CELESTIAL CONTACTS NEWSLETTER
- First Published March 1994

Publisher's statement:

"Over the years, my life, like many of your lives, has been affected by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) phenomena and contacts. As a result of this, I have great anticipation that in the very near future, peaceful and cooperative communication will become established between us and our celestial neighbors.

Many of you know me as the former Executive Assistant as well as the Internal Communications Co-Chair for CSETI.  In that effort, tremendous contact experiences occurred, and they were initiated by a relative few. However, not only was CSETI getting results, but we noticed that organizations  all over the world were actively engaging ETI as well by using a wide variety of initiative techniques.

It was also apparent that there was a need for communication and networking between all of these groups and individuals. There was so much to share and so much to research, but knowing who else was out there doing the same thing was a quandary.

For this reason, Steve Dean (former CSETI Chair of Working Group Operations) and I felt the need for an 'Open and Supportive Newtwork' of individuals and groups who are striving to create their own contact reality. A reality that is mutually peaceful and productive...not only between us and Extraterrestrial Intelligences, but also between each other.

A forum is needed in which any and all techniques implemented in attempting contact with ETI can be explored and shared. Total flexibility allows broader exploration, and freedom of choice stimulates creativity.

Likewise, all findings of any group or individual are valuable and helpful. Contactees can enjoy sharing openly as well as exploring the implications of those experiences. This would open up tremendous resources and a wonderful, ongoing opportunity to network with each other.

In an effort to unite 'contact explorers' (you and I), we have created CELESTIAL CONTACTS, in the hopes that networking, sharing, and supporting one another will bring us closer to an understanding and fellowship with our celestial neighbors. We invide each and every one of you to join us in this pioneering journey...within ourselves and beyond the stars"
