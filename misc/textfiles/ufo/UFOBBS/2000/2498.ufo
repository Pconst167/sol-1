    So far, the Phoenix Project has released three reports:          
                                                                              
    * The Dulce Report (Summary file: DULCEDOC.ZIP)                  
          An  extensive  study  of  an area that was  claimed  to  have  an 
          underground U.S./Alien base.                            
                                                                              
    * The Ultimate Secret (Summary file: ULTSEC.TXT)                 
          The  Majority  Agency for Joint Intelligence (MAJI)   The  Secret     
          War Against The Aliens Star Wars (SDI) Exposed  
                                                                              
    * K-2 -- A Secret California Alien Base (Summary file: K2RPT.TXT) 
          Their  discovery  of  an underground Alien base  at  Pilot  Peak,     
          Plumas County, California. 

    More are expected to be released in mid-to-late August. 

      The  following  is  a  message I  discovered on  Fido:UFO  from  Jack 
    Mathias, Phoenix Project Spokesperson, addressed to All: 
    
      As stated  in  the  beginning  of each  of  our  reports,  [excluding 
    ULTSEC.TXT]  the  Phoenix Project is a  private,   civilian,   research 
    organization  without  any official affiliation to any  branch  of  the 
    United States government. It came into existence by chance in 1952 when 
    a group of "buddies"  met and discussed their ideas.   Even back in the 
    early days of the UFO flap it was becoming obvious that  the  truth was 
    not being released. Because of this the Phoenix Project started. As did 
    the other organizations. However,  unlike these others,  we remained in 
    the shadows, never releasing any information until it was felt the time 
    had arrived. That time has come. 
    
      The Phoenix  Project has never and does not seek publicity.  And, for 
    obvious reasons.  We also value what every other person does;  security 
    and  safety.  It is because of this that there is not much more that we 
    can say regarding our organization. 
    
      One  of our investigators became involved in the UFO cover-up  during 
    the  Mantell incident of 1948  and later became a special  investigator  
    with    Project   Blue  Book  until  1952.     Two investigators   were  
    members of the Air Force and  three  were Navy.  Each  of these people,  
    was,  at one time or  another, either attached to or connected with the 
    intelligence edifice. However,   remaining   in  the  shadows  mandates  
    that   the organizations,    divisions,  etc.,  not be disclosed.    It  
    is through  these  activities  and/or contacts made  during the time of 
    military involvement that the team has been able to  obtain much of our 
    information.  These contacts are loyal and trusted personal friends who 
    we  have  known  for more than twenty  years and since   every  bit  of 
    information  supplied  by these  people has checked  out,    we  firmly 
    believe that we have  not  been suppliedany disinformation. 
    
      Because of our past intelligence  backgrounds and to  protect this on 
    going relationship with these contacts,   revealing  our true  identity  
    could   jeopardize   the   personal   safety    of  ourselves,      our  
    families  and  theirs as well.    We  have  all witnessed  examples  of 
    "termination with extreme prejudice,"   a phrase whose  meaning is well 
    known within  the  intelligence community. 
    
    .............. 
    
      Jack  Mathias  believes  people have a reason to  doubt  the  Phoenix 
    Project findings,   since their identities will remain secret.   He did 
    think Paranet  jumped to conclusions about the Dulce and K-2   reports. 
    Jack  recommends  getting the reports for reference and go  check  them 
    out. 
    
      I cannot think  of a good reason why the  Phoenix  Project would be a 
    hoax.    The reports cost between $10.00   and $12.50,  so they are not 
    making much money from this. 
    
      If there are some  questions  about the  Phoenix Project and  I don't 
    have the answer,  I  could forward them to Jack Mathias to see what  he 
    says.

    Paul....  thanks  for starting this topic.  I  just got  information of 
    their  reports,  and as you said , they are quite reasonable.  Here are 
    some more reports they say will be ready Aug 30, 1992: 
    
    K-2 supplemental report.  
    The NASA presence at Quincy 
    The Area 51 report 
    The Joint US/Alien research base # 920815 $10 
    
    (opps,that K-2 report # is 920820 $10 ) 
    
    The"icecaves" report 
    The Los Alamos US/Alien base # 920830 $12.50 
    
    Advent Publishing Company 
    PO box 3748 
    Carson City NV. 89702 
    Send them a S.A.S.E. to get a complete list of their reports.

    I  am somewhat puzzled by these folks that call themselves the  Phoenix 
    Project.   They say they are tight personal friends of each  other  and 
    first organized themselves in 1952 after having shared careers together 
    in military intelligence. 
     
    Well,   that means they have known each other for at least forty  years 
    and  not twenty.  Also,  that should put them around seventy to  eighty 
    years  old.  Somehow,  I  am having a hard time visualing  these  folks 
    scurrying   around  the  Plumas  National  Forest  gathering   evidence 
    incognito.   It is tough enough for a young hiker to trek through  that 
    country, much less a setpuagenarian. 
     
    But,  I  guess we will never know since they feel their true identities 
    must remain secret.

    Orbital mind control lasers?
    
    Some  of the guys must be a least 60,  but there might have  been  some 
    `additions'  later on. From looking at the files, one can see that they 
    must of had help with the magnetic survey,  since I doubt that military 
    intelligence personnel are familiar with using such equipment.  As  far 
    as  age goes,  they may have had help from family and friends.  I   had 
    received  the  same type of listing as Mike did,  but I found out  that 
    people  who  received  their  lists just a  week  ago  had  a  slightly 
    different list.  The differences included a July 30th date (instead  of 
    Aug 30th) and another report called K-3 -- A Secret Alien Base used for 
    Controlled Humans.  For some reason,  they had to delay the reports  by 
    one  month.   I'm  still not sure if they are for real,   but  I  don't 
    understand  why  anyone would go through such trouble to  perpetrate  a 
    hoax.  I  heard that their logo is not a registered trademark,  as  the 
    files suggest, but the source of the info is exceedingly unreliable.

    Well,   Jack Mathias hasn't been on FidoNet for a couple of days  which 
    suggests  he  is either on a field trip or he is trying to lay low  for 
    awhile.   Maybe his `group'  doesn't like him to leak information,   or 
    someone is getting close to figuring out that it's one big hoax. 
     
    The  heliport near Quincy belongs to the forest service and there is  a 
    NASA facility along the restricted road that leads to the heliport.  At 
    night,   the  NASA  people  shine a green beam  into  the  sky.   Their 
    experiments are either related to earthquake monitoring or  atmospheric 
    monitoring. The Phoenix Project is creating a report on NASA's presence 
    there.

    You've  tricked  me  again  - first time I've been  online  "live"   in 
    sometime  - surprised to see this topic.  Someone just dumped me a copy 
    of the k-2 report today - I haven't had time to read it yet. My off the 
    cuff  comment  is  that no one - I mean that - could  find  a  superbly 
    hidden underground base of unknown size with only a general idea of the 
    location.   What would be found - is a series of anolamous readings and 
    findings and it would cost a small fortune to determine the true source 
    of  these  readings.  And this includes a fullscale survey  by  leading 
    professionals using the very best equipment that exists. 
     
    So  it  would  be hard to prove or disprove  anything  of  this  nature 
    without  a  lot more cash that the total sum of ufo  enthusiasts  could 
    raise. I will get back here after I read k-2... 
     
    I  should would appreciate it if someone could tell me how to subscribe 
    to  this good stuff off of internet?  The copy I have originated out of 
    Pro-Net Australia Board...

    Gary,
    
      The  Phoenix  Project  claims to have access  to  all  the  expensive 
    equipment  necessary  to do the survey.  Since Phoenix is  a  secretive 
    organization,   one cannot be sure if they have or don't have access to 
    specialized equipment. 
    
      Someone  on  FidoNet:UFO is planning to get some of  his  prospecting 
    buddies together (one works just 10 miles from K-2)  and they will do a 
    magnetometer survey to check the Phoenix Project's findings. 
    
      Why  do  you  have to get your material from Australia?  I   got  the 
    material  from FidoNet:UFO and Compuserve.  Jack Mathias,  the  Phoenix 
    Project Spokesman, places the reports on both of these nets. From there 
    it eventually ends up in Australia. I'm not familiar with Internet, but 
    if  you  get  on a BBS that has it,  they probably  have  hefty  useage 
    charges.     There's    a   BBS   called   NetCom   and    they    have 
    UseNet's:alt.alien.visitor  . I haven't called them,  but the phone no. 
    is  408-241-9760  and type "Guest".  BUT you'll probably get  big  long 
    distance  bills and they probably charge for access to their BBS.   The 
    important posts that come from there are often reposted on Fido:UFO, so 
    you might look for a local BBS that has it.

    Re: Strong Word Of Caution!

    Over the last few days we have been posting information supplied by the 
    Phoenix  Project  of Carson City,  Nevada.  This information  has  been 
    strongly disclaimed by ParaNet pending the results of our investigation 
    to determine the validity of the Phoenix Project and its officers. 
     
    While  the investigation is still ongoing,  we have found  some  highly 
    disturbing   things  relating  to  credibility  of  the  group.    This 
    information will be reported as soon as the investigation is completed. 
    This should be in the next few days. 
     
    Until  this  investigation  is complete  and  the  findings  published, 
    ParaNet wishes to urge everyone not to send any money to the group.

    [Well,  It's been a week since that was posted and so far they have not 
    reported  on  their findings.  Shortly after this message  was  posted, 
    Michael  Corbin sent a message to Jack Mathias,  telling him to  reveal 
    the  names of the Phoenix Project members.  ParaNet may just be blowing 
    smoke. They are trying to set-up an atmosphere in which it is necessary 
    for them to reveal their identity.  They should have already posted the 
    disturbing  information  if they had any.  Otherwise all they  have  is 
    probably a bunch of rumors.]

    Paul et al 
     
    I've  spent some going over the K2  report here and have  some  general 
    observations to make. 
     
    An  uncanny absence of sounds in a wilderness area is hardly unusual  - 
    it  would  be  normal  for  the local fauna to shut  down  due  to  the 
    intrusion of humans into their turf. 
     
    The feeling of being watched is hardly unusual - it occurrs  frequently 
    with  city slicker types who feel paranoid without throbbing masses  of 
    humanity  surrounding  them.  Further in sensitive individuals  with  a 
    great deal of experience in this phenomena - it can be a very  reliable 
    guage. 
     
    The reaction of the local rangers was typical in all respects. 
     
    It's not unusual for any area to be non-radar observed - large areas of 
    the US are void of radar coverage. 
     
    The  initial tale of the discovery of the K2  site via triangulation of 
    transmitted  signals is a little flakey - someone just happens to  hear 
    an  unusual  transmission and keeps monitoring it - with SW  there  are 
    many such transmissions. 
     
    The closed mouthed loggers - this is common in an industry under attack 
    by greens, etc. Samething for the road improvements coinciding with new 
    logging in the area. 
     
    A magnetometer is old technology at best - the portable kind aren't  as 
    fine  tuned  and  data productive as the report  stated.   A   computer 
    generated  frequency  density map of the survey - which I didn't get  a 
    copy  of  - would be of interest.  My interest would be seeing  if  the 
    survey produced any unnatural geometry. 
     
    Since  a mag was used - the formation must be fairly shallow - if so  a 
    portable  core drill could be used to sample the formation.  If  I  was 
    directing  the  mag team - I would ask for a comparative survey  in  an 
    adjacent area to determine if either was anomalous to the area. A third 
    survey would be fairly conclusive. 
     
    Further  a professional look at the area would include a  fresh  aerial 
    survey  - with aerial stereo pix used to generate an AutoCad map of the 
    site.   The next step would be a real look underground with GPR  ground 
    penetrating radar and using an AutoLISP/AutoCad program to produce a 3-
    d map.  After looking at the results I could decide whether it would be 
    worth sinking a drill bit in for a log or coring, etc. 
     
    Interestingly enough - Phoenix's initial contact was Dr. Peter Sturrock 
    at SRI...GPR was developed by Dr.Lambert Dolphin at SRI.  If NASA truly 
    shows an interest in K2  - it would be a serious give away if they were 
    doing aerial photography and toting around some GPR equipment.  Further 
    it  might serve someones purpose to fabricate this data and activity at 
    K2 and wait and see who shows up. If the feds showed a serious interest 
    it  would  tend  to promote the alien connection whether  the  site  is 
    authentic  or not...The most curious part of the report was the pond  - 
    was this a beaver dam?

    [Subject ] Re: Phoenix project 
     
    Greetings Warren-  I am not surprised about Thunder, Inc.  Jack Mathias 
    just  left  me a post that the address for the company puts inside  the 
    base boundaries for Kirkland. So much for that contact,  but purhaps he 
    still might be contacted just for drill. 
    
      As I told Jack, even though I'm not from the state (Missouri I think) 
    I am very much of a "show me" person, and as such, I  am still not 100% 
    convinced about Dulce. He respects that, which to me is a good sign. 
    
      I  have receved the K2  report and it is most interesting.  There are 
    several pages of X,  Y coordinate data from the magnetometer,  pictures 
    of the site and specific locations of the cavern outlets,  a  blown  up 
    version  of the topo map of the location (Bluenose Mountain Quadrangle- 
    7.5 minute series), a map showing the radar zone coverage for that area 
    (including the dead spots).  These guys are definitely no into this for 
    the profit. If I were making this packet available,  the cost of $12.50 
    would  just  about cover my expenses.  The audio tape of  the  original 
    transmissions  that  keyed  these  guys to  that  location  are  indeed 
    strange.  They are heavily modulated and overlayed with what sound like 
    synthesizer signatures of a random sort.  I  strongly suspect that once 
    these are lifted,  the data tracks can be located.  I  can see why  the 
    guys at Stanford and at Ames didn't want anything to do with the tapes. 
    anyone  with sound engineering background should have a crack  at  this 
    tape. I am looking into that. 
    
      I  have a group that is going to be doing a long term observation  of 
    the  site  and  I  am looking  for  qualified  volunteers.   This  site 
    observation  will  be  from August 5 through the end of  the  month  if 
    possible. It may be shorter due to lack of manpower. This is strictly a 
    scientific observation expedition and as such there will be  absolutely 
    no  hostile intents.  From what the report has stated (they did have  a 
    CE4  incident)  the greys are just as curious about us as we are  about 
    them  and  respect  those  with non-hostile  intents.   Anyone  who  is 
    interested  should  be over 18  years of age and be prepared  for  some 
    possible  heavy duty mental activity (as in grilling by the locals  and 
    the government people up there-  and according to what I've heard there 
    may  be lots of them).  Those interested should leave e-mail for either 
    myseld or Dan Brown, my co-moderator (of the Sacramento UFO SIG). I  am 
    looking  into  the possiblity of some anthro graduate  students  coming 
    with us. Everyone will be briefed before leaving. 
    
      As I am sure that you are aware,  I suspect that this transmission is 
    monitored  and  I have no discomfort with the idea that  they  probably 
    know that we are coming (the government).  That is why I am making this 
    as public as possible. They hate publicity. Even before this post, over 
    50 friends of mine are fully aware of were I'm going and why. 
     Warren, I have communicated with you several times over the past two 
    years and respect you positions. Keep me posted.

    Thanx Paul - I know what you mean!(g)

    What have you heard about the Dulce location?  Both the Phoenix reports 
    were  real mind blowers.  With a large group of observers at the K2   - 
    there  should  be  some  very  interesting  stuff  coming  out   fairly 
    soon...keep up with great info... 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    P. MIDDLER [Paul]:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Gary, 

      I  haven't heard anything further about ParaNet's complaint about the 
    Dulce report.  The report is about 18 pages long,  compared to K-2's 60 
    pages,  so it doesn't have much detail in it.  The airborn magnetometer 
    map  looks like a shaded contour map.  They don't give any examples  of 
    data like they do in the K-2 report. 
     
    Now, going back to your message on K-2: 
     
      I  don't know why the report included useless information such as the 
    lack of rodents,  the feeling of being watched,  and "boiling"  clouds. 
    The content of the report suggested they were paranoid. 
     
    > unusual transmission and keeps monitoring it - with SW there are many 
    > such transmissions. 
     
      Yes,    but   these  particular  transmissions  are   strange.    The 
    transmissions  sound  like  bizarre music.  There is a  voice  on  them 
    repeating  words that I just can't make out.  It sounds like  "see  the 
    bears"?<g>   The transmissions carry no data.  It sounds like a bizarre 
    relaxation  or  subliminal  suggestion  tape  with  strange  electronic 
    sounds, including whale sounds. It has nothing to do with aliens. 
     
    > A magnetometer is old technology at best - the portable kind aren't as 
    > fine tuned and data productive as the report stated. 
     
      It  depends  what type of magnetometer they were using.  There is  no 
    mention  of  what type they used in the report.   Modern  magnetometers 
    shouldn't  have any problem detecting an alien base,  since  geologists 
    use  it  to  discover  mineral deposits.  I'm  not  familiar  with  the 
    magnetometer's  operation,   but modern ones use some sort  of  nuclear 
    resonance. 
     
    >My interest would be seeing if the survey produced any unnatural

      They  made  the conclusion that these tunnels and  compartments  were 
    unnatural  because  they were aligned with magnetic north.   They  were 
    apparently  rectangular.  These compartments were not connected in  the 
    field  data,   so  they  think there were adjoining  tunnels  that  are 
    magnetically disguised by the compartments near the surface. 
    
      There were two large entrances that had dead-ends.  One was 40   feet 
    wide at the entrance and narrowed down to 15 feet; the total length was 
    270 feet into the mountain. The section of the mountain (hill) that was 
    surveyed included magnetometer readings above the accessable tunnels. I 
    don't know why these entrances had dead-ends. Greys are suppose to have 
    the power to pass through walls,  so they could pass through the  dead-
    end,   but why is there an entrance tunnel at the surface?  Inside  the 
    mountain,   the magnetometer readings showed four chambers.  One was 20 
    feet  by 75  feet with 10  feet wide tunnels extending 50+  feet to the 
    north and to the south. This chamber was made of fused rock because the 
    magnetometer readings above it had dropped. There were two tunnels that 
    were  160+  and 190  feet long and 10  to 20  feet wide.  The  readings 
    increased above them,  so they apparently were metallic. On one side of 
    the surveyed quadrant was a large chamber that extended beyond the  400 
    foot quadrant and it was metallic.  The actual size of the chamber  was 
    not  determined.   The  chambers could be natural  deposits,   but  the 
    magnetic north-south orientation seems odd. 
     
    >Since a mag was used - the formation must be fairly shallow 
     
    They made no mention of depth,  but I assume they could use a  portable 
    core  drill.   But,   the  Phoenix Project seems to  be  worried  about 
    appearing hostile toward the aliens, so trying to drill into their home 
    would be a hostile act. 
     
    >Further  a  professional look at the area would include a fresh  aerial 
    >survey  with aerial stereo pix used to generate an AutoCad map  of  the 
    >site.   The next step would be a real look underground with GPR  ground

      Gee...you sound like you're familiar with underground surveys. If you 
    supply  the  equipment and the money,  I'll lend a  helping  hand  <G>. 
    Well..I  doubt  the  Phoenix Project would have enough money  to  do  a 
    complete survey. And I doubt anyone else would do that. 
     
    >Further  it  might  serve someones purpose to fabricate this  data  and

    I  don't know why someone would hoax it.  Just having the  military  or 
    USGS  there doesn't really strengthen "the alien connection".   If  the 
    USGS  wastes their time and finds out it's a mineral deposit or a hoax, 
    then the Phoenix Project is dead. 
     
    They apparently saw a Grey at the site and it `talked' to one of them. 
     
    The pond is dyked, so humans created the `dam'.

    Have they (Phoenix) done a report on the Dulce site?  At least with all 
    the activity at K2 something should come out of it. Maybe we can open a 
    snack bar there to finance our stay?(g) 
     
    On Cooper - the Psi BB had a message regarding a fight he got into with 
    another  UFO  researcher - forgot the guys name - Van something -  I've 
    seen  him  on  tv a few times.  At least Cooper's story  would  explain 
    things  like  the  Landrum incident.  With goverment testing  of  alien 
    technology. 
     
    I  read something interesting recently - there are always  tales  about 
    strange objects and artificial looking formations on the moon. There is 
    an  artificial  appearing object near the crater archimedes  and  lower 
    appenine  highlands - in the mountains South of the great crater  there 
    appears to be a huge structure located in some foothills. Lunar Orbiter 
    IV   produced  a  poor  photo  of  the  object  -  and  the  area   was 
    rephotographed  by  Apollo 15.  People have ordered 5"x48"   Apollo  15 
    mapping  photos  and  have  had them examined by  high  powered  stereo 
    microscopes  and  determined  that  the newer  NASA  photos  have  been 
    airbrushed - the object erased. When comparing the various sets of NASA 
    photos  with  some  done  at the Lick Observatory  -  it's  clear  NASA 
    reworked  things.   Some  people  think this is  done  mainly  to  fool 
    planetary scientist's here - who accept anything NASA gives them...

    Gary; Can you be VERY speccific on those lunar photos ? Do you have the 
    nasa numbers of them ? I can go over to the *space topic,  and  someone 
    there has access to these photos. then wo can maybe get some scientific 
    feedback. 
    
    Thanks Mike

    Gary, 
    
      A snack bar is a good idea.  I'm sure those aliens are pretty hungry. 
    If you want the Dulce Report,  there's DULCEDOC.ZIP in the library  or, 
    if  you  don't  have an unZipper,  there's DULCEDOC.TXT  in  the  Space 
    library.  The spaceship in the Landrum case is strange,  not like  your 
    average  E.T.  ship.  Maybe it was an experimental reactor that  caught 
    fire.  Somehow, I  think the lawyer might have been able to do a better 
    job  at presenting the case.  The judge expected high ranking  military 
    personnel  to leak classified information,  so the case died when  they 
    didn't.   The  reason why I don't like Cooper is because he  gives  out 
    information that is obviously incorrect.  Since he doesn't realize some 
    things  he says are blatantly wrong,  it makes me think he is either  a 
    lousy  researcher or he is making it up.  Disinformation is a no-no for 
    UFOlogists,   it has poisoned his reputation within the UFO  community. 
    Reguarding  the Moon pictures;  I  haven't heard about that,  I'll  ask 
    around and see if anyone else has heard about it.

    The  Paranet message basically linked the Phoenix Project with  America 
    West  Publishers and the Phoenix Liberator.  They are known  for  their 
    communications with a Commander Hattoon<sp>, who is in a spaceship that 
    circles  the Earth.  Jack Mathias has often put down that organization, 
    so  it's  funny  that he's linked with them.  The full story  is  still 
    unknown to ParaNet and they are continuing their investigation. I  will 
    upload  the  ParaNet message and a file on Commander Hattoon  into  the 
    library.
