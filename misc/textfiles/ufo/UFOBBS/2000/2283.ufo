SUBJECT: CLOSE ENCOUNTER, 1897 STYLE                         FILE: UFO2283


Late on the evening of April 13, 1897, as they were passing through Lake Elmo, 
Minnesota, on their way to Hudson, Wisconsin, Frederick Chamberlain and O.L. 
Jones spotted a shadowy figure in a clearing two blocks away. The figure 
carried a lantern and seemed to be looking for something. Thinking there might 
be some emergency, Chamberlain and Jones turned toward the clearing, but the 
figure and lantern disappeared into the trees. Moments later they heard the 
crackling of twigs and branches, followed by a "rushing noice...like the wind 
blowing around the eaves of a house," Chamberlain told the St. Paul Pioneer 
Press (April 15). "A second later and we distinguished a long, high object of 
a gray white color.

Although the two men could not get a clear view of it in the darkness, the 
object, which had two rows of red, green, and white lights on each side, 
looked like "most of the top of a 'prairie schooner,'" Chamberlian said. It 
rose at a sharp angle, then headed south just above the treetops.

At the clearing, the two witnesses found, impressed in the wet ground, 14 two-
foot-long prints, six inches wide, and arranged in an oblong pattern seven on 
a side. Apparently, these were traces left by the craft.

Around that same time Adam Thielen, a farmer in the Lake Elmo area, heard a 
buzzing sound above him. When he looked up, he saw a dark object with red and 
green lights sailing overhead.
