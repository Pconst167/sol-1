                                  ( Update #3 )
        
        January 18, 1991
        
        All Light Workers:
        
             Many of you are now experiencing increasing anxiety about 
        your prescribed reason for being here on Earth assignment.  Your 
        thoughts and feelings are now more than ever in a state of a 
        desperate need to link up to your task and deed and find where 
        you are supposed to be, then if at all possible finish last 
        minute details.  In doing so you will be disconnecting from 
        life's attachments which hold you fast and prevent you from 
        linking up to your group of twelve or whatever your job is.
             You now feel more than ever that time has become almost 
        nonexistent and any delay in your part ill sever the connection 
        you feel most drawn to as your part to this whole thing.  Your 
        greatest fear now is not that it all is an illusion as the world 
        crumbles around you, but rather a great fear of loosing what 
        before you thought was not quite real you now realize was and is.  
        To take the big step is now your present dilemma.  To leave all 
        and cast fate to the wind letting Spirit take the driver's seat 
        thus propelling you forward in complete trust all will be al-
        right; you know you will not parish by this your greatest of all 
        decisions you now face and now know you must make.
             We, at the headquarters command, realize your dilemma and 
        must say in all sincerity that we took the final separation or 
        plunge into the unknown and did survive it.  It is important to 
        know that if you are at present on the east coast that this is 
        your sector and is your duty station although you may or may not 
        be in your exact location in the sector.  We in our understanding 
        realize the great confusion many must feel and we do feel your 
        anxiety as we too once were faced with similar decisions and 
        confusion.  We made the move and eventually our decision to do so 
        benefited us and served us well.  Meaning, in do so we are better 
        off now than we could have achieved by holding back.
             If, for some reason, you have not realized your inner voice 
        connection but feel very strongly drawn to one who has they are 
        your mentor and guide in this up and coming move to your duty 
        station.  I'm referring to those now finalizing their last minute 
        business preparing for the final move.  If you feel an insepara-
        ble connection with this person and realize it is also time for 
        you to leave, then follow their lead.  Certain things must form 
        and certain groups must merge in the little time left before 
        Earth goes into final mutational changes.  Beyond this time left 
        little if any chance will remain in the year to follow of any 
        possibility for this to occur.  Time is running out fast.
             This is not said to frighten you but rather to reinforce 
        your inner knowledge that now, more than ever before, is the time 
        for action.  Those holding their ground must support as their 
        part the coming needs as one solidly based group for others being 
        told to do so.  In this we are referring to those sending needed 
        revenues to those forming the places they and others will at the 
        very last minute be instructed to go to.  If these places are not 
        set up and firmly in place, created by those in the position to 
        help finance them, along with those out in the field with experi-






        ence to create them then dear ones they will not be there when 
        the final hour approaches.  The need for these places and their 
        use will be self evident to all they will serve and their need 
        has been channeled to many.
             You have been told that certain times were coming and that 
        certain things needed to be understood and done in order for 
        other things to follow in a prescribed plan of action.  Because 
        of a rampant, scattered response and in some instances a stubborn 
        denial in following inner guidance plus a lack of real 
        commitment, certain things are now in a state of disarray creat-
        ing in many aspects a plan now with many cracks in it.
             We are now telling you that the hour is late and the need is 
        great to finally get on track and do as a committed combined 
        group the needed things or the result will most assuredly be a 
        mass loss of our ranks because of a lack of true direction in the 
        things coming and already here.  The tide has shifted and our 
        real position has shifted severally because of many creating 
        cracks in the mission of creating Heaven on Earth.  This resulted 
        in a stubborn fixation of following instead of developing inner 
        guidance thereby letting others create your reality instead of 
        creating the flowing communication to Spirit we were all supposed 
        to open.  If this were done updates would be unnecessary.
             It constantly comes to may ears that this person said that 
        or that person said this.  All this creates is many running 
        hither and fro accomplishing nothing but false followings for 
        those who feel they need to gather many around them.  Have you 
        all forgotten the story of the blind leading the blind??
             This is your only recourse - it is better to follow those by 
        the fruits that their labor bare as your reason rather than the 
        words of this one or that one.  The Reality of this is that the 
        fruits are spawned by those doing, not by those telling you this 
        or that and getting rich by those than blindly follow this one or 
        that one.  Do you understand??  Those doing are the ones who 
        should be drawing your attention not those casting pretty words 
        upon the waters and little else.  If you see a plan actually 
        evolving not just words chances are these people are really doing 
        something for the good of Earth and all life forms here.  These 
        words are not hollow but filled with wisdom and hardship by the 
        actual hands on doing with (for the most part) little support.  
        Many get fat living off pretty words that many of you support 
        fully but in reality they are not doing anything but living off 
        your ignorance and your gullibility.  At the same time the hour 
        nears and real things of real worth are not being done or sup-
        ported because those actually doing are scrapping an empty pot as 
        the means are not there for the important work and things which 
        need to be done.  All life down here effects you dear ones as you 
        are a part of all life.
             One of these people came here one day.  She said, "Boy, you 
        are scrapping the bottom of the barrel aren't you?"  This same 
        person drags gullible people to her to the tune of three or four 
        or more hundred dollars a day.  She is fat from these gullible 
        fools who receive a kind word or some false guidance, when in 
        reality their real guidance lies within.  But for some reason or 
        another it is much easier to get a lie or false reading versus 
        hearing the voice of God within by just listening.  Pretty words 
        won't get you over the bridge no matter what these people tell 






        you.  For years nothing has been shown to me that this person has 
        done with all this wealth accumulated.  We still wait to see even 
        a gesture of support from these people.
             In my particular situation I have never gone to one of these 
        and my part in the mission is deeply entrenched in fertile soil 
        as Jesus spoke about in the final days versus faith that sits on 
        a rock easily dislodged.  So there you have it.  Your guidance 
        whether true or false will stand on its worth as baring good 
        fruit or not.  Rest assured your job here on Earth in the final 
        hour will be known for the fruit it will bare helping others in 
        the times of need directly ahead.
             Now read these words carefully!!  None of you will be res-
        cued or survive the times ahead as single entities standing alone 
        in an approaching storm.  The times ahead are going to be rough.  
        Some of you have been told to stay put as you are in a position 
        to help as you are already set up to do so.  Some of your are 
        being told to move, link up and become a part of those doing as a 
        group in order to prepare for a variety of things that need doing 
        at this time.  These things range from embassies to life off 
        sights and the formation of Islands of Light bringing many new 
        things for those in need to experience and learn in order to 
        survive the times ahead.  Now is the time for a change of lack of 
        support to actual hands on doing in all endeavors.  Make no 
        mistake the time is here and each and every one of you had better 
        heed the call "now is the time" as this call will be the very 
        last, there being little time left.  All other calls will ring in 
        your ears as another matter completely different because of 
        changes directly ahead.  A lot now needs doing and very little 
        time remains.
             Our purpose, our reason for being here is our part and our 
        love of all life in bringing many into the reality of living into 
        the times ahead and actually seeing Heaven on Earth.  Few if any 
        will have than chance if we continue in scattered mixed ideas of 
        our reasons for being light workers at this time and continue 
        following those in the past that did nothing but tell us pretty 
        words and did nothing beyond those words in creating Heaven on 
        Earth.  Look to those now doing.
             It is my sincere hope our reason and our goals in creating 
        Heaven on Earth will bare the fruit of the eternal one we love 
        and that love will be experienced by all those we came to help 
        here on Earth.  Blessings to all.  Let the final hour bare the 
        fruit of eternal love.
                                 Peace and Love,
                                  Cmdr. Kortron
