    "UFOLOGISTS" CONVERGE ON WEST GERMANY 

    FRANKFURT,  WEST GERMANY (OCT.  27)  UPI -  Small creatures from  outer 
    space with long arms, gray skin, pear-shaped heads and a varying number 
    of eyes are the topic of a four-day international conference on UFOs. 

    Forty-five  ''UFOlogists''   from  20   countries  are  discussing  and 
    evaluating  their findings before an audience of 1,800  people who paid 
    $250 to attend the conference that ends Sunday. 

    Entitled  ''Dialogue with the Universe,''  the event was  organized  by 
    Munich publisher Michael Hesemann,  who proudly announced,  ''There has 
    never been a UFO conference of this size in the whole world.'' 

    But  two West German UFO organizations accused the conference organizer 
    of  ''making  a  lot of money selling putative scientific  findings  to 
    gullible people.'' 

    Nonetheless, Hesemann said his UFO conference aims at ''overcoming just 
    a  little  bit  the enormous lack of  information''   Germans  have  on 
    extraterrestrials and ''finding ways to contact extraterrestrials.''
