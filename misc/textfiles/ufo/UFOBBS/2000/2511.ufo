    The  way  I  remember  it  is that the file I  downloaded  to  you  was 
    information  on  1989FC  and  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  question 
    referenced by Joseph. However the way I recall our meeting the question 
    in  point was answered.  The reason that it took a couple of years  for 
    the  report  to be transmitted was because the  Phoenix  Project  *had* 
    never  intended on submitting it.  The only reason it was released  was 
    because I, myself, pestered the team in my belief that this information 
    should  be released --  that we should allow those interested in  UFOs, 
    etc,   to  perhaps gain more knowledge and insight.  Which,  as it  now 
    appears, turned out being bad judgement on my part.

    ES> Program  that  I have access to through GENIE and  found  out  that

    Your initial response to the file I gave you was --  as stated --  from 
    information taken from GENIE and concerned 1989FC. I believe it was the 
    idea  that 1989FC never existed and that the probe currently on station 
    mapping Venus was never diverted to track its course. It had nothing to 
    do with any of the published reports. If the asteroid doesn't or didn't 
    exist  then  the newspapers printed falsehood at the time.  Making  the 
    article  in last weeks [I believe] Newsweek also a falsehood  since  it 
    referred to this. 
     
    ES> Once  misinformation  becomes public, someone somewhere will always 
    ES> chose to believe it. 
     
    Believe  it or not I go along with that thought.  It is also true  that 
    once individuals or groups decide that a piece is filled with lies  and 
    loop-holes  that have not been explained to *their*   satisfaction  and 
    state such,  this information is also retained by those reading it thus 
    doing nothing but deepening the mystery,  etc.,  and casting suspicious 
    eyes at the group submitting the information.

    I  have now received the files that Joseph has been nice enough to  put 
    into  this  echo for me and I must say that I found  them  interesting. 
    However  it  is still my contention --  and that of the team  --   that 
    nothing has been disproved. I will say --  and I have mentioned this to 
    Steve and Joseph on several occasions --  I  am a bit disappointed that 
    the *Team* chose not to respond to the files and they were made public. 
     
    I, myself, am considering responding, in sorts, to Joesph in regards to 
    his  messages and also to the file released by Michael Corbin in  which 
    he  addressed Don Kircher's 10/23/92  report because I still feel  that 
    something  should be said.  I  do not believe for one instant that  the 
    book  is closed.  After all,  unless one experiences something it  will 
    always remain hard for others who haven't, to believe. 
     
    Sincerely, Jack Mathias
