    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I  was  idly leafing through an old book yclept "Flying  Saucers---Here 
    and Now!"  by Frank Edwards (Bantam Books,  copyright 1967)  and I came 
    across   a  rather  tongue-in-cheek  section  on  the  late   scamster, 
    "Professor"  George Adamski that I thought most of you would get a bang 
    out of: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
    "...Persons  who  tell  such stories are known in the UFO  business  as 
    'contactees.' 
     
      The first and foremost among them was a fellow named George  Adamski. 
    He was a man of meager scholastic attainments,  but he made up for that 
    shortcoming by having an excellent imagination, a pleasing personality, 
    and an apparently endless supply of gall. 
     
      George  established  the ground rules for the contactees  which  they 
    have dutifully followed.  He was the first---  and he showed that there 
    was  considerable  loot  to be made by peddling tales of  talking  with 
    space  people.  George instinctively realized that everything had to be 
    pretty nebulous; he knew that details would be disastrous. 
     
      Prior  to  becoming associated with a hamburger stand on the road  to 
    Mt.  Palomar,  George had worked in a hamburger stand as a grill  cook. 
    With his scientific background he wrote,  in his spare time, a document 
    which he called 'An Imaginary Trip to the Moon,  Venus,  and Mars.'  He 
    voluntarily  listed  it  with  the Library of  Congress  for  copyright 
    purposes as A WORK OF FICTION. 
     
    That was in 1949.
      
      His  effort  did  not attract many customers but it did  attract  the 
    attention of a lady writer who saw gold in them there space ships.  She 
    made  a deal with George to rewrite his epic;  she was to  furnish  the 
    skilled  writings  and he was to furnish the photographs of  the  space 
    ships. 
      
      This lady brought the finished manuscript to me for appraisal and she 
    brought  with it a clutch of the crudest UFO photographs I had seen  in 
    years. I  declined to have anything to do with the mess and she left my 
    office in a bit of a huff. 
     
      In  its  revised form it told a yarn of how George had ventured  into 
    the  desert of southern California,  where he met a "scout ship"   from 
    which stepped a gorgeous doll in golden coveralls.  She spoke to him in 
    a  bell-like voice in a language which he did not understand,  so  they 
    had  to resort to telepathy,  or something similar,  to carry on  their 
    conversation. And then, as she prepared to leave him,  she tapped out a 
    message  in  the sand with her little boot.  George realized  that  she 
    wanted  him to preserve this message (it was terribly important)   and, 
    having a pocket full of wet plaster of Paris (which he seemingly always 
    carried with him on desert trips),  George quickly made a plaster  cast 
    of the footprint with the message,  which he eventually reproduced  for 
    the educational advancement of his readers, who were legion. 
     
      Of the numerous photographs which embellished the book let it be said 
    that some of them could not have been taken as claimed. The others were 
    crudely 'simulated,' as the Air Force put it charitably. 
     
      But  for me the payoff was the alleged photograph of Adamski's 'scout 
    ship'   in which he allegedly took a trip to Venus and  returned.   The 
    picture  as shown in his book was taken either on a day when three suns 
    were  shining---or  else  it  was  a  small  object  taken  with  three 
    floodlights  for  illumination.  After eight years of patient search  I 
    finally  came to the conclusion that his space ship was in reality  the 
    top of a canister-type vacuum cleaner, made in 1937. I  doubt that many 
    persons are traveling through space in vacuum cleaner tops. 
     
      Adamski communicated with me frequently. When he was questioned about 
    the title of 'professor'  which he used,  he explained that it was just 
    an  honorary  title given to him by his 'students',  and that he  never 
    used  it himself.  George was evidently forgetful,  for the letters  he 
    sent me were always signed 'Professor George Adamski.'" 
     
                              *** End of Quote *** 
     
      Well,  there you have it---I hope it gives you as big a chuckle as it 
    did me when I read it.
