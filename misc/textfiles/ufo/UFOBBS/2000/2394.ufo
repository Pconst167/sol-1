    The Prolog:

      Clark:  I  had no conscious memory of this incident until mid-June of
    1993. Janice's Parents were here from Phoenix, Arizona for the occasion
    of  Lee's  graduation  from High School.  Janice and  her  mother  were
    swapping   stories in the living room in my presence, about snoring. In
    attempting  to  illustrate how badly I snore,  Janice turned to me  and
    said   "don't  you remember at the cabin with Rick and Judy a few years
    ago  everyone   voting that you had to sleep in the van because of your
    snoring?".  I   stood  there dumfounded in shock for a few seconds that
    seemed more like minutes. Images too numerous to fix upon were flashing
    through  my  mind  as  the  shock was being overcome by an inexplicable
    sense of fear pervading my being.                                      
                                                                           
      As  the fear progressed,  I  mumbled something,  perhaps oh sure  and
    turning away,  walked out onto the patio.  I  smoked and sat and smoked
    and paced.  I was in a peculiar state of confusion. I was attempting to
    understand  the irrational fear that I was experiencing while,  at  the
    same  time   trying   to make some sense of the imagery happening in my
    head.   I    caught  glimpses  of bright light with strange shadow-like
    figures within.                                                        
                                                                           
      I  heard a mid-pitched drone.  Through the open back windows  of  the
    van,  I  saw a big bright star.  Being ordinary enough images,  I   was
    having     trouble tying them to my fear. For three days I carried this
    within me.  With each passing day, while the fear abated, my aggitation
    grew.                                                                  
                                                                           
      Finally on the night of the third day,  Janice and I sat on the patio
    for our late hour talk as is our custom. My emotional being had reached
    the state were I could no-longer hold it within.  Thus,  I   cautiously
    approached  the subject.  "Do you remember the other night telling your
    mother about my snoring" I said. "Up at their folk's cabin at Pulga?" I
    asked. When she indicated yes, I proceeded to share with her my fear as
    well as the imagery that I had experienced.                            
                                                                           
      My  regression  sessions  (2)  followed some three  months  later  in
    September.   What  came  out of those sessions as  well  as  additional
    ensuing memories will follow the Prelude to set the stage, which is the
    next message.                                                          
                                                                           
      I  hope  that my methods of description in the forgoing will  not  be
    construed  as having been overly dramatic.  My purpose was to share the
    emotional range that I underwent and to a degree,  am still undergoing.
    In  the past two years,  at this location (North Highlands),  the  same
    sort  of  light has been onbserved along with the multi-colored  cotton
    balls    as    well as the droning sound, from my bedroom window in the
    middle   of    the   night. The light awoke me from a sound sleep and I
    remember  vividly,   my  first thought upon that awakening. Oh No...not
    again...was   the   thought.   This occured prior to the partial memory
    awakening in June that precipitated the Hypno-regression sessions.     
                                                                           
      From the age of 5 I have been trained to observe detail.  As a nearly
    life-long martial artist with my primary training in an internal,  soft
    style,   I   can and do sometimes on an involuntary  basis,   sometimes
    consciously, extend my awareness. Thus, things do not easily take me by
    surprise.   I  do not react to fear in the same manner that most people
    do. Rather than become immobilized, I  tend to flow with it and channel
    it into responsive action.                                             
                                                                           
      In  light  of  the above,  it would be hoped that one  can  begin  to
    appreciate  the  inner  anguish that I have felt as a  result  of  this
    experience. I have this inner need to know. I am patient, it will come.
                                                                           
     -Clark                                                                
                                                                           
                                                                           
    The Prelude:                                                           
                                                                           
      On a weekend prior to mid-month in August 1990,  a  small group of us
    spent the weekend at a cabin in Pulga, California.  Perched on the west
    side  of  a  deep canyon that contains the North Fork  of  the  Feather
    River,   Pulga  is  a tiny, 1800s era mining and rail-stop village. The
    cabin belonging to the parents of one of the group's members, sits in a
    meadow  along  with  three other cabins. The meadow is situated just to
    the north and above the little town.  It is oriented west to east where
    it terminates in  a stand of fir, cedar or pine. Beyond that point, the
    slope drops off  into the canyon below. The canyon walls rise up on the
    west and  north  sides  of the meadow which is reached via a serpentine
    gravel road that  winds  it's  way up from the village below. This road
    forks just to the west of the meadow, one branch sloping down providing
    access  to  the meadow and the other continuing on up the side  of  the
    canyon wall to the north.  Located behind the cabins, the south side of
    the meadow is bounded by an a creek that eminates from a spring further
    up the canyon walls to the west. Aligned along the southern edge of the
    meadow,  ours was the  second cabin from the west. The first cabin that
    weekend was occupied by  a nice,  elderly couple. The cabin just to the
    east of us,  was condemned and boarded up.  The last cabin to the east,
    on that first night, was unoccupied.                                   
                                                                           
      The group was comprised of Rick and Judy Lichty,  business colleagues
    and  friends  along with their sons Brandon then three and  Brian  then
    six.   The others were Janice as well as Lee then sixteen  and  myself.
    Everyone  was anticipating a weekend of fun, frolic and relaxation with
    Rick and  Lee in particular, looking forward to that night's session of
    gaming.   Throughout the plans and preperations for the trip...they had
    besieged  me  with  requests  to Dungeon Master a  weekend  session  of
    "Dungeons and  Dragons".  I agreed after Judy had said "I don't care if
    you guys  play  all  night long as long as you don't keep everyone else
    awake".                                                                
                                                                           
      Having arrived and gotten settled in,  I proceeded to pull a recon of
    the  creek  and  the meadow.  Being an artist,   I   was  particularaly
    attracted  to a large oak tree on the northeastern side of  the  meadow
    opposite  the   mid point between cabins three and four. The meadow was
    quite a  bit wider at that point then that of our end. I continued down
    to the  east  end and observed the train tracks and river below through
    the trees.   The  rest of the evening until around 9 p.m., was spent by
    eating and visiting with the couple next door. They retired early so we
    all went  in  and  as Judy had started drinking soon after our arrival,
    she went to bed.  The boys were playing quietly on the floor and Janice
    settled  onto  the  couch  and  began reading Stephen King's novel IT!.
    After  set-up,   I   proceeded   to  lead  Rick and Lee (actually their
    characters)  through a tortuous,  terrifying adventure in another  land
    far, far away. The time slipped away rapidly.                          
                                                                           
                                                                           
      This  ends  the Prelude and hopefuly sets the stage for  the  ensuing
    events.                                                                
                                                                           
                                                                           
    The Story:                                                             
                                                                           
      I looked up and turned my head at Judy's intrusion into the room that
    was accompanied by, "haven't you guys played long enough?".  Continuing
    she slurred with a screech in her voice, "All of you,  go to bed Now!".
    I noticed Janice glance up from the book that she  was reading and read
    the disgust in her eyes as Rick meekly mumbled "yeah,  O.K., sure".  We
    quickly  wrapped things up and put the gaming gear away.  Rick had  put
    the kids down for the night much earlier and somewhat subdued, went off
    to   bed    at   the back of the cabin. Lee lay down for the night on a
    trundle   bed   in   the front room while Janice remained on the couch.
    Tired,  I  bid my good nights and opening the screen door, stepped down
    and into the  night.   The time was shortly after midnight. The air was
    warm and still as I shut the door and turned toward the van.           
                                                                           
      As  I  made  my  way to the van I noticed  the  mountainside  terrain
    silhoutted against a starry sky.  With a deep sigh,  I  thought God!  I
    love  the  mountains  and  I  really  like  this  place.   Too  bad   I
    thought...that Judy  has to be that way, she really needs some help but
    so  far hasn't the willingness.  Soon after it had been suggested  that
    due to  my  snoring  I sleep out in the van, I had prepared it for just
    that  purpose.  I  was thankful as I pulled the sliding side door  shut
    behind  me,   that   I  hadn't waited until after dark. Clicking on the
    flashlight, I pulled off my shoes, socks and jeans and crawled into the
    sleeping bag.  I lit a cigarette, pulled the ashtray closer and resting
    on  one   elbow,    gazed  out the rear windows of the van to the east.
    Pondering  the  panorama   of  stars before me, I finished my smoke and
    gratefuly lay back to sleep musing 'it's a good thing this bed is built
    in the back, it sure beats sleeping on the van floor'.                 
                                                                           
      I  was  awakened  by a loud high-pitched drone  that  quickly  faded.
    Raising  up onto one elbow,  I  looked out the space formed between the
    tilted    open windows and the sill of the van doors below. Directly to
    the east I noticed a very bright blue-white light somewhat smaller than
    a  dime  held at arms length away, off in the distance. 'That sure is a
    big  star'   I thought, quickly followed by 'maybe Venus. I wonder what
    time it is?'.                                                          
                                                                           
                                                                           
      Before I could glance at my watch,  I was startled to notice that the
    light  was  moving  and coming closer expanding in size.   I   wondered
    fleetingly  'what  is a helicopter doing up here?'.  As I  watched  and
    listened  for  the 'chop'  of the rotors,  It seemed to pause  when  it
    reached  size  of a silver dollar.  The light seemed to expand  into  a
    rounded      oval and began to grow rapidly. 'Oh NO!' I thought, 'it is
    coming  down   into  the clearing'. I heard no rotor chop and must have
    closed  my  eyes.   In what seemed like just a moment, my inner eyelids
    were illuminated from without.                                         
                                                                           
      I struggled to open my eyes. As my eyes came open,  they were looking
    down at the sleeping bag that lay open around me. The inside of the van
    was  lit up brighter than daylight.  I  looked up while trying to  move
    backwards toward the door.  Immediately before my face were fluorescent
    cotton    balls of neon red, green, yellow and blue popping on and off.
    Beyond  these down the meadow lay an arc-like light to the right that I
    couldn't  look directly into.  It appeared to disipate off to the  left
    into  a glowing haze. Within this misty light, there were three shadowy
    figures   that   began to materialize. As they took on sharpness, I saw
    that one  stood  at least a head above the others. This figure detached
    itself from  the  others  and to my sudden sense of horror, proceded to
    loom larger in my vision.                                              
                                                                           
      The silhouette of what I beheld approaching me had a large domed head
    with  the  lower portion of the face sharply tapered in.  This in  turn
    flowed  into  a long thin neck and narrow  sharply  sloping  shoulders.
    Askew  and   not seeming to be moving, long very thin arms with bulging
    pod-like      endings were angled down and away from the shoulders. The
    upper  torso  tapered down into a waspish waist that gently flared into
    narrow  hips.   this  in turn tapered downward at a severe angle. At an
    unbelievable rate,   it  loomed so large that it's head was obscured by
    the out-tilting  tinted  rear windows. At it's approach, I had cast out
    my awareness trying  to  get a 'feel'  for this being in order to sense
    it's intent.  This alas,  was to no avail. Suddenly, it's face appeared
    at the window  opening,   tilted  to the side and looking upward at me.
    With fear coursing through me,   I  saw it grasp the window sill in the
    door. Curling over the edge were three fingers,  a  shade of mauve, the
    middle one half again  as  long  as  the others.  Of extreme texture, I
    somehow  'knew'   that  were  I  to  caress  these  leathery  appearing
    appendages,   they  would have a silky feel.   My  other-awareness  was
    pervaded by a sense of cautious, mischievious humor.                   
                                                                           
      The  being abruptly twisted to it's left while raising up and  moving
    forward  in one fluid motion.  In shocked amazement I realized that  it
    had done all of this through the glass,  the bed,  as well as the steel
    body  of the van itself as if they were of water.  It gently but firmly
    griped my upper arms,  it's face mere inches from my own. Huge,  glossy
    black eyes that filled close to a third of it's face, stared into mine.
    It's  face  was the same shade of mauve as the hand with a lighter area
    around the eyes. I was desperately trying to wrench my way free but was
    totally   unable    to move. Over-come with terror I sensed that it was
    beginning to take me out the way it had come in.                       
                                                                           
      As  It moved backward pulling me forward I flashed upon being slammed
    into  the inner back of the van.  We emerged outside before the thought
    had  ended.  My eyes rolled downward to see the ground rushing backward
    beneath my dangling feet.  Looking up again,  I  could see that we were
    entering  the  outer haze and the other two figures were becoming  more
    distinct.                                                              
     Approaching  them,  my captor turned it's head to the left in order to
    gaze at them.  At this the shorter,  more robust creatures  immediately
    backed away. I  cataloged this as well as noticing there were now three
    and   that when the taller being shifted a portion of it's attention, I
    could  feel some return of control. I chose not to excersise it however
    as it took me by surprise and I felt that in the long run it would have
    been futile.                                                           
                                                                           
      I  closed my eyes against the now too bright light and when I  opened
    them,   found  that  we were in a hallway that curved to the  left.   I
    discovered that I was on my feet.  Gripping my upper left arm the Being
    led  me   a  short  way down the hall to an open doorway to my right. I
    could 'feel'  the presense of the others behind us. I wanted to turn my
    head to look at them but found that I could not.                       
                                                                           
      Ushered into the room,  I was urged toward an object that rose out of
    the center floor. It had the appearance of being a table as the top was
    waist  high.   With  a mirror finish,  the recessed top  looked  to  be
    fashioned  from  a light blue tinted metal. Curling over the edges were
    the  sides that tapered down in rolling,  flowing contour to a  pinched
    waist  above  a short, contoured pedestal. The surface of the thing had
    much the  same  look as the being that I by now had likened to a Mantis
    or an Ant. That is, the skin of the Mantis except it appeared much more
    coarse.  It also  had what seemed to be tubes running within it's sides
    partialy protruding,   at various locations, running a foot or two then
    disappearing within the sides.  As we approached this table, I began to
    get the distinct feeling that it was alive!                            
                                                                           
      We arrived at the side of the table,  I reluctantly.  I  was suddenly
    filled  with an impression of meaning that directed me to climb up  and
    lay back. At this, I reacted with a slight jerk and a resounding mental
    NO!      But,      you must came the impression. No I don't, I thought.
    Swiveling,    the   Mantis turned and again gripped both upper arms and
    seemingly   without    effort   on it's part, lifted me unto the table.
    Looking into my eyes,  I  was compelled by gentle pressure to lay back.
    Rather  than  being  cold  and  hard  as  it appeared, the top gave way
    providing support to the  contours  of my body as I partially sunk into
    it.  A  soothing warmth surrounded me as I felt tension flow out of  my
    body.                                                                  
                                                                           
      My  consciousness  began  to  drift until  suddenly  jerked  back  to
    awareness  by  the  'feel'  of other presenses entering  the  room.   I
    struggled to arise, but was too lethargic to do so. I 'felt' a presense
    tentatively  approach and 'knew' that it was passing something over but
    above,  my body. Involuntarily,  my eyelids shut and once again I began
    to drift.                                                              
                                                                           
      My awareness returned and my eyes confirmed as they came open that  I
    was once again alone in the room with the Mantis being.  As I turned my
    head, I was receiving the impression that this was a female. Along with
    this, was the realization that she 'felt' familiar. The impression came
    that  I was bid to arise and accompany her elsewhere. Reluctantly I sat
    up,         swiveled around and eased myself down onto my feet. Feeling
    slightly  dizzy   and disoriented, I supported myself against the table
    with my left hand. I could sense a low pulsing vibration from within. I
    jerked  my  hand  away  and haltingly stepped toward the opening in the
    wall.   The   Mantis   had  preceded me into the hallway beyond and had
    slightly turned,  waiting  for  me to follow. Where are you taking me I
    thought,  as I stepped through the opening to join her. Come,  came the
    impression...then came  an  image  of a wall of what I understood to be
    electronic  apparatus  with winking intermittant lights and a  pulsing,
    strobe-like glow. I  paused,  unwilling momentarily to proceed further.
    Why?...I  must have mentally shouted,  because I could feel her recoil.
    She  gripped my upper left arm and proceeding down the hall,  came  the
    impression.....of interest. Traveling down the hallway perhaps 15 feet,
    I  could  see another opening to the right.  reaching the  opening  and
    turning to  the  right,   I   beheld  a room that seemed wider than the
    previous one.  I  was aware of  a maze of round edged shapes of various
    sizes protruding from the  walls  and  floor  of the room. My attention
    however was riveted upon  the  countenence  of  an obvious human female
    that  stood upon a low,  sculptured platform against the wall  directly
    across from me.  Ridgid,  with heels together,  arms loosely hanging by
    her sides, she stared straight ahead.                                  
                                                                           
    The Prolog:                                                            
                                                                           
      Janice:  For three long years I have kept all these incidents bottled
    up inside of myself and would like to continue to as it really agitates
    my  insides.   When Clark started bringing this up this summer  I  just
    wanted  to forget it all as I do now.  It makes me angry.  At first  it
    made me angry because it seemed that it was only him that was taken and
    I wanted to be with him. Now I am angry because I am not so sure.      
                                                                           
                                                                           
    The Prelude:                                                           
                                                                           
      Janice:  The night all this happened I was very lonely and felt  very
    abandoned by Clark,  Lee and Rick one more time as they wanted to  hide
    in their D & D.  So I got myself a book to hide in. As for Judy, I  was
    very  angry  and  upset  with  her  drinking  and  wanting  to  control
    everybody.     Before the trip, she had said to me that we would have a
    nice quit  and restful weekend and that she and I would visit. So I was
    feeling abandonded by her and feeling angry about being lied to.       
                                                                           
                                                                           
    The Story:                                                             
                                                                           
      Janice: The neighbor's dog came over to play with Rick's dog and they
    were  playing  and barking all evening.  Once in a while Clark or  Rick
    would chase them out or go outside to tell them to shut up.            
                                                                           
      The  last  time Judy came out and told everyone to go to bed  we  all
    did.  I  had no conception of the time all weekend as we were all there
    to   have   our own fun at whatever and I don't remember even wearing a
    watch.                                                                 
                                                                           
     I don't remember when I stopped reading. I was in the living room with
    my son and Judy's dog was on the floor.  I  don't remember ever closing
    my  eyes.   It was very still and quiet and all of a sudden  the  whole
    house  was  lit up with all different colors and there were  all  these
    little    white fuzz balls dancing around the room. They sort of looked
    like  pollen.   I automatically thought of Clark being alone, trying to
    communicate with him mentally, telling him to get out of the van and to
    come in by me.  I  remember both of the dogs being sound asleep on  the
    floor by the door which was opening and closing by itself repeatedly at
    the same  time  that  I saw the fuzz balls. I remember a low dull sound
    like a  faraway  train or helicopter thinking they're coming for me and
    Clark and please let us go together, don't just take Clark, he needs me
    to go too.  I  was trying to get off the couch this whole time but kept
    thinking how  come  I  can't get up? I kept watching my son sleeping on
    the trundle bed  hoping it was really him being there. All the thoughts
    going on  in  my  head I thought were keeping me awake and expecting to
    see Clark at any minute. I have no idea of any time.                   
                                                                           
      I  was  really attracted to her eyes.  They didn't seem to be  seeing
    anything at all. They did not move nor, did her eyelids blink.  She had
    wavy  light-brown  hair with a slight reddish tone,  cascading down  to
    frame  her  face and to disappear behind her shoulders.  With  my  eyes
    continuing on down her form, the Mantis guided me into the room. I  was
    struck with the feeling that I knew this woman although with a start, I
    realized    that    I could not see her face. That was a blur. The only
    portion of  her  face that was clear to me were her eyes. I could see a
    shallow,  slow rise and fall to her naked breasts. My concentration was
    interrupted by  an impression of caressing her to the point of arousal.
    NO! I thought.  But, you must...came the meaning. No...I thought again,
    why  must  I?   The  impression  that  came took me aback, You made the
    commitment it declared.  I  want to go home I thought. I don't remember
    any commitment I thought.  I  won't do it.  Why? came the meaning...You
    made the commitment therefore you  must.  I  won't,  I want to.... With
    this, the Mantis turned me toward the opening and moving through it, we
    stepped into the hall.  We turned to our left and continued down to the
    opening into the original room.                                        
                                                                           
      Guiding me into the room,  she turned and left.  I  turned to see her
    disappear up the hall to the right.  Turning again, I  quickly observed
    the room in which I once again found myself. It had the appearance of a
    gently  curved rectangle with the (doorway)  opening centrally located.
    Although  flat,   the walls where they met with each other,  did  in  a
    smooth    curve rather than at an angle. They met the floor in the same
    manner as  did  the ceiling. The ceiling was gently arched as a partial
    dome. Protruding from the wall at the back were 6 rectangles of various
    dimensions  and  at various heights.  There were three of these on  the
    left wall with a rectangle perhaps 4 or 5 feet long protruding up  from
    the  floor  and out from the wall at the back portion of the left wall.
    The top of this rectangle was wide enough to allow sitting. The wall on
    the right contained one of these positioned center and framed on either
    side by  a rectangle protruding from the wall perhaps 3 to 4 feet above
    the floor. The highest point of the wall at the back was perhaps 7 feet
    above   the floor. There were no angles to be found anywhere. The whole
    room  had the appearance of having been popped out of a mold. Moving to
    the opening, I proceeded to step through it and found that I could not.
    Puzzled,  I  tried several times just to get my hand and arm through. I
    stepped to  my left and peered up the hallway to the right as far as it
    would allow,  but saw nothing. I stepped right and repeated the process
    to the left  with the same result. Stepping again to the left, I turned
    in time to see the Mantis returning with the woman. I  began to back up
    as  they  turned  to enter. The Mantis stopped just inside the opening.
    You   must!...came  the meaning with a 'feeling' of impatience. No!...I
    don't do  that,   I   thought. The woman moved forward. My back came up
    against the table  and  I could once again feel it's pulse. Why?...came
    the  impression...You   commited  it continued. I have a lady I think I
    replied outloud.  The Mantis moved forward quickly and gripped again my
    upper right  arm  as  the  woman reached me looking up and reaching out
    with her finger  tips  to lightly place them on my naked chest. My eyes
    shifting  downward,   her  mouth  became  clear  in  a big smile. I was
    desperately trying to twist away but could not move. Her fingers traced
    a trail down my skin,   across  my  stomach to hook into the tops of my
    undershorts......                                                      
                                                                           
                        ********************************                   
                                                                           
      At  this  point in the regression,  my eyes popped open.   The  first
    session ended with the Mantis coming through the van.  Each session was
    terminated  by extreme agitation,  some hyperventilating and fear.   In
    each   case,   my eyes popped open to end the proceedings. Because of a
    history      of      high blood pressure coupled with my present health
    circumstances,  the decision to curtail the sessions until such time as
    they may safely (for me)  proceed,  was made.  For me,  that time can't
    come soon enough.
