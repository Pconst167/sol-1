                      PATTERN RECOGNITION & ZETA RETICULI 

    By Carl Sagan & Steven Soter 

      "The  Zeta Reticuli Incident"  is very provocative.  It claims that a 
    map,   allegedly shown on board a landed extraterrestrial spacecraft to 
    Betty  Hill  in 1961,  later drawn by her from memory and published  in 
    1966,  corresponds well to similar maps of the closest stars resembling 
    the sun based on stellar positions in the 1969 Gliese Catalog of Nearby 
    Stars.   The  comparison maps were made by Marjorie Fish using a  three 
    dimensional  physical  model  and  later  by  a  group  of  Ohio  State 
    University  students  using  a presumably more  accurate  (i.e.,   less 
    subjective)   computer generated projection.  The argument rests on how 
    well  the  maps  agree  and on  the  statistical  significance  of  the 
    comparison. 
    
      Figure  1  [not available here] show the Hill map and the Ohio  State 
    computer  map with connecting lines as given in the  ASTRONOMY article. 
    The  inclusion of these lines (said to represent  trade  or  navigation 
    routes)  to establish a resemblance between the maps is  what  a lawyer 
    would  call "leading the witness".  We  could just  as well have  drawn 
    lines as in the bottom of Figure 1 to lead the other way. A less biased 
    comparison of the two data sets,  without connecting lines as in Figure 
    2,   shows  little similarity.  Any residual resemblance is enhanced by 
    there being the same number of points in each map, and can be accounted 
    for by the manner in which these points were selected. 

      The  computer star map includes the sun and 14  stars selected from a 
    list  of  the 46  nearest stars similar to the sun,  derived  from  the 
    Gliese  catalog.   It  is not clear what criteria were used  to  select 
    precisely these 14 stars from the list, other than the desire to find a 
    resemblance  to the Hill map.  However,  we can always pick and  choose 
    from  a large random data set some subset that resembles a preconceived 
    pattern.   If  we are free also to select the vantage point  (from  all 
    possible  directions for viewing the projection of a three  dimensional 
    pattern), it is a simple matter to optimize the desired resemblance. Of 
    course such a resemblance in the case of selection from a random set is 
    a  contrivance --  an example of the statistical fallacy known as  "the 
    enumeration of favorable circumstances". 
    
      The presence of such a fallacy in this case appears even more  likely 
    when we examine the original Hill drawing, published in The Interrupted 
    Journey by John Fuller.  In addition to the prominent points that Betty 
    Hill connected by lines,  her map also includes a number of  apparently 
    random dots scattered about --  evidently to represent the presence  of 
    background  stars but not meant to suggest actual positions.   However, 
    three  of these dots appear in the version of the Hill map used in  the 
    comparison,  while the others are absent.  Thus some selection was made 
    even  from  the original Hill map,  although not to the same extent  as 
    from the Gliese catalog.  This allow even greater freedom to contrive a 
    resemblance. 
    
      Finally,   we lear from The Interrupted Journey that Betty Hill first 
    thought she saw a remarkable similarity between her UFO star map and  a 
    map  of  the constellation Pegasus published in the New York  Times  in 
    1965   to show the position of the quasar CTA-102.  How many star maps, 
    derived  from the Gliese catalog or elsewhere,  have been compared with 
    Betty  Hill's  before a supposed agreement was found?  If  we  suppress 
    information  on such comparisons we also overestimate the  significance 
    of the result. 
    
      The argument on "The Zeta Reticuli Incident"  demonstrates only  that 
    if  we set out to find a pattern correlation between two nearly  random 
    data  sets by selecting at will certain elements from each and ignoring 
    others, we will always be successful. The argument cannot serve even to 
    suggest a verification of the Hill story --  which in any case is  well 
    known  to  be riddled with internal and external  contradictions,   and 
    which   is   amenable   to  interpretations   which   do   not   invoke 
    extraterrestrial   intelligence.   Those  of  us  concerned  with   the 
    possibility  of extraterrestrial intelligence must take care to  demand 
    adequately rigorous standards of evidence.  It is all too easy,  as the 
    old  Chinese  proverb says,  for the imprisoned maiden to  mistake  the 
    beating of her own heart for the hoof beats of her rescuer's horse.

    Studies.
