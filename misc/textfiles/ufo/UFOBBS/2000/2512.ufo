    Not bad judgement Jack, more like the report was ill-equipped to handle 
    the kind of scrutiny we've put it through.

    What  else  are  we  supposed to do Jack?  In a  field  such  as  this, 
    misinformation runs rampant.  When we as independant investigators find 
    flaws and loop-holes that do not get explained to our satisfaction, are 
    we  supposed to blindly accept whatever is told us?  Do you want us  to 
    just accept the words of a here-to-for unknown group as gospel? Come on 
    Jack,  independant verification is the life-blood of all research.   If 
    one's  findings can-NOT be independantly verified,  then said  findings 
    MUST  be viewed as inaccurate.  So far,  not ONE claim made in the  K-2 
    Report has been verified,  other than static data.  (ie the name of the 
    mountain is Pilot Peak etc etc..) 
     
    JM> I  have now received the files that Joseph has been nice enough  to     
    JM> put  into  this  echo  for me and I must  say  that  I  found  them     
    JM> interesting.  However it is still my contention --  and that of the     
    JM> team --  that nothing has been disproved. I will say --  and I have     
    JM> mentioned this to Steve and Joseph on several occasions --  I  am a     
    JM> bit disappointed that the *Team*  chose not to respond to the files     
    JM> and they were made public.                                         
    
    Nothing  has  been disproved,  that I'll grant you only on the  grounds 
    that  I've not received confirming data on Pilot Peak.  One of the  key 
    claims made in the K-2  Report involved the Magnetometer readings,  and 
    those are what I,  and the SUFOG are working on now. However,  too many 
    of  the  statements  made  in the K-2  Report have  been  shown  to  be 
    seriously flawed. This you cannot dispute. 
     
    JM> I,   myself,  am considering responding,  in sorts,  to  Joesph  in     
    JM> regards  to  his messages and also to the file released by  Michael     
    JM> Corbin in which he addressed Don Kircher's 10/23/92  report because     
    JM> I  still feel that something should be said.  I  do not believe for     
    JM> one  instant  that  the book is closed.   After  all,   unless  one     
    JM> experiences  something  it will always remain hard for  others  who     
    JM> haven't, to believe.                                               
     
    If  the  Phoenix  Project refuses to back-up,  or at least  attempt  to 
    explain  some of the problems noted in the K-2  Report,  then  we  must 
    assume  that  these  problems are such that they cannot  BE  explained, 
    other  than  by  admitting that the report is bogus.   "Silence  is  an 
    admission  of guilt."  That statement is upheld in most courts of  law, 
    and  I believe it has relevance here.  I  look forward to hearing  from 
    you. Remember the key items we're interested in... 
     
    1. The  F-4's  scrambling from a base that has never  operated  fighter 
       aircraft of any type. How could this be "verified" ? 
     
    2. The  memo  referancing a document that would not be received  for  2 
       more days. 
     
    3. The  lawyer  attempting  to incorporate the  Phoenix  Project  who's 
       office is the same as the mailing address of the Phoenix Liberator. 
     
    These amongst many... 
     
    Joe.
