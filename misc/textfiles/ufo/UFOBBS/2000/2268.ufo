SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - A swarm of UFOs invaded a city on August 13 and terrorized 
its 30,000 residents for 20 incredible days!

Witnesses say the bright, strangely shaped space objects flew through the city 
of Tres Coroas in the dead of night and in broad daylight, sending residents 
scurrying up hillsides to watch the display of extraterrestrial lights.

During the 20-day period, one of the strangest ever recorded in the annals of 
UFO watchers:

      * People were chased by balls of light.
      * A man watched in horror as a hideous creature approached with its arms 
        extended, whining like a dog.
      * Fire erupted from the ground and weird flashes of light exploded in 
        the tree tops.
      * Bottles suddenly broke and chairs began flying through homes.
      * Scores of UFOs were sighted, ranging in form from upside-down saucers 
        to glowing balls of light to tuning fork-shaped objects.

And whle the experience terrified almost everone in the Brazilian city, many 
residents felt they were dealing with an intellignet life source.

Josefino de carvalho, an attorney, was one of the many people living in Tres 
Coroas who told this reporter of his harrowing ordeals.

He was driving late at night when he saw a fire-like object at the side of the 
car following him.

I was afraid it wanted to captureme, he said.

He rushed home where his son Vicente also saw the UFO.

It was like fire in the sky turning around. It had small lights which changed 
colors - orange to green to blue, said Vicente. It was onion shaped.

Real estate broker Roberto Francisco Santana was so unnerved by the flying 
saucers hovering over his car that he had an accident.

My wife and children were in the car. I saw the shadow of a saucer and got 
scared, he said. It was very fast.

We saw two flying saucers. They disappeared very rapidly. But while I was 
looking up I hit the car in front of me.

Antonio das Gacas Santos, the city's military police commander, rushed over to 
a neighbor's house when he saw its backyard strangely illuminated.

I get goose bumps just talking about it, said Santos. I saw very clearly a 
creature about the height of a human being with its arms extended.

It was night so I couldn't see any details. It made a low whining noise like a 
puppy - then vanished.

Dr. Gloria Machado, a psychiatrist in Rio de Janeiro, was stunned by what she 
saw.

There was a fire which didn't burn anything, said Dr. Machado. Therre were 
flashes of light that exploded in the tree tops. And indoors I saw a box of 
matches floating in midair. There were bottles breaking and chairs flying 
around.

I'm sure we were dealing with intellignet beings.
