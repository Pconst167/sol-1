I scanned this excerpt from an article in "Nexus New Times". While the
article is ostensibly about "earth changes" resulting from [predicted]
earthquake activity, it also mentions ET visitations by 1995.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an excerpt from the article entitled "Earth Changes & Predictions" ,
that appeared in the Oct-Nov 1992 issue of 'Nexus New Times' magazine.
The magazine is published in Australia by Duncan Roads and available
in the USA by:



This excerpt is about Gordon-Michael Scallion and some of his earthquake
predictions on coming earth changes.

Enter Gordon-Michael Scallion.

Gordon-Michael Scallion may well be hailed as another Edgar Cayce if his
track record continues the way it's going at the moment. In fact, the
parallels he has to Edgar Cayce are quite uncanny.  For example, in 1979,
Gordon-Michael Scallion lost his voice also, and after a rather unusual
series of events, spent the best part of ten years giving personal readings
for people's heath problems.   Just like Edgar Cayce, Gordon-Michael
Scallion does not consciously remember what is said during his readings, and
as a result tapes all his sessions for going over at a later time.

The predictions pertaining to earth changes are also very similar to  Edgar
Cayce, except that Gordon's predictions are a lot more precise.

So precise in fact, that after the hurricane that hit Florida recently, a
lot of people are now taking him very seriously.

He has accurately predicted nearly every major earthquake, volcano, major
flood for the last few years that I can trace, and has a pretty good track
record on the general economy and socio-political predictions also.

So concerned is he about what he has seen in the future, that he has started
up a non-profit organisation known as The Matrix Institute in Westmoreland,
New Hampshire, USA.  The Matrix Institute has been publishing Gordon's
predictions over the last year in their newsletter, called The Earth Changes
Report. (See details at the end of this article.)

One can obtain these newsletters and verify his accuracy, and one can also
purchase some tape sessions of predictions regarding earth changes in both
America and the rest of the world.

I have encapsulated several hours worth of taped sessions in the following
paragraphs. You will again note the amazing similarity with many other
predictions. I guess time will tell ...

Gordon-Michael Scallion refers to the period from 1991 to 1997 as the "First
Tribulation". According to him this is to be a period of profound change,
both physically, emotionally, economically, socially, and most importantly,
- spiritually. I will do a quick run through each of the continents to give
you an idea of what he is predicting in general terms.

North America:  More earthquake activity especially in California. Judging
from the more recent newsletters, there is currently a prediction 'on the
table' as follows: a 65% chance of two earthquakes before the end of
September '92 one a 7.8 (plus or minus 0.4) on the Richter Scale, epicentre
Sonoma County California, latitude 39" (plus or minus 0.5) approximately 50
miles from the coast; the other near Los Angeles, epicentre within a 100
mile radius of Palm Springs, reaching 8.3 (plus or minus 0.5) on the Richter
Scale.  He also has predicted an earthquake size 7.1 (plus or minus 0.3)
within a 75 mile radius of San Diego before mid-October '92.  He indicates
that should these earthquakes not occur during these "windows" mentioned,
then there is a 95% probability they will occur before May 9th 1993.

Otherwise, North America can expect massive earth changes by or during 1995,
with quakes reaching size 15 on the Richter Scale. In fact he indicates that
earthquakes of this size will be causing major damage world wide, with shock
waves causing many mountain ranges to collapse due to oscillatory resonance
huge tidal waves, flooding etc. etc.  He predicts that California will
become a series of islands, and virtually a complete change of the shape of
the continent of America.

South/Central America:  Massive earthquake and volcanic activity, resulting
over time with a new inland sea where the Amazon basin is currently
situated.  He indicates that this new inland sea will occupy a size equal to
approximately 10% of the current land mass of that continent.  Many of the
mountain ranges in this continent are forecast to be levelled.

Severe earthquakes in Mexico City. He indicates that an earthquake here of
magnitude size 8.0 or more, will be occurring just before the big ones of
size 15 in California.

Africa: Imagine the letter "Y" and place it over a map of Africa with the
bottom of the 'Y" near Capetown, and this will give you a picture of the
shape of the Africa to emerge. Long waterways dividing the continent into
three land masses. He indicates that the lands of Africa will split due to
movement of the earth's tectonic plate.

Europe:  This is one place I would not want to be if Gordon is right  His
predictions indicate that the "quickest" of the earth changes will occur in
Europe. To be brief, most of Britain, Scotland and Ireland will end up
underwater, as will Spain, Portugal and parts of France, Bulgaria, Morrocco,
Algeria. He predicts that a large portion of northern Europe will sink
beneath the waves over a period of twenty minutes.

Asia: Major inland seas to appear in large parts of Asia. By the end of
1997, Asia is predicted to lose approximately 50% of its land mass. That is
it will be underwater. Japan is predicted to go under water due to a plate
shift over a period of 24 hours!

S.E. Asia:  Major volcanoes, earthquakes, and tidal waves leaves much of
south east Asia uninhabitable or underwater.

Australia/New Zealand:  Guess what?  We miss out on the huge earthquakes and
volcanoes, but we catch a lot of inundation, ie floods and tidal waves due
to the action elsewhere. This is not to say there will not be some plate
activity though. Australia and New Zealand are predicted to emerge as
"vibrant" civilisations of the future.

Antarctica:  Volcanic activity is predicted on this continent, leading to
large scale melting of ice. This will affect the water table levels for many
areas in the region. After some time, this continent becomes fertile once
again, and large masses of people move there.

Middle East:  Gordon predicts that if the Palestinian issue is not settled
by 1993, then we can expect global confict there during or about 1995-1997.
This conflict is predicted to render large portions of this area
uninhabitable for some 50,000 years.

Other:  Gordon predicts that many new land masses will emerge, many with
remnants of ancient and technologically advanced civilisations on them.
These are predicted to open up a new era of technology for mankind.

New land masses are predicted to rise near Australia and New Zealand; also
in the Sargasso Sea; the Atlantic; parts of the Pacific and elsewhere.

A series of seven plagues are forecast during the period of tribulation, we
are currently into three of them at present (AIDS and the new form of
Tuberculosis being two of these three).

By the end of 1995 we will have been openly visited by visitors from the
stars, who have been increasing their contact with humanity gradually over
the past decade or more.

Basically, he summarises his own predictions by indicating that before the
end of 1995, many lands will have split up and gone, new sub-continents will
have been formed, and over 100 major cities will have experienced severe
earthquakes and/or inundation.

Just how accurate is his track record you are wondering before you rush out
to sell your shares in insurance companies.

Well let me put it like this. How many people do you know who predicted Mt
Pinatubo erupting in the Phillipines, Hurricane Andrew hitting Florida, or
the last two sizeable Californian earthquakes (to the hour in one case)?

But he has had a couple of 'misses' as he refers to predictions that did not
materialise. I might point out though that so far, the 'misses' have been
very few, and minor in consequence, that is in terms of earth-changing
potential.

One tiny tidbit that fascinated me about Gordon-Michael Scallion's
predictions though, was his mention of the fact that people would 'feel' the
earth-changes coming before hand.  He indicated that many people would feel
a 'pressure-like sensation in the chest area, and many would feel heart
palpitations, especially before large earthquakes. These, he predicts, will
be felt by many people days and weeks before-hand.

Not many people are aware of the intense magnetic field changes that occur
prior to most earthquakes.  Many species of animals appear to go 'crazy or
'jittery' just before earthquakes, particularly big ones strike in their
local area.  This has been attributed to their sensitivity to the magnetic
feld changes, which undergo a steep rise in intensity before a large
earthquake.

The subject of heart palpitations prior and during earthquakes by Gordon is
also the topic covered by an esteemed New Zealand scientist, whose brief
article appears in the Science News section of this issue. This is a very
new subject, as the relationship between heart palpitations and earthquakes
has not been previously identified or examined fully.

As editor of a national magazine, I get a lot of mail etc. I have been
recently getting many unsolicited letters from readers who have been having
unusually vivid dreams - especially of tidal waves hitting the east cost of
Australia, or Sydney being destroyed by a huge wave, in the near future.

This is not new to many Australians.  When the infamous channel, Ramtha was
in Australia, he predicted a wave 'taller than the tallest building in
Sydney' hitting Sydney and leaving a new beachfront half-way up the Blue
Mountains.  Edmund Harold, well known English psychic, also with an
interesting track record of predictions has long maintained that a huge
tidal wave will hit Sydney with very little, if any, warning. Even
Aboriginal and Maori 'psychics' have forecast this particular event.

For what it is worth, most of these prophets stress regularly that the
future changes they perceive can be offset or alleviated in terms of
severity of damage.  They maintain that by living in peace, respecting the
interconnectedness of all life, and becoming more aware of our
spirituality, that many of these events will be reduced in magnitude.

What does one do with this information? I am not psychic, but I am starting
to wonder, is this just the regular end of-the-century doomsday fever at
work, or is there some truth to all these predictions? Does our planet go
through regular and sudden massive earth changes, and if so, would this be
'picked up' by some of us beforehand on some psychic level?

If you, as a supposedly normal human being in western society suddenly
started getting visions of the future such as Gordon- Michael Scallion, what
would *you* do with the information?
