MORE GRIST FOR THE MILL -- WHO ARE THE UFONAUTS? 
The Watchers and the Giants... 
 
The Book of Enoch... 
 
"Go speak to the Watchers of Heaven, who have sent you to 
intercede for them.  Tell them, You should intercede for 
men, and not men for you.  Why did you leave lofty holy 
Heaven to sleep with women, to defile yourselves with the 
daughters of men and take them as your wives, and like the 
children of the earth to beget sons, in your case giants?  
Though you were holy and spiritual, living the eternal 
life, you defiled yourself with the blood of women, you 
begot children with the blood of flesh, and like the others 
you have lusted after flesh and blood as do those who die 
and perish.  Because they perish I gave them wives so they 
might impregnante them, have children, and nothing be 
lacking on the earth.  But you were spiritual and immortal 
for all generations of the world.  so I gave you no wives, 
for Heaven is your proper dwelling place.  And now the 
giants, offspring of spirit and flesh, will be called 
spirits on the earth, and earth shall be their dwelling.  
Their bodies emitted evil spirits because they were born 
from human women and the holy Watchers.  The giants 
afflict, oppress, destroy, attack over the earth.  Although 
they hunger and thirst, they do not eat.  They offend.  
These spirits will rise up against men and women because 
they proceed from them.  "The giants will slaughter, 
unpunished, until the day of the great judgment.  Then the 
age, the Watchers, and the godless will be wholly 
consummated.  As for the Watcher who sent you to intercede 
for them, tell them: 'You were in Heaven but the mysteries 
were not revealed to you.  You knew worthless ones, and in 
the hardness of your hearts you revealed these to ewomen, 
and through these secrets women and men work much evil 
earth.'  Say to them, 'You have no peace.'" 
 
ENOCH'S JOURNEYS THROUGH SHEOL AND HEAVEN -- 
 
"And the archangel Uriel said to me, 'Here shall stand the 
angels who have been attached to women.  Their spirits, 
assuming many different forms, are defiling mankind and 
will lead them astray into sacrificing to demons as gods.  
Here they shall stand till the day of the winds of Heaven 
which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all 
the stars to their setting..." 
 
ENOCH'S ASCENT TO THE FIFTH HEAVEN -- 
 
"And the men carried me up on to the fifth heaven, and I 
saw there many troops, Grigori, and their appearance was 
human and their size greater than that of great giants and 
their faces withered, and the silence of their mouths 
perpetual, and there was no service on the fifth heaven, 
and I said to the men who were with me, 'Why are their 
faces melancholy and withered, their mouths silent, and why 
is there no service on this heaven?'  And they said to me, 
'These are the Grigori, who with their prince Satanail, 
rejected the Lord of light, and after them are those who 
are held in great darkness on the second heaven and three 
of them went down to earth from the Lord's throne to the 
place Ermon, and broke through their vows on the shoulder 
of the hill Ermon and saw how good are the daughters of 
men.  They took them as their wives, and befouled the earth 
with their deeds, and in all times of their age were 
lawless and promiscuous.  Giants (Nephilim) were born and 
marvelous big men and great enmity.  And therefore God 
judged them with great punishment, and they weep for their 
brethren and they will be punished on the Lord's great 
day.'"  NOTE: Grigori. Giant angels, also called Watchers, 
who revolted in Heaven and sinned with the daughters of 
men.  In Genesis 6:2, "the sons of God (fallen angels), 
looking at the daughters of men, saw that they were 
pleasing and married as many as they chose."  The 
intercourse of God's angels with humans enraged God.  In 
Genesis 6:3, we read God's words: "My spirit must not be 
disgraced in man, for he is but flesh."  As punishment "his 
life shall last for no more than a hundred and twenty 
years."  For all this wickedness and corruption, in the 
next lines, God introduces Noah and the Flood.  Ermon is 
considered to be Mount Hermon in upper Galilee today. 
 
WHO ARE THE NEPHILIM (FALLEN ANGEL-HUMAN HYBRIDS)? 
 
Before the Indian Hindu (Mohenjo Daro) "Aryans," legend has 
it that the first great Aryans were the Neflheim (Nephilim 
in the book of Genesis in the Bible, i.e., the Giants of 
old, i.e., fallen angel-human hybrids) who existed in the 
"north" in the centre of their land of which was a well 
from which sprang twelve rivers.  The god of this northland 
was Odin who was considered the greatest of sorcerers, and 
imparted his knowledge of his art to his favourites.  
Frigga was his queen, and the mother of Baldur, the 
Scandinavian Apollo.  Thus, in legend we see the Nephilim 
of the north spreading out of the north, across Europe, and 
eventually coming to India.   Indian and Tibetian esoteric 
Hinduism/Buddhism plays a central role in the Theosophy of 
Helena P. Blavatsky.  
 
HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY 
  
She was born Helena Hahn, the duaghter of a Russian 
colonel, in 1831, and whe was the cousin of Sergei Witte, 
latter prime minister and friend of Rasputin.  Married at 
sixteen to a man twenty-four years her senior, she deserted 
him after a while -- the marriage still unconsummated -- 
and began her wanderings around the world.  Count Witte 
said she became a bareback rider in a circus, taught the 
piano in Paris and London, became assistant to the medium 
Daniel Dunglas Home for a while, managed an artificial 
flower factory in Tiflis, and periodically turned up at her 
home in Ekaterinoslav looking plumper and stranger than 
ever.  She also traveled by her own account in Mexico, 
Texas, India, Canada and Tibet.  She acquired some 
reputation as a medium in Russia and, in 1873, went to 
America and found the country in the grip of a spiritualist 
craze.  Two brothers name Eddy were the prominent 
materialisation mediums, and it was at their farm near 
Chittenden, Vermont, that Madame Blavatsky met a bearded 
lawyer who possessed the honorary rank of colonel -- Henry 
Steel Olcott. 
  
Throughout her life, acquaintances spoke of strange knocks 
and rappings that occurred in her presence.  Occassionally 
notes dropped out of the air detailing her needs, and she 
explained that they (the notes) were from certain secret 
Mahatmas she had met in Tibet, spiritual adepts who would 
one day regenerate the world.  There was also a Brotherhood 
of Luxor -- in these early days, HPB tended to emphasize 
Egypt rather than Tibet -- whose members sent messages to 
the readers of "The Banner of Light," the spiritualistic 
newspaper that publicised her doings in exchange for a 
certain amount of financial support.  It was on September 
7, 1875, that Madame Blavatsky embarked on the career that 
was to make her world-famous.  A certain Mr. Felt had 
lectured to a small study group about the hermetic secrets 
embodied in the measurements of the pyramids.  He explained 
that those secret 'laws of proportion' could also invoke 
spirits, although, he added, the spirits he had seen showed 
no sign of intelligence.  It was from this study and the 
suggestions from Mr. Felt that soon the Theosophic Society 
was born. 
  
In September, 1877, after endlessly writing day after day, 
the book "Isis Unveiled" was published by HPB.  This book 
contained blendings from the Kabbalah, Cornelius Agrippa, 
Pythagoras, Buddhist, Hindu and Taoist scripture.  Primary 
among the tenets of Theosophy of HPB is her doctrine of 
"root races."  According to HPB the first root race lived 
near the North Pole [Note: compare this location to the one 
above where North is mentioned] and they were invisible, 
being made of firemist; the second, living in norther Asia, 
were just visible -- they invented sexual intercourse; the 
third root race were the ape-like giants of Lemuria, who 
communicated telepathically and could not reason in our 
sense; the fourth were the Atlanteans, who were destroyed 
through black magic; we are the fifth (and according to 
occultist Lewis Spence, we are also heading the way of 
Atlantis); the sixth root race will evolve from the present 
human race and will live on Lemuria (in the Pacific) again; 
after the seventh root race, life will leave our earth and 
start up on Mercury. 
  
The manuscript of "The Secret Doctrine," another 
foundational text of the theosophists, was a huge pile of 
jumbled papers.  Various friends of HPB read it and said it 
was incomprehensible.  She told them to get to work on it; 
so the book was typed, then rearranged.  The book came out 
in 1888.  Annie Bessant, who had been a Fabian Socialist 
and George Bernard Shaw's mistress, reviewed it, and wanted 
to meet the author.  In 1889, Bessant met Blavatsky and 
immediately became a disciple of Theosophy much to the 
dismay of the Fabian Socialists.  Upon HPB's death on May 
8, 1891, Annie Bessant became the leader of the Theosophic 
Society.  Still, after her move to Theosophy, Bessant's 
contacts with the Fabian Society continued eventhough she 
had moved to India, converted to Hinduism, and become the 
world leader of the Theosophical movement.  In July, 1907, 
Bessant gave a lecture to a Fabian audience on "The Future 
of Socialism."  Before her death in 1933, Annie Bessant 
continued the writings of the Theosophic Society including 
"The Ancient Wisdom."  Another called "Esoteric Buddhism" 
is reported to have been written by Sinnet.  These later 
writings are full of references to the Upanishads and 
Buddhist scriptures.  It is of interest that an important 
symbol of these Eastern religions is the hackencruze; i.e., 
the swastika. 
  
THE LINK TO NAZISM?? 
  
In 1923, Hitler was campaigning for power in the period of 
the Weimar Republic of Germany.  German had just lost World 
War I and the settlements as Versai were most repressive as 
far as Germans were concerned.  In these campaigns, many of 
which were conducted by quick airplane hops to different 
Germany cities, Hitler had accompanying him one Detrick 
Eckart.  Detrick Eckart was an official in the 
Thulegessellschaft, i.e., the Theosophic Society of 
Germany.  It was later that Hitler would dedicate his book 
MEIN KAMPF to Detrick Eckart and, it is known, that Eckart 
was a trusted advisor of Hitler in these early days. 
  
Even before, in 1919, the peculiar figure of Dietrick 
Eckart was involved in the start of the nucleus of the Nazi 
Party when it was called "Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" which 
claimed to carry on the ideas of "the Free Workers' 
Committee for a Good Peace."  Eckart was a heavy-jowled, 
fat little man of just over fifty-one and he often 
frequented the Munich beer-halls to inveigle against the 
Jews and "the traitors of Berlin."  He came into contact 
with several other discontented "idealists" at the time 
including Alfred Rosenberg, who was obsessed with the 
importance of racial purity.  It was Hitler himself who was 
later to join up with the "German Citizens' Union."  It was 
Detrick Eckart who persuaded the Union to make Hitler their 
propagandist on October 16th, 1919.  Hitler, due to his 
oratory skills, gave the party a program and brought the 
party out into the open. By February 24th, 1920, the German 
Workers' Party had adopted its "Twenty-five Points" and, 
significantly, established the "Black Guards," i.e., a 
private army.  By August 7th, 1920, the fuller title of 
"Nationalsozalistische Deutsche Arbeiterparei" was adopted. 
 Shortly later the anti-Semitic sheet, the "Volkischer 
Beobachter," the Party's newspaper was distributed by one 
Hermann Esser.  Detrick Eckart was of the opinion that he 
could inspire a lesser mind but a greater leader to the 
regeneration of Germany.  He was, however, assisted by one 
Alfred Rosenberg. 
  
Race is at the bottom of the National Socialist (Nazi) 
philosophy.  "A man in born Nordic or Jew or of some other 
race, and he can no more change his racial characteristics 
than he can alter his skin from black to white."  According 
such thinking led to the following: "No society can exist 
except on the basis of racial purity...No Jew or coloured 
man can ever be assimilated into a Nordic society; social 
adaptability follows the facts of racial biology, and 
inescapable natural facts rule out any possibility of 
transformation."  These and other statements are the work 
of Alfred Rosenberg; the racial purist of the fledgling 
Nazi party.  Biologically,, Hitlerism divided mankind into 
one superior race -- the Aryans -- and the other degraded 
slave-races.  Among the inferior types two stood out in 
Nazi thinking -- the Jewish-Slavs and the 
Jewish-Negro-French.  It is little known in the present day 
that the so-called "Aryans" were not just the blond 
haired-blue eyed Nordics -- to the contrary, the true 
Aryans are an ancient "race" from India.  Now we begin to 
see the connection of Theosophy, the Nazis, and ancient 
esoteric scriptures. 
  
ANCIENT HISTORY 
  
The worship of the oak tree or of the oak god appears to 
have been shared ;by all the branches of the Aryan stock in 
Europe (who had migrated from India).  Both Greeks and 
Italians associated the tree with their heighest god, Zeus 
or Jupiter, the divinity of the sky, the rain, and the 
thunder.  In the religion of the ancient Germans the 
veneration for sacred groves seems to have held the 
foremost place, and according to Grimm the chief of their 
holy trees was the oak.  It appears to have been especially 
dedicated to the god of thunder, Donar or Thunar, the 
equivalent of the Norse Thor.  Interestingly, for a sacred 
oak near Geismar, in Hesse, which Boniface cut down in the 
eigth century, wen among the Aryans by the name of 
Jupiter's oak, which in old German would be "Donares eih."  
Translated in present German is "Donarstag" -- in English 
"Thursday" for "Thor's day."  The perpetual holy fires of 
the Aryans in Europe appear to have been commonly kindled 
with oak-wood, and in Rome itself the fuel of the Vestal 
fire consisted of oaken sticks or logs. 
  
The Aryan worship of the oak tree was visible among the 
British Celts of the ancient Gaulic empire.  Among the 
British Celts the chief fire-festivals of the year were 
those of Beltane (May Day) and Hallowe'en (the last day of 
October).  Clearly the Druids of old, associated with 
Stonehenge, are one of the branches of the Aryan race.  In 
tracing back the origin of the Aryans to India we see them 
direct descendents of the Hindu worldview.  Interestingly, 
the jack-o-lantern of today -- the pumpkin head -- is a 
symbolic form of the Hindu magician "Punchkin" who had his 
head twisted off in a Hindu legend.  An interesting study 
is the examination of the worshippers of trees in the Bible 
and the attitude of God toward those groups. 
   
TODAY AND TOMORROW 
  
The Theosophic Society came to the United States.  
Beginning with Alice Bailey, the Theosophic ideals began 
their substantial American printing under the name of 
Lucifer Press in New York.  The Lucifer Press, an offshoot 
of Lucifer Trust, was located in United Nations Plaza in 
New York.  Renamed Lucis Press/Lucis Trust, the 
organization continues to this day in active policy 
lobbying in the United Nations itself. 
 
The present New Age movement, with its distinct 
Druid/Hindu/Buddhism/Magick/Satanic  worldview, is nothing 
but a re-emergence of the spiritualism of the ancient past, 
traceable back to the Nephilim, in our own day.  This 
current great re-emergence of the same philosophy which has 
led to Nazism in this century and is associated with the 
Nephilim/Aryans of ancient legend, portends troubles in our 
own time.  Reappearance again in our present age signals 
the probable not-distant arrival of the end of the age.  
Christians should be both aware and alert to the activities 
of these aforementioned groups and organizations in the 
present day as there are direct Satanic influences at work. 
 Objectives of these Aquarian groups point, without doubt, 
to the establishment of a global government which shall 
result in the appearance of a global totalitarian dictator, 
a type of which was Adolf Hitler.  It will be no surprise 
if the coming global system, which is obviously tolerant of 
all other religions except Christianity and Judaism, will, 
once again, begin the persecution of its old adversary.  
The struggle between the two forces, one representing God 
(Judeo-Christianity) and the other Satan (the Mystery 
Religions of the Nephilim), has, since Genesis been waged.  
This great struggle between those of God (the Light) and 
those of Satan's legions (the Dark) shall come to an end 
with the victorious return of Jesus Christ at the end of 
this present age. 
  
New Agers: Know who you are -- you are people of the 
swastika and are the servants of Satan. Christians: Know 
who you are -- you are people of the cross and the servants 
of the Most High God. 
 
It is Satan's desire that all people of the earth shall 
come to worship him and the mark of the beast shall be an 
initiation into the Luciferian kingdom.  The reign of the 
antichrist shall be but 7 years -- 3.5 shall be in peace; 
3.5 shall be in great war and turmoil.  At then end of this 
7 year period Jesus Christ himself will return to defeat 
the antichrist and his legions in quick order.  If you are 
a dabbler in the New Age then know what is happening to you 
and how you are being manipulated by Satan.  Come to Jesus 
Christ by prayer and ask Him to save you from this certain 
destruction; God is not willing that any should perish but 
that all come to salvation through Jesus Christ.  THIS 
MEANS YOU.  Christians: Build yourself up in your most Holy 
Faith and look up for your salvation draweth nigh.  Watch 
and pray.  Come Lord Jesus! 
 
IF you desire to seek salvation and wish to be with the 
Perfect Lord Jesus who gave His life that you might have 
life after physical death a simple prayer like the one 
below is sufficient to show God you are serious... 
 
"Dear Lord Jesus, 
  I confess that I am a sinner and that I rightfully 
deserve eternal death for my transgressions against your 
Holy word.  Lord Jesus, I ask that you forgive me of my 
sins and that you, as you have promised, save me from 
eternal death.  I ask that you come into my heart(spirit) 
and that I be henceforth a pleasing vessel of your will.  
Thank you for dieing for my sins and thank you for saving 
my soul.  Teach me of your ways.  In the name of Jesus 
Christ I ask and pray these things.  Amen.
