                     ALIEN CONTACTS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.
 
 
 Even Western scriptures reveal evidence of extraterrestrial visitors, 
agrees Erich Von Daniken in his book Signs of the Gods. Von Daniken noted for 
his research into the possibility of prehistoric contacts with intelligent
beings from other worlds, sites as evidence the biblical mystery of the ark
of the covenant, an amazing box that supplied the Israelites with manna over
the 40 years they wandered in the desert. This "miracle" is explicable, he
writes, only if we assume that space beings had provided Moses` people with
a mie 40 years they wandered in the desert. This "miracle" is explicable, he
writes, only if we assume that space beings had provided Moses` people with
a miny-nuclear reactor that produced food from algae and dew. 
 
 Biblical scholar Zecharia Sitchan, himself and author, is also convinced that
there is evidence in the Old Testament in other ancient writings of the 
extraterrestrial guidance. He believes that Noah's ark provides a clear
example of such help. 
 
 According to the original Hebrew versions of these text's, Sitchan says, 
"Noah was advised to construct a boat roofed over and below and heretically
sealed with tough pitch. There were to be no decks, no openings, so that the
sun shall not see inside. The boat was to be a vessel that could turn and 
tumble."
 
 There is only one kind of boat that fits this decription says Sitchan:a
submarine. And he goes on to point out that, in ancientHebrew, the biblical
"ark" stems fromthe word sunken.
 No other type of boat could of endured the stresses and strains of 40 days
and 40 nights in such a raging flood, Sitchan contends. "No ordinary surface
vessel could of survived the tumultuous waves without being sunk."
 
 The story of Noah also appears in ancient texts from suner, now a pat of
Iraq, and Sitchan studied these as well. In a passage from one of them, 
according to Sitchan, Noah explains that he survived the flood thanks to the
help of superior beings from another planet who helped him built the ark.
 
 Like a modern submarine, Noah's ark had ballast tanks that made it possible
to submerge and to surface, Sitchan says. Before the deluge, it took an oxygen
supply, later surfacing when more was needed. 
 
 Renowned UFO investigator Brad Steiger agrees that there is clear evidence
that Noah's ark was a submarine and that the patriarch had to have received
advice from space aliens to build it. "One must have advised Noah to construct
a waterborne vessel to prevent his death," says Steiger.
 
 "But Noah would not have known the principles of building a craft. Being a 
mere mortal, Noah would not have the ability to construct a submarine. He 
would have needed extraterrestrial assistance to build his craft."
 
 Hayden Hewes, director of the International UFO Bureau, confirms this. "This
does not exist a single iota of doudt that Noah`s ark was a submarine,  craft."

does not exist a single iota of doudt that Noah`s ark was a submarine, And it
was built by Noah with extraterrestrial guidance."
 
 Obviously, ancient history is not the concern of modern governments, but when
the evidence mounts to prove that alien extraterrestrials are among us and 
making contact with us is in growing numbers today thoughout the world, it is
impossible not to wonder at the silence of the authorities in the best 
positions to know what`s going on.
 
 If the powers of our visitors were so far in advance of our own thousands of 
years ago, can we assume that they lagged while we caught up? And if, as so
many experts think, we are on the brink of direct, open contact with such
superior beings, it cannot help but affect all our lives. The possibility 
exists that, during their visits, "something may have happend to make the 
alien visitors angry or bellicose," as a Soviet researcher has speculated. Yet
the general media-television, radio, and the press, continue to follow the
official line and keep us in ignorance. It would be comforting to say that
those in authority know best and that, therefore, we have nothing to worry 
about. No matter how many people see them, UFOs have been defined as 
nonexistent. 
 
Many experts have begun to punch holes in the previously solid wall of 
denials. And the picture that is beginning to emere gives little comfort to
the skeptics. There is, for example, evidence not only of a long-standing
cover-up but also of contact on the highest level with alien extraterrestrials.
