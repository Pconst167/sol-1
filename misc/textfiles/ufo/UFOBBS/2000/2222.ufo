    Hi there.  My name is Ed Sanborn and I'm the MUFON State Director for
Mass.  I've been watching the traffic on Paranet for the last couple of weeks
and I'm quite pleased with what I read.  It's great to have the quick
turnaround on information exchange while reaching lots of individuals at one
time.  I received the following in the mail from a member of the LIUFON on
Friday Nov. 24, 1989:

                      PRESS RELEASE: FOR IMMEDIATE COPY
     The Long Island UFO Network, Inc., a non-profit research organization
based on Long Island, announces to the media of the Metropolitan area and the
Nation that we have evidence that on September 28, 1989 the United States
Armed Forces attempted to recover a disabled, or landed UFO.  The incident
occured on the Dune Area of Smith's Point Beach near entrance to the
Moriches Bay.  Military and Suffolk County Police Helicopters were involved
in
an apparent attempt to monitor the craft on the Beach.  A second object
estimated to be 574 feet to a thousand feet long was observed hovering over
the Bay.  It was composed of six tremendously large lights.
      The helicopters (six involved) were composed of four military
helicopters
and two Suffolk County Police Helicopters.  These helicopters surrounded the
large object (commonly referred to as a mother ship) in a circular rotation
passing around this object in a counter clockwise flight, the helicopters
would then fly over the second downed object in the dunes.  As this manuever
was completed, the area would be illuminated by the helicopters searchlights
in
an attempt to illuminate what was on the ground.
      Long Island UFO Network, Inc. has interviewed the eyewitnesses to this
event.  The family lives in Center Noriches Long Island.  The husband, wife,
and their adult son observed the large object from their backyard in response
to military helicopter overflights of their home.  The husband and son drove
to the Union Ave. dock and for two and a half hours observed the operation.
      The witnesses described the operation to LIUFON investigators' under
the
provision their identities and address be held in the strictest confidential-
ity.  For their protection they were interviewed on tape under fictitious
identities and addresses.  The husband's taped interview is available to the
media for examination with permission of the witness.
      The case is under further investigation by LIUFON investigators.  As
more information develops it will be released to the media.  The case will be
discussed at our foth coming conference on October 29th in Middle Island,NY
at
the Artist Lake Condominium Center.
      There exists 48 photographs of this occurence taken by the
eyewitnesses.
They have been impounded by LIUFON for scientific evaluation.  As soon as
tests are finished they will be presented to the public on the Joel Martin
Cable TV Show on cablevision at a date to be announced.
      We call upon the FAA, Suffolk County Police and the United States
Government to comment on this.  Did they have UFO's over Moriches Bay on
Sept.
28, 1989 between 8:45 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. and were they monitoring it?
LIUFON demands to know, the public demands to know and the World demands to
know.
          For further information contact the Long Island UFO Network, Inc.
