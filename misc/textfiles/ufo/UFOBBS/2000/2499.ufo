           REFLECTIONS ON THE K2 REPORT & OBSERVATIONS AT PILOT PEAK
           ---------------------------------------------------------

    Having  read  the Phoenix Project's K2  report and having  visited  the 
    Pilot Peak area I offer some of my impressions and observations. 
     
    Animal Sounds:  The K2  Report suggests there is curious lack of animal 
    sounds and indicated there is an unnatural quiet in the area. 
     
    Having spent 2 nights in the immediate area in question I can say there 
    was  nothing  I observed,  either by night or by day,  to support  this 
    contention.  The level of animal sounds was consistent with what I have 
    heard in other forested areas. 
     
    Animal  Life:  The K2  report makes much of the fact that there was  an 
    absence  of animal life in the area (this additionally supported by the 
    claim  of lack of animal sounds).  In particular the report comments on 
    the apparent absence of squirrels,  chipmunks, rodents,  owls and birds 
    flying over the area. 
     
    On  my first night at the Pilot Peak area I spent the night at  a  spot 
    over-looking the location of the "landing zones." I had an unobstructed 
    view  of  the area.  I  was there while the Moon was  still  below  the 
    eastern  horizon and I used a high-powered spotlight to illuminate  the 
    area.  I saw no less than two (possibly three)  deer - one of which was 
    very close by,  if not on,  one of the "landing zones."  Throughout the 
    night, owls could be heard hooting.  During the day birds could be seen 
    flitting about the meadow that contained the "landing zones"  and  both 
    squirrels and chipmunks were easily seen. At the very top of Pilot Peak 
    there  is  a  lookout  station which I explored.   There  I  found  two 
    exhausted  boxes  of  D-Con rodent killer and rodent droppings  in  the 
    first  and second floors of the station - clearly evidence of  rodents. 
    Another variety of rodent - bats - were seen in no small numbers around 
    the Pilot Peak area. 
     
    I  will  comment  on the K2  report itself concerning  their  claim  of 
    absence  of  animal  life  and animal sounds.  I  found  it  a  curious 
    contradiction that one of their observers (and I do not recall how they 
    identified him/her,  it was perhaps Contact #2,  but it was the one who 
    forgot  their  camera  and  had  to come back  the  next  day  to  make 
    photographs)  indicated that there was a sighting of a UFO and once  it 
    came into view all the animal noises ceased.  I  have to ask - If there 
    was  a  curious  and noteworthy lack of animal sounds  how  could  they 
    cease? 
     
    Landing  Zones:  Having seen the purported "landing zones"  personally, 
    and in some cases having walked over them, I have to say there seems to 
    be  a more prosaic explanation.  There was an abundance of deer  tracks 
    throughout the area.  It is not unreasonable to assume these are places 
    where  deer  have  rested.  I  found it odd that in the  midst  of  the 
    flattened grass there was,  in some instances,  a  variety of tall weed 
    that  was still standing,  unbent,  in the area of flattened grass.  In 
    addition,  the "landing zones"  exhibited none of the swirling patterns 
    associated with UFO "nests"  or the more recent crop circles.  Very low 
    strangeness  index and certainly subject to more "Earthly"  explanation 
    than landed craft.  I  also found other,  smaller,  areas of  flattened 
    grass which looked exactly like the purported "landing zones" but which 
    could clearly be discounted as such. 
     
    There  are  two other factors which weigh heavily against  these  areas 
    being "landing zones" which I will address next. 
     
    Camping Area:  Far from being the desolate area one might imagine  from 
    reading the K2  report there is a camping area immediately adjacent  to 
    the  "landing zones."  To the southwest,  and just behind a  moderately 
    dense  stand  of trees,  this camping area did  not  remain  unoccupied 
    during  the  time  of my visit.  On the first night  there  were  three 
    carloads of people camping and on the second night there was one family 
    there. The area of the "landing zones" is easily seen from this camping 
    area  and  access  to  the "landing zones"  from the  camping  area  is 
    immediate.   It is not the sort of area one would choose if one  wanted 
    any sort of privacy.  In addition,  the area of the "landing zones"  is 
    clearly  seen from the road which passes nearby and the view  from  the 
    road is unobstructed, save for two small trees, for over a quarter mile 
    of travel. 
     
    The Road: The report mentions a road which passes the K2 site.  This is 
    not  the unused and long-forgotten road one would envision from reading 
    the K2 report. Quite the contrary. During the day logging trucks, pick-
    up trucks,  residents of the La Porte & Quincy areas and campers travel 
    this  road.   While it will never resemble rush hour,  I  was  somewhat 
    surprised at the number of vehicles traveling that road as I thought we 
    were well off the beaten track. 
     
    At night the traffic is much less active.  The first night there was no 
    traffic  from 9 PM until 4:15  AM the next morning.  The  second  night 
    there  was traffic on and off throughout the night.  Again,  the meadow 
    with  the "landing zones"  is clearly and unmistakably visible from the 
    road. 
     
    Forest Service:  The K2  report alludes to the Forest Service personnel 
    being   mind-controlled  minions  of  the  Greys  and  says  they  were 
    questioned  about  their reasons for being there.  The report paints  a 
    picture of the Forest Service watching their every move and questioning 
    their every action. I found quite the opposite to be the case. Not once 
    did  the  Forest Service exhibit the slightest interest in what  I  was 
    doing  - even when I passed a Forest Service truck on the mine road  (a 
    dirt  road that leads right to the base of the summit of  Pilot  Peak). 
    The  only reaction I received from the Forest Service was a smile and a 
    wave as they drove past in their trucks. 
    
    --- 
     
    My  observations  cover  a brief period of time - from the  evening  of 
    Wednesday,  August 19 to the morning of Friday, August 21.  My comments 
    and  observations  can be verified and confirmed by Mr.  Ed Stuart  who 
    accompanied me to Pilot Peak. 
     
    As  Ed  has asked,  "If the facts we CAN verify are false then are  the 
    facts we CAN'T verify false?"  To which I must reply,  not necessarily, 
    but they are certainly called into question. 
     
    Other  lines of inquiry come to mind.  IS the corrdor from the west  to 
    Pilot  Peak actually RADAR blind as put forth by the Phoenix Project K2 
    report?   I'm sure any ATC person from the area can answer that  easily 
    enough. 
     
    I  also  think a discussion with Forest Service personnel is in  order. 
    Are  they  aware  that some of their members  are  being  presented  as 
    unwitting allies of the Greys?  Did they have occasion to question  the 
    activities of a group of people investigating the Pilot Peak area?  Has 
    there ever been a female member of their team, and if so,  who was she? 
    And  if  so,   what does she think of  the  seduction  for  information 
    scenario as described by the K2 report? 
     
    I think I'm ready to go ask some questions.
