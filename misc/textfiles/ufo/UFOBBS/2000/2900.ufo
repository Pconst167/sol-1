About two years ago, a friend and I saw something flying over the area I had
been told was Groom Lake. AAA Auto Club maps of Nevada show Groom Lake and Mud
Lake on them (Mud Lake is near the Tonopah home of the F-117s before moving to
Holloman AFB in New Mexico). I'm told by sitting near where the highway turns
towards the northeast from a southerly heading south of Warm Springs, you can
see 'interesting' things flying, mostly at night. I was told the best night to
see things is Wednesday night since that is supposedly the night with the least
amount of traffic on the road. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST GOING OFF OF
THE HIGHWAY AT NIGHT. We got 400 feet off of the road and within 10 minutes we
had headlight coming across the desert at us. We didn't wait to see who was
coming out to greet us...
