SUBJECT: THE PHOENIX PROJECT, K2 REPORTS                     FILE: UFO2480


PART 1


All,

As section leader of a UFO area on CompuServe, when we read the K2 report
from the Phoenix project we did not quite know how to take it.  Was this
another attempt at disinformation, a way to make a few bucks by getting you
to buy their printed paper, or was it for real.  So we decided to find out.

A member of my section, UFOlogy/Contacts, over this 4th of July holiday
weekend decided to check things out.  What he found you may find interesting.
This was in no way a complete check of the Phoenix groups claims, but
interesting nonetheless.  We are planning further expeditions to the K2 area
in the near future and I will keep all advised as to what we find, since it is
of importance to us all.

I would like to take this oppurtonity to thank Jason for taking time from
his holiday weekend to investigate this information.  I am sure
that this is going to be just the beggining of a very long and tedious
journey to discover the truth about this report.

If you have any questions of comments about this report, please forward them
to me.

David,

Well, I made it back from Pilot Mountain!  What a beautiful area.  It is
remote and would be a good spot to try and conceal something but I saw no
evidence to support the claims of the Phoenix report.  Keep in mind that I was
there for only a short time (1 1/2 days) and I did not have the actual K2
report with maps and descriptions of where EXACTLY the LZs, base, and
entrances were suppose to be.  When I do get the report I will more than
likely make another trip out there just to satisfy my curiousity and keep this
thing from growing into something it probably isn't.

I arrived in Quincy on Saturday at about 5:30am.  I then proceeded into the
Plumas Nat'l Forest via the Quincy-La Porte Road.  For the next five hours I
just drove around the dirt roads checking things out.  There is road
construction in progress complete with earth movers, bulldozers, graters, and
dump trucks.  It was a holiday so no constuction was going ons.  The existing
dirt roads were eroded, and narrow in places so, IMHO, the construction was
not suspect.  This area skirts the Feather River and some of its off-shoots
which is popular amoung trout fisherman.  That may be one reason the roads are
being repaired.  Also, it appeared that logging was prevelant in the area.
Since so much logging in various areas thoughout CA has been restricted I can
see logging interests putting in $$ to access areas where they are allowed to
harvest, which is what I think is happening.

The roads are poorly marked and thus confusing to get around on.  I looked for
most of that morning around the Pilot Peak area for the access road leading up
to the lookout station but could not find it.  It is probably a four wheel
drive type road and thus not evident to the passer by, which I'm sure I did
several times.  The tower placement on top of the mtn. is perfect. It's up
above everything and looks to offer a good view.  I decided to hike up there.

The Pacific Crest Trail passes through the area and skirts along the side of
Pilot Peak.  The trail head is well marked at PP's base so I took it.  The
trail was easy to follow and I took it up to the ridge where I cut off to get
to the lookout station. The last few hundred yards were VERY steep and strewn
with loose flagstone and gravel.  On my approach I could hear voices (kids)
and then see some young people in the tower.  They had left by the time I got
to the tower.  It took three hours to get there and the view alone was worth
it.  The station is abandoned and from markings in the cement appears to have
been constucted in 1976.  It is very well built and offers an EXCELLENT view,
360 degrees, of the surrounding area.  I can't imagine a better way to watch
the area then in that tower.  Once up there I could see a dirt road coming up
the mtn and stopping about 100 yards down slope.  The last part up to the
tower is 'feet only.'  I seriously considered going down the road to find
where it cuts off from the main road below but daylight was running out. I
poked around a bit more, took some pictures and headed back down to the trail
I had come up on.

When I got back I ate and by then it was dark so I drove out to a vista point
and watched the area for whatever.  During the night I drove to different
points of view...and saw nothing unusual. The next morning I slept a bit then
hiked around PP area a bit more.

From my cursory examination of the area I could not support the fantastic
claims made by The Phoenix Group.  However, I did not have a magnetometer,
geiger counter, or any other sofisticated equipment.  All I could do was
observe the area through an average persons eyes.  I did that and saw nothing
except a beautifully remote area.

The one odd thing I did see was at the Ranger Station in Quincy.  As I entered
the parking lot there's a sign showing visitors where to park, employees
parking, and one that reads "F.S. Heliport NASA."  I drove over to the
entrance to the "heliport" which had an open gate and a sign that read--"No
Trespassing  $500 and/or 6 months  Air Operations Restricted Area."  I could
not see beyond the gate because of the forest and slope of the hill.  I wasn't
sure if they enforced this notice but didn't want to find out right then.  Why
would NASA have a heliport way out there?  That I don't know and couldn't find
anyone to ask.

I've been too long winded already...I will get the K2 Report, find specific
locations to search and look things over again.  Any suggestions that would
enhance my efforts would be appreciated.

                                                 --Jason
