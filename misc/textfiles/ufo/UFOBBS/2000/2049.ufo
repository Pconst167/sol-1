SUBJECT: THE MICKUS/FENWICK INTERVIEW                        FILE: UFO2049


PART 2




       On November 6th/88, Lawrence (Larry) Fenwick, noted Canadian
       UFOlogist was interviewed for ParaNet on Sunday afternoon at 
       the Toronto residence of ParaNet Pi Sysop, Tom Mickus. He had
       previously agreed to this interview, with the full knowledge
       that it was being taped, and that the transcript would be
       released for distribution on the North American ParaNet System.

       He spoke for approximately 4 hours, of which approximately
       170 minutes were taped. During that time Larry spoke frankly
       and in some depth on a number of issues and events current
       to UFOlogy. The interview was done at my request, and Larry
       graciously assented to agree to the exchange, without any
       strings attached. Additionally, no money was exchanged.
       Although an interview, much the dialogue is in conversational
       style, appropriate for the informal setting which we were in.

       Regarding the content you are about to read, Larry neither
       makes the claim that this is original information, or
       that he knows all of it. But as you will see, he does have
       some pieces of the puzzle, in my estimation. Before the
       interview, I gave him every right to protect his sources,
       as well as have certain portions of the interview "off
       the record". While he has withheld some names, none of
       the substance of what we discussed was held back. Its
       all here for you to examine and evaluate.

       As I've mentioned, approximately 170 mins of our exchange
       was suppposed to have been on tape. However, after the
       interview, and to my extreme chagrin, I soon realized that
       the first 45 mins of the tape was almost blank, and the A-B,
       C-D order of the 4 sides seems to be haphazard. I am puzzled
       as to what happened, but at this point blame the recording
       device for screwing up...and of course also blame myself for
       not ensuring the integrity of the recording device, although
       the process was monitored throughout...and I am genuinely
       perplexed as to how this had happened. What I have therefore
       done, is to paraphrase the dialogue as much as possible, in
       order to bring out the 'highlights' of what we discussed in
       the first 45 mins. About one third of that had contained an
       in-depth bio of interviewee Larry Fenwick. Perhaps on a
       subsequent occasion, Larry can recount some of the
       information which we covered, a good portion which included
       commentary on the two recent TV productions, namely that of
       "UNSOLVED MYSTERIES - the Gulf Breeze segment", and of
       course "UFO-Coverup LIVE". For the time being, to the best
       of my recollection, some of what Larry brought up will be
       included in an appendix at the end of the formal transcript.

       One last note...this entire effort on my own part has
       consumed almost exclusively 4 days of my life. The transcibing
       process took close to 40 Hours, using simple tape recorders.
       Every effort has been made to insure the integrity of the
       dialogue of the part of Larry Fenwick. I can confidently say
       that I have reproduced accurately 99% of what Larry Fenwick
       said in the 125 mins of taped dialogue which was intact.
       The 40 Hours of time I think reflects this. My own dialogue,
       sparse as it is, is about 90% accurate. In some areas I have
       clarified my questions.

       Throughout, you will notice the use of square brackets [ ],
       these are added in by myself in areas that required some
       clarification...especially when certain mannerisms, inflection
       of speech, pause in speech etc., didn't "translate" into
       the written word sufficiently. Whereever you find words
       capitalized, that will indicate a word strongly emphasized,
       and indeed I have added this clarification in most of the
       instances.

       Lastly, although you may find some hints as to my interests
       and positions on various aspects of the UFO issue, I have
       not as yet come out in favour of, or against, most of what
       Larry Fenwick has said. For me, in part, the jury is still
       out. Having said that, I cannot help feel that much of what
       Larry Fenwick has enuciated here is quite significant. There
       should be enough information here for sleuthing armchair
       UFOlogists to get involved in, and to track down. The information
       conspiracy must end...the people must know. If what Larry and
       others say is true, even a part of it...then we don't have
       much time. In closing, I encourage you to spread the transcript
       of this file onto other Bulletin Board Systems. If it acts as
       a catalyst for action...pro or con...then it will have served
       its purpose.

[PART TWO...]

 <Mickus> "Obviously, what you've described about the Aliens
          involvement in Religion and before Genesis...is all
          pretty muddy."

<Fenwick> "It is, yes. Now as I say, from my point of view, from
          what I know, its muddy. But obviously there is a lot more
          information. Now maybe the majority of the rest of the
          information about Project Aquarius has to do solely with
          religion. It just may be."

 <Mickus> "You mean, what the future make-up might be...how the
          political and social structures might be? Because if its
          just a nuclear annihiliation..., there's gotta be
          something more there..."

<Fenwick> "Well, there's another thing too. Several abductees have
          reported, and we have investigated several cases...very
          plausible cases, where they've been shown the future of
          the planet...on board a UFO, by some sort of screen where
          they show films of the future on this planet. And you see
          devastation...everyone dying, and so on...from geological
          problems [ie. earthquakes, flooding, etc.]. I heard this
          from several abductees, credible people. The two ladies
          who were on the 'Man Alive' show [Note. That show's
          transcript, also done by ParaNet Pi, can be found in the
          File Library under ETHYPE.TXT], Dorothy and Betty...and
          Betty's one of our members by the way. So I questioned
          that, I said, 'You mean all the volcanoes on the earth,
          and all of them are going to erupt simultaneously, and
          all the earthquake faults...minor and major...are going
          to give way at the same time, and the North Pole...all
          the ice will melt very quickly, and all the coastlines
          will be flooded, and so on...' They said they saw all
          kinds of devastation...millions of people dying, they
          saw this. So I said to myself, 'Well...that's a
          possibility, its a possibility.' And I called Larry
          Fawcett, he's a police officer...Lawrence Fawcett. He's
          one of the two writer's of the book 'Clear Intent'. I
          called Larry...and I've talked to him before..., and
          I posed that question to him. I said, 'From whatever
          contacts you have with military intelligence, or whatever,
          could you tell me whether there will be any future events
          that will destroy most of the human race, having to do
          with geological problems." He said, 'No.' I said, 'What
          kind of source do you have?' He said, 'My source is a
          2-Star General who is in Project Aquarius.' He denied
          that anything 'geological' was going to happen. 'Its
          not going to be that at all'. I did not go any further
          and say, 'Well, is it going to be military, is it going
          to be sociological, is it going to be this or that.' I
          could have, but I didn't. I eliminated that possiblity
          as far as his... This is what he said, its second-hand
          information...or third-hand if it came from the aliens..."

          "There's another possibility too, that if you've read
          Thomas Bullard's [sp?] Ph.D thesis on abductions which
          is 600 pages long...dealing with 300 abductions. Most
          of the information given by the aliens to abductee's is
          LIES. So if they show these two abductee's [Dorothy and
          Betty] the future, its a lie. Why they lie, has not
          been gone into by Thomas Bullard. Why do they lie to
          us? Why do they lie to the abductees, about a lot of
          things? More than 80%...somewhere between 80% and 90%
          of the information are lies. WHY? That, we don't know.
          No one has speculated on that. You have to put yourself
          in their place. Suppose you had an IQ of 200, and you
          were 400 yrs. old, and you came from another planet to
          a planet where you were experimenting with people; why
          would you lie to them about their future. This is
          something that is a profound question...that no one has
          gone into in the UFO field...as far as I know. You
          have to put yourself in their place, and you can't do it.
          I mean, I got a 155 IQ, but its not 200! So I don't
          know, speculation is all you can do."

          "If what we've heard is true, and the events take place,
          then it will be too late to do anything about it anyway.
          If it doesn't happen, then we know that what Bullard's
          study has shown, is true...that it's lies, its all
          baloney. That what has been told by the aliens to MJ-12,
          and in particular to Project Aquarius...is lies. That
          is the most profound question. Probably the most profound
          question in the history of the human race. Because if it
          isn't lies...about WW III...then we've had it. We might
          as well live it up while we can too [laughter]. My way
          of living...I live it up, I'll tell ya. There's nothing
          that I won't do...within reason [more laughter]. But I
          stay within the law by the way."

 <Mickus> "What do you see happening in the next 2 years...what
          kind of things are going to surface?"

<Fenwick> "Well, if you talk about that television show on Oct.14th
          UFO-Coverup LIVE, and you look at the date now...and you
          follow the media; there hasn't been one single bit of
          reaction in the United States, because of the elections
          going on now. They are all concerned with elections. This
          wasn't the time to have that TV show on, everyone is
          concerned with the election. They should have waited until
          after the election. But they figured this; they wanted
          Reagan to open up...Reagan knows whats' going on. They
          figured that he would come up with a statement before the
          election,...he's a lame-duck president. If he makes a
          statement before Monday [Nov.7/88], then that show will
          have done some good. If he doesn't, then that show will
          have been no good at all, 'cause that's what they wanted.
          They wanted that show to be a catalyst, so that Reagan
          would talk publicly to the American public about what's
          going on. They had hoped that."

 <Mickus> "And what is Reagan's connection?"

<Fenwick> "He's part of the whole process...he's briefed."

 <Mickus> "Is he a member?"

<Fenwick> "Of Aquarius? Sure."

 <Mickus> "So its basically everyone in the upper hierarchy of
          the government."

<Fenwick> "We're talking about director of the CIA, director of
          the National Reconnaisance Organization, the National
          Intelligence Agency. The NRA wasn't mentioned there,
          there's also the Continental Army Intelligence Command.
          Those are some of the other agencies that werern't
          mentioned on that television show, but they were
          involved as well. The heads of them, the directors of
          them. Only them; who would have what they call, 'a need
          to know' basis. And on that basis, they are given the
          information...and they are not told what the other people
          know. They are only told what they need to know, for
          their own particular purposes. Their specialties are used
          by Project Aquarius. Reagan is not part of Project
          Aquarius, he is briefed on what they know."

 <Mickus> "So he's not one of the 24?"

<Fenwick> "He's briefed, that all. And the CIA director is not one
          of them necessarily. We don't know exactly who. It
          changes over the years. People die off obviously, all the
          original MJ-12 people are dead...except for one person."

 <Mickus> "And who is this?"

<Fenwick> "I don't know his name. I have a photograph of him with
          President Eisenhower...which was sent to me by one of
          our members [CUFORN] in western Canada, who has been in
          touch with a MUFON State Director who knows this man;
          knows where he lives, knows his name. Our Winnipeg
          member refuses to disclose the name to me, Harry and Joe
          [the 3 CUFORN Directors]. He will not give us the name of
          the man. The man is either 78 or 82 [years of age],
          somewhere in that area. He was in charge of

















          back to his original feeling that he should release the
          notes. And he mentioned also...the Winnipeg member
          mentioned that...his name is Grant Cameron [sp?] by the
          way in Winnipeg. He said that at the meetings, there
          were two meetings at which he presided, that he knows
          of; at those meetings were pieces of UFOs, dead aliens,
          and about 100 stenographers and secretarys taking notes,
          with the old stenographers and dictating machines and
          so on,...and they're all dead. Except this one man.
          Everyone is gone, every single person who was at those
          meetings is gone...except him. If we can track him down,
          that's the biggest story of all time...to get him to
          talk. One of the MUFON directors of one of the states
          was in touch with him AND his son. Now his son wants
          the father to release the information, but his father
          refuses now."

 <Mickus> "Why isn't he 'silenced'? Why don't they just do away
          with him?"

<Fenwick> "Because no one knows what's going on, besides the few
          people in the UFO community. This is very confidential."

 <Mickus> "Until now."

<Fenwick> "Well yes, obviously. Bill Moore and Stanton Friedman,
          particularly Bill Moore...is sort of on the outs with
          everyone else in UFOlogy; because he criticizes and
          debunks everyone except...anyone connected with the
          Roswell Incident, fine, or Gulf Breeze now. He has made
          a lot of enemies...Bill has. And people aren't passing
          information along to him in the UFO field..."

 <Mickus> "Anymore, or not much...?"

<Fenwick> "No, not very much at all. He will either debunk it, or
          keep it for himself and try and make money out of it.
          Because he's got no other income, other than his little
          lists of books he sells and magazines whatever, and
          pamphlets. So there is a lot of people who just don't
          want to talk to him...about what's going on. Now I
          talked to Stanton; Stanton's okay...but he's sort of
          under Bill's thumb. Whatever Bill says, [Stanton will
          say] 'Oh yah...", which is very unusual for Stanton
          because he's a very independent type of guy. But they
          work as a team, with Shandera. And Linda Howe...and
          John Lear...are quite aware of what's going on, of
          that aspect. They are quite upset by it."

 <Mickus> "What...the secrecy...the cliques?"

<Fenwick> "Yes the secrecy, and the cliques...exactly. I mean
          there's no room for cliques. I've written several
          editorials...one of which appeared in 'Flying Saucer
          Review' in England...about this situation. About the
          secrecy between UFOlogists. Work as a team as I've
          stated. Why don't we all work as a team...we could
          discover so much more as a team, than bickering
          among UFOlogists."

 <Mickus> "There's so little time..."

<Fenwick> "Yes. And they have rumours flying around. That's a
          waste of time! John's repeating rumours he's heard
          from Linda Howe...Linda Howe's repeating rumours
          she's heard from John Lear. Then other people hear
          about those rumours...and they get exaggerated even
          more so. And what's the truth? Who knows if there is
          anything to it. We have to get at the essence of what's
          going on. We want to find out all the other information
          about Project Aquarius. That's what we have to centre
          on. I was talking to Allen Spragget [sp?], who is
          probably Canada's foremost authority on ESP,...I took
          a night school course on ESP from him. He's interested
          in the UFO phenomenon, and he got a million dollars
          recently, from a Canadian benefactor to do a TV show,
          a series of shows on ESP and UFOs. Only one show on
          UFOs. He want the opening one [to be on UFOs]. And he
          thought that he would do one on MJ-12, and he told me
          about 3 days before the TV show was on, and I said,
          'You're a little late, in a matter of fact the show
          [UFO Coverup] is going to be about MJ-12.' [and then
          Spragget said], 'Oh...well that's out. What else can
          I do?' And I said, 'How about Project Aquarius. Only
          one show only on Project Aquarius.' He said, 'Fine.
          Where am I going to get the information?' 'Well', I
          said to myself, 'You're not going to get it from
          Bill Moore, but maybe you'll get it from Stanton
          Friedman.' So I gave him Friedman's address and phone
          number, in Fredericton. I haven't called Allen to see
          whether he's spoken to Friedman, and what information
          he's gotten from Friedman, or how many leads he's
          gotten. I doubt very much if Friedman even knows Allen
          Spragget. Allen's published a few books on psychic
          phenomena and so on."

          "If that were to come to pass...that a Canadian show,
          or series...with the opening segment on Project
          Aquarius, [that] would be the most astounding media
          event in history. To get that on the air...all the
          information..., if Stanton would talk openly about
          all the information he knows."

 <Mickus> "What do you think he knows?"

<Fenwick> "I think he knows it all. But if he would talk about
          it, and he thinks it should be done...  If they can
          get MJ-12 on a show, then why can't they get all that
          Project Aquarius stuff? It's not that much more of a
          leap...at least I don't think so, maybe it is...,
          Certainly if you can even mention Project Aquarius, as
          it was mentioned several times on the show [UFO Coverup],
          if you could even have mentioned that, then you've really
          got something. You've got your foot in the door...to
          breaking the whole thing wide open. But the key is 'the
          old man', what I call 'the old man'...whoever he is. If
          he will change his mind again; if Friedman can get to
          him. If he's right, Friedman says, 'I think I know who
          he is.', but he's not certain. Now whether he's gone
          after the wrong guy or the right guy...I don't know.
          I haven't spoken to Stanton in a while, its been about
          2 months since I've spoken with Stanton. If Stanton
          can get the old man to talk...then that can go on
          Spragett's show."

 <Mickus> "When is Spragget's show scheduled for?"

<Fenwick> "I don't know. He has to get information before he can
          do a show...so he's waiting. He's trying to find out
          more."

 <Mickus> "So you're encouraging Stanton and others to..."

<Fenwick> "...to be open. And join in a group effort. You've
          got to have that."

 <Mickus> "Do you think a lot of this reticence has to do with
          people wanting credit and..."

<Fenwick> "...and Ego. Bill Moore has the highest ego that you
          ever want to see in a UFOlogist...there's no question
          about that. There's no room for ego in this deal. We
          need co-operation. I was talking to Allen Hynek...I've
          met him in person several times, the late Allen Hynek...
          and each time I did, he said the same thing I'm telling
          you. Co-operate, CO-OPERATE...as a team. We need a team
          effort. There shouldn't be a MUFON, an A.P.R.O., an a
          NICAP, and all these other organizations. Well, there's
          no longer any NICAP or A.P.R.O., [but still ones like]
          CUFOS. There should be ONE the entire world,...with
          translation facilities and so on. Then you get the heart
          of the matter, then you can find out what's going on."

 <Mickus> "You have a network of people..."

<Fenwick> "Yes. And that's why the computer end of things is a very
          good idea. Because you do have the burgeoning network of
          people in the computer field. How many people are involved
          now in the computer field in UFOs. Its growing all the
          time. I think that there have to be more people who are
          in it full-time. That's the problem,...computers are a help."

 <Mickus> "Do you think that we have got to have less 'armchair'
          UFOlogists, and more people like yourself who are giving
          money for research and..."

<Fenwick> "...yes. And speaking...I've spoken at libraries and so on.
          And giving the information to the public...it has to be
          out there. Because, sure a lot of people may be bewildered
          by it, may not believe it, may not understand it...but
          there may be the odd one...all you need is one or two who
          have information..."

 <Mickus> "...you touch a nerve."

<Fenwick> "And touch a nerve....and [hope] they'll talk. Someone
          will say, 'I know someone who knows someone...', and
          then you go after that person, and say, 'Oh...what's
          his name, where does he live...give me his phone number
          and his address. Get that...if you can't get that, then
          forget what you've heard because it could be distorted."

<Mickus> "Yes, it's amazing how that can work. For instance I have
         someone on my BBS, not involved with UFOlogy at all...but
         yet he has a degree in Physics which he received at the
         University of New Brunswick, where Friedman taught. It
         just so happened that this particular individual was in
         charge of getting good speaker's for special physics
         department lectures, and when a good speaker from the
         states was available and he didn't have enough money to
         get him, he would go to the people who control the purse
         strings and request more funds. Alls he would have to do
         is hint that they were thinking of getting Stanton to
         speak, and shortly thereafter the money would become
         'available'. This of course refers to the stigma which
         other professional people place on anyone involved in
         a subject like UFOs. Your reputation is on the line."

<Fenwick> "Stanton's expensive. He charges $1000 an hour for
          lectures, plus airfare to wherever he's going, colleges
          and universities. I charge $50."

 <Mickus> "Does he lecture about nuclear physics?"

<Fenwick> "No, UFOlogy. He lectures at Universities. He's
          lectured at something like 300 Universities and Colleges
          across North America. But that's a weekend deal. And
          he's worked for the New Brunswick Power Commission, he's
          worked on the irradiation of food, that sort of thing.
          And that's his full-time job. So weekends he'll lecture
          at symposium somewhere or at a library or university or
          something."

 <Mickus> "The fact that he is getting such big money, do you
          think that that has some bearing on his willingness to
          release all that he knows?"

<Fenwick> "No. He has a big family, wife and kids. Stanton has to
          support a lot of research. He does a lot of research, not
          just lecturing. But he's after this Aquarius stuff...
          His phone bill alone is about $2000 a year at least."

 <Mickus> "I've spent that much on phone bills in 7 months."

<Fenwick> "If you have independent income, its great. What we need
          is a few millionaires in the UFO field."

 <Mickus> "Or a couple of rich widows..."

<Fenwick> "There aren't that many, John Lear's one I suppose. John's
          got a lot of money. We need more."

 <Mickus> "Well, he's got...I think he's got enough that he can
          afford to get around and do a lot of footwork. [Enough]
          to get out of the armchair and do some of this stuff."

<Fenwick> "He doesn't have the access to people that Bill Moore has
          though, or Friedman, or Tracy Torme for that matter."

 <Mickus> "Well, he was just meeting with 4 military people dealing
          with some sort of experimental weapons testing. He's
          got a lot of contacts in the aviation community as well.
          So he's got that going for him, other than just being
          a so called "celebrity's son". He talks a lot about SDI..."

<Fenwick> "How old is John by the way?"

 <Mickus> "He's about your age, in his 50's. He talks about SDI as
          being a weapon against the EBEs."

<Fenwick> "Oh yes, of course it is. That's well known among certain
          UFOlogists."

 <Mickus> "Could you elaborate then?"

<Fenwick> "Okay. Part of the exchange of technology which started in
          1975 was [that] SDI was given to the Americans."

 <Mickus> "What...lasers, particle beams?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, all this sort of thing. There was a little bit
          given mentally...in the 1930's to Bertrand Russel and
          Albert Einstein, about stealth technology. Which
          culminated in the 'Philadephia Experiment'. That was
          stealth technology, but the ship...[had] invisibility
          to radar, not invisibility...invisibility to radar.
          And that was continued. Then [with] the agreement,
          they were given more information in 1975 as to how to
          really set-up the stealth technology, also [with] the
          'Star Wars' system. Supposedly the 'good guys' are
          coming into this planet, and the 'grays' want to repel
          them using the Star Wars technology. Star Wars is not
          Soviet vs. American. It's Gray vs. the Nords or the
          tall ones. That's all it is. Its a cover operation.
          This is one of the things that John Lear was talking
          about, and Linda Howe...and also a fellow down in
          Arizona who has his scientific labs next to Kirtland
          Air Force Base."

 <Mickus> "You know the name of the lab?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, 'thunder'. Dr. Paul Bennewitz who is an electronics
          engineer. He was involved with the Kirtland sightings
          and so on. He's mentioned that 'stolen telex', having
          taken photographs of UFOs and so on...film, he's
          filming them."

 <Mickus> "This is the telex that Moore reproduced?"

<Fenwick> "Yes. He re-typed it. I think you have to realize that
          there is sometimes more than meets the eye. You read
          about the strategic defence intiative and stealth
          technology...this was given to the Americans as part of
          the agreement. And the other part of it,...part of the
          exchange or agreement was that the aliens and the
          American military were to collaborate on the cattle
          mutilations. The mysterious cattle mutilations that
          occurred...there was 100,000 of them known in the
          United States and Canada and other parts of the world,
          including Puerto Rico..."

 <Mickus> "...which were to get biological..."

<Fenwick> "DNA. In order to bring back one in 200 or 300 years,
          once the radiation has died out in this planet, a new
          race...a new 'Adam and Eve'...and cattle. You got to
          have food obviously. So you re-build, you build cattle
          whatever, out of DNA you 'grow' them. And this is the
          way you do the necessary work if you're going to think
          in long terms."

 <Mickus> "So this would tend to give credence to the fact that
          there is going to be a nuclear holocaust."
          "To get back to something we talked earlier on, how
          does the Jewish Messiah scenario going to work?"

<Fenwick> "I don't know. I really don't know. What I've said
          is all I know."

<Fenwick> "...I think that there is a lot of speculation about religion
          going on today among people who don't know enough about
          projecty Aquarius that would lead them astray as to what the
          facts are. Whatever they are, I don't think they got them, I
          have a hunch about that."

 <Mickus> "You're saying that the people looking at the religious
          elements, don't know enough about the actual documents,
          [content] etc...."

<Fenwick> "No...they are not interfacing enough...the people in the
          the religious field...such as Barry Downing and so on, they
          aren't communicating enough with people like Friedman and
          Moore...and so on, and Lee Graham. If they were to do that,
          they might come up with a lot more...of the religious aspect."

 <Mickus> "...you mean get a total picture of what's going on..."

<Fenwick> "Yeah, I think so, this is where you'd have to have
          co-operation between two extremes...religion and science in
          a way...but you don't get that. Separate fields...it
          shouldn't be...it should be one field...one entity, one
          group working together. Tracy and Mel [Torme] his father are
          very much like myself, sort of agnostic, they don't bother
          much with religion, although they are Jewish."

          "...Harry [Tokarz - CUFORN Director along with Joe Muskat and
          Larry Fenwick] does tend to go off the deep end at times...
          about theory...on theories. He doesn't go off on tangents like
          I do, I tend to go back and forth."

 <Mickus> "Is he Christian?"

<Fenwick> "No, he's Jewish. So is Joe, Joe Muskat our President, he is
          also Jewish. Joe isn't much in the UFO field, he's our
          president, just nominal, he knows a lot about photography, and
          is very skeptical...fairly skeptical. He's done some good field
          investigations, he's very good at that. But Harry is an all
          round type...now I'm not that good at field investigations, I'm
          good at writing about them, being a journalist. I've done some
          ...but Harry is probably the best out of the three of us...out
          of the triumvirate...troika, whatever you want to call it."

          "We've had some enquiries from the Soviet Union too...three.
          One from membership, from East Germany....one asking questions
          about telepathy and our research with UFOs, from a member of
          the Soviet Academy of Sciences from Novisibirsk, Siberia. The
          Institute of Medical Sciences...the man who has experimented
          on telepathy with rats...successfully. It was written up in a
          book called "Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain",
          something like that...I've forgotten the name of the book now.
          It was written by one of the fellows who used to write for the
          Inquirer [Enquirer...or Inquirer?], I don't recall his name.
          Those enquiries were quite interesting, I called the RCMP
          [Canadian Police organization akin to the FBI-CIA] on those."

 <Mickus> "And what happened..."

<Fenwick> "...we discussed it in my apartment for three hours with two
          members of the RCMP. One veteran man from the security service,
          who has since been transferred to Ottawa. And the other fellow
          from the communications division. I answered the letters with
          questions, in another letter. And I said [to the RCMP officers]
          make sure you intercept any replies you get from the Soviet
          Union, and I don't want to hear what the replies are. I don't
          want to hear."

 <Mickus> "Oh...really?"

<Fenwick> "Nah."

 <Mickus> "...you just didn't want to get mixed up in this..."

<Fenwick> "That's right. They spent three hours in my apartment...we
          talked about underwater bases in Lake Ontario, and this sort
          of thing, and they said 'We know about it, but we can't
          afford to get down there to see them.'"

 <Mickus> "Really?"

<Fenwick> "Yeah, they know there's a base under there. Near Hamilton
          in fact. In the deepest part of the Lake, there is an
          underwater base containing a museum."

 <Mickus> "Containing a museum?"

<Fenwick> "Yeah, one of the two museums they [EBEs] have. One of two we
          know of. One off of Cape Cod, and one in Lake Ontario. The
          one off of Cape Cod is a technological museum which deals with
          living things, which are frozen in time...sort of."

 <Mickus> "Ours or Theirs?"

<Fenwick> "Ours. The one in Lake Ontario is a technological museum of
          devices for [determining?] past, present and future. Our future.
          And those have been recounted in two abduction cases. The
          'Andreasson Affair' was the Cape Cod one, the museum was
          mentioned there. And the abduction in St. Catherines of Jack T,
          that was the technological museum.

          So they're setting up museums...maybe for tourists...from other
          planets? I dunno...who knows? I mean what the hell would you
          do with a tourist, you go to museums. Logical enough from our
          point of view. [previous paragraph was tongue-in-cheek]"

 <Mickus> "You sure that they're not Labs?"

<Fenwick> "No...no, they aren't. They don't do experiments. They are
          frozen in...plastic, something like that."

 <Mickus> "Now, this entering into Lake Ontario, how would they actually
          do that...just go into the water?"

<Fenwick> "Yeah. Going into the water, sure. They don't create a splash
          or anything like that. They deflect gravity, and deflect the
          waves so that there is no splash and so on. We've had a few
          reports, some daylight reports that I've had. People won't
          talk any further about them. This one guy, someone I knew
          through a friend at work...who had been out in a boat in Lake
          Ontario, just down near Humber Bay. One afternoon, rain had
          just stopped...he was out fishing. And he saw this UFO under
          the water...fluorescent...long sort of circular disk, under
          the water, just a few feet under the water, it was smoothing
          along under water, and it went out way towards Mimico, then
          went Shooooshhhh back up to the sky like that [motions a
          sharp steep upward curve]. Just like that. And I can't even
          get the man to talk any further. I only spoke to him through
          someone I knew through work, and not only on the phone...I
          know the girl, this is her brother in-law. Went out with a
          couple of other guys, there was three guys who saw this thing
          and it was in broad daylight. It was just under the water, and
          right beside their boat. They were scared as hell. And they
          saw it shoot up into the air, it was sort of a greyish metallic
          colour to it...and it went straight up, and was a disk shape.
          And this is...oh about five years ago, something like that. I
          have to look up my notes, I only made scribbled notes from a
          telephone call at work, and it was all...I have a lot of
          scribbled notes unfortunately. Only once in a while I get
          around to typing some of this stuff out."

 <Mickus> "One of the things mentioned by John Lear, as shown in this
          column in the Fall issue of the Skeptical Inquirer is that
          the Air Force currently has about thirty bodies of extra-
          terrestrials in their possession. Do you think that is an
          accurate number.?"

<Fenwick> "I would think so."

 <Mickus> "What about live aliens, are there any currently being held
          captive?"

<Fenwick> "Yeah, there is one which is the guest of the American gov't,
          obviously one. I wouldn't say that he's a captive he's a
          guest."

 <Mickus> "And what do you know in regards to that?"

<Fenwick> "I don't know what he would know. I really don't know."

 <Mickus> "But where is he staying, how are they treating him? Do
          you know anything about that?"

<Fenwick> "No. No. I don't no. Other than what was on the TV show I
           don't really know. But if he is a guest of the American
           government, that could be a pseudonym for a captive. But
           if they are running the show. If these aliens are...and I
           say IF...if they are running the show, they are telling
           the Americans how to handle the whole situation, then He's
           in charge. Not a guest or a captive...he's in charge. He's
           telling them what to do. If you had an IQ of 200, and
           you're 400 years old lets say...375 years old, you can do
           anything you want on this planet, and ain't nobody who's
           going to stop you...really."

 <Mickus> [refering to CSICOP's Skeptical Inquirer - holding up an
          issue]

<Fenwick> "...all the debunker's, armchair theorists."

 <Mickus> "What is the line on Klass?"

<Fenwick> "What I know of Klass is through Todd Zechel. Who has had
           battles in print and book.  W. Todd Zechel, who has written
           under the name of Ted Zachary for 'UFO Report' magazine...I
           believe it was. He wrote a few articles [on it]. I forget
           which issue it was, but he has written a few articles under
           his name, and that phony name. And Todd has an unpublished
           phone number, he uses his parent's phone and address...some
           box number in Minnesota. I've talked with his parents, and
           to him, on the phone. I've never met him in person. And he
           and Klass have had this battle about his background. Klass
           says how he worked in a bawdy house, he worked in a gas
           station, [how] he never worked for the National Security
           Agency. And Zechel says he [Klass] worked for NSA for ten
           years and saw autopsy results on his desk...on dead aliens,
           this sort of thing. And he [Zechel] said....he went into a
           whole article, I don't know if you saw the article, I have
           it at home...about Klass and his KGB connections, and CIA
           connections..."

 <Mickus> "Now...do you believe what you are saying? [Klass allegations]"

<Fenwick> "Yes. Implicitly. He went into enough detail, that there was
          not any doubt about it. He talked about Artamanov, who was the
          head of the Soviet KGB's Assassination Bureau, who was a
          personal friend of Philip Klass. He was sent over to assassinate
          another Soviet...and Klass has been friends with him...they have
          gone out on his yacht on the Potomac River...in American waters.
          Klass' apartment, by the way, has been bugged by the FBI...has
          been for quite some time. And Klass refuses to acknowledge that.
          He works as a double agent, for both the KGB and CIA."

 <Mickus> "He's a double agent?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, for quite some time now. He's an "asset". What the CIA
          call an asset. He doesn't work for the CIA directly, he's an
          independent asset, having worked as the editor for "Aviation
          News and Space Technology"...he's what they call an asset.
          In other words, he publishes information that is fed to him by
          the CIA...what they want published about technology....military
          technology...gets into the magazine because of him. Of course,
          he's retired now, he doesn't work for the magazine any more.
          I've seen references to him still being with them [magazine],
          he's not, he's retired. ...And he was seen on the yacht
          talking to Artamanov...the assassin, or the Head of the
          Assassination Bureau. And Klass has admitted publicly that he
          has spent time, in bed, with a Soviet female agent...before he
          met his wife. But he says [Klass speaking], "that doesn't make
          me a KGB agent." [provokes laughter...which causes Fenwick to
          remark]...on no, not much it doesn't [more laughter].

          And then, Zechel had published a series of journals called,
          "For Your Eyes Only", which is a very good title. And I have
          all the issues except for one...but then he [Zechel] stopped
          publishing. And his next issue was supposed to have an article
          showing the Klass-CIA connection in terms of the UFOs. It
          never appeared. And I have not had a chance to get in touch
          with Todd for 5 months...something like that. I paid my dues,
          my subscription fee, but I never got a hold of the that other
          journal, a whole years [worth of] journals missed...I missed
          the last one...and had to renew I guess.

          He's very anti- Bill Moore. They have one hell of a royal
          battle going on in print at times. Much as Klass was against
          Zechel, very vituperative sort of thing."

 <Mickus> "So Klass' role then...is to go around debunking all this
          stuff because...."

<Fenwick> "Because he's been told to."

 <Mickus> "He's been told to?"

<Fenwick> "Sure, he's doing his job, that's all. I've seen all his
          techniques on television...look at your watch...'oh..this
          isn't important, I'll look at my watch...' [Klass] will
          talk in generalities. [example - Klass speaking again]
          'I've done research on so many cases.' What cases? He never
          says. 'Of the hundreds of thousands of reports that I've
          investigated...' Hundreds and thousands? C'mon... Sometimes
          hundreds, sometimes thousands...it varies according to what
          network he's on. In other words...ABC, CBS or whatever...
          you know...it changes all the time. I got one of his books,
          his first book. I went through that with a fine tooth comb,
          and I had marked the margins all the way through. And I
          wrote a letter to him, and he said, "Aw, you're all....if
          you know so much about UFOs then you must be an alien."
          I've got his letter to that effect [laughter]. And I took
          apart his first book completely...I mean there isn't a
          single fact that is verifiable there....and there are a lot
          of lies in there, and a lot of cases that no one in the UFO
          community has even heard of. [In regards to] obvious hoaxes,
          he's picked out those ones...and then says that these are
          typical of the UFO field....that's how he [Klass] operates.
          And I've studied propaganda techniques at first year
          journalism at Ryerson [Polytechnical in Toronto], the first
          thing we did was study a sheet of propaganda techniques...
          and he [Klass] has used them all. He's done his job, and
          the other people at CSICOP have done their job too...
          Sheaffer and Oberg. Oberg is a little more open minded than
          some of the others. Harry [Tokarz] has had some
          correspondence with Oberg...which isn't too bad actually,
          although Oberg threatened to sue Harry, and Harry threatened
          to sue him back...and nothing happened. Those three are the
          CSICOP members in the UFO field...although there was that
          channel 79 thing that they got involved in too, a few years
          ago where there was a debate on UFOs. And then they had...
          whats his name...the head of CSICOP in Buffalo...talk on the
          show, and he was really arrogant...and it was quite a show.

          It seems to me that there is also a Soviet connection, other
          than Klass. First of all, James Oberg does spend time in the
          Soviet Union and he has connections between NASA and the
          Soviet Space program...he speaks perfect Russian...and so
          does Carl Sagan speak perfect Russian. Carl Sagan spends
          several months of the year in the Soviet Union. And Sagan
          has made his statements through books and other appearances,
          about UFOs...distorting the Betty and Barney Hill case on that
          'Cosmos' series...beyond belief...I mean it [the way Sagan
          presented it] was nothing like what happened. And then there
          was that show that was done on PBS debunking UFO's, and
          [Sagan] got his word in there too, as did Klass. It seems to
          me that the Klass-Oberg-Sagan triumvirate is the Soviet KGB
          connection between CSICOP and the Soviets. That is the
          connection right there. And they may all be double agents."

 <Mickus> "What is the Soviet UFO interest anyway?"

<Fenwick> "The interest in the technology...propulsion systems."

 <Mickus> "Do they have similar things going on as in the alien - U.S.
          government arrangement?"

<Fenwick> "We've heard a few things, but only through the Enquirer,
          about supposedly there was an attack on an alien base by
          the Soviets..."

 <Mickus> "But would you place some credence, or alot [as to the
          veracity of the UFO stories in the 'National Enquirer']"

<Fenwick> "Yes. Some....Some. I think when you look at those three
          fellows, Klass, Oberg and Sagan...you've got certainly
          with Klass a double-agent. Oberg possible. Sagan maybe.
          But I think there is a connection there. Now, I have heard
          stories and theories about maybe the Soviets and the
          Americans are working together on the UFO phenomenon,
          [but] I don't think so. I think that they're both
          interested in it, and that the 'good guys', the 'tall
          ones' [Nords] who look like us, are working with the
          Soviets, and the 'bad guys' [Grays] are working with the
          Americans, which is really strange...but I think that's
          what's happening."

 <Mickus> "So its basically just those two groups [aliens] which
          are involved?"

<Fenwick> "Yes. Those are the two main races, of course."

 <Mickus> "It would seem to make sense [using this scenario] that the
          Aliens would play off the superpowers against one another."

<Fenwick> "Yes, this is why that when the Soviets and Americans talk
          about SDI, the Soviets are against the SDI because any of
          the tall ones who are coming back down to this planet...
          maybe in some future invasion, or whatever in 1990...who
          knows what it is... The Soviets, being linked with the good
          guys would not want the Americans to have the SDI program
          to fend off the good guys. Makes sense...so there may be a
          ...I'm just saying, this is just theory...but it may be, it
          just may be. I hope I'm wrong. I hope the Americans are with
          the good guys, and the Soviets with the bad guys...that
          would make more sense from a Western point of view [jokingly]"


                              [-Break-]


<Fenwick> "...with the U.S. Navy being involved with Aquarius [Project]
          in the states."

 <Mickus> "Is the U.S. Navy to a large degree involved with Aquarius?"

<Fenwick> "Yes...the Canadian...all navies are involved...we have a
          member [of CUFORN] of the Swedish Navy who just joined."

 <Mickus> "Is the fact that the navies are involved related to the
          existence of the underwater bases?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, I think so. Basically, that's part of it. But people
          would never suspect the Navy being involved in land events
          you see, so that's one way of covering it up...use the Navy.
          Its a very good cover."


                             [-Break-]


<Fenwick> "The public must know. It has to be put in the proper context
          for the public, so that they can take it. That's very
          difficult."

 <Mickus> "Getting back to the Moore 'programming' thing, I wanted to
          get into that in a little more detail, 'cause lets face it,
          it does sound a little..."

<Fenwick> "Farfetched?"

 <Mickus> "Farfetched, strange...whatever you want to call it."

<Fenwick> "Yes...it certainly does. He [Bill Moore] may have had an
          incident whereby a scar was left...they [EBEs] took tissue
          samples, and at that time a probe MAY [his emphasis] have
          been inserted in his head. A probe whereby he would be
          implanted with a communication device whereby they would
          program him to act the way that he is acting. Thats all
          I'm saying. Maybe."

 <Mickus> "And when did this incident take place, when you confronted
          Moore with this allegation?"

<Fenwick> "1982 at the MUFON Symposium in Toronto."

 <Mickus> "And you said..."

<Fenwick> "He said...I'll go into more detail here...He said that when
          he was....his mother asked him..."

 <Mickus> "So you asked him first...just to clarify exactly what the
          exchange was between the two of you..."

<Fenwick> "Yes, I said, 'What's that scar...I think I notice a scar
          there?' [Moore now speaking ->] 'Yeah, I covered up my
          moustache' I said [Fenwick], 'How did that happen?' He says,
          [Moore again] 'Well...I think it was as a child, some kid
          threw his little metal toy truck at me' [Fenwick] or
          something like that. [Moore] '...but my mother says it
          never happened. All she said was that I came home bleeding
          one day, and you said' [Moore as a child] 'I don't know
          how this happened.' [Fenwick] And that's all. 'And this is
          what I think happened [Moore referring to the toy truck
          story].' 'But I don't know', he said [Fenwick referring to
          Moore again] 'I really don't know, and I don't want to
          talk about it anymore.'[Fenwick again] ...and that was all."

 <Mickus> "And what was his manner of speech at the time?"

<Fenwick> "And then I said, 'Maybe you were abducted?' He said, 'I
          don't want to talk about anything like that.' [Fenwick
          again] thats all. He had fear in his face...fear in his
          eyes, he was AFRAID [Fenwick's emphasis]"

 <Mickus> "He had fear in his eyes?"

<Fenwick> "Oh Ya, Definitely. He started shaking."

 <Mickus> "He started shaking?"

<Fenwick> "Ya...just for a second. He turned his face away from me."



 <Mickus> "How does the major media handle UFO sighting information?"

<Fenwick> "The three major networks, according to Tracy Torme...there
          are three men who work with Project Aquarius, who are senior
          executives, or are under contract with Project Aquarius, at
          CBS. Three of them. There are two with NBC, and one at ABC.
          In other words they monitor what goes on the air. They WILL
          NOT allow anything to go on the air, because of their status
          within the networks, that has to do with Project Aquarius.
          And that's why ["UFO Coverup - LIVE tv prog] had to go on
          the Lexington Broadcasting System in the states, which has
          one hundred and ninety outlets, and it was on those stations,
          which are in major markets in the United States, and on
          Global [TV Network] in Canada. Not CTV or CBC. Minor stuff
          [tv stations that is]...so this is how they keep it out of
          the major networks."

 <Mickus> "And there is nothing written? Its all verbal?"

<Fenwick> "That's right...Tracy tried to get ahold of ABC, but they
          turned him down flat. And he knows people there, but it
          didn't help any. They are the most likely of the networks to
          put something on [connected with UFOs] since there is only
          one man there from Aquarius, or on contract with them. So
          he [Tracy] thought he'd try that one, but it didn't work."


 <Mickus> "What about Groom Lake, what do you know about that?"

<Fenwick> "That's the crash in '84 of the UFO. Robert Bond, General
          Robert Bond, he's the pilot. That's Groom Lake. I found
          it on the map by the way."

 <Mickus> "Is that a base of some sort?"

<Fenwick> "...its on the fringe of the Atomic Energy Commission's
          testing grounds. Groom Lake is a dry lake, its on the
          map of Nevada, I found it. Fair size lake, a dry lake. Its
          surrounded by mountain ranges...no towns around it. Its
          restricted airspace. That's where the crash occurred. Its
          where they test experimental vehicles, that area."

 <Mickus> "What about Dulce, New Mexico?"

<Fenwick> "Dulce? That's on the border between Mexico and Arizona."

 <Mickus> "And supposedly there is a huge underground base there..."

<Fenwick> "Supposedly, this is Tracy Torme's surmised...what he's
          talked about. No one's seen an underground base [those in
          UFOlogy circles], they've only guessed. Its only been
          guesswork about that, and [about] some incidents that have
          occurred down there, some sightings."

 <Mickus> "...and the incidents...about fighting and shooting between
          soldiers and...."

<Fenwick> "Rumour. Rumour. That's all rumour."

 <Mickus> "So...you have nothing to add then..."

<Fenwick> "No..no...what's been printed in the National Enquirer or
          other magazines or between UFOlogists...no ones proved that
          at all. That could be a lot of nonsense."

 <Mickus> "One question I have to ask [from ParaNet Member Joe Holland],
          goes as follows, ' I keep getting indications the aliens are
          preparing the abductees to act or do something at some future
          time, and they are being programmed with the knowledge of
          what to do, this knowledge to emerge later. Like Budd Hopkins
          said, they were shown a box that they would know what to do
          with later. Have you come across this? What is the future
          time, and what is supposed to happen? A natural disaster?
          An invasion, takeover?'"

<Fenwick> "No one knows...except the abductees....I have a tape of
          'Jack' in St. Catherines, I have a tape of his subconscious
          talking, under hypnosis. Saying that if he were to REVEAL
          what he is programmed to do...then it would self-destruct,
          the program. So it cannot be revealed."

 <Mickus> "So who is this person again?"

<Fenwick> "'Jack'...its not his real name, he's an abductee. One of
          the three guys from that rockband who were abducted
          [reference to a past CUFORN investigation]."

 <Mickus> "Does he have an implant?"

<Fenwick> "Oh Yes, sure. But he is not to know what that mission is...
           You talk about a mission..."

 <Mickus> "Obviously its ominous. An assassination..."

<Fenwick> "Who knows...he's used the name Mission, thats all."

 <Mickus> "So its all just speculation then..."

<Fenwick> "That's right. But Harry and I agree on that...all the
          abductees have the same mission. Helping maybe...helping
          survivors or something. I knows theres been talk..."

 <Mickus> "Oh...so it could be positive in a way?"

<Fenwick> "Oh Yes, sure it could be. The survivors of the catastrophe
          or whatever it is, will be assisted by abductees. Move to
          higher ground or safe ground, whatever. The one geological
          thing was supposed to be the flooding of the coastlines and
          so on, but also [that] southern Ontario will be underwater
          all the way to Barrie. The CN tower will be underwater. And
          this is 1990. We're talking 1990. Also central China will
          be underwater...a huge lake. And England underwater, the
          United Kingdom completely underwater. No Florida left,
          New York City gone."

 <Mickus> "That might indicate some kind of pole shift..."

<Fenwick> "All sorts of things are possible. Maybe a whole series of
          things. But again, this 2-star general said no...nothing
          geological is involved at all. And this is 1990 we're
          talking. Probably just after this, or just before this
          meeting between the Anti-christ and Enoch and so on. All
          that same year...that's what we've been hearing. It just
          seems too much of a coincidence. Something is going to
          happen that year...but what it is I don't know, I'll put
          it that way. Something...but what it is I don't know.

 <Mickus> "You mentioned earlier to me, that you see in the coming
          months, similar Gulf Breeze type incidents, that don't
          exactly create a lot of controversy among the public, but
          the media..."

<Fenwick> "...publicizes them."

 <Mickus> "But you definitely don't think it [GB] was a hoax though?"

<Fenwick> "No. Gulf Breeze? No. I think that there's something to
          it...I don't necessarily believe the photographs, but I
          think somethings happened down there. The photographs
          may be hoaxes. I haven't seen the photographs from the
          other people. No names have ever been released of the
          other people who took these photographs. There's talk
          only. Who are these people? I haven't seen any names."

 <Mickus> "There's something about just looking at the GB photos
          that..."

<Fenwick> "...doesn't seem right."

 <Mickus> "The port holes [in the UFO]..."

<Fenwick> "...I know, it looks too good in a way. Its like the Meier
          case.  I think that something has happened down there [GB],
          and the media are picking up on it. And publicity....in the
          past you never had flaps getting major publicity like this.
          That's the only thing that's happening."

 <Mickus> "Somebody has suggested recently that what could happen is
          that this thing could be exposed shortly, and put UFOlogy
          back underground for another five years."

<Fenwick> "That could happen too. Everyone's cautious about this. You
          have to be. Even MUFON, in their magazines they've said the
          same thing...who knows, maybe its all a hoax. They haven't
          said outright, except lately, that its 99% proven. No ones
          done a complete...not even Bruce Maccabee hasn't done a
          complete enough analysis on these photographs. No one has,
          which is odd. You know Bruce has said that he has looked
          at all the photographs...and he talks about the things he
          looks for...but he hasn't shown anything on that TV show,
          he did not show any printouts of the computer analysis,
          until I see that, and I know how that's done...then I
          leave everything up on the air. I do think that something
          has happened there. If there are ten cases, reports of
          'missing time'...something in UFOlogy, something has
          happened, [if] there have been encounters. The photograph
          may have something to do with something else. I think
          the photographs may be a hoax."


 <Mickus> "Getting back to the Harbinson books now..."

<Fenwick> "They are tests of the readers. The latest one [Light of
          Eden] is a little bit off base. I think of the three books,
          the second one, "Revelation" is the one that is closest to
          the truth. Or certainly would evoke the most comment from
          readers, of the three. [The books] are testing the waters,
          psychological testing. Now maybe the aliens, through NSA,
          through Harbinson, want to test Us...find out what are
          minds are like, how we react to things like this. That
          could be all it is. Its a thought...that may be all that
          they are doing here."

 <Mickus> "Now what if someone says to you, prove to me that Harbinson
          was an NSA operative. What would you say?"

<Fenwick> "How would I prove that Harbinson was NSA?" I've only
          heard through someone else, second hand. And no where
          in the background of Harbinson is it mentioned that he
          was NSA, obviously they wouldn't mention that."

<Mickus> "Needless to say, people are always looking for hard
         proof and evidence in this field, for obvious reasons.
         What would you say to them in light of what you have
         said today, with the many claims?"

<Fenwick> "...thats right [people always say] 'Show me the facts
          ..show me statements...show me statements.'"

 <Mickus> "And no doubt many will say that of you..."

<Fenwick> "Of course, sure. We have to have some skepticism,
          obviously, and I've shown my skepticism to some extent
          [today]. So I think you have to be conservative, and at
          the same time you have to be open-mnded, a little bit
          of both, a balance of the two. I've been 37 years in
          UFOlogy, so I know a little bit about what's going on.
          I have an overview by now. I'm not the only one...we
          have one member [CUFORN] who's been in it longer than
          I have. Bill Allen was formerly a field investigator
          at A.P.R.O, who lives out in B.C.[British Columbia].
          So if you are in it long enough, obviously you are going
          to get some sort of overview."

 <Mickus> "Ok Larry, I think we covered most of the things I wanted
          to cover. If you would like to finish up with a summation
          as to where you think UFOlogy is today, and where its
          headed..."

<Fenwick> "Ok fine...any other questions that you have, I would be
          glad to answer them."

 <Mickus> "Yes, it would be nice if you could come back in, lets say
          three weeks? And attempt to answer any questions that have
          arisen by that time."

<Fenwick> "Yes, sounds fine....There's only about 5,000 people in
          North America involved in UFOlogy...something like that..."

 <Mickus> "Yes, and its growing all the time. A lot of people with a
          casual interest..."

<Fenwick> "Thats all, a lot of those fringe people. We don't get those
          people as members at all, we're too fussy, we're not another
          MUFON. You know they'll accept pretty well anyone into the
          organization. We're fairly fussy about that."


          "I think that what we have to do, is to maintain an open
          mind with skepticism, about whatever we hear about the
          UFO field. Regardless of how long we've been in it, or
          what are viewpoints are. And we have to say to ourselves,
          'If what has been talked about, at this point in time is
          true, [then] there's very little that we can do about it.
          So we might tend to become fatalistic, and say well, live
          it up...live for today and forget about tomorrow, because
          we're all going to go. Or maybe we can say that it is all
          baloney'...and so what? Again, with WW III coming up, what
          can we do to tell the public. Why stick to the UFO field
          then. Why don't we as field investigators, those who have
          gone out into the field and investigated these cases...why
          don't we spend more time educating the public, and not
          saying to ourselves, 'Oh, well what do they [the public]
          know about it'...let them find out what we know about it,
          and what we don't know about it. What we are guessing
          about, and what we know. You have to counter the frustration
          and ignorance of the general public in regards to what
          UFOs signify...I think that might be the best way to put
          it in general. Whats the phenomenon, if you want to use
          the word phenomenon, I don't like the use of that word.
          But what does it mean to the human race, and to the future
          of the human race. If we give information to people...
          information can't hurt you, it can only help you. Fear
          is the worst thing you could have...if you don't know those
          things and are afraid of it. If you know the truth, then
          you can't be afraid. You'll be set free from your fears.
          You have to be willing to disseminate information...and
          mention theory, as theory only...speculation only. Try
          and get feedback from the public also, and from people in
          the military intelligence area who may feel as we do, that
          the public should know more about what's going on. I think
          that summarizes what I'm going to say."

 <Mickus> "If what is going to happen...is going to happen..."

<Fenwick> "...what can we do about it. If we can't do anything about
          it..."

 <Mickus> "...but CAN we do anything about it?"

<Fenwick> "Yes, that's the question, the main question...'can we'. I
          really don't know if we can do anything about it. I've
          been living hedonistically for a few years now, since '82
          actually...[half-humourous]"

 <Mickus> "Yes, but there's got to be something that we can do...
          Education..."

<Fenwick> "Education...preparing people for the inevitable...or the
          evitable...the unavoidable"

 <Mickus> "I mean this isn't set in stone...theoretically people
          could alter what's going to happen..."

<Fenwick> "En masse maybe, not individually. If they [EBEs] know the
          future, then there's nothing we can do about it."

          "You have to discuss using, if you are in the UFO field,
          your knowledge...your background, your reading...your
          contacts, your speculations. You have to discuss all these
          things, cases...individual cases. You have to discuss
          statistics...the results of statistical studies that have
          been done. And unfortunately there have been a lot of
          statistical studies done, but very little in the way of
          analysis of the statistics, in every area of the UFO field.
          That needs to be done, and very few writers have done it.
          I mean that there's a lot of books out...various compendiums
          of things, and specific cases... You have to be very
          cautious about what you read about the UFO field. You
          have to make notes as you read. [saying to yourself] 'I
          remember this case...that correlates with the one he's
          talking about in this chapter here...or make a note in the
          margin about another case...' And I do that when something
          ties in. If you get enough..., its like, if you go out to
          investigate a UFO report, if theres only one observer, then
          it doesn't mean a lot, if there are two...then it means
          more. Same theme, correlations...combinations, this sort of
          thing, multiple observer...and cases that are similar in
          some respects...that are major aspects of a case."

 <Mickus> "The 'yellow book' and the 'blue book'...do you know what
          is in those?"

<Fenwick> "No. Sounds like a whole bunch of things are mixed in. I
          would be more interested in reading what Meier supposed...
          I've got a little bit more about him..."

 <Mickus> "So you're not willing to write the Meier thing off?"

<Fenwick> "No I'm not. Nor is Harry [Tokarz], Harry thinks its all
          genuine too. Joe [Muskat] is skeptical. Very...he thinks
          its all baloney, that Meier thing. I don't know. I just
          don't know. I have to be honest, I don't know. I'm neutral
          on that. Show me...show me the facts, show me proof...
          evidence, enough evidence that constitutes proof in a court
          of law. Regardless what Phil Klass says, 'he says show me
          the proof?' We show him evidence, and that's not enough.
          [show Klass] Massive evidence, still not enough. That's
          extreme..., stupidity not skepticism."

 <Mickus> "What's Moore's agenda?"

<Fenwick> "I wish I knew."

 <Mickus> "Is his linked to the aliens agenda?"

<Fenwick> "I don't know."

 <Mickus> "But he at this point, knows everything...he's just releasing
          bits and pieces..."

<Fenwick> "Yes...and Harry keeps accusing him of wanting to make money
          out of it. Because...well he's got no other income, actually
          he has to, you can't blame him."

 <Mickus> "Do you think that he [Moore] is pretty fatalistic about
          this whole thing? And he's just in it right now for what
          he can get out of it?"

<Fenwick> "Ask him...I don't know. And Bill doesn't talk. Bill is
          very very sensitive. You can bring up a topic on UFOlogy
          and he'll say, 'Well, I'd rather not talk about it.' He
          wants to make money out of it...thats all there is to it.
          He has kids...a divorced wife, and kids to support and so
          on, so you can't blame him, I would too. Hell, you got no
          other income, you gotta hold back [on the release of info].
          You can't give all the information out, if you are going
          to put it into book form, or a video to sell...or whatever.
          That's the way he's got to do it, I'm sure. Harry is very
          jealous of the fact that Bill is on it full-time, a lot of
          people are I would think. You have to look at it from
          Bill's point of view too, really. There's two ways of
          looking at it. You have to put yourself into the other
          person's place."


 <Mickus> "Well, Thank You very much Larry for this interview."

<Fenwick> "Yes, my pleasure. Hope to see you in three weeks time
          to respond to any questions."

 APPENDIX:
 --------

       The following is a brief recounting of what myself and
       Larry Fenwick spoke about in the initial 45 mins of
       the interview. Approximately one third was taken up
       with an in-depth biography of Larry Fenwick. Everthing
       below will be my [Tom Mickus'] words, which I have to
       the best of my ability re-collected as to the content
       and subject matter of what we discussed.



       [Larry Fenwick is in his early 50'. He has had a long
       involvement with the study of UFOs. Originally he got
       fascinated with the subject in the early 1950's, when
       I believe he read Donald Keyhoe's book on the subject
       entitled something like "Flying Saucers are Real". He
       is of Jewish descent, although I believe he would
       characterize himself as "non-practicing". In his early
       years he had some difficulties in high school, and
       flunked several grades. Later on he took 2 years of
       psychology in University, but did not graduate. In
       the 1960's he attended Ryerson Polytechnical Intstitute
       in Toronto, Ontario, and received a degree in journalism
       shortly thereafter. He later on had several jobs in
       the industry, and journalism led him eventually to his
       role as editor of the CUFORN Bulletin. Like many, it
       was several years before his interest in UFO's grew..
       and eventually he and a few others decided to set an
       incorporated organization called CUFORN (the Canadian
       UFO Research Network). He has been involved with many
       on-site investigations of UFO's since then, and before.
       He has read over 400 books on the subject, and has
       appeared on local television and radio numerable times.
       Through the ebb and flow of interest in UFO's, Larry's
       organization has stayed with it, and today numbers
       around 50 members from across the globe.]

       [In the remaining minutes of the first 45 min tape, we
       discussed the two programs UFO Coverup LIVE, and the
       UNSOLVED MYSTERIES - Gulf Breeze segment. Of particular
       note is that Larry told me that his associate, Harry
       Tokarz, had noticed an unusual buzzing or hum, present
       on the audio throughout the duration of the program.
       Although Larry says that he never noticed it until Harry
       had told him, on subsequent viewing of the videotape,
       Larry agreed that the sound was discernible, and like
       nothing he had ever heard before on a LIVE broadcast. I
       got the distinct impression that he felt that this was
       the EBEs making their presence known, in a method (radio
       interference) not unheard of by UFOlogists.

       We also discussed why the aliens view the human's as a
       "failed experiment".

       When referring to the programming of Hitler by the EBEs,
       which in effect caused World War II (the decisions of one
       man)...Larry also mentioned the one other incident where
       he said that the aliens had manipulated a world leader to
       do their bidding. He cited the fact that John F. Kennedy
       was supposed to bring us to nuclear war, but that he had
       backed down, and as a result the aliens sought "revenge".
       In other words they were wholly or in part, responsible
       for the assassination of JFK. Larry Fenwick gave me a
       name of some person labelled 'the _______ tramp" or vagrant
       or something along that line who was supposed to be
       involved. I plan to get back to Larry to get more specific
       details regarding this sensational allegation. He cited
       the failed Bay of Pigs fiasco as Kennedy's big mistake in
       the eyes of the aliens. JFK was supposed to carry through
       with it, and thus eventually it would provoke nuclear war
       with the Soviets in defense of Cuba. Larry Fenwick said
       that the aliens were not involved with the cause of WW I.

       Fenwick also discussed the role of the Hollywood in
       promoting the "friendly ET image", specifically the role
       of celebrated director, Steven Speilberg. Fenwick said that
       there are two close associates of Speilberg who have been
       encouraging him to produce movies along this line. While
       Speilberg is not "programmed" himself, these other two
       unnamed people apparently attended school with him, and have
       been vigourously suggestive with Speilberg as to what
       directions his movies should be going in. Speilberg is aware
       of this, but has decided to go along. The movies in question
       include of course "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", more
       recently "Batteries Not Included", and of course "E.T. the
       Extraterrestrial"...the most popular movie of all time,
       grossing close to 1,000,000,000 dollars in both movie reciepts
       and in videotape sales. Fenwick has alleged that this
       campaign of showing aliens in a good light, is part of the
       master plan of the EBEs (or aliens), who, for whatever
       ultimate reason, want people to have this benevolent view of
       them.

       That's about it. There was more, but perhaps when my memory
       is refreshed I will be able to recount the rest.]
