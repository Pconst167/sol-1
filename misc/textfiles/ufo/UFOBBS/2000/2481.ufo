             WHAT IS THE PHOENIX PROJECT?

   The Phoenix Project is a private, civilian, research
organization formed in 1952 to investigate and correlate
information concerning Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)
and Extra-Terrestrial (ET) activities. It has no
affiliation with the United States Government or any of
its agencies.  Because of the nature of its work the
Phoenix Project does not seek publicity.

   Staff members are former military personnel who have
all been associated with intelligence activities, and
have knowledge of covert government operations concerning
UFO's. Their knowledge of the specialized field of
"intelligence correlation," provide unique insights into
various subject matter.

   From time-to-time and in the public interest, the
Phoenix Project will publish research reports regarding
certain subjects. A list of reports is available from our
publisher.  All correspondence should be addressed to:

                  THE ULTIMATE SECRET

             A Special Report and Overview
            Prepared by The Phoenix Project
                           
                      OVERVIEW: 

   The Top Secret Operation Majestic-12 was established
by order of President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Operation
Majestic-12, was created to take charge of the technical,
sociological and other aspects of the crashed UFOs and
the small alien occupants, dead or alive, that were
recovered. In later years this operation evolved into and
became known as MAJI (the Majority Agency for Joint
Intelligence). MAGI is the most secret of all
intelligence groups and out-ranks all other intelligence
agencies including the National Security Agency (NSA) and
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). MAJI is
responsible directly and "only" to the President of the
United States.

/ MAJIC / MAJI

   The TOP SECRET / MAJI project control group is
responsible for every aspect of interface with the alien
lifeforms including security and intelligence, and
disinformation to prevent public or foreign disclosure of
the alien presence. (This is why all documents referring
to "MJ-12" or any other form of that name are wrong). 
MAJI is on-going in Washington DC. 

   MAJIC: Is the security classification of all MAJI and
Aquarius information. MAJIC means "MAJI CONTROLLED." 
MAJIC is the highest security classification in the
nation.

   MJ-1: DIRECTOR OF MAJI.  The Director of the CIA is
usually MJ-1 and reports only to the President.  Other
members of MAJI are designated MJ-2, MJ-3, MJ-4, etc. 
This is the reason MJ-12 cannot be used as a name for the
control group as it would cause confusion in meaning,
i.e., (Is it referring to MJ-12 the person or MJ-12 the
group.)  Any reference to MJ-12 is to a person and
nothing else. References and documents referring to
"MJ-12" as a "Group" are incorrect.

   MAJI, originally was known as Majestic-12, a group
consisting of twelve members. This group was made up of
a team representing selected government officials, U.S.
intelligence personnel, highly trained scientists,
business executives and military personnel. All were
sworn to total secrecy. MAJI has continued its covert
activities with the knowledge and consent of the last
eight Presidents. (See Exhibit 1, part of the briefing
papers for president-elect Eisenhower.)

   The group continues to function today and has had the
responsibility of establishing an ongoing relationship
dating from 1964, with UFO beings (the Greys) from the
third planet of the star system Zeta Reticuli.

   Information forwarded to and the activity of MAJI has
always been assigned an Above "Top Secret
classification," known as MAJIC. MAJI, to conceal its
existence, adopted the cover name of "Majestic-12." It
created numerous covert and compartmented sub-divisions
such as Projects Aquarius, Sigma, Snowbird and Garnet, to
name a few. These projects were sheltered by MAJI and
directed by select personnel of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). 

   By secret Executive Memorandum NSC 5410, Eisenhower
had preceded NSC 5412/1 in 1954 to establish a permanent
committee to be known as Majority Twelve to oversee and
conduct all covert activities concerned with the alien
question. NSC 5412/1 was created to explain the purpose
of these meetings when Congress and the news media became
curious. Majority Twelve was made up of Nelson
Rockefeller, the director of the CIA Allen Welsh Dulles,
the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the Secretary
of Defense Charles E. Wilson, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Director
of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover, and six men from the
executive committee of the Council on Foreign Relations
known as the "Wise Men." These men were all members of a
secret society of scholars that called themselves "The
Jason Society," or "The Jason Scholars" who recruited
their members from the "Skull and Bones" and the "Scroll
and Key" societies of Harvard and Yale.  

   The "Wise Men" were key members of the Council on
Foreign Relations. There were twelve members including
the first six from Government positions thus Majority
Twelve. This group was made up over the years of the top
officers and directors of the Council on Foreign
Relations and later the Trilateral Commission. Gordon
Dean, George Bush, and Zbigniew Brzezinski were among
them. The most important and influential of the "Wise
Men" who served on Majestic-12 were John McCloy, Robert
Lovett, Averell Harriman, Charles Bohlen, George Kennan,
and Dean Acheson. It is significant that President
Eisenhower as well as the first six Majestic-12 members
from the Government were also members of the Council on
Foreign Relations. However, not all the "Wise Men"
attended Harvard or Yale and not all of them were chosen
from the "Skull and Bones" or "Scroll and Key" membership
during their college years. [{Research indicates that
various members were chosen on an ongoing basis.
