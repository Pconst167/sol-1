        from his book "A Breakthrough to New Free Energy Sources".

         We of  VANGARD  SCIENCES  wish  to publicly thank Dan for his
     willingness to share the result of his researches on John Keely.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    John W. Keely, discoverer of Sympathetic  Vibratory Physics, found
    a means of negating the effect of gravity as well  as developing a
    form of propulsion.

    From 1888 to  1893,  Keely  worked  on  developing  his  system of
    "Aerial Navigation".   The first successful test was in 1893 which
    led the way to the construction of an aerial craft.

    In 1896, Mr. Keely had so perfected his system that he arranged to
    give a demonstration of the aerial  craft to the United States War
    Department.  In attendance at the demonstration were  a  number of
    invited members of the press.

    Descriptions of the  craft  state  that it was a circular platform
    roughly 6 feet in diameter.  On this  platform was mounted a small
    stool set before a keyboard.

    The keyboard was attached to numerous tuned resonation  plates and
    vibratory mechanisms.

    Mr. Keely explained  that  these  plates  would cause the craft to
    rise and float above the ground  when  subjected  to  a  polarized
    field which would generate a "negative attraction".

    When the effect  was  produced,  the craft would  come  under  the
    influence of the "etheric polar current."

    The controlling  mechanism  consisted  of a row of 100 vibratory
    bars representing the enharmonic and diatonic scales.

    When half of  the  bars  were  damped  the craft would move at 500
    miles per hour.

    If all the bars were damped, gravity  would resume control and the
    craft would settle to the earth.

    There were no moving parts in the ship's propelling mechanism.

    It was unaffected by weather and could rise above any storm.

    The instrument for  guiding  the airship was distinctly  different
    from the propelling feature.

    By damping out  certain  specific  notes,  Keely  could  cause the
    airship to accelerate to any desired speed.

    The experiment was carried out in  an  open  field  with observers
    from the War Department and the news media.

    The ship was said to have accelerated from 0 to 500 miles per hour
    within a few seconds.

    Most astounding was  the  apparent  total  lack  of   acceleration
    effects to Mr.  Keely  as he sat on the stool before the keyboard,
    controlling the airship.

    Although, the government officials  were  impressed,  they  stated
    they could see no use for such a complex device  and  so  did  not
    pursue the matter further.

    (Remember, the Wright  brothers did not demonstrate their airplane
     at Kittyhawk, N.C., until December 17, 1903--7 years later!)
