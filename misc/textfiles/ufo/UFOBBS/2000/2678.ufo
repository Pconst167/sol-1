    CAUS  was  created in 1978  to battle what we perceive  as  unjustified 
    government   secrecy  in  relation  to  UFO's.    Through  Freedom   of 
    Information  Act requests and several court cases,  which at one  point 
    reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1980 (CAUS vs.  NSA), 
    we have obtained approximately 5,800  pages of files on UFO's from many 
    Federal agencies,  FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA,  USAF-OSI,  Department of State, 
    Navy and Army Intelligence. 

    Some  of these were published in our newsletter,  "JUST CAUSE",   which 
    appeared between May 1978  and January 1982.   The newsletter has  been 
    inactive for almost three years but it is now being revived as a result 
    of extraordinary interest generated by the book, "CLEAR INTENT". 

    For  the  time  being,   JUST CAUSE new series will appear  soon  as  a 
    quarterly newsletter of at least four pages, double-column with interim 
    bulletins  as stories develop.   Subscriptions will be $10.00  per year 
    ($15.00 foreign subscriptions). 

    Most  of  the subscription cost will be used to fund FOIA  requests  to 
    government agencies,  pay search and reproduction fees incurred in such 
    requests  and aid in financing court costs for  especially  interesting 
    information on UFO's. 

    Without  the help of concerned persons,  like yourself,  CAUS cannot do 
    the work it has to do to get to the bottom of the UFO mystery.    There 
    is strength in numbers so let our united voices be heard!
