                           Abstract

     NASA's unmanned Viking mission in 1976 returned images of a 
set of highly controversial, anthropomorphic and geometric 
objects located in the Cydonia Mensae region of the planet Mars. 
These objects for 13 years have been derisively dismissed as 
irrelevant to SETI -- the Search for Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence -- mainly, it is argued, because NASA's on-going 
SETI Program has systematically ignored the potential for ET-
generated physical evidence within the confines of the solar 
system; interstellar radio searches of the electromagnetic 
spectrum are currently the exclusive SETI focus.  Recent work, 
however, now reveals a set of strikingly ^Rspecific and repeating
mathematical constants^R, derived from redundant geometric 
spacing and alignments between five geomorphologically diverse 
objects -- including a direct mathematical connection with the 
siting latitude of the objects on the planet.  It is argued that 
this new evidence presents robust support for the "intelligence 
hypothesis" as an increasingly likely explantion of these 
enigmatic landforms.  The only potential natural process capable 
of producing such specific mathematical relationships -- 
crystallization -- is reviewed and dismissed for a variety of 
reasons, ranging from scale factors, to the extreme morphological
diversity of the mathematically connected objects, to the absence
of known surface constituants capable of forming such 
crystallization patterns.  Even an unknown "local crystallization
phenomenon," it is pointed out, could have no plausible 
connection with the specific latitude of the objects on the 
planet -- the strongest single observation in favor of an 
"intelligence hypothesis."  Comparison is inescapable: between 
the potential geometric "signal" strongly suggested by these new 
observations at Cydonia, and proposals made by several well-known
investigators of the last century for similar patterns to be 
impressed upon terrestrial signals to hypothetical 
extraterrestrial observers -- proposals that included the 
construction of giant geometric figures here on Earth.  

Acceptance of these observations is not equivalent to acceptance 
of the potential existence of "Martians"; recent discussions of 
the feasibility of sub-light interstellar exploration make clear 
that, while previous visits to the solar system by advanced 
technical societies is difficult, it is not precluded by the 
parameters of current physics.  In conclusion, therefore, it is 
argued that these new observations mandate a general 
reexamination of the existing SETI paradigm regarding ET 
artifacts, even as they urgently suggest the need for an 
acceleration of the effort to secure new Cydonia imagery from 
Mars Observer.
