Hello all,

Here is a UFO document index provided by none other than good ol' Uncle
Sam.
The pilot internet ftp access program was started a few months ago. The ftp
site is called seq1.loc.gov via anonymous ftp. There are plenty of other
interesting stuff on this thing as well. Plus there is a form you can fill
out to request SPECIFIC information to be put on the server. I say we on
a.a.v. should take full advantage of this. This could be a great oppotunity
to get some decent information readily. Let them know we are interested.
Here it is...enjoy.

        comprehensive bibliography, this guide is designed--as the
