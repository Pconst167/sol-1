    Desc.   : Official report from the Sacramento UFO SIG on K2 
            
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------


      The Sacramento UFO SIG (Special Interest Group)  is a small group  of 
    individuals who have keen interest in expanding their knowledge on this 
    subject.   We  have been meeting officially for one year  and  numerous 
    members  of this group have had significant encounters.  Like  most  of 
    you, we have a keen interesting in the Who, What and especially the Why 
    on this subject. 
     
      The SIG has made four trips up to K2 during the last 3 weeks,  and at 
    this  point,  to be frank,  we have come up empty handed.  This is  not 
    saying  that there is nothing up there,  but we are not seeing evidence 
    of anything at this time. Due to the fact that there have been a flurry 
    of sightings occurring approximately 75 miles to the south of K2 (Pilot 
    Peak),   both ourselves and apparently several MUFON members are of the 
    opinion that the Greys may have moved their operations to the south. 
     
      We have made the following observations. 
     
      1. The  area,  although remote,  is somewhat heavily traveled by  the 
         locals.  This, we feel,  is the reason for the very smooth surface 
         of the road. Road traffic is light,  if not nonexistent,  at night 
         (usually  between  about  9:00PM and around 4:00AM when the  local 
         loggers  start  coming  through from Quincy to go to work  at  the 
         logging  sites).  There seems  to  be extensive logging  going  on 
         between the mountain and the junction of the Quincy-  LaPorte Road 
         and the road that goes up to Little  Grass Valley Lake.  It is our 
         opinion  that the reason that the road is paved from the  base  of 
         the mountain, up and through the valley below  the peak itself and 
         to the top of the rise that over looks the Feather  River  canyon, 
         is  the possibility of eliminating washouts,  especially along the 
         face of the hill just below the valley entrance. 
     
      2. The valley itself, which contains the Onion Valley creek,  is not, 
         in  my  opinion,  anything unusual for the Sierras.  The place  is 
         teeming with life,  including bear,  deer, owls, squirrels, birds, 
         frogs and in the evening, loads of bats (which swarm down from the 
         mountain).  Two of the  people  who went up to the mountain  (John 
         Pickens and Ed Stewart) went  up to the lookout and they said that 
         there was a lot of evidence of  extensive rat population up there. 
         I  have personally walked over approximately 75%  of  that  valley 
         floor and about 25% of the slope to the south (which is just below 
         the  face of the mountain.  I  have found very little evidence  of 
         anything out of the ordinary, especially cave or  cavern openings. 
         In  fact,  I  found little if any indication that anyone had  been 
         walking up there within recent weeks. 
     
         The pond is made from a small man-made dam, which appears to be at 
         least 20  years old.  I  can see the distinct possibility that the 
         forest service made it to create a water source in case of  fires. 
         I did see the  area that the report mentions regarding the  washed 
         out part of the dam.  The pond is,  according to a man that one of 
         our party interviewed,  fish-less.  It does, however, have several 
         resident ducks, which make a considerable amount  of  noise during 
         the night.  The bats feed extensively on the insects that populate 
         the  pond and they are somewhat aggressive.  You can toss a  small 
         stone  up in the air and the bats will go after it.  John  Pickens 
         showed us that little trick. 
     
      3. We were only approached once by a local sheriff, who simply wanted 
         to know what we were doing sitting by the side of the road late at 
         night. This was just after he had left the campground which held a 
         large  group  of  local indians,  who were camping  there.   These 
         indians  were  very much aware of our presence and no  doubt  were 
         concerned about us. Since the mountains of California are known to 
         have  drug  farmers,  it  is prudent to maintain  one's  distance. 
         Mountain folks are a quiet bunch and usually have little to say to 
         "flat  landers."  We only saw US Forest  Service  Ranters  driving 
         their trucks on the road and we were never approached about why we 
         were in the area. 
     
      4. Pilot Peak (K2) is indeed in a fairly remote area, which given the 
         patterns  of  life of the area,  could be an ideal spot  for  some 
         surreptitious activity.  Logistical it is in a very good location, 
         considering  the  local  terrain,  it's relationship to  areas  in 
         Northern  California and Nevada and it's relative ease of  access. 
         If  I were going to  build  a secret base in Northern  California, 
         this area would be ideal.   The roads leading to the site from the 
         south  are  paved up to within 10  miles of the mountain  and  the 
         loggers and the locals, use it extensively from 4:00AM until about 
         9:00PM.  As I have mentioned above from  9:00PM until 4:00AM,  the 
         road is deserted and the place is very quiet. 
     
         The  area  to  the west of the mouth of the U-shaped  valley  just 
         below the peak goes  into a long narrow canyon,  which the Phoenix 
         group  describes  in their report.  I  can see that this could  be 
         utilized to gain access below radar. 
     
      5. The  marshes behind and in front of the pond have  tall  rice-like 
         grass and there are areas that appear to have been flattened,  but 
         not in the classic crop-circle sense. The pattern of the flattened 
         grass is  uni-directional and  it does appear to have been  folded 
         over  and  braided,   but there is no defined shape to  the  areas 
         themselves. There are approximately 10 of these sites either below 
         the dam or behind it and they all have signs of foot traffic going 
         into them. The grass in these  areas show signs of browning and do 
         not show any of the signs of burning (either shaded or tip-burning 
         as  mentioned in the crop circle evidence).  I  walked the  entire 
         area of both marshes and saw no signs of circular burn marks. 
     
      6. Regarding  the comments that the Phoenix Group has made about  the 
         feelings  that their team has regarding being watched,  there were 
         two  separate  incidents that occurred while we were up there that 
         gives me pause to reflect. 
     
         The  first  of these events occurred when my son and  I originally 
         went to the mountain three weeks ago.  At the time,  I  didn't see 
         the significance of it, but I do now. It was dusk and my son and I 
         had  set up  my tripod and camera on the dam looking  towards  the 
         peak.  It was somewhat  of a moonlight night and the bats had just 
         come  out.   It was approximately 9:30PM on Saturday,  the 8th  of 
         August.   Suddenly I heard what appeared to be the sounds of  bear 
         cubs. I immediately recognized the  sounds,  having spend years in 
         the woods.  Instantly, I had the uneasy  feeling  that mother bear 
         might be close and I told my son to take the  tripod and we should 
         quietly go back to the car.  Since we hadn't  intended to stay the 
         night,  we decided to leave the area. The location of these noises 
         were  approximately 150  feet up the side of the mountain  to  the 
         South-South West of the southern tip of the dam. 
     
         On the evening of Wednesday, the 12th I went up to the mountain by 
         myself  and  spent the night parked by the side of the  main  road 
         which is slightly above the valley floor and has an excellent view 
         of the entire valley. The only significant noise that I heard that 
         night was from a very loud owl, who hooted from the very same area 
         that the bear noises emminate from. 
     
         On Saturday,  the 15th,  myself and Ed Stewart spent the afternoon 
         and early evening up at K2.  I  walked up the side of the hill  to 
         the  south,   southeast  of  the pond with Ed and we set  up  some 
         listening equipment (sensitive mikes,  including one contact mike, 
         which I set up on some solid granite).  Suddenly,  Ed said,  "What 
         was that???",  motioning over into  the  same area of the hillside 
         that I have previously mentioned with the owl and bear sounds.  It 
         gave me a very short term feeling of uneasiness, but it pasted. At 
         that  point I was under the impression that  we were sitting  over 
         the  area that was supposed to have the base entrance.  Later,   I 
         found out that I was wrong. 
     
         Last night, on the evening of August 22nd, I spoke to Jack Mathias 
         on the phone. I  essentially told him what I have transcribed here 
         with  the exception of the strange noises and their locations.   I 
         told him that we had been looking for the base entrances and  were 
         having trouble finding them.  It was then that he told me that the 
         main  one was to the south-  southwest of the southern tip of  the 
         dam, approximately 150-165 feet up the  side  of the hill and that 
         apparently  I  had  been looking at the  wrong  place  all  along. 
         Whether the locations of the noises that myself, Ed Stewart and my 
         son  Kris  have heard are in fact located nearer to  the  supposed 
         entrance  is  still  an open question.  If so,  the there  is  the 
         possibility that someone may have been trying to warn us away,  by 
         playing mind games with us. I didn't think of it at the time,  but 
         this  reminds  me  of  the types of things that  Whitley  Streiber 
         experienced. HUMMMM!!???? 
     
      In conclusion,  we still have some unanswered questions regarding the 
    K2  site.  We do question some of the allegations of the Phoenix Group, 
    but  haven't closed the book yet.  There is still the possibility  that 
    there  is something going on up there,  but we feel that the burden  of 
    proof is on the Phoenix Group.  The data that they have listed in their 
    report  is  outlined with some inconsistencies.  The grid  pattern  for 
    their  magnetometer  readings  is  devoid of  X,Y  co-ordinate  markers 
    corresponding  to their readings.  The maps of the area that they  have 
    listed in the report doesn't have marked on it the origin (0,0)   point 
    for the X,Y grid. For a scientific report, this is a very sizeable data 
    error. 
     
      We  also have some problem with their conclusions regarding the  road 
    and it's usage,  the quizzical nature of the rangers,  the lack of life 
    around the area and in particular the LZ sites that they mention. I can 
    see that the place would make an excellent site for a secret base,  but 
    it's existence is still questionable. We have, as I have mentioned, not 
    closed the book on this case, and will keep everyone posted. 
     
      I  would  like  to take this opportunity to give thanks to  the  very 
    helpful  efforts and support from Ed Stewart,  John Pickens and my  son 
    Kristopher  Jones.   I  have found that when it comes down to making  a 
    commitment to field research, there are often few, if any volunteers. I 
    greatly appreciate those who participated. Thanks. 
     
      Sincerely- Steve Jones, co-moderator of the Sacramento UFO SIG.
