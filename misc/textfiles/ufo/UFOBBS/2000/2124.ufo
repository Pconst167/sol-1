               ANCIENT WRITINGS TELL OF UFO VISIT IN 4,000 B.C.

 Japan, according to Dr.V.Raghavan, retired head of the Sanskrit department of
India`s perstigious University of Madras, was alone in playing host to
extraterrestrials in prehistory. Dr. Raghavan contends that centuries-old
documents in Sanskrit (the classical language of India and Hinduism) prove 
that aliens from outer space visited his nation.

 "Fifty years of researching this ancient works convinces me that there are
livings beings on other planets, and that they visited earth as far back as
4,000 B.C., "  The scholar says.  "There`s just a mass of fascinating 
information about flying machines, even fantastic science fiction weapons,
that can be found in translations of the Vedas (scriptures), Indian epics,
and other ancient Sanskrit text. 

 "n the mahabharata (writings), there isntion of devine lighting and ray
weapons, even a kind of hypnotic weapon. And in the ramayana (writings), 
there is a description of Vimanas, or flying machines, that navigated at 
great heights with the aid of quicksilver and a great propulsive wind. 

 "These were space vehicles similar to the so-called flying saucers reported
throughout the world today. The Ramayana even describes a beautifl areal
chariot which 'arrived shining, a wonderful divine car that sped through the
air'. In another passage, there is mention of a chariot being seen 'sailing
overhead like a moon.' 

 "The references in the Mahabharata are no less astounding: `At Rama`s behest,
the magnificant chariot rose up to a mountain of cloud with a tremendous din.`
Another passage reads: `Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which
was as brilliant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a storm."

 In the ancient Vymanka-Shastra (science of aeronautics), there is a 
description of a Vimana: "An apparatus which can go by its own force, from
lace to place or globe to glode." Dr. Raghavan points out, "The text`s 
revelations become even more astounding. Thirty-one parts-of which the machine
consists-are described, including a photographing mirror underneath. The text
also enumerates 16 kinds of metal that are needed to construct the flying
vehicle: `Metals suitable, lighare 16 kinds. `But only
three of them are known to us today. The rest remain untranslatable."

 Another authority who agrees with Dr. Raghavan`s interpretations is Dr.A.V.
Krishna Murty, professor of aeronautics at the Indain Institute of Science in
Bangalore. "It is true," Dr.Krishna Murty says, "that the ancient Indian
Vedas and other text refer to aeronautics, spaceships, flying machines, and
even astronauts.

 "A study of the Sanskrit texts has convinced me that ancient India did know 
the secret of building flying machines-and that those machines were patterned
after spaceships coming from other planets."
