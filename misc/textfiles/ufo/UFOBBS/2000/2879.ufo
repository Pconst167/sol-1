 I would like to present this extract from "On Shores of Endless
 Worlds" by Andrew Tomas for those that have not read it.

  "One of the Vedic hymns, dedicated to Varuna, intimates that
  there had existed some sort of galactic police in Space:

    'Whoever beyond the sky should think his way to wing,
     He could not elude the grasp of Varuna, theking,
     His agents descending from the skies glide all this
     world around,
     Their thousand eyes all-scanning sweep to Earth's
     remotest bound.'

  Reading this verse, it would seem that the ancients were aware
  of the same sort of reconnaissance as those of today's contro-
  versial UFOs."  page 121

 Think about it!
