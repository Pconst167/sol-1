    The Underwater Civilization Theory 
     
    Reports of unknown objects entering or leaving large bodies of water or 
    proceeding through them have been made from time to time and have  been 
    labeled unidentified submarine objects (USOs).  Numerous theorists have 
    consequently  speculated that secret UFO bases might be located on  the 
    ocean beds, far from man's activities and possible detection. By moving 
    underwater,   UFOs  would  have access to  all  continents,   and,   by 
    proceeding  up major rivers and tribituaries,  could reach many  inland 
    locations without risking detection by atmospheric flight. 
     
    Vehicles  capable  of  interstellar  flight,  some  proponents  of  the 
    extraterrestial  hypothesis  point  out,  would certainly  be  able  to 
    withstand the pressures and stresses of deep oceanic environments. This 
    point  has  some validity,  and it can also be stated that some of  the 
    most  remote areas of the planet are located in parts of  the  southern 
    Pacific  and Indian oceans,  providing easy access from the  atmosphere 
    with minimum chance of visual or electronic detection. 
     
    At  the same time,  it could be asked why the UFO operators go to  such 
    lengths  to  remain  unobserved,  only to  display  their  vehicles  so 
    blatently in such populated areas as the U.S. and Europe. 
     
    One  of  the proponents of the Underwater Civilization Theory  was  the 
    late  naturalist,  Ivan T.  Sanderson,  who proposed not only  that  an 
    extraterrestial civilization could be using the ocean depths,  but that 
    a  native civilization,  one having evolved underwater long before man, 
    could also be doing so.  He concluded,  in fact,  that "it is much more 
    likely that both suggestions apply." Although he provided no sources or 
    references,   Sanderson  stated that more than 50  percent of  all  UFO 
    reports concerned objects over, coming from,  or going toward (or into) 
    bodies of water. 
     
    Related to the "Underwater Civilization"  idea for UFOs is the  popular 
    explanation for the disappearances of ships and planes in the so-called 
    Bermuda Triangle. 
     
    During the past thirty years, more than 100  ships and planes with more 
    than  1,000   persons on board have supposedly disappeared -  some  say 
    "mysteriously,   without a trace"  -  in an area variously dubbed  "The 
    Bermuda  Triangle,"  "The Devil's Triangle,"  "The Hoodoo  Sea,"   "The 
    Triangle of Death," and "The Graveyard of the Atlantic." It is actually 
    a  large  area of undefinable shape around and including  the  triangle 
    formed by Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico,  where sea and air traffic 
    is  said  to be the greatest.  For reasons which are to  follow,   some 
    writers  have  "theorized"  a  UFO connection to explain the  "strange" 
    disappearances. 
     
    The  Bermuda  Triangle-UFO link to missing vessels  was  perhaps  first 
    hinted  at  in  the 1930s by Charles Fort (1874-1932),   who,   as  his 
    biographer Loren Gross writes:  "played with the notion that mysterious 
    vanishments  of  ocean vessels and their crews...may be due  to  wanton 
    seizures by spacemen."  Two decades later, astronomer Morris K.  Jessup 
    (1900-1959),  in his book, The Case for the UFO, wrote:  "To attempt to 
    postulate motive for space inhabitants kidnapping crews from  ships..is 
    in the realm of pure speculation. On the other hand...our space friends 
    would want to know what has happened to us since they left, or what has 
    happened to us since they put us down here.  Again, there is always the 
    possibility that the open seas provide an easy catching place." 
     
    More recently, author Charles Berlitz capitalized on the triangle and a 
    possible  UFO  connection  by quoting in his  best-selling  book,   The 
    Bermuda Triangle, his friend, J. Manson Valentine, who reported several 
    UFO sightings in the area.  Berlitz also quoted a reporter by the  name 
    of Art Ford,  who claimed that a final radio transmission, picked up by 
    a ham operator from one of the doomed pilots (in this case,  Lieutenant 
    Charles  Taylor,  flight leader of the five Navy torpedo  bombers  that 
    disappeared on December 5,  1945),  contained the warning:  "Don't come 
    after me...they look like they are from outer space."  But according to 
    a  transcript from the Navy Inquiry Board,  what Taylor  actually  said 
    was"  :I know where I am now.  I'm at twenty-three hundred feet.  Don't 
    come after me." 
     
    Also,  there are claims of unusual electromagnetic effects occurring in 
    the triangle,  a common feature of many UFO reports. Actually,  none of 
    the  "magnetic  anomalies"   reported in the area appear  to  be  true. 
    Reports   of   compass  needles  spinning  crazily  have   never   been 
    substantiated.  The fact that the compass points to true north from the 
    triangle does not cause confusion,  but rather,  simplifies navigation. 
    The  compass points to true north from many other places in the  world. 
    The  only part of the triangle from which it does point directly  north 
    is  at  the southern tip of Florida.  Those who claim that  the  north-
    pointing compass is strange or confusing lack even the most fundamental 
    knowledge of magnetism,  compasses,  or navigation.  The presence of  a 
    "space\time warp" (whatever that means) is, again, unsubstantiated. 
     
    Popular  author John Wallace Spencer in a revised version of his  book, 
    Limbo  of  the Lost,  offered a provocative theory.  He reasoned  that: 
    "Since  a 575-foot vessel with 39  crew member disappearing  50   miles 
    offshore in the Gulf of Mexico,  and commercial airliners  disappearing 
    while  coming  in  for  a landing cannot happen  according  to  earthly 
    standards and yet are happening, I  am forced to conclude that they are 
    actually being taken away from our planet for a variety of reasons." 
     
    In  a  1975  version of the book,  retitled Limbo of the Lost -  Today, 
    Spencer  modified his UFO theory so that the extraterrestials  were  no 
    longer  carting  the captives away from Earth but were taking  them  to 
    hidden  underwater facilities,  where the ETs conducted experiments  on 
    the  earthlings  and  their machinery.  However,   Spencer  offered  no 
    evidence that UFOs had been present or were even sighted in conjunction 
    with any of the incidents he described.  Consequently,  many think that 
    these  authors,   in  order  to attempt to make a  bigger  story,   are 
    "dressing up" their accounts by including UFOs. 
     
    The  UFO-capture theme was again used in the movie Close Encounters  of 
    the Third Kind:  The five Navy torpedo bombers that disappeared in 1945 
    had  been taken aboard a gigantic "mother ship";  all of  its  captives 
    (unaged  over  the  years)  were released at the end of  the  movie  to 
    demonstrate that the extraterrestials are friendly after all. 
     
    In reality, the "Bermuda Triangle Mystery"  has been shown to be a sham 
    -an accumalation of careless research,  misconceptions, sensationalism, 
    and  downright  falsification  of data - and is  so  regarded  by  most 
    leading  UFO researchers.  For example,  the 575-foot ship that Spencer 
    claimed  had disappeared was found within two weeks,  sunken in shallow 
    water.   Volatile fumes in the holds had exploded,  nearly tearing  the 
    ship in two.  The airliner that Spencer said had disappeared while on a 
    landing  approach was a chartered DC-3  that lost its way at  night  in 
    1948,   out of sight of land,  because of radio navigational  problems. 
    Thorough  investigations of other incidents by Larry Kusche (author  of 
    The  Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved)  led to similiar  down-to-earth 
    explanations. 
     
    According to the April 1978 issue of J. Allen Hynek's International UFO 
    Reporter: "the Bermuda Triangle stories...are NOT relayed by the pilots 
    or  sailors  who  experience them;  they are  the  fraudulent  literary 
    distortions  of a small handful of authors.  All triangle mysteries  so 
    far  have been examined.  Would that the more baffling UFOs (which  are 
    themselves the mysteries) were so easily resolved."
