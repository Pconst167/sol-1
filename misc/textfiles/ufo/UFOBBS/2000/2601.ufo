                         UFO SIGHTING  3-5-94

    At home of Angie & John, Angie is my mom. On Saturday 5, 1994, evening.
  at 10:30 pm a loud sound was heard on the amateur radio,computer and
  scanner a high pitch squeal. I was listing to a UFO net on 80
   Meters on the freq. of 3977.8 Khz. The object then struck my
  amateur antenna and then an oak tree in the back yard. There was
  a very bright light, the light was lit all the time it was in my
  vicinity the light was whiter then snow and it seem to be brighter
  then the sun.I know this for a fact because I had a one million
  candle power light on my boat. The object was moving from East to
   West after hitting the tree it headed Southwest. The house lights
  were blinking on and off thenit sounded like a earthquake just
  hit. But there was no quake. It shook the my house an everbody's
  house in the neighborhood. I called the (911) and reported a quake.
   The police came in about less then 2 minutes for Newark that's
  very fast, the police, fire, and emergency medical came with the
  fire truck a Civil Defence person was on the truck, I ask one of
  the firemen what was the C.D. doing with them, he said that they
  were with the fire company until 9:00 pm that there were people
  calling to report UFO sightings scents 9 o'clock to night. On the
  amateur radio friends of mine were telling me to try to do a test
  on my coax cable with a compass so I did, I put the compass near
  the cableand the compass needle moved, then I moved the cable
  around the compass the needle moved. I can not understand how
  copper wirecan be magnetized. I was on 10 Meters after sighting
  discussing itwith them when one of my friends his name is Tom his
  calls are WQ2O by the way mine are N2IXW any way he lives in
  manhattan in a 36 floor apartment.
     Tom was looking from his balcony on the 28th floor with his
  binoculars looking to the West and seen 5 or 6 fighter jets
  leaving Newark Airport. Tom also said from were he was he can see
  a dozen or more helicopters were flying towards the northwest in
  my direction. I seen them about 3 am Sunday 7, morning. I seen 3 black
  helicopters very near my home they look all black with no lights
  visible. I also seen the jets at about a half an hour  after Tom
  saw them leave the airport.I saw 5 jets going in five different
  directions. on the scanner on the air frequency there was nothing
  no one talking from 9:00 pm to 3:00 am. One of the hams call a
  friend up who was a air traffic controller at Kennedy air port he
  said everything was grounded. But he did not say why. He was
  afraid for his job. I also got a piece of wood or branch from the
  yard and was looking at it just a few minutes ago, and it looks
  burnt at little nodes on the branch, but the bark is burnt at all.
  what kind of heat could do that. I Just found out from my nephew
  who is in the air force that there are no Air Force Jets at Newark
   Airport he said they came from an aircraft carrier somewhere near
   New York. I do not know where they came from I just know that
  after the sighting they were over head, as were the black
  helicopters. Tom seen a couple of Jets flying North over the Hudson 
  river a few feet off the water. If anyone has info about Saturday 
  night March 5, 1994 at the time of the sighting which was at 10:30 pm
