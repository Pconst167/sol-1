    Early  1960's...Frank  Scully  dies.  (Author  of  "Behind  the  Flying 
    Saucers".)                               

    Aug.   13,  1960..Red Bluff,  CA:  CHP Officers Charles A.  Carson  and 
    Stanley Scott were on patrol when they sighted what they thought was an 
    airliner about to crash. When the UFO had descended to about 100 or 200 
    feet  altitude  it suddenly reversed direction and climbed to 500   ft. 
    Description: round or oblong surrounded by a glow (color not mentioned) 
    and having definite red lights at each end. They continued to watch the 
    UFO  as  it  performed "unbelievable"  aerial feats.  The  local  RADAR 
    operator  confirmed  the UFO at this time but denied it the  next  day. 
    Other  Tehema County Sheriffs'  officers also saw this UFO and  another 
    similar one that same night. (NICAP, 1964)                        
                                                                      
    May,  1961......In the May issue of "Fate" magazine,  Master Sgt.  O.D. 
    Hill  admits that we are still loosing Air Force planes to  UFOs.   The 
    first case was an F-86  jet fighter that was sent aloft to  investigate 
    an  UFO  that had been plotted on the Radar scope of an Air Base  (name 
    and  dates  classified).   The  Radar Operator spied  the  UFO  heading 
    straight for the craft.  The operator radioed for the F-86  to climb at 
    once, but it was too late.  The two blips merged as one and the UFO was 
    tracked moving away.  Classified as "mysterious"  not a single shred of 
    the F-86  was ever found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89  with crew of 
    two merged with an UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe)            
                                                                      
    Second Case:  A  radar operator was tracking a transport plane carrying 
    26  persons aboard when, suddenly,  another blip appeared on the screen 
    closing  at 2500  mph on the transport.  Before the operator could warn 
    the  transport  the two blips emerged as one.  The remaining blip  sped 
    straight  up  at tremendous speed.  A  surface search in  the  vicinity 
    revealed no oil slicks on the water, although a Generals' briefcase was 
    found floating around. (see 4/1/59;9/29/59)                       
                                                                      
    1961-1963......Near Nellis AFB, NE: "Mat", a radio maintenance engineer
    at  Nevada's  AEC between 1961-1963,  provided evidence  to  the  MUFON
    Journal  that  Project REDLIGHT was secretly being conducted at  nearby
    "Area 51",  a  50-mile-square quadrant of land east of Nellis AFB. This
    Project "involved flight-testing of an UFO which had been shipped there
    from Edwards AFB."  The craft flew silently, was about 20 to 30 ft.  in
    diam., and had no wings or tail.                                  
                                                                      
    Apr.   ,1962.....Flight  Commander P.J.  (initials),  attached  to  TAC
    Fighter Wing was deployed at Wright-Patterson AFB and mistakenly  broke
    into an air hanger where he  thought the gym was located. Upon entering
    the hanger he was approached by an air police sentry with a sub-machine
    gun.  Behind the sentry was a saucer approx. 12-15 ft. diam.  suspended
    off the  ground  by  two  engine test stands. There were no markings or
    insignia on the saucer. It had no rivet markings. The saucer was roped-
    off and 8 guards stood at parade rest around it.  P.J.  and his  friend
    were encouraged to leave the hanger.  P.J. returned to MyrtleBeach AFB,
    S.C.                                                              
                                                                      
    July   17,   1963..A  passenger  of  a  Convair-880   related  to   UFO
    investigator,   James Moseley,  that the 4 engined jet airliner she had
    been flying in was pursued by an UFO.  The jet , traveling at 600  mph,
    made  a  sharp  turn to avoid the UFO,  now rapidly closing in  on  the
    plane.   Just as they were about to collide,  the UFO swerved  away  at
    fantastic speed and  disappeared  in  the night sky. When the (unnamed)
    woman  confronted the pilot about the incident,  he said,  "I  wouldn't
    dare  risk telling the airline of the incident.  If I could tell you of
    some of the experiences my buddies have had, you'd never fly again!" 
                                                                      
    Apr.   15,   1964..USAF  Intelligence officer meets with  2  Aliens  at
    prearranged  location  in  the desert of  New  Mexico.   Project  SIGMA
    operates at AFB, New Mexico. (see 1959)                           
                                                                      
    Oct.,  1964.....Air Force and Army radar stations tracked an UFO as  it
    hovered  over  and flew along the demilitarized zone between North  and
    South Korea. The UFO was visible for over an hour.

    Dec. 19, 1964..MEMO to Chief, Contact Division: NICAP case #(censured):
    Subject:   UFOs over Patuxent Navel Air Station between 1500  and  1530
    hours. Two UFOs approached Air Base at 3800 mph. Another UFO approached
    at 6000  mph.  Radar operator, Chief Pinkerton had visual on Radar.  US
    Coast Guard had "visual"  on the UFOs. OFFICIAL statement to press: the
    (single) blip was caused by faulty radar equipment! (see 1/25/65) 
                                                                      
    Jan. 25, 1965..MEMO to Chief, Contact Division: NICAP Case #(censured).
    (see 12/19/64)                                                    
                                                                      
    1965...........While  visiting the Air Force Museum in Fairborn,  Ohio,
    R.M.   (initials),  a  government employee of 23  yrs.,  went through a
    double- door marked "Off Limits" and suddenly came face to face with an
    Alien in a self contained space suite.  Description: About 4.5 ft. tall
    with a translucent dome over its' large head;  wasn't human; large eyes
    under  a heavy brow;  no noticeable nose;  a  slit for a mouth;  bluish
    skin.  When the creature walked it didn't bend its' knees.  R.M.  later
    found  out  from a retired Air Force Colonel from Wight-Patterson  AFB,
    that 2 live Aliens were held in captivity in an artificial environment.
    The  Colonel also said that a 2-man sized craft crashed near Whitewater
    Lake,   Indiana,   as  a result of an  electrical  disturbance  in  the
    atmosphere.   [The Alien would have to lock his knees in a high-gravity
    environment to avoid falling down.]                               
                                                                      
    Feb.  11,  1965..Personal Interview report by Capt.  D.M.   (initials):
    Aerial  encounter of three UFOs with radar and visual  sightings.   Air
    Force flight F-169  enroute from Anchorage,  AL, to Japan.  Capt.  R.W.
    (initials)  and Capt. W. (initial) observed 3 UFOs on radar 5 miles off
    the  wing.   The UFOs paced the Flying Tiger freighter aircraft for  30
    minutes then climbed away at a steep angle at about 1200  knots  ground
    speed. Estimated size (thumb and finger method) approx. 200 to 1000 ft.
    diam.,  glowing red and oval shaped. The pilot remarked,  "we often see
    UFOs on the Alaskan run!"                                         
                                                                      
    May  28,   1965...Police  statement  (interview);   Bougainville  Reef,
    Australia:  An Ansett-A.N.A.  DC-6B airliner (VH-INH)  en route to Port
    Moresby,  New Guinea, was buzzed by a UFO at about 3:25 a.m.  The pilot
    radioed  the  Townsville  Ground Control Tower and talked  to  Mr.   O.
    (initial). Description: slightly spherical and oblate, flattened on top
    and bottom;  appeared to have exhaust gasses coming from it.  Photos of
    the UFO were taken by the pilot  but were later confiscated at Canberra
    as was the taped conversation to Mr. O., the Tower operator. Mr. O. was
    threatened with dismissal if he talked about the incident.        
                                                                      
    July 3,  1965...Newspaper reports, ANTARCTICA:  Argentine,  British and
    Chilean  military and scientific personnel observed an UFO moving at  a
    frightening speed doing incredible maneuvers.  It was something  solid,
    glowing  blue-green  and causing E/M interference with  our  equipment.
    Lenticular  shaped "flying saucer".  Tracked by theodolite,  binoculars
    and magnetograph tapes.  Also,  10  color photographs were taken of the
    UFO.                                                              
                                                                      
    Sept.  3, 1965..Project Blue Book File #(?): Damon/Angleton, TX. Deputy
    Sheriffs Billy E.  McCoy and Robert W.  Goode were investigating an UFO
    in  the back-woods roads when the purplish UFO shot  instantly  towards
    them to within 150  feet and hovered at 100  feet off the ground.   The
    bright  glow  illuminated the interior of the car and  the  surrounding
    fields (11:30  p.m.).  "Every blade of grass stood out clearly"  in the
    field. Officer Goode, who was driving with his arm out the window, felt
    heat  on  his  arm and later reported that a cut that was  on  his  arm
    healed more rapidly than normal [U/V effects].                    
                                                                      
    Sept.16,1965...NICAP Report #(?): Pretoria, S. Africa:  Constables John
    Lockem and Koos de Klerk while on patrol (after midnight)  suddenly had
    a  domed,  disc shaped object come into their van headlights.   It  was
    sitting on the road.  The UFO was copper colored and about 30  ft.   in
    diam.   Immediately the UFO lifted off,  emitting tongues of flame from
    two  tubes  or channels on the underside.  The flames  deflected  about
    three  feet off the macadam road surface and were still  visible  after
    loosing sight of the craft. Road damage: part of the road was caved-in,
    and in a 6 foot area the gravel was separated from the tar.  Samples of
    the  road  surface  were taken for analysis,  which  report  was  never
    released.  Lt. Col. J.B.  Brits,  District Commandant of Pretoria North
    said the incident was "highly SECRET ... and inquiry is being conducted
    in TOP circles."                                                  
                                                                      
    Nov., 1965.....Fort Riley, KA: "AK" (Aaron Kaback) was on guard duty at
    2  a.m.  when the duty officer drove up and ordered him to hop into the
    jeep.  He and 3 other officers were driven out to a remote area where a
    large  oval objectwas resting.  An army chopper was hovering above  the
    object and shining a bright light on it.  The object was approx.  35-48
    ft.  in diam., had a fin on the end and an exhaust port or some kind of
    hole below the fin.  It had rows of squares around the rim and remained
    completely dead for the 2 1/2  hours they guarded it.  (Kaback seems to
    be confused as to the actual date this incident occurred. see 12/10/64)
                                                                      
    Mar.  20,  1966..Dexter, MI.: Frank Mannor, age 47,  and Ronald Mannor,
    age  19,   went  out  at night through  swampy,   hummocky  terrain  to
    investigate flashing lights in the swamp. They saw a domed,  elliptical
    object with a quilted surface hovering about 8 ft.  off the ground in a
    patch  of apparent mist.  The object glowed "blood red"  and  the  body
    lights disappeared. They lost sight of the UFO and didn't see it again.
    (see 3/21/66;4/1/66)                                              
                                                                      
    Mar.  20, 1966..La Porte, IN: Patrolman Michael Spevak was on duty when
    2   youths  pulled over and pointed out an UFO that they said had  been
    following  them from Michigan City to La Porte.  According to the young
    men,   the  object  frequently burst into such a bright glare  that  it
    blinded them, forcing them off the highway.  It had been following them
    at  an altitude of about 60  ft.  Both the young men and the  patrolman
    noticed  a cross-shaped appendage protruding from the lower portion  of
    the UFO.                                                          
                                                                      
    Mar.   21,  1966..Law enforcement officer F.B.  (initials)  at  Dexter,
    Michigan,  and officer "C" (initial)  on patrol sighted a landed saucer
    in a swamp.  Description:  Large craft, like a pot;  no windows;  had a
    dull  glow  and  steam was coming up from the water.   Sounded  like  a
    turbine,   a   low  whine  or hum.  He  notified  Selfridge  AFB  which
    immediately  sent out MP's,  well armed.  All law officers were ordered
    back and their film was confiscated. Later his report and other reports
    disappeared  from  police headquarters.  Then,  everyone in the  force,
    including  he and "C",  were transferred to other parts of the  county.
    The  UFO wasn't disabled.  F.B.  saw it take-off and climb straight up.
    (see 3/1/67)                                                      
                                                                      
    Apr.   1,   1966...From  LIFE  magazine:  In  a  hastily  called  press
    conference,   the  USAF spokesman J.  Allen Hynek  suggested  that  the
    Dextor,  MI,  UFO and others seen in the swamps near Hillsdale may have
    been  marsh  (or  swamp)   gas that had  spontaneously  ignited.   (see
    3/20/66;3/21/66)                                                  
                                                                      
    Apr. 5, 1966...Congressman,  Gerald Ford announces to Congress the need
    to extensively examine UFOs.                                      
                                                                      
    Apr.  17,1966...Ravenna,  OH,  to Conway,  Penn.:  Deputy Sheriffs Dale
    Spaur  and  Wilbur Neff of Portage County were on patrol  when  an  UFO
    stopped above them, illuminating them and the surroundings (it was just
    about dawn). As the UFO moved away from them at about 300-500 ft. above
    the road, it would alternately start and stop ahead of them playing cat
    and mouse.  At E.  Palestine,  OH,  officer Wayne  Huston joined in the
    pursuit.  At speeds of 100 mph in unfamiliar territory,  they were soon
    low  on  gas and had to give up the game with the UFO.   Through  local
    police  dispatch  the  officers alerted the Air Force,   who  sent  out
    fighter  planes  to investigate the UFO.  As the officers  saw  the  AF
    planes  approaching  the UFO shot straight up and out of  sight.   (see
    6/24/66)                                                          
                                                                      
    Summer,   1966...Results of an Iowa Poll,  Iowa:  45%   Iowans  queried
    believe UFOs to be REAL objects.  Of the 45%,  21%  were of the opinion
    that the UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin.                    
                                                                      
    June,  1966.....Nha Trang,  Vietnam:  At this active Army Base at about
    9:45  p.m.,  what was thought to be a flare lit up the north sky.   The
    bright  UFO  approached  the  base alternately moving at  low  to  high
    speeds.   Upon descending toward the soldiers it hovered at an altitude
    of 300-500  ft.  All of a sudden the 6 generators failed along with the
    engines  of  the idling Skyraiders,  (TESLA energy  discharge  effects)
    bulldozers and trucks. The entire valley and surrounding mountains were
    illuminated  by the hovering UFO for about 4 min.  after which it  went
    straight up and disappeared in about 3 sec.  After the incident a plane
    load of officials from Washington arrived to investigate. (see 3/4/69) 
                                                                      
    June 24, 1966..Richmond, VA: Officer William L. Stevens, Jr.,  observed
    a dirigible-shaped UFO at 3:30  in the morning near the fairgrounds. It
    was about100  ft. long and 30 ft.  thick with greenish-yellow lights on
    its perimeter.  Stevens attempted to chase the UFO but it maintained an
    even  distance from him even though he sped up and slowed  down.   "The
    object seemed to be playing CAT & MOUSE with me,"  he later said. After
    10-15 min. the UFO accelerated and sped away. (see 4/17/66)

    Mar.   4,  1969...Near Atlanta,  Missouri:  The City Marshall and  Mail
    Carrier in Elmer,  Missouri,  William R.  Overstreet observed an UFO at
    early dawn over the road ahead of him.  It was about 100  ft.  in diam.
    apparently rotating clockwise and emitting a strong white beam of light
    down  to  the road which seemed to magnify the size of the road it  was
    shining on.  He felt intense heat from the direction of the UFO and his
    CB  radio was dead.  As he neared the light beam from the UFO his truck
    motor and radio quit.  As the beammoved away from his truck he was able
    to start the engine again.(TESLA energy discharge effects)  He followed
    the UFO for about 4 mi.  staying away from the beam.  The UFO  followed
    the  contour of the land it was flying over.  After 7-8  min.  the  UFO
    veered  away and went out of sight.  "I had never believed in them  too
    much until I saw this," he said. "Now I know that there is something to
    these UFOs!" (see 8/13/75,6/66)

    Oct.  2,  1972...A letter from the Dept.  of National Defence,  Canada,
    Brig.   Gen.   L.A.  Bourgeois states:  All UFOs reported to  CFHQ  are
    investigated  by  the Director of Operations.  It isn't a  practice  to
    allow  the  public to study these files.  Since the beginning  of  1968
    these UFO reports have been passed along to the NRC.  Evidence suggests
    that  UFOs  present no threat to the Technology world.  They exhibit  a
    unique scientifically advanced technology. (see 9/19/26)          
                                                                      
    Sept.   ,1973....At Great Lakes Naval Base,  Instructor R.K.,   Gunnery
    School Grade E-4,  while delivering a sealed envelope to the Commandant
    in the quonset hut,  was surprised to see a saucer 30 ft. diam.  and 10
    ft.  ht.  resting on a wooden platform.  Description:  Silvery blue and
    shimmering,  it tapered like a teardrop with a flange running along its
    topside  from  one end to the other and there were  no  windows.   R.K.
    believed  this saucer to be the one shot down on its third pass over  a
    Navy vessel by a missile.  The saucer crashed in 350 ft.  water between
    Hawaii and the mainland. It was retrieved by a Glomar Explorer, shipped
    to Hawaii then stateside to Chicago.                              
                                                                      
    Oct.  18,  1973..Capt. Lawrence Coyne,  while flying an Army helicopter
    with three other crewmen were 45  minutes out over Mansfield when Staff
    Sgt.   Robert  Yanacsek spotted a red glowing UFO headed  toward  their
    helicopter at an estimated 600  mph. It stopped abruptly 500 ft.  above
    them.  It had a big,  gray,  metallic looking hull about 60  ft.  long,
    shaped  like an airfoil or streamlined cigar with a red light in  front
    and  a  green  light in the rear,  the lead edge  glowed  red  a  short
    distance  from the nose.  There was a center dome.  The  'copter  radio
    wouldn't  function  and the copter was set for a 20   degree  dive  but
    gained altitude from 1700  ft. to 3500 ft. with no power applied. After
    a slight "bounce" the UFO took off to the N.E.                    
                                                                      
    Oct.  25,  1973..Director of FBI, Clarence M. Kelley, states:  UFOs are
    not  and  never  has been a matter that  is  within  the  investigative
    jurisdiction of the FBI.

    Mar.   28,  1975..Letter from Senator Barry Goldwater stating:  Ten  or
    twelve  years  ago  I tried to get access to the  building  at  Wright-
    Patterson  (HANGER-18)   where  UFO  artifacts were stored  and  I  was
    understandably denied access.  It is still classified above TOP SECRET.
    I've  heard  they plan to release some of the information in  the  near
    future and hope not to have to wait too much longer.              
                                                                      
    Aug.  13,  1975..Near Haderslev,  Denmark:  Police Officer Evald Hansen
    Maarup was driving home at 10:50 p.m.  when all of a sudden his car was
    engulfed by a bright blue light while at the same time his car lost all
    power. The temperature in his car rose to that of a warm summer day and
    his radio was dead so he couldn't call for help.  The bright beam  from
    the  UFO was conical in shape with a bottom diam.  of 4-5  meters and a
    top  diam.   at the UFO of 10  meters.  Two dome-like protrusions  were
    visible  on  the  underside of the UFO that was hovering  at  about  20
    meters altitude.  He activated a special camera on the patrol car which
    automatically  took  3  pictures of the UFO.  As the UFO sped  away  he
    regained  power to his car.  The developed film which was later  turned
    over  to  the Danish AF showed the light source of the UFO on  it.   No
    report or analysis has been available from the AF to date. (see 3/4/69)
                                                                      
    Aug. 13, 1975..Alamogordo, NM: Staff Sgt. Charles L. Moody, USAF, drove
    out to the outskirts of town late one night to watch for meteors.  As a
    disc-shaped UFO descended toward him,  he tried to start his car to get
    away but it wouldn't start.  He heard a high pitched whining sound from
    the  UFO and saw shadowy figures in it and felt numbness,  after  which
    the  UFO departed.  After driving home he found he couldn't account for
    1.5  hours. The next day his back was enflame and he discovered a small
    puncture wound over his spine and a few days later he developed a  body
    rash.  As months passed he regained memory of the missing 1.5 hours. He
    remembered that he had been in the UFO and in telepathic  communication
    with small 4'8"  humanoids.  They had whitish gray skin,  large  heads,
    large eyes,  small slit-like mouths and mask-like features. He had been
    in a drug-like state  on  a table and they  had poked a rod like device
    into  his back.  After this they escorted him about the ship and  later
    dropped him off at his car. (see 3/4/69)                          
                                                                      
    Oct. 28, 1975..CONFIDENTIAL CINC/NORAD Report: UFOs, suspicious objects
    seen by ground personnel. Sounded like jet aircraft. Intermittent radar
    contact  made  with  object.  Jets scrambled to intercept  but  objects
    lights  went out interceptors passed and then came on again.  Then  the
    object  increased in speed and raised to a high altitude and could  not
    be discerned from the stars.  Description:  Through binoculars,  looked
    like 100 ft. sphere and appeared to have craters around the outside. To
    date, AF and SAC helicopters have failed to provide a positive I.D.  of
    the UFO. (see 11/11/75,7/52)                                      
                                                                      
    Oct.  29,  1975..NMCC Joint Staff Memo:  Subject:  AFB penetration.  At
    290200  EST,  AFOC informed NMCC that an unidentified helicopter (UFO),
    possibly two,  had been sighted flying low over Loring AFB,  Maine,  in
    proximity to a weapons storage area. Army Nat. Guard helos called in to
    assist in locating UFO. NORAD informed of the incident by SAC. Received
    authority to proceed into Canadian airspace,  if necessary,  to  locate
    UFO. A similar incident was reported the evening before.

    remain classified.                                                
                                                                      
    July 30,  1976..NMCC Joint Staff Memo:  Subject:  Reports of UFOs.   At
    approx. 0345, EDT, the ANMCC received several reports of UFOs near Fort
    Ritchie.  At 0130, civilians reported an UFO to the NAB.  At 0255,  two
    separate  patrols sighted three UFOs;  oblong with a reddish tint.   At
    0300,   the Desk Sgt.  (name with held)  sighted an UFO over  the  ammo
    storage area at 100-200  yds.  altitude.  At 0345,  an Army Police Sgt.
    sighted an UFO in the vicinity of sight R.  ANMCC was requested to have
    each individual write a statement on the sightings. One person said the
    UFO was the size of a 2.5 ton truck.                              
                                                                      
    Sep. 19, 1976..Tehran, Iran: Civilians reported an UFO to the AFB.  The
    Iranian  AF scrambled an American F-4  for intercept.  As the F-4   was
    vectored   towards   the  brilliant  UFO,    all   communications   and
    instrumentation were suddenly lost. As the pilot broke off pursuit, all
    aircraft functions returned to normal. A second F-4  that was scrambled
    began  closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing  on
    the UFO at 150  nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead
    of the F-4  (confirmed by  Radar).   Multi-colored flashing lights were
    visible  on the UFO.  The moment the F-4  pilot tried to lock an  AIM-9
    missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control.
    The UFO launched two smaller UFOs,  one of which began to follow the F-
    4. After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united
    with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the
    ground  so  the  pilot  flew down to investigate it.   The  landed  UFO
    appeared to be 12  feet in diameter?  As the pilot descended the  light
    from  the landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it.  The DIA  termed
    this sighting as "an outstanding report.  This case is a classic  which
    meets all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon." And,
    "an  inordinate  amount of manuverablilty was displayed by  the  UFOs."
    (see 10/2/72,9/20/76)                                             
                                                                      
    Sep.  20, 1976..DIA MESSAGE: UFO sighted over Tehran, Iran.  "Initiate"
    IPSP PT-1440.  The Iranian Air Force scrambled an F-4  to intercept the
    UFO. Due to its brilliance the UFO was visible 70 miles away.  When the
    F-4  approached within 25  mi. of UFO the F-4  lost ALL instrumentation
    and  communications (UHF and intercom).  As the first F-4  banked  away
    from the UFO he regained instr. and comm. A second F-4  was dispatched,
    2  man,  with  radar.The radar return was of a craft the  size of a 707
    Tanker.  As the F-4  closed within 25 NMi.  of UFO,  the UFO launched a
    bright white object about one third the apparent size of the moon.  The
    pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9  missile at the second UFO but at that
    moment he lost all instruments and communication.As he banked away from
    the primary object  the secondary object went to the inside of his turn
    then returned and rejoined with the primary object.  Afterwards the F-4
    regained control of instr. and communications. (see 9/19/76)

    Nov. 9, 1978... L. Gordon Cooper, in a letter to the U.N.,  states that
    UFOs are interplanetary vehicles and crewed by Aliens.            
                                                                      
    May 10,  1980...DOD Report: The FAP (Peruvian Air Force)  spotted a UFO
    twice and tried to intercept and destroy the UFO without success.  (see
    7/52)                                                             
                                                                      
    Aug.  9, 1980...through Sep. 3, 1980:  AFOSI Complaint Form:at Kirtland
    AFB three persons report seeing UFO over a Restricted Test Range. 
                                                                      
    On Aug. 9th a Sandia Security Guard drove down the Coyote Canyon access
    road to check out an alarmed building and observed a landed UFO next to
    an  alarmed  building.  The UFO was a round disk shaped object.  As  he
    approached  the object on foot equipped with a shotgun the object  took
    off  in a vertical direction at a high rate of speed.  His radio wasn't
    working  right at the time so he couldn't reach dispatch.  The building
    contained HQ CR 44 material. [Nature of material not known.]      
                                                                      
    Sept.16,   1980..  Sgt.  J.M.  (initials)  of the PACAF writes  to  Len
    Stringfield that he was stationed at McGuire AFB,  N.J., when,  on Jan.
    18,  1978, an MP shot and killed an alien at the Ft. Dix Army base next
    to the AFB. (see 1/18/78)                                         
                                                                      
    Nov.   17,   1980..SECRET USAF OSI Document:  Analysis of photo of  UFO
    following  C-5A aircraft inclusive.  Photo analysis of Cylinder  Shaped
    UFO legitimate.  PhotoE.  showed legitimate disc shaped UFO of 37   ft.
    diameter with trilateral insignia on object. USAF still has an interest
    in all UFO sightings over installations and test ranges.  Several other
    Government  agencies,   lead by NASA,  actively investigate  legitimate
    sightings  through COVERT COVER.  One agency that deceives  the  public
    whict such covert cover is the UFO reporting center at U.S.  Coast  and
    Geodetic Survey, Rockville, MD. 20852. [The results of PROJECT AQUARIUS
    is  still  classified TOP SECRET with access limited to  "MJ-12".]  The
    Paul  Bennewitz  case still being monitored by NASA.   Still  receiving
    assistance from Fugate(?) Miller. (see 2/1/78)                    
                                                                      
    Dec.  27,  1980..USAF UFO REPORT signed by Lt.  Col.  Charles I.  Halt,
    Deputy Base Commander, RAF Woodbridge stating: Two USAF security police
    patrolmen  saw a UFO either hovering or on legs outside the back  gate,
    Woodbridge. Being early morning,  it illuminated the entire forest with
    a  white light.  Description:  Metallic in appearance and triangular in
    shape,   pulsing red light on top and banks of blue lights  underneath.
    Approx.  2-3 meters across and 2 meters high. It maneuvered through the
    trees and disappeared. (see 12/29/80)                             
                                                                      
    Dec.  29,  1980..Lt. Col. C. I. Halt,  sees a UFO that separates into 5
    UFOs and later sees 3 other UFOs. (see 12/27/80)                  
                                                                      
    Dec.   29,   1980..A low flying UFO was escorted by a large  number  of
    helicopters  (23)   including some Chinooks and possibly  Hueys,   near
    Dayton,  Texas.  It was probably escorted to the TOP SECRET underground
    installation within Fort Hood, Texas.  The SECRET air force base is NOT
    listed in the Air Force Officer's Guide or the Air Force Almanac [it is
    an Army AFB]. The name of the Secret base is Gray AAF, Texas.     
                                                                      
    (12/29/80,  cont'd)  The special group piloting the helicopters  Escort
    for  UFO are known as the "BLUEBOYS".  The Texas Department  of  Public
    Safety works closely with Gray AAF on UFO cases. (see 6/6/88)     
                                                                      
    Jan. 13, 1981..(BENTWATERS AFB) Air Force MEMO from Lt. Col. Charles I.
    Halt, Deputy Base Commander. (see 12/27/80,12/29/80)              
                                                                      
    Oct.  19, 1981..Barry Goldwater, Senator,  Arizona,  in a letter to Lee
    Graham,  f Aeroject Electric Systems, Azusa, Calif., states that he has
    given up trying to get into the BLUE ROOM at Wright-Patterson AFB where
    UFO artifacts are stored by the Air Force. (see 3/28/75)          
                                                                      
    Nov.   3,   1981...Civil Action,  Case No.  80-1562,  goes against  the
    plaintiff and for the defendant, the NSA.  The NSA retains the right to
    withhold 156  TOP SECRET records containing communications intelligence
    (COMINT)   reports  which were produced between 1958  and  1979.   Only
    military personnel with a Top Secret Clearance were allowed to view the
    documents for the court hearing.  NOT even the Judge was allowed to see
    them, even though he ruled against the plaintiff (CAUS). (see 6/24/83) 
                                                                      
    Nov.  27, 1982..Palatine, IL.: Police Commander Michael McDonald was on
    patrol at 5:00 a.m. when the area around his car was lighted,  as if by
    a phosphorousflare.  Looking up he saw a large white UFO with tinges of
    red  at  an altitude of 900-1000  ft.  Two other officers,  alerted  by
    radio,  also observed the UFO.  The other two cars gave pursuit to  the
    UFO at speeds of between 60-65 mph but the UFO outdistanced them. A few
    minutes later another UFO was noted by the commander and then the other
    two officers.  It was a diffuse "domed disc"  which was seen to emit  a
    beam of light towards the ground.  The UFO then disappeared behind  the
    tree  line  of a forest preserve.  The police report  includes  a  tape
    recording of the radio communications during the sighting.        
                                                                      
    Jun. 24, 1983..Larry W. Bryant, Director of CAUS, filed a Civil Action,
    Case No.  83-1932 (Judge Oliver Gasch) petitioning for a Writ of Habeas
    Corpus  EXTRATERRESTRIAL,  in the United States District Court for  the
    Dist.  of Columbia,  seeking to obtain the release from custody of "one
    or  more  occupants of apparent extraterrestrial origin."  Mr.   Bryant
    contends  that  the  Government action in maintaining  secret  custody,
    detention,  and prosecution of such extraterrestrials is unlawful and a
    violation  of their basic rights and is seeking to restore their  civil
    rights. (see 11/3/81)                                             
                                                                      
    Nov.  29,1983...Dr.  Robert I Sarbacher,  President and Chairman of the
    Board,   Washington  Institute of Technology,  in a letter  to  William
    Steinman states persons definitely involved in operations of  recovered
    saucers were John von Neuman and Dr. Vannever Bush. Also, Dr. Sarbacher
    thought that Robert Oppenheimer was also involved.  Dr.  Sarbacher  had
    been  invited  by  President Eisenhower to attend  several  discussions
    associated with the reported recoveries, but was unable to attend them.
    He  did receive Special Reports on the recoveries at the  Pentagon  but
    was instructed NOT to remove them from his office.                
                                                                      
    1984...........From  the  Air Traffic Controllers Manual:   Controllers
    MUST  report UFOs immediately to AIS (Military),  LATCC.  A   completed
    report  MUST  be  sent  to MOD (AFOR).  A  list of  phone  numbers  and
    locations is shown in the directory at Appendix H.                
                                                                      
    May 16,  1984...Dept. of the Army letter to W. S. Steinman stating that
    the  IPU  was  disestablished in the late 1950s and  all  records  were
    transferred  to the Air Force.  Therefore the Army isn't aware of  what
    their function was even though it was a Secret unit of the Army.  [FOIA
    requests to USAF] (see 3/12/87)                                   
                                                                      
    Mar. 19, 1985..(LONDON, ENGLAND)  In a letter from Ministry of Defence,
    Lord Trefgarne states,  "There is no organization in the MOD  appointed
    solely for the purpose of studying UFOs,  and no staff are employed  on
    the  subject full time...  the staff in the Department...  examine  the
    reports as part of heir normal duties... and we cannot inform observers
    of the probable identity of the objects seen."                    
                                                                      
    June 28, 1985..USAF ACCESS RESTRICTED NOTICE: Report TR-DE-3A, Oct. 15,
    1955, from Air Tech. Intel. Ctr., file no. TS5-2862, has been WITHDRAWN
    from the National Archives and is classified a TOP SECRET UFO REPORT. 
                                                                      
    Aug. 27, 1985..Darlian, CHINA, the "China Daily" reports: 20,000 people
    are  involved in UFO research.  The first recognized photo of a UFO  in
    China  was taken in 1945.  In 1981  CSUR UFO research organization  was
    established.   More than 600  UFOs have been reported within the past 5
    years  in  China.  Studies will be done on UFOs and Human body  science
    relationships.                                                    
                                                                      
    May 11,  1986...Near Sadona,  AR: Minister Robert H.  Henderson and his
    wife, Nann, of Phoenix, AR, were flying at an altitude of 8500 ft. at 4
    p.m. when a very bright UFO was seen approaching head-on to them. As he
    prepared to take evasive action the UFO passed quickly to the left  and
    below  of his plane.  The UFO was seen to be wingless and resembling  a
    "modified half-sphere,  with the flat side down."  The closure rate was
    estimated at about 1200 mph.                                      
                                                                      
    May 19,  1986...Near Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Between 9:00
    to 12  midnight the Brazilian Air Defense and the Civil Air System were
    swamped with Radar and pilot UFO sightings. As Ospires Silva, President
    of  Petrobras  Oil Company were preparing to land,  the  control  tower
    informed him of UFO targets on their radar. He and his companion, Alcir
    Pereira da Silva,  saw bright red-orange UFOs, not at all like stars or
    planes.  They attempted to pursue the UFOs for 30  min.  but gave up as
    the UFOs seemed to be jumping from place to place.  At this time  three
    F-5E  fighter  jets were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB.  Capt.   Marcio
    Jordao was able to approach within 12  miles of an UFO,  visible to him
    as  a  bright light changing from white to green.  Lt.   Kleber  Caldas
    Marinho  chased  another UFO which was a very intense light,   changing
    from white to green then red again. Both pilots broke off chase as they
    were running low on fuel.  Ground Radar picked up 10-13  more UFOs that
    surrounded  another plane with Capt.  Armindo Souza Viriato de Marinho,
    K.C. Freitas piloting it. Capt.  Freitas tracked the UFOs on his radar,
    but  only  de Freitas,  A.S.V.  saw them visually once as they  climbed
    vertically past him. Brig. Gen.  Octavio Moreira Lima made these events
    public at a press conference and allowed the pilots and radar operators
    to be questioned by the media. (see 7/52)                         
                                                                      
    Feb.   15,   1987..The San Jose Mercury states that the Pentagon has  a
    "Black  Budget"  which has become a "Black Hole"  for  SECRET  Projects
    spending!   It is far bigger than the federal budget for  education  or
    transportation  or agriculture or the environment.  These Projects  are
    classified  above Top Secret,  therefore very few federal investigators
    have the security clearances necessary to audit black programs.   
                                                                      
    Mar.  12, 1987..U.S.  Army Intelligenc letter:  The IPU (Interplanetary
    Phenomenon  Unit)   of  the Scientific and Technical  Branch,   Counter
    intelligence  Directorate,   Department of the Army was  disestablished
    during the 1950's and never reactivated. All of its records were turned
    over  to the USAF (which can't seem to locate them).  This  letter  was
    sent to Timothy Good. (see 5/16/84)                               
                                                                      
    Sep.   4,  1987...JMP (Justice for Military Personnel)  letter sent  to
    President Ronald Reagan. This letter, verified by: Astronaut L.  Gordon
    Cooper,  Maj.  Donald E. Keyhoe (USMC, Ret.), MUFON (Sequin, TX),  APRO
    (Tucson,  AZ) and Just Cause (Coventry,  CT)  states that:"WE (military
    personnel)   have  been ordered by the CIA to shoot at  UFOs,   silence
    pilots  who  have seen UFOs,  intimidate,  harass,  jail,   confine  to
    institutions,and   destroy  military  carreers  of  witnesses  to   UFO
    sightings.   We  VIOLATED  the Freedom of  Information  Act  by  hiding
    Government documents." (see 7/52,9/24/47)                         
                                                                      
    Nov.  17, 1986..Near Fort Yukon, Alaska: Japan Airlines flight #1628, a
    Boeing 747  freighter, was cruising at 35000  ft.  altitude and at 5:11
    p.m.  the pilots noticed bright lights 30 degrees to the left and below
    them.  The UFOs moved up directly in front of the 747  and,  said Capt.
    Kenju Terauchi,  "most unexpectedly, two spaceships stopped in front of
    our face, shooting off lights (like numerous exhaust pipes). The inside
    cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face." The UFOs appeared
    as two rectangular clusters or arrays of light, one above the other. As
    the  larger UFOs moved away from the 747  Airlines Flight  1628   there
    remained two smaller flat white UFOs. At about 5:30 p.m. Capt. Terauchi
    checked  the  pale white light behind their craft visually.  He  saw  a
    gigantic  "walnet-shaped"  UFO (Saturn-shaped)  following them.  As  an
    evasive  action the Capt.  ordered the 747  to turn away from the giant
    UFO  that  was  following  them,  at which  time  the  UFO  "spaceship"
    disappeared.                                                      
                                                                      
    Dec. 21, 1987..CIA letter to Mr. Richard Hall stating the CIA's reasons
    for  denying  certain  FOIA  requests about himself  on  the  basis  of
    national defence reasons and must be kept secret.  Mr.  Hall is an  UFO
