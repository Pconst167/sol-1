    Hello Rick! 
    
    In a msg of <20 Jun 91>, Rick Graham writes to Bryce Eckstein:

    > conclusion was reached? 

    The  documentary  contains commentary and opinion  from  two  reputable 
    astronomers and three equally reputable researchers. 

    1.  Astronomer Terry Dickenson,  who's article about the Hill abduction 
    in  Astronomy  Magazine  in 1974,  first brought the  incident  to  the 
    attention of the scientific community. 

    2.  Amateur Astronomer Marjorie Fisch,  found a real  three-dimensional 
    distribution  of stars that perfectly matched Betty Hill's map,   first 
    published in John Fuller's book, "Interrupted Journey". 

    3.   Dr.   David  Jacobs,   Assistant Professor of  History  at  Temple 
    University in Philadelphia, the only Prof teaching a course in UFO's at 
    any major university in the U.S. or Canada, has spent his research time 
    for  the  past  five  years,  exclusively on  alien  abductions.   He's 
    interviewed 51  subjects from whom he has collected over 300  abduction 
    stories. 

    4. Dr. David Gottlieb, a Psychotherapist in Toronto. 

    5.   Dr.   Michael Persinger,  a  Psychologist and  Neuro-Scientist  at 
    Laurentian University in Sudbury,  Ontario.  With the exception of  Dr. 
    Persinger,   who examined the Hill incident and compared it to  similar 
    cases  from  a  neurological  viewpoint,  all  guests  on  the  program 
    objectively ruled out hoax and supported the Hill's experience as being 
    valid. 

    Bottom lines: 

    Dr. Gottlieb .. "Beats me!" 

    Dr,  Jacobs .. (And I paraphrase here)  "The whole incident disturbs me 
    greatly. I wish the scientific community had not heard of the Hill case 
    and other's that I have researched.  But now that we have, we must come 
    to grips with the fact that ET activity is a reality and make an effort 
    to remove the blinders as to what is really going on". Dr. Persinger .. 
    goes into how the experiences are likely manifestations of neurological 
    activity.   Sorry,  that's as far as I can take his theories - far  too 
    deep for my understanding {grin}. 

    Marjorie Fisch .. is convinced the Hill star map is valid. 

    Terry  Dickenson...  feels his role in the investigation is that of  an 
    astronomical referee.  Here is a quote from Dickenson,  taken from  the 
    tape: 

    "We've   got   something  that  can  be  studied  completely  from   an 
    astronomical  point  of view.  It seems to hold up  from  that  angle". 
    "Also,  Betty Hill drew the map before the star atlases were  available 
    to interpret it, so there is no possibility of any kind of confusion or 
    faking  in  that  regard".  "But I back off completely  when  we  start 
    talking  about  the  bizarre circumstances that  led  to  the  original 
    drawing of the map,  the abduction scenario,  the hypnosis and all  the 
    rest of it". "I feel totally unqualified to talk about it. I don't know 
    where  it  all stands right now.  All I can say is that the map  works. 
    Nobody  else come up with any other interpretation that works,   and  I 
    have  to leave it at that".  I'm personally convinced Betty and  Barney 
    Hill had a bona fide CEIII... and I too, will leave it at that. 
    
    Cheers Bryce
