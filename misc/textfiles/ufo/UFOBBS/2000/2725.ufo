    These comments are for the debunkers, Phillip Klass's,  Amazing Randy's 
    and All skeptics on this subject of ET's, UFO's and if you so desire to 
    lump  other  paranormal related activity into a group that  deals  with 
    something of a physical nature, so be it. 

    You  people make claims when someone shows you a pictures of what  they 
    claim our alien space crafts or we will use the word UFO's,  that these 
    pictures  are  fake  because photographs can be faked.  Now  that  last 
    statement is a fact,  pictures can be fake but are all pictures fake. I 
    think  we can both agree on this one.  No,  all pictures are not  fake. 
    Then  why do you people say that the holder of the pictures must  prove 
    that his pictures are not fake.  But in the Gulf Breeeze and the  Billy 
    Meier photographs (and many,  many others)  these pictures have analyze 
    using the most advance equipment that is available. Yet you still claim 
    that  they  are  a  hoax.   The  Billy  Meier  photo's  have  cost  the 
    investigating  team  over  $60,000  out of their pockets to have  4  of 
    Billy's pictures analyze and the results were that they could not  find 
    any faking of those pictures. 

    If  a robber walk into a bank and was photograph with the  bank  camera 
    and these picures were presented at the trial, and the defense attorney 
    made a statement that photgraphs can be faked so there for the  accused 
    is  incident.  I  think that unless he had some proof of his  claim  he 
    would be laughed out of court and possibly loose his license over  that 
    statement. 

    I  have no problem with so called skeptics and I welcome them for  they 
    can keep us honest and can input something that possibly we over looked 
    and  this  is  good.  But to come out with statements "photo's  can  be 
    faked"   and  all pilots that have seen UFO's should  have  their  eyes 
    examine,   all  people that claimed to seen UFO's are uneducated  hill-
    billies are not worth listening to. And I myself have a problem dealing 
    with these sort of indiviuals, as you probably notice. 

    I  spend a lot of my time and money going out to investigate  sightings 
    and  listening to people that claim to have been taken aboard  a  alien 
    space craft or claim to be in communcation.  I  don't necessary believe 
    all that I hear but I do listen to what they have to say and I've heard 
    some that even a person with a open mind has problems with.  I can tell 
    you  two things from what I've found and that is something or  somebody 
    is  making visits to the planet that we are living on (notice I  didn't 
    use the words,  OUR planet).  And two,  that OUR government is and have 
    been keeping this information from us for 40+ years. 

    Now,  what I want you all to do is to make a copy of this and retain it 
    in your files.  I  going to tell you something that is not a prediction 
    but  information  or possibly maybe disinformation that I  have  obtain 
    from unknown sources that I can't disclose at this time.  In 1992 and I 
    can  give  you  the exact date and how but I won't because  that  would 
    reveal the source, that OUR government and all governments of the world 
    will  acknowledge that we our being visited by ET's from other parts of 
    the  universe.  Now when this happens and its in the works  right  now, 
    what  are  all you skeptics and debunkers going to do?  Will you go  in 
    hiding  or  will you stand up and take the lumps like a man.  I   think 
    Phillip  will retire just before this happens and will keep a very  low 
    profile, lets make that a prediction, OK. 

    Now,   about  this other thing on lumping the UFO,  new  age  religion, 
    psychics, etc. into one catagory is ridicules and shows that your group 
    lacks any solid evidence to back your claims and there for have to  put 
    all into one group. Then you go out and pull any person off the streets 
    that nobody knows or has any backing to their abilities and make  fools 
    of  them in front of the public.  This is not only cruel to that person 
    but also down grades respect for your organization. Your philosophy is, 
    because  this person shows that he does not have psychic abilities  and 
    that he claims too,  then all reports of sightings of UFO's,  and  etc. 
    are  false.  HOG-WASH!!!!.  You prove to me that the evidence  in  Gulf 
    Breeze,  Billy Meier, Fyffe,  Roswell and the 1 million other cases are 
    false,   The  Ufologist around the world have brought to  you  and  the 
    general  public our findings.  Now lets hear yours and lets keep it UFO 
    related OK. 
    
    The best of 1991 to all
