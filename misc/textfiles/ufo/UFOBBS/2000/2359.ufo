A local air-traffic controller and a police helicopter pilot reportedly tracked
about 60 unidentified aircraft over Tucson Monday, but federal author- ities are
not investigating. Tucson International Airport radar picked up the aircraft at
12:15 a.m. Monday. Radar monitored the objects for about 90 min. The radar
picked them up southwest of the city, near Ryan Field, and lost them as they
flew northeasterly through Redington Pass. The controller reported that 15
groups of four to six objects each were monitored on the radar. the UFOs were
travelling at about 250 knots, or 288 mph. The tower called the police pilot on
duty and said that they had some targets but no transponders.  The transponders
are radar transceivers that automatically identify individual air craft for air
traffic controllers. If you don't turn your transponder on, all it shows up as
(on radar) is a blip. The pilot tried to follow the objects and did see some
lights,but was unable to catch up with them. The pilot was up about 4,000 feet
and they were up at 7,000 feet. The Air Force said d-m jets stop flying by 10:30
pm  and knew of no other military flights in the area at 12:15 AM Monday.

Soldiers and civilians around Ft. Devens have been keeping an eye on the sky in
the wake of several recent re- ports of UFO's sighted in the local area.
Witnesses said the+ewnih6o=-ed like two glowing orange spheres. Eight different
individuals have reported seeing these over the past ten days. According to the
Boxboro, Mass. police log, the UFOs were first sighted by two police officers on
Oct. 19. Said patrolman Stephen Trefry, along with his partner Robert Morrill:
We saw two bright orange lights hovering over the tree tops. We watched them for
about 10 seconds, then they disappeared. Morrill immediately radioed their
sighting back to Boxboro police station. Suddenly they observed the objects
again about 150 yards away. moving diagonally over the hillside, the UFO's
lights glowed for another few sec- onds then disappeared. Marcie Robinson, a
physical therapist at Emerson Hospital was driving her two daughters to school
when they observed two round orange balls high over a pasture off Prescott Road.
Normally skeptical about UFO's, Robinson admitted,"i'm not sure if there's a
simple explanation for what we saw."

ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A mysterious unidentified flying object with flashing white
and yellow strobe lights followed a Japan Air Lines cargo jet across the Arctic
Circle, the crew says.

The three-man crew radioed air traffic controllers in Anchorage that a huge UFO
was flying "in formation" with them and the Air Force briefly confirmed and
object near the plane, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul
Steucke.

He said the FAA in Anchorage and Fairbanks did not pick up the object.  The
incident occurred Nov.17 but was not made public earlier.

Flight 1628 had left Reykjavik, Iceland, flying over the North Pole to Tokyo
with a stop in Anchorage.  When it landed at Anchorage, FAA security manager Jim
Derry interviewed the pilot, Co-pilot and flight engineer.  When the report was
made to the Air Route Traffic Control Center at 6:19 p.m., Steucke said
controllers tried to find the object on radar but "were unable to comfirm a
second target with our equipment."

At 6:26 p.m. Steucke said the Air Force told the FAA it "saw a second target
(object) 8 miles away (from the JAL jet) but they contacted us a mimute later
and said they were no longer receiving any radar return (of a second object)."

Steucke added, "At 6:32 the JAL pilot requested and received permission for a
descent from 35,000 feet to 31,000."  Air controllers asked if the lights were
still there, and were told, "It is descending in formation." At 6:39 p.m.,20
minutes after the lights first reported, the JAL crew said it no longer saw the
lights.

At 6:45 p.m. Fairbanks controllers authrized a United Airlines northbound jet to
make a 10 degree turn to better view the JAL plane and asked the United crew if
it saw anything besides the Boeing 747.  It did not. Nor did the JAL crew see
the lights again.

Witness got up around 4:15 - 5:15 a.m. to go to restroom and saw an object over
her home that covered five other homes as well.  The object was huge, pure white
and had no lights.  The object was the shape of a saucer and rotating.  Even
though the object was bright (brighter than any object she had ever seen) it did
not hurt her eyes to look at it.  She had no fear and wanted to run out of her
home and stand underneath the object but felt paralyzed.  The object did return
and her 12 year old son was able to see it.  Since the incident she has had
visions which she did not experience prior to the sighting of the object.
