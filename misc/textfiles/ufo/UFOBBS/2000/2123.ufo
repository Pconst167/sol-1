     Two  and  a  half years ago,  the MJ-12  briefing  document,
allegedly  written  in November 1952  to  inform  President-elect
Eisenhower  of  two UFO crashes (Roswell,  1947,  and the  Texas-
Mexico  border,   1950)  and  of  a  supersecret  project  called
Majestic-12,  was  unleashed  on  the world,  by  Bill  Moore  in
California and Timothy Good in England.   Today the issue remains
unsettled,  though  at the moment the skeptics seem to  have  the
upper  hand.   (They argue that the signature of President Truman
on another alleged MJ-12 document, which arrived on the same roll
of  35mm  film that the briefing document did,  is  identical  to
Truman's signature on another,  undisputed, non-UFO document from
the same period,  the implication being that a hoaxer appended  a
real  signature to a bogus document.)  Within a few weeks Stanton
Friedman  will have submitted his report on his investigation  to
the Fund for UFO Research,  which gave him $16,000 with which  to
conduct the inquiry.
     At  that  time perhaps we will be able to come to  a  fully-
informed judgment.   And perhaps then, too, we will have a chance
to  reflect  on  whether it would have been wiser to  spend  that
money on further investigation of the Roswell incident,  next  to
which  MJ-12  (for  which  so far evidence barely  exists)  is  a
distinctly  secondary  issue.   It is sadly true that  the  MJ-12
uproar, for all the paper it has generated, has produced not much
of substance (and not a single serious researcher, even Friedman,
willing  to identify himself as a "proponent" of  the  document).
Certainly  the  MJ-12 affair has done little to enhance any  real
understanding of how the United States government dealt with  the
UFO  phenomenon,  including  the presumed hard evidence from  the
Roswell crash.
     This  is  not to say that the briefing paper is unworthy  of
investigation;  it certainly ought to have been, and to be looked
into,  at lease as time and resources permit.   But in retrospect
it seems clear that Roswell,  not MJ-12, should have remained the
primary focus.   It is too bad that the issue of the cover-up was
allowed to drift from something substantive (just how substantive
will  become  clear next year when IUR reports in  full  on  what
CUFOS'  Roswell  investigation has uncovered) to a document  sent
anonymously  and presumably by individuals already implicated  in
what   everyone   now   acknowledges  to   be   the   spread   of
disinformation.  It must also be noted that it was out of the MJ-
12 swamp that the lurid pulp fantasies of John Lear,  Bill Cooper
and  Bill  English  bubbled to the surface.   According  to  Bill
Moore,  himself a central figure in the MJ-12 controversy,  those
tall  tales about man-eating aliens were cooked up (so to  speak)
by  intelligence-agency  people  seeking further  to  confuse  an
already deluded UFO buff.   Moore acknowledges that he helped the
process  along.   As  he told an audience at  this  year's  MUFON
conference, "The entire story of a secret treaty between the U.S.
government and the aliens,  of exchanges of technology between us
and  the  aliens,  of battles between aliens and  American  armed
forces,   and   of   aliens  allegedly  having  implanted   human
beings...came about as a result of this process.   I know because
I  was  in  a  position to observe much of  this  process  as  it
unfolded and I was providing regular reports on its effectiveness
to some of the very people who were 'doing it'..."
     It  requires  neither imagination nor paranoia  to  conclude
that it was also done to Moore,  who over a period of years  (and
continuing  even now) has been the recipient -- not the only  one
-- of  astonishing but unverifiable tales about  Extraterrestrial
Biological  Entities,  including live ones in government custody.
Moore's  informants,  said  to be  military-intelligence  people,
produced  (despite promises) no documentations for any  of  these
claims,   which   had  at  least  the  advantage  of  being  less
insultingly   illogical  than   Lear-Cooper-English's   brainless
scenario.    As   I  remarked  in  an  earlier  editorial   (IUR,
September/October  1988),  these sorts of claims "make a  certain
hypothetical  sense,"  given  what  might have  followed  from  a
Roswell  incident (such as an attempt to contact the  controlling
intelligences  behind  the  attempt to  contact  the  controlling
intelligences  behind  the  UFO phenomenon to  learn  what  their
purpose  is),  but  "the  evidence supporting  them  is  all  but
nonexistent."
     One  of  the interesting features of the  MJ-12  paper,  not
often remarked on,  is that it is not in concordance with the EBE
story.  As the EBE story (or at least a part of it) goes, in 1949
one  EBE  survived a UFO crash and spent the next three years  at
Los Alamos before expiring in 1952.   Supposedly EBE was blabbing
the  full story of the ET visitation to his captors  -- a  detail
curiously  absent from the Eisenhower briefing document.   At the
same  time,  as  IUR readers will learn  in  future  issues,  the
briefing  paper's  account  of the Roswell event  is  essentially
accurate.   That is,  I suppose, of some small comfort to whoever
still  harbors  hope  for  the  briefing  paper's   authenticity.
Another small source of comfort has been the absence of any truly
compelling arguments against the briefing document itself, though
plenty  of  arguments pretending to be that have  been  advanced.
(As  already  noted,  an  MJ-12-related  document,  part  of  the
briefing paper's appendix,  Truman's supposed September 24, 1947,
order  bringing Majestic-12 into being,  does appear vulnerable.)
Friedman  and  Moore have done a good job of  showing  where  the
critics  are  mistaken,  but  even they concede this  is  not  an
argument  for  the briefing paper's authenticity.   It is  always
possible,  and in this case maybe even probable, that the critics
are right even if their reasons are wrong.
     Perhaps  the most surprising claim the briefing paper  makes
is that Donald Menzel, Harvard astronomer and archdebunker of UFO
reports, was a member of Majestic-12, thus making him a conscious
agent  of an anti-UFO disinformation campaign.   This  remarkable
assertion  led  Friedman to conduct the sorts of  inquiries  into
Menzel's  background  that  no one  had  done  before.   Friedman
learned   ("the   Secret  Life  of  Donald   H.   Menzel,"   IUR,
January/February 1988) that Menzel possessed the highest security
clearances  and  was well-placed  within  the  U.S.  intelligence
community  -- just as he would have had to be to be privy to  the
Ultimate  Secret.   This amounts to a finding of the  consistent-
with-the-hypothesis  variety,  but  nothing more.   No hint  that
Menzel secretly took UFOs seriously has come to light,  and those
who  knew him best,  including his wife,  reject the idea out  of
hand.   To this Friedman rejoins,  reasonably enough, that Menzel
would  not have breathed a word of this even to  family  members.
Yet Menzel's ferocious UFOobia was far in excess of what he would
have  had to exhibit to lead the press and fellow scientists away
from  the  scent  (not that most even knew there  was  a  scent),
suggesting  that  he was not acting under orders but out  of  the
sort  of  manic  obsession  that  has  fueled  other  sincere  if
misguided debunkers.
     Nonetheless   Menzel's  appearance  on  the  MJ-12  list  is
undeniably  curious.   Presumably  it means  something.   It  may
indicate,  since  practically nothing of Menzel's secret life  in
intelligence was known before Friedman's investigation,  that the
hoax  (if  hoax it was) was perpetrated by individuals  privy  to
classified  information.   In other words,  this is  no  ordinary
hoax;  it  had a serious purpose connected with national-security
concerns.  On the other hand, the hoaxer may have erred in making
one  extraordinary  claim too many.   Amusingly,  it is  not  the
briefing  document's  claim  of  a UFO crash  that  is  the  most
difficult to believe;  it is the claim that Menzel knew about it.
The  evidence  for the crash is substantial,  that  for  Menzel's
knowledge  of it is nil.   A friend of mine once  suggested  that
perhaps  Menzel's  name  was put on the list for  a  reason:   to
assure any knowledgeable person within the intelligence community
that the briefing paper was not,  after all,  a real leak of real
information.
     None of this is to say,  of course,  that the MJ-12 briefing
document  has been proven to be bogus,  or that no  such  project
(whether called MJ-12 or something else) could have existed.  But
it is to say that,  despite the enormous,  even heroic,  research
efforts  of  Stan  Friedman,  the issue is as  unresolved  -- and
probably unresolvable -- as ever.  It could be true.  It could be
one  of  those exceedingly rare instances in human  history  when
diamonds  are found floating in cesspools.   That doesn't  happen
often.   More conceivably (though also unprovably),  the briefing
paper  was hatched as part of a scheme to distract  investigators
form pursuits truly threatening to the cover-up.
     To  all  present  appearances  (though  future  events   may
radically alter our perception), the MJ-12 controversy has gotten
us  nowhere,  maybe  less  than nowhere,  since it  has  consumed
valuable  time  that might have been spent more  productively  on
other  matters,   not  the  least  of  them  Roswell.   From  the
beginning,  it is true,  CUFOS encouraged the MJ-12 investigation
and  IUR  has  reported,   and  will  continue  to  report,   new
developments.   But  ufology's resources are limited and I  think
most would agree,  after 2 1/2 years, that MJ-12 has eaten up too
many of them already.  Unless Friedman's Fund report brings forth
major new evidence, all of us would be well-advised to move on to
something else.  If an answer to the MJ-12 puzzle is to be found,
perhaps  we'll  get  to  it one  day,  while  we're  looking  for
something else.   But as a whole new chapter in the Roswell  saga
begins  to unfold,  we have better things to do than to pursue  a
wild goose across a barren landscape.  --  Jerome Clark
