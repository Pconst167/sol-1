BETHLEHEM, Pa. - Steelworker Keith Grifner says he's never been the same since 
space aliens abducted him and stole every drop of blood in his body - and 
replaced it with a mysterious yellow fluid!

The 41-year-old man says he was kidnapped while driving his pickup along a 
backcountry road at about 8:30 p.m. on the night of August 3.

He says he saw an enormous white light hovering over the road about a mile 
ahead of him and watched in amazement as the light moved swiftly toward him.

Seconds later he heard a high pitched buzzing noise, he says - and the next 
thing he knew he was yanked out of his truck and lifted through the air by a 
mysterious force.

"I was sucked right into a great big ovalshaped aircraft that was just hanging 
there in the air over my truck," Grifner recalls. "Then I was inside this 
weird padded room, lying on a table with four little space creatures staring 
at me.

"The spacemen had huge eyes and almost no nose or mouth. They didn't talk, but 
I could hear their voices somehow inside my head.

"The told me not to be afraid and that I wouldn't be hurt if I cooperated."

While a frightened Grifner trembled in teror, the space creatures took out a 
giant syringe attached to a vacuum device and clamped it to his right arm. The 
apparatus drew every drop of blood out of the terrified widower's body - while 
another machine attached to his left arm pumped him full of a bright yellow 
liquid.

During the procedure, Grifner lost consciousness. He awoke in the cab of his 
pickup, which was parked at the side of the road. He had splitting headache 
but otherwise felt normal.

"But when I got home I noticed my color was changed and I had this yellow, 
sickly complexion," said Grifner.

"I went right to my doctor the next day and told him what had happened. He 
didn't believe me at first, but he went ahead and tested me and he found my 
veins were filled with a sticky yellow fluid.

"Since then he's given me transfusions and everything, but the yellow stuff 
always comes back."

The UFO abductee says he fells more energetic since his bizarre transfusion 
and now needs only about two hours sleep a night. 

Otherwise, he says, his body seems to funciton normally. "I do get some 
strange food cravings, though," says Grifner.

"Last week all I ate was squid. I couldn't get enough squid.

"Weird, isn't it?"

Grifner's personal physician has ordered a series of tests to try to find out 
just what actually has happened to his circulatory system, the steelworker 
says.
