                              THE ENTITIES
        Initial Findings of the Abduction Transcription Project

                  A MUFON Special Report by Dan Wright
                                Part II
Part 1 of 5

        This is the second of a two-part report summarizing 317
transcripts of hypnosis sessions and interviews, comprising 95 separate
cases, garnered from 13 abduction researchers.

        Part I addressed abduction sites; precognition of episodes and
familiarity with certain beings; vehicle types; transporting the
subject; features and odors inside; recognition of other subjects; and
descriptions of entity features, their garments and locomotion.

        This segment describes subject restraints; alteration of
consciousness, mind probes and other observations; the "leader of the
pack"; entity voice qualities, communications and human-like behaviors;
devices and instruments used, samples taken and resulting pain: sexual
and reproductive factors; and physical after-effects.

SUBJECT RESTRAINTS

        Of the 95 cases in this study, 61% of the subjects were
convinced they were restrained in some manner, especially while lying on
a table in the vehicle. Reasonably inferred, most of the reminder felt
the same effect, though not expressing it afterward.

        Four individuals said they were physically strapped onto a
table. In 51 cases an unseen force "paralyzed" the subject. while in 22
there was a "numbing" (or "heavy") effect, either overall or on the
extremities. Certainly, there is an overlap among reports of paralysis
and numbing, though the force applied might vary.

ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS

        At some point in most abductions scenarios, the subject sensed a
change in his/her conscious state.

        Sixteen subjects related an out-of-body mindset - not connected
to any such artificial state that some hypnotists use to enhance a
person's memories. Phrasings such as "aerial view," "away from my body,"
and "popped out" bring the point home.

        Sleep was induced suddenly in 23 cases. Sometimes it was onboard
the craft and apparently just prior to a medical procedure. Often it was
the subject's last recollection of the event before departure or after
being returned to bed.

        The most repeated manipulation of human consciousness, however,
has been a drugged-like state. Subjects recall having been "dazed,"
"confused," "catatonic," "stunned" or "in shock" through much or all of
an episode. This condition was articulated in 49 cases and probably
occurred in far more.

WATCHING & STARING

        Intent observation of the subject aboard the craft is a very
common factor in abductions. David Jacobs characterized the element of
"staring" at the subject from very close range as a "mindscan"
procedure. (1)

        From a fair reading of the 317 transcripts, it is often
difficult to ascertain whether the observation related was "staring" or
rather a sentry's watchful gaze from a reasonable distance.
Nevertheless, the attempt is made to divide this factor into "watching"
and the more intrusive "staring."

        Half (47) of all subjects in the study indicated that one or
more beings were "watching" him/her intently at some point. This might
also have occurred in many more cases wherein the subject was unaware of
same.

        In 39 cases, the subject felt a close-up "staring" by a
particular entity, who was always "the one in charge."  In some of these
- but only a relative few - the subject conveyed that the purpose was to
probe the mind. Regardless of intent, it can be said with assurance that
most subjects did not especially enjoy the experience.

        Conversely in seven cases the subject was left alone longer than
momentarily. None attempted to escape.


THE LEADER

        In nearly one third (29) of the study's cases, a particular
entity was identified as having a supervising role. On occasion, this
status was accorded the one in charge of what might be called an "away
team" conducting the actual abduction. More often, it was either a
"doctor" onboard the ship who conducted extensive or intricate medical
procedures or an "old one" who oversaw the proceedings.

        Whatever prompted the subject's conclusion this being was
clearly a "boss," And that denotes the basic notion of rank among some -
or all - groups of alien visitors. Parenthetically, such entities in
charge, likened to many human doctors and executives, were often found
to be impatient, humorless or both.

VERBAL COMMUNICATION

        Two-thirds of these initial 95 cases included mention of
verbalized, entity-to-human communication. Virtually without exception,
telepathy was the medium.

        Some subjects have related messages which, they are convinced,
were conveyed in perfect English. Others have struggled to explain
receiving the (perhaps pre-lingual) essence of an entity's thoughts,
which the subject filled in with nouns, verbs, adjectives and the like.

        In a few prominent cases, the subject recalls having had a long
and wide-ranging discourse with a particular being. Apart from those,
the content of communications by abductors was quite structured
and of three basic types: procedural, nonprocedural but related to
the event, and post-event related.

        Procedural (or instructional) communications were always brief
and directly related to the subject's compliance concerning a medical or
other technical matter at hand. Commands such as "calm down," "don't
move" and "feed the baby" were typical and associated with 26 cases.

        Nonprocedural mentions still concerned the event sequence but
were not directly connected to a specific procedure. Reassurance of the
subject (e.g., "it's all right" or "we won't hurt you") was by far the
most repetitious, offered in 35 cases. "Come with us," "stay here,"
"time to go back" and "sleep now"  were likewise common. In total, such
comments were uttered in 46 cases.

        Post-event-related communications were found in 23 cases:
"Forget" or "can't tell" (anyone); the opposite, "remember" (the
encounter); as well as vague instructions to perform some future
"mission".

VOICE QUALITY

        A fifth of all subjects in the study remarked on the audible
voice of one or more being, always entity-to-entity communication.
Reported in six cases each were whisperings and chattering (the latter
denoting a language seemingly without vowels). Five other subjects said
they heard low-pitched sounds made up of either grunts or mumbles.

        Importantly, though suppositions were made on occasion, no
subject claimed to understand any remarks made in the entities' own
language.

NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION

        Nearly two out of five cases (37 in total) indicated receipt of
instructions or other information in a nonlingual form. These can be
divided into four categories: gestures, images, showings, and symbols.

        Gesturing was evident in just four cases. In each, a being held
its hands up or motioned to the subject in a self-evident fashion.

        Images - variously on a screen, in holographic form, or
projected into the subject's mind - were far more regular in the
sequence of events, appearing in 28 cases.

        In nine of these, animal (e.g., owl or deer) was represented,
especially to subjects in their childhood, apparently to disguise an
entity's appearance at the outset of the abduction sequence.

        While onboard, twelve subjects saw images of the Earth in its
past or future, from dinosaurs to earthquakes, devastated rainforests
and nuclear wars.

        In ten cases the subject was given images of an extraterrestrial
world - rocky desert terrains, an oddly colored sky, whole planets or
solar systems.

        The category "showings," occurring in a third of all cases,
denotes one or more tangible things intentionally shown to the subject
or, in a few instances, a tour of the ship. The most dramatic of these
involved "hybrid" infants - or incubators containing fetuses in
gestation - as viewed by 17 subjects. In 12 cases, the subject witnessed
hybrid (post-infant) children or adults.

HUMAN-LIKE BEHAVIOR

         Alien visitors are usually said to be stone-faced. But,
contrary to the widely held idea that they are without feelings,
displays of human-like emotions (positive and/or negative) have been
conveyed in over half (54%) of the study's cases.

        On the negative side, an entity's anger or arguing - with the
subject or other entities - was displayed in 12 cases. Fear of the
subject was deduced in seven; frustration, sadness, or threatening
demeanor in two cases each; and violent behavior in one.

        Positive emotions were expressed in large numbers: caring,
compassion or love in 25 cases; friendliness in 23; humor (including
laughter or joking) in eight, and pleasure in reaction to the subject's
behavior in six.

        Ten subjects made particular mention that a "leader" maintained
a stark detachment, showing no emotion whatsoever.

        Table 7 details these and other behaviors.

DEVICES & INSTRUMENTS

        For purposes of this study, a "device" is a machine, seemingly
intended for a particular medical procedure t. (e.g., scanning the
subject's prone body). It is generally seen attached to a wall, on a
mobile cart or lowered from the ceiling. "Instrument," by contrast,
denotes a small, hand-held implement such as a syringe with attached
needle.

        One or more devices were noticed by 46 subjects, while 44
described an instrument. Taken together, devices and/or instruments
were present in 61% of all cases.

        It can safely be said that, apart from poking the subject's
vertebrae or twisting his/her joints as part of a "check-up," nearly all
medical procedures involve a machine, instrument or both. Based on only
the transcripts, however; attempts to describe such tools or their
specific purposes would be highly speculative.

SAMPLES

        Twelve subjects recalled that beings collected tissue or other
samples. Ankles, arms, feet and the inside of the mouth were scraped;
nails and locks of hair were clipped: and incisions or "scoop"-type
gouges were employed to remove flesh. While many more subjects may have
been unaware of such collections due to altered state of consciousness.
it is odd that only this small number had specific memories thereof.

PAIN

        Agonizing pain is widely thought to be a standard feature of
CE-4 cases. Yet, in 58% of the study's cases, none was ever reported.

        Among the 40 cases wherein pain was a factor, no one area of the
human anatomy was a standard target. The most frequent were:

         * cranium - 13
         * nose/sinus - 5
         * ear - 5
         * back/kidney - 7
         * vagina/uterus - 12
         * leg/knee - 11

        Localized pain may indicate an implant or excision. Moreover,
numerous transcripts imply that small objects have been implanted or
tissue removed without any discomfort to the subject. Readers are
cautioned not to draw unwarranted conclusions.

SEXUAL/REPRODUCTIVE ELEMENT

        Nearly half of all subjects recalled, as part of their overall
experiences, one or more events related to human reproductive systems
and sexuality. These included harvesting sperm from males and ova from
females, fetus abortion, and moments of sexual orgasm.

        Seven adult and teenage males in the study remembered an
apparatus placed over the genitals, followed by immediate erection and
discharge. For most, the episode was not recalled as pleasurable. It
bears mention that, in 30 other cases involving a male subject, no such
procedure was mentioned.

        By contrast, among the 68 females in the study, 43 recalled a
gynecological or obstetric procedure. Given the subjects' usually
altered state at the time, it would not be appropriate to speculate in
this report on the purposes for such intrusions.

        Orgasm or lesser sexual pleasure, by either men or women, was a
reported element in 13 cases.

POST-EVENT EFFECTS

        Almost one-third of the subjects reported some type of physical
effect as a direct result of one abduction episode or another. Nose
bleeds resulted in 13 cases and scars in 12, half of those on a leg or
knee. [Note: General reporting of nose bleeds and scars apart from
known encounters have been excluded from these totals.]

        Curiously, in four cases the subject was either told by an
entity or separately concluded that the beings' "reconstructive surgery"
had repaired some serious medical problem.

SUMMARY

        In this two-part report, an initial attempt has been made to
bring the average MUFON UFO Journal reader "up to speed." To the author,
one conclusion and some fundamental questions are immediately evident.

        Conclusion: Numerous entity types have been visiting our planet
with some regularity. What is not very evident from the data herein, but
somewhat clearer from the transcripts per se, is that entities are
grouped into two or more types working together in the same craft,
usually with a strict ranking of duties.

QUESTIONS:

        1. Do grey-, white-, tan-, dark-, blue- and green-toned
entities, not to mention extremely tall Nordics, have similar agendas?

        2. Are differences in evolutionary development suggested by the
number and types of digits on entities' hands?  By their ability or
inability to self-levitate? Between those who use "mindscan" (2) and
others who do not (or cannot)?

        How does one justify two starkly contrasting impressions that
are firmly held by many subjects after multiple CE-4 episodes?

         * A considerable number fervently believes the visitors exude
love and compassion for them as subjects and all of humanity.

         * A smaller but enraged group is equally convinced that the
intruders are fundamentally evil.

        The new computer purchased jointly by MUFON and the Fund for UFO
Research is the most powerful beast on the block. In the days (and
particularly the late nights!) ahead, it will be working overtime,
assisting the participating researchers to sort through all the data in
ways that were never before attempted.

        As the first 317 transcripts begin to stretch toward a thousand,
and the current 95 separate cases approach 300, we will be in a better
position to answer these nettlesome questions. Let us all cross our
fingers that we have enough time left.

        Special thanks go to Mark Williams, systems coordinator for the
project, who integrated the computer system, customized its software,
and created the insightful graphics in this report. And heartfelt praise
is due the dozens of dedicated transcriptionists, without whom this
information could never have been developed.
