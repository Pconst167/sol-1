Oklahoma MUFON:                                             
                                                            
On September 7, 1992, at approximately 2 AM, in (near) the town
of Cushing, OK, Mr. and Mrs. _________ were settling down for the
evening.  They had been watching video movies while resting in
bed, in their double-wide mobile home.  Mrs. ______ rolled over
to look out to the yard when she saw that the sky was lit up
beyond the trees.                   
                                                            
She brought this to her husband's attention, who is a retired
U.S. Air Force Air Traffic Controller.  With his curiosity
aroused, he left the bedroom to look out another window for a
better view.  He went from window to window on the west side of
his mobile home.                           
                                                            
Once he found the best view of the object, which appeared to be
the source of the light, he was able to see a disc-shaped object,
tilted approximately 45 degrees from the lay of the land.  Mr. 
_____ described red and white lights, alternating around the rim
or edge of the object.  He stated that the lights appeared to be
flashing in sequence, giving the lights the appearance that they
were moving in a "clockwise" direction.                          

          
The size of the disc appeared to be 2 times the size of a small
home.  It hovered motionlessly, without a sound no ascension, no
decension, no sideways movement.              
                                                            
As he continued to watch the object, it appeared to get smaller
in size, as if it were moving away in a south westerly direction.

Then suddenly it disappeared, along with the lighted sky.        

                             
During this time, Mrs. _____ called her mother-in-law, who lives
approximately 1500 feet to the west of their home.  Mrs. _____
told her to not turn on her lights and to look carefully out the
windows.  The mother-in-law was only able to see the lighted sky,
not the object, through the heavily tree-lined area around her
home.                            
                                                            
The whole episode lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  The
witnesses reported that nothing unusual happened electrically or
with their family dog.  There was a motion detection security
light system, which was not set off.  A "quiet" sound was heard. 

                                 
                                                            
=END=
