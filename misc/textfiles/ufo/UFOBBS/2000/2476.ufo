There are an estimated 100 million cameras of all types in the hands of the
American public.  And so there is a grain of validity to the charge by UFO
skeptics that, if our claims are valid, then more clear photos ought to surface.

Countering this claim to some extent is the fact that most people own a fixed-
focus camera, don't know much at all about photography and, if the camera is
handy at the crucial moment, usually have slow (100 or 200 ISO) film inserted
for daylight shots.

Further, the great majority of camera owners don't realize that even the best
flash attachment is useful only up to about 40 feet.  No doubt, photography
professionals smile on New year's night when tens of thousands of flashes are
seen in the stands during half-time of the Orange Bowl football game.  Another
"flash" of ignorance occurred on a summer night in 1989 in Gulf Breeze, Florida.
Two young women followed a disc-shaped object near the Pensacola Bay.  When it
suddenly darted in front of their car, the rider grabbed her camera and snapped
a picture - with the flash on.  What they received back from the processor was a
massive white reflection on the film from the flash bouncing off the inside of
the windshield.

Occasionally, as in the situation of repeated events in the same locale, you or
the witness may have a camera at the ready.  In that instance, keep the
following in mind:

1. If at all possible, employ a 35 mm camera, as the images on film are likely
to be sharper and the background in better perspective.  Inexpensive
"instamatic" cameras tend to condense the actual distances of structures and
terrain in the view-finder.  Unless the person is quite adept with the
instrument, it is best to leave it on the all-automatic setting, allowing the
camera to determine distance and focus.

2. Presuming dark or nearly dark conditions, use film with a high ISO (formerly
ASA) rating - at least 400.  Film with an ISO of 1000 or 1600 is exclusively for
low light.

3. With high-ISO film, the camera is more sensitive to motion, most importantly
from the photographers own hands.  One way to eliminate that inadvertent motion
is to use a tripod.  However, as we all know too well, genuinely anomalous
objects tend to remain in one location only momentarily.  So, setting up a
tripod is usually impractical.  In it's absence, one can minimize the motion by
bracing the camera against something handy - a car roof, fence post, even the
shoulder of a fellow witness.

4. Before the expected event, take a few shots of the area as a control.  These
can assist in the later analysis as well as argue against any claim that the
anomalous image in question was hoaxed.

5. Take more than one photograph.  If the light/object is moving, shoot at least
once with the
camera motionless, then also while panning the object (moving the camera to keep
the image in the view-finder).

6. If at all possible, capture some fixed structure (e.g. part of a building, a
utility pole or tree limb) in the foreground.  This greatly assists the
analytical effort.  If the background consists only of sky, it is virtually
impossible to determine the objects size and distance from the photographic
image.

7. Afterward, locate the precise spot where the photographer stood.  Then,
carefully measure the distance from that spot to the point(s) of the fixed
structure(s) shown in each frame.

8. With the witness' assistance, complete a MUFON form 8, "Photographic Cases".
The camera model, it's inherent capacities and that of any accessories, as well
as the type of film is critical to document for meaningful analysis.

9. If the photo/videotape was shot at night, take daylight photos of the same
scene while standing at the original spot of the witness.

10. Obtain the print(s) and especially the negative(s) from the witness,
ensuring that all originals will be returned unharmed.

11. Forward the original photo materials along with the Form 8 and your case
report to International case director Walt Andrus.  He will forward the
film/tape to Dr. Bruce Maccabee or another party appropriate.  Copies of all
should be sent here for preliminary evaluation.

By the way, keep a camera loaded at all times.  You never know...
