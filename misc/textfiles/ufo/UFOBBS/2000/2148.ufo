			    UFO CLASSIFICATIONS

RELATIVELY DISTANT SIGHTINGS

NL     NOCTURNAL LIGHT     These are sightings of well-defined lights in the
       night sky whose appearance and/or motions are not explainable in terms
       of conventional light sources. The lights appear most often as red,
       orange or white. They represent the largest groups of UFO reports.

DD     DAYLIGHT DISKS      Daytime sightings are generally of oval or disk-
       shaped metalic objects. They can appear high in the sky or close to the
       ground (as elsewhere) and are often reported to hoover. They can seem
       to appear with astounding speed.

RV     RADAR/VISUALS       Of especial significance are unidentified "blipps"
       on radar screens which co-incide with, and confirm, simultaneous visual
       sightings by the same or other witness(es).

RELATIVELY CLOSE SIGHTINGS  (within 200 yards)

CE1    CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FIRST KIND       Though the witness observes a
       UFO nearby, there appears to be no intervention with either the witness
       or the environment.

CE2    CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE SECOND KIND      These encounters include de-
       tails of interaction between the UFO and the environment, which may vary
       from interference with car ignition systems and electronic gear to im-
       prints or burns on the ground and physical effects on plants, animals,
       and humans.

CE3    CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND       In this category, OCCUPANTS
       from a UFO (entities of more or less humanlike appearance now referred
       to as "HUMANOIDS," or nonhuman creatures) have been reported. There is
       usually no direct contact or communication with the witness, but there
       have been some reports, increasing in recent years, of incidents in-
       volving very close contact with, and even temporary detainment of, the
       witness(es).


Ted Bloecher has taken these classifications a little further with the follow-
humanoid/interaction descriptions as a continuation of the CE3 category.

TYPE A    Entity is observed inside object only (the true OCCUPANT), through
	  doors, ports et cetera. Association is explicit.

TYPE B    Entity is observed getting into and/or out of object (or the "egress-
	  ed" occupant).  Association is explicit.

TYPE C    Entity is seen only in vicinity of object, not entering or leaving
	  it. Association is implicit.

TYPE D    Entity is observed only, although there is general UFO activity in
	  the area at the time. Association is circumstantial.

TYPE E    Entity is observed independent of object and there is no record of
	  UFO activity at that time. Association is negative.

TYPE F    A close encounter with an object, but no entity seen; however, voices
	  are heard or messages received. Association is implicit.

TYPE G    ABDUCTION or "on board" experience by witness, with entities usually
	  present; if not, their presence is implicit.
