NASA lost radio contact with its Mars Observer spacecraft on Saturday August 
21, 1993, just days before it was expected to enter into a circular orbit 400 
km above the surface of the planet.  Orbit insertion was supposed  to have 
occured on Tuesday August 24th at about 1:30 PM Pacific Daylight  Time.  
The spacecraft was expected to begin global surface mapping of Mars  on 
December 16th that would have lasted an entire Martian year of 687 Earth  
days.  Various attempts were made to re-establish contact with the spacecraft, 
but  so far the Mars Observer has remained silent.  NASA engineers believe a  
transistor in the satellite's clock failed, rendering the Mars Observer  
"brain-dead" and radio silent.  It seems improbable that the spacecraft  
automatically entered into orbit around Mars, and probably missed its  
destination completely.  The Mars Observer was launched on September 25, 1992 
on a Titan III rocket from Cape Canveral Air Force Station, Florida.  
On July 26, 1993 at 8:52 PM PDT, the Mars Observer returned its first image 
of Mars when it was 5.8  million kilometers from the red planet.  That image 
was taken using the  spacecraft's high resolution, narrow angle telescopic 
camera.    In 1976 an unmanned NASA Viking spacecraft sucessfully photographed 
the  surface of Mars from an altitude of approximately 1700 kilometers.  The  
objective of the Viking mission was to search for evidence of intelligent  
life on Mars, either now or in the past.  Image 35A72 taken by Viking-1 and  
received by the Jet Propulsion Lab showed a mile-long, 1500 foot high  
humanoid "face" staring into eternity on the surface of Mars.  It was later  
dismissed without investigation by NASA as a "trick of light and shadow"  and 
filed away.  Frame 70A13 taken over the same area with a higher sun-angle 
showed the same feature in addition to a pyramid-like structure approximately 
16 kilometers southwest of the "face".  In 1980, Vicent DiPietro and Gregory 
Molenaar, imaging engineers under  contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center on another project, stumbled  across these Viking images.  After 
further investigation they discovered  folds and horizontal stripes on the 
"headpiece" or "helmet" of the face  which resembled those of Egyptian 
Pharaohs, symmetrical cheekbones, an eye  socket, eyeball, and pupil, nose, 
mouth, and teeth.  The facial proportions  were found to be similar to those 
of early man.  DiPietro and Molenaar  published their findings and 
conclusions in 1980 and were stonewalled by  the planetary science community 
for doing so.  In a feature article in "Soviet Life" magazine published in 
1984, the  Russians revealed their own fascination with the Martian "sphinx" 
and five-sided pyramids found in the Viking photos.  In an effort to carry 
out their own investigations, the former USSR launched  Phobos I and Phobos 
II, two unmanned satellites to the planet Mars on July  12, 1988.  The reason 
for launching two craft was for redundancy in case one malfunctioned.  Phobos 
I was lost after it received a bad command during its  journey to Mars and 
fell silent when controllers tried to re-acquire it on  the way.  Phobos II 
arrived in January 1989 and entered an orbit around Mars  as the first phase 
towards its real destination, a small Martian moon called  Phobos. The 
mission was flawless until the craft aligned itself with Phobos. On March 28, 
1989, an elliptical object was detected to be moving towards the satellite 
seconds before it failed.  All indications were that the elliptical object 
had collided with the satellite which was now dead and left spinning out of 
control.  On March 28, 1989 Tass, the official Soviet news agency stated: 
"Phobos II  failed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after completing 
an operation  yesterday around the Martian moon Phobos.  Scientists at 
mission control have been unable to establish stable radio contact."  The 
next day a top official of the Soviet Space Agency (Glavkosmos) stated:  
"Phobos II is 99% lost for good."  It is important to note that he stated  
the entire satellite was gone and not that just radio contact was lost with  
it.  On March 30, 1989 at 4:41 PM EST, the Associated Press released the  
following statement: "Soviet research centers are now trying to interpret  
so far 'unexplained optical phonomena' on the pictures of the Martian  
surface.  The pictures show an inigmatic strip 23-25 miles wide and a  
large spindle-shaped formation."  On March 31, 1989 headlines dispatched 
by the Moscow correspondents of  the European News Agency (EFE) stated: 
"Phobos 2 Captured Strange Photos  of Mars Before Losing Contact With It's 
Base.  Vremya revealed yesterday  that the space probe Phobos II, which was 
orbiting above Mars when Soviet  scientists lost contact with it on Monday, 
had photographed an unidentified  object on the Martian surface seconds 
before losing contact."  Scientists  described the unidentified object as 
a thin ellipse 20 kilometers in length. It was further stated that the photos 
could not be an illusion because they  were captured by 2 different color 
cameras as well as cameras taking  infrared shots.  One controller at the 
Kaliningrad control center concluded that the Phobos II probe was left 
spinning out of control, a result of being struck  or shot.  In the October 
19, 1989 issue of Nature Magazine, Soviet scientists concluded that the craft 
could be spinning because it was impacted.  Not since the NASA Viking missions 
in 1976 has there been a successful  unmanned mission to Mars.  NASA's Mars 
Observer is simply the latest in a  series of spacecraft destined for Mars 
that failed unexpectedly just prior  to reaching the planet.    The mystery 
continues.
