 ----- INCUMBENT SHERIFF PREVAILS IN LOCAL ELECTION -----

On Nov. 8, incumbent Lincoln County Sheriff Dahl Bradfield handily 
defeated his challenger Don Brown.  That could mean four more 
years of secret Air Force "rent-a-cop" agreements, deputies 
harassing journalists and confiscating film without due process, 
and continued dismal confidence in law enforcement throughout the 
county.  But, hey, weÕre sanguine.  The people have spoken, 58 to 
42 percent.  An election is the purest expression of the public 
will, and thereÕs no arguing with those numbers.

We canÕt claim that the electorate was ill-informed.  During his 
six years in office, Bradfield seemed to have committed every 
lapse of professional judgment in the book, and his heavy-handed 
"God Squad" of unsupervised deputies had pissed off a large 
portion of the county.  We and some of allies took out an ad in 
the Lincoln County Record to remind voters of his biggest gaffs 
and their enormous cost to the county [may be available at the FTP 
or WWW sites], and we thought our logic was flawless.  All the 
Sheriff could offer in his ads were a few trumped-up endorsements 
from law enforcement organizations, one of which, the Las Vegas 
Sun reported, hardly knew he existed.  The challenger, who was 
formerly a Nevada State Police chief and well-regarded Sheriff in 
Washington State, seemed like a breath of fresh air who could 
restore faith in local law enforcement.  In the weeks approaching 
the election, we worked hard behind the scenes to support his 
campaign, and we were almost ready to count our chickens before 
they hatched until receiving a call late on election night 
shattering our faith in humanity.

We considered this election an important one.  The big Groom Lake 
base is wholly within Lincoln County, yet returns only trivial 
economic benefits to the community.  A nonexistent base doesn't 
have to pay its taxes and doesn't have to engage in any form of 
community relations.  Being directly downwind of both the Groom 
Lake base and the adjoining Nevada Test Site, county residents 
have been dumped on for years by the federal government.  In the 
days of above ground atomic testing, this meant dangerous levels 
of fallout and a predictable rise in devastating cancers.  Given 
the raw treatment the county has received over the years, this 
place ought to be a hotbed of anti-government rhetoric, and it is, 
but that sentiment is rarely translated into action.  

For a piddling contract fee of $50,000 a year, the Sheriff's Dept. 
has essentially taken orders from the Cammo Dudes, seizing film, 
arresting naive trespassers and investigating law-biding tourists 
whenever the anonymous authorities call.  This public police 
department, nominally an open entity responsible to the people, 
has seen no conflict in representing a government agency that 
refuses to acknowledge its own existence.  The Sheriff pulled back 
from film seizures, perhaps temporarily, only when the election 
loomed and negative publicity began to build up in the Las Vegas 
press.

Similarly, the county tax assessor, an ossified 26-year veteran, 
has shown no interest in pursuing the base for the value of 
contractor facilities.  Although the AF itself is not liable for 
local property taxes, the same does not hold for the private 
contractors that largely operate the base.  [See DR#5.]  If they 
occupy a government building, property taxes must be paid on it as 
if it were private land (NRS 361.157).  As it stands, the AF gives 
the county an imaginary assessment every year, most recently $3.2 
million, and the county blindly accepts it, billing the AF for the 
insignificant taxes implied, recently $80,000.  Of course, $3.2 
million wouldn't buy a latrine at a place like Groom, but the 
current assessor's attitude is that if county pushes the AF too 
hard, they might sue or pack up the base and move it elsewhere.  
Legal guidance, which should be provided by the county District 
Attorney, is lackluster at best.  He seems more concerned with 
pursuing Campbell on the obstruction charge [See trial invitation 
below.] than in making the secret base pay its due.

Since the officials who were up for election had also offended the 
electorate in other ways, the prevailing sentiment ought to have 
been "Throw the Bums Out!"  Indeed, that is what we thought we 
heard on the street in the weeks prior to Nov. 8.  What happened, 
in fact, was the opposite:  Every incumbent in major county 
offices was reelected.  The District Attorney ran unopposed, 
apparently because there are not many lawyers willing to come to 
this area.  The Sheriff routed his opponent easily, as did the 
Assessor, Clerk, Treasurer, an incumbent Commissioner and the 
Justices of the Peace (including Nola Holton, who will be trying 
the Campbell case).

Philosophically, we cannot argue with the results.  As an activist 
nipping at the heals of the monolithic Air Force, Psychospy is 
arguing in favor of democratic processes--that the secret base 
should be subject to the same public accountability as any other 
government agency.  We cannot suddenly change our tune when the 
democratic processes let us down.  We believe that every 
community, like every individual, has the right to self-
determination.  The liberties American society holds dear include 
the right to totally screw yourself up if you so choose.  People 
and communities that make good decisions prosper, while those that 
make poor ones fail, and it is not the place of government or us 
aliens to intervene.  As it stands, Lincoln County is a dirt-poor 
backwater, chasing away industry with its high taxes and bloated 
local government and showing little interest in changing.  Like a 
person who drinks himself into a stupor, we can only conclude that 
this is the way the community wants to be.

Still, after expending significant energy on this election, we are 
disappointed in the results and annoyed that we misjudged them so 
badly.  Removing the Sheriff and Assessor from office would have 
been a major blow to the legal and tax immunity of the secret 
base.  The AF would suddenly find itself in a much less friendly 
environment and might have to start paying its due.  We hoped that 
Lincoln County would become a "mouse that roared," demanding 
proper compensation from the feds for hosting this huge and 
potentially dangerous facility.  Now, we expect no more than a 
squeak, and we have been trying our best to figure out what went 
wrong.

The incumbents were of all political affiliations--Democrat, 
Republican and Independent--so the national pro-Republican sweep 
did not explain the results.  If local sentiments seemed 
overwhelmingly anti-incumbent before the election, why did the 
incumbents win?  In Rachel, the Bradfield was voted down almost 
two-to-one.  Why didn't the same happen in the rest of the county?  
To understand the results, we must understand the society here.

 ..... LINCOLN COUNTY DEMOGRAPHICS .....

The remote town of Rachel, with 71 voters, is on the border of Nye 
County, to which it is closely related in culture and attitudes.  
Nye is a place of rugged individualism, where brothels are legal 
and the prevailing philosophy is libertarian--meaning that people 
should be free to conduct themselves however they choose without 
interference from the government.  With Psychospy's liberal 
Eastern roots, we used to be annoyed by the blustering I'll-Take-
Out-Fifty-Federal-Agents-Before-They-Take-Away-My-Guns rhetoric 
found in Nye and Rachel, but now we find it refreshing and even a 
tad appealing.  Nye has been especially aggressive in pursuing its 
own secret base, the Tonopah Test Range, as well as other federal 
facilities within its borders, for taxes and law enforcement 
respect.  During the Cold War, when anti-nuclear protesters 
starting marching en masse across the cattle guard at the entrance 
to the Nevada Test Site, the Nye County Sheriff and D.A. refused 
to handle them, so the feds had to construct tennis court-sized 
cages at Mercury to temporarily house the trespassers.  Because 
the Nye county government actively asserts its rights and defends 
its independence, it doesn't get dumped on the way compliant 
Lincoln County does.

Rachel, we have discovered, is not representative of the rest of 
Lincoln County.  Rachel is a relatively new town, existing for 
only about 30 years and thus composed mostly of "outsiders."  The 
rest of the county has been frozen in time for generations.  The 
main streets of the four major towns, Caliente, Panaca, Alamo and 
Pioche, have changed little in the past fifty years.  The absence 
of economic development has helped preserved the county's 
historical sites, but it has also meant no significant influx of 
new ideas or new blood.

Culturally, Lincoln County is not part of Nevada but of Utah.  
Except for Rachel, the county is overwhelmingly Mormon.  
Mormonism, or Latter Day Saints, is a religion of great mystery to 
the outside world, known for its secret rites and a colorful 
history intertwined with the American West.  Although Psychospy is 
agnostic, we regard religion as one of the unalienable liberties 
that an outsider has no right to interfere in.  What concerns us 
about Mormonism is not its belief structure but how it interacts 
with rest of the world.  Even then, we are not seeking to 
criticize, only to explain and understand.

LDS culture is very close-knit and upholds a firm respect for 
authority.  "Family values" are paramount, and to help preserve 
these ideals, the church does not shy away from active involvement 
in all aspects of society, including business, education and 
politics.  Perhaps because the group was persecuted in its early 
days, Mormons tend toward an "us-against-them" attitude similar to 
that of Judaism.  LDS is a society that pulls together against 
real and perceived threats.  In practical terms, this means that 
when the church's interests are seen as at risk in an election, 
Mormons tend to vote as a block under the guidance of church 
authorities.

In the Nov. 8 election, the incumbents had nothing in common 
except that they were mostly Mormon, while the challengers were 
mostly non-Mormon.  Had the nascent anti-incumbent sentiment been 
allowed to express itself, the church might have lost political 
power in the county, resulting, it might be perceived, in the 
degeneration of public morality.  Was the election in fact pre-
ordained?  From secondhand sources we have heard of local Mormons 
quietly expressing their displeasure at being told by their 
bishops how to vote but who obeyed the orders anyway.  Evidently, 
God is omniscient and has many human spies.  We have not spoken to 
any of these Mormon's directly, so the claim is unproven.  
Generally, Mormons don't talk to non-Mormons about the affairs of 
their church any more than workers talk about Area 51.

We were unimpressed, however, by a candidate's night we attended 
at a high school shortly before the election.  It was presided 
over by the bishop of the local LDS ward.  We knew he was a bishop 
even before being told because he had that air of moral rectitude.  
In his introduction, the bishop said, in effect, that there were 
no conflicts in Lincoln County, and as if to prove the point no 
debate between candidates or questions from the audience were 
permitted.  This meant, of course, that no embarrassing questions 
could be posed to the incumbents regarding their past performance 
and newcomers couldn't show their strengths in a direct exchange.  
Candidates were reduced to bland three minute statements at the 
podium.  Given that the candidates had already visited most voters 
door-to-door, we didn't see the purpose of a candidate's night if 
the candidates couldn't challenge each other.

The Sheriff, an overweight, young-looking man, seemed to have 
nothing to offer in his three minutes except that he had taken 
some law enforcement courses and had instituted a 911 telephone 
system.  Like many of the other candidates, he had grown up in 
Lincoln County and attended Southern Utah College in nearby Cedar 
City.  In comparison, his opponent, tall, thin and in his 60s, 
seemed a paragon of worldliness and maturity.  He recounted his 
experience as a law enforcement administrator in a series of 
prestigious posts outside the county.  "Good show!" we thought to 
ourselves as he passed the two minute mark.  The challenger then 
went on to explain that recently he had dedicated himself to 
"Vampire 2000," an organization of law enforcement officers 
fighting the "new order" and the encroachment of federal control.  
We began sinking slowly into our seat as the challenger proclaimed 
that he would tolerate no restrictions on assault rifles in this 
county, but murmurs of approval from the audience picked us up 
again.

The strangest appearance of the evening was that of the District 
Attorney, who although he was running unopposed was game enough to 
offer his three minute resume.  Given that a part of the DA's job 
is to argue cases in court, he seemed surprisingly weak as a 
public speaker.  He is apparently no intellectual slouch, however, 
having attended Stanford University followed by a law degree at 
the University of Florida and a stint in corporate law in Miami.  
A non-Mormon in his mid-30s who ought to have a better grasp of 
democratic principals than most natives, he seemed to us to be 
misplaced soul, and we wondered what made him tick.  The one-man 
DA's office both prosecutes criminal cases and serves as legal 
counsel to county government.  As an elected official, his office 
is independent and responsible only to the voters, but you 
wouldn't know it from his past performance, in which he has pretty 
much toed the line of the Sheriff's Dept.  Since his position is 
secure, he ought to be beholden to no one and free to do what is 
right for the county, but so far he has not lived up to that 
promise.

As stated, we cannot prove that the incumbent landslide was the 
result of the Mormon majority voting as a block.  There were 
certainly other factors at work.  In a long-established county 
with little population turnover and only 2300 voters, it is 
possible for everyone to be related to everyone else.  Indeed, a 
glance at the tiny Lincoln County phone book (18 pages) reveals a 
disproportionate number of repeated last names.  If you take the 
Sheriff and his extended family and personal allies, add those of 
the Undersheriff, whose position is also threatened, and the 
families and cliques of all the various deputies who fear a loss 
of their current freedom or job security....  Given that this is 
one of the largest per-capita police forces in the country in one 
of the poorest counties, you could have a majority right there.  
One fact is certain:  In the Sheriff's hometown of Panaca, where 
his family ties are deepest and, coincidentally, the Mormon Church 
is strongest, he was also reelected by the biggest margin, almost 
three-to-one.

Panaca was also the source, according to the postmark, of the only 
hate mail we received as result of the election.  (We've received 
more from UFO buffs who believe we work for the government.)  The 
anonymous scrawlings from Panaca said, "If you don't like the way 
Lincoln County is run--LEAVE!"  Indeed, that is exactly how 
democracy and free enterprise work.  Every community has the right 
to choose its own destiny, to uphold its own values and present 
its own chosen face to the world.  Individuals and businesses, in 
turn, have the right to move to wherever the opportunities are the 
best for them.  If, for example, the Mormon majority makes the 
environment uncomfortable for all non-Mormons, deprives them of 
political power and enforces upon them their own religious values, 
then indeed the others will move out and none will move in.  The 
only downside is that most industry beyond the walls of this tiny 
kingdom is not controlled by Mormons, and businesses would be 
foolish to invest where they have no power.  The moral purity of 
the community may be preserved, but not its jobs.

Is it legal to vote on behalf of your religion or your family.  
Certainly.  Is it right?  No.  The root of democracy is 
individuals making their own decisions, in private, without fear 
of retribution and through their own independent conscience.  
Otherwise, the system is as totalitarian as any Communist regime.  
We recall, with bittersweet amusement, the caption on the Review-
Journal cartoon....  

"Entering Lincoln County....  Now Leaving America."

 ----- LARRY KING FEEDBACK -----

The following postings on internet newsgroups were passed on to us 
by our network of cyberspace spies following the Oct. 1 Larry King 
Special on TNT, "UFO Cover-Up: Live from Area 51."  In addition to 
taped segments, there were four live panelists: Stanton Friedman 
and Kevin Randle, representing the Roswell Incident; Dr. Steven 
Greer, founder of the CSETI UFO group; and Rachel resident Glenn 
Campbell, subtitled as an "activist."  Only Campbell did not wear 
a suit and tie.

   "The show is off the air 10 minutes and I am left with the 
feeling that Glenn Campbell works for the government.  I have no 
evidence to that fact, I am new to this whole line of information, 
but Mr. Campbell in my opinion seemed to soft-peddle the entire 
affair in a much too uncomfortable way for me to give him any 
credibility.  Friedman on the other hand, pending further 
information, seems very credible and quite likable, if not 
eccentric."
   -- buddhatek@aol.com

   "Okay, the show is off the air 28 minutes now, and you've got 
an  interesting theory.  What better place to plant a 
disinformation artist  than as a crusader?  Campbell, you're 
correct, was very soft-shoe about the whole affair, even though he 
moved his entire lift from Boston to live in a trailer in the 
desert. Oops, I forgot... that trailer is actually The Area 51 
Research Center.

   "Whether or not he's actually a disinformant remains to be 
seen.  What was evident, however, is that Glenn Campbell couldn't 
hold his own against the scientists and researchers on the panel.  
Let's face it, Campbell is not a scientist, a physicist, even a 
serious author.  He's simply like one of us, an 'enthusiast' (I 
hate that term) who's taken it to an extreme.  He seems very 
uninformed on the UFO phenomenon, which strikes me as remarkable.  
How can you claim to be the Area 51 researcher extraordinaire and 
not give a hoot about UFO's?  The two subjects are so intimately 
linked.

   "I'm not sure he's a government agent.  He may just be a boob."
   -- sharvey@interaccess.com

   "The guests on Larry King had mixed  beliefs and ideas... much 
of what is a cross section of the people who are interested in UFO 
study.  Stanton was correct in pointing out that there has been no 
serious study of the phenomenon.  Glenn Campbell is a better 
writer than interview guest, he really doesn't have a UFO 
position, he just wants the military to stop acting like Area 51 
isn't sitting out there.  Greer is pushing the envelope with the 
CE5 stuff.  Hey, if he gets out in the fresh air and gets some 
exercise waving a spotlight around the sky, more power to him.  
Maybe they'll take him to their leader, who knows."
   --d.beaty2@genie.geis.com

   "Steven Greer spent some time in Gulf Breeze, FL.  I was there 
at the same time.  He was received warmly and with healthy open-
mindedness.  Then, it became PAINFULLY obvious that his claims 
were completely exaggerated.  For instance, on March 14th, 1993 (I 
think it was '93.), three of the Gulf Breeze 'red light' UFOs 
appeared AND WERE VIDEOTAPED.  He immediately claimed that he was 
'telepathically' in contact with them and invited them to 'land on 
the beach behind us.'  He asked all present to 'send out your 
awareness to them.'  He was heard to say (to the UFOs), 'We 
welcome you, we love you, we invite you to land,' etc.  When the 
UFOs disappeared, he claimed it was 'A MAJOR CE-5.'

   "Later that year (in June), he tried his tricks again (calling 
them in).  He was in a parking lot on Santa Rosa Island, about 
seven miles from the other watchers at Shoreline Park.  The UFO 
did appear that night--about a mile from Shoreline, and about 
eight from Greer.

   "Later, he claimed that the craft 'appeared overhead' at a very 
close range.  Other witnesses deny this, as do their videotapes. 
Perhaps he saw something all the others didn't?"
   -- dxr41@po.cwru.edu

 ----- DR. GREER ON "48 HOURS" -----

Larry King panelist Dr. Steven Greer is an M.D. from North 
Carolina and the founder of CSETI (Center for the Study of 
Extraterrestrial Intelligence), a group that seeks direct 
communications with aliens.  We know little about him except for 
his prior appearance on "48 Hours" (4/20) in which he and his 
group journey to Mexico where they hope to be taken aboard a UFO.  

Greer: "I'm serious enough about this that I have transferred 
every asset I have into my wife's name."

The group sets up an observation post and their array of cameras, 
communicators and signaling equipment near the small town of 
Metepec, which happens to be about 50 miles from the busy Mexico 
City airport.  Sure enough, the group has seven sightings in six 
nights--bright lights hovering above the distant horizon that are 
captured on video tape.  (Later, two film analysis experts say 
there is nothing to distinguish these lights from ordinary 
aircraft.)  The group even claims communications with one of the 
UFOs through light signals.

Greer:  "It interacted beautifully, though, in terms of the off 
and on.  I mean, that was incredibly good CE-5.  In no way could a 
conventional craft move in a way where it could signal back and 
forth like that with the lights on and off."

NUKING VEGAS [DR#11]

   "I thought your views on Las Vegas were disgusting.  Yes I 
agree there is little cultural worth there, but there are still 
humans that live there.  I hope someone wants to destroy you and 
where you live.  No I do not live in LV, but feel destruction of

24 years, my family has been here since 1943, and I find that it 
is a very reasonable place.  There are actual neighborhoods with 
children, schools, parks, and other "normal" activities.... Most 
of our problems are caused by people that have come to town in the 
last 10 years or so which has caused a lot of growth which has 
pretty much ruined any chance of a pleasant life.  East Coast 
people (and I use the term "people" loosely) are usually morons 
who are going to rough it out West and end up destroying or over-

NUKING NEW YORK [DR#16]

   "...But really, how closed minded can you be to condemn an 
entire city based on your limited experience.  Maybe everyone 
doesn't want to live in the woods or the desert.  Being a NYC 
resident myself, I find your comments very ignorant and scary.  I 
enjoy the culture here and the sensory overload experience of 
working and living in this metropolis.  When I want to get away 
from the crowded spaces I get in my car and drive to the 
Adirondack State Park which has over 5 million acres of some of 
the most beautiful high peak woodlands in the country.  During the 
summer months we NYC people who appreciate natural beauty get in 
our cars or buses and spend weekends out in the Hamptons where we 
have clean and uncrowded beaches surrounded by sandy dunes and 
farmlands.  Perhaps you should limit your coverage to topics that

CLONING UPDATE

The letter by the cloning activist G.S. in [DR#16] prompted one of 
our readers, Andy S., to do some research and confirm that indeed 
his claims were true.  According to contemporary news accounts, a 
live KNBC-TV news broadcast was interrupted on Aug. 9, 1987, when 
a station visitor placed a toy gun to the head of consumer 
reporter David Horowitz and demanded that he read a statement on 
the air.  The visitor, Gary Stollman, the son of the KNBC 
pharmaceutical reporter Max Stollman, had gained entry to the 
studio by mentioning his father.  Only a few seconds of the 
statement were actually broadcast before being cut off, but the 
Desert Rat has obtained the full text.  It begins...

   "The man who has appeared on KNBC for the last 3 years is not 
my biological father.  He is a clone, a double created by the 
Central Intelligence Agency and alien forces.  It is only a small 
part of a greater plot, to over throw the United States 
Government, and possibly the human race itself.  The CIA has 
replaced and tried to destroy my family, and those of my friends.

  "Although I have known about this since 1981, I have not taken 
any action about it for fear of the lives of my family.  I have 
been forced into CIA-run mental hospitals, such as Cedars-Sinai 
Thalians, where I am shown being interviewed by many different 
doctors, although I spoke to nobody there for two weeks.  At UCLA-
NPI, I attempted to have myself released by a court several times, 
but was asked by a Dr. Martin Zsuba to keep removing my requests 
for a writ-hearing.  I have been unable to obtain records from 
several other hospitals, including Ben Taub Hospital in 
Cincinnati, where all the phones were turned off for 48 hours 
after I arrived.

but I believe it is somewhere in California."

A NEW TYPE OF SENSOR? [DR#17]

   "I was in the Air Force during Vietnam. We used "dog do-do" 
sensors to monitor an area. It looked just like a piece of you-
know-what with a little wire antenna on one side. It was activated 
by a small pin you removed. It had a life of two or three days and 
if anyone walked near it a signal was sent out.  They came 
packaged in shrink wrap packages 6 to a pack.

   "Keep an eye out for devices like that."

 ----- BLM ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT RELEASED -----

People who made comments to BLM on the proposed White 
Sides/Freedom Ridge withdrawal should have received by now their 
copy of the proposed Withdrawal Amendment and Environmental 
Assessment for the Freedom Ridge/White Sides land withdrawal--an 
intermediate step toward eventual AF control of the nearest Groom 
viewpoints.  A 30-day protest period on the document is now in 
effect (ending Dec. 9), but it is open only to those who made 
comments during the previous planning process.  (Apparently you 
qualify if BLM sent you a copy of the document.)

To file an effective protest, you must show that the environmental 
and land use issues raised during the previous comment period were 
not adequately addressed in the current document.  There is no 
sense in ragging about the UFO cover-up, black budget 
accountability or defense priorities.  Your protest must directly 
relate to the document at hand.

We note with interest that the stated purpose of the withdrawal 
has changed since the public comment period.  The only initial 
official Air Force explanation in the Federal Register and at the 
hearings was: "The purpose of the withdrawal is to ensure the 
public safety and the safe and secure operation of activities in 
the Nellis Air Force Range Complex."  

The new document says: "The purpose of the withdrawal is to 
provide a security and safety buffer to prevent a compromise of 
national security interests and to protect assets of the adjacent 
withdrawn Nellis Air Force Range."

The document also provides the following significant admission:  
"In 1988 the U.S. Congress withdraw the Groom Range Addition to 
the Nellis Air Force Range as a security and safety buffer zone 
between public lands administered by the BLM and the NAFR complex.  
The USAF subsequently discovered that two areas adjacent to this 
buffer zone provide viewing of military activities on this portion 
of the NAFR.  Public viewing of military activities (which has 
often included illegal photography of range activities) has 
increased during the past few years, necessitating the diversion, 
postponement, or cancellation of missions to prevent a compromise 
of national security."

There is nothing surprising in the content of these statements, 
and the purpose may even be justified (if they can also neutralize 
the OTHER viewpoints like Tikaboo Peak that haven't been touched).  
What is disturbing about these statements is that this is the 
first time we have ever heard them from the Air Force (if, indeed, 
this document conveys the Air Force position).  For example, we 
have never heard the Air Force admit that it erred in 1988.

Here's the scenario we see:  The AF applies for a land withdrawal, 
but gives only vague reasons--"public safety," "secure operation 
of activities," etc.  The public is allowed to comment on the 
action based only on this vague explanation--which makes 
meaningful comment very difficult.  After the comment period is 
over, the AF starts fleshing out its reasons for the withdrawal, 
providing more specifics and admitting its mistake in 1988.  By 
the time the application reaches the Secretary of the Interior, 
maybe the AF even admits that there IS a base at Groom Lake and 
that they want the land specifically to keep people from looking 
down on it.  Although this admission appears to be what we were 
seeking from the beginning, the problem is that it was presented 
only AFTER the public comment period was over, so obviously the 
public had no access to it.  In essence, the withdrawal becomes a 
closed process with only the theatrical appearance of public 
input.

 ----- CAMPBELL TRIAL INVITATION -----

All members of the press and public are hereby invited to attend 
the trial of political activist GLENN CAMPBELL of Rachel, Nevada, 
on the charge of Obstructing a Public Officer (NRS 197.190) for 
pushing down the car door locks during the seizure, without a 
warrant, of the news video tapes of KNBC-TV of Los Angeles near 
Freedom Ridge, July 19, 1994.  (Four of the five tapes have still 
not been returned, although the crew insists that they did not 
photograph the secret base.)

The trial will begin with jury selection on WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 
21, 1994, at 10:00 a.m. and may take one or two days.

Charges will be presented by Lincoln County District Attorney 
Thomas A. Dill before Justice Nola Holton of the Pahranagat Valley 
Justice Court in the County Annex Building, Alamo, Nevada (on US-
93, 90 miles north of Las Vegas and 50 miles east of Rachel).  
Campbell will defend himself, with the possible co-counsel of a 
Nevada lawyer.

It is advised that those who wish to attend confirm the date and 
time just before the trial.  Local lodging is available at the 
Meadow Lane Motel and Alamo Motel, both at (702)725-3371.

COMMENTS.  This will be a jury trial, so the judgment on Campbell 
will be rendered by the same pool of local voters that re-elected 
Bradfield.  (Keep this in mind when placing your bets.)  In any 
case, we regard the process as more important than the outcome.  
If found guilty, Campbell will be subject to a fine but no jail 
time.  At one point, the DA offered to seek only a $50 fine if 
Campbell pleaded "no contest," but the defendant declined.

REFERENCES.  The incident for which Campbell was arrested was 
recorded in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, July 21 (with an 
editorial July 22 and an editorial cartoon July 26); Las Vegas 
Sun, July 21, and PublisherÕs Auxiliary (organ of the ReporterÕs

 ----- HAZARDOUS WASTE PRE-TRIAL HEARING -----

On Nov. 10, we attended a brief pre-trial heading on the lawsuit 
filed by a widow and several "John Doe" plaintiffs charging 
injuries at Groom Lake stemming from illegal hazardous waste 
disposal.  When we walked into the courtroom, there were children 
everywhere.  Twelve kids in the jury box, a girl in the judge's 
chair, a boy on the witness stand and a sniffling wimp at the 
defense table represented, evidently, by two young gentlemen 
making rude sounds into their microphone.  Across the aisle was a 
gangly, blond-haired DA who clearly hadn't had an opportunity to 
go to Stanford yet.

It was a field day to Las Vegas Federal Court by a local grade 
school.  We guessed that the youths were about 12 years of age.  
Earlier in the day, they had witnessed the sentencing of a real 
drug dealer, a pregnant woman condemned to a couple of years in a 
non-fictional slammer.  From their places in the courtroom, the 
students fired questions at the real judge, who towered above the 
melee in his judicial robes.  Would the woman have the baby before 
going to jail?  Would she be able to keep the baby?  Why was she 
crying?

Someone in the jury box asked U.S. District Judge Philip Pro what 
his salary was.  He said he made $135,000 a year.

Then the children filed out and grownups filed in.  Three 
gentlemen in dark business suits represented the government: Two 
from the Justice Dept. and one from the EPA.  The lead lawyer was 
Richard Sarver, who we understand is a former Air Force officer.  
Lawyer Jonathan Turley, representing the workers, sat alone at the 
other table.  In the pews were the widow and her family and a 
handful of reporters scribbling notes on steno pads.

The hearing was conducted in legalese, much of which was beyond 
the grasp of our own tiny brain.  We did pick out a few tidbits, 
though.  The judge asked if there were any ongoing negotiations to 
reach a settlement, and Sarver said they were "almost DOA"--dead 
on arrival.  The judge also asked Sarver repeatedly whether the 
government would "stipulate that the base exists."  The government 
lawyer declined the opportunity--meaning that the government still 
does not acknowledge any base at Groom.  However, Sarver did 
repeat the official line that there are indeed "facilities at 
Groom Dry Lake."  It's a subtle distinction lost to meager minds.

We noted that six months would be allowed for the discovery 
process, during which each side of the case will be seeking 
information from the other.  The content of the rest of the 
hearing was over our head.  At one point, some angry-sounding 
words were exchanged between Turley and Sarver, but the subtext 
was not apparent to us.  The hearing ended after 45 minutes, and 
the lawyers dispersed.  

Whatever happened, Turley walked out of the courtroom looking like 
the cat that ate the bird.  Apparently, the government had 
overplayed its hand.  It had attempted to suppress the entire case 
on national security grounds, and that gambit had failed.  All we 
know for sure is that Turley was bubbling.  He was heard to use 
"sex" and "law" in the same sentence, with law being rated as 
superior.

 ----- ENEMY UPDATE -----

 -- In DR#16, we reported that our intimate enemy list included 
Lazar's gatekeeper GENE HUFF.  We are now as surprised as anyone 
to report a change in status:  Huff and Psycho have kissed and 
made up, and all those harsh words of the past have been 
forgotten.

Huff has even sold us a shipment of the handsome Lazar saucer 
posters, which are now available from us for $15 (plus $3.50 
postage in the US).  This 22" x 34" poster features three 
schematic views of the "Sport Model" flying saucer that Lazar says 
he worked on at "Area S4."  In the  background is a Russian 
satellite image of the Papoose Lake area.  It happens that in the 
mountains north of the lake bed a tiny saucer shape appears, but 
we suspect that it is a photo artifact.  (Huff says that the 
"saucer" did not appear on other frames taken at the same time by 
other cameras on the satellite.)  The poster was produced by Lazar 
and Huff to coincide with the release of the Testor's S4 saucer 
model.

 -- Replacing Mr. Huff on our mortal enemies list is German UFO 
filmmaker MICHAEL HESEMANN.  (Big round of applause, ladies and 
gentlemen.)  We met him on only one occasion, when he came to 
Rachel to videotape part of a UFO documentary.  He struck us as 
narcissistic and highly unprofessional.  He was abusive of his 
crew (or so we gathered from his tone of voice, as we do not speak 
German), and he insisted in appearing in every shot of his 
interview with us.  When a German journalist later asked us what 
we thought of Hesemann, we summed up succinctly:  "He's an 
asshole."  That translates into German as "Arschloch," a sentiment 
apparently shared by many in the German UFO field.  Eventually, 
our analysis made it back to Hesemann himself, who called us from 
Dusseldorf to leave a long and unhappy message on our answering 
machine.  Listening to it, we were reminded of Col. Klink 
threatening Col. Hogan.  Hesemann said he was going to cut us out 
of his documentary, but he was kind enough to give us one last 
chance to regain favor:  If we wrote him a letter of unconditional 
apology, which he would publish all over Europe, then he would not 
sue us.  We were trembling, of course, especially in light of 
Hesemann's written comments to the journalist, the ominous tone of 
which is best experienced without translation....

   "Wie Herr Campbell, den ich in der Tat WIE JEDEN interviewte, 
der in der Area 51 forschte, mein Video beurteilen kann, das 
derzeit uberhaupt erst im Schnitt ist ist vielleicht das grosste 
Ratsel der Wuste von Nevada.  Ist er ein Medium?  Oder hat er 
selbst so einen Scheiss gesagt, dass der Film schon wegen seines 
Interviews (von den anderen Interviews weiss er ja nichts) 
schlecht sein MUSS?  Was, bitteschon, soll er uber mich gasagt 
haben?  Nun, Campbell hat ein Manko.  Als er in Rachel eintraf, 
sind die 9 Scheiben--zumindest laut John Lear--langst nach White 
Sands verfrachtet worder.  Darum hat er nie selbst was gesehen.  
Ich war das achte Mal in Rachel, als ich ihn interviewte.  Ich 
hatter bereits, zusammen mit einem ABC-TV-Team, eine sehr 
beeindruckende Sichtung.  Er nicht.  Pech.  So what?  Neid???"

 -- Conspiracy nutcase GARY SCHULTZ is still our treasured enemy.  
He showed up in Rachel during the Larry King show and afterwards 
had the gall to visit our Research Center and try to strike up a 
conversation.  Since this is the twerp who once phoned our 
neighbor to spread vague rumors of child molestation against us 
(false, we must emphasize), we regard our differences as 
irreconcilable.  No kissing and making up here.  We ordered the 
little dip from the premises and told him never to come back.

 -- The enemy status of SEAN DAVID MORTON remains unchanged.  At a 
Nov. 5-6 UFO conference in the Bay Area, Sean described his 
relationship to us as being like Michael Jackson to Weird Al 
Yankovich.  (This is fine by us, as we have already proclaimed 
that we are not a child molester.)  In our continuing campaign to 
"data him to death," we are thinking of setting up a World Wide 
Web page devoted entirely to the bigger-than-life exploits of this 
modern Munchhausen.  Another neat idea would be to establish an 
internet newsgroup, alt.fan.sean.morton, where Sean's growing 
legion of "fans" can exchange information and insights about their 
hero.  We don't currently have newsgroup host capabilities, 
however.  Is there a sysop out there interested in sponsoring 
this?

 ----- INTEL BITTIES -----

BILBRAY DEFEATED.  One bright spot in the Nov. 8 election was the 
surprising defeat of Democratic Representative James Bilbray, 
Congress's most vocal defender of the secret base and Air Force 
interests in Nevada.  In interviews, Bilbray came closer than any 
other government official to admitting that the base was there, 
but he seemed 100 percent in support of its continued official 
nonexistence.  In an interview on the Fox "Encounters" segment on 
Area 51 [7/22, DR#10,15], Bilbray said that he had been all over 
the Nellis complex but had seen no evidence of alien craft.  
(Critics counter that Bilbray would have only gone where the 
military wanted him to and didn't have the clearance necessary to 
see anything really secret.)

THE CAMPING SEASON IS NOW OVER in the Rachel area, as nighttime 
temperatures drop through the 20s enroute to a winter low 
approaching minus 10 F around the first of the year.  Daytime 
weather can still be pleasant (or horrible), but you'll need a 
warm jacket.  Light snow is common here in December and January, 
and snow on the ground brings impenetrable fog to the valleys.  
The normally clear desert skies are often heavily overcast in the 
winter.  Spring is the windstorm season, where fierce gales from 
the southwest often prohibit outdoor activities.  

Identical weather is found at the Groom base, which was once 
cynically referred to by Lockheed workers as "Paradise Ranch."  
According to Skunk Works chairman Kelly Johnson, the name was 
"kind of a dirty trick since Paradise Ranch was a dry lake where 
quarter-inch rocks blew around every afternoon."  [Source: 
"Lockheed U-2," by Bill Yenne via C.H.]
