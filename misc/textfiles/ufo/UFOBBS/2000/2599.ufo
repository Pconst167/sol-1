Subj: Re: Eastlake UFO report - Neil
Well, I personally find the report of the sighting from the 
Coast Guard to be rather interesting.  As has been suggested in 
the last upload ( ASTRONOMERS..UFO ), I haven't the foggiest 
idea what they were looking at.
At the same time, what was observed doesn't necesarily imply 
the existance of extraterrestrials, either.  While I agree that 
the report does make me rather skeptical that the observers 
were looking at Jupiter/Venus, it is important to recognize 
that we live in an age of mistrust, secrecy, and undercover 
operations as a way of life.
UFO means exactly: "UNIDENTIFIED Flying Object".  Given the 
objectives of our military; stealth aircraft, jets that can fly 
in unusual deflections from a given course, and so forth, there 
could be some terrestrial explanations as well.
Yes, in my opinion, the sighting report may qualify as a UFO 
sighting.  But to go any further than that without empirical 
evidence would be difficult to support. 
To be objective about this will require time.  Time to absorb 
and compare, as well as to verify and test the accuracy of 
these reports.  But without a way to repeat the event, 
conclusions will be hard to come by.  
Perhaps that is the real reason there isn't a lot of chatter 
about these things?
