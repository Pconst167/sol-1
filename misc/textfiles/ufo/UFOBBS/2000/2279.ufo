PART 4



     She rocked him and talked quietly to him, she says, as several
aliens watched.  Suddenly one stepped forward and snatched him back. She
wanted to hold him longer, she says, but the next thing she remembered
she was back in bed in West Virginia.  She longs for him sometimes, she
says, "like a piece of me's missing."  She believes she'll see him
again.
     Lea hesitates and says, almost apologetically:  "I know this
doesn't make any sense."
     Even though she has trouble sleeping and often feels as if she's
being watched, she says she has "kind of gotten used to the idea" of
being abducted.
     "I don't like it, but there's nothing I can do about it, as far as
I can see," she says.  "If they were going to hurt me, I think they
would have done it a long time ago."
     She knows what the skeptics say.  But, she says, they don't give
people enough credit for knowing the difference between what's actually
happened to them and what they might have imagined.  Lea says she was
never abused as a child.  She says she has no reason to make up a story
so crazy and bizarre.
     Why does she think the aliens chose her?
     "I have no idea," she says.  "I don't know who they are, where they
come from, what they're doing, nothing."
     "I just want people to understand that this is real, this is
happening.  It's out there, and you're going to have to accept it sooner
or later."
     Is she absolutely sure that her torment has been caused by aliens?
     "There's no doubt in my mind," she says.  "And I know they'll be
back."

"A NIGHTTIME VISITOR THAT HAUNTS HER STILL".

     Leslie is not her real name.  She does not want to be identified
except by these facts:  She is 35, lives in Southern Maryland, has two
children and owns a business.
     She has seen strange, moving lights in the night sky.  She has lain
in bed terrified while an "electrical light" the size of a grapefruit
passed over her repeatedly, she says.  And she has had a dream in which
she grabs frantically at a spaceship holding one of her children
captive.
     To this day Leslie resists believing she and her children have been
visited or abducted by aliens.
     "I have to do that to keep from losing it," she says.  "I've got to
be reality-based.  I've got two kids to raise.  I've got a business to
run.  I can't be worrying about little aliens flying around my bedroom."
     Little aliens, however, populate the story she tells to the few
people willing to listen.  And even to them, she says, "it's the
craziest story I've ever heard -- my own story."
     "I did all the logical rationalizations I could do," she says.
"For a long time I thought I was seeing things...hallucinating, or
dreaming.  I even came to doubt my own sanity."
     Leslie knows that her story parallels those of people who believe
they've been taken aboard spaceships and examined by small beings with
large heads and huge eyes.
     What bothers Leslie most is her sense that both her children have
been affected as well.  They've described the strange beings and the
spaceship she saw in her dream.  They've described undergoing
examinations by aliens.
     One night, one of her boys, who was 8 or 9 at the time, appeared in
her bedroom doorway and told her he'd awakened to see a little man
kneeling over him in the air.  The man had a big head and big eyes.
"Then he got small, real little,": the boy said, "and flew down the
hallway into your room."
     Leslie says she had seen the same mysterious creature, floating
above her, a few minutes before her son saw it.
     "I can't tell you the feeling that went through me," she says.
     The experiences have left Leslie with more questions than answers.
     "You peek under the skirt of God when you talk about this," she
says.  "Who created us?  Why are we here?  What are we supposed to be
doing here?
     "Whatever is happening is far beyond our ability to understand it
at this time," she says.  "We're infants as far as all the things there
are to know."
