Hi Everyone

     My name is Dale and I belong to a local group of UFO
researchers in the Cincinnati, Ohio area.

     Besides going out into the field we produce a tv
program. This program is aired on  Warner Cable's public
access in Cincinnati.  Along with the tv program we have a
newsletter that reflects the program but also provides
information on the UFO phenomenon.

     I hope this is of interest to you all.


Vol. 1, No. 1          UFO Update          Jan./Feb 1994

               Premiere Issue

     Welcome to UFO Update newsletter. This publication is not
simply a companion piece for the UFO Update cable access program,
but an informative and -- hopefully -- thought provoking forum on
the UFO phenomenon.

     A regular feature in each edition will be an entry focusing
on the most recent segment of the UFO Update cable program.  More
than just a synopsis, each article will provide additional
background information and commentary on the topic discussed.
One can never know enough about UFOs, especially since it is
difficult to find objective reporting in mainstream publications.

     We will also occasionally report on local cases of interest,
even those that turn out to have down-to-earth explanations. It's
important that our readers understand that UFO research requires
patience, persistence and an understanding of general scientific
principles.

     When an interesting UFO book hits the newsstands, we'll let
you know what we think of it. We'll also keep you informed about
other UFO related media and materials.

     Finally, we'd like to hear from you. If you have any
questions or comments regarding UFOs, please send them along.
Even if your letter doesn't get printed, we'll try to drop you a
line in response -- so please include a self-addressed stamped
envelope. Remember, we reserve certain editorial privileges, and
your letter may have to be condensed to fit our limited space.

                What's on Ice at Wright-Pat?

     One of the more enduring rumors of UFO lore has been the
story that alien cadavers are being kept in cold storage at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As crazy as it sounds, there is
some logic behind this claim: Wright-Pat is home to the Foreign
Technologies Department of Air Force intelligence. It's difficult
to imagine a more foreign technology than an extraterrestrial one.

     The story actually has its beginnings in a book written by
Frank Scully in 1950. BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS tells of the 1948
retrieval of one downed UFO near Phoenix, Arizona and two others
that crashed near Aztec, New Mexico. In total, thirty-four alien
bodies were recovered along with the three craft.

     Scully's source was one Silas Newton, who in turn was acting
as a liaison for an enigmatic "Dr. Gee". Subsequent investigation
by J.P. Cahn for TRUE magazine revealed that Newton had been
involved in a number of previous schemes, including fraudulent
stock practices. "Dr. Gee" turned out to be Leo GeBauer. Who owned
a radio and television parts supply house -- a far cry from his
claim to being the "top magnetic research specialist in the United
States."

     With Scully's book exposed and discredited, any reference to
crashed saucers was avoided by the major UFO groups of the 50's:
NICAP and APRO. It was difficult enough to garner objective press
for UFOs without inviting guilt by association.

     Nevertheless, the story persisted.  Independent researchers
developed contacts and leads that seemed to lend some credence to
the hearsay. By the mid and late 70's, investigator Len
Stringfield had compilation impressive file of witnesses who had
firsthand knowledge of alien bodies and/or crashed saucers. Much
of this data was released by Stringfield in a number of status
reports issued over the last fifteen years.

     The watershed event came in 1978 when Col. Jesse Marcel, Sr.
was interviewed on the old IN SEARCH OF... television program. He
told of his task, as intelligence officer attached to Roswell Army
Air Force Base, of collecting strange material from a ranch in
Corona, New Mexico in early July 1947. Marcel described the
substance as being like nothing found on Earth. This  observation
was later supported by Jessie Marcel Jr. and Bill Brazel -- whose
father, Mac, discovered the debris and notified the air base.

     The collected scraps were taken back to the Roswell air field
where they were loaded on to a transport plane and flown to
Wright-Patterson.  Accompanying the crates of fragments were three
or four oblong boxes inside which were concealed alien corpses.
These had been found some miles west of the debris field, along
with the rest of the fallen saucer.

     In 1980 THE ROSWELL INCIDENT was published. Although flawed,
Charles Berlitz and William Moore's book broke through the Scully
stigma and established a degree of credibility for the crashed
saucer reports.  A decade later, Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt
interviewed over two hundred people in compiling UFO CRASH AT
ROSWELL, solidifying the scenario even more.  Stanton Friedman
and Don Berliner came along a year later with CRASH AT CORONA,
which argued that a second saucer -- part of a midair UFO
collision -- came down on the Plains of San Augustin. Clearly,
the circumstances behind the Roswell UFO crash mystery are among
the most fully researched in ufology.

     But where are the alien bodies now? As Part of in the IN
SEARCH OF... investigation, a trip was made to Building (Hangar)
18 at Wright-Patterson.  As could be expected, when the film crew
got there the cupboard was bare. Interestingly enough, however,
was that Building 18 housed a deep freeze unit. Jet engines were
tested there to see how they'd hold up against the frigid
temperatures of the Aleutian Islands. Not a bad place to keep a
few extraterrestrial carcasses.

     If there ever were alien bodies, the almost forty-seven years
since their recovery has probably seen them distributed widely to
countless research facilities. In many cases, the examiners probably had no
idea what it was they were ordered to classify. An oath of silence that
carried unspoken threats held the questions at bay. Such would be secrets
taken to the grave.

                    Local Connection

     There is a local string tied to this mystery. In 1959 Charles
Wilhelm heard the strange confession of his neighbor who was dying of
cancer.

     A young man at the time, Charles had been hired by the woman
to cut her grass that summer and had earned her confidence. As death
approached, she took Charles aside and told him a secret she was unwilling to
take to the grave.

     Accordingly, the woman held a clerical post with Top Security
Clearance at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and was often charged
with cataloguing equipment and supplies. In the course of these duties
she had seen, concealed within a secret hangar, two saucer-shaped craft.
One of the objects was intact, while the other was damaged. She further
claimed that the bodies of two small beings were being preserved in another
secret building and that she had handled their autopsy reports.

     Then in 1966, Charles Wilhelm obtained apparent verification
of his late neighbor's revelations from a friend of his in the Army
Reserve. This man's father was once assigned to Project Blue Book and held
high security clearance. Nearing death, the father admitted to his son
that two disc-shaped craft -- one intact, the other damaged -- were
secured in a hangar at Wright-Patterson. Additionally, he acknowledge that a
total of four humanoid bodies were kept preserved in chemicals.

     The confessions were made well before the current Roswell
investigations were started, but they tally well with what was
allegedly recovered from that New Mexico ranch so many years earlier.

                               Kecksburg

     In the late afternoon hours of December 9, 1965, something
fell from the sky and landed in a wooded ravine just west of Kecksburg,
Pennsylvania. There was concern that it might be a small airplane,
and the fire department responded to the scene. Four teams of rescuers
combed the area and eventually something was found. It wasn't an airplane, it
just may have been something not of this world.

     Shortly after the firefighters made their find, a detail from
the Air Force's 662nd Radar Squandron, based near Pittsburgh, arrived
to seal off the area. Moore troops and a flatbed truck soon arrived and the
object was remove from the ravine and spirited away. Stan Gordon, MUFON
state director for Pittsburg who has studied the case for over ten years,
has gathered goverment documents that indicate that as many as 212
military personnel were on the scene that night.

     According to eyewitnesses the object appeared bell- or
acorn-shaped amd measured ten feet long by eight feet wide. It was bronze
colored and adorned with a collar near its rounder end. On the collar were
etched strange figures that resembeled no earthly language.

     The original, official explanation was that the Kecksburg
object was a meteorite. Clearly, the eye-witness descriptions eliminate
this rationale.

     A more recent identification has been offered by NASA
scientist, James Oberg. Although there is no record of such an event, he
contends that the object was a Russian payload. The Air Force arrived to take it
away so that its heat shield could be analyzed. One would also hope they
studied what made it shatterproof, too! After all, an accidental re-entry
is a high velocity event, and any manmade object would either burn-up in
transit or disintegrate upon impact with the earth.

     Both the meteorite and Russian satellite theories are ruled
out by another interesting point: the object flew no faster than a small
airplane and made no fewer than four sharp course changes before touching
down in Kecksburg. The descent was powered and controlled. If it had been
a manned Soviet capsule, we would have been accused of somehow shooting it
down to steal Russian space science secrets! Sorry, Dr. Oberg, try again.

     So, what did become of the Kecksburg UFO? Most likely it was
shipped to Wright-Patterson where the Foreign Technologies Division
would try to take it apart. There is, in fact some testimony that might
bear that out.

                             Kecksburg Connection

     On September 19, 1990, NBC's UNSOLVED MYSTERIES aired a
re-enactment of the Kecksburg incident. It was a evenhanded treatment that
featured comments from eyewitnesses and Stan Gordon. Soon after the
broadcast, Gordon was overwhelmed with calls from viewers who thought they
might add some information to the case. One of the callers was an Ohio man
who claimed to have seen the acorn shaped object a few days after the Kecksburg
event while deliverying bricks to property adjacent to Wright-Patterson.

     Gordon passsed this story on to a local investigator Len Stringfield.
Stringfield, assisted by researcher Brian Thompson, pursued the case and
interviewed the witness. At the time, the source preferred to go by his
first name: Myron.
The followinf is a summary of his testimony:

     Myron and his cousin, "JS", delivered a large inventory of special
glazed bricks to Wright-Patterson just a few days after the Kecksburg
event. Curiously, the order came through the Navy. The bricks were to be
used to construct a double-thick, lead lined structure 50 x 80 feet in size,
inside an already existing red brick building.
     After following a jeep bearing an officer (possibly a general) and a
driver to the site, they were left to unload the bricks. Myron noticed that
there were several men dressed in what resembled decontamination suits
scurrying about.  He also reconized the Navy officer who had selected and
ordered the special brick.  After some time, Myron took a break from his
labors.  His curosity got the best of him, so he decided to have a look at
what was so important.  The security officers had apparently grown used to
Myron's presence and failed to check his approach soon enough.

     Although his glimpse was brief before being hustled back to the brick
delivery by a gaurd, Myron claimed to have seen plenty. There, inside the
building and supported by metal scaffolding was a bell-shapped object about
ten feet tall.

     Although Myron describes the object as bell-shapped, it was his viewing
of the UNSOLVED MYSTERIES program that caused him to contact Stan Gordan. In
fact, when asked by Stringfield if "acorn-shaped" was a suitable description,
Myron agreed it was.

     Myron's story is supported by his cousin, JS, who was able to add his
own observation.

     The day before he worked with Myron, JS had made a solo run to
Wright-Patterson with the first load of bricks. He recalled seeing a flatbed
trailer near the red brick building.  It's carge, although convered with a
tarp, was "liberty bell" shaped and stood eight to ten feet tall.

     Clearly, there is a strong indication that Myron and JS witnessed the
arrival and intial analysis of the Kecksburg object at Wright-Patterson.
But there are some questions that must be asked: Why were the bricks ordered
through the Navy?

     If the Navy was the investigative body, why wasn't the object taken to a
naval base?

     Was this action directed by the Joint Chief of Staff?

The implications are astounding and suggest that the Kecksburg object was
considered by the U.S. military as a violator of American air space.

     For an in-depth examination of the Kecksburg episode, the reader is
encouraged to consult UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS:   THE INNER SANCTUM by Leonard
Stringfield. THE ROSWELL INCIDENT, UFO CRASH AT ROSWELL, and CRASH AT CORONA
are all still available through local bookstores.
