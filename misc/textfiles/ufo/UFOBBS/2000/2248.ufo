 (2-4,Jim S.) Thanks for having me. Let me start off by elucidating...
















 (2-6,Frank) I am Chief of the Air Force's Technology Branch at the Pentagon...




 (2-4,Jim S.) OK,...













             are more likely than others" ...


























 (2-1,jmg) Jim, you've said that you consider the ET hypothesis the  least unlikely of the
          UFO explanations.  Could you give examples of what you consider to be in second
          and third place for likeliness? GA












 (2-2,JimV) Jim, I am still puzzled why you consider bolides and hoaxes to ...









 (2-6,Frank) As a teenager,...

































































 (2-2,JimV) Please give us some of uour 'snippets of evidence.' ...





































 (2-5,Tom M) Jim,
























 (2-4,Jim S.) Yes, and there are some fairly tall fir trees, I would guess,


 (2-5,Tom M) Jim,



 (2-5,Tom M) on that?  These seem to me to be countradictary.  Perhaps you can clarify ..


 (2-4,Jim S.) OK...













 (2-5,Tom M) Jim,















































 (2-5,Tom M) I am going to have to side with Jim S on that question ...
 (2-5,Tom M) you are trying to proove a negative, Frank.  ...

































 (2-6,Frank) I was not trying to prove a negative,...














                that's...


         What are we looking for?... What would be the structrue or goals of
         research?.

 (2-4,Jim S.) For one thing, contrary to Frank's thoughts, I'm NOT necessarily




 (2-4,Jim S.) there is indeed something here worth pursuing. The ultimate goal, of





          whether psychological, perceptual, physical or even extra-
          terrestrial... Since the sightings persist, I can suggest that they
          are valid basis for investigation regardless of the point of view.ga

 (2-4,Jim S.) OK, that's a start. My point is,...

















             public domain.

 (2-4,Jim S.) Let me try another poll...










 (2-6,Frank) Correct.





(2-6,Frank) No.










 (2-6,Frank) I'd like to make a couple of comments...





































 (2-4,Jim S.) Thank you, Tom...






 (2-7,Mark E. Meyer) When did the Hudson Valley event take place?  ga







 (2-6,Frank) When I was 12, I awoke one morning...


































 (2-4,Jim S.) I'm not disputing what you say, Frank....
 (2-4,Jim S.) but "tricks of light", and other perception problems seems like ...















 (2-6,Frank) I confess I stopped reading UFO literature...










 (2-4,Jim S.) "UFOs: The Public Deceived." It was because some of Klass' 
 (2-4,Jim S.) explanations struck me as highly dubious that I began looking... 
 (2-4,Jim S.) further into the matter. GA

 (2-6,Frank) The Pascagoula contactee...
 (2-6,Frank) failed a lie detector test, and subsequently confessed that...














 (2-4,Jim S.) You were thinking of "The Interrupted Journey," The Exeter incident...









 (2-6,Frank) I don't accept





(Jay H.) I have seen
         regression. In this example, a subject described her nights
         sleep to an investigator on film and audio tape, specifying that
         she had slept soundly after going to bed until morning under hypnosis
         (and film) the investigator discussed a couple of possible loud
         noises like firecrackers or gunshots. After awakening she
         specifically remembered wakening from loud noises and going to the
         window and looking out.When the audio tape was replayed she could not
         accept her own account. She couldn't believe she had 'forgotten' about
         the noises. Even investigations by a sincere investigator, if his
         belief is strong, seem to be able to affect subjects'accounts.  It
         often seems that the accounts given by subjects match up pretty..
         closely with accounts of others by the same investigator.ga

(2-6,Frank) This is great, but I have to get up early.  Good night, all.

(2-4,Jim S.) Gnite, Frank, its been fun. And revealing. 
(2-4,Jim S.) Jay, any discussion of hypnotic regression as it 
(2-4,Jim S.) relates to abductions has to consider the fact that 
(2-4,Jim S.) 30% of all abduction accounts are recalled WITHOUT hypnosis.
(2-4,Jim S.) Taking this a step further, it then becomes somewhat possible 
(2-4,Jim S.) to compare hypnotic and non-hypnotic cases to see if there
(2-4,Jim S.) is any major influence on the part of the hypnotist.  
(2-4,Jim S.) Such a study has been done by a noted folklorist by the name 
(2-4,Jim S.) of Dr. Thomas E. Bullard, in a mammoth 600 page opus. His 
(2-4,Jim S.) research shows that there is not much evidence to support 
(2-4,Jim S.) the contention that individual regressionists have an 
(2-4,Jim S.) influence on differences between accounts, nor does 
(2-4,Jim S.) hypnosis seem to be a factor in general. GA

 (2-7,Mark E. Meyer) Jim, you earlier mentioned a book called


 (2-2,Jim S.) Its about the Hudson Valley Case. Available from Ballantine...


 (2-7,Mark E. Meyer) Jim,Do you have the author's name?  ga

 (2-2,Jim S.) Phil Imbrogno, Robert Pratt, and J. Allen Hynek. I think it...


 (Jay H.) Jim I'm sure you know there is much foolishness in the UFO
          business... but I expect you've sorted through a lot...what do you
          think are the most serious books/publications?ga

(2-2,Jim S.) (Oy, is there foolishness!) 

(2-2,Jim S.) Best book for skeptics is "Uninvited Guests" by Richard Hall, Aurora, 1987... 
(2-2,Jim S.) make that 88.. 
(2-2,Jim S.) Hall is a science writer who does not suffer tomfoolery gladly... 
(2-2,Jim S.) and in fact has resigned MUFON over the Gulf Breeze affair and... 
(2-2,Jim S.) various other nuttiness... 
(2-2,Jim S.) Best publication, and the best overall group, is... 
(2-2,Jim S.) Citizens Against UFO Secrecy and their quarterly JUST CAUSE. GA 

(Jay H.) thx It/s running late here in the east, perhaps it's time to wind down..ga

(2-2,Jim S.) I've enjoyed it. I like... 
(2-2,Jim S.) debates of this sort, because it... 
(2-2,Jim S.) hones my polemical instincts, and because I really and truly.... 
(2-2,Jim S.) am interested in the truth, even if its that UFOs are all...
(2-2,Jim S.) swamp gas. GA 

(Jay H.) glad to have you...please come by again on our normal conferences.

(2-7,Mark E. Meyer) It's been interesting, Jim.  And I'm glad to say...
(2-7,Mark E. Meyer) (never mind)

(2-2,Jim S.) OK, I'm glad to say never mind, too.
