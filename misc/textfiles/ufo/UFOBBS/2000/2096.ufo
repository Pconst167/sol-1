Hello everyone.  We have just heard about an object found approximately 
640 feet under the earth while excavating for room to store radioactive 
waste.  The object is from 25 to 40 feet in height and there are 
apparently 9 of them in a row on a north-south line.  There are photos 
of it which I have yet to see, but OMNI and several other news services 
are doing their damndest to get the photos and/or more info.  The site 
is around Ogden, UTAH, so if anyone there knows about such an 
excavation, please give us the details.  The Ogden newspaper has not 
knowledge of such activity or such a discovery.  When we get the 
photos, we will digitize them for those interested.  I'll probably get 
in trouble for mentioning even this little bit of data but we would 
really like info if you know anything.  The object has gears and 
appears to be a machine or a part of one.  One guy says it looked like 
a gimbal to him though I have yet to see it to confirm.  The story 
and photos comes from a scientist working with the Super-Collider 
through a mutual friend.  That scientist was flown out to the site to 
see what he thought the thing was.  It is made of an unknown metal or 
alloy and cannot be welded or cut.  We question how they could take 
such an enormouse object from 640 feet down to the surface since it 
must weigh many tons.  There is speculation that since it is such an 
unknown metal, it might be lightweight like some of the fragments from 
crashed UFOs are supposed to be.  Guess I'm in hot water now but you 
guys might furnish more detailed info....I will try to get the 
pictures so everyone can see it.....Jerry
