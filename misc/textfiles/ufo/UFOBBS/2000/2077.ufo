SUBJECT: FOUR SPACE ALIENS HELD                              FILE: UFO2077


Four tiny space aliens captured when their starship landed on a Navy
aircraft carrier in 1991 are being held prisoner at a top-secret hideaway
in Maryland - and we've obtained an official government drawing of one
of the creatures!

A high ranking CIA agent who personally interviewed the aliens on three
occasions in 1993 leaked the sketch to this reporter late last week.

The drawing made by a government artist as part of the official file on
the aliens capture - depicts a slightly built, pugnosed creature with a
pointed chin, narrow black eyes and large pointed ears.

Your reporters broke the story of the landing and the aliens capture
before anyone else knew anything about it, so you deserve to be the first
to have this sketch, the agent told a reporter.

But he admitted he had an ulterior motive for leaking the drawing.

These beings have shown absolutely no hostile intent toward our country
or planet Earth in general, said the agent, who requested anonymity.

They've been friendly, they've been cooperative and they've been as helpful
as can be.

In my opinion, there's no reason in the world they shouldn't be set free
and allowed to return to their home.

I hope if we can keep this story alive, maybe your readers will pressure 
the Agency and President Clinton to do right by these guys and let them go.

The bizarre story began on Aug. 12, 1991, when the creatures starship landed
on the flight deck of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, Nimitz, in the 
western Pacific.

There was a exclusive account of the encounter in Feb. 18, 1992, along with
a dramatic photo of the 40 foot high starship shortly after it landed.

The UFO first showed up as a small blip on the ship's radar screen shortly 
after 8 a.m., a source said back then.

When efforts to contact the craft by radio failed, fighter planes were 
launched to intercept it.

The pilots had orders to shoot it down if it refused to land on the flight
deck as ordered.

Fortunately, the UFO was escorted back to the carrier without incident.

German scientist Dr. Hayden Braun, who later examined the spacecraft, said
it carried weaponry so advanced that the four beings aboard could have shot
our fighters out of the sky in a matter of seconds.

But for some reason they allowed themselves to be captured, Dr. Braun said.

The aliens, all slightly less than 4 feet tall, were taken to an undisclosed
military installation, where they were interrogated and examined by a team
of medical experts, according to the CIA agent who leaked the sketch.

Days later, they were whisked to a remote CIA secret compound in Maryland,
where they've been held under armed guard ever since.

They've been questioned for hundreds and hundreds of hours by every agency
imaginable and they've been cooperative as could be, the agent said.

You have to understand, these are extremely bright creatures, intelligent
beyond anything we could even dream of.

You question them in English, they answer in English, they answer in fluent
English. You question them in Swahili, they answer in fluent Swahili.

They smile, they joke and they communicate as though they've lived among us
all their lives. And we've learned more from them about the science of inte-
rplanetary travel than anyone can possible imagine.

Now though, they are very homesick and they want to leave, and it's only
right that we let them go.

But since we've dismantled their spaceship in the name of science, nobody
knows what the hell to do with them.

The agent said first President Bush and now President Clinton have been
briefed weekly since the aliens capture - and that Clinton actually visited
with the creatures in December.

He's concerned about their welfare, the agent said.

But truthfully, he doesn't know what to do with them anymore than anybody
else does.
