    Budd  Hopkins is an artist of no little repute,  who has maintained  an 
    interest.   in the UFO phenomenon for 20  years.  While writing  a  UFO 
    column  for  the Village Voice,  he became involved in  a  particularly 
    fascinating aspect of the field,.  the abduction cases.  Starting  with 
    the famed Betty and Barney Hill case,  many.  people claim to have been 
    actually taken aboard UFOs and examined by their humanoid occupants. In 
    most  of these cases,  the actual abduction is erased from the victim's 
    memory,   leaving only a vague fearfulness and an unexplained lapse  of 
    several hours --  missing time.  The encounter with,  and abduction by, 
    aliens is brought out only through the use of regressive hypnosis 
     
    In  this riveting book,  Hopkins documents several abduction cases with 
    the transcripts of the actual hypnotic sessions.  The basic accounts by 
    the  various  subjects  so nearly match each other that  there  can  be 
    almost no question of hallucination or fantasizing.  Unless Hopkins has 
    written  a  work  of  total fiction,  the  reader  is  confronted  with 
    inescapable evidence of alien encounters 
     
    The  most  important  contribution the book makes is to  reinforce  the 
    rather  sketchy image we have of our visitors.  The race we are dealing 
    with  seems  to be humanoid,.about 4-5  feet in height,   with  slender 
    bodies, bulbous, hairless heads, small mouths, nose and ears, and large 
    almond-shaped  eyes.   Their  skin is grey,  with a  leathery  quality, 
    alternately described as like "putty"  or "marshmallowy".  They  almost 
    invariably communicate via a form of telepathy 
     
    The  presentation of this knowledge counteracts yet another of the many 
    insidious  claims  by arch-skeptic Phil Klass.  In a letter to  myself, 
    Klass  maintained  that  "one of  the  characteristic  fingerprints  of 
    'pseudo-science'   that distinguishes it from true science is that  the 
    passage   of  time  and  effort  adds  no  increased   knowledge,    or 
    understanding,  for pseudo-sciencetoday,  20  years after I entered the 
    field of UFOlogy, we do.  not know an iota more about what UFOs 'really 
    are'   than  was 'known'  two decades ago."  It would seem,   with  the 
    publication of this book, that Klass himself has redefined UFOlogy as a 
    true science 
     
    Now  I'll offer a generalization of my own.  One of the surest signs of 
    the  truthfulness of a paranormal phenomenon is when the  "explanation" 
    offered by. its would-be debunkers is more extraordinary than the claim 
    itself.   Just what.  do the skeptics make of the incredible tales told 
    under  hypnosis in Missing Time?  "A subconscious reliving of the birth 
    trauma." Besides being patently ludicrous on its face, this explanation 
    ignores the palpable physical evidence presented in the book --   scars 
    from wounds inflicted by the alien examiners Scars that appear, in many 
    cases,   on the exact same place from victim to victim,  and  correlate 
    perfectly with the description of the "operation." 
     
    SUMMARY:  This is not a book I would recommend for those who prefer not 
    to believe that we are under surveillance.  For the rest of us,  it may 
    be the most important book written since the days of Donald Keyhoe
