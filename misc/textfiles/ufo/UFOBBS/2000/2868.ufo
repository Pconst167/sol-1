         We have  been looking for tangible information on the Aero Club of
               California as it existed in the mid 1850's for years.
            In a discussion with one of  our  users,  Mr.  Jim  Shaffer, he
              remembered that he had an article on that very subject
                  and took the time to type it in and send it up.
                                 Thank you JIM!!!

                    Mystery Airships of the 1800's (Part 1 of 3)

       Part One:  "No  form  of  dirigible  or heavier-than-air machine was
                   flying -- or could fly -- at this time."  And yet...

       By Jerome Clark and Loren Coleman

       March 26, 1880 was a quiet Friday  night  in tiny Galisteo Junction,
       N. Mex. (now the town of Lamy).  The train from nearby  Santa Fe had
       come and gone  and  the  railroad  agent,  his  day's work finished,
       routinely locked up the depot and  set  out with a couple of friends
       for a short walk.

       Suddenly they heard voices which seemed to be coming  from  the sky.
       The men looked  up  to  see  an object, "monstrous in size," rapidly
       approaching from the  west,  flying   so  low  that  elegantly-drawn
       characters could be  discerned  on  the  outside  of   the  peculiar
       vehicle.  Inside, the  occupants,  who  numbered 10 or so and looked
       like ordinary human beings, were laughing and shouting in an

                                      Page 1

       unfamiliar language and  the  men  on  the  ground  also heard music
       coming from the craft.  The craft itself was "fish-shaped" -- like a
       cigar with a tail -- and it was driven by a huge "fan" or propeller.

       As it passed overhead one of the occupants  tossed some objects from
       the car.  The depot agent and his friends recovered one item almost
       immediately, a beautiful flower with a slip of fine silk-like paper
       containing characters which  reminded  the men of designs  they  had
       seen on Japanese chests which held tea.

       Soon thereafter the  aerial  machine ascended and sailed away toward
       the east at high speed.

       The next morning searchers found a cup -- one of the items the
       witnesses had seen thrown out of  the  craft  but had been unable to
       locate in the darkness.

       "It is of very peculiar workmanship," the _Santa Fe Daily New
       Mexican_ reported, "entirely different to anything used in this
       country."

       The depot agent took the cup and the flower and put them on display.
       Before the day  was  over, however, this physical  evidence  of  the
       passage of the early unidentified object had vanished.

       In the evening   a   mysterious   gentleman  identified  only  as  a
       "collector of curiosities" appeared  in  town,  examined  the finds,
       suggested they were Asiatic in origin and offered such  a  large sum
       of money for  them  that the agent had no choice but to accept.  The
       "collector" scooped up his purchases and never was seen again.

            name of  "Mysteries  in  the  Eye of the Beholder."  Chaper X -

            "Several precocious  flying  machines sailed the  skies  during
             1880.  In late March several citizens of the unlikely place of
             Galisteo Junction, New Mexico heard voices overheard and saw a
             fish-shaped balloon driven by a fan-like apparatus.

             A cup  and  several  other  artifacts fell from the ship as it
             passed, but the next day a  collector  of  curiosities,  a man
             unknown in town, appeared and paid a large  sum  of  money for
             the items.

             The story ends on this note of mystery, BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK
             another installment CLARIFIED THESE STRANGE PROCEEDINGS.

             A party  of  tourists  which included a wealthy young Chinaman
             stopped in the vicinity and  found  the  stranger  engaged  in
             archaeological work.  The young man grew excited on seeing the
             articles dropped from the airship, because  among  among  them
             was a note in his fiancee's hand, and he explained that

                                      Page 2

             CHINESE EXPERIMENTS  IN  FLYING HAD AT LAST SUCCEEDED, meaning
             the airship which crossed the  skies  of Galisteo Junction was
             THE FIRST FLIGHT OF a CHINA-TO-AMERICA airline.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Of course the story of aviation does not begin on December 17, 1903,
       the date of  Orville Wright's 12-second aerial hop  at  Kitty  Hawk.
       Long before that  scientists  and  inventors had struggled to unlock
       the secrets of powered flight and  to  build  what  an 1897 issue of
       _Scientific American_ called the "true flying machine;  that is, one
       which is hundreds of times heavier than the air upon which it rests,
       (and flies) by  reason  of its dynamic impact, and not by the aid of
       any balloon or gasbag whatsoever."

       But nothing in the early history  of  flight  tells  us  what a huge
       airborne cigar was doing over New Mexico in 1880, especially  as  it
       "appeared to be  entirely  under the control of the occupants and...
       guided by a large fan-like apparatus,"  and  also  could ascend with
       startling speed.

       Its "monstrous size"  and  its  propeller  clearly indicate  it  was
       heavier than air,  but  such  a  flying  machine  didn't  then exist
       according to British authority Charles  H. Gibbs-Smith: "Speaking as
       an aeronautical historian  who  specializes  in the  periods  before
       1910, I can  say  with  certainty  that  the only airborne vehicles,
       carrying passengers, which could possibly have been seen anywhere in
       North America... were free-flying  spherical  balloons,  and  it  is
       highly unlikely for these to be mistaken for anything else.  No form
       of dirigible (i.e., a gasbag propelled by an airscrew)  or  heavier-
       than-air flying machine  was  flying  -- or indeed *could* fly -- at
       this time in America."

       Nevertheless, mysterious "airships"  were  seen in many parts of the
       world in the last half of the 19th Century and the  early  years  of
       the 20th.  And  plans  for  the  construction of such craft were not
       unknown.

       In 1848 gold  fever  seized  America.    On  January  24  a  workman
       discovered the precious metal in Sutter's millrace in California's
       Sacramento Valley.  Within weeks the entire Pacific coast knew about
       it and a  few  months  later  "gold"  was  on  the tongue  of  every
       easterner who ever dreamed of easy fortune.

       Getting to those  goldfields, however, was a problem, for the inland
       parts of the young nation were largely unsettled.  A unique solution
       -- air travel  -- came from "R. Porter  &  Company,"  a  firm  which
       listed its address as Room 40 of the Sun Building in  New York City.
       In the latter  part  of  1848 the company distributed an advertising
       flyer in the eastern United States  which promised more than it ever
       delivered.

       Touting "THE BEST ROUTE TO THE CALIFORNIA GOLD!" the  flyer  read in
       part that the   company   was   "making   active   progress  in  the
       construction of an 'Aerial Transport'  for  the  express  purpose of
       carrying passengers between New York and California.

       "It is expected to put this machine in operation about the first
       of April, 1849, and the transport is expected to make a trip to the

                                      Page 3

       gold region and back in seven days..."

       On the flyer the "aerial locomotive" is illustrated -- a huge cigar-
       shaped device, identified  as  a  "gasbag,"  with a tail.  Under it,
       attached with "sturdy  material   arrows   can't   puncture,"  is  a
       similarly-shaped car with windows in its midsection.

       "Snug gondola with benches for 50 or more passengers,"  the  caption
       reads.  From the  top  of the gondola stretches a long pipe which is
       identified as "a  steam  engine for  controlled  propulsion  through
       sunny skies at 60 miles the hour."

       Except for this pipe, entrepreneur Porter's vessel  is almost a dead
       ringer for the type of "UFO" widely reported in the late 1800's and
       early 1900's which   came  to  be  called  "the  airship,"  although
       obviously there had to be more than one of them and they did not all
       look alike.  But in the advertisement  of an obscure company lie the
       first hints of  a  bizarre  mystery  which  is  staggering   in  its
       implications. *

        * [We do not pretend to "solve" this mystery.  What we offer
           instead are  possibilities  suggested  by  a wide range of often
           conflicting evidence  complicated   by   the  distance  in  time
           separating us from the events described (which  makes  firsthand
           investigation impossible in all but rare instances).]

       During the 1850's  mysterious "airships" regularly crossed the skies
       of Germany and just before that,  probably  in  the  year  1848,  an
       enigmatic young German  named C. A. A. Dellschau immigrated  to  the
       United States.

       Dellschau's own testimony  places him in Sonora, a California mining
       town, in the 1850's.  Where he might  have been in the decades after
       that is unknown.  We do know, however, that about  the  turn  of the
       century he married  a  widow and took up residence in Houston, Tex.,
       where he lived in virtual seclusion.   He  had  no  friends;  by all
       accounts his quarrelsome disposition kept everyone at a distance.

       Dismissed as an eccentric by the few who knew him Dellschau  devoted
       hours to the  compilation  of  a  series  of  scrapbooks filled with
       clippings, drawings and cryptic notations.   He  died in 1924 at the
       age of 92.

       Were it not for a chance discovery many years later Dellschau's life
       would have gone  unnoticed.   But  one day in May 1969  a  UFOlogist
       named P. G.  Navarro  happened to stroll past an aviation exhibit at
       the University of  St.  Thomas in  Houston.   Two  large  scrapbooks
       (Dellschau's) caught his eye and he stopped to take a closer look.

        * [In telephone conversations and by correspondence, Navarro
           himself has provided us with this information.]

       He found that the scrapbooks contained old news stories and articles
       about attempts of  various  inventors to construct  heavier-than-air
       flying machines.  But  these  were  not  nearly  so  interesting  as
       Dellschau's drawings of strange-looking, cumbersome vessels which he
       claimed *actually had been flown at one time*.

       Navarro, his curiosity aroused, sought more of the scrapbooks and

                                      Page 4

       over a period of time acquired 10 more -- from such places as a junk
       shop in Houston  and  from  a  woman  art  collector  who  had  been
       interested in Dellschau's strange drawings.

       Navarro even talked  with  Dellschau's  stepdaughter,  then  an  old
       woman.  Finally he set out to makes sense of Dellschau's notes which
       had been penned in English, German and code.  When  he  had finished
       he had reconstructed an incredible story.

       One thing was obvious:  Dellschau was of two minds about what he was
       doing.  On one  hand  he wanted his "secrets" known; on the other he
       seemed afraid to speak directly.   So  he compromised and wrote in a
       fashion aimed to discourage all but the most determined investigator
       -- and even so his writings in the main only add to the mystery.

       He was writing for an audience -- if not one in his  own day, one in
       some future period.  He addressed potential readers thus:

            "You will... Wonder Weaver... you will unriddle these writings.
             They are  my  stock  of open knowledge.  They... will end like
             all the others...  with good intentions but too weak-willed to
             assign and put to work."

       From the notes Navarro learned that  in  the  1850's Dellschau and a
       group of associates,  about 60 in all, gathered in  Sonora,  Calif.,
       where they formed  an  "Aero Club" and constructed and flew heavier-
       than-air vehicles.  They worked in  an  open  field near Columbia, a
       small town near Sonora.  (Today an airstrip covers  the  field,  the
       only area in  the  predominantly  hilly region where planes can take
       off and land safely.)

       The club worked in secrecy and its  members  were  not  permitted to
       talk about their  activities or to use the aircraft  for  their  own
       purposes.  One member  who  threatened  to  take  his machine to the
       public in the hope of making a fortune died in an aerial explosion -
       - the victim, Dellschau hints, of murder.

       Another, a "high educated mechanic" identified as Gustav Freyer, was
       called to account  by  the  club for  withholding  new  information.
       Apparently this was no ordinary social group.

       The "Aero Club"  was  a  branch  of  a larger secret  society  whose
       initials Dellschau gives  as  "NYMZA."   He  says  little about this
       society except to observe that in  1858  it  was  headed by a George
       Newell in Sonora.

       Otherwise he alludes  to  orders  from  unnamed superiors  who  were
       overseeing the club's   activities.   These  were  not  governmental
       authorities, for Dellschau  writes  that  an  official  who  somehow
       learned of their  work  once approached club members  and  tried  to
       persuade them to  sell  their  inventions for use as weapons of war.
       The unnamed superiors instructed the club to refuse the offer.

       The club had a number of aircraft  at  its disposal, including among
       others August Schoetler's Aero Dora, Robert Nixon's  Aero  Rondo and
       George Newell's Aero  Newell.  However, from Dellschau's drawings it
       is hard to  believe that anything  resembling  these  machines  ever
       could have flown.


                                      Page 5

       Navarro remarks, "The  heavy  body  of  the  machines  seems  to  be
       radically out of  proportion to  the  gasbag  or  balloon  which  is
       supposed to lift the contraption.  Considering the  large  amount of
       gas (usually hydrogen  or  helium)  that  is required to lift one of
       today's dirigibles or even a small  blimp,  it is inconceivable that
       the small quantity  of  gas  used  in Dellschau's airship  would  be
       sufficient to lift it."

       But this wasn't  ordinary  gas.   According  to  Dellschau  it was a
       substance called "NB" which had the  capacity  to  "negate  weight."
       Incredible as it may seem he is talking about antigravity.

       Dellschau's notes have  a curiously pessimistic tone.   One  strange
       paragraph reads, "We  are  all  together  in  our  graves.   We  get
       together in my house.  We eat and  drink  and  are  joyful.   We  do
       mental work, but  everybody  is  forlorn,  as  they  feel  they  are
       fighting a losing  battle.  But little likelihood is there that fate
       shall bring forth the right man."

       Dellschau wrote of the human race -- and even the planet Earth -- as
       if he stood apart from it.  One  peculiar  paragraph  of  his  oddly
       archaic German reads:    "Your  Christian  love  reaches   for   the
       Wanderplace, and wanders  away from Earth.  Planets there are enough
       where Christian love shall be as  we  say  so  nicely  in  the  Book
       Selag."

       A drawing elsewhere shows the figure of a devil opening  a  crack in
       the fabric of  the  sky  above  one  of  the  "Aeros."   The overall
       impression conveyed by his writings  is that Dellschau was a man who
       knew secrets that  would  render  him forever an outsider,  isolated
       from the community of mankind.

       Who was he?   A  spinner  of tall tales?  But to what end?  If he is
       only that why did he spend years compiling the scrapbooks - devoting
       most of his waking hours to the task - on the slight chance that one
       day far in the future, long after  his death, someone might be taken
       in?

       On November 1, 1896, the _Detroit Free Press_ reported  that  in the
       near future a New York inventor would construct and fly an "aerial
       torpedo boat."  And on November 17 the _Sacramento Bee_ reprinted a
       telegram the newspaper  had received from a New York man who said he
       and some friends would board an airship  of his invention and fly it
       to California.  The trip, he said, would take no more than two days.
       That very night all hell broke loose and the Great  Airship Scare of
       1896-97 was off and running.

       The next day the _Bee_ led off a long article with this paragraph:

             "Last evening  between  the hours of six and seven o'clock, in
              the year of our Lord eighteen  hudred  and ninety-six, a most
              startling exhibition  was seen in the sky  in  this  city  of
              Sacramento.

              People standing  on  the  sidewalks  at certain points in the
              city between the hours stated,  saw  coming  through  the sky
              over the housetops, what appeared to them  to  be  merely  an
              electric arc lamp propelled by some mysterious force.


                                      Page 6

              It came  out  of  the  east  and  sailed  unevenly toward the
              southwest, dropping now nearer to the earth, and now suddenly
              rising into the air again as  if  the force that was whirling
              it through  space  was sensible of the dangers  of  collision
              with objects upon the earth..."

       Hundreds of persons  saw it. Those who got the closest look said the
       object was huge and cigar-shaped and  had  four large wings attached
       to an aluminum  body.  Some insisted they heard voices  and  raucous
       laughter emanating from  the  ship.  A man identified as R. L. Lowry
       and a companion allegedly saw four  men  pushing the craft along the
       ground by its wheels.  Lowry's friends asked them  where  they  were
       going.  "To San Francisco," they replied.  "We hope to be there by
       midnight."

       One J. H.  Vogel,  who  was in the vicinity, confirmed the story and
       added that the  vessel  was  "egg-shaped."  The  next  afternoon  an
       airship passed over Oak Park, Calif., leaving a trail  of  smoke and
       soon San Francisco,  Oakland and other cities and town in the north-
       cantral part of  California  had   their  own  stories  in  all  the
       newspapers.

       Several persons now  stepped  forward to tell of earlier  sightings.
       One was a  fruit rancher near Bowman, Placer County, who said he and
       members of his family had watched  an airship fly by at 100 miles an
       hour in late October.

       Even more remarkable was the statement of a man who  claimed that in
       August he and  fellow  hunters  had  tracked  a  wounded deer across
       Tamalpais Mountain until they came  to a clearing where six men were
       working on an airship.

       The most baffling  part  of the whole flap, which lasted  well  into
       December 1896, was  the  role  of  "E. H. Benjamin," a dentist whose
       name the newspapers always enclosed  in  quotation marks, as if they
       had reason to doubt his identity.

       It was either  Benjamin  or  his uncle who that November  approached
       George D. Collins,   a  San  Francisco  lawyer,  and  asked  him  to
       represent his interests in the patenting of an airship.  He told the
       incredulous Collins that he had come  from Maine to California seven
       years before in order to conduct his experiments without  danger  of
       interruption.

       Collins told reporters  that  his  wealthy  client  (whom  he  never
       identified) did his work near Oroville  where  Collins  himself  had
       viewed the invention -- an enormous construction 150 feet long.  "It
       is built on the aeroplane system and has two canvas  wings  18  feet
       wide and rudder  shaped  like a bird's tail," the attorney said.  "I
       saw the thing ascend about 90 feet under perfect control."

       On November 17, Collins went on, the  airship had flown the 60 miles
       between Oroville and  Sacramento in 45 minutes.  This  was  not  the
       first flight the  inventor  had  made.   For  two  weeks he had been
       flying in attempts to perfect the craft's navigational apparatus.

       This led to  the  story in the _Sacramento  Bee_  for  November  23,
       datelined Oroville:  "The rumor that the airship which is alleged to
       have passed over Sacramento was constructed near this town seems to

                                      Page 7

       have a grain of truth in it.  The parties who could give information
       if they would  are extremely reticent.  They give evasive answers or
       assert they know absolutely nothing about it.

       "Not a single  person  that  saw   or   knew  of  an  airship  being
       constructed near here can be found and yet there  is  a  rumor  that
       some man has  been  experimenting  with  different  kinds of gas and
       testing those which are lighter than air.  The experiments were made
       some miles east of the town and no  one is able to give any names of
       the parties, who  are  evidently  strangers  and  seeking  to  avoid
       publicity."

       The _San Francisco  Call_  established  that "Benjamin," a native of
       Carmel, Me., had been seen in the  Orville  area  visiting a wealthy
       uncle and confiding to friends that he had invented  something which
       would "revolutionize the world."

       Several days into  the  controversy, the inventor dispensed with the
       services of lawyer Collins because he was talking too much.  W.  H.
       H. Hart, a former state attorney general and a highly respected man,
       took over Collins'  job.  In subsequent  newspaper  interviews  Hart
       revealed that *two* airships existed, one in the east  and the other
       in California.  "I  have been concerned in the eastern invention for
       some time personally," he said.   "The  idea  is to consolidate both
       interests."

       The western craft would be used as a weapon of war.   "From  what  I
       have seen of  it,"  Hart  said,  "I have not the least doubt that it
       will carry four  men  and 1,000 pounds  of  dynamite.   I  am  quite
       convinced that two or three men could destroy the city  of Havana in
       48 hours."

       Hart thus represented  both airship inventors, one in California and
       one in New Jersey.  The former had Hart say, "...if the Cubans would
       give him $10 million he would wipe out the Spanish stronghold." This
       was not the last time airships and  Cuba*  would be mentioned in the
       same breath, as we shall see.

        * [In this period the then-new "yellow journalism" was keeping
           American public   opinion   aroused  over  Cuba's   desire   for
           independence.  After  the  Cuban  insurection  of  1895,  public
           sentiment was  running high against  Spain  and  the  mysterious
           destruction of the U. S. S. Maine in Havana harbor  on  February
           15, 1898, triggered the Spanish-American war.]

       Early in December   1896   a   stranger   appeared   at  a  business
       establishment in Fresno, Calif., and inquired for a George Jennings.
       Covered with dust, the man looked  as  if  he  had  traveled  a long
       distance.  When Jennings stepped out of a back room  he  greeted the
       visitor like an  old  friend.   The  two  men  engaged  in whispered
       conversation and the  persons standing  nearby  were  nonplussed  to
       overhear the word "airship" spoken more than once.

       Later Jennings talked  freely  to a reporter for the  _Fresno  Semi-
       Weekly Expositor_, balking only at giving his friends' name.

       "It is true  the airship is in Fresno County," he said.  "Just where
       I do not know myself.  It is also  true that the man who was in here
       a short time ago is one of the inventors.  He told me the trip to

                                      Page 8

       this country was  involuntary  upon  the  part  of  the  men  in the
       airship.

       In other words the machine came itself  and  they  couldn't stop it.
       (I was told)  that they were flying, as usual, around  Contra  Costa
       County hills and rose to a height of about 1,000 feet.  Suddenly the
       airship struck a  current  of  air  and  refused  to  answer  to its
       steering gear.  It was borne rapidly  southward  against all efforts
       to change its  course until suddenly the current of  air  seemed  to
       lessen and the  machine once more became manageable.  The men aboard
       at once descended and flew about looking  for  a hiding place, which
       they at length found."

       Jennings said he was sure that individuals in nearby  Watertown  and
       Selma must have  observed  the craft as it limped through the county
       in search of a "hiding place."   Sure  enough,  the  day  before his
       encounter with the aeronaut, the _San Francisco Call_  had published
       a letter from five Watertown men who said they had seen an enormous
       airship nearly collide  with  a  cornice  on  the city's post office
       building the evening of November  20.   The  craft had an "intensely
       brilliant" light and the witnesses could see human forms aboard.

       The evening of  December  5  Selma  citizens  were  treated  to  the
       unnerving spectacle of a low-flying brilliantly-illuminated object
       sailing rapidly toward the southeast.

       "The character of  the  witnesses  is such as to leave no doubt that
       they saw just   what   they  described,"   the   _Selma   Irrigator_
       editorialized.

       After the first  week  of  December  the  airships  seemed  to  have
       disappeared, the "inventors" were heard from no more and everything
       returned to normal -- but not for long.  The incredible part was yet
       to come.

       Vangard note...

            We are  looking  into  the  Dellschau  manuscripts  and further
            researches on this mysterious N.B. gas.

            From the work of Walter Russell  and  his  development  of  the
            Octave Periodic Progression of elements, there  would appear to
            be somewhere  on the order of 26 elements BELOW HYDROGEN.  This
            is TOTALLY CONTRARY to any modern understanding of chemistry.

            As we understand it, the N.B.  gas had incredible lifting power
            (not anti-gravity per se.).  An apt analogy would  be  that one
            could fill a basketball with the N.B. gas, hold it in your arms
            and be carried off into the upper stratosphere.

            When such  an understanding is applied to the majority of cases
            of the airships, it is seen how  they are identical to ships on
            water or  submarines  underwater.  A simple change  in  ballast
            would determine  the height to which the airship would rise and
            remain.  Subject of course to wind.

            When perusing the many fascinating  reports  from  this era, we
            note several describing winged men flying through the air.


                                      Page 9
            Some have  the equivalent of a backpack for thrust, some simply
            the wings.  N.B. could very well stand for Neutral Buoyancy.

                            SHADES OF THE ROCKETEER!!!

            Page 205 of Bullards book,

            On July 28th, around 6 to 7 AM?,  Two  Louisville, Kentucky men
            saw an  object in the distance which drew nearer  and  resolved
            into the appearance of a man surrounded by machinery.  (Note
            no gasbag or canopy supported by one)

            If the  man  slacked  his efforts (he was peddling) the machine
            dropped, but if he once again worked the treadles (peddles) and
            wings HE  ROSE  AGAIN; but the  machine  seemed  under  perfect
            control and executed a turn over the city.

            (Remember when the comedian Gallagher built and  flew a bicycle
             type device suspended from a small dirigible.)

            Page 206 of Bullards book,

            In September  an  object like a black-clad man WITH BAT'S WINGS
            AND FROGS LEGS FLAPPED over Coney Island.

            Can we not here clearly see that  the  use of N.B. gas could so
            balance or completely cancel one's weight that  flying  in  air
            would be  analogous  to  swimming  in water?  Is this not worth
            pursuing?  It would turn our  concept  of air travel completely
            upside down.

            Ninety percent  of  the problem with air travel  is  the  extra
            power required  to sustain lift.  Propulsion is a piece of cake
            in comparision.  Imagine airships  or  flying  suits  literally
            "floating" like boats on water..........
