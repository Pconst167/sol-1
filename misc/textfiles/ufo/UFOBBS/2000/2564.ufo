All of these articles are from the mid 1960's, but have relevance
in today's society.  This is a classic case as to why you should
not report a UFO sighting.

These articles show what can happen to people that report
UFOs.  It would make one think twice before reporting a
UFO, because it can have ramifications on your job and
life in general.

The below articles are one of many that occurred in Ohio.
Other classic cases include the Mansfield, Ohio helicopter
event with Coyne, which was investigated by Zeidman.

             OHIO DEPUTIES CHASE, LOSE BRILLIANT UFO
                      by Douglas Bloomfield
                      Portage County Bureau

       RAVENNA--Hundreds of persons in two states reported
seeing a "brilliant and shiny" object over eastern Ohio
early yesterday.  Two Portage County deputies chased it 86
miles.
       Portage County Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur said he and
his partner, Deputy Sheriff W.H. Neff played tag with the
mysterious object from 5 a.m. near Ravenna to 6:30 a.m. on
the outskirts of Pittsburgh.
       Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua saw the object
and photographed it in front of his home.  He showed a print
of his picture to the Plain Dealer but said the Air Force
told him not to release it or permit photographs to be
taken.
       BUCHERT DESCRIBED it as "round when I looked straight
up at it, but when it moved to the left--I feel like an
idiot saying this--it looked like a saucer, like two table
saucers put together."
       The photograph showed an object with a very dark
bottom and a very light top.  Each half seemed to resemble a
saucer seen from the side.  The lighter top "saucer" was
upside down.
       Spaur described the object as about 40 feet wide and
18 feet high.  He said he clocked it at speeds up to 103 mph
as they chased it from Randolph Township to Conway, Pa.
       A BRILLIANT beam of light from the object lit the
area.  Spaur said, "It was so bright, even with the sun
coming out, it stood out.  Its lines were very distinct," he
said as he used the bell of a flashlight to describe the
object.
       "We were close, closer than I ever want to be again,"
he told the Plain Dealer.  "I know nobody's going to believe
it but its true."  Spaur said all his former doubts about
UFOs were removed.
       "Somebody had control over it.  It wasn't just an object 
floating around.  It can maneuver.  The only sound
was a steady, faint humming like an electrical transformer
when we first spotted it," he said.  The sound was inaudible
as the deputies chased the object, they added.
       AT CONWAY, PA., Spaur said the object began hovering
and was "going for altitude, straight up."  After watching
for about 20 minutes, he and the others went inside the
police station to telephone U.S. Air Force officials he
said, and when they came back outside the object was
gone.
       The Federal Aviation Agency's Air Traffic Control
Centers at Oberlin and Pittsburgh said they spotted no
unknown objects on their radar early yesterday.

    HE CHASED A FLYING SAUCER, NOW HIS LIFE IS SHATTERED

                       by John De Groot

       RAVENNA (AP)--In his world of loneliness and twisted
nightmares, Dale Spaur wonders if the nightmare will ever
end.
       It began six months ago with "Seven Steps to Hell"
and ended with a flying saucer named Floyd.
       In the predawn hours of a gentle April morning,
Portage County Sheriff's Deputy Spaur chased a flying saucer
86 miles.
       NOW THE STRANGE craft is chasing him.  And he is
hiding from it, a bearded stranger peering past the limp
curtains of a tiny motel room in Solon.
       He no longer is a deputy sheriff.
       His marriage is shattered.
       He has lost 40 pounds.
       He lives on one bowl of cereal and a sandwich each
       day.
       He walks three miles to an $80-a-week painters job.
His motel room costs $60 a week.  The court has ordered him
to pay his wife $20 a week for the support of his two
children.
       That leaves Dale Spaur exactly nothing.
       THE FLYING saucer did it.
       "If I could change all that I have done in my life,"
he said, "I would change just one thing.  And that would be
the night we chased that damn thing.  That saucer."
He spit the word out, "Saucer." An obscenity.
       Others might understand.
       Four other officers took part in the April 17 [1966]
drama.
       Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua saw the craft
and photographed it.  The pictures turned out badly, an odd
fuzzy white thing suspended in blackness.  Today, Chief
Buchert laughs nervously when he speaks of that night.
       "I'D RATHER NOT talk about it," he says.  "It's
something that should be forgotten...left alone.  I saw
something, but I don't know what it was."
       Special Deputy W.L. Neff rode with Spaur during the
chase.
       He won't talk about it.
       His wife Jackelyne explains, "I hope I never see him
like he was after the chase.  He was real white, almost in a
state of shock.  It was awful."
       "And people made fun of him afterwards.  He never
talks about it anymore.  Once he told me, 'If that thing
landed in my back yard, I wouldn't tell a soul.'  He's been
through a wringer."
       PATROLMAN Frank Panzenella saw the chase end in
Conway, Pa., where he works.  He saw the craft.
       Now he is silent.  Friends say he had his telephone
removed because of calls about that April morning.
       H. Wayne Huston was a police officer in East
Palestine, O.  He had worked there seven years.  Several
months after the saucer passed above him in the night, he
resigned...going to Seattle Wash., to drive a bus.
       Huston now goes by Harold W. Huston.  He tells you,"
Sure I quit because of that thing.  People laughed at me.
And there was pressure...You couldn't put your finger on it,
but the pressure was there.
       The city officials didn't like police officers
chasing flying saucers."
       SPAUR AND HUSTON have turned in their badges.
       Now Spaur hides in Solon, a fugitive from a flying
saucer named Floyd.  He cannot escape the strange craft.
       Spaur and Neff were checking on a car parked
alongside U.S. 224 between Randolph and Atwater.  The car
was filled with radio equipment and had a strange emblem
painted on its side, a triangle with a bolt of lightning
inside it.  Above the emblem was written, "Seven Steps to
Hell."
       Behind them they heard a strange humming noise and
turning, said they saw a huge saucer shaped craft rise out
of a woods and hover above them, bathing them in a warm
white light.
       Then it moved off.
       LEAVING THE mystery car behind, never to be seen
again, the two deputies hopped into their cruiser and chased
the object, sometimes at speeds of more than 100 miles an
hour.  The chase finally ended when the cruiser ran out of
gas near Pittsburgh.  They said the craft they chased was
about 50 feet across and 15 to 20 feet high with a large
dome on its top and an antenna jutted out from the rear of
the dome.
       After the chase, Spaur's daily routine was washed
away in a sea of reporters, television cameramen, Air Force
investigators, government officials, strange letters from
places like Little Rock, Ark. and Australia that told him
what to do if "the little green men" tried to contact
him.
       "MY ENTIRE LIFE came crashing down around my
shoulders," he said.
       "Everything changed.  I still don't really know what
happened.  But suddenly, it was as though everybody owned
me.  And I no longer had anything for myself.  My wife, my
home, my children.  They all seemed to fade away."
       Spaur's wife Daneise now is alone with her two
children.
       She has filed for divorce and is working as a
waitress in a bar at Ravenna.
       "Something happened to Dale, but I don't know what it
was," she says.  He came home that day and I never saw him
more frightened before.  He acted strange, listless.  He
just sat around.  He was very pale."
       "THEN LATER, he got real nervous.  And he started to
run away.  He'd just disappear for days and days.  I
wouldn't see him."
       "Our marriage fell apart.  All sorts of people came
to the house.  Investigators.  Reporters.  They kept him up
all night.  They kept after him, hounding him.  They hounded
him right into the ground."
       "And he changed."
       Then one night, Dale came home very late.  He isn't
sure what happened.  He walked into the living room.  There
were some other people there.  Things were very tense.  Very
confused.
       HE GRABBED his wife and shook her.  Hard.  He kept
shaking her.  It left big ugly bruises on her arms.
       He doesn't know how or why...
       That was the end of July.  Daneise filed assault and
battery charges.  Dale was jailed and turned in his badge.
       A newspaper printed a story about the deputy who
chased the flying saucer being jailed for beating his
wife.
       When he got out of jail, Dale ran...left town, turned
his back on everything.
       BUT THE SAUCER followed him, locked in his dreams.
       In Ravenna, Daneise can only say, "Dale is a lost
soul.
       And everything is finished for us."
       In Solon, Dale said, "I have become a freak.  I'm so
damn lonely.  Look at me...34 years old and what do I have?
Nothing."
       "Who knows me?  To everyone I'm Dale Spaur, the nut
who chased a flying saucer.  My father called me several
weeks ago.
       A long time ago we had a fight.  I hadn't heard from
him for years.  Then he calls me."
       "DO YOU THINK he called to ask how I was...To say 'I
love you, son...To see if I wanted to go fishing, or
something?
       Hell, no.  He wanted to know if I'd seen any more
flying saucers."
       "I tried to go to church for help.  I went to church
and the minister introduced me to the congregation.  'We
have the man who chased a flying saucer with us today,' he
said."
       Dale Spaur wept as he told what the flying saucer
named Floyd had done to him.
       He calls it Floyd because he saw it once more while
he was still working for the sheriff's department.
       THE RADIO operators knew civilians were monitoring
their broadcasts.  So they agreed to use a code name if the
flying saucer was seen again.  They called it Floyd...Dale
Spaur's middle name.
       Dale was driving east on Interstate 80-S one night in
June [1966].  He looked up.  There it was.
       "Floyd's here with me," he whispered into the
radio.
       Then he parked the car and sat there, alone.  This time 
Barney Neff was not with him.  Dale did not look out
the window.  He lit a cigarette and stared at the floor of
the cruiser.  He sat there for nearly 15 minutes...not
looking outside, not wanting to see Floyd.
       WHEN HE LOOKED up, Floyd had disappeared.
       Yet it still follows him.
       And it has ruined his life.
       This he believes.
