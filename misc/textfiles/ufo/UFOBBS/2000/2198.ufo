when Hatonn seems to "predict" in this writing, he is guessing based on

                               THE GREY MEN TAPE
This is an e
dited transcription of a lecture taped April 23, 1988.The information is valid
and, if anything, more easily recognizedtoday--Hatonn.I will be utilizing this
information again when speak of economics,but for now, I will modify from the
audio tape to
save time and repetition.Let us call the group which has elaborate, and
successful, plans to ruleyour nation and your world, the Internationalists.
When I refer to theInternationalists I am referring to a very elite group of
about twelveto thirteen '
families'. These "families" hold your "purse strings"--zipperand lock, to all
the bags of money in your world. Sound impossible?Nay, it is not only possible,
it is extremely easy to visualize afterI have explained it to you.As I move
along, I will gi
ve you some names and places whereby you cancheck it out on an individual
basis. I wish never to place any humanat risk, however, so in all instances I
will only refer to thosealready having come forth with 'public' statements or
information.I will a
lso have to explain a few terms used to have any sense ofcontinuity. Therefore,
as we move along, forgive me of any digression inattempt to give definition,
i.e., 'fractional banking'.First, you must fully come into understanding that
there truly ARE
 theelite few, with plans well foundationed and functioning, who control
boththe world financial markets and ultimately will control all peoples ofthe
world. Do not err in your thoughts by thinking I am speaking of'someone else in
the world', I speak
 more for the United States ofAmerica than I do of the remainder of your
world.As I pull portions of the puzzle together for this documentI shall again
be referring to such groups as Trilateral Commission,the Council of Foreign
Relations, and the Bil
derburgers. Forgive meif I am repetitious. I may need to be repetitious in
order to fit thepieces in proper perspective.You must know that there are
certain families (literally) that controlthe hard currency. The countries
wherein these families abid
e are knownas hard currency countries. These thirteen families have control of
the policymaking and the decision making of the central banks of those
countries.They are owners, these families, of the majority of the stock of the
regionalbanks of the
Federal Reserve System. 'Federal Reserve' would indicate to themore uninformed,
that this is a Federal Government Branch. This is untrue,the Federal Reserve
System is NOT a branch of your federal government.Just as these families
control the regional
 banks of the Federal ReserveSystem, they also control the currencies that are
not allowed to fluctuate. Note here that the American dollar is the standard
against whichall other currency is measured. All other nations are affected
accordingto the ch
anging values of the dollar. Not only do these families controlthe currencies,
but they likewise control the banks. This, friends,is in all the leading
nations of your world.For ease of understanding, let us just consider the
industrializednations at
 this point. I will also need to explain fractional banking toyou, because
without understanding the lending system you cannot get thepicture properly.
All of the banks under control of these familiespractice fractional banking--
and beyond--(sometime
s there is no hardmoney present at all). But, let us explain by example on a
personal level.              FRACTIONAL BANKINGThis is actually referred to as
fractional 'reserve' banking. Lendersare allowed to loan a maximum of up to 20
to one. This is
 perfectlylegal, practiced by every lending institution in America and
elsewhere.Example: Mr. A goes to his friendly banker, Mr. B, and deposits
onethousand dollars ($1000) into Mr. B's bank. Mr. B's bank is a Savings and
Loan so Mr. puts the $1000 i
nto his own savings account. The Savingsand Loan is required by your laws, to
keep only 5% in reserve. The areallowed to loan out 95% of the money invested
or 95% of that which isplaced into savings accounts. This means of $1000 there
is $950 whichis
 available to be loaned out. In turn the Savings and Loan takes the$950 and
loans it to Mr. C to do some home repairs, let us say. This gentleman takes his
borrowed $950 and goes to the local hardware/lumbercompany and purchases
supplies, lumber, nai
ls, etc.The lumber company carries on regular banking and therefore, hegoes to
his bank with the $950 for deposit, to Band D. Bank D is nowrequired to keep 5%
but can loan out 95% which would be $902.50.Bank D now loans that to Mr. X who
in turn filt
ers it back into theeconomy, let us suppose, through the grocery store and
otherbusiness stores. He spends it and now we have that money end up inBank Z.
Bank Z is required keep 5%. That means that Bank Z can loanout $857.37. It is
again loaned and f
iltered back in to the economy.This is continued right down to zero. With your
$1000 deposit those bankersusing fractional reserve banking are now allowed to
loan out $20,229.60.This is practiced by EVERY lending institution in America
and elsewhere.
The amounts above do not include 'interest' on the money borrowed, onlythe
principle amount.You must now keep it in mind that this results in an increase
in themoney supply through the Federal Reserve System. Your 'big boys'
simplyturn up the speed o
f your money presses and run them a little fasterand faster in order to pump
more in to the economy just to boost up thefractional reserve banking. Let me
remind you to keep in mind that thethirteen families control all of the hard
currencies of the
world and areallowed to practice this fractional reserve banking--this will be
importantas we move along.                   THE OIL CRISISWe will now talk
about something referred to, on your planet, as'System 2000', which is a Global
Creditors Unila
teral plan. This plan wentinto effect somewhere about the early 1970s. At that
time a pentagonofficial and several other officials visited Nigeria. They went
to the PrimeMinister and paid him fifty million dollars ($50 million) to raise
the priceof h
is oil to more than double. Nigerian oil is 'light crude' of qualitysuch that
it is almost pure enough to burn immediately, without distillation,in
automobiles. This type of oil sets the price of oil for the entire world.The
$50 million was cash acro
ss the board with no repayment requirementsif Nigeria would double the price of
light crude.We will refer to this as light oil. There are only two locationsin
the world that have this light oil and, of course, it is the most valuableoil
in your world
, therefore, it is the standard against which all other oilin the world is
measured. So, whoever controlled the price of the lightoil at that time
controlled the price of all of the oil in the world.At this point, let us bring
the Arabs into this sce
nario.This will also bringin the Trilateral Commission--that also includes Mr.
Bush. It was now time tobring pressure and persuasion to OPEC. What most of you
Americans do notremember is that the United States of America IS A MEMBER OF
OPEC. It iskep
t most low profile.At that time a 'deal was cut' with the Middle Eastern Oil
Producers andthis is how it went; all buyers were prepared to pay significantly
higherprices for the oil--PROVIDED--all Middle Eastern nations supported
theUnited States of
America, BY INVESTING THE REVENUES INTO THE BIG BANKS INAMERICA.To make this
picture clear, you must remember that the Arabs, who arewealthy sheiks today,
had been wandering around on camelback in a verybig desert. They were nomads
and they were cert
ainly most unsophisticatedin business affairs. Years earlier when the
international bankers foundout that there was oil in their countries, they went
forth and persuadedthe Arabs to allow them to produce the oil by financing the
oil fields,drilling,
rigging--all supplies including expertise.After the bankers financed the oil
fields they then charged the Arabsusury fees for building the supply systems--
along with refineries.The usury was quickly repaid because the Arabs became
very rich,very quic
kly. (Way back then you were only paying about 30 centsper gallon in your
gasoline stations.) Let us now take it further, you goto Nigeria and pay them
to double the price of light crude. Unbeknownstto the Arabs, those ones who had
become wealthy ove
rnight and didn'tknow zero about business, much less international finance;
then the camelnomads; you call them together and say, 'We will take the price
ofcrude just as high as you want it to go--IF--you will deposit anestablished
portion of the fun
ds that you get from this NEW PROFIT RISEIN 30 YEAR TIME CERTIFICATES IN
CERTAIN MAJOR U.S. BANKS.Perhaps you ones can now understand the problems you
experienced in yourearly 1970s. Remember the gas lines and the prices of oil
skyrocketing?It was be
cause the international bankers, who hold the purses of the world, knewthat the
increase in the price of oil that was going to the Arabs wouldcome rushing
right back to their bank in 30 year time certificates of deposit.Turn now to
the 30 year time d
eposits and let us examine the banker's plans.Back in the late 70's and early
80's Sheik Ymani and his bunch had noidea that there was a connection between
those banks, or that they were thesame people that had the controlling interest
of the major o
il companies.Do yousee what has been woven here? After all, how could the camel
riding nomadsrealize the international bankers were 'having them' hook, line
and upto the fishing pole? How could they possibly know that what was
happeningthrough these
oil companies, was that the monies were being cycled right backinto the
selected, no exceptions, banking system? They couldn't and theydidn't!
THE CONTROLLING TRUSTGoing a long ways back now; in the 1870's the Rockefellers
set up someth
ingcalled a Joint Stock Trust. Here I will add, this was just a brief periodof
time before the American Government declared these trusts illegal. BUT,YOU SEE,
THESE ONES COULD FUNCTION FOREVER UNDER WHAT YOU CALL A 'GRANDFATHER'CLAUSE.
THAT BROTHERS,
 IS THE ULTIMATE CONTROLLING FACTOR IN AMERICA OFTHE PRIME BANKS AND THE
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. That 'trust' is in the control of the Rockefeller
Foundation, and, in turn controls the FederalReserve Bank and is the method
whereby the Internationalist
s are able to gaincontrol of the currency of the U.S.A.Does it begin to become
reasonable that those New York banks are showingall time record earnings? Yet,
all around the rest of your country of theU.S., banks and Savings and Loans are
going broke
and failing. THAT, FRIENDS,MEANS YOU ARE BEING MANIPULATED RIGHT ALONG WITH THE
ARABS AND EQUALLY ASBLINDLY--WITH NO RECOURSE.Let us come back now, and speak
of the deal which 'was cut' (Your ones inpower love that term) with the Saudi
Arabians and o
nes of the Middle East.These ones were required to put their money into the
prime banks; keep inmind that they did not know that the prime banks were able
to lend inamounts of twenty to one. (20 to 1 was quite a while ago, it is
higherat present.) Al
l they were receiving was the interest on the money they haddeposited. Worse
for them, in some of these countries it is unacceptableto receive interest for
religious reasons so they might wait thirtyyears to get any money from their
certificates of d
eposit. In other words,they did not know that this fractional type of banking
could be done,but through this, the bankers of the world were able to gain
control of themoney of the Arab world, and in turn the Arab world only received
back partof the i
nterest from the money that they placed into the International BankingSystem--
UNDER THESE 30 YEAR TIME DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES.Through the money gained from the
Arabs through the manipulation of theprice of oil, and taking the price of
gasoline from, le
t us say, 30 centsa gallon to $1.25 a gallon--there is a lot of money being
made. Now, withthat money returning into the international banks at 20 to 1, I
think you cansee the staggering profits. Let us face facts, friends, that money
originallycame
from YOU. Because the bankers had locked in the deposits they were then,in
turn, able to make loans to third world nations.             ENTER THIRD WORLD
NATIONSThink back fifteen or twenty years ago when the International Bankers
startedinvesting in
 third world country loans. LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THE COUNTRIESWHICH ARE GOING
BANKRUPT (COMPLETELY BROKE) TODAY. IT WAS FULLY INTENDEDTHAT THOSE COUNTRIES GO
BROKE AND I WILL EXPLAIN THAT IN A LITTLE BIT.You might wonder how I know so
much. Well, I h
ave the best computer systemin the universe and all I have to do is key it up
and it is spread out beforeme. My computers rarely reflect errors; only changes
in 'probabilities' andperturbations in human action and reactions.I am sorry,
friends, your
friendly bankers set it up deliberately so that thethird world countries would
go broke.You have to pay attention to history andlook back to the time when
those third world countries were beginning to gainindependence and setting up
independent gover
nments.It was at such times thatthese bankers loaned the upstarts great sums of
money which actually had cometo them through the Arabs, basically.The
international bankers not only wanted, but insured, that theseborrowing
countries would misuse the f
undings. It was fully intendedthat the funds could be be mismanaged through
greed and simply be squandered.You must remember that the leaders of these
countries had never governedanything or anybody. They knew nothing about
government. They had beenc
olonies under the governorship of other larger countries.The international
bankers knew that the leaders were bound to squander thefunds. It was known
they would have no way to know what to do with them(and they were massive) and
so the cycle goes. T
hey were actually squanderingmoney taken from you through the Arabs through
high oil prices, etc. Let usnow follow it on through.                PUNISHING
TEXASI will hereby digress to a story from Dharma's earth home state--Texas--
mostof you have he
ard of it. Let us go back some years (not too many) to jogsome memories. Do you
remember someone named John Connelly, who wasgovernor of Texas? Do you recall
that he was also in the vehicle and wasinjured during John Kennedy's
assassination? Well, Mr
. Connelly was alsoUnder Secretary of the Treasurer--he was a lot of things and
titles. Theseones with Mr. Connelly did a most fascinating thing--they planned
toimplement a new currency for the State of Texas. You see, Texas is a partof
the Union onl
y through a renewable 'treaty'. The treaty is automaticallyrenewed every year,
but it isn't necessary that it be renewed. That means,friends, that the U.S.
only has a treaty with Texas to keep it in the unionof states. It was not voted
in as were you
r other states.Texas was at one time--I believe you term might be 'filthy
rich'. The statewas wealthy and there were many very, very wealthy individuals.
Richindividuals such as the Hunt brothers, who actually had nothing
originally,but became extrem
ely wealthy, overnight, by OIL. That was all the way backwhen oil was first
struck and became so popular.I am truly going to tie all this together but you
must bear with me for thereare so many facets. I must make it clear what I am
going to say. I w
illexplain to you why, if you don't already know, it was so very important
toones of 'the opposition', and why there was an assassination attempt
againstMr. Connelly's life as well as Kennedy's.Why are those men 'broken'
today and a state in severe f
inancial trouble?It is because the Internationalists learned of what the Hunt
brothers andMr. Connelly were trying to do. Texas, a state by treaty, can
legallysecede from your union. The Hunt brothers and Mr. Connelly knew
thatTexas had the ability t
o set up their own country and have their owncurrency. That is why they could
be solvent and not be under the dictatesof the Federal Reserve System. Or,
simply stated, under the control ofthe international bankers.At about the same
time they were in
the process of gaining a corner on thesilver of the world. This was in order to
finance a process whereby theycould overcome the international bankers and it
was at that point the Huntbrothers were smashed. John Connelly was almost
killed, and Texas,
 whichcould have been the only state in the union to fulfill breaking out of
the trap,has been punished with some extremely major problems. Today, portions
ofDallas and Fort Worth, Houston and other wealthy, wealthy cities have goneon
to resemble gho
st towns in your Old West. Ones who had grown rich in theoil industry have been
severely punished, the Hunts and Connelly are bankrupt.The Internationalists
became so incensed, so angry, at what these Texans haddone that they broke the
back of the oi
l industry, and the major oil producersof Texas. It was a well designed plan
and executed in perfection.When ones attempt to interfere with the plans of the
international bankers,you can see what the results can be.The Hunt brothers
were working dire
ctlywith the Shah of Iran, on the above plan. Immediately thereafter one of
theTexas bankers was killed, the Shah of Iran deposed, and the Hunt
brotherswere forced into bankruptcy.There are many ways the international
bankers can get revenge on ones
whoattempt interference with their overall plan;through murder, or you might
wellbe placed into a mental institution and locked away permanently, or you
canhave trumped up charges brought against you whereby you are locked
awayindefinitely in prison.
 This latter has also happened to numerous ones in the'UFO' investigation
circles who find and bring forth truth. It is exactlywhat happened to Colonel
Wendelle Stevens. Colonel Stevens probably hasinvestigated more UFO incidents
than any other one i
ndividual. Further,an assassination plot was arranged and attempted while
Colonel Stevenswas incarcerated. Strangely, the perpetrator, who dressed as a
religiousleader, was caught in the act, turned over to the FBI, and has never
beenheard from again
. So be it.               THE SHAH'S DEATHIf you will recall, the Shah of Iran
was in perfect health when he wasdeposed and departed Iran. He was only
declared to be sick after he reachedthe United States. You were told he was
being held in 'protecti
ve' custodyat a military base. There, you were also told, he was being treated
for hisillness--which was not present at the time of his arrival. He died
anyway,didn't he? Face it--his death was planned and the murder executed.In
your present months t
here is an international uproar over the use the ofchemical and germ warfare
utilized Iran and Iraq. Some of the viruses cannotbe traced--nor, in such above
instances, would anyone dare to pursue it.Who would question a man becoming
ill, being treate
d and then expiringunexpectedly? Certainly no one in the United States would
question it.You were uncomfortable enough just having the man in your country.
Deathcan most effectively be brought about in any number of non-traceable
ways;one of which is
 through micro-dots and variations of vibration frequencies,as well through
viruses. (This is exactly what happened to Dharma, inher own dwelling--causing
cardiac arrest. We just happen to have her underconstant monitoring for she is
a receiver of se
veral of us in this higherfrequency dimension; therefore, we can catch these
attempts and counterthem. Doesn't do much for the mental relaxation of the
victim, however.)       THE HOSTAGE STORYYou can get verification of these
little stories from Sen
ator John Hansenof you own government. I am going to speak of Iran and your
people who weretaken hostage. I doubt many of you have heard the truth of the
matter.Senator Hansen was in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.
Heknew what was ha
ppening in Iran and requested permission to go to Iran andinvestigate. Congress
refused. Mr. Hansen then purchased his own privateairline ticket and proceeded
to Iran anyway.When Senator Hansen arrived, the one Khomeni proffered an
audience. Guesswha
t Khomeni said? He said, 'We don't want these hostages, certainly not anymore
than you want us to have them'. 'As a matter of fact," Khomeni continued;'I'd
like to give you these hostages, at least half of them anyway, and youcan take
them home with
you tomorrow morning. That is, Mr. Hansen, if you willpromise to begin an
investigation into the relationship between the Shah ofIran, Chase Manhatten
Bank, Mr. Henry Kissinger and your President Carter.'At this point, Senator
Hansen was most delight
ed. He rushed to call backto the U.S. to someone who could give authorization
and said 'Hey, I canbring half of the hostages home tomorrow. How shall I
arrange it?' Theperson on the other end of the line said, 'Well, I will call
you backtomorrow and
let you know.' Now please guess what happened on the followingmorning? When the
call was placed back to Mr. Hansen, he was told the following, 'Get yourself on
the next airplane coming to America. Come homeimmediately. Do not bring
hostages. Do not d
o any negotiating. You have noright to speak the part of the Congress of the
United States of Americaeven if you are a congressman. Get home immediately
with no furtherdiscourse.'Here is what he found upon his return to Washington--
that the incident
wasentered into the Congressional record. Further he found that PresidentCarter
knew the hostages were going to be taken and further--knew that theywere there
for a reason and he was not to interfere. Now, you ones get yourselfready for a
bomb if you
 have not already had access to this expose. Therelease of the hostages in Iran
was negotiated by a negotiator of ChaseManhattan Bank in New York, U.S.A. All
outside overt and covert attempts togain release was a facade. Ask any marine
who was involv
ed in the militaryefforts thereof.Is it really any wonder to you ones that Iran
is all ticked off at you today?Those hostages, and America, were held in terror
while bankers got the Shah'smoney safely into their banks before the Shah was
killed and t
hen, in turn,got much of the money belonging to Iran. A pretty wicked way to
get Iran'smoney into the Chase Manhattan Bank to it could remain solvent and be
oneof the wealthiest institutions in the entire world.              SLEIGHT OF
HANDThe intern
ational banks formed bank 'holding companies' so that they couldnot be held
responsible. The Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank and J.P. Morgan'sbank were the
predominant banks for money deposited by the Arabs. Theholding companies were
formed in order t
o loan out money to the third worldcountries while knowing full well that the
third world countries were goingto go broke.After the Shah had been destroyed
and the money was safely in the banks, therewere massive amounts of money
loaned to third worl
d countries. These noteswere shifted from the banks to the bank holding
companies in anticipationof the eventual bankruptcy of the borrowing
countries.One holding company was for the purpose of loaning money to the third
worldcountries. The purpose o
f the second holding company was to borrow moneyfrom the international bank in
order to purchase agricultural lands. Thatmeans you farms and also certain
corporations in the United States. Thefarms and businesses will probably
continue to make some m
oney, but the thirdworld countries are destined to go down. This is ongoing,
dear ones, not apassing fancy.            WATCH THE HANDSWe are going to now
consider currency on a world basis. We will also pointout why some of the
monetary plans and mon
ey making formats are valid andviable.Let us speak a bit about Mr. Marcos who
was recently deposed from thePhillipines. This is most typical, friends, so
watch the hands closely.A representative of the international bankers' bank
went to those ones a
ndsaid, 'Mr. Marcos, we will forgive all of your loans. You cannot pay
themback, you cannot pay back the interest, you can't pay back the
principle,but, we would like to make you a bargain. We will just forgive the
loans.'Digress time: remember, who
did that money belong to that they loaned outto these third world places? It
was not the bankers'. Well, of course,it was all that Arab money, because of
the higher prices that the people allover the world had paid. So, back to what
the bankers say,
'We'll justforgive your loans, the principle and the interest and you never
haveto pay it back--IF (ALWAYS THE IF)--. The 'if' goes about as follows:You
have to do away with your national currency, whatever it is. The dollarwill be
your currency basi
s of value. You will be set up with a type ofdebit card system instead of the
usual currency system. Then, too, youmust give us perpetual rights to all of
the natural resources in yourcountry.Interestingly enough, it was right after
that little gift
gesture; thatfriendly little suggestion, that Mr. Marcos was deposed. Why do
yousuppose that happened? Well, Mr. Marcos was pretty feisty and he told
theinternational bankers where they could go right after they got
immediatelyout of his country. He
had no intention of giving them sovereigntyover his country and look what
happened.Everyone in that country found that suddenly their social security
numberwas synonymous with their credit number; further, their central bankwas
to act as a wholesaler
 for credit, which in turn, was extended to it bythe new super bank which was
announced by your Mr. Paul Volker in the fallof 1985. That was ratified
immediately by President Reagan. Just a funaside for you who love to play with
numbers and speculate
 aboutcoincidence--the names and numbers, the digits, added up to six. Lots
ofthings around Mr. Reagan add up to sixes--even his retirement home address.I
take very little stock in these things, but many of you seem to like thegame.
Also, because a P
resident is not reelected does not mean he isvanquished from the fray.A further
contingent condition of the benevolent gift, if you will, of theInternational
Monetary Fund, was that in order to help the economy ofthose countries the IMF
was going to
nominate external, nondomesticcorporations to properly engineer, exploit and
excavate the minerals ofthose said countries who had just put those same
mineral resources up ascollateral. This would all, thereby, supposedly bring
prosperity to thosestri
ving nations.Mr. Marcos was a bit sharper up front, however, and he pinpointed
on theword PERPETUAL in the contract. He realized that quite obviously he would
besigning away the sovereignty of his nation.I make no comment or judgement
regarding Mr. M
arcos as a person, nor doI make comment about any individual--those ones are of
human format, notmine. I am just telling you the way it is and how some things
happened.In the case of the Marcoses, it was only a matter of weeks before
thebankers broug
ht down the guillotine blade. Riots were financed by, andoriginated through,
ones of the international bankers' groups. It is neverhumanly wise to cross
these ones; you see Mr. and Mrs. Marcos wereexploiting the people well enough
on their own and di
d not wish to share.              WHERE DID THE MONEY GO?Ah, let us not forget
those holding companies of which I spoke. Rememberholding companies one and
holding companies two? The secondgroup was receiving credit from the first
group of holding com
panies topurchase assets and liabilities from the 'prime' banks. The only
liabilitiesthey would purchase were liabilities represented by Certificates of
Depositsof the Arab nations. The assets they were buying were loans made to
thedebtor nations. Re
member, it was designed that third world countries woulddefault on the loans
which would bankrupt the holding companies whichhad purchased the Arab's CD's
from the banks.At such a point, the international bankers say to the Arabs, 'OK
fellows,sorry,
but all those billions of dollars in 30 year term deposits thatyou have been
depositing all these years are gone.They were sold to a holdingcompany,
unattached to us, which loaned the money to third world countrieswhich are
bankrupt--broke--gone kapu
t. Sorry, Mr. Arab, but as of todayyou are bankrupt. Just like that--all
gone!'You might ask, 'Is it possible for the Arab world to go bankrupt?
Reallynow, the richest people in the world with all that oil?' It is a
littlebit shocking isn't it? Poor
souls, they didn't even know those CD's hadbeen 'sold' to those holding
companies. They had deposited the money rightinto the New York bank as
required. How could they possibly know they weretransferred out and into
bankruptcy destined companies? How
 could theyunderstand the inner manipulations of international financiers? They
werenomads, they didn't know anything about business. One cannot even
considerthem foolish. How much of this intrigue do you know, much less
understand?The Arabs could no
t know what they were up against. But now let us look atwhat has happened.
Before the end of 1986 the Arab world became a bit awareof what was happening
to them. The word went out that before May 1st, 1987millions and millions had
to be transferred o
ut of the Arab world intoAmerica, to start preparing for doomsday. Money was to
be shifted into anykind of securities that were even half way decent. Why do
you think thiswas so? It was so that when the Arab sheiks came to the point
ofbankruptcy they
 could be sure the people under them, those millions ofpeople of the Arab
countries who have literally been 'kept' by give-awayprograms, could not get at
them. They would have a place to run to and,hopefully, hide. Well, when this
all comes down that
 these Arab countrieshave literally been sold out, innocently or
knowingly,there will be uprisingsturmoil and literally, massacres abounding. It
is going to happen, friends,right in the Arab nations.This is why they have
purchased, and set in place,
silkworm type missilesfrom China. Long range, nuclear capable, and they have
the nuclear devicesto arm them. Could it be they will be needed against their
own peoples?The people are going to be quite irritated when the are no longer
receivinganything
 from the oil revenues, that their own country is bankrupt and thatfurther,
they were sold out by their own leaders. At that point there willbe mass
migration of sheiks headed for America where they have alreadytransferred the
most of their assets.Th
e Arabs were trying to make the big purchases by May of 1988; it isnow a year
and a half later. Do you not think things might be startingto come down pretty
soon? Could it be relatively correlated in timing toSavings and Loan problems
and private pen
sion plan troubles and failingeconomy and - and -?I continue to see problems as
I look on my scanners. The probability of youmaking it into your 1990 before a
major depression is not reflected there.I see no way for you to make it past
your fall seas
on.You only need a couple more countries to default and your monetary
systemwill collapse. You sit on the target for several methods of pulling
youdown into collapse. Well, back to the original story.We are talking of
holding companies in trouble. Th
e international bankershave removed responsibility from themselves. They passed
the notes, etc.on to the holding companies who in turn made the bad loans. All
that moneybelonging to the Arabs has been passed into the holding companies.
Allthe interna
tional bankers have to do is say to the Arabs, 'You are broke.As of today--all
gone!' When the Arabs demand payment of the 30 year termnotes, the holding
companies are insolvent--simple as that, no funds--broke.Do you see now, that
this group 'made'
people some years back and nowthey can 'break' them with equal speed and
efficiency without beingaccountable?I fear, friends, it is not very different
from what is being doneunto you dear ones. BUT, that is another story. Here
things began to happen
rapidly and with sleight of hand. There havefollowed myriads of liquidations,
foreclosures and bankruptcies which wereeffected by the FDIC and FSLIC which
are under the total control of theFederal Reserve Board. Literally dozens of
banks all over Ame
rica quicklywere, and are, being bought up. But the big question is by whom?
Who hasthe money in sufficient amounts to make such purchases? The great sums
comefrom the higher oil price money that goes to the Arabs, thedeposited into
the international
 bankers' banks. The banks being purchasedare then intentionally closed. Some
of those banks are still solvent.They are also buying up farm land throughout
America through the farmers whoare now being put into bankruptcy because of the
high American
dollar (in relation-ship to foreign currency). At least this is the way it was
up to a year or soago--it is fluctuating somewhat at the present time for other
heinous thingsare under way which are the next step in the plan. I shall not go
into thoset
hings in this document for I intend to do a document relative to youreconomies.
First, let us consider what is happening now and has been, foryour past few
years--a lot of things are being done now through the Orientalcommunities. Ah
so?
 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?What happens next after this point in insolvency and
negotiations, is thatthe assets would have to be liquidated. The Arabs now have
to liquidate.They bought farmland, for instance, all over America. Likewise
theybought stocks in a
 lot of corporations as well as a lot of bonds and someother kinds of real
estate. In fact, they have controlled a large portionof the New York Stock
Exchange. Keep in mind the Japanese control a largeportion, also.Let us look at
the morning followin
g the notice of bankruptcy. The Arabswill dump their stocks onto the New York
Stock Exchange and what is going to happen when billions of dollars worth of
their stock comes on the market?I am talking billions and billions of dollars
and, suddenly, th
ere itall is to be sold!What happens to farmland that is already depressed? In
1987 prime farmlandthat had been worth $3,000 an acre was less than $700 per
acre becauseof deflation and the inability to repay farm loans. Now you have
addeddrought and
all sorts of other bad dreams. By the way, this deflation wasbrought about by
your Federal Reserve System. Well, the Arabs don't wantthat farmland, they have
all the problems they can handle. What happensto the price of farmland? It is
going right to
 the floor isn't it?Brothers, when that happens with the value what does it
mean? It meansit has no collateral value any longer. With no collateral value,
how cana farmer borrow money next year for his crops? In turn, what happensto
the crops? Who is
 going to feed the people? What is going to happenin the grocery markets? The
results, of course, equates to hunger andscarce supply. Sad, brothers, but it
is a well laid plan working toperfection.It all boils down to CONTROL and how
do you ever reco
ver. Further, let uslook at your stock situation. What is going to happen when
thesemultitudes of stocks are dumped on the stock market? Chaos. Whatwill be
the result of catastrophic chaos? IT HAS BEEN DESIGNEDTO THROW THE AMERICAN
STOCK EXCHANGES, P
RIVATE CORPORATIONS, PRIVATEBUSINESS, AMERICAN REAL ESTATE AND QUITE FRANKLY,
THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL,INTO A STATE OF TOTAL CONFUSION. TO THE RESCUE! Let me
finish theplan for you. At the time of total confusion and inability to
function,those benevole
nt bankers are going to come through with a 'save the worldproposal'. They are
going to be prepared to eliminatecash because of its collapse. Secondarily,
they must then stop drugtrafficking. Then, they must also push to stop tax
cheating. Now, whats
elf respecting American citizen can possibly be against such noble efforts?They
(the bankers) have set up and orchestrated all of these programs and nowwill
pretend to stop them.What will the average American do when your television
says, 'Look atwha
t those dirty Arabs have done to you?' What would you do? You aregoing to
believe what they tell you, aren't you? You are going to be rightup there in
front saying 'Sure they did it to us. Those Arabs want tocontrol the world.'
Pretty soon it will be
, 'Those Japanese want to controlthe whole world,' and then, 'The Chinese want
to control the whole world."You will join the chant that says, 'Look they
bought up all this major partof America. Look at all the money we have given
them, and see what t
hey havedone. They have collapsed our stock market, et cetera and so on'.Ah ha,
but here come your benevolent bankers and they are going to say to you,'You
have got to have a new currency and then the next thing we will dois use that
new currency to
stop this dope trafficking. You know, that whichis coming in from Central
America and those other countries. Then, ofcourse, we are also going to have to
have a debit card to stop people fromtax cheating because, after all, Mr.
Public, if we don't do
 this we willnever get ourselves back on our feet. So, brothers, if you'll just
turneverything over to us benevolent bankers we will take care of everythingand
straighten out the whole mess.' You know what, brethren? You willhop on that
bandwagon and
 agree to your imprisonment like babes to candy.You will not only agree to it;
you will demand it. For you will forget tohear the big IF. 'YOU WILL GET ALL
THIS DONE FOR YOU IF YOU WILL JUST TAKEA DEBIT CARD FOR YOU INDIVIDUALLY WITH
OUR LITTLE OLD N
UMBER ON IT!'YOU WILL HAVE JUST FALLEN FOR THE OLD IDENTIFICATION CARD
SCHEME.HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN TO YOU? BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD THE
TRUTH,FRIENDS, AND WILL YOU BELIEVE IT NOW AS I GIVE IT TO YOU? NO, MOST OF
YOUWILL DISCOUNT ME AS A FIGMEN
T OF SOME NUT'S (GBL's?) WILD IMAGINATION.SO BE IT FOR I AM GREATLY SADDENED
FOR YOU AS A SPECIES.              THE NEW CURRENCYThis has been a scenario
about the Middle East. Where do you think you aretoday and what do you think
you will be when you
 have this new currency?It will only devaluate the old 'dollar' to zero. It is
planned already andnamed already; the Phoenix. A little prior to this, there is
a plan to bringforth an international credit card ID. Let us refer to it as
agovernment ID
card with your social security number on it which wouldbe, and get this because
the next is important, satellite linked throughthe Star Wars system. Does any
of this sound familiar to you? Thisprogram of Star Wars is at least 60% geared
towards this
very purposeand only 40% for the claimed defense systems, etc.This major space
linkup will facilitate the transmission of bankinginformation throughout the
world instantly. This would be a debit cardwith a number which would be
required for you to do
 business, and friends,if you know anything at all about your Biblical
prophecies, God hasalready told you it will be, it will take place. Further, it
will bedone in such a clever way that you 'Christians' who say you will
NEVERsign up nor participat
e will never see it hit you and you will havejoined the program without even
realizing it. How else are you going tosurvive? Let us not be foolish in our
claims for you are dealing with themost clever planners who have out thought
you completely up t
o this date.Now, I hope you will believe me when I tell you that the 'Star
Wars'program of satellite systems is in place. Satellites are up there,friends.
We of other planets are allowed to stop nuclear warheads--we are notpermitted
to touch satellit
es which are not geared to some type ofnuclear detonation.Well, all those
wonder filled bits of technology called eyes in the skyand spy satellites 'for
you security' are really forthe purpose of transfer of the very banking and
income information wh
ichI have just been describing. It can set up immediate transfer of funds
fromall over the entire world, from the debit card, that the
internationalistswill see to it are established with every living person. You
will be on thesystem whether you know
 it or not. In fact, you who are old enough to readthese words--and every
child--is already entered therein.All information will be entered into a
central computer and from that placethe world will come under instant financial
control. So, dear Ameri
cans,you have just paid you hard earned money to finance that program
toinitiate the bankers' international credit card system and number systemthat
will be implemented whether or not you choose of it. IT IS DONE,BROTHERS, IT IS
PLACE--DONE! DON'T TE
LL ME YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE--YOU ARE ALREADY A PARTICIPANT, DEAR LITTLE
ONES.Oh yes, what of your defense system? Doesn't look too good does it?Well,
we are not going to let those nuclear warheads out here in outspace past one
hundred fifty miles
anyway. That is our prerogativeand we stop them or dismantle them.
HEAR MEDo you not see, brothers, that this is the way the prophecies are
cominginto your focus? It is happening all about you but you don't seem toknow
what it is you lo
ok for.Please, all I want you to do at present is HEAR ME. There is naught
youcan do about it to any great extent as it stands.You who will hear me and
mine own groups, hear me. You must utilize allof the remaining time to its
maximum efficiency for
we will have to continueto work under the new systems. Our projects will never
be less thanexcellent investments and they must, and will, be funded. It needs
to bedone rapidly, however, before we are caught up in the total collapse of
themonetary sys
tem. We can work through depression if we have fundings--monetarycollapse shuts
us down for all practical purposes, until the system can beput on track and
functioning.It can work and will work, for in these confused, rushed and
harassed daysthere is
 great madness to shift money and make money on money and etc.Countries such as
China, Japan--all non hard currency countries are desperateto convert to
dollars.I will further tell you that your governments know we are here. They
alsoknow we are not
here to interfere. We are here to walk our people througha transition and we
plan nothing subversive. We do plan good businessventures and welcome all who
wish to participate. We have no communes,all work for fair reward. We plan good
business with t
otal integrityand latest technology. We are here to help, not overthrow. We are
hereonly to walk our brothers through, for it will all come down just as
theprophecies are given. There will be some very bad times ahead mostsurely if
plans are not made
 for those days of tribulation.Let me speak a bit more regarding 'timing'. I
know that what Ihave said is truth.It was confirmed by top sources in
Switzerland that by October of last yearthere were twelve debtor nations who
had agreed to the proposal
 of debtforgiveness in exchange for perpetual consignment of natural
resources.There only need to be one or two more that give enough leverage to
announcethe Arabs bankrupt. As of now, all the top leaders in the Arab world
knowthe story and they are
scared to death about it. They don't know what theyare going to do about it;
there is actually nothing they can do about it.They certainly do not know how
to announce it to their populace. Theredoesn't seem to be any way to get the
information out to
 the people.Further, no one knows how to announce all this to the American
people.It has been attempted by some and fallen on deaf ears. I hope that bythe
time many of you have read this document, there will be recognitionof our
presence in your spac
e. What I tell you is truth.             IN SUMMARYI would like now, to sum up
this scenario.Because the 20 to 1 debt to asset banking ratio also operates in
reverse(that's how it is with leverage), it only takes about five percentof the
the third wo
rld nations to declare bankruptcy and when they do,and they accept the plan of
the international bankers, then the bankers candeclare the bank holding
companies bankrupt. Because of the reverseleverage of the loans, only 5% of the
third world countri
es couldbasically declare the world bankrupt and the ownership of all falls to
theinternational bankers.When this program is initiated and in place, it will
wind up with the international bankers owning all mortgages and all properties.
Whatis that g
oing to do to your country? What about the world? What controlwill they have
when they initiate the debit card? It will be an automaticnumber which will be
given and would be required because the countryis devastated.It would then
result that the int
ernational bankers, who are made up ofall these secret and complex committees I
have previously discussed,would now own the majority of the United States and
most other countries(for all will fall in short order), would control the Arab
world andther
efore, by about a thirty year plan of manipulation, will havebrought the
peoples of the world under control.Two years ago, your Senator George Hansen
said you had only about a yearto get this under control, to get the information
out and do something
about it. Well, your year has passed into two and a half. How much haveyou
heard about it? I doubt very much. Brothers, this is how men makeslaves of
their fellow men.It has, however, been prophesied since the beginning of your
world that thesethings
 would come to pass. This statement is not to give you negativefeelings. This
is to tell you that you are IN the time of evolution ofyour planet where these
things are now coming to be.I go through all this that you might recognize the
signs which ar
e allaround you. The time, in your perception of time, is fleeting. The
'time'we call sequence of events--is fleeting. We have much to do and weare
here ad available to assist you one of God and the children ofyou planet called
Earth Terra. You are a
 sister planet to we of thePleiades. Many of our ones walk among you. There are
many duties and jobsthat must now be finished.The story, the work, will go out
for that is God's promise to man. Hispromise is to allow man to hear and to
see, followed b
y proof. He willsend these things through us of the space brotherhood.These
things shall be documented and sent forth to man so that man can seewhat he
wishes to do--what choices he wishes to make regarding his divinity.I am going
to leave this porti
on now, that you ones can ponder these things.We come in love and we can see
farther than you. We have access to allrecords, so we can see and know. We can
give assistance if we are sopetitioned. And you might ask, 'Why would you ones
do that?' Becau
seFather God the Totality, the Light which is your Source and My Sourceloved
you enough to send forth His Celestial Son, before us. We now servethat same
'Son' who is our Commander and act in His service.Further, for you who are our
brothers, we will
 not leave you stranded onthat place. Ye who do not yet know me, will come to
understanding of ourpresence. I leave mine seal and my blessings on this
portion, which I fearis quite lengthy. Please ponder it several times until you
haveunderstanding f
or it is most important.Go Dharma, it has been such a terribly long session for
you. Turn thepapers over to the others that you may get some rest.Salu, Salu,
Salu    Hatonn moving to stand-by.   <The End - Grey Men Tape>-----------------
