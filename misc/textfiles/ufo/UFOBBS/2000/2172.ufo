Light in the sky meteor --- maybe.

WASHINGTON - Thousands of people in the eastern United States reported seeing
a strange blueish-green light in the sky last night which some experts said
could have been an unusually large meteorite.
   "We are quite confident it was not a man-made object re-enterring," said
Maj. Dick Adam, public affairs officer for the North American Aerospace De-
fense Command in Colorado Springs. "We have no idea what it was."
   Robert Gribble of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle reported re-
ceiving dozens of calls. "Based on descriptions that have been given, I'd say
we are dealing with a very large solid, a very large meteor," Gribble said.
