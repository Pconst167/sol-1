       A faint pair of stars, 220 trillion miles away, has been tentatively 
    identified as the "home  base"   of  intelligent extraterrestrials  who 
    allegedly visited Earth in 1961. This hypothesis is based on a strange, 
    almost bizarre  series  of  events mixing  astronomical  research  with 
    hypnosis, amnesia, and alien humanoid creatures. 
    
       The two stars  are known as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli,  or together 
    as simply Zeta Reticuli. They are each fifth magnitude stars --  barely 
    visible  to  the  unaided  eye  --   located  in  the  obscure  souther 
    constellation  Reticulum.   This  southerly  sky  location  makes  Zeta 
    Reticuli invisible to observers north of Mexico City's latitude. 
    
       The  weird  circumstances  that we have  dubbed  "The  Zeta Reticuli 
    Incident"   sound like they come straight from the UFO pages in one  of 
    those tabloids sold in every supermarket. But this is much more  than a 
    retelling  of  a famous UFO incident;  it's an  astronomical  detective 
    story  that at times hovers on that hazy line  that  separates  science 
    from fiction. It all started this way: 
     
       The date is Sept.  19,  1961.  A  middle aged New  Hampshire couple, 
    Betty  and  Barney Hill,  are driving home from  a  short  vacation  in 
    Canada.  It's dark,  with the moon  and  stars illuminating the  wooded 
    landscape  along U.S.  Route 3 in central  New Hampshire.   The  Hills' 
    curiosity is aroused when a bright "star" seems to move in an irregular 
    pattern.  They stop the car for a better view. The object moves closer, 
    and its disklike shape becomes evident. 
    
       Barney  grabs  his binoculars from the car seat and steps  out.   He 
    walks into a field to get  a closer look,  focuses the binoculars,  and 
    sees the object plainly.  It has windows --   and behind  the  windows, 
    looking directly at  him  are...humanoid creatures!  Terrified,  Barney 
    stumbles back to the car, throws it into first gear and roars off.  But 
    for some reason he turns down  a  side road where five of the humanoids 
    are standing on the road. 
    
       Apparently  unable to control their actions,  Betty and  Barney  are 
    easily taken back to the ship by the humanoids. While inside they   are 
    physically  examined,  and one of the humanoids communicates to  Betty. 
    After the examination she asks him where they are  from. In response he 
    shows her a three-dimensional map with various  sized dots and lines on 
    it.  "Where are you on the map?"  the humanoid asks Betty.  She doesn't 
    know, so the subject is dropped. 
    
       Betty and Barney are returned unharmed to their car.  They  are told 
    they will forget the abduction portion of the incident. The ship rises, 
    and then hurtles out of sight.  The couple continue their journey  home 
    oblivious of the abduction. 
    
       But  the Hills are troubled by unexplained dreams and anxiety  about 
    two  hours of their trip that they can't account for.  Betty,  a social 
    worker,  asks advice from a psychiatrist friend.  He  suggests that the 
    memory of that time will be gradually restored over the next few months 
    -- but it never is.  Two years after the incident, the couple are still 
    bothered by the missing two hours, and Barney's ulcers are acting up. A 
    Boston psychiatrist, Benjamin Simon,  is recommended, and after several 
    months of weekly hypnosis sessions  the bizarre events of that night in 
    1961   are revealed.  A  short time later a UFO group leaks a distorted 
    version  of the story  to the press and the whole thing blows up.   The 
    Hills reluctantly disclose the entire story. 
     
       Can we  take  this dramatic scenario seriously?  Did this incredible 
    contact with aliens actually occur or is it some kind of  hallucination 
    that  affected both Barney and Betty Hill?  The complete account of the 
    psychiatric examination from which the details of  the event emerged is 
    related  in  John G.  Fuller's 'The Interrupted Journey'  (Dial  Press, 
    1966),  where we read that after the extensive psychiatric examination, 
    Simon concluded that the Hills were not fabricating the story. The most 
    likely possibilities seem to be: (a)  the experience actually happened, 
    or  (b)   some perceptive and  illusory misinterpretations occurred  in 
    relationship to some real event. 
    
       There are  other  cases of  alleged  abductions  by extraterrestrial 
    humanoids.  The  unique aspect of  the  Hills' abduction  is  that they 
    remembered virtually nothing of the incident. 
    
       Intrigued by the Hills' experience, J.  Allen Hynek, chairman of the 
    department   of  astronomy  at  Northwestern  University,   decided  to 
    investigate.   Hynek  described how the Hills recalled the  details  of 
    their  encounter  in his book,  'The UFO  Experience'   (Henry  Regnery 
    Company, 1972): 
     
       "Under  repeated  hypnosis  they  independently  revealed  what  had 
    supposedly  happened.  The two stories agreed in  considerable  detail, 
    although neither Betty nor Barney was privy to what the  other had said 
    under  hypnosis until much later.  Under hypnosis they stated that they 
    had  been  taken  separately aboard the craft,   treated  well  by  the 
    occupants --  rather as humans might treat experimental animals --  and 
    then released after having been given the hypnotic suggestion that they 
    would  remember  nothing of that particular experience.  The method  of 
    their  release  supposedly  accounted  for  the  amnesia,   which   was 
    apparently broken only by counterhypnosis." 
     
       A  number  of  scientists,  including Hynek,   have  discussed  this 
    incident  at length with Barney and Betty Hill and have questioned them 
    under hypnosis.  They concur with Simon's belief that there seems to be 
    no  evidence of outright fabrication or lying.  One  would  also wonder 
    what  Betty,   who  has  a master's degree in  social  work  and  is  a 
    supervisor in the New Hampshire Welfare Department, and Barney, who was 
    on the governor of New Hampshire's Civil  Rights Commission, would have 
    to gain by a hoax? Although the Hills didn't,  several people have lost 
    their jobs after being associated with similarly unusual publicity. 
    
       Stanton T. Friedman, a nuclear physicist and the nation's only space 
    scientist  devoting full time to researching the UFO  phenomenon,   has 
    spent many hours in conversation with the Hills.  "By no stretch of the 
    imagination could anyone who knows them conclude that  they were nuts," 
    he emphasizes. 
    
       So the experience remains a fascinating story despite the absence of 
    proof that it actually happened. Anyway -- that's where things  were in 
    1966 when Marjorie Fish,  an Ohio schoolteacher, amateur astronomer and 
    member of Mensa,  became involved. She wondered if the objects shown on 
    the map that Betty Hill  allegedly  observed  inside the  vehicle might 
    represent  some    actual  pattern of celestial objects.  To  get  more 
    information about the map she decided to visit Betty Hill in the summer 
    of 1969.   (Barney Hill died in early 1969.) Here is Ms. Fish's account 
    of that meeting: 
     
       "On Aug.4,  1969,  Betty Hill discussed the star map with me.  Betty 
    explained that she drew the map in 1964  under posthypnotic suggestion.   
    It  was to be drawn only if she could remember it accurately,   and she 
    was not to pay attention to what she was drawing --  which  puts it  in 
    the realm of automatic drawing.  This is a way of getting  at repressed 
    or forgotten material and can result in unusual  accuracy. She made two 
    erasures showing her conscious mind took control part of the time. 
    
       "Betty described the map as three-dimensional,  like looking through 
    a window.  The stars were tinted and glowed.  The map material was flat 
    and thin (not a model),  and there were  no noticeable lenticular lines 
    like one of  our three-dimensional processes. (It sounds very much like 
    a reflective hologram.)  Betty did not shift her position while viewing 
    it,  so we cannot tell if it would give the same three-dimensional view 
    from  all  positions or  if it  would be completely  three-dimensional. 
    Betty estimated the map was  approximately three feet wide and two feet 
    high with the  pattern covering most of the map. She was standing about 
    three  feet away from it.   She said there were many other stars on the 
    map  but  she  only (apparently)  was able to specifically  recall  the 
    prominent ones connected  by lines and a small distinctive triangle off 
    to the left.  There was no concentration of stars to indicate the Milky 
    Way (galactic  plane)   suggesting  that  if it represented reality, it 
    probably only contained local stars. There were no grid lines." 
     
       So  much for the background material on the Hill incident.   (If you 
    want more details on the encounter,  see Fuller's book). For the moment 
    we  will leave Marjorie Fish back in 1969  trying  to  interpret  Betty 
    Hill's  reproduction  of  the map.  There is a  second  major  area  of 
    background information that we have to attend to before we can properly 
    discuss the map.  Unlike the bizarre events just described, the rest is 
    pure astronomy. 
    
       According  to the most recent star catalogs,  there are about  1,000 
    known stars within a radius of 55 light-years of the sun. 
    
       What are those other stars like?  A check of the catalogs shows that 
    most of them are faint stars of relatively low temperature --  a  class 
    of  stars  astronomers call main sequence stars.  The  sun  is  a  main 
    sequence  star  along with most of the other stars in this part of  the 
    Milky Way galaxy, as the following table shows: 
     
                      Main sequence stars             91% 
                      White dwarfs                     8% 
                      Giants and Supergiants           1% 
     
       Typical giant stars are Arcturus and Capella. Antares and Betelgeuse 
    are members of the ultrarare supergiant class. At the other  end of the 
    size and brightness scale the white dwarfs  are stellar  cinders -- the 
    remains of once brilliant suns. For reasons that will soon become clear 
    we  can  remove  these  classes  of  stars  from  our  discussion   and 
    concentrate on the main  sequence stars whose characteristics are shown 
    in the table.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The  spectral  class  letters  are  part  of  a  system  of  stellar 
    "fingerprinting"  that identifies the main sequence star's  temperature 
    and gives clues to its mass and luminosity.  The hottest, brightest and 
    most  massive  main  sequence stars (with rare exceptions)  are  the  A 
    stars. The faintest, coolest and least massive are the M stars. 
    
       Each class is subdivided into 10  subcategories. For example,  an A0 
    star is hotter, brighter and more massive than an A1  which is above an 
    A2, and so on through A9. 
    
       This table  supplies  much  additional information and  shows  how a 
    slightly  hotter  and  more  massive star turns out  to  be  much  more 
    luminous than the sun,  a G2 star.  But the bright stars pay dearly for 
    their splendor.  It takes a lot of stellar fuel to emit vast quantities 
    of light and heat.  The penalty is a short lifespan as a main  sequence 
    star.  Conversely, the inconspicuous, cool M stars may be around to see 
    the end of the universe --whatever that might be.  With all these facts 
    at  hand  we're  now ready to tackle the first part  of  the  detective 
    story. 
    
       Let's suppose we wanted to make our own map of a trip to the  stars. 
    We  will  limit ourselves to the 55  light-year radius covered  by  the 
    detailed  star catalogs.  The purpose of the trip will be to search for 
    intelligent life on planets that may be in orbit around these stars. We 
    would want to include every star that would seem likely to have a life-
    bearing planet orbiting around it. How many of these thousand-odd stars 
    would  we  include for such a voyage and which direction would  we  go? 
    (For the moment,  we'll forget about the problem of making a spacecraft 
    that  will take us to these stars and we'll assume that we've got  some 
    kind of vehicle that will effortlessly transport us to wherever we want 
    to go.) We don't want to waste our time and efforts --  we only want to 
    go to stars that we would think would have a high probability of having 
    planets  harboring advanced life forms.  This seems like a tall  order. 
    How  do  we even begin to determine which stars might likely have  such 
    planets? 
    
       The first rule will be to restrict ourselves to life as we know  it, 
    the  kind  of life that we are familiar with here on Earth  --   carbon 
    based  life.  Science fiction writers are fond of describing life forms 
    based on chemical systems that we have been unable to duplicate here on 
    Earth  --   such as silicon based life or life based  on  the  ammonium 
    hydroxide molecule instead of on carbon. But right now these life forms 
    are  simply  fantasy  --   we have no evidence that they  are  in  fact 
    possible.  Because we don't even know what they might look like --   if 
    they're  out there --  we necessarily have to limit our search  to  the 
    kind of life that we understand. 
    
       Our  kind  of life --  life as we know it --  seems most  likely  to 
    evolve on a planet that has a stable temperature regime.  It must be at 
    the  appropriate distance from its sun so that water is neither  frozen 
    nor boiled away.  The planet has to be the appropriate size so that its 
    gravity  doesn't hold on to too much atmosphere (like Jupiter)  or  too 
    little (like Mars). But the main ingredient in a life-bearing planet is 
    its star.  And its star is the only thing we can study since planets of 
    other stars are far too faint to detect directly. 
    
       The conclusion we can draw is this: The star has to be like the sun. 
    
       Main  sequence stars are basically stable for long periods of  time. 
    As shown in the table,  stars in spectral class G have stable lifespans 
    of 10  billion years.  (Our sun,  actually a G2  star,  has a  somewhat 
    longer stable life expectancy of 11  billion years.)  We are about five 
    billion  years  into  that  period so we can look forward  to  the  sun 
    remaining  much  as  it is (actually it will  brighten  slightly)   for 
    another  six  billion years.  Stars of class F4  or higher have  stable 
    burning periods of less than 3.5  billion years.  They have to be ruled 
    out  immediately.  Such stars cannot have life-bearing planets because, 
    at least based on our experience on our world,  this is not enough time 
    to  permit  highly developed biological systems to evolve on  the  land 
    areas  of a planet.  (Intelligent life may very well arise  earlier  in 
    water environments, but let's forget that possibility since we have not 
    yet had meaningful communication with the dolphins --highly intelligent 
    creatures on this planet!)  But we may be wrong in our estimate of life 
    development  time.   There  is  another  more  compelling  reason   for 
    eliminating stars of class F4 and brighter. 
     
       So  far,   we have assumed all stars have planets,  just as our  sun 
    does.   Yet  spectroscopic studies of stars of class F4   and  brighter 
    reveal  that most of them are in fact unlike our sun in a vital way  -- 
    they  are rapidly rotating stars.  The sun rotates once in just under a 
    month,  but 60 percent of the stars in the F0  to F4  range rotate much 
    faster.  And almost all A stars are rapid rotators too. It seems,  from 
    recent studies of stellar evolution that slowly rotating stars like the 
    sun  rotate slowly because they have planets.  Apparently the formation 
    of a planetary system robs the star of much of its rotational momentum. 
    
       For two reasons, then, we eliminate stars of class F4 and above: (1) 
    most  of  them rotate rapidly and thus seem to be planetless,  and  (2) 
    their stable lifespans are too brief for advanced life to develop. 
    
       Another problem environment for higher forms of life is the multiple 
    star system. About half of all stars are born in pairs, or small groups 
    of three or more. Our sun could have been part of a double star system. 
    If Jupiter was 80 times more massive it would be an M6  red dwarf star. 
    If  the stars of a double system are far enough apart there is no  real 
    problem  for  planets sustaining life (see "Planet of the Double  Sun", 
    September 1974).  But stars in fairly close or highly elliptical orbits 
    would alternately fry or freeze their planets.  Such planets would also 
    likely have unstable orbits.  Because this is a potentially troublesome 
    area  for  our objective,  we will eliminate all close  and  moderately 
    close pairs of systems of multiple stars. 
    
       Further  elimination is necessary according to the  catalogs.   Some 
    otherwise perfect stars are labeled "variable".  This means astronomers 
    have observed variations of at least a few percent in the star's  light 
    output.  A  one percent fluctuation in the sun would be annoying for us 
    here  on Earth.  Anything greater would cause climatic disaster.  Could 
    intelligent  life  evolve  under such conditions,  given  an  otherwise 
    habitable  planet?  It seems unlikely.  We are forced to "scratch"  all 
    stars suspected or proven to be variable. 
    
       This still leaves a few F stars, quite a few G stars,  and hoards of 
    K and M dwarfs. Unfortunately most of the Ks and all of the Ms are out. 
    Let's find out why. 
    
       These stars quite likely have planets.  Indeed, one M star --  known 
    as Barnard's star -- is believed to almost certainly have at least one, 
    and probably two or three,  Jupiter sized planets. Peter Van de Kamp of 
    the  Sproul  Observatory  at  Swarthmore  College  (Pa.)   has  watched 
    Barnard's  star  for  over  three  decades  and  is  convinced  that  a 
    "wobbling"  motion of that star is due to perturbations  (gravitational 
    "pulling  and  pushing")  caused by its unseen planets.   (Earth  sized 
    planets cannot be detected in this manner.) 
    
       But the planets of M stars and the K stars below K4 have two serious 
    handicaps  that  virtually eliminate them from being abodes  for  life. 
    First,  these stars fry their planets with occasional lethal bursts  of 
    radiation emitted from erupting solar flares.  The flares have the same 
    intensity as those of our sun, but when you put that type of flare on a 
    little  star it spells disaster for a planet that is within,  say,   30 
    million miles. The problem is that planets have to be that close to get 
    enough heat from these feeble suns. If they are farther out,  they have 
    frozen oceans and no life. 
    
       The  close-in orbits of potential Earthlike planets of M and faint K 
    stars  produce the second dilemma --  rotational lock.  An  example  of 
    rotational  lock  is right next door to us.  The moon,  because of  its 
    nearness  to Earth,  is strongly affected by our planet's tidal forces. 
    Long  ago  our  satellite  stopped  rotating  and  now  has  one   side 
    permanently turned toward Earth.  The same principles apply to  planets 
    of  small  stars  that  would otherwise be at the  right  distance  for 
    moderate temperatures. If rotational lock has not yet set in,  at least 
    rotational  retardation would make impossibly long days and nights  (as 
    evidenced by Mercury in our solar system). 
    
       What  stars  are  left after all this pruning?  All of the  G  stars 
    remain along with F5 through F9 and K0 through K4.  Stephen Dole of the 
    Rand  Corporation has made a detailed study of stars in this range  and 
    suggests  we should also eliminate F5,  F6  and F7  stars because  they 
    balloon  to red giants before they reach an age of five billion  years. 
    Dole feels this is cutting it too fine for intelligent species to fully 
    evolve. Admittedly this is based on our one example of intelligent life 
    --   us.  But limited though this parameter is,  it is the only one  we 
    have.  Dole believes the K2,  K3  and K4  stars are also poor prospects 
    because of their feeble energy output and consequently limited zone for 
    suitable Earthlike planets. 
    
       Accepting   Dole's  further  trimming  we  are  left  with   single, 
    nonvariable  stars  from F8  through all the Gs to K1.  What does  that 
    leave us with? Forty-six stars. 
    
       Now we are ready to plan the trip. It's pretty obvious that Tau Ceti 
    is our first target. After that, the choice is more difficult. We can't 
    take  each star in order or we would be darting all over the sky.  It's 
    something  like planning a vacation trip.  Let's say we start from  St. 
    Louis and want to hit all the major cities within a 1,000  mile radius. 
    If  we  go  west,  all we can visit is Kansas  City  and  Denver.   But 
    northeast  is  a bonanza:  Chicago,  Detroit,  Cleveland,   Pittsburgh, 
    Philadelphia,   New York and more.  The same principle applies  to  the 
    planning of our interstellar exploration.  The plot of all 46 candidate 
    stars  reveals a clumping in the direction of the constellations  Cetus 
    and Eridanus.  Although this section amounts to only 13  percent of the 
    entire sky, it contains 15 of the 46 stars, or 33 percent of the total. 
    Luckily Tau Ceti is in this group, so that's the direction we should go 
    (comparable to heading northeast from St.  Louis).  If we plan to visit 
    some of these solar type stars and then return to Earth,  we should try 
    to  have  the shortest distance between stops.  It would be a waste  of 
    exploration time if we zipped randomly from one star to another. 
    
       Now we are ready to return to the map drawn by Betty Hill.  Marjorie 
    Fish  reasoned  that  if the stars in the Hill map  corresponded  to  a 
    patter of real stars -- perhaps something like we just developed,  only 
    from  an  alien's viewpoint --  it might be possible  to  pinpoint  the 
    origin  of the alleged space travelers.  Assuming the two stars in  the 
    foreground  of the Hill map were the "base"  stars (the sun,  a  single 
    star,   was ruled out here),  she decided to try to locate  the  entire 
    pattern.   She theorized that the Hill map contained only  local  stars 
    since no concentration would be present if a more distant viewpoint was 
    assumed and if both "us"  and the alien visitors'  home base were to be 
    represented. 
    
       Let's assume,  just as an astronomical exercise,  that the map  does 
    show  the sun and the star that is "the sun"  to the humanoids.   We'll 
    take the Hill encounter at face value, and see where it leads. 
    
       Since the aliens were described as "humanoid"  and seemed reasonably 
    comfortable on this planet,  their home planet should be basically like 
    ours.   Their  atmosphere  must be similar because the  Hills  breathed 
    without trouble while inside the ship, and the aliens did not appear to 
    wear  any protective apparatus.  And since we assume their  biology  is 
    similar to ours,  their planet should have the same temperature  regime 
    as  Earth  (Betty and Barney did say it was uncomfortably cold  in  the 
    ship).   In essence,  then,  we assume their home planet must  be  very 
    Earthlike. Based on what we discussed earlier it follows that their sun 
    would be on our list if it were within 55 light-years of us. 
    
       The lines on the map, according to Betty Hill, were described by the 
    alien  as  "trade routes"  or "places visited occasionally"   with  the 
    dotted lines as "expeditions". Any interpretation of the Betty Hill map 
    must retain the logic of these routes (i.e.  the lines would link stars 
    that would be worth visiting). 
    
       Keeping  all this in mind,  Marjorie Fish constructed several three-
    dimensional models of the solar neighborhood in hopes of detecting  the 
    pattern  in  the  Hill  map.  Using beads  dangling  on  threads,   she 
    painstakingly recreated our stellar environment.  Between Aug. 1968 and 
    Feb. 1973, she strung beads, checked data,  searched and checked again. 
    A suspicious alignment,  detected in late 1968, turned out to be almost 
    a  perfect  match once new data from the detailed 1969  edition of  the 
    Catalog of Nearby Stars became available. (This catalog is often called 
    the "Gliese catalog"  --  pronounced "glee-see" --  after its principal 
    author, Wilhelm Gliese.)

    This table lists all known stars within a radius of 54 light-years that 
    are single or part of a wide multiple star system.  They have no  known 
    irregularities or variabilities and are between 0.4  and 2.0  times the 
    luminosity  of the sun.  Thus,  a  planet basically identical to  Earth 
    could  be  orbiting around any one of them.  (Data from the Catalog  of 
    Nearby Stars, 1969 edition, by Wilhelm Gliese.) 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
       The 16  stars in  the  stellar  configuration discovered by Marjorie 
    Fish  are compared with the map drawn by Betty Hill in  the diagram  on 
    page 6.  If some of the star names on the Fish map sound familiar, they 
    should. Ten of the 16 stars are from the compact group that we selected 
    earlier  based  on  the most logical direction  to  pursue  to  conduct 
    interstellar exploration from Earth. 
                                                                     
     Continuing to take the  Hill map at face value,  the radiating pattern 
    of "trade routes" implies that Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli are the "hub" 
    of exploration or,  in the context of the  incident,   the aliens' home 
    base.   The  sun is at the end of one of the supposedly  regular  trade 
    routes. 
     
     The  pair  of stars that make up Zeta Reticuli is practically  in  the 
    midst  of  the cluster of solar type stars that attracted us  while  we 
    were mapping out  a logical  interstellar  voyage.  Checking further we 
    find that all but two of the stars in the Fish pattern are on the table 
    of  nearby solar type stars.  These two stars are Tau 1 Eridani (an  F6 
    star) and Gliese 86.1 (K2), and are, respectively, just above and below 
    the  parameters we arrived at earlier.  One star that should  be  there 
    (Zeta Tucanae) is missing probably because it is behind Zeta 1 Reticuli 
    at the required viewing angle. 
                                                                     
       To summarize,  then: (1) the pattern discovered by Marjorie Fish has 
    an uncanny resemblance to the map drawn by Betty Hill;  (2)  the  stars 
    are  mostly the ones that we would visit if we were exploring from Zeta 
    Reticuli, and (3) the travel patterns generally make sense. 
     
       Walter Mitchell,  professor of astronomy at Ohio State University in 
    Columbus,   has  looked at Marjorie Fish's interpretation of the  Betty 
    Hill map in detail and tells us, "The more I examine it,  the more I am 
    impressed by the astronomy involved in Marjorie Fish's work." 
     
       During  their  examination  of the map,  Mitchell and  some  of  his 
    students  inserted  the  positions of hundreds of nearby stars  into  a 
    computer and had various space vistas brought up on a cathode ray  tube 
    readout.   They  requested the computer to put them in a  position  out 
    beyond  Zeta Reticuli looking toward the sun.  From this viewpoint  the 
    map  pattern obtained by Marjorie Fish was duplicated with virtually no 
    variations.   Mitchell  noted an important and previously unknown  fact 
    first  pointed out by Ms.  Fish:  The stars in the map are almost in  a 
    plane;   that is,  they fill a wheel shaped volume of space that  makes 
    star hopping from one to another easy and the logical way to go --  and 
    that is what is implied by the map that Betty Hill allegedly saw. 
     
       "I  can  find  no  major  point  of  quibble  with  Marjorie  Fish's 
    interpretation  of  the Betty Hill map,"  says David R.   Saunders,   a 
    statistics  expert at the Industrial Relations Center of the University 
    of Chicago. By various lines of statistical reasoning he concludes that 
    the  chances of finding a match among 16  stars of a specific  spectral 
    type among the thousand-odd stars nearest the sun is "at least 1,000 to 
    1 against". 
     
       "The  odds  are about 10,000  to 1 against  a  random  configuration 
    matching perfectly with Betty Hill's map,"  Saunders reports.  "But the 
    star group identified by Marjorie Fish isn't quite a perfect match, and 
    the odds consequently reduce to about 1,000 to 1. That is, there is one 
    chance in 1,000  that the observed degree of congruence would occur  in 
    the volume of space we are discussing. 
     
       "In  most fields of investigation where similar statistical  methods 
    are  used,  that degree of congruence is rather persuasive,"  concludes 
    Saunders. 
     
       Saunders,   who  has developed a monumental computerized catalog  of 
    more  than 60,000  UFO sightings,  tells us that the Hill case  is  not 
    unique in its general characteristics -- there are other known cases of 
    alleged  communication with extraterrestrials.  But in no other case on 
    record have maps ever been mentioned. 
     
       Mark  Steggert  of  the Space Research Coordination  Center  at  the 
    University of Pittsburgh developed a computer program that he calls PAR 
    (for Perspective Alteration Routine)  that can duplicate the appearance 
    of star fields from various viewpoints in space. 
     
       "I was intrigued by the proposal put forth by Marjorie Fish that she 
    had interpreted a real star pattern for the alleged map of Betty  Hill. 
    I  was  incredulous  that models could be used to do  an  astronometric 
    problem," Steggert says.  "To my surprise I found that the pattern that 
    I  derived from my program had a close correspondence to the data  from 
    Marjorie Fish." 
     
       After several run-throughs, he confirmed the positions determined by 
    Marjorie Fish.  "I was able to locate potential areas of error,  but no 
    real errors," Steggert concludes. 
     
       Steggert zeroed in on possibly the only real bone of contention that 
    anyone has had with Marjorie Fish's interpretation: The data on some of 
    the  stars  may  not  be  accurate enough for  us  to  make  definitive 
    conclusions.   For  example,   he says the data  from  the  Smithsonian 
    Astrophysical  Observatory  Catalog,   the Royal  Astronomical  Society 
    Observatory  Catalog,   and  the  Yale Catalog of  Bright  Stars  "have 
    differences  of  up  to  two magnitudes  and  differences  in  distance 
    amounting to 40 percent for the star Gliese 59".  Other stars have less 
    variations  in  the data from one catalog to another,   but  Steggert's 
    point  is valid.  The data on some of the stars in the map is just  not 
    good enough to make a definitive statement. (The fact that measurements 
    of  most  of the stars in question can only be made at  the  relatively 
    poor  equipped southern hemisphere observatories accounts for the  less 
    reliable data.) 
     
       Using  information on the same 15  stars from the Royal  Observatory 
    catalog  (Annals #5),  Steggert reports that the pattern does come  out 
    differently  because  of the different data,  and Gliese 59  shows  the 
    largest variation.  The Gliese catalog uses photometric,  trigonometric 
    and  spectroscopic parallaxes and derives a mean from all  three  after 
    giving  various mathematical weights to each value.   "The  substantial 
    variation in catalog material is something that must be overcome," says 
    Steggert.   "This  must be the next step in attempting to evaluate  the 
    map." 
     
       This point of view is shared by Jeffrey L. Kretsch, an undergraduate 
    student  who  is  working under the advisement of J.   Allen  Hynek  at 
    Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Like Steggert, he too checked 
    Marjorie  Fish's pattern and found no error in the work.   But  Kretsch 
    reports  that  when  he reconstructed the pattern  using  trigonometric 
    distance  measurements instead of the composite measures in the  Gliese 
    catalog,   he found enough variations to move Gliese 95  above the line 
    between Gliese 86 and Tau 1 Eridani. 
     
       "The data for some of the stars seems to be very reliable, but a few 
    of the pattern stars are not well observed and data on them is somewhat 
    conflicting,"   says Kretsch.  The fact that the pattern is less  of  a 
    "good  fit"  using data from other sources leads Kretsch and others  to 
    wonder what new observations would do. Would they give a closer fit? Or 
    would  the  pattern become distorted?  Marjorie Fish was aware  of  the 
    catalog  variations,   but has assumed the Gliese catalog is  the  most 
    reliable source material to utilize. 
     
       Is the Gliese catalog the best available data source.  According  to 
    several  astronomers who specialize in stellar positions,  it  probably 
    is. Peter Van de Kamp says, "It's first rate. There is none better." He 
    says  the  catalog was compiled with extensive research and  care  over 
    many years. 
     
       A  lot of the published trigonometric parallaxes on the stars beyond 
    30 light-years are not as accurate as they could be,  according to Kyle 
    Cudworth  of  Yerkes  Observatory.  "Gliese  added  other  criteria  to 
    compensate and lessen the possible errors," he says. 
     
       The scientific director of the U.S.  Naval Observatory, K.A. Strand, 
    is  among  the world's foremost authorities on  stellar  distances  for 
    nearby stars.  He believes the Gliese catalog "is the most complete and 
    comprehensive source available." 
     
       Frank B.  Salisbury of the University of Utah has also examined  the 
    Hill and Fish maps.  "The pattern of stars discovered by Marjorie  Fish 
    fits  the  map drawn by Betty Hill remarkably well.   It's  a  striking 
    coincidence and forces one to take the Hill story more seriously,"   he 
    says. Salisbury is one of the few scientists who has spent some time on 
    the  UFO  problem and has written a book and several  articles  on  the 
    subject.  A  professor of plant physiology,  his biology expertise  has 
    been  turned  to  astronomy  on several occasions  while  studying  the 
    possibility of biological organisms existing on Mars. 
     
       Salisbury  insists  that  while  psychological factors  do  play  an 
    important  role in UFO phenomena,  the Hill story does represent one of 
    the most credible reports of incredible events. The fact that the story 
    and  the  map  came to light under hypnosis is good  evidence  that  it 
    actually took place. "But it is not unequivocal evidence," he cautions. 
     
       Elaborating  on  this aspect of the incident,  Mark Steggert  offers 
    this:   "I  am  inclined  to question  the  ability  of  Betty,   under 
    posthypnotic suggestion,  to duplicate the pattern two years after  she 
    saw it.  She noted no grid lines on the pattern for reference.  Someone 
    should  (or  perhaps  has already)  conduct a test to see  how  well  a 
    similar  patter could be recalled after a substantial period  of  time. 
    The stress she was under at the time is another unknown factor." 
     
       "The  derivation of the base data by hypnotic techniques is  perhaps 
    not  as  'far out'  as it may seem,"  says Stanton Friedman.   "Several 
    police  departments around the country use hypnosis on rape victims  in 
    order to get descriptions of the assailants --  descriptions that would 
    otherwise  remain repressed.  The trauma of such circumstances must  be 
    comparable in some ways to the Hill incident." 
     
       Is it at all possible we are faced with a hoax? 
     
       "Highly  unlikely,"  says Salisbury --  and the other  investigators 
    agree. One significant fact against a charade is that the data from the 
    Gliese catalog was not published until 1969,  five years after the star 
    map was drawn by Betty Hill.  Prior to 1969,  the data could only  have 
    been  obtained  from  the  observatories  conducting  research  on  the 
    specific stars in question.  It is not uncommon for astronomers not  to 
    divulge  their research data --  even to their colleagues --  before it 
    appears in print.  In general,  the entire sequence of events just does 
    not smell of falsification. Coincidence, possibly; hoax, improbable. 
     
       Where  does  all this leave us?  Are there  creatures  inhabiting  a 
    planet  of  Zeta  2 Reticuli?  Did they visit Earth in 1961?   The  map 
    indicates that the sun has been "visited occasionally".  What does that 
    mean? Will further study and measurement of the stars in the map change 
    their relative positions and thus distort the configuration beyond  the 
    limits of coincidence? 
     
       The  fact that the entire incident hinges on a map drawn under  less 
    than  normal  circumstances  certainly  keeps us from  drawing  a  firm 
    conclusion.   Exobiologists are united in their opinion that the chance 
    of  us having neighbors so similar to us,  apparently located so close, 
    is vanishingly small. But then, we don't even know for certain if there 
    is  anybody at all out there --  anywhere --  despite the Hill map  and 
    pronouncements of the most respected scientists. 
     
       The only answer is to continue the search. Someday, perhaps soon, we 
    will know.

       THE VIEW FROM ZETA RETICULI 
     
       The  two  stars that comprise the Zeta Reticuli  system  are  almost 
    identical to the sun. Thy are the only known examples of two solar type 
    stars apparently linked into a binary star system of wide separation. 
     
       Zeta  1  is separated from Zeta 2 by at least 350  billion miles  -- 
    about 100 times the sun-Pluto distance. They may be even farther apart, 
    but  the  available observations suggest they are moving through  space 
    together and are therefore physically associated. They probably require 
    at least 100,000 years to orbit around their common center of gravity. 
      
       Both Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 are prime candidates for the search for  life 
    beyond Earth. According to our current theories of planetary formation, 
    they  both  should have a retinue of planets something like  our  solar 
    system.   As yet there is no way of determining if any of the  probable 
    planets of either star is similar to Earth. 
     
       To  help visualize the Zeta Reticuli system,  let's take  the  sun's 
    nine  planets and put them in identical orbits around Zeta 2.   From  a 
    celestial  mechanics  standpoint there is no reason why this  situation 
    could  not  exist.  Would anything be different?  Because of  Zeta  2's 
    slightly smaller mass as compared with the sun, the planets would orbit 
    a little more slowly.  Our years might have 390 days, for example. Zeta 
    2   would  make  a fine sun - - slightly dimmer than  "old  Sol",   but 
    certainly  capable of sustaining life.  The big difference would not be 
    our new sun but the superstar of the night sky. Shining like a polished 
    gem,  Zeta 1 would be the dazzling highlight of the night sky -- unlike 
    anything we experience here on Earth.  At magnitude -9  it would appear 
    as  a starlike point 100  times brighter than Venus.  It would be  like 
    compressing  all  the  light from the first quarter moon into  a  point 
    source. 
     
       Zeta  1 would have long ago been the focus of religions,   mythology 
    and  astrology if it were in earthly skies.  The fact that it would  be 
    easily visible in full daylight would give Zeta 1 supreme importance to 
    both early civilizations and modern man. Shortly after the invention of 
    the  telescope astronomers would be able to detect Jupiter  and  Saturn 
    sized planets orbiting around Zeta 1.  Jupiter would be magnitude  +12, 
    visible up to 4.5 minutes of arc from Zeta 1 (almost as far as Ganymede 
    swings from Jupiter). It would not make a difficult target for an eight 
    inch  telescope.  Think of the incentive that discovery would  have  on 
    interstellar space travel!  For hundreds of years we would be aware  of 
    another  solar system just a few "light-weeks"  away.  The evolution of 
    interstellar spaceflight would be rapid, dynamic and inevitable. 
     
       By  contrast,   our nearest solar type neighbor is Tau  Ceti  at  12 
    light-years.  Even today we only suspect it is accompanied by a  family 
    of planets, but we don't know for sure. 
     
       From  this  comparison  of our planetary system with those  of  Zeta 
    Reticuli,   it  is  clear that any  emerging  technologically  advanced 
    intelligent  life  would probably have great incentive to achieve  star 
    flight.   The  knowledge of a nearby system of planets of a solar  type 
    star would be compelling -- at least it would certainly seem to be. 
     
       What is so strange --  and this question prompted us to prepare this 
    article -- is: Why, of all stars, does Zeta Reticuli seem to fit as the 
    hub of a map that appeared inside a spacecraft that allegedly landed on 
    Earth in 1961? Some of the circumstances surrounding the whole incident 
    are  certainly  bizarre,   but  not everything can be  written  off  as 
    coincidence or hallucination. It may be optimistic, on one extreme,  to 
    hope  that our neighbors are as near as 37  light-years away.  For  the 
    moment   we  will  be  satisfied  with  considering  it   an   exciting 
    possibility.

       THE AGE OF NEARBY STARS 
     
       By Jeffrey L. Kretsch 
     
       The  age of our own sun is known with some accuracy largely  because 
    we live on one of its planets.  Examination of Earth rocks -- and, more 
    recently,  rocks and soil from the moon --  has conclusively shown that 
    these two worlds went through their initial formation 4.6 billion years 
    ago.   The  formation of the sun and planets is believed to  have  been 
    virtually  simultaneous,  with the sun's birth producing the  planetary 
    offspring. 
     
       But  we have yet to travel to any other planet --  and  certainly  a 
    flight  to the surface of a planet of a nearby star is an event no  one 
    reading this will live to witness. So direct measurement of the ages of 
    nearby stars --  as a by-product of extrasolar planetary exploration -- 
    is a distant future enterprise.  We are left with information  obtained 
    from our vantage point here near Earth. There is lots of it -- so let's 
    find out what it is and what it can tell us. 
     
       When  we scan the myriad stars of the night sky,  are we looking  at 
    suns  that have just ignited their nuclear fires --  or have they  been 
    flooding the galaxy with light for billions of years?  The ages of  the 
    stars  are  among the most elusive stellar characteristics.  Now,   new 
    interpretation of data collected over the past half century is shedding 
    some light on this question. 
     
       Computer models of stellar evolution reveal that stars have definite 
    lifespans;   thus,   a  certain type of star cannot be older  than  its 
    maximum predicted lifespan.  Solar type stars of spectral class F5   or 
    higher  (hotter)  cannot be older than our sun is today.  These  stars' 
    nuclear fires burn too rapidly to sustain them for a longer period, and 
    they meet an early death. 
     
       All main sequence stars cooler than F5  can be as old or older  than 
    the  sun.  Additionally,  these stars are also much more likely to have 
    planets than the hotter suns. 
     
       There  are several exciting reasons why the age of a star should  be 
    tracked  down.  Suppose we have a star similar to the sun (below  class 
    F5). If we determine how old the star is, we can assume its planets are 
    the same age -- a fascinating piece of information that suggests a host 
    of questions:  Would older Earthlike planets harbor life more  advanced 
    than  us?  Is there anything about older or younger stars  and  planets 
    that would make them fundamentally different from the sun and Earth? 
     
       Of course we don't know the answer to the first question,  but it is 
    provocative.   The  answer  to  the second question  seems  to  be  yes 
    (according to the evidence that follows). 
     
       To  best illustrate the methods of star age determination and  their 
    implications,   let's  select a specific problem.  "The  Zeta  Reticuli 
    Incident" sparked more interest among our readers than any other single 
    article  in  ASTRONOMY's  history.   Essentially,   that  article  drew 
    attention  to  a  star map allegedly seen  inside  an  extraterrestrial 
    spacecraft.   The  map was later deciphered by Marjorie  Fish,   now  a 
    research assistant at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. 
     
       In  her analysis,  Ms.  Fish linked all 16  prominent stars  in  the 
    original map (which we'll call the Hill map since it was drawn by Betty 
    Hill in 1966) to 15 real stars in the southern sky.  The congruence was 
    remarkable. The 15 stars -- for convenience we will call them the Fish-
    Hill pattern stars -- are listed on the accompanying table. 
     
       Since  these stars have been a focus of attention due to Ms.  Fish's 
    work and the article mentioned above, we will examine them specifically 
    to  see  if enough information is available to pin down their ages  and 
    (possibly)   other characteristics.  This will be our case  study  star 
    group.

    All  the stars listed here are main sequence or spectral group V stars. 
    Tau  Ceti has a slight peculiarity in its spectrum as explained in  the 
    text. W-velocity is the star's motion in km/sec in a direction above or 
    below (-)  in the galactic plane.  Total space velocity relative to the 
    sun is also in km/sec.  Data is from the Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars 
    (1969 edition). 
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
       Consider, for example, the velocities of these stars in space. It is 
    now known that the composition and the age of a star shows a reasonably 
    close correlation with that star's galactic orbit. The understanding of 
    this correlation demands a little knowledge of galactic structure. 
    
       Our galaxy, as far as we are concerned,  consists essentially of two 
    parts --  the halo, and the disk. Apparently when the galaxy first took 
    shape about 10 billion years ago, it was a colossal sphere in which the 
    first  generation of stars emerged.  These stars --  those that  remain 
    today,  anyway --  define a spherical or halolike cloud around the disk 
    shaped Milky Way galaxy.  Early in the galaxy's history, it is believed 
    that the interstellar medium had a very low metal content because  most 
    of the heavy elements (astronomers call any element heavier than helium 
    "heavy"  or a "metal")  are created in the cores of massive stars which 
    then get released into the interstellar medium by stellar winds,  novae 
    and supernovae explosions. Few such massive stars had "died" to release 
    their  newly made heavy elements.  Thus,  the stars which formed  early 
    (called  Population  II stars)  tend to have a  spherical  distribution 
    about the center of the galaxy and are generally metal-poor. 
    
       A  further  gravitational collapse occurred as the galaxy  flattened 
    out into a disk,  and a new burst of star formation took place.   Since 
    this  occurred later and generations of stars had been born and died to 
    enrich  the interstellar medium with heavy elements,  these disk  stars 
    have a metal-rich composition compared to the halo stars.  Being in the 
    disk,  these Population I stars (the sun,  for example)  tended to have 
    motions around the galactic core in a limited plane --  something  like 
    the planets of the solar system. 
    
       Population II stars -- with their halo distribution --  usually have 
    more  random  orbits which cut through the Population I hoards  in  the 
    galactic plane.  A  star's space velocity perpendicular to the galactic 
    plane  is  called its W-velocity.  Knowing the significance of  the  W-
    velocity,   one  can  apply  this information to  find  out  about  the 
    population  classification and hence the ages and compositions of stars 
    in the solar neighborhood -- the Fish-Hill stars in particular. 
    
       High W-velocity suggests a Population II star,  and we find that six 
    of  the 16  stars are so classified while the remaining majority are of 
    Population I.  A  further subdivision can be made using the  W-velocity 
    data (the results are shown in the table below.

                                   82 Eridani

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       According to this classification system (based on one by A. Blaauw), 
    most of the 16  stars are in the same class as the sun --implying  that 
    they  are roughly of the same composition and age as the sun.  The  sun 
    would  seem  to  be a natural unit for use in  comparing  the  chemical 
    compositions and ages of the stars of the Fish-Hill pattern because  it 
    is,  after all,  the standard upon which we base our selection of stars 
    capable of supporting life. 
    
       Three stars (Gliese 59, 67 and 68) are known as Old Population I and 
    are  almost certainly younger than the sun.  They also probably have  a 
    higher  metal  content  than the sun,  although specific  data  is  not 
    available. The Disk Population II stars are perhaps two to four billion 
    years  older  than the sun,  while the Intermediate Population  II  are 
    believed to be a billion or two years older still. 
    
       For main sequence stars like the sun,  as all these stars are, it is 
    generally  believed  that after the star is formed and settled  on  the 
    main sequence no mixing between the outer layers and the thermo-nuclear 
    core occurs.  Thus the composition of the outer layers of a star, (from 
    which  we  receive  the star's light)  must have essentially  the  same 
    composition  as the interstellar medium out of which the star  and  its 
    planets were formed. 
    
       Terrestrial  planets are composed primarily of heavy elements.   The 
    problem  is:  If there is a shortage of heavy elements in the  primeval 
    nebula, would terrestrial planets be able to form? At present, theories 
    of  planetary  formation  are  unable to state  for  certain  what  the 
    composition  of the cloud must be in order for terrestrial  planets  to 
    materialize,   although it is agreed to be unlikely that Population  II 
    stars  should  have  terrestrial planets.  But  for  objects  somewhere 
    between Population I and II --  especially Disk Population II -- no one 
    really knows. 
    
       Although  we  can't  be  certain of determining whether  a  star  of 
    intermediate  metal deficiencies can have planets or not,  we can  make 
    certain  of  the existence of metal deficiencies in those  stars.   The 
    eccentricities and inclinations of the galactic orbits of the Fish-Hill 
    stars provide the next step in the information sequence. 
    
       The table above also shows that the stars Gliese 136,  138, 139,  86 
    and  71   have  the highest eccentricities and  inclinations  in  their 
    galactic  orbits.   This further supports the Population II  nature  of 
    these  four stars.  According to B.E.J.  Pagel of the  Royal  Greenwich 
    Observatory  in England,  the correlation between eccentricity and  the 
    metal/hydrogen ratio is better than that between the W-velocity and the 
    metal/hydrogen ratio.  It is interesting to see how closely the  values 
    of eccentricity seem to correspond with Population type as derived from 
    W-velocity -- Old Population I objects having the lowest values.  Since 
    the two methods give similar results,  we can lend added weight to  our 
    classification. 
    
       So far all the evidence for metal deficiencies has been  suggestive; 
    no  direct  evidence  has been given.  However,  specific data  can  be 
    obtained from spectroscopic analysis. The system for which the best set 
    of  data  exists also happens to be one of the most important stars  of 
    the  pattern,   Zeta 1 Reticuli.  In 1966,  J.D.  Danziger  of  Harvard 
    University  published  results of work he had done on Zeta  1  Reticuli 
    using wide-scan spectroscopy.  He did indeed find metal deficiencies in 
    the star:  carbon,  0.2, compared to our sun; magnesium, 0.4;  calcium, 
    0.5;  titanium, 0.4; chromium, 0.3; manganese, 0.4; iron, 0.4;  cobalt, 
    0.4; nickel, 0.2, and so on. 
    
       In spite of the possible error range of about 25 percent, there is a 
    consistent  trend of metal deficiencies --  with Zeta 1 Reticuli having 
    less  than  half the heavy elements per unit mass that  the  sun  does. 
    Because Zeta 1 Reticuli has common proper motion and parallax with Zeta 
    2   Reticuli,  it probably also has the same composition.  Work done by 
    M.E. Dixon of the University of Edinburgh showing the two stars to have 
    virtually identical characteristics tends to support this. 
    
       The  evidence  that the Zeta Reticuli system is metal  deficient  is 
    definite.   From this knowledge of metal deficiency and the  velocities 
    and  eccentricities,   we can safely conclude that  the  Zeta  Reticuli 
    system is older than the sun. The question of terrestrial planets being 
    able to form remains open. 
    
       The  other two stars which have high velocities  and  eccentricities 
    are 82  Eridani (Gliese 139)  and Gliese 86.  Because the velocities of 
    these  stars  are  higher than those of Zeta  Reticuli,   larger  metal 
    deficiencies  might  be  expected.   For the case  of  Gliese  86,   no 
    additional   information   is  presently  available.   However,    some 
    theoretical  work  has  been  done  on  82   Eridani  concerning  metal 
    abundances by J. Hearnshaw of France's Meudon Observatory. 
    
       Although 82  Eridani is a high velocity star, its orbit lies largely 
    within the galactic plane,  and also within the solar orbit.  Its orbit 
    is characteristic of the Old Disk Population, and an ultraviolet excess 
    indicates only a mild metal deficiency compared to the sun. Hearnshaw's 
    conclusions  indicate that the metal deficiency does not appear  to  be 
    any worse than that of the Zeta Reticuli pair. 
    
       Because  Gliese  86  has a velocity,  eccentricity  and  inclination 
    similar to 82  Eridani,  it seems likely that its chemical  composition 
    may also not have severe metal deficiencies, but be similar to those of 
    82 Eridani. 
    
       Tau  Ceti  appears to be very much like the sun  except  for  slight 
    deficiencies  of  most  metals in rarely seen  abnormal  abundances  of 
    magnesium, titanium, silicon and calcium. Stars in this class are known 
    as alpha-rich stars, but such properties do not appear to make Tau Ceti 
    unlikely to have planets similar to the sun's. 
    
       Tau  1 Eridani,  an F6V star,  has a life expectancy of 4.5  billion 
    years -- so it cannot be older than the sun. The low eccentricities and 
    low  moderate velocity support an age and composition near that of  the 
    sun. 
    
       Gliese  67   is  a young star of at least  solar  metal  abundances, 
    considering its low velocity and eccentricity. 
    
       Having  covered  most  of the stars either  directly  or  simply  by 
    classifying them among the different Population classes, it is apparent 
    that  there is a wide age range among different stars of this group  as 
    well as a range of compositions. It is curious that the stars connected 
    by  the  alleged  "trade  routes"  (solid lines)   are  the  older  and 
    occasionally metal deficient ones --while the stars connected by dotted 
    lines seem to be younger Population I objects. 
    
       A   final   point  concerning  the  metal  deficiencies  is   rather 
    disturbing.   Even  though terrestrial planets might form about  either 
    star  in  the Zeta Reticuli system,  there is a specific deficiency  in 
    carbon  to  well  within the error range.  This is  disturbing  because 
    carbon  is the building block of organic molecule chains.  There is  no 
    way  of knowing whether life on Earth would have emerged and evolved as 
    far as it has if carbon were not as common here. 
    
       Another  problem:  If planets formed but lacked large quantities  of 
    useful industrial elements,  could a technical civilization arise?   If 
    the  essential elements were scarce or locked up in chemical compounds, 
    then an advanced technology would be required to extract them.  But the 
    very  shortage of these elements in the first place might prevent  this 
    technology  from  being realized.  The dolphins are an  example  of  an 
    intelligent  but  nontechnical  race.  They do not have  the  means  to 
    develop technology.  Perhaps some land creatures on another planet  are 
    in  a  comparable  position by not having the  essential  elements  for 
    technological development.  (This theme is explored in detail in  "What 
    Chariots of Which Gods?", August 1974.) 
    
       This  whole  speculation certainly is not strong enough to rule  out 
    the  Fish  interpretation of the Hill map given our  present  state  of 
    knowledge.   Actually in some respects,  the metal deficiencies support 
    the Fish hypothesis because they support an advanced age for several of 
    the stars --  suggesting that if cultures exist in these star  systems, 
    they might well be advanced over our own. 
    
       The  fact  that none of the stars in the pattern is seriously  metal 
    deficient  (especially the vital branch high velocity stars 82  Eridani 
    and  Gliese 86)  is an encouragement to the Fish interpretation --   if 
    terrestrial  planets  can  form in the first place  and  give  rise  to 
    technical  civilizations.  Once again we are confronted  with  evidence 
    which  seems to raise as many questions as it answers.  But the  search 
    for  answers to such questions certainly can only advance knowledge  of 
    our cosmic environment.

    COMMENTARY 
     
      Editor's Preface 
     
    
       The lead article in the December 1974  issue of ASTRONOMY,  entitled 
    "The  Zeta  Reticuli  Incident",  centered on interpretation of  a  map 
    allegedly seen inside an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The intent of the 
    article was to expose to our readers a rare instance where astronomical 
    techniques  have  been  used to analyze a key element  in  a  so-called 
    "close encounter" UFO incident. While not claiming that the analysis of 
    the  map  was  proof  of a visit by  extraterrestrials,   we  feel  the 
    astronomical aspects of the case are sufficiently intriguing to warrant 
    wide dissemination and further study. 
    
       The  following  notes  contain  detailed  follow-up  commentary  and 
    information directly related to that article.

    PATTERN RECOGNITION & ZETA RETICULI 
     
    By Carl Sagan & Steven Soter 
     
    
       "The Zeta Reticuli Incident"  is very provocative.  It claims that a 
    map,   allegedly shown on board a landed extraterrestrial spacecraft to 
    Betty  Hill  in 1961,  later drawn by her from memory and published  in 
    1966,  corresponds well to similar maps of the closest stars resembling 
    the sun based on stellar positions in the 1969 Gliese Catalog of Nearby 
    Stars.   The  comparison maps were made by Marjorie Fish using a  three 
    dimensional  physical  model  and  later  by  a  group  of  Ohio  State 
    University  students  using  a presumably more  accurate  (i.e.,   less 
    subjective)   computer generated projection.  The argument rests on how 
    well  the  maps  agree  and on  the  statistical  significance  of  the 
    comparison. 
    
       Figure  1 [not available here] show the Hill map and the Ohio  State 
    computer  map with connecting lines as given in the ASTRONOMY  article. 
    The  inclusion  of these lines (said to represent trade  or  navigation 
    routes)   to establish a resemblance between the maps is what a  lawyer 
    would  call  "leading the witness".  We could just as well  have  drawn 
    lines as in the bottom of Figure 1 to lead the other way. A less biased 
    comparison of the two data sets,  without connecting lines as in Figure 
    2,   shows little similarity.  Any residual resemblance is enhanced  by 
    there being the same number of points in each map, and can be accounted 
    for by the manner in which these points were selected. 
    
       The computer star map includes the sun and 14  stars selected from a 
    list  of  the 46  nearest stars similar to the sun,  derived  from  the 
    Gliese  catalog.   It is not clear what criteria were  used  to  select 
    precisely these 14 stars from the list, other than the desire to find a 
    resemblance  to the Hill map.  However,  we can always pick and  choose 
    from a large random data set some subset that resembles a  preconceived 
    pattern.   If  we are free also to select the vantage point  (from  all 
    possible  directions for viewing the projection of a three  dimensional 
    pattern), it is a simple matter to optimize the desired resemblance. Of 
    course such a resemblance in the case of selection from a random set is 
    a  contrivance --  an example of the statistical fallacy known as  "the 
    enumeration of favorable circumstances". 
    
       The presence of such a fallacy in this case appears even more likely 
    when we examine the original Hill drawing, published in The Interrupted 
    Journey by John Fuller.  In addition to the prominent points that Betty 
    Hill connected by lines,  her map also includes a number of  apparently 
    random  dots  scattered about --evidently to represent the presence  of 
    background  stars but not meant to suggest actual positions.   However, 
    three  of these dots appear in the version of the Hill map used in  the 
    comparison,  while the others are absent.  Thus some selection was made 
    even  from the original Hill map,  although not to the same  extent  as 
    from the Gliese catalog.  This allow even greater freedom to contrive a 
    resemblance. 
    
       Finally,  we lear from The Interrupted Journey that Betty Hill first 
    thought she saw a remarkable similarity between her UFO star map and  a 
    map  of  the constellation Pegasus published in the New York  Times  in 
    1965   to show the position of the quasar CTA-102.  How many star maps, 
    derived  from the Gliese catalog or elsewhere,  have been compared with 
    Betty  Hill's  before a supposed agreement was found?  If  we  suppress 
    information  on such comparisons we also overestimate the  significance 
    of the result. 
    
       The argument on "The Zeta Reticuli Incident"  demonstrates only that 
    if  we set out to find a pattern correlation between two nearly  random 
    data sets by selecting at will certain elements from each and  ignoring 
    others, we will always be successful. The argument cannot serve even to 
    suggest  a verification of the Hill story --  which in any case is well 
    known  to  be riddled with internal and external  contradictions,   and 
    which   is   amenable   to   interpretations  which   do   not   invoke 
    extraterrestrial   intelligence.   Those  of  us  concerned  with   the 
    possibility  of extraterrestrial intelligence must take care to  demand 
    adequately rigorous standards of evidence.  It is all too easy,  as the 
    old  Chinese  proverb says,  for the imprisoned maiden to  mistake  the 
    beating of her own heart for the hoof beats of her rescuer's horse.

    REPLY: By Terence Dickinson 
     
    
       The  question  raised by Steven Soter and Carl Sagan concerning  the 
    pattern  resemblance  of  the  Hill  map  and  the  computer  generated 
    projection of the Fish pattern stars is certainly a key question worthy 
    of  discussion.  Next month two authors will make specific comments  on 
    this point. 
    
       Briefly,  there is more to discounting the Fish interpretation  than 
    pattern resemblance.  We would have discounted the Fish  interpretation 
    immediately  on  pattern  resemblance alone.  The  fact  that  all  the 
    connecting lines join stars in a logical distance progression, and that 
    all the stars are solar type stars,  is significant. Ms.  Fish tried to 
    fit  hundreds  of other viewpoints and this one was the only  one  that 
    even  marginally  fit and made sense in three dimensions and  contained 
    solar  type stars.  in this context,  you could not "have just as  well 
    drawn the lines...to lead the other way". 
    
       Naturally  there was a desire to find a resemblance between a  group 
    of  nearby stars and the Hill pattern!  That's why Marjorie Fish  built 
    six  models of the solar neighborhood containing the relative positions 
    of  up to 256  nearby stars.  The fact that she came up with a  pattern 
    that  fits as well as it does is a tribute to her perseverance and  the 
    accuracy  of the models.  Stars cannot be moved around "to optimize the 
    desired  resemblance".   Indeed Marjorie Fish first tried models  using 
    nearby  stars  of  other than strictly solar type  as  defined  in  the 
    article. She found no resemblances. 
    
       The  three  triangle dots selected from the background dots  in  the 
    Hill map were selected because Mrs.  Hill said they were more prominent 
    than  the other background stars.  Such testimony was the basis of  the 
    original map so we either accept Mrs.  Hill's observations and  attempt 
    to  analyze  them  or  reject the whole incident.   We  feel  there  is 
    sufficient  evidence compelling us not to reject the whole incident  at 
    this time. 
    
       We too are demanding rigorous standards of evidence to establish the 
    reality  of  extraterrestrial  intelligence.   If  there  is  even  the 
    slightest possibility that the Hills' encounter can provide information 
    about  such life,  we feel it is worth pursuing.  The map is worthy  of 
    examination by as many critical minds as possible.

    REPLY: By David R. Saunders 
      
       Last month, Steven Soter and Carl Sagan offered two counterarguments 
    relating  to Terence Dickinson's article,  "The Zeta Reticuli Incident" 
    (ASTRONOMY, December 1974). 
    
       Their first argument was to observe that the inclusion of connecting 
    lines  in  certain  maps  "is what a lawyer  would  call  'leading  the 
    witness'."  This was used as the minor premise in a syllogism for which 
    the major premise was never stated. Whether we should consider "leading 
    the witness" a sin or not will depend on how we conceive the purpose of 
    the  original article.  The implied analogy between ASTRONOMY  magazine 
    and  a court of law is tenuous at best;  an expository article  written 
    for a nonprofessional audience is entitled, in my opinion, to do all it 
    can to facilitate communication -- assuming that the underlying message 
    is honest.  Much of what we call formal education is really little more 
    than  "leading  the witness",  and no one who accepts  the  educational 
    goals  objects very strongly to this process.  In this context,  we may 
    also  observe that Soter's and Sagan's first argument provides  another 
    illustrative  example  of "leading the witness";  the argument  attacks 
    procedure,   not  substance --  and serves only to blunt  the  reader's 
    possible  criticism of the forthcoming second argument.  This paragraph 
    may  also be construed as an effort to lead the witness.  Once we  have 
    been  sensitized to the possibilities,  none of us needs to be  further 
    misled! 
    
       The second  argument  offered  by  Soter  and  Sagan  does  attack a 
    substance.   Indeed,   the editorial decision to publish  the  original 
    article  was  a responsible decision only if the issues raised by  this 
    second  line  of possible argument were fully considered.   Whenever  a 
    statistical  inference  is made from selected data,  it is  crucial  to 
    determine the strenuousness of that selection and then to appropriately 
    discount the apparent clarity of the inference. By raising the issue of 
    the possible effects of selection, Soter and Sagan are right on target. 
    However,   by failing to treat the matter with quantitative objectivity 
    (by  failing to weigh the evidence in each direction  numerically,  for 
    example), they might easily perform a net disservice. 
    
       In  some  situations,  the weight of the appropriate  discount  will 
    suffice  to cancel the clarity of a proposed inference --  and we  will 
    properly dismiss the proposal as a mere capitalization on chance,  or a 
    lucky outcome.  (It is abundantly clear that Soter and Sagan regard the 
    star  map  results as just such a fortuitous outcome.)  In  some  other 
    situations, the weight of the appropriate discount may be fully applied 
    without  accounting  for the clarity of the inference as a  potentially 
    valid  discovery.   For  example,  if I proposed  to  infer  from  four 
    consecutive  coin  tosses observed as heads that the coin would  always 
    yield heads, you would properly dismiss this proposal as unwarranted by 
    the data. However, if I proposed exactly the same inference based on 40 
    similar consecutive observations of heads,  you would almost  certainly 
    accept  the  inference and begin looking with me for a more  systematic 
    explanation  of  the data.  The crucial difference here is  the  purely 
    quantitative  distinction  between 4 and 40;  the  two  situations  are 
    otherwise   identical  and  cannot  be  distinguished  by  any   purely 
    qualitative argument. 
    
       When  Soter  and  Sagan  use  phrases  such  as  "some  subset  that 
    resembles",  "free also to select the vantage point", "simple matter to 
    optimize",  and "freedom to contrive a resemblance",  they are speaking 
    qualitatively   about  matters  that  should  (and  can)   be   treated 
    quantitatively. Being based only on this level of argument, Soter's and 
    Sagan's conclusions can only be regarded as inconclusive. 
    
       A complete quantitative examination of this problem will require the 
    numerical estimation of at least three factors, and their expression in 
    a  uniform  metric  so that wee can see which way  the  weight  of  the 
    evidence is leaning.  The most convenient common metric will be that of 
    "bits  of  information",  which is equivalent to  counting  consecutive 
    heads in the previous example. 
     One key factor is the degree of resemblance between the Hill
    map and the optimally similar computer-drawn map. Precisely how
    many consecutive heads is this resemblance equivalent to? A
    second key factor is the precise size of the population of stars
    from which the computer was allowed to make its selection. And a
    third key factor is the precise dimensionality of the space in
    which the computer was free to choose the best vantage point. If
    the first factor exceeds the sum of the other two by a sufficient
    margin, we are justified in insisting on a systematic explanation
    for the data. 
    
       The third factor is the easiest to deal with.  The dimensionality of 
    the  vantage-point  space is not more than three.  A  property  of  the 
    metric system for weighing evidence is that each independent  dimension 
    of  freedom  leads us to expect the equivalent of one more  consecutive 
    head  in  the  observed data.  Three dimensions of  freedom  are  worth 
    exactly  3.0   bits.   In the end,  even three bits  will  be  seen  as 
    relatively minor. 
    
       The  second  factor  might be much larger than  this,   and  deserve 
    relatively more discussion. The appropriate discount for this selection 
    will be log2C,  where C is the number of distinct combinations of stars 
    "available" to the computer.  If we were to agree that C must represent 
    the possible combinations of 46  stars taken 14  at a time,  then log2C 
    would  be 37.8  bits;  this would be far more than enough to  kill  the 
    proposed  inference.  However,  not all these combinations are  equally 
    plausible.   We  really  should consider  only  combinations  that  are 
    adjacent  to one another and to the sun,  but it is awkward to  try  to 
    specify exactly which combinations these are. 
    
       The  really exciting moment in working with these data came with the 
    realization  that  in the real universe,  our sun belongs to  a  closed 
    cluster  together with just six of the other admissible stars  --   Tau 
    Ceti,  82  Eridani, Zeta Tucanae,  Alpha Mensae,  and Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 
    Reticuli. The real configuration of interstellar distances is such that 
    an  explorer  starting from any of the seven should visit all  of  them 
    before  venturing  outside.  If the Hill map is assumed to include  the 
    sun, then it should include the other members of this cluster within an 
    unbroken  network of connections,  and the other connected stars should 
    be relatively adjacent in the real universe. 
    
       Zeta  Reticuli occupies a central position in all of the  relatively 
    few combinations that now remain plausible. However, in my opinion, the 
    adjacency  criteria  do  leave some remnant  ambiguity  concerning  the 
    combination  of real stars to be matched against the Hill map  --   but 
    only with respect to the region farthest from the sun. The stars in the 
    closed  cluster  and those in the chain leading to Gliese 67   must  be 
    included,   as  well  as Gliese 86  and two others from a set  of  five 
    candidates. Log2C for this remnant selection is 3.9 bits.  we must also 
    notice  that  the  constraint  that Zeta Tucanae be  occulted  by  Zeta 
    Reticuli reduces the dimensionality of the vantage-point space from 3.0 
    to 1.0. Thus, the sum of factors two and three is now estimated as only 
    4.9 bits. 
    
       The first factor is also awkward to evaluate -- simply because there 
    is no standard statistical technique for comparing points on two  maps. 
    Using  an approximation based on rank-order correlation,  I've  guessed 
    that the number we seek here is between 11 and 16.  (This is the result 
    cited by Dickinson on page 15  of the original article.)  Deducting the 
    second  and  third  factors,  this rough analysis  leaves  us  with  an 
    empirical  result whose net meaning is equivalent to observing at least 
    6  to 11 consecutive heads. (I say "at least",  because there are other 
    factors  contributing to the total picture --  not discussed either  by 
    Dickinson  or  by Soter and Sagan --  that could be adduced to  enhance 
    this  figure.   For  example,  the computed vantage point  is  in  good 
    agreement  with Betty Hill's reported position when observing the  map, 
    and  the coordinate system implicit in the boundaries of the map is  in 
    good agreement with a natural galactic coordinate system.  Neither have 
    we  discussed any quantitative use of the connections drawn on the Hill 
    map, which were put there in advance of any of these analyses.) 
    
       In  the  final interpretation,  it will always be possible to  argue 
    that  5 or 10  or even 15  bits of remarkable information simply  isn't 
    enough.   However,   this  is  a  matter  for  each  of  us  to  decide 
    independently. In deciding this matter, it is more important that we be 
    consistent  with  ourselves (as we review a large number  of  uncertain 
    interpretations of data that we have made) than that we be in agreement 
    with some external authority. I do believe, though, that relatively few 
    individuals  will  continue a coin-tossing match in which  their  total 
    experience is equivalent to even six consecutive losses.  In scientific 
    matters,  my own standard is that I'm interested in any result that has 
    five or more bits of information supporting it --  though I prefer  not 
    to stick my neck out publicly on the basis of less than 10. Adhering to 
    this  standard,  I  continue to find the star map  results  exceedingly 
    interesting.

    REPLY: By Michael Peck 
     
       Carl  Sagan  and  Steven Soter,  in  challenging  the  possibilities 
    discussed  in  "The Zeta Reticuli Incident",  suggest that without  the 
    connecting  lines drawn into the Hill map and the  Fish  interpretation 
    there  is  little resemblance between the two.  This statement  can  be 
    tested using only X and Y coordinates of the points in the Hill map and 
    a projection of the stars in the Fish pattern.  The method used for the 
    comparison can be visualized this way: 
    
       Suppose  points  of  the Hill map and the Fish map  are  plotted  on 
    separate glass plates.  These plates are held parallel (one behind  the 
    other),   and are moved back and forth and rotated until  the  patterns 
    appear  as nearly as possible to match.  A  systematic way of comparing 
    the patterns would be to adjust the plates until corresponding pairs of 
    points  match  exactly.  Then the other points in the patterns  can  be 
    compared.   Repeating this process for all the possible pairs of points 
    (there   are  105   in  this  case),   the  best  fit  can  be   found. 
    Mathematically, this involves a change of scale and a simple coordinate 
    transformation.   A  computer program was written which,  using X and Y 
    coordinates  measured from a copy of the Hill map and a  projection  of 
    the Fish stars,  and using the Hill map as the standard, computed new X 
    and Y coordinates  for the Fish stars using the process described. From 
    these  two  sets of coordinates,  six quantities were calculated:   the 
    average  difference  in  X  and  Y;   the  standard  deviation  of  the 
    differences  in X and Y,  a  measure of the amount of variation of  the 
    differences;  and correlation coefficients in X and Y.  The coefficient 
    of  correlation is a quantity used by statisticians to test a suspected 
    relation  between  two sets of data.  In this case,  for instance,   we 
    suspect that the X and Y coordinates computed from the Fish map  should 
    equal the X and Y coordinates of the Hill map. If they matched exactly, 
    the correlation coefficients would be one. If there were no correlation 
    at  all,   the value would be near zero.  We found that,  for the  best 
    fitting  orientation  of  the  Fish stars,   there  was  a  correlation 
    coefficient in X of 0.95  and in Y of 0.91.  In addition,  the  average 
    difference  and  the  standard deviation of the differences  were  both 
    small --  about 1/10 the total range in X and Y.  As a comparison,  the 
    same  program  was  run for a set of  random  points,   with  resulting 
    correlation  coefficients  of 1/10  or less (as was expected).  We  can 
    conclude,   therefore,  that the degree of resemblance between the  two 
    maps is fairly high. 
    
       From  another  point  of  view,   it  is  possible  to  compute  the 
    probability that a random set of points will coincide with the Hill map 
    to the degree of accuracy observed here. The probability that 15 points 
    chosen  at  random  will fall on the points of the Hill map  within  an 
    error range which would make them as close as the Fish map is about one 
    chance in 10  to the fifteenth power (one million billion). It is 1,000 
    times  more  probable that a person could predict a bridge  hand  dealt 
    from a fair deck.

    REBUTTAL: To David Saunders and Michael Peck 
     By Carl Sagan and Steven Soter 
     
       Dr.   David  Saunders last month claimed to  have  demonstrated  the 
    statistical significance of the Hill map,  which was allegedly found on 
    board  a  landed  UFO and supposedly depicted the sun  and  14   nearby 
    sunlike  stars.  The Hill map was said to resemble the Fish map --  the 
    latter  being  an  optimal  two-dimensional  projection  of  a   three-
    dimensional model prepared by selecting 14 stars from a positional list 
    of  the  46  nearest known sunlike stars.  Saunders'  argument  can  be 
    expressed by the equation SS = Dr -(SF + VP),  in which all  quantities 
    are  in  information bits.  SS is the statistical significance  of  the 
    correlation  between  the  two maps,  DR is the degree  of  resemblance 
    between them, SF is a selection factor depending on the number of stars 
    chosen  and  the size of the list,  and VP is the  information  content 
    provided by a free choice in three dimensions of the vantage point  for 
    projecting the map. Saunders finds SS = 6 to 11 bits,  meaning that the 
    correlation  is equivalent to between 6 and 11  consecutive heads in  a 
    coin  toss  and  therefore probably not accidental.  The  procedure  is 
    acceptable  in  principle,  but the result depends entirely on how  the 
    quantities on the right-hand side of the equation were chosen. 
    
       For the degree of resemblance between the two maps,  Saunders claims 
    that DR = 11 to 16 bits, which he admits is only a guess -- but we will 
    let it stand.  For the selection factor, he at first takes SF = log2C = 
    37.8 bits, where C represents the combinations of 46 things taken 14 at 
    a time.  Realizing that the size of this factor alone will cause SS  to 
    be  negative  and wipe out his argument,  he makes a number of  ad  hoc 
    adjustments  based  essentially on his interpretation of  the  internal 
    logic of the Hill map,  and SF somehow gets reduced to only 3.9   bits. 
    For the present, we will let even that stand in order to avoid becoming 
    embroiled  in  a  discussion  of how an explorer  from  the  star  Zeta 
    Reticuli  would  choose  to arrange his/her/its  travel  itinerary  --a 
    matter  about which we can claim no particular knowledge.  However,  we 
    must  bear  in mind that a truly unprejudiced examination of  the  data 
    with no a priori interpretations would give SF = 37.8 bits. 
    
       It is Saunders'  choice of the vantage point factor VP with which we 
    must take strongest issue,  for this is a matter of geometry and simple 
    pattern  recognition.  Saunders assumes that free choice of the vantage 
    point  for viewing a three-dimensional model of 15  stars is worth only 
    VP = 3 bits.  He then reduces the information content of directionality 
    to one bit by introducing the "constraint"  that the star Zeta  Tucanae 
    be  occulted by Zeta Reticuli (with no special notation on the Hill map 
    to mark this peculiarity). This ad hoc device is invoked to explain the 
    absence of Zeta Tucanae from the Hill map,  but it reveals the circular 
    reasoning involved.  After all, why bother to calculate the statistical 
    significance of the supposed map correlation if one has already decided 
    which points represent which stars? 
    
       Certainly  the  selection of vantage point is worth more than  three 
    bits  (not  to mention one bit).  Probably the easiest circumstance  to 
    recognize  and  remember  about  random projections  of  the  model  in 
    question  are  the cases in which two stars appear  to  be  immediately 
    adjacent.  By viewing the model from all possible directions, there are 
    14   distinct ways in which any given star can be seen in projection as 
    adjacent to some other star. This can be done for each of the 15 stars, 
    giving  210   projected  configurations  --  each  of  which  would  be 
    recognized  as  substantially different from the others in  information 
    content.  And of course there are many additional distinct recognizable 
    projections  of  the 15  stars not involving any two being  immediately 
    adjacent.  (For example,  three stars nearly equidistant in a  straight 
    line  are  easily  recognized,  as in Orion's belt.)  Thus for  a  very 
    conservative lower bound,  the information content determined by choice 
    of vantage point (that is,  by being allowed to rotate the model  about 
    three  axes)  can be taken as at least equal to VP = log2(210)  =   7.7 
    bits. Using the rest of Saunders' analysis, this would at best yield SS 
    = zero to 4.4 bits -- not a very impressive correlation. 
    
       There is another way to understand the large number of bits involved 
    in the choice of the vantage point. The stars in question are separated 
    by  distances of order 10  parsecs.  If the vantage point  is  situated 
    above  or  not too far from the 15  stars,  it need only be shifted  by 
    about  0.17   parsecs  to  cause a change of one degree  in  the  angle 
    subtended  by  some  pair of stars.  Now one degree is  a  very  modest 
    resolution, corresponding to twice the full moon and is easily detected 
    by anyone.  For three degrees of freedom,  the number of vantage points 
    corresponding  to  this resolution is of order (10/0.17)  cubed ~  (60) 
    cubed  ~ 2 X 10  to the fifth power,  corresponding to VP = 17.6  bits. 
    This  factor alone is sufficient to make SS negative,  and to wipe  out 
    any validity to the supposed correlation. 
    
       Even  if we were to accept Saunders'  claim that SS = 6 to 11   bits 
    (which  we obviously do not,  particularly in view of the proper  value 
    for  SF),   it  is not at all clear that this  would  be  statistically 
    significant   because  we  are  not  told  how  many   other   possible 
    correlations were tried and failed before the Fish map was devised. For 
    comparison,   there is the well-known correlation between the incidence 
    of  Andean  earthquakes  and oppositions of the planet Uranus.   It  is 
    unlikely  in  the  extreme that there is a  physical  causal  mechanism 
    operating here -- among other reasons,  because there is no correlation 
    with oppositions of Jupiter,  Saturn or Neptune. But to have found such 
    a  correlation  the  investigator must have sought a  wide  variety  of 
    correlations  of  seismic  events  in many  parts  of  the  world  with 
    oppositions  and conjunctions of many astronomical objects.  If  enough 
    correlations are sought,  statistics requires that eventually one  will 
    be  found,  valid to any level of significance that we wish.  Before we 
    can   determine  whether  a  claimed  correlation  implies   a   causal 
    connection,  we must convince ourselves that the number of correlations 
    sought  has  not  been  so large as to  make  the  claimed  correlation 
    meaningless. 
    
       This  point  can  be further illustrated by  Saunders'   example  of 
    flipping  coins.   Suppose we flip a coin once per second  for  several 
    hours. Now let us consider three cases: two heads in a row, 10 heads in 
    a row,  and 40  heads in a row.  We would,  of course,  think there  is 
    nothing  extraordinary  about the first case.  Only  four  attempts  at 
    flipping  two coins are required to have a reasonable expectation value 
    of  two heads in a row.  Ten heads in a row,  however,  will occur only 
    once in every 2 to the tenth power = 1,024  trials,  and 40  heads in a 
    row  will occur only once every 2 to the fortieth ~ 10  to the  twelfth 
    power trials. At a flip rate of one coin per second, a toss of 10 coins 
    requires 10 seconds; 1,024 trials of 10  coins each requires just under 
    three hours.  But 40 heads in a row at the same rate requires 4 X 10 to 
    the thirteenth power seconds or a little over a million years. A run of 
    40  consecutive heads in a few hours of coin tossing would certainly be 
    strong  prima facie evidence of the ability to control the fall of  the 
    coin.   Ten  heads in a row under the circumstances we  have  described 
    would provide no convincing evidence at all.  It is expected by the law 
    of probability. The Hill map correlation is at best claimed by Saunders 
    to be in the category of 10 heads in a row, but with no clear statement 
    as to the number of unsuccessful trials previously attempted. 
    
       Michael Peck finds a high degree of correlation between the Hill map 
    and  the  Fish map,  and thereby also misses the central point  of  our 
    original  criticism:   that  the stars in the  Fish  map  were  already 
    preselected in order to maximize that very correlation.  Peck finds one 
    chance  in  10   to the fifteenth power that  15   random  points  will 
    correlate with the Fish map as well as the Hill map does.  However, had 
    he selected 15 out of a random sample of, say, 46 points in space,  and 
    had  he  simultaneously  selected the optimal vantage  point  in  three 
    dimensions in order to maximize the resemblance, he could have achieved 
    an apparent correlation comparable to that which he claims between  the 
    Hill  and Fish maps.  Indeed,  the statistical fallacy involved in "the 
    enumeration of favorable circumstances" leads necessarily to large, but 
    spurious correlations. 
    
       We  again  conclude that the Zeta Reticuli argument and  the  entire 
    Hill story do not survive critical scrutiny.

    IS THE FISH INTERPRETATION UNIQUE? 
     
    By Robert Sheaffer 
     
       The  story  of  Marjorie  Fish's attempts at  identifying  the  star 
    patterns  sketched  by  Betty  Hill was  told  in  "The  Zeta  Reticuli 
    Incident" by Terence Dickinson in the December 1974 issue. This pattern 
    of solar type stars unquestionably bears a striking resemblance to  the 
    map  that Betty Hill says she saw while she was being examined aboard a 
    flying saucer.  But how significant is this resemblance?  Is there only 
    one pattern of stars which will match the sketch convincingly? 
    
       Betty  Hill  herself discovered an impressive resemblance in a  star 
    map published in the New York Times. In 1965 a  map of the stars of the 
    constellation  Pegasus  appeared in that newspaper,   accompanying  the 
    announcement  by a Russian radio astronomer (Comrade Sholomitsky)   the 
    radio  source  CTA-102,   depicted  in the map,   may  be  sending  out 
    intelligent  radio signals.  Intrigued by this remarkable claim,  Betty 
    Hill  studied  the map,  and added the corresponding star names to  her 
    sketch.  As you can see, the Pegasus map --  while not exactly like the 
    sketch --  is impressively similar.  If CTA-102  --  appearing near the 
    "globes"  in her sketch --  was in reality an artificial radio  source, 
    that would give the Pegasus map much additional credibility. 
    
       However,  the case for the artificial origin of quasar CTA-102  soon 
    fell  flat.   Other  scientists were unable to observe  these  reported 
    strange variations which had caused Sholomitsky to suggest that CTA-102 
    might be pulsing intelligently. 
    
       In 1966,  when Marjorie Fish was just beginning her work, Charles W. 
    Atterberg (employed by an aeronautical communications firm in Illinois) 
    also set out to attempt to identify this star pattern. 
    
       "I  began  my  search  by perusing a star  atlas  I  had  on  hand," 
    Atterberg  explained.  "I soon realized that this was a  pointless  and 
    futile project."  Any star pattern useful for interstellar  navigation, 
    he   reasoned,   would  not  be  Earth-centered  as  are  the  familiar 
    constellation figures. Thus Atterberg began to look in three dimensions 
    for a pattern of stars that would approximate the Hill sketch. 
    
       Working from a list of the nearest stars,  Atterberg "began plotting 
    these stars as they would be seen from various directions.  I  did this 
    by  drawing the celestial position of a star,  I  would draw a straight 
    line penetrating the sphere at a known position, and measure out to the 
    distance  of the star...It at first took me hours to plot this out from 
    any one particular direction." 
    
       When  plotting  the stars as seen from a position  indefinitely  far 
    away  on the celestial equator at 17  hours right ascension,  Atterberg 
    found  a  pattern of stars conspicuously similar to  the  Hill  sketch. 
    After much work he refined this position to 17  hours 30  minutes right 
    ascension,  -10  degrees declination.  The resulting map resembles  the 
    Hill sketch even more strongly than does the Fish map,  and it contains 
    a greater number of stars.  Furthermore,  all of the stars depicted  in 
    the Atterberg map lie within 18.2  light-years of the sun. The Fish map 
    reaches out 53 light-years, where our knowledge of stellar distances is 
    much less certain. 
    
       Carl  Sagan  states  in  Intelligent  Life  in  the  Universe  that, 
    excluding multiple star systems,  "the three nearest stars of potential 
    biological  interest are Epsilon Eridani,  Epsilon Indi and Tau  Ceti." 
    These three stars from the heart of the Atterberg map, defining the two 
    spheres in the very center of the heavy lines that supposedly represent 
    the  major "trade routes"  of the "UFOnauts".  Epsilon Eridani and  Tau 
    Ceti  were the two stars listened to by Project Ozma,   the  pioneering 
    radio search for intelligent civilization in space. 
    
       Other  heavy lines connect the spheres with the sun,  which we  know 
    has  at  least  one  habitable  planet.   Thinner  lines,    supposedly 
    representing places visited less frequently,  connect with  Groombridge 
    1618, Groombridge 34, 61 Cygni and Sigma Draconis, which are designated 
    as stars "that could have habitable planets" in Stephen H.  Dole's Rand 
    Corporation  study,  Habitable Planets for Man.  Of the 11  stars  (not 
    counting the sun) that have allegedly been visited by the aliens, seven 
    of them appear  on Dole's list.  Three of the four  stars which are not 
    included are stopping points on the trip to Sigma Draconis,  which Dole 
    considered  to  have  even  better prospects than  Epsilon  Eridani  or 
    Epsilon Indi for harboring a habitable planet. 
    
       Another remarkable aspect of the Atterberg map is the fact that  its 
    orientation, unlike the Fish map, is not purely arbitrary. Gould's belt 
    --   a   concentration  of  the sky's brightest stars  --   is  exactly 
    perpendicular  to the plane of the Atterberg map.  Furthermore,  it  is 
    vertical in orientation; it does not cut obliquely across the map,  but 
    runs exactly up and down. A third curious coincidence: The southpole of 
    the Atterberg  map points toward the brightest part of Gould's belt, in 
    the  constellation  Carina.  The bright stars comprising  Gould's  belt 
    might   well  serve  as  a  useful  reference  frame  for  interstellar 
    travelers,    and  it  is  quite  plausible  that  they  might  base  a 
    navigational coordinate system upon it. 
    
       No  other map interpreting the Hill sketch offers any rationale  for 
    its choice of perspectives.  The problem with trying to interpret Betty 
    Hill's sketch is that it simply fits too many star patterns. Three such 
    patterns   have  been  documented  to  date.   How  many   more   exist 
    undiscovered?

    REPLY: By Marjorie Fish 
     
       Basically,   Robert  Sheaffer's  contention is that at  least  three 
    patterns  can  be  found  that are similar to Betty  Hill's  map,   and 
    therefore, more such interpretations are likely. If one stipulates that 
    any  stars from any vantage point can be used,  then I agree that  many 
    patterns  can  be  found similar to the map.   However,   if  one  uses 
    restrictions  on the type of stars,  according to their probability  of 
    having planets and also on the logic of the apparent travel paths, then 
    it  is  much more difficult.  The three maps were:  (1)   Betty  Hill's 
    interpretation  of  the constellation Pegasus as being similar  to  her 
    map, (2) Charles Atterberg's work, and (3) my work. 
    
       When  I  started  the  search,  I  made  a  number  of  restrictions 
    including: 
    
    1)  The  sun had to be part of the pattern with a line connected to it, 
        since the leader of the aliens indicated this to Betty. 
    
    2)  Since they came to our solar system, they should also be interested 
        in  solar type stars (single main sequence  G,   probablyalso  late 
        single  main  sequence F and early single main sequence K).   These 
        stars should not be bypassed if they are in the same general volume 
        of space. 
    
    3)  Since there are a number of the above stars relatively near the sun 
        and the pattern shows only 12  stars,  the pattern would have to be 
        relatively  close  to us (or else they would be  bypassing  sunlike 
        stars, which is illogical). 
    
    4)  The travel pattern itself should be logical.  That is,  they  would 
        not  zip out 300  light-years,  back to 10  light-years,  then  out 
        1,000, etc. The moves should make a logical progression. 
    
    5)  Large  young  main sequence stars (O,  B,  A,  early F)  which  are 
        unlikely  to  have  planets and/or life would not be likely  to  be 
        visited. 
    
    6)  Stars  off the main sequence with the possible exception  of  those 
        just  starting off the main sequence would probably be  avoided  as 
        they are unsuitable for life and,  due to their variability,  could 
        be dangerous. 
    
    7)  If  they go to one star of a given type,  it shows interest in that 
        type star --  so they should go to other stars of that type if they 
        are in the same volume of space.  An exception to this might be the 
        closest stars to the base star, which they might investigate out of 
        curiosity in the early stages of stellar travel.  For example, they 
        would not be likely to bypass five red dwarfs to stop at the sixth, 
        if all six were approximately equal in size, spectra, singleness or 
        multiplicity, etc. Or, if they go to one close G double, they would 
        probably go to other close G doubles. 
    
    8)  The base star or stars is one or both of the large circles with the 
        lines radiating from it. 
    
    9)  One or both of the base stars should be suitable for life --  F8 to 
        K5  using the lowest limits given by exobiologists, or more likely, 
        K1 given by Dole. 
    
l---L---l1----+-T--2----T----3--l-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----T----7--T-J-r-r
    10) Because the base stars are represented as such large circles,  they 
        are either intrinsically bigger  or brighter than the rest  or they 
        are  closer  to the map's surface (the viewer)  than  the  rest  -- 
        probably the latter.  This was later confirmed by Betty Hill.  Mrs. 
        Hill's interpretation of Pegasus disregards all of these criteria. 

       Atterberg's  work  is well done.  His positioning of  the  stars  is 
    accurate.  He complies with criteria 1,  2, 3, 5, 6 and 8;  fairly well 
    with 4;  less well with 9, and breaks down on 7 and 10. I  will discuss 
    the last three of Atterberg's differences with my basic criteria in the 
    following paragraphs: 
     
       Relative  to  point 9,  his base stars are Epsilon Indi and  Epsilon 
    Eridani,   both  of  which are near the lower limit  for  life  bearing 
    planets  --   according  to most exobiologists --  and  not  nearly  as 
    suitable as Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli. 
    
       Concerning  point 7,  I  had ruled out the red dwarfs  fairly  early 
    because there were so many of them and there were only 12  lined points 
    on  the Hill map.  If one used red dwarfs in logical consecutive order, 
    all  the lines were used up before the sun was reached.  Atterberg used 
    red dwarfs for some of his points to make the map resemble Betty Hill's 
    but he bypassed equally good similar red dwarfs to reach them.  If they 
    were  interested in red dwarfs,  there should have been lines going  to 
    Gliese  65  (Luyten 76208)  which lies near Tau Ceti and about the same 
    distance from Epsilon Eridani as Tau Ceti, and Gliese 866  (Luyten 789-
    6) which is closer to Tau Ceti than the sun. Gliese 1 (CD-37 15492) and 
    Gliese 887  (CD-36  15693) are relatively close to Epsilon Indi.  These 
    should have been explored first before red dwarfs farther away. 
    
       Red dwarfs Gliese 406  (Wolf 359) and Gliese 411 (BD + 36 2147) were 
    by  passed  to  reach Groombridge 1618  and Ross  128   from  the  sun. 
    Barnard's  star would be the most logical first stop out from the  sun, 
    if one were to stop at red dwarfs, as it is the closest single M and is 
    known to have planets. 
    
       Since Atterberg's pattern stars include a number of relatively close 
    doubles (61  Cygni, Struve 2398, Groombridge 34  and Kruger 60),  there 
    should also be a line to Alpha Centauri --but there is not. 
    
       Relating to point 10,  Atterberg's base stars are not the largest or 
    brightest of his pattern stars.  The sun, Tau Ceti,  and Sigma Draconis 
    are brighter.  Nor are they closer to the viewer. The sun and 61  Cygni 
    are  much  closer  to  the viewer  than  Epsilon  Eridani.   The  whole 
    orientation feels wrong because the base stars are away from the viewer 
    and movement is along the lines toward the viewer.  (Betty Hill told me 
    that  she tried to show the size and depth of the stars by the relative 
    size  of  the  circles she drew.  This and the fact that  the  map  was 
    alleged to be 3-D did not come out in Interrupted Journey, so Atterberg 
    would not have known that.) 
    
       Sheaffer  notes  that seven of Atterberg's pattern stars  appear  on 
    Dole's list as stars that could have habitable planets. These stars are 
    Groombridge 1618  (Gliese 380,  BD + 50 1725),  Groombridge 34  (Gliese 
    15,BD +43 44), 61 Cygni, Sigma Draconis, Tau Ceti,  Epsilon Eridani and 
    Epsilon Indi.  Of these seven, only Epsilon Eridani, Tau Ceti and Sigma 
    Draconis are above Doles'  absolute magnitude minimum.  The others  are 
    listed in a table in his book Habitable Planets for Man,  but with  the 
    designation:   "Probability of habitable planet very small;  less  than 
    0.001."  Epsilon Eridani was discussed earlier.  Sigma Draconis appears 
    good  but  is  listed  as  a probable  variable  in  Dorrit  Hoffleit's 
    Catalogue of Bright Stars.  Variability great enough to be noticed from 
    Earth at Sigma Draconis'  distance would cause problems for life on its 
    planets. This leaves Tau Ceti which is one of my pattern stars also. 
    
       Another  point  Sheaffer  made was that orientation of  my  map  was 
    arbitrary compared to Atterberg's map's orientation with Gould's  belt. 
    One  of my first questions to Betty Hill was,  "Did any bright band  or 
    concentration  of stars show?"  This would establish the galactic plane 
    and the map's orientation,  as well as indicate it was not just a local 
    map.   But there was none indicating that if the map was valid  it  was 
    probably just a local one. 
    
       The  plane of the face of my model map is not random,   as  Sheaffer 
    indicated.   It  has intrinsic value for the viewer since many  of  the 
    pattern  stars  form a plane at this viewing angle.  The value  to  the 
    viewer is that these stars have their widest viewing separation at that 
    angle, and their relative distances are much more easily comprehended. 
    
       My  final  interpretation of the map was the only one I  could  find 
    where all the restrictions outlined above were met.  The fact that only 
    stars  most  suitable  for Earthlike planets remained  and  filled  the 
    pattern seems significant.

    ZETA RETICULI -- A RARE SYSTEM 
     
    By Jeffrey L. Kretsch 
     
       Zeta Reticuli is a unique system in the solar neighborhood -- a wide 
    physically associated pair of stars almost exactly like the sun.  After 
    searching  through a list of stars selected from the Gliese catalog  on 
    the basis of life criteria,  only one other pair within a separation of 
    even  0.3  light-years could be found.  (This pair --  Gliese 201   and 
    Gliese 202,  a  K5e and F8Ve pair separated by 0.15  light-years --  is 
    currently being investigated.) Zeta Reticuli is indeed a rare case. 
    
       Based on the Fish interpretation of the Hill map,  the Zeta Reticuli 
    pair  forms the base of the pattern.  If the other stars in the  patter 
    fit, it is a remarkable association with a rare star system. 
    
       In order to deal with this problem, I decided to computer the three-
    dimensional  positions of the stars and construct  a  three-dimensional 
    model showing these stars positions. 
    
       Speaking quantitatively, I discovered the two patterns are certainly 
    not  an exact match.  However,  if one considers the question of  match 
    from  the standpoint of how the Hill pattern was made as opposed to the 
    derived pattern's means of reproduction,  the quantitative data may not 
    be a complete means of determining whether the two patterns "match"  or 
    not.  For example, the Hill pattern was drawn freehand --  so one would 
    have  to determine how much allowance one must give for differences  in 
    quantitative  data.   In  such areas,  I  am not qualified to  give  an 
    opinion.  However, because the map was drawn freehand from memory,  the 
    fact  that the resemblance between the Fish map and the Hill map  is  a 
    striking one should be considered. 
    
       In  my  work I was able to verify the findings of Marjorie  Fish  in 
    terms of the astronomy used.
