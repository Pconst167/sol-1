SUBJECT: <<UFONET>> Echomail Policy:                         FILE: UFO2003


 --------------------------

        Currently <<UFONET>> has 3 echomail areas established. There
is a Sysops echo, and two public UFO oriented echoes where the bulk
of the discussion will take place. The reason for the inclusion of
2 UFO echoes should become self evident upon reading the respective
descriptions which follow. It is hoped that people will make use of
both areas, depending on the nature of the subject matter they wish
to discuss. I hope that people will see the spirit behind why such
a decision was made, and adhere to it as closely as possible.

        Obviously, from time to time, it will be debatable as to which
echo certain pieces of information, and strains of thought will best
belong. As Moderator, I hope to be as relatively easy-going and as un-
obtrusive as possible when acting in that capacity. From time to time
it may be appropriate to shift debate to another echo, but for the
most part I will leave this to the discretion of the users, and hope
they adhere to the echomail policy in the spirit of good faith in which
it was designed to be observed.



 <<UFONET> User Sanctions:
 ------------------------

        <<UFONET>> places a high value on its role as a forum for the
unincumbered, free flow of information relating to the subject of UFOs.
As such, there will be no censorship of any kind, except for that which
pertains to a User using profanity, or intentionally causing mischief or 
any other outrageous activity which is in violation of the spirit of the
"Code of Conduct". It is hoped that, in my capacity as Moderator, action
will never have to be taken against a User. However, if it is brought to
the <<UFONET>> Sysops attention that a violation has occured, it will be
decided collectively by the <<UFONET>> Sysops as to whether it constitutes
a breach or not of the "Code of Conduct", and appropriate action will then
be taken, which is one of the following:

    o Action dismissed as not being a violation.
    o If a violation, then User will get a 1st lightly worded warning.
    o Upon a second violation, User will get a strongly worded warning.
    o On a third violation, User will get a 30-day suspension of their
      write priviledges. On any subsequent breach, the offending User
      will no longer be permitted to access <<UFONET>>.       



 <<UFONET>> File Policies:
 ------------------------

        One of our greatest assets, is our huge file library, with
well over 300 files on almost every aspect of study and research
within "UFOlogy". We take great pride on the quality and diversity
which is present within. Its our hope that you will make use of, and
add to the quality and number of our existing file base.
        Our files are obtained from a variety of sources. Most are
composed by individuals such as yourself, and then uploaded to a BBS
or on-line service. Some of our material is also excerpted from books
and publications. Because of copyright sensitivity, it is suggested
that where possible, accreditation should be given. As we are a non-
profit, loosely based organization, by no means should individual files
be reproduced and the contents therein sold for profit. Our goal is
to disseminate as much of this information, as widely as possible, for
people's private individual use only.
        Regarding the 5-Star "rating" system used within the file library,
it should be understood that this is a purely subjective, unofficial
classification system used merely to point out "interesting" files. They are
there for your benefit only, and do not represent a <<UFONET>> endorsement.



Description of UFONET_A Echo:
 ----------------------------
 Beginning with the premise that the subject of UFOs is one laden
 with both controversy and emotion to begin with, two public echo
 areas have been instituted in order to accomodate the widest array
 of both Users and information relating to the discussion of UFOs.

 UFONET_A Echo is intended to be a forum for discussion on those
 elements of the UFO enigma to which there is more or less a
 "concensus" upon within the UFOlogical community. Discussion
 here will tend to be more conservative, and less speculative as
 we examine those aspects of the UFO phenomenon which are for the
 most part, accepted by most of the leading researchers within
 the UFO community at large.

 Examples of discussion material, include UFO sighting and abduction
 reports. Scientifically based theorizing on composition of UFO craft
 and operating of propulsion systems, etc., generally referred to as
 "nuts and bolts" discussion. Its hoped that "skeptic" and "believer"
 and those inbetween, can co-exist peacefully within both UFONET echoes.
 While some discussion material will inevitably overlap both echoes, it
 is hoped that the spirit of this arrangement will be adhered to. 


Description of UFONET_B Echo:
 ----------------------------
 Beginning with the premise that the subject of UFOs is one laden
 with both controversy and emotion to begin with, two public echo
 areas have been instituted in order to accomodate the widest array
 of both Users and information relating to the discussion of UFOs.

 UFONET_B Echo is intended to be a forum for discussion on the more
 highly speculative and controversial aspects of some theories and
 positions as held by certain UFO researchers and participants. This
 however is not meant as a license to discuss fantasy or make-believe.
 It is assumed that all participants in both echoes are here to discuss
 issues which are meaningful to them, and which they hold in good faith.
 The subject has enough controversy in it without having to resort to
 fabrications. Appropriate for this echo is also highly speculative
 discussion ranging from conspiracy/coverup theories, to that of the
 implications of alien communications and interaction with humans. Its
 hoped that "skeptic" and "believer", and those inbetween, can co-exist
 peacefully within both UFONET echoes. While some discussion material
 will inevitably overlap both echoes, it is hoped that the spirit of
 this arrangement can be adhered to by all involved.
