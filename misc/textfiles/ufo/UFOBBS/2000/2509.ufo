      Sorry,   but I am not making myself scarce.  I  have  been  patiently 
    sitting here and waiting for you to respond to my last message. The one 
    in which I told you that I was `well aware' of whom Richard Miller was. 
    So far, you have made yourself scarce. 


      As for the original message quoted above,  the one that Don  Kirshner 
    sent  Corbin and he re-entered I will be sending out a response.   Stay 
    tuned.   Nothing that can legitamently hoax the Phoenix Project has yet 
    been introduced.
