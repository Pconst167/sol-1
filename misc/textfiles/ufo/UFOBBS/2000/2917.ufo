God's messengers deliver threat of world destruction.

The spectacular appearance of a huge crucifix in the sky over Jerusalems is a 
warning to the world the God is displeased, according to international Bible 
experts and religious leaders.

The cross as a formation of a dozen alien spaceships. Christain experts claim 
the awesome event was predicted in both the Old and New testaments.

"This is one of the signs promised before the end of the world," says Jousef 
Hadi, patraiarch of an old Coptic Christian church in Jerusalem. "Those flying 
crafts were piloted by messengers of God.

"They were following His wishes by delivering the threat of global 
destruction. The cataclysm will be carried out unless all nations lay down 
their arms and embrace their brothers."'

'God anry'

Jousef says the UFOs appeared in the shape of a flying cross to assure 
earthlings the mission has a religious significance. Other experts echo the 
belief.

"It is God's warning foretold by the prophets in the Old Testament, and by 
Christ and Revelations in the New Testament," says Father David Lachmed at the 
Jesuit seminary outside Jerusalem.

"God is angry about the rivers of blood that are flooding the world. He has 
put us on notice that the fate of the planet is in our hands."

The appearance of the cross so close to Eater increases its significance and 
its importance, the leaders say.

'Hallucination'

Their warnings came after the governments of Israel, Jordan and Iraq confirmed 
the sudden appearance of glowing golden orbs above the Holy City at dusk one 
evening.

Previously, all three governments had insisted the sighting was a mass 
hallucination and that the hundreds of photos taken were fakes.

The cross sthat hovered about 12,000 feet over Jerusalem was approximately 
1,500 feet long and 600 feet wide. The dazzling display was seen by thousands 
of observers for several hours from various locations in Jordan and northern 
Iraq as well as in Israel.

Aron al-Fahad, a shop keeper in Jericho, claims he watched the manifestation 
for almost three hours.

He says it was clearly a formation of UFOs, adding: "You could see each 
individual ship, especially after the sun went down."

Lawrence Carney, a British engineer, says he too could identify circular 
spaceships.

"Many flashing lights circled the rims and ran along the undersides," he says.

But American tourist Francis Kellogg and at least 1,000 locals and other 
visitors claim the hovering forms were actually angels.

Photographed

Many say they heard a heavenly voice repeating chapter one, verse tow from The 
Second Letter from Peter in the New Testament, including:

You will do well to pay attention to it, because it is a lamp shining in a 
dark place...
Patriarch Hadi agrees with the angel faction.

"God has sent His heavenly messengers as He has so many times before," Hadi 
says.

Photos taken by two American tourists and examined by SUN photo experts 
support the UFO theory.

However, Jewish and Muslim leaders are adamant that the sighting was neither 
supernatural nor extraterrestrial.

"Would Allah use a Christian symbol, the cross, to warn us of His 
displeasure?" asks Mufti Rashid Rahman.

Rabbi Lev Ginzberg believes the manifestation was caused by atmospheric 
conditions, pollution and a sand storm raging in the Negev Desert.
