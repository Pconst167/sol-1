      If you own a VCR or rent or buy movies, you will be familiar with the 
    warning  that appears on your screen that the film you are  viewing  is 
    protected  by a copyright and that the Federal Bureau of Investigations 
    or  Interpol  can arrest you for copying the film.  The warning  is  to 
    prevent "pirating" of someone else's copyrighted material. 
    
      But what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander.  The 
    United States Justice Department stands accused of pirating copyrighted 
    material--having  supplied it to the Canadian government,  the  Israeli 
    government and Iraqi government . . . and to the FBI, itself. 
    
      That  is how deep the INSLAW computer software case has become.   The 
    case  started  out  when  the  Justice  Department  bought  PROMIS,   a 
    copyrighted  software  program  that  helps  to  track  criminal  cases 
    throughout  the  United  States.  When friends and associates  of  then 
    Attorney  General  Edwin Meese attempted to buy the  software  company, 
    INSLAW  turned them down and then life was made miserable  for  INSLAW. 
    Within  90  days the Justice Department reneged on their contract  with 
    INSLAW and refused to pay for the software program,  even though it was 
    using  it.   The  Justice Department is accused by  federal  judges  of 
    attempting  to bankrupt INSLAW and then hasten the bankruptcy court  to 
    declare  them insolvent.  Instead,  the courts ruled that  the  Justice 
    Department used "fraud, deceit and trickery" against INSLAW and awarded 
    the small computer software company $6.8 million in damages. 
    
      The  case  became  deeper when friends of Meese  began  to  sell  the 
    program  to foreign military establishments and the Justice  Department 
    began  to  provide the copyrighted material to other  U.S.   government 
    agencies.   A  man who was once fired from INSLAW was put in charge  of 
    INSLAW's  payments--which  were  never  forthcoming.   Another  Justice 
    Department official, who is now a Federal Judge in Northern California, 
    was a direct competitor to INSLAW in California. The Judge who made the 
    $6.8   million  ruling  lost his job.  The  attorney  for  the  Justice 
    Department  who  fought against the Judge's ruling was promoted to  the 
    Judge's vacant position.  There have been wholesale changes and firings 
    at the Justice Department over the INSLAW case. 
    
      The  Justice  Department  is  now  under  investigation  by  a  House 
    subcommittee and this committee is receiving many documents to  support 
    the  premise  that the Justice Department has a skeleton in its  closet 
    that stinks greater than Watergate. 
    
      But  new documents emerging in the case demonstrate a wider  scandal. 
    In an affidavit dated February 17,  1991, Ari Ben-Menashe describes his 
    12   year service for the Government of Israel in foreign  intelligence 
    and  provides  an  eyewitness account of a presentation to  an  Israeli 
    intelligence agency in 1987 in Tel Aviv, by Earl W. Brian of the United 
    States. 
    
      Brian is a close associate of Meese from his California days.   Brian 
    and  Meese were both in Ronald Reagan's California Cabinet when  Reagan 
    was governor. 
    
      According  to Ben-Menashe's affidavit,  Brian stated in his  presence 
    that  he  had  acquired  the property rights  to  the  PROMIS  computer 
    software and that as of 1987 "all U.S. intelligence agencies, including 
    the  Defense Intelligence Agency,  the Central Intelligence Agency  and 
    the National Security Agency, were using the PROMIS computer software." 
    Ben-Menashe  further  states in his affidavit that Brian consummated  a 
    sale  of  the PROMIS computer software to the Government of  Israel  in 
    1987. 
    
      He  further claimed that Brian also sold the PROMIS computer software 
    to  Iraqi Military Intelligence.  According to Ben-Menashe's affidavit, 
    the   Israeli  intelligence  officer  learned  of  this  sale  from  an 
    eyewitness who helped Brian broker the sale in his office in  Santiago, 
    Chile--Carlos Carduen of Carduen Industries.  Carduen has been a  major 
    supplier to the Government of Iraq with weapons and munitions. 
    
      The  Federal Government of Canada has admitted that  INSLAW's  PROMIS 
    software  is currently operating in at least two  federal  departments, 
    including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Mounties are using the 
    program in 900 locations in Canada. 
    
      INSLAW never sold its software to Canada,  Iraq, Israel,  the Central 
    Intelligence  Agency or the National Security Agency.  It also has  not 
    been  paid  by  the Justice Department for its use,  despite  the  $6.8 
    million ruling in INSLAW's favor. 
    
      The Justice Department insists that the FBI is not using  the  PROMIS 
    program.   Yet  FBI  Director William  Sessions  and  Deputy  Assistant 
    Director  Kier Boyd,  have made it clear that the FBI now is unable  or 
    unwilling  to provide assurances that pirated software is not  included 
    in the case management information system used by FBI field offices. 
    
      And  in  a  startling development,  a  man named  Charles  Hayes  has 
    asserted  that  the  U.S.  government has pirated the  PROMIS  computer 
    program.   The Justice Department has sued Hayes in the U.S.   District 
    Court in Lexington, Kentucky, seeking to compel him to return copies of 
    computer software left on equipment Hayes'  salvage business  purchased 
    from  the  U.S.   Attorney's Office in Lexington.  Hayes  has  publicly 
    claimed  that  the  salvaged  equipment  contained  pirated  copies  of 
    INSLAW's PROMIS software. 
    
      One cover-up begets another cover-up? This is how Watergate spread.
