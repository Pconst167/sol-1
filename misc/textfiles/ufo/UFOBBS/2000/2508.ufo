                                    Abstract

      K-2;  the alleged alien base in the Plumas National Forest is branded 
    a hoax by default when the recorded radio transmission is found to be a 
    copy of a tape which was available in bookstores across the country.

      From the moment I became aware of the Roswell case I have  maintained 
    an ongoing interest in crashed ufos,  direct contact, and abductions. I 
    tend to be more open to statements than some,  taking an innocent until 
    proven  guilty  attitude,  rather than the more adversarial  "show  me" 
    stance. ( I am not from Missouri ).  This means I listen to everything. 
    I  save everything.  I  cross index everything.  But I  challenge  very 
    little.   The  jury remains out until something is produced  which  can 
    withstand  the  scientific  method,  or is good enough to go  before  a 
    courtroom judge.  The result is a very large "wait and see"  file,  and 
    occasionally a solidly closed case. 
     
      My  wait and see attitude combined with a healthy dose of  dumb  luck 
    has permitted me to move the K-2  report squarely from the wait and see 
    file into the closed section. Cross indexed under HOAX. 
     
      I have closely monitored the netmail concerning the K-2  report since 
    the story first broke in June. Direct e mail with the spokesman for the 
    Phoenix  Project and conversations with other interested  parties  have 
    consumed  a  sizeable  portion of my storage  space.   Yet  I  remained 
    unwilling  to  send  the Phoenix Project the money it  desired  for  an 
    original copy of the reports. 
     
      Conversations  with David Brune led to an arrangement for him to send 
    me  his  copy of the K-2  report along with a copy of the  taped  radio 
    transmission which led the Phoenix Project to investigate the K-2  site 
    to begin with. I received the packet in early October and was surprised 
    to find the contents of the tape familiar to me. 
     
      It  should be noted that the tape received from David is labeled  K-2 
    Radio   Transmission  Monaural  (58:20)   and  was  associated  with  a 
    descriptive  paper noting its origin having been recorded on June,   5, 
    1989   at  0200   PDT from shortwave  frequency  16.222   Megahertz  at 
    Forbestown,   California.  A  note from the technical data states  that 
    "Oscilloscope  observation of the recorded signal reveals the  presence 
    of pulsed digital information impressed on the predominant analog audio 
    signal components".  It then goes on to say that "This digital data may 
    be encrypted". 
     
      This  description of the K-2  radio transmission is inconsistent with 
    my  own findings.  The actual contents of the K-2  tape are a  monaural 
    reproduction of a tape which I purchased several years ago from a local 
    bookstore. I am happy to say that after some digging in my garage I was 
    able  to  locate my STEREO commercial production tape,  and that it  is 
    still  in good condition.  My own tape is labeled ASTRAL SOUNDS and was 
    copyrighted  1973   by  The  American  Research  Team.   The  tape  was 
    distributed  under license by POTENTIALS UNLIMITED,   INC.   Potentials 
    Unlimited marketed a wide variety of self help/self hypnosis/subliminal 
    message  tapes in the late eighties.  Their products were available  in 
    the  big chain bookstores such as Waldons and B Daltons.  The  original 
    intent  of the ASTRAL SOUNDS tape was to synchronized sound with  brain 
    wave    frequencies    for    some    interesting    effects     during 
    listening/meditation. 
     
      Both tapes have been donated to Paranet for the listening pleasure of 
    serious  researchers.  If you have been considering purchasing ANYTHING 
    from the PHOENIX PROJECT. I strongly advise you to reconsider.
