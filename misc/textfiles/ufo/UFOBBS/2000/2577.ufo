   BELLEVILLE, Wis.  (AP) -- Lavonne Freidig  says she first thought it was
a distant  flock of geese, but  closer observation showed an  object shaped
like an airplane fuselage with no wings.
   Belleville had  recorded another sighting  this year of  an unidentified
flying object.
   "It just hung there.   I watched it and watched it,"  she said Monday of
the object or objects she and her son, Bill, saw in the sky at dusk Sunday.
   After several minutes, the hitherto motionless object took off without a
sound, leaving  a vapor trail  and several  smaller objects behind  it, she
said.
   "It  was  really  strange,"  said Ms.   Freidig,  adding  that  a  local
businessman and several of his out-of-town  relatives, as well as residents
of nearby Paoli also saw the object,  and that someone also photographed it
with a camera he had in his car.
   She said  she and her  son called the  Dane County sheriff's  office and
were given  the number of a  national unidentified flying  object reporting
center to call.
   The cigar-shaped object appeared  to be about as large as  a pen held at
arm's length, she said.
   In mid-January,  Belleville police officer  Glen Kazmar  reported seeing
lights much brighter  than a star suspended  in the sky west  of Belleville
for more than a half hour one evening.
   He said at the time that  a Federal Aviation Administration radar center
in Illinois detected a slow-moving object on its radar screens on the night
in question.
   Jack Smith, manager of the FAA control tower at the Dane County Regional
Airport in  Madison, said Monday  that tower  operators did not  report any
unidentified objects on their radar screens Sunday evening.
   He said the tower received no reports of sightings from pilots.
