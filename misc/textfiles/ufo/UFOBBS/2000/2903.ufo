Senator Barry M. Goldwater, K7UGA
Scottsdale, AZ   85253


Dear Senator Goldwater:

In June of this year I wrote to you regarding a number of letters
which certain individuals in the field of UFO investigation claim
they have received from you concerning your involvement with
certain aspects of the UFO. In particular, your attempts to gain
access to certain information the government is alleged to have
in its possession. Since I have received no response to my prior
letter, I would once again like to ask you to confirm whether
these letters are authentic. I am enclosing facsimile copies of
these letters (downloaded from a computer bulletin board). Some
errors in spelling and style may be present due to the nature of
their being fed into a computer and printed, but they are
supposed to be true to the originals.

I fully realize that you get a lot of correspondence, perhaps
more than you would like, from people like me seeking to obtain
information. As I stated in my previous letter, there are many
letters and documents in circulation in the UFO research
community pertaining to different aspects of the overall picture.
Some are obviously false, others aren't. What I am trying to do
is establish, once and for all, the authenticity of some of these
documents. If you would confirm that you wrote the letters or
didn't, then you can help clarify at least one aspect of this
area of UFO research. I know of several individuals who are
claiming, without having any contact with you that I can
determine, that the letters from you are fakes. I would
greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely Yours,


John D. Aultman, KA5UBL

Dear Mr. Aultman:

I did receive your letter, but there is really nothing that I can
add to what you already have spoken of. I cannot give you any
other information because all of my files are now the property of
The Arizona Historical Foundation at Arizona State University.

Sincerely,
/s/
Barry Goldwater
