SUBJECT: A CUFON EDITORIAL 16-MAY-1994                       FILE: UFO2133



         This the third in a series of CUFON editorials: 16-MAY-1994
 ==========================================================================

We have recently read _The Truth About The UFO Crash at Roswell_ by Kevin D.
Randle and Donald R. Schmitt, M. Evans and Company, Inc., New York, 1994, 
ISBN 0-87131-761-3.  It is clear that interest in this book has been high 
long before its publication. 

As stated by the authors, this book is destined to stir controversy as its 
contents are at odds with much prior work on the "Roswell incident".

We are concerned about the omission from _The Truth About The UFO Crash at 
Roswell_ of certain information regarding Project Aquarius.  Please see the 
"Ice Documents Press Conference" by Dale Goudie and Mr. Chris Lambright June 
25, 1987 available here on CUFON. 

The following letter was mailed to Mr. Donald Schmitt outlining our 
disappointment with this omission.  It is posted here so as to make this an 
"open letter," and to remind all that _one_ piece of information on the NASA 
Telex _has_ been proven: Project Aquarius.

May 5, 1994

Mr. Don Schmitt


Dear Don,  

Congratulations on the publication of _The Truth About The UFO
Crash at Roswell_, we believe that it represents several steps
towards resolution of this most interesting case.  

We also believe that you and Kevin are right about the
controversy that will follow the publication of this book.  It is
not our intention to add to that controversy or attack you or
your work.  However, since we think that the matter about which
we are writing is important, we felt that we had to write to
express our disappointment in one particular matter.

In the Chapter "The Majestic-12 Hoax," page 188, you address that
document which you and some others are calling "the Aquarius
Telex".  You and Kevin state that "...the important fact is that
everyone agrees that the Aquarius telex is a hoax," thus, with
one sentence, dismissing it and all of the information it
contains. 

To our knowledge _one_ piece of information on the Telex _has_ been
proven: Project Aquarius.  

We would remind you that the information that Project Aquarius is
real and is/was a NSA project, the very mention of which 'could
reasonably be expected to cause grave damage to the national
security' was released at the "Ice Documents Press Conference" by
Dale Goudie and Mr. Chris Lambright June 25, 1987.  

Please also recall that you had some telephone conversations with
Dale Goudie last year during which the Project Aquarius matter
was discussed.  Subsequently, Dale mailed you a copy of the _Ice
Documents Press Conference_ and _The Confirmation Paper_ shortly
thereafter.  Additionally, the _Ice Documents Press Conference_
material has been available on CUFON since July 1991.

Don, we think that the omission of the fact that Project Aquarius
is/was a real NSA project unfortunately does a disservice to
those seeking the whole story.  

We understand your wish to expose the MJ-12 material for the
fabrications that we too believe them to be.  In fact, we are the
recipients of a FOIA release from the FBI (which conducted an
abortive investigation into the MJ-12 briefing paper as a
possible unauthorized release of classified material), which uses
stronger language than any other agency's response we've seen
quoted.  "BOGUS" was written in large black letters with a
marking pen diagonally across the pages of the briefing paper. 
This material has been available on CUFON since August 1993.

Please note that we have posted an electronic copy of this letter
on CUFON.

Again, congratulations on the publication of your new book.

Sincerely yours,

      /s/ Dale Goudie                  /s/ James Klotz

      Dale Goudie                      James Klotz
