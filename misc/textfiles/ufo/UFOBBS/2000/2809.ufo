SUBJECT: THE UFONET CHARTER                                  FILE: UFO2809




The <<UFONET>> Charter:
 ----------------------

 - We are a not-for-profit operation, and prohibit the charging
   of user fees in order to specifically access <<UFONET>>.

 - Our goal is to provide an unbiased, free and open forum, for
   those persons interested in discussing any of the many aspects
   which relate to the "UFO phenomenon", as its commonly known.

 - <<UFONET>> will not have an official editorial policy. Rather,
   we will let the Echo and File areas act as a vehicle whereby
   people may let their positions be known without discrimination.

 - <<UFONET>> Sysops and users are strongly encouraged to attract
   to the network known individuals who have expertise in some
   aspect of the field of "UFOlogy". Our combined objective is to
   reach the widest user base, composed both of researchers and
   the general public, in order that information may be analyzed
   and disseminated to the benefit of all.

Press Enter...

 - The heart and soul of <<UFONET>> is its echomail conferences,
   and file resource library. All validated users who observe the
   "Code of Conduct" shall have unimpeded access to these areas.

 - As <<UFONET>> is non-profit, we are not in competition with any
   other groups and organizations in the same field. Our goal here
   at <<UFONET>> is to act in part as clearing-house for information
   past and present which impacts the study of "UFOlogy". Where
   possible, we hope to co-operate with other groups and organizations
   in our shared goal of making the public better educated and informed.

 - For purposes of Voting, all <<UFONET>> Sysops who have been with the
   network for a minimum of three months, shall be accorded one vote.
   The Moderator (Tom Mickus), shall be accorded two votes, while the
   acting Hub Sysop will be given an additional franchise.

 - Changes in the <<UFONET>> Charter and policy, shall be achieved by
   a two-thirds majority by the <<UFONET>> "Operating Committee",
   composed of all <<UFONET>> Sysops and the Moderator.

 
                            - Tom Mickus  February 26th/1989
