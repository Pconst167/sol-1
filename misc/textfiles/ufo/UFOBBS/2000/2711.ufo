      Basically,   Robert  Sheaffer's  contention is that  at  least  three 
    patterns  can  be  found  that are similar to Betty  Hill's  map,   and 
    therefore, more such interpretations are likely. If one stipulates that 
    any  stars from any vantage point can be used,  then I agree that  many 
    patterns  can  be  found similar to the map.   However,   if  one  uses 
    restrictions  on the type of stars,  according to their probability  of 
    having planets and also on the logic of the apparent travel paths, then 
    it  is  much more difficult.  The three maps were:  (1)   Betty  Hill's 
    interpretation  of  the constellation Pegasus as being similar  to  her 
    map, (2) Charles Atterberg's work, and (3) my work. 
    
      When I started the search, I made a number of restrictions including: 
    
      1) The sun had to be part of the pattern with a line connected to it, 
    since the leader of the aliens indicated this to Betty. 
    
      2)   Since  they  came  to our solar system,   they  should  also  be 
    interested  in solar type stars (single main sequence G,  probably also 
    late single main  sequence F and early single main sequence K).   These 
    stars  should not be bypassed if they are in the same general volume of 
    space. 
    
      3)   Since there are a number of the above stars relatively near  the 
    sun and the pattern shows only 12  stars,  the pattern would have to be 
    relatively close to us (or else they would be bypassing sunlike  stars, 
    which is illogical). 
    
      4)  The travel pattern itself should be logical.  That is, they would 
    not zip out 300  light-years, back to 10  light-years,  then out 1,000, 
    etc. The moves should make a logical progression. 
    
      5)  Large young main sequence stars (O,  B,  A,  early F)  which  are 
    unlikely to have planets and/or life would not be likely to be visited. 
    
      6)  Stars off the main sequence with the possible exception of  those 
    just  starting off the main sequence would probably be avoided as  they 
    are  unsuitable  for  life and,  due to their  variability,   could  be 
    dangerous. 
    
      7) If they go to one star of a given type,  it shows interest in that 
    type star --  so they should go to other stars of that type if they are 
    in the same volume of space.  An exception to this might be the closest 
    stars  to the base star,  which they might investigate out of curiosity 
    in the early stages of stellar travel.  For example,  they would not be 
    likely to bypass five red dwarfs to stop at the sixth,  if all six were 
    approximately equal in size,  spectra, singleness or multiplicity, etc. 
    Or,  if they go to one close G double,  they would probably go to other 
    close G doubles. 
    
      8)   The base star or stars is one or both of the large circles  with 
    the lines radiating from it. 
    
      9) One or both of the base stars should be suitable for life -- F8 to 
    K5  using the lowest limits given by exobiologists, or more likely,  K1 
    given by Dole. 
    
     10) Because the base stars are represented as such large circles, they 
    are  either intrinsically bigger or brighter than the rest or they  are 
    closer to the map's surface (the viewer) than the rest --  probably the 
    latter. This was later confirmed by Betty Hill. 
    
      Mrs.   Hill's  interpretation  of  Pegasus  disregards  all  of these 
    criteria. 
    
      Atterberg's  work  is  well  done.  His positioning of  the  stars is 
    accurate.  He complies with criteria 1, 2, 3, 5, 6  and 8;  fairly well 
    with 4;  less well with 9, and breaks down on 7 and 10. I  will discuss 
    the last three of Atterberg's differences with my basic criteria in the 
    following paragraphs: 
      
      Relative  to  point 9,  his base stars are Epsilon  Indi  and Epsilon 
    Eridani,   both  of  which are near the lower limit  for  life  bearing 
    planets  --   according  to most exobiologists --  and  not  nearly  as 
    suitable as Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli. 
    
      Concerning  point  7,  I  had ruled out the red dwarfs  fairly  early 
    because there were so many of them and there were only 12  lined points 
    on  the Hill map.  If one used red dwarfs in logical consecutive order, 
    all  the lines were used up before the sun was reached.  Atterberg used 
    red dwarfs for some of his points to make the map resemble Betty Hill's 
    but he bypassed equally good similar red dwarfs to reach them.  If they 
    were  interested in red dwarfs,  there should have been lines going  to 
    Gliese  65  (Luyten 76208)  which lies near Tau Ceti and about the same 
    distance from Epsilon Eridani as Tau Ceti, and Gliese 866  (Luyten 789-
    6) which is closer to Tau Ceti than the sun. Gliese 1 (CD-37 15492) and 
    Gliese 887  (CD-36  15693) are relatively close to Epsilon Indi.  These 
    should have been explored first before red dwarfs farther away. 
    
      Red dwarfs Gliese 406  (Wolf 359) and Gliese 411 (BD + 36 2147)  were 
    by  passed  to  reach  Groombridge 1618  and Ross 128   from  the  sun. 
    Barnard's  star would be the most logical first stop out from the  sun, 
    if one were to stop at red dwarfs, as it is the closest single M and is 
    known to have planets. 
    
      Since Atterberg's pattern stars include a number of relatively  close 
    doubles (61  Cygni,  Struve 2398, Groombridge 34 and Kruger 60),  there 
    should also be a line to Alpha Centauri --but there is not. 
    
      Relating to point 10,  Atterberg's base stars are not the largest  or 
    brightest of his pattern stars.  The sun, Tau Ceti,  and Sigma Draconis 
    are brighter.  Nor are they closer to the viewer. The sun and 61  Cygni 
    are  much  closer  to  the  viewer than  Epsilon  Eridani.   The  whole 
    orientation feels wrong because the base stars are away from the viewer 
    and movement is along the lines toward the viewer.  (Betty Hill told me 
    that she tried to show the size and depth of the stars by the  relative 
    size  of  the  circles she drew.  This and the fact that  the  map  was 
    alleged to be 3-D did not come out in Interrupted Journey, so Atterberg 
    would not have known that.) 
    
      Sheaffer  notes  that seven of Atterberg's pattern  stars  appear  on 
    Dole's list as stars that could have habitable planets. These stars are 
    Groombridge 1618  (Gliese 380,  BD + 50 1725),  Groombridge 34  (Gliese 
    15,BD +43 44), 61 Cygni, Sigma Draconis, Tau Ceti,  Epsilon Eridani and 
    Epsilon Indi.  Of these seven, only Epsilon Eridani, Tau Ceti and Sigma 
    Draconis are above Doles'  absolute magnitude minimum.  The others  are 
    listed in a table in his book Habitable Planets for Man,  but with  the 
    designation:   "Probability of habitable planet very small;  less  than 
    0.001."  Epsilon Eridani was discussed earlier.  Sigma Draconis appears 
    good  but  is  listed  as  a probable  variable  in  Dorrit  Hoffleit's 
    Catalogue of Bright Stars.  Variability great enough to be noticed from 
    Earth at Sigma Draconis'  distance would cause problems for life on its 
    planets. This leaves Tau Ceti which is one of my pattern stars also. 
    
      Another  point  Sheaffer  made was that orientation  of  my  map  was 
    arbitrary  compared to Atterberg's map's orientation with Gould's belt. 
    One  of my first questions to Betty Hill was,  "Did any bright band  or 
    concentration of stars show?"  This would establish the galactic  plane 
    and the map's orientation,  as well as indicate it was not just a local 
    map.   But  there was none indicating that if the map was valid it  was 
    probably just a local one. 
    
      The  plane  of the face of my model map is not random,   as  Sheaffer 
    indicated.   It  has intrinsic value for the viewer since many  of  the 
    pattern  stars  form a plane at this viewing angle.  The value  to  the 
    viewer is that these stars have their widest viewing separation at that 
    angle, and their relative distances are much more easily comprehended. 
    
      My  final  interpretation of the map was the only one  I  could  find 
    where all the restrictions outlined above were met.  The fact that only 
    stars  most  suitable  for Earthlike planets remained  and  filled  the 
    pattern seems significant.
