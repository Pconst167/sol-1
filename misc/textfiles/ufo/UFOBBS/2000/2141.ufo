            (Ted)     Did everyone read the press release that Speiser
                      uploaded. GA

            (DON)     Hi ya all, I got a letter from Jim on our board
                      here stating that the networks should be releasing
                      the info on the Gulf Breezes sometime sat or
                      today. no word yet.

            (Ted)     Yes. I called th Gulf Breezes Sentinel on Friday,
                      but they refused to give out any info at this
                      time. They are however, sending me a copy of all
                      articles they have published to date on the
                      subject.

            (DRAX)    Greetings, Earthlings

            (DON)     Hi guy.

            (Ted)     Well speak of the !$#@@**. Hi Jim.

            (DRAX)    Hi Ted.  Sorry, what were you talking about?

            (Ted)     Gulf Breezes and the news releasee you uploaded
                      earlier.  Do you have any further info on the
                      subject.

            (DRAX)    Yup. <evil snicker>

            (Ted)     Don't keep us waiting. DUmp it SPeiser!

            (DRAX)    Haha....

            (DRAX)    From what I've been able to put together a press
                      conference took place on Friday, attended by,
                      among others, Walt Andrus, Donald Ware (FL MUFON
                      Dir.) and a couple of investigators. I understand
                      the main percipient was NOT there,  still wants to
                      remain semi-anonymous.

                      According to Bruce Maccabee, a special camera was
                      sent by MUFON, registered and sealed, to be used
                      by the fellow. on his next photographic outing. He
                      did so, and, as Bruce says, "There's something
                      there....". The camera, according to Walt, was a
                      special 3-D model (anyone know anything like
                      that?). He has also passed a lie detector test.
                      That's about all I know now.

            (Gerry)   I know what 3-d cameras are, if that's what you're
                      asking.

            (DRAX)    Can such things be disguised as regular 35mm?

            (Gerry)   I'd think it unlikely, as they have two lenses.












            (Ted)     I have a 3-D camera but it is a slide  type taking
                      two slides at once.  I believe Dale is next.

            (Dale)    Pass.

            (Ted)     We are using formal CO rules tonight. If you have
                      a question or comment type a "?" or "!" I get to
                      you in order. Ok DBC your up GA

            (DBC)     Ok. Jim, what about this "amazing" vidio that was
                      viewed by Andrus and Hopkins?

            (DRAX)    All I know is, its reportedly "amazing." I haven't
                      seen it so I can't tell you much.

            (Ted)      ok Don Youre up.

            (DON)     Jim, I've kept my eye on the tube all weekend!
                      where is the news reprot?

            (Ted)     Jim repy?

            (DRAX)    Good kveschin. I think all you need do is refer to
                      my recent exchange in JFORUM to see that we in
                      ufology may have cried wolf once too often, and
                      now that perhaps we have a real wolf in the fold,
                      Big Media is putting us on permanent ignore.

            (Ted)     The sky is falling ! GA

            (Ted)     JIM, you got more out of Walt A. than I did.  When
                      I talked to him earlier this week he told me they
                      had a special camera but wouldn't tell me what
                      kind.  If it is the same 3-D type camera that I
                      have then I doubt they will ge much.  You have to
                      be real close to get much of a three D effect.

            (DRAX)    Ok, I don't know for sure what type of camera it
                      is, Walt told me 3-D and also told me not to spill
                      the beans on that, but Bruce told me that he had
                      taken a picture with it, so I figured it was time.
                      Walt may not have described the camer properly,
                      however. GA

            (Gerry)   Even though you don't have much 3d effect you
                      still may get important differences in
                      registration of images which can turn up under
                      analysis.

            (Ted)     Yes, thats true. It would give the ability to
                      measure the distance to the object within limits.

            (DRAX)    A few points should be made. Its important that
                      the guy made the effort to use the camera. it was












                      registered. That indicates, at least, that he
                      doesn't fear "exposure" as a hoax. Its also the
                      first time a UFO percipient has ever used a
                      registered camera provided by investigators. Bruce
                      Maccabee is ufology's leading photo-analyst,  and
                      while he has not passed final judgement on the
                      photos, he remains cautiously (oh so cautiously)
                      enthusiastic. "There's something there" from Bruce
                      is QUITE a bit of enthusiasm, I assure you.

            (DON)     Ok, Jim, two questions. First, was the half hour
                      documentry aired by the local Fla. station, and
                      next, the witness are you inferring that the
                      object kept returning to the same area to be
                      photographed?  (and what about Budd?)

            (DRAX)    As far as I know, the show was aired, and John
                      Lear has arranged for a tape to be FedExed to him.
                      I should hear from him Monday. I don't know if the
                      object returned to the same location each time,
                      but this has been an ongoing series  of sightings,
                      yes. And what about Budd? He's also enthusiastic.

            (DON)     I refer to Budds area of expertise-abductions-any
                      word?  ga

            (Ted)     I understand that Budd is VERY enthusiastic about
                      the case and feels that the abduction is a
                      certainty.  The abductee at last word was
                      unwilling to be hypnmotized at this time a little
                      fearful of the hypnosis, I understand. Jim did you
                      want to add more.

            (DRAX)    Beyond that he suspects a series of abductions,
                      no.  Yes, I think we should just say that NOTHING,
                      of course, is a true certainty at this time, and
                      that enthusiasm <> endorsement. But it certainly
                      is looking very good so far to my knowledge,
                      nothing has yet turned up to throw a bad light on
                      the case.

            (DBC)     Jim, do I understand correctly that members of the
                      media in gulf breezes have seen the craft?

            (DRAX)    I don't think I've heard that. That is certainly
                      true in Texarkana, but not to my limited knowledge
                      in Gulf Breeze.

            (DBC)     I find it interesting that there have been so many
                      examples of media people who have actually
                      witnessed these things certainlly the case in the
                      Hudson valley as well as Arkansas. What bothers me
                      is why doesn' Big Media seem to have any faith in
                      Small Media?












            (Ted)     I think you can get the answer from the thread
                      going on under the subject "JFORM and UFOs".) They
                      are just plain not interested in anything that
                      does not have "researchable" material that can
                      hold up in the public scrutiny of fellows like
                      Phil Klass.

            (DRAX)    It looks like we're going to have to wait for Sam
                      Donaldson to be abudcted and do a live feed from
                      aboard a beamship before the subject gets the
                      attention it deserves speaking of Klass, I had
                      dinner with him the other night. GA

            (Ted)     Ok jim, what did he have to say and did you need
                      any bicarb afterwards. GA

            (Dale)    Traitor

            (DON)     THE BIG BUG-A-BOO, HUH??

            (DRAX)    "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"
                      --Don Corleone  ... I always need bicarb after
                      eating in my restaurant. He knew nothing of
                      Texarkana, and very little of FL. after I
                      described a little of what I knew of the latter,
                      his reaction was basically, "Well, if you believe
                      in the govt. cover-up theory, you would think the
                      Air Force would be down there confiscating photos
                      and hushing up witnesses. The fact that they
                      aren't must prove to you that they think its a
                      hoax." He had some other things to say, most of
                      which left such a bad taste in my mouth I'd rather
                      not repeat them. GA

            (Ted)     Jim, do you think that Klass really believes all
                      the theories ne puts out. (I was going to say CRAP
                      but thought better of it.) ga

            (DON)     manure also fits

            (DRAX)    Yes, I do. I don't believe he is in the employ of
                      the govt because I'd like to think the govt. would
                      spend my tax dollars on a better debunker.

            (Ted)      Ok, I think we have been ignoring DON and for
                      that I beg forgiveness. Ok DON you're up.

            (DBC)     Ted, Neil. is here.

            (DON)     Thank you. Ok, I think that DBC made an execellt
                      point about the large medias. I find it hard to
                      believe that potentially the largest story of this
                      centuray could be ignored in this manner so I













                      think that there could be another reason for them
                      to ignore this story.  Anyone else think so? ga

            (Ted)     Neil it appears you have generated a lot of
                      interest here tonight.  Bring us up to date on the
                      Lake Erie triangle.

            (Neil)    Ted, the Erie Triangle is not what it is called.
                      The Lake ontario triangle is where the Triangle
                      is, but many sightings do occur on Lake Erie. This
                      will take a minute of everyone's timw, but to
                      answer John.'s ?, if you go to the public library,
                      the U.S. Geological Survey Team has a U.s. Gov't
                      photo(infrared) that shows the structure under
                      Lake Ontario. As far as the magazine name, I
                      discussed this with my team & they said no way at
                      giving the name out over the air, but if I were to
                      meet you in person or talk on the phone, that's a
                      different case.

            (Ted)     Neil, I tried to call you on the Phone this week.
                      The operator said that either you didn't exist or
                      that you had an unlisted number.  I figure the MIB
                      had gotten to you!  I tried to get your number
                      through information in Rochester.  If you number
                      is unlisted please send it to me via EMAIL.

            (Neil)    Sounds great!!! Yes, it is unlisted...I have to or
                      owe you a reply, but you will get my # before I
                      exit the forum tonight!

            (Joe)     Thanks, just a fast comment on Big Media.  Check
                      out the March 5 TV Guide, under Jeers on Page 23,
                      its a  criticism of Network News for SOFT stories
                      (like UFOs).

            (DBC)     Neil, you were trying to give us some clues on the
                      name of the mag but about all I could come up with
                      was Rand McNally with emphasis on the RAND. Is
                      this close? also could you tell us what section of
                      the lake this "ufo base" is suppose (DBC) to be
                      located.?....and finally since you say you have
                      seen the craft over 300 times, do you have a
                      secret for how to locate them or a sense of when
                      and where to look?

            (Neil)    I wonder!!!

            (Ted)     ga NEIL

            (Ted)     Neil GA















            (Neil)    The approximate location is between NiagAra-on-
                      the-Lake & Toronto,Ca & it is about 15
                      mile(approx.) from the N-o-t-L Shoreline......GA

                      of bulletins first, we're working on getting an

            (Ted)     Neil read the DL10 Database in a recent addition.
                      (Last two days) for further info. ga

            (Neil)    Thanks, Ted!!!!GA

            (Randy)   Anybody know what happened in Texarkana....I was
                      about to go down there??

            (Ted)     There has been a recent UFO series of sightings
                      there.  Much like those of the Hudson valley
                      variety. GA

            (Randy)   Apparently about 500 people have reported seeing a
                      vehicle like the Hudson Valley craft??

            (Ted)     Neil. john abrams had a question on the board
                      about the gov't  document.  Perhaps john would
                      like to bring it up here? GA

            (John)    neil, what is the name of the magazine? tell me
                      more about the photo?ga

            (Neil)    John, please understand this I cannot reveal the
                      name over the air waves, but in person or on
                      telephone....GA

            (Ted)     Neil, we would also like to know more about the
                      gov't photo that you have...

            (Neil)    it specifically shows a long...

            (John)    neil will you c i will send you my phone no. over
                      easyplex call me collect












            (Neil)    Sounds fine with me but near the end of this CO
                      session. OK

            (Ted)     the govt photo did it have a number on it. GA

            (Neil)    NO, we found it was not necessary for being
                      published.GA

            (Randy)   Neil....Did your photo have any government
                      identification numbers on it, or the specific name
                      of any government agency???

            (Neil)    The U.S. Geological Survey Team is the one that
                      has access to 3 diffent sattelites!!!...GA

            (Randy)   Did the photo have the terms "LANDSAT", SEASAT",
                      or any similar nomenclature stamped on the back or
                      front???

            (Neil)    The original photo from U.S.Geo had something
                      similar to SEASAT...GA

            (Randy)   Does the photo have any U.S. Geologi?

            (DBC)     you were about to describe what's in the photo
                      please continue.ga

            (Neil)    The photo shows a structure under water that comes
                      out the Western part of toronto and purtrudes
                      approx. 15 miles out. Our team check out
                      everything possible even Toronto Water Works &
                      they know of no such structure!!!GA

            (Ted)     Has you're team sent out any underwater divers?  I
                      know a little about the waters there enough to
                      know that if you're seeing a structure under water
                      then it can't be too deep.  The waters there are
                      just not that clear.

            (Neil)    Our team can not find anyone with the guts to go
                      out there at night when the most activity takes
                      place...There have been many planes and) small
                      watercraft that have disappeared over the
                      years...Any Volunteers?

            (Ted)     Neil, I would think that the time to go out would
                      be during the day when it is easier to see what is
                      under the water.  From what I remember of the
                      waters in that area the structure couldn't be more
                      that 50 feet or less and still be able to see it
                      under the best of condtions.

            (Neil)    That is one thing our team can't say;is how deep
                      the structure is in the water I do know it is












                      quite deep. Cousteau's son had his air line cut'
                      by something' & he died in those waters. What cut
                      the air line who knows. This happened not too many
                      years back.

            (Randy)   Yes, first a comment and then 2 questions for
                      Neil. The comment is that satellite imagery does
                      not necessarily illustrate depth or visibility
                      conditions in water...the questions for Neil are
                      1).  Do you have the U.S.Geological Survey Photo
                      Numbers for the prints in your possession??...and
                      2) Are the prints primarily in red/brown tones, or
                      in green/blue tones, or do they appear to be
                      "regular" color photographs???

            (Neil)    The closest is 'red/brown' tones...I have a photo
                      in my posession that is cropped for detail and
                      unfrtunately the public labrary has the U.S.Geo
                      photos under refernce...It frustrates me when
                      these obstacles are always in the way!!!GA

            (Gerry)   IR may not scatter at the same rate in the murk as
                      does visible light.  Anybody know?  Also the
                      small-scale detail may be lost before the large-
                      scale structure.

            (Ted)     IR doesn't scatter as much but does get absorbed
                      faster. GA

            (Gerry)   Ok.  Just thought I'd bring it up.  ga

            (Ted)     Good question. GA

            (Neil)    Ted, please be more discriptive...

            (Gerry)   But even if absorbed, isn't it re-transmitted,
                      rather sort of diffused? ga

            (Ted)     I'm not sure what you mean by re-transmitted. GA

            (Gerry)   Only thinking that the general temperature of the
                      water above the object may be changed by its IR
                      radiation. If it were, it would show up in IR
                      photos.

            (Ted)     If the water is warm it will give off IR radiation
                      do we know that the photos were of IR nature? GA

            (Randy)   YES....!!!

            (Ted)     Then I guess the resolution all depends on how
                      deep and how "hot" the object is also how much
                      energy absorbing material there is.  oK Randy
                      anything more. GA












            (Randy)   Yes...I have to ask Neil if the images were
                      digitized, that is, consisting of small squares,
                      or true linear IR photographs, I.E., no small
                      squares??

            (Neil)    True Linear IR photos!!!...Ted, I am serious when
                      I mentioned about any takers with a good size
                      watercraft that will go out on the lake around
                      dusk...GA

            (Ted)     Anyone out there with a craft willing to go out in
                      these waters?  If not....

            (DBC)     Not me thankyou!!!!!

            (Ted)     Neil why don't you post a message on the message
                      board.

            (Joe)     IR would only show heat differential, what is at
                      the land end of the structure and is the
                      structrure hot or cold?? .. ga

            (Neil)    Good idea, Ted!!!

            (Randy)   Right!!!

            (Neil)    Light differiental is also involved with IR
                      photos!GA

            (DBC)     Neil, from what position have you been observing
                      the entries/exits into the underwater base) and
                      have you estimated how often the entries/exits
                      occur?

            (Neil)    It used to be almost every Wed. and Sunday
                      nights...somestimes a person will sit there for 4
                      hours and in the last 15 minutes of that 4 hours,
                      everything happens or it could be weeks...Ted, I
                      would like to make a statement on the photos...GA

            (John)    sit where

            (Ted)     Ok NEIL GA

            (Neil)    first, John., Niagara-on-the-lake, Canada) looking
                      toward Toronto,Canada...Ted, The IR photos from
                      the sattelite match our land triaglation perfectly
                      of where the base is!GA

            (John)    neil, you sit and watch these craft entering and
                      leaving the structure from 15 miles away?

            (Neil)    Approximately...I would rather say 12 miles away
                      to give an exact figure, John!!!GA












            (John)    how can you tell exactly what you are observing
                      from that distance? how large are the craft?

            (Neil)    Answer to first ?: through binoculars,camera but
                      actual shape(s) are Lights with shape & there are
                      many variation...Our team is not totally positive
                      if there is anything else besides the lights we
                      see at dusk & nighttime. There is one daylight
                      picture that is totally different from the craft
                      we see at night...as far as sizes, from 50 feet
                      wide & up. GA

            (Randy)   Thanks Ted....I have to check out in a few
                      minutes, but just wanted to mention that I will
                      check the current generation sat data on this area
                      during the week, and let everybody know next week
                      if any of the digital stuff shown anything like
                      Neil describes in the area of Niagra-on-the-Lake.
                      It sounds like he has come upon an older linear IR
                      camera image of the area...some of these types of
                      images have problems...I wish I had the U.S Geo
                      area numbers and would  appreciate Neil providing
                      those?>??

            (Neil)    Randy 1977

            (Randy)   Does Neil have coordinates or U.S. Geo numbers???

            (Neil)    The U.S. Geo might refer you to the public
                      library...how does it go...roand & round the
                      uokjukmkl if you know what I mean!!!GA

            (Ted)     How about ther numbers Neil? GA

            (Randy)   I don't have that problem, Neil!!

            (Neil)    Public Library should provide recent #'S. I'm glad
                      someone does not have that problem...GA

            (Ted)     Am I lost or are we talking in riddles? GA

            (Neil)    We are in the conference room...heh,heh!!GA

            (Gerry)   First, a question to Neil: What motions do you
                      observe? Vertical into and away from the horizon
                      or something else? Second, I used to work at UC
                      Berkeley Space Sciences Lab where ...Second is not
                      for you neil, first is. Second is, SSL had a large
                      remote sensing project, which could possibly have
                      relevant photos. Also know some people on the SETI
                      project at Ames who might be friendly enough to
                      look up whatever info on these photos might exist
                      there. Any feeling about whether it would be













                      worthwhile renewing old contacts over this?ga
                      anybody

            (Neil)    YES!!!

            (DBC)     definitely gerry.

            (Gerry)   Ok, I will do so.ga

            (Neil)    Leave me E-Mail on results,if possible. There are
                      many variations to flight of these craft...e.g.-
                      leaf falling effect swirling,from direction to
                      direction you name it...especially with using
                      color infrared slide film...it does wonders!!!GA

            (Joe)     Two quickies, first, I do not understand the
                      magazine part of the discussion. second, are the
                      photos being published?

            (Neil)    Which photos:the IR phoros about the structure of
                      ufos..GA

            (Joe)     your photos

            (Neil)    YES. Some have been previously published in local
                      area newspapers, but a book will be released in
                      the early 1990's. GA

            (John)    neil, i think that joe was asking aboout the
                      magazine that you mentioned last week will you at
                      least tell me if it is a nationwide publication or
                      is it some regional or local type of publication i
                      still do not understand why you withold its name
                      from us, publicly.

            (DBC)     More clues Neil.ga

            (Neil)    Weren't you the one earlier that mentioned the
                      name of a publication??? Keep it to yourself!GA

            (DBC)     yes.ga

            (Neil)    Yes!!!...

            (Ted)     Which edition? GA

            (Neil)    A different way of saying it!!! 1977

            (Ted)     Which page. GA

            (Neil)    All the Great Lakes!!!

            (Ted)     I guess that lets the cat out of the bag! GA













            (Neil)    In a different perspective, I might say!!!GA

            (Ted)     DO all editions subsequent to 1977 have it or just
                      that year? GA

            (Neil)    Just that year at excellent quality!!!

            (Ted)     You heard it first here Folks! GA

            (John)    now i want neil to again describe exactly what to
                      look for in the magazine photo.ga

            (Neil)    A long structure under the lake coming from
                      Torontos east end, under the lake! You can't miss
                      it!!!GA

            (John)    ok i'll check

            (Neil)    TED! Could you please leave me mail with your home
                      #.GA

            (Ted)     Sure Be gald to.  I will be gone tommorrow but
                      will be at work on Tuesday. The Wed I will be in
                      Ann ARbor but back Thurs.  I will leave number in
                      EMAIL. GA

            (Neil)    When do you feel you will get off of here,
                      tonight???GA

            (Ted)     Shortly. GA

            (Ted)     Like 10 Min. GA

            (Neil)    If possible, Toight.GA

            (Ted)     It's busy now. GA

            (DBC)     I was going to ask Neil about his abduction
                      studies, but perhaps its getting too late to get
                      into that.ga

            (Neil)    Well, The abduction case correlate with Lake
                      Ontario & Erie, but it is a little late this
                      evening to start, I feel!!!GA

            (DBC)     how about next week?ga

            (Ted)     Good Idea! GA

            (Neil)    As a part of the conference, sure












            (Ted)     Can you make it next week Neil GA

            (Neil)    I like to give other people a chance to talk,
