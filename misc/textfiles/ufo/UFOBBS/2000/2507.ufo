    The Validity of the K-2 Report: Addendum 1 & 2
    By: Joseph Harris
                                                

      There  is  a problem with the K-2  Report that was  so  obvious,   it 
    remained hidden until  I  printed  it out and poured over  it  while at 
    work.  (Nothing better to do..  :^)  I  started by hi-lighting all  the 
    dates and times  given in the Information Update portion of the report. 
    Then I started doodling like so... 
     
    8-10-92 2215 PDT: Staff #1 receives phone call. 
     
      Anyway,   I   made myself a little time-line of events,  and  2  very 
    obvious errors showed up. 
     
      I'll quote  only the pertinent data from the K-2  report so  there is 
    proof of what they released..  the real clincher is the time-line  that 
    follows: 
     
      Remember.. we're looking at the sequence of events here: 
     
    INFORMATION UPDATE 
     
    Date: August 16, 1989 
    From: Staff # 1 
    Subject: Activity Reports concerning K-2 
    Comment from Staff # 1: 
    Date: August 10, 1989, Time: 2215 PDT. 
     At 2215 PDT, I received a phone call from Staff # 2 
    
    [text deleted] 
    
    I received the following information from Staff # 2 on August 14, 1989. 
    
                                     * * * 
    
    Report # 1: By Staff # 2
    Date: August 10, 1989, 
    Time: 2212 PDT. 
    Location: Approximately 40 miles southwest of K-2. 
     
    It remained stopped for approximately 15 seconds, then 
                        [text deleted] 
    The sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds. There 
                        [text deleted] 
    Within 10 minutes, after the object left the area, 
                        [text deleted] 
    towards the North. Four minutes later, the fighters

     camera... yeah right.] 

    Memo 
    August 12, 1989 
    From Staff # 1 
    To: Staff # 2 
    
      Our  contacts in the Air Force verify that on the night of August 10, 
    1989,  at the time indicated in Report # 1 of that date,  that eight F-
    4's, scrambled from Beale AFB,

     Time Line: 
     
    Aug 10 92: 2212 PDT Staff # 2 Object sighting begins. [Report #1] 
    Aug 10 92: 2215 PDT Staff # 1 receives phone call. 
     
      This  is the first major error.  According to the text of Report  #1, 
    the sighting lasted 45 seconds, then 10 minutes later the F-4s show up, 
    and  4 minutes after that the F-4s return.  A  total event time of  14m 
    45s.   Yet Staff #2  called Staff #1  only 3 minutes after the  initial 
    sighting.  This in and of itself proves nothing,  but becomes MUCH more 
    relevant to the next major error. 
     
    Aug 12 89: Staff #1 verifies AF activity as stated in Report # 1. 
    Aug 14 89: Staff #1 RECEIVES Report # 1 
    Aug 16 89: Staff #1 Begins Information Update. 
     
      Do you see the error?  I'll let you re-read the portion of the Aug 12 
    statement... 
     
      Our  contacts in the Air Force verify that on the night of August 10, 
    1989,  at the time indicated in Report # 1 of that date,  that eight F-
    4's, scrambled from Beale AFB, 
     
      HOW  COULD HE VERIFY DATES AND TIMES IN A REPORT HE WOULDN'T  RECEIVE 
    FOR TWO MORE DAYS??? 
     
    Here's the line from Staff #1: 
     
    I received the following information from Staff # 2 on August 14, 1989. 
    
                                     * * * 
    
    Report # 1: By Staff # 2: 
    Date: August 10, 1989, Time: 2212 PDT. 
     
    Now  is where the first error becomes important.  If the time was but 3 
    minutes between the start of the sighting,  and the phone call to Staff 
    #1,  then Staff #1  had NO WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE JETS FROM THE PHONE 
    CALL.  The jets didn't show for 10 minutes, remember? There was a swift 
    conversation, and then no further phone communication,  since they were 
    worried about wire taps.  I doubt that the Phoenix Project will be able 
    to claim that this was a simple typo,  as all the rest of the memos and 
    comments follow a very precise pattern.  They attempted to show us that 
    the Phoenix Project members are scientific,  and detail oriented.   All 
    they  succeeded  in doing was putting holes in their report  one  could 
    drive a truck through. 
     
    There is another curiosity in the K-2  Report,  but that will be posted 
    in a second message, as this one is long enough. 
     
    Conclusion: 
     
    Staff  #  1 directly referanced a document that by their own report  he 
    would  not receive for 2 more days.  This is a glaring error,  and  one 
    that would not have happened if the report were anything but a work  of 
    pure fiction.

    This is a simple curiosity about the K-2  Report, and not, exactly,  an 
    error. It does however, raise a question or two: 

    [Quote from K-2] 

    Comments by Staff # 1 
    Date: 8/29/89 

      Observations  of  night-time activity at K-2,  over the  past  month, 
    indicate  that  alien  crafts  are  making  supply  runs  at  two  week 
    intervals.  All of our attempts,  on site,  to photograph or video tape 
    their arrival, unloading and departures have failed. The aliens seem to 
    detect  our  presence even though we have made every effort  to  remain 
    concealed.   On two occasions,  from our concealed location,   we  have 
    observed  one  of  their craft making a landing  approach.   The  craft 
    suddenly veers off,  about two miles from the base,  and quickly leaves 
    the  area.  For both practical and economic reasons we cannot  continue 
    this surveillance.  In our opinion,  we have validated the existence of 
    the base and the alien activity associated with this site. 

                                     * * *

    Two problems with this:                                                   
                                                                              
    1.  From  what they say,  all attempts to photograph or video tape  the 
        objects have failed. 
         
        Yet  they also say that on 2 occasions they observed landing  craft 
        making an approach, but turning away while still 2 miles out. 
         
        Sorry guys, but ANYTHING you can see,  you can photograph and video 
        tape.  You don't mean to tell me that trained scientific-  military 
        people  went  to  observe a supposed alien base  and  FORGOT  THEIR 
        CAMERAS?  That makes about as much sense as the guy who went to the 
        LZ and saw landing marks, but conveniently forgot his camera. 
                                                                              
    2.  They also state that over the course of the "last month" the aliens 
        have  been  making regular supply runs at 2 week  intervals.   That 
        doesn't  jive with the rest of the report.  That would have covered 
        most of the month of August, in which we already know that at least 
        one sighting was made.  Why no mention of the others? Why was Staff 
        #  2  so excited about his sighting on the tenth if this was to  be 
        expected?  How can they state with such confidence that the  supply 
        runs  are regular?  If they make the supply runs every  two  weeks, 
        then  they would only have had 2 chances to observe  them.   Hardly 
        enough  data  to  base the opinion that these  are  regular  supply 
        runs... 

    "  In our opinion,  we have validated the existence of the base and the 
    alien activity associated with this site." 

    This line deserves absoloutly no comment... 

    Conclusion: 

    This  portion  of  the K-2  report raises  more  questions  about  it's 
    credibility in general. If the US postal service were a bit faster, I'd 
    be able to post quite a bit more about the K-2  report. Until I receive 
    my  confirming  data  though,  this will have to  remain  simply  as  a 
    teaser... sorry. :^) 

    Joe.
