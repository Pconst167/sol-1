SUBJECT: SAUCERS FROM WITHIN ?                               FILE: UFO2282


In the early 19th century an American eccentric, John Cleves Symmes (1779-
1829), sought funding for an expedition to enter the Earth through one of two 
4,000-mile wide polar holes. Inside the Earth, he was convinced, a benevolent 
advanced civilization existed. Though an object of derision to most people, 
some took him seriously, and the idea of a hollow Earth was championed in a 
number of books throughout the rest of the century and right into the next.

Today, hollow-earthers believe flying saucers zip in and out of the polar 
holes. The people inside are descendants of Atlantis and its Pacific 
equivalent, Lemuria. There is even a strong Nazi wing of the movement. 
According to Canadian neo-Nazi Ernst Zundel, the principal advocate of this 
theory, Hitler and his elite troops escaped with their saucer technology into 
the hole at the South Pole.
