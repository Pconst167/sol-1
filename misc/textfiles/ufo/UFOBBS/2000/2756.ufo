    One  of  the theories of how UFOs are propelled is that they  defy  the 
    force of gravity.  Some sort of "force"  would have to be created to do 
    that. 
     
    In  1986,   in a mineshaft in Australia,  scientists thought  that  the 
    gravity  recorded did not follow Newton's inverse square law.  If  this 
    were true then they might well have been on the track of a fifth  force 
    which defies gravity. 
     
    Scientists  from  the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La  Jolla, 
    California,   and  other locations have tested the theory by  measuring 
    gravity  from a submersible moving through 5 kilometers of water  along 
    the California coast.  The participating scientists determined that the 
    experiments  recorded the gravitational constant G to an accuracy of  2 
    parts in 1,000. 
     
    No signs of a fifth force were found. However, the experiments were not 
    able  to test for the force over great distances.  If a fifth force did 
    exist and show itself over 1,000  meters,  the measurements should have 
    differed from those several kilometers above the seafloor - a  distance 
    perhaps  out  of  range of a theorized  fifth  force.   No  appreciable 
    variation was found.
