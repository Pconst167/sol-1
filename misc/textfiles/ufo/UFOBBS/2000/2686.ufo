      I am somewhat reluctant to post.  I know how skeptical people can be. 
    Rightly  so I geuss.  There seems so much fooling around in this group. 
    Thanks to those who take this seriously. 
     
    In sept.  1985 while camping up over high point n.j. I  was abducted by 
    what  I  believe  had to have been extraterrestrials.   I   was  awaken 
    sometime  after midnight,  I  felt myself rising,  tent,  all my  gear, 
    everything,   floating up,  it was not at all that unpleasant,   smooth 
    rising. I was slow to react. I can have vivid dreams, it really took me 
    a  few minutes to know I was actually awake.  I  was not frightened.  I 
    knew something extraordinary was happening.  When I finally stopped,  I 
    felt cool metal beneath the floor of my tent. I crept to the opening of 
    my tent and started to undo the zippers and ties. Peeking out all I saw 
    was a uniform grey.  Floors, ceilings, walls? I couldn't tell. I  could 
    sense depth, it wasn't fog but fog like. By then, not scared,  but very 
    excited,  I sat and waited. Who am I? Nobody, this, I knew was the most 
    important  thing that could ever happen to me.  Some time passed (i had 
    no clocks of any kind), nobody came to get me.  Figured I'd be summoned 
    or something.  I had to pee. I stepped out of my tent. I  looked out in 
    the  gray blankness,  it was all I could see,  me and my stuff were all 
    there was. I pissed. I was embarrassed for myself. I felt I should just 
    do what I had too.  I walked maybe 100 yrds out. I  sensed nothing new, 
    just my stuff getting smaller behind me. Alot of time passed. I was now 
    a bit worried the food I had with me would not last too long. Finally a 
    wind whipped up. My stuff went sliding away from me. I laid flat to the 
    floor,  with this wind ripping over me, the pads of my finger tips were 
    the  only things holding me in place,  and I felt my grip beginning  to 
    slide, til finally I flew off in the direction of my stuff at the mercy 
    of this wind (force?).  When I came to rest I began to hear explosions. 
    Looking around I saw what appeared a battlefield.  A tattered chainlink 
    fence  topped with razor wire was in front of me (the direction I  slid 
    from).   The  explosions seemed far off.  I  could see flashes  in  the 
    darkened  (nightime?)  sky.  There was asphalt under me,  it felt  very 
    real, there air was cool, much cooler than the grey place,  helicopters 
    were  in the sky shining lights,  looking for something.  I  got to  my 
    knees, keeping low, I looked around, spotting a lit door in back of me. 
    I crawled to it,  crawled in the door way,  slamming it shut behind me. 
    It  was a hotel room.  An average looking place.  I  heard none of  the 
    sounds of war I had left behind.  There was a hot meal on a tray,  some 
    kind  of meat,  in a red tomato sauce,  with pasta,  or something  like 
    pasta,  it was bland stuff really, maybe not quite right. I ate it all. 
    I felt relieved, it seemed a normal enough hotel room. I took a shower. 
    I laid on the bed and slept for awhile after that. I was exhausted alot 
    of time  had  past. I woke in the very same room. An urgent thought was 
    'pressed'   into  my  mind.  See I,  David was given a  very  important 
    decision. I could end everything, not just my life, all life,  that was 
    clear,  all I had to do was press the tip of my pinky, to the center of 
    the wall. I decided to do it. I am not sure why, at this point, I  felt 
    I  was being tested,  like the rat in the maze and I didn't know  if  I 
    would ever see the world I knew again anyway,  maybe I was ready to end 
    it all.  I approached the wall,  and slowly applied my pinky tip to the 
    doomsday  spot.   Thru the walls I felt the searing heat  coming.   The 
    whitest  hot  wall of light replaced the wall of the room and  advanced 
    slowly  towards me.  As it got to me I felt it consume me,  it was  the 
    strangest  thing,  as it was working my way across my body towards  the 
    pinky tip that was still on the wall,  I was aware of the non-existance 
    of  the  parts  of my body the light was passing thru.   As  the  light 
    consumed my head,  I was still 'watching' it work down consuming my arm 
    to the pinky on the wall.  Before it consumed the last of my pinky tip, 
    I  released,   the tip from the spot,  and all was as it was  before  I 
    touched the spot.  It was remarkable. I tried it several times.  Always 
    releasing  the  tip from the spot before it was  totally  consumed.   I 
    feared what might happen if I didn't.  I  spent seemingly weeks in this 
    room,  facing similiar strange situations.  At the end of it, I  awoke, 
    stiff, sleeping on the ground where my tent had been pitched, the knees 
    of  my jeans where worn from crawling and stuff I did,  in the  seeming 
    weeks,   when I was wherever I was.  I  hiked back to my car and  drove 
    home. I did not report it to any authorities. I told some of my closest 
    friends.  They came up with lots of rationals. The experience was quite 
    real,  and I could really write hundreds of pages of what I experienced 
    in  the 'hotel room'.  My life goes on today.  I  don't care if  anyone 
    believes.  I was not mis-treated physically,  I  can recall none of the 
    medical type tests other people report.  I  am not sure whether I would 
    care for the experience again.  I think I would. I feel privileged in a 
    way.  There are forces in the universe greater than ourselves.  Capable 
    of  collecting  us  like bugs,  and running us thru  mazes  like  rats. 
    Skeptics go rot.  I really don't care if anyone believes, I wouldn't if 
    I hadn't gone thru it firsthand. I  will post more of my experiences in 
    the 'hotel' if anyone is interested. -dave
