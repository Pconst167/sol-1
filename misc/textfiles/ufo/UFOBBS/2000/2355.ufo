Speiser's Most Recommended UFO Books
------------------------------------
(reprinted from FIDO UFO Echo 7/10/89)


OVERVIEW - HISTORY
Jacobs, David M.      "The UFO Controversy in America"  Univ. of Chicago
        All bookshelves should start with this one.

OVERVIEW - SYNOPSIS/THEORIES
Hall, Richard            "Uninvited Guests"     Aurora
        Best overall primer, a must for the skeptic.

OVERVIEW - DEBATE
Sagan, C. and Page, T., Eds. "UFOS: A Scientific Debate"
        If you thought Sagan was always a skeptic, think again. Contains
        papers contributed to an AIAA symposium on UFOs, including ones by
        Hynek and Menzel. Pay special attention to the paper by Dr. Robert M.
        L. Baker.

OVERVIEW - SKEPTICAL
Klass, Philip J.        "UFOs: Explained"       McGraw-Hill
                        "UFOs: Identified"      McGraw-Hill
                        "UFOs: The Public Deceived"     Prometheus
        Perhaps the most important works in the field. (Surprise!) It
        was these three that convinced me that UFOs are a legitimate,
        bona fide mystery, unanswered by even the world's best debunker.

Shaeffer, Robert       "The UFO Verdict"       Prometheus
        Shaeffer is a Klass Klone to some degree, but does a credible
        job on many investigations of his own, most notably Jimmy
        Carter's sighting when he was Governor of Georgia (it was Venus,
        Jimmy!)

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATION
Hynek, Dr. J. Allen     "The UFO Experience"    Regnery
        First attempt at collating and digesting the massive amounts of
        data, and suggesting methods of study for the budding
        proto-science. Gave rise to the term "Close Encounters"

" ", Imbrogno, P., and Pratt, R. "Night Siege"  Ballantine
        A look at the very most impressive case on record, the Hudson
        Valley Boomerang. 9000 sightings through 1987, videotape,
        stills, sightings at nuclear reactors, hints of cover-up,
        possible abductions....this one's got it all.

Story, Ronald J.        "UFOs and the Limits of Science"
        Story is known for debunking Von Daniken, and has written for
        the Skeptical Inquirer. But when it comes to UFOs, ah, that's
        another "Story"!


CRASHED SAUCERS
Moore, W. and Berlitz, C. "The Roswell Incident"        Random House
        Say what you will about MJ-12, MIBs, and Moore's latest
        bombshell. This is STILL the best documented, best researched
        incident on record. Honorable mention to Stan Friedman, since
        the publisher saw fit not to recognize his contribution.


GOVERNMENT COVER-UP
Fawcett, L. and Greenwood, B. "Clear Intent"
        The authors make a very credible and as-yet unanswered case for
        the Cosmic Watergate. Contains reproduced documents obtained
        under the Freedom of Information Act, many of them acquired by
        Citizens Against UFO Secrecy. Watch out! These guys can back up
        just about everything they say!

Keyhoe, Maj. Donald E.  "Flying Saucers: Top Secret"    Holt
        Honorable mention - Good glimpse of the early days of the
        cover-up, and NICAP's thwarted attempts to "blow the lid."


ABDUCTIONS
Streiber, Whitley       "Communion"             Morrow/Beech Tree
        The largest selling of all UFO books. Regardless of what you
        think of Streiber and his strange tale, make no mistake: HE
        believes it. He is over-rated as a writer, however.

Hopkins, Budd           "Intruders"             Random House
        Much more readable than Communion, and downright scary in its
        implications. Hopkins does his best to make a case for genetic
        experimentation, but has come under fire for his unscientific
        methodology. Not bad for an artist, though.


ABDUCTIONS - SKEPTICAL
Klass, Philip J.        "UFO Abductions: A Dangerous Game"  Prometheus
        As with his previous books, important only for its failure to
        convince. Klass argues that the 1975 TV-Movie "The UFO Incident"
        is the genesis for the present spate of abduction-itis.


EXTRA CREDIT
        Hungry for more? Itching to get your hands dirty on the real
        nitty-gritty? OK, boys and girls, let's get down, let's get
        funky...

Bullard, Dr. Thomas E.  "UFO Abductions: The Measure of the Mystery"
                                                Fund for UFO Research

        A monumental two-volume, 673 page work by a folklorist who set
        out to show that abductions were nothing more than 20th century
        fairy tales. He admits he failed. Anyone who says we're not
        trying to take an empirical look at this subject should get a
        load of this. If its too much for you...

                       "On Stolen Time"         Fund for UFO Research
        Summary of the above work. A much more convenient (and
        inexpensive) 34 pages.

Swords, Dr. Michael, Ed. "Journal of UFO Studies"       CUFOS
        Ufology's very own refereed science journal. Includes articles
        on the Delphos Landing Trace Case (no, friends, it's NOT a
        "fairy ring"), the ET possibility, and  a very revealing round-table
        debate on abductions.
