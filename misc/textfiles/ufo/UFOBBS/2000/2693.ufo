    The Extraterrestial Hypothesis (ETH) 
     
    By far the most popular "theory" concerning the origin of UFOs, the ETH 
    is  also the one that over the years has aroused the most  emotion  and 
    controversy.   It  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  one  or   more 
    civilizations  from  outer  space,  far in advance of  our  own,   have 
    mastered  interstellar  space flight and have had the human race  under 
    systematic  observation  since  at least 1947.  SOme  see  a  long-term 
    involvement  by  the extraterrestials and propose that they  have  been 
    watching  over  man  and  perhaps even  controlling  his  physical  and 
    cultural development for millennia, thus linking the ETH to the ancient 
    astronaut concept. 
     
    The  main  problem with the ETH is space and time,  space in the  sense 
    that the average distance between the 130  billion or more stars in our 
    Milky  Way Galaxy is enormous,  and time in the sense that these  great 
    distances  would make an interstellar voyage very long.  Then there are 
    the  economic,   engineering,   and motivational  aspects  of  such  an 
    enterprise. 
     
    Despite this,  there is a pro-UFO movement which uncritically  believes 
    in  the  ETH.  There is no problem with such a belief,  provided it  is 
    identified  as such and is not construed as representing  an  empiracal 
    fact.  At the same time, the idea of an extraterrestial origin for UFOs 
    as  a  hypothesis  is quite reasonable,  despite  the  strong  feelings 
    against the possibility by many scientists who should know better. 
     
    The real basis for the ETH debate, although many involved in the debate 
    are  seemingly unaware of it,  is not whether (or how  much)   advanced 
    intelligence  exists  in the galaxy.  Most scientists will  agree  that 
    there  are probably many such intelligent civilizations in the  galaxy. 
    It is not even whether such civilizations have developed  interstellar-
    travel  capability.  The real point of debate concerns the  "volume  of 
    traffic." That is, most scientists find it very difficult to accept the 
    idea of extraterrestial visitation on the scal implied by UFO  reports; 
    that,  to them,  tends to invalidate all UFO reports.  In fact,  if UFO 
    sightings were not so common (say,  just one good report every three or 
    four years),  perhaps more scientists would seriously consider the ETH. 
    Interestingly,  this is precisely the reverse of what many  exasperated 
    UFO proponents believe; hence, their attempts to "prove" the ETH by the 
    sheer numbers of reports. 
     
    Despite intensive research by many individuals, scientific bodies,  and 
    federal   agencies   for  more  than  three  decades,   no   proof   of 
    extraterrestial visitation has been produced.  Such an idea, therefore, 
    must remain as only a viable and intriguing hypothesis,  very difficult 
    to test and frustrating to debate.
