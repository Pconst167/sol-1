SUBJECT: FBI SAY MJ-12 PAPER BOGUS                           FILE: UFO2129



27-AUGUST-1993                                       Seattle, Washington, USA

Recently, a case was presented in the popular UFO press, (UFO Magazine, 
Sunland CA), in which the US Air Force stated that the "MJ-12 Presidential 
Briefing Paper", was "bogus" in reply to an Freedom of Information Act request 
(FOIA). 

This file contains reproductions of all documents received from the FBI in 
response to our FOIA requests about investigations into the release of the 
supposedly highly classified "MJ-12" paper.  In short, the FBI now says that 
the "MJ-12" paper is "bogus" too. 

The events described in these documents are most interesting.  Please note the 
role of Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI): An AFOSI Special 
Agent approaches the Dallas FBI office with a copy of the MJ-12 paper, asking 
the FBI to determine the authenticity of the document.  FBI Dallas asks FBI 
Headquarters, (FBIHQ), Washington DC, what to do.  FBIHQ asks AFOSI 
Heaquarters, Washington DC, and is told that the document is "fabricated", and 
"completely bogus".  FBIHQ "advises" Dallas FBI to close the investigation.  

Apparently no FBI investigation was undertaken!?

             Dallas notes that within the last six weeks, there
     has been local publicity regarding "OPERATION MAJESTIC-12"
     with at least two appearances on a local radio talk show,
     discussing the MAJESTIC-12 OPERATION, the individuals involved,
     and the government's attempt to keep it all secret.  It is
     unknown if this is all part of a publicity campaign.

b7c per OSI  [       ] from OSI, advises that "OPERATION BLUE BOOK,"
     mentioned in the document on page 4 did exist.

             Dallas realizes that the purported document is over
     35 years old, but it does not know if it has been properly
     declassified.

     REQUEST OF THE BUREAU

             The Bureau is requested to discern if the document
     is still classified.  Dallas will hold any investigation in
     abeyance until further direction from FBIHQ.

     DL 65C-

             Dallas notes that within the last six weeks, there
     has been local publicity regarding "OPERATION MAJESTIC-12"
     with at least two appearances on a local radio talk show,
     discussing the MAJESTIC-12 OPERATION, the individuals involved,
     and the government's attempt to keep it all secret.  It is
     unknown if this is all part of a publicity campaign.

b7c per OSI  [       ] from OSI, advises that "OPERATION BLUE BOOK,"
     mentioned in the document on page 4 did exist.

             Dallas realizes that the purported document is over
     35 years old, but it does not know if it has been properly
     declassified.

     REQUEST OF THE BUREAU

             The Bureau is requested to discern if the document
     is still classified.  Dallas will hold any investigation in
     abeyance until further direction from FBIHQ.
