In light of the recent UFO sightings in Belgium, I'm posting a 12-9-89 newpaper
story on the same subject:

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The air force and police are investigating numerous UFO
sightings near the border with the Netherlands and West Germany, officials said
yesterday.

Since Nov. 29, dozens of people and police officials in the northeastern Liege
province said they've seen luminous objects in the sky, with some of them
describing a flying platform scanning the surface with three huge searchlights,
while others talk of dancing lights.

During the same period, air traffic controllers "found radar blips on the
screens that could not be immediately explained," said Defense Ministry
spokesman Col. Michael Mandel.

At the time of the sightings there were no authorized low-level filghts in the
region.  "We are looking for a rational explanation," he said.

Although Mandel cast doubts on several witness accounts, the Belgian Society
for the Study of Space Phenomenon said yesterday it would send members to the
German-speaking region in Liege and across the border in the Netherlands and
West Germany this weekend.  AP (89/12/9) DCS
