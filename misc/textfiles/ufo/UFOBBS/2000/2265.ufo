Hello UFO-Fans out there!
I think you heared about the "Philadelpia-Experiment"? If not, a short 
description: in 1943 the U.S.Navy made an experiment in Philadelphia / USA
under the leadership of Albert Eintein. They used Einsteins "Unified field
theory". This theory unifies electric, magnetic and gravity (!!!) fields.
School physics till today denie a relationship between electromagnetic and
gravity-fields. During this experiment a ship was made unvisible AND it
was teleported too. It ended absolutely terrible for the men on this ship.
U.S.Navy public-affairs-office denies the experiment at all. School physics
denies Eintein's unified-field-theory, because Einstein took it back himself.
He sayed, that it would be "unfinished"... Bud it may be, that Einstein did
it, because he saw the great danger for the whole world, if military would
use it without scruple. Imagine what would happen, if we would transform
gravity-energy into elecric-energy in a great style... For instance earth-
rotation would slow down!!!
Mr. Brown used this unified-field-theory too. It started, when he did ex-
periments with his coolidge-tube (an early x-ray-tube). He saw, that the
tube was moving, when he turned on the high-voltage-supply. Bud this couldn't
be, because after school-physics, there are only forces between both conden-
ser-plates, bud NOT between a whole condenser and the gravity-field of the
earth. Later, when he was studying, he made experiments with his Professor, 
Mr. Bifeld. Their work was known as "BIFELD-BROWN-EFFECT". They discovered,
that a condenser moves to the positive pole, if you connect it to a high-
voltage DC-supply...
In the early 50ths they made a demonstration at the US-defense-ministry with
60cm diametre - condensers, that could carry more then their own wight at
a speed of 180 m/s!!! They used a 50000 Volt power-supply and needed only
50 Watts! After this demonstration their work became the status of a No.1
military-secret. Mr. Bifeld is still alife,bud he can't leave his home,
because he's under permanent observation ofdifferent US - intelligence -
agencies... Mr. Brown died under unknown circumstances...
Imagine, if this would be the force, UFOs are using... If they would make
a complement gravity-field, they could fly manoeuvres, a jet-fighter could
never make, because of the very high gravity-forces. A humanoid inside of
such an UFO wouldn't register anything of these forces, because he is in
his own gravity-field!
And now remember the reports of those people, who saw UFOs. Everyone tells
you, that they can stop at once from very high speed. Normally a humanoid
couldn't survive this - only if he would have it's own gravity-field...
Me and some friends of mine made one of Brown's early experiments. We took
a PCB-board and made a condenser on one side. Then we rested it vertically
on two wires and connected it to the power-supply of a PC-Monitor...
Believe me, the condenser moves to the positive pole. Two of my friends
are physicans and they computed the forces on the condenser. It is a fact,
that this macroscopic effect is not to be explain with our known physics!
Try it yourself!!!!!
And tell it everyone who is interested in. Because if it would be true, that
this effect is one of the best cept secrets of the world (for over 50 years!)
the only way to save your health and maybe life is to report your experiences
to as much people as you can... I do so.
Live long and prosper!








ALTERNATIVE SCIENCES REPLY.
HI saw your bull asking about antigravity,free energy ect,
It was 15 years ago when I used to go down to the town of mortimer in the 
county of berkshire I was introduced to a one Mr John.R.R.SEARL.What mr
searl had invented was a "ether-vortex-tubine generator" and he had in fact
develope a saucershaped commercial aircraft.
The principal of it is allegedly that,when a metal annulus is rotated at
sufficent speed,the conduction electrons are displaced outwards by
centrifugal force,so producing a very intense negative charge on the outside
perimeter and a positive charge on the inside.
The rotating electric field so obtained can be tapped by indution coils
around the annulus to provide current for electromagnets placed in a electric 
motor arrangement around the annulus so as to drive the annulus,thus producing
a feedback effect resulting in very intense electric and magnetic fields.
when the electric potential is about 10 14 volts, this being conducted to a 
metal hull around around the annulus,shielding from both gravity and inertia
is obtained. because of the shape of the rotor and the need to maximize the
charge on the hull, the best shape of hull is like two saucers clamped 
together at very sharp edge.Directional control is obtained by use of flight
coils to produce assymetry in the (force field)".

         From a private letter of Mr C.B. Wynniatt
                            Professional Engineer
                      25 commins  street Onerahi,Whangarei,
                              New zealand.
                     The Ether Vortex Turbine by j.r.r. searl,england.
                        The   Barret  Report
                          issued by  P.L. Barret Bsc.
In 1949, Mr J.R.R. Searl was employed by the midlands electricity board as a
electronic and electrical fitter. He was enthutsiastic about the subject of
electricity,though he had no formal education on the subject other than what
i required by the job.Unhindered by conventional ideas about electricity, he
carried out his own investigation into the subject. during work on electrical
motors and generators,he noticed that asmall EMF electo magnetic field,was
produced by spinning metal parts-the negative towards the outside and positive
towards the rotatioal axis.In 1950 he experimented with rotating slip rings
and mesured a small EMF  on a conventional meter.
He also noticed that when the rings were spinning freely and no current was
taken,his hair bristled.
His conclusions were that free electrons in the metal were spun out by
centrifugal force, a centripetal force being produced by the static field in
the metal.He decided to build a generator based on the principal. It had a
segmented rotor disc,passing through electromagnets at its periphery. the
electromagnets were energized from the rotor,and were intended to boost the
EMF. By 1952 the first generator had been contructed and was about three feet
in diameter. It was tested in the open by searl and a friend, The armature
was set in motion by a small engine.The device produced the expected
electricalpower, but at a unexpectedly high potential. at relativly low
armature speeds a potential of the order of 10 5 (ten to the power of  five)
was produced, as indicated by the static effects on near objects. A
characteristic crackling and the smell of ozone supported his conclusion.
The relly unxpected then occured.While still speeding up the generator lifted
and rose to a hight of fifty feet,breaking the union between itself and the
engine. Here it stayed for a while still speeding up and surrounding itself
with a pink halo,this indicated ionization of the air at a much reduced
pressure of about 1-3 mm Hg.More interesting was the side effect,causing
local radio recivers to go on on their own accord! This could have been due
to ionizing disharge electromagnetic induction.Finally and perhaps thankfully
the whole generator accelerated at a fantastic rate and is thought to have
gone off into space.Since that day Searl had made some 10 or more small
flying craft some of whitch have been similary lost,and developed a form of
control.Larger craft have also been built - some 12 ft and two 30ft in dia.
The antics of his machines have given rise to much speculation as to the
origin of so called "flying saucers" specially in the area of warminster in
wilshire.
One wonders why searl has not come to the notice of scientists and the public
at large. The fact is that "he has;but for fear of being ridiculed,people
keep the knowlege or interest to themselves. the public has been educated
to scoff at the subject of flying saucers and the reported behavior of the
things cannot be explained on current scientific theory.
Such " difficult to explain" topics( as with telepathy,dowsing,homeopathic
healing,ect) must be given the "no comment" treatment so not to upset the
uncertain structure of present scientific theory. Searl"s records do show
however that his efforts have not gone unnoticed. Goverment departments
and people of all classes and education know about him. Some have attempted
to steal the idea, but their thinking along the lines electromagetic theory
and the law of conservation of mass and energy,has misled themor confused
them.This narrow thinking has made many to conclude that searl is a crank or
imposter. Also some are prejudiced in their attitude that new ideas are the
prerogative of a hierarchy of intellectuals.
It is suppected that searl is to come up with something more momentous than
his games with power lines and the unsupecting motorist. In that event, the
covensional thinker must br ready to adapt the searl effect into existing
theory. or chance the alternative fate of a compleat disruption revisal of
physical theory-from ampere,galvani,and volta onwards. Any theory must
explain these verious phenomena,some of whitch have been observed by searl
himself and some by the general public.
