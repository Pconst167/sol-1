SUBJECT: Spielberg to expose UFO Cover-ups.                  FILE: UFO2822


 
   Ace director Steven Spielberg is deserting science fiction - for
   science fact.
 
   The genius behind the movie blockbusters, ET, Close Encounters Of The
   Third Kind and Jurassic Park is secretly working on a 50 million pound
   movie that he claims will unmask a government cover-up of an alien
   spaceship crash in New Mexico in 1947. (Roswell crash, Corona Actually)
 
   Project X is based on the Roswell Air Force base incident which gave
   the world the term "flying saucer". [Note: Untrue, the term "flying
   saucer" came from the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June, 1947] Spielberg
   believes the US military took away alien bodies from the crashed UFO.
 
   Hollywood insiders say the director has got hold of previously unseen
   film footage of the flying saucer crash scene taken by a military
   officer. "Everybody is talking about Project X," says a Tinseltown
   source.
 
   Spielberg already has a team at Hamlin Productions working on the
   script.
 
   "This is going to be a totally different film from the likes of ET
   which was just a fairy story.
 
   "It's about the UFO crash and the political intrigue which followed."
   [Note: I presume this is from the same "Tinseltown source" who claims
   Spielberg has secret military footage of the crash]
 
   The movie is due out in 1997 - the 50th anniversary of the alleged
   alien landing. [Note: Some landing!]
