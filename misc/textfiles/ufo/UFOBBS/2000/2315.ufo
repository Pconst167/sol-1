     The Phoenix Project is a private, civilian, research organization formed in 1952 to
investigate and correlate information concerning Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and
Extra-Terrestrial (ET) activities. It has no affiliation with the United States Government or
any of its agencies.  Because of the nature of its work the Phoenix Project does not seek
publicity.

     Staff members are former military personnel who have all been associated with
intelligence activities, and have knowledge of covert government operations concerning
UFO's. Their knowledge of the specialized field of ~intelligence correlation,~ provide unique
insights into various subject matter.

     From time-to-time and in the public interest, the Phoenix Project will publish research
reports regarding certain subjects. A list of reports is available from our publisher.  All

                                          The Dulce Report


   In recent years, volumes of information have circulated within the UFO research community
regarding the alleged presence of a joint U.S.\Alien base in the area of Dulce, New Mexico.

   In an attempt to either prove or disprove the information, the Phoenix Project has completed
an intense investigation of the Dulce area. Our investigation encompassed the following:

   1.  A detailed physical search of the Archuleta Mesa by vehicle and on foot.

   2.   The physical exploration of a large area surrounding the Town of Dulce.

   3.   Interviews with local citizens, native American Indians of the Jicarilla Apache Indian
        Reservation and Rio Arriba County Sheriff and highway maintenance personnel.

   4.   A search of County building and construction permits and records, and interviews to
        determine if any large scale civilian or government construction projects ever
        occurred in the area from 1930 to the present.

   5.   A comprehensive aerial survey and airborne magnetometer survey of the Archuleta Mesa,
        the Town of Dulce, the Archuleta Mesa, and surrounding areas.


                                             An Overview

Re: Dulce

   The Town of Dulce, is located in northern New Mexico near the southern border of Colorado.
Dulce is located eighty-three miles northeast of Farmington, New Mexico on U.S. Route 64.
See Map Exhibit 1.

   It has a population of 1,648 and is nestled in a valley. Just to the north and overlooking the
town is the large Archuleta Mesa. The town is at an altitude of 6,825 feet above sea level. The
main income producing activity in the area is cattle ranching. The business and service activities
are typical of those needed in a community of this size. There are no military or industrial
activities, large or small, in the area.  See Photo Exhibits 4 and 5.

   In order to present the results of our investigation it is necessary to refer to items of
information, widely available to UFO researchers, concerning the Dulce, U.S.\Alien base. In the
following, we will quote from those items of information. We will attempt to identify the source
whenever possible. This will be followed by our findings.

   ...A joint US/EBE facility exists beneath the Archuleta Mesa near the town of DULCE NEW
MEXICO. (1A) This facility has been in existence in one form or another since 1948.

   (1B) ...The facility proper is located one kilometer underground.

   (1C) The base is approximately 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost overlooks the town.

   (1D) There is a paved government road 36 feet wide going into the area.

   Findings of Phoenix Project Investigation (PHX) regarding the foregoing:

   (PHX-1A) No substantiating County records confirm this. Local residents have no memory
of any government installation, civilian or military ever having existed in this area.

   (PHX-1B) Same as 1A. There is no record or memory of any underground heavy construction,
excavation, or mining activity in the area.

   (PHX-1C) See Map Exhibit 3.

   (PHX-1D) See Map Exhibits 2 and 3, and Photo Exhibits 6 and 7. The road in question is
Indian Reservation Road # J-2. It has never been labeled a "government" road. This road is not
paved, as described in the source material. It is a narrow, two lane dirt road (barely twenty (20)
feet wide that is completely open for public use.

   ...During the occupation of the Greys, they have established  quite a number of underground
bases all over the world, especially in the United States. (2A) One such base (among others in
the same state) is under Archuleta Mesa, which is about 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, New
Mexico.

   The foregoing extract is from a transcript of a conversation between Jim McCampbell and Dr.
Paul Bennewitz on July 13, 1984.

   (3A) ...Bennewitz reports he was able to determine the location of the underground facility:
a kilometer underground beneath Archuleta Mesa on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation near
Dulce, New Mexico (since 1976, one of the areas of the U.S. hardest hit by mutilations).
(3B) Bennewitz' information is that this installation is operated jointly as part of an on-going
program of cooperation between the U.S. government and the EBEs.

   Back to the base under discussion. After Bennewitz briefed Air Force officials on what he had
found, a trip to the area revealed the following data:

   (3C) The base is 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost overlooks the town. (3D) There
is a level highway 36 feet wide going into the area. It is a government road. (3E) One can see
telemetry trailers and buildings that are five-sided with a dome. Next to the domes, a black
limousine was noted -- a CIA vehicle. (3F) These limos will run you off the road if you try to
get into the area. (3G) To the north there is a launch site. (3H) There are two wrecked ships
there; they are 36 feet long with wings, and one can see oxygen and hydrogen tanks. The ships
that we got out of the trade are atomic-powered with plutonium pellets. Refueling of the
plutonium is accomplished at Los Alamos. (3I) The base has been there since 1948.

   Some of the disks are piloted by the NSA. (3J) The base is 4,000  feet long (3K) and
helicopters are going in and out of there all the time. When it became known that Bennewitz was
familiar with this, the mutilations in the area stopped. (3L) In 1979, something happened and the
base was temporarily closed. There was an argument over weapons and our people were chased
out. The aliens killed 66 of our people, and 44 got away.

   One of the people who in fact got away was a CIA agent who, before leaving, made some
notes, photos, and videotapes, and went into hiding. He has been in hiding ever since, and every
six months he contacts each of five people he left copies of the material with. His instructions
were that if he missed four successive contacts, the people could do whatever they want with the
material and was received in December, 1987, by many researchers. The "Dulce Papers" were
composed of 25 black and white photos, a videotape with no dialogue and a set of papers that
included technical information  regarding the jointly occupied (U.S.-Alien) facility one kilometer
beneath the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. (3M) The facility still exists and is
currently operational.

                                                * * *

Findings:

   (PHX-3A) Refer to (PHX-1A & 1B.

   (PHX-3B) Refer to (PHX-1A & 1B). There are no records, nor is there any physical evidence
to substantiate this allegation.

   (PHX-3C) The elevation at the location described, where Reservation Road J-2 crosses the
Navajo River, is not high enough to overlook the Town of Dulce. The road is not level and it
is not 36-feet wide. See Map Exhibit 2.

   (PHX-3D)  See (PHX-1D). The road is not level and it is not 36-feet wide. It is a narrow dirt
road that climbs, slowly, with many curves, around the base of Archuleta Mesa. See Photo
Exhibit 7.

   (PHX-3E)  Local residents and County highway maintenance crews have no memory of any
such trailers, buildings, domes or limousines in this area. Physical investigation reveals there is
no area where such structures ever existed.

   (PHX-3F)  The Rio Arriba County Sheriff's Office has no record of any reports, ever, having
been filed by motorists forced off the road by "any" type vehicle. As mentioned previously, this
is a Reservation Road used by the Indians, ranchers and the general public. If any occurrences,
such as those described ever occurred, it would have been the "talk-of-the-town." No residents
interviewed, remember any such events.

   (PHX-3G)  Physical investigation, on foot, failed to reveal any evidence of a "launch" site at
the location described.

   (PHX-3H) There are no physical indications of any kind, and there are no cleared areas of
sufficient size to provide space for two crashed ships or the oxygen and fuel tanks described.
This includes both sides of the road, all the way around the mesa. See Map Exhibit 3.

   (PHX-3I)  There are no indications of any such facilities. No one remembers any such
facilities. Such facilities are not there today.

   (PHX-3J) A complete examination of the area and the top of the mesa show no evidence of
any 4000 foot long cleared area. If such ever existed, scars in the landscape would still be
present. See Map Exhibit 3.

   (PHX-3K) Physical examination does not reveal past or present helicopter landing pads
anywhere in the area. Local residents do not remember any extensive helicopter activity, of any
kind, in the area.

   (PHX-3L) There is no record or local memory of any military presence, garrison, or troop
movements, past or present, in the Dulce area. Since there is only one major highway into and
out of Dulce, the presence of any military truck convoys or ambulances would not have gone un-
noticed by the local residents. And, as mentioned previously, there has never been any major
helicopter activity that could have brought in airborne troops.

   (PHX-3M) Contrary to the statements in the Krill2 information, there is no physical indication
of any installation in the Dulce area or in, around or underneath the Archuleta Mesa. Both ground
and aerial surveys do not indicate any suspicious terrain features.

   An airborne magnetometer survey of the described areas reveal no unusual underground
features that could be interpreted as a large underground base. If an underground base was
located 1-KM beneath the Archuleta Mesa, and it was 3-KM wide by 8-KM long, its presence
would be revealed by the magnetometer. Any underground facility of the size described would
be easily detected even if it was buried 5-KM below the mesa. It would be more than obvious.
It would "shout" its presence. The Magnetometer Contour Chart indicates no hidden underground
facility or any unusual excavations or caverns. See Exhibit-9.

   (4A)...numerous road blocks extend northward.  (4B) Maintained road some thirty feet wide
and servicing facilities, tanks, etc. There is also an apparent foundation for another helo
pad______ (4C) human housing, and another black limousine with tracks leading to it west of
the road.

   ...The total alien basing area apparently contains several cultures, (all under the designation
'unity') (4D) and is approx 3km wide by 8km long and is located in the middle of nowhere on
the Jicarilla Indian Reservation west of Dulce, NM.

   ...Based on the number of ships presently in this area, the total alien population is estimated
to be at least 2,000 and most likely more.

                                    ----- Logistical plans -----

   ...initial logistics would indicate a plan sequentially implemented as follows: This plan does
not include all requirements and preparatory safety measures to be employed by the ground force;
however, if Air Force Intelligence desires to pursue the approaches suggested in this report, each
significant requirement will be discussed in depth.

   (4E) The attack must be directed almost entirely on the ground since vehicle ignition problems
will be encountered. All electrical and electronic equipment must be 'hardened' using specific
techniques perfected prior to implementation. This information has been checked by interaction
and eavesdropping on their communication channels _______as far as weaknesses are concerned.
The program would be instigated in phases:

   (4F)
   1) The first procedure would be to close the gates of the dam above the Navajo River. This
dam could be held closed for the duration. Internal to the one cave, there is a small dam for
water storage. Its capacity is small.

   (4G) There is also a discharge outlet downstream that could be closed, causing waste water
to back up into the caves. The water is vacuum pumped apparently by some electrostatic means
from the river. (4H) There is a water intake and dam upstream that can be totally cut off and the
water re-routed to Chama, New Mexico.

                                               * * *

Findings:

   (PHX-4A)  There are no roadblocks on any roads in the Dulce Area. See Photo Exhibit 7, of
Reservation Road # J-2. There are no roadblocks present.  According to County Maintenance
Crews, the only time Road J-2 was blocked was years ago when it was "washed-out" by heavy
rains in the area.

   (PHX-4B)  Reservation Road # J-2, 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, is a narrow, winding, dirt
road. It does not match the description in the source information.

   (PHX-4C)  No such facilities exist. No one ever remembers the existence of any such
facilities.

   (PHX-4D)  Investigations on foot, by vehicle, and by aerial survey, show no evidence of
secret entrances to any facility or a base as large as the one described in the source information.

   (PHX-4E)  An Electro-Magnetic "spectrum sweep" of the Archuleta Mesa and the Town of
Dulce, revealed no unusual electromagnetic disturbances.  The entire area was surveyed by a
"Total Field" Magnetometer. No unusual magnetic disturbances were recorded.

   (PHX-4F)  There are no records of any "Dams" on the Navajo River anywhere near the Dulce
area or north of the Archuleta Mesa. The "Dam" described in the source information does not
exist.

   (PHX-4G)  An "on-foot" survey of the Navajo River did not reveal the existence of any
"discharge outlets" downstream. There is no evidence of any caves. The Indians interviewed did
not know of any caves, along the river, as described in the source information.

   (PHX-4H)  There is no "water intake" or "dam" upstream on the Navajo River. The lack of
any "dams" can be verified by consulting any topographical or aeronautical charts of the area.
Re-routing the Navajo River, by damming it, to Chama, New Mexico, as described by Bennewitz,
would be a miraculous feat. Chama, New Mexico is at an elevation of 8,025 feet above sea level,
as indicated by Aeronautical Chart # 45 dated July 25, 1991. Also noted, on this same chart, is
the elevation of Dulce as 6,800 feet above sea level. It would be a natural impossibility to have
the water of the Navajo River re-routed to Chama, as the water would have flow up-hill over the
Continental Divide that separates the two towns. The mountainous terrain ranges from 9,025 to
9,916 feet above sea level with no obvious gravitational advantages between the two towns. Such
an effort would require the installation on a monster pipeline and pumping station to accomplish
this. No such pipeline or pumping station has ever been built in this area.

Dulce, New Mexico...

                                               * * *

Findings:

   All of the previous "Findings" apply to this source information.

                                               * * *


                                            CONCLUSIONS:

   Information from many sources regarding the existence of an alleged U.S.\Alien Base at
Dulce, New Mexico, does not agree with the facts obtained by the investigation carried out by
The Phoenix Project. It would appear that the information describing this alleged U.S./Alien Base
and the numerous facilities associated with it, is entirely false. This would indicate deliberate
disinformation supplied to UFO investigators and all those interested in UFO research. It seems
that this disinformation is designed to mis-lead and mis-direct serious researchers away from the
truth. It seems incredible that serious UFO researchers and the UFO Movement, in general, could
accept the information regarding a large U.S.\Alien Base near Dulce, without making a detailed
and complete investigation.
   The facts revealed by the Phoenix Project investigation do not support the presence of a joint
U.S.\Alien base near Dulce -- and it is not in, around, or under the Archuleta Mesa. Perhaps there
is a such a base somewhere else on the Jicarilla Indian Reservation, but if that is true, it seems
strange that the Apaches, the local residents and the proper local authorities have no knowledge
of its presence or that such a base ever existed.

   From a practical stand-point, a base as large as the one described in the information supplied
by the sources quoted, along with a staff of 2000 aliens and their human co-workers, would need
to meet certain logistical requirements. Any sizeable joint U.S.\Alien base, located anywhere,
would need to meet the same requirements.

   1. The presence of a large, highly technical, human work-force.

   2. Support facilities for such a human work-force, i.e., housing, medical, recreational, service
and shopping, and service support facilities.

   3. There would obviously be work-shifts with workers coming and going at certain hours.
None of this activity could be totally concealed. This activity would be recognized by other
people in the area.

   4. Such a base would require operating supplies which would require incoming freight
shipments. Delivering such supplies would require delivery trucks or some form of air
transport. Such activity, on a regular basis, would not go un-noticed by local residents.

   5. If such a base existed, above ground or underground, there would need to be security
guards, fenced or controlled areas and regular perimeter patrols. A relationship with local law
enforcement officials would be required. The presence of such security forces and patrols would
not go un-noticed by residents in the area.

   6. Local authorities, i.e., city, county, and law enforcement, would know if such a base or
facility existed in their area.

   Please note.  None of the foregoing criteria exist, or have existed, in or around the Town of
Dulce or anywhere on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation. Nor do they exist in any other
"remote areas" where there are suspected U.S. or joint U.S\Alien bases. Thus, one can only
conclude that such bases cannot remain "hidden" in remote areas. Someone will always know or
remember that something strange is going-on in any remote area.

   Where then, should one look for such bases? The answer should be obvious. Such bases must
meet the requirements outlined previously. They are located in known areas which meet all the
logistical requirements. There are any number of government or military installations in New
Mexico that easily meet such requirements. However, gaining entry to such facilities, to prove
that such a base exists, would prove difficult if not impossible to any civilian researcher without
the proper credentials, security clearances and a "need-to-know."
