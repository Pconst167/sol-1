    Subj: NEW BOOK to be released in Aug 91! 

    I've told you all about meeting the lady that wrote the Crystal  Skull, 
    Alice Bryant..... 

    She has a new book that is due out Aug 1991,  called "Healing Shattered 
    Reality"   which  was written by her and her daughter,  Linda  Seebach.  
    Alice said that since she knew me and I've shared some of the things on 
    this  echo with her that she would give me an address for any of  those 
    who  would like to write her and she will be of as MUCH  assistance  as 
    possible.    She is working with a hynotherapist,  Melody,  which is  a 
    wonderful  person.   Alice has been undergoing hynotherapy because she, 
    herself  is  a  contactee.  Plus she is willing to give  all  of  us  a 
    discount on her book,  BUT you have to tell her you heard about it from 
    me... <I'm NOT making any money on this one either folks!> 

    On the ad about her book it says: 

    Healing Shattered Reality 
    Understanding Contactee Trauma 
    CONTACTEES 
    ABDUCTEES 
    MISSING TIME 
    INTERBREEDING 

    These  words are becoming household words in segments of  our  society.  
    Ordinary people are experiencing extraordinary things everyday! 

    Are their experiences real? 

    They believe it! 

    Their worlds crumble,  and many have no one to talk to!  Are you one of 
    these people?  Have you experienced something, but can't share it?  Are 
    you  totally absorbed in the UFO phenomenon?  Do you know someone whose 
    reality has been shattered? 

    This book is the definitive guide to understanding and coming to  grips 
    with the effects of alien contact. 

    for  the  victims,  and for those who work with them,  this book  is  a 
    guide, a tool sourse, and a becon of light. 

    Don't  miss this essential treament of today's most under-reported  and 
    misunderstood phenomenon! 

    Wildflower Press is the publisher....
