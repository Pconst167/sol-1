                         It's the story that won't die. 
                    A legion of UFO buffs is convinced that 
                        Wright-Patterson Air Force Base 
                                  is hiding...
    
                             ALIENS IN THE BASEMENT 
     
     
      The official fact sheet on 'Project Blue Book', the Air Force program 
    that investigated 12,000-plus unidentified flying object sightings from 
    1947 to 1969, reads like your standard military briefing paper -- until 
    the very end. Then it drops this incredible disclaimer:  "There are not 
    now,   nor  have  there ever been,  any  extraterrestrial  visitors  or 
    equipment on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base." 
     
      Little  alien corpses kept frozen and hidden away on an Ohio military 
    base may sound like sci-fi lunacy to the uninitiated. But for 45 years, 
    this  is  one UFO story that's refused to go away.  And  for  that  the 
    military has mostly itself to blame.  It was,  after all,  Roswell Army 
    Air  Field in New Mexico that started the whole business in the  summer 
    of 1947 by announcing that it had recovered a crashed "flying disc". 
     
      Never mind that they were quick to say, No, wait, make that a weather 
    balloon.  Over the last decade in particular, a  small army of authors, 
    researchers,   and  TV hucksters has done a highly imaginative  job  of 
    filling  in the details of the "Roswell Incident,"  as it's come to  be 
    known.   Unlike  most  UFO yarns,  their stories are  based  on  enough 
    interviews,   photographs,   and other evidence  to  seem...well,   not 
    impossible. 
      
      Ultimately all the stories lead to Wright-Patterson, the headquarters 
    of 'Project Blue Book' and the site where the wreckage of the spaceship 
    and the bodies of its crew were allegedly taken for analysis. Then they 
    come to an abrupt halt. "We know the material was taken to Wright-Pat," 
    Mark Rodeghier of the J.  Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies says. "But 
    that's  where  the  trail grows very cold:  we don't have  any  sources 
    there." 
     
      That's enough to get the gears of any redblooded space writer racing. 
    What  if  I  could spend some time poking around the  labs  at  Wright-
    Patterson?  There's no telling what I might find. Admittedly,  the odds 
    of  actually coming back with the goods are slim.  But as longtime  UFO 
    investigator  Don  Berliner points out,  "It's potentially the  biggest 
    story ever." 
     
      My first contact with the base public relations staff makes me  think 
    I might be on to something.  "The little green men story?  I  get three 
    calls  a  week about it,"  says Major Aurelia Blake.   She  assures  me 
    there's  no crashed saucer or alien corpses under wraps,  but says  I'm 
    welcome to tour the base.  A few hours later, however,  she calls back. 
    "Why don't you think about doing something else?", she asks. "We've got 
    some great wind tunnels here." 
     
      The  Roswell  Incident dovetails with the birth of the modern era  of 
    flying  saucers,  so named in June 1947  when a private pilot  reported 
    seeing  nine  disc-shaped objects flying over Washington's Mt.   Ranier 
    "like saucers skipping on water."  That sighting triggered a nationwide 
    wave of UFO reports that made headlines for months afterwards. 
     
      Far  and away the wildest headlines came out of Roswell,   where  two 
    weeks  after the Mt.  Ranier sightings a sheep farmer named Mac  Brazel 
    clumped  into  the  sheriff's office to report  something  he  couldn't 
    identify cluttering one of his fields --  something, he said,  that had 
    fallen out of the sky and broken into shiny pieces. 
     
      Brazel's  ranch  lay some 75  miles northwest of Roswell near a  tiny 
    town called Corona, in a stretch of scrub desert neatly triangulated by 
    what  were  then  arguably the three most  security-sensitive  military 
    installations  in the world:  the Roswell Army Air Field,  home of  the 
    509th Bomb Group,  the world's only atomic bomb squadron;  Los  Alamos, 
    where the bomb had been developed and was still being refined;  and the 
    White  Sands Missile Range.  Not surprisingly,  Sheriff  George  Wilcox 
    suggested  that  Brazel  report his find to authorities at  the  nearby 
    Roswell base. 
     
      After  sending  two officers out to reconnoiter the  crash  site  and 
    retrieve some samples, the 509th brass went ballistic, mounting a full-
    scale  recovery effort and firing off its "flying disc"  press release. 
    On  Tuesday,  July 8,  newspapers across the country carried  headlines 
    announcing that Roswell Army Air Field had captured a flying saucer. 
     
      The next day, though,  many carried a follow-up story explaining that 
    the  wreckage wasn't a flying saucer after all.  After being  flown  to 
    Fort  Worth  Army  Air Field,  it was identified as the  remains  of  a 
    weather balloon. An Associated Press wire story that ran in a number of 
    papers on July 9 described the wreckage as "consisting of large numbers 
    of  pieces  of  paper covered with a foil-like substance,   and  pieced 
    together  with  small sticks,  much like a kite.   Scattered  with  the 
    materials  over  an area about 200  yards across were  pieces  of  gray 
    rubber." 
     
      Before my trip to Wright-Patterson,  I tracked down Walter Haut,  the 
    retired  base  public information officer who wrote the infamous  press 
    release, and asked him if he ever actually saw the wreckage. "No, and I 
    feel like an idiot every time somebody asks me that," he said ruefully. 
    "I got a call from the base commander,  who basically dictated what was 
    in the press release." 
     
      And  how  did he feel when the bottom dropped out of the  story?   "I 
    probably  wiped the perspiration from my brow and said Thank  Goodness, 
    we're  of  the hook now,"  he said.  "Very frankly,  I  don't  think  I 
    believed  that we had something from outer space.  I  think most of  us 
    felt we were being hoodwinked somewhere down the pike." 
     
      This is not,  incidentally,  what Haut believes today.  "I feel there 
    was  a  crash  of an extraterrestrial vehicle near  Corona,"   he  says 
    firmly. What happened in the intervening 45 years to change his mind? 
     
      For a long time, not much. Nobody questioned the military in 1947, so 
    when  the  captured  disc metamorphosed into a  weather  balloon,   the 
    explanation  was  accepted and the story largely forgotten.  It  was  a 
    revival  of  the  Roswell  story in the '70s that  convinced  Haut  and 
    thousands of others that the Air Force really hadn't been on the up and 
    up.   It  began  inauspiciously in the person of Stanton  Friedman,   a 
    nuclear  physicist  and  well-traveled  UFO lecturer.   At  his  talks, 
    Friedman  would occasionally meet people who had been in New Mexico  in 
    1947.   Bit by bit,  their stories began to form a picture  startlingly 
    different  from the official version's.  Friedman dug further with  the 
    help  of a friend,  William Moore,  who in turn enlisted writer Charles 
    Berlitz  of  Bermuda Triangle fame to turn their findings into  a  book 
    published in 1980 called 'The Roswell Incident'. 
     
      The  book  blows  off the weather balloon explanation  as  a  hastily 
    concocted cover story and argues that the Air Force really did  recover 
    a  crashed saucer,  as well as several alien bodies.  The wreckage  and 
    bodies  were  taken  to Wright-Patterson for analysis,  it  said,   and 
    everyone involved in collecting, transporting, and studying them became 
    part of a massive conspiracy of silence. There's a lot of chaff in 'The 
    Roswell Incident', including some blatant hokum about Gemini and Apollo 
    astronauts  spotting  flying saucers.  But the main idea --   that  the 
    government  was sitting on a captured saucer --  fell on  some  fertile 
    ground.   Other  books followed,  including last year's 'UFO  Crash  at 
    Roswell'.   Television  found the story irresistible.  The  series  'In 
    Search Of'  did an episode on it. A trashy 1988  production called 'UFO 
    Cover-up?   Live'  featured two mysterious "intelligence sources"   who 
    revealed that the captured aliens like Tibetan music and strawberry ice 
    cream.  And in September 1989, 'Unsolved Mysteries'  featured the story 
    on its season premiere, attracting an impressive 28 million viewers. 
     
      The  captured saucer idea even took root overseas.  "I  was  visiting 
    Kapustin Yar, a Soviet missile base, two years ago when the head of the 
    base asked me if we had any UFOs,"  recalls Gregg Herken,  chairman  of 
    the  National Air and Space Museum's department of space  history.   "I 
    thought  he  was  kidding  at first,  but he turned  out  to  be  quite 
    serious." 
     
      It's  a good thing the Soviet commander never saw the UFO exhibit  in 
    the  world-famous  United States Air Force Museum adjacent  to  Wright-
    Patterson,   which  the PR staff had encouraged me to check out  before 
    coming to the base.  It turns out to be a single glass case filled with 
    fake photos and hoax items that wouldn't cut it on the old Flash Gordon 
    serials.  A  blob of melted plastic, a big hunk of cinder,  a  crumpled 
    metal ball stuffed with radio tubes, springs,  and speedometer cable -- 
    this is it?  An Air Force museum so comprehensive it has a wall covered 
    with  the history of spark plugs , and there's nothing to show  for  23 
    years of UFO investigations but a pile of rusty junk? Very odd. 
     
      On  to  the base itself,  a  vast tract bigger than half of  Dayton's 
    suburbs. An alien rescue team could search the place for six months and 
    not  find  their friends.  But I know where to look.  One place is  the 
    infamous  Hangar  18,  where the bodies were allegedly stored  in  deep 
    freeze.   Another  is  Wright  Laboratory,   one  of  four  Air   Force 
    "superlabs,"  where nearly $1  billion is spent annually on research in 
    propulsion and power, avionics, materials, electronics, and the like. 
     
      If they learned anything from the saucer, there should be signs of it 
    in  the labs.  I  also,  want to see the Foreign Aerospace Science  and 
    Technology Center,  the secret facility where the Air Force takes apart 
    foreign aircraft to see what makes them tick. 
     
      The  first  thing I learn is that there is no Hanger 18.   There's  a 
    Building  18  complex that at one time housed "cold cells,"  rooms that 
    could  be cooled to sub-zero temperatures to test engines under  Arctic 
    conditions.   In 18A I meet Fred Oliver,  a  folksy division chief  and 
    engineer who's become the base spokesman on the subject of aliens.   He 
    commiserates with me in my disappointment at finding generic government 
    offices. "I know," he says, "you picture walking into a building with a 
    big curved top where you go through all these guards, and run your card 
    through a cipher lock, then there's this spaceship going 'rrrrr, rrrrr' 
    that gives off a green glow." 
     
      Exactly.   How does he know that scene in such detail?  Before I  can 
    ask,   he's deep into a Viewgraph briefing.  You can't meet anybody  at 
    Wright-Patterson   without  getting  a  Viewgraph  briefing;   it's  as 
    automatic as a handshake.  It's also a lot like the lessons you used to 
    get  in  high school on overhead projectors,  except  that  instead  of 
    scrawled  equations or French verb conjugations you get to look at  big 
    bright  slides  of organization charts and  turbine  engines.   Finally 
    Oliver  works  his way to the bottom of a six-inch stack of slides  and 
    asks, "Any questions?" 
     
     "Where are the bodies?" 
     
      "There are no bodies,"  he says kindly,  like a dad breaking the  bad 
    news  about the tooth fairy.  But if a saucer did crash-land,  wouldn't 
    the remains be at Wright-Patterson? "That's a sensible conclusion,"  he 
    admits. "Since the beginning of time, this has been the nation's center 
    of aerospace R&D." 
     
      I suggest that a good strategy for hiding aliens might be to act like 
    you've  got nothing to hide,  bring reporters on base,  then  overwhelm 
    them  with Viewgraphs.  "And walk them till they drop,"  Oliver agrees. 
    "I'm going to get in trouble for saying this, but give us some credit -
    -   wouldn't you think we'd be smart enough to hide the bodies if  they 
    were here? Do you really think you'd get to see them?" 
     
      In any case, after a tour of the Building 18 complex,  it's clear I'm 
    not going to see them there.  The cold cells are long gone,  gutted and 
    replaced  with  recon-camera maintenance and repair shops  and  testing 
    equipment.   The  basement  of 18A has a huge facility  that  can  pump 
    pressure-  and temperature-controlled air to a number of "environmental 
    chambers,"    but  there's  nothing  resembling  a  24-hour   cryogenic 
    operation. If the bodies were here, they're gone now. 
     
      My  next interview is with Keith Richey,  chief scientist  of  Wright 
    Laboratory.   The determined set of his face tells me he obviously  has 
    better things to do with his time that talk about aliens.  "Do you have 
    the  Air Force fact sheet on Project Blue Book?"  he asks as soon as  I 
    broach the subject.  "My own personal knowledge corroborates that.   So 
    that's where we are on that subject." 
     
      Richey  has  fascinating  tales  to tell of running  a  superlab  and 
    developing the kind of weaponry we saw in Desert Storm and how we'll be 
    able  to  launch  the next generation of smart bombs from  hundreds  of 
    miles  away  instead of just a few and still park  them  up  somebody's 
    keister.  Eventually I steer the conversation back to aerodynamics  and 
    ask how efficient a saucer shape would be for flying. 
     
      "Well,  it's not very efficient,"  Richey says.  "What you want is  a 
    multiplication factor of 20  times the lift for the amount of drag  you 
    generate, and it doesn't generate much lift." 
     
      I  try  a different tack.  What if something dropped out of  the  sky 
    tomorrow  and  was  brought to Wright Laboratory for  analysis?   Could 
    Richey and his 2,000  scientists and engineers figure out what makes it 
    go? 
     
      "We could do it,"  he says, pride getting the best of his no-nonsense 
    demeanor.   "We could take it apart,  analyze it,  and I don't know how 
    long  it would take,  but with enough effort we could find out what  it 
    would  do."   So  presumably if a saucer had shown up at  the  base  in 
    '47...?  Richey doesn't hesitate.  "You would have seen it flying.  You 
    would probably be buying tickets for it by now." 
     
      Before I can weigh the implications of that remark,  I'm hustled  off 
    to  the  Flight Dynamics lab for a Viewgraph briefing by  Colonel  Dick 
    Borowski. A congenial fighter pilot who saw action in Vietnam, Borowski 
    smiles and says,  "I know you came looking for little green men,"  then 
    unleashes  a dazzling overview of the new technologies his division  is 
    developing.  Acoustic's testing.  Thermoplastics.  Forebody vortex flow 
    control. Flight simulation. By the time he's done, I'm too dazed to ask 
    him where he's hiding the bodies. 
     
      My  pulse quickens as I'm led down a maze of hallways and  through  a 
    heavily locked door by Richard Moss,  chief of cockpit development.  No 
    bodies  in  the inner sanctum,  though --  just a series of rooms  with 
    liquid  crystal display screens in various test stages.  The first  one 
    shows  a simplistic terrain with targets in the air and on the  ground, 
    all irritatingly out of focus. "Here, put these on," a technician says, 
    handing me a pair of Captain Video sunglasses with tiny on/off  buttons 
    on the frames. 
     
      "Are these a souvenir?" I ask her. 
     
      She laughs. "Those cost $2,000." 
      
      I look at the screen,  where suddenly everything is not only in focus 
    but in 3D. There's a truck in the forefront, then some mountains,  then 
    -- wait a minute! A saucer-shaped object is hovering in the sky. 
     
      "That's a flying saucer," I tell the tech excitedly. 
     
      She squints at the screen.  "The red thing?  I  don't know what  that 
    is." She looks at Moss. 
     
      "That's a transport aircraft," he says. 
     
      There's more rooms and more screens,  but I'm too preoccupied to  pay 
    attention.  When Moss finally escorts me from the building, he gives me 
    a meaningful look and says, "You've only seen the tip of the iceberg." 
     
      I  start  my second day at Wright-Patterson in  the  museum  research 
    library,   hoping to find the original Roswell documents that will  cut 
    through  some of the hype.  When I tell the librarian what I'm  looking 
    for,  he gets a pained look and barks, "Every time they run that damned 
    Roswell  thing  in the tabloids all the crazies come out.  The old  man 
    [museum  director  Richard Uppstrom] says he wishes we had one  of  the 
    bodies  to put downstairs and charge a dollar a pop to see.  We'd never 
    have to ask Congress for money again." 
     
      Disappointingly, the museum's UFO files are in the same league as its 
    UFO  exhibit.   There's a ton of Blue Book summary reports  along  with 
    University  of  Colorado  and  National  Academy  of  Sciences  studies 
    agreeing with the Air Force's conclusion that UFOs don't merit  serious 
    attention.  There's a detailed aerodynamic analysis of virtually  every 
    shape UFOs have ever taken,  pronouncing them all "impracticable."  And 
    in year after year of briefing papers, there are remarks like this one: 
    "It is unlikely that positive proof of [flying saucers] existence  will 
    be obtained without examination of the remains of crashed objects." 
     
      Exactly. 
     
      This afternoon's lab run is through the materials directorate,  where 
    after the obligatory Snoozegraph briefing I'm handed off to  Lieutenant 
    Colonel James Hansen.  He's got a basement full of wild machinery  that 
    tests  composite metals and ceramics for the National Aerospace  Plane, 
    the hypersonic hybrid that will fly into space. 
     
      No  bodies here either.  But watching strips of exotic  metals  being 
    tortured under incredible heat and pressure,  I  realize I may be a lot 
    closer  to pieces of a crashed saucer than I think.  I  ask Hansen  the 
    same  question I asked Richey yesterday about analyzing something  that 
    dropped out of the sky -- only this time in the past tense. 
     
      "If  somebody  had brought in composite material 20  years  ago,   we 
    wouldn't have had any idea what it was," he admits. "Now, we could take 
    it apart down to its atoms."  Suddenly it all begins to add up --   the 
    glowing spaceship scene Oliver described,  Richey's cryptic boast about 
    selling tickets,  the saucer on the screen,  and now Hansen's admission 
    that we've only recently been able to figure out composites. It's taken 
    nearly 40 years to crack the secrets of the Roswell wreckage. 
      
      And  today  we're developing a freak craft that can take off  from  a 
    runway and fly into space -- just like flying saucers do. 
     
      Coincidence? Think about it. 
     
      My  last  shot  at  finding the bodies is  the  super-secret  Foreign 
    Technology  center.  It took negotiations on the order of a Middle East 
    peace  conference to get an appointment there,  and I'm pleased to  see 
    that  the public information officer waiting for me is a novice filling 
    in for someone who just quit. No telling where she might take me. 
     
      We  drive around the building first.  It's a nondescript red and gray 
    affair,   like a warehouse in a suburban industrial park,  only  a  lot 
    bigger.   My guide confides that you need top-secret clearance  to  get 
    almost anywhere inside. "It's basically a huge safe," she says. 
     
      We park at the front entrance,  greet an officer on the way out,  and 
    step into what might be the lobby of Krupp's Widget Works -- except for 
    the heavy-duty security desk with the big control panel.  I  look at my 
    guide and make an expectant move toward the desk. She doesn't budge. 
     
      "That's it," she says. 
     
      "That's it?" 
     
      "That's all you can see." 
     
      And that's that. 
     
      No flying saucer story would be complete without an anonymous  highly 
    placed military source who spills A Big Secret. Mine didn't materialize 
    until  I got back to Washington,  where I brooded for days over what  I 
    had seen -- or hadn't seen, actually. 
     
      Studying  a  map of New Mexico got me thinking about all  the  secret 
    flying  and  testing that was done at Roswell and Los Alamos and  White 
    Sands  after  the war.  If there was ever a place where  something  the 
    military  wanted kept under wraps was likely to fall from the sky,   it 
    was  central  New Mexico in 1947.  That thought prompted me to call  my 
    source  --   a  retired Air Force officer I met while  touring  Wright-
    Patterson who is,  alas,  still in a position to sensitive to allow his 
    name to be used. He was way ahead of me. 
     
      "All  these years I've been hearing about this Roswell incident,"  he 
    said,  "and knowing Air Force history like I do,  and how hush-hush the 
    509th was, I  just set it in my mind that they must have crashed with a 
    nuke that came close to going off,  or maybe [exploded but with] a low-
    level yield that we don't know about. I  could never prove anything one 
    way  or another.  But with the 509th that close,  and --  well,   B-29s 
    weren't noted for not crashing, let's put it that way." 
     
      It's  a  nifty  theory,  but just a theory.  Like all  good  stories, 
    Roswell  expands  to accommodate whatever you bring to it.  That's  the 
    nature  of myths and legends --  they're detailed enough to seem  real, 
    yet  fuzzy  enough  to stay always just beyond the reach  of  objective 
    proof. 
     
      In that sense, it was better that I didn't find any bodies. Naturally 
    I'm  disappointed  at not having broken the biggest story of all  time. 
    But I've done my part for the legend. Substantive or not, Roswell grows 
    a little with each retelling.  And this one lets you have it both ways. 
    If you prefer a purely rational, scientific world, you can take comfort 
    in  the  fact that my mission was --  just as you knew it would  be  -- 
    doomed to failure. 
     
      If  you  prefer a world filled with mystery and intrigue,   well,   I 
    haven't  disturbed  that either.  The Air Force is still covering up  a 
    big-time  screw-up...or  just now cracking the secret  of  interstellar 
    propulsion...or  sitting on the biggest cosmic kick in the pants  since 
    the Big Bang. 
     
     Whatever.
