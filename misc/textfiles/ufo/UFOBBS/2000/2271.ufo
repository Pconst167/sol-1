     World renowned UFO researcher Jacques Vallee has repeatedly
referred to the similarities between UFO and abduction reports and the
stories of folklore and fairy tales.  I disagree with Dr. Vallee on
many, many points of UFOlogy, but here I will grant that there is one
fairy tale which does have something important to tell us about the
alien abduction phenomenon.  It is not, however, what Dr. Vallee might
think.
     The story of Hansel and Gretel presents a lesson that every
abductee should heed.  These innocent children, wandering lost and
frightened in the forest, came upon a gingerbread house that seemed to
offer them shelter and sustenance.  The owner of the house, a wizened
old woman, was frightening to them at first, but their hunger pushed the
children to accept her offer to come inside and be fed.
     And so they entered the gingerbread house and promptly became the
old woman's captives.  Kept in cages, the two children were abundantly
fed.  It was not for their benefit, though.  In fact, they were being
fattened up for the oven!  The deceptive nature of the gingerbread house
and of the old woman's offer of food worked quite well.
     It is the deceptive quality of this story that holds a warning for
humans who are abducted by aliens.  Like Hansel and Gretel, we are
initially terrified by our encounter with aliens, but in too many cases,
our fear is overcome by the words of our abductors and by the thoughts
and experiences they present to us.
     I, too, am an abductee, and my quest to discover the nature of my
own experiences led me into abduction research over the past four years.
Working with many other abduction cases, I have learned just how basic
the deception of alien actions can be.
     My family and I also delved into our own experiences, both past and
present.  Barbara Bartholic, a dedicated UFO investigator from Tulsa,
Oklahoma, worked closely with us and helped us fill in the gaps in our
recollections of strange encounters through hypnotic regression.  Ms.
Bartholic, by the way, began her own research as an assistant to Jacques
Vallee in cattle mutilation investigations, so her expertise in ufology
is wide-ranging.  I have recently written a book, Into the Fringe, about
the startling and often disturbing results of our personal
investigations, and it will be published by the Berkley Publishing Group
in November 1992.
     But my interest soon expanded past the merely personal, and for the
past several years I have worked as Ms. Bartholic's research associate,
exploring literally hundreds of sighting and encounter cases with her.
And what I've learned through this work has raised far more questions
than answers.  In fact, it has taught me to be wary of those researchers
who do claim to have answers.  I have yet to hear of a single theory or
explanation that accounts for all of the data.
     Some researchers have pointed out patterns of events in the
abduction experience, such as the physical examination, the taking of
sperm and ova, and the later presentation of a hybrid baby to the
abductee.  Other patterns include the training of the abductee in some
way and the delivery of a warning of some upcoming global disaster.
Yes, these events are frequently reported, as one researcher has said in
boringly repetitious accounts, and it is tempting to think that the
explanation for alien abductions may lie in these patterns.
     So the researchers announce that the problem is solved.  The aliens
are doing cross-breeding experiments, UFOlogists tell us. Never mind the
overwhelming evidence against the viable commingling of different
species.  Or, we are told, the aliens are here to save us from
destroying ourselves and our planet through violence, drug use, epidemic
disease, pollution, and resource depletion.  Never mind that these
problems have grown worse, not better, since the ETs began visiting us.
     Or, most infuriating of all, we are assured that there are no
actual aliens, that our experiences spring from our own subconscious
turmoil or from our need for fantasy fulfillment. Never mind that many
abductees are young children, too young to be suffering from such
psychological disturbances.  Well, then, the resourceful researcher
counters, the imagined aliens must spring from some collective human
super-psyche that is mirroring our failures and dangers back to us.
This particular theory adores the archetypal gray ET, because it
resembles some sickly fetal form of humanity and must therefore be an
objectified warning of what our species is in danger of becoming if we
don't mend our ways.  Never mind that many, many abductees have no
dealing with grays, but instead are victimized by robust reptoids and
insectoids.  Not to mention the totally human-looking blond beauties and
black-headed, black-robed clan with the widow's peak hairline.
     No, too many researchers seem to find a theory and cling to it in
spite of data that contradict it.  And it is the ideas of these
researchers that dominate ufology.  But if the public had access to the
raw data, to the first-hand reports of abductees, especially those
unfamiliar with UFO-oriented books, magazines, and lecturers, they would
find a much less neatly organized set of patterns.  These "virgin"
cases--people uncontaminated by ufological literature--supply a
staggering picture of human-alien contact events.
     What follows here is an overview of these "virgin" reports, a list
of recurrent experiences that taken together gives us a close-up view of
what the aliens are doing here on earth.  This data doesn't tell us for
certain just what sort of creatures the aliens are, or what their
purpose here may be.  But it does tell us what humans are experiencing
and what they are observing in the actions and capabilities of the
aliens.  Every detail in the following list has been reported by more
than one abductee, and in many cases the details have turned up quite
frequently.

ABDUCTION "CHECKLIST".

     If these reports can be believed--and there is no reason to doubt
the honesty of the reporters--the abduction phenomenon includes the
following details.

     --   Aliens can alter our perception of our surroundings.

     --   Aliens can control what we think we see.  They can appear to
us in any number of guises, and shapes.

     --   Aliens can take us--our consciousness--out of our physical
bodies, disable our control of our bodies, install one of their own
entities, and use our bodies as vehicles for their own activities before
returning our consciousness to our bodies.
