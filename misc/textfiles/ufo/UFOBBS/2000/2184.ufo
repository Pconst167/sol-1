                                                                National

                                                                Museum

        A museum of UFOs had been a dream of UFOlogist for years. Now it is
becoming a reality.

        The NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM is a project to educate the public about all
aspects of the UFO phenomenon, and is slated to open its doors to the public
April 1991, in the popular resort city of Reno, Nevada. It will be the world's
largest repository of evidence of UFOs, including photos, documents, artifacts
and displays. There will be extensive archives and exhibits on such
controversial topics as flying saucers and the beings who control them, crash
sites, government coverups, hidden alien bases and other subjects of interest
to UFO buffs and the general public.

        In addition to the public exhibits the NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM will also
feature a bookstore and gift shop specializing in UFOlogy publications and
products.

        The NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM will also have a research department doing
original investigation into UFOs, and producing its own books and literature.

        The NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM will have a very modest general admission, as
its mission is to present UFO data to the world.  A range of supportive
membership levels are also available for the more active UFOlogist.
Membership would include discounts on admission and bookstore items, as well
as a subscription to the NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM'S newsletter.

      For more information contact Jerry E. Smith, Executive Director.

        NATIONAL UFO MUSEUM, P.O. Box 20593, Sun Valley, NV 89433




(Note: There was another flyer with basically the same info, but it request
that you send $2.00 for "additional information, which includes exciting news
updates on UFOs and the extraterrestial presence on Earth".)
