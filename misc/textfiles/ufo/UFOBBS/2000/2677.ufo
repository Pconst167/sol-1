SUBJECT: AM I IMAGINING IT ALL ?                             FILE: UFO2677




        
    Am I Imagining It All? 
     
      "...there  will be wonder.  There will be great wonder."  These  words, 
    written  by Whitley Strieber in the foreword of his book  Transformation, 
    have for me, become the most profound words that I have ever come across. 
    They  are at once extremely descriptive of the entire UFO enigma and yet, 
    they  are very richly understated.  To wonder is to contemplate something 
    that  at  the very least has some basis for understanding  in  the  human 
    mind.   But,   it  is  becoming increasingly clear,   as  more  and  more 
    information  is  obtained  from UFO  sightings  and  proported  abduction 
    victims   that   much  of  the  phenomenon  is  probably   beyond   Man's 
    comprehension. Therefore, to wonder is to digress from fact into fantasy. 
    But, one cannot help but wonder. So how are we to get to the true meaning 
    of the enigma?  There seems, at this point,  to be no clear path to truth 
    ahead  of those who study this peculiar subject.  About all anyone can do 
    is  to  add  as much information as possible to the  files  of  dedicated 
    research  organizations attempting to put all of the bizarre  tales  into 
    some some kind of rational perspective. These files are already so loaded 
    with  obscure  symbolism  and  strange  occurrences,   that  their   real 
    underlying meanings may never be obtained.  In writing this, I presuppose 
    that  UFOs  exist,   that  they are indeed a  physical  reality  and  not 
    halluclnatory  in  nature,   that they are  piloted  by  extraterrestrial 
    entities,   and  that  these entities have engaged in the  abduction  and 
    examination  of  many human individuals.  The question of  existence  has 
    never been an issue for me. I have always accepted as fact that UFOs were 
    a reality. As far back as I can remember, I have held a major interest in 
    the phenomenon.  Recently, I  ran across newspaper clippings dated as far 
    back  as  1978  that I had collected pertaining to various  sightings  of 
    strange craft, which demonstrates that even at age 14, I was keenly aware 
    that something strange was happening.  In those days though,  as far as I 
    was concerned, UFOs were strange flying craft that people saw in the sky, 
    although  I do not remember ever having personally seen an object that  I 
    could  truly  consider to be extraterrestrial.  Abduction  accounts  were 
    virtually  unheard of,  or at least they were not reported by  any  media 
    available  to  me other than in the grocery store tabloids that  everyone 
    denies  reading.  In fact,  I  do not recall reading one in-depth  "alien 
    encounter" report until I was in my early twenties. I had heard the names 
    Travis  Walton and Betty Andreasson a few times,  but I had no access  to 
    details  of these cases.  It was not until late 1989,  at age 25,  that I 
    began to suspect my own possible abduction.  This "wondering"  began on a 
    trip  to a bookstore where I was scanning a totally unrelated section  of 
    books for something interesting to read.  Suddenly,  I  came to an out of 
    place book entitled Intruders. The name was all I saw on the spine, but l 
    immediately  knew what this book was about.  Without checking to see if I 
    was correct in my assumption I grabbed the book and bought it. It was all 
    I  could  do to wait until 1 got home to start reading it.  While  I  was 
    engrossed in the manuscript I recalled a dream that I had as a child.  It 
    was a horrifing dream that has recurred several times throughout my life. 
    What  I remember of it seems to fit perfectly into the classic  abduction 
    scenario. 
     
      Am Iying in bed asleep.  For reasons unclear I wake up and peer through 
    the doorway of my room.  I  think I see some small men looking back at me 
    from around another doorway very close to my own. I get up to investigate 
    and walk toward them down the hall. I  do not get very far when I seem to 
    remember  several others coming toward me.  At this point I  become  very 
    frightened and turn to run back to my bedroom.  I take about one step and 
    am frozen in my tracks. I could not move a muscle.  This was not the "run 
    in slow motion but can't get away"  dream. I  was totally immobilized and 
    felt a very strange tingling sensation,  which I will never forget. I can 
    equate it a low level electrical vibration,  like when you touch the ends 
    of  a  cord as you plug it into the wall socket,  only not as strong.   I 
    remember screaming for my mother and father to help me.  Whether anything 
    came out of my mouth or no one heard me,  I don't know.  At this point my 
    back was turned to whatever was pursuing me. Then, my legs began to float 
    up and I tilted face down and began to float.  I  do not recall  anything 
    after this point.  I can remember, as a child, being absolutely terrified 
    to go down the hall to my room by myself,  especially at night.  I  would 
    even  go so far as to try to con my brother to go with me,   telling  him 
    that I wanted to show him something or that I wanted to play with him.  I 
    also had a fear of looking out of the sliding glass doors that led out to 
    the backyard at night,  for fear that someone would be out there  looking 
    back at me.  These fears persisted way up into my teens. In fact, I still 
    find  myself  hugging the walls in my present house,  stealthily  walking 
    along wondering if someone is in the house when I know good and well that 
    there  is'nt.   Another incident that I recalled while reading  Intruders 
    pertained to a possible visual sighting that occurred when I was a  young 
    boy.   My  cousins and I were playing outside while my father  and  uncle 
    talked nearby. Suddenly, for some inexplicable reason, I looked to a spot 
    in  the  sky  and  detected a very small  stationary  object  that  shown 
    brightly  with reflected sunlight.  It seems miraculous to me now that  I 
    could  have  spotted the object,  knowing how scatter-brained young  boys 
    are.   I   called to the others to see and we watched it for  some  time, 
    although  it  made no movement.  Upon asking my father and uncle what  it 
    was, I remember my uncle getting out his binoculars and taking a look.  I 
    am  sure that my father also observed the object through the  binoculars. 
    Although  they  could  not  confirm the identity  of  the  object,   they 
    determined  that it must be a weather balloon.  We accepted this and went 
    about our daily romp sessions without further discussion of the matter. I 
    hadn't  given  this incident any thought at all until reading  Intruders, 
    some twenty years later,  at which point the occurrence came rushing back 
    into  my mind with utmost clarity.  I  also recalled during this  time  a 
    missing  time incident that occurred when I was a senior in high  school. 
    At  the  time,  I  was having trouble with a spastic colon and was on  an 
    anti-    spasmodic  drug  called  Bentyl.   Although  this  may  hurt  my 
    credibility,   I  ingested a rather large amount of this drug  during  my 
    second to last class one day.  I really don't know why I did this,  but I 
    did.   I  remember going to my last class feeling very groggy and falling 
    asleep.   When  the  bell rang I was almost unable to  walk  or  function 
    normally but managed to get to the door leading outside to my car.   This 
    was  around 2:30  to 3:00  p.m.  The next thing I remember is  waking  up 
    around 6:00 p.m. at home in my bed to my mother asking me to move my car. 
    This was an incredibly difficult task in my condition.  I  cannot believe 
    that no one noticed that I was so doped up. The thing I find so difficult 
    to  grasp,  given that this was a drug induced blackout,  is that in this 
    condition, I would have had to get into my car at the school, drive about 
    3  miles in heavy traffic to my job, perform my duties,  drive to another 
    location to finish and then drive home. This is almost too much for me to 
    accept.   I  seem to remember asking my co-workers the next day about  my 
    performance but not getting any satisfactory answers as to whether I  did 
    my job or whether I was even there to do it.  This event gradually  faded 
    from memory and I had not thought about it again until I read Intruders. 
     
      The  next  book I read was Communion.  I  obtained it  from  the  local 
    library  and  was  dumbfounded  that it would even  have  this  book.   I 
    concealed it as I walked up to the check-  out counter for fear of  being 
    seen  with it and made fun of.  I  had heard about the book but had never 
    seen  it before.  When I picked it off the shelf and saw the cover I  was 
    immediately  stunned by the artwork and a thought ran through my mind-the 
    image on my door.  On the back of the door to the room in which I had the 
    dream about the little men, there was an image formed by the grain of the 
    wood that I used to call "the devil on my door". I remember showing it to 
    all  my friends and even my mother,  although she has no recollection  of 
    it. It seemed to be an elongated face with slanted eyes and an evil look. 
    The face on Communion seemed to spark some kind of correlation. It was my 
    immediate  thought that they were different renderings of the same thing. 
    I  remember  many times opening my door because I didn't want  it  to  be 
    looking at me. A very strange thing for a child to think about a piece of 
    wood.   Communion  elicited  the  same memories from  my  childhood  that 
    Intruders  did.   I  began to play "connect the dots"  and things  became 
    clearer that I may have had my own possible abduction experiences.  After 
    this,  I  began reading everything that I could get my hands on about the 
    subject,  trying desperately to find some confirmation of the things that 
    I had experienced. I now understand that this is a quite common phase for 
    abductees/contactees  to  go through.  During this time  of  "information 
    gathering" I had some very vivid dreams.  These dreams that I will relate 
    to  you seemed very different from my normal dream state.  In  fact  they 
    seemed  very  real.  The thing that puzzles me is that unlike  my  normal 
    dreams  where  I  seem to be fully conscious and in  control,   in  these 
    "abduction"  dreams I felt as though I was not fully conscious or perhaps 
    groggy from some narcotic.  The first of these came on March 26, 1990.  I 
    distinctly  remember  the date because I awoke the next  morning  telling 
    myself  that I had to remember that day so I could relate it  later.   It 
    begins  this  way.  When I become aware of something  happening,   I   am 
    standing  beside  my  bed buttoning my red and black  flannel  shirt.   I 
    already had on a pair of jeans.  I  have no recall of whether I had shoes 
    on. My head was down against my chest as I was doing this. Again, I  felt 
    groggy but somewhat aware of my surroundings.  Standing next to me on  my 
    right side was a small man whom I did not get a good look at.  I  seem to 
    remember that I could see the top of his head out of the corner of my eye 
    and  it  was greyish white with no hair.  He wore what I perceived to  be 
    black clothes. He said to me, "Are you ready?", at which point I replied, 
    "I guess so." He then took me by my left hand and began leading me out of 
    the bedroom, down the hall and into the livingroom.  At some point during 
    this promenade,  he blurted out,  "Hurry!".  It seemed to me that he  was 
    taking many more steps than I was.  He was smaller than I and seemed like 
    he  was late for something or that he was taking too long  to  accomplish 
    his task. We headed for the door that leads out to the backyard. I do not 
    remember going out the door,  but the next thing I do remember is that we 
    are  outside.  We walk across the yard and end up beside this very  small 
    jet  black oval object that I assume was a craft of some sort.  I  do not 
    remember a door,  as such,  but there was an opening that I had to crouch 
    down to get through. I entered first with him following. I  sat down in a 
    chair  of  some  sort that was,  I  assume,  at the rear  of  the  craft, 
    immediately  on  my left.  I  say this because the little man  was  doing 
    something in front of me where there seemed to be a lot of equipment  and 
    another  chair.  He was working quite quickly at something,  facing to my 
    right as I watched him.  At this point,  a  small door,  which I  thought 
    looked like a glove-box in a car, fell open. He cursed, "S---t!", which I 
    found quite humorous.  I even remember chuckling a bit at this,  thinking 
    that he was not much different than I was in his actions.  Abruptly,   my 
    recollections end.  I  do not know what took place after this,  if indeed 
    this was a realtime event. 
     
      The  next  dream  concerning this subject occurred within days  of  the 
    March 26  scenario. Upon further reflection, I  feel that this one may be 
    another remembered segment of the same experience. When I become aware of 
    my surroundings, I am sitting at a low table.  It is white and although I 
    cannot  move my head around,  everything else seemed to be of  this  same 
    color.   Again,   I  feel as though I am drugged and possibly  not  fully 
    conscious.   My  head is glued to my chest as it had been in the  earlier 
    dream. I immediatly sensed two presences other than myself. One was on my 
    left at the side of the table which I perceived to be a male.  The  other 
    was immediatly on my right. I never saw this one but I perceived her as a 
    female  as I will explain.  I  am looking down the whole time,  but I was 
    aware that the male on my left was doing something.  I said to him,  "How 
    many others have you worked with?".  He responded, "What do you mean?"  I 
    replied,   "How  many other people have you worked with?"  He  thought  a 
    minute and then said, "Two." At this point,  the entity on my right said, 
    in a distinctly female voice,  "Oh, and then there was our brother." This 
    elicited from the male some sort of confirming gesture. I  am not sure if 
    I  saw  this or just felt it.  I  could not stand not being able to  look 
    around and said,  "Just a minute". I  then tried to lift my head to get a 
    glimpse  of my surroundings.  It took all the strength I could muster  to 
    overcome  the  force that held my head in its downward position,   but  1 
    managed to look up.  When I did,  I  looked straight into the eyes of the 
    male  on  my  left.  I  was overwhelmed with delight.  It  was  something 
    concrete that I could take with me.  I  will never forget the sight.  His 
    eyes  were very large.  They were very human looking in structure  and  a 
    beautiful light blue in color.  They seemed endless and I felt elated.  I 
    was  so  close to him that I seem to remember being able to make out  the 
    lines in the iris. This was only a momentary glance but enough to last me 
    a lifetime. At this point, my head was returned to its original position. 
    Sometime later,  I  remember looking down at a Petrie dish of translucent 
    green liquid or jelly. A third entity was standing in the background just 
    able to be made out in the corner of my eye. He was not unlike the entity 
    on the cover of Communion,  although his head was more angular at the top 
    and perhaps slightly wider. He wore a long, robed garrnent that seemed to 
    shimmer  slightly.   It had long sleeves covering his arms which  he  had 
    folded so that his hands were not visible.  I  got the impression that he 
    was very much in charge. He had a cold stare. I was still very much aware 
    of  the  green  substance in front of me when the third  entity  uttered, 
    "Wait."  I turned slightly, as much as I could, to get a better look.  He 
    made  a  nodding gesture.  When I turned my head back to view  the  green 
    jelly,   it  was no longer there.  Instead,  there was a bowl of  what  I 
    perceived to be,  of all things, mashed potatoes.  I  do not know whether 
    the  nodding gesture from this being changed its appearance or whether it 
    was simply replaced as my attention was drawn away from it. This is all I 
    remember of this dream.  There have been many other strange things happen 
    and  other  less vivid dreams concerning the UFO phenomenon,  but  it  is 
    these dreams described above that I find so fascinating.  They are so out 
    of  sync  with  my  norrnal  dream state.  There seems  to  be  no  clear 
    beginning,  no middle, no end.  Just fragmentary segments to tantalize my 
    imagination. I am still unsettled and confused as to whether these events 
    were  real  and related or whether they are totaly unrelated events  that 
    are linked together only by my immersion in this very compelling subject. 
    Or,   perhaps,   they were not real at all and were generated out  of  my 
    subconscious  mind  to fulfill an inner need to be  associated  with  the 
    elite "chosen"  few who have actually experienced something real. Did the 
    sequences  truly occur?  At times the question drives my up the wall.   I 
    hope that I can one day find out.  As for the missing-time incident,  the 
    possible  visual sighting,  the image on my bedroom door and the dream  I 
    had as a child,  I know that these were real events. They did occur. But, 
    as  to whether or not they are related to the UFO phenomena,  I  can  not 
    make a concrete decision at this time.  I  have recently begun to undergo 
    hypnotherapy, having made a personal decision to determine if the lunatic 
    fringe is just around the corner. If the determination can be made that I 
    have somehow construed these happenings out of my own mind, then the case 
    should  be handed to qualified psychologists to try and understand why an 
    ordinary  person would relate experiences on a subconscious level that so 
    closely resemble experiences of actual abductees. If indeed, though,  the 
    aforementioned  experiences  and  those  not  mentioned  here  are  truly 
    occurring  in event-level reality,  then I will probably have  to  change 
    many  of  the views I hold of reality.  But,  however it goes,   I   will 
    approach the phenomenon as any good investigator,  scientist or therapist 
    should;  not blindly accepting every detail that comes out of hypnosis as 
    actual truth,  but rather integrating those perceptions and  observations 
    into an acceptable level of compatability with my life.  In either  case, 
    the prospect of an unknown entities, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, 
    coming  into the homes of people and abducting them for unknown  purposes 
    is  truly  amazing  and at times frightening.  It is  possibly  the  most 
    important happening since human creation. I know that I personally cannot 
    sit  on the sidelines and wait for something to take place.  We all  must 
    make  every  effort  to  understand as much as possible  of  the  enigma. 
    Perhaps  we may find nothing that fits our level of comprehension.   But, 
    isn't that the beginning of understanding? To wonder?
