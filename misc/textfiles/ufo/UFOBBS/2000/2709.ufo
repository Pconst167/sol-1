    REBUTTAL:  To David Saunders and Michael Peck 
               By Carl Sagan and Steven Soter 

      Dr.   David  Saunders  last month claimed to  have  demonstrated  the 
    statistical significance of the Hill map,  which was allegedly found on 
    board  a  landed  UFO and supposedly depicted the sun  and  14   nearby 
    sunlike stars.  The Hill map was said to resemble the Fish map --   the 
    latter   being  an  optimal  two-dimensional  projection  of  a  three-
    dimensional model prepared by selecting 14 stars from a positional list 
    of  the  46  nearest known sunlike stars.  Saunders'  argument  can  be 
    expressed  by the equation SS = Dr -(SF + VP),  in which all quantities 
    are  in  information bits.  SS is the statistical significance  of  the 
    correlation  between  the two maps,  DR is the  degree  of  resemblance 
    between them, SF is a selection factor depending on the number of stars 
    chosen  and  the size of the list,  and VP is the  information  content 
    provided  by a free choice in three dimensions of the vantage point for 
    projecting the map. Saunders finds SS = 6 to 11 bits,  meaning that the 
    correlation  is equivalent to between 6 and 11  consecutive heads in  a 
    coin  toss  and  therefore probably not accidental.  The  procedure  is 
    acceptable  in  principle,  but the result depends entirely on how  the 
    quantities on the right-hand side of the equation were chosen. 
    
      For the degree of resemblance between the two maps,  Saunders  claims 
    that DR = 11 to 16 bits, which he admits is only a guess -- but we will 
    let it stand. For the selection factor,  he at first takes SF = log2C = 
    37.8 bits, where C represents the combinations of 46 things taken 14 at 
    a  time.  Realizing that the size of this factor alone will cause SS to 
    be  negative  and wipe out his argument,  he makes a number of  ad  hoc 
    adjustments  based  essentially on his interpretation of  the  internal 
    logic  of the Hill map,  and SF somehow gets reduced to only 3.9  bits. 
    For the present, we will let even that stand in order to avoid becoming 
    embroiled  in  a  discussion  of how an explorer  from  the  star  Zeta 
    Reticuli  would  choose  to arrange his/her/its  travel  itinerary  --a 
    matter  about which we can claim no particular knowledge.  However,  we 
    must  bear  in mind that a truly unprejudiced examination of  the  data 
    with no a priori interpretations would give SF = 37.8 bits. 
    
      It is Saunders'  choice of the vantage point factor VP with which  we 
    must take strongest issue,  for this is a matter of geometry and simple 
    pattern  recognition.  Saunders assumes that free choice of the vantage 
    point  for viewing a three-dimensional model of 15  stars is worth only 
    VP = 3 bits.  He then reduces the information content of directionality 
    to one bit by introducing the "constraint"  that the star Zeta  Tucanae 
    be  occulted by Zeta Reticuli (with no special notation on the Hill map 
    to mark this peculiarity). This ad hoc device is invoked to explain the 
    absence of Zeta Tucanae from the Hill map,  but it reveals the circular 
    reasoning involved.  After all, why bother to calculate the statistical 
    significance of the supposed map correlation if one has already decided 
    which points represent which stars? 
    
      Certainly  the  selection of vantage point is worth more  than  three 
    bits  (not  to mention one bit).  Probably the easiest circumstance  to 
    recognize  and  remember  about  random projections  of  the  model  in 
    question  are  the cases in which two stars appear  to  be  immediately 
    adjacent.  By viewing the model from all possible directions, there are 
    14   distinct ways in which any given star can be seen in projection as 
    adjacent to some other star. This can be done for each of the 15 stars, 
    giving  210   projected  configurations  --  each  of  which  would  be 
    recognized  as  substantially different from the others in  information 
    content.  And of course there are many additional distinct recognizable 
    projections  of  the 15  stars not involving any two being  immediately 
    adjacent.  (For example,  three stars nearly equidistant in a  straight 
    line  are  easily  recognized,  as in Orion's belt.)  Thus for  a  very 
    conservative lower bound,  the information content determined by choice 
    of vantage point (that is,  by being allowed to rotate the model  about 
    three  axes)  can be taken as at least equal to VP = log2(210)  =   7.7 
    bits. Using the rest of Saunders' analysis, this would at best yield SS 
    = zero to 4.4 bits -- not a very impressive correlation. 
    
      There  is another way to understand the large number of bits involved 
    in the choice of the vantage point. The stars in question are separated 
    by  distances  of order 10  parsecs.  If the vantage point is  situated 
    above  or not too far from the 15  stars,  it need only be  shifted  by 
    about  0.17   parsecs  to cause a change of one  degree  in  the  angle 
    subtended  by  some  pair of stars.  Now one degree is  a  very  modest 
    resolution, corresponding to twice the full moon and is easily detected 
    by anyone.  For three degrees of freedom,  the number of vantage points 
    corresponding  to this resolution is of order (10/0.17)  cubed  ~  (60) 
    cubed ~ 2 X 10  to the fifth power,  corresponding to VP = 17.6   bits. 
    This  factor alone is sufficient to make SS negative,  and to wipe  out 
    any validity to the supposed correlation. 
    
      Even  if  we were to accept Saunders'  claim that SS = 6 to  11  bits 
    (which  we obviously do not,  particularly in view of the proper  value 
    for  SF),   it  is not at all clear that this  would  be  statistically 
    significant   because   we  are  not  told  how  many  other   possible 
    correlations were tried and failed before the Fish map was devised. For 
    comparison,  there is the well-known correlation between the  incidence 
    of  Andean  earthquakes and oppositions of the planet  Uranus.   It  is 
    unlikely  in  the  extreme that there is a  physical  causal  mechanism 
    operating here --  among other reasons, because there is no correlation 
    with oppositions of Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune.  But to have found such 
    a  correlation  the  investigator must have sought a  wide  variety  of 
    correlations  of  seismic  events  in  many parts  of  the  world  with 
    oppositions  and conjunctions of many astronomical objects.  If  enough 
    correlations  are sought,  statistics requires that eventually one will 
    be found,  valid to any level of significance that we wish.  Before  we 
    can   determine   whether  a  claimed  correlation  implies  a   causal 
    connection,  we must convince ourselves that the number of correlations 
    sought  has  not  been  so large as to  make  the  claimed  correlation 
    meaningless. 
    
      This  point  can  be further illustrated  by  Saunders'   example  of 
    flipping  coins.   Suppose we flip a coin once per second  for  several 
    hours. Now let us consider three cases: two heads in a row, 10 heads in 
    a row,  and 40  heads in a row.  We would,  of course,  think there  is 
    nothing  extraordinary  about the first case.  Only  four  attempts  at 
    flipping  two coins are required to have a reasonable expectation value 
    of  two heads in a row.  Ten heads in a row,  however,  will occur only 
    once in every 2 to the tenth power = 1,024  trials,  and 40  heads in a 
    row  will occur only once every 2 to the fortieth ~ 10  to the  twelfth 
    power trials. At a flip rate of one coin per second, a toss of 10 coins 
    requires 10 seconds; 1,024 trials of 10  coins each requires just under 
    three hours.  But 40 heads in a row at the same rate requires 4 X 10 to 
    the thirteenth power seconds or a little over a million years. A run of 
    40  consecutive heads in a few hours of coin tossing would certainly be 
    strong  prima facie evidence of the ability to control the fall of  the 
    coin.   Ten  heads in a row under the circumstances we  have  described 
    would provide no convincing evidence at all.  It is expected by the law 
    of probability. The Hill map correlation is at best claimed by Saunders 
    to be in the category of 10 heads in a row, but with no clear statement 
    as to the number of unsuccessful trials previously attempted. 
    
      Michael Peck finds a high degree of correlation between the Hill  map 
    and  the  Fish map,  and thereby also misses the central point  of  our 
    original  criticism:   that  the  stars in the Fish  map  were  already 
    preselected in order to maximize that very correlation.  Peck finds one 
    chance  in  10   to  the fifteenth power that 15   random  points  will 
    correlate with the Fish map as well as the Hill map does. However,  had 
    he selected 15  out of a random sample of, say, 46 points in space, and 
    had  he  simultaneously  selected the optimal vantage  point  in  three 
    dimensions in order to maximize the resemblance, he could have achieved 
    an  apparent correlation comparable to that which he claims between the 
    Hill and Fish maps.  Indeed,  the statistical fallacy involved in  "the 
    enumeration of favorable circumstances" leads necessarily to large, but 
    spurious correlations. 
    
      We again conclude that the Zeta Reticuli argument and the entire Hill 
    story do not survive critical scrutiny.
