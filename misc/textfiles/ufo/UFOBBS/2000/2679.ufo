                                    BEWARE:
               Your Memories Can Be Changed By UFO Investigators
                                By Anne Strieber

      A  new study shows that our memories of an event are not  permanently 
    fixed;   they can be changed by suggestion.  This is important news for 
    UFO  witnesses  who seek help from UFO researchers in order to  try  to 
    understand  what has happened to them;  if they fall into the hands  of 
    people who are biased towards one particular viewpoint,  their memories 
    may become permanently distorted. 
     
     In the "Brain/Mind Bulletin"  of October 1989, Dr.  Elizabeth Loftus, 
    of the University of Washington, described studies that show a person's 
    memory  of  an event can be manipulated after the fact.   This  article 
    states  that  "the  natural  assumption  is  that  the  details  of  an 
    extraordinary  scene  are deeply imprinted in the  consciousness  of  a 
    witness  and  therefore immune to 'revision'."   According  to  Loftus, 
    however,   this is naively optimistic.  As some trial lawyers have long 
    known, she said, people can be made to "remember"  completely false and 
    imaginary things by being fed misinformation presented as fact. 
    
      She  cited  several recent studies of a similar design:  A  group  of 
    subjects watches a videotape of a complex and dramatic event, such as a 
    simulated violent crime or an automobile accident.  Half the group then 
    receives  false  new  information and the other half is  given  no  new 
    information. 
    
      "In   study   after  study,   those  who  received   the   post-event 
    misinformation  tended to incorporate much of it into their 'memories'. 
    The other group, however,maintained a fairly accurate picture. 
    
      "...Through manipulation,  subjects have been made to remember clean-
    shaven  men as having mustaches and straight hair as curly.  They  have 
    even recalled a nonexistent item as large as a barn in the middle of  a 
    scene. 
    
      "People are particularly prone to having their memories modified when 
    the passage of time allows the original memory to fade," Loftus said. 
    
      These studies should be taken as a warning by all UFO witnesses. Most 
    people,   after  having  experienced  an  anomalous  event  such  as  a 
    confrontation  with what appear to be beings from another world,   will 
    naturally seek out a UFO researcher in order to learn more about  their 
    experiences.  However, most UFO investigators are far from open-minded; 
    they  have strong opinions about what UFOs are,  despite the fact  that 
    they have no evidence to back up their theories. 
    
      Some  UFO  investigators  are  convinced that aliens  are  here  from 
    another planet, stealing eggs and sperm in order to create a new master 
    race.   Others  feel that aliens are here  on  military  reconnaissance 
    flights  or  are scientists trying to learn more about the human  race. 
    Still  others  delude  themselves with the vain hope  that  aliens  are 
    watching  over  us and will rescue us if we are on the brink  of  self-
    destruction  through  the  use of nuclear  weapons  or  from  excessive 
    pollution  of our planet.  There are so-  called UFO investigators  who 
    have  taken  the  guise of religious leaders,   who  claim  to  channel 
    inspirational messages from other worlds.  If a UFO witness comes  into 
    contact  with  one of these highly opinionated  "experts",   there's  a 
    chance that the truth of his experience will be lost forever. 
    
      What  can  you  do to protect yourself?  The best  advice  is  to  be 
    skeptical  when confronted with the latest UFO theories - ask yourself, 
    where's the proof? Never let yourself be hypnotized by a UFO researcher 
    who is not a trained,  professional hypnotist. Suggestions given to you 
    while you are in a hypnotic state are even more likely to distort  your 
    memory. 
    
      A related matter,  concerning what are called near-death experiences, 
    has  recently  come to light.  This experience occurs when  people  are 
    brought  back from the brink of death.  They describe traveling out  of 
    their bodies and often remember entering a dark tunnel, with a light at 
    the  other end.  When brought back to life,  they find themselves to be 
    changed - spiritually, psychologically and physically. 
    
      In  our  Spring  1990   issue,  we reported  that  the  physical  and 
    psychological  changes  undergone  by  people  who  have  had   visitor 
    experiences  are  similar to the aftereffects experienced by those  who 
    survive a close brush with death. 
    
      Dr. Kenneth Ring,  who has spent years interviewing UFO witnesses and 
    near-death  survivors,   discovered that people from  both  groups  may 
    become  more  sensitive  to light and sound,   and  have  an  increased 
    tendency  towards  allergies.  Some gain psychic powers,  such  as  the 
    ability  to predict the future or to heal.  Others  become  "electrical 
    sensitives", who can put out street lights simply by walking near them. 
    
      Now  "The  New York Times"  reports that people who  have  near-death 
    experiences,   and  people  who  merely think they are  about  to  die, 
    experience  similar mental sensations.  These results come from a study 
    done at the University of Virginia (and reported in the English medical 
    journal  'The  Lancer')  of twenty-eight patients who would  have  died 
    without medical intervention,  and another thirty patients who were not 
    in danger of dying but who thought they were. 
    
      There are three theories about what causes the near-death experience: 
    it  could  be a glimpse of our after-life,  it could be the  result  of 
    chemicals  released in our bodies when we're dying which cause  certain 
    types of visions, or it could be a psychological response to the trauma 
    of death. 
    
      Patients  who had near-death experiences when they only thought  they 
    were  dying  give  support  to the psychological  theory.   The  theory 
    regarding  biological changes is supported by the fact that more  near-
    death  experiences were reported by patients who were  actually  dying. 
    And  the idea that patients were seeing a glimpse of their future after 
    death is borne out by the fact that both groups managed to have visions 
    and enhanced mental experiences,  despite the fact those who were dying 
    actually had diminished brain function during that time. 
    
      Does  this  mean that those people who only thought  they  were  near 
    death  might also have undergone some of the physical changes that  Dr. 
    Ring discovered?  Can we then draw the conclusion that people who  only 
    thought  they saw a UFO - who saw,  for instance,  a  meteor instead  - 
    might have the same aftereffects as UFO witnesses? There is fascinating 
    material here for future study.
