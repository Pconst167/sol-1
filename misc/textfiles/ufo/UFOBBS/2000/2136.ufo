Hi Bill
This from the Sunday People
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Video  film evidence of a mushroom shaped spaceship hovering over
rooftops  is  to  be  examined  by UFO experts, Night after night
stunned  residents have seen the silent sparkling object spinning
to  and  fro  above their homes for up to an hour at a time. They
are convinced they are being watched by alliens from outer space.
And  their claims are backed by the Earl of Kimberley, a member of
the  House  of Lords all-party UFO study group. The Earls stately
Hail stone House is only a short distance from Pinehurst, Swindon
,  Wiltshire, where the sightings were recorded. After hearing of
the  mystery  craft he said: "There are other civillizations more
advanced than ours."

   Ray and Eleanor Baughn were the first to spot he flying mushroom 
two years ago. Since then, several neighbours have  also  seen it. 
Disabled Ray, 49, who took the video film is eager  to hear what 
the experts have to say after they've studied it.He  said,"When  I  
look  at  it  through binoculars I can see pointed  leg like objects 
jutting from both sides before it zooms off  at  great speed. "Im 
convinced it is from outer space, It is not  a star because it appears 
when there are no stars visible in the  sky."  

   Community  worker  Tony Haimes, 37, and his wife Tina also  claim  
to  have  seen the "spaceship". Tony said it had red green  and orange 
colours. Another resident, father of four Cecil Vernon,  said;"Ihave  
had  one  sighting and I feel certain there could  extraterrestrial 
beings out there."
