Labeled in corner by Klass:  THE KEY MJ-12 CHALLENGE THAT
STANTON FRIEDMAN REFUSED TO ACCEPT!  WHY??

Apparently dated 11/16/87 by STF in upper right corner.

                       Philip J. Klass
                    404 "N" ST. SOUTHWEST
                   WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT:

     Between Philip J. Klass (hereinafter called Klass) and
Stanton T. Friedman (hereinafter called Friedman).

1.  Klass agrees to pay Friedman:

     (A)  $500 for a photocopy of each (different) authentic
(as defined below) "official-business" letter written by
Adm. R.H. Hillenkoetter prior to Nov. 18, 1952, which uses
the "Moore/MJ-12" format for writing a date with an
"unnecessary comma", i.e. "24 January, 1947".

     (B)  $1,000 if this Hillenkoetter letter is written on
a day of the month which has only a single digit and if the
letter uses a zero before the digit, i.e. "01 January,
1947."

     (C)  $2,000 if, in addition to (A) or (B), said
Hillenkoetter letter carries a typed name-of-sender that
reads:  "Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter" as differentiated from
"R.H. Hillenkoetter".

(2)  The above offer is conditional on Friedman agreeing to
pay Klass according to the following schedule:

     (A)  $100 for a photocopy of each and every different
authentic (as defined below) "official business" letter
written by Adm. R.H. Hillenkoetter prior to Nov. 18, 1952,
which uses the traditional civil or military date format,
i.e. "January 24, 1947," or "24 January 1947" with NO
"unnecessary comma."

     (B)  $200 if said Hillenkoetter letter is written on a
day of the month which has only a single digit and IF the
letter does NOT use a zero before the digit, i.e. "1 January
1947."

     (C)  $400 if, in addition, said Hillenkoetter letter
bears a typed name-of-sender "R.H. Hillenkoetter" and NOT
"Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter."

(3)  Authenticity:  Any Hillenkoetter letter which is
resident in the archives of the Harry S. Truman Library, the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library, the National Archives or the
Library of Congress shall be considered "authentic" for the
purposes of this agreement.  For any Hillenkoetter letter
obtained from any other source, the burden-of-proof of
authenticity shall be on the submitter.

(4)  Payment under the terms of this agreement shall be made
in U.S. Dollars within sixty (60) days after photocopy
evidence has been mailed to the other party by Registered
Mail, unless the authenticity of the document submitted is
challenged with thirty (30) days by the recipient.

(5)  This Memorandum of Agreement shall remain in effect for
a period of one year from the date of its execution by both
parties.

[Friedman's response, in the place where his signature would
have gone:]
NOT signed by STF because this is a stupid offer totally
inappropriate to the matter at hand.  Of course there are
memos with typed signatures R.H. Hillenkoetter and using a
conventional format.  SO WHAT?  There are also items clearly
____________________________________________________________
(Stanton T. Friedman)

referring to Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter and even just plain
ROSCOE Hillenkoetter.  There are many examples of the so
called wrong date format.. including use by Hillenkoetter
himself and in many NATO documents.  The reasoning here is
tortured .. the facts are clear.  Philip J. Klass simply
cannot provide honest research but is an expert at massive
misinterpretation.  STF 11/19/97

It should be further noted that I have from time to time
used Stanton T. Friedman, Stanton Friedman, Stanton Terry
Friedman, S.T. Friedman, and S. Terry Friedman and 18 Nov.,
1987, and November 18,1987 and 87-11-18 among other date
formats.  Jumping to conclusions is fine for kangaroos but
not for reporters or scientists or others claiming to seek
truth.  If this kind of garbage is the best that Klass can
do in the almost six months since MJ-12 items have been out
in the open it almost seems reasonable to conclude that
there are no reasons for concluding that the Briefing and
Cutler Twining memo are frauds and a great many for
accepting the shocking notion that they are legitimate.  Of
course if they become accepted to the point where the
president makes any aanouncement then Klass will have to pay
me $10,000.  Perhaps this could account for his desperate
attempts to cast doubt?  Or maybe it is just his complete
unwillingness to admit that he has been misrepresenting UFO
facts for 20 years?  Maybe it just means that those who have
leaked information, disinformation and misinformation to him
in the past keep insisting that he find arguments no matter
how illogical, inaccurate, libelous the are....STF
