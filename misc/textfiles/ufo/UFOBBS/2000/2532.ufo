J. Edgar Hoover and a few trusted FBI agents met with space aliens several 
times over a 20-year period, top-secret files reveal.

The files, located in a vault under the Justice Department building 
Washington, D.C., were discovered last month by an investigative reporter 
working on a biography of the late director of the FBI.

The records, including photos, indicate Hoover first met with a group of 
aliens in 1949, followed by mettings in 1954, 1961, 1964, 1968 and shortly 
before his death in 1972.

Hoover's agents apparently got wind an alien stronghold in the Sierra Nevadas 
near Lake Tahoe and siezed five of them.

Hoover then black-mailed them into giving him sophisticated "spy equipment, 
including a device that can see as well as hear through thick walls. In 
return, he kept their existence secret, according to the reporter, who has 
asked that his name not be revealed.

"There are people who would kill me if they know who I am," he explains.

RUIN

"There are other things, in those files that could ruin the reputations of 
many well-known men and women, both living and dead."

Hoover's notes indicate the aliens were - and are - scientists who have come 
to do research on the planet.

"They feared that their work would be compromised if Hoover revealed their 
existence," the reporter explains.

Grand paranoid that he was, Hoover seemed interested only in devices that 
could improve his surveillance of his imagined enemies.

"I think the aliens would have given him just about anything he asked, 
including some amazing medical cures.

"But Hoover was interested only in finding more dirt for his secret files."

The reporter says there's nothing in the files to indicate if any high-ranking 
FBI agent might still be meeting with and blackmailing the aliens.
