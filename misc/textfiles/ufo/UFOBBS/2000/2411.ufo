SUBJECT: A UFO FOR THE PRESIDENT-TO-BE                       FILE: UFO2411




One night in 1974, from a Cessna Citation aircraft, one of America's most 
famous citizens saw a UFO.

There were four persons aboard the plane: pilot Bill Paynter, two security 
guards, and the governor of California, Ronald Reagan. As the airplane 
approached Bakersfield, California, the passengers called Paynter's attention 
to a strange object to their rear. "It appeared to be several hundred yards 
away," Paynter recalled. "It was a fairly steady light until it began to 
accelerate. Then it appeared to elongate. Then the light took off. It went up 
at a 45-degree angle - at a high rate of speed. Everyone on the plane was 
surprised. . . . The UFO went from a normal cruise speed to a fantastic speed 
instantly. If you give an airplane power, it will accelerate - but not like a 
hot rod, and that's what this was like.

A week later Reagan recounted the sighting to Norman C. Miller, then 
Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal. Regan told Miller, "We 
followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it 
to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up 
into the heavens." When Miller expressed some doubt, a "look of horror came 
over [Reagan]. It suddenly dawned on him ... that he was talking to a 
reporter." Immediately afterward, according to Miller, Reagan "clammed up."

Reagan has not discussed the incident publicly since.
