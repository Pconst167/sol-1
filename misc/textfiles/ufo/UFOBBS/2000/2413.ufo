SUBJECT: ALASKA MOTHERSHIP                                   FILE: UFO2413




When he first saw them, Japanese Airlines officer Kenju Terauchi, who was 
piloting a Boeing 747 cargo plane, thought they were lights from a military 
aircraft. He soon learned otherwise. During the next half hour he and his crew 
realized that things of a decidedly unearthly character had joined them in 
the skies over Alaska. It was November 17, 1986, at 5:10 in the afternoon. 

The pilot, first officer, and flight engineer saw two lighted structures, 
"about the same size as the body of a DC-8 jet" in Terauchi's words, moving 
about 1,000 feet in front of the cargo craft. Terauchi's radio communications 
to Anchorage flight control were strangely garbled, but enough got through 
that Anchorage urgently contacted a nearby Air Force radar station to see what 
it was picking up. At various times during the event the UFOs were tracked by 
the 747 on-board radar and by the Air Force ground radar.

As the sky darkened, the UFOs paced the 747 and were finally lost in the 
distant horizon. Then, a pale white light appeared behind the aircraft. 
Silhouetted against lights on the ground, it looked like an immense Saturn-
shaped object - the size, Terauchi estimated, of "two aircraft carriers." He 
thought it was a "mothership" that had carried the two "smaller" objects, 
themselves of no inconsequential size. The Anchorage radar was recording the 
object's presence. For the first time the crew felt fear.

By now the aircraft was running low on fuel, and the captain requested 
permission to land. The UFO vanished suddenly at 5:39 P.M.
