SUBJECT: I WAS RAPED BY A SPACE ALIEN !                      FILE: UFO2111


NEW YORK - Divorced mom Connie Renblosser was kidnapped, abused and raped -
by space aliens !

Now the courageous woman is coming forward with her horrifying story, hoping
that she can help others who have suffered similar ordeals by revealing that
they are not alone.

What I went through was terrible, but I know I'm not the only woman who has
had this happen to her, says Connie, 34. UFO experts have told me that as
many as one out of every 50 Americans has been abducted by aliens. I want the
government to stop covering up the truth about aliens. They are all around us,
they are taking citizens off the streets, they are damaging people's bodies 
and minds. As long as we deny that this is happening, we will be the helpless
guineapigs of extraterrestrials.

Connie was abducted from the terrace of her high rise apartment on the night
of Aug. 3, 1993. She and her small daughter Tina, 2, had gone to bed earlier
in the evening and Connie had awakened to a bright light shining in her
window. She stepped onto the terrace of her 23rd floor apartment and suddenly
found herself paralyzed in the glare of a spotlight coming from above.

Incredible, she found herself floating in the air, suspended above the streets
of New York and rising into a giant, disc-like spacecraft. Once inside, she
was subjected to horrifying medical experiments - and raped by a extraterres-
trial with gray skin and bulging, egg-size eyes.

Connie passed out and awoke hours later on her own bed, her body bruised and
battered. She went to a hospital emergency room, where doctors treated her
as a rape victim and urged her to report the attack to police. But the shell-
shocked mom kept her experience a secret.

I was afraid to tell - afraid no one would believe me, Connie now admits. I
felt guilty and ashamed. It was only later, when I heard a radio program 
featuring four people who'd been abducted by UFOs, that I realized I wasn't 
the only one. And I realized I had a duty to come forward and tell what
happened to me.

I believe there are many other women like me - women who've been sexually
molested by aliens and who've suffered in silence the devastating feelings
that all rape victims suffer. I want them to know they aren't alone. I want
them to contact me and tell me their stories.

Space alien rape victim Connie Renblosser recalls every moment of her shocking
ordeal as if it were seared - second by second - into her memory. Here, in
her own words, is a description of what she suffered at the hands of her
extraterrestrial tormentors:

I was physically paralyzed, but my mind was alert. I can remember being taken
inside the metallic spaceship and carried by four small, hairless beings with
large eyes up a dimly lit corridor. They took me through rooms full of 
instruments and machinery with flashing lights and beeping monitors.

The spacemen carried me into a room where they laid me on a metal gurney. I
was wheeled into a glass or plastic enclosure with huge lights suspended from
the ceiling and attached to wires and metal rods. After that, the agony began.

A tall gray skinned space creature with a huge bulbous head and bulging eyes
appeared at my side and ordered the little ones away. Then he began examining
me, using giant needles to puncture my skin and using strange instruments to
measure and probe my body.

I can remember that he inserted something into my womb. I could feel it wig-
gling around inside me, but I couldn't move, I couldn't stop it. The pain
was so terrible I passed out.

The next thing I knew I woke up in my own bed. I was covered in blood. I had
a puncture wound behind my left ear and another hole near my navel, both of
them still oozing blood. My thighs and arms were badly bruised. A huge chunk
of hair was missing from the back of my skull.

I went to the hospital they told me I had internal injuries. They said my
cervix  was bruised and the walls of my womb had been damaged. They thought
I was a rape victim and counseled me to report the crime to police, but at the
time I couldn't face it.

Since then I've had all the normal reactions of a rape victim - only worse.
Because I know that the creature who violated my body was not of this world.
I know I was molested by a monster from outer space and I will never, ever,
be the same again.
