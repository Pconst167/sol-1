SUBJECT: COOPER "FAQ"                                        FILE: UFO2419






So many have wondered at Milton William Cooper and his recent
past that I had to compile a short number of notes about him.

In the few short years that Bill has been around the UFO convention
circuit, he has met with much grief from the bleeding edge of
technology, called "electronic message systems."  This has come
to mean a variety of computer based information services and the
denizens of what we impetuously infer to as "the network."

Bill literally started out on the wrong foot with Fido-Net and
several other private networks, with claims of the "last" revision
of his semi-published works.  The works have reached compilation
in a book _Behold A Pale Horse_ that Bill still hawks on his radio
broadcasting venture.  Of these writings, almost all went out in
flames as Bill viciously "defended attacks" upon his published
and not so published musings.  To say that Bill's earnest efforts
were merely "attacked" is an understatement!

People came out of the woodwork (from lurking) to question a great
deal, if not all by generalizations, of Mr. Cooper's work. His claims
of government control of the human race have yet to abate as a result.
If I were to describe the tortuous path the  way his opinions and
details, represented as "factual information" that he would stand
behind always, I would have to use 30 or posts to present a
definitive example of the meanderings of his "last revisions."

To say that this guy has feet of clay might be appropriate.
Immediately after his brief career as Audio Visual clerk in
a briefing station overseas, in which he went AWOL ten days in
a drunken binge, and subsequent discharge, Bill has represented
on-air that he holds an Associates degree in photography.

His interest in UFO's has apparently waned, possibly because
of an incident where he was set up with a fictitious set of files
known as the KRILL files, to which the authors publicly confronted
him with as fabricated and that he deliberately plagiarized the
information contained to his own ends.  Bill toured the UFO lecture
circuit for a number of months afterwards as a guest speaker and
picked up on the idea of using a computer bbs system to promote
his ideology(s) among computer users.  With the advent of CAJI,
the Citizens Against Joint Intelligence (?), Cooper found an
audience with conspiracy theorists in some pretty unlikely places.

Lately we find Bill broadcasting via shortwave and satellite
radio, and has for the last two years passed on various themes
of impending doom, gloom, financial collapse of the government.
Of the last few months in particular, Mr. Cooper has espoused
the creation of lawful, civilian militias with lawful arms.
Among his wares that he has sponsorship from, Bill advocates
the overthrow of the United States government, not so much
because of his "Indictment" statement papers of years ago,
where he alledges that the aliens have a secret treaty with
the world's governments.  No, Bill now blames the country's
economic ills on the various financial institutions involved.

Of these and various ethnic groups are decried as being the
villains and we being the victims, the persuasive arguments
are made for the purchase of foodstuffs, gardening stock, arms
and various precious metals as currency in an anarchistic era
ahead of the world's culture.  This, as of tonight's reading,
was due to the supposed revocation of the United States
Constitution when the United Nations charter and treaties
were embarked upon as legal instruments of world peace.

Tonight's broadcast presented again, in detail, precisely why
Bill Cooper is so popular.  He presents topical questions that
we see emerge in front of us about the state of the world and
he feeds off of the attendant paranoia that modern life contains.
We pilot always into an unknown future, Robert Heinlein wrote,
and the fears of everyday life, though much numbed by conditioning
of our culture, however intentional by pressure groups, news
media and commercials that are shaping our lower behavior.

What Cooper portrays as a conspiracy of world proportions,
the ration mind can see as only a thin broth of half-investigated
"truths" disguised by a compelling monologue of righteous
indignations mixed with ranting speculations that sidetrack
any effort from serious inquiries about the actual facts and
their social background.  Stir in anthems of military overtones
and beat to a froth with patriotic themes and interviews with
cultural "victim-ologies" as audio testimonials as factual
affidavit-able facts and you have a radio show that appeals
to many audiences, all of them not quite bent on getting at
the truth what-so-ever.

It's actually kind of ironic that the very audience that he
sells his "agit-prop" to, his very own "flock" for his fleecing,
is not counted publicly as the "sheeple" that he claims to
be trying to awaken in our nation.  His claims of socialism
and anarchy are hallmarks of his fear-mongering mannerisms
and surely his name will fade if we but ignore further mention
of his agenda to fleece the "sheeple" and let his efforts
sputter out on the nations computer and broadcasting networks.

That about all I'll ever need to say about his intents, his
actions, his past or his future.  His claims will not withstand
the tests of time and his brief popularity will fade...
