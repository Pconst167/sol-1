SUBJECT: 12-INCH SPACE ALIENS INVADE PARIS !                 FILE: UFO2110


PARIS - At least 26 children between the ages of 9 and 14 have reported close
encounters with tiny space aliens since March 7, raising new questions about
the mission of extraterrestrials that visit our planet.

French authorities aren't talking to avoid what one police source calls "the
potential for panic." But eyewitnesses confirm that the creatures stand about 
12 inches tall, have long, sharp fangs and are armed with what appear to be
laser pistols.

In each encounter, the extraterrestrials were said to have entered a child's
bedroom by prying open a window.

They allegedly stood quietly on the windowsill and surveyed the room for a
few seconds before they vanished into thin air. No serious injuries have been
reported, but one child was treated for shock.

The encounters coincide with increased UFO activity in France, UFO investiga-
tors said.
