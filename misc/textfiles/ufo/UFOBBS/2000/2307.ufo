     Bill was born in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he is
currently residing.

     Joining the Army at the age of 17, Bill finished his
education obtaining a GED and then attending the University of
Maryland Military Extension program where he obtained a BA in
Telecommunications/Statistical Analysis.
     While serving in the Army from March of 1969 to June of
1974, Bill was trained as a member of the United States Army
Special Forces at Fort Polk in Louisiana, and received his
Airborne Jump training at Fort Benning, Georgia. His first duty
assignment was to the 8th Special Force Battalion, School of the
Americas, at Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone, Jungle Operations
Training School, and from there he served two tours of duty as a
member of 5th Special Forces, Republic of Vietnam. While serving
in Vietnam, Bill received a Battle field commission to the rank
of 1st Lt. and ultimately another promotion to the rank of
Captain prior to his rotation to stateside for medical leave and
reassignment to Hanau Germany, where he left the Army at the end
of the Vietnam War in 1974.

     While serving as a civilian employee for the Department of
Defence at RAF Chicksands, Bedfordshire England as a Data Analyst
for the Air Force Security Services Command, Bill viewed a
document that's very existence has been denied by the United
States Government for almost thirty years. Grudge/Blue Book
Report #13..

     As a result of viewing this document, Bill was forcefully
separated from his family, whom he has not seen for over 15
years. There have been several attempts upon his life that
resulted in his going into hiding for over eight years. Having
come out of hiding at the persuasion of Ufologist John Lear, Bill
is once again actively investigating and reporting on the UFO
Phenomena. He is the founder of UFINET News and Information
Services, one of the foremost authoritative organizations dealing
with UFOs and related activity, UFINET's computer network extends
around the free world to such places as England, South America,
Japan, Germany, and is even accessed in some parts of the Soviet
Union. Bill has worked as a newspaper reporter, Radio and
