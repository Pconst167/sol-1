     ParaNet   Information  Service  (Denver,  CO)  --   In   our

continuing coverage of the Riddle of Area 51, here is yet another

installment  of  the KLAS-TV program being aired  in  Las  Vegas,

Nevada  featuring Bob Lazar, who has 'come out of the closet'  so

to speak with information regarding government testing of UFOs.



=================================================================



     Just  over this ridge [showing a photo of Area  51],  tucked

inside the test tubes of a hidden government base, the secrets of

the  universe may be unfolding.  The area is designated S-4,  and

according to one man who claims to have worked there, S-4 harbors

scientific   achievements   that  would  astonish   our   deepest

thinkers.  It is technology that, if it exists, could change  the

world, but is allegedly bottled up by military minds.



Lazar:   "It's  not  an overall  government  project.   It's  not

something that Congress appropriates money for.  2 billion is for

this; 15 billion for flying saucers; 8 billion for Star Wars.  It

doesn't  go  like  that.   I don't believe  that  they  have  any

knowledge of it at all."



     The technology that Bob Lazar says he saw extends far beyond

flying saucers.  An anti-matter reactor allows the spaceships  to

produce   their  own  gravitational  fields,  he  says,  such   a

technology,  if  real, would answer UFO skeptics who  argue  that

aliens  could  never visit Earth because  the  distances  between

worlds are too great, even at the speed of light.



Lazar:  "Gravity distorts time and space.  Just like if you had a

water bed and put a bowling ball in the middle.  It warps it down

like  that  -- that's exactly what happens to  space.   Imagining

that  you  were  in a spacecraft that could  exert  a  tremendous

gravitational  field  by itself you could sit on  any  particular

place  and turn on the gravity generator and actually warp  space

and  time, and fold it.  By shutting that off, you'd  click  back

and  you'd be a tremendous distance from where you were but  time

would not have even moved because you essentially shut it off.  I

mean it is so far fetched, people....it's difficult for people to

grasp,  and  as stubborn as the scientific community  is  they'll

never buy it, but this is, in fact, that's just what happens."



     Actually,  Lazar's explanation is very close  to  mainstream

scientific thought, and can be traced directly to Einstein.   The

difference is scientists regard it as theory only.  There is much

that science still doesn't know.



Dale  Etheridge (Scientist):  "There are people who say that  our

main  problem with that is we don't know what gravity  is.   It's

this magical force that acts at a distance.  We can describe  how

it  behaves -- that's what the law of gravity is -- it's  just  a

description  of  how it behaves, but it says nothing  about  what

gravity really is."





     We'll use Etheridge as our barometer of scientific  thought.

He says we cannot produce gravity; that there's no such thing  as

a working anti-matter reactor, and that we have yet to figure out

a  way  to  get around the speed of  light.   He  also  concedes,

though, such things are possible.



Etheridge:   "Yeah.  And really we don't know what's possible  as

there  could  be other civilizations out  there  several  hundred

years  or so -- a thousand years, even a million years  ahead  of

us  -- that have found a way to circumvent this.  We have no  way

of knowing for sure."



Lazar:  "Well, the thing is when you harness gravity, you harness

everything.   It's  the missing piece in physics right  now.   We

really know very little about gravity."



     At  least  that's  the way it used to be.   Lazar  says  the

technology to harness gravity not only exists but is being tested

at S-4.  And, if such technology is beyond human capabilities, it

must  have come from someplace else.  It's more than  conjecture,

he  says, because he also saw an element that cannot be found  on

the  periodic chart.  The element, called 115, can be  stored  in

lead  casings  much  like  this  one  [showing  a  lead  circular

container].  Lazar says the government has 500 pounds of it,  and

it cannot be made on earth.



Lazar:  "It would be almost impossible; well, it is impossible to

synthesize an element that heavy here on Earth."



Interviewer:  "At least right now."



Lazar:   "I  don't think that you can ever  synthesize  it.   The

amount of....you essentially have to assemble it by bombarding it

with protons if....atom by atom, it would take an infinite amount

of  power and an infinite amount of time.  The substance  has  to

come  from  a place where super-heavy elements  could  have  been

produced naturally.



     And what sort of place is that?



Lazar:   "Next to a much larger sun where there would be  greater

mass.   Maybe a binary star system -- a super-nova  --  somewhere

where  there  is just a bigger release of  energy  to  synthesize

these  things  naturally.   It has to be  a  naturally  occurring

element."



     115  is the fuel for the anti-matter reactors, he says.   By

bombarding  115 anti-matter is produced.  A kilo  of  anti-matter

could  produce the energy equivalent of 46  ten-megaton  hydrogen

bombs, and comparing the energy potential of anti-matter to, say,

the Hoover Dam would be like comparing planets to grains of sand.

115 could also make one heck of a bomb.



Lazar:   "We're talking about hundreds and hundreds  of  megatons

off  a  small  piece  of it.  It  sounds  incredible,  but  total

conversion  of  matter  to energy would release  that  amount  of

power.  And it isn't that difficult to take....get the energy out

of  it.  So it's not something you'd ever want to  fall  anyone's

hands."



     The  dangers associated with 115 and anti-matter may be  the

reason Lazar was hired to work at S-4.  There was an accident, he

says, back in April 1987.  An accident that was passed off as  an

unannounced nuclear test.



Lazar:   "Some people got killed.  I was told flat out I was  one

of the people that were to replace these guys."



     Is this why the government might be keeping the whole matter

a secret?  Because of the military potential of alien technology?

Lazar  says  he believes the Soviet Union was once  part  of  our

research  on  the  flying disks, but that  the  U.S.  kicked  the

Soviets  out  after  making  some sort  of  discovery.   He  also

believes  the program at S-4 is operated with funds allocated  to

Star  Wars  research,  but  says he can't  prove  it.   Some  UFO

researchers suspect the government is test flying alien craft  so

that  it can one day master the technology and claim it was  made

in  the good old U.S.A., thus obscuring the possibility of  alien

visitations.



Stanton  T. Friedman:  "I think they have the duty to inform  us.

At  least  to the bare bones of what's going on.   I  don't  want

technological  stuff put out on the table.  I mean, I  worked  on

classified  projects  for  15 years, and I don't  think  we  need

another  weapon's  delivery system.  But I think  the  government

does have the responsibility to release information that, indeed,

the  planet  is  being visited.  Probably it should  be  done  in

conjunction with the Soviets."



Lazar:   "I don't think that it will get to that level.   They're

not  going to have a fleet of them and fly them  around  and....I

don't think you need to do that.  If you're looking at them  from

a weapons point of view, you're looking at an incredibly powerful

device.   You only need one to operate.  You don't ever  need  to

come public with it.  You may want to learn more about it  should

it ever break which is....might be what they're doing.  Uh...."



Interviewer:  "They've got one...."



Lazar:  "Oh, they've got a few.  Yeah."



     Lazar  is  the  first to admit that his story  is  tough  to

swallow.   He  submitted  to  polygraph  exams  that  opened   up

sensitive  parts  of his personal life, and fully expects  to  be

ridiculed or perhaps punished for his revelations.  His desire to

explain  what  really happened at S-4 took us to  Layne  Keck,  a

licensed  experienced  hypnotherapist who quietly  and  privately

tried to help Lazar remember details of the many briefing  papers

he says he read.



Keck:   "I  have no clue as to what we were getting  to,  and  he

started  saying  that there were pictures of what I  thought  was

desks  on the wall.  Well as it turned out, it was disks that  he

was  referring to.  And, at that moment, I realized we were  into

something that was pretty heavy."



     Keck  does  not  exaggerate his  claims  for  hypnosis.   He

regards it as a useful tool for uncovering some lost memory.   He

says  people are quite capable of lying under hypnosis, but  says

the  technique can be of help in determining truth.   What's  his

opinion of Lazar's truthfulness?



Keck:   "It tells me that his subconscious mind believes  totally

all of these things."



     Lazar has long suspected that his government employers  used

some  sort  of  mind  control  technique  to  prevent  him   from

disclosing  too  much  about S-4.  While he  says  he  has  vivid

conscious memories of the saucers and other technology there were

other  memories, that even now, remained locked, which is why  he

sought  out  Keck  in the first place.  Keck  is  convinced  that

someone really did mess with Lazar's head.



Keck:  "Also they used primitive fear in threatening those in his

environment  if  he did bring this information forth.   Also,  it

appears that maybe there were some chemicals used."



Lazar:  "Nah, I'm not going to change anyone's mind.  That not my

intention.   I'm  just relaying the experience.  The job  that  I

went through.  It is a fantastic thing.  It's a fantastic  story.

I can't take people there to show them what was going on, and uh,

you know, I don't expect anyone to believe it."



     What  if he is right?  What if aliens are here?   How  would

this change our view of the world?  Our most fundamental beliefs,

which is religion?  We'll know more on that tomorrow.
