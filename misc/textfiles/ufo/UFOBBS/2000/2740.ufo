                          M.I.B. EXPERIENCE  -  1976 * 
                          ----------------------------

    In 1976   the journal "Flying Saucer Review"   published  a  series  of 
    articles about a UFO case in Maine.  A physician, Dr.  Herbert Hopkins, 
    had  been  one of the primary investigators in the case.   Hopkins  had 
    accumulated tapes and other documentation on the case and had performed 
    extensive hypnotic regression on the witnesses. 
     
    On  Saturday,  September 11,  1976,  at 8:00  p.m.  Hopkins received  a 
    telephone call from a man asking if he could come over and discuss  the 
    UFO case with him.  The man said he was associated with a UFO group  in 
    new  jersey.   The  man asked Hopkins if he was  home  alone.   Hopkins 
    responded he was.  Despite concerns about drug-related robbery, Hopkins 
    found himself agreeing to the request. 
     
    Although  Hopkins was a bit confused by his positive reply to the  man, 
    he walked to the back door to turn on the porch light.  When he got  to 
    the door,  the man was coming up the steps. This concerned Dr. Hopkins, 
    he could not figure out where the man could have called from and arrive 
    so quickly at his doorstep.  Still, Hopkins opened the door and let the 
    man in without even asking the man who he was or what he wanted. 
     
    The man's appearance was strange;  he was about 5'8"  tall,  no hair  - 
    completely bald,  had no eyelashes,  no eyebrows.  He was dressed in  a 
    neatly pressed black suit with a black derby and black shoes.   Hopkins 
    noticed  the  man was extremely pale,  but had ruby red lips.   Hopkins 
    noticed the man was wearing lipstick and grey gloves. 
     
    The man asked a number of questions about the Maine UFO case,  speaking 
    in a monotone voice and did not emphasize words in his sentences. 
     
    Suddenly,  the man told Hopkins that he had two coins in his pocket and 
    to  take one out and put it in his hand.  Hopkins only had two coins in 
    his pocket and he pulled a penny out. 
     
    The  man  told Hopkins to stare at the penny.  As he watched the  penny 
    became blurry and disappeared.  The man then asked Hopkins what he knew 
    of Barney Hill.  Hopkins said Barney died after a long illness. The man 
    told him he died because he knew too much. 
     
    Hopkins  was  taken  by fear at this point.  The man  told  Hopkins  to 
    destroy   all  his  notes,   tapes  messages  he  had  concerning   the 
    investigation  immediately.  The man stood up,  and began talking  much 
    slower. each word dragged as the man slowly walked to the door. Hopkins 
    opened the door for the man, and he walked down the steps very slowly. 
     
    Hopkins saw a light at the end of the driveway, and thought it was from 
    the man's car,  but the man walked in the opposite direction.   Hopkins 
    ran to a window to see where the man was going,  but he was not  there. 
    He ran to the door, looked out, but the man and the light were gone. 
     
    When his family returned, he and his son looked in their driveway,  and 
    they  found  a  series of four-inch wide tracks about  eighteen  inches 
    long.   They  were deep into the driveway and resembled tracks  from  a 
    tractor.   The marks disappeared the next day.  that evening,   Hopkins 
    destroyed his UFO records.
