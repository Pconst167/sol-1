    I  met with Mr.  German Marino on Sunday afternoon [12/29/91] to  speak 
    about  the  Colombian peasant who claims to have been abducted  by  ETs 
    this past April. Mr. Marino, who is a sociologist,  had the opportunity 
    to meet Mr. Luis Roberto Rodr¡guez on August 24, 1991. That was the day 
    when  the  peasant  made public his experience with ETs  and  read  one 
    message  addressed  to President Bush and another to  the  Cardinal  of 
    Colombia.   Rodr¡guez said that those messages had to be  delivered  in 
    person but since he was not able to achieve it,  ETs told him he should 
    make them public no later than August 24th. 
     
    The meeting was held in a rural town named Pacho.  It is located at one 
    and a half hours drive north of Bogota [Colombia's Capital City.] There 
    were about 3,000 people when the peasant made his speech.  Most of them 
    were  from other places of Colombia.  Mr.  Marino also learned that  at 
    least there were two journalists from abroad,  one from France and  the 
    other from Spain. 
     
    Rodr¡guez is a 37-year-old,  light brown complexion, black eyes, 5 feet 
    5   inches,   stocky build Colombian man,  who looked very healthy  and 
    radiant.   He  is literate and attended up to 4th grade  of  elementary 
    school.  He explained that ETs picked him up because he was found in  a 
    place which has a beneficial environment for them to make contact.   He 
    added  that anybody else could have been picked up,  should he  or  she 
    have  been  there at that time.  The peasant described  the  ship  that 
    transported him to what he thought was the moon,  as "a small  bottle." 
    He  also  said he was alert and aware for most of the time he spent  in 
    the  alien  world.   He added that he was left alone for a while  in  a 
    lighted  place but he could not see the source of the light.  When this 
    happened, Mr. Rodr¡guez said that he was able to see himself as he was, 
    to  become  cognizant of how he thought and acted.  He said  he  became 
    ashamed of himself but he did not explain why. 
     
    He was then taken to a larger room with a long table. There he saw many 
    beings  that  were  not  exactly human.  He described  them  as  having 
    different  sizes and heights.  However he was most impressed by the way 
    they  related  with each other.  He said there was peace and  happiness 
    among  those beings and he has never seen that on earth.  He added that 
    it was hard for him to describe it with words. 
     
    Another  detail  is related to Mr.  Rodr¡guez's health.  Prior  to  his 
    abduction  he  suffered from kidney stones and his doctor told  him  he 
    needed  an  operation.   When  he came back  his  kidneys  were  clear. 
    Furthermore,  he was implanted with a device in his right scapula.  The 
    peasant  explained  the  ETs operated twice on  his  body.   The  first 
    operation  was to remove the stones from his kidneys and to better  his 
    health.   The  second was to implant a device which was to be  used  to 
    facilitate ETs communications with him.  Mr.  Rodr¡guez was examined by 
    doctors  in the city of Medell¡n [Colombia.] They found him  physically 
    healthy and apparently they have also detected something strange in his 
    back. 
     
    The peasant insists that ETs have a plan scheduled by dates.  He  added 
    that he will release new messages in the future.  He also said that  he 
    receives  the messages telepathically.  He left copies of them  in  the 
    local Municipality. To get in contact with this place you can write to: 
     
    Alcald¡a Municipal de Pacho 
    Pacho, Cundinamarca 
    Colombia 
     
    NOTE: I spent near three hours talking with Mr. Marino.  He only speaks 
          Spanish.  I  had the impression he was telling the truth but what 
          he  told me is the best of his recollection of what he heard  the 
          peasant saying.  He said he will write to his friends in Colombia 
          requesting  printed  material  on this subject.   I'll  keep  you 
          posted.
