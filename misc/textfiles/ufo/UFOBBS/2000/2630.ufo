                                    Starship Engines

                                   By: Anthra Andromda

       Starship engines come  in  two  flavors;  for  strictly interstellar
       propulsion, and for  combined  interstellar/planetary   travel   and
       atmospheric use.  This  paper will treat the latter  of  these.  The
       engine described here   is   suitable  for  either  interstellar  or
       atmospheric travel.

       This engine is of a dual-mode design; it will optionally produce
       either gravitons or tachyons.

       ENGINE DESIGN

       The engine or  propulsion  unit  proper  consists  of  six  discrete
       elements (see fig. 1).

             1) the shield coil -  required to protect the crew/inhabitants
                    of the  ship  from any harmful radiation.   The  shield
                    itself is  a  high-power  electromagnet  operating in a
                    steady state (DC).

             2) the  exciter  coil  is  in   reality  an  auto-transformer,
                    operating much like a 'Tesla coil', but  at much higher
                    power levels,  voltages,  and frequency. Its purpose is
                    to excite the atomic  structure  of  the  core material
                    into production of either tachyons or  gravitons (these
                    two events   occur   at   different  power  levels  and
                    frequencies).

              3) This element is the 'pump',  its  operation is much like a
                    magnetic shock-tube.   It  will  start   and   maintain
                    movement of particles from the core in the direction of
                    the exhaust.


                                      Page 1





              4) The  focusing element. Here the responsibility is to shape
                    the particle stream into  something useful. This is the
                    element that can either make the basic  unit  an engine
                    or a weapon.

              5) The  core,  is  a stack of particle producers separated by
                    some insulating material.  In  a  dual  mode engine the
                    material for one kind of particle acts  as an insulator
                    for the other.

              6) Not  shown  in  the  figure is the control system, this is
                    normally a collection  of high speed computers and high
                    energy power control circuits.

       ENGINE SHIELDING

       The shield coil surrounding the 'engine unit' is  of  a  design that
       will allow for  the  development of high magnetic fields. This field
       is required especially in interstellar  propulsion;  tachyons can be
       very ionizing and therefore destructive.

       The magnetic shield can me made by using large gauge wire (low gauge
       numbers) and winding many turns.

       The gage of  the  wire is important here, as it will  determine  the
       amount of electrical current that the magnet can handle.

       If it is  at  all  possible,  the  use  of small diameter, insulated
       copper tubing may be used. By pumping  coolant  through  the  magnet
       larger fields may be generated.


                                      Page 2





       On the outside of the shield magnet a material such as 'mu-metal' or
       some other magnetic  shielding  should  be  used,  so  as to further
       shield the operators from the engine.

       This sub-system is probably the most difficult to build. While the
       construction of the magnet itself is not difficult, the power supply
       may be another matter.

       Electromagnets, by their   nature,   develop   a   field   that   is
       proportional to the  amount  of  current (amperes)  flowing  through
       them. Thus it is important to build a power source that can not only
       develop a sufficiently  high  voltage,  but  it must also supply the
       required current. This power should be as close to 'pure' DC (direct
       current) as possible.

       EXCITER COIL

       The exciter of the system is very much like the 'Tesla coil' or
       auto-transformer. As an example of an auto-transformer, I submit the
       television 'flyback' transformer.

       While these examples are by comparison crude, they will serve in the
       construction of a  model.  As in the  auto-transformer,  the  'turns
       ratio' is important.  The higher the ratio the greater  the  voltage
       that may be developed.

       Another important factor  here  is  the impedance of the sub-system.
       Since this will be working at high  frequencies  (several  megahertz
       for graviton production,  and 10 to 100 times higher  for  tachyons)
       the AC resistance  or  impedance  must  be  taken into account, this
       impedance must be kept to a
       minimum.

       This part of  the system, like the  shield,  does  its  job  by  the
       magnetic field it generates, therefore, the current flow through the
       exciter must be  as  high as possible, though not  as  high  as  the
       shield.

       Again the power  supply  is  important, it should be able to provide
       the necessary voltage (several hundred  volts)  at  moderately  high
       current levels (up to 30 amps).

       THE PUMP

       This element functions much like a 'magnetic shock  tube'  but again
       at high frequencies  (megahertz).   While  the power levels here are
       somewhat reduced, it is still important  to  have enough power to do
       the job.

       The function of the pump is to 'pull' quanta of either  gravitons or
       tachyons from the  'stack'  and  send  them  down  the length of the
       engine.

       This is done by setting up a traveling magnetic wave, see fig. 3 for
       a crude schematic of this pump. It  is  again  important to consider
       the impedance of this component.

                      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                      --------------------------------------->


       It will be  noticed that the input to this element is pulsed DC, and
       that the element is referred to as an AC element.

       The nature of this such that it functions in the following manner.

       When power is applied the capacitors  charge  in  turn  creating the
       effect of many smaller electromagnets stacked end to  end,  when the
       last capacitor in the chain is charged, power is removed, thus
       allowing the capacitors to discharge

              (high voltage/current diodes across each magnet element
                will allow for proper discharge of the capacitors).

       When the capacitors are discharged power is once again applied.

       Because of the nature of the pulsed DC and the current requirements,
       high speed switching  electronics  are  called  for  to control this
       element.

       FOCUSING ELEMENT

       The focusing element used here would be much like the 'yoke' used in
       television. The purpose here is to create a beam of particles and to
       'bend' that beam in the desired direction.

       The requirements for the focusing  coils  are  greatly relaxed, but,
       the need for high power still exists.

       CONTROL SYSTEM

       If this system were to be used only as a 'steady state demo' the
       requirements here would be small.

       Simple power supplies  and  switching  circuits would  be  the  only
       requirement. However, if  the  system  were to be used in a starship
       the requirements would change.

       In a flight situation the dynamic  control  of  'exhaust'  and power
       levels would exist. If used in a planetary mode, one  could probably
       'get away' with   using   something  like  a  personal  computer  (I
       personally would recommend at least a '386' based machine).

       However if used in interstellar flight  then  the  use  of something
       like a 'Cray' would be more in order (though I would doubt that even
       the fastest of machines known here on earth would suit).

       In an interplanetary mode, where one is not traveling  'faster  than
       light', again a PC (486) would probably work.

       So that's basically it. A suitable air/space frame for a ship and

                                      Page 4





       three of these  engines  and  one  could go 'star-hopping'. Though I
       would warn against 'faster than light'  travel  due to the 'unknown'
       factors involved.

       It has been said that when one attempts to travel faster  than light
       it must be  done  'smartly',  i.e.  the "jump to light speed". It is
       said that to  merely  accelerate   through   the  light  'limit'  is
       dangerous.
