                                    Evil 3.0


      To  recap.   Some  Contactees,  who believe that we  create  our  own 
    reality,   don't like discussions about the possibility of Evil aspects 
    of  the  Phenomenon,   because  they seem to believe  that  this  might 
    _influence_   other  Contactees  and  create  Evil  encounters.    Some 
    Contactees  don't even like to discuss this subject in  public  because 
    even  talking about the possibility of influencing a Contactee might be 
    enough  to  influence the Contactee.  The general thinking seems to  be 
    that We will simply keep this matter private and not worry your  little 
    heads about it.  After all you are not enlightened are you?  So how can 
    you possibly understand such things. It wouldn't be fair to you at all. 
    
      My  own  feelings,  perceptions and personal  experience  about  this 
    subject of influence is like everything else, complicated. 
    
      My  own perception of my own personal experience seems to be that one 
    can affect the phenomenon by how one thinks about it.  Now that is only 
    my  own personal belief.  I  could be way wrong.  If I were a  standard 
    Abductee  and someone told me that the reason I was having such a  hard 
    time with my Abductions was because I wouldn't let myself believe  that 
    the Greys or Nords were really great fellows,  I  believe I would STOMP 
    that  person  into the ground!  I  feel out of respect to  struggle  of 
    Abductees  that I need to say that.  I  am limited in my experience  in 
    that I am not an Abductee.  I have however had negative experiences, so 
    I  feel  that gives me a more balanced approach to the issue  than  the 
    Contactee who has never had a bad experience. 
    
      So  it seems that the Contactees I am talking about may be right.   I 
    may  be able to influence a Contactee.  But lets look at that a  little 
    closer.   Every day each and every one of us are bombarded with  issues 
    and  techniques designed to influence our thinking.  Some of  these  do 
    influence us,  some don't.  When you get right down to it anything that 
    influences me,  affects me, because at some level I allow it to happen. 
    Most  of this is done on a subliminal level,  but still some part of me 
    says "Yes!". I alone am responsible for what is inside my head. It's my 
    job to check out my head,  keep what I like and deal with the rest.  At 
    present  I  don't  seem  to be able to think of  any  other  reasonable 
    answer. 
     
      Is  the phenomenon EVIL?  Many Contactees have asked themselves  that 
    question  from  time to time.  I  believe that just about any  thinking 
    Contactee  might want to ask themselves that question.  It seems like a 
    fair question to me. 
    
      This  can be a touchy topic for a lot of Contactees.  Some Contactees 
    identify themselves to a large degree with the Phenomenon. So it's sort 
    of a "love me, love my Phenomenon." So to these Contactees, to question 
    the  Phenomenon  is to question _them_.  My usual response to  that  is 
    this,   "What  ever the Phenomenon is,  it certainly seems  capable  of 
    taking care of itself.  If I got a problem with you, that is between me 
    and  you.  If I got a problem with the Phenomenon that's between me and 
    the Phenomenon. So unless you are the Phenomenon, how about minding you 
    own affairs while the Phenomenon and I work this out?" 
    
      The  knee jerk defense of the Phenomenon is something one can see  on 
    the  echoes from time to time.  When speaking about Abductions  someone 
    might  point out that taking people against their will  and  subjecting 
    them  to  examinations  just might be a  little  unethical.   THEN  the 
    rationalization starts: 
    
      "They  aren't from around here so they don't have the same ethics  we 
    do." 
    
      (They  have  been here for about forty years,  seems like  they could 
    learn  our ethics.) 
    
      "Just think of what we would do if we caught one of them." 
    
      (Most Abductees have NEVER caught a Grey.) 
    
      "Think of all the times we have shot at their ships." 
    
      (Most Abductees have NEVER shot at a ship.) 
    
      "Look at our society, all the killing." 
    
      (Most Abductees aren't Killers.) 
    
      "Think of all the bugs you have stepped on in your life." 
    
      (With  all  due  respect,   I  don't  believe  bugs  are  capable  of   
    suffering the same sort of emotional trauma that Abductees go through.) 
    
      "They are here to help us." 
    
      (How do you know that?) 
    
      "Because they TOLD me." 
    
      (With all due respect,  you could make just about any  statement  you  
    wanted to about the Phenomenon and find a Contactee somewhere who could 
    tell you in all honesty that is what they TOLD him.) 
     
      Ah yes, but is the Phenomenon Evil? The truth is I don't know. I wish 
    I  could come up with some way to decide one way or the other.  One  of 
    the  points  that  Vallee makes is that when ever  one  encounters  the 
    phenomenon there is a sort of "Reality Exchange". 
    
      "Rather  than  a physical occurrence inside a  spacecraft,   did they 
    experience  a  temporary  translation of their  consciousness  into  an 
    altered  reality  followed by visions of archetypal creatures?   Is  it 
    possible  to  promote coincidences and peculiar effects  of  apparently 
    paranormal   nature  by  creating  physical  structures  shielded  from 
    everyday   noise   and   serving   as   informational   singularities?" 
    _Dimensions_ Jacques Vallee 1988 ISBN 0-345-36002-8 
     
    
      That is all well and good but it isn't something I can prove,  is it? 
    Whatever side one takes,  and I question why someone should be required 
    to pick a side at all,  you can make some good agurments for your case. 
    How- ever I don't believe any one can prove it either way. 
    
      What's  a poor Contactee to do?  I  guess I could just wait an  other 
    forty  years and hope that the U.F.O.  researchers will settle that one 
    for  me,   but the reality is I have a life to live and I can't  really 
    wait. I'll give you my answer to the puzzle. 
    
      Is the Phenomenon Evil?  I  don't know,  have no way of knowing,  may 
    never  have a way of knowing.  I  am still not sure what the Phenomenon 
    is, or how much self deremation it might pocess.  At present I bleieve, 
    at least in my own life,  that how I think about the process,  seems to 
    affect the encounter,  but I have no way of knowing what the degree  of 
    that affection might be. 
    
      So here is my resolution to the question. 
    
      If the Phenomenon is good,  than the best response to that is a  live 
    well lived. I must take responibility for my own actions and take steps 
    to make sue that I am not a burden to those around me.  I  must be part 
    of the answer, not part of the problem. 
    
      If  the  Phenomenon is Evil,  then the best response is still a  live 
    well  lived.   I   can't allow evil to infect my life  and  destory  my 
    happiness. I must strive for my wholeness. 
    
      If the Phenomenon is neither good or evil, or part good, part evil or 
    even netural, then the best response is STILL a live well lived. For me 
    it  answers the challange in the most productive manner.  Think back to 
    the  quote on Vasation.  James Sr.  was told it could be used  for  the 
    perpous of Transformation.  That is the "out"  for all Contactees.  Use 
    it,  don't abuse it,  or be abused by it,  or allow others to abuse you 
    because of it. 
    
      I  am not sure if this was the sort of response you were looking  for 
    John,  but it is honestly the best one I could come up with.  Thank you 
    for asking my opinnion and thank you for reading all of this. 
    
      take care!
