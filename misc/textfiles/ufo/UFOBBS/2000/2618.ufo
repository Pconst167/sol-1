 From: Phillipp Diehl

 Although I have stated previously that I am unable or unwilling to
 discuss material of "sensitive" nature, I am willing to discuss
 material that is of "public knowledge" that may (or may not) be being
 studied and developed by one of many groups within the US government,
 and/or may (or not) be technology associated with UFOs and/or secret
 government projects.

I am unable to give any details that might compromise the security of
 the government (or myself), as in, how I became knowledgable of this
 information, how it might pertain to governmental projects, how it
 might relate to UFO technology being studied, or the advancements and
 research that might still be classified by the government.
 
All the information that I shall present is of "public knowledge", and I
 have included some sources that may be helpful for those who might be
 interested in further research.
I will attempt to briefly touch on these subjects and attempt to lead
 you in a direction that with additional research and a logical
 approach, you might be able to come to your own conclusions.
ELECTROAERODYNAMICS: Electric charges are applied to high-speed vehicles
 for the purpose of reducing air drag or eliminating sonic booms.
 High-speed ions are projected forward from the leading edges of the

 craft, the corona glow propagates forward and repels air molecules away
 from the oncoming surfaces, thus a shock wave cannot be mechanically
 produced. Sources: Dudley, Horace C., Analog Science Fact & Fiction. "The
          Electric Field Rocket", November 1960.

          York, pp. 35-6, March 11, 1968.
          US Patent No. 3,095,167, Dudley.
COUNTERGRAVITATION: The sustaining of an object in space by means of a
 counter-gravitational effect produced through the action of an electric
 field upon the object. Associated with the effects of levitation in
 this manner, is a simultaneous appearance of a strange luminous halo
 that appears at about 500,000 volts.

Although I didn't give much information on these subjects, I hope it
 will be helpful in your investications and research into the UFO
 phenomenon. I will _attempt_ to answer any questions here, but don't
 know how much or little I should say. I'll also try to collect
 additional information on various subjects that might (or not) be
 related to, or on the border of being "sensitive" material, but can be
 documented as being "public knowledge".
Thanks for your time,

Gulf Breeze Update
"Bubba" Back in Dramatic Daylight Sightings
by Andy Abercrombie
With what may prove to be the BIG Story of 1993, the town of Gulf
Breeze, Florida, again steps into the UFO spotlight with a blockbuster
of a story... videotaped and still footage of a structured daylight
disk! No, this is not another Mexico City misidentification of theplanet Venus but, rather, what appears to be the "real thing" as boththe video and the Polaroid photo have been analized and proclaimed to begenuine by not only MUFON's Jeff Sainio , but optical physicist, Dr.Bruce Maccabee as well. As many of you know, since 1987, Gulf Breeze,Florida, has been nick-named the unofficial UFO capital of the world dueto the extraordinary  number of sightings that have been witnessed andrecorded there. The most famous photos were those taken by Ed Waltersand published in the book detailing his experiences, The Gulf BreezeSightings, in 1990. Until July of 1992, skywatchers had documented anaverage of 7 to 8 sightings a month... after that, the elusive UFO,affectionately named "Bubba," apparently disappeared for his 30,000light-year check-up.  But then toward the end of November , a few phonecalls were received saying that "Bubba" was back. These reports turnedout to be true, but the UFO's visits have become much less frequent.I've been told if the  Gulf Breeze Research Team is lucky, now they'llhave a sighting about once every two weeks, so the appearance of astructured craft during the daylight hours is a truly significantdevelopment. In a telephone interview with Bland Pugh, MUFON investigator and editorof the Florida MUFON News ( and creator of one of the finest red-beans-and-rice recipes in the Northern Hemisphere), the following factswere reported: On March 25, a Mr. Martin "Allen" looked up and sawsomething coming out of the northwest at a tremendous rate of speed. Hefirst thought it must be some type of aircraft he'd never seen before.
Later, the object reappeared and again moved toward him from the same
direction and toward the southeast. The next day, "Allen" set up his
video camera in hopes of recording  the object and that's exactly what
it did! Returning from having gotten an apple inside his house, he was
stunned to see the same UFO coming at him from the southeast. The camera
recorded the whole sequence as the UFO sped across the screen. In anarticle by Bland appearing in the June 9th issue of The Islander,"Allen"
said, " I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that round, silverthing racing across the sky. But, when it shot overhead a second time, I
knew it wasn't a normal airplane. By God, I knew it was that UFO that Iread  about in the newspaper! It was round and kind of crown-shaped witha lower level and a dark red circle in the bottom center." It was atthat point that Bland decided to enlist the aid of another MUFONinvestigator, Gary Watson, well known for his investigation of the EdWalters case. That decision proved to be a timely one as less than aweek later, on March 31, Bland said he received another call from"Allen." This time he said he had videoed the same UFO hovering out overthe Gulf of Mexico from his home on Santa Rosa Island. After beingrecorded for about 45 seconds, the UFO made an extraordinary exit to thesoutheast. Allen exclaimed, "It was fast, real fast! I videotaped it! Icouldn"t  believe this was happening and that it was happening in broaddaylight!" Bland told me that when he saw the tape that night, hecouldn't believe it either but, there it was... hovering with the sunreflecting off of it and the clouds moving behind it, sat the UFO. Theobject was silver in color and reflected the light of the sun. It seemedthat "Bubba" had definitely returned and, that without a hint ofshyness.      On April 2, Bland received yet another call from "Allen" saying that at  10:30 that morning, because the batteries on his video camera weren'tcharged, he'd photographed the UFO with his Polaroid camera! This timethe object had been hovering over the beach to the south of his home.Charles Flannigan, Florida State Director for MUFON, was now also calledinto the investigation, and the decision was made to forward the videosand Polaroid photo to Jeff Sainio, Photo Analyst and Manager of Imaging  Research and Development at the Quad/Tech division of Quad/Graphics in  Wisconsin. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, optical physicist for the U.S. Navaldefense lab in Maryland, was also contacted and both Sainio and Maccabeewere given the original of the Polaroid photo for analysis. After twoweeks of intensive tests and several calls for additional information,such as weather reports and atmospheric conditions, Jeff Sainiosubmitted his findings and returned the videos and photo to theinvestigative team. The results: The UFO is genuine and not a h ,n toits size eliminates all aircraft as a cause, since known airplanes can'tmove this fast. A 100-foot long fighter jet would need to move 300 feet,3 times its own length, in 1/30 second, or 9,000 feet per second orabout 6,000 mph. below clouds at 7,000 feet. To stay below the soundbarrier, a plane length of 10 feet would be required. Of the secondvideo, where the UFO is seen hovering motionless over the Gulf and thenflashes off, Sainio says in The Islander, "Initial calculations show the    UFO accelerated, then slowed 20% and then surpassed 2,000 mph, all inunder 1/10th of a second!" Dr. Maccabee's assessment of the March 24video states, "A frame -by- frame analysis shows that the object movedso fast it traveled several times its own length in each frame, makingrectangular images on the screen. It only took about one second to crossthe nearly 30* field of view of the camera. Unfortunately, the actualspeed cannot be determined because the distances are not known, butestimates range from several hundred to several thousand mphcorresponding to distance estimates of 1,000 to 10,000 feet."<< cont in next message >>Lazar and Element 115  From: Glenn Joyner

 Monday, September 6, 1993    SCIENTISTS MAKE ELEMENTAL DISCOVERY         U.S.-Russian team sheds new light on theories of atomic stability                    by Charles Petit - Chronicle Science Editor       Russian and American scientists are reporting that, using a powerful       cyclotron in a  lab  north  of  Moscow, they may have found a way to       break a scientific log jam blocking  efforts to make elements beyond       the 109 now known.       The new work suggests that extremely heavy elements,  virtually  all       of them man-made  and  never seen in nature, can be much more stable       than believed, making it easier to extend the list of elements.       The scientists did not make a new  element  but  say they did make a       handful of atoms of element 106 with an unprecedented number of the       subatomic particles called  neutrons  in their centers.   The  atoms       lasted as long  as  30  seconds  or even longer before spontaneously       disintegrating in radioactive decay.       Element 106, which has no formal name, was first reported nearly 20       years ago by  a  team  at the University  of  California's  Lawrence       Berkeley Laboratory, but the Berkeley version had  a  half  life  of       less than a second and also had few neutrons in its core.       "The goal  was  to  be  at  the limits of nuclear physics,  where       theory is stretched to the extreme of what we can understand,"       said Ronald Lougheed, a leader of  the  effort  and  chemist  at the       Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. "What our results indicate        is that things are  much  more  stable elements out there than the        usual theories would have predicted."       An element's atomic  number  refers  to  the  number of electrically       charged protons in its nucleus.  The nucleus also contains a similar       or larger number of neutrons, which  have  about  the  same  mass as       protons but no electric charge.       Since discovery of 106, German scientists have managed  after  great       effort to create  in  the laboratory elements 107, 108, and 109, but       each disintegrates in fractions of a second.       Worry had grown that elements heavier  than  109 might be impossible       to make.       If so, it would bring to an end an intellectual journey  to discover       all chemical elements  permitted  by  the  laws  of nature.  It is a       quest begun by  ancient civilizations  such  as  the  Greeks  -  who       believed all things are combinations of earth, air, fire, and water.       Modern science recognizes  92  natural  elements, from  hydrogen  at       number 1 through  uranium  at 92.  Since the 1940s, 17 more elements       have been created, including plutonium,  neptunium,  lawrencium, and       einsteinium that are even heavier.       Lougheed spoke during an interview at the laboratory  that  included       two members of  the  Russian  portion  of  the  collaboration,  Yuri       Lazarev and Vladimir Utyonkov of  the  Joint  Institute  for Nuclear       Research at Dubna, some 90 miles north of Moscow.   The results were       first described to  a small meeting in Finland in the spring and are       being submitted to publication in  the  journal  Physical  Review C.       Lazarev is also  leading  a  symposium  on  them this  week  at  the       Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.       Although preliminary, the work inspires intense excitement among the       relative handful of scientists who still pursue the hunt for ever-       heavier, more exotic elements.       "Boy, I hope they are right.  This gives a whole new twist to it       (theories of atomic stability).  I would get busy right now if I       had a machine to work with,"       said Albert Ghiorso, a senior Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory physicist       who has been  a  major figure in creation of man-made elements since       the 1940s.       There is no sure practical payoff to the research.        Lazarev said, however, that the behavior of atomic nuclei under the       extreme stress created  by  interaction   of  so  many  protons  and       neutrons will help scientists understand the nature  of  more common       elements.       The scientists base their conclusions on only a small bit of data.       They ran the  cyclotron,  a  form of subatomic particle accelerator,       for 16 straight days in April.   Its  intense  beam  of  neon nuclei       slammed into a  target  of  curium.   The hope was  that  among  the       trillions of collisions,  a  few  neon and curium nuclei would merge       into an isotope  of  element  106   with   160  neutrons  that  some       scientists hypothesized might be unusually stable.       The evidence of success came from measuring decay products, called       alpha rays, released by atoms as they decay.  Only  four  alpha rays       of the computed  energy  were detected.  Factoring in the efficiency       of the Livermore-supplied detector,  the  scientists  estimate  they       made about 150 neutron-rich atoms of element 106.       "We were at the extremes of what is possible with  both  U.S. and       Russian physics," Lazarev said.  "These experiments are terribly       hard."       The U.S. Department  of  Energy  recently  ordered a shutdown of the       only remaining accelerator  in  Berkeley,  the  super-Hiliac,  which       would have been able to confirm or extend the work.
