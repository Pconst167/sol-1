Case Description:
                                                            
                                                            
On Tuesday, August 25, 1992, a Durant resident called the
Oklahoma MUFON State Director at 11:30 p.m. and stated that
herself and a number of witnesses were watching a brightly lit
object to their west and had been doing so since about 11:00 that
night.  She described in detail what they were seeing.           

                                        
The first witness observed the object when he had gone to bed. 
The time was 10:51 p.m.  He looked out the west window of his
home which was open with the shades up.              
                                                            
When he first saw the object, he thought it was a plane.  But
when it moved fast, from one position to another, behind a tree
to another opening between the trees, he then realized that it
was not a conventional aircraft.  It moved too fast too quickly
to be an airplane.                     
                                                            
The couple had company over, and the husband (first witness)
yelled for the others in the house to watch the object.  He said
that it jumped to the right and stopped, swung like a pendulum
back and forth, and then stopped motionless.       
                                                            
The others came to the bedroom to see the object, then proceeded
to move outside.  Witness number 2 (wife) saw the object and
described it to be about 1 1/8 inches across at arms length (a
circular oval template was used to judge the size of the object).

She saw it when it was angled towards her and saw a portion of
the bottom of the object, which was described as darker.         

                             
According to her statement, the object was conical with light
rays emitting down from the bottom edge.  It was shaped like the
top of a bullet - pointed at the top, then extending down and
outward to form an umbrella shape, but more of a pointed umbrella
shape.  It was flat on the bottom.  No protrusions were noticed. 
She said that she could see the shape when she looked to the side
of the object.  She had glasses on and they are corrected for
nearsightedness.                                            
                                                            
Witness number 3 entered the husband's bedroom as the husband
stated" You ain't going to believe this, but this is not a star. 
That is something else."                       
                                                            
The light was moving in an erratic manner.  When the husband went
outside and regained sight of the object, it appeared as a
definite conical shape.  Unlike the wife's report, which stated
that the object was all white, the husband reported three colors
- blue on top, yellow in the middle and white on the lower third.

                                                            
The husband's account and drawing indicated a more elongated
object with basically the same shaped top (more like an artillery
shell).  His account indicates that at arms length, the object
was about 3/4 inches wide and about 1 1/8 inches tall.  It is
possible that they were watching it change shape.                

                                                            
Each witness was interviewed separately.                    
                                                            
Witness number 2 described the light emitted by the craft
resembled an inverted gas flame on a kitchen range.  The bottom
was darker than the rest of the craft, but her report indicates
the object must have either been tilted slightly or was higher
when she looked at it than when witness number 3 saw the shape. 
She stated it was a pendulum motion or possibly rotated.         

                                                            
Witness number 4 stated that she was not wearing prescription
glasses at the time of the sighting, as she was required to wear
them normally, but she could see the light.  She corroborated
what the others had said.                  
                                                           
They were asked if they had read any material on UFOs, they all
replied they had not.  When asked if they watched TV and seen any
of the Unsolved Mysteries, Hard Copy, etc. shows on UFOs they all
replied yes.                                  
                                                            
The witnesses were credible, each having a college background,
and had nothing to gain from the report.  Based on what was said
and the statements of each person, the evidence looks reliable
and valid.                          
                                                            
(Note: This case is similar to a case in September, 1976, that
occurred in Tehran City, Iran.)
