        We  must assume our existence as broadly as we  in  any
        way  can;  everything,  even the unheard-of,   must  be
        possible in it. This is at bottom the only courage that
        is  demanded  of  us:   to have courage  for  the  most
        strange, the most inexplicable.

Research suggests that abductions (in the current ufological sense) may
have begun as early as the late nineteenth century.1

A  controversial  analysis  of  the data from  three  national  surveys
conducted  by  the Roper Organization in 1991  suggest that one out  of
every 50 adult Americans may have had an abduction experience.2

In  the same report,  5%  of the sample population reported  that  they
remember UFO imagery in their dreams.

According  to  the Fund for UFO Research,  there are  more  than  1,000
abduction cases now reported, with more coming in all the time.3

The Mutual UFO Network is sponsoring an on-going program of data-basing
new abduction reports for future statistical analysis.

Regardless of the exact numbers,  all indicators point to an internally
consistent   experience  that  is  occurring  world-wide,   with   ever
increasing frequency of incidence.

Abductees are often deeply traumatized by their experiences.  Lives are
changed forever. Political and social beliefs are reversed, or at least
altered.   Abductions  and all UFO phenomena challenge our  notions  of
reality and truth.

In  this  article  I  will take an interdisciplinary  approach  to  the
subject of UFO and related phenomena and argue that only by  stretching
the  boundaries  of traditional scientific inquiry will we be  able  to
make headway in our understanding of these experiences.

I will build three hypotheses.  Together,  they support the thesis that
at  least  part  of  UFO and related phenomena may  be  a  creation  of
humankind, and at the same time very real (tangible) events.

The  first hypothesis contends that UFO phenomena,  culminating in  the
abduction experience,  may be a product of latent metanormal4 abilities
inherent to homo sapiens. While latent in most individuals,  the stress
of the combined anxieties of our time may be activating these abilities
on a collective, if unconscious, level with strength enough to manifest
simi- real events.

The  second  hypothesis  argues that the abduction  experience  can  be
analyzed as an allegorical narrative where each stage of the experience
(as developed by David M.  Jacobs, Ph.D. in Secret Life5) is a metaphor
for a specific collective anxiety.

The  third  hypothesis suggests that hypothesis one and hypothesis  two
are   informed  by  an  emerging  world-culture  which  represents   an
evolutional leap in consciousness.


                                  ***


Among ufologists and abduction researchers, explanations have generally
fallen into psychosocial (or cultural)  and literalist extraterrestrial
categories.  UFO and related phenomena play havoc with this traditional
dualality.

Psychosocial hypotheses, at least in the Western materialist sense, are
seriously  flawed.  Unless we are willing to extend our notions of  the
powers  of  the  psyche to include 1.)  physical  traces  appearing  on
abductees,  such as cuts and bruises,  2.)hundreds of highly  elaborate
and traumatic experiences similar to one another in minute detail among
individuals who have not communicated with one another, and 3.)  all of
the  physical  phenomena  associated with the  UFOs  themselves,   such
explanations  are clearly inadequate.  There are often explanations for
one or to facets of a UFO related occurrence. Usually,  no explanations
take  into  account  all aspects of a single complex event such  as  an
abduction experience.

At  the same time a literalist extraterrestrial hypothesis must account
for  1.)  the relative paucity of solid physical information,  2.)  the
high  level  of  apparent absurdity that  is  characteristic  of  these
experiences  and 3.)  the seemingly insurmountable problems related  to
accounting  for the origins,  culture and motive the aliens  themselves
within the framework of scientific inquiry.

The  Western  mind  is not well suited to dealing with  phenomena  that
straddle traditional boundaries. The orientation of Western culture and
consciousness  has been dominated by materialism,  rationalism and  the
scientific  method,  that is,  toward reductionism and analysis  rather
than synthesis. Thus, our age is one of ever-increasing specialization.
One finds evidence  of  this in modern scholarship and in science. Such
experts  tend  generally  to regard fields other than  their  own  with
indifference  or  suspicion.   Therefore,   experts in  a  given  field
typically  have  little acquaintance with  knowledge  produced  outside
their own scholarly or scientific domain. Eclectic or interdisciplinary
research is often discouraged as being too speculative.

History,    knowledge  and  reality  itself  cannot  be  segmented  and
compartmentalized according to more or less arbitrary pigeonholes.  Any
responsible  researcher must,  like a detective,  pursue whatever clues
come  to hand,  however seemingly improbable.  One should  not  dismiss
material simply because  it threatens to lead into alien territory. One
must  be flexible,  able to move freely between disparate  disciplines.
One  must  be  able to link data and make connections  between  people,
events,  and phenomena widely divorced from each other.  In short,  one
must  synthesize.   Finally,  it is not sufficient to  confine  oneself
exclusively   to  facts.   One  must  discern  the  repercussions   and
ramifications  of  facts.   We  must proceed  with  both  prudence  and
imagination and thus, adopt a posture supportive of intuitive leaps.

Regarding  UFO  phenomena,   noted UFO researcher Dr.   Jacques  Vallee
believes  that  "...we  are dealing with a yet  unrecognized  level  of
consciousness...(and)...that  an understanding  of the  UFO  phenomenon
would  come only when  we  expanded our  view of the physical  universe
beyond  the  classic  four-dimensional  model  of  spacetime."6    Jung
speculated that UFOs are archetypal responses to "vital psychic need".7

As we regard UFO phenomena culminating in the abduction experience,  we
need to embrace a wide range of inquiry: from modern abduction research
to  the  sacred traditions East and West;  from scientific  studies  of
mystical cognition and other metanormal abilities,  to modern religious
studies;   from  anthropological studies of shamanism to mythology  and
evolution.

The following array of information is necessarily complex.  I offer the
following  outline as a guide through material that may otherwise  seem
convoluted.

First we will take a brief tour of abduction history. I will argue that
this  experience need not necessarily be taken at face value.  We  will
look  at  the  complexities that  confound  traditional  approaches  to
solving this enigma.

Next,  we must gain a basic understanding of the field of  metaphysics.
We  will take a look at evidence for metanormal abilities in humankind,
and list the abilities relevant to hypothesis number one, above.  There
is  ample  evidence to show that nothing is happening in the  abduction
experience that humans are not able to manifest themselves.8

Hypotheses  number  two  and  three must have  sociological  frames  of
reference.  Therefore we will turn to the works of Carl Gustov Jung and
Joseph Campbell.

Finally,   I  will demonstrate a allegorical analysis of the  abduction
narrative,  and suggest the relevance of this experience to our  unique
place in history.

In his Religio Medici, English essayist Thomas Browne characterized man
as "that great and true amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not
only  like  other creatures in diverse elements,  but  in  divided  and
distinguished worlds."9

I  believe  it  is possible that UFO and related  phenomena  calls  our
attention  to  a  new  era - one in which,  like  amphibians,   we  are
maintaining  access to our present reality as we venture into  a  world
that will subsume the old one.

There  is  precedent for such a cultural process.   Hegel  suggested  a
process  which suggests both annihilation and preservation to  describe
the frequent subsumption of cultural forms by their successors.  In the
dialectic of history,  he  claimed, earlier kinds of human behavior and
consciousness have been "lifted up"  to higher levels.10  Evidence  for
such  a  process is all around us.  The UFO enigma may provide a  large
body of such evidence.  A  brief overview of applicable UFO research is
in order.

                        The Abduction Experience

As far back as the 1960s,  John A. Keel revealed his discovery that the
majority  of all UFO witnesses had latent or active psychic  abilities.
Other investigators around the world confirmed his research.  Now it is
known  that  abduction experiencers also often subsequently  experience
other paranormal phenomena.

In 1966  John Fuller changed the UFO scene forever with his Interrupted
Journey,  the now-familiar story of Barney and Betty Hill,  who claimed
that  aliens  removed them from their automobile,  gave  them  physical
examinations,   and then released them.  The psychiatrist who had  used
hypnosis with the Hills to bring out the mainly forgotten story thought
the case was an example of shared dream.

Researchers had collected a few more abduction cases in the 1970s,  but
they  were  so seemingly different from one another that it was  almost
impossible to decipher the facts. Virtually all abductees suffered from
a form of amnesia that prevented them from remembering exactly what had
happened  during the abduction.  The preferred technique for retrieving
these  lost  memories was hypnosis,  but it was common  knowledge  that
memories collected in this manner were not reliable.

At  first,   abductions appeared to be an isolated phenomenon that  had
occurred  to just a few people around the country.  Now we know this is
not the case.

Since the late 1970s Bud Hopkins had specialized in examining abduction
cases, and his first book, Missing Time, was published in 1981. In this
pioneering work, he investigated a small group of people who he thought
might  have  had  abduction  experiences.   Using  a  psychologist   to
administer  hypnosis,  Hopkins collected data much more  systematically
than  had  been done before.  New data came to light:  lapses in  time,
mysterious scars,  bizarre physical examinations,  and screen memories.
Hopkins theorized a possible generational link between parents who were
abductees and their children.  During this time David M. Jacobs, Ph.D.,
a  history  professor,   began  to  do  research  into  the   abduction
phenomenon.   As  a  historian,   Jacobs was interested  in  trying  to
establish an  abduction narrative with a beginning, middle and end.  So
far, the bits and pieces of  information  gleaned  from  the  few cases
researched remained frustratingly disconnected.

In  1987   Dr.   Thomas E.  Bullard published a massive  study  of  270
published  abduction  cases.  With careful analysis Jacobs was able  to
show  numerous  structural similarities between the cases,  but in  his
words,   "Most researchers still did not understand the implications of
the new data."11

Jacob's found that even though most of the abductees did not know  each
other,  they all told the same stories:  they were abducted by strange-
looking  beings,   subjected  to  a  variety  of  physical  and  mental
"procedures,"   and then returned to the site of abduction.   Abductees
were powerless to control the event, and, when it was over, they nearly
always forgot most of it.  These people were left with the feeling that
something had happened to them,  but they were not sure exactly what it
was.

The  events  that the abductees related seemed completely  implausible.
Time after time they would describe apparently absurd situations,  such
as  being  floated  through  a  closed window at  the  hands  of  small
creatures.

Nevertheless,   Dr.  Jacobs was intrigued by the convergence of  minute
detail, the multiple abductions, and other witnesses.  He began his own
hypnotic sessions,  taking care (says he) to avoid the typical problems
with data retrieved by hypnotic regression.  In 1992  he publish a book
containing  the  results of his work called Secret Life.  Jacob's  work
provides  us with the most complete abduction narrative to date.   Many
others continue with other large scale comparisons of data.

Dr.   Jacobs  found patterns in his subjects"   descriptions  of  their
experiences.   These  patterns  consist of  what  he  calls  "primary,"
"secondary," and "ancillary" experiences.12 Later, we will come back to
these designations.

Whether  or not UFO and related phenomena are real in the usual  sense,
the people who have these experiences suffer real pain.  They seemed to
suffer  from  a combination of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  and  the
after-effects of rape. Interestingly, however, these "experiencers", as
they have come to be called,  are also sometimes profoundly moved,   as
outlined above. This may be the key point.

Abductions  are  not  confined  to  the  United  States.   British  UFO
researcher  Jenny Randles has catalogued many abductions in the  United
Kingdom.   The same material seems to be coming out of those  accounts.
Evidence points towards world-wide phenomena.13

With certain exceptions,  abductions can occur anywhere. They happen in
rural settings and in cities. Being with other people is no deterrent.

According  to Jacobs and others,  and if we are to take  abductions  at
face  value,   the  "aliens"  want to use the ability  humans  have  to
recreate themselves.  They seem to want to achieve some kind of  hybrid
species of being. They want knowledge of our mental and nonreporductive
physiological processes.  They are curious about how humans function in
society.   They  don't seem interested in disclosing  much  information
about the technicalities of what they are doing.  When they do offer is
often absurd by traditional measures. The "aliens"  seem confident that
we are unable to stop them.

By  far  the  most  common types of entities  reported  are  the  short
statured,  and so-called "Greys." Also reported frequently are similar,
but  somewhat  taller Greys.  The small beings are thin,  slight,   and
hominoid  in  appearance.  Taller beings stand from two to  six  inches
above  the  small  beings  and  also  share  the  same  gross  physical
characteristics with humans. The taller beings seem to be in charge.

Descriptions  of the aliens"  skin color varies but is usually reported
to  be  grey,  hence the moniker.  The skin color is uniform,   without
darker and lighter spots or areas. According to Jacobs,  it is reported
that alien skin is extremely smooth, without the pores, hair, freckles,
warts and other common elements found on human skin.

Abductees are often vague about what these grey aliens wear, or even if
they are wearing anything at all. Sometimes the color of their skin and
the color of their clothes are reported to be exactly the same.  Though
different descriptions exist, the overall impression is of nondescript,
tight-fitting, seamless outfits.

Usually, their faces do not betray a readily detectable uniqueness that
might distinguish one from another.  Nor do they seem to have any overt
sort  of  emotional characteristics that can be seen  on  their  faces.
According to Jacobs,  when abductees have had experiences for thirty or
forty years with presumably the same group of aliens,  they report that
the aliens  look the same during the last experience as they did during
the first.

The  heads of the creatures are,  in human  terms,   disproportionately
large for their bodies.

While hominoid,  the alien face has many divergent characteristics. The
huge eyes are the single most striking feature. They are largest in the
center and taper off to a tip on the side of the head.  They contain no
pupils, irises, or corneas. Abductees see black, usually opaque organs.
The majority of the  reports  indicate these beings have no more than a
slight  raised  bump where a human nose would be,  but no  nostrils  or
openings.   According to Jacobs,  the aliens"  slit-like mouth does not
seem to have teeth,  tongue,  or saliva.  The entities do not use their
mouths for communication.  These creatures do not appear to have a  jaw
or jaw hinge below where the ears would be. Aliens sometimes may have a
small raised feature where human ears would be, but without an opening.

The head is attached to an extremely narrow, short,  tubelike neck that
seems too thin to support the head's weight. The head does not fit onto
the neck as human heads would.  The arrangement reminded one of Jacob's
abductees of "a pumpkin on a stick."

The  entities feature long,  thin arms with no apparent musculature  or
boniness.  The arms are apparently the same diameter from the  shoulder
to where the hands join, without visible wrists.

The alien's short, thin legs go straight down with no sense of a thigh,
calf,  or ankles.  They blend smoothly with the feet.  Little is  known
about the feet, but toes are not usually noticed.

In short, except for the fetal-like overall stature and the huge, black
eyes, these beings give an impression of something like a mannequin. My
point is,  they can otherwise be seen as the perfect "generic hominid,"
right  down to the gray color.  One would almost expect to find a  bar-
code somewhere on each model.

These three general characteristics - large, opaque-black eyes, overall
fetal-like stature,  and generic appearance,  may each have a  symbolic
meaning. These meanings will be dealt with below.


                                  ***


Not  everyone  agrees that the abduction experience should be taken  at
face  value.   In  the  words of  Jacques  Vallee,   stories  of  alien
crossbreeding are so "scientifically ludicrous that (they do)  not even
deserve to be refuted...It reveals a dramatic lack of information about
the current state of the art in genetic engineering."14

Even  with  our  apparently  "primitive"   knowledge  of  medicine   by
comparison,  humans could use simpler procedures that would yield  more
accurate  results without leaving scars.  As Vallee notes,  "Any doctor
today can draw one cubic centimeter of blood without leaving a scar  or
mark.  From the analysis we could determine if the patient used to have
a Siamese cat as a pet when he was six years old! Molecular biology,  a
science  in  its infancy,  is already capable of  providing  incredible
amounts  of information from minute amounts of human cells.   In  vitro
fertilization  has  reached  a level such that  the  so-called  genetic
experiments  allegedly performed in UFOs seem ludicrous and  grotesque.
The ufonauts should go back to medical school."15

In addition one might ask,  why hasn't their data-gathering become more
sophisticated over the decades? As far as we can tell it hasn't changed
since Betty and Barney Hill were abducted in 1961.

And finally, even humans can erase a subject's memory beyond any chance
that a hypnotist could retrieve any information at all about the event.
Yet,   even an amateur hypnotist can re-  cover previously  locked-away
memories of abductions.

Nevertheless,   these "aliens"  demonstrate that they actually  have  a
highly detailed knowledge of human psychology,  physiology and anatomy.
Abductee reports show that the aliens can completely control the  human
nervous  system.  For instance,  abductees are routinely paralyzed  and
placed  in  suspended animation.  The mere touch of an alien  hand  can
block  a  person's perception of pain.  There are  reports  of  instant
healings,   altered  memory,  and distortion of an abductee's sense  of
time.

Some  conclude that very real beings are staging simulated  operations,
very  much  in  the  manner of gorilla  theatre.   Others  decide  that
abductions   are   complete  fantasies  drawn   from   the   collective
unconscious,   perhaps  instigated by some metaphysical trigger.  In  a
recent  article16  Carl Sagan would have us believe that all  abductees
are  hallucinating.   None  of  these  theories  alone  are  completely
satisfactory.

Some researchers, including Vallee,  have noted the resemblance between
UFO encounters and the initiation rituals of  secret  societies.  It is
true that a typical initiation ritual matches perfectly with the stages
of an  abduction  experience as described by Jacobs and others. We will
return to this theme below.

The apparent absurdity of UFO and related experience is another  factor
to be dealt with.  The phenomenon often contradicts itself. Some of the
principles  demonstrated,  some of the information conveyed seem  true;
some are apparently false. In attempting to determine which material is
true one is frustrated by a kind of "absurd logic."

There  is  a  persuasive argument that absurdity is designed  into  UFO
experiences  in order to permit thought transference while the mind  is
confused.17   Remembering  that the abduction experience seems to  have
arrived  at a grand,  world-wide scope,  one might wonder,  could  this
confusion technique deliberately be used to change the consciousness of
humankind on a major scale?

If  one  were  to strive to convey a truth that lies  just  beyond  the
understanding   of   ones  audience,   one  must   construct   apparent
contradictions in terms of ordinary meaning.  In striving to make sense
of  the  contradictions,   one's understanding is challenged.   If  one
embellishes  the process by constructing a complicated narrative  that,
for  instance,   enigmatically  mingles  both  elements  of  Newtonian-
Cartesianism realism with apparent absurdity, and in this way draws the
audience into a search for a deeper meaning, this is allegory.

Allegory  has long been used as a tool through which authors have side-
stepped  the  Church,  State,  even the intelligentsia,  to plant  deep
within  societies  far-reaching doubts concerning  basic  philosophical
tenets.  Information issued forth this way has a profound effect on the
collective   consciousness.    Like  allegory,   UFO  experiences   are
compelling, yet also sufficiently absurd to be formally "unbelievable".
Events  structured  in this way cannot avoid striking deep  within  the
psyche, while keeping rationalists at a distance.

Vallee  suggests that human belief is being controlled and  conditioned
by  these  alien  conspirators.18  If the hypothesis  is  true,   these
manifestations  could be "not unlike a thermostat in a house."19   UFOs
may   serve   to  stabilize  the   relationship   between   humankind's
consciousness  and  the  evolving complexities of the world we  try  to
understand.

Vallee  pointed out that it is interesting to observe that the  pattern
of  UFO  flaps (periods of intense UFO activity)  has the same  general
structure as that of a schedule of reinforcement, even after accounting
for  the  affect  of   media exaggerations on these patterns.  The best
schedule  of  reinforcement  is  one  that  combines  periodicity  with
unpredictability. Learning is then slow but continuous. It leads to the
highest level of adaptation. And it is irreversible.20

There  is  an  observable change in our culture.  Many have  noted  the
increasing willingness to believe in extraterrestrial life.  Television
programming  includes  more and more shows about UFOs  and  abductions.
More feature length films are being made about the issue,  such as  the
recent Fire in the Sky, based on the Travis Walton abduction. Attitudes
have changed among scientists too.  There is the renewed SETI  program,
for  example.   Psychologists  are  beginning  to  take  the  abduction
experience  seriously.   Are these signs of a shift in  our  collective
mythological  structure?  Is the human learning curve bending toward  a
new  cosmic  point  of  view?  Perhaps when  irreversible  learning  is
achieved,  the UFO phenomenon will go away. Or, perhaps we will witness
further, and more straight forward manifestations. The effects could be
far reaching,  for like evolution itself,  these learning curves may be
measured in terms of centuries.

If UFOs are acting at the mythic and spiritual level,  it will be  next
to  impossible to make much headway with a strictly empirical approach.
Spirituality  and mythology rule at a level of our social reality  over
which normal intellectual pursuits have little real power.

Modern  science  maintains  that the two major approaches  to  inquiry,
which  might  be  termed  technological  and  psychological,   must  be
carefully separated. At the same time, the concept of "spirit" has been
set  aside for those of a somewhat naive mentality.  The UFO phenomenon
is a direct affront to these artificial separations.

No  theory  of  UFOs can be complete unless it addresses  the  need  to
integrate somehow abduction narratives based on alien technology into a
meaningful social framework.

No  theory  of  UFOs can be complete if it does  not  account  for  the
reported   metaphysical  effects  produced  during  these  experiences.
Effects  such as objects that can shape-shift,  disappear and re-appear
seemingly at will,  or move in a way that defies the laws of physics as
we   currently  know  them.   Effects  such  as   apparent   telepathic
communication  with ufonaughts,  and abducting greys who  walk  through
walls and spirit away their victims through closed windows.

Obviously,   the evidence goes beyond the notion that these are  simply
technological vehicles produced by advanced races on another planet, at
least by our current notions of technological. And we can not afford to
ignore the social impact of UFO and related phenomena.

Only  an  interdisciplinary  approach could account  for  the  physical
effects,   for  the  impact  on society,  for  the  appearance  of  the
occupants,  and for the seemingly absurd,  dream-like elements of alien
behavior.

                 The Case for Uncommon Human Capacities

Metanormal functioning is no longer only a topic of tabloid journalism,
so-called  New  Age  revelers,  and quaint parlor  room  gatherings  of
neighborhood  spiritualists.   Though  many  scientists  and   academic
philosophers still argue that paranormal events do not occur, there now
exists  considerable  evidence for such events  provided  by  competent
researchers.  Experimental data produced by parapsychologists have been
presented in several credible journals for more than 50 years.21

If  we  look  closely  at the  evidence  for  metanormal  abilities  in
humankind,   we will find that nothing is going on in UFO  and  related
phenomena  that  humankind  has  not demonstrated as  one  of  its  own
abilities. No strange feats of mobility, communication, or manipulation
of  environment  witnessed  in the UFO experience are  beyond  our  own
powers.

Because  we harbor capacities such as those described below,  it is not
unreasonable  to  think  that,   in spite of our  tendency  to  destroy
ourselves,   we  may  even  be  involved  in  a  kind  of  evolutionary
transcendence.

The  discoveries  of  modern science give us a new perspective  on  the
world and our human capacities.  In the context of evolution,   "...our
planet has been revealed not as a static or cyclical world,  but as  an
arena  in which graduation upon graduation of species have occurred for
several  hundred million years.  This stupendous advance suggests  that
humans might develop further." Indeed,  evolution "...has even exceeded
its own bounds before - as, for example, when life arose from inorganic
matter and humankind from its primate ancestors..."22

Space  does  not allow a thorough investigation of each phenomenon  and
the scientific proof for its existence.  In his book The Future  of the
Body23,   Michael Murphy has listed human attributes that  characterize
this  emergent level of development.  The reader may choose to  examine
for  him  or  herself the pages  of  Murphy's  exhaustively  researched
masterpiece.   Following  are examples of  the  classes  of  developing
attributes  that apply to the hypothesis that the  abduction experience
is a metanormal creation of humankind:

Perception of External Events -

"Feeling" people in a house though you cannot see or hear them.

Spontaneous, unexpected perceptions of distant events.

Sensing  a numinous presence during meditation,  intimate conversation,
or other circumstances.

Seeing lights around people or inanimate objects for which there are no
apparent sources.

Spontaneously  apprehending the presence of someone physically  distant
or dead, by direct and vivid contact.

Communication Abilities -

Correctly  intuiting  someone's  (negative or  positive)   feelings  or
thoughts about you or a third party.

Telepathically  stimulating  feelings  loving or  hateful,   serene  or
agitated moods in another person.

Saying something unexpected in unison with someone else.

Sensing  correctly  who is calling on the telephone,  even  though  the
caller  hasn't communicated for a long time,  or thinking about someone
who then calls you.

"Feeling" what someone else is thinking. Having the same dream a friend
does.

Movement Abilities -

Experiencing flight as if in a subtle body,  during an especially vivid
dream or state of creative absorption.

Out-of-body  experience (during which you may see your own body)  after
which  you  report events that could not be known to  you  in  ordinary
circumstances.

Experiencing  an  extraordinary pleasure in movement accompanied by  an
apparent  release of new energies in particular body parts.  (Note  the
similarity to abilities reported in the Andreasson case,   exhaustively
researched by Rayhmond E. Fowler and presented in his Book Watchers).

Pain and Pleasure -

Eliminating pain by simply willing it away.

Cognition -

Correctly sensing unexpected danger.

Apprehending  an exceptionally complex and original set of ideas all at
once, in conjunction with great excitement and joy.

Remembering extremely complex material with perfect detail.

Correctly  determining  historical events connected with  a  particular
location or object, as if by some sort of clairvoyance.

Experiencing a sense of mystical contact with God, perhaps at work,  or
during a festive event,  or while engaged in intimate conversation,  or
in the midst of suffering.

Volition -

Waking  from  sleep at a designated moment without assistance  from  an
alarm.

Spontaneously exerting subliminal influence upon others in such ways as
harmonizing conflicting parties,  bringing peace to potentially violent
situations, or -conversely- causing discord and suffering.

Individuation and Sense of Self -

Awakening  to  a  witness  self that  is  fundamentally  distinct  from
particular thoughts, impulses, feelings, or sensations.

Feeling for a moment as if your body is only a small part of  yourself,
or that it is located at a specific point in the field of awareness.

Experiencing an identity that self-evidently existed before your  birth
and that will outlast your body's death.

Bodily Structures, States, and Processes -

Radical  alterations  of  body image,  as if you  are  much  taller  or
shorter,  for example,  or shaped like a sphere,  column,  diamond,  or
point.   (Again,   note the material reported by Fowler  regarding  the
Andreasson case).

Sensing  that new structures,  which seem to be made of subtle  matter,
are forming inside your body or on your skin.


There is now a large body of clinical evidence that ESP operates in our
everyday  lives  in  ways we do not typically recognize.  It  has  been
demonstrated with consistency by subjects in contemporary  experiments.
Because  of the success of their experiments at SRI International  Targ
and Puthoff wrote:

        We  have  not found a single person who  could  not  do
        remote viewing to satisfaction...  The indications  are
        that this is a widespread human talent."24

Some people apprehend phantom figures or extraphysical worlds that seem
to  be more than figments of their imagination.  Climbers Estcourt  and
Scott, explorer Ernest Shackleton, seafarer Joshua Slocum,  and aviator
Charles  Lindbergh,  for example,  described disembodied entities  that
tried  to  communicate with them and that persisted for hours or  days.
Many  people recount near-death episodes in which they perceive  beings
that seem to know what is happening in this world. Contemplative adepts
have detailed their perceptions of otherworld entities and vistas  that
seem  not  far  removed  from our  normal  environments.   During  such
experiences,    the  subject  typically  feels  as  if  he  or  she  is
apprehending  something real,  something with its own objective status,
that is somehow related to our physical universe.

"There is a long-standing witness to phantom figures in every religious
tradition,   a   great many descriptions of them in the  literature  of
psychical research,  and a considerable body of speculation about their
nature  and causes.  It has been proposed,  for example,  that  because
human perception is shaped by habitual mind-sets,  disembodied entities
are typically perceived as the angels, jinn,  devas,  elves, or (in our
time) UFOs, of the subject's culture."25

A  large  body  of evidence testifies to  another  extraordinary  human
ability  -  psychokinesis,   the direct influence of mind  upon  either
living or inorganic matter. "Metanormal influence upon our surroundings
includes these three types of activity:

1.  Telergy:  the direct influence of a mind upon brain or other living
tissue  without  any mediations observable by the ordinary  senses  (or
extensions  of them such as microscopes),  as for example in  spiritual
healing.

2.  Telekinesis:  influence upon inanimate objects at a distance  from,
and without material connection with, the motive cause or agent.

3.   The  direct  modification  of  some portion  of  space  by  mental
influence.

There  is also good evidence that some people can deliberately  imprint
images  on  photographic  film by mental influence.  Unlikely  as  this
phenomenon  seems,  it has since the 1860s been demonstrated again  and
again in Europe, Japan, and the United States.26

These  experiences  occur in all sorts of people,  even when  they  are
neither sought nor expected. They do not seem to be entirely created by
social  processes.   They can not be completely suppressed in  cultures
that  do  not support them.  That so many of these  experiences  appear
among us without benefit of formal discipline, in people with different
backgrounds, temperaments, and cultural conditioning, strongly suggests
that we are talking about innate (if normally latent)  human abilities.
Notice  how closely the above observation matches the profile of people
who experience UFO and related phenomena.

Jung  believed  that psychic phenomena "...can appear  objectively  and
concretely  in  the  form  of  physical facts....   In  this  case  the
observation  is  not  an endopsychic perception  (fantasy,   intuition,
vision,  hallucination, etc.)  but a real outer object which behaves as
if  it  were motivated or evoked by,  or as if it were  expressing,   a
thought corresponding to the archetype.27

The  archetype is not evoked by a conscious act of the will;   research
shows  that it is activated,  independently of the will,  in a  psychic
situation that needs compensating by an archetype. One might even speak
of a spontaneous archetypal intervention."28

Journeys  into  extraphysical  worlds  comprise yet  another  class  of
extraordinary  potential latent in most individuals,  but expressed  by
shamans, mystics and saints, as perhaps forerunners of human evolution.
Like other metanormal abilities,  such experience  has  been studied by
modern  psychical researchers.   In addition,  there is a huge body  of
modern  literature  about extraphysical worlds,  which each of  us  can
asses for ourselves.  A  few  examples  listed by Michael Murphy are as
follows.   "In  the  yoga  tradition,   for example,  the manomaya  and
akashaloka siddhis  provide access to other dimensions of the universe.
Siberian shamans go down to the underworld,  ascend the sky,  and enter
worlds  of  ancestral spirits.  In Iranian mysticism,   Hurqalya,   the
celestial earth, is accessible to spiritual travel."29

Taken  together,   the  above inventory of  metanormal  abilities  give
humankind  more  than enough firepower to manifest physically  UFO  and
related  phenomena.   Yet,   something is  missing.   If  humankind  is
collectively creating these experiences,  some sort of communication is
implied.

Several  philosophers and researchers have posited a universe in  which
these  supernormal  occurrences can be thought of as the  norm.   Their
concept  of  "prehension"  could be the mechanism by which  the  entire
field  of  metanormal experiences operate,  including UFO  and  related
phenomena.

These  philosophers emphasized the novelty (or creativity)  evident  at
all  levels  of  the universe.  "This means that the  basic  things  or
entities  are  events,  spatio-temporal processes of becoming.   [This]
...view   not   only  generalized  the  Einsteinian   notion   of   the
convertibility  of matter and energy,  but also employed another  basic
Einsteinian  notion,   which is that space and time are  inseparable...
things comprising the world... take -or make-  time,  as well as space,
to occur...  therefore, all actual entities are "actual occasions."  No
actual  things  simply endure passively.  Each real thing is a  spatio-
temporal happening."30

According  to philosopher Alfred North Whitehead,  "...such  patterning
and  structural  integrity are mediated by an activity inherent in  all
spatio-temporal  happenings,  or actual occasions,  namely  prehension.
Subatomic  entities,   cells,  and humans alike prehend  other  spatio-
temporal  happenings,  either including them in their own activity  (by
positive  prehension)   or  excluding them  (by  negative  prehension).
Prehension   does  not  necessarily  involve  sensory   perception   or
consciousness,  as it goes on continually in the physical elements  and
among  humans  at  both conscious and  unconscious  levels.   It  does,
however,   involve  contact  with other entities (or  occasions),   and
influence from and upon them."31

This view of physical things finds support from quantum theory,   which
suggests that subatomic events may be influenced by perception itself.

Through  prehension  then,   all entities  constituting  this  universe
continually  contact and influence other entities,  with some degree of
creativity, either on a cognitive or pre-cognitive level.

The  view that the entire universe is a continually prehending  process
has  been  called  panpsychism.  This panpsychic view of  the  universe
"...led  David  Griffin  to  suggest  a  "nondualistic,   or  animistic
interactionism"    to  account  for  telepathy,   psychokinesis,    and
psychophysical transformations.... In this view, all consciousness, all
soul,  even a disembodies soul, interacts with other entities,  whether
inorganic, animal, human or superhuman,  through a prehension that does
not  always  depend upon sensory processes,  language,  or  the  direct
application of muscular force.  .... In the animistic framework Griffin
proposes, perception and causal influence are simply two aspects of the
same event."32

University  of  London  physicist David Bohm,   a   former  protege  of
Einstein's  and  one of the world's most respected quantum  physicists,
and  Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram,  one of the architects of
our modern understanding of the brain -two of the world's most  eminent
thinkers  -  believe that the universe itself may be a giant  hologram;
literally a kind of image or construct created,  at least in part,   by
the human mind.  The holographic paradigm explains, with empirical data
to back it up, how panpsychism works, and turns the Newtonian-Cartesian
paradigm  of Western Science on its head.  In the holographic  paradigm
there is evidence to suggest that our world and everything in it - from
this magazine to the space shuttle,  from electrons to distant galaxies
-  are also only ghostly images, projections from beyond both space and
time."33

The  most  interesting  thing about the  holographic  model,   for  our
purposes  then,   is that it demonstrates a scientific context,  to  go
along  with  the philosophical context,  within which a wide  range  of
phenomena  such  as  telepathy,  precognition,   mystical  feelings  of
oneness,   psychokinesis  and  the  myriad  UFO-related  phenomena  are
permitted.

We  must look at the possibility that humankind,  through  panpsychism,
(allowed by the holographic paradigm)  may be manifesting at least part
of UFO and related phenomena.  It seems to me odd to accept the idea of
extraterrestrials  visiting  our planet from star systems  light  years
away,  possibly assuming faster-than-light travel,  or at least faster-
than-light communication of some form,  and yet exclude other processes
equally possible under the umbrella of vanguard quantum physics.

If collective humankind is creating at least some of these phenomena, a
new kind of, or degree of, consciousness is inferred.

Philosopher Henri Bergson and others have emphasized the idea that  new
levels  of consciousness appear in the course of human  history,   like
other emergent properties of the universe.  Even if they have roots  in
eternal or preexisting orders of existence,  new kinds of knowing  have
become manifest for the first time on earth in particular societies and
individuals,  then spread to others by education or example, and now we
can  add  by  panpsychism.   Through  panpsychism,   a   new  form   of
consciousness would spread through the matrix of existence itself.

Bergson  "...found a divine purpose in evolution,  which could be known
by intuition. Elan vital,  the force that impels universal development,
is  sometimes  communicated  "in its entirety"  to  those  mystics  who
achieve  partial coincidence with the creative effort that is "of  God,
if it is not God Himself."  This experience,  however,  does not end in
passivity, but leads to intense activity that embodies ... love for the
world. Mystics are impelled to advance the divine purpose by furthering
the good of their fellows. The spirit of the mystics, Bergson believed,
must  become  universal  to ensure humanity's  further  development."34
(Italics mine).

When  this trans-ego communication called panpsychism begins to  bubble
to the surface of cognition,  then, it brings with it a spiritual depth
that  goes far beyond the sharing of common cultural symbols,   because
these shared experiences,  though powerful, are primarily intellectual.
Panpsychism,   on  the  other  hand,   working  primarily  through  the
unconscious,  circumvents the intellect, languages, cultures,  politics
and religious dogma  to strike resoundingly within  the  soul.  Such an
intimate  connection,  when aroused en masse,  fires an empathy  beyond
normal  psychological  processes.  Bubbling just  under  consciousness,
rising  to  the surface at times,  there is a love of life and  of  the
creative force. At the same time, those who tap into this spirit of the
mystics  must  also  endure the unnecessary pain we inflict  upon  each
other,  since all is known without rationalization within this realm of
panpsychism.

I  think  it  possible that through panpsychism,  and  because  of  the
combined stresses of our time (enumerated below), this awareness,  this
spirit of the mystics, is the force behind an emerging world culture. I
think  it possible UFO and related phenomena are  the symbols  of  this
emergence.

To  summarize  this section:  humankind has been shown,  by  scientific
experimentation  over  many  years and around the  world,   to  exhibit
abilities that far transcend normal functioning. These abilities enable
humans  to  manifest any of the unusual feats expressed  by  the  alien
entities popularly called greys.

The  concept  of  panpsychism,  supported by quantum  physics  and  the
holographic  paradigm,   suggests  a world in  which  such  events  are
permitted.

Panpsychism  may  play  a  part  in  an  emerging  world  culture.   By
panpsychism, collective humankind could be experiencing a metanormal or
"spiritual"   kind  of  emotion called the spirit  of  the  mystics  by
Bergson.   This experience may be providing an impetus to "advance  the
divine purpose by furthering the good of [our] fellows."

Panpsychism  may  also  be  the mechanism by which an  alarm  is  being
sounded en masse,  and the mechanism by which normally latent abilities
of enormous power are manifested.

Given  that  quantum  physics  has shown us that mind  and  matter  are
inextricably linked, UFOs and related phenomena may be evidence of this
ultimate  lack  of division between the psychological,   spiritual  and
physical  worlds.   These  phenomena  may indeed be a  product  of  the
collective  psyche  of  humankind,  but they are also  real  -  neither
subjective  nor  objective but (to borrow a term from  Michael  Talbot)
"omnijective".

UFO  and  related phenomena,  then,  may be expressions  of  matenormal
abilities,   and of the emergence of humankind's move away from the old
boundaries of state,  social status,  race and religion.  The very fact
that  we are speaking of an emergence implies a primarily pre-cognitive
process.

                                  ***


                          The Social Implicate

Vallee  believes  that UFO and related phenomenon "is the  way  through
which  an  alien  form  of intelligence  of  incredible  complexity  is
communicating  with us symbolically.  There is no Indication that it is
extraterrestrial."35 I agree.

However, the only "alien" may be the alien part of ourselves, a part we
are just now beginning to acknowledge.

UFOs  and  related phenomena may be a form of communication for and  of
this specific moment in history.  In order to understand why collective
humankind  would  begin to manifest metanormal events on such  a  grand
scale at this particular time and in this particular way,  we will need
a basic understanding of the social side of this entity, "human being".

When  certain  awarenesses,  behaviors or incidents are  misunderstood,
humankind has usually attributed such experiences to powers outside the
ordinary  self.   This  is especially true when  they  seem  to  exceed
radically  our normal capacities,  but also when they seem well  formed
before their appearance and when we cannot adequately account for  them
in terms of familiar human processes or knowledge.  Experiences such as
mystical illuminations,  artistic or scientific epiphanies,   religious
visions and of course UFOs,  are examples of the sort of  extraordinary
experiences that are attributed to agencies beyond the human scope.

These  agencies are treated symbolically in mythologies and  religions.
The motifs of which mythologies and religions are made,  in turn, refer
back to humankind's basic, universal, experience of life.

There  are  at least four methods by which universal  motifs,   perhaps
informed  by panpsychism,  may manifest symbolically.  The four methods
are  symbols,   metaphor,   allegory and  mythology  which  encompasses
features  of the others.  Symbols intrigue the mind by suggesting  that
which cannot be said.  Metaphor allows that which cannot be said to  be
inferred by comparison. Allegory provides a narrative structure through
which that which is not said can be suggested.  Myth provides a durable
structure  upon  which  a  collection  of  these  allegorical  stories,
metaphors and symbols are rendered, thereby providing a means by which,
over  time,   they become part of either the tribal  or  the  universal
psyche.

In  objectively comparing the religious and/or mythological  traditions
of  humankind,   one becomes aware of certain mythic  themes  that  are
common  to  all,  though differently understood and  developed  in  the
differing traditions.  Swiss psychologist, psychiatrist and author Carl
Gustav  Jung (1875-1961)  termed these shared mythic motifs "archetypes
of  the  collective  unconscious,"  and in doing  so,   emphasized  the
subliminal  realm  out of which dreams arise.  According to  Jung,   an
"archetype"   is  a  certain  elemental  experience,   or  pattern   of
experience,   common to all humankind - an experience,   or pattern  of
experience, which people have shared from time immemorial.

Archetypes and archetypal patterns are not obscure or mystical. Indeed,
these days we tend to take most of them for granted. They would include
such events as birth,  puberty, sexual initiation, death,  the cycle of
the seasons, the traumas of war, as well as more abstract concepts such
as fear and desire, the yearning for a "spiritual home",  or simply the
quest for meaning.

Because  such  archetypes  form the basis of  the  most  elemental  and
primeval  facets of human nature,  their significance often defies  all
but  poetic  language.  Language is a product of the intellect  and  of
rationality;   archetypes  and archetypal patterns  extend  beyond  the
intellect  and  rationality.   In  consequence,   they  generally  find
expression most directly by means of symbols, because a symbol does not
address  itself to the intellect alone.  Symbols evoke resonances  deep
within  the  psyche - from within a realm the psychologist  calls  "the
unconscious."

Archetypal symbols (as opposed to tribal or personal symbols)   pertain
to mankind as a whole.  The phoenix, for example, with its connotations
of death and rebirth, is a typical archetypal symbol.  We must note how
often  the  phoenix shows up in the abduction  experience.   Archetypal
patterns are also frequently symbolized by anthropomorphic figures.

When  symbols  are organized into a coherent narrative,  and  become  a
myth, the idea of "myth" should not be thought of in terms of "fiction"
or "fantasy".  On the contrary,  myths imply something altogether  more
complex and more profound.  Historically, myths were not devised simply
to entertain and amuse, but to explain things - to account for reality.

Most  collective  myths  have both an archetypal and  a  purely  tribal
aspect.  Either of these can be emphasized at the expense of the other,
and  the  myth  itself then becomes either archetypal  or  tribal.   An
archetypal  myth,   as  stated above,  like the  universal  symbols  it
embodies,  reflects certain constants of human experience. Whatever its
origin  in a specific time or place,  an archetypal myth will transcend
such factors and refer to something shared by humanity as a whole.  The
unique quality and virtue of an archetypal myth is that it can be  used
to bring people together by stressing what they have in common.

Tribal myths, in contrast, emphasize not what men have in common,   but
what  divides them.  Tribal myths do not pertain  to  the universal and
shared  aspects of human experience.  On the contrary,  they  serve  to
extol and exalt a specific tribe, culture, people, nation or ideology -
necessarily at the expense of other tribes, cultures, peoples,  nations
and ideologies.  Instead of leading inwards towards self- confrontation
and  self-recognition,   tribal myths point  outwards,   towards  self-
glorification and self-aggrandizement.  Such myths derive their impetus
and energy from insecurity,  from blindness,  from prejudice - and from
the willful creation of a scapegoat.36

Cultural  myths reflect a deep-rooted uncertainty about inner identity.
They  define  an external identity by means of contrast  and  negation.
Everything that the enemy is, one is not.  Everything that the enemy is
not,  one is. This can be seen in recent times, of course,  in the cold
war policies of the former Soviet Union and the United States, and this
is the source of religious intolerance, and of bigotry.

Societies  conspire to hijack archetypal myths as a matter  of  course.
Psychologist  Charles Tart has compared hypnosis with the socialization
process,   arguing that enculturation has many features in common  with
the  hypnotic inductions and behaviors observed in the  laboratory.   A
culture's power to induce hypnosis,  however, is more pervasive,  long-
lasting and effective than a single hypnotist's,  for it is not limited
to a few sessions  and  may  use innumerable punishments and rewards to
strengthen its effects.  Nearly all members of a given culture share  a
"consensus  trance,"  which is virtually unbreakable,  so that they are
continually re- hypnotized by most of the people they encounter.37

Since time immemorial and continuing now,  the same triad of urgencies,
of feeding, procreating and overcoming are the motivating powers. These
primal  concerns  are the source of constant anxiety and the source  of
fear-driven  philosophies  such as those just mentioned.  In  order  to
assure these urgencies,  the first requirement has heretofore been  the
suppression  of the natural impulse to mercy.  In other words,   tribal
myths work against the spirit of the mystics mentioned earlier.

The quality of mercy, empathy or compassion is a gift of nature.  It is
apparent  in  all  the higher mammals.  Compassion is  not  tribal  -or
species-   oriented but open to the appeal of the whole range of living
beings. Therefore, one of the first concerns of the elder, prophets and
established   priesthoods   of  tribal  or   institutionally   oriented
mythological systems has always been,  writes Joseph Campbell,   "...to
limit and  define the permitted field of  expression  of this expansive
faculty  of  the heart,  holding it to a fixed focus within  the  field
exclusively of [the localized mythology],  while deliberately directing
outward every impulse to violence.  Within the [specific culture] deeds
of violence are forbidden: "Thou shalt not kill... Thou shalt not covet
they neighbor's wife"  (Exodus 20:13,  17;  also, Deuteronomy 5:17,21),
whereas abroad, such acts are required: "you shall put all its males to
the  sword,  but the women...  you shall take as booty  to  yourselves"
(Deuteronomy  20:13-  14).  In Islamic thought the nations of the earth
are  distinguished  as  of two realms:  dar al'islam,   "the  realm  of
submission to Allah,"  and dar al'harb "the realm of war, " which is to
say,   the  rest  of the world.  And in Christian thought,   the  words
reported of the  resurrected Christ to  his eleven remaining apostles -
"Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations (Matthew 28:19)
-   have  been  interpreted as a  divine  mandate  for conquest of  the
planet."38

"It   all  comes  of  misreading  metaphors,   taking  denotation   for
connotation,   the messenger for the message...[and  thereby]  throwing
both  life  and  thought  off balance.  To  which  the  only  generally
recognized correction as yet proposed has been the no less  wrongheaded
one of dismissing the metaphors as lies (which indeed they are, when so
construed),  thus scrapping the whole dictionary of the language of the
soul  (this  is  a metaphor)  by which mankind  has  been  elevated  to
interests beyond procreation, economics,  and "the greatest good of the
greatest number.""39

The  UFO complex could be the grand messenger of our time.  Yet,   most
ufologists  may  be guilty of taking denotation for  connotation,   the
messenger for the message. At the same time mainstream science promotes
the policy of dismissing the metaphor as a lie.

Though  those who promote a tribal reading of mythologies would have us
believe  a literalist's point of view,  Joseph Campbell writes,   "Like
dreams,  myths are productions of the human imagination.  Their images,
consequently,   though derived from the material world and its supposed
history,  are, like dreams, revelations of the deepest hopes,  desires,
and fears,  potentialities and conflicts,  of the human will - which in
turn  is  moved  by the energies of the organs of  the  body  operating
variously  against each other and in concert.  Every myth,  that is  to
say,   whether or not by intention,  is psychologically symbolic.   Its
narratives and images are to be read, therefore, not literally,  but as
metaphors."40

If  enculturation  is pervasive,  archetypal  motifs  are  sempiternal.
Jacques Vallee has described four components to myth, in the context of
UFO  phenomena,  to explain the power these experiences have to  change
our  beliefs:   the emotional,  the celestial,  the psychic,   and  the
spiritual.41

The  emotional  component  is a kind of seduction  that  intrigues  the
psyche  and  nevertheless  hints at danger.  This  would  include  some
stories of sexual encounters that may seem absurd and shocking but form
a significant part of the total mystery.

The  celestial component includes heavenly signs,  contact with  angels
and with the creatures of other planets, and the rest of those denizens
who form tales of outside intervention in human affairs.

The  psychic  component  in  the sightings is  the  most  difficult  to
research because ordinary logic does not apply to the paranormal.   And
yet,  a  thread of apparently absurd events remain consistent from case
to case.  In his book Secret Life,  Doctor Jacobs notes the convergence
of  minute detail found in the 300  abduction cases he researched.  His
work supports,  rather than diminishes, the work of others in the field
of abduction research. Vallee calls this thread of non-ordinary "logic"
which connects the seeming absurd details of these reports "metalogic."

The  spiritual component is perhaps the most ominous aspect of the  UFO
myth.   It is unnerving to witness how well UFO and  related  phenomena
fits  into the framework established by the entire complex of  miracles
recorded  in  human history;  from gods descending from  the  stars  in
ancient Sumerian mythology,  to the Pillar of Fire and the Burning Bush
in the Old Testament, to apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVMs),
to  Joseph Smith's visions of Angel Moroni leading to the  creation  of
the Mormon Church.

In our times,  perhaps more then at any other time, we see a tremendous
struggle  between  tribal and archetypal mythologies,   as  traditional
institutions  of  meaning  begin  to  fail us  and  we  begin  to  look
elsewhere.  The anxieties created by this cosmic tug-of-war add to  the
already  overwhelming stresses of our time.  As mentioned before,  such
stress  is  at once an impetus for change,  and responsible  for  fear-
driven adherence to tribal and religious dogma.

One  of the most powerfully resonant of all symbolic and mythic  motifs
is that of the apocalypse.  It occurs frequently in the history of most
the  world's  major  religions,   and is used in  a  variety  of  ways.
Sometimes it is employed archetypally - to induce,  as a preliminary to
judgment, soul-searching and self-assessment,  whether of an individual
or  of  a  culture.   Sometimes  it  is produced as an explanation  for
assorted  ills,   real,  imagined  or  anticipated.  But mostly,  it is
deployed to  intimidate people,   to play upon their guilt,  break down
resistance  and  extort trust.   Sometimes it is utilized in a  crudely
tribal fashion,   as  an instrument for creating a self-styled elite of
the "saved"  and opposed to the mass of the "damned".  Sometimes it  is
even  made  to  serve  as  an excuse  for  persecuting  the  supposedly
"damned". Sometimes this motif is corrupted by a charismatic madmen who
leads hundreds to their death. It is  interesting to note how often the
apocalypse motif shows up in the abduction experience.

A  second archetype worthy of note in light of our topic is what  might
be called the cabal, or the "invisible junta" or secret society.  These
can be found across the world, in every culture, in every age. Usually,
the secret society is characterized as a conclave of puppet-masters,  a
clandestine  circle of individuals working for good or ill "behind  the
scenes", manipulating others, orchestrating events,  applying pressure,
pulling strings, "making things happen".

Dr.   Vallee and others have pointed out,  and I have mentioned  above,
that  the abduction experience matches in general structure the kind of
initiatory  experience  utilized by secret societies.   I   believe  it
possible that these experiences are indeed initiatory and that they are
produced  by  collective  humankind  in  preparation  for  bringing  to
consciousness  the  moment  of transcendence we are  now  experiencing.
Below are the general stages of a typical abduction experience followed
by the general stages of an initiation ritual in parenthesis:

1.   An  unsuspecting person is confronted by small,   strange  looking
creatures,   often  with odd clothing (The candidate is  confronted  by
members of the group wearing special costumes.)

2.  From the first few seconds of an abduction,  nothing is within  the
realm of normal human experience. S/he is paralyzed, and rendered simi-
conscious (S/he is blindfolded.)

3.   The abductee is spirited off,  often by levitation,  often somehow
through  closed windows,  out into the night,  up into a waiting  craft
(S/he is led by the arm through a rough and difficult route).

4.   The abductee is taken to a specially designed chamber that has  no
windows and is placed in such a way that s/he can only see part of what
is  going on (S/he is taken into a specially designed chamber that  has
no  windows and is placed in such a way that s/he can only see part  of
it).

5.   After a physical examination by short creatures,  the abductee  is
confronted by a creature that looks similar to, but is taller than, the
short  creatures.  It is obvious this taller creature is  "in  control"
(S/he is placed in the presence of a "Master.")

6.   The  taller creature puts the abductee  through  further  physical
procedures,  then moves on to various mental procedures,  part of which
is  often to answer questions,  or to solve a problem)  S/he is given a
test and made to answer questions.

7.  During the mental procedures administered by the taller being,  the
abductee is often made to see images telepathically, or is taken into a
kind  of multimedia room and show images on a screen.  The images often
have to do with various forms of personal or mass destruction (S/he  is
shown a variety of symbols designed to remind him of death.

8. Often the abductee sees other humans in dire circumstances,  or even
parts  of  humans  in large vats.  The physical  procedures  are  often
painful  and always frightening (The situation suggests that  s/he  may
not survive the ordeal.)

9.   Often the abductee is given something to drink (S/he is given food
or drink.)

10. The abductee is rendered unconscious, or simi-conscious and then in
various ways deposited outside the craft (S/he is blindfolded again and
led outside).

What  happens  if  we  begin  to read  UFO  and  related  phenomena  as
archetypes, metaphors, as the essence of myth?

Vallee draws a parallel between religious apparitions, the fairy-faith,
the  reports  of  dwarf-like beings with  supernatural  powers,   other
denizens  of  folk lore and mythology and the present  reports  of  UFO
landings and abductions.  He writes,  "Such contact includes abduction,
ordeal (including surgical operations), and sexual intercourse with the
aliens. It often leaves marks and scars on the body and the mind, as do
UFO abductions."42  Valley believes the mechanisms  that have generated
these  various beliefs  and  experiences are  identical.   Their  human
context and their effect  on  humans  are constant.  The phenomenon has
stable,  invariant features.43  If the UFO complex is indeed an outward
expression of archetypal motifs, then of course, he is right.

As  the  imagery of a dream is metaphorical of the  psychology  of  its
dreamer,   that  of a mythology is metaphorical  of  the  psychological
posture of the people to whom it pertains.  The sociological  structure
which  arises  out  of  this psychological posture was  termed  by  the
Africanist Leo Frobenius (1873- 1938) a cultural "monad."44 So, who are
the  people who inform the UFO mythology?  Not just the people  of  the
United States,  for UFO phenomena  is world-wide.  Not just the Western
cultures,  because UFO phenomena occur in all cultures.  Not just those
who reside in industrialized nations,  for UFO phenomena occur in Third
World  Countries.  The pervasiveness of the phenomena points towards  a
collective humankind.

In The Decline of the West,  Oswalk Spengler (1880-1936)  distinguished
"eight  colossal  monads  of  great majesty,"   with  a  ninth  now  in
formation,   as having dominated world history since the rise,  in  the
fourth  millennium BC,  of the first literate high cultures.  They are:
(1)   the Sumero-Babylonian,  (2)  the Egyptian,  (3)  the  Greco-Roman
(Apollonian),  (4) the Vedic-Aryan, of India, (5) the Chinese, (6)  the
Maya- Aztec/Incan,  (7)  the Magian (Persian-Arabian, Judeo- Christian-
Islamic),   (8)   the  Faustian  (Goth-Christian  to  modern  European-
American),  and now, expressed through a Marxian cultural overlay,  (9)
the germinating Russian- Christian.

I propose another "colossal monad," one that is informed by an emerging
world  culture.   This world culture,  having access to  probably  more
religious, contemplative, shamanic, and esoteric lore than at any other
time in history and having a greater and more immediate access to world
events than ever before,  will subsume all previous cultural monads  in
time.

These sociological structures have been,  up until this time, localized
(in time and space)  and constellating variously in relation to current
needs and interests.  But when a society looses faith in the ability of
old  tribal  myths  as  a source of meaning,   the  control  factor  is
neutralized; primal bioenergies are unbridled.

Rising  urban  crime,  corporate greed and personal selfishness can  be
seen  as fear driven strategies - an apparently necessary evil  as  the
institutions  we  once relied upon for meaning fail us  and  insecurity
becomes the prime motive force. However, the stress resultant from such
psychological  positions  may also serve as an impetus  to  search  for
meaning elsewhere.  To seek meaning is native to our species.   If I am
right, UFO and related experience say that we simply must come to terms
with our modern anxieties and their root causes.  We are no longer  are
allowed denial.

"Heideger  has said that we are living in the time between the death of
the  old gods and the birth of the new,  a  theme that  resonates  with
Jung's  idea  that  UFOs  are fundamental symbols of  "changes  in  the
constellation  of psychic dominants,  of the archetypes,  or [gods]  as
they used to be called, which brings about, or accompany,  long-lasting
transformations of the collective psyche.""45

Jung  realized  that religious vision are experienced "...in  times  of
personal  and collective distress or danger,  or in response to  "vital
psychic need"." He has also noted that today,  individuals and cultures
are faced with a threat,  "...namely of being swallowed up in the mass.
Hence  in  many  places there is a wave of hope in  a  reappearance  of
Christ,   and  a  visionary  rumor  has  even  arisen  which  expresses
expectations  of  redemption.   The form it has  taken,   however,   is
comparable  to nothing in the past,  but is a typical child of the "age
of  technology."   this  is  the  worldwide  distribution  of  the  UFO
phenomenon..."46

Writes  Kieth  Thompson  in  his book Angels  and  Aliens,   "From  the
archetypal perspective pioneered by Carl Jung,  it could be argued that
each  case  (of UFO encounter)  was a specific instance of an  emerging
shift  in  the collective structure of reality.  Perhaps some  entirely
new,   or  latent,   dimension was beginning to "bleed  through"   into
collective  consciousness,   via particular individuals  in  particular
places.   Or  perhaps something quite ancient from the world  soul  was
making its periodic return, in a novel form,  as part of a larger cycle
or spiral of manifestation."47

Jung  noted that he was not pleased to conclude that the appearance  of
UFOs clearly indicated "coming events which are in accord with the  end
of an era."  Such large-scale anomalies typically arise when  wholesale
changes  are  under  way  in the balance of forces  in  the  collective
unconscious.   Jung  had no doubt that humanity was entering a time  of
profound  transition  from  one  set of ruling images -  those  of  the
Piscean  Age  coinciding  with  the rise of Christianity  -  to  a  new
collective  disposition  of  psychic elements related  to  the  era  of
Aquarius.48

The  life  of a mythology derives from the vitality of its  symbols  as
metaphors  delivering,   not  simply the idea,  but a sense  of  actual
participation  in  the  realization  of  transcendence,   infinity  and
abundance.

In 1990 Clive Potter, Phillip Mantle and Andrew Walmsley published four
summaries  of  cases in which each individual witness claims an  "alien
contact"   of some kind.  The cases were part of British  UFO  Research
Association  and  Independent  UFO  Network  joint  abduction/contactee
research.   In each case the abductee felt that as a direct  result  of
their UFO contact experiences,  they had been given information - or  a
new awareness - with regards to the future. Further, each felt they had
a  role to play in any future society,  or at least,  in the transition
between the old and the new one.  In all four cases the experiencer was
convinced that this information was, and in some cases, still is coming
to them via "alien contact."49

During  my own studies over the past ten years I have repeatedly  noted
research  with UFO experiencers and abductees that brings to light  the
powerful  dimensions  of  personal  growth  that  can  accompany  those
traumatic experiences, especially when these people receive appropriate
help from knowledgeable mental health facilitators.  For instance,   an
intense  concern  for the planet's survival and a  powerful  ecological
consciousness seem to develop for many abductees.

It  is difficult to avoid the impression that while the debate  between
true  believers  on  both sides of the UFO  question  presses  on  with
questionable productivity,  personal and collective belief systems have
been changing in momentous ways.

While  we  look  the other way,  the human  mythological  structure  is
undergoing a fundamental shift. Public opinion surveys reveal that more
people  than  ever  now take for granted that we are not alone  in  the
universe  - "inner"  as well as "outer"  universes,  if such a  duality
actually  exists.   UFOs and related phenomena prod us  to  take  apart
Western  dogma concerning the supposedly interminable gulf between mind
and  matter,   spirit and body,  culture and world and  other  familiar
dichotomies.

Joseph  Campbell  tells  us that a fundamental  transformation  of  the
historical traditions usually subjugating humanity is in prospect.  The
age  of the conquering armies of the contending colossal monads may  be
about to close.  Boundaries are dissolving.  "And along with them,  the
psychological  hold [of their] mythological images and  related  social
rituals  by which they were supported.  Old gods are dead or dying  and
people everywhere are searching,  asking:  What is the new mythology to
be, the mythology of this unified earth as of one harmonious being?

Campbell  continues,   "One cannot predict the next mythology any  more
than one can predict tonight's dream;  for a mythology is...  something
experienced  from the heart,  from recognitions of identities behind or
within the appearance of nature,  perceiving with love a "thou"   where
there would have been otherwise only an "it.""50

With  our innate ability to experience compassion,  and our  collective
realization  of  the  threat to humankind's viability  in  the  future,
experienced  during  a time of profound absence of meaning as  familiar
institutions crumble around us, our natural tendency, therefore,  is an
urgency to take action.  And yet enculturation subverts this process by
reinforcing  individuation through tribal mythologies.  Thus,   in  our
time, we seem to be stuck at an impasse.  No wonder we are experiencing
a  profound  collective  anxiety,  and perhaps because  of  it,   close
encounters of the symbolic kind (CE-S?).

Unfortunately,    we   have  more  than  ancient  tribal  beliefs   and
enculturation standing in the way of future human evolvement. Though we
continue   to  try,   it  is  becoming  impossible  to  ignore  runaway
technology, medicine without compassion, global economies,  diminishing
resources,   increasing population,  a  seemingly doomed ecology,   and
ourselves:   an  intelligent species floundering in  a  mythless  void,
cowering  in the face of the power to create a new vision.  If  someone
would just teach us how to do it.

What is needed, then, is a powerful symbol - or symbols, the precursors
of  a mythology,  that will suggest a path towards restored harmony and
well being - that is,  the intent of the world-culture monad.  It is my
arguement  that the abduction experience provides just such  a  vehicle
for  change.  As the various ethnic and cultural forms dissolve,  it is
the  specter  of androgynous Anthropos that emerges.  In  other  words,
generic humankind. And the perfect symbol for that is, the Greys.

I   think  it  possible  we  have  collectively  created  a   simi-real
environment in which such a pedagogical narrative takes place.  In this
scenario,  all the members of humankind are held,  both in mind and  in
sentiment to the knowledge of our common threat,  and thus are moved to
live in accord with this knowledge.  This is the over-riding motivating
force of the emerging world-culture monad - survival in the face of the
error of our ways. I think it possible that we,  a world culture formed
of  a  species  gifted  with usually latent  but  potent  abilities  of
manifestation, have created a planetary  Host,  one specially formed to
communicate this monadic impetus, if in an allegorical form.

Allegories  are usually a long and elaborate story with many characters
and incidents through which is illustrated an unstated moral  principle
or abstract truth.  By having an apparently absurd,  or bizarre surface
structure,   allegory  immediately elicits  an  interpretive  response.
Allegories are based on parallels between two levels of meaning. One is
suspected  while the other is literally presented in an understandable,
if unbelievable,  story.  Nothing appears more often in ufology than an
impulse to get to the "real truth" beyond "mere appearances".

In summation of the material thus far presented:  I  think it  possible
the  collective need of humankind to preserve itself in uncertain times
has  called  forth  latent  metanormal abilities  to  make  manifest  a
metaphorical  actuality  appropriate  for  this  time:   UFO  phenomena
culminating in an abduction allegory.

In this scenario:

First,   a  threat has been perceived in the collective unconscious  of
humankind.   Through  panpsychism  humankind is moved  to  collectively
experience  the spirit of the mystic.  The subsequent call to action to
"advance  the divine purpose by furthering the good of  [our]  fellows"
forms  the  core  of an emerging world  culture.   Enculturation  works
against the emerging evolution of consciousness.  The resulting impasse
causes  stress.  Further stress related to ecological  decay,   overall
anxiety  about  our  future viability and the  failure  of  traditional
institutions  to  impart  meaning,   forces us past  a  threshold.   An
allegorical  narrative  is  manifested  in semi-   real  terms  by  the
collective force of native metanormal abilities.

                  The Abduction Experience as Allegory

Many  theories have been posited to explain the  abduction  experience.
Space  is not available here to annotate each hypothesis.  I  therefore
refer the reader to Secret Life by Dr.  Jacobs for a comprehensive list
and  his rebuttal to each.51  The following inventory,  then,   is  not
exhaustive,   but  included to give the reader an idea of  the  various
explanations for the abduction experience:  fabrication,  repression of
abuse,  hysterical contagion,  multiple personality disorder,  fantasy-
prone   personalities,   the  influence  of  hypnosis,   prewaking  and
presleeping states,  the will to believe,  channeling,  hallucinations,
psychosis,  psychogenic fugue state, temporal lobe dysfunction,  desire
for a baby,  folklore, archetypal memories,  birth trauma,  alternative
realities and finally, the influence of science fiction.

In  Jacob's  own  words,  "All of these explanations  -  psychological,
psychiatric,   cultural,  and exotic - fail to account  for  critically
important aspects of the abduction event.  They ignore the richness and
abundance  of  similar,  frequently exact detail and the  extraordinary
convergence  of the abductee narrative across all cultural  boundaries.
For  example,   mindscan,   visualization,  and  many  other  abduction
procedures  (explained  below)  have never been publicized  or  written
about  even  in the most esoteric UFO literature,   yet  virtually  all
abductees  (in his studies)  describe them.  Abductees tell essentially
the  same story regardless of their age,  race,  religion,  upbringing,
occupation,  economic status,  educational level,  intelligence,  life-
style, or ethnic or cultural background."52

It  is true that none of these explanations by themselves address  even
most  of  the  myriad aspects that make up UFO lore.   Neither  does  a
literalist  ET hypothesis.  However,  the three hypotheses described in
this  article,   working in concert,  do address most UFO  and  related
phenomena.

As we have now seen, through panpsycism and the holographic paradigm of
the universe there may be no separation between mind, spirit and matter
-  no separation between subjective and objective. In other words,  the
abduction  experience  could well be internally generated,   yet  still
feature  the  complexity,   and convergence  of  minute  detail  across
geographical  and cultural boundaries,  because the internal mechanisms
that would generate such narratives are informed by all humankind, at a
moment of trancendence.

Jacobs  argues,   "None of these theories explain the  lack  of  strong
personal content in the abduction accounts. For instance, the narrative
contain  little  about the abductee's past life,   personal  life,   or
fantasy life.  Abduction accounts contain almost no material related to
the person's social, cultural, familial, or occupational activities."53

Yet,  if collective humankind has manifested this experience, one would
expect  a  generic  message - one having more  to  do  with  collective
anxieties.

Even  the  "alien's"   color  may be meaningful.  As  we  approach  the
millennium, we find a society awash in information,  but with a paucity
of meaning.  The ancient traditions and institutions they spawned  have
failed us. We have awakened from our collective dream where choices are
black  or white,  to a time when it is becoming impossible to think  in
such simple and comfortable terms. Our lives, our thinking, our choices
are  now rendered in shades of grey - a perfect color for our  proxies.
If  we  allow  a free-flow of associations,  we soon  notice  that  the
"alien's" grey, or even pink-grey, color is also the color of the organ
from  which  these denizens may arise to inform us of  our  unconscious
desire to transcend what has gone before.

Above,  I  mentioned how the "aliens"  have a sameness about them,  how
they  don't  seem to change with the passing of time.  In  fact,   they
compare well with mannequins,  or generic homonid. Thereby, a  light is
thrown upon collective humankind.  We are center stage in this  theatre
of the absurd.

The Beings overall fetus-like stature may be metaphorical for a primal,
basic, new or original message. On a deeper level, the stature of these
creatures  may  represent a hint towards deciphering  the  allegory  in
which  they operate.  The hint could be that we should think about  the
emergence of new life,  or new consciousness.  Considering the over-all
theme of creating an "alien"- human hybrid, perhaps the message is that
we  are  becoming something different than what we have been.   We  are
becoming  what  has been,  and still is,  alien to us - at least  on  a
cognitive level.

If  collective  humankind has caused this manifestation to  herald  the
emerging  into  consciousness  an awareness of  our  native  metanormal
abilities   and  the  spirit  of  the  mystics,   the  above   symbolic
possibilities make sense.

With their giant, intimidating eyes, the "aliens" are reported to stare
right  into  our  souls.  They seem very interested  in  how  abductees
assimilate  their  various experiences during the abduction  -  thereby
throwing the attention back upon ourselves once again.  We know nothing
of  them,   but they seem  to  encourage  us  to  discover  much  about
ourselves.  If thousands of people in the  United States alone have had
the  abduction experience,  shouldn't "they"  have  enough  information
about  the psycho-social functions of our  minds  by now?  Perhaps that
isn't the point.

The  physical  examination each abductee is made to endure  during  the
first  phase  of the abduction can also be seen as a metaphor  for  our
times.  The examination, much like a physical given before insurance is
granted,  is highly efficient and routine.  Though the abductee may  be
frightened   witless,    the  abductors  show  no  emotional   response
whatsoever.   The abductee is made to feel like a powerless lab animal.
If anything,  the abductors  will say (telepathically)  something inane
like, "You shouldn't be frightened of this," or, "This won't hurt," and
then  it does.  If I were going to try and express anxiety,  through  a
story,  regarding the impersonal, compassionless,  alienating direction
that our medical practices are moving towards,  I  couldn't think of  a
better narrative  than grey,  impersonal beings doing strange things to
me in an alien environment - the perfect generic reduction.

By  examining  an abduction experience in detail,  it  is  possible  to
reveal  further the metaphorical content of the stages which combine to
make up the allegorical narrative of this initiation experience.

After  studying abductions for several years Dr.  Jacobs realized  that
the  procedures examined below fit together into a standard  structure.
There are Primary, Secondary and Ancillary experiences which are broken
down  into  Physical,  Mental,  and Reproductive  procedures.   Primary
experiences are: Physical - examinations,  tissue samples and implants;
Mental - staring (various PSI54 induced physiological and psychological
activities);   Reproductive - urological-  gynecological  examinations,
egg-sperm collection,  embryo implanting,  fetal extraction.  Secondary
experiences  are:   Physical  -  the use  of  various  machines  during
examinations;  Mental - visualization,  imaging, envisioning,  staging,
(all terms developed by Dr. Jacobs, each explained below), and testing;
Reproductive  - child presentations in their various forms.   Ancillary
experiences  are:  miscellaneous physical activities such as  surgeries
and cures; Mental - media display (another Jacobsian term), information
transfer  (another  PSI activity);   Reproductive  -involuntary  and/or
compulsive sexual activity with or without "humans" and/ or "hybrids".

Procedures  such  as examinations,  tissue samples and implants can  be
"read" metaphorically as anxiety about run-away medical practice at the
hands of dehumanizing and alienating doctors and technicians.

Reproductive  procedures  are  a  constant  feature  of  the  abduction
experience  and  seem ultimately directed to the production  of  hybrid
beings.  Women are forced to endure the extraction and implantation  of
eggs,   the  extraction of fetuses and unwanted pregnancies.   Men  are
forced  to  endure  the extraction of sperm.55   These  procedures  may
illustrate  a complex of human anxieties about the future of  the  once
private  joy  of  creating a family.   Test  tube  babies,   artificial
insemination,  sperm donors, women paid to carry another woman's child,
the   specter  of  cloning  -  while  many  of  these  modern   medical
possibilities  bring with them the possibility of families  where  once
there were none,  science has raced forward at a shocking rate, a  rate
which leaves cultures and individuals scarce time to adapt. We are left
in  wonderment,  disillusionment and confusion.  Where does  artificial
insemination fit into the divine plan? What happens when humankind take
over a realm once owned by the Almighty?

Dr. Jacobs found the primary mental experience to be a process he named
"staring". "Through the abduction,  both as a way of communicating with
the abductee and,  presumably, of examining and altering her mental and
emotional  state,  the Beings stare deeply into the abductee's eyes."56
Under the realm of staring are several special uses of this  telepathic
device. One of them is Mindscan.

Mindscan  is  administered  by  the taller being  (the  Master  in  the
initiation ritual). Again, the abductee is made to feel powerless.  The
abductee's  objections or attempts to find out more information are not
dealt with seriously. "Mindscan entails deep,  penetrating staring into
the abductee's eyes.  Abductees commonly feel that data of some sort is
being extracted from their minds.  We  do not know what the information
is,  how it is extracted, or what the Beings do with it.  Once abductee
thinks that they transfer it to other Beings" minds."57

Both general staring techniques and Mindscan can be read metaphorically
as  a  fear of loss of individuality,  a  fear of the loss  of  private
thoughts,  and the fear of the loss of personal liberty by totalitarian
authorities.  Generally,  this is the fear of powerlessness in the face
of a passionless,   all-powerful force (the advance of technology,  the
de-humanization  of  the corporate world).  Abductees often feel as  if
they  are  "falling into the eyes"  of the taller being.   What  better
expression of the fear of becoming lost in the mass, as Jung suggested?

"During Mindscan,  the Taller Being can elicit specific emotions in the
abductee, such as fear and terror. Often he will create an instant rush
of pleasurable emotions in the abductee that "bonds" her to him.  As he
stares  deeply  into her eyes,  she may feel that the Taller  Being  is
really a "good"  individual. She wants to help him."58  She may even be
induced  to "love"  him.  After the experience the abductee will  often
know  s/he  has  been  duped and experience  the  resultant  shame  and
confusion.   What better way to address the emotional manipulations  of
campaign propaganda,  hollow religious traditions,  and of  individuals
crippled by a lack of guidance and meaning?  Generally,  this procedure
may underscore disillusionment and the loss of faith in ones ability to
judge  the  motivations of others,  in a time when  old  structures  no
longer guarantee social restraint.

One  of  the secondary experiences are Machine  Examinations.   Various
kinds  of machines come out of walls,  down from the ceiling,   or  are
"wheeled"   over  from a side area to the abductee.  Most  experiencers
think  they  are devices for recording,  like an  x-ray,   or  scanning
device.   Various  other  kinds  of  machines  are  used  during  other
procedures,  such as gynecological and urological manipulations. In the
main, these machines buz,  tingle,  features flashing lights, and don't
seem  to  harm  or  alter the abductee.   They  perhaps  represent  the
mysterious   equipment   used  by  modern  medicine,   and   underscore
powerlessness, alienation and fear of modern technology.

"Secondary  mental  procedures consist of having an abductee  visualize
scenes  and objects that evoke an emotional or  intellectual  response.
This  allows the aliens to examine human emotions,  abilities,  thought
processes,    memory  and  perhaps  even  intelligence.   During  these
procedures, as in Mindscan,  an alien stares deeply into the abductee's
eyes."59

Imaging  is a secondary visualization technique.  A  Taller Being comes
over  and  stands  next to the abductee.  S/he is shown  a  screen-like
apparatus  and  images  begin  to appear on it.   The  scene  is  often
abhorrent and disturbing.  Scenes of death and destruction, war, atomic
explosions  and  the  end of the world are typical.  Also  typical  are
sexually  charged scenes.  Sometimes the images are mundane and evoke a
neutral  response.   Though it is conceivable these images  caused  the
formation of entire religious movements in the past, the scenes  do not
appear  to have any prophetic value.  During  Imaging  one  fundamental
factor  stands out:  A  Taller Being stands by the abductee and  stares
deeply  into his/er eyes during the procedure.  "He"  seems to want  to
analyze the emotional effects of viewing the images.

If  my hypotheses are right,  if collective humankind has manifested an
initiation  in  semi-real terms,  it would make sense that part of  the
initiatory  experience  would be a facing of the anxieties we  deny  in
consciousness. It would make sense that the authority figure would want
to  see how we react.  The symbolic message might be:  "Are we  getting
through? Look at your fear of the future. Will you let the world end in
a  nuclear debacle?  Do you want life to become more and  more  mundane
until  it  is  unbearable?   Will sex remain  the  realm  of  obsessive
behavior,   or  will  you  integrate  this  activity  into  a  balanced
experience of life?

Media displays are an ancillary mental procedure. Within something like
a multi-media room, abductees are show moving pictures of beautiful and
idyllic  landscapes.  One sees majestic mountains,  rivers,   beautiful
birds, fields of grain, etc. The scenes always feature perfect weather.
No evidence of civilization can be seen.  No humans or aliens are seen.
Abductee's  have felt that these scenes might be depictions of a  world
the  aliens are creating,  one that may be important for humans at some
point.  One abductee studied by Dr.  Jacobs thought that she was seeing
planet  Earth after alien intervention and that the display was a  kind
of  propaganda.   She  got  the feeling of being  manipulated  by  "Big
Brother".

If  collective  humankind were to create a simi-real world,  one  would
expect it to be a generic world. If one wished to express in a symbolic
way,   on the level of emotions,  the fear of the loss of individuality
and  free choice,  one would expect the feeling of Big Brother  running
the operation.

"Secondary  reproductive procedures do not involve reproduction itself,
but rather the interaction between abductees and what appears to be the
product of the alien breeding program. In these strange encounters, the
aliens carefully watch as women,  men, and children are required either
to observe or physically interact with bizarre looking "offspring"."60

The  "incubatorium"   is a room where the abductee sees scores of  what
appear  to  be  fetuses in the process of incubation.  There  are  seen
floating in containers filled with a liquid solution,  or lying down in
either liquid or dry environments. The containers are often attached to
apparatus which appear to be  life-support systems.  The environment is
cold and lab-like. Aliens who work  here are simply doing routine jobs.
They  are  emotionless.   The  fetuses do not seem alive  as  we  would
understand it, yet they seem to be placed in order of stages of growth.

This  stage  of the abduction experience is obvious on  a  metaphorical
level.   Here  is  a clear expression of angst generated  from  runaway
technology  without parallel cultural development.  Where do test  tube
babies fit into our mythologies,  our religions? What do these advances
in science say  about  our future?  What does  the  future hold for our
prodigy?

"In another child-presentation procedure,  the aliens take the abductee
into  a room either singly or with a group of other abductees and  show
her a nursery-like area containing as many as a hundred babies.... More
often than not,  they are lying in hard,  transparent boxes.  Obviously
not fetuses, these babies are old enough to live on their own. However,
the babies appear  phlegmatic and  sickly."61   Abductees feel like the
babies should be crying,  but they are not. The "aliens"  attending the
babies  often  just stand there,  almost as if guarding the room.   The
overall impression is that in a place where there should be much  life,
there   is  little  if  any.   The  abductees,   regardless  of   their
predisposition to babies, are forced to view this disturbing scene. One
abductee argued,  "Sorry, but you picked the wrong person. I don't care
about babies. I  don't even like babies."  The "alien" replied: "That's
all right, you're still involved. You're still involved."62

If on some metanormal level we are sending ourselves a generic message,
one  would  expect  the message to apply regardless of  the  individual
abductee's personal preferences. The Nursery motif could well represent
the  extreme  logical  outcome if we continue in the direction  we  are
going  with  our own children.  Children are shipped off  to  nurseries
where they are cared  for  en  mass.  While some facilities undoubtedly
provide  quality care,  more often we have found this is sadly not  the
case.   Instead,  our children simply find alien childcare.  In a  more
general sense,  this scene adds to an overall theme of  dehumanization-
which  in a sense implies that we are becoming alien to ourselves.   At
another level,  as we continue to concern ourselves with ourselves, our
children become alien to us.

"Child  presentations  involve more than viewing.  Abductees  are  also
required  to touch,  hold,  or hug these offspring.  Although abductees
will see more babies than any other age group  of Being,  they are also
often presented with young children and even adolescents. Apparently it
is  absolutely essential for the child to have human contact.  Although
the aliens prefer that the humans give nurturing,  loving contact,  any
physical contact seems to suffice."63

If  we are sending cosmic proxies to manipulate our beliefs,  one would
expect both positive and negative reinforcement. First we are shown the
possible outcome of our move towards institutionalizing our children in
lieu  of  parenting,   then we are forced to  nurture  these  children,
whether  we  like it or not;  at the same time it is pointed  out  that
touching and holding are absolutely essential.  The main theme of child
presentation  is that these children need human contact  regardless  if
they  are  pretty,   regardless  if  they  are  sickly  in  appearance,
regardless if they are alien to us.  This is tough talk.  "Rough love",
it's called in some forms of therapy.  It's time for us to grow up  and
move  along in our development.  We are no longer allowed to deny  that
clearly, we must not continue to abandon our children.

Jacobs argues,  that if abduction experiences are internally generated,
"We would expect abductees to claim that communication that takes place
with aliens is widespread and deeply searching.  As with the contactees
reports or channeled information,  we would know about where the aliens
came from,  what their planets were like, why they were here...  and so
forth. In fact, abduction accounts contain no such information. We know
nothing about the aliens" home environment. We do not even know if they
have a home environment.  We have no knowledge about the aliens"  lives
outside the UFO."64

If  my  hypotheses  are correct,  the  enigmatic  and  generic  surface
narrative  may be a sort of cosmic allegory woven of several  metaphors
which become the classic elements of UFO lore. As the lore crystalizes,
the manifestations become more tangible,  yet always just as enigmatic,
and  in  this way,  guaranteeing our continued  attention.   Abductions
represent the most advanced narrative featuring highly evolved symbols.
If  the  "aliens"  are merely actors upon our co-created stage,   their
specific purpose may not need the support of a background narrative  to
be effective messengers of a story we have written,  but which  beckons
from a realm of symbols, metaphor, and even puns.

Look  again at how various aspects of the abduction experience could be
metaphorical reflections of the anxieties humankind is now experiencing
as we approach the year 2000:

Abductees  are  floated  through a closed window - fear of  losing  the
security of the Newtonian-Cartesian reality.

People are abducted by technologically advance but emotionless aliens -
fear  of  runaway  technology  that is alien to us  and  controlled  by
dehumanized technocrats.

Abductees  are involved in a narrative about a breeding program run  by
generic  looking,   emotionless  aliens - fear for the  future  of  our
prodigy and a warning about the dehumanizing effect of modern culture.

Abductees are forced to endure frightening examinations and experiments
by  nearly faceless aliens - fear of runaway medical practices advanced
by "faceless" practitioners.

Mindscan  - fear of the loss of individuality and fear of the  loss  of
free thought.

Visualization,  Media display - fear of ecological and other  worldwide
disasters.

Mindscan,   Imaging,   Envisioning,  Staging,  Media Display - fear  of
fascist regimes, Big Brother.

If my hypotheses are correct,  collective humankind has created proxies
to  act  as  the  facilitators of our repressed  anxiety  and  fear  of
transcendence  -  facilitators  needed  to counter the  effect  of  the
hypnotic  effect of enculturation.  An alien was asked by an  abductee,
"Do  you  sleep?"  It said,  "We are always sleeping."   Clearly,   our
manifestations tell us they ultimately spring forth from our collective
unconscious. It is we who must wake up from our collective sleep.

Dr.   Jacobs argues,  "We would expect that the totality of the  events
would  remain  permanently  random  (if  the  experiences  were  purely
subjective),   without  the  congruence and  richness  of  detail  that
characterize abduction accounts.  In fact,  we find many accounts to be
so precisely similar that,  in order to match other random,  internally
generated accounts,  the abductees would have to be not only  extremely
well versed in published abduction literature,  they would also have to
know  the  minutiae  of events that have never been  published  in  the
literature  and,   indeed,   that even most abduction  researchers  are
unaware of."65

Perhaps  Dr.  Jacobs puts the horse before the cart.  If humankind  has
collectively manifested a grand metanormal allegory,  all humankind who
individually experience them would experience  the same metaphors which
make up the abduction narrative.

Until  now,   no  alternative hypothesis has emerged  that  takes  into
account  the  totality  of the data in UFO and related  experience.   I
believe that together, my hypotheses address most aspects of this grand
enigma and also address the overall convergence of data.

On  the surface,  an allegory must work as a real story,   but  contain
enough  absurdity  to  hint that the important message lies  below  the
narrative  structure.   If we examine each mental procedure,   such  as
Staging  (the alien theatre),  or Testing (where abductees are given  a
test  s/he  is not prepared for),  it seems obvious that we  are  being
examined by real aliens.  But think.  How many people do these "aliens"
need  to  test before they understand our  psycho-sociological  makeup?
Thousands? Millions? Many million?

En masse, these procedures make more sense as an initiatory experience.
A  story-line apparently real,  but in fact allegorical.  We are  being
faced with ourselves. In the new world-culture paradigm,  after gaining
"the spirit of the mystics",  after becoming aware of our connection to
all that is,  there can no longer be any denial.  Rationalizations will
no  longer sustain us.  We must see ourselves as we are -  missing  our
ideals  -  straying  from  compassion - becoming  alien  to  ourselves.
Abductees  follow in the path of mystics,  saints,  and those who  have
suddenly transcended into a new consciousness before.  These people are
the forerunners of a new kind of human being.

In summation:

1.   All things are connected on some level.  The concept of panpsychic
interactionism  "...integrates data from various scientific  fields  to
suggest  that  our  human  capacity  for  development  arises  from   a
creativity present throughout the universe [and it] highlights evidence
that  entities operating at different levels,  from subatomic events to
human activity,  prehend or contact one another in a mutually formative
manner."66  The holographic paradigm supports panpsychic interactionism
with modern scientific research.

2.    Through  panpsychic  interactionism  all  humankind  (at   least)
communicate, if on a pre-cognitive level. Therefore, common symbols are
shared.  For the first time in history,  common symbols are also shared
en masse through mundane means such as mass communications.

3.   Through  mundane  means and panpsychism collective  humankind  has
become  intimately  aware of (if on a pre-cognitive level)  the  severe
threats to its survival. This comes at a time when old institutions and
mythologies have failed to provide meaning for our lives.

4. A threshold is surpassed. Through panpsychism, there is a collective
calling   forth  of  metanormal  abilities  normally  latent   in   the
individual.   A   simi-real  realm populated by simi-real  denizens  is
manifested  to express our collective anxieties.  The structure of  the
most  advanced  form of the manifestation is an  elaborate  allegorical
narrative called the abduction experience. This allegory is constructed
of  a  string  of metaphorical events,  each  representing  a  specific
grouping  of  fears and anxieties.  The allegory works on many  levels,
from the appearance of the "aliens" to the specific motifs presented.

5.   The abduction experience works as an initiation which  facilitates
bringing a new world-culture consciousness to the individual.  The core
of  the  emerging  world-culture has been called  "the  spirit  of  the
mystics". This new awareness re- awakens love of life and all creation,
a  feeling of connection to all that is and an urge to take action  for
the good of all.  Therefore,   the  "aliens",   by way of the abduction
experience,   are  heralding  a moment of  human  transcendence.   This
transcendence   in  awareness  can  be  compared  with  the  move  from
adolescence  to  adulthood.  The experience also blatantly  points  out
humankind"s  potential  for the transcendence of what has  been  normal
functioning.


If  the abduction experience is indeed escalating in incidence at  this
time,   as  data  seems to show,  it is because if a  greater  life  is
possible  for the human race,  its permanent establishment is far  from
guaranteed.   Nuclear  war (note the proliferation of  nuclear  weapons
among  Third  World  countries  and  Russia's  continued  instability),
ecological  disaster,  social upheaval and other possible  catastrophes
could  so diminish life on earth that the chance of further social  and
spiritual  progress  would  be slim at best.  Human  evolution  is  not
automatically progressive.

For  every  species that exists today,  perhaps thousands  have  passed
away.   There is no guarantee that modern societies -or even the  human
species  itself  -  will last long enough to collectively come  to  the
consciousness heralded by the "aliens".  Indeed,  our chronic depravity
has led some thinkers to suppose that humans have already evolved in  a
fatal direction.

Michael Murphy quotes Arthur Koestler:

        The   evidence   from  man's  past  record   and   from
        contemporary  brain research strongly suggests that  at
        some  point  during  the last explosive stages  of  the
        biological  evolution  of homo sapiens  something  went
        wrong;   that there is a flaw,  some potentially  fatal
        engineering  error  built into our native  equipment  -
        more  specifically,   into the circuits of our  nervous
        system - which would account for the streak of paranoia
        running  through our history.  This is the hideous  but
        plausible  hypothesis  which any serious  inquiry  into
        man's condition has to face.67

Murphy goes on to write: "...most psychologists and medical researchers
-   like  most philosophers and religious seers - agree that  with  our
capacities  for  love,  knowledge,  and further development,   we  have
profound  disabilities,   whether  these  are caused by  our  genes  or
cultural  conditioning.   Indeed,  most programs for  human  betterment
address our shortcomings, either directly or indirectly, by therapeutic
intervention,   psychosomatic education,  ethical training,   religious
discipline, or the reconstruction of social institution."68

I submit that Murphy's enumeration of the therapeutic measures taken to
counteract  "profound disabilities"  is exactly what is going on in the
abduction experience. The "logical absurdity"  of the surface narrative
cross-circuits  the  rational mind so that  the  sub-strata,   symbolic
therapy  can do its work directly on one's soul.  First  influence  the
soul; the mind will follow.

This moment of transcendence may be nothing less than humankind  moving
out  of a collective adolescence.  Fighting,  selfishness,  refusal  of
responsibility  and denial will lead us to our doom in these  times  of
vast  technological  power.   If one reads the  material  presented  in
Jacob's book, the complexity of these experiences adds to,  rather than
detracts from, the hypothesis that these are symbolic motifs.

Unless we awaken to the consequences of the path we have either  chosen
or  allowed,  and unless we decide to take personal responsibility  for
changing  the status quo,  we may face a continued depreciation of life
by depredation,  or even inhalation. Ironically,  even if we do come to
the realization heralded by our "alien"  alter egos, reality as we know
it will still end, for we will remake our world in the image of our new
understanding.

                                 earth,
                    Since, in my sight, you see the
                            earth again ...
