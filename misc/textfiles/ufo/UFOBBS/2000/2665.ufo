    UFO: INVESTIGATORS SUSPECT NATIONAL SECURITY PINCH 
    By Judith Karns, Observer Managing Editor 



      They  say  it  isn't  so:  there ain't no such  animal  as  a "flying 
    saucer."Even  though our government spent a decade deeply  enmeshed  in 
    investigation,  (Project Bluebook,  Majestic 12), suddenly, one day,  a 
    security  lid was clamped so tight on the subjec t  of  extraterestrial 
    visitors  (some even speculate them to be subterranean)  that even  the 
    squeak  of  a  mouse couldn't get out.   And with  that  lid  came  the 
    "official" denial of the phenomenon's existence.     

      Why,  then,  asks Flushing residents Shirley and George Coyne,  state 
    directors of MUFON (Mutual UFO Network based in Seguin, Texas),  should 
    they  be singled out as subjects of what they call "intimidation",   by 
    what they suspect might be the National Se curity Administration (NSA), 
    one of our country's more covert intelligence operations?      
    
      The  Coynes  had long been aware that their delving into  the  touchy 
    subject  of  UFO  investigations  could  bring  on  some   governmental 
    attention;  they'd long heard stories from others who had been involved 
    with  the subject for far more lengthy periods of  time than they.  But 
    it wasn't until Sunday,  Jan.  10 of this year,  at approximately 11:30 
    a.m.,   that they were certain they were targets of  some  considerable 
    curiosity. 

      The Coynes  were  in the bedroom of their  two-bedroom  mobile  home. 
    Shirley was seated on the floor,  George in a nearby chair. Reclined on 
    the bed was a woman deeply entranced by hypnotic suggestions brought on 
    by  hypnotherapist  Virginia Tilly who sat  in another chair  near  the 
    bed. 

      The  scene  wasn't an unusual one.  The Coynes,  through  the  course 
    oftheir  investigations,  often come in contact with subjects who  have 
    strong suspicions that their UFO sightings amount to more than just  an 
    eyeball perspective. And when this happens,  "Ginny", a  school teacher 
    and hypnotherapist from St.  Joseph,  is called in to assist in getting 
    to the bottom of the murky puddle of speculation.     

      According  to Shirley,  this particular regression session  had  been 
    arranged  by two telephone calls,  one to the subject and one to  Ginny 
    Tilly. 

      As Ginny questioned the regressed subject,  in the far distance could 
    be  heard the approach of a helicopter.  From her vantage point on  the 
    floor,   Shirley  had been entranced in her own way by  the  sequential 
    flickers  of  small,   voice-activated  red light  s  on  Ginny's  tape 
    recorder. 

      At  about  the  same time they became aware that the  helicopter  was 
    notsimply  passing by,  Shirley became aware that the red lights on the 
    recorder had stopped. And not wishing to disturb the progression of the 
    hypnosis,  she ran to an adjacent room to  get her own recorder,  which 
    she activated. It is on this recorder that the helicopter's approach to 
    a hovering position above their mobile home is recorded.     

      According to Ginny,  the contents of her tape,  before it  was  "shut 
    off",  contained the subject's comments about the "hiders"  who were at 
    that  very  minute  approaching  in "that helicopter",   and  she  also 
    provided  a  description of the helicopter even tho ugh her  eyes  were 
    closed and the drapes were drawn. It was learned later that the subject 
    had  previous experiences with such vehicles near her home  in  another 
    part of the state.   And,  "she named a time,  a  date,  and a beach in 
    Virginia  where,   supposedly,   aliens gave the U.S.   government  the 
    technology  to be able to listen in (on private conversations)",   said 
    Ginny.      

      Meanwhile, George had gone to his car to retrieve his camera from the 
    trunk just as the helicopter hovered. Shirley joined him in time to see 
    the helicopter "tipped"  down as it maneuvered away from them.  Because 
    of its speedy exit, George was unable to get a picture.      

      It is  the Coynes'  estimate that,  though it did not  directly hover 
    again,   the  vehicle  circled the mobile  home  community  during  the 
    duration  of the hypnotic regression,  for approximately one to one and 
    on half hours. 

      They  described  it as dull black,  and large--at least four  to  six 
    passenger.    (Other  descriptions withheld at request  of  George  and 
    Shirley.) The windows were tinted dark. George noted a "wire" which was 
    visibly draped from the rear of the helicopter to the front, and it was 
    his impression that it was some type of antenna.      

      Indeed,  the hypnotized subject telephoned the Coynes some time later 
    to  tell  them  she had forgotten one detail  of  the  helicopter--what 
    appeared to be a wire connected from back to front.      

      "I was going to tell you something,  but I don't think  I'd  better," 
    said  Wright.  And he went on to tell them that just prior to his  call 
    ringing through,  a man's voice came over the line,  "as if someone had 
    picked  up an extension in my own home.  It w as a male  voice--40ish--
    that  said,  "Just a minute;  I  have to handle this,",  as if he  were 
    somewhere tapping into their line and was talking to someone else."      

      Wright says  his  initial  impression was that the  Coyne's  line was 
    tapped,   however  he  says,  "It could have been my line  rather  than 
    theirs.  Their phone had not rung yet."      Ginny Tilly,  though she's 
    certain  her  actions  are monitored through such  means  as  telephone 
    tapping,  feels the situation is more one of curiosity and  information 
    seeking rather than one of intimidation.       

      The  Coynes  have their own ideas on phone tapping,   and  take  into 
    strong consideration their frequent (several each week)  one-ring calls 
    which illicit nothing more than a dial tone on answering, and they have 
    given consideration to a bit of informatio n they've received regarding 
    the  possibility that those rings are designed to activate a 'bug"   (a 
    hidden listening device) in their home.       

      On  March  29,   the Coynes were ready to leave on a  short  trip  of 
    several days duration.  Before their departure,  they made a  telephone 
    call to the friend they were about to visit, to indicate that they were 
    on their way. They then proceeded to dirive s outhwest toward the state 
    border.        As they neared Bancroft,  on their way  toward  Lansing, 
    Shirley suddenly noticed a familiar sight--a black helicopter.   It was 
    hovering beyond an overpass under which they had just driven.      

      At  first,   speculation  was  that coincidence  had  befallen  them. 
    However,   their  concern mounted as they continued to  drive  and  the 
    helicopter  continued  to stay in their sight,  but too far away to  be 
    photographed.      

      George decided he wanted a closer look, and stopped the vehicle under 
    an overpass to remove his binoculars from the trunk.      

      The helicopter, which had continued on its way,  suddently turned and 
    came  back to pace them for a total of approximately 90  miles.  It was 
    the  helicopter's return that convinced them they were the subjects  of 
    no coincidence. 

      On  Tuedsday,   April  5,  the Coynes  witnessed  an  unmarked  black 
    planecircle their mobile home community,  the incident possibly  having 
    some connection to a disturbance with their microwave oven clock, which 
    stopped,  and blinked constant at the time of  the Coynes'  sighting of 
    the plane. 

      The   Coynes'   recording  of  the  helicopter's  initial  visit   to 
    theFlushing  area has received some scrutiny from both an FAA  (Federal 
    Aviation Administration) representative, and a member of the military. 

      Chuck  Pine,   an  FAA aviation safety inspector out of  Kent  County 
    Airport,   had  occasion to hear the recording.   He said,  "It  has  a 
    definite  'whoomp'....to me it sounded like a Huey."  Pine was hesitant 
    to be adamant in his statement,  but did concede th at the "Huey"  type 
    of  air vehicle does have a distinctive sound to it,  and the recording 
    did  seem to contain that sound.  Pine is also a commercial  pilot  and 
    former air traffic controller.      

      "I  took  the tape and drawing (Shirley's artistic rendition)   to  a 
    fella who's highly placed in the military,"  said Dan Wright. "He said, 
    'There's  no  question  in my mind;  I'd stake my life on  it  being  a 
    Huey.'"  Wright said the information he obtained on the "Huey" (made by 
    the Bell Corporation)  suggests that it is formilitary or  intelligence 
    use only, and is not provided to the private orcorporate sector.      


      Wright's had  some problems of his own lately.  He has had  reason to 
    believe  the  FBI  was keeping a file on himself,  and  had  requested, 
    through  the Freedom of Information Act,  a copy of that file. However, 
    before he received their response that they found nothing  on him,   he 
    experienced  a  nine-day period in which he received no  mail.   Wright 
    purposely waited an extended period of time before  contacting the post 
    office,  feeling that more credence could be  lent  to the situation if 
    the period of time exceeded one week. 
  
      Upon contacting the post office,  he was told that he apparently  had 
    gone  on vacation,  and that the letter carrier probably  noticed  that 
    lhis mailbox was full and simply held the mail back.      

      Wright's response  to  this  was a confession  that  he  had  gone on 
    vacation.  However, the mail delivery had stopped after his return.  He 
    did  not have a mailbox,  but he did have a slot in his door,  and  the 
    letter carrier could not have determined how much mail had been stuffed 
    into it. The mail was promptly delivered.      

      This--what is  happening to the Coynes--is very  intimidating,"  said 
    Wright. 

      "They want  the Coynes to know they are being monitored.   To me,  it 
    begins and ends with all of the documents we have requested,  and  they 
    don't want an open discussion of the  UFO issue.      

      "Whoever  is doing this,....if they want to rattle cages,  we are not 
    totally defenseless."
