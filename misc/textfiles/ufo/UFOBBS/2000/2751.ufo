    Mr. Miles E. Coll 
    Box 9575 
    Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 
     
    Attention Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt 
     
    Dear Mr. Coll: 
     
     
      This  letter concerns a preliminary recommendation to ATIC on  future 
    methods  of handling the problem of unidentified aerial objects.   This 
    recommendation is based on our experience to date in analyzing  several 
    thousands of reports on this subject.  We regard the recommendation  as 
    preliminary  because our analysis is not yet complete,  and we are  not 
    able to document it where we feel it should be supported by facts  from 
    the analysis. 
     
      We  are  making  this recommendation prematurely because  of  a  CIA-
    sponsored meeting of a scientific panel,  meeting in Washington,  D.C., 
    January  14,   15,  and 16,  1953,  to consider the problem of  "flying 
    saucers".   The  CIA-sponsored  meeting is being held subsequent  to  a 
    meeting of CIA, ATIC,  and our representatives held at ATIC on December 
    12,   1952.  At the December 12  meeting our  representatives  strongly 
    recommended  that a scientific panel not be set up until the results of 
    our analysis of the sighting-reports collected by ATIC were  available. 
    Since  a meeting of the panel is now definately scheduled we feel  that 
    agreement  between Project Stork and ATIC should be reached as to  what 
    can  and  what  cannot  be discussed at the meeting  in  Washington  on 
    January 14-16 concerning our preliminary recommendation to ATIC. 
     
      Experience to date on our study of unidentified flying objects  shows 
    that there is a distinct lack of reliable data with which to work. Even 
    the   best-documented  reports  are  frequently  lacking  in   critical 
    information   that  makes  it  impossible  to  arrive  at  a   possible 
    identification,  i.e.  even in a well-documented report there is always 
    an element of doubt about the data,  either because the observer had no 
    means of getting the required data,  or was not prepared to utilize the 
    means  at  his disposal.  Therefore,  we recommend  that  a  controlled 
    experiment be set up by which reliable physical data can be obtained. A 
    tentative  preliminary plan by which the experiment could  be  designed 
    and carried out is discussed in the following paragraphs. 
     
      Based  on  our  experience  so far,   it  is  expected  that  certain 
    conclusions will be reached as a result of our analysis which will make 
    obvious  the need for an effort to obtain reliable data from  competent 
    observers using the [... unreadable...] necessary equipment. Until more 
    reliable data are available, no positive answers to the problem will be 
    possible. 
    
    
    Mr. Miles E. Coll                   -2-                 January 9, 1953
    
      We  expect  that  our analysis will show that certain  areas  in  the 
    United States have had an abnormally high number of reported  incidents 
    of  unidentified  flying objects.  Assuming that,  from  our  analysis, 
    several  definite  areas  productive of reports can  be  selected,   we 
    recommend  that  one or two of theses areas be set up  as  experimental 
    areas. This area, or areas, should have observation posts with complete 
    visual skywatch,  with radar and photographic coverage,  plus all other 
    instruments  necessary  or helpful in obtaining positive  and  reliable 
    data on everything in the air over the area.  A very complete record of 
    the  weather  should also be kept during the time  of  the  experiment. 
    Coverage  should  be  so complete that any object in the air  could  be 
    tracked,  and information as to its altitude,  velocity,  size,  shape, 
    color,  time of day,  etc.  could be recorded.  All balloon releases or 
    known balloon paths,  aircraft flights,  and flights of rockets in  the 
    test  area should be known to those in charge of the experiment.   Many 
    different types of aerial activity should be secretly and  purposefully 
    scheduled within the area. 
     
      We  recognize that this proposed experiment would amount to a  large-
    scale  military  maneuver,   or operation,  and that it  would  require 
    extensive  preparation  and fine coordination,  plus maximum  security. 
    Although it would be a major operation,  and expensive,  there are many 
    extra  benefits to be derived besides the data on  unidentified  aerial 
    objects. 
     
      The  question  of  just what would be accomplished  by  the  proposed 
    experiment  occurs.  Just how could the problem of  these  unidentified 
    objects  be  solved?   From  this test area,  during the  time  of  the 
    experiment,   it  can be assumed that there would be a steady  flow  of 
    reports  from  ordinary civilian observers,  in addition  to  those  by 
    military or other official observers.  It should be possible by such  a 
    controlled experiment to prove the identity of all objects reported, or 
    to  determine  p[ositively that there were objects present  of  unknown 
    identity. Any hoaxes under a set-up such as this could almost certainly 
    be exposed, perhaps not pubically, but at least to the military. 
     
      In addition, by having resulting data from the controlled experiment, 
    reports for the last five years could be re-evaluated,  in the light of 
    similar but positive information.  This should make possible reasonably 
    certain conclusions concerning the importance of the problem of "flying 
    saucers". 
     
      Results of an experiment such as described could assist the Air Force 
    to determine how much attention to pay to future situations when, as in 
    the  past summer,  there were thousands of sightings reported.  In  the 
    future, then, the Air Force should be able to make positive statements, 
    reassuring  to  the public,  and to the effect that everything is  well 
    under control. 
    
                                                  Very truly yours, 
    
                                                  [unsigned] 
                                                  H. C. Cross
