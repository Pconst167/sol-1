                          UFO & The Learning Channel
                             by John N2IXW
 
        Sunday 10/24/94 I was watching TV, I was watching The Learning 
 Channel and a document show about UFO's. The show was all right. But and
 here comes They had it on with the heading of ( A Holloween Specials )
 of course even TLC doesn't take UFOLOGY seriously. When are people going
 to wake up. When it is to late. I was looking at another (Holloween Special)
 on CBS ch. 2. It had all rady started I knew it was a movie and not real,
 because it was on last year. It was about friendly Alien's trying to make
 connect with earth, and of course the Air Force Bombed the hell out of them
 so earth was destoryed. Now here's a bigger laugh Webster Dictionary doesn't
 take Ufology serious either Quote UFO n. An unidentified flying object such 
 as a space ship from another planet in the { Science fiction fil}, unquote.
        So where am I going with this. I am tick off people like myself who
 have had a sighting or more and may have been Abducted might as well bury
 our heads in the sand right wrong! We have to keep on punching and picking
 our way throw, Talking to people about the subject on UFOLOGY until the
 people of this planet wake up or it is going to be to late. How are we to
 change the news media thats a od question? Maybe some of you who work in
 the news media can do something. I don't know but what ever we do we better
 do it fast. There has been more and more sightings every year. Are we going
 to be invded. For real or what I cannot answer that question. Only you can
 answer that one. 
        I know that the TV media are putting on UFO stuff to bring up 
 their ratings. After the Larry King show it seem to me all of the TV
 stations were putting on something about UFO's. Now not so many networks
 are doing anything about the UFO subject. Only Holloween Specials. Let us
 see after holloween is over if TV is going to put on any UFO documented
 shows. I live in Newark N.J. an it is a big city it has a large news paper
 but I have never seen any thing about any UFO sightings Not even my own.
        OMNI magazine is the only one who has pick up on it. Not that I was
 looking for any publicity I was not. But for week after week when a major
 sighting like the one in Mich. happened early this year in March the same
 time we here n the Newark area had one also there was one in Mass. were
 a small plane was Abducted and even the mayor up there said he witnessed it.
 Nothing on TV or Radio or the news Papers. We had to hear about it throw 
 the grape vine. Or on a show called {Sightings Or Encounters}. I heard about
 it onthe UFO net on 80 meters. If I was not an amatuer radio operator I
 would not even know about the other sightings. This is the only way I know
 how to get out my frustrations is to write about it and put it on PAKET
 so you know you are not alone in you frustrations either. Other wise it 
 will get lost. So by me putting on PAKET the UFO files that I have  it
 doing any GOOD or is it just a big joke. Here it is 1994 and people still
 think the UFO subject is for Holloween. 
 What do you think, I would like to hear from all of you who feel the 
 same way. I really DO NOT want to hear from the Skepics I hear enough of 
 that on Radio phone and TV. From John N2IXW 73's 76's KEEPING LOOKING UP AT
 THE SKYS.
