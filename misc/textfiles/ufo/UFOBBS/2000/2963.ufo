     Joe Balsamo: Hello
     David/Moderator: Hello
     Joe Balsamo: I'm starting to feel lonely, Dave, we are the only ones here!
     David/Moderator: No prblem, Peter Baitz promised he'd be here!
     Joe Balsamo: Whoops! My Smart Alarms just told me it's time for the UFO 
             | CO!!!
     David/Moderator: We still got 5 minutes anyway.
             | And here's Rilla!
     Joe Balsamo: Hmm...my clock must be fast
     David/Moderator: I hope you got your suit and tie on, this is a formal CO 
             | you know!
     Joe Balsamo: Ahh, so it is (starting to feel less lonely already:-) )
             | Suit...suit, heck, I've got on my Tux!
     David/Moderator: I hope Peter makes it alright, he's never been in a CO 
             | before and may have trouble.  He using the old command mode way 
             | of doing
             | things.
             | Peter be here!!!!!!
     Joe Balsamo: Well, I can see everyone that just enters the forum on MAC 
             | CIM, so we can always give him instructions
             | HHello Peter
     Peter Baitz: Hello
     Joe Balsamo: Hello Dennis
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Hello all, what's happening?
     David/Moderator: Welcome Peter, gald you could make it!
     Peter Baitz: I am too!
     David/Moderator: We have 3 minutes will CO time, so we're waiting.
     Joe Balsamo: Looks like we are going to have a nice CO today!
     David/Moderator: Its about time!
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Dave, I didn't know there was a CO, saw the crowd 
             | and thought to drop in... ;)
             | What's the CO on?
     David/Moderator: Well, heck Welcome anyway!  Neil forgot to post the News 
             | flash for me!
             | The CO is on UFO's!
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Oh, ok.
     David/Moderator: Still interesting I hope?
     Joe Balsamo: Dennis, we'd really appreciate it if you'd hang with us for 
             | at least a little while
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Sure, don't know how long I will be able to hang 
             | around, but will see what's going on.
     David/Moderator: Good enough, Peter you still out there?  Having any 
             | trouble?
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: I have a friend that swears that there is a room in 
             | her house that people
     Peter Baitz: New he!I am here.  I understand we may talk of the database 
             | also?
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: have been abducted from by UFO's and when they are 
             | brought back they have...
     David/Moderator: Yes, and the UFO Shuttle video as well.
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: a splitting headache and marks on their necks.
     David/Moderator: Dennis, does you friend of CIS access?
             | I mean 'have CIS access"
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Not usually, but I could go over there one day and 
             | log on from her house...
             | and let her use my account.  She does have the equipment.
     David/Moderator: It would be interesting to perhaps have them join a CO 
             | of ours, and just tell us about here story.
     Joe Balsamo: That would be fantastic.
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: I will see what I can do, she is a very private type 
             | and is worried that if...
     David/Moderator: If need be, I could arrange a one time, free account for 
             | here to use for a temporary time.  Would that be better?
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: her neighbors found out that they would get violent. 
             |  There is a lot of Klan
             | activity out where she lives.
     Joe Balsamo: She could remain totally anonymous.
     David/Moderator: She wouldn't have to use her own name.
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Dave, either way would be ok, I have to talk with 
             | her tho to see what happens.
     Joe Balsamo: Dave, do you think we ought to start, or wait a bit longer 
             | for more to show?
     David/Moderator: Good enought Dennis, let me know what she says.  Are we 
             | all ready to begin?
     Peter Baitz: !!
     Joe Balsamo: Yup
     David/Moderator: Peter, you have something to say?
     Peter Baitz: TryinTJust trying to get used to this!  I'm using DOS 
             | commands
             | Not you interface,
             | ok
             | Who all is out there?
             | Hello?
     David/Moderator: We'll still here
     Joe Balsamo: I think we lost Peter
     David/Moderator: Peter you still out there?
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: Nope, Peter is still here
     User 4  | Hello- I'm back- seem yoYes. Seem to have gotten kicked out.
             | Can you read my entries?
     David/Moderator: What happened to your name Peter?
     User 4  | I do not know.  
             | I see David and Joe.
     David/Moderator: No problem, I can figure it out!  Ok people if we're 
             | ready I'm going to start....anything else?
     Joe Balsamo: Well, I count four of us here, that may be the group for 
             | today.
     David/Moderator: Good enough, time to start now....
             | First a brief synopsis of the rules....
             | In this formal conference I will be the moderator and will keep 
             | track of whose turn it is to speak.....
             | PLEASE don't interrupt the person speaking until it is your 
             | turn...
             | when you have a question type a ?, if you have a comment type a 
             | !,
             | I will then call your name in turn.   As you type, please end 
             | each of your lines with ..., so we know that your still talking.
             | When you have finished talking, at the end of your last line 
             | add GA, so mean  Go Head, so we know to continue. 
             | Does everyone understand?...ga
     Dennis Mahlmeister/: aye
     User 4  | Yes. GA
     Joe Balsamo: yup
     David/Moderator: OK....
             | the primary part of this CO is about the UFO database, then we 
             | will discuss the UFO Shuttle video as seen on.....
             | Hards Copy the other day.
             | Does everyone have a basic understanding of the UFO database? 
     User 4  | ?
     David/Moderator: GA Peter
     User 4  | I read about it briefly in the last CO.  Perhaps a 1-liner 
             | would help...,
             | begin this.  GA
     David/Moderator: OK...
             | The basic idea here is to design and implement a international 
             | UFO database, using this Forum as its home base...
             | this database will contain ALL information about UFO research, 
             | i.e. sightings, abductions, theories, work, evidence, alien 
             | contact,
             | just about everything that can be added...Does that explain 
             | things pretty well?
     User 4  | ?
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | This would be a down/uploadable info-base for various computers 
             | or
             | something online.GA
     David/Moderator: At first it would be a downloadable database system 
             | yes...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: eventually we will hopefully be able to go to an online 
             | system, at least we hope so....
             | The only people really uploading to the database would be those 
             | make contributions to the database, and then
             | only a select few would be able to upload a revised copy, to 
             | keep from having multiple copies of the database....
             | sitting out in the File base....
             | Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Thanks...I think that Dave covered it pretty well, but as I 
             | see it, there are two major objectives...
             | First we need to actually gather data.  Design some kind of 
             | form that people can download and fill out in regards to their 
             | sightings...
     User 4  | ?
     Joe Balsamo: Secondly, we need to actually come up with a database system 
             | that allows search criteria, reporting, etc. etc. At this stage 
             | of the 
             | game, we are still designing everything...
             | ust trying to get a solid group of volunteers. GA
     David/Moderator: If I may add...
             | we also want to encourage people to upload to us any private 
             | research they themselves may have done....
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | For the database, is an existing package to be used or are you 
             | doing...,
             | some program for it like Dataflex , etc.  or QBASIC...., C?
             | GA
     David/Moderator: Good point...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: We're hashing it out, thats why we're here (hehe), we 
             | NEED to make it available for as many different comptuer types 
             | as possible...
             | Does anybody have any suggestions?
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Joe  > GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Hang on a sec Peter, its Joes' turn, Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I was going to say pretty much what you said.  This is only 
             | the 2nd CO ever, so the most important thing is to get the core 
             | group 
             | of solid volunteers...
             | then we can decide from there. GA
     David/Moderator: OK Peter  > GA
     User 4  | Didn't mean to stomp on Joe.  Most IBM computers with DOS have 
             | BASIC...,
             | available.  Programmers and "normal" people. GA
     David/Moderator: True...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: but do we really want to program up a private systems of 
             | our own?  Then, what about MAC's, and Apples' and so forth?
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I would suggest that we consider using FoxPro.  It runs on 
             | both Macs and PCs and we can compile EXEs with it...
             | so noone really has to have the native language itself. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | That sounds fine.  I am not familiar with Apples.  Can they use 
             | ACSII data? GA
     David/Moderator: OK...
     Joe Balsamo: Yes
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: JOE, you spoke outta turn, nasty nasty!
             | Peter > GA
     Joe Balsamo: ...whoops
     User 4  | So if IBSo if IBM and Apples use ASCII data, even if FoxPro is 
             | not used...,
             | a max of two programs would need to be written for the two OSs 
             | GA
     David/Moderator: OK...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: What about the deal of having a comma delimited ASCII 
             | file, then we could include a record layout so that others
             | could then just import it into there favorite db package....
             | Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Actually, David, I think your idea is valid.  IF we 
             | structure the data properly, then people can use whatever 
             | package they want for 
             | analysis. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter, what do you think of that ideas?  GA
     User 4  | I think this is fine.  Otherwise people may dislike "our" 
             | database...,
             | and resort to their own package anyway.  GA
     David/Moderator: Good point...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: besides I think we're all programmers here, and I don't 
             | know if we could write something for Apples, Ataris's and all 
             | the others.
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: It would definetly be a full time job just in 
             | itself.....Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I think we need to concentrate our efforts on the structure, 
             | gathering and verification of the data itself...
             | this is going to be the bulk of making this a viable project.  
             | GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | I think creating the structure is the best start. Also, side 
             | point...,
             | Novell Networks for one allow sharing of ASCII between IBM and 
             | Apples. GA
     David/Moderator: Good point...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: another thing I'd like to add, we must establish a group 
             | of people we can all rely on to do their part,...
             | Joe and I have pretty much agreed to give whatever time we 
             | have, to doing this thing.  Can we count on you to help out 
             | Peter?....
             | Joe, a sec, Peter > GA
     User 4  | Yessir!!
             | GA
     David/Moderator: Excellent, Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I was going to suggest that one way we can use to get an 
             | idea of the structure is to analyze any current collections of 
             | data...
             | such as those held by MUFON, CUFOS, Hopkins, or whomever.  From 
             | there, we can use their ideas and meld them with our own to 
             | come up 
             | with a format. GA
     David/Moderator: Good point...
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: but I also think we should start working on our own 
             | format, until, and if, we find anything out from those 
             | people....
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | I have just (really) recently begun with this UFO stuff.  I 
             | have always read...
             | up, etc... So I am not aware of the various organizations ...,
             | I have heard of some, but do not really know them nor their 
             | formats for...
             | investgation and databases.  I would look into this. GA
     David/Moderator: Your not alone....
             | All UFO researchers, and organizations, have there own 
             | databases, but the problem is that ordinary people...,
             | like ourselves, don't have access to them.  This db would be 
             | availble to everyone and anyone....
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: but I am not so if these other UFO researchers are going 
             | to be of much help to us!
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | So, most of these organizations would not be willing to work 
             | with CIS...,
             | or us to import some of their info. GA
     David/Moderator: I don't know, Joe what do you think?  Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Well, I have not explored it fully yet...
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: I have contacted MUFON, a group I belong to, and have not 
             | heard back from them yet.  I have also gotten involved with a 
             | local...
             | group called ORION that is by invitation only...if I am 
             | accepted into the group, I will see if they can be of help...
             | they have many members involved in all of the BIG UFO 
             | organizations. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | There is a upload of 3(?) test files containing addresses of 
             | some pages...,
             | worth of groups.  Perhaps any # of there.  Letters, contacts, 
             | etc.GA
             | Of these...
     David/Moderator: I have some addresses and phone #'s as well..
             | I was contacted by the local MUFON director last night, about a 
             | letter I sent him in regard to this db idea,
             | he said it was indeed interesting, but also said he wasn't sure 
             | if MUFON would like to really 'contribute to it very much".. So
             | I don't know....
             | Joe, any thoughts > GA
     Joe Balsamo: This is the problem with these UFO groups...
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: there seems to be a lot of infighting, back biting and 
             | information hiding...Not everyone, but just enough that it 
             | makes this kind 
             | of research very difficult to say the least. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | Do we have access to government reports of any kind , etc. Just 
             | to start...,
             | the database. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter...
             | we have documents gained from the government through the 
             | Freedom of Infomration Request, and Joe and I both....
             | have some extensive data of our own with which we could 'seed' 
             | the database....
             | The biggest worry that bother me is all the other Projects I've 
             | seen that have fallen by the wayside becuase of stuff that....
             | Joe mentioned before, the back biting and so forth, that is why 
             | I've got the feeling that we should start working....
             | on our own system, and then if these other groups want to help, 
             | or contribute, we can always 'modify' our layout a little bit...
             | I'd just hate to see this thing get tied up in 'Red Tape'...
             | GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I think that at this time, it might be good to discuss some 
             | goals and try and have a plan of action by our next CO....
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: So far, the only people we have comitted to do work are the 
             | 3 of us, so I don't know if we should just take the ball and 
             | run or get 
             | more involved, what do you guys think? GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | We will probably break this work up.... Perhaps we can come up 
             | with some
             | topics and assign some research for next CO.  IE. Each topic 
             | ...,
             | broken into a datastructure.  GA
     David/Moderator: Joe, comments?  > GA
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: That sounds fine to me...
             | do you think we should each come up with a form that might be 
             | useful or what? GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | We could all work on some heading related but seperate and add 
             | them...,
             | together or all come up with a complete datastructure and 
             | compare notes...,
             | by uploading each others work.  Hmmm.  GA
     David/Moderator: Not a bad idea...
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: In fact a pretty good idea, each of us could come up 
             | with his own idea of the structure of the thing, ...
             | and then we could compare notes.  Peter > GA
     User 4  | Since you two seem to be a little more advanced in this, maybe 
             | we can...,
             | throw around some ideas for this... make a sketch.GA
     David/Moderator: Good for me...
             | Let me give you an idea of my personal database I use at home...
     User 4  | !!
     David/Moderator: ................Peter > GA
     User 4  | I just want to make sure I can get a copy of this for review. GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: I think that Peter's idea is good.  We should each come up 
             | with our own database form, upload it or whatever, and then 
             | next CO, we 
             | can synthesize something from that...
             | ps we should make a gerneral request of the entire forum via 
             | NEWS or whatever and get other ideas as well. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | I think getting info from others is good to, but a final 
             | date...,
             | may be necessary to get it moving.  We should also have a 
             | general...,
             | sketch of what we are looking for - maybe an outline of records 
             | and...,
             | fields. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter,...
             | as for getting a copy of this CO, Joe and I are recording it, 
             | and one of us will upload a transcript of it either later 
             | tonight,...
             | or tomorrow, so you'll be able to download it from the file 
             | section....
             | Anyway....Joe comments > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Well, first off, I think the idea of a deadline is a good 
             | one.  It should be a few days before the next CO so we can be 
             | prepared to 
             | discuss the various formats...
             | ou think we should schedule our next CO? GA
     David/Moderator: Good idea, do yopu think 2 weeks from now would give us 
             | enough time to compile together some data....anyone > GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | Sounds fine - 2 wks.  Shall we  sketch it out, what you all 
             | think? GA
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: 2 weeks is good for me...and, what, 'couple days before that 
             | the deadline for the submission of ideas for the database 
             | format?...
             | Perhaps you can get Neil to post this in the proper place. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | 2 weeks is ok for me - let me know the exact date.  I was going 
             | to...,
             | kid Joe he is watching Star Trek or something. GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I was just going to let peter in on my secret...I'm actually 
             | soliciting for contributors to this meeting! GA
     David/Moderator: Joe is being a biut bothersome to others!
             | OK....
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Why don't we say this, I'll act as central point here, 
             | you and Joe, upload and send any messages or files about 
             | this....
             | thing directly to me, I will then forward them on to the other 
             | in involved.  We can do this via E-mail directly to each....
             | other instead of cluttering up the FIle base here......
             | Peter > GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | So you would like us to find some ...I am unclear as to how you 
             | will conduct the search for others ideas.GA
     David/Moderator: First...
             | I think we're talking about each of us working out his own idea 
             | as to the structure to this database.....Joe > GA
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: David, what I would also suggest is you (being the big 
             | kahuna and all :))  draft a little blurb for Neil to post...
             | This blurb would basically explain the db idea and ask for 
             | group submissions to your PIN that would be the db description, 
             | the form 
             | if you will.
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Good enough............Peter > GA
     User 4  | Ok. So Joe, myself and David will upload our own data-structure 
             | ideas...,
             | to David, and this pending post for  Neil will allow others to 
             | ...,
             | upload theirs to David, all due a couple days befor the next 
             | CO...,
             | at whuich time it will all come together. GA
     David/Moderator: Yes....
             | I will draft a little *blurb* and see if I can talk Neil into 
             | posting into the New Flash, asking each for there ideas on .....
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: how to basically structure this thing.  In the mean 
             | time, you and Joe, will upload your ideas directly to me, via 
             | E-mail...
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | I don't know about u guys, but I hate news blurbs unless they 
             | are really...
             | interesting looking...maybe because I use DOS and not the 
             | interfaces u ...,
             | use.   It should be really eye attacting. GA
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Peter makes a good point, perhaps we should ask Neil if 
             | there is any other method of letting users know what's going 
             | on...BTW, 
             | Peter, you may want to d/l CIM, it is a really cool program and 
             | I believe the d/l is free. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter....
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: CIM is what we use, and it only costs $10.00, then CIS 
             | give you $10.00 free usage, so its basically free.  Its makes...
             | things like this much much easier!...
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | Great!  Where do I obtain it...forum.?  GA
     David/Moderator: Joe, where do you get the thing?
     Joe Balsamo: It is in the CIM forum, I believe, just do GO CIM
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: GO CIM, that will at least tell you were to go from 
             | there!
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | Thanks all.  Ok. Shall we throw around some basic ideas for the 
             | structure...,
             | or just do it solo and upload.......or where do we go with this 
             | now.GA
     David/Moderator: Joe, care to elaborate here....GA
     Joe Balsamo: Well, I think that we may want to have the basic stuff...
             | type of encounter, date, time, location, description, number of 
             | witnesses, etc. that should be good for a start...
             | the more fields we have, the more selective our data inquiries 
             | will be, of course. GA
     David/Moderator: Also...
     User 4  | !!
     David/Moderator: my database system I use has a field that points to a 
             | file name, to obtain more detailed info....
             | sometimes 15 or 20 pages worth....
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | How about C.Encounter type I, II , III etc with varied fields 
             | applying to...,
             | each. GA
     *SYSTEM*| Switching to Formal Conferences (R1)
     David/Moderator: OK ....
             | I uploaded to Joe, a new classifications system I found, and 
             | enhanced...
             | that helps to make classifying these much easier, and you can 
             | better taylor it to the type of sighting....
             | we will need to include that in the file layout, and I will 
             | send the classification system to you Peter, so you have a 
             | copy..GA
     User 4  | ok
     David/Moderator: Joe, comments > GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I believe that file is also in the library, is it not?  
             | Also, the nice thing about that new system is that it also ...
             | lets one assign a factor of believability to the sighting. GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | Ok. I will def. look at the new system.  Any suggested reading 
             | for these...,
             | classification methods from various UFOlogists/groups? GA
     David/Moderator: Joe, I think this guy is a minded reader!....
             | The classification system isn't in the library, but I'll upload 
             | it later....
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: also, about the books, Joe and I have been compling a 
             | must read book list, so you'll have a list as soon as we're 
             | done.....
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | I have also seen - in a report - a page for drawings - sky 
             | drawings...,
             | or whatever a person can do as part of the report.GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: That is an excellent point! We should consider including 
             | GIFs with the reports.  David has a scanner, so he could scan 
             | in any 'hand 
             | drawings'.GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | Most IBM compatible scanning software I've seen uses PCX or 
             | TIFF or others..,
     Joe Balsamo: !
     User 4  | like this but not GIF. !
     David/Moderator: Peter, my scanning software will alos use GIF, and let 
             | me add....
             | that I can scan drawings, sketches, photos, just about 
             | anything, in 256 grey scal colors.  Does an excellent job on....
             | Playboy centerfolds!........Joe > GA
     User 4  | !
     Joe Balsamo: My only reason for suggesting GIF is because it is CIS's own 
             | format.  Theoretically, anyone with CIS can use GIF. GA
     David/Moderator: Well, I can do GIF so no prblem there.......Peter > GA
     User 4  | I downloaded GRAPHSHOP so it can handle or covert all of 
             | these....,
             | No actual problem here. GA
     David/Moderator: Also....
             | I use PhotoFinish by ZSoft, and it will import, convert, save, 
             | load, anything in over 20 different formats so we're set...
             | I also use OmniPage to OCR text and import it into my word 
             | processor, so we can also use that feature...GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | We have a Panasonic scanner at Optus (we develop FACSys) and 
             | use Calera...,
             | for scanning needs.... so we all use great stuff. GA
     Joe Balsamo: BRB
     David/Moderator: Joes gonna check something out, he'll be back in a 
             | sec....
             | This ideas of your is wonderfull, I didn't think of it, we 
             | could inlude actual photographs taken from eyewitness 
             | encounters....
             | my software also allow me to do some photo-analysis, which 
             | would com ein handy as well....GA
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     User 4  | Which sort of leads us to the video... after we tie up the 
             | database ideas.GA
     David/Moderator: Good point, I wouold like to discuss the video as 
             | well....
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: Do you think we've covered enough on the DB to at least 
             | start working out a format of some kind...Peter > GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     User 4  | Yes.  I will look at the system you recommended and draw on it. 
             |  Do you...,
             | tthink this system is good on its own? GA
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I was just thinking that we may want to participate in the 
             | paranormal forum discussion on the video...what do you guys 
             | think ga
     David/Moderator: Joe, bows to me....
             | Peter > GA
     User 4  | Who is doing the paranormal CO? What's the topic(s) ? GA
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
     David/Moderator: Peter....
     Joe Balsamo: They are having a discussion on the NASA UFO film that was 
             | shown on hardcopy, it might be interesting for us to get 
             | involved in 
             | their discussion. GA
     David/Moderator: the paranormal section of the Issues Forum is about to 
             | have a CO on the Shuttle video, Joe and I were just 
             | discussing....
     Joe Balsamo: I;m heading over there, c you guys in a bit
     User 4  | !
     David/Moderator: the possiblity of ending this CO and venturing over 
             | there...what do you think......Peter > GA
     User 4  | Yes.  Where is it?
             | GA

             | Paranormal section, we can meet in the CO....
     User 4  | OK
     David/Moderator: but a word of caution, there are some hard lined 
             | sketptics over there that can get REALLY RUDE, so watch you 
             | back....GA
