     Well, here we are again!  This month, there are articles concerning Gulf 
Breeze, the "UFO COVER-UP? LIVE" show, and other topics concerning space and 
the UFO phenomenon.
     As we all know, Gulf Breeze, a town in Florida, has been having numerous
sightings, both in the air and on the ground.  The number of people who have 
experienced these sightings is staggering!  AND IT'S STILL GOING ON!!
     Also included are recent cases handled by MUFON investigators.

GULF BREEZE, FLORIDA  (from the Gulf Breeze Sentinel Newspaper)
                         

Strange sightings are still happening around the town of Gulf Breeze.  Art-
icles from the "Gulf Breeze Sentinel" attest to this.  Lynn Soley, an Artist
who lives in Gulf Breeze and her husband saw a object in the sky about 10:00
p.m. monday, April 20.  "It was flashing red, yellow, green, and blue lights,
with a white light.  And then, on the upper right hand side and from time to 
time, it would move down the lower right side and then over to the lower left
hand corner of the thing."

"At one point, it turned on it's side or something and the white light was in
the center with red flashing lights going around it in a circle.  Then, when 
we lost sight of it, we rode over to Shoreline Park where we saw three more 
like it.  Then we saw, in one part of the sky, what looked like a big, bright
star.  The funny thing was, though, when the four UFO's vanished, so did the 
big white star.  It disappeared too."

"While at Shoreline Park, we ran into a fisherman and a man walking his dog.  
They were looking at it.  We were all sharing the binoculars.  And then very 
shortly, came Gulf Breeze Police and two police officers saw it.  They had 
our binoculars.  We shared binoculars."

"And then my brother-in-law, who we walked with to the car, has been in radar 
with the NAVY ten years active duty and twenty with the Reserves.  He said he 
didn't recognize it as anything he had ever seen in the Navy, and that the 
lighting on it was not like any aircraft lighting that he had seen before."  
"No, no noise at all.  It just hovered there and from time to time they'd go 
up, down, or left to right, but they were moving kind of slow.  You
figure we watched them for about three hours until they got so tiny you could 
barely see them anymore, and that's when the big, bright 'star' was gone.

                                   _____

(The following article is from a writer on the staff of the Gulf Breeze 
Sentinel, Kimberly Stevenson)

     Since the first report of UFO sightings over Gulf Breeze, I have 
diligently watched the sky for a glimpse of these extraterrestrial visitors.  
A few times I thought I had seen something unusual, but still a bit of skep-
ticism prevailed.

     However, On April 27th, a Thursday night about 9:30, I routinely looked
out my back door towards the City of Gulf Breeze, hoping again these UFO's 
would make an appearance so that I could see them.

     I was amazed to see something different in the sky.  I walked out on my 
back deck, turning off the kitchen light as I stepped out and watched as a 
bright object shot at a tremendous speed down and diagonally across the sky.
It then made a circular pattern, then shot straight up.  The whole time it 
radiated colors from it that grew in intensity from white, to blue, to green, 
to red.  No blinking lights, just radiating colors of a nature I have never 
seen.

     I have lived in this area for seven years and have watched the sky on 
numerous occasions and am quite familiar with the air traffic in the sky.  I
am very familiar with aircraft of all sorts and know what a airplane, jet, 
helicopter and yes, the Goodyear Blimp look like in the sky.  I can assure 
you that what I saw was not any of these.

     As I watched this object, which appeared to be right over the area of 
Shoreline Park, I reached inside the house and called an associate from work 
who came immediately to my house with a friend.  I also called my neighbors 
next door, who came out on their balcony and watched the object and said that 
they could see two of them.  We watched the object for at least 30 minutes.  
It sat in one spot for a very long time, then began to slowly descend and 
move westerly towards Perdido.  I called a friend, Kenneth Payne in Perdido 
who was at work.  He went outside with two other co-workers and they all saw 
the bright object and confirmed it was moving slowly.  This was a little 
after 10 p.m.

     Another young man on the beach was also watching the object and we 
talked on the phone with him as he looked at it through his binoculars; he 
too said he thought he saw more than one.  He was not available for an inter-
view at the time this story was written but will tell his story this week, 
along with other sightings he had on Saturday and Monday.

     I have written several stories about other people's experiences of UFO 
sightings and always believed them, but I am sincerely convinced now that 
something strange is flying over Gulf Breeze.

     Many reports of sightings have been flooding into THE SENTINEL since 
last Thursday night.  A report of a sighting on Tuesday night, May 02, was 
from a woman who wished to remain anonymous, called saying her and her family
were eating at Pizza Hut when they saw a bright object, they left the rest-
aurant and followed it up Highway 98 to Shoreline Park where several people 
already there with binoculars watching it.  One gentleman she said shared his 
binoculars with them.  The woman reporting the sighting, whose son-in-law was 
a pilot, said he saw a shape.  It had shining red, green, and white bright 
lights.  The man with the binoculars told the group that he had seen the UFO 
on other occasions and when he saw it last week, it was so close and bright, 
he could not continue to look at it.

     Anyone else who has had sightings recently, please contact THE SENTINEL.
If you are still a skeptic, like I was, start watching the sky, you might 
just see something that will change your mind.

"UFO COVER - UP? LIVE!" (1) 

     
      UFO  Magazine was privileged--or is the word cursed?--to  be
      let  in  on  the 'latest' inside information and  gossip  as  the
      production of "UFO Cover-up? Live!" developed over the course  of
      many  months in the latter part of 1988.  When the final  product
      aired on October 14 of that year, it was both more and less  than
      expected  by  the UFO Community--enlightening  some,  frustrating
      many,  and throwing most of us back into that  endless,  spinning
      circle  of  rumor  and speculation as to just  who  sits  at  the
      controls  when UFO information breaks into big media.   Barry  E.
      Taff  was the original writer hired to prepare the treatment  and
      screenplay  for  the  show.   The  following  is  his  firsthand
      impression  of  what transpired over the course  of  "UFO  Cover    
      Up? Live.  Though based on real events, the opinions he expressed
      should not be taken as reflecting those of either ParaNet or  UFO
      Magazine--Vicki Cooper/ASK UFO

                  "UFO Cover-Up? Live!":  The Untold Story

                              by Barry E. Taff

           During the course of development and production of the  two-
      hour,  prime-time  LBS syndicated special "UFO  Cover-Up?  Live!"
      wild  and  unsubstantiated rumors circulated throughout  the  UFO
      community  about what was happening, particularly in  regards  to
      what (or who) the sources of information were and who was calling
      the shots behind the scenes.

           As  the original writer for that much discussed show, I  can
      reveal  some  rather  startling,   although  perhaps   less-than-
      sensational  truths about what REALLY occurred during the  course
      of  the  production,  and  why  the  resulting  program  was   an
      amateurish  attempt at trying to chronicle and  document  current
      events and the history of ufology.

           I  was  hired  at  a salary  well  below  scale,  which  was
      acceptable  at  the time, for we all believed that  this  program
      would be the chance of a lifetime, especially considering some of
      the  creative staff:  Tracy Torme, Curt Brubaker, Bob  Emenegger,
      Marty  (J.R.) Pasetta, Jr.  During my initial interview  for  the
      job,  I  found  the producer to be extremely  friendly  and  very
      concerned that the end product of the show reflect a high caliber
      of writing regarding the show's topic or premise.

           The  situation couldn't have sounded any better,  and  given
      the involvement of associate and segment producers whom I already
      knew  and  had worked with, along with UFO  consultants  such  as
      William Moore, Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, it was  truly
      a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

           However,  after  being  told  that  the  show's  budget  was
      approximately  $1,250,000.00  only  later to learn  that  it  was
      closer  to $825,000.00, I began to worry that things  weren't  as
      they   seemed.   As  the  show  progressed  in  development   and
      production,  I discovered that I was hired for my vast  knowledge
      of  Ufology's  history, related technology  and  current  events.
      Although  as it turned out, this zeal was not shared in  entirety
      by the show's producer.

           As  we began to choose the sources of information and  those
      individuals  we  wished  to be associated with  the  show,  based
      entirely  on  the validity, accuracy and what we believed  to  be
      corroborating  evidence of their information,  incredible  rumors
      began to flourish that the show was being run and/or  manipulated
      by insiders who were supposedly government intelligence  officers
      from such agencies as CIA, NSA or even MJ-12.  This matter became
      so comical that the creative staff made up a batch of "MJ" cards,
      ranging  from one through twelve, and pasted one on each  of  our
      desks just to get a laugh when visitors came to the offices.

           Initially, the producer who will remain nameless  throughout
      this  piece  professed to having a strong and sincere  belief  in
      Ufology.  For all intents and purposes that appears to have  been
      true,  except for occasional asides where he demonstrated  a  far
      stronger interest in butts; both that of cigars and young women.

           About  a  third of the way into production, the  first  dark
      clouds appeared, signaling something ominous on the horizon.  The
      producer,  after having several meetings during  production  with
      "Condor"   and  "Falcon"--both  alleged  clandestine   government
      intelligence  sources for the show-began showing marked  symptoms
      of   paranoia.    He  became  quite  irascible,   demanding   and
      dictatorial  to  all  of the production  staff.   One  particular
      demonstration of this came when he spoke with me saying, "I  want
      you  to get into the possible government cover-up and  conspiracy
      based  on the data we've collected, but at the same time  I  want
      you to remain neutral in your approach."  To say that his request
      was  a contradiction in terms would be an understatement, not  to
      mention  an impossibility for any writer.  My job as  the  writer
      was to be as objective as possible, which accordingly meant  that
      I  was  to  demonstrate,  based on the  voluminous  data  at  our
      disposal, that a U.S. government conspiracy had in fact  occurred
      over the last 42 years and was still in effect.

           After  repeated  meetings with "Condor"  and  "Falcon",  the
      producer's attitude and orientation toward the show altered  even
      further.  His increasing paranoia and loss of objectivity  caused
      him  to ignore virtually every significant piece  of  information
      and  event  presented  to  him  in  the  treatment  and  original
      screenplay.   All attempts to persuade him to take seriously  the
      Freedom  of Information Act (FOIA) documents and data from  books
      like  Clear  Intent, Sky Crash, Intruders and Above  Top  Secret,
      along   with  facts  on  the  cattle  mutilation  mystery,   were
      fruitless.

           Under normal circumstances, a producer waits for a  finished
      first draft of a treatment and/or script before asking for a  re-
      write  if such is desired.  With the frenzied state of  mind  the
      producer was now in, he would demand to see every page as it  was
      written,  frequently lose it after it was turned in and  if  not,
      would ask for it to be rewritten because it didn't meet with his
      approval.   Because of his confused state of mind, he really  had
      no  idea  exactly  what he  wanted.   The  producer's  incredible
      indecisiveness  drove  the  creative  staff  to  distraction  and
      finally  to their wits end, as the show was on a very  short-term
      deadline.

           Yes,  we  did  have the cooperation  of  several  government
      intelligence  sources.   Emenegger  said he  would  talk  to  his
      sources about furnishing never-before-seen footage of a  supposed
      UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base.  Tracking camera  footage
      of  a  missile  launch depicting a UFO  paralleling  the  missile
      flight,  was  also,  at one point, made  available  from  another
      associate   of   Emenegger's.   Unfortunately,  both   of   these
      potentially  incredible  pieces of film footage  were  ultimately
      withheld.

           When  the final treatment and partially  completed  teleplay
      were  presented to the producer, his response was  shocking.   He
      rejected  them because they were too serious.  In the  producer'
      own  words:   "What you've given me here is totally  useless.   I
      can't use a single page of it.  I want copy, schlock,  camp...not
      screenwriting."   My  response was  simple  and  straightforward,
      "Don't you want a serious show that will blow people out of their
      chairs?   Aren't you concerned with the integrity and quality  of
      the  program?"   The producer simply stared into my face  with  a
      blank expression.

           At  this point, it became obvious to all on board  that  the
      show  was dramatically changing, and would not reflect the  title
      it  was promoting.  For this and many other reasons too  numerous
      and unrelated to mention here, many of the show's other prominent
      individuals  began  to slowly withdraw, such as  Emenegger,  Curt
      Brubaker and Tracy Torme.

           "UFO Cover-Up? Live!" had the potential for being one of the
      most  powerful  and  impacting pieces of  its  type  ever  aired.
      However, the producer did everything in his power to insure  that
      didn't  occur.  The  show's greatest enemy was  perhaps  not  the
      producer,  per se, but the fear and paranoia induced within  him.
      Is it only by chance that his paranoia became more obvious  after
      the aforementioned meetings with "Condor" and "Falcon"?

           From a viewer's standpoint, the show was rather pitiful.  It
      dragged, was incredibly redundant, never really got to the  point
      and was painfully studded with such professional gaffes as a  set
      of  horrid  glowing pyramids and supposedly live dialogue  by  in
      studio guests all obviously reading off teleprompters--except for
      the  skeptics.  All of this was the result of the producer's  re-
      orientation.

           Just  prior  to  the live studio  airing,  consultants  Bill
      Moore, Jaime Shandera and Bob Emenegger were so annoyed with  the
      producer's  altered  behavior that they began  playing  practical
      jokes on him right on the set, just to demonstrate how  intensely
      they disliked how they and the show were being mishandled.

           So if there's anyone you wish to blame for being deprived of
      what was promised, or why the show was more of a sedative than an
      eye-opening dramatic look at what's actually been transpiring  in
      ufology,  don't  blame  the original writer,  the  director,  the
      associate  or segment producers, who all knew their jobs and  did
      them  superbly.   The  producer's  paranoid  state  of  mind  and
      resultant change of attitude should catch the flak.  The question
      is, why did he suddenly change?  Just what influences caused it?

           In  actuality,  it would have been  really  interesting  and
      exciting  had  the  CIA, NSA or MJ-12  (presupposing  the  latter
      actually  exists)  infiltrated the production  and  attempted  to
      manipulate  the  show.   At  least  that  would  have  put   some
      excitement  into it.  It should be noted that later the  producer
      was  visited  by  a  local  FBI  agent--a  story  that  has  been
      confirmed--apparently to discuss the show and it's contents.  The
      reason  for this aftermath visit is not known to this  writer  or
      the  show's  other  production members, but  it  along  with  the
      repeated   visits  by  "Falcon"  and  "Condor"  may   have   also
      contributed  to the wild rumors, which still continue  to  plague
      the field.  As Tracy Torme once joked, "If someone's mustache  is
      crooked, MJ-12 must be sending a secret message!"

           Perhaps  the next time around, assuming there will  be  one,
      the  right production company will hire the right producer.   And
      perhaps that producer will give the show the proper guidance  and
      vitalization  to  convey the truth as opposed to  a  limited  and
      perhaps biased perspective, if not a totally unprofessional one.

TOMATO SEEDS?  ORBITING EARTH?                                         

Stillwater, OK (June 9) UPI - Somewhere out there in space, 12.5 million 
tomato seeds have been orbiting the earth for five years and catching a few 
rays.

Scientists plan to recover the seeds during another space shuttle flight in 
late November and return them to Oklahoma State University.

Nelson Ehrlich, director of the university's Aerospace Education Service Pro-
ject, said one thing scientists want most to know about the tomato seeds is 
the effect of cosmic radiation - good and bad.

The seeds, a hardy variety called "Rutgers California Supreme", were packed 
into aluminum canisters, then placed in a cylinder the size of a BUS and shot
into space in the cargo bay of a space shuttle in April 1984.

Ehrlich's calculations indicate the seeds have traveled more than 777 million
miles since the launch.

                                   _____

SUNSPOT ACTIVITY

Sunspot activity, which rises and falls in an 11 - year cycle, is continuing 
to grow in intensity at least as fast as, and possibly faster than, any of 
the 22 cycles recorded over the last 240 years, scientists of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found.

The unusually high sunspot incidence, first predicted a year ago, is expected 
to reach a peak in the next six to nine months.

As sunspot intensity increases, there will be more explosions of charged 
particles from the sun that shower the solar system.  When they reach earth,
the particles can disrupt radio communication, cause unusually bright 
displays of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, and heat the atmosphere 
so much it puffs up and brushes satellites.  One burst two months ago trig-
gered a major power blackout in eastern Canada.

UFO REPORTS / CASES

# 890104 :  Near Harrisburg, PA. Event date, December 4, 1988, 5:25 a.m.

     A state corrections officer (name withheld) was driving his car to his 
prison work site when he was blinded by a light, swerving to a halt on the 
road.  Departing the car, he tried to study the object but could not make out 
a shape due to its brilliance.  A strong wind emanated from either the object
or general weather conditions.  About 75 feet in diameter, the object was 
perhaps ovular, polished silver, and approximately 150 feet overhead.  A 
medium tone humming sound was distinct.  After an undetermined number of 
minutes, the vehicle departed, laterally at first, then vertically.  The 
witness then realized an auto a short distance ahead.  The motorist, an older
well-dressed man, exhibited tears and appeared terrified.  The man remarked 
that he had been returning from work, which the officer found odd.  He then 
felt the car hood, which was cold.

     Immediately following the incident, the officer experienced a severe 
"sunburn", vision and hearing difficulties, headache and dizziness, 
musculature aches and a skin rash.  His auto was coated with a thin coating
of material later analyzed by a laboratory as having high concentrations of 
particular elements.

     (Analysis:   A classic CE-2, faulted only by the fact that the officer, 
in the excitement of the moment, failed to obtain the second motorist's name 
or license number before he drove away.  Another prison officer verified 
hearing a humming sound from his home within minutes of the roadside 
encounter and in the direction which the object departed.  Highly 
significant).

# 890203 : Outside Belleville, IL. Event date, January 12, 1989, 10 p.m.
     Two young men driving along a state highway noticed a light that 
eventually grew in intensity.  A diamond-shaped base was determined, with 
white lights at the corners, an intense red light centered underneath.  
Stopping their car, they observed the vehicle as close as 100 feet during the 
5 minute duration.  No sound was detected.  The object then moved slowly off
and out of sight.

(Analysis:  Though collateral contacts were not initiated due to the invest-
igator's inexperience, the interview tape submitted underscores the witness'
seemingly genuine puzzlement, awe and dismay that other occasional motorists

# 890205:  Near Greens Fork, IN.  Event date, January 22, 1989, 9:30 P.M.
     A woman noticed a bright light over a neighboring farm (for the third 
successive evening) and so called the neighbors to alert them.  While engaged
in conversation, the light approached the callers home, revealing a bullet-
shaped vehicle adjudged to be 25 feet in length, with an exterior remindful 
of a spider web.  The object passed low overhead, no sound being detected.

(Analysis:  Contacts with police and others by the witnessing couple, 
together with honest puzzlement as assessed by the investigator, lend 
credence to the basic account.  The neighbors verified the intervening call.
Celestial and weather conditions and conventional aircraft were ruled out by
follow up evidence.)

# 890210:  Near Terre Haute, IN.  Event date, September 28, 1989, 12:30 A.M.
     A couple and young child were returning home when they noticed a 
grouping of bright lights in the sky which, growing in intensity, hurt their 
eyes.  Three miles farther, they pulled off the road to observe the lights 
more closely.  At that point, a triangular vehicle approached and hovered 25 
feet overhead.  Yellowish lights were at the corners, blue lights along the 
perimeter and a green light centered underneath that was bordered by two red 
lights.  A soft humming lowered in pitch as it descended.  The husband leaped 
into the truck, but it failed to start.  As the object reached it's closest 
point - 25 feet - a blue glow surrounded it.  After what was later 
determined to be about three minutes, the vehicle slowly drifted behind them 
and out of sight.  The following day the witnesses were greatly fatigued.  
The husband experienced a persistent headache.  Their wrist watches and the 
truck's dashboard clock all had lost three minutes.

(Analysis:  The couple had called a local airport, police and relatives 
immediately afterward.  Collateral contacts supported the witnesses' 
veracity.  The wife's dreams of a UFO encounter beforehand and certain fears 
expressed since are of ongoing concern, and the family is being loosely 
monitored.  A case of potentially high significance).

# 890301:  Event date, December 01, 1986. 5 P.M. 
     Duration 10 seconds.  A man was looking out a window when a shiny 
metallic "ball-type" object moved into view, then dipped, slowed, sped
up, circled and left in a controlled fashion.  Light rain was falling at the 
time (an uncommon occurrence).  At an estimated 500 feet, the object seemed 
to be about 10 feet above the ground at its lowest point and the size of a 
standard car in diameter.

     From the book, "CLEAR INTENT" (Prentice Hall), authors Lawrence Fawcett
and Barry J. Greenwood, concerning the governments former "Project Bluebook":

     "This excerpt from an October 20, 1969 Air Force document (FOIA 
obtained), revealed that Blue Book never received those reports that affected
national security: 'Reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect 
national security are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 
55-11 and are not part of the Blue Book system. As already stated, reports
of UFO's which could affect national security should continue to be handled
through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose.'  The 
document was signed by Brigadier General C. H. Bolender, the Air Force's 
Deputy Director of Development."
