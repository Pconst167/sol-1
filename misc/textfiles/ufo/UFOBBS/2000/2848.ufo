My family and I were staying in a campground at Horshum, England, near Gatwick 
Airport and about 50 miles south of London in the late summer of 1982 when we 
saw our first UFO. It was between late afternoon and evening, just as dusk 
started to set in, and wife and I had decided to go for a short walk. We 
hadn't gone far when our friend pointed to a bright object in the sky and some 
distance away--perhaps one-half mile.

When we wondered what it could be, our friend jokingly said ti might be a UFO. 
We laughed at her, and then started guessing at what else it might be. It 
couldn't be from the sun because the sky was slightly overcast and the clouds 
were wispy. It couldn't be a plane since it wasn't moving. It couldn't be 
reflections form a smelter, because there were no stacks in the area.

The brightness was sharply contained within the shape we  were seeing. Someone 
suggested it was a balloon but the shape wasn't right. Finally, I said, "Well, 
I'll believe it's a UFO if it finally moves and then moves quickly and doesn't 
change shape until it's out of sight." And that's exactly what it did. I just 
zoomed at warp speed from above us to the distant horizon in seconds, making a 
curve as it left us, just like in a science-fiction movie.

At the campground, people told us there had been numerous sightings in the 
area and showed us a newspaper article about a sighting made only a few days 
before. They also said we should report our sighting at the local police 
station. The next morning we went to the station but felt a little sheepish 
when the Constable asked what we wanted. To our surprise, he didn't look 
surprised at all. He just hauled our a ready-made form especially designed for 
UFO sightings! We still laugh about that.
