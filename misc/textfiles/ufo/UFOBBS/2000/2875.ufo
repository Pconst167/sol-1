                          Dellschau and other "Aeronauts"
                          by Jimmy Ward and P.G. Navarro

       Among the thousands of drawings of  strange  and  wondrous  aircraft
       produced by Dellschau are notations, remarks, and comments;  some in
       "clear" and some in code which, when pieced together, tell the story
       of a group   of  industrious,  aeronautically-minded  inventors  who
       gathered in and around the towns of  Sonora and Columbia, California
       about the middle  of  the  19th century.  They were  members  of  an
       "Aeroy Club", which  was  the  original  name  of  the club, but was
       changed to the "Sonora Aero Club"  in 1858 after becoming associated
       with a Society "back East" known as NYMZA.  Most of  the  members of
       the Sonora Aero  Club  were  German  immigrants,  with  at least two
       Spanish or Mexican  members,  one   Frenchman,  and  three  or  four
       Englishmen.

       The towns of  Sonora  and  Columbia  were  not  the   movie   or  TV
       stereotypes of goldfish  towns,  which  picture  the  inhabitants of
       mining towns in   those   days  as   rough-shod,   unmannerly,   and
       unschooled.  It was  on  March 27, 1850 that Dr. Thaddeus  Hildreth,
       his brother George,  and  a  handful  of prospectors made their camp
       near the site of what was to become Columbia.  They found gold there
       and the stampede was on.  Before the  month  was out there were some
       5,000 prospectors in the area and a thriving tent  and  shanty  town
       was born.

       At first it  was called Hildreth's Diggings, then American Camp, and
       finally Columbia.  Streets were laid  out and the tents and shanties
       replaced by more  permanent structures.  By the end  of  1852  there
       were more than  150  places  of business (including 30 saloons and a
       brewery), a church, Sunday School,  Masonic Lodge, and even a branch
       of the Sons of Temperance.  In 1854, fire destroyed everything in

                                      Page 1

       the center of  business  district except for one brick building.  In
       the next year and a half some 30  buildings  were  built,  this time
       from locally produced red brick.

       In 1854, following  the  fire,  the  New England Water  Company  was
       organized and supplied  the town with its own water for domestic use
       and fire protection and, in July  1855,  the  first  piped water was
       made available.

       In August 1857,  a second fire ravaged the town's business  district
       and destroyed nearly  all  structures in a 15 block area.  Following
       this fire, a volunteer fire department  was organized and a new fire
       engine was purchased.

       By 1860 the  town  had  the usual Mexican fandango  halls,  gambling
       parlors, saloons and  other  "houses"  of diversion so common to all
       mining towns in  those  days, but  there  were  also  more  cultural
       establishments such as   small   circuses  and  theatrical   groups,
       volunteer military companies,  bands,  and choral groups.  There was
       even a two-story brick schoolhouse.

       Sonora, just 6 miles south, was even less like the stereotype mining
       town and even contained several  book  stores  that  did  a thriving
       business.  It was  the cultural center of the area,  and  the  ideal
       location for a   group   of   intelligentsia   engaged   in   secret
       experiments.  Dellschau states that the group held their meetings in
       Sonora, but they built and tested  their  craft  near  Columbia  and
       stored their dismantled  craft in buildings in Columbia.   Dellschau
       claims that an  airship,  which they called the "Aero Dora" had been
       built by August Schoetler, tested,  and  stored  in Columbia.  Also,
       what is now the Columbia Airport is the only level  area  for  miles
       around and would  have made an ideal test site.  With all the mining
       equipment and building supplies pouring  into  Sonora  and Columbia,
       parts for the  secret craft would have passed unnoticed.   The  only
       problem would be  keeping the test flights secret, but even the most
       ardent prospectors did not work all  day,  every day, and care could
       have been taken  to  fly  only  when  the  "coast was  clear".   The
       airships were equipped  with  wheels  (many were self-propelled) and
       they could have been assembled and  stored  in a nearby location and
       wheeled out when  the time was ripe for testing.   This  would  have
       been simple enough  to  do  since the body fo the craft was wood and
       all the external equipment, such  as  landing  gear,  paddle wheels,
       etc. was bolted on.

       This equipment could have been placed inside the body  of  the craft
       and transported as  if  they  were  large borax or equipment-hauling
       wagons, which would have attracted  no  special  notice.   The  only
       attention it might  have attracted would have been  because  of  the
       strange and unusual  appearance,  but  in those days there were many
       strange types of  wagons which were  used  for  different  purposes.
       Only after it was re-assembled and the gas bag was attached would it
       lose its appearance  as  a wagon and look like the  airship  it  was
       intended to be.

       One aircraft that  could  have been easily transformed was the "Aero
       Goeit".  This airship contained  a  section  which  could  have been
       changed to the appearance of a gypsy wagon.  The section  behind the
       main body was  like  a  coal-tender  behind  a  locomotive,  but its
       purpoer was to  hold  additional  gas  (for  lift)  and  to  provide
       locomotion.
                                      Page 2

       Incidentally, Goetz's Aero Goeit was flown over the California giant
       redwoods area and became entangled in one of the trees, resulting in
       the death of  one  of the club members.  The caption on this drawing
       reads:

            "Brother Goetz, you gready guts, What you mean whit
             your one man flying trapp?

            "Brother Newell, I mean One man is enough to breack
             his neck".

       Another aircraft that was readily  adaptable  as  a land vehicle was
       the "Crippel Wagon",  designed and built by F.W. Schultze.   It  was
       originally designed as  a  land-traveling vehicle and was called the
       "Crippel Wagon Hydro-whir Auto".   This vehicle was presumably built
       for land use, but was later outfitted with a gas bag and a converter
       by August Schoetler  who turned it into a flying machine.   However,
       it appears that  due  to  some  indiscretion  of  Schoetler's, which
       compromised the organization by divulging  matters  of secret trust,
       the plans for further development of the Auto-Aero  was discontinued
       and the machine  was  dismantled.   The  possibilities  for  all the
       undertakings mentioned above are there, only the proof is lacking.

       In reply to a letter, listing the  names  of all known club members,
       which was sent to Mr. Carlo De Ferrari, County Historian  at Sonora,
       by one of the authors, Mr. De Ferrari had this to say:

          "I have  run  the list of 62 names through my indices, but I have
           been unable to identify a single  individual.   Unless the names
           are aliases or in code, they seem to have no local connections.

          "The area  you  identify  as  being  where  the experiments  were
           conducted (now  the  Columbia Airport) was known as the Lawndale
           Gulch and French Gulch areas at the time and was adjacent to the
           town of Springfield.  It was  quite  heavily  mined  and thickly
           populated.  Certainly, if any such aerial activities were taking
           place there, someone would have noticed."

       He then went into the fact that contemporary diaried  and newspapers
       contained no mention  of  such  activities.   But  then  he added in
       closing:

          "This does not necessarily mean  that  such activity did not take
           place; as  it could have been carried out in a highly  secretive
           manner."

       Since this letter  was written several tombstones have been found in
       the area bearing names SIMILAR to  the  names  by  Dellschau  in his
       books.  There is also NO trace of any Charles Arthur  Dellschau, but
       there are records  of  two  brothers,  John  Charles  and  Arthur D.
       Duchow.  The records of the Duchow  brothers are confusing and often
       contradictory.  They appear to have been men of mystery  themselves,
       to some degree.   In one instance their name was spelled differently
       and several times they used each other's given names arbitrarily.

       According to Dellschau's notations  the  group  wanted secrecy about
       themselves AND their activities.  They took great  pains  to  ensure
       it.  But all  of this was probably unnecessary.  Even with newspaper
       accounts and documentation, as an example, how many people know

                                      Page 3

       about President Lincoln's  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Aeronautics or his
       interest in Dr. Solomon Andrews'  "Aereon"?   For  that  matter, how
       many people have even HEARD of Dr. Solomon Andrews?

       Dr. Solomon Andrews was an M.D. and, for a time,  Mayor  and  Health
       Officer of Perth  Amboy  where  he  developed the town's first sewer
       system to help keep down cholera and yellow fever.  He also invented
       a sewing machine, a barrel-maker,  a  fumigator, a velocipede, a gas
       lamp, forging presses, a kitchen stove and a pipe that would "filter
       out harmful substances" from the tobacco.

       In 1849, Dr. Andrews purchased the old Army barracks at Perth Amboy,
       New Jersey and converted them into the "Inventor's Institute", where
       he was joined by many other inventors.

       In 1861, Thaddeus Lowe flew 900 miles in an observation balloon that
       he had built.  Lincoln made him chief of the newly  formed U.S. Army
       Corps of Aeronautics  and  he  presided  over a fleet of observation
       balloons that were used in many Civil  War  engagements,  mostly  as
       spies in the sky.  Since there was so little control on the balloons
       and the rebels  were  such  crack  shots,  many  were  lost  in  the
       fighting.

       A letter dated  August  9,  1862, reached President Lincoln from Dr.
       Andrews in which   he   suggested   "producing   an   aerostat   for
       reconnaissance, if nothing more, in aid of the armies of the Union".
       Lincoln thought the idea had merit and asked to be kept informed and
       to have eyewitness accounts of the progress and test  flights of Dr.
       Andrews' Aereon.  Although  reports were sent to the President, they
       never got beyond his secretary.

       On June 1, 1863, Dr. Andrews brought  his  ship  out  for its maiden
       flight.  It leaped into the air and flew INTO the wind  at 200 feet.
       It was then  brought down to a safe landing.  His motorless aircraft
       had worked, and was navigable.  A  month later, with refinements, it
       was again tested  with  equally  fine  results.  Another  trial,  on
       September 4, before  a  reporter  from  the  New York Herald, was so
       impressive, the newsman wrote, "With  such a machine in the hands of
       Jefferson Davis, the armies around Washington would  be powerless to
       defend the Capital".

       Dr. Andrews was  finally able to see President Lincoln and report to
       him personally.  A  Congressional   committe   was  set  up  by  the
       Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, to look into the invention  and make
       recommendations.  Hearings were  held  in  March  1864 and immediate
       appropriations were recommended.   But  apparently  no  one heard of
       these recommendations and  on  March  22, 1865, Andrews  received  a
       letter from the  House  Military  Affairs  Committee  that they were
       really not interested and, besides, the war was over.

       This ended Lincoln's flying warships  before  they  ever got off the
       ground.  (No pun  intended.)   If  an  episode  such  as  the  above
       involving so many  people  in  high places and so well publicized at
       the time can become unknown almost  overnight,  think  how  easy  it
       would be to  keep  unknown activities of a group who  strove  to  BE
       KNOWN.

       Apropos to the  above  story are several notations and comments made
       by Dellschau in his drawings.  For example :

                                      Page 4

           There are a series of drawings of "Jacke's Aero Hunter" which is
           an airship based on his brother Carl Schubert's original design,
           known as  the  "Aero  Hunter".   On  one  page is the note "a la
           Brother Andrews".  This may  be  an  error  because  the writing
           tapers to a point at the end and looks like a series of "e's" or
           undotted "i's".

           At any  rate,  the  ship  uses  3 gas bags "a la  Andrews"  (Dr.
           Andrews Aereon)  rather than the normal one on most of the other
           Aeros.  Also, Jacke Schubert designed  a  second craft, the Aero
           Hurray, also with 3 balloons or gas bags and  flat  tailfins  in
           the rear "a la Andrews", unlike most other Aeros.

       Another notation reads:

          "Again, where  material is used other than Peter's fuel, even the
           Army, using fire to ascend cannot  stay up long, because nothing
           travels like Peter's Goose".

       The above refers to Peter Mennis, who ALONE, knew  the  formula  for
       producing the gas used on the Aeros.

       Still another:

          "And who  are  you  to  question  our board?  Now what makes (it)
           practical (to fly a) military  airship (from) 10 or 100 miles an
           hour? ?  ?    Hell.  Those acting officers act  just  like  race
           track gamblers.   No  such questions asked as bullet-proof, good
           gas reservoir, fall-easy, anti-ballast!  What did you say?  Holy
           red tape.

          "Yes, when weather suits - gas  can  be  got  when reaching camp!
           What won't Peter Mennis say to you, simply "nonsense".  And what
           say I that long legged Prussian officer just more train.  We got
           too much already. Amen."

       And lastly a long message:

          "How would  our  members  laugh,  over  the  deeds   of   today's
           Aeronauts.  Nothing  new  under  the  heaven, says Brother Lewis
           Caro.  They build them, with and  without using gasses..but 300-
           400 feet long.  Nay, nay, never!

          "Yes, Dr. Saxe and Jourdan swearet for fool fun.   All  over  us,
           but who  of our members did not say, say No sir - Won't go!  Now
           Kaiser Wilhelm wants sleeping  rooms  attached  to his balloons!
           Say Jourdan,  can't you supply his majesty?  Now  next  dropping
           thing from above shall be unlawful in war and peace time.

          "No bomb  -  no  packages - no stinkeys.  Well, who cares for the
           laws - up in the clouds?

          "Forbidden fruit tastes very sweet.   For  instance,  the  spys a
           flying general  a  ammunition  train right under  him.   He  let
           something droppe,  to  hear  it  boom,  and  burn  it  did!  But
           exploding powders force Aero  his  flyer  and  he  droppet  down
           himself!  All play things yet - good for time goe by, and money,
           yes money always to pay for the funn, and money earning only for
           mackers and Booler too.  And now, my friends, Good Bye."

                                      Page 5                     CAAD

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       As can be  seen from the above, the members, for the most part, were
       against war and  did  not  want their  craft  to  be  used  for  war
       purposes.  And they  wanted nothing to do with violence  and/or  the
       military.

       One of Dellschau's drawings graphically shows this.  It is a collage
       divided down the  center.   One side consists of newsclippings about
       the subject of war and the uses of  aircraft for this purpose, along
       with a picture  of  two  men  talking.  Dellschau  also  includes  a
       drawing of a  black cat, a symbol he often used to designate evil or
       bad luck.  The other half of the collage  depicts  a man and a woman
       carrying suitcases and  golf clubs entering an Aero.   The  captions
       read: "From your  Point  of  View"  and "Our Point of View".  A very
       good reason for keeping their discoveries secret!

       There was also the element of fear;  that  their  machines  would be
       used by criminals, and several drawings contained a  "Press Bluhmen"
       with comments about  such  uses.   In  one  instance,  along  with a
       drawing of the Aero IGOE, is an  account  both  in  English,  and in
       German apparently for emphasis that reads:

          "There stands below a custom house to collect  lots  of  taxes  -
           Stand there,  not in my way.  Come right up here and doo collect
           for fetching diamonds overland.   If not, my dear appraiser - we
           going fast somewhere - we not telling you!

          "There flies  the  burglar's  windy  craft with lots  of  luckre,
           stolen.  What  does  he  care for policeman up here.  And let me
           tell you...Well you laugh.  Have  you  a  bank or a store below?
           If so, the time might come when you won't laugh.  Nor swear!"

       Are these some  of the reasons Dellschau took such  great  pains  to
       make it difficult  for  anyone to read his books and learn about the
       Sonora Aero Club and their Aeros?   Did  the Club really exist or is
       it all a figment of Dellschau's imagination?  For that  matter,  who
       is Dellschau?  He  did  not seem to even exist prior to 1886 when he
       came to Houston!
