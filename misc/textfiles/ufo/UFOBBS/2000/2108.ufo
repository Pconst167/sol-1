                       ABSTRACT

     This study evaluates factors related to the USAF
investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects in an
attempt to determine whether or not additional UFO
investigation is warranted. The approach to analysis
taken by this study was twofold: one writer eval-
uated evidence justifying the closure of Project Blue
Book while the other writer evaluated evidence sup-
porting its reopening. Based on the evidence un-
covered, the study concludes that there is a definite
need for a new UFO investigation. The study recom-
mends that such an investigation should be a sci-
entific undertaking free from bias, political pres-
sure, and USAF or DoD jurisdiction.

                       CHAPTER I

                     INTRODUCTION

          "We know now that in the early years of the
     twentieth century this world was being watched
     closely by intelligences greater than man's and
     yet as mortal as his own."(15:33)

                                   Orsen Welles, 1938

     With this sentence, Orsen Welles launched his now
famous "Martian Invasion" broadcast on Hallowe'en Eve,
October 30, 1938. Although Welles' panic broadcast was
designed as an elaborate hoax, Welles proved something
which remains as true today as it was thirty-five years
ago: few subjects are more intriguingly fascinating or
as controversial as the possibility of an earthly sur-
veillance by intelligent extraterrestrial beings.
    Many people mistakenly assume the Welles ' broadcast
was the basis for the reports of unidentified flying ob-
jects (UFOs) which have occurred with increasing fre-
quency in the United States since 1947, but there are
written records of UFO sightings as early as the reign
of King Thutmose III, circa 1504-1450 B.C., in Ancient
Egypt.(32:l4) If the Welles broadcast served any benefi-

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

cial purpose, it was perhaps that it developed a renewed
awareness of the possible existence of extraterrestrial
civilizations and caused people to look once again to
the heavens.
    There were several UFO sightings during World War II
by both American and Japanese pilots, but both assumed
the UFOs to be a secret weapon of the enemy. During this
period, American pilots reported luminous discs, quickly
dubbed "foo fighters", which sometimes followed alongside
their aircraft,(4:32) The first large scale UFO sightings
to occur in the United States since 1897 began in 1947.
Since 1947, the incidents of sightings have increased in
momentum which has remained undiminished to this day.
    By September 1947, the United States Air Force (USAF)
had become sufficiently interested in the growing number
of UFO reports by reputable, respected citizens to estab-
lish "Project Sign", later named "Project Grudge", and
finally renamed "Project Blue Book", the Air Force program
for investigation of UFOs. Project Blue Book remained
in effect for over twenty-two years and investigated re-
ports of 12,618 sightings. Unexplained sightings ranged
between the official Project Blue Book report of 6 per
cent to UFOlogist estimates of 54 per cent. Despite the
wide variance in unexplained sightings, Secretary of the

                          2
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Air Force, Dr. Robert Seamans, announced the termination
of Project Blue Book on December 17, 1969. The decision
to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an eval-
uation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado
entitled, "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Ob-
jects," more commonly referred to as the "Condon Report";
a review of the Condon Report by the National Academy of
Sciences; past UFO studies; and two decades of Air Force
experience investigating UFO reports. (6:141)
    Since 1969, and the demise of Project Blue Book, man
has penetrated the once impenetrable barrier of space
and has safely set foot on the lunar surface not once,
but several times. Space travel to other planets and to
distant stars, once thought to be "the impossible dream"
by many, is now believed to be a definite probability by
nearly all. Since 1969, there have also been an increased
number of UFO sightings around the world. The most recent
rash of sightings occurred in the Southeastern United States,
centering around the three state area encompassing Georgia,
Alabama, and Mississippi. A growing number of people,
including many former UFO skeptics, feel the tremendous
accomplishments of our astronauts, the surge and nature
of recent UFO reports, and new developments concerning
former UFO sightings, more than justify the reopening of

                          3

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Blue Book.

                         Objectives

    The purpose of this study is to determine whether
or not Project Blue Book should be reopened. To better
guarantee an unbiased study, one of the writers will
present arguments supporting the closure of Project Blue
Book. These arguments will embrace supportive evidence
such as the "Condon Report", the review of the "Condon
Report" conducted by the National Academy of Sciences,
and the findings of Project Blue Book. The other writer
will present arguments for reopening Project Blue Book.
These arguments will contain supportive evidence such
as a critical analysis of Project Blue Book and the
Condon Report, new developments regarding two former UFO
sightings, and two important new sightings which occurred
in 1973.
    The writers will not attempt to prove or disprove
extraterrestrial visitors are visiting the earth, but
will merely gather and analyze information which will
provide an argument to the Air Force that Project Blue
Book should or should not be reopened.

                        Limitations

    The writers were extremely fortunate insofar as the

                          4

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

original ProJect Blue Book documents, which are no longer
classified, are now located in the archives of the Air
University Library, Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, Alabama.
Limitations, however, did exist. First, research was
necessarily confined to sources within the Air University
Library, the Montgomery Alabama Public Library, and the
few books the writers were able to purchase. Second, UFOs
are not a particularly favorite topic of a majority of the
academia, therefore, few scientific journals mention the
topic, except in a derogatory manner. Third, literary
sources, other than those already mentioned, were nec-
essarily confined to the news media and popular period
icals. Fourth, personal professional correspondence was
confined to two scientists; Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director,
Department of Astronomy, Northwestern University and
Mr. Stanton J. Friedman, Nuclear Physicist. Fifth, due
to the fact that both of the writers are currently on
active duty with the Air Force and any personal contact
with UFO eyewitnesses might be construed as an official
USAF investigation, personal interviews were not feasible.

                     Hypothesis

    At the beginning of this study, neither of the
writers possessed any bias toward or against the possible
existence of UFOs, but since opposing views must be taken

                          5

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

to better guarantee an unbiased conclusion, there were
necessarily two hypotheses. For the purpose of this
study, one of the writers will approach all research
from the standpoint that Project Blue Book was a well
organized USAF program which conducted a thorough inves-
tigation of all reported UFO sightings as substantiated
by the scientifically conducted Condon Report. This
writer will maintain the attitude that all UFOs can be
explained as natural phenomena and contend that Project
Blue Book should remain closed. This hypothesis will
provide the negative portion of the joint study.
    Conversely, the other writer, for the purpose of
this study, will approach all research as though he
believes both Project Blue Book and the Condon Report
were biased, unscientific investigations unworthy of
the auspices of the United States Air Force. This writer
will contend this bias together with new developments
regarding two former UFO sightings and two specific 1973
sightings are more than sufficient reasons for reopening
Project Blue Book.   This hypothesis will provide the
affirmative portion of the joint study.

                       Overview

    The writers will begin this study with a brief dis-
cussion of the history of Air Force UFO investigations.

                          6

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following this summary, one of the writers will present
arguments, based on extensive research, to justify the
closure of Project Blue Book, while the other writer will
conversely discuss arguments he has uncovered which jus-
tify the reopening of Project Blue Book. The writers
will then once again join forces and attempt to objec-
tively analyze their findings to arrive at a conclusion
whether or not Project Blue Book should be reopened. If
warranted, the writers will conclude this study by pre-
senting their recommendations regarding future UFO
studies.
    For the purpose of this study, the terms "UFO" and
"flying saucers", will be used synonymously.

                        CHAPTER II

          HISTORY OF USAF INVESTIGATION OF UFOs

    Investigation of UFOs by the U. S. Government began
on September 23, 1947, when, following a rash or UFO
sightings, Lt. Gen. Nathan F. Twining, Chief of Staff of
the U. S. Army, recommended to Brig. Gen. George Schulgen,
Commanding General of the Army Air Force, that Head-
quarters Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a
priority, security classification and code name for a
detailed study of UFOs. In this letter, Lt. Gen. Twining
also noted that in his opinion, the phenomenon was real
and not visionary or fictitious. Since Air Material
Command (AMC) had originally been collecting UFO data,
Lt. Gen. Twining recommended that AMC continue the inves-
tigation within its present resources until the official
study could be organized.(3:1379)

                      Project Sign

    On December 30, 1947, a letter from the Chief@ of Staff
directed Air Material Command to set up a project to
collect, collate, evaluate and distribute information

                          8

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

concerning UFOs. The Air Technical Intelligence Division
of AMC issued HQ AMC Technical Instruction No. 2185 ,
February 11, 1948, inaugurating a classified project
under the code name of "Sign."(25:1) Project Sign con-
tinued its investigations of UFOs until February 11, 1949,
when its project name was officially changed to "Project
Grudge."(2:850) A report covering the 273 incidents
investigated by Project Sign concluded that no definite
and conclusive evidence existed.(25:1) This final report
recommended: (1) future activities of this project
should be carried on at a minimum level necessary to
record, summarize and evaluate the data received on
future reports and to complete the specialized investi-
gation in progress, (2) reporting agencies should get
more factual evidence on sightings, such as photographs,
physical evidence, radar sightings, and data on size and
shape.(2:850)

                     Project Grudge

    After December 16, 1948, the USAF study of UFOs con-
tinued as "Project Grudge."  Following this change, UFO
investigations continued much as they previously had
during Project Sign. In August 1949 a report containing
analysis of 244 cases was released which concluded that
Unidentified Flying Objects posed no direct threat to the

                          9

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

national security of the United States and that reports
resulted from: (1) misinterpretation of conventional
objects, (2) mass hysteria or "War Nerves", (3) hoaxes
and/or (4) psychopathological persons.(23:10)  The
Project Grudge report recommended that: (1) investi-
gation be reduced in scope. (2) current collection data
relating to UFOs be revised to provide for submission
of only those reports clearly indicating realistic tech-
nical applications, and (3) conclusions with sufficient
supporting data be declassified and made public. (23:6)
Based on this final report of Project Grudge, a decision
was made to discontinue the project. However, investi-
gation of UFOs was continued as part of normal intelli-
gence activities.(2:857)

                  Project Blue Book

    Following a new rash of sightings, Project Grudge
was reactivated as a new and expanded investigation on
October 27, 1951, under the direction of Captain E. J.
Ruppelt. In March 1952 the new Project Grudge was redes-
ignated "Project Blue Book." With this change of project
designation, there also followed increased support and
authority for UFO studies at the Air Technical Intelli-
gence Center (ATIC) located at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base near Dayton, Ohio. Project Blue Book was initially

                          10

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

governed by policies set forth in Air Force Letter 200-5
issued April 29, 1952. Air Force Letter 200-5 provided
for a more elaborate and comprehensive reporting system
whereby telegraphic reports concerning UFOs would be
sent directly to both the Project Blue Book staff and to
the Pentagon. These procedures were later replaced by
a less complicated reporting system stated in Air Force
Regulation 200-2 dated August 26, 1953. AFR 200-2
was superseded by Air Force Regulation 80-17 dated
September 19, 1966. The primary relevant change noted
in this regulation was in the area of information release.
It provided for news releases to come from the Secretary
of the Air Force, Office of Information (SAFOI). All Air
Force members not officially connected with UFO investi-
gation were to refrain from action or comments on UFO
reports which might mislead public opinion. Another
regulation covering UFO procedures was Joint Army Navy
Air Publication 146 (JANAP-146) which reminded Air
Force personnel of the severe penalties for making public
statements concerning UFOs without official approval.
(2:857)
    The USAF maintained that their interest in UFOs was
related directly to the air defense of The United States
and the security of its airspace. The objectives of

                          11

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Blue Book were to determine if UFOs posed a
direct threat to the security of the United States and
to determine if UFOs provided any unique scientific
information or advanced technology that would contribute
to United States technical research. In accomplishing
these objectives, the USAF strived to identify and
explain all UFO sightings. (27:1)
    During Project Blue Book's existence, the staff pub-
lished 12 regular summary reports and one special report,
Report Number 14. The conclusions of these reports are
summed up in a Project Blue Book Report dated 1968
which states:

        To date, the firm conclusions of Project
    Blue Book are: (1) no unidentified flying ob-
    ject reported, investigated, and evaluated by
    the Air Force has ever given any indication of
    threat to our national security; (2) there has
    been no evidence submitted to or discovered by
    the Air Force that sightings categorized as
    UNIDENTIFIED represent technological develop-
    ments or principles beyond the range of pre-
    sent-day scientific knowledge; and (3) there
    has been no evidence indicating that sightings
    categorized as UNIDENTIFIED are extraterres-
    trial vehicles.
        The Air Force will continue to investigate
    all sightings of unusual aerial phenomena over
    the US which are reported to it. The services
    of qualified scientists and technicians will
    continue to be used to investigate and analyze
    these reports, and periodic reports and news
    releases will be made on the subject as
    requested.
        The Air Force takes no stand on whether or
    not extraterrestrial life could or does exist.
    Many scientists believe that it is entirely

                          12

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     possible that the universe contains life on
     planets other than our own. No evidence yet
     exists that there is other life. The Air
     Force continues to extend an open invitation
     to anyone who feels that he possesses any
     evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles oper-
     ating within the earth's space envelope to
     submit his evidence for analysis. Initial
     contact for this purpose is through the fol-
     lowing address:

             PROJECT BLUE BOOK INFORMATION OFFICE
             SAFOI
             WASHINGTON, DC 20330 (27:4)

    Based upon the recommendations of the United States
Air Force Scientific Advisory Board Ad Hoc Committee
which met on February 3, 1966, a project for broad in-
depth study of Unidentified Flying Objects was-co-
ordinated with the University of Colorado (Colorado
Study). This study commenced on November 1, 1966, with
its final report being submitted on October 31, 1968.
(8:246)  Conclusions of this report will be discussed in
the following chapter.  Based upon findings of this study,
on December 17, 1969, the United States Air Force announced
the termination of Project Blue Book and the retirement
of its records to the USAF Archives, Maxwell AFB, Alabama;
thus concluding all official government investigations
of UFOs.

                         CHAPTER III

          ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING THE TERMINATION OF
                      PROJECT BLUE BOOK

    While many disagree with the U. S. Air Force deci-
sion to terminate Project Blue Book, there exists much
evidence to support the USAF action. Several UFO
sightings still remain puzzling and unsolved. However;
many facets of human life still remain unknown. Even
though man has used electricity for many years, scientists
still are unable to agree exactly what it is or upon
whether electricity flows from the positive pole to the
negative pole or vice versa. He is not even able to
understand the reason for his difference in behavior.
While man can communicate with his fellow man, he is still
unable to understand why he behaves toward his environ-
ment as he does. These are a few of the mysteries that
mankind accepts as normal and lives with the results.
The decision of the USAF to terminate UFO investigation
can be supported by looking at some of the natural acts
that might appear as UFOs and some natural phenomena
that might appear as UFOs. This decision can also be

                          14

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

supported by looking at man himself through some of his
behavioral aspects. It must also be noted that the USAF
decision to terminate UFO investigation was based on
several scientific studies and committee recommendations.

                       Natural Acts

    To even the trained observer, many natural acts can
appear weird and thus be later construed to be a UFO.
Man's natural senses are limited. They serve his needs
under normal circumstances, however, under many circum-
stances they are inadequate. Our senses can easily be
confused. Take, for example, our sense of balance which
is a joint function of sight and hearing. Man's balance
is superb under normal conditions of gravity and good
visibility. However, when man is placed in an aircraft
where "G" loads and visibility vary, he requires gyro
stabilized instruments to give him his orientation of up
or down and whether he is turning or diving.  Man's
sense of vision during night conditions is extremely
limited and at times inaccurate. Under conditions of
darkness and with only one point light source in view,
that light point will appear to move. This physical
limitation can be simulated in a dark room with one small
point of light available. This writer, while piloting
an F-102A Interceptor on a night training mission, exper-

                          15

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ienced a situation similar to the vision limitation
mentioned. Shortly after take off, the writer saw what
appeared to be the tail light of the lead aircraft he
was to join with. As the writer's aircraft appeared to
close on the light source, power was reduced to slow
overtake. Shortly after this act, the writer noted the
lead aircraft about 20 degrees to his right. The writer
had been attempting to join with a star or planet in the
sky. This limitation coupled with man's basic limited
ability to see under conditions of darkness has contri-
buted to many UFO reports.
    The afterburning of a jet aircraft when viewed at
night could easily explain many UFO sightings. On most
nights only the afterburner of the jet will be visible
and when viewed from the side would appear as a short
bluish flame. As the aircraft is maneuvered, the flame
can elongate, shorten or assume different shapes as the
afterburner flame is viewed at different angles from
the tail of the aircraft. When the afterburner is viewed
looking directly from the tail toward the nose of the
aircraft, the flame will appear as a whitish orange ball.
If the aircraft is climbing or diving steeply, the after-
burner would tend to appear as a white ball with erratic
maneuvers. The sphere would appear to be stationary when

                          16

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the aircraft is level and to climb or dive rapidly as
the aircraft was maneuvered up or down. The color of
the afterburner will change colors when the afterburner
is viewed at different angles. The afterburner flame
will disappear when afterburner operation is terminated
or when the aircraft is turned to a head-on view. Thus,
the jet afterburner can and will, when viewed at night,
appear as an object similar to that of many night UFO
sightings; an object with an erratic pattern, one that
changes colors and shapes in a random fashion and vanishes
without a trace.
    Night aerial refueling is another source of maneuver-
ing lights that can appear as UFOs. The number of air-
craft in an aerial refueling operation can vary from one
aircraft receiving fuel from one tanker to several air-
craft and several tankers. The tanker when viewed from
the bottom normally has two rows of lights along the
bottom of the fuselage. Many receiver aircrafts have a
refueling light which shines forward similar to the
headlights of a car. It is readily apparent that either
tow aircraft or several aircraft involved in aerial re-
fueling will be seen as an extremely weird group of aerial
lights to an unaware ground observer. This view coupled
with the "Race Track" pattern used by the aircraft give

                          17

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

an erratic pattern of lights that travel in one direc-
tion for several minutes then turn and fly a return
course. Many UFO sightings have noted lights that have
behaved similar to those of the aerial refueling oper-
ation.
    Air Force aircraft use two very common devices that
can give extremely uncommon appearing lights. These
are the night flare and the night photo flash. Flares
are normally dropped from aircraft or shot into the air
by a ground mortar. These flares are extremely bright
and descend slowly by the use of a small parachute. They
take several minutes to burn out and normally burn out
prior to reaching the ground. Night aerial photography
is normally accomplished by high intensity flash strobes
or flash cartridges. These flashes are very high inten-
sity and normally several are used at a time. Again,
the flare and flash strobe are normal light sources that
can and have caused concern to ground observers.
    Bright planets, stars and the moon have been falsely
reported as UFOs. When near the horizon, stars and
planets may flash bright colors, mainly red and green.
This is due to atmospheric conditions. They may appear
to jump sideways or up and down, and is due to invol-
untary eye motions. Venus, in particular, is often

                          18

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

reported because of its extraordinarily brilliant white
light. It is bright enough to shine through thin cloud
layers which often appear as a fuzzy ball and as the
clouds drift it appears to have erratic motion. Many
people do not realize that planets and stars rise and
set, thus giving them motion across a portion of the sky.
Binoculars make apparent movements greater, therefore
minor movement will be amplified.(34:2324)
    The following undated abstract from Newsweek was
found in the Project Blue Book files:

         A strange looking long bright object settled
    close to the earth, hovered there a few minutes,
    then disappeared. Several Akron, Ohio residents
    spotted it. They fired off reports to the Air
    Force. Its Unidentified Flying Objects task
    force went into action and investigated.
         Just what was that strange bright object
    which hovered close to the earth out in Akron
    one night last year? The answer, disclosed by
    the Air Force last week: The moon. The UFO
    Force, reported on one of the 483 investigations
    it conducted last year explained that the moon
    often seems to assume an ecliptical shape when
    it nears the horizon.

    Balloons and helicopters have flight characteristics
similar to those reported by UFO sightings. Weather
balloons account for a number of UFO sightings. These
balloons are sent to altitudes of 40,000 feet and higher
and are launched from virtually every air field in the
United States. They are made of Polyethylene and rubber
and increase in size as they gain altitude. They have

                          19

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

good radar reflective areas and are frequently lighted
at night. Undermost daylight conditions and from a
distance, the balloon will appear as a silver sphere.
This writer can recall being scrambled from Richards-
Gebaur AFB, Mo., in an F-102A to attempt an identi-
cation of a UFO. The writer and a fellow pilot in another
aircraft identified the UFO as a weather balloon. Heli-
copters when viewed from a distance can appear as a
UFO. Their motion is slow and at a distance appear to
be black specks that moves up and down. At night, this
motion coupled with the helicopters rotating beacon can
give some spectacular effects.
    Many strange effects are created by routine jet
training flights. This writer can remember being a
member of a 4 ship F-100 night flight where one member's
high intensity landing light would not turn off after
take off. The flight continued on an approximate two
and one half hour flight round robin throughout the south-
eastern United States with the high intensity light on
and pointing straight down. There is little doubt that
this could have been mistaken for a UFO.
    Frequently, unusually bright meteors will cause a
flurry of UFO reports as they streak across the sky.
Several satellites can be seen in the sky today. Sat

                          20

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ellites can be visible for several minutes and easily
misidentified as UFOs.

                 Natural Phenomenon

    Many UFO sightings can be explained by natural
phenomenon. Two major areas of phenomenon are worthy
of note: (1) electrical phenomenon and gaseous phe-
nomenon and, (2) weather phenomenon. Natural phenom-
enon as we know it today can explain many UFO sightings.
However, there is little doubt that in the future many
more phenomenons will be noted and at least accepted
as known but unexplainable natural conditions.
    After years of controversy over UFOs, evidence is
growing that many UFOs may be very real and natural
electronic phenomenon. Many sightings seem to occur
near electronic power transmission lines or points.(5:75)
UFO sightings around these heavy electrical fields give
rise to the possibility that some phenomenon unknown to-
day could cause the energy of this highly electrified
area to give off visible glowing electrical energy. One
form of ball lightning has been produced in an experiment
conducted at Melpar Division of E-Systems, Inc., in
Falls Church, Va.  In one of their experiments, ammonia
vapor was ignited with a high voltage spark. The result
was a mass of flowing gas that quickly assumed the shape

                          21

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

associated with UFOs. The laboratory-model, while much
smaller than a UFO, proceeded to do many of the maneuvers
associated with UFOs. It hovered in one spot for several
minutes, moved quite erratically, sometimes moved at great
speeds and then abruptly broke up or faded away. Occa-
sionally the experiments produced several similar objects
that looked alike and flew in formation. The scientists
also discovered that their artificial UFO could be tracked
by radar and produced a charged field that could affect
radio performance.(5:75)  Another electrical phenomenon
well known to the aviator is the erie and mysterious
"Saint Elmo's Fire". "Saint Elmo's Fire"is a mysterious
visual glowing static electricity that forms at times on
the leading surfaces of an aircraft while flying at night.
This electrical phenomenon will dance around on the wind
screen, play on leading edges, and give the aircraft a
ghost like glow. These are only a couple of the known
electrical phenomenon. No doubt there are many we do not
know about.
    Weather phenomenon can produce many of the charac-
teristics associated with UFOs. Temperature inversion
reflections have produced radar returns. Speeds of these
returns have been reported to range from zero to fantastic
rates with the object moving in all directions. These

                          22

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

radar returns have resulted in many fruitless intercept
efforts. Ionized clouds can cause unidentified radar
returns. Radio transmission difficulties are also
associated with ionized clouds. Strong uplifting of
clouds can cause "lenticular" clouds. The saucer shaped
clouds appear over mountain ranges and from a distance
could easily be viewed as a UFO. These are but a few
of the known weather phenomenon. Little doubt exists
as to the possibility that many more weather associated
phenomenons manifest themselves today.

                     Human Behavior

    While many UFO sightings can be explained by natural
acts and natural phenomenon, possibly even more sightings
can be explained by investigating man himself. Much that
is written shows strong support for placing UFO sightings
into two basic psychological patterns: (1) A pattern
whereby the American public is influenced by the press
or other mass media, and (2) a pattern whereby UFOs fill
a certain psychological need either for the person report-
ing the UFO or persons that accept their presence.
    There is no question that the press and other mass
media have stimulated the public imagination concerning
UFOs. The term "Flying Saucer" was invented by the press
in 1947.(21:258) In the opinion of this writer many more

                          23

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

books and news stories are written with the thought of
"sensationalism" in mind rather than the facts. In many
cases it appears that the facts are stretched a bit and
the facts not supporting the stories are omitted. Walter
Sullivan supports this idea in, "UFOs a Scientific
Debate," by saying:

        Reporters earn their bread and butter with
    good stories and don't get full credit if they
    "qualify to death" such a yarn. They are
    trained to check the source of an interesting
    report, then write it up "colorfully". But
    they don't do a full research job on it, and
    they hope that no one "shoots it down" before
    the readers can appreciate it.(21:258)

    A synopsis of Headquarters Air Material Report , dated
August 31, 1949, states;

        A peak period in reports has occurred fol-
    lowing widespread publicity given to several
    incidents. This was further illustrated in
    May of 1949 (a Period not covered by this
    analysis) when Project Grudge received 64
    reports of sightings and 51 suggested solutions
    following a Saturday Evening Post article and
    an official USAF press release on "Flying
    Saucers". This amounted to approximately five
    times the number of reports received in pre-
    ceding months. Almost all of the reports and
    suggested solutions made reference to either
    The Saturday@ Evening Post article or the USAF
    official press release.(23:2)

The Blue Book files are filled with data that indicates
the affect of news media upon UFO sighting reports. A
statement made by an unknown Blue Book staff member
indicated that if publicity continued for several days,

                          24

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sighting reports go up throughout the country as well as
in the original locality.(33:6)
    There is little doubt in this writers mind that the
recent rash of sightings which occurred in the south-
eastern portion of the United States can be attributed
in part to the spectacular sighting in Pascagoula, Miss-
issippi where two men claimed to have been taken aboard
an alien spacecraft.
    Mankind has become more aware of the heavens in
recent years by the mass media surrounding him. Probably
the first and most shocking impression concerning the
heavens was made in 1938 when Orsen Welles made his famous
earth invasion broadcast. Since that time the American
public has become increasingly aware of the heavens and
of the possibility of alien life from outer space capable
of visiting earth. Many movies have been made which
have as their theme "visitors" from outerspace. Tele-
vision has further increased awareness of the heavens
with weekly space presentations. These movie and tele-
vision presentations are in many cases romantically
based and appeal to many. Most books available to the
general public deal with supporting the existence of
UFOs and in many cases are not based on scientific fact.
    Even a strong advocate of UFOs must admit that the

                          25

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

press and news media have made the public more aware of
the heavens. Mass media has supported the possibility
of UFOs and spacecraft. This increased possibility of
extraterrestrial visitors has, in the opinion of this
writer, definitely increased the chance that the average
person seeing any strange happening in the sky would
be more apt to report that happening as a UFO.
    One persuasive theory about UFOs is that they corre-
spond to a deep human need. Contemporary UFO sightings
are an outgrowth of the troubled international situation
and gradual erosion among Christians of belief in a God
who will eventually intervene to save mankind and correct
all wrongs. Boston psychiatrist Benjamin Simon believes
that UFOs have a little something for everyone. The
UFOs which represent an advanced civilization will obvi-
ously have new cures for the ill. For many, belief in
the saucers provided an "oceanic" or "cosmic feeling of
immersion" in the total universe. These conclusions
are partly based on Simon's work with Barney and Betty
Hill, a Portsmouth, N.H. , couple who claim to have been
abducted by UFO personnel, examined and later released
unharmed. Simon theorizes that Barney (a Negro) and
Betty (a Caucasian), both filled with tensions con-
cerning their mixed marriage, sighted a glowing in the

                          26

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sky. This served as a "day stimulus" for subsequent
nightmares and wish-fulfillment fantasies. The childless
Betty described an obviously Freudian encounter where a
humanoid administered a pregnancy test to her. Barney,
who considered the Irish to be hostile toward Negroes,
remembered being treated with respect by an Irish looking
humanoid. (4:32)
    Dr. William Kauffman, Director of the Griffith
Observatory at Los Angeles, recently explained his ideas
concerning UFO related human behavior in an article
stating that many of the people today wish to turn away
from happenings in the world and perhaps have a desire
that superintellects could come along and stop all of
the bungling that is happening today.(20:21)
    Many religious and philosophic groups have needs
that are filled by the possibility of UFOs. Dr. Ernest
R. Hilgard, a Stanford University psychologist, theorizes
that as society becomes more affluent, man tends to want
to become a more important member of the universe. Belief
in things of other worlds fill this need.(36:435)
    Dr. Donald L. Warren of the School of Social Work at
the University of Michigan has another behavior theory
of UFOs. He views UFOs as an opportunity for us to
escape without threatening our own immediate social

                          27

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

environment.  he further feels that a person dissatisfied
with his own socioeconomic status might be a likely person
to attach importance to himself by believing in and sight-
ing flying saucers.(36:436)
    The desire to believe in the existence of UFOs has
made millions of Americans susceptible to UFO hoaxes.
Many of these hoaxes have been in the form of photographic
manipulation such as double exposures taken of sauce pans,
ceiling lights or other saucer shaped items. Possibly
one of the most hilarious was a photograph of a weird
little creature that had supposedly come from a UFO and
died. The creature was later identified as a shaved
monkey.

           Studies and Recommendations to Support
               Termination of Project Blue Book

    Project Blue Book was terminated on December 17, 1969,
by Secretary of the Air Force, Robert C. Seamans, Jr.
The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based
on a report prepared by the University of Colorado
(Condon Report), a review of that report by the National
Academy of Sciences, past UFO studies, and Air Force
experience in investigating UFO reports.(21:297) Sec-
retary Robert Seamans Jr., stated that the program "no
longer can be justified either on the ground of national

                          28

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

security or in the interest of science.(15:76)  Many
experts disagree with the conclusion of the 1500 page,
$539,000 independent Condon Study that took over two
years to complete. The Condon Study concluded that :

        Nothing has come from the study of UFOs in
    the past 21 years that has added to scientific
    knowledge. Careful consideration of the record
    as it is available to us leads us to conclude
    that further extensive study of UFOs probably
    cannot be justified in the expectation that sci-
    ence will be advanced thereby.(1:2)

    One of the major critics of the Condon Study was
an amateur UFO organization, The National Investigators
Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). As indicated
by the Condon Report , NICAP in the past has spent much
effort in attacking Air Force UFO policies and attempting
to influence Congress. NICAP warned members of the
Colorado Project to beware less the Condon Project turn
out to have been "hired to whitewash the Air Force."
The Condon Report charges that NICAP made several efforts
to influence the course of their study. When it became
clear that NICAP could not influence the Condon Study,
NICAP termed the Condon Study "biased" and without
merit.(1:19)
    The National Academy of Sciences supported the Condon
Report and agreed with its conclusions. They concluded
that the scope of the Condon Report was adequate, the

                          29

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

methodology was correct, and its conclusions justified.
The National Academy of Sciences also concurred with the
Condon recommendation that Project Blue Book be terminated.
They also concluded that "The study of UFOs in general
is not a promising way to expand scientific understanding
of the phenomena."(21:299)
    While many criticize the conclusions and recommendations
of the Condon Study, no one can deny that it is the most
thorough and complete review or Project Blue Book ever
undertaken.

                    CHAPTER IV

      ARGUMENTS FOR REOPENING PROJECT BLUE BOOK

    Occasionally, a project such as Project Blue Book
is undertaken which ultimately proves to be successful
beyond the highest aspirations of its researchers. On
rare occasions, this occurs because of a fortunate acc-
ident, but it is more often the result of the amalgam-
ation of several prerequisites which have been faith-
fully and stringently adhered to. First, the project
must be assigned a priority comparable to its importance
and the potential value of its findings. Second, careful
consideration must be given to select a leader to head
the project who possesses the necessary qualifications,
expertise, and stature to assure a thorough, well-struc-
tured study incorporating the necessary scientific meth-
odology. Third, each member of the research staff should
be judiciously chosen and should possess a background
and expertise in his particular field comparable to that
of the project leader. Fourth, an atmosphere completely
void of bias and unsolicited outside influence must be
maintained at all times to better assure valid results.

                          31

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judging from its significant nature, one would think
Project Blue Book would have been such a study. Un-
fortunately, the research conducted by this writer
indicated this was far from the truth.
    This writer has briefly described some of the
necessary elements of a well-conducted scientific
research study and will now analyze the shortcomings
of the research methodology employed by Project Blue
Book.

          Priority of Project and Selection of
                     Project Chiefs

    The Class 2A priority originally assigned to Project
Blue Book at its inception in 1947 seemed to indicate
the Air Force placed a high value on the project, but
the fact that junior officers possessing little, if any,
scientific background and no graduate or research exper-
ience were repeatedly chosen to head the project presented
a dichotomy of action on the part of the Air Force.(14:268)
Lack of experience and scienti@ic training, however, can
often be overcome by time and true dedication, but time
was a rare commodity to Project Blue Book's officers.
The first decade of Project Blue Book's existence wit-
nessed six project chiefs, each averaging less than two
years at the helm - far too little time to develop a

                          32

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

firm foothold much less an expertise, regardless of the
depth of their dedication.

            Project Chiefs' Lack of Dedication

    Unfortunately, dedication appeared to be a commodity
as rare as time where most of Project Blue Book's pro-
ject chiefs were concerned. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, currently
Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern
University and formerly the Air Force's chief scientific
consultant for Project Blue Book has stated that some
of the project's directors constantly thought only of
promotion or retirement and felt it wise not to "rock
the boat" where such a controversial subject as UFOs was
concerned.(l4:l86) Not all of Project Blue Book's
chiefs possessed this apparent lack of dedication, how
ever. At least one of the project's early chiefs
expressed true puzzlement over some of the sightings
and the Air Force's Chameleon-like change of attitude
concerning the entire subject of UFOs. The late Cap-
tain Edward J. Ruppelt, head of Project Blue Book from
September 1951 through September 1953 admitted that he
was bothered by the fact that the Air Force's dominant
position of "reality" (discussed earlier on page 8) at
the beginning of Project Sign, in 1947, had turned to a
position of "disbelief" at the inception of Project

                          33

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grudge in 1949. This was particularly puzzling to
Captain Ruppelt, since UFO reports seemed to be getting
much better and less skeptical at that time.(29:85)
The Air Force appeared to want answers, not mysteries,
so the staff of ProJect Sign tried a new hypothesis:
UFOs don't exist.

        In no time they found that this was easier
    to prove and it got recognition. Previously,
    if an especially interesting UFO report came
    in and the Pentagon wanted an answer, all they'd
    get was an "it could be real but we can't prove
    it" Now such a request got a quick, snappy
    "It was a balloon," and feathers were stuck in
    caps from ATIC up to the Pentagon. Everybody
    felt fine.(29:85)

                   Insufficient Staff

    Perhaps one of the most serious deficiencies con-
cerning Project Blue Book was the size, competency,
and facilities of its staff. It is widely assumed that
Project Blue Book enjoyed a large staff with proper
facilities to accomplish a credible research. Unfor-
tunately, this was not true. Former Project Blue Book
Director, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, once remarked at
an Air Defense Command (ADC) briefing that tech orders
called for Project Blue Book's staff to consist of four
officers, two airmen, and two stenos. Captain Ruppelt
carefully avoided mentioning the actual staff size by
crossing the following line from his prepared text:

                          34

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"But like any other organization the actual strength
fluctuates."(24;file) The sad truth is that the actual
staff of Project Blue Book was generally headed by a
junior officer who was usually assisted by a Lieutenant
and sometimes only by a sergeant. For one period of
time a sergeant with little technical training was given
the duty of evaluating most of the incoming reports.
This small staff was not only expected to investigate
the nearly fifty UFO reports received monthly, but had
to devote much of its time to answering correspondence
and filing.(14:182) Even taking into consideration the
fact that some of the UFO sightings were immediately
explainable, the large number of credible reports, if
analyzed scientifically, would often have demanded many
days and even weeks of research. In all fairness to
the staff of Project Blue Book, their workload was awe-
some and much too great for so few to handle properly.
The mere fact that the project was usually headed by a
junior officer gave little leverage for its leader to
initiate the tape of investigation often requested by
its scientific consultant.(14:182)
    Project Blue Book's rare on-scene investigations
were often conducted a week after the actual sighting
due to the fact that an aircraft was not readily avail-

                          35

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

able to the project chief. Funds were scarce and Project
Blue Book's Director, sometimes a pilot, often had to resort
to "hopping" a flight at the Air Force's convenience or
taking a commercial flight if funds could be appropriated.
    It should also be stated in fairness to the Blue
Book staff that reports received from UFO officers
(officers assigned the additional duty of forwarding
reports of local UFO sightings to Project Blue Book) at
various air bases throughout the world often lacked even
the most elementary information necessary to conduct a
satisfactory investigation. Follow-up calls to these UFO
officers put an additional workload on the already over
burdened staff of Project Blue Book.(14:181)

                 Non-Scientific Approach

    The official attitude toward UFOs in 1949, for
reasons unknown even to Captain Ruppelt, had become
"they didn't exist, they couldn't exist."(29:83) There
seemed little chance for Project Grudge, struck by bias
after only two years, to survive at all. Captain
Ruppelt admitted after leaving the Air Force that good
UFO reports continued to come in at the rate of approx-
imately ten per month during his tenure as Project Blue
Book's chief. Unfortunately, according to Ruppelt,
these reports weren't being verified or investigated.

                          36

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In fact, most of them were discarded.(29:92)

                    Outside Influence

    Beginning in 1949, the news media constantly ran
negative articles pertaining to the existence of UFOs.
This was not surprising since Captain Ruppelt admitted
that the negative approach was typical when issuing
information to the news media. The project chief was
continually being told by higher headquarters to "tell
them the media? about the sightings we've solved - don't
mention the unknowns."(29:89)
    This apparent official change of attitude regarding
Project Blue Book raises a pertinent question: did this
change of attitude widen the dichotomy between the issu-
ance of project priority and staff assignments, or did
a dichotomy exist in the first place? Some of those
involved in Project Blue Book began to feel that the Air
Force disbelieved in UFOs from the beginning and only
created Project Sign to pacify the American public.
Whether or not there is any validity to this accusation
is not known. One thing that is known, however, is
Captain Ruppelt's admission that "the (UFO) problem was
being tackled with organized confusion (by the Air Force)
and everything was being evaluated, on the premise that
UFOs did not exist."(29:81,83)

                          37

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whatever the Air Force's approach was regarding
Project Blue Book in 1947, it was apparent by 1953 that
the investigative nature or the project was not taking
the direction desired by the American Government. This
attitude was made even more obvious when the now famous
(or infamous) Robertson panel, chaired by physicist
Dr. H. P. Robertson of Cal Tech, convened in January
1953 under the auspices of the CIA to investigate the
subject of UFOs. The four day meeting resulted in
the following conclusions and recommendations by the
Robertson panel :

    1) That the evidence presented on Unidentified
    Flying Objects shows no indication that these
    phenomena constitute a direct physical threat to
    national security.
    2) That there is no evidence that the phenomena
    indicates a need for the revision of current
    scientific concepts.
    3) That the continued emphasis on the reporting
    of these phenomena does...result in a threat to
    the orderly functioning of the protective organs
    of the body politic.
    4) That the national security agencies take
    immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying
    Objects of the special status they have been
    given and the aura of mystery they have acquired.
    5) That the national security agencies institute
    policies...designed to prepare...the country to
    recognize most promptly and to react most effec-
    tively to true indications of hostile intent or
    action.
                                     Robertson 1953

In short, the majority of the Robertson panel felt that
less, rather than more, attention should be paid to

                          38

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UFOs.(30:102)
    Project Blue Book managed to struggle along for
another fifteen years despite the conclusions of the
Robertson panel, but Project Blue Book's staff was not
as fortunate. Al Chop, the Pentagon's civilian Public
Information Office expert on UFOs resigned his position
less than two months after the Robertson panel adjourned.
Captain Ruppelt quit the Air Force in September 1953
less than eight months after the Robertson panel re-
leased its conclusions, and Major Robert Fournet,
Ruppelt's associate in Project Blue Book quit the Air
Force at the end of his tour.(30:106) Although many
felt the effect of the Robertson panel was the cause
for there mass resignations, it should be noted t@at
this was mere speculation. No official reason was
ever released.
    The Robertson Panel played an important role in the
history of Project Blue Book, but no record of the panel
is included in the original ProJect Blue Book files. As
far as this writer could determine, the supposedly com-
plete Blue Book files do not even mention the Robertson
panel. The writer, however, was successful in uncov-
ering a speech made by Captain Ruppelt to members of
ADC at Ent AFB, Colorado a week following the meeting

                          39

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the Robertson panel on January 24, 1953, which perhaps
contains a clue to the reason for the resignation of Pro-
ject Blue Book's staff. It should be restated at this
point that negative news releases were being issued to
the news media in 1953, the Air Force privately maintained
an attitude that regarded UFOs, as "non-existent" and it
was the Air Force's desire to downplay UFO sightings
categorized as "unknown". The Air Force had consistently
maintained that most UFO sightings had been identified
and most of the "unknowns" could be explained if better
information were available. With this atmosphere pre-
velant, Captain Ruppelt flew to Colorado Springs and
committed the unpardonable sin of disagreeing with official
Air Force policy and statistics before a group of fellow
Air Force officers. The discrepancy might have been
intentional, but it was likely that Ruppelt felt he could
speak more candidly before his peers. Regardless of the
reason, some of Ruppelt's statements presented a stark
contrast and departure from the attitude the Air Force
wished to project - at least to the civilian populace.
At one point in his speech, Ruppelt discussed the fairly
common occurrence of simultaneous radar-visual sightings
by saying:

        ...reports of simuLtaneous visual reports
    that supposedly correlate with unusual, high

                          40

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    speed or erratic radar tracks, with the rare
    exception or meteors and lightening, are a
    different story. No presently known phenomena
    or condition will give this situation. If it
    can be shown that the object sighted visually
    and the radar tracks are the same, the report
    warrants a detailed investigation.(24:file)

If Ruppelt "took the cake out of the oven" with that re-
mark, he certainly added the icing by later admitting:

        I might state now that the project will be con-
    tinued and the subject will continue to be treated
    seriously. There are several reasons why the pro-
    ject will be continued. _There are reports we can
    not explain._ (Underlining Ruppelt's) We be-
    lieve we can explain all but about 20% but if
    you noted the breakdown of conclusions, _we can
    only positively identify about 7%._ (underlin-
    ing is Ruppelt's) (24:file)

            Poor Structure and Methodology of
                     Project Blue Book

    When Project Blue Book was closed in 1969, the
official Air Force estimates of "unsolved" cases ranged
from less than 1 per cent to 2.09 per cent.(14:259)
Ruppelt's 1953 statement placed the number of UFO sight-
ings that could not be positively identified at 93 per
cent.  Either the Air Force figures released to the public
were conveniently exaggerated in Project Blue Book's
favor or the Air Force had devised a more accurate
method of determining the validity of UFO reports
between 1953 and 1969, A more probable explanation
for this apparent discrepancy in calculations is offered

                          41

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Project Blue Book's official
scientific consultant:

        In the evaluation of cases it has been the
    custom to employ the terms "possible" or
    "improbable" as modifiers to a given eval-
    uation; thus "possible aircraft" or "prob-
    able meteor" are often used. However, in
    the year-end compilations of cases these
    modifiers are conveniently dropped. Thus
    "possible aircraft" becomes simply "aircraft"
    and the public will be led to believe that
    there was no possible question....Not only had
    the "probable" and "possible" labels been
    deleted from the statistics, but sightings
    previously considered only possibly explained
    were now "definitely established" - not because
    of further investigations, but because of book-
    keeping procedures.(14:256)

    Dr. Hynek insisted that Project Blue Book's meth-
odology was completely unscientific since no scientist
would test only for a preconceived hypothesis and rule
out the possibility of another hypothesis. Yet this
was common practice with Project Blue Book. The Project
Blue Book staff would consistently dismiss case after
case because the local air base had reported that no
aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of the UFO
sighting. Dr. Hynek suggested that a scientific approach
would have been to "manifest scientific curiosity about
the matters in hand" and to "attempt to find patterns in
data rather than handling each datum as though it existed
in a vacuum".(14:266) The Project Blue Book staff should
have been researching for a solution that was consistent

                          42

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the basic data of the report and not with the work-
ing hypothesis."(14:267)

                Poor Cataloguing Procedures

    The entire results of the twenty-two year study of
Project Blue Book fill twenty-four standard filing-type
drawers in the Albert E. Simpson Historical Research
Center at Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, Alabama. An addi-
tional drawer contains artifacts, motion pictures of
Purported UFOs, and tape recordings of eyewitness
reports on UFO sightings. The best thing that can be
said for the files is that they are listed in chrono-
logical order and are readily available to anyone who
knows exactly what he or she is looking for. Researchers
must know the exact date and place of the UFO sighting
in order to obtain material from the files. It should
be noted at this point that this atrocious method of
cataloguing is not the fault of the Albert E. Simpson
Historical Research Center personnel. The staff of
Project Blue Book apparently lacked the foresight or
inclination to computerize the data contained in the
reports and made no attempt to do so even when a pro-
cedure was suggested by Drs. J. Allen Hynek and Jacques
Vallee.(l4:183)
    Except for two l6mm NBC and CBS television films,

                          43

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the movies contained in the artifacts drawer represent
a travesty of film splicing. The film splices are often
made with scotch tape or masking tape causing the film
to tear to shreds when the tape hits the projector
sprockets. This amateurish and crude attempt at film
splicing was performed prior to the films' shipment to
Maxwell AFB by Project Blue Book personnel. One can
only hope that this was not a reflection of the attitude
and approach the staff of Project Blue Book took towards
the entire study.
    In October of 1958, the Air Force's game of "musical
chairs", which it had consistently played for over a decade
with no fewer than six project chiefs appeared to have
reached an end. Major Robert J. Friend was appointed to
head Project Blue Book and remained at the helm for almost
five years, although the Air Force continued to juggle per-
sonnel in and out of the UFO Project Spokesman position
at the Pentagon. Consequently, Major Friend worked with
three different project spokesmen during his assignment as
Project Chief. Dr. Hynek speaks well of MaJor Friend's
approach to Project Blue Book, which was considerably more
objective than that of his predecessors'. Major Friend was
promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel during his
tenure as Director of Project Blue Book. During his

                           44

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

five year's in the job, Lt. Col. Friend and Dr. Hynek
organized a panel of scientists which met to assist in
evaluating various UFO sightings, but this effort lacked
backing from the Air Force and was short-lived.(14:198)
At this point, Lt. Col. Friend's appointment as Project
Blue Book's director was terminated. The Air Force
decided to once again attempt to achieve the proper mix
of Project Director and UFO spokesman which would be
"politically" acceptable. This final mix, after sixteen
years of almost constant personnel shuffling, was
apparently successful from the Air Force's point of
view. The new appointees each held their respective
positions for over six years until the close of Project
Blue Book. The new Project Director rose from the rank
of Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in the process. Since
these positions had been precarious, at best, one might
assume that these two men either performed their duties
in an excellent manner or projected the attitude toward
UFOs deemed proper by the Pentagon.
    The research performed by this writer indicates the
latter assumption is probably correct. Methodology
at this time was no better than before. One needs only
to look in the Project Blue Book files between August
1963 and December 1969 to realize the new ProJect Blue

                          45

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book methodology was poor. A considerably greater
number of sightings were labeled "identified" during
this period since the words "possible" and "probable"
were consistently dropped from most UFO reports - a
method familiar to, but more sparingly used by, pre-
vious Project Blue Book management. During the final
years of Project Blue Book, it was not unusual to
see three or four explanations for the same UFO sighting
with no reason given for determining the final selection
Since the final Project Blue Book Director's successful
tenure and promotion was apparently not due to his
excellence as a scientifically disciplined researcher,
one can only assume that he was projecting the attitude
and approach towards UFO investigations desired by the
Air Force.
    This writer felt that no clearer description or
example of what the Air Force condoned as proper meth-
odology could be offered than to present an actual case
from the Project Blue Book files. Any number of sight-
ings could be reconstructed at this point, but this
writer chose to retrace the UFO sighting near Lincoln,
New Hampshire on September 20, 1961 reported by Mr. and
Mrs. Barney Hill. The Hill sighting plays an important
role in the conclusion of this chapter.

                          46

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

            The Betty and Barney Hill Sighting

    While traveling near Lincoln, New Hampshire on mid-
night the evening of September 19, 1961, Barney and
Betty Hill spotted a bright object in the sky. Mrs. Hill
noticed that the object appeared to grow brighter and
larger and appeared to be moving, but actual motion was
difficult to verify due to the movement of their auto-
mobile. Barney Hill stopped the car so they could get
a better look at the object, and it was determined that
the "star, or the light, or whatever it was, was defi-
nitely moving."(10:45) The Hills resumed their trip
but continued to view the strange object which now ap-
peared much closer. Its flight seemed erratic and the
speed seemed to fluctuate. Red, amber, green, and blue
lights were now visible on the object which had crossed
the face of the moon and appeared to be playing games
with them. The couple lost sight of the object tem-
porarily until it suddenly appeared approximately 300
feet to the right of their car.(10:46) At this point
Barney stopped the car, grabbed his binoculars, and
walked toward the object, which he now realized was a
spacecraft. Barney stopped approximately fifty feet
away from the object and began viewing the UFO through
his binoculars and noticed at least six living creatures

                          47

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

staring back at him from behind the craft's windows.
Barney immediately ran screaming toward his car. Reach-
ing his automobile in a state of near hysteria, he
jammed the car into gear and sped toward his original
destination. Barney and Betty were suddenly aware of
an electronic beeping sound and they began to feel an
odd tingling sensation and were overcome by a dazed
feeling. Sometime later, they were again aware of the
beeping sound and noticed they were almost thirty-five
miles away from the area where the UFO sighting occurred.
Barney and Betty reached their home in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire near daylight. Both their watches had stopped,
but their kitchen cLock read shortly after 5 a.m. This
was particularly odd since they should have arrived home
at approximately 3 a.m. For some peculiar reason, they
were unable to account for two hours of their trip.
Shortly after awakening late that same afternoon, Betty
Hill called her sister and informed her of their exper-
ience. Betty's sister then talked with the former police
chief of Newton, New Hampshire who suggested that the
Hills should report their sighting to nearby Pease,
AFB.(10:47) Betty's sister relayed this information
to her, and Mrs. Hill contacted the Air Police at Peace
AFB the following day, September 21, 1961. Both Barney

                          48

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

and Betty Hill talked with Major Paul W. Henderson of
the 100th Bomb Wing (SAC) at Pease AFB and relayed the
bare outline of their sighting. Since Barney was con-
cerned about being considered irrational, he purposely
avoided mentioning the figures observed in the craft.
(10:47)  The official Air Force Form 112, report
No. 100-1-61, as transcribed by Major Henderson appears
in Project Blue Book files as follows:

        On the night of 19-20 Sept. between 20/0001
    and 20/0100 Mr. & Mrs. Hill were traveling
    south on route 3 near Lincoln, N. H. when they
    observed, through the windshield of their car,
    a strange object in the sky. They noticed it
    because of its shape and the intensity of its
    lighting as compared to the stars in the sky.
    The weather and sky was clear at the time.

    Report contained herein is IAW par. 15, AFR
    200-2, dated 14 Sept. 1959.

    A. Description of Object
        1. Continuous band of lights - cigar shaped
    at all times despite change of direction.
        2. Size: When first observed it appeared
    to be about the size of a nickel at arms length.
    Later when it seemed to be a matter of hundreds
    of feet above the automobile it would be about
    the size of a dinner plate held at arms length.
        3. Color: Only color evident was that of
    the band of light when (sic) was comparable to
    the intensity and color of a filament of an
    incandescent lamB.
    (see reference to "wing tip" lights.)
        4. Number: One
        5. Formation: None
        6. Feature or details: See 1 above. Dur-
    ing periods of observation wings seemed to
    appear from the main body. Described as V-
    shaped with red lights on tips. Later, wings
    appeared to extend further.

                          49

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        7. Tail, trail or exhaust: None ob-
    served.
        8. Sound: None except as described in
    item E.
    B. Description of course of Object.
        1. First observed through windshield of
    car, Size and brightness of object compared
    to visible stars attracted observers' atten-
    tion.
        2. Angle of elevation, first observed:
    about 45 deg.
        3. Angle of elevation at disappearance:
    Not determinable because of inability to ob-
    serve its departure from the auto.
        4. Flight path & maneuvers: See item E.
        5. How object disappeared: See item E.
        6. Length of observation: Approx 30
    min's.
    C.  Manner of Observation
        1. Ground-visual
        2. Binoculars used at times
        3. Sighting made from inside auto while
    moving and stopped. Observed from within and
    outside auto.
    D. Location and details: On the night of
    19-20 September between 20/0001 and 20/0100
    the observers were traveling by car in a
    southernly direction of Route 3 south of
    Lincoln, N.H. when they noticed a brightly
    lighted object ahead of their car at an angle
    of elevation of approximately 45 deg. it appear-
    ed strange to them because of its shape and
    the intensity of its lights compared to the
    stars in the sky. Weather and sky were clear.
    They continued to observe the object from their
    moving car for a few minutes then stopped.
    After stopping the car they used binoculars
    at times.
        They report that the object was traveling
    north very fast. They report it changed dir-
    ections rather abruptly and then headed south.
    Shortly thereafter it stopped and hovered in
    the air. There was no sound evident up to
    this point. While hovering, objects began to
    appear from the body of the "object" which
    they describe as looking like wings which
    made a V-shape when extended. The "wings"
    had red lights on the tips. At this point

                          50

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    they observed it to appear to swoop down in
    the general direction of their auto. The
    object continued to descend until it appeared
    to be only a matter of"hundreds of feet"
    above their car.
        At this point they decided to get out of
    that area, and fast. Mr. Hill was driving and
    Mrs. Hill was prevented from observing its
    full departure by her position in the car.
        They report that while the object was
    above them after it had "swooped down" they
    heard a series of short loud "buzzes" which
    they described as something like someone
    dropped a tuning fork. They report that they
    could feel these buzzing sounds in their auto.
    No further visual observations were made of
    this object. They continued on their trip and
    when they arrived in the vicinity of Ashland,
    N.H,, about 30 miles from Lincoln, they again
    heard the "buzzing" sound of the "object";
    however, they did not see it at this time.
        Mrs. Hill reported the flight pattern of
    the "object" to be erratic, changed directions
    rapidly, that during its flight it ascended
    and descended numerous times very rapidly.
    Its flight was described as jerky and not
    smooth.
        Mr. Hill is a Civil Service employee in
    the Boston Post Office and doesn't possess any
    technical or scientific training. Neither
    does his wife.
        During a later conversation with Mr. Hill,
    he volunteered the observation that he did not
    originally intend to report this incident but
    in as much as he & his wife did see this
    occurrence he decided to report it. He says
    that on looking back he feels that the whole
    thing is incredible and he feels somewhat
    foolish - he just can not believe that such a
    thing could or did happen. He says, on the
    other hand, that they both saw what they re-
    ported and this fact gives it some degree of
    reality.
        Information contained herein was collected
    by means of telephone conversation between the
    observers and the preparing individual. The
    reliability of the observer cannot be judged and
    while his apparent honesty and seriousness

                          51

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    appears to be valid it cannot be judged at
    this time.(26:file)

    There is no indication that the Hills were ever
contacted by the Air Force after this report was filed.
This is particularly strange since Project Blue Book
files show that a UFO was spotted and tracked by Air
Force radar operators at nearby Concord AFS, Vermont
less that seven hours prior to the Hills' sighting.
Another UFO was sighted by Pease AFB precision approach
radar only two hours following the Hill visual sighting,
The report of the first radar sighting was not wired
to the Project Blue Book staff at Wright-Patterson AFB
until nearly three days after the actual sighting took
place. Personnel at the N. Concord AFS, Vermont sent
their TWX on 22 September 1961 at 0234Z. The radar
sighting took place on 19 September at 2122Z.(26:file)
    The report of the Barney and Betty Hill sighting
containing an additional comment regarding the UFO
spotted and tracked by the Pease AFB radar was not
wired to Project Blue Book headquarters, despite the
fact that it was normal USAF policy to do so. Instead,
the Directorate of Administrative Services at Pease AFB
mailed the information to Project Blue Book on September
29, 1961 - eight days after the original Hill report
was filed, An accompanying memo sent by Pease AFB

                          52

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

explained that "Non-availability of observers for
early interrogation precluded electrical transmission
of report."(26:file) This is a particularly puzzling
statement, since the Hills were readily available for
interrogation at any time. Conversations with the Hills
were concluded on September 21, 1961.
    On September 25, 1961, Project Blue Book's Director
sent the information regarding the N. Concord AFS radar
sighting to the Electronics Branch of the USAF's Foreign
Technology Division requesting comment. The Deputy for
Science and Components answered Project Blue Book's
request on September 28, 1961 with the following memo:

    Memo, TD-E (Major Friend), 25 Sep 61, (U) Request
    for Review

    1st Ind (TD-Ela/Mr. V.D. Bryant/74201 28 Sep-
    tember 1961
    TO: TD-E (MaJor Friend)

    1. The relatively low speed and high altitude
    of the subject UFO, coupled with an erratic
    course (including hovering), appear to rule
    out a normal aircraft target and favor some
    target as a weather balloon.
    2. It is suggested that if it is desired to
    pursue the investigation further, a check
    might be made of activities in the area res-
    ponsible for launching and tracking weather
    balloons.

    There is no indication that Project Blue Book ever
checked activities in the area responsible for launching
and tracking weather balloons. The Director of Project
Blue Book apparently accepted the Foreign Technology
Division's explanation.
    The official ProJect Blue Book Project 10073
Record Card regarding the N. Concord AFS radar sighting
reads as follows:

    Page number one of the Form 112 reporting the UFO
sighting of Betty and Barney Hill included the following
radar sighting as an additional item. The subtlety of
its mention, as a mere afterthought, certainly belies its

                          54

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

significance.  The additional item reads as follows:

    ADDITIONAL ITEM :
        During a casual conversation on 22 Sept 61
    between Major Gardiner B. Reynolds, 100th B W
    DCOI and Captain Robert O. Daughaday, Commander
    1917-2 AACS DIT, Pease AFB, NH it was revealed
    that a strange incident occurred at 0214 local
    on 20 Sept. No importance was attached to the
    incident at the time. Subsequent interrogation
    failed to bring out any information in addition
    to the extract of the "Daily Report to the
    Controller". Copy of this extract is attached.
        It is not possible to determine any relation-
    ship between these two observations, as the radar
    observation provides no description. _Time and
    distance between the events could hint of a
    possible relationship._  (Underlining ours)

The extract referred to in the above memo read:

    TRUE EXTRACT OF "DAILY REPORT TO CONTROLLER", AACS
    FORM 96, FOR THE DATE OF 20 SEPTEMBER 1961.

    The official Project Blue Book Project 10073 Record
Card concerning Barney and Betty Hill's visual sighting
of a UFO and the UFO sighted on the Pease AFB radar reads
as follows :

    1. Date: 20 Sep 61
    2. Location; Lincoln, NH

                          55

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Date-Time Group: Local 0001-0100 GMT:
    20 0401-05002
    4. Type of observation: Ground-visual Air
    intercept radar.
    5. Photos: No
    6. Source: Military
    7. Length of observation: 30 min.
    8. No. of objects: 1
    9. Course: N
    10. Brief summary of sighting: Continuous
    band of lights. Cigar-shaped at all times
    despite changes of direction. Wings seemed to
    appear fm main body. Described as V-shaped
    with red lights on tips: later wings appeared.
    to extend further. Appeared about 45 deg.  Varied
    direction abruptly and disappeared to north.
    11. Comments: Both radar and visual sight-
    ing are probably due to conditions resulting
    from strong inversion which prevailed in area
    on morning of sighting. Actual source of
    light viewed is not known but it has all the
    characteristics of an advertising searchlight.
    Radar probably was looking at some ground
    target due to strong inversion (a temperature
    inversion can take place in a perfectly clear
    sky). No evidence indicating objts were due
    to other than natural causes.
    12. Conclusions: Optical condition (later
    changed to "inversion", and still later changed
    to "insufficient data".)(26:file)

    It is interesting to note that the Project 10073
Record Card was typewritten except for a ball-point
checkmark in the air-intercept radar box in item number
four. The official Form 112 submitted to Project Blue
Book by Pease AFB officials indicated the radar sighting
was made on precision-approach radar. Since there was
no indication of an air intercept having taken place,
it might be assumed that the air-intercept radar box
was marked incorrectly. It is important to note, however

                          56

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

that this is merely an assumption of this writer. It
is also interesting to note the comment made in item 11
regarding the UFO as having all the characteristics of
an advertising searchlight. This possible explanation
raises the question of what an advertising searchlight
would have been used for in Lincoln, N.H. between mid-
night and 1 a.m. in the morning. There is no indication
that Project Blue Book ever followed the searchlight
hypothesis although it would have been relatively
simple to discover whether or not a searchlight was
actually in use in Lincoln, N.H. on the date in ques-
tion.
    Project Blue Book certainly can not be blamed for
the time delay regarding the TWX sent by the N. Concord
AFS and letter sent by Pease AFB. They must be given
credit for at least following through, to some extent,
on the N. Concord AFS sighting. It is this writer's
opinion, however, that Project Blue Book's explanation
regarding the searchlight was an example of mere spec-
ulation with no attempt at follow-up.  Although a
correlation between the UFO reported by the Hills and
the UFO tracked on the Pease AFB radar was indicated
as a possibility by Pease AFB officials, Project Blue
Book officials make no further mention of it.

                          57

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On November 15, 1961, almost two months after the
Barney and Betty Hill sighting, a Project Blue Book
official telephoned the Air Weather Service at Ashville
North Carolina requesting copies of Rawinsonde (graphic
adiabatic weather charts) observations of the Lincoln,
N.H. area for 17-22 September 1961. This was an
apparent attempt to support ProJect Blue Book's former
"inversion" explanation. Since Lincoln, N.H. does not
take Rawinsonde observations, and Portland, Maine was
the closest station to do so, Project Blue Book's
hypothesis could not be validated.
    Project Blue Book ended their investigation of
the Barney and Betty Hill sighting and the correspond-
ing radar sightings at this point without ever recon-
tacting the Hills. This is a particularly disturbing
aspect of this sighting. The Hill file is much larger
than many of the other Project Blue Book files, but
this is due primarily to the thickness of news clipping,
and magazine articles that were later included. Project
Blue Book officials made meager attempts at "solving"
the case by asking information of two other USAF offices,
No attempt was made, however, to recontact the Hills
or to interview them in person. No attempt was made to
visit the reported UFO landing sight. No attempt was

                          58

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

made at drawing a possible correlation between the visual
and radar UFO reports even though former Project Blue
Book Director, Captain E.J. Ruppelt admitted as early
as January 24, 1953, that visual reports that supposedly
correlate with erratic radar tracks warrant a detailed
investigation.(24:file)
    The official Air Force explanation regarding the
Hills' UFO sighting turned out to be almost as erratic
as the radar and visual sightings themselves. The
official explanations in this particular case included
"weather inversion", "the Planet Jupiter", "optical
condition", and finally "insufficient data". If one
counts the explanation given for the N. Concord AFS
UFO sighting, the explanation of "weather balloon" can
also be added. "Weather inversion" became a favorite
"catch-all" explanation at Project Blue Book, according
to Dr.J. Allen Hynek. A 3 deg. inversion existing at 6000
feet has been used to explain a sighting made by an
aircraft at 15,000 feet. The Air Force maintains
excellent scientific facilities at its Cambridge lab-
oratories but Project Blue Book officials never once
contacted this facility to calculate whether the inver-
sions to which a sighting was attributed were actually
sufficient, quantitatively, to account for the UFO

                          59

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sighting.(14:268)

     The official Air Force release regarding the Barney
and Betty Hill UFO sighting reads as follows:

    Information on Barney Hill sighting, 20 Sep-
    tember 1961, Lincoln, New Hampshire
        The Barney Hill sighting was investigated
    by officials from Pease AFB. The case is
    carried as insufficient data in the Air Force
    files. No direction (azimuth) was reported
    and there are inconsistencies in the report.
    The sighting occurred about midnight and the
    object was observed for at least one hour. No
    specific details on maneuverability were given.
    The Planet Jupiter was in the South West, at
    about 20 degrees elevation and would have set
    at the approximate time that the object dis-
    appeared. Without positional data the case
    could not be evaluated as Jupiter. There was
    a strong inversion in the area. The actual
    light source is not known. As no lateral or
    vertical movement was noted, the object was
    in all probability Jupiter. No evidence was
    presented to indicate that the object was due
    to other than natural causes.(26:file)

    This official release is confusing since directions
of flight (azimuth) were supplied b@ the Hills. The
official release also mentions inconsistencies in the
Hill report, but none of the inconsistencies are
mentioned, and this writer has been unable to uncover
any. The Planet Jupiter is mentioned in the official
release as the probable sighting observed by the Hills
but Barney and Betty Hill mentioned the fact that the
object passed in front of the moon at one point and
contained colored lights. The official Project Blue

                          60

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book release states that the Hill sighting was observed
for at least one hour, yet the sighting time listed on
the official report was "3O minutes". The Air Force
release also claims that no lateral or vertical move-
ment was noted yet the official Air Force report mentions
descending, ascending, and swooping movements.(26:file)
The official Air Force release concludes by stating
that no evidence was presented to indicate that the
object was due to other than natural causes but makes
no mention of the radar tracking. All in all, the
official investigation of this sighting appears, at
best, to be shallow and incomplete.

               Further Developments in the
               Barney and Betty Hill Case

    In the week following their initial UFO report,
Betty Hill was plagued by nightmares that she and Barney
had encountered a strange roadblock on a lonely New
Hampshire road. She dreamed that a group of men forced
her and Barney to board a spacecraft where they were
both made to submit to a physical examination.(10:48)
During the ensuing months, both Barney and Betty were
increasingly bothered by anxiety and by the disturbing
fact that two hours of the morning of September 20, 1961,
remained unaccounted for. Finally, on February 22, 1964,

                          61

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barney agreed to undergo questioning under hypnosis by
Dr. Benjamin Simon, the distinguished Boston psychi-
atrist and neurologist. Betty Hill was questioned under
hypnosis by Dr. Simon the following week.(11:11) The
tape recorded sessions proved to be fascinating and
uncovered some startling information.
    Under hypnosis, Barney and Betty Hill told of
humanoid (human-like) creatures forcing them to board
a spacecraft. The crew of the spacecraft conversed in
a manner described by Barney as "humming", although
Betty was able to converse with the leader in English
and was able to understand the leader's speech in a
manner not clearly describable by Betty Hill. Barney
and Betty were taken into different rooms for a physical
examination. During the course of the examination, a
needle was inserted into Betty's navel and was explained
as a pregnancy test. After Betty's examination was con-
cluded, she inquired about what appeared to be a star
map on the wall of the spacecraft. The leader explained
that the map was actually a map of exploratory and trade
routes (This star map incident was to play an extremely
important role many years later.) Both Barney and Betty
Hill were told that they would remember nothing of the
time they had spent aboard the spacecraft and were then

                          62

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

released.
    The time that the Hills spent aboard the spacecraft
could very well explain the two hours of their trip
which were previously unaccounted for. Assuming the
examinations did take two hours, and the UFO left shortly
after releasing the Hills, an eerie time correlation can
be drawn between the Hills' reported midnight sighting
and the UFO tracked by Pease AFB radar at 2:L4 a.m.
    The Barney and Betty Hill story was first printed in
a series of six newspaper articles in the "Boston Traveler"
in October 1965. Almost a year later, "Look Magazine" ran
articles describing the Hills' experience and their
testimony under hypnosis. The actual information revealed
under hypnosis was published as a book by John Fuller
entitled, "Interrupted Journey."
    The notoriety surrounding the Hill experience
apparently had little effect on Project Blue Book's
investigation of the case. In fact, Project Blue Book
now considered the Hill case closed with "zero prior-
ity". The only evidence that the new Project Blue Book
staff paid any attention to the renewed notoriety of
the Hill case was the fact that the two "Look Magazine"
articles and copies of the "Boston Traveler" articles
regarding the Hills' experience were included in Project

                          63

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blue Book's official file on the Barney and Betty Hill
case.
    On November 9, 1965, ten days after the last Hill
article appeared in the "Boston Traveler", Project Blue
Book's Deputy Director of Information mailed copies of
the articles to the Pentagon's UFO spokesman. The
articles were later returned to Project Blue Book's
files with a page attached which contained a combination
of sixteen questions or statements in an attempt to dis-
credit the information contained in the "Boston Traveler"
articles. The note was unsigned and it is not known
whether the questions and statements were written by
the Pentagon's UFO spokesman or the Director of Project
Blue Book. Regardless of who wrote the note, it remains
an excellent example of the attitude prevalent through
out the Project Blue Book organization and how little
information the author of the note possessed regarding
a UFO case as extraordinary as the Hills'.
    This writer will list all of the statements and
questions contained in the aforementioned attachment
in the order originally listed.(24:file) Immediately
following each statement or question, this writer will
supply an answer or comment.
    1. (Statement) The Hill case is closed, and has

                          64

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    zero priority.
    Apparently no consideration was given to reopen this
case, even though startling additional revelations under
hypnosis seemed to warrant further investigation.
    2. (Statement) "Foreign" does not mean foreign to
    the United States.

    This statement was made to correct a statement pub-
lished in the first Boston Traveler article regarding
the Hills which appeared on Monday, October 25, 1965.
The article stated that "foreign" (in Foreign Technology
Division) means foreign to this earth and not simply
alien to this country.(18:B-7)
    3. (First Statement) FTD (Foreign Technology
    Division) is directed by AFSC (Air Force Systems
    Command) at Andrews AFB, not the CIA.

    The "Boston Traveler" stated that the FTD was directed
by the CIA which takes over and investigates UFO reports
the Air Force itself cannot explain.(18:B-7)

    3. (Second Statement) The CIA does not investigate
    the unidentifies.

    This was not a completely accurate statement since
the Robertson Panel of 1953 was held under the auspices
of the CIA and investigated UFOs and the findings of
Project Blue Book to date.(29:file)

    4. (Statement) Name one scientist of "astro-
    physicist" studying this case.

    This writer can name one excellent example: Dr. J.

                          65

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allen Hynek, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy
at Northwestern University and the Air Force's Sci-
entific consultant on Project Blue Book.(14:156)

    5. (Statement) NICAP (The National Investigations
    Committee on Aerial Phenomenon) is not a "scien-
    tific" agency.

    This involves a question of semantics. What exactly
is a "scientific agency"? NICAP is a non-profit world-
wide organization incorporated in the District of
Columbia. Its main purpose is the scientific inves-
tigation and research of reported UFOs, and encouragement
of full reporting to the public by responsible author-
ities of all information that the Government has accum-
ulated on the subject.(10:46) Many astronomers, pro-
fessional pilots, and scientists are members of NICAP.

    6. (Question) Walter Webb astronomer? Yes, No?

    Walter Webb was an astronomer and a lecturer on the
staff of Hayden Planetarium.(10:47)

    7. (Question) Is Hill (Barney Hill) emotionally
    mature?

    Dr. Simon, the psychiatrist who questioned Barney
Hill under hypnosis never gave any indication that Mr.
Hill was immature.(10:45) In fact, Barney Hill was
reluctant to report the UFO incident in the first
place.(26:file)

    8. (Statement) Note that they withheld infor-

                          66

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    mation and waited two days (before reporting the
    sighting to Pease AFB). They reported only that
    there appeared a bright star moving toward them in
    a northerly direction.

    The Hills did not wait two days before reporting
the incident. The UFO was spotted in the early minutes
of January 20, 1961. Barney and Betty Hill didn't
arrive home until 5 a.m. on January 20, 1961, and slept
until after 3 p.m.  Betty Hill's sister convinced Betty
and Barney later that same afternoon that their UFO
sighting should be reported to Pease AFB. Since it
was most likely early evening by that time, it does
not seem unusual for the Hills to wait until the fol-
lowing day, September 21, 1961, to report the inci-
dent.(10:47)  The Hills relayed much more information
than simply stating that they had seen a bright star
moving toward them in a northerly direction as was
quite evident from reading their original report included
earlier in this paper.(26:file)

    9. (Question and Statement) Two years later?...
    Evaluated in 1961 (info supplied to Herbert S.
    Taylor in 1963).

    This writer has not determined specifically what
the above question and statement mean. A regular Pro-
ject Blue Book press release was forwarded to Herbert
S. Taylor as requested by Taylor in his letter of
August 27, 1963, but the gist of question and state-

                          67

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ment number nine remains unclear.(26:file)

    10. (Question and Statement) Records? Indicate
    an intensive? Come now. We did not even bother
    to contact the Hills personally.

    This item was in reference to a statement made in
the third "Boston Traveler" article regarding the Hills'
UFO sighting. The article reported as follows: "What
the Air Force wasn't saying, however, is that its
Foreign Technology Division in Ohio has quietly assumed
charge of a new - intensive investigation..." (17:B-2)
It is particularly interesting to note that whoever
typed the list of sixteen questions and statements
admitted that Project Blue Book did not bother to
contact the Hills personally. This is hardly a state-
ment to boast about and once again conveys the shallow-
ness of their "investigation".

    11. (Question) No one else saw the same object
    the Hills did, who are the others???

    Barney Hill insisted that Pease AFB officials
informed him that they had received other reports similar
to his.(26:file) These reports do not appear in the
Project Blue Book files. Of course, two radar sightings
took place which supported the Hills' report, but who
ever composed this list of questions did not refer to
them.

    12. Sought psychiatric help. Does this indicate

                          68

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    emotional maturity? What are the conclusions of
    the psychiatrist ?

    Seeking psychiatric help does not necessarily
indicate immaturity. The conclusions of Dr. Simon
are as follows:

        Some aspects of the experience are un-
    answered, and, perhaps, unanswerable at this
    time. Nothing is finally settled. Nothing is
    absolutely proved to me regarding the alleged
    "abduction". Neither patient is psychotic, and
    both consciously and under hypnosis told what
    they believed to be absolute truth. The char-
    isma of hypnosis has tended to foster the belief
    that it is the magical road to truth. In one
    sense, this is so, but it must be understood
    that hypnosis is a pathway to the truth as it
    is felt and understood by the patient. The
    truth is what he believes to be the truth, and
    this may not be consonant with the ultimate
    and nonpersonal truth. Most frequently it
    is.(10:45)

    l3. (Question) Who was the accredited sci-
    entific investigator who heard the tapes?

    If a representative of Project Blue Book or the Air
Force asked this question, it is rather embarrassing
since their own scientific consultant, Dr. J. Allen
Hynek actually participated in hypnotic sessions
between Dr. Simon and the Hills.   Hynek was not acting
on behalf of the Air Force at the time.

    14. (Statement) Final evaluation is made at
    Wright-Patterson on the data submitted from
    Pease AFB and other information from _their
    own investigation into the matter._ (Under
    lining ours.)

    What other information?  This writer hopes this is

                          69

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

not a reference to Project Blue Book's request for
Rawinsonde observations, which proved futile.

    15. (Statement) The time motion sequence is
    missing in all reports. Such directions as
    "to the right" "up" etc. have no validity.
    Only directions reported in azimuth and eval-
    uation have value.

    The Hills indicated the UFOs elevation when first
sighted and also gave information pertaining to dir-
ection in their report to Pease AFB.(26:file)  The
angle of elevation when the UFO disappeared was not
available but no further information regarding azimuth
or elevation was asked by Pease AFB officials.  Further
information of this nature was revealed by the Hills
while under hypnosis, however, and was readily avail-
able to Project Blue Book in 1966 if they had listened
to Dr. Simon's tapes or had bothered to ask the
Hills.(26:file)

    16. (Statement) The files are maintained at
    Wright-Patterson, not Pease AFB.

    This is a true, but relatively unimportant, state-
ment.

    Prior to the publication of their series of arti-
cles on the Hills, the "Boston Traveler" requested a
copy of the original Air Force Information Report
100-1-61 originally prepared by Major Paul Henderson
at Pease AFB. A "copy" of the report was furnished

                          70

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Project Blue Book one month later. The sixth
article printed by the "Boston Traveler" reported that
"It was actually a typewritten copy, not a repro-
duction. It was mistakingly dated September 1963,
instead of 1961 when the report was compiled. It
made not mention of radar shimmerings..."(19:B-1)
The statement regarding shimmerings was in reference
to an earlier remark by Pease AFB officials that the
UFO appeared on its radar as a "shimmering" - an air
mass phenomena that reflects light from the ground.
(18:B-7) The truth is that the information that Pro-
ject Blue Book released to the "Boston Traveler" was an
_incomplete_ typewritten copy of the original Air Force
Information Report 100-1-61. Project Blue Book had
failed to include the additional item from the report
which referred to a "strange incident (that) occurred
at 0214 local on 20 Sept (1961)." The "strange
incident", of course, was the report of a radar sight-
ing by Pease AFB precision approach radar. The radar
"shimmering" originally reported to the press was much
more than a shimmer indicating an air mass. It was a
bonafide sighting (see page 55). It is not clear why
Project Blue Book purposely withheld information to the
press regarding the Pease AFB radar sighting, but it

                          71

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

certainly supported the Government's attitude that UFOs
did not exist. This was an example of the way Project
Blue Book's final director protected the Government's
attitude. This was also perhaps an example of why this
director remained in his position longer than any of
his predecessors. To paraphrase former Project Blue Book
Director Captain Edward Ruppelt, "the Hill case was
dead - just when the information was getting better."
(29:85) Not only was the Hill case dead, but Project
Blue Book was now mortally ill itself.
    Finally, in October 1966, the Air Force dealt Pro-
ject Blue Book what ultimately proved to be its death
sentence. The Air Force selected the late Dr. Edward
U. Condon and the University of Colorado to conduct
its Scientific Investigation of Unidentified Flying
Objects, a study to determine whether or not Project
Blue Book should be continued.

                  The Condon Committee

    The shortage of funds which continually plagued
the Air Force's Project Blue Book suddenly ceased to
be a problem when the Air Force decided to hire Dr.
Edward Condon to conduct a scientific investigation of
UFOs. The two year investigation to determine whether
or not Project Blue Book should be continued ultimately

                          72

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

cost the Air Force $525,905 and led directly to the
demise of ProJect Blue Book.(30:183)
    Dr. Edward U. Condon was a distinguished physicist
and second in command at the secret atomic installation
in Los Alamos, New Mexico during the development of the
atomic bomb. Dr. Condon was also the former president
of both the American Association for the Advancement of
Science and the American Physical Society, and former
director of the U.S. Government's National Bureau of
Standards.(12:58) The selection of Dr. Condon as
Director of the University of Colorado's Scientific
Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (commonly
referred to as the Condon Committee) seemed to satisfy
both skeptical observers and those convinced of the
existence of UFOs. Dr. Condon's leadership appeared
to promise the scientific objectivity necessary for such
a study, but so obviously missing from Project Blue Book's
methodology. Associations such as the National Inves-
tigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) were
satisfied by the selection of Dr. Condon to lead the
new UFO study, but were bothered by a curious factor.
Four out of the first five investigators appointed by
Condon were psychologists. Robert J. Low, the project's
coordinator and key operations man held a Master's

                          73

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Degree in Business Administration (although his B.A.
was in Electrical Engineering). Many observers felt
that more physical scientists were needed and Dr. Condon
later corrected this imbalance.(12:58) Since Dr. Condor
pledged a fair study, UFOlogists such as Dr. J. Allen
Hynek, aided by NICAP, briefed the Condon Committee.
NICAP trained field teams and loaned the Condon Commit-
tee verified UFO reports submitted by pilots, aerospace
engineers and other capable observers.(12:62)
    It appeared to satisfied UFOlogists that an objec-
tive UFO study was finally underway. Their satisfaction
was short-lived, however, by a remark made by the Pro-
ject Coordinator of the Condon Committee in October 1966,
Robert Low was quoted by "The Denver Post" as saying that
the UFO project "comes pretty close to the criteria of
nonacceptability" as a university function.(12:58) On
January 25, 1967, Dr. Edward Condon, speaking before an
honorary scientific fraternity remarked, "Unidentified
Flying obJects are not the business of the Air Force...
it is my inclination right now to recommend that the
Government get out this business...my attitude right
now is that there's nothing to it...but I'm not supposed
to reach a conclusion for another year...."(12:58) The
fact that Dr. Condon maintained that some of his remarks

                          74

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

had been taken out of context did little to bolster the
confidence that UFOlogists formerly possessed regarding
the Condon Committee. NICAP continued to cooperate with
Dr. Condon and the University of Colorado but was increas-
ingly disturbed by rumors of internal friction from within
the Condon Committee. Robert Low was apparently giving
staff members considerable leeway in the approaches
they were taking to the study. Dr. Condon appeared
before committee members infrequently and could rarely
be reached by phone. During this time, Dr. David R.
Sanders, a scientific investigator on Condon's staff
complained that several interesting UFO cases were turned
down by project coordinator Low for what was apparently
specious reasons.(12:50) Dr. Norman Levine, another
scientific member on Dr. Condon' s staff, joined the pro-
ject after it was well underway and was immediately
aware of the strained atmosphere developing between Low
and several members of the staff. Dr. Condon, himself, was
heard to say that he wished he could give the Air Force's
money back.(12:59)
    The project's credibility suffered another blow when
a member of Dr. Condon's staff was asked to speak before
a teachers association regarding the UFO project. The
staff member began looking for information regarding

                          75

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the origin of the project and was advised to check the
open file folder under the heading "Air Force Contract
and Background".(12:59) This advice led to the discovery
of a memo written by Dr. Robert Low to university offic-
ials on August 9, 1966, three months before the UFO
study officially began. The memo, labeled "Some Thoughts
on the UFO Project" revealed the study was not as objec-
tive and unbiased as first thought. Robert Low's memo
to university officials read:

        Our study would be conducted almost exclus-
    ively by nonbelievers who, although they could-
    n't possibly prove a negative result could, and
    probably would, add an impressive body of evi-
    dence that there is no reality to the obser-
    vations. The trick would be, I think, to des-
    cribe the project so that, to the public, it
    would appear a totally objective study but to
    the scientific community would present the
    image of a group of nonbelievers trying their
    best to be objective, but having almost zero
    expectation of finding a saucer. One way to do
    this would be to stress investigation, not of
    physical phenomena, but rather of the people
    who do the observing - the psychology and soc-
    iology of persons and groups who report seeing
    UFOs. If the emphasis were put here, rather
    than on examination of the old question of the
    physical reality of the saucer, I think the
    scientific community would quickly get the mes-
    sage....I'm inclined to feel at this early
    stage that, if we set up the thing right and
    take pains to get proper people involved and
    have success in presenting the image we want
    to present to the scientific community, we
    could carry the job off to our benefit.(30:211)

    Professor Condon continued to make statements not
befitting a supposedly unbiased scientific investi

                          76

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

gator. On September 13, 1967, Dr. Condon made a speech
at the Atomic Spectroscopy Symposium at Gaithersburg,
Maryland. The entire body of Dr. Condon's speech was
dedicated to UFO reports made by obviously disturbed
People. Dr. Condon, failed to mention or elaborate
on any of the good, solid reports that comprised a
large majority of UFO sightings. It was particularly
disturbing to Dr. Hynek, NICAP, Dr. Levine, David Sanders
and many other members of the Condon Committee that Pro-
fessor Condon seemed preoccupied with the antics of the
lunatic fringe and the "kookie" aspects of the UFO
problem.(14:206)
    The Condon Committee decided to investigate eighty-
seven UFO reports. Fourteen of the eighty-seven cases
were previously evaluated by both Project Blue Book and
NICAP as obvious misperceptions. Dr. Condon selected
only a small percentage of the total cases for review;
and unfortunately, many of those he chose were trivial.
(14:204)
    Many of Dr. Condon's staff became increasingly
disturbed by the biased, unscientific, and negative
approach Dr. Condon and Robert Low were taking toward
the UFO study.(12:60) The majority of Condon's staff
once considered resigning en masse or issuing a press

                          77

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

release or a minority report. They speculated that Dr.
Condon was tired and disenchanted.(12:60)
    On January 19, 1968, Dr. James McDonald of the
University of Arizona informed Dr. Condon that he was
personally disturbed by Condon's disturbing preoccu-
pation with crackpots and the negative tone of Dr.
Condon's statements over a period of time.  Dr. McDonald
stressed that he was also disappointed in Dr. Condon's
failure to personally investigate significant field
cases or to question any of the working staff who had
been making a serious UFO study.(12:61)  At this point Dr.
David Saunders and Dr. Norman Levine released Dr. Low's
memo to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. James McDonald, and
NICAP. Dr. Condon, furious at the news leak from what
he considered confidential files, immediately fired both
Saunders and Levine. Actually, the files were never
considered personal. The relaxed open-file system was
part of a general policy to keep the UFO project out of
the cloak-and-dagger category.(12:69) NICAP immediately
suspended cooperation with the Condon Committee upon
the firing of Saunders and Levine, and the obvious
slanted approach being taken by Robert Low and Dr.
Condon. Mary Louise Armstrong, a member of the Condon
Committee and former secretary for Dr. Condon as well

                          78

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

as a supporter of Dr. Saunders and Dr. Levine resigned
her position soon after their firings. Her letter of
resignation accused Project Director Robert Low with neg-
ativism and bias.(14:212)
    It was regrettable that Saunders was fired because he
had begun to computerize the UFO data available from var-
ious sources and had over 30,000 cases on tape available
for analysis.(14:200) This was precisely the type of meth-
odology that Dr. Hynek maintained Project Blue Book lacked.
Dr. Condon had the most sophisticated data ever recorded
at his fingertips but disregarded it when Saunders was
fired. Dr. Condon, instead, analyzed eighty-seven cases,
many current, and many of which did not even satisfy the
definition of legitimate UFO reports.(14:200)
    In 1969, to almost no one's surprise, what was left
of the Condon Committee released its findings which con-
cluded:

        Careful consideration of the record as it
    is available to us leads us to conclude that
    further extensive study of UFOs probably can
    not be justified in the expectation that science
    will be advanced hereupon.(14:193)

    As if this were not enough, Dr. Condon displayed
his bias openly in the summary of his study by stating:

        A related problem to which we wish to direct
    public attention is the miseducation in our
    schools which arises from the fact that many
    children are being allowed, if not merely encour-

                          79

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    aged, to devote their science study-time to
    the reading of UFO books and magazine articles
    of the type referred to in the preceding para-
    graph. We feel that children are educationally
    harmed by absorbing unsound and erroneous mat-
    erial as if it were scientifically well founded.
    Such study is harmful not merely because of the
    erroneous nature of the material itself, but
    also because such study retards the development
    of a critical faculty with regard to scientific
    evidence, which to some degree ought to be part
    of the education of every American.
        Therefore, we strongly recommend that teachers
    refrain from giving students credit for school
    work based on their reading of the presently
    available UFO books and magazine articles. Teach-
    ers who find their students strongly motivated
    in this direction should attempt to channel their
    interests in the direction of serious study of
    astronomy and meteorology, and in the direction
    of critical analysis of arguments for fantastic
    propositions that are being supported by appeals
    to fallacious reasoning or false data.
        We hope that the results of our study will
    prove useful to scientists and those responsible
    for the formation of public policy generally in
    dealing with this problem which has now been
    with us for 21 years.(1:8)

This could hardly be considered the remarks of an un-
biased scientist.  These closing remarks by Dr. Condon
were disturbingly similar to the attitudes expressed
by some of the scientific fraternity of antiquity
regarding anything that differed from their beliefs.
Since the Air Force accepted the Condon Report in its
entirety, Project Blue Book was doomed and officially
closed its files on December 18, 1969. Once more
Captain Ruppelt's now prophetic statement comes to
mind: "here were people deciding that there was nothing

                          80

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

to this UFO busi@ess right at a time when the reports
seemed to be getting better."(29:83) The visual reports
were not only getting better, some reports were even
supported through hypnosis and the use of sodium
pentothal.

            The Pascagoula, Mississippi Case

    On October 11, 1973, Charles Hickson and Calvin
Parker, two Pascagoula, Mississippi shipyard workers,
claimed they were abducted and forced to board a space
craft. While aboard the craft, they claimed to have
undergone a physical examination much like the one
described by Barney and Betty Hill. On October 30,
1973 , Charles Hickson was hypnotized and underwent a
2 1/2 hour lie detector test administered by a New Orleans
detective firm. Officials claimed the test confirmed
that Hickson was telling the truth as to what he be-
lieved happened.(16:4) Parker did not undergo lie
detection tests because of a nervous breakdown immed-
iately following the UFO sighting. Calvin Parker still
refuses to give interviews or even talk about his UFO
experience. He simply wants to be left alone.(7:47)
Charles Hickson, like Barney Hill, stated under hyp-
nosis that the humanoids aboard the UFO conversed in
a "humming" manner.(7:40) As in the Barney and Betty

                          81

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hill case, the Pascagoula sighting was also observed by
radar shortly after Parker and Hickson claimed they
were released.

             The Bahia Blanca, Argentina Case

    During the same month as the Pascagoula, Mississippi
UFO sighting, Senor Dionisio Yanca, an Argentine trucker
suffering from unexplained shock underwent treatment
with sodium pentothal. While under the effect or this
truth serum, Senor Yanca claimed he was forced by
aliens from another galaxy to spend 1 1/2 hours aboard a
flying saucer. Like Barney Hill and Charles Hickson,
Senor Yanca stated that the UFO occupants conversed in
a "humming" manner.(13:21-A) Senor Yanca maintained
that creatures from the spaceship connected a hose to
high tension wires and another to a small lagoon. The
Bahia Blanca Electric Company reported a sharp and unex-
plained rise in power consumption at the time and a
UFO was sighted by an Argentine airbase near Bahia
Blanca on the same day Senor Yanca claimed he was
abducted. Senor Yanca cannot remember any portion of
the UFO incident when he is conscious and not under the
influence of truth serum.(13:21-A)

                          82

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                The Ubatuba, Brazil Case

    Many excellent UFO sightings have occurred in South
America including a sighting which produced three frag-
ments from a UFO that exploded in midair near Ubatuba,
Brazil in September 1957. Fishermen reported seeing a
UFO approaching the beach at an unbelievable speed.
The object pulled upward at the last moment and exploded
over the ocean. Several small particles landed on the
beach and were retrieved by the fishermen. Three of
these particles were sent to the Aerial Phenomenon
Research Organization (APRO) in Tucson, Arizona by the
late Dr. Olavo T. Fontes, M.D., APRO's representative
in Brazil.(30:171) The Mineral Production Laboratory,
a division of Mineral Production in Brazil's Ministry
of Agriculture analyzed the metal fragments. The anal-
ysis proved the density of one sample to be 1.866. The
density of pure terrestrial magnesium is 1.741.(30:171)
APRO submitted one fragment to the Air Force for further
analysis, but an emission spectrograph operator acciden-
tally burned up the entire sample before obtaining any
results. The Air Force asked for another sample but
APRO refused. APRO finally relented and consented to
send one of the two remaining particles to the Atomic
Energy Commission Laboratories, but these tests also

                          83

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

proved disastrous. This particle was also "accidentally"
destroyed with no further explanation.(30:171)
    Dr. David Saunders, of the Condon Committee, felt this
case possessed unusual potential merit and requested
that a piece of the remaining metallic fragment be mailed
to the University of Colorado. APRO would not entrust
valuable material to the United States mail and informed
Dr. Saunders that he would have to pick it up personally.
Dr. Norman Levine flew to Tucson, picked up a piece of
the fragment, and returned to Boulder, Colorado. Another
member of the Condon Committee later delivered the frag-
ment to Washington D.C. where it was analyzed by the
FBI laboratory. Analysis showed that the sample was
99.9% pure magnesium with an odd pattern of impurities
containing strontium, zinc, barium, manganese, and chro-
mium(30:173) The hypothesis drawn was that the alloy
had unusual strength. In 1957, the alloy was apparently
unknown on this planet. Today we do have the technology
to produce a large piece of the alloy and to test the
high strength hypothesis.(30:173)
    The Ubatuba, Brazil UFO sighting was not listed in
Project Blue Book's files and, as far as this writer
could determine, no mention was made of the metalur-
gical analysis made of the UFO fragments. This partic-

                          84

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ular case, although researched by investigators of the
Condon Committee, was not referred to in the final Condon
Report. This was not particularly surprising since Dr.
David Saunders and Dr. Norman Levine performed much of
the work on this particular case. When these two men
were fired from the Condon Cornmittee, much of their
effort was unfortunately discarded by Dr. Condon.

                 New Developments in the
               Barney and Betty Hill Case

    A fascinating postscript to the Barney and Betty
Hill case occurred shortly after the termination of Pro-
ject Blue Book. Shortly after the Hill sighting was
publicized, Marjorie Fish, a school teacher from Oak
Harbor, Ohio decided to construct a three dimensional
replica of all stars 32.6 light-years from our sun. In
1964, while hypnotized, Betty Hill had described and
sketched a star map she had seen on the wall of the space
ship she had been forced to enter in 1961. The purpose
of Marjorie Fish's three dimensional star model was an
attempt to locate the specific star pattern described
by Betty Hill in 1964. The star model was an intricate
and complicated device, but with the aid of the 1957 Von
W. "Gliese Star Catalog", each star was laboriously and
tediously placed in its proper location by threading

                          85

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

various colored beads on nylon thread and knotting them
in place.
    In 1968, just as Marjorie Fish believed her star
model was nearly complete, a Gliese supplement was
published listing another 1000 stars. After completing
the project, Marjorie Fish was unable to locate the
proper star pattern regardless of the viewing angle
employed.(9:36) Marjorie Fish then enlarged her star
model to include all stars thought capable of sustain-
ing life within 65 light-years' radius of the Earth.
Finally, in 1969, Marjorie Fish received the break
through she had been searching for. The incident is
graphically described by UFOlogist Stanton Friedman:

        Suddenly, almost magically, nine of the
    stars in the pattern appeared; the same angular
    pattern was too precise to be a coincidence...
    Unmistakably, about 36 light-years away, were
    the two close base stars. Zeta 1 Reticuli and
    Zeta 2 Reticuli in the Constellation of Reticulum,
    stars which are not familiar sights to persons
    living in the Northern Hemisphere but which can
    be seen by an observer with a telescope who is
    below the Equator! The alien trade and explor-
    ation lines became perfectly logical, going only
    to systems considered to have planets where life
    might develop. Their travel route was also
    logical, going first to the nearest star and then
    to the next one farther out, rather than skipping
    around. The extraterrestrials had an advantage
    in that the trip from Zeta 1 to Zeta 2 was a quick
    jump of about one twentieth of a light-year - no
    great distance for their early space explorers.
    In our case, the nearest star of any kind is
    Alpha Centauri which is over four light-years
    from our Sun.

                          86

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Most of the other stars in the pattern were
    quickly identified: Sol, Alpha Mensae, Tau Ceti,
    82 Eridani, 107 Piscium, 54 Piscium, and Gliese
    67. Still missing were the three stars which
    formed the triangle to the left of the map Betty
    had drawn, stars close enough to the surface of
    the alien map to form a distinct geometric design
    standing out prominently in Betty's memory... It
    wasn't until the updated "1969 Gliese Catalogue
    of Nearby Stars" became available to Marjorie
    that the last three stars with connecting lines
    as well as the stars in the triangle could be
    pinned down and identified as the Constellation
    Fornax. The triangle stars are identified by
    the Gliese numbers of 86.1, 95, and 97. With
    that specific star data, Marjorie had all the
    proof she needed to confirm that Betty's map
    could only have been drawn at the time as a
    result of contact with extraterrestrials!
        The Hills' experience occurred in 1961.
    Betty Hill drew the map under hypnotic sug-
    gestion in 1964. But, in 1964, the star 86.1
    was not in any earthly star catalog as it had
    not yet been listed! The other two stars,
    95 and 97, had formerly been catalogued by
    astronomers in incorrect parallax positions
    which never would have produced the visual
    star triangle Betty saw on the alien map!
    The "1969 Gliese Catalogue" now made those
    spatial corrections. No astronomer on Earth
    from 1961 to 1964 could have known that the
    triangle of background stars existed in its
    present geometric design....(9:54, 56)

    The discovery of an actual star pattern to match
Betty Hill's drawing was not the only fascinating post-
script to the Barney and Betty Hill sighting. In 1964,
Betty Hill maintained under hypnosis that humanoids
aboard a UFO had inserted a needle in her navel as a
test for pregnancy. This type of pregnancy testing was
unheard of at the time of the Hills' UFO sighting in

                          87

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1961 and Betty's testimonial under hypnosis in 1964. In
the May 18, 1971, issue of "Look Magazine", however, an
article described the research of German and English
doctors who used a pencil-like viewing device, termed
an Iapaoscope. The device was inserted through a
woman's navel and provided a "panoramic view of the
peritoneal cavity and its contents". A procedure des-
cribed by Betty Hill in 1964, and unknown to medical
science at that time, was now a reality ten years after
Betty Hill's physical examination by members of a UFO
crew allegedly took place.(9:54)
    The cases described in the latter portions of this
chapter are simply a few of the thousands of UFO sight-
ings which occur each year. Organizations such as
NICAP and APRO continue to do their best to research and
document all reports received by their offices, but they
lack the funds and the scope that a government-sponsored
organization might possess. Many good UFO sightings
remain unreported today simply because the observer does
not know where or to whom he should report them. If the
observer reports a UFO sighting to a nearby air base, he
is given the following standard reply:

        On 17 December 1969 the Air Force termi-
    nated Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO
    investigation program. This decision was
    based on a University of Colorado study of

                          88

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    the program, a review of the University of
    Colorado's report by the National Academy of
    Sciences, past UFO studies and two decades of
    Air Force experience in investigating UFOs.
    The conclusions drawn from Project Blue Book
    were: (1) no UFO reported, investigated, and
    evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any
    indication of threat to our national secur-
    ity; (2) there has been no evidence submitted
    to or discovered by the Air Force that sight-
    ings categorized as "unidentified" represent
    technological developments or principles beyond
    the range of present-day scientific knowledge;
    and (3) there has been no evidence indicating
    that sightings categorized as "unidentified"
    are extraterrestrial vehicles.
        With the termination of Project Blue Book,
    the regulation establishing and controlling
    the program was rescinded and the Project
    Blue Book records were transferred to the Air
    Force Archives where they are available for a
    cost to cover duplicating. The Air Force,
    then, is no longer involved in UFO investi-
    gation.(31:4)

    The above memo has been forwarded to all USAF bases
and has been headed   "GUIDANCE FOR REPLYING TO UFO
INQUIRIES".  The paragraph preceding the body of the
memo is addressed to personnel who will disseminate
the message and reads as follows:

        From time to time we receive inquiries on
    how to handle UFO inquiries and sighting reports.
    Our response to letters and Congressional Inquir-
    ies provides the following information, which you
    may wish to keep as policy for answering inquir-
    ies...(31:4i

    It is interesting to note that the above paragraph
refers to the fact that even Congressional Inquiries
are answered with the same explanation. The final para-

                          89

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

graph following the prepared reply for UFO inquiries
contains another message for Air Force personnel in
charge of answering UFO reports:

        As further amplification, we suggest to
    inquirers that if they are concerned about
    their safety as a result of a UFO, they
    should contact a law enforcement agency. If
    they believe the UFO sighting has scientific
    value, they should contact the nearest univer-
    sity.(31:4)

    One regrettable aspect of the Air Force's UFO project
was that many foreign governments neglected to undertake
UFO studies of their own. They felt that the United
States with all its facilities, was able to handle the
problem better than countries with more Limited facil-
ities.(14:173)
    One country that didn't neglect to undertake its own
study is the USSR. Dr. Vsevold Troitsky, a well-known
soviet astrophysicist is currently in charge of four
widely-spaced detection stations. The stations are
designed to monitor signals from outer space and are
located in Siberia where man-made radio interference is
at a minimum. The results of this project have been
detected by Russian scientists several times a day for
a few minutes at a time. Dr. Troitsky claims the signals
were obviously carrying a message.(28:22) The sounds
are described by Dr. Troitsky and his associate, Dr.

                          90

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nikolai Karadzshev as "definite call signals" from
another planet within our solar system that could only
have been transmitted by "civilized beings". Both
Soviet and American scientists denied that the signals
were coming from known spacecraft.(28:22)
    The United States might well have been ahead of the
Soviet detection system if the U.S. Government had
followed the advice of Bernard M. Oliver ten years ago.
Oliver, recognized as one of the top electronic eng-
ineers in the country, proposed a listening station
that would "enable man to detect even the unintended
radiation from another intelligent race..."(28:22) In
the decade that was passed since Mr. Oliver made his
suggestion regarding a U.S. detection system, Project
Blue Book has been terminated. There seems little
evidence that Congress is ready to initiate, or even
suggest, another UFO study at this time, although some
members of Congress are well aware of the shortcomings
of Project Blue Book. Representative J. Edward Roush
(D-Ind) readily admits "the Air Force's Investigation
of UFOs was a farce" and the Condon Report "was a ruse
for the purpose of eliminating any further governmental
interest". Congressman Roush added that it is his
feeling that "many Congressmen are interested in UFOs"

                          91

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

but he feels there will be no move to appropriate money
for another study at present, because of today's polit-
ical climate.(35:17)
    The question remains: If funds were available for
a federally-sponsored UFO study, who should undertake it?
The United States Air Force still has the world's best
resources and facilities available to conduct such an
investigation, but they tried once and failed. Is it
possible, after a five year hiatus and a new Air Force
Chief of Staff that the Air Force is now capable of
conducting an unbiased politically free UFO investi-
gation? The writers feel that this is extremely doubt-
ful. General George S. Brown, the new Air Force Chief
of Staff, admittedly encourages more open discussion
between the Air Force, the media, and the general public
than his predecessor. General Brown's philosophy of
open discussion apparently does not seem to pertain to
himself, however, at least so far as the subject of
UFOs is concerned.
    On August 13, 1973, Mr. Allen F. Sandler, President,
Institutional Films, Inc. wrote a letter to SAFOI inform-
ing them of an upcoming television documentary on UFOs
that he was producing. The film was to be narrated by
Mr. Rod Serling and Mr. Sandler informed SAFOI that one

                          92

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the goals of the program was to clarify the position
of the Department of the Defense regarding UFOs and to
clear up the misconception that there is a government
conspiracy to cover up the UFO project. In a letter to
SAFOI dated October 29, 1973, Mr. Sandler enclosed a
script of his intended production of UFOs for SAFOI's
evaluation.   Mr. Sandler also requested permission to
film various Air Force locations, the Project Blue Book
files, and to film an interview with General George S.
Brown.  On December 12, 1973, Norman T. Hatch, Chief,
Audio-Visual Division, Directorate for Defense Infor-
mation, Washington, D.C., answered Mr. Sandler's re-
quests by giving him permission to photograph certain
unclassified portions of the requested areas. As for
Mr. Sandler's request to interview General Brown, Mr.
Hatch wrote the following reply:

        General George S. Brown and Colonel George
    Weinbrenner do not desire to participate in the
    UFO program. No film interviews with military
    personnel at the above-mentioned installations
    are authorized. Any further requests for film
    interviews must be submitted to this office for
    approval....We agree with your suggestion that
    the official Department of Defense position be
    expressed on the show. If you desire, a spokes-
    man will be made available to be filmed stating
    the current position of the Department of Defense
    on UFOs.(31:2)

    There was no mention made as to whom the possible
Air Force spokesman would be, but Mr. Sandler later

                          93

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

informed employees who safeguard the Project Blue Book
files that the Last Director of Project Blue Book would
appear in his television documentary. Whether or not
the former Director of Project Blue Book is the official
government spokesman, there is little doubt as to what
the position of the Department of the Defense will be.
Page one of Mr. Hatch's letter of December 12, 1973,
to Mr. Sandler includes a remark which is a good indica-
tion that the current Air Force position on Project Blue
Book and UFOs has remained unchanged since 1969:

        Components of the DoD have not engaged in
    the investigation of UFO reports for several
    years. The mission ended for the simple rea-
    son that no scientific evidence supported a
    need for its continuation.(31:1)

                          94

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        CHAPTER V

             CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    There are many fascinating and convincing argu-
ments both supporting and refuting the existence of
UFOs. Advocates of both positions have one thing in
common: they are very often rigid in their beliefs
and inflexible to arguments which conflict with their
hypotheses. But after pro and con evidence has been
weighed, after the scientific dogmatism has been elim-
inated, after explanations of natural phenomena have
been accounted for, and long after the facade of ob-
vious deception has been stripped away, one entity
remains obvious: there have been literally thousands
of credible UFO sightings that have lacked satisfac-
tory explanation. Millions of respectable people
have witnessed something in the heavens that simply
cannot be explained as natural phenomena.

                      Conclusions

    After completing the UFO research and after scru-
tinizing the original Project Blue Book files, the

                          95

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

writers have concluded that both Project Blue Book and
the Condon report seem to lack credibility. Both
investigations appear to be biased, shallow attempts
at explaining the complex mysteries of UFOs. But why?
Why should Project Blue Book, with the world's best
facilities readily available, end in such dismal
failure? The lack of a satisfactory answer to this
question has given rise to other questions concerning
Project Blue Book. Was there political pressure on
the part of the Air Force or some other governmental
agency to cover-up or influence the investigation and
conclusions of the Project Blue Book staff?  Why didn't
the Air Force transcribe their UFO findings to data
processing and a central memory bank for easier cross-
reference? Did the constant changing of Project Blue
Book's directorship upset the stability of the inves-
tigation?

          The Question of Political Pressure

    The writers feel that the Air Force did, indeed,
influence the conclusions reached by the Project Blue
Book staff. On September 23, 1947, the Chief of ATIC
sent a retter to the Commanding General of the Armed
Forces stating that UFOs were real. One year later,
the official Air Force attitude seemed to have mysteri-

                          96

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ously reversed itself at a time when former Project
Blue Book Director, Captain E. J. Ruppelt, admitted that
UFO reports were getting better.(29:85) The writers
found that since late September 1947, the Air Force
apparently made it a standard operating procedure to
support their new-founded hypothesis no matter how con-
vincing the evidence was to the contrary. Although
many UFO sightings were admittedly easily explainable,
the Air Force and Project Blue Book repeatedly resorted
to trite unfounded explanations in an attempt to ex-
plain even the more credible UFO reports. Promising
leads were often dropped with unsatisfactory explana-
tions, questionable UFO reports listed as a "possible
balloon" or "possibly a planet" were changed to "balloon"
or "planet" for no apparent reason other than closing
the files on the cases. If there were many witnesses
to a UFO sighting, the Project Blue Book staff would
ask for further proof, such as photos. If photos were
supplied, they were branded as "fakes". If motion
picture footage was furnished, it was labeled as "natural
phenomena" and sometimes returned to the owner with
several frames of film missing. If supposed fragments
of a UFO were sent to a government lab for study, they
were "accidentally" destroyed while undergoing examina-

                          97

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tion. In short, the Air Force seemed to repeatedly
exhibit bias and to conduct shoddy methodology in lieu
of professionally scientific investigation. The methods
used gave the writers the impression that there was
political pressure to influence the investigation and
conclusions of the Project Blue Book staffs.
    It is difficult to determine whether or not pressure
was applied to Project Blue Book by any governmental
agency other than the Air Force. We do know that the
Robertson panel met in 1953 under the auspices of the
CIA and that the records of this meeting are "mysteri-
uusly" clipped from the original Project Blue Book files,
but the writers have not been able to determine who was
responsible for this censorship. We also know that Dr.
Edward Condon was selected by the Department of Defense
to conduct the investigation which ultimately led to the
demise of Project Blue Book. Why was Dr. Condon, of all
qualified scientists, selected?  Was it simply because
he was a renowned scientist? Was it because he was
formerly Assistant Director of the Atomic Bomb Project
at Los Alamos Proving Grounds and could be trusted with
sensitive information? Or was it because Dr. Condon,
in his previous capacity, might have been affiliated
with another governmental agency such as the CIA? The

                          98

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

writers do not know. Any conclusion would merely be
speculation. It seems odd, however, that a renowned
scientist of Dr. Condon's stature, a man whose entire
life had been dedicated to careful research and sci-
entific methodology peculiarly conducted a very biased
and amateurish UFO investigation which was certainly
unworthy of a man of Dr. Condon's esteem. Why? Again,
the writers do not know for certain, but pressures
applied by another governmental agency cannot be ruled
out as the possible cause of such unorthodox action.

         The Question of Project Blue Book's
                     Filing System

    It would have been extremely beneficial to transfer
the various aspects of Project Blue Book's UFO sightings
to data processing and a central memory bank for valuably
future cross-reference, but no attempt was made to do so
Why? Would the cost have been prohibitive? This is
doubtful since the Air Force apparently had little trou-
ble in obtaining over $500,000 for the Condon Study.
Was it possible that the Air Force didn't want its UFO
information to be cross-referenced for future UFO
studies and correlations? This theory could conceiv-
ably possess merit. Not only did the Air Force fail
to commit its valuable data regarding UFO sightings to

                          99

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

data processing, but Dr. Condon completely disregarded,
and presumably destroyed, over 30,000 such computerized
inputs. These inputs were tabulated by a Condon Com-
mittee member, Dr. David Saunders, who was attempting
to put the UFO information in some useable order. Dr.
Saunders was later fired by Dr. Condon.
    The writers feel it is extremely important that any
new UFO study be completely computerized and that all
data currently stored in Project Blue Book's files be
computerized for easy cross reference. If this were
accomplished, it would be quite simple to immediately
compare various aspects of sightings throughout the
world with other sightings that have taken place. A
lack of this type of methodical record-keeping was one
of the most significant criticisms of Project Blue
Book's filing system. The Barney and Betty Hill sight-
ing, for instance, had many things in common with the
Pascagoula, Mississippi and Bahia Blanca sightings.
Barney Hill, Charles Hickson, and Dionisio Yanca all
maintained under the influence of hypnosis or sodium
pentothal (truth serum) that their captives employed
a "humming-type" of speech, the skin color (or lack of
color) of the UFO occupants was basically the same in
all three cases, as was the description of the interior

                          100

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

lighting of the three space ships. These are extremely
important observations, but there is presently no method
to compare such facts as these without painstaking re-
search of each individual sighting. A computer memory
bank would eliminate the necessity for this time-con-
suming and methodical research, thus many comparisons
and conclusions could conceivably be drawn that might
otherwise be overlooked.

           The Question of Project Blue Book's
                   Changing Directorship

    Did the constant changing of Project Blue Book's
Directorship upset the stability of the Project's UFO
investigation? The writers feel that this is very
likely. While it is true that the Air Force has a
policy of shifting its personnel, the writers feel that
a better method of appointing and retaining Project
Blue Book Directors could have been followed. Instead
of appointing young officers with little background or
motivation to lead such an important project as Project
Blue Book, more importance should have been placed on
a potential director's background, his technical exper-
tise, and his familiarity with scientific research and
methodology. Project Blue Book's Directors should have
been appointed to at least a four year tour and their

                          101

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

successor should have possessed equal qualifications
and tenure. The writers are mindful or the fact that
the last Director of Project Blue Book remained at the
helm for over six years, but the writers believe that
there is sufficient evidence to assume that he was
retained because of his willingness to "go along with
the pretext".

             The Question of a New Study

    It is apparent to the writers that Project Blue
Book suffered from bias, faulty research, political
pressure, an inadequate staff, and a shoddy, antiquated
filing system. In short, Project Blue Book lacked the
necessary scientific methodology warranted by an impor-
tant study of this nature.
    The writers feel that their research has proven a
new UFO study is definitely warranted. Any new study,
however, should profit from the mistakes of Project
Blue Book and the Condon Committee and incorporate the
lessons learned from their failures. Any new UFO pro-
gram should be free from bias and political influence;
it should also transcribe all old and new input concern-
ing UFO sightings to data processing and a central mem-
ory bank.  Any new UFO study should carefully employ
scientific methodology in their investigation and should

                          102

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

maintain a stable, well-qualified, highly motivated
leadership. But once again, the writers must ask the
question: If a new UFO study is warranted, who should
undertake it?
    It is doubtful that the Air Force, or any DoD agency
could conduct a truly scientific study in this politi-
cally volatile subject, considering the past history of
Project Blue Book. Any new UFO study should be inde-
pendent of the military and should be undertaken by
Prominent scientists and astronomers in the United States.
Ideally, these scientists could form a national organ-
ization whose prime purpose would be the investigation
of UFOs. Such an organization could cooperate and ex-
change information with scientists and astronomers
throughout the world, as well as with private agencies
such as Dr. J. Allen Hynek's Center for UFO studies.
Such an organization should be financed by the govern-
ment and should report to a congressional sub-committee.
Hopefully, this would free the organization from poli-
tical influence, bias, and pre-judgement, and would
encourage an open discussion of questions and findings.
Ideally, such a national organization would divide the
United States into regions or sections. Each area
should maintain transportation which would be available

                          103

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

whenever needed to investigate UFO sightings and landings
within a few hours of their occurrence.
    Much has happened since Congressman J. Edward Roush
remarked that he felt there was a little chance of
congress appropriating money for a new UFO study. A
new desire for truth from government officials and
agencies is rampant throughout the land. Perhaps in
today's world of congressional hearings and behind-the
scenes government exposes, the shallowness and hypocrisy
of the Project Blue Book and Condon investigations can
be more readily comprehended by members of congress.
This possibility together with the increasing cred-
ibility of current UFO sightings, some even supported
by hypnosis and sodium pentothal, could possibly con-
vince congress that there is indeed a definite need to
support a new UFO investigation.

                     Recommendations

    As a result of this study, the following specific
recommendations are made concerning Project Blue Book:

    1.  A new UFO study should be initiated under
        the guidance of a congressional sub-com-
        mittee. No Defense Department agencies
        should be directly involved in the study.

    2.  A national UFO organization should be
        created whose membership is comprised of
        scientists and astronomers with respected
        professional reputations and proven ability

                          104

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        to conduct serious scientific research.

    3.  Ideally, such national organization
        would divide the United States into re-
        gions or sections. Each area should
        maintain transportation which would be
        available whenever needed to investigate
        UFO sightings and landings within a few
        hours of their occurrence.

    4.  Such a national UFO organization should
        cooperate and exchange information with
        scientists and astronomers throughout the
        world, as well as with private agencies
        such as Dr. J. Allen Hynek' s Center for
        UFO Studies.

   5.  The Project Blue Book files at Maxwell AFB
       should be completely catalogued, system-
       atized, and computerized. This effort
       should be accomplished by the new research
       group as a method of familiarizing them
       with the total past history of government
       research in this area.

   After more than a quarter of a century of evasion,
procrastination, and unsatisfactory explanations by the
Air Force, the American public has a right to demand and
receive an unbiased, scientific UFO investigation. The
writers feel that such an investigation conducted by
an organization comprised of prominent scientists and
astronomers free from political influence is an idea
whose time has arrived.

    can be located in the Project Blue Book files at
    the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center,
    Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama. In
    order to locate the desired file, one must ask for
    the material by name, date, and location of sight-
