                  THE PHENOMENON "CHUPA-CHUPA" IN AMAZONIA.

     In Amazonia, UFOs are called "aparelhos" [machines] by victims and the
     violence by these extraterrestrials, principally in their attacks on
     women, have characterized an odd phenomenon: "Chupa-Chupa." [Suck-Suck]

INTRODUCTION ---    In the decade of the 70s, strange phenomena began to
occur on the coast and interior of the states of Para' and Maranha~o. News
came from all parts and the depositions were unanimous: mysterious light
beams, projected from unidentified flying objects, which in the majority of
cases appeared at night, burning men and women. Chasing people, taking blood
from its victims, originating the expression "CHUPA-CHUPA," a name by which
the phenomenon became popularly known. In other regions, principally in
Maranha~o, the phenomenon became known by the name "APARELHO."

     The phenomenon, in spite of a long hatching period, manifested itself
with such force and consistency never before seen in the history of the
national Ufology. In a few short weeks, the news ran throughout the entire
States of Para' and Maranha~o, taking the population by surprise, generating
a climate of terror and collective panic. Motivated by curiosity and with the
objective to shed light on the Chupa-Chupa mystery, we undertook a research
which took us to several counties of Para'. We entertained but, due to our
modest financial resources, and available time, it was not possible for us to
cover all of Para' and Maranha~o. We hope that in the near future someone
will be able to complete this research.

     What we will be exposing in this article won't consist of fables created
by backwoodsmen or diverse residents of the interior and coast of Para'. We
will be faithful to the facts and rendered depositions. Each interview was
taken with attention and care. This way, we selected the most coherent
reports, whose relationships with other depositions, added to the competence
of the testimonials, constituted bearing elements. The objective of this work
is to trace a real picture and an historical outline of one of the most
impressive ufological manifestations which we could know.

NEWSPAPER ANNOUNCEMENTS ---   The first part of this research constitutes a
bibliographical survey of all articles and reports published in the
periodicals of Para' such as A PROVINCIA DO PARA', O LIBERAL, and ESTADO DO
PARA'. However, the same was not possible, for the reasons previously
described, with the press of Maranha~o. We read all the articles of the cited
periodicals and feel that the press of Para' related in a very interesting
form the development of the Chupa-Chupa phenomenon. All of the articles were
heavily illustrated and taken at the locations of incidence, together with
the testimonials... If today we are able to reconstitute this ufological
wave, it is due to the press and the care of the Public Library of Bele'm.

     Several ufological news forecasted the Chupa-Chupa wave, but the most
significant article was in O LIBERAL, 7-16-77, where we read:

          "The UFO photographed in Montevideo, spherical shape, compares in
          detail with the strange objects seen at several locations in Para',
          along the Maranha~o side of the Gurupi River and along the entire
          Para'-Maranha~o border. Just yesterday, these objects were observed
          at several locations in the interior of Maranha~o, frightening the
          population, similar to what occurs in the area of Vizeu in Para'."

     A few days before, precisely on 7-12-77, the JORNAL DA BAHIA reported in
a clear manner what would become the phenomenon Chupa-Chupa:

          "Flying object which emits fantastic light frightens Para': Bele'm
          (AJB) --- A fantastic story of a flying object emitting a strong
          light and sucking blood from people, circulated from mouth to mouth
          among the population of the counties of Braganca, Vizeu and Augusto
          Correa in Para', where many people fear leaving their homes during
          the night so they won't get caught by the vampire-like light from
          the strange object which, according to information, already has
          caused the death of two men. No one knows how the story started,
          but the truth is that it reached Bele'm and grabbed headlines in
          the local newspapers."


     Months later, on October 8, O LIBERAL launched the first in a series of
reports, giving the population knowledge of what was the Chupa-Chupa
phenomenon. The report begins in a taxing manner:

          "Sucking animal attacks men and women in the village of Vigia: A
          strange phenomenon has been occurring for several weeks in the
          village of Vigia, more exactly in the Vila Santo Antonio do
          Imbituba about 7 kilometers from highway PA-140, with the
          appearance of an object which focus a white light over people,
          immobilizing them for around an hour, and sucks the breasts of the
          women leaving them bleeding. The object, known by the locals as
          "Bicho Voador" [Flying Animal], or "Bicho Sugador" [Sucking
          Animal], has the shape of a rounded ship and attacks people
          (principally women) in isolation, in spite of it also having
          attacked some men... One of the victims, among many in the area,
          was Mrs. Rosita Ferreira, married, 46 years old, resident of Ramal
          do Triunfo, who a few days ago was sucked by the light on the left
          breast, and passed out. Increasingly it looked like dealing with a
          nightmare, feeling as if there were some claws trying to hold her.
          She was attacked around 3:30 in the morning. Another victim was the
          lady known as "Chiquita," who was also sucked by the strange object
          with her breast becoming bloody, but without leaving any marks."
       
CHUPA-CHUPA ---     It was then on 10-16-77, that O LIBERAL launched for the
first time the expression "Chupa-Chupa," as we read in the first paragraph of
this report:

          "Chupa-Chupa: That was the denomination given by the population of
          Vigia to an unidentified flying object, which has brought to panic
          the dwellers of Imbituba, Camaru and Km-25, as well as other
          localities situated in the vicinity of those cities." 

     Henceforth, until the end of mid-november 1977, the newspapers of Para'
did not seize to bring to the public articles on the Chupa-chupa. The
newspaper A PROVINCIA DO PARA' brought, on 10-20-77, 11-19-77 and 11-20-77,
valuable reports for ufological investigation. On October 20 there were two
full pages with popular depositions, graphics of UFO evolution in the skies
of Vigia and the strange CI 2 [Hynek's CE-I] occurrence with colonist Manoel
Matos de Souza (known by Coronha), registered in the small village of Monte
Serrado, county of Santo Antonio de Taua' (PA). This farmer, 44 years old,
was awaken around 2 to 3 am by a strong light which circled his area and
penetrated his shack. On opening the door, he met with a flying object with
two creatures in its interior. He returned to this room, and now armed with
ammunition, he tried to fire in the vehicle's direction. To his surprise, the
weapon did not fire and, feeling paralysis overcoming his body by the light
from the UFO, screamed for help.

     On 11-19-77, A PROVINCIA DO PARA' published, for the first time,
photographs of possible lesions of chupa-chupa, registered on the young
Aurora Nascimento Fernandes, 18 years old, resident at Passagem Tabatinga, in
the Jurunas neighborhood (Bele'm). Aurora found herself washing dishes around
9 p.m. on 11-18-77 in her home when a strong gush of cold air surprised her
in conjunction with a strong, reddish light. The young lady relates:

          "I became frightened. I called my mother and before she arrived, a
          strong red light enveloped me, making me dazed. At the same time,
          I felt really fine piercings striking my breast, and fell to the
          floor fainted."

Afterwards, Dr. Orlando Zoghbi, after seeing the patient, framed the fact as
an episode of hysteria and panic produced by the collective psychosis around
the Chupa-chupa phenomenon. According to Dr. Zoghbi by the configuration of
the marks, the wounds present on Aurora's right breast were caused by the
contraction of her hands clutching (over the breast), in an instinctive act
of protection at the possible Chupa-chupa attack. We loudly disagree, because
the same appeared to be concentrated and deep (like biopsies) within a small
area; no traces of scratches and the wounds did not possess a fingernail
configuration.

     In conversation with UFO phenomenon researcher and student, Professor
Fabio Zerpa (ONIFE)1, he observed similar facts, ahead of the described
picture by Aurora and other women of Para' who said they were Chupa-chupa
victims, occurring in southern Argentina in the 70s where one women was
attacked by an entity which took blood. It is interesting to note that the
described events occurred in cities and villages in proximity to rivers,
lakes or seas. This makes us recall the Japanese mythological entities called
the "kappas" which, according to legend, came from a distant star and
populated the rivers (or seas) of Japan. Researchers Scornaux and Piens, in
their excellent work "A Descoberta dos OVNIs" [The Discovery of UFOs],
relate: 
      
          " Kappas appear to use a submarine, or something of the like,
          provisioned with a respiratory device as well as some strange
          helmet with antennas. The ears are abnormally large. The skin is
          copper-colored (see the men of bronze who appeared at the Utinga
          reservoir, county of Bele'm, during the Chupa-chupa period) and the
          hands and feet are hook-like. This description reminds us of some
          humanoid ETs observed in our day, and the reputation which the
          Kappas had, of making ill the people who came in proximity to them,
          makes us think of the physiological effects experimented on some
          current witnesses."

THE PHENOMENON IN COLARES --- The island of Colares is located around 70
kilometers northeast the city of Bele'm. It bounds the county of Vigia,
another region rich in apparitions and ufological cases. To its front is the
Bay of Marajo~ which finds itself separated from the continent by the river
Guajara'-Mirim. Colares comprises an area 600 square kilometers,
approximately, and harbors several communities, such as Vila de Colares (the
county seat), Fazenda, Mocajatuba, Ariri and others. Its population, in great
part, is dedicated to fishing and agriculture.

     During the Chupa-chupa period, Colares was the target of intense UFO
apparitions and several victims of the mysterious rays were detected. The
fear was so much that a good part of the island residents abandoned their
homes and temporarily went to reside with their parents in other counties.

     CIPEX2 located several witnesses to the phenomenon during the days which
it stayed in Colares. We look at a few cases:

          (a) Jonas Ferreira Gondim, 60 years old, a married fisherman,
          confesses that in that time his house was illuminated by the Chupa
          light. Taken with courage, he went outside to the yard and fired a
          June firecracker to scare away the "aparelho." His son, Cla'udio
          Gondin, related to us: "During that time, we did not sleep right.
          I and some other colleagues went out for vigils at the home of
          friends. One night, I saw that machine over the treetops, there on
          S. Joa~o street. It suddenly stopped and emitted a clear light on
          top of the trees and right away climbed at great velocity towards
          another side of the village."

          (b) Mr. Zacarias dos Santos Barata, 74 years old, married,
          confesses: "I saw this machine around two times. The first time, it
          came from the direction of Soure' (Marajo' Island) and cruised the
          village really fast. On the other time, I saw here from the house
          when a luminous ball came lighting up all of the Luzio countryside.
          It wasn't making any noise and it was not enough to see how it was
          correctly, for the light was very strong and of a bluish color."
          The same was observed by his neighbor, Ju'lio de Brito Correia, 70
          years old, adding solely that the ship flew low and at great speed.

          (c) The carpenter Carlos Cardoso de Paula, 45 years old, married,
          describes two curious events. We see: "In the time of the Chupa,
          many times I left at night to visit the homes of friends and
          colleagues. The majority of them would meet on the street making a
          bonfire and frying fish. Once in a while, they would make noise
          with guns and cans to scare the Chupa... One time, at leaving the
          house around 21:00 hours, we heard the people yell: "There goes the
          chupa"; here from the house I only saw when a ball of fire came
          running in our direction, but soon it changed headings, entering
          into another street. A strange thing occurred another time, second
          account: "We were all asleep in the house and I was still smoking
          the last cigarette when all of a sudden, through the house's roof
          ridge, entered a small ball of fire. That thing started to ride
          around the room until it came next to my hammock. It climbed up my
          right leg up to the knee. I regarded all of this with much
          curiosity when that small ball passed to the other leg and I
          started to feel weak and sleepy. The cigarette fell from my hand
          and, scared of that situation, I screamed. The small ball
          disappeared and everyone woke up. I think it was looking for a vein
          in my body, but it didn't have any luck... When it would increase
          in brightness, I would feel a kind of heat..."

PROBES ---     The account of Mr. Carlos de Paula, besides the bizarre,
indicates to us that that small ball, in reality, could be a matter of a
probe, for the described characteristics by the witness so indicate. During
our research, we located two people in the Vila de Colares who were victims
of the Chupa-chupa. The clinical picture of this phenomenon will be better
detailed with the description of the accounts which we gathered there.

     The first one was of the merchant Neuton de Oliveira Cardoso, 27 years
old, married and who, at the time, resided in the Vila de Mocajatuba. One
night, he woke up ill, feeling a "heat" throughout the body and, frightened,
noticed that he was burned to the height of the neck on the left side. Family
members took him on the following day to the Vila dos Colares for the medical
appointment owed. Neuton comments: "I became very weak and without courage
during various days and still feel a strong torture and headache." The second
victim was Mrs. Claudomira Rogrigues da Paixa~o, 43 years old, married,
popularly known as "Mirota." She was hit in the breast by the Chupa-chupa
light, when still sleeping at her parent's house. It was around midnight and
she slept in the hammock next to the window when she was surprised by an
intense glare; quickly, she felt a heat over the body that paralyzed her,
when then a focused beam of greenish light was projected over her torax,
being right away withdrawn. But it was late and mirota already had burns
present on the left breast. 

     During several days, she felt a great weakness and strong headaches
which occasionally still return to bother her. Later, she was lead to the
Instituto Medico Legal Renato Chaves (Bele'm) for complimentary exams. Years
ago, inclusive, she had the visit of two foreign researchers who arrived
together with an interpreter at the island in a single-engine plane. Mrs.
Claudomira certifies: "During the instant the fire struck me, I felt holes
like from needles over my chest. Later, I did not feel any pain, unless
headaches and a great laziness which kept me in the hammock for several
days..."

SECRET ACCOUNTS ---  At the start of the rumors of curious ufological
apparitions in the interior of Para' and in Maranha~o, increased by the panic
of the population about the phenomenon, the 1st Regional Aerial Command (1st
COMAR)3, located in Bele'm, activated an exhaustive field operation with the
intent of clearing up the Chupa-chupa phenomenon enigma. The command's order
was the following:

     1) The UFO phenomenon merits a deep and objective study;
     2) All relevant information on the phenomenon needs to be gathered;
     3) Public announcements and commentary about the subject needs to be
     avoided.
     
     During the time, the Air Force sent researchers to several counties
where the presence of UFOs were detected, in such a way that hundreds of
reports of the first and second degrees and around 200 photographs of strange
objects, UFOs, were gathered. The most rich locations were Baia do Sol (Ilha
de Mosqueiro) and the Ilha de Colares (Para'). In these regions several UFO
photographs were obtained, mostly nocturnal, and still some films of short
duration registering the ship's evolution.

     The majority of the photographs were taken with professional cameras
(Cannon, Nikon) coupled and tele-aimed, utilizing Kodak 1000 ASA film, black
and white, with the equipment belonging to the military. At the end of the
field investigation, the second phase of the operation was initiated which
included the elaboration of a report and analysis of the recognized data.
This report, around 500 pages including photographs of UFOs, drawings, maps,
records of interviews and clippings of local newspapers, was sent to the
military high command (EMFA), together with all the existing photographic
documentation (films, negatives, photograph copies).

     The obtained results of this far away work points that the Chupa-Chupa
phenomenon was general and of ufological nature, being difficult to specify
with objectivity the origin and purpose of the same.

EVIDENCE ---   In a ufological research, it is not sufficient to gather and
archive cases. It is necessary to test them, compare them with others and
submit them to several criticisms (both internally and externally).

     The climate that the 1977 Para' wave generated in the breast of the
population is complex and rich in data; all of society's sectors were hit and
the divulged opinions are the most diverse possible. The press effected an
excellent job, maybe addressing, as it allowed itself by one side, by the
skepticism of the high domes; and, on the other side, by the inexperience of
the ufological camp. However, these small flaws are understandable and
natural. But, the same judgment is not valid when we denounce the scientific,
political and military community's position which still insists in hiding
themselves under old anti-ufological pretexts. This omission was expected,
being in part deliberate.

     Tactics of this nature are well recognized among researchers and
publicists of the UFO reality. Not withstanding or missing were the Air Force
secret research, the ridicule, the "prophets" announcing the arrival of the
martians and still the confusion tactic with the prejudiced affirmations of
some liberal professionals with their "famous" convenient explanations.

CONCLUSIONS ---     This research, despite its limitations, allowed us an
adequate sampling of the 70s ufological wave in Para'. We emphasize some
points:

     1) The zone of action was the north of Brazil, being frequent the
     sightings on the edges of rivers and of the Atlantic Ocean;

     2) The UFOs surfaced, in the majority of times, at night, being rare the
     sightings during the day;

     3) The depositions confirm the presence of ships - not always coming
     from high and disappearing in the sky;
     
     4) Whatever the small ships, everything indicates they were about
     probes, due to their aerodynamic and behavioral profile, such as round
     extremely luminous objects, rapid movements, low altitude flying,
     emission of luminous beams and chasing people;

     5) The burns produced by the UFOs were not accidental, but demonstrated
     an objective. Men and women were the aim, preferably targeted when they
     slept;

     6) There is no complete proof that the UFOs removed blood from their
     victims; on the other hand, the biochemical and clinical exams performed
     by Dr. Wellaide C.C. de Oliveira attest to the lower number of
     hemoglobin in the hemogram from the victims, besides the quite peculiar
     clinical picture of people who have lost considerable blood (fainting,
     chronic headaches, body weaknesses, preventing the victims from standing
     on their feet) including the presence of diminutive "prick marks" in the
     regions hit by the beams from the UFOs;

     7) Informational references about the occupants of the ships were few,
     but they point to the presence of beings of below/medium stature,
     greenish and wrinkled skin;

     8) There is a specific objective of great importance which precipitated
     the UFOs invasion of coastal Para' and Maranha~o.

     Everything leads to believe that the global phenomenon was a mission of
great scope, not only by the frequency of sightings, but by the great number
of sighted objects. The zones incidental were chosen due to their strategic
positions and by the security which they gave to the action of the UFOs
(geographic isolation, far apart and small population centers). The objective
of that invasion was related (possibly) with the research and biological
manipulation on man on the part of the aliens, whose purpose in the mean time
we are unable to elucidate.
