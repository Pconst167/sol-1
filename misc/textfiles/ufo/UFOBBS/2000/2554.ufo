           MISSING EMBRYO/FETUS SYNDROME:  A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS 

Introduction:

     Over the past several years there have been many female abductees who 
are complaining of alleged missing pregnancy.  They are relating this to an
humanoid-alien intervention.   

The "abduction scenario" is a bizarre aspect of the UFO phenomena;it becomes
even more bizarre when we check and see that  there is no existing data
available to researchers on these occurrences. Are we on the verge of breaking
new ground  with this segment of the UFO phenomenon and/or is this so deeply
embedded into the some women's subconscious that we have yet developed a
technique to extrapolate this information for further collaboration?

     Many researchers have claimed that they have several cases of Missing
Embryo/Fetus Syndrome (ME/FS) in their files.  Yet
during my research over the past three years into this particular phenomena,
all have failed to produce even one verified case. The question is why?
  
     Are these female abductees really undergoing a missing pregnancy,
allegedly perpetrated by alien beings, or is this a problem that could be
explained as a complication of pregnancy in the field of Obstetrics.  Is it
possible that we are looking at a form of hysteria associated with the
abduction syndrome that leads to amenorrhea (temporary cessation of menstrual
cycle) secondary to a post-traumatic experience.  Perhaps this is a new
psychological manifestation of a post-traumatic experience with interwoven
aspects of the Old Hag Theory.

     I have researched the literature to see if any similar cases were
documented in the past.  I will also present certain medical information that
could lead to criteria review guidelines which are essential in the
documentation of a potential ME/FS.  This article will attempt to explain why
varification of none of these cases are forthcoming and point out the constant
frustration in seeking specific information from females abductees in order to
substantiate their claims.

Definition of Missing Embryo/Fetus Syndrome

     Particular female abductees allege that a pregnancy usually between 6
weeks to 12 weeks (1 1/2 - 3 months) is missing due to purported alien
intervention.  Although the distinction between embryo and fetus is essentially
arbitrary, it is customary to refer to the human conceptus, from fertilization
through the first 8 weeks of development, as an embryo, and from 8 weeks 
after ovulation until term, as a fetus.

Typical Scenario

     Female abductee experiences a nocturnal visitation in which she is taken
from her bedroom to a waiting craft-type object, either landed or hovering
slightly above the ground or some surroundings not familiar to her.  These
individuals are taken into what appears to be some type of examination room in
which they  are placed on a table.  Abductees report they are usually
administered some form of anesthesia either through the touching of an
instrument to the head, alien hands applied to the temporal area,telepathically
told to relax and that it would not hurt or given some form of liquid for oral
intake obstensibly to alleviate apprehension.  Most report some type of
quasi-gynecological exam;however, they are unsure if any instruments are being
placed into the vagina.  A long needle inserted into the umbilical area is
widely reported by these individuals.  Its purpose is unknown, but speculation
could point to a mini-laparoscopy in which there may be extraction of ova from
the ovary or a procedure known as G I F T (Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer)
which in the field of obstetrics and reproductive medicine treats infertility
by placing sperm and oocytes directly into the infertile woman's fallopian
tubes for in vivo fertilization.

Past History Literature/Correspondence

     Early literature does not point to any similarity of ME/FS;however, the
Old Hag Theory has experienced some form of sexual activity, but mostly it
resembles the well-known nocturnal visitation.  The Old Hag Theory or the
experience of being hagged as found in Newfoundland tradition has been
summarized as follows:   

1) Awakening (or an experience immediately preceding sleep). 2) Hearing and/or
seeing something come into the room and approach the bed.
3) Being pressed on the chest or strangled.
4) Inability to move or cry out until either being brought out of the
state by someone else or breaking through the feeling of paralysis on
one's own.

     There have been some sexual connotations from this, but it is very rare
and debatable between some of the top experts in the field.  In his book "The
Terror that Comes in the Night,"   David J. Hufford reveals that through his
research, and I quote, "The presence of overt sexual content as a frequent
feature of  the nightmare probably is also highly debatable.  I have
encountered a few explicit sexual details in Old Hag accounts, but these are
rare and are not typically major components of a given experience.  Some
overtly sexual accounts have appeared in the  course of my
investigation, but these differed from the Old Hag in that they have lacked the
paralysis feature and, in several cases, fear. These probably constitute either
a distinct subtype of the experience or a different phenomenon altogether."

     John Keel's 1970 book, Strange Creatures from Space and Time,included a
chapter entitled, "The Bedroom Invaders," writes, and I quote, " In the past
three years we have published two popular magazine articles on these bedroom
invaders, and we  were amazed by the amount of mail thoses pieces drew.  Many 
readers wrote to tell us, sometimes in absorbing detail, of their own
experiences with this uncanny phenomenon.  In most cases these experiences were
not repetitive.  They happened only once and were not accompanied by any other
manifestations.  In several cases the witnesses
experienced total paralysis of the body.  The witness awoke but was unable to
move a muscle while the apparition was present."

     In corresponding with Dr. Eddie Bullard, and I quote, "Regarding the
"Missing Embryo/Fetus Syndrome," I'm afraid that I have little to say.  This
element did not appear in any of the abduction stories I studied.  A 
preoccupation with reproduction is a common theme from the earliest abductions 
onward, and a few stories describe rape,sexual activity, and events that might 
be described as artificial insemination or tampering with a pregnancy already 
underway, but I noticed nothing in the literature (up to 1986 or there abouts) 
comparable to the missing embryo  motif. [underlined by author]" Bullard had 
related that he could not say anything with certainty and feels this 
phenomenon in question must await further evidence.

     Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, who could be credited for doing hypnotic regression
sessions in well over 300 individuals and is considered one of the early
pioneers in research of the abduction phenomena,made several interesting
statements, and I quote, "In the 70's, I talked with perhaps a dozen women who
describe unusual menstrual discharge and/or changes in cycles.  However, I have
no medical information."  Also he mentions, "In a few instances, women wrote to
me about strange "dreams" of sexual activity with aliens, then describing
pregnancies that resulted in birth of babies with "big eyes" and great psychic
abilities." Where are the photographs of these kids or evidence that they  have
psychic components?  I was given the name of a physician to write to who has
allegedly worked with women who gave birth to "Space Kids."  It has been well
over six months since I corresponded with this individual; needless to say I am
extremely skeptical of such claims and the authenticity of his research.
Finally Dr. Sprinkle mentions, "However, I have not yet worked with a woman who
claims an interrupted pregnancy and an awareness of the child. [underlined by
author]".

     The first case of ME/FS appears in Budd Hopkins book, Intruders:  The
Incredible Visitation at Copley Woods involve witness Debbie Tomey (aka "Kathie
Davis").  Debbie is quite convinced that her abduction experience occured as
she describes it.  I have met and corresponded with Debbie on numerous
occasions and feel that she is a very sincere and down to earth type individual
and would have no reason to fabricate such a story.

     I have personally researched three cases in Southern California; however,
each one can be explained as a complication from pregnancy not associated with
any alien intervention.  When questioning the female abductee one of the first
questions asked is, "If you were indeed pregnant, was this from your male
companion (husband or male partner)?"  If not, the next question is, "Why do
they think it may be related to an alien impregnation?"
     What really bothers me about this alien impregnation is  this: How does
the female abductee think she became pregnant? Was it with direct sexual
activity with an alien being or unknown to her?  Alleged Pathology reports of
the alien beings showed no evidence of external genitalia.  Len Stringfield, in
his paper, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome - Status Report II,  describes the
body of an alien being (grey alien) as given to him by
an anonymous individual that had first hand knowledge of this. I quote, "No
apparent reproductive organs.  Perhaps atrophied by evolution degeneration.  No
genitalia.  In my non-professional judgement, the absence of sexual organs
suggest that some of the aliens, and perhaps all, do not produce as do the homo
sapiens, or that some of the bodies studied are produced perhaps by a system of
cloning or other unknown means."

     Certainly the so called "greys" are not the culprits, particularly if you
are relating this to direct sexual activity.  If there is indeed alien
spermatozoa, where does it come from?  If we are taking into consideration that
some form of sexual activity,genetic manipulation and/or reproductive research
is being conducted, could it be that another alien species working with the 
greys are responsible or guardians of this reproductive research studies on 
female abductees.  Using your own creative imagination you can develop your 
own hypothetical scenario as to  how the victim/abductee relates to this
"immaculate conception" from alien intervention.

Rape/Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome to Female Victims/Abductees   

  Although this aspect has not been brought up with female victims/abductees, I
feel it is an issue that needs to be address-ed in regards to sexual activity
and ME/FS.  We have to face facts or speculate as to whether a sexual
molestation or rape has occurred.  All of this intervention has allegedly
happened without the consent of the female, and she experiences fear, pain,
humilation and is powerless to protect herself.  In this country only two out
of every ten victims of sexual assault report this incident to the proper
authorities.

     In setting up a hypothetical situation involving female victims/abductees
we could consider the following:  Who will the victims/abductees report their
sexual assault to?  It is difficult in itself for females to report this
experience period. When there is the potential of an extraterrestial or unknown
factor brought into play, the magnitude of this even becomes  greater.

     Obtaining a history of the event is necessary, but asking questions may be
interpreted as a further invasion of the victim's privacy.  Some victims may
welcome the opportunity to ventilate their feelings and may express relief at
having someone willing to listen, while others may resist answering questions.
Pressuring them to talk may add to their trauma.  Both responses
are normal and should be respected.  The latter group could be associated with
the female abductees who chose not to reveal this deep dark secret.  Perhaps
some of these females may have a suppressed sexual child abuse history that
has not been explored.    Let us assume for this article that the
victim/abductee has been raped by an alien or non-humanoid being.  Burgess and
Holmstrom have labeled the victim's reaction to rape the Rape Trauma
Syndrome.  They describe the following two stages: (1) the acute phase
(disorganization); and (2) the long term process (reorgan-ization).  The acute
phase lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Initially, in the immediate impact
reaction of the acute phase, the victim may display and feel a wide range of
emotions, including shock and disbelief.  Victims may either react in an
expressed style, demonstrating anger, fear and anxiety, or in a controlled
style, masking their feelings and appearing composed or subdued. A victim's
outward behavior may not reflect the  degree or nature of the emotional crisis
she is experiencing.

     Many rape victims may suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder.  This
is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -
III) as the development of characteristics symptoms after experiencing of a
psychologically traumatic event or events outside the range of human experience
usually considered to be normal.  The characteristic symptoms involve
reexperiencing the traumatic event, numbing of responsiveness to, or
involvement with, the external world, and a variety of other autonomic
dysphoric, or cognitive symptoms.  The diagnostic criteria for this disorder is
listed under Table I.

Table I. -Diagnostic Criteria for Post-traumatic Stress           Disorder

Existence of a recognizable stressor that would evoke significant symptoms
of distress in almost everyone.  Reexperiencing of the trauma as evidenced by 
at least one of the following:

Recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event.       

Recurrent dreams of the event.

Sudden acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring,
becuase of an association with an environmental or ideational
stimulus.

Numbing of responsiveness to, or reduced involvement with, the external
world, beginning some time after the trauma, as shown by at least one 
of the following:

Markedly diminished interest in one or more significant activities.

Feeling of detachment or estrangement from others:  Constricted affect.

At least two of the following symptoms that were not present before
the trauma:
          
Hyperalertness or exaggerated startle response.

Sleep disturbances.

Guilt about surviving when others have not, or about    
behavior required for survival.

Memory impairment or trouble concentrating.

Avoidance of activities that arouse recollection of the 
traumatic event.

Intensification of symptoms by exposure to events that  
symbolize or resemble the traumatic event.

     The rape victim is particularly vulnerable to manifesting this disorder
because of the following characteristics of the  rape: (1) it is sudden, and
the victim is unable to develop adequate defenses; (2) it involves intentional 
cruelty as inhumanity; (3) it makes the victim feel trapped and unable to 
fight  back; and (4) it often involves physical injury.

     Female victims/abductees will ignore discussing the sexual encounters with
reserchers possibly because of rejection, embarrassment, fear and guilt.  They
will, however, share their experience with other abductees or
writer-researchers in the UFO community that have had National Exposure and
could perhaps understand their plight.
