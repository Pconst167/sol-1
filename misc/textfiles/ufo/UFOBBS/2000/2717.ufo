SUBJECT: LAZAR'S CREDIBILITY DAMAGED                         FILE: UFO2717




    
    June 7, 1990 
    
    Recently  ParaNet  received a call from Gene Huff,   Las  Vegas  real 
    estate  appraiser and close friend of Robert Lazar,  stating that  he 
    wished  to place a clarification on ParaNet for the record  regarding 
    Lazar's  recent  felony  indictment on a count of  Pandering  in  Las 
    Vegas,  Nevada by the Clark County Sheriff's Department. Lazar,  in a 
    public statement made on KLAS-TV in April,  admittedly told on camera 
    that  he  had  been involved in a brothel in the Las  Vegas  area  by 
    assisting  in  the installation of computer and  security  equipment. 
    Shortly  after  that,   following an  investigation  by  authorities, 
    charges were brought against Lazar.  He could get up to five years if 
    convicted. 

    The big question now is:  Does this damage Lazar's credibility  along 
    with  KLAS-TV  reporter George Knapp,  who featured Lazar on  a  news 
    special  in November 1989?  According to Huff and the statement  that 
    follows, the answer is a big no. 

    What has further clouded the issue has been Bill Cooper's attacks  on  
    Lazar  and  Knapp  for  their  participation  in  what  Cooper  calls 
    "government  disinformation  activity."  Cooper,  a  self-styled  UFO 
    "guru"   who claims to have seen super-secret UFO documents aboard  a 
    Navy  ship  while  enlisted in the early  1970s,   has  made  various 
    statements  about  Lazar,   Lear,   Knapp and a  host  of  other  UFO 
    researchers  being  government  agents  intent  on  disinforming  the 
    public. 

    The following is a letter received via ParaFAX on June 4,  1990  from 
    Gene Huff. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, 

      I  am a Las Vegas real estate appraiser and I have known Bob  Lazar 
    since  late 1985,  John Lear since mid-1988,  and George Knapp  since 
    early 1989.  I  thought some of the members of your service [ParaNet] 
    might  need some actual FACTS regarding some of the  accusations  and 
    allegations  made  by Milton W.  Cooper.  I've written the  following 
    pages which you may use, if you choose to do so. 

    MILTON W. COOPER IS A LIAR. Period. 

      So Cooper learned poker from granny and love from Annie,  huh?  Too 
    bad  he didn't learn anything from George Washington and  the  cherry 
    tree  briefing.   The  actual story of  the  "Bob  Lazar-prostitution 
    connection" is as follows: Bob Lazar and his late first wife,  Carol, 
    owned a legal brothel in northern Nevada during the early 1980's,  so 
    Bob was familiar with the brothel business.  Recently,  he ran into a 
    hooker  who was running a small brothel here in Las Vegas.  Bob  gave 
    her  a bunch of ideas on how she could efficiently run her  business. 
    She  asked  him  to  help  her and said she would  pay  him  for  his 
    consultation.   I  guess this kind of parallels  attorneys  receiving 
    their  fees  from clients with questionable vocations,  but  I  won't 
    argue that point here. He helped her by installing a computer,  doing 
    some  computer programming,  accounting,  installing security cameras 
    and monitors, etc. When all of the systems were running smoothly, Bob 
    was  going  to  leave  as  he felt  he  had  already  received  money 
    commensurate  with what he felt he had contributed.  She offered  him 
    money just to stay around and do nothing,  which seemed strange,  but 
    Bob  was  going to part ways anyway,  and the worst thing that  could 
    have happened,  happened.  this hooker had fallen madly in love  with 
    Bob. In a serious talk, she made her feelings known to him. She asked 
    how  sexually  attractive  she  was to him on a scale from 1 to   10.   
    Bob  "Mr.  Compassion" Lazar told her that, to him, she was a 1.  She  
    cried for a day and a half. 
    
      This   news  was impossible to take for a woman who  had  for years  
    had  men calling her on a daily basis offering to  pay  her money  to 
    have sex with her.   As it ends up, she is a  Las  Vegas Metro  Vice, 
    FBI,  and DEA informant.  Now she has implicated  him as  being  much 
    more  involved than he actually was,   for  obvious motives.   He has 
    not yet been charged,  but with her  connections,  it appears certain 
    that he will be.   this was all exposed by  Bob Lazar  ON  TELEVISION  
    here  in  Las  Vegas.   This  required  no investigation by Cooper or 
    the knuckleheads from vice.  There  is much  more to this story which 
    is better saved until Bob  Lazar's freedom is certain. 
    
      The story of Bob Lazar running a drug lab is totally  false.  He is 
    currently doing some research at a small,  privately  funded lab here 
    in Las Vegas.   The lab was recently randomly visited  by one  active 
    duty Las Vegas cop, and another ex-Las Vegas cop  who both  witnessed  
    that   nothing illegal or as  ludicrous  as  drug manufacturing   was  
    going on there.  Naturally,  Sherlock  Cooper didn't know this. 
    
      These    are   just   two   more  classic   examples   of    Cooper 
    misinterpreting an elementary body of information and jumbling it  to  
    fit  his distorted view of the world around him.   This  leaves  only  
    Cooper  to  interpret what is "truth"  while  draped  in  an American  
    flag.     Cooper  labels  his  opponents  as  part  of  a  government  
    band  of conspirators,  which is  anyone  who  doesn't believe   him,  
    disagrees   with   him,   or  actually   knows   and understands  the 
    true  source of his information,  which in turn,  is anyone  who  has  
    ever heard him speak or has read  what  he  has written. 
    
      Cooper   speaks  as though Bob Lazar and John  Lear  are  one item.  
    These  are two separate men with very different ideas.   Bob  Lazar's  
    story  is  not phony,  and he is not part of  a  band  of  government  
    agents.     I   knew him before he met  John  Lear,   and before   he  
    worked at S 4.   I  was with him the first  and  second times he  met 
    Lear  and they had no prior contact before that.    As far as one  of 
    them working for the other, what a joke. 
    
      I  was  present at both of Bob Lazar's  polygraph  sessions.  These  
    were  prior  to George Knapp's November 1989   special.    the  first  
    night   included  two polygraphs with  the  same  identical questions  
    being  asked both times.   He passed one and failed  on.  This is why 
    the  results  were considered inconclusive by the  first  polygrapher   
    and   subsequent  tests  were  suggested   BY   THE POLYGRAPHER.  The 
    second  test  was done at a completely  different company,   about  a 
    month  later.   Similar,  but different  questions were asked and Bob 
    Lazar  passed.    The polygraphs from the  second  night   were  then 
    reviewed by another polygrapher who also  agreed that  he had passed.  
    The  polygraphs  from the second  night  were then sent  to  a  third 
    polygrapher in San Francisco, who was of the opinion that the Federal 
    government  wouldn't lie about  something like this,  and he said  he 
    thought the results were  inconclusive. So  to be fair,  George Knapp 
    said  the results were  inconclusive.  Actually,   four  polygraphers 
    reviewed the two night's tests.    One polygrapher  stated  the first 
    night's tests  were  inconclusive.  Two  polygraphers  stated that he 
    had  passed the  second  night's tests,  and one polygrapher  thought 
    the  second night's tests  were inconclusive.    This  doesn't  sound 
    like as big of a  failure  as Cooper makes it, does it? 
    
      The  problem with Cooper's polygraph challenge is  two-fold. First,  
    one   of those challenged want to  associate  publicly  or  privately  
    with Cooper.   Second,  when someone  actually  believes their  lies,  
    they register as truth on the  polygraph.   So  for obvious  reasons,  
    there  is  nothing  to  be  gained  by   those challenged.   Although 
    you must admit, Cooper and a polygraph  is an amusing thought. 
    
      Bob   Lazar does NOT develop dosimeter badges at  Los   Alamos  and  
    Sandia  labs.   He manufactures and repairs  alpha  radiation probes.   
    He  even  owns  a patent on one particular kind.   Even   an  amateur 
    sleuth like Cooper could have access to that information. 
    
      Cooper  is on the record on the Billy Goodman show as stating  that  
    he   checked  Bob Lazar out,  and that  what  Bob  Lazar  was stating  
    was  true.   (Not  that  Bob  Lazar  cared  what  Cooper thought.)  I 
    guess Cooper has a lot of trouble with these  sudden changes of mind. 
    
      Cooper   overstated his exposure to Bob Lazar via John  Lear.   Bob 
    met Cooper twice at Lear's house.   Kris,  Bob's sister-in-law,   was  
    with   him  one time,  and they both came home of  the  opinion  that  
    Cooper  was  crazy.   The second time,  I  was  invited  but declined  
    since  it appeared obvious to me that Cooper  had  taken the  Kennedy  
    assassination   information  from   the   film   "Dallas  Revisited,"  
    narrated  by  Lars Hansen,  and I  did  not  want  to associate  with  
    Cooper  in public,  or privately.   Bob went  as  a favor   to   John  
    Lear  and  although  can't  remember  if  anyone accompanied him, his 
    opinion of Cooper didn't change. 
    
      Cooper   acts   as   though   Lear  and   Lazar   were    "leaking" 
    information  to him.  Remember, only recently has  Cooper  become the 
    "World's Leading Authority on UFOs."   Back then he was just a sailor  
    who  said he saw a craft when he was in the Navy,   no  one worthy of 
    "leaking" anything to.  And in reality that's all  that Cooper WASN'T 
    and ISN'T important enough to perform for, even  in a  joking manner.  
    He  shouldn't flatter himself in thinking  that the  government would 
    launch an attack on him.   No one  needs  to discredit Cooper, he has 
    discredited  himself.    Those  groups   that  want   to   march   to 
    Washington to get amnesty for  secret  project participants who  want 
    to speak out, had better not go there  with Cooper.   Anyone that can 
    access the classified library (and there are  thousands  nationwide),  
    knows  that many of  the  dates  and events  Cooper speaks about  are 
    inaccurate.    And  the   events  and dates that  are  accurate  have 
    generally  been stated on the  record by  others BEFORE Cooper is  on 
    the record as having stated  them.  Anyway,   he'd  get  laughed  out  
    of  Washington.    This   Cooper controversy  appears  to pretty much 
    be a regional issue  in  the West  and Southwest U.S.,  thanks to the 
    Billy Goodman  show,  and now Cooper has turned on him, too.  Authors 
    and  researchers  from all over the world have come to Las Vegas  and 
    met Bob Lazar.  The one  common denominator that links all of them is 
    that   they   all know of at least one instance in which  they  don't 
    believe Cooper,  either.    This  list  of people includes,  but   is  
    certainly   not limited  to,   Timothy Goode,  Linda Howe,   Jacques'  
    Vallee',   Budd Hopkins,  Bill Moore, etc.   Incidentally,  Bob Lazar 
    chose  not  to meet  with Bill Moore.   Within the first 15   minutes 
    George  Knapp and  I talked to Moore,  Moore admitted not only  lying 
    and   giving out  disinformation,   he also said that he was the  one  
    who    had  stolen  the  missing  "metal"   from  the  Billy  Meier's  
    investigators.   He  said he had it analyzed and it could  have  been 
    made  here  on Earth.   Since he was a self professed liar and thief,  
    Bob   Lazar declined  to  meet him.   We still wonder why he   didn't  
    let  the stolen  Meier's metal resurface if it was a fake.   Maybe he  
    lied about  that,   too.    Anyway,   it's  a  shame,   because  he's   
    an intelligent man and he could be a positive force. 
    
      Cooper's  claims about Project Excalibur and O.H.  Krill   will  be  
    covered   in an upcoming issue of UFO Magazine so I  won't   go  into 
    that here. 
    
      I have seen polaroid pictures of Falcon and Condor from  the set of 
    the Fox Television Network a couple of years ago.   I  don't know  if  
    their  segments  were taped  or  live,  however,  these pictures were 
    taken  by two guys who had access to the set.   I  did not  recognize 
    either  of  the gentlemen,  but neither was John Lear.   If   someone  
    wanted  to  investigate  whether or not  John  Lear   is  Condor,   I 
    suggest  that someone find out from the producers of the  show   when 
    Falcon and Condor did their segments.  At  that  time,  John Lear was 
    flying  for American Trans Air as an L-1011   captain on  flights  to 
    Hawaii, Germany, etc.   The flight logs  should  at least  be able to 
    narrow down whether Lear was in the air or  for that  matter even  in 
    this country at the time Falcon  and  Condor were present.   Although 
    I  personally find it hard to believe that anyone  would care  enough 
    one  way  or  another to go  through  that  much   trouble.     Since  
    George   Knapp's  May  1990   special  news segments,    Cooper   has  
    been   recorded  on  audio  tape   in   a conversation  with   a  Las 
    Vegas resident as saying that  he's  so pissed that Lear exposed  him 
    as  lying about the O.H.  Krill papers that if Lear were in front  of 
    him right then, he'd "Shoot the son of  a bitch."  Yet through all of 
    Cooper's  attacks on Lear,   Lear still  insists  that  Cooper had an  
    original  contribution.   If that's  true,  it's  unfortunate because 
    it   has   now   been  lost because of Cooper's  subsequent  actions.  
    This is a waste  because even  though  Cooper is an amateurish writer 
    (as am I), he  is  a semi-adequate public speaker who arouses people.  
    If  people  will take  Cooper's advice and read and investigator  for  
    themselves,  I'm sure they'll make their own decisions on Cooper soon 
    enough. 
    
      George   Knapp   was  not  AFRAID to call Cooper   prior   to   his 
    special.     Knapp   had  previously  interviewed  Cooper  and    had 
    apparently heard enough back then.   Cooper got his rightful share of  
    time in both of Knapp's specials.  George Knapp's  career  is not  in  
    danger.     Knapp  knows more about  Lazar  than  does   the  general 
    public,  which includes Cooper.   Knapp is just required to establish  
    Lazar's  credentials before moving on to some  of  the more  exciting  
    subjects Bob Lazar has commented  on.    Hopefully Knapp  will   make  
    his  May 1990  news segments  into  an  expanded special  so  we  can  
    possibly hear some  more  testimony  as  to Cooper's credibility. 
    
      Cooper  has  publicly stated that he will tell his version  of  the 
    show  of force by the gray aliens in central Nevada in 1979   in  his 
    upcoming book.  I  hope it's not the same story Bob Lazar  and I told 
    on the Billy Goodman show in 1989.   I  would hate for  that story to 
    have mysteriously made it from the radio in 1989 all the way  back to 
    the  reports Cooper allegedly read between  1970   and 1973.    After 
    all, this event hadn't even happened yet.  Not  even Cooper could try 
    that, could he? 
    
      Through all of this I have noticed only one solid connection   with  
    Cooper and the Nixon Administration and that is  that  both Milton W. 
    Cooper  and  Richard M.  Nixon both have upper lips   which  perspire 
    profusely when they're lying. 
    
      I  guess  the most amusing thing that has happened in the last  two 
    years is that know Cooper has suddenly become a tough guy,  at  least 
    through  his  eyes.   He calls everyone else wimps,  and liars,   and 
    traitors.    I  and many others are of the opinion that if  they cast  
    for   the part of WIMPY in the broadway version  of  POPEYE,   Cooper 
    would be a lock for the part.  And if indeed  information, not money, 
    is the power of the 90's, Cooper will keep "borrowing" from  everyone  
    involved, but don't worry, he'll gladly  pay  you Tuesday. 
    
      When   all  of  the dust has settled,  I  don't think   Milton   W. 
    Cooper's   nickname will any longer be Bill.   I  think it could   be 
    Willie   or   probably even "Uncle Miltie,"  after all if  the   shoe 
    fits, right?
