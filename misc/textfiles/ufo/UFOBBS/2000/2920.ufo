SUBJECT: COOPER GETS STRANGE PHONE CALLS                     FILE: UFO2920




In the last few days I have received E-mail and phone calls
that are unusual to say the least.  The most significant ones
follow.

(1)  I have received a message via E-MAIL that I believe is
very important.  As I have a policy of never revealing
sources (thats why I have sources) I will not reveal the
identity of the sender.  The following was included in the
message.

"Our goals are more-or-less the same:  An educated public.
Each of us has something of value to contribute.  Each of us
has others cheering us on.  I am sorry that we had to meet
this way."

"I too have been in uniform.  I too have soiled my underwear
in fear.  I never digraced my uniform.  NEVER."

"In time I am sure that we will meet.  You will then see that
my heart was in the right place."

When I received the message of which the above was a part, I
sent a reply.  I asked him to tell me what his interest in
this subject was.  I asked who he worked for, what his job
was, etc.  I told him my address and phone number.  I asked
him to give me any information he might have concerning the
subject of the MAJIC files.  I told him that we all needed to
come together on this.  I then told him that if he were in a
sensitive position and could not furnish any of the info
requested that I would understand.  He sent the following
reply to my message.

"Bill, thank you;  for your kindness and understanding."

"We all need each other.  We cannot stand alone.  Each of us
must contribute to the common-good, so that each of us, and
our species, will survive."

"Thank you,"

(NAME WILL NOT BE GIVEN)


I also received a phone call from this same person.  The call
was was very innocent, HOWEVER, he mentioned several times
that the board and the phone was not the place to talk.  He
mentioned meeting at some later date.  When and where I do
not know.  I did not press him for any info or anything else
as I wish to gain his confidence.

I have no idea if the name he sent the message under is his
real name or not.  I have no idea what he knows if anything.
The messages he left and the phone call are PREGNANT with
possibilities and if he ever contacts me for a meeting I will
meet with him.


(2)  I have received two threatening calls from an unknown
source.  The first call went as follows.

Bill--- Hello

Caller--- Is your name Bill Cooper?

Bill--- Yes

Caller--- Would you like to end up in an asylum?

Bill--- Who is this?

Caller--- IF you continue your activities you will meet me
         sooner than you think.

Bill--- Who are you?

Caller--- You should know who I am.

Bill--- I will not talk to you if you don't tell me who you
        are.

Caller--- HUNG UP THE PHONE



(3)  The second call went as follows.

Bill--- Hello

Caller--- Is this Bill?

Bill--- Yes.

Caller--- You are in over your head.

Bill--- Who are you?

Caller--- It doesn't matter you are in over your head.  HUNG
          UP THE PHONE.




(3)  I talked to Christopher again and he denied ever seeing
     the original document or any document.  He said he heard
     that the document had lightning bolts striking at the
     bottom of the rocket.  When I pressed him he could not
     remember seeing the document and stated that he could
     not remember where he heard it.  In fact the graphic
     does have lightning bolts striking at the bottom of the
     rocket.  I do not believe him at all.  He called me and
     had me call him back COLLECT to clarify the matter.
     Thats how important it was to him.  He now says that he
     saw my file with his first name in it and does not
     remember why he thought it important.  He said that he
     WAS HAPPY THAT I WAS WELL AND THAT NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
     TO ME.  WHEN I SAID GOODBYE HE WISHED ME LONG LIFE AND
     GOOD HEALTH.



(4)  I received this call from an anonymous caller.

Bill--- Hello

Caller--- Bill....Is this Bill?

Bill--- Yes this is Bill.

Caller--- I can't talk much.  I called to tell you that you
          are wrong about the alien base.

Bill--- Talk to me, tell me what you can.

Caller--- LUNA is the name of the base on the FAR SIDE OF THE
          MOON.

Bill--- How do you know?

Caller--- Never mind that, LUNA is the name of the base on
          the FAR SIDE OF THE MOON.

Bill--- Can you elaborate, can you tell me anything else?

Caller--- The earth base is called DREAMLAND.

Bill--- How do you know this?

Caller--- Never mind.  I will try to contact you by a safer
          method.  HUNG UP



I do not know what these calls mean if they mean anything.  I
do think it is significant that the information is getting
out.  I will let you judge the content of the calls.

The threats do not worry me as I know that the powers that be
will not give me any warning if they really plan on doing
anything to me.  If they are trying to scare me they cannot
do it.  Since Vietnam nothing much scares me at all.

Bill Cooper
