    Space Animal Theory 
     
    The  Space  Animal  Theiry  was  first  brought  to  public  attention, 
    curiously  enough,   by  the U.S.  Air Force during  its  Project  Sign 
    activity in the late 1940s. The Project "Saucer" (Sign was then still a 
    classified code name)  press release of April 27,  1949,  admitted that 
    the idea had been "remotely considered"  and that many UFOs "acted more 
    like animals than anything else." The Air Force concluded that few such 
    reports  were  reliable.  The concept was also contained in  the  final 
    Project Sign Technical Report of February 1949 (declassified in 1961). 
     
    Trevor  James  Constable (writing under the pen name of  Trevor  James) 
    advocated  a space animal explanation for UFOs in 1958,  and  no  other 
    that Kenneth Arnold,  the man whose sighting opened the UFO era and who 
    was  responsible for coining the label "flying saucer,"  concluded  the 
    UFOs  "...are groups and masses of living organisms that are as much  a 
    part of our atmosphere and space as the life we find in the oceans." 
     
    Naturalist  Ivan T.  Sanderson again addressed the question,  and  many 
    others,   in  1967,  concluding that there was  "...nothing  illogical, 
    irrational,  or even improbable about it.  In fact,  it is so  probable 
    that  it  must  be given first rank in consideration of  the  question, 
    'What  could UAO's [unexplained aeiral objects] be?'"  That same  year, 
    Vincent H. Gaddis addressed the topic, attributing the original idea to 
    a John P. Bessor,  who had sent it to the Air Force the month following 
    Arnold's  classic 1947  sighting.  Gaddis discussed the writings on the 
    subject by Austrian Countess Zoe Wassilko-Serecki and John Cage, a  New 
    Jersey inventor,  and concluded that "...the time will come when one or 
    more  of  these  entities  will be caught,   weighed,   measured,   and 
    exhibited." 
     
    Trevor  James Constable again wrote about space animals in  the  1970s, 
    this  time  in more detail.  He postulated that the UFO  space  animals 
    "...are  amoebalike life-forms existing in the plasma state.  They  are 
    not solid,  liquid,  or gas. Rather,  they exist in the fourth state of 
    matter  -  plasma  - as living heat substance at the  upper  border  of 
    physical  nature."  He also believed that they are of low  intelligence 
    and,   because they remain in the infrared part of the  electromagnetic 
    spectrum,   usually invisible.  he concluded that they  had  "...deeply 
    confused UFO research." 
     
    Although  life  may be found in the most unlikely places and under  the 
    harshest  of  conditions on the surface of the planet,  it is  doubtful 
    that  biological  forms  could evolve in space or  even  in  the  upper 
    regions  of  the atmosphere,  where exposure to cosmic rays  and  other 
    radiations,   such  as those originating from solar flares,   would  be 
    maximized.  The absence of oxygen for carbon-based life would also rule 
    out biological space animals, and the possibility of life existing in a 
    plasma state is, at best, speculative.
