    To  : Mr. Michael Corbin 
          ParaNet Information Service 

    From: Advent Publishing Company and 
          Richard T. Miller 


    A message from you,  made public on many BBS's and pertaining mainly to 
    the Phoenix Project,  was brought to my attention.  In that message you 
    mention  my  name,   the  name of my company,  and  try  to  create  an 
    impression  that  I  am  involved in some type  of  activity  and  have 
    relationships with others that is questionable. 
     
    You   state  in  your  message:   "based  on  striking  and  suggestive 
    circumstances,"   that  there is a possible connection between  myself, 
    Advent  Publishing  Company,  and another publisher - known as  America 
    West and one of their publications "The Phoenix Liberator." You fail to 
    clearly  label  your  statements,   or your  presumptions,   as  "pure" 
    speculation.  I find your technique of using such speculation,  and the 
    end-result of that usage - guilt by implication - very offensive. 
     
    The statement I refer to is - whether I am,  or my company is,  another 
    incarnation of America West and their people. The answer is an emphatic 
    - no. 
     
    Let  me  set the record straight.  I  am a semi-retired electronic  and 
    radio and television broadcast engineer.  I  am also the sole owner  of 
    Advent  Publishing  Company.   This Company is  registered  as  a  sole 
    proprietorship,   in Carson County,  State of Nevada.  I  operate  this 
    business  to  occupy  my  spare time and to  supplement  my  retirement 
    income.  Neither myself,  or my Company has any connection with America 
    West Publishing,  their publication the "Phoenix Liberator,"  or any of 
    their numerous publications.  I do not know them,  and I have never had 
    any dealings with them. 
     
    It  should be perfectly clear and very obvious from what  I've  stated, 
    that  I  find  the activities of America West and the  content  of  the 
    "Phoenix Liberator" thoroughly disgusting. And that, Mr. Corbin, is the 
    overwhelming  reason for my use of a strong disclaimer,  disavowing any 
    relationship  or  affiliation with the above named  organization,   its 
    publications, and their known principals. 
     
    You  also raise the question as to whether I am the same Richard Miller 
    who,  many years ago,  communicated with an individual known as  Hatonn 
    and started an organization known as the Solar Cross. 
     
    My answer may startle you. Yes I am, and yes I did. However, I have not 
    been  active in such activities for many years.  I  am  answering  this 
    question  only  because of your attempt to make an onerous  association 
    between  myself  and America West,  and the  "Phoenix  Liberator."   An 
    association that doesn't exist. 
     
    I can state, however, without reservation, that the "Phoenix Liberator" 
    is fraudulently using the name Hatonn and claiming he is the source  of 
    their  information.  They have used the name of a respected Being as  a 
    "drawing card"  to entice the innocent and lend a degree of credibility 
    to the rubbish they publish. 
     
    I am not the only one who might feel this way.  In closing let me quote 
    a  paragraph in a message sent to Jack Mathias by Don Allen,  regarding 
    America West and the "Phoenix Liberator," on Fido_UFO: 
     
    "Jack - Received your message and here is something to mull over.  Just 
    remember that people who claim to channel "Higher Entities"  should  be 
    judged not only on their words, but also by their actions and ethics. I 
    have read a considerable amount of "Hatonn's"  material and it does not 
    leave  me  feeling  edified,   uplifted or  enlightened.   It  is  very 
    condemnatory. It is, I submit, not of the Light. These aren't the words 
    of a "Christed being"...they are Cooperish rantings from quick buck con 
    artists and most likely the "entity"  that Dharma" is "channelling" (If 
    "Hatonn"   exists  at all)  is most definitely some  lower/dark  astral 
    being. By their fruits ye shall know them."
