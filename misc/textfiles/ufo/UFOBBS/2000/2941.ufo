[PPRCOR.TXT]
This is a correction that should be inserted to replace the
original text to the Phoenix Project Report ULTSEC.TXT, ULTSEC.ZIP.
For those who received it as messages over various echoes the area
to be replaced falls into part 8 of 17.


     Separate projects under the umbrella of Project Aquarius are:

     PROJECT GRUDGE:  This project was originally established in
1948, and is under the control of the CIA, NSA, and MAJI. Project
Grudge went underground and another project, Project Sign, was
created in December of 1947, was used as a cover operation.

     In February of 1949, Project Sign was officially abolished,
however, unofficially it continued its operations until Project
Blue Book was created in June of 1951. Project Aquarius, became the
overall umbrella operation controlling all these projects. Project
Aquarius was funded by CIA confidential funds (non-appropriated).
The Project assumed full responsibility for investigation and
intelligence of UFOs/IACs in December 1969 after Project
Grudge/Blue Book was closed. The purpose of Project Aquarius was to
collect all scientific, technological, medical and intelligence
information from UFO/IAC sightings and contacts with alien
lifeforms. This orderly file of collected information has been used
to advance the United States' Space Program and provided the data
needed to develop present stealth technology.
