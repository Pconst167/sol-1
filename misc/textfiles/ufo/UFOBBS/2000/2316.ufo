  Billions of years ago, the universe and everything within it
exploded into being.  The creation of the universe is the single
paramount event from which all other events precipitate.  That it
happened is obvious.  Understanding how it happened is our ultimate
quest.  As human beings, we ponder the origins of the universe and
its subsequent nature.

  On the smallest scale, the cosmos reveals to us a universe of
quanta particles; on the largest, a universe filled with galaxies,
stars, planets, life, and intelligence.  The progression seems
infinite.

  Are we then to believe ourselves alone in the vastness of
creation, or perhaps even the crown of it?  Is it so inconceivable
to imagine that others have progressed beyond our current level of
technological and spiritual means?

  In 1975, "Corky" Ra, an administrative manager for a large Salt
Lake City supply company, began to receive a series of "visits"
from advanced living beings.  His first reactions of shock and
disbelief lead him to a period of seclusion.

  Yet the visits continued.  The beauty and purity of the concepts
that these individuals brought to him were changing his life
dramatically.  He was instructed to write a book in order to make
this information available to those who are ready to hear it.  The
book was written, and the teachings are now available through the
publication.


                       THE FIRST ENCOUNTER

  References to encounters with Beings not of this planet can be
found in all major philosophies and religions dating back to the
beginning of recorded history.  Encounters with Beings
extraterrestrial or otherwise have happened before.  Filled with
these encounters, our philosophies and religions have formed the
groundwork for enormous social changes with humankind.

  Today scientists and governmental agencies give serious
consideration to the possibility of life elsewhere.  Extensive
research and efforts are being expended to contact extraterrestrial
life forms.  No longer can the conscious human ignore the question,
"Is there intelligent life in places other than Earth?"

  Something is happening!  The majority of the population believe
in the probability of extraterrestrial life, and many of them have
seen evidence to sustain that belief.  Even prominent people such
as Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, former presidents of the United
States of America, have reported mysterious encounters.  The
condition of the mind, be it opened or closed, will determine
whether humans will find answers to the many questions which plague
them concerning other intelligent life and the enigma surrounding
the origin of the cosmos.

  This is my report of an encounter with Beings not of this planet. 
It is a true story -- as true as I understand truth to be -- as
true as I am able to describe it.  I wish to report that I have had
an unprecedented, modern day, personal encounter with advanced
Beings.  One might ask, "Who are they and where did they come from? 
How did they contact me?  Are they friendly or unfriendly?  What
treasures of knowledge did they have to share with me?"

  My initial reaction to the encounter was that I was losing my
reasoning.  I was hesitant to tell anyone what had happened to me. 
I felt they would think I had a confused mind or was using some
kind of hallucinogenic drug.  The encounter was completely
contradictory to my belief system and to the structure of my "ego."

  I had been an Elder in the Mormon Church, married with two
children, and well educated.  I didn't possess the mental "space"
or openness to accept the events which happened to me.

  Originally, I thought these Beings had come into my life to suit
their own purposes, using me to fulfill their ends.  I can say that
I now know how it feels to have an encounter of the type so often
spoken of in history.  I know how it feels to touch Beings not of
this world -- what they look like, how they smell, and how it is to
be with them.  I know how they behave, where they come from, and
why they contacted me.

  In retrospect, I concede that what happened to me did not cause
fear or anxiety except for when my "ego" refused to accept the
reality of the encounter.  I was also concerned about what other
people would think of me if I explained my experience to them.  In
the past I believed that people who told of experiences like mine

were either lying or mentally ill.  This put me in a precarious
situation.  There has always been ridicule directed at those who
have publicized their experiences.  Society is full of strident
professional debunkers whose hidden personal fears have sealed
                                        Copyright 1989 (C) Summum

their minds.

  In 1974, I had finished constructing a den in my new home.  The
home was built for me by my father and was situated in an exclusive
area of the Salt Lake Valley.  Located at the base of Mount
Olympus, it had a fabulous view where you could see from one end of
the valley to the other.  I was the administrative manager for a
large supply company in Salt Lake City.  After work, and the normal
greetings to wife and children, I would go down to the den to relax
for a few minutes before dinner.  Sitting on the carpeted floor
with my back against the wall, I would close my eyes and just rest.

There was no noise, just total silence, complete calm.  It was a
wonderful way to relax from a hectic day.  After several months of
this form of relaxation, I began to notice a "ringing" in my ears. 
The more I listened to it, the more intense the ringing became.

  Months passed, and as often as possible I would practice my
"relaxation" in the den after work, listening to this sound that
had now moved to the center of my mind.  During this time, my wife
and I began to perceive the world from two totally unrelated
perspectives.  Our marriage dissolved and we were divorced.  I
moved, changed employment which doubled my income, and was now
practicing my relaxation in an apartment after work.

  One afternoon in late October 1975, after calling upon clients
all day, I came home to the apartment, sat down on the front room
sofa, and began to practice my relaxation.  I closed my eyes,
turning my attention away from all outside noise and towards the
sound within my mind.  It became very intense.  Suddenly, I was
totally engulfed by the sound, every cell of my body vibrating.  It
seemed as if the sound was coming from both outside and inside of
me simultaneously.  It was completely encompassing.

  Instantly, I opened my eyes and found myself standing next to an
enormous pyramid.  I was neither frightened nor concerned.  An
unusual calm and peace permeated my entire being.  I was in a
totally aware state of consciousness.  There were no questions in
my mind, such as, "Why am I standing next to this huge pyramid?" 
I had heard about pyramids from my studies of world history in
school, but I knew little about them.

  I was fascinated by this pyramid.  I began walking around it, to
what I perceived to be the north side.  It appeared to be about one
half mile long at the base and made of a material similar to
graphite.  Its surface was smooth, and I did not notice any
distinguishing markings or etchings, nor did I see any entrance
ways.  Grass covered the ground and it was as perfectly manicured
as a golf green.  The sky was bright but there was no sun.  Stars
filled the heavens.  There was no sound or movement of any kind. 
It felt as if everything was perfect, and my being there was part
of this perfect state.
                                        Copyright 1989 (C) Summum

  As I arrived at what I believed to be the north side of the
pyramid, I saw another structure.  This second structure had a
round, convex shape, like a flattened ball.  It also was very
large, appearing to be about one hundred yards in diameter.   It
seemed to be constructed of the same material as the pyramid.  Its
surface was smooth with no markings or visible entrance ways.  I
walked right up to the structure, feeling drawn towards it.  I felt
compelled to walk through its wall, and I did.

  At this point I became intensely interested in my body for it
amazed me to be able to walk through a wall that was at least three
feet thick.  I felt my hands and my arms.  I could feel my body. 
It was real and I was alive.  I was conscious.  I breathed.  My
heart was beating.  Physically nothing had changed, and yet I had
just walked through the wall -- unbelievable!  The material of the
wall seemed to just flow around my body.  I could feel the ground,
but it was as if I was "melting" through the wall.

  Passing through the wall, I found myself in a large room resonant
with light radiating from the air.  The walls, floor, and ceiling
looked as if they were made of very thick glass.  Ahead of me,
about thirty feet away, stood a group of individuals.  They looked
like humans, yet they were different.  Both male and female
individuals were there.  Their appearance was striking!  They were
so beautiful, so elegant, that I could not take my eyes off of
them.  Their facial features and bodies were so perfectly formed,
it seemed as if they were divine in their physical appearance.  I
had never seen such extremely attractive people before.  As I
started to wonder about them, a concept came into my mind which
answered all my questions.  They established a high level
telepathic link with my mind, and instantaneously I understood
them.  I knew of their origin, their work, and their purpose.

  They guided me across the room and directed my attention to an
area on the floor.  Out of the floor rose an elliptical glass-like
shaft approximately eighteen by ten inches in size.  I watched it
rise from the floor and looked into it.  Concepts started streaming
through my mind.  It seemed as if I had been standing there for a
lifetime, for several lifetimes, so penetrating were these concepts
flowing into my mind.  I subsequently learned that the glass-like
shaft was a form of crystal, and that as I looked down into it,
there was another crystal shaft protruding from the ceiling towards
the back of my head.  With newfound appreciation, I am reminded
that recorded history makes mention of communication taking place
through the use of crystals.  Within religious books such as The
Bible, The Torah, and The Bhagavad Gita are found passages
describing the use of crystals in communication.  Perhaps the
crystals I encountered can be considered a contemporary Urim and
Thummim (see Exodus ch. 28 vs. 30).

  After sorting out some of the concepts which were now in my mind,
I came to realize that for the human being to understand these
                                        Copyright 1989 (C) Summum

concepts in such a short term, it is necessary to reorganize the
human thinking processes.  The mind must be organized rather than
in a state of confusion.  I have since concluded that with the
facility of the crystals which were tuned to the memory (chemical)
storage within my brain, the concepts were literally impressed upon
me by these magnificent individuals.

  I was never hesitant, nor did I fear or regret anything they did
to me.  In fact, it was quite the opposite.  It is difficult for me
to explain how wonderful this experience was.  There are no words
to express the love and devotion I now have for these divine Beings
and their work.  In their presence, I feel overwhelmed.  I feel as
if I am in the "seventh heaven."  I'm in the safest place one could
ever imagine.  I cannot think of a greater gift than what they gave
me.

  At this point, it is important to stress that I was at all times
in control of my body and its functions.  At no time was my body
ever entered by another entity or spirit.  I was always conscious
while the concepts were being given to me.  There was no entity
speaking through me.  With the current public awareness of
"channeling," a process wherein earthbound, disembodied entities
use the bodies of embodied entities to speak through, it is
important to understand that this is not what happened to me.  The
concepts were given to me, and I worked to gain an understanding of
them on my own.

  I found myself sitting on the sofa in the exact spot where I
started this experience, the sound still in my mind.  I simply sat
there in amazement.  At first I thought I had just experienced some
sort of mental alteration.  I was in a quandary about my
rationality.  The thought of telling anyone about this experience
seemed outrageous, and I remained uncertain about how I was going
to deal with it.  I didn't want to tell anyone about it for fear of
ridicule.  Yet the experience was so profoundly beautiful, there
was no way I could erase it from my mind.  There was no way to
elude the gift of awareness of the concepts.  There were conflicts
about my possession of the knowledge, of what to do with it, how to
figure it all out, and the persistent question, "WHY ME?"  What did
I do to deserve this wonderful experience?

  Being extroverted in nature seemed to make it all the more
difficult.  I found myself wanting to hide from the world, not
knowing what was going to come out of my mouth.  I might tell
someone of the concepts and they would give me the quiz about the
origins of this knowledge.  So, for a short period of time, I
withdrew, spending the majority of time working in my mind with the
concepts that began to fill my life with understanding.

  As time passed I began to comprehend the wisdom of the concepts
and to experience their role within the world I lived in and knew. 
I began to recognize how they formed the underlying Principles that
                                        Copyright 1989 (C) Summum

create my world and the world around me.  Just as I was getting
comfortable with what had happened to me, I would encounter these
angelic Beings again.  They escorted me again to the crystals,
giving me additional information by impressing more concepts within
my mind.  Although, I now began to discover how to apply the
concepts, which helped me to explain to those around me what was
happening to me.

  For the first time in my life, my mental direction started to
move forward rather than in circles.  I was given a gift which made
me different than others around me.  The gift of these concepts
took me from the chaos of the normal humankind mind and into a
clarity of mind beyond belief.  Heavenly Beings, whom I began to
refer to as the Summa Individuals (meaning Highest Individuals),
gave me the knowledge of my personal destiny, for I had arrived at
an understanding of who they were and what their purpose was.  I
came to understand the nature of the work I was responsible to
complete, even though I had no details of how to accomplish this
task.  I thought it would all be laid out like an instruction
booklet.  I assumed that with their knowledge, power, and advanced
state, all I had to do was start the process of informing people
about the Principles and the Summa Individuals would do the rest.

  What an illusion I was entertaining, thinking that they would do
the work and I would be the benefactor of their labors; that I
could watch them use their powers to build and change planet Earth,
and I could reap the rewards of their efforts.  It took a period of
time before I realized that all the benefits and rewards ARE IN THE
WORK!  It took awhile for me to exchange my ego for their celestial
ego and allow myself to comprehend the true value of the gift I had
been given.

  I have been with the Summa Individuals many, many times, and I
expect to be with them again.  But I am not the only one who has
seen them.  Many others have been privileged and blessed to be with
them, touch them, and learn from them.  These advanced Beings work
with those ready to take up the labor of universal progression and
divine evolution, and within the bounds of natural LAW provide
assistance to those willing to take the responsibility of this
destiny.

  From the very beginning, the Summa Individuals opened my
awareness to the Principles.  The Principles are not new.  They
have always existed and have been reported throughout the ages. 
Each time the Summa Individuals support and assist in the evolution
of Humankind, acting as a catalyst for progression, and always
bound by the constraint of the LAW, the Principles are recorded and
made available to those ready to hear them.

  And so it was that I began telling those around me of my
encounters, each time explaining more of what was happening.  I
began the work that led me to writing the book, SUMMUM:  SEALED
                                        Copyright 1989 (C) Summum

EXCEPT TO THE OPEN MIND.  To this date I have found some of the
Principles recorded in books brought to me by students who have
found fragments of them here and there.  But I have yet to find a
single record of the Grand Principle of Creation except that which
is found in SUMMUM:  SEALED EXCEPT TO THE OPEN MIND.  This Grand
Principle is the answer to the ultimate questions, "WHY?" and
"HOW?" Creation Exists.

  As stated, I can not imagine a gift greater than the gift the
Summa Individuals gave me.  My understanding of the Principles has
allowed me to help my students find the answers to life.  The
application of the Principles has changed my life and allowed me to
become a well known person.  The gift of these Principles has
brought me love, a complete love I never knew existed.  It is a
tenderness as soft as a warm gentle breeze; a closeness so close,
the world melts away as I melt within love's union.  The love is so
complete that in its warm gentle wetness, creation's womb holds us
as if we were its chosen divine birth.  The gift is peace of mind,
an understanding of Creation Itself.  The gift is to be held firmly
within the mind of Creation with nothing to ever fear.  It is a
strength of mind drawn from the force which causes all existence to
be -- happiness.

  Here is the message the Summa Individuals have for you.  The
precious gift they gave to me, I give to you.  For you, the open
minded, have evolved far enough to understand the very Principles
of Creation.  You too can have the wealth of the wealthy, the fame
of the famous.  Accept the peace of mind, the understanding of
Creation, and the strength from the force which brings all Creation
into existence.  Held firmly and secure in the knowledge and wisdom
that there is nothing which may harm you, you are held against the
bosom of Creation Itself.

  The love beyond your greatest imagination awaits you!
