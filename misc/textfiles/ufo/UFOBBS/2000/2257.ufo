SUBJECT: ANOTHER DON ECKER INTERVIEW ON UFOs                 FILE: UFO2257




Note****
======================================================
I believe this file to be fraudulent for several reasons.

1.) Although the file origination date matches that of a file by
the same name that we no WAS forwarded to UFINET by Don Ecker, the
material within the document is not the same.

2.) It occurred to us that Don Ecker did not at the time have his
popular radio program, and this file is don in the Radio interview
style of which Don was not familiar with at the time.

DATE OF UPLOAD: July 6, 1990 
 
When I uploaded the CARP.UFO report several weeks ago, I mentioned 
another report that I had received.  The CARP.UFO report was an 
unsigned document, no signature, and no return address.  As I 
stated in reference to that, I gave no credence to the report 
because of the manner that I received it.  This report is a bit 
different.  I did speak to the person that sent it, and am still 
waiting to hear back from his group.  The file is an alledged 
interview between two men, the interviewer is under a pseudonym of 
Bill.  The interviewee is supposed to be a retired Three Star 
General that undertook a favor to "Bill" to check into the UFO 
question.  The man I spoke to is the director of this group, and 
even though he was aware of who I am, and the reason for my 
questions, he refused to put me in touch with either of the other 
two gentlemen "until they checked me out."  I am still waiting to 
hear from them. 
 
Because of some of the subject matter in the report, I had a 
feeling that there was quite a bit of information in this report 
that had been deleted.   According to the director I was right. He 
told me that "Bill" was a still active duty Full Colonel and that 3 
Star was at one time Bill and his commanding officer. 
 
The deleted information is supposed to contain some very disturbing 
information that deals with mutilations, both animal and human, and 
a large number of abducted and missing children and young adults. 
According to the director of this group there were about 20 to 25 
pages of deleted material.  Also seen but of course as is usual, a 
number of photos that 3 Star was able to get at one point.  I would 
rate this report as highly strange, but at this point unverifiable. 
At any rate here is the report and any suggestions from the 
members are most certainly welcome. 
 
I will use Bill for the interviewer and  3* for the interviewee.

***************************************************************** 
THE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT HAS BEEN EDITED FOR THE REASONS AS 
STATED WITHIN.  MUCH INFORMATION WAS DELETED FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC. 
 
Bill> Have you read the book "The Roswell Incident"? 
 
3*>   Yes I have. 
 
Bill> What did you think of the book and just how true is it? 
 
3*>   Bill, as I promised you, I used my contacts and several 
      favors due me over the years and I found out extremely sensitive 
      information which absolutely verify the information as stated in 
      the Roswell Incident. 
 
      The book intrigued me as I read it. At first, I felt the facts or 
      should I say information in the book were there just to sell it and 
      make our Govt. out to be the bad guy...as so many books do today. 
      However, the public has abeen lied to for over 40 years. This 
      bothers me a great deal.  But decisions were made decades ago. The 
      situation in my opinion, is totally out of hand. 
 
Bill> You look concerned and sound irritated. What is wrong? 
 
3*>  Around 4 months ago I called in several favors. I was given 
     documents, allowed to view video tape, given photographs, base 
     locations and I was even asked to participate in the "Awareness 
     Program"...which is to disseminate Alien contact to the public. 
 
     I turned down the offer. When I did I was sort of an outcast and I 
     found friends of 30 years had no time for me. I soon was limited to 
     all forms of information. Hell, every time I requested anything 
     through normal channels it was either lost or delayed for "higher 
     approval". This was normal everyday decisions, which wer NEVER 
     questioned before. I gave over --30-- years of faithful and loyal 
     service to this great country of ours. Who in the hell do those 
     political bastards think they are anyway? 
 
Bill> I don't know what to say. I feel that because I asked for 
      the inquiry, you got into trouble. I really feel bad. I know you 
      didn't get where you are today by taking it easy. Did you retire? 
 
3*>  You are not responsible! I kind-of knew what I might get 
     myself into. I always had my suspicionss and I to heard the rumors 
     about alien spacecraft that crashed, bodies found, alien craft shot 
     down, UFO evidence stored in special buildings on certain military 
     bases. I just never really took it seriously. I know it is true. I 
     have seen the evidence, I have seen the alien craft, the frozen 
     bodies from the Roswell site and I have seen on video tape, the 
     live alien which is a guest of the U. S. Govt. To answer your last 
     question, yes I did retire. 
 
Bill> Could you give some specific information on the Aliens, 
      what they want, the govt. involvement, the reason why we have not 
      officially been told about alien involvement in our society and why 
      all of the many "strange" things or happenings associated with UFO

      sightings and people-contact with aliens? 
 
3*>  There have been several crashes of UFOs over the years. From 
     all documentation and information available that I have seen with 
     my own eyes as well as the physical evidence, this is in answer to 
     your questions. 
 
     1. The aliens really do not have any sort of invasion planned for 
        this planet. Aliens have visited this planet off and on for 
        thousands of years. Our U.S. guest is over 300 years old. There are 
        both "good and bad" aliens just as there are good and bad humans. 
        They are not all that different from us. The aliens utilize around 
        55% of their brain capacity or ability. The aliens do have DNA, 
        just like we do. The alien which is the guest of the U.S. Govt. is 
        5 feet 3 inches tall and weights 96 pounds. Large head (no hair) 
        large slanted eyes. Some of the aliens' abilities include moderate 
        telepathy and telekinisis. 
 
        The purpose of alien visitation to this planet is one of curiosity 
        and scientific research. Not world domination as some would have 
        you believe. Cattle and humans have been used in alien and U.S. 
        research for various biological applications. Most humans are not 
        hurt in this research and experimentation. Some however, have died 
        due to complications and down-right carelessness. 
 
        Several cross-breed "young" have been born to both human females 
        and alien females. We as humans are fully biological compatible 
        with most visiting aliens. Some we are not. More that one type or 
        species of alien has visited this planet. They are listed by 
        category...this information I could not retrieve. 
 
     2. The U. S. Govt. and the British have made secret treaty 
        agreements with the aliens in exchange for technology and so-called 
        recon missions during times of human conflict. The aliens have 
        basically agreed not to concern themselves with the wars or 
        conflicts of humans. Not to interfere in society. Let the Govts. 
        rule and decide. Exactly what the aliens get in return was not 
        exactly made clear or available. 
 
        Also, there are special teams which eradicate, discredit, harass 
        and trump-up charges to control humans which experience any 
        visitations from aliens, or make verifiable UFO sightings. This is 
        one of the reasons I retired. It's too much for any govt. to impose 
        upon the civilian population like this. 
 
     3. Many of the strange happenings which people experience with UFO 
        sightings can be one of two things. First, simply an overactive and 
        wishful imagination. Second and foremost is the influence of the 
        vast mental power of the alien visitors. In the reports and 
        experiments conducted with live aliens, they have an incredible 
        power of telepathic suggestion. Combine this with their telekentic 
        abilities and just about anyone can be some-what directed to do or 
        think just about anything. 
 
     Did I cover all of your questions? 
 
Bill> One more and you'll be done. Why all the secrecy from day 
      one about the alien contact, the Roswell Incident, UFOs etc.? 
 
3*> The Roswell Incident happened at a very hectic time. World 
    problems and domestic matters drew priority. Make no mistake, Pres. 
    Truman and later Pres. Eisenhower gave specific direct orders to 
    keep everything and I mean everything top secret. At that time, all 
    alien (known as EBE) information became departmentalized and 
    dispersed on a need to know only basis. I as well as others heard 
    rumors and pursued our career with no further thought to the matter. 
 
    Also consider the fact that even with today's high technology we 
    still don't know all of the propulsion system, craft manufacture 
    and so forth. The most recent information that I did manage to 
    receive before I was cut off is that the alien craft has 
    more-or-less been copied by top scientific experts and is functional. 
 
    The "special group" assigned to oversee the alien situation and 
    other govt. VIPs agree to gather all of the technology possible and 
    put it to use for the benefit of the USA. I really wonder what 
    other motives are there. One very important thought about reasons 
    for secrecy are common religious values and beliefs. Most of the 
    world religions (especially in the US) would tumble. This in turn 
    would cause panic and chaos. Something not wanted or needed in any 
    time. 
 
    Look at the big lie the Federal Govt. has created, promoted swore 
    to and fed to the public over the past 42 years. Even the 
    Presidents of the US from 1947 to present day has lied about this 
    situation. Talk about a cover up? If this information would ever 
    get out, many people from the President down would be removed from 
    office. Many would go to jail in one form or another. 
 
    My information led me to other more graphic reasons that I really 
    don't want to discuss. This whole situation is fantastic enough and 
    the imnplications are endless. 
 
    The "awareness program" that I mentioned earlier was designed to 
    inform the public about alien contact, landings, crashes, the 
 

[Created by Psplit 1.03]                                    [Page 3 of 5] 
 
    Roswell Incident, UFOs and the govt. All of this is filtered to the 
    public in a systematic, logical way. This is coupled with the 
    increased alien--human abductions and contacts. This is a joint 
    govt. and alien program. If done correctly, there will be extremely 
    little or no panic and no resistance. The world govts. will retain 
    control and chaos is avoided. 
 
Bill> Thank you very much for your time and this timely 
      information. 
 
3*> Now that I have found this information out, I wonder about 
    everything I could not access or was prevented from learning when I 
    turned down the position on the "asareness program"? 
 
Bill> I know that I am pushing it a bit here but could you go 
      into some of the topics that seem to be eating away at you? 
 
3*> Lets take a break from this interview for now. Its after 
    11:00 PM and I'm tired. I'll give you a call in a few days and we 
    will go from there. 
 
Bill> It sounds good to me too. I've got a lot of work to do in 
      the morning so I better call it quits for now. 
 
================================================================= 
 
This is the second and final installment of the purported interview 
with a retired 3 Star General, being interviewed by what was 
described to me as a still active duty Full Colonel interested in 
the subject of UFOs.  Now prior to continuing with this, allow me 
to make an observation. 
 
Since I uploaded part one of this file, and with the upload of the 
previous file -- CARP.UFO-- I have received several E-Mail notes 
asking me why I have put out such outlandish and paranoid files.  I 
will answer like this.  First, I do not believe that any of us here 
have a really good and solid idea of just what is happening in the 
bizarre world of UFOs.  Since I have started to explore this thing 
several years ago, believe me when I tell you that I have 
experienced most of the angles of this subject. Everything from the 
Space-Brothers are here to save us from ourselves, tales of ET love 
affairs with the likes of the ledgendary Semjase ( now that is one 
ET I would LOVE to meet! ) to tales of "Their here eating us!!" to 
the Leader of the free world selling drugs to support MJ-12!!!! 
What this all boils down to is a hell of alot of rhetoric and damn 
little proof.  Oh, there is some proof to be sure, ie mutilated 
cows, ( you ain't lived till you have been up to your elbows in one 
) scars on alledged abductee's ( one gentleman told me that he 
turned gay after his 16th birthday because of repeated abductions. 
he was tired of being forced to copulate with alien females ) 
landing traces ( hard baked soil compacted inches, something damn 
heavy had set down on it ) and tales from dozens of people, living 
in some cases a whole continent apart ( with the same information 
in uncanny detail ).  OK, what does this mean?  In my opinion, it 
means that SOMETHING damn strange IS INDEED ONGOING..... so, that 
means that the only way to find out is investigate and investigate 
some more.  Knowledge is power, so the reason I have uploaded this 
files is that MAYBE someone out there in computer land, ( and you 
would be really suprised where all ParaNet DOES GO ) will have a 
missing piece of the puzzle, and better yet will contact one of we 
happy little band of investigators -- with PROOF 
.................... and by the way, to those good meaning folks 
that have written me email, just because I put something up here, 
it does not mean that I think this is what really is happening. 
Always read what I have to say about the file in advance.  In this 
case, I stated that there is HIGH STRANGENESS in this one, BUT NO 
PROOF THAT IT IS LEGITIMATE. 
 
***************************************************************** 
 Part II of the 3 * interview. 
 
JULY 14, 1989 
 
Bill>  Thank you for agreeing to a second interview on this 
       topic. Did you enjoy your trip to the mountains? 
 
3* >  Yes my wife and I had a wonderful time. 
 
Bill>  What is bothering you so much about the alien situation? 
 
3* >  As I mentioned before, there have been several UFO crashes, 
      not just the one in Roswell, New Mexico.  Look at the documents I 
      brought with me. The photos are quite explicit to the CARGO OF SOME 
      OF THE UFOs. 
 
Bill>  Why are there children aboard these crafts!? My God! You 
       don't mean that the aliens are snaching our kids?  What for?? 
 
3* >  There are over a million missing children every year in the 
      US alone. Now, not all of them have been taken by aliens. The 
      aliens take about 2,200 children a year from the US and other 
      countries. Its all right there in the report attached to the three 
      photos. The rest of the missing children are the result of 
      mankind's dark side. You know what I mean. It's in the paper every 
      day. 

[Created by Psplit 1.03]                                    [Page 4 of 5] 
 
 
      The children are used in several ways; biological, to educate and 
      return, experimentation, disease study. The same as adults. 
 
Bill>  Adults are one matter, but leave the children alone. I am 
       very bothered by this information. According to the report, 
       implants are being used on the people that are taken aboard UFOs 
       and returned. Some of these implants are microscopic in size (and 
       smaller) and influence the growth, function and learning 
       capabilities of the individual. This is a very detailed report. 
       Could I have a copy? 
 
3* >  No, Sorry but you know our agreement was that you did not 
      get to keep or copy any paperwork. As well as the other matters we 
      discussed. 
 
Bill>  That you did! I will keep my word, don't worry. 
 
3* >  I would like to mention a little bit more of why the public 
      have not been told the truth. Lets run through the whole thing 
      rather quickly. 
      1. Security/Fear Factor; Everyone feels safe knowing that the US 
         is one of the dominate powers on Earth. Right? The Human race is in 
         control and science will solve it all. The simple fact is--if you 
         take away the security of people it is replaced with fear! Fear is 
         the first step to chaos. Just imagine what would happen if there 
         was an announcement that the govts. are no longer in control, we 
         have aliens living among us, they have kidnapped our people, used 
         them as guinea pigs, killed them, manipulated our culture, tampered 
         with our food, created new diseases to study on us, have interbred 
         with us and there isn't a damn thing we can do about it.  Now, how 
         do you think the public would react? 
 
      2. The fact that the Govt. have been lying, covering up the truth, 
         have given permission for abductions and experiments on the public. 
         Keep in mind that the agencies involved are highly covert, funded 
         very well and have almost absolute power (life and death) over 
         anyone who interferes.  How do you think the public will react? 
 
     3.  Cures for certain diseases, free electrical power, pollution 
         free energy, no longer a need for fossil fuels, abundant food and 
         water for everyone.  All of this has been possible for many years 
         now. What would happen if this technology was turned loose to the 
         public? The tech report showed that within the first year over 18 
         million people out of work. The monetary system would collapse and 
         all of the other problems that go along with it.  A REAL 
         POSSIBILITY OF A GLOBAL NUCLEAR CONFLICT........ALL OUT OF FEAR!! 
         Is it really worth the chance? 
 
Bill>  What you say does make sense when you think about it. 
       What is going on with the sudden surge in UFOs, aliens, abductions 
       and the like? Is this part of the awareness program? 
 
3* >  Yes it is. The awareness program calls for the funding of 
      movies, series on TV, specials and books. All of the "front" money 
      will filter its way to fund a TV series or movie if it is deemed 
      worthy of friendly, helpful alien contact. An idea is passed along 
      to the big named producers and directors and if it takes hold, 
      everything will fall in place and the funding starts. It is really 
      unique how it all works. Now way to trace it to the govt. and the 
      people involved truely believe it is their own creative work. 
      Everyone gets into the act and no problems. After the movie hits 
      the public, the reaction and interest of the masses are carefully 
      monitored. 
 
      Abductions of humans are both random and selective. Influential 
      people are selected to either -- explain and guide the public or to 
      serve some political need or requirement. 
 
      UFO sightings increase when needed to draw the attention of the 
      public. You must keep in mind that the mere mention of UFOs, aliens 
      and the like will draw weird looks, rumors and make people believe 
      that you have a mental problem, not playing with a full deck of 
      cards and so forth. People will make fun of you and will laugh at 
      you! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT. AND WHO WANTS TO BE LAUGHED 
      AT WHEN THEY ARE SERIOUS? The result is not one will say anything 
      unless there are many witnesses. The unique thing about this 
      subject is people don't want to believe. The general feeling is 
      that mankind is all. There is nothing else but God and Country. 
      This is what most people believe. I am not disputing or disagreeing 
      with anything. I just find it amazing that people in general are so 
      damn stupid and stubborn. Let alone that many are so pompous and 
      self-rightous about their religion and self image. Do these people 
      have a rude awaking someday! It can surely be said that we are not 
      alone in this universe. 
 
Bill>  How large are UFOs? What type of propulsion system do the 
       crafts use? do you have any photographs I could look at? 
 
3* >  The alien crafts are disc, triangle, oblong cigar shaped. 
      The range from 30 ft in dia. for the smaller recon discs to over 
      730 ft in dia. for the larger "mother" discs or the flying saucer, 
      if you will. 
 
      The triangle shaped crafts are 210 ft. in dia. This does not seem 

[Created by Psplit 1.03]                                    [Page 5 of 5] 
 
      to change as you can see in the photos which show 3 different 
      triangle crafts which all measure the same and are identical in 
      shape and appearance. 
 
      The oblong cigar shaped craft is the real big one of the three. The 
      only one ever found by the military in the late 60's measured 1,100 
      ft. long with a circumference of 310 ft. Take a look at this photo 
      and read the report attached. The information gathered from this 
      one enabled us to copy the basics of alien technology. It took 20 
      yrs to do so. 
 
      The basic propulsion system or drive is a fusion reactor which 
      ranges in size from about the size of a medicine ball, you know the 
      one tossed around in gym class, to about the size of a large Van or 
      station wagon. It is a magnetic drive surrounded by an aura of 
      bright white light. This is for the disc and triangle shaped 
      crafts. The oblong cigar shaped craft does not have this aura of 
      light.  All crafts are almost totally silent. There is some noise. 
 
Bill>  I can't believe the photos! This looks like something 
       right out of the movies. The other report information which is 
       stapled to the photos is very detailed. This information is both 
       fantastic and very scary! I wish I could share this proof that I am 
       now holding in my hands. I know, I won't ask again. You have to get 
       this evidence back where it belongs before it is noticed missing, 
       don't you? 
 
3* >  Yes I do. If this documentation ever got out I am sure 
      several individuals would be terminated. The powers to be have a 
      systematic method and program that deals with documentation, 
      verification and termination of information and personnel. 
 
      The most important asset to the Govt. on the subject of aliens, 
      UFOs, cover-up story and the like is simply the "OVERALL PROJECTION 
      OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE UFO EXPERIENCES IS ONE OF FANTASY, DELUSIONS, 
      MIS-CONCEPTIONS, UNRELIABLE KOOKS AND CRACK-POTS AND DOWN RIGHT 
      LIARS." Also keep in mind that the news reporters and the news 
      media in general, poke fun at individuals with their quirk smile 
      and light attitude about the whole thing.  Matters can be 
      documented. The proof is out there and is available. Many people 
      must come down off their high horse and open their eyes. it is no 
      shame to admit that you are wrong. No one knows everything and no 
      one should be expected to. 
 
Bill>  It seems to me that you have talked to several people 
       about this subject and the outcome has been negative? At least as 
       you describe the general attitude earlier. Maybe we ought to wrap 
       this issue up? 
 
3* >  I really hate to be sour about this subject but the people 
      of this planet have a God given right to the truth. Many people 
      will not believe what has been stated herein. Many questions are 
      raised and can not be answered. Certainly not to the satisfaction 
      of many. Until the day comes when the big announcement and/or 
      experience happens to you --the individual--you will be too busy 
      and skeptical. Just like I was! 
 
Bill>  Thank you for everything you have done for me. As I agreed 
       to do earlier, I will edit out the graphic details and other 
       information you requested to cover you identity and prevent the 
       people who helped you obtain the documentation from being suspected. 
 
3* > I am well aware that there are no guarantees when this 
     informatioon hits the media. I just hope that the people involved 
     with this whole UFO, alien, and Govt. connection will come forward 
     and let the world know. I feel that mankind will become mature 
     enough to think before acting in the coming decade of the 1990's.
