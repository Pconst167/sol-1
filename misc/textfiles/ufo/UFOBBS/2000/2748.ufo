    HIGH-RISE UFO ABDUCTIONS: 
    Alien abductions rountinely occur in big cities and high-rise 
    buildings around the world. 
     
    By Anita Baskin 
     
      If  you had to guess the perfect time and place for a UFO  abduction, 
    you  would probably choose a deserted country road late at night.   But 
    according to Budd Hopkins,  author of two books on UFO adbuction,   the 
    idea that aliens only snatch people from desolate areas is a myth.   In 
    reality,   Hopkins  claims,  abductions routinely occur in  big  cities 
    around the world. 

      But there's one catch:  Alien craft do not actually land in populated 
    areas, Hopkins explains. Instead, they hover 15, 20, or even 30  floors 
    up and abduct people through windows.  "I know it seems impossible that 
    this  could  happen in a place like New York City,"  Hopkins  contends, 
    "yet it goes on alot." 
    
      "What's  more,"  he adds,  "high-rise abductions are  extraordinarily 
    similar to their rural counterparts."  Indeed,  like the rural variety, 
    urban  abductions  occur  in  the  wee hours  of  the  morning.   Urban 
    abductees, like their country cousins,  report unpleasant medical exams 
    aboard  the alien craft.  And virtually all abductees say they've  been 
    abducted repeatedly since childhood,  regardless of their address.  "If 
    they pick you up, they pick you up when you're a child, and you're like 
    a tagged elk," says Hopkins. "You're part of the ongoing thing." 
    
      Linda Nap (not her real name) is a typical high-rise abductee. Nap, a 
    secretary, claims that she was first abducted from her family's home on 
    the  fifteenth  floor of a Manhattan apartment building at the  age  of 
    six.   Nap  vividly recalls "a toy top with lights"  on the roof  of  a 
    neighboring  building and says that paralysis and fear were all part of 
    the  bizarre  childhood events.  She is especially keen to describe  an 
    abduction  which she claims took place in the fall of 1989.  "I was  in 
    bed in my twelfth-floor apartment on Manhattan's East Side,"  she says. 
    Suddenly  she  found herself standing outside her window  bathed  in  a 
    blue-white light. 
    
      "They'll  get  you anywhere,"  adds Gerald Chamberlain,  a   trombone 
    player  who performs on Broadway.  "When skies are overcast after dark, 
    there can be 50 UFOs sitting 200 feet off the ground of a big city, and 
    no  one will know it."  According to Chamberlain,  aliens abducted  him 
    from his backyard in Refugio,  Texas, when he was a child, in 1953.  He 
    also says he has been abducted "more times than I can count"  from  his 
    six-story apartment in Upper Manhattan, since the 1980s. 
    
      But  if  so  many  UFOs  are visiting  densely  populated  areas  and 
    abducting  victims,   how  is it that none have ever  been  documented? 
    According  to Chamberlain,  the aliens can "erase any episode from  the 
    minds of witnesses. They can tell an entire borough to forget what they 
    saw.  I  recently saw a UFO in Queens.  I  was yelling and pointing and 
    there must have been 40 people in the street, but nobody looked. People 
    just don't watch the sky.  Especially in the city. They just don't look 
    up." 
    
      "Crazy as all this sounds," adds Hopkins, "if one can accept the idea 
    of a craft that's circular, can stop on a dime, make right-angle turns, 
    and go almost instantly from zero to God-knows-what speed, then one has 
    to accept that these craft can visit the city,too."
