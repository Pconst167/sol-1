    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    
    During  the  past several weeks there have been a number  of  questions 
    concerning  the  infamous "Krill Papers".  At the advise of John  Hicks 
    (363/29)   I   am posting this information concerning the documents  in 
    question. 

    1) The "Krill Papers" were and are a fraud. John Lear and John Grace of 
       Nevada  authored these papers and uploaded them to a  Paranet  Board 
       originally  to see just how guliable the UFO investigative community 
       really was.  Much to the credit of Paranet and Mike Corbin,  it  was 
       quickly determined that the documents were in fact fraudulent.  As a 
       result  of  this  both  John Lear and John Grace  were  barred  from 
       Paranet and  several  other UFO related Echos.  While I don't  agree 
       with the methods employed by John, I do understand his reasoning for 
       this. 

    2) In one respect the fraud perpetrated by John Lear and John Grace had 
       the  effect of proving that at least one so called researcher of  of 
       some renoun was in fact a fraud himself. I  am of course refering to 
       William Cooper.   John was listening to Cooper give and interview to 
       one  of the local  news media when he over heard Cooper  state  that 
       while serving in the Navy  he in fact viewed the Krill Papers.  John 
       approached and questioned  Cooper  about this knowing that the Krill 
       Papers and the information  in them was faked.  Cooper stuck to  his 
       story  and decided that John was his enemy.  Especially  after  John 
       pointed out to him that the Krill Papers were faked.  As a result of 
       this  Cooper went on a rampage  and did everything that he could  to 
       discredit Lear and several others. 

    3) For  those of you just coming onto the UFO scene,  it is  imparitive 
       that  you understand that one of the many problems that are inherent 
       to UFO research  field is that information sometimes get  spread out 
       so  quickly  without  proper disemination.  As a result of  this  it 
       becomes  factual  without  basis.  PLEASE...  PLEASE...  don't  take 
       everything you read on  these  databases as being the absolute truth 
       without  first checking with  others  and most importantly  checking 
       your  sources...We  all  get burned from time to time...   including 
       myself  as evidenced by the SS433  fiasco.  But we are the ones  who 
       some day may be looked upon as the true heros of our time.  At least 
       I  hope so...  A  lot of us have lost so much because of what we  do 
       here...
