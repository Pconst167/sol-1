LOST ASTRONAUT TELLS HOW UFO ALIENS SAVED HIS LIFE.
HE HAD BEEN MISSING FOR MORE THAN 20 YRS.


BY WILLIAM ROCK for SUN


An astronaut who was written off as lost in space has been spirited back to 
earth by the friendly aliens who rescued him more than 20 years ago!

The world never learned of the disappearance of Colonel Ivan Tarenko because 
the Russian cosmonaut was part of a top secret mission that went horrible 
wrong.

His space capsule was in danger of collapsing when the alien rescue ship came 
along.

HASN'T AGED

Since then, the grizzled army officer has been living on a far-off planet 
where his helpful hosts taught him their language and way of life.

"It's incredible , but the colonel hasn't aged a bit since his 1972 launch," 
says retired General Alexandr Zhareny, and important cog in the former Soviet 
Union space program.

"He was stunned to learn he's been gone so long. The colonel estimated his 
absence at a month or two - never anywhere near tow decades. He's being kept 
under heavy quarantine because God only knows what he's been exposed to on 
that planet."

SHOCKED

Tarenko shocked government officials in Moscow when he was chaufferured back 
to earth in a small UFO about the size of a 727 jetliner. The craft that had 
plucked him from his failing capsule was huge, about a quarter mile in 
diameter, he said.

"The spaceship was set up like a giant traveling city," says the confused 
cosmonaut.

"They sent out some sort of beam that wrapped around my capsule and pulled me 
into an open bay on the underside of the UFO.

"At first I thought my comrades had come from home to save me and the ship. 
but when I climbed out of my capsule I was greeted by a half-dozen bizarre 
strangers.

SPOKE CLEARLY

"They had big oval shaped heads, tow large totally-black eyes, a little hole 
that I expect served as their noses and no visible mouths. Yet they spoke very 
clearly to each other in a strange language - and to me in perfect Russian.

"I came to learn that they are an extremely intellectual lot with highly 
developed senses. They knew plenty about me, while I didn't have a clue about 
them."

The aliens informed Tarenko that he had nothing to fear from them. He was an 
honored guest aboard their ship and they would do whatever they could to make 
him feel at home.

Alien doctors performed a complete physical to ensure there were no health 
problems that could affect their immune systems. Meanwhile, technicians tore 
apart the crude Russian capsule to see what made it tick.

"While they were giving me the once-over, they saw I suffered from several 
blockages near my heart," says the colonel. "One of them picked up a pencil-
thin instrument and aimed it at my chest. I was a bit edgy because they didn't 
bother giving me any kind of painkiller.

WARMTH

"But when the reddish beam of light sliced into my chest, I didn't feel 
anything except a pleasant warmth. Within 30 seconds the surgery was done and 
I was left with no visible scars - and feeling like a million rubles."

The aliens gave Colonel Tarenko the choice of visiting their home planet or 
being transported back to earth. The curious cosmonaut opted for a look at 
their wonderful world many light years across the universe. 

He was in for a scientific treat. His hosts permitted him free run of their 
planet and supplied him with a personal transport device that resembled a 
motorcycle that zips through the air.

The colonel gained 10 pounds during his stay by feasting on dishes that 
resembled nothing he'd ever eaten on earth.

"Once I got past the odd look of the stuff, I couldn't get enough of it," he 
says.

During his current quarantine, Tarenko is trading knowledge of the aliens for 
news of what's happened here on earth during his absence. 

It has been eye-opening for both parties.
