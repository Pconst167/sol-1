                    LONG ISLAND U.F.O. NETWORK, INC.

                   A Non-Profit Research Organization

                             P.O. BOX 1692

        The Long Island U.F.O. Network, a five year old non-profit
organization which investigates U.F.O. phenomena, announces to the
metropolitan, national and international press community that it has
evidence that on November 24, 1992 at 7:12 P.M. an alien spacecraft
crashed near the area of South Haven Park in Suffolk County near the
residential communities of Shirley and Yaphank, Long Island, New York.

        The event which has been under continuous investigation for six months
by the investigative division of the Long Island U.F.O. Network was first
reported to LIUFON"s U.F.O. Hotline on December 13, 1992 by a Mr. W..... K......
of Mastic Beach, Long Island who witnessed the alien craft to impact in woods
near South Haven Park along Gerard Road which borders the Western edge of the
park.  (I have withheld the name of the witness at this time, although John Ford
included it.  If events warrent it, I may release his name at a later date.
MC.)

        Mr. K...... reported that he was driving East bound on Sunrise
Highway while returning home from work around 7:00 P.M. that evening
when he noticed to the South of the highway over trees which separates Sunrise
from Montauk Highway an unusual object which he described as tubular in shape
with two large bright blue lights on each end with a bright white light in its
center whose structure was composed of a dull metallic grey texture, to
immediately execute a right angle turn and tumble end over end into woods to the
North side of the highway.  Mr. K...... pulled over to the right shoulder and
exited his vehicle in time to see the object impact to the North West.  Upon
impact, the object emitted a powerful white beam of light which shot up into the
sky and turned the night sky into daylight.  As several other motorists joined
him, Mr K...... reported the light to subside into an amber glow which indicated
a fire in progress in the wooded area.

        Mr. K...... proceeded to leave the area convinced he had seen a
UFO crash.  As he neared the exit for William Floyd Parkway (exit 56) he
reported observing a formation of four large military helicopters on a course
from the South East headed for the impact zone over South Haven Park; these
helicopters which were painted black with no visible markings arrived within
minutes of the object's crash.  Mr. K...... reported that there was a military
roadblock on William Floyd parkway with civilian traffic being detoured from
proceeding West onto Sunrise Highway.  He noticed that the military personnel
were dressed in black jump suits and the vehicles showed no markings.  The side
streets of Beatrice, Dawn and Sunset were blocked by additional military
personnel.  At one point five New York State Police cars were turned back from
entering the area (even though the State Police at the West Hampton Barracks
deny this event, a confidential source from that unit has convirmed the story).

        Mr. K...... was able at this point to travel West on Victory Blvd.
(which was later blacked off at 7:35 P.M. which was confirmed by a young
mother of two who was denied use of East bound travel on that road) and
traveled up Gerard Road to the second bend in the road where he found a
large fire in progress some 300 yards back in the woods which was burning
fiercely with a strong odor of burnt insulation in the air.  Mr. K......
said he could see the flames licking the top of trees in the confines
of the park.

        LIUFON has also received a report from a second eyewitness motorist,
a B.. H....... of Brookhaven Hamlet ( again I am withholding the name), who
was traveling East bound on Sunrise when he was about 1/2 mile before the
Horseblock Road exit of that thoroughfare at 7:15 P.M. when he observed an oval
shaped object pass to the North of the Brookhaven Town Dumb garbage mountain on
a descending course 30 degrees to the horizon which was leaving a green
ionization trail as it passed.  He reported this object to be to the North of
Sunrise and was not any conventional aircraft.  It resembles objects reported
over Islip Town which were seen on the Channel 12 News in March 1992 at the
Bagatelle Road Exit of the Long Island Expressway.

        The witness in this sighting did not observe the object impact into
the park, but did observe an unusual ojbect around the time of the UFO
crash in South Haven Park.  The time reference puts it in perspective of the
time frame of the South Haven Park incident.

        The Long Island U.F.O. Network has been investigating this case since
December 1992 when it first received these reports.  Its investigation
has revealed the following:

(1)  LIUFON has done extensive aerial reconnaissance over the park and its
surrounding areas which has revealed evidence of extensive vehicular traffic
in the North West section of the park's fire roads and fields.

(2)  LIUFON has contacted all Federal, State and local agencies including
local Fire Departments which would have been involved in this incident only to
be informed that there exists no record of any incident occurring on the night
of November 24, 1992.  This includes the Suffolk Police, State Police
and Fire Rescue in Yaphank.  Park Officials informed LIUFON that there has not
been a fire in South Haven Park in two to ten years.  The fire departments of
Yaphank, Mastic-Shirley and Brookhaven Hamlet have failed to
answer LIUFON's FOIA requests.

(3)  Residents along River Road reported observing Fire trucks entering the
park that night.

(4)  LIUFON retrieved Fire Department equipment from the main fire road in the
park on December 20th, 1992 which has been identified as being similar to
equipment used by Brookhaven Hamlet Fire Department.

(5)  LIUFON has received confirmation from a Brookhaven Hamlet Fire Department
source that their department was indeed there that night to put out fires that
were caused by something which fell out of the sky and they are prohibited from
speaking about due to Federal Government orders.

(6)  There was a County Wide Alert sounded by the Suffolk County Police that
night that a UFO had crashed near William Floyd Parkway and for all units to use
land lines to receive instructions for emergency mobilization.

(7)  The Park itself was closed for several days after the crash.  County
officials at first denied this, but later informed the editor of the South
Shore Press in Mastic Beach that it was closed for duck hunting season.
Residents in the area reported Suffolk Police manning road blocks near the park
entrance for days after the incident.

(8)  Residents in the area reported hearing the object crash that night while
others observed the helicopters over the area for hours that night.
Others reported strange electrical problems with the electrical grid, cable
T.V., home appliances burning out months after the incident, car batteries
failing and the telephone system malfunctioning.  All phenomena associated
with what would be the result of a massive Electro Magnetic Pulse Effect
occurring in the area.  Residents have also reported unusual and frequent
replacement of light bulbs in their homes.

(9)  LIUFON has over the last five months covered by foot every inch of the
3000 acre park.  It has discovered that fire roads were widened in the North
West section near the Rifle-Shotgun Range and evidence of heavy construction
equipment were brought in.  Areas that are prohibited to vehicular traffic
showed signs of heavy tire marks and fields in the North West area and every
blade of grass flattened due to frequent vehicular activity.  Mounds of freshly
chipped trees were discovered near the Gerard Road side of the park which were
found to be slightly radioactive.  No explanation was offered for this by park
authorities who declined to comment.

(10)  The fencing along both River and Gerard Roads were tested by an
electornics engineer using a portable magnetometer in December and February
for magnetic anomalies.  Test results showed that fencing exhibited signs of
reversed magnetic polarity as if exposed to a South Pole magnetic field.

(11)  Elevated levels of radiation were detected in the North West and
Gerard Road areas of the Park which exhibited abnormal background levels of
radiation that came in six second bursts ranging from .05 to as high .3
mille-reontgens.

(12)  LIUFON Discovered two areas of flattened and broken trees along Gerard
Road.  One area over one hundred yards long showed signs of broken and
splintered trees with evidence of a recent fire.  Trees in the second area
showed signs of holding a strong magnetic field after testing with a
magnetometer.

(13)  The light from the crashed object was seen by residents in the area as
far north as Ridge and as far West as Bald Hill in Coram.
(14)  Residents in the area have been harassed by the Police from talking about
that night.  One resident, a pentecostal minister, reported his 1984
Mercury Marquis sedan bursting into flames when his car attempted to start
itself on December 29, 1992.  The minister was later taken into Police custody
and transferred to Stony Brook Pyschiatric when he equated the incident with the
UFO Crash in the Park.  He was released when he was allegedly coerced into
signing a statment his car fire had nothing to do
with the UFO crash.  He is now suing the Suffolk Police for one billion dollars.

(15)  Numerous residents have reported to LIUFON encountering the military
and Police road blocks that night in the area around the park.

(16)  Over seven various fire departments responded that night to control the
fires from the crash.  They were Medford, Coram, Yaphank, Middle Island,
Brookhaven Hamlet, Mt. Sinai and Ridge.  In addition, elements of the Brookhaven
National Laboratories Fire Department and Emergency Response Team were
dispatched to the location as the only Fire Department trained to control a
radiological fire on Long Island.  In some instances, local fire units were
turned away due to their lack of expertise in radiological fires.
This information was confirmed by the editor of the South Shore Press and
confidential sources known to LIUFON.

(17)  Some sort of fire occurred near Police Headquarters and the County
Correction Farm that night on Yaphank Avenue which may have been linked to the
events in South Haven Park.  This is still under investigation at the
moment.

        Three weeks ago LIUFON Chairman John Ford received anonymously a package
in his home mail box which contained a video tape from a Department of Defense
Systems Analyst who lives in Rocky Point, N.Y., purporting to show the recovery
of the wreckage of the South Haven Park UFO from an area
North of the Park.  In the tape there are also scenes of the recovery of body
parts and bodies of which it appears to be highly suggestive of humanoid beings
associated with current UFO abduction reports.  LIUFON analysis of the tape
under the auspices of Preston Nichols and Alan Green both with LIUFON, has
produced with video enhancement and stop frame analysis photographs of humanoid
beings by way of special filters on 35mm cameras of entities which appear not to
be human, but alien in appearance.

        The tape is from a government source which was confiscated from Fire
Department personnel on the scene.  The government analyst who has now contacted
LIUFON and identified himself has agreed to meet with members of NBC's Unsolved
Mysteries and the editor of the South Shore Press to discuss this disturbing
tape.
        As of this writing, LIUFON has agreed to withhold circulation of the
tape and photographs of the crash and entities while NBC's Unsolved Mysteries
staff discusses arrangements to bring this story to the American people in a
national broadcast.

        LIUFON reports that it has received information that the wreckage of the
object is currently being stored at Brookhaven National Laboratories for study.
This may also explain recent reports by residents on the South Shore
of continuous black helicopter flights into the labratory area over recent
months.
        LIUFON has also come under persistent Suffolk Police harassment as it
attempted to canvass residential areas around the Park.  On January 9th, LIUFON
researchers were detained and questioned by Police in an attempt to dissuade
them from distributing literature on the event to residents on Gerard Road.

        On July 5, 1993, LIUFON plans a public protest march to protest the UFO
Cover Up at Hauppauge, L.I. at the H. Lee Dennison Building, administrative
center for the Suffolk County Government.  This is in conjunction with the
National Right to Know Committee's rally in Washington, D.C. on that date,
protesting the UFO Cover Up.
