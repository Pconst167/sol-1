   PARIS  MATCH is a slick French weekly something like a  classy
cross  between TIME and PEOPLE MAGAZINE. It is very  widely  read
and something of a journalistic institution. Although the  reader
can  count on the latest gossip concerning Charles and  Lady  Di,
each  issue  also  contains serious  coverage  of  political  and
scientific issues.
   Thanks  to  the  linguistic  abilities  of  my  wife,  I  have
translated  an astonishing article that appeared in the  July  5,
1990  issue.  This recounts a series of sightings of a  UFO  over
Belgium.  There were thousands of witnesses, and the  object  was
tracked  simultaneously by two ground radar installations and  by
the airborne intercept radars of two F-16 fighters sent to  chase
it.
   But  by far the most significant aspect of this case  is  that
the Belgium government released all the data and worked in  close
cooperation  with  a civilian UFO research organization.  To  the
best of my knowledge, this is unique in the history of ufology.
   Indeed  it is the "political" aspect that prodded me  to  take
the  considerable  time  and  effort  to  make  this  translation
available  to  ufologists  in the U.S.    Please  "network"  this
document as you see fit, remembering that the article (but not my
translation) is copyrighted.

	      AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON THE RADAR OF AN F-16
			  by Marie-Theresa De Brosses

   The  Belgium  Defense Minister authorized us to  publish  this
report.  It  is the "scoop of the sky." These  two  screens  (see
photos)  [The  article is referring to two photos  of  the  radar
screens in the F-16 which are derived from an internal  recording
device in the plane. Photo one shows the UFO as a diamond on  the
screen  framed by short vertical lines indicating that the  pilot
has instructed the computer to follow the target. The  comparison
of the two photos supports statements by the pilots that the  UFO
dove  from 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) to 00, indicating that it  was
below  the  200 meter limit on the radar. This  occurred  in  ONE
second.] are the incontestable witnesses of a meeting of  science
& fiction. In an unprecedented action, the Belgium Air Force  has
released pictures of the radar images of UFOs intercepted by  the
pilots  of their F-16 fighters. It was the precision and  clarity
of the pictures that convinced the Defense Minister to order full
resources  deployed in the gigantic chase of the UFO  during  the
Easter  weekend.  PARIS MATCH takes you behind  the  symbols  and
numbers of these exceptional pictures to discover the  incredible
performance  of  those  flying objects which are  very  real  but
nonetheless  unidentified.  We may not be the only  ones  in  the
universe.
   There  are  people in the military services who  are  normally
silent on this subject but who now say: the UFOs are not a  myth.
On  June  22nd,  for  the first time in  history,  an  Air  Force
revealed  an important piece of this story which is  not  science
fiction.
   On  this  day,  after  going  through  a  meticulous  security
screening,  I find myself in the headquarters of the Belgium  Air
Force near Brussels. In a small room, Colonel DeBrouwer, Chief of
Operations  of  the  Belgium  Air Force,  started  a  video  tape
recorder.  On the screen appeared the film that was brought  back
in  the  "black box" of the F-16 that was launched to  chase  the
UFO.  This,  it turned out, was not really the  important  chase,
which  would  happen  two weeks later, when  practically  all  of
Belgium tried to capture the UFO. But until now we were not  told
about the one Colonel DeBrouwer was about to describe.
   The  Belgium military had been on alert since  November  1989,
when numerous reports by the Gendarmerie (National police  force)
began  pouring  in daily telling of observations  of  UFOs  above
Belgium territory. It had started on the crazy night of  November
29,  1989, during which 30 groups of witnesses, among them  three
police patrols, scattered over 800 square kilometers of territory
between  Liege and the German/Netherlands border, reported  UFOs.
All  of  the witnesses observed for hours  a  strange  triangular
object  nearly  silent,  maneuvering at low speed  and  very  low
altitude, without creating the least amount of turbulence.
   As  do the world's Air Forces, the Belgian  military  have  at
their disposal supersonic interceptor airplanes ready 24 hours  a
day  to  take off with five minutes notice. In this case  we  are
talking  about  two  F-16  single  pilot  fighters,  armed   with
missiles.  Headquarters was prudent and conservative. During  the
previous month the two planes have twice been sent in response to
sightings  but without results. The first time they saw  nothing.
The second instance was attributed to an advertising  searchlight
for a night club.
   On the night of March 30th, one of the callers reporting a UFO
was a Captain of the national police at Pinson, and  Headquarters
decided  to  make  a serious effort to  verify  the  reports.  In
addition  to the visual sightings, two radar  installations  also
saw the UFO. One radar is at Glons, southeast of Brussels,  which
is part of the NATO defense group, and one at Semmerzake, west of
the Capitol, which controls the military and civilian traffic  of
the entire Belgian territory. The range of the two radars is  300
KM, which is more than enough to cover the area where the reports
took  place.  In  this region the land is  fairly  flat,  rolling
country  without  any prominent hills. The radar  has  a  perfect
view of all flying objects with an altitude above 200 meters over
the ground. Nevertheless, Headquarters determined to do some very
precise  studies  during  the next 55 minutes  to  eliminate  the
possibility  of  prosaic  explanations  for  the  radar   images.
Excellent  atmospheric  conditions prevailed, and  there  was  no
possibility of false echoes due to temperature inversions.
   All military and civilian airplanes are equipped with a device
called a transponder which permits their immediate identification
on the radar screen in the form of a coded signal. The radar echo
received  on  that night was like that of an  airplane  that  was
moving  at very low speed, about 50 KPH, and frequently  changing
direction  and  altitude.  But it did not  send  any  identifying
transponder signal.
   Naturally, the Belgian Air Force can't permit an  unidentified
object to fly over its territory. So at 0005 hours the order  was
given to the F-16s to take off and to find the intruder. The lead
pilot  concentrated  on his radar screen, which at night  is  his
best   organ   of  vision.  The  F-16  is  equipped   with   very
sophisticated  equipment,  including chase radar,  which  is  not
fixed directly ahead of the airplane, but makes a wide search  in
an arc of 90 degrees left and right of the nose. Slightly  behind
the  lead  fighter, the wingman in the second F-16  followed  the
movements of the first jet, concentrating on maintaining  contact
with the center of coordination of the search.
   Suddenly the two fighters spotted the intruder on their  radar
screens, appearing like a little bee dancing on the scope.  Using
their  joy  sticks  like a video game,  the  pilots  ordered  the
onboard  computers to pursue the target. As soon as  lock-on  was
achieved,  the target appeared on the screen as a diamond  shape,
telling the pilots that from that moment on the F-16s will remain
tracking the object automatically. On the screen is indicated the
object's position, distance and speed. The object was very  close
to the fighters.
   On this portion of the video tape that Col. DeBrouwer has,  in
such  an exceptional manner, allowed us to see, we can  hear  the
radio exchange of the two pilots. The emotions of the pilots  are
clearly  perceptible. "Look," the Colonel tells me  stopping  the
VCR,  and  showing me the diamond shape on the screen,  "At  this
stage  in the chase in our military jargon it means a  successful
interception."
   Then  I  said,  in layman's terms,  what  does  a  "successful
interception"  mean?  He answered, "Our fighter planes are  armed
with automatically self-directed missiles. Once they are launched
internal  computers  in  the  missiles  intelligently  guide  the
missiles to the target by themselves. Of course, in this case  of
the  UFO there was no question of doing that. We only  wanted  to
identify the intruder."
   The  pilot  did not even have time to  start  this  procedure,
which requires the fighter's radar to stay locked on for at least
six  seconds.  But  the object had speeded  up  from  an  initial
velocity  of  280 KPH to 1,800 KPH, while descending  from  3,000
meters   to   1,700  meters...in  one  second!   This   fantastic
acceleration  corresponds  to  40  Gs.  [A  "G"  is  a  unit   of
acceleration.  One G is equivalent to the gravitational  pull  of
the  earth, 9.81 m/sec/sec.] It would cause immediate death to  a
human on board. The limit of what a pilot can take is about 8 Gs.
And the trajectory of the object was extremely disconcerting.  It
arrived at 1,700 meters altitude, then it dove rapidly toward the
ground  at an altitude under 200 meters, and in doing so  escaped
from  the  radars of the fighters and ground units at  Glons  and
Semmerzake.  This  maneuver  took  place  over  the  suburbs   of
Brussels,  which are so full of man-made lights that  the  pilots
lost sight of the object beneath them.
   "In  any  event, it was out of the question for  the  F-16  to
catch up with the object at this low altitude, where the  density
of  the air limits the speed to 1,300 KPH. Above that speed,  the
temperature  in the compressors of the jet turbines  would  cause
the  engines to burst," said Col. DeBrouwer. "There was  a  logic
behind the motions of the object."
   Everything  indicates  that  this  object  was   intelligently
directed  to  escape from the pursuing planes.  During  the  next
hours the scenario repeated twice.  The Commander of the  Belgian
Air  Force gave me a detailed report which had been  produced  by
the  Belgian Society For The Study of Special Phenomena  (Sobeps)
in cooperation with the Air Force.  The report states: "In  three
cases the pilots managed to get their radar locked on the object,
with the immediate result that the object's behavior  drastically
changed.  The  object  literally played hide and  seek  with  the
fighters.  It dived toward the ground to evade the  airborne  and
ground  radars.  Then  it  climbed back into  radar  range  in  a
leisurely manner, thus initiating a new chase.
   This  fantastic  game of hide and seek was observed  from  the
ground  by  a great number of witnesses, among them  20  national
policemen  who saw both the object and the F-16s.  The  encounter
lasted  75  minutes, but nobody heard the supersonic  boom  which
should  have been present when the object flew through the  sonic
barrier. No physical damage was reported. Given the low  altitude
and  the  speed  of the object, many  windows  should  have  been
broken.
   So,  for the first time in history, a newspaper  reporter  was
allowed  to  see  a  document  which  established  proof  of   an
interception  of a UFO by a military fighter. I have seen on  the
video  screen the flight maneuvers and the extraordinary  changes
in speed of the UFO.
   All the details of this affair are related in the report which
has just been released by Sobeps. This collaboration between  the
Air  Force  of a nation and a private research group  is  without
precedent and must be taken very seriously.  Also, the competence
of  the  civilian  researchers is worthy  of  trust.  This  group
includes  several scientists with excellent credentials  such  as
physicist Leo Brenig, Professor at the University of Brussels and
August  Meesen, Professor at the Catholic University of  Louvain,
who has belonged to Sobeps since its creation 18 years ago. On  a
television  interview,  Mr. Guy Coeme the  Minister  of  Defense,
declared  that  he had authorized the AIr Force  to  release  all
information at their disposal to Sobep.
   After having seen this dramatic sequence, I posed a number  of
questions to Col. DeBrouwer. First, could the object have been  a
radiosonde balloon?
   "No, the object acted as if it was totally independent of  the
winds, and we have done, among other things, a complete review of
meteorological  conditions.  This is why we did not  publish  the
report until now. We wanted to do a complete study to verify  all
aspects of the case. Our military defense system is not  prepared
for this sort of thing. We had to analyze and interpret the  data
from the recording inside the fighters."
   Is it a natural phenomenon, or perhaps the debris from rockets
or satellites or space junk? "No, a meteorite or a fragment of  a
rocket  does not enter the atmosphere in a zig zag  fashion.  The
analysis   of  the  radar  traces  showed  numerous  changes   in
direction,   and  the  atmospheric  conditions   that   prevailed
precluded any electromagnetic phenomenon as the cause."
   But  I asked how about the famous F-117 the  American  Stealth
airplane,  which  many  people think may  be  responsible?  "This
airplane is absolutely designed for penetration at low  altitude.
On the other hand it has a minimum speed of 278 KPH and the  UFOs
speed  went down to 40 KPH. The F-117 does not have engines  that
can  be tilted down for very slow speed flight. Also no  airplane
is capable of flying at 1,800 KPH or so low to the ground without
creating a sonic boom."
   Then  he gave me a telex sent by the Military Attache  of  the
U.S.  Ambassador  to  the  Commander of  the  Belgian  Air  Force
confirming  that  the  Stealth airplane was  never  stationed  on
European territory nor did it ever fly over that territory.
   Professor Jean Pierre Petit accompanied me in my visit to  the
Belgian  Air Force Headquarters. He once served as  a  controller
for jet interception exercises. Petit is a senior physicist and a
director  of  research with the National  Center  for  Scientific
Research  of  France. He has recently published a  book  entitled
"Investigation of UFOs," published by Editions Albin Michel,  and
makes this strong statement:
   "In  reality,  there  is  no machine made  by  man  either  an
airplane  or  a  missile that is  capable  of  such  performance.
Specifically, flying at the speed of sound without making a sonic
boom.  What degree of confidence can we place on this  statement?
The  same  as  that  in Astrophysics  connected  with  the  first
detection  of  a  Supernova  in 1987  in  the  Magellanic  Clouds
galactic group. Proof of the existence of this stellar  cataclysm
we  call a Supernova relies on this single unique observation.  I
am  completely  convinced that this type of  UFO  observation  by
radar  has  already happened many times over the  past  30  years
either  by means of the sophisticated radar of the F-16 which  is
typical  of that used by the world's air forces for the past  ten
years or before that by conventional radar.  And those  countries
who have had radar contacts have kept the fact in strict  secrecy
to avoid public panic."
   But  what is happening right now, what is the reason for  this
sudden revelation of the truth?
   "We are living in a time that is the beginning of a period  of
openness. First the Berlin Wall Crumbled, now the wall of silence
about  UFOs  is falling. Concerning the UFOs we  are  entering  a
phase  completely different from the earlier ones. It is the  end
of  commercialism  and fakery. The true  scientists  are  finally
making their appearance. Look at the work of Professor Meesen."
   "Sobeps  has  collected  more  than  one  thousand  eyewitness
reports from the UFO wave over Belgium. One report is  especially
interesting.  On  the  night of March 31, at  a  location  30  KM
southeast of Brussels, three completely reliable witnesses had  a
sighting.  They  were  Lucien  Clerebaut,  Secretary  General  of
Sobeps,  Patrick  Ferrym,  a Moving Picture  Producer,  and  Jose
Fernandez.  They  observed  a bright luminous light  low  on  the
horizon.  The light got bigger and closer, and was seen to be  an
object  of triangular form with rounded angles. It  was  carrying
four  spotlights  and the periphery of the  object  had  numerous
smaller  lights  around it. As it passed over their heads  at  an
altitude which they estimated to be 300 to 400 meters, the object
had  a diameter six times that of a full moon.  Mr.  Ferrym  took
four  pictures  of the object with a very high  sensitivity  film
with  an ASA of 1,600. As a control he photographed  an  ordinary
airplane  several minutes later, using the same  shutter  opening
and speed."
   "When  the film was developed he got a surprise. The  position
lights  of the airplane were clearly shown on the  pictures.  But
the `spotlights' on the UFO, which to the naked eye had been much
stronger   than   the  lights  on  the  airplane,   were   hardly
discernible.  The  general form of the UFO, which had  also  been
clearly  visible, was lost on the film. It should be  noted  that
the UFO was also much closer to the observers than the airplane."
   Recalling  that a simple infrared ray can prevent  some  films
from  being exposed, Professor Meesen performed an experiment  in
his laboratory. Using a prism, he projected directly on unexposed
film a spectrum of light, going from red to purple, superimposing
an infrared ray on the lower part of the negative.  When the film
was developed, the spectrum of light is perfectly visible in  the
portion   of  the  film  untouched  by  the  infrared   ray   but
considerably attenuated, though not completely annihilated, where
the infrared light struck the film."
   The  Professor continued, "If the UFOs are really  a  physical
object,  and if they propagate infrared light, it would be  quite
normal  that photographs would contain some surprises  when  they
were developed. This could include the total disappearance of the
object  that had been observed visually. This would  explain  the
very  low  number of pictures that we have received in  this  UFO
wave as well as the failure to get close up pictures.
   Professor  Meesen  remained  very  conservative.  As  a   good
disciple  of the famous scientist Claude Bernard, he is  faithful
to the Scientific Method, which consists of observing facts, then
proposing   hypotheses   to  explain  the   facts   and   finally
accomplishing experimental verification of the hypotheses. To him
it  is absolutely essential to study this enigmatic file  of  UFO
reports:  "There are too many independent eyewitness  reports  to
ignore.  Too  many  of the  reports  describe  coherent  physical
effects  and there is an agreement among the accounts  concerning
what  was observed. If all of these witnesses are lying, then  it
is a mental disease of such novelty and proportions that it  must
be  studied. But of course there are also physical  effects.  The
Air Force report allows us to approach the problem in a  rational
and  scientific way. The simplest hypothesis is that the  reports
are  caused  by extraterrestrial visitors,  but  that  hypothesis
carries  with it other problems. We are not in a rush to  form  a
conclusion, but also to study the mystery."
   When  I  first  met  Prof. Meesen, he had  not  yet  seen  the
document  that  was shown to me by Col. DeBrouwer. This  was  the
Belgian Air Force report on the successful interceptions of March
30, which allowed us to understand why the military had placed at
the  disposal of Sobep such facilities as the  F-16  interceptors
and a twin engine Hawker airplane. The Hawker could carry a large
number  of researchers  and many measuring devices, including  an
enormous  infrared  camera. During this eventful  weekend,  which
drew in tens of thousands of witnesses, the military had put  top
priority  on the UFO, but was remaining silent.  They  wanted  to
know more before speaking.
   The  press was astonished by the "unsuccessful" hunt  on  this
Easter  weekend.  But it is all clear now. We could not say  that
the  UFO  did  not  actually meet us,  because  there  were  many
observations from the ground. But if the device had stayed  under
200 meters in altitude, it would have been undetectable by radar.
   Now  the sightings have dribbled off, the witnesses rarer  and
rarer.  But  the questions still remain. How  disconcerting  this
wave  of UFO sightings over Belgium! First of all,  why  Belgium?
Why  these  thousands  of witnesses in a  six  month  period?  In
previous decades witnesses often described landings, but why were
there  no landing reports? Why the triangular shape of  the  UFO,
reported by more than 90% of the witnesses? At the moment, all of
these are questions without an answer.
   "For  us, the release of this report by the Belgian Air  Force
and  the confidence in us that it bespeaks is the reward  for  18
years of work," concluded Lucien Clerebaut of Sobeps.
   Regardless of the frustrating irregularity of this  phenomenon
(waves  of  sightings mixed with long periods  of  absence),  and
regardless of the sarcasms of those scientists who are  violently
hostile to this kind of investigation which they consider to be a
sort  of  scientific disease, a few eminent  scientists  such  as
Professors  Meesen,  Brenig and Petit continue  their  methodical
work.
   Now is the time to help them.
