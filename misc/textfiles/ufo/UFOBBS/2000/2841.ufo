Tulsa, Okla. -- Housewife Alice Drommaneyer, 33 ,says she and her husband 
Frank were attacked and mugged by space aliens -- who turned her husband into a 
cockroach!

The distraught young wife says the extraterrestrials assaulted Frank on the 
street and turned him into a bug when he refused to give up his wallet.

"I tried to call in a complaint on 911 but they kept hanging up on me like I 
was a prankster," says Alice, who insists the roach she keeps in a mayonnaise 
jar is actually her husband.

"Frankly, I'm afraid to pursue it because I'm worried they're going to think 
I'm crazy and put me away. Then who's going to take care of Frank?" Alice says 
she contacted WWN because she believes a story about her bizarre experience 
might help ease her plight.

She's hoping other WWN readers who may have been attacked by the same alien 
gang will be willing to contact her to share their experiences. Alice says the 
horrifying crime occurred around 10 p.m. on December 21 while she and Frank 
were shopping for Christmas presents.

The couple were on their way to a parking area where they'd left their car 
when they were accosted by four little green creatures.

"They just popped out of nowhere and blocked our path," Alice recalled.

"They looked so strange, with big eyes and shiny, leathery skin.

"We thought they were going to be friendly, but one of them pulled a gun and 
we knew we were in trouble.

"I gave them my purse right away, but Frank wouldn't cooperate. I begged him 
to give them his wallet, but he thought they were so small he could put up a 
fight."

Alice says the space aliens jumped Frank and beat him, then stole his wallet 
and forced a slimy liquid down his throat.

The E.T. attackers ran off, she says, but it was too late for her husband. He 
began writhing in agony and started shrinking right before her eyes.

Within minutes, the 34 year-old liquor salesman had turned into a cockroach 
approximately two inches long.

Alice says she captured the bug and stashed it in her purse, then put it in a 
mayonnaise jar when she got home. "People think I'm crazy, but I know that bug 
is Frank and I feel strongly that something ought to be done to help him," 
Alice said. "That's why it's so important to me that people who have had this 
happen to them get in touch with me.

"I feel like I can't do anything on my own because nobody will believe me, but 
that together we can make people listen. Then maybe we can find these thugs 
and put them in jail where they belong -- and force them to tell us how to 
bring Frank back to normal."
