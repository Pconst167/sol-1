    JM> And I also don't doubt the information supplied regarding your talk

    That  doesn't jive with The Phoenix report Jack...  here,  I'll let you
    read it again,  and THEN tell me that the report "never,  repeat never,
    stated that the planes in question came out of Beale."

        Memo
        August 12, 1989
        From Staff # 1
        To: Staff # 2
    
          Our  contacts  in the [Air Force] verify that on the  [night]  of
        August 10, 1989,  at the time indicated in Report # 1 of that date,
        that  eight F-4's,  [scrambled from Beale [AFB]],  CA.  They had  a
        brief radar-lock, on a "bogie" in the area described. However, they
        lost  the  target,   [due to ground-] [clutter]  when  it  suddenly
        descended  into the mountainous terrain.  They returned to the base
        when a further sweep of the area proved fruitless.
    
          You're  right,  the [AF] had a blip on their radar,  but lost  it
        when  the ship dropped into that 20-mile approach corridor  between
        the valleys and the radar dead zone.

    [ Each one will be discussed below...     ]

    This  is  a DIRECT quote from the report Jack.  Anyone here  who  saves
    reports like this can verify this for me.
                                                                                
    JM> Nor did it claim whose planes they were.
    
    The Air Force is mentioned 3 times in that one memo alone.
    
    JM> Personally, I would think a F-4 equipped with nose cameras would be
    JM> the ideal craft to be used if there might have been a chance to get
    JM> pictures.
    
    Ideal?                                                                      
    
    First, taking pics of the object with an F-4  is impossible unless they
    take  the  jet pure vertical to take the picture.   Their  cameras  are
    pointed at the ground, not out in front of them. If they wanted to know
    where  the "object"  was going,  THEY WOULDN'T USE AN AIRCRAFT THAT  IS
    SLOWER THAN EVERY OTHER A.F.  INTERCEPTOR!.  The F-4s max speed is Mach
    2.  The F-15's max speed is 2.5! (roughly 350  mph faster than the F-4)
    Also,   for a prolonged chase,  the F-15's range is required,  and  far
    exceeds that of the F-4.  The F-4s,  with drop tanks,  max out at  1978
    miles. The F-15's range is 3,570 miles! (also with drop tanks)
    
    The  F-15  also has the "look-down"  "shoot-down"  radar,  which means,
    unlike the F-4, no target could get "lost" due to ground clutter.
    
    Another  major  problem is that F-4s equipped for low level  recon  fly
    VERY low, like, 100 feet off the deck.
    
                   THEY HAVE -NO- TERRAIN GUIDANCE EQUIPMENT. 
    
    It's entirely "seat-of-the-pants" flying by pilot skill alone. They fly
    and take pictures during daylight hours only!  Which also means, (guess
    what?), THEIR CAMERAS CAN NOT TAKE PHOTOS AT NIGHT!
    
    Your ideal aircraft to send up after a bogie?
    
    Slow, blind, and toothless.
                                                                                
    JM> But my thinking would be that these planes might be more interested
    JM> in where the unknowns went and not what they were.  I  am sure they
    JM> [the  elite forces behind the mystery] have sufficient pictures  of
    JM> alien craft already.
    
    Common  Sense  dictates that,  even if you wanted to  just  "see  where
    they're going,"  the F-15 is the obvious choice. The G'vt could then go
    in  later and take as many detailed hi-alt pics of the area  that  they
    wanted to with the U-2, or the SR-71, with no-one the wiser.
    
    As John Hicks said, I too, have no axe to grind with you or the Phoenix
    Project.   I   -DO-  have an axe ready for deliberate  mis-information.
    Unfortunatly,  I  downloaded this mail after leaving the University  of
    Nevada's  Library.  Consequently,  I  will be preparing another  report
    about the rest of the K-2  claims shortly. I  have to wait for one more
    piece of mail before I can post this report, so please be patient.
    
    JM> If  the  Phoenix Project has anything to say on this topic you  can
    JM> rest assured that I will transmit it. 
    
    Jack Do me a favor Jack, and ask them these questions for me:
                                                                                
    1. How  can  8  F-4s be scrambled from a base that has  NEVER  operated
       fighter aircraft of ANY type?
    
    3. Why   did  the  Phoenix  Project  NOT  follow  standard   scientific
       procedures with regards to their magnatometer readings?  (collect he
       data,   and then -verify-  it by different means.  Thermal  Imaging,
       ground penetrating radar, or ultra-sonics?)
    
       And the biggie...
    
    4. WHY DID THEY WAIT THREE YEARS BEFORE RELEASING THIS REPORT!?
    
       Joe.
