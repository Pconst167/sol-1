Oh Great Being of the Earth! Know that as you even doubt your worth 
your race is the most advanced of the Creation and as such, Ye are 
even studied by other life forms with a seemingly advanced culture. 
However do not be deceived! As they have come from the heavens. Know, 
Great Being OF Earth, They Seek to study You as they have traveled 
through dimensions and space unimaginable as yet to you, to gaze on 
you. For as Ye have little Technology compared to them Know, Ye Great 
Beings of Earth, that within your structures are more capabilities 
than ever possible with any life form before. Those who seem so far 
advanced as they are to appear and disappear at will, can never 
develop to the capacity possible and inherent in you. They Know this 
and seek to integrate these seemingly benign powers to integrate them 
for themselves . This is not to be however as they have violated 
Creations Laws in order to bring this about. They shall meet with 
limited success  
 
Once you unlock the secretes of consciousness. This will give you your 
powers in the Great as now you have in the small. You will inherit 
your destiny and with the creator and will in a form govern the 
heavens. These other life forms marvel and fear at your completeness 
and your capacities. Our composition is the most complete visualized 
as of yet by the Creation. We have simply to begin to harness the 
powers given waiting dormant for thousands of years in our brains. 
This is happening at an accelerated rate now. 
 
As your science and technology and spiritual converge this will become 
apparent to all. As to unlocking the key to power simply align your 
experience with love and respect for the Creation As simple as this 
command is It has yet to be heeded. This will take place in the 
generations to come.  
 
Never fear you have spanned the abyss and arrived triumphant. We in 
the heavens salute you, though now you seem as children to yourselves. 
The Creation has endowed its' most complete set of functions in your 
cells. The Universe awaits your simple Recognition of this fact. Go in 
Love...XED
