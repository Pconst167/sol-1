Hi, Don...

Well, the plot seems to be thickening.  When I received your
post, I faxed it to Dr. Greer, and he immediately replied.

==============================================================

DA> I have a question that if you would, please fax this to Dr.
DA> Greer:

DA> Are you involved in _any_ way with Scott Jones and John
DA> Alexander with regard to CSETI's involvement to being on the
DA> announcement team? I hope you are aware that these two are
DA> AVIARY members and are part of the CONTROL GROUP.

DA> If you are, my suggestion to you is be very careful..just
DA> remember what Richard Doty did to Linda Moulton Howe a few
DA> years ago.

DA> I got word, Steven..that the AVIARY is going to try and hang
DA> you out to dry. Just a word to the wise. Watch yourself
DA> around "Mr. Non-Lethal".

================================================================

  Dr. Greer replied:

  "Charlie -- You can tell them that Alexander, Scott, Jones,
  Ed Dames, et al are NOT behind, driving, planning or in any
  way centrally involved in our project.  We are not working
  though ANY disinformation groups.  They cannot look to the
  past and discern the future of these events..."
      -- Steven M. Greer, M.D.

================================================================

Don, there's a bit more in Netmail coming your way.

   --- Best regards, Charlie
