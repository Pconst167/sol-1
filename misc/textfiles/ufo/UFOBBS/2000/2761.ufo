    OFFICE MEMORANDUM - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
    
    TO     :  D. M. LADD                            DATE: 7/10/47
    FROM   :  E. G. Fitch
    SUBJECT:  FLYING DISKS
    
    At  request  of Brigadier General George F.  Schulgen,   Chief  of  the 
    Requirements  Intelligence  Branch  of  Army  Air  Corps  Intelligence, 
    Special Agent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx discussed the above captioned matter  with 
    him  on July 9,  1947.  General Schulgen indicated to xxxxxxxxxxxx that 
    the  Air  Corps  has  taken the attitude  that  every  effort  must  be 
    undertaken in order to run down and ascertain whether or not the flying 
    disks  are a fact and,  if so,  to learn all about them.  According  to 
    General Schulgen, the Air Corps Intelligence are utilizing all of their 
    scientists in order to ascertain whether or not such a phenomenon could 
    in fact occur. He stated that this research is being conducted with the 
    thought  that  the flying objects might be a celestial  phenomenon  and 
    with  the view that they might be a foreign body  mechanically  devised 
    and controlled. 
    
    General Schulgen also indicated to Mr.  xxxxxxxxxxx that all Air  Corps 
    installations  have  been alerted to run out each reported sighting  to 
    obtain  all  possible  data  to assist in this  research  project.   In 
    passing,   General Schulgen stated that an Air Corps pilot who believed 
    that he saw one of these objects was thoroughly interrogated by General 
    Schulgen and scientists,  as well as a psychologist,  and the pilot was 
    adamant in his claim that he saw a flying disk. 
    
    General Schulgen advised Mr. xxxxxxxxx that the possibility exists that 
    the  first  reported  sighting  of  the  so-called  flying  disks  were 
    fallacious and prompted by individuals seeking personal publicity,   or 
    were  reported for political reasons.  He stated that if this  was  so, 
    subsequent sightings might be the result of a mass hysteria. He pointed 
    out  that  the thought exists that the first reported  sightings  might 
    have  been  by  individuals of Communist sympathies with  the  view  to 
    causing hysteria and fear of a secret Russian weapon. 
    
    General  Schulgen  indicated to Mr.  xxxxxxxxxx that he is desirous  of 
    having all the angles covered in this matter. He stated that reports of 
    his scientists and findings of the various Air Corps installations will 
    be available in his office.  He advised that to complete the picture he 
    desired  the  assistance  of  the Federal Bureau  of  Investigation  in 
    locating  and  questioning the individuals who first  sighted  the  so-
    called  flying  disks  in order to ascertain whether or  not  they  are 
    sincere in their statements that they saw these disks, or whether their 
    statements were prompted by personal desire for publicity or  political 
    reasons.   General Schulgen assured Mr.  xxxxxxxx that there are no War 
    Department   or  Navy  Department  research  projects  presently  being 
    conducted  which  could in any way be tied up with  the  flying  disks. 
    General  Schulgen indicated to Mr.  xxxxxxxx that if the  Bureau  would 
    cooperate with him in this matter, he would offer all the facilities of 
    his  office  as to results obtained in the effort to identify  and  run 
    down this matter. 
    
    Mr.  xxxxxxxxxx advised General Schulgen that his request would be made 
    known  to  the  Bureau and an answer made available to him as  soon  as 
    possible. 
    
    ------------
    Memorandum for Mr. Ladd
    
    Mr.  xxxxxxxx also discussed this matter with Colonel L.  H.  Forney of 
    MID. Colonel Forney indicated that it was his attitude that inasmuch as 
    it has been established that the flying disks are not the result of any 
    Army or Navy experi-  ments,  the matter is of interest to the FBI.  He 
    stated that he was of the opinion that the Bureau,  if at all possible, 
    should accede to General Schulgen's request.

    ADDENDUM
    
    I  would  recommend  that we advise the Army that the Bureau  does  not 
    believe  it should go into these investigations,  it being noted that a 
    great  bulk of those alleged discs reported found have been pranks.  It 
    is not believed that the Bureau would accomplish anything by going into 
    these investigations. 
    
                                                                  DML
    
    (Clyde Tolson) - I think we should do this. [Handwritten, dated 7/15]
    
    (J.  Edgar Hoover)  -  I  would do it but before agreeing to it we must 
    insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the SW case 
    the  Army  grabbed  it  and  would not  let  us  have  it  for  cursory 
    examination.
