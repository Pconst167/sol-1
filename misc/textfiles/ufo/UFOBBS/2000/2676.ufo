    The Underground City Near Cadiz.
    
      I have been asked to put down some information about the city that is 
    underground just outside of Barstow and Needles, Calif. 
    
      Many  years ago I communicated by letter to an ex-service man in  San 
    Diego,  Calif.  by the name of Earl Gambrel. I  can speak freely of him 
    because  both he and his wife are now dead.  He was in World War II and 
    told me about a time when he was sleeping in his camper beside the left 
    hand  side of the road about 5 miles outside of Barstow about one  half 
    mile  over  towards the railroad tracks.  While he was  in  his  pickup 
    camper asleep he was transported by a space craft over 40 miles and put 
    down  in an area just 2 miles NW of Bonanza Springs which is  about  13 
    miles  from  Cadiz,   Calif.  This area was just south of  the  Clipper 
    Mountains.   His  camper was put down in an area that didn't  have  any 
    roads  going  to  the spot and he even had to get out  and  move  large 
    stones  so he could get his truck out of the area.  He finally made  it 
    back to San Diego but it took him quite a while to recover his health. 
    
      After that time he started to communicate with the people in the UFOs 
    by ESP.  They directed him back out into the area and he walked over in 
    the  Clipper Mountain area to a place where he found a cave  or  tunnel 
    entrance  into the ground in the side of a hill.  The area is near  the 
    same  spot where you can see a needle (an area where the earth makes  a 
    sort of a natural bridge that you can walk through like you see in some 
    other  states except this one is just big enough for a normal person to 
    walk  through).   There is also a mountain peak in the area that  looks 
    like it has a black stone railroad car on top of it.  As he walked into 
    this  cave  he noticed that it went down at about a 30   degree  angle. 
    After  quite a while he came into a city with houses and street.  About 
    the  only  thing  of value was that in some of the  houses  there  were 
    stones  of  a high grade of crystal nearly as large and  as  pretty  as 
    diamonds.  He felt that these cystals were made in the same was as  the 
    Jewels of the Gods as the American Indians of the area call the cystals 
    that  are found in the ground when a space craft comes over a piece  of 
    land, discharges it's electricity into the ground,  heating up the soil 
    and  thus forming a sort of jewel from the heated soil and  rock.   The 
    Indians of the region value them very much. 
    
      After  coming  out of the area he found out that another  person  had 
    found the area and had told the world about it and he was killed.   The 
    story  then gets pretty far out by warning about what would happens  to 
    people who go into the area but I didn't put much value in that part of 
    the thing 
    
    End Part 1.
