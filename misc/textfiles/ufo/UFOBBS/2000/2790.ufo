    Re: Where is Valentich
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello All!

    Whilst  this is a home grown sighting,  there has been much written  on 
    the Valentich disappearance on 21 October 1978.  Up to now most of what 
    I  have read has been from papers and the occasional debate by the  UFO 
    community.   I   understand that Richard Haines did write a book  ?'The 
    Melbourne Incident' but I have not been able to get hold of this. 
     
    I  have  just  been reading a commentary  by  British  Ufologist  Nigal 
    Watson.   Watson  is noted for his sober reporting of UFO  events.   He 
    raised  a  number  of points that I was not aware of and I  would  like 
    others to comment on this. 
     
    a.   Frederick filed only a one-way flight plan to King Island although 
    he had indicated his intention to return the same evening. 
     
    b.  He made no arrangements for the landing lights at King Island to be 
    turned on. 
     
    c. Police found no one who had arranged to sell crayfish to Frederick - 
    the stating intention for his flight. 
     
    d.   The  aircrafts long range fuel tank was filled to its  303   litre 
    capacity. 
     
    e.   Cape  Otway lighthouse keepers and Bass Strait fishermen  did  not 
    report seeing any light aircraft in the vicinity. 
     
    f.   Despite ideal conditions,  at no time was the aircraft plotted  on 
    radar. 
     
    g.   Melbourne  Police received reports of a light  aircraft  making  a 
    mysterious  landing  not  far  from  Cape Otway at  the  same  time  as 
    Valentich's disappearance. 
     
    h.   Although Bass Strait - and later Cape Otway and King Island - were 
    searched for signs of wreckage, nothing was found. 
     
    i. He had $300 cash on his person. (A lot of money in '78) 
     
    j.  He arranged to meet his girlfriend,  Ms Rushton on the same evening 
    at 7.30pm - a date he couldn't have possibly kept. 
     
    k.   Frederick's  father  claimed that,  8  or 10   months  before  his 
    disappearance"   'My  son told me he had seen a large  brilliantly  lit 
    object  in the western sky which was flying at a tremendous speed  from 
    south to north'.  His father also stated that Frederick firmly believed 
    in the existence of UFO's.  Yet no mention was made of a UFO during his 
    last radio communication. 
     
    l. On the tape recording of the last conversation with the young pilot, 
    there was no hint of panic in his voice. 
     
    The above points seem to have been forgotten by the many ufologist that 
    have discussed Frederick's "Abduction" 
     
    So what did happen to Valentich and why.  It is not unknown for  people 
    to  disappear for no apparent reason and later to assume to totally new 
    identity.   There  are many disappearances and we cannot and  must  not 
    assume that UFO's and ET's are responsible. 
     
    I would like some comments on the above. 
     
    Bob...
