Here are some CIA,FBI,and Secret Service radio Frequencies

CIA: 163.81     165.01     165.11     165.385      408.60

FBI: 167.40     164.46     167.395    406.35       163.31

S.S: 163.40     163.81     165.025    171.235      165.90

Remember, they have Ultrasonic Adaptor Transmitter trackers
so you are risking your balls if you use any of those but
as long as you only receive, and don't transmit, you'll be fine.

NSA freqs are available (Be careful) but most throughput
is encrypted. (You will need a J-DES box )

CIA: 165.01 had some interesting tidbits related to
this echo the other night.
