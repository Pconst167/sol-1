     The variety of highly classified "black world" aircraft has prompted
industry experts to suggest that the term "Aurora," which has been used in
reference to a purported new classified hypersonic aircraft, may be
inappropriate. Instead, Aurora may be one of several code names, all
referring to a class of aircraft designed for multiple missions.

     A line item identified as "Aurora" in a Fiscal 1986 Procurement Program
document dated Feb. 4, 1985, supposedly was simply one "site" for B-2 bomber
funds when that program was highly classified, according to a government
official. Listed under the "Other Aircraft" category, "Aurora" was projected
to receive sharply increased funding. The Fiscal 1986 budget request for
Aurora - $80.1 million - jumped to $2.272 billion in Fiscal 1987, according
to the document.

     ...Several of the secret aircraft believed to be based in Nevada may be
experimental or prototypes. At least one type has advanced to the production
and deployment phases, and may be capable of hypersonic flight, according to
officials who have been closely associated with classified programs at
several Nevada test sites in recent years. One senior official said, "We
don't really do anything strictly for experimental reasons. There's usually
an operational twist." Several of these people had hands-on experience with a
number of the classified vehicles.

     Although prevented from discussing specific projects, these individuals
said, "There are bigger and better things out there," referring to aircraft
based at the Nevada test locations...
