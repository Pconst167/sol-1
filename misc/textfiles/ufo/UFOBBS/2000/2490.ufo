    Re:   Budd Hopkins' case of the abduction of Linda Napolitano


    Enclosed  is our report on the much acclaimed case of the UFO  abduction 
    of Linda Napolitano. We invite your comments. 
     
     
    Hopkins'   claims  have  generated  enormous  publicity  and  have  been 
    mentioned  in the New York Times,  Omni,  the Wall Street Journal,   and 
    Paris    Match,     among others. As such, this case is likely to have a 
    substantial impact on the field of ufology. 
     
     
    Leadership in both the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and the J. Allen Hynek 
    Center  for UFO Studies (CUFOS)  aggressively opposed our investigation, 
    and both previously refused to publish our criticisms. This raises grave 
    questions  about the scientific and journalistic integrity of MUFON  and 
    CUFOS. 
     
     
    Those organizations have many members, and we are unable to provide more 
    than  a few copies of this paper to others.  We ask you to help us  with 
    the distribution.  Please feel free to make copies of this article, post 
    it on electronic bulletin boards, and print it in periodicals. 
     
     
              A Critique of Budd Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction

    ABSTRACT:   Budd Hopkins has made a number of public presentations of  a 
    purported  UFO  abduction  case with multiple  witnesses.   The  primary 
    abductee is Linda Napolitano,  who lives in an apartment building on the 
    lower  east  side  of Manhattan (New York City). She claims to have been 
    abducted  by  extraterrestrial aliens from her 12th floor  apartment  in 
    November  1989.   It is claimed that three witnesses in a car two blocks 
    away observed  Linda  and  alien beings float out of a window and ascend 
    into a craft.  One  alleged witness was United Nations Secretary General 
    Javier Perez de Cuellar. It is also claimed that a woman on the Brooklyn 
    Bridge observed the abduction.   Linda has reported nose bleeds, and one 
    X-ray displays an implant in her nose. 
     
    To date,  Hopkins has provided no full, detailed written report,  but he 
    did  publish a couple five page articles in the September  and  December 
    1992 issues of the Mufon UFO Journal and made a presentation at the 1992 
    MUFON symposium. We have made use of that information as well as records 
    from other presentations, and we have interviewed the abductee. A number 
    of       serious questions arose from our examination. The case has many 
    exotic aspects,  and we have identified a science fiction novel that may 
    have served as the basis for elements of the story. 
     
    Several  prominent  leaders in ufology have become involved,  and  their 
    behavior and statements have been quite curious.  Some have aggressively 
    attempted  to  suppress evidence of a purported attempted  murder.   The 
    implications for the understanding of ufology are discussed. 
     
    Budd Hopkins is the person most responsible for drawing attention to the 
    problem of the extraterrestrial (ET)  abduction experience.  His efforts 
    have   been  instrumental  in  stimulating  both  media  attention   and 
    scientific  research devoted to the problem.  He has written two popular 
    books         (Missing Time, 1981, and Intruders, 1987), established the 
    Intruders      Foundation,       and has made innumerable appearances at 
    conferences and in the media. 
     
    Although  Hopkins  is neither a trained therapist,  an academic,  nor  a 
    scientist, he has involved such people in his work. John E. Mack,  M.D., 
    a  Pulitzer Prize winner and former head of the psychiatry department at 
    Harvard Medical School,  has praised Hopkins'  work and acknowledged his 
    indebtedness to him (Mack, 1992a, 1992b).  Hopkins has collaborated with 
    university  professors  in co-authoring an article in the  book  Unusual 
    Personal  Experiences (1992),  which was sent to 100,000  mental  health 
    professionals.   He  has  testified as an expert witness  at  a  hearing 
    regarding  the medical competence of a physician who claims to have been 
    abducted  (McKenna,   1992).   Because of such strong  endorsements  and 
    impressive  affiliations,  and because of his untiring work on behalf of 
    abductees,  Hopkins has become the single most visible figure in the UFO 
    abduction  field.   His contributions,  positive or negative,   will  be 
    quickly noticed by those inside and outside ufology. 
     
    Last  year,   Hopkins  made  a number of public  presentations  about  a 
    spectacular  UFO  abduction case occurring in November 1989  and  having 
    multiple   witnesses. The primary abductee was Linda Napolitano, a woman 
    living  on   the  12th  floor of a high-rise apartment building in lower 
    Manhattan  (New York City)  [Hopkins has previously used  the  pseudonym 
    "Linda Cortile"   in this case]. It is claimed that three witnesses in a 
    car  two  blocks  away  observed Linda and three ET aliens emerge from a 
    window and ascend  into a craft.  Further it is claimed that a woman who 
    was driving across the Brooklyn Bridge also saw the event. 
     
    The  case  has  generated  enormous  interest  and  drawn  international 
    attention.  It has been discussed in the Wall Street Journal (Jefferson, 
    1992), Omni (Baskin, 1992), Paris Match (De Brosses, 1992), the New York 
    Times    (Sontag, 1992), and Hopkins and Napolitano have appeared on the 
    television    show Inside Edition. The Mufon UFO Journal labeled it "The 
    Abduction Case  of  the Century" (Stacy, 1992, p. 9). Even the technical 
    magazine      ADVANCE     for Radiologic Science Professionals carried a 
    discussion  of  Linda's nasal implant (Hatfield, 1992). We should expect 
    continuing coverage  of the affair not only in the UFO press but also in 
    the major media. 
     
    In a short article previewing his 1992 MUFON symposium presentation,  he 
    wrote:   "I  will be presenting what I believe to be the most  important 
    case  for  establishing the objective reality of UFO abductions  that  I 
    have yet encountered"  (Hopkins, 1992, p. 20). During his lecture at the 
    symposium he stated: "This is probably the most important case I've ever 
    run into in my life" (tape recorded, July 1992). In his abstract for the 
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology Abduction Study Conference held in 
    June      1992       he wrote: "The importance of this case is virtually 
    immeasurable,   as it powerfully supports both the objective reality  of 
    UFO abductions  and the accuracy of regressive hypnosis as employed with 
    this    abductee."     Because    of Hopkins' renown, and because of his 
    evaluation, this case warrants our careful scrutiny. 
     
     
    THE AUTHORS' INVOLVEMENT 
     
     
    The  first two authors had learned of the case before Hopkins had spoken 
    publicly of it, and they decided to monitor its progress. They regularly 
    briefed  the  third author as their investigation  progressed.   As  the 
    affair became publicized, all three became concerned about the long term 
    effect it might have on abduction research. 
     
    For  several  years Richard Butler attended Hopkins'  informal  meetings 
    organized  for  abductees  and  abduction  researchers.   Butler  became 
    familiar with the case during those meetings,  and he invited Stefula to 
    a  gathering in early October 1991. At the meeting, Hopkins outlined the 
    case,   and afterward, Stefula had a chance to chat with Linda about her 
    experiences.  Butler and Stefula gave Linda their telephone numbers. She 
    was   advised  that if she needed any assistance she could contact them. 
    Stefula told  her that he had numerous contacts in federal and state law 
    enforcement  agencies  that could be of aid to her. The same information 
    was provided to Hopkins. 
     
    On January 28, 1992, Linda requested a meeting with Richard Butler,  and 
    on February 1, 1992, Linda, Stefula and Butler met in New York City, and 
    Linda  provided  additional  details about  her  experiences  (described 
    below).   During that meeting,  she asked them not to inform Hopkins  of 
    their   discussions.    At the 1992 MUFON convention in Albuquerque, New 
    Mexico  in   July,    both  Hopkins and Linda appeared on the podium and 
    presented the case.  Stefula attended the convention and heard the talk, 
    and  disturbing   questions   arose.    Some  of the statements directly 
    contradicted  what  Linda   had   earlier  told  Stefula  and Butler. We 
    contacted  Hopkins  in  an attempt to resolve  these  matters,   but  he 
    declined to meet with us, saying that he didn't want to discuss the case 
    until his book manuscript was submitted. Despite his initial reluctance, 
    eventually a meeting was arranged on October 3,  1992 at Hopkins'  home, 
    and a few more details then emerged. 
     
    
    SUMMARY OF CASE 
     
    In order to compile this summary of alleged events,  we have relied upon 
    Hopkins' and Linda's talks from the podium of the 1992  MUFON symposium, 
    on our interviews with Linda,  on Hopkins'  talk at the Portsmouth,  New 
    Hampshire UFO conference, September 13, 1992, and Hopkins' two five-page 
    articles in the September and December issues of the Mufon UFO Journal. 
     
    In  April  1989   Hopkins received a letter from  Linda  Napolitano,   a 
    resident  of New York City.  Linda wrote that she had begun reading  his 
    book Intruders and had remembered that 13 years earlier she had detected 
    a  bump  next  to  her nose. It was examined by a physician who insisted 
    that  she  had undergone nasal surgery. Linda claimed that she never had 
    such surgery,   and she even checked with her mother, who confirmed that 
    impression. 
     
    Hopkins  took an interest in the case because there was a potential  for 
    medical  evidence and because Linda lived relatively close  to  Hopkins, 
    which facilitated their meeting. Linda visited Hopkins and discussed her 
    past experiences with him. She recalled some pertinent earlier events in 
    her  life but believed that she was no longer directly involved with any 
    abduction  phenomena.  Linda then began attending meetings  of  Hopkins' 
    support group for abductees. 
     
    On  November 30,  1989,  Linda called Hopkins and reported that she  had 
    been  abducted  during  the early morning hours of that  day,   and  she 
    provided  some  details.  A  few days later,  she  underwent  regressive 
    hypnosis,  and Linda remembered floating out of her apartment window, 12 
    stories above the ground.  She recalled ascending in a bluish-white beam 
    of light into a craft which was hovering over the building. 
     
     
    Richard and Dan 
     
    Over a year later (February 1991), Hopkins received a letter signed with 
    the  first  names,   Richard and Dan.  (We have no  hard  evidence  that 
    "Richard"  and "Dan" actually exist. In order to avoid overburdening the 
    reader, we will typically omit the word "alleged" when mentioning them.) 
    The    letter   claimed that the two were police officers who were under 
    cover in a car beneath the elevated FDR Drive between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. 
    in  late   November   1989.   Above a high-rise apartment building, they 
    observed a large,  bright reddish-orange object with green lights around 
    its side.  They wrote  that they saw a woman and several strange figures 
    float out a  window  and  up  into the object. Richard and Dan said that 
    they had come  across  Hopkins'   name and decided to write to him. They 
    went on to say that  they were extremely concerned about her well being, 
    wanted to locate the woman,   talk to  her,  and be assured that she was 
    alive  and  safe.  The two also mentioned that they could  identify  the 
    building and window from which she emerged. 
     
    After  receiving the letter,  Hopkins promptly called Linda and told her 
    that  she might expect a visit from two policemen.  A  few  days  later, 
    Linda  telephoned  Hopkins  to  tell him that she had  been  visited  by 
    Richard      and     Dan. When they had knocked on her door, introducing 
    themselves  as police officers,  she was not too surprized  because  she 
    reports that police frequently canvass her apartment complex looking for 
    witnesses  to  crimes. Even with Hopkins' prior call, she did not expect 
    Richard  and Dan to actually appear.  After they arrived and entered her 
    home,   there  was an emotional greeting, and they expressed relief that 
    she was alive. However, Richard and Dan were disinclined to meet with or 
    talk to Hopkins,  despite the fact that they had written him earlier and 
    despite   Linda's   entreaties   to do so. Richard asked Linda if it was 
    acceptable for them to write out an account of their experience and then 
    read it  into  a  tape  recorder.   She agreed, and a couple weeks later 
    Hopkins   received   a   tape   recording  from Richard describing their 
    experience. 
     
    Some  time thereafter,  Hopkins received a letter from Dan giving a  bit 
    more information.  The letter reported that Richard had taken a leave of 
    absence  because the close encounter had been so emotionally  traumatic. 
    Dan            also mentioned that Richard secretly watched Linda. (This 
    information     is     from Hopkins' oral presentation at the 1992 MUFON 
    symposium in  Albuquerque.  At the Portsmouth, New Hampshire conference, 
    Hopkins said that  he had received a letter from Richard saying that Dan 
    was  forced  to  take of leave of absence.  It is not clear  if  Hopkins 
    misspoke at  some  point,   or  whether  both individuals took leaves of 
    absence.) 
     
    Hopkins received another letter from Dan which said that he and  Richard 
    were  not really police officers but actually security officers who  had 
    been driving a very important person (VIP)  to a helicopter pad in lower 
    Manhattan when the sighting occurred.  The letter claimed that their car 
    stalled,  and Richard had pushed it,  parking it beneath the FDR  Drive. 
    According to Dan, the VIP had also witnessed the abduction event and had 
    become hysterical. 
     
     
    The Kidnappings 
     
    Linda  claimed  that in April of 1991  she encountered  Richard  on  the 
    street near her apartment.  She was asked to get into a car that Dan was 
    driving, but she refused. Richard picked her up and, with some struggle, 
    forced her into the vehicle.  Linda reported that she was driven  around 
    for  3   1/2 hours, interrogated about the aliens, and asked whether she 
    worked  for  the government. She also said that she was forced to remove 
    her shoes so they could examine her feet to determine whether she was an 
    ET alien  (they later claimed that aliens lack toes). Linda did remember 
    another  car  being involved with the kidnapping,   and  under  hypnotic 
    regression she recalled the license plate number of that car, as well as 
    part of the  number  of  the car in which she rode. Hopkins reports that 
    the  numbers   have   been  traced  to particular "agencies" (he gave no 
    further details). 
     
    At  the  MUFON  symposium,   Linda was asked if  she  had  reported  the 
    kidnapping  to the police.  She said that she had not and went on to say 
    that  the  kidnapping  was  legal because it had  to  do  with  national 
    security. 
     
    In conversations with Butler in early 1992, Linda had expressed concerns 
    about her personal safety.  A  meeting was arranged with Stefula because 
    of  his  background in law enforcement.  During the afternoon and  early 
    evening  of  February  1,  the three met in New York  City,   and  Linda 
    described further details of the kidnappings. 
     
    She reported that on the morning of October 15,  1991,  Dan accosted her 
    on  the  street  and  pulled her into a red Jaguar  sports  car.   Linda 
    happened  to be carrying a tape recorder and was able to surreptitiously 
    record   a  few minutes of Dan's questioning, but he soon discovered and 
    confiscated it.  Dan drove to a beach house on the shore of Long Island. 
    There    he    demanded that Linda remove her clothes and put on a white 
    nightgown,  similar  to  the one she wore the night of the abduction. He 
    said he wanted  to have sex with her. She refused but then agreed to put 
    on  the  nightgown  over  her  clothes. Once she did, Dan dropped to his 
    knees and started  to talk incoherently about her being the "Lady of the 
    Sands."  She fled the  beach house,  but Dan caught her on the beach and 
    bent her arm behind her.  He placed two fingers on the back of her neck, 
    leading Linda to believe that it was a gun.  He then forced her into the 
    water   and  pushed  her  head  under  twice.   He  continued  to   rave 
    incoherently, and as her head was being pushed under for the third time, 
    she believed that she would not come up again.  Then,  a "force" hit Dan 
    and knocked him back onto  the  beach.   She  started to run but heard a 
    sound  like  a gun being cocked.  She looked back and saw Dan  taking  a 
    picture  of  her  (Linda mentioned that pictures  from  the  beach  were 
    eventually sent to Hopkins). She continued running, but Richard appeared 
    beside her,  seemingly out of nowhere.  He stopped her and convinced her 
    to  return  to the beach house and told her that he would control Dan by 
    giving  him  a  Mickey Finn. She agreed. Once inside, Richard put Dan in 
    the shower  to wash off the mud and sand from the beach. This gave Linda 
    a  chance  to   search  the premises; she recovered her casette tape and 
    discovered stationery bearing a Central Intelligence Agency letterhead. 
     
    In  a brief conversation on October 3,  1992,  Hopkins told Hansen  that 
    Linda  came to him shortly after she arrived back in Manhattan after the 
    kidnapping.   She  was  disheveled,   had sand in  her  hair,   and  was 
    traumatized by the experience. 
     
     
    Further Contacts with Richard and Dan 
     
    During  the February 1 meeting with Butler and Stefula,  Linda  reported 
    that she had met Richard outside a Manhattan bank on November 21,  1991. 
    He  told  her  of  Dan's deteriorating  mental  condition.   During  the 
    Christmas season, Linda received a card and a three page letter from Dan 
    (dated    12/14/91). The letter bore a United Nations stamp and postmark 
    (the UN  building  in  New York has a post office which anyone can use). 
    Dan wrote that  he  was in a mental institution and was kept sedated. He 
    expressed   a   strong   romantic interest in Linda. Some of his remarks 
    suggested that he wanted to kidnap her, take her out of the country, and 
    marry her;  Linda  seemed alarmed by this (she gave a copy of the letter 
    to Stefula and Butler). 
     
    Linda also asserted that on December 15  and December 16,  1991,  one of 
    the men had tried to make contact with her near the shopping area of the 
    South  Street  Seaport.  He was driving a large black sedan  with  Saudi 
    Arabian  United Nations license plates.  During the first incident,   to 
    avoid    him, Linda reported that she went into a shop. The second day a 
    similar  thing happened, and she stood next to some businessmen until he 
    left the area. 
     
     
    The Third Man 
     
    At the February 1 meeting,  Linda mentioned that Hopkins had received  a 
    letter from "the third man" (the VIP), and she was able to repeat entire 
    sentences from this letter, seemingly verbatim.  It discussed ecological 
    danger  to the planet,  and Linda indicated that aliens were involved in 
    ending the Cold War.  The letter ended with a warning to Hopkins to stop 
    searching  for "the third man"  because it could potentially do harm  to 
    world peace. 
     
    Linda  also related a few more details of her November 1989   abduction. 
    She said that the men in the car had felt a strong vibration at the time 
    of  the  sighting.   Linda  also claimed  that  in  subsequent  hypnotic 
    regressions  she recalled being on a beach with Dan,  Richard,  and  the 
    third man,   and she thought somehow she was being used by the aliens to 
    control the  men.  She communicated with the men telepathically and said 
    that  she  felt  that  she  had known Richard prior to the November 1989 
    abduction,   and   she   suggested  that they possibly had been abducted 
    together previously.   We  also  learned that the third man was actually 
    Javier Perez de Cuellar,   at  that time Secretary General of the United 
    Nations. Linda claimed that the various vehicles used in her kidnappings 
    had been traced to several countries' missions at the UN. 
     
    At the Portsmouth,  New Hampshire conference, Hopkins spoke of the third 
    man  saying:  "I am trying to do what I can to shame this person to come 
    forward." 
     
     
    Witness on the Brooklyn Bridge 
     
    In  the  summer  of 1991,  a  year and a half after the  UFO  abduction, 
    Hopkins  received  a  letter from a woman who  is  a  retired  telephone 
    operator  from Putnam County, New York (Hopkins has given this woman the 
    pseudonym  of  Janet Kimble). Hopkins did not bother to open the letter, 
    and in  November  1991,   he received another one from her marked on the 
    outside "CONFIDENTIAL, RE: BROOKLYN BRIDGE." The odd outside marking and 
    the  fact   that   she  had  written two letters, seem to have raised no 
    suspicions in Hopkins' mind.  The woman, a widow of about sixty, claimed 
    to have been driving  on  the Brooklyn Bridge at 3:16 a.m., November 30, 
    1989. She reported that her car stopped and the lights went out. She too 
    saw a large, brightly lit object over a building; in fact, the light was 
    so bright that she was  forced to shield her eyes, though she was over a 
    quarter mile  away.   Nevertheless,   she  claimed to have observed four 
    figures   in  fetal  positions  emerge  from  a  window.   The   figures 
    simultaneously uncurled and then moved up into the craft. Ms. Kimble was 
    quite  frightened  by  the event,  and people in cars  behind  her  were 
    "running all around their cars with theirs (sic)  hands on their  heads, 
    screaming from horror and disbelief"  (quoted in Hopkins, 1992d, p.  7). 
    She wrote: "I have never traveled back to New York City after what I saw 
    and I  never will again, for any reason" (Hopkins, 1992d, p. 5). Despite 
    her intense  fear and all the commotion, she had the presence of mind to 
    rummage  through  her  purse to find her cigarette lighter to illuminate 
    her watch in order to determine the time. 
     
    Hopkins  has  interviewed this woman in person and over the phone.   The 
    woman  claimed to have obtained his name in a bookstore;  she called the 
    Manhattan  directory assistance for his telephone number and then looked 
    up   his  address in the Manhattan White Pages. She alleges that she was 
    reticent       about speaking of the incident and had only told her son, 
    daughter, sister, and brother-in-law about the event. 
     
     
    The Nasal X-ray 
     
    In November 1991 a doctor,  whom Hopkins describes as "closely connected 
    with  Linda,"  took an X-ray of Linda's head because she knew about  the 
    story  of  the nasal implant and because Linda frequently spoke  of  the 
    problem  with   her nose. The X-ray was not developed immediately. A few 
    days   later   the   doctor brought it to Linda but was very nervous and 
    unwilling to  discuss  it.  Linda took it to Hopkins, who showed it to a 
    neurosurgeon friend of his.  The neurosurgeon was astounded; a sizeable, 
    clearly non-natural  object could be seen in the nasal area. Hopkins has 
    shown a slide of  the X-ray during his presentations, and the implant is 
    strikingly  apparent,  even to a lay audience.  The object has  a  shaft 
    approximately 1/4 inch long with a curly-cue wire structure on each end. 
     
     
    Other Unusual Aspects of the Case 
     
    During  our  meeting with Linda on February 1,  she gave  us  additional 
    miscellaneous  details that might be pertinent.  We were told  that  she 
    believed  that she was under surveillance and described a light  silver-
    gray van that had parked near her apartment.  She also claimed that  she 
    had  once been a professional singer and the lead on a hit record,   but 
    she    had     lost her singing voice one day while in the shower. Linda 
    mentioned   that   she  was given to understand that her blood was quite 
    unusual. A doctor had informed her that her red blood cells did not die, 
    but instead they rejuvenated.  She wondered whether this might be due to 
    an alien influence;   some time later she attempted to locate the doctor 
    but was unable to  do  so.   Linda seemed to imply that she now believed 
    that she was part alien or somehow worked with the aliens. 
     
    Linda also told us that she had an agreement with Budd Hopkins to  split 
    equally any profits from a book on the case. 
     
     
    INITIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE CASE 
     
    There  are  a  number of obvious but  unanswered  questions  that  raise 
    immediate doubts about the credibility of the case. 
     
    The   most   serious  problem  is  that  the  three  alleged   principal 
    corroborating witnesses (Richard,  Dan,  and Perez de Cuellar)  have not 
    been   interviewed face- to-face by Hopkins, although it has been over a 
    year and a  half since initial contact with Hopkins and over three years 
    since the abduction. 
     
    Richard  and  Dan allegedly met with Linda and have written  letters  to 
    Hopkins. Linda has a picture of Dan. Yet Dan and Richard refuse to speak 
    directly  with Hopkins.  No hard evidence confirms that Richard and  Dan 
    even exist. 
     
    Though  they initially expressed extreme concern over the well being  of 
    Linda,  the alleged "Dan"  and "Richard"  waited more than a year before 
    contacting Linda and Hopkins.  Why? Furthermore,  they contacted Hopkins 
    before they visited Linda. How did this come about? After all, they knew 
    the location of Linda's apartment, so it would seem that they would have 
    had no reason to contact Hopkins. Why did they bother with him at all? 
     
    The  woman  on the bridge said that before contacting Hopkins  she  only 
    discussed the matter with her son, daughter,  sister and brother-in-law. 
    Why  didn't she contact other UFO investigators?  Why only Hopkins?   If 
    there  is  some  unclear reporting on this point and  she  did  actually 
    contact   others, can such be verified? Has there been any investigation 
    of this  woman  such as checking with her neighbors, friends, family, or 
    previous     employers? What is her background? Has she had any previous 
    relationship   with  Linda? These questions have not been addressed, and 
    thus the  credibility  of  the only directly interviewed, corroborating, 
    first-hand witness remains in doubt. 
     
    Dan  has  spent time in a mental institution.  Richard suffered  extreme 
    emotional distress, forcing him to take a leave of absence from his job. 
    Assuming  that these two people actually exist,  one must now be careful 
    in accepting their claims (even if offered in good faith). Despite their 
    debilitating mental problems,  at least one of them was allowed to drive 
    a  car  with  UN  license plates.  Are we really to  believe  that  they 
    returned  to  active duty in a sensitive position  (presumably  carrying 
    firearms) and were given use of an official car? 
     
    Who  was  the doctor who took the X-rays?  We are only  told  that  this 
    person  is  closely  connected with Linda.  Why isn't  a  formal  report 
    available? Given the alarming nature of the outcome, why wasn't there an 
    immediate  examination?   Linda said that the doctor was "nervous"   and 
    didn't   want  to talk about the X- ray. It is not clear whether Hopkins 
    has ever met this alleged doctor. Instead, Hopkins showed the X-ray to a 
    friend of his.  Some have speculated that Linda may have simply put some 
    small object  in her nose and had a friendly X-ray technician assist. We 
    have seen no evidence to exclude this possibility. 
     
    Linda claims that she was kidnapped twice,  nearly drowned,  and further 
    harassed.   Yet she refuses to contact the police,  even after  Hopkins' 
    urging.   During the February 1,  1992  meeting with Stefula and Butler, 
    Linda  asked  if she had legal grounds to "shoot"  Dan if  he  attempted 
    another  abduction  of  her by force.  Stefula advised  against  it  and 
    recommended  that  she go to the police and make an official  complaint. 
    She declined. 
    
    If she was afraid, why didn't her husband contact authorities?  The most 
    plausible  reason  is that if a report was filed,  and her story  proved 
    false,   she  could be subject to criminal charges. Linda's failure here 
    raises enormous questions of credibility. 
     
     
    OUR INVESTIGATION 
     
    Despite the numerous problems outlined above,  we believed it worthwhile 
    to  gain additional information because so many people had contacted  us 
    with  questions.  On September 19,  1992,  Stefula,  Butler,  and Hansen 
    traveled  to  New  York City in order to visit the site of  the  alleged 
    abduction. We found that Linda's apartment complex has a large courtyard 
    with   guard   house  manned 24 hours a day. We talked with the security 
    guard and  his  supervisor  and asked if they had ever heard about a UFO 
    encounter near the complex.  They reported hearing nothing about one. We 
    also asked if the police routinely enter the complex and undertake door-
    to-door canvassing in  order to find witnesses to crimes. They said that 
    this was a very rare practice. 
    
    We  obtained  the  name and phone number of the  apartment  manager  and 
    called him a few days later.  He reported knowing nothing about the  UFO 
    sighting,   nor  had  he  heard  anything  about  it  from  any  of  the 
    approximately 1600 residents in the complex. 
     
    We  also  visited  the site under the FDR drive where  Richard  and  Dan 
    purportedly  parked  their car.  This was in a direct line of sight  and 
    nearly across the street from the loading dock of the New York Post.  We 
    spoke with an employee of the Post, who told us that the dock was in use 
    through most of the night. A few days later, we called the New York Post 
    and   spoke   to the person who was the loading dock manager in 1989. He 
    told us  that the dock is in use until 5:00 a.m. and that there are many 
    trucks that  come  and go frequently during the early morning hours. The 
    manager knew  nothing of the UFO which supposedly appeared only a couple 
    blocks away. 
     
    Also in September,  a colleague of ours contacted the Downtown Heliport, 
    on Pier Six on the East River of Manhattan. That is the only heliport on 
    the  east side of Manhattan between Linda's apartment and the lower  tip 
    of  the  island.  Our colleague was informed that the  normal  hours  of 
    operation  of the heliport are from 7:00  a.m to 7:00  p.m.  The  Senior 
    Airport   Operations   Agent researched the records and found that there 
    were no  helicopter  movements on November 30, 1989 before normal hours. 
    Our  colleague  was   also   told  that about six months previously, the 
    heliport authorities  had  been  approached by a man in his fifties with 
    white hair who had  made  a similar inquiry.  That man had asked about a 
    UFO that had crashed into the East River. 
     
     
    The Meeting of October 3 
     
    On  October  3,  1992,  we met with Hopkins and his  colleagues  at  his 
    residence  in Manhattan.  Among those in attendance were  David  Jacobs, 
    Walter  H.  Andrus,  and Jerome Clark.  During our meeting a  number  of 
    questions     were raised, and some of Hopkins' answers revealed a great 
    deal  about  his  investigations  as well as the  attitudes  of  Jacobs, 
    Andrus, and Clark. Linda's statements also told us much. 
     
    We  inquired  if Hopkins had asked the guards of the  apartment  complex 
    whether  they  had seen the UFO.  He indicated that he had not done  so. 
    This   is  quite surprising, considering that the UFO was so bright that 
    the  woman  on the bridge had to shield her eyes from it even though she 
    was  more  than  a quarter mile distant.  One would  have  thought  that 
    Hopkins    would    have    made inquiries of the guards considering the 
    spectacular nature of the event. 
     
    We  noted that Linda had claimed that police canvassing of her apartment 
    complex was a common occurrence. We asked Hopkins if he had attempted to 
    verify this with the guards or the building manager.  He indicated  that 
    he did not feel it necessary. Although this is a minor point,  it is one 
    of the few directly checkable statements made by Linda,  but Hopkins did 
    not attempt to confirm it. 
     
    We  asked  about the weather on the night of the abduction.   Amazingly, 
    Hopkins  told  us that he didn't know the weather  conditions  for  that 
    period. This was perhaps one of the most revealing moments, and it gives 
    great  insight  into Hopkins'  capabilities as an investigator.  If  the 
    weather had been foggy,  rainy,  or snowing,  the visibility could  have 
    been  greatly  hampered,  and the reliability of the  testimony  of  the 
    witnesses  would   need to be evaluated accordingly. Even the very first 
    form  in  the  MUFON Field Investigator's Manual requests information on 
    weather   conditions   (Fowler, 1983, p. 30). We ourselves did check the 
    weather and knew  the conditions did not impede visibility. But the fact 
    that Hopkins  apparently had not bothered to obtain even this most basic 
    investigatory  information  was illuminating.  He claims  to  have  much 
    supporting  evidence  that  he  has  not revealed to outsiders; however, 
    because  of   Hopkins'    demonstrated   failure  to check even the most 
    rudimentary facts,  we place  absolutely  no credence in his undisclosed 
    "evidence." 
     
    During the discussions, Hopkins' partisans made allusions to other world 
    figures involved in this event, though they did not give names. Hopkins' 
    supporters,   who  had been given information denied to us,   seemed  to 
    believe  that there was a large motorcade that carried Perez de  Cuellar 
    and   these other dignitaries in the early morning hours of November 30, 
    1989.  At the meeting, we presented an outside expert consultant who for 
    many years had served in dignitary protective services. He described the 
    extensive  preplanning  required  for moving officials and  the  massive 
    coordination  during the movements.  Many people and networks  would  be 
    alerted if  there were any problems at all (such as a car stalling, or a 
    delay  in passing checkpoints). His detailed presentation seemed to take 
    Hopkins  aback.  The consultant listed several specialized terms used by 
    the dignitary protective services and suggested that Hopkins ask Richard 
    and  Dan  the  meaning  of those terms as a test of their knowledge, and 
    thus  credibility.   As  far  as  we know, Hopkins has failed to contact 
    Richard and Dan about that matter. 
     
    During  the  beginning part of the October 3 meeting,   Linda's  husband 
    answered  a  few questions (in a very quiet voice).  He seemed  to  have 
    difficulty  with  some of them,  and Linda spoke up  to  "correct"   his 
    memory.   He   left  the meeting very early, even though Linda was under 
    considerable stress,  and despite the fact that she was overheard asking 
    him to stay by her side. His leaving raised many questions in our minds. 
     
    Linda  also  responded to questions during the meeting.   Early  in  the 
    discussion,  Hansen asked Linda's husband whether he was born and raised 
    in the U.S.  He replied that he had come to this country when he was 17. 
    Linda  promptly  interjected  that she knew why Hansen  had  asked  that 
    question.   During  a  prior telephone conversation  between  Linda  and 
    Hansen,   Linda had asserted that her husband was born and raised in New 
    York.     She   acknowledged that she had previously deliberately misled 
    Hansen. 
     
    Later  in  the  meeting the question arose about a  financial  agreement 
    between  Linda and Hopkins.  Stefula noted that Linda had told him  that 
    she   and Hopkins had an agreement to split profits from a book. Hopkins 
    denied that there was any such arrangement,  and Linda then claimed that 
    she had deliberately planted disinformation. 
     
    During  the  meeting,  reports were heard from two psychologists.   They 
    concluded  that Linda's intelligence was in the "average"   range.   One 
    suggested  that Linda would need the mind of a Bobby Fischer to plan and 
    execute  any  hoax  that could explain this case and that  she  was  not 
    capable  of orchestrating such a massive,  complex operation.   Although 
    these were supposedly professional opinions, we were not given the names 
    of these psychologists. 
     
    Ms.   Penelope  Franklin  also attended the meeting.   She  is  a  close 
    colleague of Hopkins and the editor of IF--The Bulletin of the Intruders 
    Foundation.   Hopkins  had previously informed us in  writing  that  Ms. 
    Franklin was a coinvestigator on the Napolitano case.  In a conversation 
    during  a  break  in the meeting, Franklin asserted to Hansen that Linda 
    was    absolutely     justified in lying about the case. This remarkable 
    statement  was   also   witnessed  by Vincent Creevy, who happened to be 
    standing between Franklin and Hansen. 
     
    Franklin's statement raises very troubling questions,  especially  given 
    her  prominence  within Hopkins'  circle of colleagues.   Her  statement 
    appears to violate all norms of scientific integrity. We can only wonder 
    whether  Linda has been counseled to lie by Hopkins or  his  colleagues. 
    Have  other abductees been given similar advice?  What kind of a  social 
    and ethical environment are Hopkins and Franklin creating for abductees? 
    We  also  cannot help but wonder whether Hopkins and Franklin believe it 
    appropriate       for themselves to lie about the case. They owe the UFO 
    research  community  an explanation for Franklin's statement. If such is 
    not forthcoming, we simply cannot accept them as credible investigators. 
     
     
    HOPKINS' REACTION TO OUR INVESTIGATION 
     
    In concluding his Mufon UFO Journal paper, Hopkins wrote: "if rumors are 
    true and there are officially sanctioned intelligence agents within  the 
    various UFO investigative networks,  these people will also be mobilized 
    to subvert the case from the inside, even before its full dimensions are 
    made known to the public at large"  (Hopkins,  1992c,  p.  16).  Hopkins 
    apparently  takes  this idea quite seriously.  After he learned  of  our 
    investigation,  he warned Butler that he suspected Butler and Stefula of 
    being      government agents and that he planned to inform others of his 
    suspicions. A few weeks after our October 3 meeting, he told people that 
    he suspected Hansen of being a CIA agent. This was not an offhand remark 
    made to  a  friend in an informal setting; rather this was asserted to a 
    woman  whom  he  did  not know and who had happened to attend one of his 
    lectures (member of  MUFON in New Jersey who feared future repercussions 
    if her name was mentioned, personal communication, November 7, 1992). 
     
     
    A POSSIBLE LITERARY BASIS FOR ELEMENTS OF THE STORY 
     
    This case is quite exotic,  even for a UFO abduction.  Government agents 
    are  involved,   the UN Secretary General is a key witness,   Linda  was 
    kidnapped in the interests of national security,  concerns are expressed 
    about  world peace, the CIA is attempting to discredit the case, and the 
    ETs    helped   end the Cold War. The story is truly marvellous, and one 
    might wonder about its origin. We wish to draw the readers' attention to 
    the  science  fiction novel, Nighteyes, by Garfield Reeves-Stevens. This 
    work   was    first   published in April 1989, a few months before Linda 
    claimed to have been abducted from her apartment. 
     
    The experiences reported by Linda seem to be a composite of those of two 
    characters  in Nighteyes:  Sarah and Wendy.  The parallels are striking; 
    some  are  listed  in  Table 1.  We have not  bothered  to  include  the 
    similarities commonly reported in abduction experiences (e.g., implants, 
    bodily  examinations,  probes,  etc.).  The parallels  are  sufficiently 
    numerous  to lead us to suspect that the novel served as the  basis  for 
    Linda's story. We want to emphasize that the parallels are with discrete 
    elements of the case and not with the story line itself.

    THE REACTION OF THE UFOLOGY'S LEADERSHIP 
     
     
    One  of  the  most curious features of our investigation  has  been  the 
    reaction of several prominent leaders in ufology.  Indeed,  in the  long 
    run,     this   may turn out to be the most important part of the entire 
    affair. 
     
    After  the  MUFON symposium in July,  Stefula had several  conversations 
    with  Walter Andrus,  International Director of MUFON.  Andrus told  him 
    that  MUFON had no interest in publishing any material critical of  this 
    case   even   though they had published an article describing it as "The 
    Abduction Case of the Century." This is a most surprising statement from 
    a  leader of an organization which purports to be  scientific.   Andrus' 
    statements should raise questions about the legitimacy of MUFON's claims 
    to use objective, scientific methods. 
     
    On  September 14,  1992,  Hopkins faxed Butler a letter saying that as a 
    long-standing member of MUFON, he was issuing an "order" (his word).  He 
    "ordered" Stefula and Butler to stop their investigation of the case. We 
    found  this very curious,  and we wondered how Hopkins,  as a member  of 
    MUFON,  could believe that it was in his power to issue such an "order." 
    His  letter seemed to reflect the mindset of a leader of a  cult  rather 
    than that of an investigator searching for the truth. 
     
    For the meeting on October 3 in New York City, Hopkins flew in his close 
    friend  Jerome Clark from Minnesota.  Under the sway of Hopkins,   Clark 
    strenuously  urged that outsiders cease investigations,  thus  seemingly 
    trying to reinforce Hopkins'  earlier "order" (despite the fact that the 
    case already had been reported in the Wall Street Journal,  Omni,  Paris 
    Match  and  the television show Inside Edition).  Clark  (1992a)   later 
    committed      his position to writing, saying that this case may indeed 
    involve a world political figure and have international consequences. 
     
    Andrus  and Clark are arguably the two most influential figures in  U.S. 
    ufology.   Andrus  is International Director of the Mutual  UFO  Network 
    (MUFON),  and he organizes the largest annual conference on UFOs in  the 
    country  and regularly writes for MUFON's monthly magazine.  Clark is  a 
    columnist for Fate magazine, editor of International UFO Reporter, vice-
    president  of the J.  Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies,  and author of 
    books and even an encyclopedia on UFOs. Because of their eminence, their 
    statements should be of special concern to the UFO research community. 
     
    At  the  meeting on October 3,  the kidnapping and attempted  murder  of 
    Linda  were  discussed.  We informed Hopkins and the other  participants 
    that  we  were  prepared  to  make  a  formal  request  for  a   federal 
    investigation  of  the  government agents responsible  for  the  alleged 
    felonies. Hopkins,  Andrus, and Clark appeared to literally panic at the 
    suggestion.   They   vigorously argued against making such a request. We 
    could only  conclude  that they wanted to suppress evidence of attempted 
    murder. We wondered why. 
     
    This situation seemed so outrageous that a few days later Hansen  called 
    Andrus, Clark, John Mack, and David Jacobs and asked them if they really 
    believed  Linda's story about the kidnappings and attempted murder.  All 
    of these individuals said that they accepted her account. We were forced 
    to seriously consider their opinions because they had been given  secret 
    information  not  revealed to us.  During the  telephone  conversations, 
    Andrus  and Clark again strongly objected to requesting an investigation 
    by law enforcement authorities. 
    
     
    A PSYCHO-SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE 
     
    The  Napolitano case brings into stark relief symptoms of deep  problems 
    within  ufology:  major figures in the UFO community aggressively sought 
    to suppress evidence of a purported attempted murder;  Hopkins failed to 
    obtain  and verify even the most basic investigatory  information;   his 
    coinvestigator,  Penelope Franklin,  approved of lying by the  principal 
    witness;  and leaders in the field have willingly accepted and  promoted 
    the  case  despite its exotic features and lack of supporting  evidence. 
    This  state  of affairs raises perplexing questions and cries out for  a 
    plausible explanation. The thinking and motivations of ufology's leaders 
    deserve at least as much attention as the abduction claims themselves. 
     
    Did these leaders really believe,  as they said,  that they accepted the 
    report  of  attempted murder?  If so,  they seem not to  have  acted  as 
    responsible  citizens.  However,  these people do not appear to us to be 
    delusional,  in any usual sense of that word. They are highly functional 
    members of society. They also do not appear to be perpetrators of a hoax 
    or even "yellow journalists"  with a "wink-wink,  nudge-nudge"  attitude 
    who knowingly want to capitalize on it for their own temporary glory  or 
    financial gain. 
     
    We  believe that other motivating factors and concepts provide a  better 
    explanation  and  framework  for understanding these  seemingly  bizarre 
    actions.   We would suggest that perhaps,  at some semiconscious  level, 
    these  individuals do not really believe their UFO investigations to  be 
    fully  engaged  with  the  "real world."  Rather,   their  behavior  and 
    statements  seem  more  consistent  with  something  like  fantasy  role 
    playing, perhaps akin to the game Dungeons and Dragons (D & D). 
     
    Both ufology and D & D allow direct, immediate involvement with powerful 
    "other-world"  beings and mythological motifs.  Both endeavors have been 
    known to overtake (possess?)  the participants, though only occasionally 
    to  their  detriment.  Most "players"  are able to  successfully  detach 
    themselves  from  involvement,   but occasionally  the  "game"   becomes 
    obsessive and interferes with "real-world" pursuits. This "role playing" 
    taps          archetypal images that hold great psychological power. The 
    archetypes   can   become immensely attractive, even addictive, to those 
    playing  the  game.  The notions and images  of  powerful  "other-world" 
    figures are  part  of the human condition. Accounts of them are found in 
    all   cultures   throughout   history, this being one of the traditional 
    domains of religion.   Even atheists and those who deny the existence of 
    such beings must still grapple with the ideas on some level, though this 
    might not be consciously recognized by an individual. 
     
    In the Napolitano case,  the "other-world"  figures include not only the 
    ET  aliens,   but also the pantheon of agents of an  unreachable,   evil 
    government conspiracy determined to prevent humankind's knowledge of the 
    ETs.   Intermediaries  between flesh and blood humans and  the  powerful 
    masters  of  the mystical higher orders are ubiquitous in the  realm  of 
    religion. 
    
    Angels and devils serve the centers of ultimate good and evil.  So  here 
    we     see     the largely invisible minions "Dan" and "Richard" and the 
    mysterious    witness     on the bridge furthering the cause of "Truth." 
    Likewise,   Hopkins  discerns the skeptical investigators as agents of a 
    secular satan. 
     
    Thus the interactions of Hopkins, et al., with these players are seen to 
    conform to the rules that historically control the interactions  between 
    humans  and  gods.   Humans question and provoke the gods  only  at  the 
    greatest  peril.   The  proper  approach is  to  appease,   mollify  and 
    supplicate  these "entities." It should be no surprise that the simplest 
    reality   tests    of   the Napolitano story were not made in this case. 
    Hopkins'  failure  to  check the weather conditions during the abduction 
    actually makes sense  in  the context of this cult-like thought process. 
    Just  as  lice   were  called  "pearls  of heaven" by medieval religious 
    devotees,   the  physical  event-reality  issues  in the Linda story are 
    transmuted by her supporters. 
     
    The  roles  of  high  priest  and acolytes are  only  too  obvious  when 
    examaning  the  behaviors of personages Hopkins,  Clark,   Jacobs,   and 
    Andrus. These aging white males patronizingly refer to Linda's "average" 
    intellect,     perhaps    to reassure themselves that they are indeed in 
    control.  Yet  the  high  priestess has, in effect, achieved the godhead 
    (metaphorically speaking, of course). 
     
    There are some differences between D & D and ufological pursuits.  D & D 
    has more restrictive and structured rules. The boundaries of appropriate 
    behavior  are  rather clearly defined.  Ufology is more  "unstructured," 
    there  are  fewer "rules"  about what is and is not possible,   and  the 
    powers of the "other- world" figures are almost unbounded. This relative 
    lack of structure makes the UFO game somewhat more "dangerous." In order 
    to grapple with the phenomena,  the paradigms adopted by many ufologists 
    have "concretized" (i.e., structured) the beings as ET humanoids. 
     
    In fantasy role playing, the rules are not questioned; they are accepted 
    by the players at the beginning.  Similarly in the Linda case, the basic 
    evidence is not to be questioned.  Andrus,  Clark,  and Hopkins have all 
    urged that outsiders cease investigation (despite the massive  publicity 
    given to the case). Such challenging of "rules"  leads to disruptions of 
    the "game," and the dungeon masters need to keep order. 
     
    Direct interfacing of the "fantasy role"  with the "real-world"   (i.e., 
    direct  allegations  of attempted murder,  verification  of  details  of 
    testimony), usually does not cause problems,  except when the players do 
    not act in accordance with consequential "real-world" concerns. Hopkins, 
    Andrus,   Clark,   Mack,  and Jacobs seem to have accepted a  system  of 
    beliefs  and  assumptions  that have led to a collision with  the  "real 
    world."  They  have been unable to rationally defend their behavior, and 
    Jerome  Clark's  (1992a) "Torquemada" article is perhaps the single best 
    example  of   that.    In  fact, his emotional attack labeling Hansen as 
    "Torquemada"   (director  of  the Spanish Inquisition)   ressurects  and 
    reinforces  religious  themes,   and  it perhaps betrays his unconscious 
    feelings of religious persecution. 
     
    The  above discussion derives from a psycho-social perspective,  and  we 
    would  like  to encourage U.S.  researchers to become more familiar  the 
    ideas  generated  from that approach.  We admit that  the  psycho-social 
    theorists   have  failed  to  address  many  aspects  of  the  abduction 
    experience      generally. Exclusive use of that perspective can lead to 
    positing  simplistic  and scientifically sterile explanations.   On  the 
    other hand, those that shun the psycho-social perspective typically fail 
    to  recognize   the   explanatory  power it possesses and its ability to 
    illuminate risks  faced by investigators. Those wanting more information 
    about the psycho-social perspective may wish to read the book Angels and 
    Aliens by Keith Thompson (1991) and the British magazine Magonia; almost 
    without saying, the works of John Keel are also recommended. 
     
    We  are not denigrating ufology by such comparisons as those made above, 
    nor are we attacking the existence of "other-world" entities. Regardless 
    whether entities or ET aliens exist,  the comparisons are useful and the 
    consequences  and insights are applicable.  Such a comparative  analysis 
    should  not  be limited to only D & D players and  ufologists;   similar 
    comparisons  could  be made for virtually everyone in the "real  world." 
    They can help serve as warnings about becoming too complacent  regarding 
    beliefs in our own "rationality." 
     
     
    DISCUSSION 
     
    The Napolitano case appears beset by an overwhelming number of problems. 
    It was with some misgivings that we first embarked on this investigation 
    because  we did not wish to see UFO abduction research discredited.   In 
    fact,  one of us, Butler, has had abduction experiences himself.  It was 
    our  judgement  that  if  we  did not  raise  these  issues  for  public 
    discussion,  there was a much greater risk for the field.  The case  was 
    garnering    considerable attention, and if it became widely regarded as 
    evidential,   it  would reflect very badly on the field as a whole if it 
    was eventually shown to be false. 
     
    We  were quite unprepared for the reaction to our work from  leaders  of 
    the field. Walter Andrus and Jerome Clark aggressively tried to dissuade 
    us  from continuing our investigation,  and so far they have  failed  to 
    publish  any  material critical of the case.  We were unaware that  such 
    belligerently  antiscientific attitudes were so prevalent at the highest 
    levels   of   ufology. When these same individuals attempted to suppress 
    evidence of an alleged attempted murder, we concluded that their beliefs 
    and actions were incompatible with "real world"  events. However,  we do 
    not   consider   the label "deluded" appropriate here, and we remind the 
    reader  that  these  individuals are backed by people  such  as  Harvard 
    psychiatrist John  Mack and David Jacobs, professor of history at Temple 
    University. 
     
    Despite our disappointment, we strongly support scientific research into 
    the abduction phenomena and would like to call attention to high quality 
    studies in the field (e.g., Ring & Rosing, 1990; Rodeghier, Goodpaster & 
    Blatterbauer, 1992).  We also believe that the core abduction experience 
    has  not been adequately explained within normal scientific  frameworks. 
    We commend the work of Hufford (1982) in exploring similar issues. 
     
    The  present  case has significant implications for assessing  the  true 
    nature of the abduction phenomena. The idea that actual extraterrestrial 
    physical creatures are abducting people has been vigorously promoted  in 
    the  scientific literature and in the media.  Jacobs has  promoted  that 
    view in the New York Times (Hinds,  1992)  as well as in the Journal  of 
    UFO  Studies (Jacobs, 1992). He suggests that the ET aliens are visiting 
    earth   in   order to obtain human sperm and eggs. In his JUFOS article, 
    Jacobs     was    bitterly critical of Ring and Rosing, saying that they 
    ignored "cases of witnesses seeing others being abducted while not being 
    abducted themselves"   (p.  162). Surprizingly, Jacobs gave no citations 
    for any of these cases. Hansen wrote to Jacobs requesting such citations 
    but received  no  reply.   Jacobs'  article was lavish in its praise for 
    Hopkins'  work,  and  we  suspect that Jacobs had in mind the Napolitano 
    case when he wrote his article.  We would like to remind the reader that 
    it was  Hopkins  (1992a)   who  wrote:   "The importance of this case is 
    virtually immeasurable,  as  it  powerfully  supports both the objective 
    reality  of  UFO  abductions and the accuracy of  regressive  hypnosis." 
    Because  the  argument  for the "objective reality  of  UFO  abductions" 
    relies heavily on  Hopkins'  work,  our findings call into question this 
    entire theoretical perspective. 
     
    In our judgment,  conscious hoaxes are rare in the abduction field.  The 
    vast  majority  of those claiming to be abducted have had some  kind  of 
    intense personal experience, whatever the ultimate cause.  Nevertheless, 
    the  problems of fraud and hoaxing have long been a problem in  ufology, 
    especially   for  cases  with  high  visibility.   This  will  continue. 
    Researchers  must become more open minded to the potential for  hoaxing, 
    yet  not  be  blinded  to the genuine phenomena.  This  is  a  difficult 
    balance. 
     
    Some have questioned possible motives in this case;  it is impossible to 
    obtain certain knowledge here.  Perhaps Linda really had some kind of an 
    abduction experience (Butler believes this is likely to be the case). As 
    she  became  acquainted with Hopkins and other abductees,  she may  have 
    wanted  to  vindicate  them--to save them from  ridicule  and  derision. 
    Perhaps money was the only motivation.  Possibly there was a combination 
    of     factors.       It does appear that if this was a hoax, it was not 
    perpetrated by a lone individual.  Collaborators would include the woman 
    on the bridge,  an X-ray operator, and a man (or men) preparing the tape 
    recordings.     However,     we want to emphasize that we have no direct 
    evidence to implicate Hopkins in attempted deception. 
     
    Cynics  might  criticize  Hopkins  saying that he  ignored  the  obvious 
    problems because he was motivated by money that might accrue from  books 
    and    movie rights. While this might possibly be an unconscious factor, 
    critics  rarely  acknowledge that Hopkins does not charge abductees  for 
    his     services     (unlike some "professionals"). Hopkins has spent an 
    enormous amount of  his  own time and money investigating the phenomena. 
    Furthermore, he does not have an academic position subsidized by the tax 
    payers.  One should not begrudge him the profits from his books. Hopkins 
    has been  involved  in  considerable controversy, and some have disputed 
    his methods.   Nevertheless,   he  has  done much to bring the abduction 
    problem to the attention  of scientists and the mental health community, 
    and his  efforts  have  made  it  much  more  acceptable to discuss such 
    strange  encounters.   Abduction  experiences are  often  emotional  and 
    traumatic,   and  the abductees need considerable support.  Hopkins  has 
    attempted to provide much needed aid. 
     
    The  outside  critic  who is not directly involved  in  such  activities 
    almost never recognizes how difficult it is to serve as both a therapist 
    and  as a scientist.  Those persons trying to help abductees emotionally 
    need   to provide warmth, acceptance, and trust. The scientist, however, 
    needs to be critically open minded and somewhat detached and analytical. 
    The two functions are not altogether compatible. We cannot realistically 
    expect one individual to be 100% effective in both roles.  By the nature 
    of  the  endeavor,   those trying to be helpful  can  be  vulnerable  to 
    deception. 
     
     
    APPENDIX 
     
    A Note on the Hansen-Clark Communications 
     
    One of the more entertaining aspects of this case has been the resulting 
    missives by Hansen (1992a,  1992b) and Clark (1992a,  1992b)  which have 
    been  widely  circulated and posted on electronic bulletin  boards.   We 
    encourage those interested to obtain copies. 
     
    Clark's (1992b)  most recent piece deserves comment. He now says that he 
    now  does not accept Linda's claims about the kidnapping  and  attempted 
    murder by government agents.  However,  in a telephone conversation with 
    him   on  October 6, 1992, he told Hansen that he accepted those claims. 
    Hansen    did     not tape-record the conversation, but he is willing to 
    provide   a    sworn   statement to that effect. Hansen also talked with 
    Marcello  Truzzi  who   had  spoken  to Clark near the same time. Truzzi 
    understood that Clark  believed that Linda was sincere in her claims and 
    was telling the truth to the best of her ability. 
     
    The salient points are summarized as follows: 
     
    1. At  the  1992  MUFON symposium,  Linda Napolitano spoke in  front  of 
       hundreds  of people and claimed that she was kidnapped by  government 
       agents. 
     
    2. Clark  told  both Hansen and Truzzi that he  accepted  Linda's  story 
       (i.e., that she was telling the truth to the best of her ability). 
     
    3. Hopkins  claims to have much evidence that could be used to  identify 
       the culprits. 
     
    4. Hopkins flew Clark to New York, whereupon Clark aggressively injected 
       himself  into  matters and vigorously opposed continuing  an  outside 
       investigation  and reporting the alleged felonies to law  enforcement 
       authorities. He defended this position, in writing, saying:  "if this 
       story  is  true,   it  is  not just a UFO  case  but  a  `politically 
       sensitive' event because it supposedly involves a political figure of 
       international  stature...banging  on the wrong doors could alert  the 
       relevant  agency that two of its agents were leaking a huge  secret." 
       (Clark, 1992a, p. 1). 
     
    We  will  let the readers decide whether Clark's  initial  position  was 
    compatible with "real-world" considerations. 
     
    We are gratified that Clark has taken the time to comment, at length, on 
    these  issues,  and in a style so typical of his level of  dispassionate 
    commentary.   We  caution  readers that Clark perhaps may  be  currently 
    acutely embarrassed by his statement quoted in point 4 and may feel  the 
    need to obscure this central issue. Nevertheless, we are pleased that he 
    now seems to have made a cathartic conversion.
