                              THE ENTITIES
        Initial Findings of the Abduction Transcription Project

                  A MUFON Special Report by Dan Wright

        In the Spring of 1992, MUFON launched an ambitious project to
compile transcripts of audiotaped hypnosis sessions and conscious-recall
interviews with claimed abduction experiencers (hereinafter the
"subjects").

        A year later, the Fund for UFO Research joined the effort. By
agreeing to divide the costs with MUFON for a sophisticated computer
system, FUFOR underscored the need for comparative analysis of all
reported factors in the verbatim transcripts.

        With an ever growing number of cases on record and a powerful
computer now in place to conduct multi-factor analyses, future updates
will begin to address the question "Who does what?" This initial report
is limited in scope, presenting data for each descriptive element
without factoring by entity type or other variable.

        The findings are based on 317 transcripts derived from thirteen
abduction researchers.(1)  Most of the subjects were hypnotized and/or
interviewed on multiple (or even numerous) occasions. Consequently, the
317 documents, each from a single session, comprise 95 separate cases:
27 males, 58 females, and 1O cases with both male and female subjects.
It is not the author's intent to imply statistical significance for any
of the results that follow.

PREFACE

        Abduction cases involve widely varying descriptions of entities,
surroundings, medical and other procedures, communications with the
beings, and post-event effects. However, similarities among many
accounts are striking.

        This, the first of two parts, addresses typical abduction sites;
precognition of an episode and familiarity with a being; vehicle types;
how subjects are transported and the resulting effects; features of the
examining room; odors detected; recognition of other abductees and the
appearance of the entities, including their garments and locomotion.

        In this report, a "case" includes all abduction-related events
in a subject's life. Families or roommates ar also considered a single
case except wherein an individual had separate CE-4 episodes apart from
the shared living arrangement. The data below frequently express the
number of "subjects" to which an abduction factor applies. In such
tallies, every subject represents a discreet case.

        For some factors, the total of all input exceeds 100% of the
cases reported, since many individual subjects have encountered more
than one type of entity or circumstance. The terms "entity," "being" and
"alien" are used interchangeably, as are "vehicle," "ship" and "craft."

ABDUCTION SITE

        In a great majority of the 95 cases, the subjects indicated that
their own residence (generally the bedroom) was the abduction point.
However, 15 subjects have also (or instead) reported some other
location. Ten of those were taken from their automobiles and six from a
cabin or campsite.

UNSEEN PRESENCE

        Whether purposeful or inadvertent, over a fourth (28%) of the
subjects in the study have sensed an alien presence other than visually.
This often occurred in the hours, minutes or seconds before visual
confirmation. In other cases, an unseen presence was felt in the midst
of a cluster of episodes but with no known CE-4 on that night.

        The recognition was sometimes obvious -- an electrical tingling,
a buzzing or beeping in the person's mind, rappings and other
"poltergeist" activity. In a few cases, the subject "just knew" that the
intruders were present.

FAMILIARITY

        From prior events, presumably, many subjects recognized their
abductors -- or one in particular -- a factor which David Jacobs has
called the "familiar being."(2)

        While common, the initial results of this study suggest it is
far from a universal aspect. In the 95 cases thus far recorded, the
subject told of recognizing one or more entities in 34.

        Relatedly, ten subjects telepathically heard their own names
spoken by a being. In 18 other cases, the entity told the subject (s)he
was "chosen " "special" or "protected"' in some unspecified manner.

        Taken together, these three factors (familiar beings, hearing
one's name, and selection or protection) account for 44 cases.

VEHICLE SIGHTED

        A telling point concerning the study findings to date: Only a
small majority (55%) of the subjects had _ever_ sighted an anomalous
object (i.e., excluding simple nocturnal lights) -- whether during an
abduction scenario or any other time.

        Table 1 shows the basic vehicle shapes reported among the 31
cases in which an object of any _specific_ shape was discerned.

SUBJECT TRANSIT

        No doubt surprising to some readers, a clear majority of the
study's subjects had no recollection of ever going to or returning from
a ship. This poses obvious questions for ensuing research.

        Of those who did recall the transit, four mentioned a small,
peculiar capsule in which they were placed. Levitation, though, was by
far the more frequent mode, cited in 33 cases.

        In 17 cases, usually beginning outdoors, the subject was raised
bodily into the air by a beam of light. In 20 cases, the person was
lifted out of bed and through a closed window (or screen), door, wall or
ceiling -- generally without sensing a surrounding light.

DIZZINESS/NAUSEA

        Twenty subjects reported feeling either dizzy or nauseous at
some point in an episode. This was most often associated with transit
via levitation.

EXAMINING ROOM

        Very often, the first area viewed onboard the ship was a hallway
or tunnel. This feature, which played a part in 35 cases, was sometimes
quite lengthy and usually curved. Soon, however, most subjects entered
an examining room that was fairly stark in appearance, likened to the
office of a doctor or dentist.

        The room's shape has been described in 29 cases. In 25 of those,
it was said to be either round(ed) or domed. This, together with curving
hallways, coincides with the preponderance of discoid vehicles in the
study. Notably, nine subjects remarked on an especially large room with
either numerous examining tables or amphitheater-type seating.

        Coloration of the room was mentioned in 31 cases. White was
dominant in 18, while grey (or metallic) was the theme in eleven.
Curiously, in three a room with black walls was mentioned.

        Thirty-two subjects remarked on the relative luminosity onboard.
A very bright room was found in 25 cases, but in 13 there was a dim or
dark room. Obviously, then, a few subjects encountered both.

        Room furnishings included variations on many built-ins and items
of furniture in our daily lives. The centerpiece was nearly always a
table (or tables), specifically mentioned in 52 cases and implied in
most of the remainder. Typically it was hard, flat, rather narrow, and
supported by a single pedestal. In a few instances, the table was
raised, lowered or folded like a living-room recliner. Other furnishings
frequently seen were kitchen-type counters and/or cabinets, as well as
computer panels and screens. Table 2 details these and other items.

ODORS

        In 18 cases, the subject detected some specific aroma other than
a basically clean smell. Nothing in particular dominates the data, but a
couple bear mention. Four subjects apparently smelled the burning of
their own hair or tissue, while six remarked on a foul odor emanating
from the beings themselves.

OTHER SUBJECTS

        Abduction events are thought by many to be solitary experiences
for the human subject. Yet in 30 cases (nearly a third of the total) one
or more persons were seen in the vehicle and assumed -- from their state
of dress or demeanor -- to be fellow abductees. Usually there was no
communication whatsoever among the subjects. Ambiguous but fascinating,
a few thought they recognized a certain person from previous episodes.

ENTITY SKIN TONE & QUALITY

        "Greys" have gained status as the garden-variety alien in
abduction lore. And while 38 subjects in the study have encountered grey
(or grey-white) skinned entities, another 19 describe the abductors as
absolutely "white" (not to be confused with Caucasian). In one case, the
subject was emphatic by stating "Clorox white."

        Neither greyish nor whitish aliens dominate the study's files,
though. Dark-skinned entities were seen in 18 cases; blue or grey-blue
in eight; and green or grey-green in seven. Beings with an aura (or
"glow") obscuring the actual exterior were present in 13 cases. And five
subjects reported a "shadow-like" entity that might not even be
tangible.

    Table 3 is a breakdown of entity skin tones.

        Certain qualities associated with an entity's skin have been
reported in significant numbers. In six cases, the epidermis was said to
be "translucent" or "thin" and the underlying dermis (sometimes
described as a grey gel) thereby visible. This might account for some
confusion here and there as to whether a given entity was "white" or
"grey" toned.

        In 17 cases, the subject reported a "smooth," "plastic," "vinyl"
or "shiny" skin. This was usually attributed to the diminutive "worker
bee" types rather than to the taller one(s) in charge.

        Fifteen subjects mentioned seeing one or more entities who were
prominently wrinkled. These were sometimes referred to as "old ones" and
thought to be important figures.

        Thirteen persons mentioned that a being's touch (often as part
of examining procedures) was cool or cold thereby prompting questions of
whether such types are warm-blooded by our standards.

ENTITY HEIGHT & BUILD

        Subjects in 66 cases remarked on the relative height of their
captors. Few people are in fact good judges of same, and in many
instances the estimate was from a prone position in bed or on a table of
unknown elevation onboard.

        Nevertheless, in 57 of the 66 cases at least one entity type was
depicted as "short," typically between 3 and 4 1/2 feet. Also, in 47
cases there was mention of a "taller" entity -- either taller than
another type in the experience or of roughly adult human proportions.
And in ten cases there was a "tall one" -- at least 6 feet and more
often over 7 feet.

        Forty-four subjects remarked on the entities' stature. In 39
cases, there was a "skinny" or "frail" being. Two subjects indicated
someone of normal human build. And ten spoke of a being who was
"stocky," "muscular," "wide" or "stout".

FACIAL FEATURES

        Oversized eyes, typically almond-shaped and uniformly black,
have certainly been the norm in the literature. But that description is
not exclusive. In 11 cases within this study, a distinct pupil, iris
and/or sclera (whiteness surrounding the iris) was noticed. In three of
those, the being was said to have "cat's eyes" (i.e, vertical-slit
pupils).

        Basic eye color, among the 44 cases reporting, was described as:

         * black (or.dark) - 35
         * green - 4
         * blue - 3
         * brown - 3
         * gold  2

        As to the nose, an indistinct rise above two small nostrils was
indicated in 30 of the 33 cases reporting on same. One subject said it
was pointed. Another five thought that a particular entity type was
without a nose of any sort.

        Twenty of the 25 subjects who reported a being's mouth indicated
either a line (or "slit") with no lips or said simply that the orifice
was small. However, in three cases it was described as a "hole" (or the
letter "O"), while two subjects believed there was no mouth at all.

        There was mention of the entities' ears, or absence thereof, in
25 cases. Eighteen said there was nothing visible. Three noticed a
cavity in the side of the being's head, and six others described some
manner of ear lobe or protrusion.

ENTITY GARMENTS

        Surprisingly, in 24 cases (55 percent of the 44 reporting on the
presence of garments) the subject alluded to a "robe," "cloak" or "cape"
on at least one entity. These were nearly always worn by beings seen
only onboard a vehicle and perceived as leaders.

        Ever popular, however, has been the (loose-fitting) "jumpsuit"
or (form-fitting) "wetsuit," one or the other seen in 23 cases.

        Disconcerting by our mores, in 14 cases certain entities (always
in lesser roles) were said to be naked. This might be a misperception in
some instances, in that certain light-colored, tight-fitting suits are
apparently almost the same color as the entity's skin.

        Basic black (or dark without a color specified) was the garb
indicated in 21 cases. Conversely, 18 spoke of a white outfit. Silver
(or "shiny") was identified in six, while bluish silver (or bluish grey)
and brown were each mentioned in another four.

        Insignias and accessories were not uncommon, but neither was any
one type predominant. Nine subjects noticed some type of emblem on a
jump-suit-type garment, usually identified only by its basic shape. A
belt was seen in four cases and a sash in two. Also, two entities
displayed a metallic pin at the neck of their robes, while one was
adorned with a necklace.

ENTITY MOTION

        Certain entity types seem to always walk -- in the subject's
home, outdoors, and onboard the ship -- whereas others are seen only in
a "gliding" mode or other form of levitation. Many cases involve both
walking and levitating -- by the same or separate beings.

        In 31 cases a being walked. In 21 of those no other form of
locomotion was ever apparent, but in the other ten the same or some
other entity levitated at some point. In all, gliding or other
levitation by an entity was present in a total of 25 cases.

        Three subjects described a being's shuffling motion, not
specifying whether this was on or above the floor/ground. And two
indicated a "jerky" motion.

SUMMARY

        Any one transcript -- stemming from hypnosis or a conscious-
recall interview -- is necessarily suspect:

        - Fantasies and frauds have haunted legitimate UFO research for
        more than 40 years.

        - A majority of the cases in this study did not involve carte
        blanche subjects. That is, they had read at least one or two
        best-selling books related to abductions.

        - Some persons are more readily and deeply hypnotized than
        others, and some hypnotists might be more adept at eliciting
        factual memories than others.

        That said, and within the confines of 95 cases, the author has
been impressed by replications of certain details not previously
published or even widely discussed.  When, for example, an entity is
said to have an unpleasant odor -- described by one subject as "musty,"
by another as "like wet newspapers," and by a third as "like wet
cardboard" -- one must sit up and take notice.

        The second part of this report will center on the "leader of the
pack" as well as various types of entity communications and human-like
behaviors; restraining and altering the subject's consciousness; samples
taken from and pain felt by the subject, sexual elements; and physical
aftereffects.
