            CAN  UFO RESEARCHERS PROVE THAT ALIENS ARE TAGGING AND TRACKING 
                   HUMANS WITH TINY DEVICES IMPLANTED IN THE BODY OR BRAIN? 
                                                           by Paul McCarthy 


      One  of the most insidious forms of alien technology ever reported by 
    UFO  buffs is the implant--a BB-like object said to be inserted in  the 
    brains  or  bodies of UFO abductees.  According to some UFO  advocates, 
    E.T.'s use these tiny devices to tag and track human abductees just  as 
    earthbound wildlife specialists tag and track animals. 
    
      But  how  can anyone know whether a reputed implant is real  or  not? 
    How, some UFO investigators have begun to wonder, can they authenticate 
    an implant should a sample emerge? 
    
      One person addressing this issue is David Pritchard,  a  physicist at 
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  According to Pritchard,  no 
    matter how strange the structure or material of an alleged implant,  if 
    it is not some "out of this world" material like "heavy metals or quark 
    matter" it won't be possible to convince a lot of people. 
    
      But,   Pritchard  adds,  there are other ways to skin the  cat.   For 
    example,   researchers could peg an insert as such if it worked like  a 
    flashlight  but  was a hundred times brighter than  any  flashlight  on 
    Earth. If the implant sent complex but unrecognizable signals, he says, 
    "that would be pretty convincing as well." Finally, Pritchard believes, 
    evidence  would  mount  if investigators found the exact same  type  of 
    implant in numerous people making abduction claims. 
    
      Yet another means of studying the so-called alien implant is a  high-
    tech imaging technique called magnetic resonance imaging,  or MRI.  The 
    technique was tapped by reputed abductee Whitley Strieber,  who says he 
    remembers the insertion of needles in his head. His MRI brain scans, he 
    adds,   now  show strange white spots.  "Are the unknown objects in  my 
    brain  an  outcome of such intrusions?"  Strieber asked in  his  recent 
    book, TRANSFORMATION. Pritchard says the dots prove nothing; they could 
    be air bubbles.  But a statistical argument could be made he adds,   if 
    researchers  can  show that professed UFO abductees have  significantly 
    more dots than a random control group. 
    
      Longtime UFO skeptic Phil Klass, who doesn't believe that aliens have 
    ever come to Earth,  takes a different tack.  First, he says,  he would 
    want  to  know  "where  the implant came from,"  and  would  feel  more 
    confident  if  it  had been removed by a surgeon.  Then,   if  it  were 
    something "that could not form naturally in the body," he would want to 
    know if it could be made with terrestrial technology.  If the answer to 
    that is no, says Klass, "I think you have your proof." 
    
      Even  more skeptical is Robert Sheaffer,  author of THE UFO  VERDICT, 
    who  says the whole question of UFO abductions is dubious and that  the 
    idea of alien implants is "certainly rubbish."  According to  Sheaffer, 
    the  UFO  is  a slippery phenomenon that always manages  to  fade  away 
    before the evidence becomes too convincing,  and alien implants are  an 
    example  of this.  "Some people might be saying they were kidnapped  by 
    aliens for the money," says Sheaffer. "Others might be doing it because 
    they really believe that they were abducted.  But there is not a  shred 
    of  evidence to substantiate this claim.  Alien implants are  just  too 
    good to be true." 
    
      According  to UFO abduction expert Budd Hopkins,  author  of  MISSING 
    TIME,  and INTRUDERS, a  number of radiologists are privately doing MRI 
    scans  on people who claim they have been abducted by aliens--and  that 
    the  aliens  have inserted devices in their bodies or  brains.   But  a 
    neurosurgeon advised him that if,  as claimed, implants exist somewhere 
    above the upper nasal passages, then they are near the optic nerve.  In 
    that case, he says, "it would be very risky for a surgeon to try to get 
    one  out."   What  does  Hopkins say about  the  prospect  of  actually 
    validating these wierd alien implants?  "It'd have devastating societal 
    impact," he says, "I am not looking forward to something like this."
