      I  would estimate that %99.99  of all abductees are unawares of  what 
    has  happened  to them.  Perhaps many of them know that they  have  had 
    strange,  out of the ordinary experiences like missing time events, Out 
    of Body Experiences, "astral travel," seen ghosts, or even had deceased 
    relatives visit them at the foot of their beds,  but these  experiences 
    are chalked up to "normality"  oftentimes.  They have an available menu 
    of  culturally determined explanations of strange occurrences and  they 
    pick  and  chose among them to help explain what has happened to  them. 
    Only  a tiny fraction of abductees have systematically  explored  their 
    experiences  with  me or with Budd Hopkins and are fully aware  of  the 
    situation that they are involved in.  I have handed out a questionnaire 
    geared  toward  helping  me to gauge how many  people  might  have  had 
    abductions.  I have given it to about 900 students at Temple university 
    over  the past few years.  Right now my statistics are running at about 
    %6.5  of potential abductees and that is being very conservative.  When 
    the  pressure  gets  too great on an abductee  and  he/she  feels  that 
    whatever  has  happened to them deserves some sort of  an  explanation, 
    they  characteristically  seek  help or answers to their  questions  in 
    three main areas. The first is in the therapeutic community. They go to 
    psychologists  and  psychiatrists in search of help.  They  think  that 
    there  must be something wrong with them because they are having  crazy 
    thoughts about being on board a UFO, etc. The therapeutic community has 
    not been very much help in this area.  Usually they are given some sort 
    of  a  diagnosis  that  suggests  childhood  trauma  of  some  sort  or 
    pathology,  in the case of psychiatrists.  In fact some members of  the 
    psychiatric  and psychological communities have been damaging to  these 
    people because of incompetence or avarice.  The second area that people 
    migrate to in search of answers is evangelical or charismatic religious 
    groups  or  cults.  In religion abductees are often given  a  "demonic" 
    explanation. They are told to pray and the demons will be excised.  The 
    third  area  is New Age groups.  Here they encounter  channelers,   and 
    believers in benevolent space brothers, and higher cosmic consciousness 
    and higher vibrational patterns, and universal love, and so forth. Many 
    of  the abductees find solace and answers in any of these  areas.   For 
    many others,  however, these areas do no provide satisfaction that they 
    have  finally come to the end of their quest.  When they come to either 
    Budd  or  me,   however,  and they finally uncover in more  or  less  a 
    systematic way what has happened to them,  the quest is over.  They  do 
    not  go from us to another area still searching for answers.  Now  they 
    know and they may be frightened and freaked, but at least they have the 
    ability  to  gain some sort of intellectual and emotional control  over 
    their lives--often for the first time. 
     
      This  is  not a complete answer,  and there are many other ways  that 
    abductees suspect that something has happened to them, for instance,  a 
    "triggering"  mechanism often works when they see a picture of an alien 
    on a book jacket, or read something, or hear something. A bell goes off 
    in peoples'  minds that suddenly alerts them to the fact that something 
    might  have happened to them.  On of the most important things to  say, 
    however,  is that it is unethical and downright dangerous for anyone to 
    suggest that another might have been the victim of abductions. I  allow 
    people to come to me in anyway that they can. Even when they come to me 
    I  issue strong warnings to them about the consequences of opening  the 
    Pandora's box of memory collection.  I  send them a pamphlet that  Budd 
    and I put together about the downside of memory collection. When I talk 
    to them again I again warn them.  If they still want to go ahead,  then 
    and  only then do I attempt regressive hypnosis.  This is not something 
    to  do  on a lark.  The content of abductions can be fairly strong  and 
    without  proper guidance and experience the possibility of harm to  the 
    abductee is great. 
     
      The population of abductees that I have investigated is small. I have 
    worked with 49  individuals as of June, 1990. However, the way in which 
    I do abduction research is different than most investigators. I  try to 
    spend  as  much time as possible with each  abductee  researching,   on 
    separate occasions,  as many abduction events as possible for each one. 
    We have found that all abductions begin in childhood and then  continue 
    throughout one's life (with certain exceptions).  I  have discovered no 
    adult-onset  abductions  unless  they are what I  call  "opportunistic" 
    abductions--the  person  is in close proximity to an  abductee  and  is 
    therefore sometimes taken.  Opportunistic abductions are uncommon. Thus 
    I have actually researched about 265 separate abduction events.  People 
    have had as many as twenty-six sessions with me and as few as one.  The 
    average  length  of my sessions is about five hours--from  the  time  a 
    person walks in to the time he/she leaves.  During the session I try to 
    bring  out as much information as possible on a  chronological  basis--
    what  happens to the abductee from the time he realizes that  something 
    is first happening to him,  say in his bedroom, until the event is over 
    and he is returned.  Actual hypnosis time varies from one hour to three 
    hours. 
     
      Generally  speaking,   we  do not know why  a  particular  person  is 
    abducted.  There appears to be no overt similarities,  either mental or 
    physical  between abductees.  This appears to be a  random  phenomenon. 
    However,  we have found a rather strong generational and familial  link 
    with abductions.  Abductions appear to begin in childhood and  continue 
    throughout adulthood (there are exceptions to this).  We have not found 
    a way to stop abductions. 
     
      During an abduction, characteristic procedures are run on humans that 
    are  quite narrow in their range.  Most people report physical,  mental 
    and reproductive events.  Without going into too much detail,  the main 
    physical  event  is  the examination (there  are  many  other  physical 
    procedures) which is carried on in a surprising manner. The main mental 
    procedure  is  an examination of an abductee's  emotional  state  after 
    observing  some sort of mental imagery.  People's emotions  are  played 
    with and they may feel a calming effect. Likewise it is very common for 
    people to see scenes of atomic explosions, during which they might feel 
    anxiety.  These are part of the mental procedures.  In the reproductive 
    area,  people report that sperm and eggs are harvested from them.  They 
    are  also shown odd looking babies that they are sometimes required  to 
    hold. 
     
      Abductees  are  mentally altered during the abduction so that  it  is 
    extremely  difficult  to  understand  what is  happening  while  it  is 
    happening.   A   selective  form of amnesia is most commonly  in  place 
    immediately  after the abduction so that most people do not  know  what 
    has happened to them--except unconsciously, if that is "knowing." 
     
      Recovering  the  memories is a difficult task.  Not only is  there  a 
    certain   amount  of  trauma  involved,   but  often  there  is   heavy 
    confabulation, false memories, incomplete memories, and pseudo-memories 
    placed   in  the  abductee's  mind  as  part  of   mental   procedures. 
    Furthermore, the physical aftereffects of the phenomenon can be severe-
    -scars, internal scar tissue, eye damage, and so forth. It is, however, 
    the  mental  effects  that  are most  important  for  people's  lives--
    affording  the  most damage and the most  trauma.   Thus  investigating 
    abductions is a very delicate endeavor. One must know what to say, what 
    to ask, what is coming next, what is being skipped over,  what is being 
    held back, what is going to be traumatic, and what is going to have the 
    biggest effect on the abductee whether he/she realizes it or not. Above 
    all,   the investigator must have the psychological acumen to help  the 
    abductee  deal  with  the material both while the  memories  are  being 
    recalled,   and  after  the  session is over.  At  the  same  time  the 
    investigator  must accumulate the most amount of data as is  possible--
    given the enormity and importance of the event. Unfortunately there are 
    few  who can do this.  Sometimes people who need help  with  abductions 
    seek   advice   and   counsel  from  well   meaning   but   incompetent 
    psyhotherapists and even some erstwhile UFO researchers.  Unfortunately 
    not  enough have been trained to service the vast number  of  abductees 
    who need this help.  Budd Hopkins and I have been involved with  trying 
    to  train therapists to deal with abductees.  This is an uphill  battle 
    and  although progress has been made,  we have a long struggle ahead of 
    us. in the meantime, for those of you who think that you might have had 
    abduction experiences,  think very carefully about whether you want  to 
    open up the Pandora's Box of memories and if you decide to go ahead, be 
    extremely careful who you decide upon. The potential for harm is there.
