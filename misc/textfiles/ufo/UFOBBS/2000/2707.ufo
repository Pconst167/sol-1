    REPLY:  By David R. Saunders 

      Last month,  Steven Soter and Carl Sagan offered two counterarguments 
    relating to Terence Dickinson's article,  "The Zeta Reticuli  Incident" 
    (ASTRONOMY, December 1974). 
     
      Their  first argument was to observe that the inclusion of connecting 
    lines  in  certain  maps  "is what a lawyer  would  call  'leading  the 
    witness'."  This was used as the minor premise in a syllogism for which 
    the major premise was never stated. Whether we should consider "leading 
    the witness" a sin or not will depend on how we conceive the purpose of 
    the  original article.  The implied analogy between ASTRONOMY  magazine 
    and  a court of law is tenuous at best;  an expository article  written 
    for a nonprofessional audience is entitled, in my opinion, to do all it 
    can to facilitate communication -- assuming that the underlying message 
    is honest.  Much of what we call formal education is really little more 
    than  "leading  the witness",  and no one who accepts  the  educational 
    goals objects very strongly to this process.  In this context,  we  may 
    also  observe that Soter's and Sagan's first argument provides  another 
    illustrative  example of "leading the witness";  the  argument  attacks 
    procedure,   not  substance --  and serves only to blunt  the  reader's 
    possible criticism of the forthcoming second argument.  This  paragraph 
    may  also be construed as an effort to lead the witness.  Once we  have 
    been  sensitized to the possibilities,  none of us needs to be  further 
    misled! 
     
      The  second  argument  offered  by Soter  and  Sagan  does  attack  a 
    substance.   Indeed,   the editorial decision to publish  the  original 
    article  was a responsible decision only if the issues raised  by  this 
    second  line  of possible argument were fully considered.   Whenever  a 
    statistical  inference  is made from selected data,  it is  crucial  to 
    determine the strenuousness of that selection and then to appropriately 
    discount the apparent clarity of the inference. By raising the issue of 
    the possible effects of selection, Soter and Sagan are right on target. 
    However, by failing to treat the matter with quantitative objectivity ( 
    by  failing  to weigh the evidence in each direction numerically,   for 
    example), they might easily perform a net disservice. 
     
      In some  situations,   the  weight of the appropriate  discount  will 
    suffice to cancel the  clarity of a proposed inference --  and we  will 
    properly dismiss the proposal as a mere capitalization on chance,  or a 
    lucky outcome.  (It is abundantly clear that Soter and Sagan regard the 
    star map results as  just  such a  fortuitous  outcome.)  In some other 
    situations, the weight of the appropriate discount may be fully applied 
    without  accounting for the clarity of the inference as  a  potentially 
    valid  discovery.   For  example,   if I proposed to  infer  from  four 
    consecutive  coin tosses observed as heads that the coin  would  always 
    yield heads, you would properly dismiss this proposal as unwarranted by 
    the data. However, if I proposed exactly the same inference based on 40 
    similar  consecutive observations of heads,  you would almost certainly 
    accept  the inference and begin looking with me for a  more  systematic 
    explanation  of  the data.  The crucial difference here is  the  purely 
    quantitative  distinction  between  4 and 40;  the two  situations  are 
    otherwise   identical  and  cannot  be  distinguished  by  any   purely 
    qualitative argument. 
     
      When   Soter  and  Sagan  use  phrases  such  as  "some  subset  that 
    resembles",  "free also to select the vantage point", "simple matter to 
    optimize",  and "freedom to contrive a resemblance",  they are speaking 
    qualitatively   about  matters  that  should  (and  can)   be   treated 
    quantitatively. Being based only on this level of argument, Soter's and 
    Sagan's conclusions can only be regarded as inconclusive. 
     
      A complete quantitative examination of this problem will require  the 
    numerical estimation of at least three factors, and their expression in 
    a  uniform  metric  so that wee can see which way  the  weight  of  the 
    evidence is leaning.  The most convenient common metric will be that of 
    "bits  of  information",  which is equivalent to  counting  consecutive 
    heads in the previous example. 
     
      One key factor is the degree of resemblance between the Hill map  and 
    the   optimally   similar  computer-drawn  map.   Precisely  how   many 
    consecutive  heads  is this resemblance equivalent to?  A   second  key 
    factor  is the precise size of the population of stars from  which  the 
    computer was allowed to make its selection.  And a third key factor  is 
    the  precise dimensionality of the space in which the computer was free 
    to  choose the best vantage point.  If the first factor exceeds the sum 
    of the other two by a sufficient margin,  we are justified in insisting 
    on a systematic explanation for the data. 
     
      The third factor is the easiest to deal with.  The dimensionality  of 
    the  vantage-point  space is not more than three.  A  property  of  the 
    metric  system for weighing evidence is that each independent dimension 
    of  freedom leads us to expect the equivalent of one  more  consecutive 
    head  in  the  observed data.  Three dimensions of  freedom  are  worth 
    exactly  3.0   bits.   In  the end,  even three bits will  be  seen  as 
    relatively minor. 
     
      The  second  factor  might  be much larger than  this,   and  deserve 
    relatively more discussion. The appropriate discount for this selection 
    will be log2C,  where C is the number of distinct combinations of stars 
    "available" to the computer.  If we were to agree that C must represent 
    the possible combinations of 46  stars taken 14  at a time,  then log2C 
    would  be 37.8  bits;  this would be far more than enough to  kill  the 
    proposed  inference.  However,  not all these combinations are  equally 
    plausible.   We  really  should consider  only  combinations  that  are 
    adjacent  to one another and to the sun,  but it is awkward to  try  to 
    specify exactly which combinations these are. 
     
      The  really exciting moment in working with these data came with  the 
    realization  that  in the real universe,  our sun belongs to  a  closed 
    cluster  together with just six of the other admissible stars  --   Tau 
    Ceti,  82  Eridani, Zeta Tucanae,  Alpha Mensae,  and Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 
    Reticuli. The real configuration of interstellar distances is such that 
    an  explorer  starting from any of the seven should visit all  of  them 
    before  venturing  outside.  If the Hill map is assumed to include  the 
    sun, then it should include the other members of this cluster within an 
    unbroken  network of connections,  and the other connected stars should 
    be relatively adjacent in the real universe. 
     
      Zeta  Reticuli occupies a central position in all of  the  relatively 
    few combinations that now remain plausible. However, in my opinion, the 
    adjacency  criteria  do  leave some remnant  ambiguity  concerning  the 
    combination  of  real stars to be matched against the Hill map --   but 
    only with respect to the region farthest from the sun. The stars in the 
    closed  cluster  and those in the chain leading to Gliese 67   must  be 
    included,   as  well as Gliese 86  and two others from a  set  of  five 
    candidates.  Log2C for this remnant selection is 3.9 bits. we must also 
    notice  that  the  constraint that Zeta Tucanae  be  occulted  by  Zeta 
    Reticuli reduces the dimensionality of the vantage-point space from 3.0 
    to 1.0. Thus, the sum of factors two and three is now estimated as only 
    4.9 bits. 
     
      The first factor is also awkward to evaluate --  simply because there 
    is no standard statistical technique for comparing points on two  maps. 
    Using  an approximation based on rank-order correlation,  I've  guessed 
    that the number we seek here is between 11 and 16.  (This is the result 
    cited by Dickinson on page 15  of the original article.)  Deducting the 
    second  and  third  factors,  this rough analysis  leaves  us  with  an 
    empirical  result whose net meaning is equivalent to observing at least 
    6  to 11 consecutive heads. (I say "at least",  because there are other 
    factors  contributing to the total picture --  not discussed either  by 
    Dickinson  or by Soter and Sagan --  that could be adduced  to  enhance 
    this  figure.   For  example,  the computed vantage point  is  in  good 
    agreement  with Betty Hill's reported position when observing the  map, 
    and  the coordinate system implicit in the boundaries of the map is  in 
    good agreement with a natural galactic coordinate system.  Neither have 
    we discussed any quantitative use of the connections drawn on the  Hill 
    map, which were put there in advance of any of these analyses.) 
     
      In the final interpretation, it will always be possible to argue that 
    5 or 10 or even 15  bits of remarkable information simply isn't enough. 
    However,   this is a matter for each of us to decide independently.  In 
    deciding  this matter,  it is more important that we be consistent with 
    ourselves (as we review a large number of uncertain interpretations  of 
    data that we have made) than that we be in agreement with some external 
    authority.  I do believe, though,  that relatively few individuals will 
    continue  a  coin-tossing  match in which  their  total  experience  is 
    equivalent  to even six consecutive losses.  In scientific matters,  my 
    own standard is that I'm interested in any result that has five or more 
    bits  of information supporting it --  though I prefer not to stick  my 
    neck  out  publicly  on the basis of less than 10.   Adhering  to  this 
    standard,   I   continue  to  find the  star  map  results  exceedingly 
    interesting.
