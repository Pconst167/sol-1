     David/Moderator: Gentlemen, I think we need to call this CO to official 
             | order, is that OK with everybody?
     Jeff Morrow: yes.
     Joe Balsamo: yep
     Steve   | Yes
     David - the other o: go
     David/Moderator: OK.. here we go, first I must get the formalities out of 
             | the way so....
             | I am the moderator and will basically run the CO, if you have a 
             | question type a ?, if you have a comment type a !....
             | I will then call on you each in turn, please do not interrupt 
             | whomever is speaking, when your called on, please send a OK..., 
             | so ..
             | that we know your typing your message.  Finish each line with a 
             | set of elipses, such as ....,.  When you finished, send a GA 
             | to...
             | indicate you are finished.  Everyone understand?...ga
     Joe Balsamo: Yes
     Jeff Morrow: yes
     David - the other o: yes
     David/Moderator: Ok...
             | Joe I think you had something to say?...ha
             | Sorry, I mean ga
     Joe Balsamo: Well, how many people here are familiar with the database 
             | project that we have been discussing in previous COs? GA
     David - the other o: !
     David/Moderator: David, ga
     David - the other o: I know of it's existence.  It seems there is some 
             | concern on duplication of
             | efforts. GA
     David/Moderator: There is concern that we don't want to duplicate the 
             | efforts of groups like CUFOS and MUFON......
             | however we are still trying to continue with the thing and 
             | talking with these groups in turn....ga
     David - the other o: It seems there are two ways to go. A distribute base 
             | or a central base everyone chips into...GA
     David/Moderator: Ok...
             | actually we are taling of doing a combo of each.  This Forum 
             | would be the central base, for now, but the DB would....
             | also be distributed through the normal UFO networks around the 
             | country....
             | The long term goal is to have a Forum dedicated to UFOs and a 
             | database that may be accessed online by anyone....ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David - the other o: ? How far has it gotten in design? GA
     David/Moderator: ok...
     Peter Baitz: !
     David/Moderator: Good question, we started preliminary designed about 2 
             | weeks ago, and we going to continue discussion here today...
             | Nothing has been finalized yet because it involves so much 
             | data..
             | Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: Personally, since David and I are going to the MUFON 
             | convention in New Mexico, I'd like to wait until we have had a 
             | chance to speak 
             | to some of the other people...
             | with UFO databases before we determine a final design.  At this 
             | point, any and all suggestions are welcome.  Obviously, this 
             | thing 
             | could turn into a logistical nightmare if we don't get support 
             | from some of the bigger groups...
             | people on CIS have NO means to check out UFO reports, so I 
             | think our job would be more of a centralized clearing house for 
             | data.  
             | We just don't have the structural organization to do followup 
             | reporting. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter > GA
     Peter Baitz: Greetings all!  I am here finally.  How is it going today? GA
     David/Moderator: Not so bad, we discussing the database as you can 
             | see.....
     David - the other o: !
     Peter Baitz: hello
     David/Moderator: Hello
     Steve   | !
     David/Moderator: You here Peter, we got you.  David F, did you have 
             | something to say? ga
     David - the other o: ok...
             | Yes. A meeting with the other groups is imperitive for 
             | compatability...
             | I would guess that the info is not in the same soft or 
             | standardized entry...
             | forms.  It might be a good idea to inquire or propose such a 
             | standard.  Also...
             | in line with the idea of centralize clearing house.  A 
             | directory of directions... 
             | for research.  you know something like "I'm too busy to deal 
             | with this right...
             | now but it would be interesting to know...".
             | Also maybe a request for data registry...GA
     David/Moderator: Steve > GA
     Steve   | Do you intend to list sightings and call for local support in
             | documenting the event?
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Ok...
             | Thats an interesting point, and one frankly thats never been 
             | brought up before, but it is something that should be ....
             | considered.  As Joe said before, since he and I are attending 
             | the MUFON symposium next month, and we're going to talk to...
             | several researchers there, it may not be a bad idea to wait and 
             | see what they have to say about the whole thing.....
             | Joe > GA
     Jeff Morrow: !!
     Joe Balsamo: Ok...
             | I think that everyone needs to think about what they'd like to 
             | see in a database for doing UFO research.  Obviously, we want 
             | this 
             | thing to be comprehensive, but compatible as well...
             | this point, we need to talk to the orgs such as CUFOS and MUFON 
             | and go on from there.  I think that it might be more productive 
             | for 
             | us to hold off talking...
             | he database until Dave and I get back for the symposium.  
             | Perhaps we should concentrate on the online newsletter which is 
             | standalone and totally...
             | ndent upon just our group...what do you all think?  GA
     David/Moderator: Jeff  > GA
     David>the other: !
     Steve   | ?
     Jeff Morrow: Thanks, David!  I agree with Joe.  ...
             | Each of these groups has its own adgenda, and we are not in the 
             | position...
             | to do our own field inveestigation at this time.  In order to 
             | function  ...
             | as a central database, we must have the support of at least 
             | some of the   ...
             | current research organizations.  I have found that all these 
             | groups...
             | pretty much guard their data, and don't mix well.  I think you 
             | should test...
             | the waters at the conference before jumping into the database, 
             | but let's...
     Peter Baitz: !
     Jeff Morrow: proceed with the newsletter.  I also see that I'm being 
             | paged, and havt leave in a minute.  ...
             | I'll pick up the rest from the transcript.  Ga
     David/Moderator: Sorry to see you go, put I'll post the transcript ASAP, 
             | David > GA
     David>the other: OK...
     Jeff Morrow: Thanks.  Bye. Ga
     David>the other: I concur with Joe and Jeff about the Newsletter. It is 
             | more immediately doable...
             | The key to approaching the other groups is to be valuable to 
             | them...
             | Provide a service that eventually they find they can't do 
             | without.  It ...
             | Must cost some bucks to keep the individual nets up and 
             | running...
             | even with late night data exchanges.  Researchers do tend to 
             | cover thier...
     Steve   | !
     David>the other: data territory rather close until they are ready to 
             | publish...GA
     David/Moderator: I agree completely with  what you and Joe and Jeff 
             | say.....Steve > GA
     David>the other: ?
     Steve   | I agree with Joe on the newsletter, But I must have missed the 
             | initial 
             | premise of the database, would someone please explain.
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe your good at that, would you care to take the ball 
             | for a minute? GA
     Joe Balsamo: Sure...
             | First, I would suggest that everyone download the first two CO 
             | transcripts...
             | these give a detailed description of what we have been 
             | discussing.  In a nutshell, we wanted to create a central 
             | database...
             | that would be available to anyone in the UFO field.  It would 
             | include all verifiable contacts, CE I-V, and any other 
             | pertinant 
             | types of information...
             | e CIS is international and available to so many, it would be an 
             | ideal place for all of this data to be stored. GA
     David/Moderator: Peter, sorry for the wait > GA
     Peter Baitz: No problem.  I was just taking it in- catching up....
             | I see the database , now as a catalog in database form...
             | of existing and any new (via CIS and others) UFO related 
             | reports. GA
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: David > GA
     David>the other: OK...
             | Comment first...that's just the line to take when pitching the 
             | idea to the othergroups...
             | Question is ... who edits the newsletter...I suggest Jeff cause 
             | he's not here?...GA
     David/Moderator: he he he, Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
     Peter Baitz: !
     Joe Balsamo: First, is anyone else in this group planning on going to the 
             | MUFON symposium?  Secondly, I suggest we discuss the online 
             | newsletter 
             | and who all here right now is interested in participating? GA
     David>the other: !
     Peter Baitz: !
     David/Moderator: David > GA
     David>the other: ok...
             | I'm not gonna be able to get anywhere near AZ cause of busyness 
             | here in the city...I second the motion to table...
             | Database discussion and move on to the newsletter...I've got 
             | some time I can give...GA
     David/Moderator: OK.  excellent!  Peter > GA
     Peter Baitz: I am interested as well. What will be the format of the 
             | newsletter...
             | -a lump of articles?  - one file?  Where are we so far inthis 
             | regard? GA
     David/Moderator: Ok....
             | For now we will table the Database idea until Joe and I have a 
             | chance to dicuss it with the people at the symposium.....
     Peter Baitz: !
     David/Moderator: Now for the Newsletter, I don't know what the format 
             | will be, ASCII I suppose, perhaps a series of files, maybe 
             | pictures, maybe ...
             | all ZIPped together.   Comments?   Peter > GA
     David>the other: !
     Peter Baitz: Thanks.....
     Steve   | !
     Peter Baitz: I was in fact interested in the newsletter, just to nake it 
             | clear....
             | Ok GA
     David/Moderator: OK great......David > GA
     David>the other: ok...
             | I've seen some impressive online newsletters (colors menu 
             | capabable)...
             | Morning Star avaliable in one of the libs here is one...But I 
             | don't know what
             | soft...
             | they use to put it together...propriatery or unique I suppose.  
             | A start to get
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David>the other: us  moving fast would be ascii zipped then upgrade.  
             | Does anyone know where/whatmorning star uses?...GA
     David/Moderator: OK....
             | Joe you go first, then Steve you follow...ga
     Joe Balsamo: Thanks...
             | I just called a friend of mine who is a newsletter expert and 
             | she is going to join us...hopefully she'll be here in just a 
             | sec...GA
     Steve   | ASCII & GIFF'S, YES! ZIPPED,
             | THE MORE THE BETTER .=> GA
     David/Moderator: Good deal, I think we're on to something here!..ga
     Joe Balsamo: Hi Deb!
     Deb Carlen: Hello, o spiritual master.
     David/Moderator: Welcome Deb, how are you today?  ga
     Deb Carlen: No one else could call me out on a nanosecond but you.
             |  ga
     Joe Balsamo: If I might but in for a moment...
     David/Moderator: Ok Deb,....
             | Ok  Joe > GA
     Deb Carlen: Someone should re-state the rules for me. GA
     Joe Balsamo: deb is a newsletter expert :)...I think her advise in this 
             | area could be the difference between total success or 
             | failure...sorry 
             | david, thanks for indulging us!...GA
     David/Moderator: OK... deb the rules are simple....
             | If you have a comment type a ! if you have a questions type a 
             | ?, I will call on you in turn with the others....ok...ga
     Deb Carlen: Dave, thank you; Joe, you are too kind. ...GA
     David/Moderator: OK.. Deb, do you know what we trying to do here?   ga
     Deb Carlen: Not really; vaguely ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Joe, I take it youd like to explain?   GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | Basically what we are doing is formulating the idea of 
             | producing a UFO oriented newsletter....
             | right now, it will probably start out in electronic form, but 
             | that is not to say that we may not want it to be in 'real' form 
             | later...
             | Aside form that, the floor is open to suggestions. GA
     David/Moderator: If I may....
             | The newsletter would encompass UFO sights, reports, 
             | investigations, and theories from around the world....
             | it would have articles, pictures perhaps, and reports from 
             | investigators.  Thats my idea basically, any others?  ga
     Deb Carlen: ! and ?
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: Sorry to be late to the idea...
             | but if it's a fax NL, who's doing what...
             | there are so many things I want to tell you about the effort I 
             | don't know where to start
             | ga
     David>the other: !
     David/Moderator: David > GA
     David>the other: ok...Simple start would be bundle of articles/gifs ect 
             | zipped together left in... 
             | Library and/or sent to a mailing list on/offline.  I've seen 
             | soft that makes online look really good.  We (have we?) chose 
             | Jeff as editor
             | what was that???...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: The editor is still up for grabs.....
     David>the other: Chosing strawboss, contributers (putting out a call for 
             | submissions), format,...what else...GA
     Deb Carlen: !
     David/Moderator: At this point its me and Joe, buts ANYONE else is 
             | welcome!
     David>the other: JEFF!!
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
             | Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | David the othe, I appreciate you wanting to volunteer Jeff 
             | ;)...but since he isn't here, I think we need to make sure the 
             | editor 
             | will be someone that is impecably reliable. The staff is going 
             | to have to consist...
             | going to be able to stick with this thing. That is, IMHO, the 
             | most important aspect. GA
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: I suggest (humbly, please) that whomever's to be involved on 
             | any level, take the course I teach...
             | and I'll get you in for free.  I'm in the midwest in July.  
             | Where are you all (y'all) located?
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Well I'm in Missouri...ga
     Deb Carlen: St. Louis - July 7 ga
     David>the other: NYC
     Joe Balsamo: Well, looks like David is it ;)
     Deb Carlen: Just missed you; the boss is there now but I can't get you in 
             | there til next time ga
     David/Moderator: July 7, I can make that, where...ga
     Deb Carlen: St Louis Marriott West - I'll email you details; be sure I 
             | get your CIS id.  GA
             | !
     David/Moderator: Good deal, Joe has my Id if you need it.   Deb > GA 
             | again!
     Deb Carlen: Sorry... just wanted to say that the course covers all 
             | aspects of NL production: writing, editing, DTP etc. I just 
             | missed Joe in SDiego, 
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Cool.. I'll look forward to it.....
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: OK, so I'll be editor, for some reason, and Joe is gonna 
             | be assitant editor, right Joe? GA
     Deb Carlen: ?
     Joe Balsamo: Uh, er, yeah sure!...
             | I was just going to mention that we have lost about half of our 
             | group...I wonder what we should do at this point?  GA
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: What is anticipated scope of editorial mix/target audience?
     David>the other: !
     Deb Carlen: ga
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: David > GA
     Deb Carlen: Sorry David/Mod
     David>the other: OK...
             | How about the client nets first then broaden it out to general 
             | public if there'sinterest...ga
     Deb Carlen: !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: ok...
             | I was pretty much going to echo what David other said (jeez, 
             | can we call one of you guys dave?)  but I think that it will 
             | start out 
             | as an online NL...
     guys dave?: !
     Joe Balsamo: and then progress to a physical nl from there.  Obviously, 
             | the people that are going to be interested are the same people 
             | on here, 
             | and if it is good...
             | it will just grow from there, hopefully...hahahah (guys dave, 
             | love it!) GA
     David/Moderator: If I may interfect something.....
             | It might not be a bad idea to make the thing proprietary of 
             | this Forum, but allow PUBLIC ditribution....
             | I have several friends with private networks who would be 
             | interested in helping to distribute it.......Deb > GA
             | BTW call me BOSS....;-)
     Deb Carlen: OK: Boss, guys Dave & Joe...hmmm we've got a lot to consider. 
             |  You're giving away copyright, yes?...
     David/Moderator: Deb . GA
     NOT da BOSS: ?
     Deb Carlen: if you're making it proprietary/ok to public distrib
             | OK da Boss, but da means something else to me ;)
     NOT da BOSS: :)
     David/Moderator: OK da > GA
     NOT da BOSS: ok...
             | Question one can you keep Copywrite and still make public 
             | nonlimited distr?...seems I've seen it done...
     Deb Carlen: !
     NOT da BOSS: Question two having given away copywrite can it be regained 
             | down the road?
             | ...ga
     David/Moderator: Remember folks, we are in a FORMAL CO here.....
             | Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: NO; IT'S A USE IT OR LOSE IT LAW. It would take an hour to 
             | explain.
             | but I'll send you all email. ga
     David/Moderator: Well...
             | we want it availble to everyone, but I would think we also 
             | would want it clear just WHERE it came from...ga
     Deb Carlen: 1
             | !
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: OK...
             | You can do that and still maintain a certain amt of control...
             | but I think we're jumping the gun (my fault actually)...
     JOE     | do what?
     Deb Carlen: to get into this before the edit/mktg is set up. ga
     David/Moderator: Joe,....
             | this is a formal CO discussing the possiblity of starting a 
             | electronic UFO newsletter.
             | Joe B, do you have anything to say....ga
     Joe Balsamo: ?
             | Yes...
     David/Moderator: Joe B > GA
     Joe Balsamo: I was just going to as Deb, since she is our resident 
             | expert, what we should do first.  At this point, what do you 
             | suggest, besides 
             | David taking the course? GA
     Deb Carlen: !
     David/Moderator: Is this course free?............Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: Usually $295. I have some discretion with guests. 
             | It's a full day.  You'll be exhausted.
             | ga
             | !
     David/Moderator: OK, I hope you have a LOT of descretion with guests! ;-) 
             |  Deb > GA
     Deb Carlen: Hmmm.  This could be interesting...
             | First, draw up a list of topics...
             | then a preliminary format, concurrent with a mktg plan ga
     David/Moderator: Anyone have any suggestions for any of these 
             | suggestions?   GA
     Dave    | !
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: Dave > GA
     Dave    | OK...
             | Info gathering (esp from GOV'T ie FOIA), contacts of field 
             | workers, history of areas...ga
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
     Dave    | !
     Joe Balsamo: I was going to suggest that we gather the topics and such in 
             | a manner similar to the one we were going to do with the 
             | database...
             | les post a message on UFO forum suggesting what we are up to 
             | and ask the group what topics and the like they'd like to see...
             | The stuff that Dave mentioned is a good start (BTW, I have ALL 
             | of the FOIA's ever filed dealing with UFOs) GA
     Deb     | !
     David/Moderator: Dave > GA
     Dave    | OK...
             | also sociological effects of the concept (RAW Higher 
             | intelligence, Benevolent space brothers ect)...
     Joe Balsamo: !
     Dave    | I agree with Joe on posting a rfc but we can't depend on it...GA
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb     | use Joe's/Dave's suggestions you'll need 2 senior copy editors 
             | right off the bat.  Info processing will be enormous.
             | that's OK but be prepared.
             | ga
     Dave    | !
     David/Moderator: Joe > GA
     Joe Balsamo: OK...
             | I assume by RAW, you mean Robert Anton Wilson?...
     Dave    | Yes
     Joe Balsamo: This is something we need to discuss right off the bat is 
             | just how far in which direction we want to go with this nl...
             | do we want it to be purely scientific, or do we want to explore 
             | ALL possibilities. GA
     David/Moderator: Dave > GA
     Deb     | !
     Dave    | ok...
             | I was thinking this permature but do we want to establish a 
             | point of contact...
             | From what Deb just said (a bit upward re copy ed) it sounds 
             | like there should be one userid where decisions come from...ga
     David/Moderator: Deb > GA
     Deb     | We need a mission statement first first first; that's the 
             | hardest of all, THEN we do the editorial mix
             | And yes, Dave, you need a senior head honcho to make decisions. 
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Ok....
             | Since I'm section Leader of the UFO section, I guess I should 
             | be like main contact?....Also, Deb could you explain this....
             | mission statement for me a bit?...ga
     Deb     | Yup...
             | It's a statement of purpose: why the NL will exist...
     Dave    | !
     Deb     | it doesn't have to be a major report, just a few sentences.  it 
             | also establishes your credibility. ga
     David/Moderator: Dave > GA
     Dave    | OK...
             | SOP Art 1 To support and deseminate research on the phenom 
             | UFO...ga
     David/Moderator: OK....
     Joe Balsamo: !
     David/Moderator: I think Dave pretty much hit it on the head!
             | Joe > GA
     Deb     | !
     Joe Balsamo: I still think we need to be real clear up front which 
             | approach we are going to take with this...
             | as you all well know, one can take a 'purely' scientific 
             | approach, or one can open it up to all things...what do you all 
             | think? GA
     Dave    | !
     David/Moderator: If I may....
             | I think we should TRY and maintain a combination of a 
             | Scientific AND Neutral approach instead of leaning one....
             | way or the other like other publications do.  Lets present the 
             | facts, as we know them....
             | David > GA
     Dave    | OK...
             | The purely sci approach is one open to almost everything...If 
             | you are saying lets not pander to the fringe...
             | I concour...However the phenom itself is so truly weird that 
             | some strange thingsare gonna come up...I...
             | Favor straight reporting and not preaching the great Space 
             | brothers come to save us from ourselves...
             | But those who belive are also a part of the phenom...
             | Additionally, the phenom might not be a straight type of thing. 
             | Constant and open to the objective approach...
             | Wasn't it Vallee who was approached by an ex-intelligence 
             | officer who said that the trouble with...
             | the scientific approach in this matter is that science views 
             | information free for the taking...
             | and that ufo's seem to be telling whoever what they want to 
             | hear?  Like an intellop laying lots of mutually...
             | conflicting info out there to be taken as gospel....GA
     Deb     | !
     David/Moderator: I'm sorry Deb, please GA
     Deb     | OK
             | This is the type of discussion that results in good 
             | organization; you may want to ...
             | let the idea gel a bit before the statement is written...
             | you see how it spins out the ed mix already.  You have two 
             | issues of ideas/topics now.
             | ga
     David/Moderator: Your right Deb, I think we should think about this 
             | awhile.  What does everyone else think? GA
     Dave    | !
     David/Moderator: Dave > GA
     Dave    | OK...I'm thinking that it might be time to sked another 
             | meeting...Deb pse join...
     Deb     | !
