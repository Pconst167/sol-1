                    A POSSIBLE REASON FOR THE GLOWING UFOS?
                   -----------------------------------------

      Edmond Murad of the Phillips Laboratory, located at Hanscom Air Force 
    Base,   Massachusetts,   has been experimenting and  investigating  the 
    phenomenon that spacecraft,  while orbiting the Earth,  sometimes  give 
    off a yellowish-gold glow. 

      He  has  discovered that nitric oxide atoms forms  nitrogen  dioxide. 
    When  the reaction takes place electrons in the molecules  of  nitrogen 
    dioxide  become  excited  and leave the space shuttle's surface.    The 
    electrons then return to their normal state.  In so doing they give off 
    a light, an  aura,  that appears around twenty centimeters out from the 
    shuttle aurface. 

      Could this be an explanation for the many golden colored UFOs seen by 
    witnesses?   Likely the same reaction would occur off the surface of  a 
    UFO as happens to our space shuttles.
