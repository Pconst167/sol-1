    IS THE FISH INTERPRETATION UNIQUE? 

    By Robert Sheaffer 

      The  story  of  Marjorie  Fish's attempts  at  identifying  the  star 
    patterns  sketched  by  Betty  Hill  was told  in  "The  Zeta  Reticuli 
    Incident" by Terence Dickinson in the December 1974 issue. This pattern 
    of  solar type stars unquestionably bears a striking resemblance to the 
    map that Betty Hill says she saw while she was being examined aboard  a 
    flying saucer.  But how significant is this resemblance?  Is there only 
    one pattern of stars which will match the sketch convincingly? 
    
      Betty Hill herself discovered an impressive resemblance in a star map 
    published  in the New York Times.  In 1965  a  map of the stars of  the 
    constellation  Pegasus  appeared in that newspaper,   accompanying  the 
    announcement  by a Russian radio astronomer (Comrade Sholomitsky)   the 
    radio  source  CTA-102,   depicted  in the map,   may  be  sending  out 
    intelligent radio signals.  Intrigued by this remarkable claim,   Betty 
    Hill  studied the map,  and added the corresponding star names  to  her 
    sketch.  As you can see, the Pegasus map --  while not exactly like the 
    sketch --  is impressively similar.  If CTA-102  --  appearing near the 
    "globes"   in her sketch --  was in reality an artificial radio source, 
    that would give the Pegasus map much additional credibility. 
    
      However,  the case for the artificial origin of quasar CTA-102   soon 
    fell  flat.   Other scientists were unable to  observe  these  reported 
    strange variations which had caused Sholomitsky to suggest that CTA-102 
    might be pulsing intelligently. 
    
      In 1966,  when Marjorie Fish was just beginning her work,  Charles W. 
    Atterberg (employed by an aeronautical communications firm in Illinois) 
    also set out to attempt to identify this star pattern. 
    
      "I began my search by perusing a star atlas I had on hand," Atterberg 
    explained.   "I  soon  realized that this was a  pointless  and  futile 
    project."   Any  star pattern useful for interstellar  navigation,   he 
    reasoned, would not be Earth-centered as are the familiar constellation 
    figures. Thus Atterberg began to look in three dimensions for a pattern 
    of stars that would approximate the Hill sketch. 
    
      Working  from a list of the nearest stars,  Atterberg "began plotting 
    these stars as they would be seen from various directions.  I  did this 
    by drawing the celestial position of a star,  I  would draw a  straight 
    line penetrating the sphere at a known position, and measure out to the 
    distance of the star...It at first took me hours to plot this out  from 
    any one particular direction." 
    
      When plotting the stars as seen from a position indefinitely far away 
    on the celestial equator at 17 hours right ascension, Atterberg found a 
    pattern  of stars conspicuously similar to the Hill sketch.  After much 
    work he refined this position to 17 hours 30 minutes right ascension, -
    10   degrees declination.  The resulting map resembles the Hill  sketch 
    even  more strongly than does the Fish map,  and it contains a  greater 
    number  of  stars.   Furthermore,  all of the  stars  depicted  in  the 
    Atterberg  map  lie within 18.2  light-years of the sun.  The Fish  map 
    reaches out 53 light-years, where our knowledge of stellar distances is 
    much less certain. 
    
      Carl Sagan states in Intelligent Life in the Universe that, excluding 
    multiple star systems, "the three nearest stars of potential biological 
    interest are Epsilon Eridani,  Epsilon Indi and Tau Ceti."  These three 
    stars from the heart of the Atterberg map,  defining the two spheres in 
    the  very center of the heavy lines that supposedly represent the major 
    "trade routes" of the "UFOnauts". Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti were the 
    two stars listened to by Project Ozma,  the pioneering radio search for 
    intelligent civilization in space. 
    
      Other heavy lines connect the spheres with the sun, which we know has 
    at least one habitable planet.  Thinner lines,  supposedly representing 
    places  visited  less  frequently,   connect  with  Groombridge   1618, 
    Groombridge 34,  61  Cygni and Sigma Draconis,  which are designated as 
    stars  "that could have habitable planets"  in Stephen H.  Dole's  Rand 
    Corporation  study,  Habitable Planets for Man.  Of the 11  stars  (not 
    counting the sun) that have allegedly been visited by the aliens, seven 
    of them appear  on Dole's list.  Three of the four  stars which are not 
    included are stopping points on the trip to Sigma Draconis,  which Dole 
    considered  to  have  even better prospects  than  Epsilon  Eridani  or 
    Epsilon Indi for harboring a habitable planet. 
    
      Another  remarkable aspect of the Atterberg map is the fact that  its 
    orientation, unlike the Fish map, is not purely arbitrary. Gould's belt 
    --   a   concentration  of the sky's brightest  stars  --   is  exactly 
    perpendicular  to the plane of the Atterberg map.  Furthermore,  it  is 
    vertical in orientation;  it does not cut obliquely across the map, but 
    runs exactly up and down. A third curious coincidence: The southpole of 
    the Atterberg map points toward the brightest part of  Gould's belt, in 
    the  constellation  Carina.  The bright stars comprising  Gould's  belt 
    might  well  serve  as  a  useful  reference  frame  for   interstellar 
    travelers,   and  it  is  quite  plausible  that  they  might  base   a 
    navigational coordinate system upon it. 
    
      No  other map interpreting the Hill sketch offers any  rationale  for 
    its choice of perspectives.  The problem with trying to interpret Betty 
    Hill's sketch is that it simply fits too many star patterns. Three such 
    patterns   have   been  documented  to  date.   How  many  more   exist 
    undiscovered?
