                         Julie's story

Julie Greaves was picking flowers with her two young children
when she "looked up to see a huge orangey-pink ball of light".
Her daughter screamed: "Mummy, the moon's coming towards us."
When she returned to her home in Merseyside she discovered she
had lost an hour of her life.

Months later under hypnotic regression she recalled being
subjected to humiliating examinations by six Aliens "I have feelings
of guilt, shame and disgust,"says Julie, now 50 years old. "There
were six tall figures all looking identical in dark cover-alls up
to their necks. "Their hair was dark and their eyes were black and
almond shaped. I experienced a floating sensation. "Next, I was on
a table being examined and had a feeling of ice being put on my legs."

                      Bob's story

Bob Taylor a Forestry worker says he fought off two aliens as he
worked in woodlands near Livingstone, Scotland. The small silver
suited creatures apparently appeared from a giant spacecraft and
clawed at Bob's trousers but he beat them back. "They were ripping
my trousers and cutting my legs,"he said.

Bob moved out of the area in 1986 but the local council erected a
plaque at the sight to commemorate his terrifying ordeal.

                     Ray's story

Publisher Ray McMahon says he was kidnapped from a park bench
in Eltham, south London. "I was whisked aboard a space ship and
examined by a surgeon. I thought it was a helicopter at first,"
said the 38-year old. I nearly passed out. When I came to I was
in a five cornered room with a man who looked like a surgeon
wearing a plastic suit." Ray regained consciousness on is back
in the park.
