SUBJECT: THE LITTLE MEN OF NORTH HUDSON PARK                 FILE: UFO2416





At around 2:45 A.M. on January 12, 1975, George O'Barski was driving home 
through North Hudson Park, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from 
Manhattan, when static filled his radio. Leaning forward to fiddle with the 
dial, he noticed a light to his left. A quick glance, followed by an 
astonished stare, revealed its source: a dark, round object with vertical, 
brilliantly lit windows. It was heading in the same direction as the car and 
emitted a humming sound.

O'Barski slowed down for a better view. The UFO entered a playing field and 
hovered a few feet off the ground. A panel opened between two windows, and a 
ladder emerged. Seconds later about ten identically clad little figures - they 
wore white onepiece outfits with hoods or helmets that obscured their facial 
features - came down the ladder. Each figure dug a hole in the soil with a 
spoonlike device and dumped the contents into a bag each carried. The figures 
then rushed back into the ship, which took off toward the north. The entire 
incident had lasted less than four minutes.

Months later O'Barski confided the story to a long-time customer and 
acquaintance, Budd Hopkins, who was interested in UFOs. Hopkins and two fellow 
investigators subsequently found independent witnesses who verified the 
presence of a brightly lit UFO in the park at the time of O'Barski's sighting, 
although only O'Barski was close enough to see the little figures. One 
witness, a doorman at an apartment complex bordering the park, said that as 
he watched the object, he heard a high-pitched vibration, and the lobby window 
broke just as the UFO departed.
