    My sighting took place in 1977 at my home along the central California 
coast line at Santa Cruz. I had been tied down for years raising a family and 
running a small Mom and Pop business. I worked many hours both day and night 
with no time to play. To run a small business it takes lots of family 
cooperation. After my daughters grew up and got married and left home, I sold 
out.

    What freedom! I bought an old '67 pick-up truck and stared a handy-man 
fixer up business. I drove the old Chev north to Bellingham to visit my 
brother, Lee. We had not had much contact while growing up. He felt so 
grateful that I had come all that way that he gave me a old CB radio. A 
citizen band rig some guy had given him. Now I could cuss out smokey bear and 
say buzz words like ten four good buddy on my way back.

    A boisterous signal came over the air "Get yourself a side band rig with 
all the extra channels in it and talk to those women down under in 
Australia." I could hardy believe this. So I traded in the old CB for a side 
band rig with all the off limit military channels in it. While struggling to 
get my antenna higher, watching it careful, keeping it from falling, I saw 
five flying discs going to some kind of intelligent formation in an orderly 
south-westerly way. One would peel off and come down a little lower, hover for 
a few seconds and then zoom back up to join the others. Then another took its 
place and did the same thing. It was a clear day approximately 1:00 p.m. They 
were approximately 30,000 to 40,000 feet high. I am not a fruit cake. This 
happened to me. So who is going to believe it? So I kept quite until now. The 
question is how are we going to make contact? As slow as things are going, 
when it does happen I will be gone to meet my maker. Or maybe the real contact 
will be made after death. It has been said by reliable sources that they are 
non-human intelligence waiting for the right time.

    We all have to answer to a higher power. Maybe them or that. One thing 
for sure, there is truth in some of these sightings. Lets keep our minds and 
eyes open. Lets all watch and wait . One PhD of math and inventions said "I'll 
believe it when they come and give me a ride in it." If there was contact 
would there be panic, pain, peace, war or what? We do know that they have 
secrets that we would like to have. Wouldn't it be great if I I Me! is the one 
that they would like to talk to and show proof. Hey! this book would sell like 
crazy!

    Old Jack in Gilroy said over the air (Ham Radio) "They are us. They have 
been in control since the beginning of time. We don't know it yet. The time 
isn't right. When that time comes we will all know about it. But you and I who 
are in our 70s will be in a different dimension." My brother Lee said "there 
were dairy cows killed near Bellingham by Big Foot. He cut away some body 
parts and left some to rot away in the pasture. The police and the firemen 
were looking for plastic bags and boxes to put the remains in. Right out here 
close by, but no one has seen Big Foot yet. But he is around here in the 
woods." Come on Lee, how do we know it wasn't UFO people or things? There is 
no proof yet but there will be."

    Some informed persons speculate that UFOs have been visiting here on earth 
for years, taking humans and body parts back to their home planet. The 
Russians and the Americans said "Okay! We won't do anything just give us the 
formula for the speed of light." I don't know? Do you know? Let's share. There 
is some indication that celestial life forms help build the pyramids. Strange 
things in the Yucatan and the lost city of Atlantis have been reported.

    In my laymans point of view, which is probable as good as the expert and as 
much as there is tons of information dumped on us daily by world wide computer 
inter nets 40 thousand nets all linked, we are still in there guessing. No 
politicians want to risk being called a fruit cake, so they throw money at 
experiments, like radio astronomy. They monitor the whole spectrum with many 
parabolic dishes located around the world. It is possible U.F.O. 
communications are outside of man's ability to detect. In other words, a 
different dimension. Animals, birds, and insects communicate and we have not 
be able to break their codes. The only thing we have going for us is signals 
going at the speed of light 186,000 miles a second. You can't see or feel 
them, but they are there. We can not see 90% of the universal mass , no light 
is reflected from it. We are stumped and amazed at what we don't know. We have 
a long way to go, on the other hand it could be a big cover-up.

    Sgt. Boby Lee Chippen, a combat Vietnam Veteran and squad leader during 
the heat of combat had a sighting. His squad of Nationals were resting in the 
shad after a long hot patrol. Low and behold! right in front of them at tree 
top level appeared a large grey disc. Hovering, seemingly looking at them. One 
national cocked his machine gun ready to shoot. "No No" Chippen hallard, 
"American American". It quickly shot side ways, zoomed over to the other side 
of the valley, hovered for a few more second's, then zoomed out of sight over 
the hills. "What the hell is that? They were aghast. Who the hell is going to 
believe that, they said, so they did not report anything.
