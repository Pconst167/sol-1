Vero Beach, Fla. -- Ben and Pattie Cramer lived next door to a space alien for 
two mind-numbing months but when they finally got enough nerve to go to the 
police, the creature disappeared!

Entries in a diary that the couple kept and eventually turned over to 
detectives alleged that the neighbor:

1. Drank chlorine bleach straight up from a jug.

2. Slept standing up in his front yard.

3. Took air and soil readings with sophisticated electronic devices at least 
once a week.

4. Disciplined his daughter with a hand-held laser.

5. Glistened like aluminum foil when he stood in the sun.

6. Preferred static to music on the radio.

7. Grazed on his own shrubbery.

8. Was terrified of water and once screamed in agony when he was caught in the 
rain.

Incredibly, there's more. The Cramers said the neighbor could vanish and 
materialize at will and on two occasions ate hot coals he snitched from their 
backyard grill.

"I knew that 'thing' was trouble from the first time I laid eyes on him," said 
Mrs. Cramer.

"I still get goose bumps just thinking about it. We're lucky he didn't kill us 
with his laser gun."

As incredible as the couple's story sounds, police say it may be rooted in 
fact.

They said that photographs taken by Mrs. Cramer appear to show the neighbor 
punishing his daughter with a laser weapon.

And tape recordings made outside his house captured the high frequency, siren-
like "messages" that he transmitted skyward for 39 seconds every night.

"The man was clearly exhibiting some strange behavior but when we went to 
question him the house was empty and he and his daughter were gone," a local 
policeman confirmed.

"Oddly enough, a UFO was sighted in the area that very same day. And while 
that doesn't necessarily mean he was a space alien the evidence seems to 
suggest that he was," said the cop, who requested anonymity.

Said Ben Cramer: "We should have gone to the police as soon as we suspected 
that our neighbor was an extraterrestrial. I want to kick myself every time I 
think about it."
