This interesting paper begins with a review of the famous "Hill Case", the 
quintessential UFO abduction case.  Attention is focussed on the "star map" 
which Betty Hill was shown by the "Leader" and later reproduced under 
hypnotic regression. Marjory Fish's solution of that map is then discussed. 

An interpretitive analysis of the interaction between Betty Hill and the 
"Leader", and noticing two small curved lines in the largest circles of the 
Hill Star Map led Koch and Kyborg to seek their own, new solution to the star 
map. 

In their analysis of the "Leader's" presentation of the star map to Betty, 
they discerned that the "Leader" had obtained enough information to determine 
Betty's limited astrnomical knowledge; mostly about the planets in our own 
solar system.  They then postulated that the "Leader" presented information 
to Betty in a frame of reference with which Betty should have been familliar.  
When Betty "failed the test" by not recognizing the location of Earth in the 
map, the "Leader" closed the map from view. Perhaps, Koch/Kyborg reasoned, it 
WAS our own solar system that Betty was shown. 

Wondering if the two small curved lines across the two large circles in the 
map foreground indicated the rings of Saturn and Jupiter, they used a 
computer to plot the positions of the various bodies of our solar system at 
the time of the Hill abduction.  With some work, and one major assumption, 
they found a good match to the Hill Star Map within our own solar system. 

The "major assumption" to which we refer is that their best solution comes not 
on the day of the actual abduction but on a day about one month later during 
the nights that Betty Hill experienced nightmares of the abduction and saw 
the star map again in her dreams.  These nightmares ocurred only once.  

To us, the most suggestive detail is that the Koch/Kyborg solution accounts 
elegantly for a detail of the Hill Star Map that the Fish solution does not 
address: a small central circle drawn with a thick line.  The position of our 
sun coincides with this feaure of the map in the proposed solution.  This was 
discovered after the other correspondences were accounted for. 

The researchers' logic is plausible, with the possible exception of the date
and its rationale. 

The text is accompanied by several illustrations of the Hill Star Map as 
drawn by Betty Hill, and printouts of the computer generated diagrams of the 
solar system indicating the proposed solution.  Some of these printouts were 
difficult to read, but did show the solution as stated. 

We feel that this proposed solution of the star map is worthy of serious 
consideration.  In our view, the Koch/Kyborg proposal is generally as 
plausible as is Ms. Fish's. 

This paper is not currently available in the U.S. to the best of our 
knowledge.  It certainly should be, and no doubt will be available.
