                             THE ROSWELL DECLARATION




Forty-seven years ago, an incident occurred in the southwestern desert of the 
United States that could have significant implications for all mankind. It 
involved the recovery by the U.S. military of material alleged to be of 
extraterrestrial origin. The vent was announced by the U.S. military on July 
8, 1947, through a press release that was carried by newspapers throughout the 
country. It was subsequently denied by what is now believed to be a cover 
story claiming the material was nothing more than a weather balloon. It has 
remained veiled in government secrecy ever since.

The press release announcing the unusual event was issued by the commander of 
the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field, Colonel William Blanchard, who 
later went on to become a four star general and vice chief of staff of the 
United States Air Force. That the weather balloon story was a cover-up has 
been confirmed by individuals directly involved, including the late General 
Thomas DuBose who took the telephone call from Washington, DC, ordering the 
cover-up. Numerous other credible military and civilian witnesses have 
testified that the original press release was correct and the Roswell wreckage 
was of extraterrestrial origin. One such individual was Major Jesse Marcel, 
the intelligence officer of the 509th Bomb Group and one of the first military 
officers at the scene.

On January 12, 1994, United States Congressman Steven Schiff of Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, announced to the press that he had been stonewalled by the Defense 
Department when requesting information regarding the 1947 Roswell event on 
behalf of constituents and witnesses. Indicating that he was seeking further 
investigation into the matter, Congressman Schiff called the Defense 
Department's lack of response astounding and concluded it was apparently 
another government cover-up.

History has shown that unsubstantiated official assurances or denials by 
government are often meaningless. There is a logical and straightforward way 
to ensure that the truth about Roswell will emerge: an Executive Order 
declassifying any information regarding the existence of UFOs or 
extraterrestrial intelligence. Because this is a unique issue of universal 
concern, such an action would be appropriate and warranted. To provide 
positive assurance for all potential witnesses, it would need to be clearly 
stated and written into law. Such a measure is essentially what presidential 
candidate Jimmy Carter promised and then failed to deliver to the American 
people 18 years ago in 1976.

If, as is officially claimed, no information on Roswell, UFOs, or 
extraterrestrial intelligence is being withheld, and Executive Order 
declassifying it would be a mere formality, as there would be nothing to 
disclose. The order would, however, have the positive effect of setting the 
record straight once and for all. Years of controversy and suspicion would be 
ended, both in the eyes of the United States own citizens and in the eyes of 
the world.

If, on the other hand, the Roswell witnesses are telling the truth and 
information on extraterrestrial intelligence does exist, it is not something 
to which a privileged few in the United States government should have 
exclusive rights. It is knowledge of profound importance to which all people 
throughout the world should have an inalienable right. Its release would 
unquestionably be universally acknowledged as an historic act of honestly and 
goodwill.

I support the request, as outlined above, for an executive order declassifying 
any U.S. government information regarding the existence of UFOs or 
extraterrestrial intelligence. Whether such information exists or whether it 
does not, I feel that the people of the world have a right to know the truth 
about this issue and that it is time to put an end to the controversy 
surrounding it.
