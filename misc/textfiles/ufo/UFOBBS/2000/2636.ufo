                      SIGHTINGS AND SIDE EFFECTS

 Animals and humans frequently suffer physical reactions to UFO
visitations such as buzzing in the ears or dizziness. In the
cases that follow, zoo animals stampede, soldiers are
paralysed, and an Argentinian girl weeps for days after an
extraordinary close encounter with a humanoid.

   One of the most spectacular of all 'light in the sky' UFO
sightings took place over the city of Tananarive, capital of
Madagascar (The Malagasy Republic), one day in August 1954.
   Edmond Campagnac, head of Technical Services of Air France,
was waiting at the time with a group of people outside the Air
France office on the Avenue de la Leberation for the arrival of
the mail from Paris.
   Suddenly, Campagnac saw a luminous green ball in the sky. It
was descending, almost vertically, like a meteorite. Other
people followed his gaze, and the object was seen to disappear
behind mountains to the south of the city.
   The time was 5.45 p.m. and dusk was approaching, although
the setting sun was still visible. While the group waited
outside the Air France office, they were joined by scores of
others on the streets as people began their journeys home from
work. They, too, were witnesses to the luminous ball.
   The witnesses were still watching when an object of the same
colour as that seen seconds earlier appeared over the hills
near the old Queen's Palace, this time 'flying' horizontally
and at a slower speed. The UFO curved past the government
buildings, still appearing like a green ball. Soon it was
descending even lower, almost to roof-top height, and heading
along the eastern side of the Avenue de la Liberation, just
above the building opposite the Air France office.
   Then, as the light drew level with the group they saw that
it was in fact TWO objects. A lentil[lense]-shaped device was
leading the way, and this was described as having the colour
of an 'electric-green luminous gas'. Following some 100 feet
(30 metres) behind was a metallic-looking cylindrical object,
probably about 130 feet (40 metres) in length. While described
by some as a 'cigar', others said it looked more like the
fusalage of the contemporary Constellation arcraft shorn of
fins, elevators, wings and engines. The surface of the cylinder
reflected the dying rays of the sun, while behind it there
splayed a plume of orange-red flame. Eyewitnesses estimated
that the objects were travelling in the region of 185 miles
per hour (300 km/h).
   People stopped and gazed in amazement at the phenomenon, so
much so that a pall of quietness hung over the city. The giant
cigar and its lenticular companion were completely silent. Then
there was another shock for the observers. As the objects went
over the buildings, all the electric lights were extinguished,
coming on again only after the objects had passed.
   The strange aerial duo continued over the city towards
Tananarive airport, and then swung away to the West. Before
passing from sight, they skimmed over a zoological park where
the animals, which were normally quiet and undisturbed by
aircraft flying into and out of the airport, went into a panic
and stampeded through fences. It was several hours before
soldiers and police could round them up, and before they
returned to a somewhat calmer state.
   Not surprisingly, there was a great furore in Tananarive
over this invasion of Madagascan airspace, and an official
enquiry was set up by General Fleurquin, the Air Force
Commandant. This was conducted by Father Coze, director of the
Tananarive Observatory. Father Coze had been at the observatory
at the time of the incident and had himself witnessed the
passage of the UFOs. He estimated that at least 20,000 people
had seen the objects, and he and his helpers questioned more

report.
   It is not known what happened to his report of this
remarkable encounter. If it ever reached France, it certainly
failed to arouse interest. Details were known only to a handful
of French researchers and to 'Flying Saucer Review', which
received an account from Rene Fouere of the Groupement d'Etude
de Phenomenes Aeriens (GEPA). But not a hint of the affair was
revealed to the French public until 1974, when Jean-Claude
Bourret broadcast his famous series of programmes on Radio
France-Inter, transcripts of which appeared in his book, 'The
Crack in the Universe'.

 A SHINING EGG
   In May 1967, there was another alarming close encounter in
Madagascar. But it was to take 10 years before news of the
incident reached 'Flying Saucer Review' from the French
research group Lumieres dans la Nuit. On this occasion, the
reason for the extraordinary delay was that the witnesses were
23 soldiers, their officer and four NCOs of the French Foreign
Legion. and they were forbidden to discuss the affair with
anyone at all. The eventual informant was a legionnaire named
