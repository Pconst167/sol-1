SUBJECT: Boeing 737, Ufo sighting, Great Brittain.           FILE: UFO2849




To all.

A fellow ufo investigator from Germany made me notice a German tabloid paper
called 'Bild' which showed a ufo article. So I was able to buy this newspaper
in a Dutch bookstore.
This is a translation.

Bild, 30 January 1995.

Ufo over England attacks Boeing 737.
Ufo alarm in cockpit.
A Boeing 737 from British Airways, Flight Mainland-Manchester, (60
passengers).
Captain Roger Wills stated: "We were already above Great-Brittain. Suddenly a
mysterious, fiercely illuminated triangle was heading towards our machine in
a straight way. We thought of the worst. We drew in our heads because we
thought we are going to collide. But in the last second the object passed our
airplane on the right side".
The captain immediately alarmed the nearest control-tower. The answer from
the
control-tower: "Besides you we didn't see anything on the radar!".
At this moment the British airtraffic control handles the case.

Any comments from Great Brittain?
