SECRET ADVANCED VEHICLES DEMONSTRATE TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE MILITARY USE

     Advanced secret aircraft developed at highly classified government
facilities in the Nevada desert over the last decade are demonstrating and
validating new technologies for the U.S.'s future fighters, bombers and
reconnaissance platforms.

     Although facilities in remote areas of the Southwest have been home to
classified vehicles for decades, the number and sophistication of new
aircraft appear to have increased sharply over the last 10 years, when
substantial funding was made available for "deep black" projects.

     Vehicles now flying from these well-guarded sites include both manned
and unmanned hypersonic-capable aircraft designed to perform strategic
reconnaissance and other, less conventionally defined missions. The
classified fleet also comprises a number of large-winged concept
demonstrators that evolved into the Air Force's B-2 bomber and the Navy's
A-12 next-generation attack aircraft. Several vehicles, though, appear to
incorporate technologies that outstrip those now employed by engineers
charged with developing more traditional, current-generation aircraft.

     A number of these aircraft have been seen and heard repeatedly by
ground-based and airborne observers in the western U.S. over the last few
years. Based on about 45 reports provided by people who have seen, heard or
had access to the advanced aircraft, there now appear to be at least two -
but probably more - distinct types of vehicles!

     * A triangular-shaped, *quiet* aircraft seen with a flight of Lockheed
F-117A stealth fighters several times since the summer of 1989. This may be a
demonstrator or prototype of the General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas A-12.
Navy officials recently noted that full-size test models will soon be
"exposed to public view" during testing, suggesting that predecessors of the
A-12 are already flying.

     * A high-speed aircraft characterized by a very loud, deep, rumbling
roar reminiscent of heavy-lift rockets. When observed at medium altitude,
this aircraft type often makes a pulsing sound and leaves a thick, segmented
smoke trail or contrail. Lighting patterns indicate the aircraft is on the
order of 100+ ft. long, but no reliable description of a planform has been
reported to Aviation Week & Space Technology.

     * A high-altitude aircraft that crosses the night sky at extremely high
speed. Normally, *no engine noise or sonic boom is heard*. The vehicle
typically is observed as a single, *bright light* - sometimes pulsating -
flying at speeds far exceeding other aircraft in the area, and at altitudes
estimated to be above 50,000 ft. Such aircraft have been reported by both
ground-based and airborne observers. This may be the same vehicle as the one
characterized by a loud, pulsing noise when flying at lower altitude and
slower speed...

     ...These primary types of "black" aircraft appear to employ relatively
conventional propulsion systems, although more advanced than those available
to the "white" world. In addition, there is substantial evidence that another
family of craft exists that relies on *exotic propulsion and aerodynamic
schemes not fully understood at this time*. Data pertaining to this type of
vehicle are being studied by Aviation Week and several consultants.
