    BENJAMIN CREME - Contactee, England 
     
    Born in Scotland,  but living in London since 1946,  Benjamin Creme has 
    experienced  one  of the most ususual and electrifying lives of  modern 
    times.   His  claims  of contact with extraterrestrials  and  spiritual 
    beings go back as far as 1959. 
     
    Creme says he is the channel through which important spiritual messages 
    are  relayed  to earth.  Over the years,  much of his effort  has  been 
    directed at broadcasting these lessons to the world by many means. 
     
    Benjamin  has  written  several books,  which he  claims  are  messages 
    delivered through him.  Included among them are,  "The Reappearance  of 
    the  Christ  and  The  Masters of  Wisdom,   Maitreya's  Mission"   and 
    "Transmission  -  A meditation for the New Age".  He has  also  written 
    articles and essays for magazines and newspapers. 
     
    Creme  claims  many sightings and contacts over a period of  years  and 
    continuing  into  the present time.  He believes the alien visitors  to 
    earth are on a spiritual mission. "They mean us no harm" he says. "They 
    are not here to destroy us". 
     
    For Benjamin Creme, the spiritual importance of UFOs and ET contacts is 
    to  be  valued  beyond other considerations.  For  his  part,   he  has 
    established  contact  and communication with spiritual Masters  working 
    here on earth. 
     
    Benjamin's messages go beyond those proffered by most other contactees. 
    Predominantly spiritual in content,  his writings and lectures  involve 
    such subjects as the Life of Jesus and his travels to South America and 
    the Pacific,  the works of 63  Masters here on earth,  his contact with 
    Masters  and  the value of realising that Christ is a principle and  we 
    are all Sons of God. 
     
    Creme  has  also done some research into UFOs and ET contacts.  He  met 
    with George Adamski in 1959 and has no doubts about the man's veracity. 
    He believes that Edward "Billy"  Meier is a legitimate contact case. In 
    addition, Ben believes many present world leaders have had contact with 
    extraterrestrials,   including  Gorbachev.   Creme  speaks  with  great 
    conviction  when  he  describes his contacts and  how  Maitreya  speaks 
    through him. "No matter what you call him," he says, "there is only one 
    God." 
     
    Benjamin  Creme  says  there will be a Day  of  Declaration  when  Lord 
    Maitreya  and the Masters will announce their being and their missions. 
    "When  that happens,"  he says,  "All the networks and news media  will 
    combine for that purpose." 
     
    "Someday,"   he says,  "we on earth will be where the space people  are 
    today."
