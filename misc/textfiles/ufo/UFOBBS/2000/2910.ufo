I'm going to quote an ex-CIA official because I would like very much
to see what people on the net think of his views.

This is by Victor Marchetti, former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director
and Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the CIA. It appeared
as *How the CIA views the UFO Phenomenon,* in SECOND LOOK, Vol.1. No.7,
Washington DC, May 1979, pp. 2-7.

He says ....*we have, indeed, been contacted...by extraterrestrial beings,
and the U.S. government, in collusion with the other national powers of the
earth, is determined to keep this information from the general public.
The purpose of the international conspiracy is to maintain a workable stability
among the nations of the world and for them, in turn, to retain institutional
control over their respective populations. Thus, for these governments to
admit that there are beings from outer space...with mentalities and
technological
capabilities obviously far superior to ours, could, once fully perceived
by the average person, erode the foundations of the earth's traditional
power structure. Political and legal systems, religions, economic and
social institutions could all soon become meaningless in the mind of the
public. The national oligarchical establishments, even civilization as we
now know it, could collapse into anarchy. Such extreme conclusions are not
necessaril7y valid, but they probably accurately reflect the fears of the
*ruling classes* of the major nations, whose leaders (particularly those
in the intelligence business) have always advocated excessive governmental
secrecy as being necessary to preserve *national security.**

That's the quote.

So there it all is, the worst fears, even down to the collapse of civilization
as we know it.  What I'm wondering is, what do people think about this now?
WOULD the mass of people go completely ape if it was established that UFOs
and Visitors are real?  I can't quite make up my mind.  Let's have some
discussion on this and see what peoples's views are.

Regards, Lou Crago
