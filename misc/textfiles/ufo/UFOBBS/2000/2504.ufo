    Joseph and All readers....

      This  is  not a message from the Phoenix Project,  proper but I  will 
    state that at  this  time they still back the report that I transmitted 
    as truth. 

      I, however, cannot verify any of the information posted regarding the 
    alleged F-4's that were reportedly scrambled. All I know is what I have 
    been told and I have spoken with the investigator. He still claims that 
    what he heard [and possibly saw ...  I  am not sure here] was the sound 
    of  the  very familiar F-4.  Speaking with others in the Air Force  has 
    indicated to me that these craft have a very definite sound signature. 

      And I  also don't doubt the information supplied regarding  your talk 
    with officials at Beal. What he said is true.  However the report never 
    repeat  never stated that the planes in question came out of Beal.  Nor 
    did it claim whose planes they were.  Personally,  I  would think a F-4 
    equipped with nose cameras would be the ideal craft to be used if there 
    might have been a chance to get pictures. But my thinking would be that 
    these  planes  might be more interested in where the unknowns went  and 
    not  what  they  were.  I  am sure they [the elite  forces  behind  the 
    mystery] have sufficient pictures of alien craft already. 

      If the Phoenix Project has anything to say on this topic you can rest 
    assured that I will transmit it.
