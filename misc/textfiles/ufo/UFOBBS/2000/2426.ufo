Every summer contactees - people who believe they have communicated with god-
like space people - flock to the Rocky Mountain Conference on UFO 
Investigation, held on the University of Wyoming campus in Laramie. All these 
people have remarkable stories to tell: stories of personal transformation 
that sound like classic religious experiences in Space Age guise.

One of the stories is told by Merry Lynn Noble, by her own admission once "one 
of the leading call girls in the western United States." She was also an 
alcohol and drug addict seeking to change her life through spiritual studies. 
In February 1982, exhausted and depressed, she visited her parents in Montana. 
One evening, as they were driving in the country, a flying saucer appeared, 
bathing the car in light.

Noble's parents, who "were just frozen there," seemed unaware of the UFO's 
presence. Meanwhile, Merry Lynn in her astral body was being drawn into the 
craft, where she felt "absolute ecstasy, total peace, womblike warmth.  .  .  
. 'I'm so glad to leave that body,' I thought." She communicated 
telepathically with a "presence" who gave here a "new soul, with new energy, 
new humility." The next thing she knew, she was jolted back into her physical 
body.

From that moment her life began to change for the better. She found a good job 
and joined Alcoholics Anonymous, where she met the man whom she would marry. 
Her psychic contact with the extraterrestrial she has  written an unpublished 
autobiography, Sex, God and UFOs.
