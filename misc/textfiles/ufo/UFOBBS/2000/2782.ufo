      I  attended  a  lecture at the Holiday Inn in  Collinsville,   IL  on 
    12/20/91 given by Bill Knell, a UFO investigator, that was to deal with 
    "The UFO Coverup".   Having never met Mr.  Knell before, I  didn't know 
    exactly what to expect.   I must admit though, after hearing him on the 
    radio prior to the meeting, I was braced for "the big announcement." 

      His presentation was very good.   I  personally have not been exposed 
    to most of mr. knell's material.   He was well received by the sixty or 
    so people in attendance.   But, unfortunately,  the big announcement is 
    still somewhere out there in the future.

      The  following press release announced a special episode of "Unsolved 
    Mysteries"  that was due to air last month.   Even though the regularly 
    scheduled  program  (Wednesday,  12/25/91)  included a segment  on  the 
    Bentwaters  Air Base incident,  the special government episode has  not 
    been aired to date. 

      The Bentwaters story, although a repeat,  did include some additional 
    details that hadn't been presented originally. 

      "Unsolved  Mysteries"  must be commended for presenting cases from  a 
    balanced  and objective position.   The Belgium story done in  November 
    was done in a far from even neutral manner;  instead,  it was done in a 
    very positive and professional way with striking special effects.   The 
    high  profile  of the show,  together with the regularity in which  UFO 
    subjects are presented,  will help the masses cope should the "big one" 
    ever come along.

    SUBJECT: A SURPRISE U.S. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING THE
             REALITY OF THE U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Objects)
             PHENOMENON

             and

             AN UNEXPLAINED U.F.O. - MILITARY ENCOUNTER ON EARLY
             WEDNESDAY, 12/11/91 IN THE MIDEAST, MIDATLANTIC AREAS

    DATE: 12/12/91

    FROM:    BILL KNELL, U.F.O.  Investigator/Researcher speaking on behalf 
             of ISLAND SKYWATCH, 164-22 77TH ROAD, FLUSHING, NEW YORK 11365 
             718-591-1854.  (A NY-based,  non-profit organization dedicated 
             to   the   scientific  and  objective  study  of  the   U.F.O. 
             Phenonenon) 

   The  United  States  government plans to make  a  surprise  announcement 
   revealing  that U.F.O.s are real,  intelligently-controlled aircraft  of 
   unknown  origin sometime within the next two weeks.   This  announcement 
   will  coincide  with a special,  unscheduled episode of the nbc  network 
   television program "unsolved mysteries'  on sunday,  december 22,  1991.  
   Neither  the content,  nor the format of this announcement is  known  at 
   this time. 

   This  exclusive information was revealed to veteran U.F.O.  investigator 
   Bill Knell during the past 48 hours by two reliable sources.   The first 
   is  Dr.  Robert Carr,  a  professor at the university of South  Florida, 
   State of Florida, U.S.A. and the second is a person who works for TRW, a 
   company  which has examined captured or crashed UFOs for the  government 
   at trw facilities according  to  this  source and one former employee of 
   that company.  Both sources say they have participated in the filming of 
   the  special "unsolved mysteries"  episode and have been told by  unamed 
   government  contacts that the forthcoming announcement  concerning  UFOs 
   will  be  made  on the same date as the airing of the tv  episode.   The 
   person,   agency  or  format of the announcement and  concerning  it  is 
   unknown at this time.
