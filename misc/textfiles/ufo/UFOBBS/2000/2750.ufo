    Operation Right to Know 

    WHO ARE WE? 
     
    Operation:   Right  to  Know  is a group  of  citizens  united  by  the 
    conviction  that the solution to the UFO "mystery"  lies  in  political 
    action.   Private  groups  have done a heroic job for  over  40   years 
    documenting  UFO  sightings and trying to educate the public with  very 
    limited  resources.  Despite their decades of hard work,  however,  the 
    publicis still largely in the dark. 
     
    One  enormous barrier stands in the way of full public disclosure:  The 
    U.S. government's 40-year policy of withholding and confusing the facts 
    of extraterrestrial contact.  As long as this policy remains unchanged, 
    the  truth will never be fully revealed.  We demand full disclosure  of 
    government UFO secrets and an open, public inquiry into the phenomenon. 
    We charge that the government's policy of tightly restricting UFO data, 
    however well-intentioned it originally may have been,  causes far  more 
    harm than simply telling the truth. 
     
    Operation:   Right to Know held its first demonstration on March 28  in 
    front of the White House,  the first public protest against UFO secrecy 
    on record.  We will conduct a much larger "March on Washington"  onJuly 
    5, 1993, following the MUFON symposium in nearby Richmond, Virginia. 
     
    Throughout  the year,  we will hold smaller demonstrations at major UFO 
    hotspots and secret government research sites, and keep the pressure on 
    lawmakers   through  letter  campaigns,   educational  materials,   and 
    lobbying.   Grassroots sentiment to compel the government to reveal its 
    secret  UFO files has been growing recently.  Most citizens involved in 
    the  UFO field are political novices,  but a growing network is gaining 
    an  education  in political action.  Our hope is that a highly  visible 
    political campaign against UFO secrecy may enlist support from quarters 
    that have previously beem silent on the issue.  Popular  demonstrations 
    may  also indicate to U.S.  policymakers that the people are ready  for 
    the extraordinary news that has been withheld from them. 
     
    We  intend to spark demonstrations in many locales,  organized at first 
    by  UFO  enthusiasts,  but eventually involving all citizens  concerned 
    about freedom of inquiry and our planet's future.  Operation:  Right to 
    Know will provide networking and support for these activities. 
     
    A  bulletin,   The Right to Know Forum,  describing our  activities  is 
    available  now,  and will soon develop into a regular  newsletter  with 
    exciting news from around the country.  For free copies of past  issues 
    of  The  Right to Know Forum,  and further information on how  you  can 
    participate in Operation: Right to Know, write to:
