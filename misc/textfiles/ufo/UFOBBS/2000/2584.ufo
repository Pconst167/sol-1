                            GUARDIAN ANGEL OR E.T.             1 of 2
                                BY TOM BRIGGS
        What is a Guardian Angel? Ever since we were
    childern our parents always mentioned the Guardian Angel,
    especially before we went to bed. The connection between
    Guardian Angels and Extraterrstrials is possible.I
    believe, rather then it be possible.
        St. Augustine once declared that every visible
    thing in this world is put under the charge of an Angel. Lets
    say that during the evolution of man something{a more intelligent
    life form, a higher race, an extraterrestrial},stepped in
    and altered the genetic structure. Would you consider them our creartors?
     The caretakers of the Earth? I'm talking about a race thousands of years         
    more advanced then us, able to slip into other dimensions. The ability
    to become invisible. The ability of teleknetic powers.A race that
    can control our destiny. It seems that things Angels can do E.T.'s                                                                                
    can also do. Another name used to describe Angels or E.T.'s is
    the Watchers.                                                         
        According to the book of Jubilees the Watchers are the
    sons of GOD.I guess it depends on what you believe who or what God is.
     I will stick with the higher race theory. When a couple has a child,                                                   
    something they've created,they tend to protect and raise this creation.
     They watch it grow. They discipline it and watch it mature.

     Well, I think this is basically the same thing our creators do.                    
         Without comitting myself in a religious sense, I could conceive
    of the possibility of beings existing in dimensions and worlds other   
    then our own. That is based upon a quote from ST.PAUL.
     In this context Angle are not to be ruled out as part of reality.
     The evil Watchers dwell in the 3rd heaven. I beleave the 3rd heaven
    is either a dimensions or plane. The Watchers are also known as GRIGORI.                                                                      
      Hell is not the underworld as people think. It is in the northern                                                                      
    regions of the 3rd heaven.
     Some of the Watcher's names and occupations are interesting.                                                                                                                   
     {AQAIEL} taught men the signs of the Earth. {BARAQIEL} taught men 
    Astrolgy. {EZEQUEEL} taught men the knowledge of clouds.
