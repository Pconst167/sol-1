    The Origin, Identity, and Purpose of MJ-12

               By Milton William Cooper

                      May 23, 1989


    During  the  years following World War II the
Government of  the United  States was confronted with a
series of events which  were to  change beyond prediction
its future and with it the future of humanity.   These
events  were so incredible  that  they  defied belief.
A  stunned  President  Truman  and  his  top  military
Commanders  found themselves virtually impotent after
having just won the most devastating and costly war in
history. The  United  States  had developed,  used, and
was the only nation on earth in possession  of the Atomic
Bomb which alone had the  potential  to destroy any enemy,
and even the Earth itself.   At that time the United
States had the best economy, the most advanced technology,
the highest standard of living, exerted the most influ-
ence, and  fielded the largest and most powerful military
forces in history.  

    We  can only imagine the confusion and concern when
the  informed  elite  of  the United States Government
discovered that an  alien spacecraft piloted  by insect
like  beings  from   a   totally  incomprehensible culture
had crashed in the desert of New Mexico.


    Between  January  1947 and December 1952 at least 16
crashed  or downed  alien  craft,  65  alien bodies,  and
1 live  alien  were recovered.  An  additional alien craft
had exploded and  nothing was  recovered  from  that
incident.   Of  these  incidents,  13   occurred  within
the borders of the United States  not including  the craft
which disintegrated in the air.   Of these 13, 1 was in
Arizona,  11  were  in New Mexico,  and 1 was in  Nevada.
Three occured in foreign countries.   Of those 1 was in
Norway, and the last 2 were in Mexico.   Sightings of
UFO's were so numerous that   serious  investigation  and
debunking  of  each  report   became  impossible utilizing
the existing intelligence assets.


    An  alien  craft was found on February 13,  1948 on a
mesa near  Aztec,  New Mexico.   Another craft was located
on March 25, 1948 in Hart Canyon  near Aztec,  New Mexico.
It was 100  feet  in diameter.  A total of 17 alien bodies
were recovered from  those two  craft.   Of even greater
significance was the discovery of a large  number  of
human body parts stored within  both of  these  vehicles.
A demon had reared its ugly head and paranoia quickly took
hold  of  everyone  then 'in the  know'.   The  secret
lid  immediately  became an Above Top Secret lid and was
screwed  down tight. The security blanket was even tighter
than that  imposed  upon  the  Manhattan Project.   In the
coming years these  events were to become the most closely
guarded secrets in the history of  the world.


    A  special group of America's top scientists were
organized  and  the   name  Project  Sign  in  December
of  1947  to  study  the    phenomenon.   The  whole nasty
business was contained within    the shroud   of secrecy. 
Project Sign evolved into Project Grudge  in      December
of  1948.   A low level collection  and  disinformation
project named Blue Book was formed under Grudge. 16 vol-
umes were to  come  out of Grudge including the contro-
versial  "Grudge  13"    which I and Bill English saw,
read,  and revealed to the public.   "Blue  Teams" were
put together to recover the crashed disks  and     dead
or alive aliens.   The Blue Teams were later to evolve
into     Alpha Teams under Project Pounce.


    During these early years the United States Air Force
and the  CIA   exercised  complete control over the Alien
Secret.   In fact  the   CIA  was  formed  by Presidential
Executive Order  first  as  the     Central  Intelligence
Group for the express purpose  of  dealing     with  the
alien presence.   Later the National Security Act (NSA)
was  established to  oversee  the  intelligence  community 
and         especially  the  alien endeavor.   A series of
National  Security    Council memos and Executive Orders
removed the CIA from the  sole  task  of gathering foreign
intelligence and slowly but thoroughly 'legalized'  direct
action in the form of covert  activities  at     home and
abroad.


    On December 9,  1947, Truman approved issuance of
NSC-4, entitled    "Coordination  of Foreign Intelligence
Information  Measures"  at      the urging of Secretaries
Marshall, Forrestal, Patterson, and the  director of the
State Department's Policy Planning Staff, Kennan.


    The Foreign and Military Intelligence,  Book 1,
"Final Report of the  Select  Committee  to  Study Gover-
nmental  operations  with respect to Intelligence
Activities."  United States Senate,  94th   Congress, 2nd
Session, Report No. 94-755, April 26, 1976, page 49
states:  "This  directive  enpowered  the secretary of
state  to coordinate  overseas information activities
designed  to  counter   communism.   A top secret annex to
NSC-4,  NSC-4A, instructed the   director    of   Central
Intelligence   to   undertake covert        psychological
activities in pursuit of the aims set forth in NSC-4.  The
initial authority given the CIA for  covert  operations
under  NSC-4A  did  not establish formal  procedures  for
either coordinating  or approving these operations.   It
simply directed     the DCI to "undertake covert actions
and ensure,  through liaison  with  State  and  Defense,
that the  resulting  operations  were     consistent with
American policy."


    Later  NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 were to supersede NSC-4
and  NSC-4A         and  expand  the covert abilities even
further.   The  Office  of   Policy  Coordination (OPC)
was chartered to carry out an expanded         program  of
covert activities.   NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2  validated
illegal  and  extra-legal  practices  and  procedures  as
being   agreeable to the national security leadership.
The reaction was  swift.   In the eyes of the intelligence
community "no holes were barred".   Under  NSC-10/1 an
Executive Coordination  Group,  was established to review,
but not approve, covert project proposals.   The  ECG  was
secretly tasked to coordinate the alien projects. NSC-10/1
and NSC-10/2 were interpreted to mean that no one at the
top  wanted  to  know  about  anything  until it was  over
and   successful.   These  actions  established  a buffer
between  the President and the information. It was inten-
ded that this buffer  serve  as  a means for the President
to deny knowledge  if  leaks    divulged the true state of
affairs.
    This buffer was used in later   years   for  the
purpose  of  effectively isolating succeeding   Presidents
from the knowledge of the alien presence other than what
the Secret Government and the intelligence community
wanted    them  to  know.   NSC-10/2 established a study
panel  which  met secretly  and  was made up of scientific
minds of the  day.   The study  panel was NOT called
MJ-12.   Another NSC  memo,  NSC-10/5 further outlined the
duties of the study panel.   These NSC memos   and secret
Executive Orders set the stage for the creation of MJ-12
only 4 years later.


     Secretary  of  defense  James Forrestal began to
object  to  the secrecy.  He was a very idealistic and
religious man who believed that the public should be told.
When he began to talk to leaders   of the opposition party
and leaders of congress about the  alien problem he was
asked to resign by Truman.  He expressed his fears to
many  people  and   rightfully believed  that  he  was
being watched. This was interpreted by those who were
ignorant of the facts  as paranoia. Forrestal later was
said to have suffered a mental breakdown and was admitted
to Bethesda Naval Hospital.  In fact  it was feared that
Forrestal would begin to talk again  and   he  had to be
isolated and discredited. Sometime in  the  early morning
of May 22, 1949 agents of the CIA tied a sheet around his
neck,  fastened  the other end to a fixture in his room
and threw James Forrestal out the window.   The sheet tore
and he plummeted to his death.  He became one of the first
victoms of the cover-up.


     The  live  alien that had been taken from the 1949
Roswell  crash was named EBE.  The name had been suggested
by Dr. Vannever Bush and was short for Extraterrestrial
Biological Entity. EBE had a tendency  to lie and for over
a year would give only the  desired answer  to questions
asked.   Those questions which  would  have resulted in an
undesirable answer went unanswered.  At some point during
the second year of captivity he began to open up and  the
information  derived from EBE was startling,  to say  the  
least.  This compilation of his revelations became the 
foundation of what would later be called the "Yellow 
Book". Photographs were taken of EBE which, among others,  
I and  Bill English were to view years later in GRUDGE 13.
    In late 1951 EBE became ill. Medical personnel had 
been  unable to  determine the cause of EBE's illness and 
had  no  background from  which  to draw.  EBE's system 
was chlorophyll based and  he processed food  into  energy 
much the same  as  plants.   Waste   material was excreted
the same as plants.  It was decided that an expert  on 
botany was called for. A botanist, Dr. Guillermo  Mendoza, 
was brought in to try and help him recover.  Dr. Mendoza
worked  to save EBE until mid-1952 when EBE  died.   Dr.  
Mendoza became an expert on alien biology.


    In  a  futile attempt to save EBE and to gain  favor  
with  this technologically  superior  alien  race the
United  States  began  broadcasting  a call for help early 
in 1952 into the vast regions of space. The call went
unanswered but the project continued as an effort of good 
faith.



    President  Truman  created  the super secret  National
Security Agency  by  secret Executive Order  on  November
4,1952.   Its primary  purpose  was  to decipher the alien
communications  and language  and establish a dialogue
with the  aliens. This  most urgent task was a continua-
tion of the earlier effort and was code  named SIGMA.  The
secondary purpose of the NSA was to monitor all communi-
cations  and emissions from any and all devices  worldwide
for the purpose of gathering intelligence,  both human and
alien,  and to contain the secret of the alien presence.
Project  SIGMA was  successful. The NSA also     maintains
communications with the Luna  base and other Secret Space
Programs.   By Executive  Order the  NSA is exempt from
all laws which do not specifically  name the  NSA  in  the
text of the law as being subject to  that  law. That means
that if the agency is not spelled  out in the text of  any
and every law passed by the Congress it is not subject to
that or those laws. The NSA now performs many other duties
and in fact is the premiere agency whithin the intellig-
ence community.  Today  NSA  receives  75%  of the moneys
allotted  to the  intelligence community. The  old  saying
"where the money goes  therein  the power resides" is
true.  The DCI today is a figurehead maintained as a
public ruse. The primary task of the NSA is still  alien
communications but now includes other Alien projects as
well.


     President Truman had been keeping our allies, includ-
ing the Soviet     Union, informed of the developing alien
problem since the Roswell recovery.  This had been done
in case the aliens turned out to be a threat to the human
race.   Plans were formulated to defend the  Earth in case
of invasion.   Great difficulty was encountered  in maint-
aining  international secrecy.  It  was  decided  that  an
outside group   was   necessary  to  coordinate   and
control  international efforts in order to hide the secret
from the normal scrutiny  of  governments  by the press.
The  result  was  the formation of a secret society known
as the "Bilderburgers".  The headquarters  of  this  group
is  in  Geneva, Switzerland.   The Bilderburgers  evolved
into a secret world government  that  now controls every-
thing. The United Nations was then, and is now, an
inter-national joke.


     In 1953 a new man occupied the White House.  He was a
man used to a structured  staff organization with a chain
of  command. His method was to delegate authority and rule
by committee.   He made major decisions but only when his
advisors were unable to come to consensus.   His  normal
method was to read through or listen  to several alterna-
tives  and then approve one.   Those  who  worked closely
with him have stated that his favorite comment was, "just
do  whatever  it  takes".   He spent a lot of time  on the
golf course.   This was not all unusual for a man who had
been  career Army with the ultimate position of Supreme
Allied Commander during the war.   A  post  which carried
5 star along  with  it. This president was General of the
Army Dwight David Eisenhower.


     During  his first year in office,  1953,  at least 10
more  alien crashed disks  were  recovered  along with 26
dead  and  4  live aliens.  Of the 10, 4 were found in
Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New   Mexico,  1  in Louisiana,
1 in Montana, and 1 in  South  Africa. There were hundreds
of sightings.


    Eisenhower  knew  that  he  had to wrestle  and  beat
the  alien problem.  He knew that he could not do it be
revealing the secret to  the Congress.   Early in 1953 the
new president turned to his  friend  and  fellow member of
the Council on  Foreign  relations, Nelson Rockefeller for
help with the alien  problem. Eisenhower and Rockefeller
began planning the secret structure of alien task supervi-
sion which was to become a reality within one year.  The
idea  for  MJ-12 was thus born. It was Nelson's Uncle
Winthrop Aldrich       who had been crucial in convincing
Eisenhower to run  for President. The  whole Rockefeller
family and with  them  the Rockefeller  empire had solidly
backed Ike.   Asking  Rockefeller for  help  with the
alien problem was to be the  biggest  mistake Eisenhower
ever made for the future of the United States and most
probably all of humanity.


    Withen  1 week of Eisenhower's election he had    app-
ointed Nelson    Rockefeller  chairman  of  a Presidential
Advisory Committee on Government Organization. Rockefeller
was  responsible   for   planning the reorganization of
the government.  New Deal programs   went  into  1 single
cabinet position called  the  Department  of Health,
Education,   and Welfare.  When the Congress approved the
new cabinet position in April of 1953,  Nelson was named
to the post of Undersecretary to Oveta Culp Hobby.


    In  1953 astronomers discovered large objects in space
which were moving  towards  Earth. It was first believed
that  they  were asteroids. Later evidence proved that the
objects could only be spaceships. Project Sigma intercep-
ted alien radio communication.  When the objects reached
the Earth they took up a very high orbit    around  the
equator.   There were several huge ships,  and  their
actual  intent was unknown.   Project Sigma,  and a new
project, Plato,  through  radio  communications using the
computer  binary language,  was able to arrange a landing
that resulted in face to face contact  with alien beings
from  another  planet. Project  Plato was tasked with
establishing diplomatic relations with this  alien race of
space aliens.


     In the meantime a race of human-looking aliens
contacted the U.S. Government.   this  alien group warned 
us against the aliens that   were  orbiting  the  Equator
and offered to  help  us  with  our spiritual development. 
They  demanded that  we  dismantle  and destroy our
nuclear weapons as the major condition. They refused    to
exchange technology citing that we were spiritually unable
to handle  the technology which we then  possessed.   They
believed   that we would use any new technology to destroy
each other.  This    race  stated  that we were on a path
of self-destruction  and  we must  stop  killing each
other,  stop polluting the  earth,  stop raping  the
Earth's  natural resources,  and learn  to  live  in
harmony.   These terms were met with extreme suspicion
especially the major condition of nuclear disarmament.  It
was believed that meeting that condition would leave us
helpless in the face of  an obvious  alien  threat.   We
also had nothing in history to  help   with the decision.
Nuclear disarmament was not considered to be within  the
best interest of the United States.   The  overtures
were rejected.


     Later in 1954 the race of large nosed gray aliens
which had  been orbiting  the Earth landed at Holloman Air
Force base.   A  basic  agreement  was  reached.   This
race  identified themselves  as originating  from a planet
around a red star in the Constellation   of Orion which we
call Betelgeuse.  They stated that their planet was  dying
and that at some unknown future time they would'nt be able
to survive there.  This led to a second landing at Edwards
Air Force base.  The historical event had been planned in
advance   and  details  of  the  treaty  had  been  agreed
upon. Eisenhower  arranged to be in Palm Springs on vaca-
tion.   On  the appointed day the President was spirited
away to the base and the excuse was given to the press
that he was visiting a dentist.


     President  Eisenhower  met with the aliens and  a
formal  treaty between  the  Alien Nation and the United 
States of  America  was signed.   We  then received our
first Alien Ambassador from outer    space.   His name and 
title was his "Omnipotent Highness  Krlll", pronounced 
Krill. In the American tradition of disdain for royal
titles,  he  was secretly called "Original Hostage
Krlll".   You should  know  that  the alien flag is known  
as  the  "Trilateral Insignia". It is  displayed on their 
craft and worn  on  their uniforms.   Both  of  these 
landings and the second meeting  were   filmed.  The films 
exist today.


    The Treaty stated:  The aliens would not interfere in
our affairs and  we  would  not interfere in theirs.   We  
would  keep  their presence on earth a secret.  They would
furnish us with advanced  technology  and would help us in
our  technological development. They would not make any
treaty with any other earth nation.  They   could  abduct
humans  on a limited and periodic  basis  for  the purpose
of medical examination and monitoring of our development
with the stipulation that the humans would not be  harmed,
would be  returned to their point of abduction,  that the
humans  would have  no  memory of the event,  and that the
alien  nation would furnish  MJ-12  a list of all human
contacts and abductees on a  regularly  scheduled basis.
It was agreed that  each  nation  would  recieve  the
Ambassador of the other for as  long  as  the       treaty
remained in force.   It was further agreed that the Alien
Nation and the United States would exchange 16 personnel 
each  to the other with the purpose of learning, each of
the other.


    The  Alien "Guests" would remain on earth and the
"human  guests" would  travel to the Alien point of origin
for a specified period of time then return,  at which
point a reverse exchange would  be  made.   It  was  also
agreed  that bases  would  be constructed underground  for
the use of the Alien nation and  that  2  bases would  be
constructed for the joint use the the Alien nation  and
     the United States Government. Exchange of technology
would take place in the jointly occupied bases.   These
alien bases would be constructed under Indian reservations
in the 4 corners area  of  Utah,   New  Mexico,  Arizona,
and Colorado,  and  1  would  be  constructed   in  Nevada
in  the  area  known  as  S-4   located approximately  7
miles south of the western border of  area  51 known as
Dreamland.   All alien bases are under complete control of
the  Naval  Department  and all personel who  work  in
these complexes  receive their checks from the Navy. Con-
struction  of the  bases  began immediately but progress 
was slow until  large amounts of money were made available 
in 1957.   Work continued on  the "Yellow Book".

     
    Project  REDLIGHT was formed and experimentation in
test  flying alien aircraft was begun in earnest. A super
TOP SECRET facility was  built  at Groom Lake in Nevada in
the midst of  the  weapons test range.   It was code named
DREAMLAND. The installation was placed under the Depart-
ment of the Navy and clearance  of  all personnel required  
"Q"  clearance  as  well  as   Executive (Presidential)
approval.  This is ironic due to the fact that the Pre-
sident  of the United States does not have clearance to
visit the site. The  alien base and exchange of technology
actually took place in an Area known as S-4.  Area S-4 was
code named "The Dark Side of the Moon".


     The  Army was  tasked to form a super secret organi-
zation  to   furnish   security   for  all  alien   tasked
projects.    This organization  became  the National  
Reconnaissance Organization based at Fort Carson,Colorado.
The specific teams trained to    secure the projects were
called DELTA.


     A second project code named SNOWBIRD was promulgated
to explain away  any  sightings  of the REDLIGHT crafts as
being  Air  Force experiments. The SNOWBIRD  crafts  were
manufactured   using conventional  technology and were
flown for the press on several occasions. Project SNOWBIRD
was also used to debunk legitimate   public  sightings of
alien craft (UFO's). Project SNOWBIRD was very successful
and reports from the  public  decline steadily until
recent years.


     A multi-million dollar SECRET fund was organized and
kept by the Military Office of the White House. This fund
was used to build over 75 deep    underground facilities.  
Presidents who asked  were told the fund was used to build
Deep Underground Shelters for the  President  in  case  of
war. Only a few  were  built  for  the President. Millions 
of dollars were funneled through this office to MJ-12  and
then out to the contractors and was used to  build TOP  
SECRET  alien  bases  as  well  as  TOP  SECRET DUMB (Deep 
nderground  Military Bases), and   facilities promulgated  
by "Alternative 2", throughout the nation.   President 
Johnson used this fund  to  build a movie theatre and pave 
the road on his ranch. He had no idea of its  purpose.

   
    The  secret White House Underground Construction fund
was set  up in 1957 by President Eisenhower.   The funding 
was obtained  from     Congress  under  the  guise of 
"construction and maintenance  of secret sites  where  the
President could be  taken  in  case  of military attack:   
Presidential Emergency Sites".   The sites are   literally 
holes in the ground, deep enough to withstand a nuclear
blast  and  are  outfitted with state of the art commun-
ications equipment.  To date there are more than seventy
five sites spread around  the country which were built 
using money from this  fund.  The Atomic Energy Commission 
has built at least an additional  22  underground sites.


    The  location and everything to do with these sites 
were and  are considered  and treated as TOP SECRET. The 
money was and is  in control of the Military Office of the 
White House, and was and is laundered through a circuitous
web that  even   the  most knowledgeable spy or accountant
can not follow.   As of 1980 only a  few  at the beginning
and end of this web knew what the  money was for.   At the
beginning were Representative George Mahon,  of Texas, and
the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and  of
its Defense Subcommittee: and Representative Robert Sikes,
of Florida,   chairman   of   the  House   Appropriations
Military Construction  Subcommittee. Today  it is  rumored 
that  House Speaker  Jim  Wright controls the money in
Congress  and  that a power struggle is underway to remove
him.  At the end of the line  were  the President,  MJ-12,
the director of the Military Office and a commander at the 
Washington Navy Yard.


     The  money  was authorized by the  Appropriation
Committee  who allocated it to the Department of Defense
as a TOP SECRET item in  the  army construction program.
The Army,  however,  could  not spend it and  in fact  did
not even  know  what  it  was  for. Authorization  to
spend the money was in reality  given to  the Navy.   The
money was channeled to the Chesapeake Division of the Navy
Engineers who did not know what it was for either.  Not
even the Commanding Officer,  who was an Admiral,  knew
what the fund was  to be used for.   Only one man,  a Navy
Commander,  who  was assigned to  the Chesapeake  Division
but  in   reality   was responsible  only to the Military
Office of the White House  knew  of  the actual purpose,
amount,  and ultimate destination of the TOP  SECRET fund.
The total secrecy surrounding the fund  meant that  almost
every trace of it could be made to disappear by  the  very
few people who controlled it.  There has never been and
most likely never will be an audit of this secret money.


    Large  amounts of money were transferred from the TOP
SECRET fund to  a location at Palm Beach,  Florida that
belongs to the Coast Guard called Peanut Island. The
island is adjacent to  property which  was onwed by Joseph
Kennedy.   The money was said to  have been used for
landscaping and general beautification.   Some time    ago
a  TV  news special on the Kennedy assassination told  of
a Coast  Guard  Officer  transferring money in a briefcase
to  a Kennedy employee across this property line.  Could 
this have been a  secret payment to the Kennedy family for 
the loss of their son   John F.  Kennedy?   The payments
continued through the year  1967 and  then stopped.   The
total amount transferred is unknown  and    the actual use 
of the money is unknown.


    Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller changed positions again.
This time he was to take C.D. Jackson's old position which
had been called the Special Assistant for Psychological 
Strategy. With Nelson's appointment  the  name was changed 
to the Special Assistant  for  Cold  War  Strategy.   This
position would evolve over the  years into  the same 
position Henry Kissinger was ultimately  to  hold   under  
President Nixon.   Officially he was to give "Advice  and
assistance  in     development of increased  understanding
and cooperation among all peoples". The official descrip-
tion was a smoke screen for security he was the Presiden-
ial Coordinator for the  Intelligence  Community. In  his  
new  post,  Rockefeller reported directly,  and only,  to 
the  President.   He  attended   meetings of the Cabinet,  
the Council on Foreign Economic Policy,  and  the National 
Security Council which was the highest  policy-making body
in the government.
     Nelson  Rockefeller was also given a second important
job as  the head  of  a secret unit called the Planning
Coordination  Group   which  was formed under NSC 5412/1
in March of 1955. The  group consisted of different ad hoc
members depending on the subject of the agenda. The basic
members were Rockefeller, a representative of the Dept. of
State,   and  the  Director  of Central Intelligence.   It
was soon called the "3412 Committee"  of  the "Special
Group".   NSC 5412/1 established the rule that  covert
operations  were subject to approval by an  executive
committee, whereas in the past these operations were
initiated solely on the authority of the Director of
Central Intelligence.                                       
    By secret Executive Memorandum, NSC 5410, Eisenhower
had preceded NSC  5412/1  in 1954 to establish a permanent
committee  (not  ad hoc)  to  be  known as Majority Twelve
(MJ-12)  to  oversee  and conduct all covert activities
concerned with the alien question. NSC  5412/1 was created
to explain the purpose of these  meetings when Congress
and the Press became curious. Majority Twelve was made  up
of Nelson Rockefeller,  the director of the  CIA  Allen
Welsh  Dulles, the Secretary of State John  Foster Dulles,
the Secretary of Defense Charles E.Wilson, the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs  of Staff Admiral Arthur W.  Radford, the
Director of the FBI J.  Edgar Hoover, and six men from the
executive committee of the Council on Foreign Relations
known as the "Wise Men".   These men were all members of a
secret society of scholars that  called   themselves  "The
Jason  Society",  or "The Jason Scholars"  who recruited
their  members  from the "Skull  and  Bones"  and  the
"Scroll and Key" societies of Harvard and Yale.
     The  "Wise Men"  were  key  members of the  Council
on  Foreign Relations.   There  were  12 members including
the first  6  from Government  positions thus Majority
Twelve.   This group was made up  over the  years of the
top officers  and  directors  of  the   Council on Foreign 
Relations and later the Trilateral Commission. Gordan
Dean,  George  Bush,  and Zbigniew Brzezinski were  among
them. The most important and influential of the "Wise Men"
who served  on  MJ-12  were  Jogn  McCloy, Robert  Lovett,
Averell Harriman, Charles Bohlen, George Kennan, and Dean
Acheson.  It is significant  that President Eisenhower as
well as the first 6 MJ-12 members from the Government were
also members of the Council on Foreign Relations.Thorough
researchers will soon discover that not all of the "Wise
Men" attended Harvard or Yale and not all of them were
chosen for "Skull  and  Bones" or "Scroll and Key" member-
ship  during  their college years. You will be able to
quickly clear up this mystery by obtaining the book "The
Wise Men" by Walter Issacson and  Even Thomas,  Simon and 
Schuster, New York. Under illustration #9 in the center of
the book you will find the caption "Lovett with the   Yale
Unit,  above far right, and on the beach his initiation
into Skull and Bones came at an air base near Dunkirk".  I 
have found that members were chosen on an ongoing basis by
invitation  based upon merit post college and was not
confined to only Harvard or Yale attendees.
     A  chosen few were later initiated into the Jason
Society.   They are  all members of the Council on Foreign
Relations and at  that  time were known as the "Eastern
Establishment".  This should give you  a clue to the far
reaching and serious nature of these  most secret  college
societies. The Jason Society is alive and  well today  but
now includes members of the Trilateral Commission as well.
The Trilateralists existed secretly several years BEFORE
1973. The name of the Trilateral Commission was taken from
the alien flag known as the "Trilateral Insignia".
    Majority  Twelve  was  to survive   right up to  the  
present  day. Under Eisenhower and Kennedy it was errone-
ously called the "8412  Committee" or more correctly, the 
"Special Group". in the Johnson administration  it  became
the "303 Committee" because  the  name 5412  had     been
compromised in the book "The  Secret  Government" actual-
ly NSC 5412/1 was leaked to the author to hide existence
of NSC 5410.  Under Nixon, Ford, and Carter it was called
the "40 Committee", and under Reagan, it became the "PI-40
Committee". Over all those years only the name changed.
     By 1955 it became obvious     the aliens had deceived
Eisenhower and  had broken the treaty. Mutilated humans
were  being  found along with mutilated animals all across
the United States. It was  suspected  that the aliens were
not submitting a complete list of   human  contacts and 
abductees to MJ-12 and it was suspected  that  not  all
abductees  had been returned.   The  Soviet  Union  was
suspected  of interacting with them and this proved to  be
true.  It   was  learned  that  the aliens  had  been  and
were then manipulating masses of  people  through   secret
societies, witchcraft,  magic,  the occult, and religion.
After several Air Force combat air engagements with alien
craft it  also  became apparent that our weapons were no
match against them.
     In  November 1955, NSC 5412/2 was issued establishing
a  study  committee  to  explore  "All factors which are
involved in making  and  implementing of foreign policy in
the nuclear  age." This was only a blanket of snow that
covered the real subject  of study, the alien question.
     By  secret  Executive Memorandum,  NSC 5411  in 1954,
President Eisenhower  had commissioned the study group to 
"examine all  the  facts,  evidence,  lies,  and deception
and discover the truth of the  alien question. NSC5412/2 
was only a cover that had become necessary when  the press 
began inquiring as to the purpose  of  regular meetings of 
such important men.  The first meetings began at  Quantico
Marine Base. The study group was made up of 35  members
of  the Council on Foreign Relations.   Secret scholars
known as "The Jason Society" of the "Jason Scholars".  Dr.
Edward Teller was invited to participate,  Dr.  Zbigniew
Brzezinski was the study director for the first 18 months.
Dr. Henry Kissinger   was  chosen  as  the  group's study
director for  the  second  18 months. Nelson Rockefeller
was a frequent visitor  during  the study.

The  second  phase meetings were also held at the Marine
Base  at Quantico  Virginia  and the group became known
as Quantico  II. Nelson  Rockefeller  built a retreat
somewhere in Maryland  which could only be reached by air
for MJ-12 and the study committee so that they  could meet
away from public  scrutiny. This  secret meeting place  is
known by the code name  "The  Country  Club".     Complete
living,   eating,   recreation,  library,  and  meeting
facilities exist at the location.
     The study group was "publicly" closed in the later
months of 1958  and  Henry  Kissinger  published what was
officially termed  the results in 1957 as "Nuclear Weapons
and Foreign Policy" by  Henry A.  Kissinger, published for 
the Council on Foreign Relations by Harper & Brothers, New 
York. In truth the manuscript had already been 80% written 
while Kissinger was at Harvard.  The study group continued 
veiled in secrecy.  A clue to the seriousness Kissinger
attached  to the study can be found in statements by his
wife and friends. Many of them stated that Henry would 
leave home  early each  morning  and return late each
night  without  speaking  to anyone  or responding  to
anyone.   It seemed as if he  were  in    another world 
which held no room for anyone else.
    These  statements  are very revealing.   The revela-
tions of  the    alien  presence  and actions during the
study must  have  been  a great  shock. Henry Kissinger
was definitely out of  character during  time surrounding
these meetings.  He would never again be affected in  this
manner no matter the seriousness of  any subsequent event.
On many occasions he would work very late into   the night
after having already put in a full day.   This behavior
eventually led to divorce.
     A major finding of the alien study was that the
public could  not be told as it was believed that this
would most certainly lead to economic  collapse,  collapse
of  the religious structure,  and  national  panic  which
would lead into  anarchy.   Secrecy  thus continued.   An
offshoot of this finding was that if the public could  not
be told then the Congress could  not  be  told,  thus
funding  for  the projects and research would have to  
come  from outside the government.  In the meantime money 
was to be obtained from   the  military  budget  and  from
CIA  confidential   non-appropriated funds.


    Another  major  finding  was  the aliens were  using
humans  and animals for a source of glandular secretions,  
enzymes,  hormonal secretions, blood  and  in horrible  
genetic  experiments.   The   aliens  explained these 
actions  as necessary to their survival. They  stated  
that their genetic structure had  deteriorated  and   that
they were no longer able to reproduce.   They stated that
if they  were unable to improve their genetic structure
their  race would  soon  cease to exist. We looked upon
their  explanations with extreme suspicion.  Since our
weapons were literally useless  against the aliens, MJ-12
decided to continue friendly diplomatic relations with
them until   such time      as we were able to develop a
technology which would enable us to challenge them on a
military bases.   Overtures would have to be made to the
Soviet Union, and   other nations,  to join forces for the
survival of humanity. In the  meantime  plans were
developed to research and  construct  2 weapons  systems
using conventional and nuclear technology which would
hopefully bring us to parity.
    The  results of the research were Projects JOSHUA and
EXCALIBUR. Joshua  was a weapon captured from the Germans 
which at that time was capable of shattering 4" thick
armor plate at a range of  two miles using low frequency 
sound waves,   and it was believed that this  weapon would 
be effective against the alien craft and  beam weapons.
Excalibur was a weapon carried by missile not to exceed
30,000 feet AGL,  not to deviate from designated target
more than 50 meters,  would penetrate 1,000 meters of tufa
hard packed soil such  as that found in New Mexico,  would
carry a  one  megaton  warhead,  and  was intended for use
in destroying the aliens  in  their  underground bases.
Joshua was developed successfully but   never  used  to my
knowledge. Excalibur was  not  pushed  until recent  years
and now there is an unprecedented effort to develop   this
weapon.
     The  events  at  Fatima in the early part  of  the
century  were scrutinized. On  suspicion that it was alien
manipulation,  an intelligence  operation  was put into
motion  to  penetrate  the secrecy surrounding the event.
The United States utilized  its  Vatican  moles  that had 
been recruited and nurtured during  WWII and soon obtained 
the entire Vatican study which  included  the prophecy.
This  prophecy stated that if man did not turn from   evil
and  place himself at the feet of Christ the planet  would
self-destruct and the events described in the book of
Revelations would indeed come to pass.   It stated that a
child would be born who would unite the world with a plan
for world peace and a false religion  beginning  in 1992.
By 1995 the people would  descern that he was evil and was
indeed the Anti-Christ.   World War  III would begin in
the Middle East in 1995 with an invasion of Israel  by  a
United Arab nation using conventional weapons which  would
lminate in a nuclear holocaust in the year 1999.   Between
1999 and 2003 most of the life on this planet would suffer
horribly and  die  as a result. The return of Christ would
occur in  the year 2011.
    When  the aliens were confronted with this finding 
they confirmed that it was true.   The aliens explained 
that they had created us through hybridization and had 
manipulated the human race  through  religion,  satanism,  
witchcraft,  magic, and the occult. They further explained 
that they were capable of time travel and  the events
would indeed come to pass.   Later exploitation of  alien
technology  by the United States and the Soviet Union
utilizing time travel confirmed the prophecy.  The aliens
showed a hologram which they claimed was the actual
crucifixion of  Christ, which the government filmed. We
did not know whether to believe them or not. Were they
using GENUINE religions to manipulate us?  or , were they
indeed the source of our religions with which they  had
been manipulating us all along? or, was this the beginning
of the genuine  END  TIMES  and  the RETURN OF  CHRIST
which  had  been predicted in the Bible? No one knew the
answer.
     A  symposium was held in 1957 which was attended by
some of  the  greatest  scientific  minds  then  living.
They reached   the conclusion  that  by or shortly after 
the year 2,000  the  planet WOULD  self destruct  due  to 
increased  population  and  man's  exploitation of the 
environment WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM GOD OR  THE ALIENS.
    By  secret  Executive Order of President  Eisenhower,
the  Jason Scholars   were   ordered  to  study  this  
scenario and make recommendations called "Alternatives 1,  
2, and 3".  "Alternative 1"  was to use nuclear devices to 
blast holes in the Stratosphere from which  the  heat and 
pollution  would  escape  into space. Change the human 
cultures from that of exploitation into cultures of envir-
onmental protection.  Of the three this was decided to be
the  least  likely to succeed due the inherent nature of
man  and the  additional  damage the nuclear explosions  
would  themselves create. "Alternative  2"  was  to  build
a vast network of underground  cities and tunnels in which
a select representation  of  all  cultures and occupations
would survive and carry on  the human  race.The  rest of
humanity would be left  to  fend  for themselves on the
surface of the planet. "Alternative 3" was to exploit  the
alien  and conventional technology in order  for a  select
few  to leave the earth and establish colonies  in  outer 
space. I am not able to confirm nor deny the existence
of  "Batch Consignments" of human slaves which would be 
used  for the  manual labor in the effort as part of the
plan.   The  Moon, code  named  "Adam",  would  be the
object  of  primary interest followed  by the planet Mars,
code named "Eve".   As a  delaying action, ALL   THREE
ALTERNATIVES  included   birth   control, sterilization,
and the introduction of deadly microbes to control or slow
the growth of the Earth's population.   AIDS is only  ONE
result of these plans.  There are others.   It was decided
since the population must be reduced and controlled that
it would be in the  best  interest  of the human race to
rid ourselves of  the undesirable elements of our society.
The joint U.S. & Soviet leadership dismissed "Alternative
1" but ordered work to begin on "Alternative 2 and 3"
virtually at the same time.
     In   1959   the  Rand  Corporation hosted  a  Deep
Underground Construction Symposium.   In the Symposium
report,  machines  are  pictured  and  described  which 
could  bore a tunnel 45 feet  in diameter at  the  rate of
5 feet per hour.   It  also  displays  pictures  of huge
tunnels and underground vaults containing  what appear  to 
be complex facilities and possibly even cities. It appears
that  the  previous  5 years  of  all  out  underground
construction had made significant progress by that time.   
    The ruling  powers decided that one means of funding
the alien connected  and  other  black market projects was
to  corner  the illegal drug market.   A young ambitious
member of the Council on Foreign Relations was approached.
His name is George Bush who at the  time was president and
C.E.O. of Zapata Oil based in Texas. Zapata Oil was exper-
imenting with the new technology of  offshore drilling.
It was  correctly  thought that the drugs could be shipped
from South America to the offshore platforms by  fishing
boat  where  it would  then be taken  to  shore  by  the
normal transportation  used for supplies and personnel.
By this method, no  customs    or law enforcement agency
would subject the cargo  to search. George Bush agreed to
help and organized the  operation in conjunction with the
CIA.   The plan worked better than anyone had thought  and
has since expanded worldwide and there are  now many other
methods of  bringing the  illegal  drugs into the country.
It  must always be remembered though that George  Bush
began  sale of drugs to our children. The CIA now controls
all the World's illegal drug markets.
     The "Official" space program was boosted by President 
Kennedy  in his inaugural address when he mandated that 
the United States put a  man  on  the  moon before the end
of  the decade. Although innocent in its conception this
mandate enabled those in  charge to  funnel vast amounts
of money into black projects and  conceal the  REAL  space
program from the  American  people. A  similar program  in
the Soviet Union served the same purpose.   In fact a
joint alien, United States, and Soviet Union base already
existed on the moon at the very moment Kennedy spoke the
words.   On  May 22, 1962 a space probe landed on Mars and
confirmed the existence  of  an environment which could
support life. Not long afterward  the construction of a
colony on the planet Mars began in earnest. Today  cities
exist on Mars populated by  specifically selected people
from  different cultures and occupations taken  from  all
over  the  Earth. A public charade of  antagonism  between
the Soviet Union and the United States has been maintained
over  all these  years  in order to fund projects in the 
name  of  National Defense when in fact we are the closest
allies.
     At  some point President Kennedy discovered portions 
of the truth concerning the drugs and the aliens.   He 
issued an ultimatum in 1963  to MJ-12.   President Kennedy
assured them that if they didn't clean up the drug problem
he would. He informed MJ-12  that he  intended  to  reveal
the presence of aliens to  the American people within the 
following year and ordered a plan developed  to implement  
his decision.   President Kennedy was not a member  of the 
Council on Foreign Relations     and know      nothing of
"Alternative 2"  or  "Alternative  3". Internationally the
operations  were supervised by  MJ-12  and  in the Soviet
Union  by  its  sister organization.   President Kennedy's
decision struck fear into the hearts of those in charge.
His assissination was ordered by the Policy Committee and
the order was carried out by agents of MJ-12 in Dallas.
    President John  F.  Kennedy was murdered by the Secret
Service Agent  who drove his car in the motorcade and the
act is  plainly visible  in the film.   WATCH THE DRIVER
AND NOT KENNEDY WHEN YOU VIEW THE FILM. ALL of the    wit-
nesses who were close enough to the  car  to  see  William
Greer shoot  Kennedy  were  themselves  all murdered
within  the next two years of the  event. The     Warren
Commission  was a farce and Council on Foreign Relations
members made up the majority of its panel.  They succeeded 
in snowing the American people.  Many other patriots who 
attempted to reveal the     alien  secret have also been 
murdered throughout the  intervening  years.
    During the era of the United States initial space
exploration and the Moon landings every launch was accom-
panied by alien craft.  A Moon  base dubbed  Luna  was 
sighted and filmed  by  the  Apollo   astronauts.  Domes, 
spires, tall round structures which look like silos,  huge
"T" shaped mining vehicles which  left  stitch-like tracks
in the lunar surface, and extremely large as well as small
alien craft  appear in the photographs.   It is a  joint
United States, Russian and Alien base. The Space Program
is a farce and unbelievable waste of money.  Alternative 3
is a reality and is  not at all science fiction.   Most of
the  Apollo  Astronauts  were  severely  shaken  by this
experience and their  lives  and     subsequent statements
reflect the depth of the revelation and the effect of the
muzzle order which followed. They were ordered to  remain
silent or suffer extreme penalty,  DEATH, which was termed
an "expediency".   One astronaut actually did talk to the
British producers of the         TV expose "Alternative 3"
confirming many of the allegations.
     In the book "Alternative 003" the pseudonym "Bob 
Grodin" was used in place of the astronaut's identity.  It
was also stated that he committed  suicide  in  1978. This 
cannot be validated by  any      source and I believe that 
several so-called facts in the book are disinformation.  I
firmly believe that this disinformation     is a result of
pressure put upon authors and is meant to  nullify     the
effect upon the populace of the British TV expose entitled
"Alternative 3". The  headquarters  of   the international
conspiracy is in Geneva, Switzerland.  The ruling body is
made up of Representatives  of the Governments involved as
well  as  the Executive  members  of the group known as
the  "Bilderburgers". Meetings  are held by the "Policy
Committee" when necessary on  a Nuclear  Submarine beneath
the Polar Ice Cap.    The  secrecy  is such  that this was
the only method which would ensure that  the    meetings
would  not be bugged.   I can say that the book  is  at
least  70%  true from my own knowledge and the  knowledge  
of my sources. I believe  that the disinformation was an
attempt  to compromise the British TV expose with inform-
ation which could  be proven  false,       just    as the
"Eisenhower Briefing  Document"  was released here  in the 
U.S.    under the contingency plan "Majestic Twelve", and
which can also be proven false.
     Since  our  interaction with the aliens began we have
come  into possession  of   technology beyond our wildest
dreams.   A  craft named  Aurora  exist  at Area 51 which
makes regular trips  into space.   It  is a one stage ship
called a  TAV  (transatmospheric vehicle)  and it  can
take off from the ground using  a 7  mile runway,  go into
high orbit, return on its own power, and land on the same
runway. We currently have and fly atomic powered alien
type  craft  at  Area S-4  in  Nevada.   Our  pilots  have
made interplanetary voyages in these craft and have been
to the  Moon, Mars, and other planets aboard these craft.
We have been lied to about the true nature of the Moon,
the planets Mars and Venus and      the  real    state of
technology that we possess today at this very    moment.
    There  are  areas  on the Moon where plant life  grows
and  even changes color with the seasons.   This seasonal
effect is because the Moon does not, as claimed, always
present the exact same side the earth or the sun.   There
is an area that wobbles in  and    out  of  darkness on a
seasonal basis and it is  near  this  area that the  plant 
life grows.   The Moon does have a few man-made lakes  and
ponds upon its surface and clouds have been  observed  and
filmed in its atmosphere.  It possesses a gravitational
field and man can walk upon its surface without a space
suit  breathing    from  an oxygen bottle after undergoing
decompression the same as any deep sea diver.  I have seen
the photographs and some of them  were actually published
in the book "We Discovered Alien Bases on  the Moon" by
Fred Steckling.
     In  1969 a confrontation broke out between the  human
scientists and  the  aliens at the Dulce underground lab.
                                                          
The aliens  took many  of our scientists hostage.    Delta
forces were sent   to free them but were no match against
the alien weapons.  66 of our people  were killed during
this action.   As a result we withdrew    from all joint 
projects for at least 2 years. A reconciliation eventually 
took place and once again we began to interact. Today  the
alliance continues.
     When the Watergate scandal broke, President Nixon had
intended to ride out the storm confident that he could not
be impeached.  MJ-12,  however, had a different agenda.The
intelligence community rightfully     concluded that    an
impeachment trial would open up the files  and bare the
awful secrets to the public eye.   Nixon  was  ordered  to
resign.   He refused and so the first military  coup  ever
to take place in the United States  was  promulgated.  The
joint Chiefs of Staff sent a TOP SECRET message to the
commanders of  all U.S. armed forces throughout the world.
It stated, "Upon receipt  of this message you will      no 
longer carry out any  orders from    the      White House. 
Acknowledge receipt." This message was sent a  full 5 days 
before Nixon conceded and announced publicly  that      he
would resign.  I personally saw this message. When I asked
my commanding    officer  what  he  would do as  obviously
the  order    violated the Constitution,  I was told,  "I
guess I will wait  to   see  if  any  orders come from the
White House and  then  I  will decide." I  did not see any
communication from the White  House but that does not mean
that none was sent.
     During    all  the years that this has been happening
the  Congress      and  the American people have seemed to
know instinctively  that something  was  not right.   When
the Watergate scandal  surfaced they  jumped       on  the
bandwagon and  everyone  thought  that  the       agencies
would  be cleaned out.   President Ford organized      the
Rockefeller  commission  to do the    job.   At least that
is  what everyone thought.   His real purpose was to  head 
off the Congress    and  keep the cover-up going.   Nelson
Rockefeller who headed the    commission investigating the
intelligence community was a  member of  the    Council on
Foreign Relations and was the one who  helped   Eisenhower
build  the  MJ-12  power  structure. Rockefeller uncovered
only enough to keep the hounds at bay.   He threw      the
Congress  few      bones  and the cover-up rolled  merrily
along  as always.
     Later Senator Church would conduct the famous Church
hearings. He also  was a prominent   member of the Council
on Foreign  Relations and he only repeated the Rockefeller
act.   Again the cover-up prevailed. When Iran Contra came
along we thought this time  it had  to  come gushing  out.
Wrong again! Despite mountains  of documents  that pointed
to  drug  smuggling  and  other hidden      monsters,  the 
cover-up sailed through.    Congress even seemed to go out 
of its way to duck the issues that were just under     the
surface. Could it  be that Congress knows the whole thing  
and won't touch it?   Are they amoung the select who have 
been picked for the Mars colony when the Earth begins to
destruct?
     I  cannot         even  begin to outline  the  entire
financial  empire controlled  by  the  CIA,  the NSA,  and
the Council on  Foreign       Relations  that controls and
launders money from drugs and      intelligence  community
proprietary ventures but I can  tell  you the  little that
I know. The amount of money is beyond anything    you  can
imagine and is hidden in a vast networks of  banks     and
holding  companies.     You  should first begin to look at
the  J. Henry  Schroder Banking Corporation,  The Schroder
Trust Company,    Schroders Limited (London), Helbert Wagg
Holdings, LTD., J. Henry Schroder- Wagg  &  Co.,      LTD,
Schroder  Gerbruder  and  Company     (Germany),  Schroder
Munchmeyer Hengst and Company, Castle  Bank    and     its
holding companies,  the Asian Development Bank,  and   the
Nugan Hand octopus of banks and holding companies.
    A  contingency   plan was formulated by MJ-12 to throw
everyone off     the  trail  should they come close to the
truth.   The  plan  was known as MAJESTIC TWELVE.   It was
implemented with the release by Moore,     Shandera,   and
Friedman of  the  purported   genuine "Eisenhower Briefing 
Document". The document is a fraud.   The  document  lists 
the Executive Order as #092447.  A number  which does  not 
exist and will not exist for quite a long time  at     the
present rate.   Truman wrote Executive Orders in the 9,000
range, Eisenhower  wrote in the 10,000 range,  Ford was up
to the 11,000 bracket, and Reagan got only into the 12,000
numbers.  Executive Orders  are numbered consecutively, no
matter who occupies  the       White  House for reasons of
continuity,  record keeping,  and  to prevent   confusion.
The  Executive Order is only 1  of  several   fatal  flaws
contained within the document. The plan so far has  thrown
the entire research community off the trail  for  several
years and has resulted in the wasted expenditure of money
looking for  information which does not exist. It resulted
in    total waste  of a grant by the Fund for UFO Research
of  $16,000  which was given to        Stanton Friedman to
research the information.   Many thousands  of  man  hours
have  gone into  looking  for a  "Red  Herring".   If  you 
doubt the secret government's ability to  run  you through
the rose garden you had better think again.
     Another     contingency  plan  is  in  force  and  is
working  upon you  today.   It  is the plan to prepare the
public for  eventual confrontation with an alien race. The
public is being bombarded with movies,radio,  advertising,
and TV depicting almost every aspect of the true nature of
the alien presence. This includes the  good  and  the bad.
Look around and  pay  attention.   The aliens are planning
to  make  their  presence  known  and  the  government  is
preparing  you for it so that there  will be  no panic.
    The  worst  contingency plan has also been implemented
and is  at work right  now.   For many years now they have
been importing drugs  and  selling them to the people  and
mainly  the  poor  and minorities. Social welfare programs
were put into  place  to    create a dependent non-working 
element of our society. They    began to remove the social 
welfare   programs in order    to develop a large criminal 
class that did not exist in the 50's and early 60's.  They
encouraged the manufacture and importation    of    deadly
military  firearms  for the criminal element to  use. This
was intended to foster a feeling of insecurity which would
lead  the American people to voluntarily disarm themselves
by passing  laws against  firearms.  Incidents were to  be
staged to speed up  the process.   By  using     drugs and
hypnosis in a process called Orion on  mental patients the
CIA inculcated the desire in these people  to open fire on
school yards and    inflame the anti-gun lobby. This  plan  
                                                          
is  well underway and so far is  working as planned.  This
plan must not succeed.
     Due  to the    wave of crime sweeping the nation they
will  convince the  American  people    a state of anarchy
exists within  the    major cities.  They are now building
their case almost nightly on TV and daily in   newspapers.
When public opinion has been won  over  to  this idea they
intend to state that a  terrorist group     armed  with  a
nuclear weapon has entered the United  States  and    that
they plan to    detonate this device in one of our cities.
The  government     will then suspend the Constitution and
declare Martial Law. The  secret  alien  army of implanted
humans  and  all dissidents,  which translated into anyone 
they choose,  will  be   rounded  up  and  will  be placed 
in  concentration  camps which   already  exist throughout 
the country. They are each  one  mile   square.   Are  the
people  whom they intend to  place in  these concentration
camps destined  to make the  reported "Batch Consignments"
of slave labor needed by the Space  Colonies? the   media,
radio,  TV,newspapers,  and  computer networks will  be
nationalized  and  seized.   Anyone who resists will be
taken  or killed.   This  entire operation was rehearsed
by the  government and  military in 1984 under the code
name REX-84 and it went  off   without  a hitch.   When
these events have transpired the SECRET GOVERNMENT and/or
ALIEN takeover will be complete. Your freedom will  never
be returned and you will live in  slavery  for  the
remainder  of  your  life.   You had better wake up and
you  had better do it now.
     Phil  Klass is  an agent of the CIA and this was
stated  in  the   documents  I saw between 1970 and 1973.
One of his jobs  as  an   aviation  expert was to debunk
everything to do with  UFOs.   All military  commanders
were  instructed  to  call  him  to   gain     information
on how to debunk and/or explain UFO contacts  and/or
sightings to the public and/or press if and when the need
arose.
     William Moore,Jaimie Shandera,  and Stanton Friedman
are either   witting   (with  knowledge)  or  unwitting
(being  used without     knowledge) agents of the secret
government.   I prefer to believe that they are unwitting
although William Moore's reported us of a        Defense
Investigation  Service  ID card and  his reported  self
confession  to Lee Graham that he was an agent of the
government makes me seriously doubt it, if the reports are
true.  Lee Graham   called me at my home, and when asked,
he confirmed that Moore had indeed done this.
    Stanton    Friedman has told me and many others that
years  ago  he   "helped develop a nuclear reactor, to 
power an aircraft, that was the size of a basketball, was 
clean, turned out  hydrogen,  and worked like a dream".   
His words not mine.   The only fuel which   could go into 
such an engine and produce hydrogen as a by-product   is  
water.   The  only place in the universe at that time to  
get such technology was from the aliens.   Is he really 
unwitting?  I do  not know.   He was a member  of  the
Moore,  Shandera,  and Friedman  research  team  and  it 
was they  who implemented  the MAJESTIC TWELVE contingency
plan.
     In  the  documents  which I saw between 1970 and 1973
names  of individuals  were listed who were to be targeted
for  recruitment      in  order  that the contingency plan
known  as  MAJESTIC TWELVE     could  be introduced to the 
public by persons known and   respected    by  the public.
Bruce Macabee,  Stanton Friedman,  and  William Moore were 
among those listed.  I do not know that the    subsequent
events do not seem to indicate the      Bruce Macabee is
involved  but the  actions  of      Stanton Friedman and
William Moore  are  highly suspect.
     I know that  all the major UFO research organizations
were targeted  for infiltration and control by the  secret
government just  as  NICAP was infiltrated and controlled.
I believe  that these efforts have been successful. It is
very possible that the major UFO     publications are also
controlled.
     Today,     MJ-12 still exists and operates just as it
always has. It is made up of the same structure,6 from the
same positions  in government, and  6 from the   executive
members of the Council  on  Foreign      Relations  and/or
Trilateral Commission.   The  Majority  Agency  for  Joint
Intelligence is publicly known as the  Senior  Interagency
Group (SIG).
     In    closing it is most important to understand that
the council on      Foreign Relations and its offshoot the
Trilateral Commission  not only  control    but own   this
country.   Long before WWII they  were    instrumental  in
helping to decide policy for the United States Government.
The  Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral   Commission
and their  foreign  counterparts  report to Bilderburgers.
Almost  every high level government and military  official
of any consequence since WWII including presidents    have
been   members  of the  Council  on  Foreign  Relations
and/or Trilateral  Commission.   All American members of
the Trilateral Commission  have been either been or are a
member of the  Council on Foreign Relations.
     Each foreign nation of any importance    has its own
offshoot of the Council  on  Foreign    Relations and the
members of  each  country    interact with those of other
countries through the Bilderburgers to     further  their
common  goals. The foreign  member  of  the    Trilateral
Commission belong to their respective  organizations.
    Even a cursory investigation by the most inexperienced
researcher will  show that the members of the  Council on
Foreign  Relations and the Trilateral  Commission control
the major foundations,  all of the major media,publishing
interests,  the largest banks,all the major corporations,
the upper echelons of the government, and many other vital
interests. Their members are elected and appointed because
they have all the money and special interests behind them.
All, that  is,  except the  peoples. They are undemocratic
and do not in any way represent the majority of  the U.S.
of America.   These are the people who will decide     who
survives the coming holocaust and who does not.
    The Bilderburgers,  the  Council on Foreign  Relations
and the Trilateral Commission  are the SECRET   GOVERNMENT 
and  rule  this nation  through  MJ-12 and the study group
known  as  the  Jason Society    or Jason Scholars and the 
top echelon of the  government     which consist mostly of 
their members.
    Throughout  our history    the Aliens have manipulated 
and/or   ruled the human       race through various secret 
societies, religion, magic, witchcraft, and the    occult.
The Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Comm-
ission are in complete control of the alien technology and
are  also in complete control  of  the  nation's  economy.
Eisenhower was the last president to know the  entire ov-
erview of the alien problem. Succeeding presidents   were  
told only  what  MJ-12 and the Intelligence     Community 
wanted them to know and believe me, it wasn't the truth.   
    MJ-12  has presented each new president with a picture 
of a  lost alien culture  seeking  to renew itself,  build 
a home  on  this       planet, and shower us with gifts of 
technology. In some cases the president  was told nothing.
Each president in turn has  bought the story, or  no story 
at all,  hook line and sinker.  Meanwhile innocent  people
continue to suffer unspeakable  horrors at  the  hands  of
alien and human scientists who   are engaged in barbarous
research  that would make even the Nazis look like sunday
school  children.   As  if that is not enough many people
end up as  food for  the  insatiable  alien  appetite for
biological   enzymes, glandular  hormonal secretions,  and
blood.   Many  people  are abducted  and  are  sentenced  
to  live  with psychological  and  physical damage for the 
rest of their lives.   In the documents I saw, 1 in     40 
humans have been implanted with devices the purpose    of
which I have never discovered.   The government believes 
that the  aliens are building an army of human implants 
which  can  be activated and turned upon us at will. You 
should also know that to  date we have not even begun to 
come close to parity with  the aliens. Is this technology 
worth it?
    The conclusions are inescapable. (1) The secret power
structure believes that,  because of our own ignorance  or
by  Divine  Decree,  planet Earth  will      self destruct
sometime in the near future. These men  sincerely  believe
that they are doing the right thing in their  attempt   to
save the human race.  It is terribly ironic that they have
been  forced to take as their  partner an alien race which
is itself   engaged in a monumental struggle for survival.
Many moral and legal compromises have been made  in   this
joint effort. These  compromises    were made in error and
must  be corrected and those responsible should be made to
account for their  actions.  I can understand the fear and
urgency  that must  have been instrumental in the decision
not to tell  the  public.  Obviously   I   disagree   with
this   decision.
     Throughout  history  small but powerful groups  of
men  have consistently  felt  that they alone were capable
of  deciding the fates of millions and throughout  history
they have  been wrong.   This  great  nation owes its very
existence  to the    Principles  of Freedom and Democracy.
I believe with all my heart  that the United     States of
America cannot and will  not succeed  in any effort that
ignores those  principles. Full  disclosure to the public
should be made and we should proceed    to save the human
race altogether.
     (2) We  are  being  manipulated  by a joint   human/
alien  power structure  which    will result in the total
enslavement and  or destruction  of the human race.   We
must use any  and every  means available to prevent this
from happening.
     (3) The  government  has been totally deceived and we
are  being manipulated  byan alien power which will result
in the total enslavement  and/or destruction of the human
race.   We must   use  any  and  every means available  to
prevent  this  from happening.
     (4) Something  else  is happening which is beyond our
ability  to understand at this time.  We must force discl-
osure of all the facts, discover the truth and act upon
the truth.
     In  any case we MUST force disclosure of the truth or
no  matter what  happens we will surely deserve it.   The 
situation in which    we find ourselves is due to our own
actions or inactions over the last 44 years. It is our own
fault and we are the only ones who can change  it. Through
ignorance or misplaced trust we as a people have abdicated
our  role as  the "watch  dog"  of  our  government.   Our
government was founded "of the people,  for the   people,
by the people".   There was no mention or intent  to ever
abdicate  our role and place our total trust in a handful
of  men who  meet  secretly and decide our fate for  us.
In  fact  the structure  of  our government was designed
to prevent that  from  ever  happening.   If we had done
our jobs as citizens this could    never  have happened.
Most of us are completely ignorant as  to even  the most
basic functions of our government.   We have truly become
anation of sheep.   Sheep are always eventually led to the
slaughter.   It  is  time to  stand  up in  the  manner
of  our forefathers and walk like men.   I remind you all, 
that the Jews of  Europe  marched to the    ovens,  after
having  been warned, believing all the while that the
facts could not possibly be true.   When  the  outside
world was told  of  the holocaust   occuring  in Hitler's
Europe it was not believed.   I state  here  and now that
Hitler was manipulated by these same aliens.               
     I  have brought you the truth as I know it.   I do
not care  what you  think of me. I have done my duty and
no matter what  fate lies  in  store for me,  I can truly
meet my maker with  a  clear conscience. I  believe first
in God.   The same God my ancestors believed in. I believe
in Jesus Christ and that he is my Savior. I believe second
in the Constitution of the United  States  of America  as
it was written and meant to work.   I have  given  my oath
to protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States of America against all enemies foreign and
DOMESTIC.  I intend to fulfill that oath.
                                             Thank You,
