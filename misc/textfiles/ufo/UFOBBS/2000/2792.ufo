      "On  a  cold morning just before dawn in the winter of  1991,   Steve 
    Tobias saw a UFO. He wasn't impressed. It was over Baltimore-Washington 
    International Airport,  for one thing,  where the airspace is typically 
    abuzz with flying objects, identified and otherwise. But Tobias says he 
    saw  something.  He was working maintenance for a major airline -  he'd 
    rather  not  say which one - cleaning the idle planes during the  night 
    shift,   when  he saw 'a hurtling object,  almost  perfectly  circular, 
    brilliant greenish-yellow, streaking across the lower blackened portion 
    of  the morning sky,'  according to his own written account.  The light 
    skittered  over the BWI control tower and disappeared into the  distant 
    clouds in a few brief seconds.  'It seemed to have been moving at great 
    speed,' Tobias wrote, 'at which I could not begin to estimate.' 
    
      But he didn't think a great deal of it at the time.  This was  before 
    Tobias thought a lot about UFOs.  He went in his office to get a cup of 
    coffee and warm up a little. One of the guys from the morning shift was 
    just  showing up,  and he was talking about the darndest things he  had 
    heard on his CB radio driving into work a few minutes earlier. A couple 
    of truckers out on I-95  were saying they saw something up in the  sky, 
    some kind of UFO or something. 

      'Don't tell me,' Tobias said, half-joking. 'It was green.' 

      It was green, of course, according to the truckers. 

      Tobias  unwittingly had stumbled upon some independent  corroborating 
    evidence  for his early-morning fireball.  And with that,  Steve Tobias 
    decided  that  he had joined the ever-growing ranks of the  human  race 
    that have seen, or think they have seen, an unidentified flying object. 

      Since 1947, when a reporter named Bill Bequette added the term flying 
    saucer  to our increasingly scary postwar lexicon after a  pilot  named 
    Kenneth Arnold spotted nine wingless craft scooting past Mt.   Rainier, 
    in  Washington State,  at what he thought was 1,700  mph,   hundred  of 
    thousands  of  people from around the world claim to have seen them  as 
    well.   Elvis  Presley saw one in the desert outside  of  Vegas.   More 
    convincingly,   my mom saw one in the skies over Adelphi,  Greece,   in 
    1952. Maybe you have seen one too. 

      If you have, welcome to the other side, that uncounted segment of the 
    human populace that believes We Are Not Alone, and has the visual goods 
    to prove it. You have plenty of company. Here in the U.S.,  in the land 
    where  atom bombs and flying saucers appeared at more or less the  same 
    time,  the UFO has become a familiar tabloid totem, a hip 60's TV show, 
    a kitschy symbol of American cold-war paranoia,  a  British heavy-metal 
    band,   and one of the most instantly recognizable government  acronyms 
    around.   Jung thought UFOs were collective psychic  manifestations  -- 
    flying  mandalas.  The Air Force always seemed to think that they  were 
    weather balloons -- or 'swamp gas,' whatever that is. 

      But through it all, or those of you who lost interest some time after 
    "Chariots of the Gods"  but before the "Weekly World News"  space alien 
    met  with Ross Perot,  the sightings never have stopped.  By 1969,   22 
    years and hundreds of unresolved cases after the Mt.  Rainier sighting, 
    the U.S.  Air Force's Project Blue Book, the government's only official 
    UFO  investigative  unit,   was under pressure to put up  or  shut  up. 
    Earlier  that same year,  the Condon Committee,  an Air Force-sponsored 
    civilian  scientific  study  made by the  University  of  Colorado  and 
    chaired  by  astrophysicist  Dr.  Edward Condon,  issued  its  infamous 
    report. This group - roughly equivalent to the Warren Commission in the 
    eyes  of  indignant  UFOlogists  -  stated  that  there  was  still  no 
    verifiable  evidence  that  UFOs  were either  hostile  or  real,   and 
    recommended that the Air Force stop fooling around with Blue Book. 

      Life  in  1969  was deemed weird enough without flying  saucers.   On 
    December 17,  on the anniversary of the Wright Brothers'  first powered 
    flight at Kitty Hawk,  North Carolina,  Project Blue Book was  official 
    canceled.  Nine years later,  "Dragnet's"  Jack Webb produced  "Project 
    U.F.O.",  a  short-lived television series based on Project Blue Book - 
    it was also canceled. 

      This  Monday,   on another,  slightly more famous  anniversary,   the 
    quincentennial   of  Christopher  Columbus'   discovery  (or  invasion, 
    depending on which side of the ocean you were on) of the Americas, NASA 
    will  throw  the switch on another project that will obliquely  try  to 
    answer that same nagging,  terrifying question: Are We Alone? Or to put 
    in Age of Discovery terms, What's Over There? 

      The  project  is  -  or was - called SETI,   the  Search  for  Extra-
    Terrestrial  Intelligence,   and if you get a chance to ask  anyone  in 
    charge, they'll be quick to say that it has nothing to do with UFOs. It 
    has  so  little to do with UFOs,  in fact,  that a few weeks  ago  they 
    changed  the  name of the whole program,   because  "Extra-Terrestrial" 
    tended  to  make  people think about UFOs.  It is now called  the  High 
    Resolution Microwave Survey,  or HRMS,  a  more technically descriptive 
    but altogether less funky name.  The ultimate goal and rationale behind 
    the program remains the same, however - to listen for positive evidence 
    of life beyond Earth. 

      After  a  glitzy  LIFE magazine cover story in August  and  a  bitter 
    funding  fight  in Congress,  SETI (or HRMS)  will be  deployed  (i.e., 
    turned on)  on schedule this Columbus Day and begin its high-tech sweep 
    of  the  cosmic radio dial,  searching for a faint radio wave from  the 
    distant light years that could indicate,  finally,  whether intelligent 
    life here is as lonely as it seems. 

      Steve  Tobias,   for  one,  doesn't need to be told  by  any  big  PR 
    government  research study whether there's something out there or  not. 
    He saw one of the damn things.  And since that cold morning in 1991, he 
    has  become convinced that not only is extraterrestrial life  possible, 
    or  likely  - even NASA says that now - but it is going to show  up  en 
    masse any day now.  And these discoverers are going to teach the  third 
    planet from the sun a lesson in interstellar imperialism that will  put 
    Columbus to shame. 

      On the phone, Tobias sounds worried. 
 
      'I haven't been in a good mood since I found out about these things,' 
    he says. 
   
      It  sounds as if he means it.  Even in the midst of a breathless bout 
    of doom-laden alien speculation,  his voice has the desperate edge of a 
    man who has a very serious job to do, a  man who must be heard, even if 
    it frequently  is difficult to follow the thread of what he's trying to 
    say.  Right now he is talking alternately about tidal waves,  hurricane 
    Andrew,  AIDS,  and a passage in Virgil's "Aeneid," all of which may be 
    linked to extraterrestrial  intervention.  It may be  a stretch for the 
    layman, but Steve Tobias has been doing his homework. 
   
   
      After  his  brief encounter at BWI,  Tobias took a trip to his  local 
    library  and  perused a few books on UFOs.  Even after doing that,   he 
    still wasn't all that convinced that they existed,  but it seemed worth 
    following  up  on.   Previously,  he says,  he was a  typical  skeptic, 
    uninterested  in  either  the  UFOs  or  even  in  the  science-fiction 
    literature  and films in which they figure so prominently.  But one  of 
    the books he picked up,  David C.  Knight's UFOs - A Pictorial  History 
    From Antiquity to the Present, mentioned reports of glowing 'fireballs' 
    from  the  distant past - these sounded similar to what he had seen  at 
    BWI.   Other  books told of crashed saucers in the New  Mexico  desert, 
    alien bodies in cold storage at Ohio's Wright-Patterson AFB,  Air Force 
    pilots killed chasing flying discs in 1948,  massive government  cover-
    ups,  official disinformation campaigns, and scads of mysterious above-
    top-secret evidence that Uncle Sam knew what  UFOs  were and where they 
    were coming from. 

      'I  was  flabbergasted,'   Tobias says.  'Why in  the  hell  was  the 
    government sitting on this?  Why wasn't this on MPT?'  [Maryland Public 
    TV.] 

      The  incidents that he stumbled upon are,  of course,   all  familiar 
    pieces  of the vast body of popular UFOlogy,  the subjects of  numerous 
    books  and  films  and  tabloid headlines.  But for  Tobias  it  was  a 
    revelation,  a  call to action.  And it was only the beginning.  'I was 
    shaken  out  of my dull-witted complacency and began to tie many  other 
    events  and trends together,'  he writes in his account of the  fateful 
    moment. 

      Since  then,  Tobias has tied a lot together.  He also has formed his 
    own  UFO  investigation and research group,  which  he  calls  Citizens 
    Investigation of Phenomena Psychic, Astral, and Celestial (CIPPAC). 

      At this stage,  he admits,  CIPPAC is still pretty much just himself. 
    But  he  has great ambitions and a deadly serious mission.  'I  decided 
    that   the government made a grave mistake in trying to cover this up,' 
    he says. 'There is a possibility that we are all in a lot of danger.' 

      Before personally subjecting myself to CIPPAC's stockpile of alarming 
    new evidence,  I  figured it was time to  apprise myself of some of the 
    latest in UFO literature.  Since 1951,  when Frank Scully's "Behind the 
    Flying Saucers" - a clumsily hoaxed account of a saucer that crashed in 
    New  Mexico with its crew of 16  tiny,  human-looking alien crewmen  on 
    board  -  was  published,  the UFO phenomenon has  perpetuated  itself, 
    supported itself, and,  arguably, scientifically crippled itself with a 
    thriving   industry   of  freelance   investigations,    pseudoacademic 
    theorizing, and various starling firsthand accounts. 

      My  favorite  always  has  been "God Drives  a  Flying  Saucer,"   an 
    amazingly wacky 1973  paperback by one R.L.  Dione,  which insists that 
    UFOs were merely the 'angels' of a distant supertechnological alien God 
    who accomplished the various miracles of Biblical renown (i.e.,  Jesus' 
    walking  on  the  water,   the  revelation  of  Saul,   the  Immaculate 
    Conception) through force fields, hypno-beams, antigravity devices, and 
    other common saucer gizmos. 

      Couldn't find that one at the Pratt [Enoch Pratt Library, Baltimore], 
    but there were plenty of other new developments.  The most dramatic and 
    well-documented recent incident  is  definitely the series of sightings 
    that occurred over  a  period of several  months  to  a couple,  Ed and 
    Frances Walters, in Gulf Breeze,  Florida,  in 1987-88. Compared to the 
    usual  fuzzy  black-and-white blurs that filled the UFO exposes  of  my 
    youth,   the  Walters'  slick,  full-color account,  "The  Gulf  Breeze 
    Sightings,"   was  almost absurdly well documented.   These  poor  guys 
    couldn't  get  rid  of  their UFOs.  Ed Walters  claimed  20   separate 
    sightings and took 39  color photos,  mostly Polaroids,  of the various 
    saucers  that  buzzed  his house,  spoke to him  telepathically,   shot 
    immobilizing  blue beams at him and his wife,  deposited hostile little 
    big-eyed  aliens  on  his porch,  and woke up his dog,   Crystal.   The 
    pictures are amazing, almost too good. You can count the windows on the 
    saucers,   which  look  kind  of like  Chinese  lanterns  or  Christmas 
    ornaments.  If it is a hoax,  they certainly chose the corniest-looking 
    flying saucers imaginable. 

      I  have yet to see a UFO of any kind,  although I always have kept my 
    eyes open for them. I'm certain that anyone who grew up watching enough 
    television  does  too.   Hollywood in the 70s painted  a  fairly  sunny 
    picture of our alien visitors,  compared with the lurking paranoia that 
    informed their 50's/atomic-age counterparts. (Ever seen the creepy 1953 
    film "Invaders From Mars?) In the 70s, however, wondrous, childlike ETs 
    descended  from  the heavens in glittering chandeliers to  save  petty, 
    grumpy  humanity  from our own miserable selves and treat  us  to  eye-
    popping special effects. Sounds good. Come on down. Sign me up. 

      My  mother  now says that she and a friend observed what  could  only 
    have been a UFO while on vacation in Greece in 1952,  a  huge year  for 
    sightings, incidentally, according to Project Blue Book: 1,500 reports, 
    303   of  them  unexplained.   Luckily,  she  did  not  volunteer  this 
    information during my childhood, lest my imagination suffer a permanent 
    and  debilitating overdose.  And unlike Steve Tobias,  my mom  was  not 
    transformed by her encounter into a crusader for UFO truth and justice. 
    She  did,  however,  take it seriously enough to report the incident to 
    the  U.S.  consulate in Athens,  where it was no doubt chuckled at  and 
    thrown away. 

      Nevertheless,   it was a fairly dramatic experience.  For one  thing, 
    Adelphi, Greece, is a fairly dramatic place to see a UFO. It was, after 
    all,  the location of the Oracle of Apollo, a place the ancients called 
    'the  navel of the world.'  It was a stunningly clear day  in  pre-smog 
    Greece,  not a soul around,  and 'the most awful quiet,' Mom says.  She 
    heard it before she saw it,  'a sort of whiny sound,'  not a prop or  a 
    helicopter,  and certainly not a jet, which would have been exceedingly 
    rare in 1952 anyway. Then she and her friend saw it. 

      'It  was shaped like and upside-down clamshell,'  she says,  'and  it 
    moved around jerkily.  We must have watched it for ten minutes,  but it 
    never occurred to me to take a picture.' 

      After  hovering  around and casing the place for a while,   it  'shot 
    straight  up  like a helicopter,'  she says,  then  vanished  into  the 
    cloudless  sky at enormous speed.  'It was up and gone in  about  three 
    seconds.' 

      And  that  was Mom's UFO.  It may not be quite as spectacular  as  Ed 
    Walters' pesky talking UFOs, but it struck me as being more remarkable, 
    for two reasons.  One: even though '52 was a big UFO hysteria year,  my 
    mom knew nothing of the existing body of evidence regarding  sightings. 
    For that matter, she still doesn't. They're just not her thing. Yet her 
    account  is  completely consistent with most of the accepted  recurring 
    elements in UFO behavior:  the jerky hovering, the unearthly whine, the 
    last-second  zip straight up and out of sight....  This is classic  UFO 
    stuff. Ed's UFOs were doing that all the time. 

      Two: my mom wouldn't make this up. 
      
      'If you don't know what's going on,'  Steve Tobias tells me,  'you're 
    sheep going to the slaughter.  And the cruel thing is,  it doesn't have 
    to be that way.' 

      He's running through his visual evidence, some of which is just clips 
    from  infotainment  shows  such  as Hard Copy  and  this  season's  new 
    Sightings.   But  he's also got NASA footage from some  of  the  Apollo 
    flights - scenes of an astronaut's jerky spacewalk that Tobias believed 
    was closely monitored by small UFOs whizzing by periodically.  He  runs 
    the VCR back and forth in slow motion. 

      'There  it is!  Did you see it?  I'll run it by again.  If you're not 
    looking for something, you're not gonna see it.' 

      Sure  enough,   something - little more than a bright speck  -  keeps 
    flitting across the screen behind the astronaut's shoulder. Tobias says 
    that  he  has  watched the scene countless  times,   has  analyzed  the 
    object's trajectory and the way the sunlight reflects off of it, and he 
    is convinced that the speck is a small round craft of some kind,  under 
    intelligent control. 

      'They  are  out  there and they have been  seen,'   he  says.   '[The 
    astronauts] notified mission control and it was covered up.' 

      Tobias  is  not  the first to claim that the Apollo  astronauts  were 
    continually  dogged by UFOs and that NASA scrupulously covered  up  the 
    reports.   That  has been a mainstay of UFO conspiracy  literature  for 
    decades. But he thinks that he may be the first to have picked them out 
    of NASA's own file footage. 

      This kind of low-budget home investigation now has become the guiding 
    passion of Tobias' life. Since an on-the-job injury put him out of work 
    in April 1991  (not long after his UFO sighting),  he has used his free 
    time to immerse himself in the collective evidence of UFOlogy,   filing 
    his Dundalk  rowhome  with  dog-eared copies of  70s paperbacks such as 
    Timothy  Goode's conspiracy tome "Above Top Secret",  videos,   xeroxed 
    documents  obtained  through  the Freedom of  Information  Act,   weird 
    newsletters from fringe UFO groups, and his own notebooks. 

      Now  40  years old,  Tobias was a member of the Maryland Air National 
    Guard  from  1972   to 1988,  where he rose to the  rank  of  technical 
    sergeant. It was his military experience, he says, that led him to take 
    on the thankless task of spreading the word. 

      'This  whole thing points to a threat to the public,'  he says.  'I'm 
    working on the assumption of imminent conflict.  But not conflict as we 
    know it.' 

      Tobias  has taken the old axiom of cosmologist Martin Rees and turned 
    it  into  a sort of manifesto of sorts.  Rees said,   in  reference  to 
    extraterrestrial  life,   that 'absence of evidence if not evidence  of 
    absence.' For Tobias, absence of evidence is evidence of hostility. 

      'There's   no  reason  to  assume  that  the  aliens  have   friendly 
    intentions,'  he says.  'In the military, if you're using stealth,  you 
    are in an aggressive posture.' He figures the reasons that UFOs, having 
    journeyed here for hundreds of thousands of light- years from a distant 
    galaxy,   are  being  so coy with us is that they're scouting  out  the 
    battlefield.   'Reconnaissance is the staging for the final onslaught,' 
    he  explains.  For Tobias,  this sneakiness is tantamount to an act  of 
    war,  and if the government refuses to fess up and tell the people what 
    the hell is going on, he will do it himself. 

      'I guess it's akin to Paul Revere saying the Redcoats are coming,' he 
    tells me. 

      Sipping iced tea in his living room,  Tobias speculates grimly on the 
    final  onslaught as his two young kids tromp in and out on a hot  late-
    summer afternoon.  A  kitten periodically clambers around and falls off 
    the sofa. 

      'This  would  not be a war of conquest,'  he says.   'This  would  be 
    obliteration. This would be ... special genocide.' 

      Things are falling into frightening patterns here in Dundalk.  Tobias 
    connects chains  of  seemingly random events and links  them back to an 
    unseen alien hand. He sees world events and phenomena as diverse as the 
    fall  of  communism  and the weather as sinister manifestations  of  an 
    intricate  master plan to unbalance this hapless planet.  Such as:  Why 
    did  hurricanes Andrew and Iniki lay waste only to American  territory? 
    And finally: What was that seven-foot-tall reptilian creature those two 
    guys in South Carolina saw? 

      'What does that look like to you?' 

      Tobias  shows me one of his CIPPAC documents,  a  Xerox of a  strange 
    black silhouette,  supposedly an infrared computer scan beamed to Earth 
    from the Soviet Phobos II satellite in 1989.  He says that it is a vast 
    cylindrical object 15.5 miles long,  lurking undetected in space behind 
    the Martian moon Phobos.  With a bit of imagination,  it looks sort  of 
    like the ship in "Battlestar Galactica." 

      'I don't know,' I say. 'It's hard to tell.' 

      According  to NASA (according to Tobias),  it is a computer flaw.  he 
    thinks it might be the invasion vessel itself, all 15 miles of it. 

      'I'm assuming the worst,'  he says.  'There could be a thousand ships 
    behind that moon....  It's nice to see a movie  called "Star Wars," but 
    from a military perspective, it boggles the mind.' 

      The  kids are playing upstairs,  too loudly.  Tobias'   wife  marches 
    upstairs to settle them down.  Tobias admits his wife would 'rather not 
    get dragged into this'  and that most friends and family have been less 
    than receptive to his campaign. 

      'Most  of  them  don't  believe in UFOs,'  he  says.   'They're  like 
    everybody else. They see the whole subject as entertainment.' 

      The  fault for this,  he believes,  lies with the media.  Because the 
    government is keeping all the hard evidence bottled up, no one can take 
    these things seriously anymore.  'Television and the movies  trivialize 
    UFO phenomena,' he rails. 'It has made the public completely culturally 
    desensitized.  It's lobotomizing the public consciousness.  It's taking 
    away the right to wonder.' 

      One wonders, then, what to make of NASA's SETI program, the high-tech 
    search for just the kind  of alien civilizations that the UFO community 
    has been insisting are visiting us regularly.  The official NASA  party 
    line,   of course,  has always been that UFOs are impossible,  for  all 
    practical purposes, because of the vast distances involved between star 
    systems  and  the  colossal  time  and energy  required  to  attempt  a 
    crossing. The best hope for detection lies not in a physical visit from 
    a  neighboring  life  form but rather in the radio waves  that  such  a 
    civilization might conceivably be beaming our way. 

      For  Steve  Tobias,  as well for many other freelance UFOlogists  who 
    make a point not to trust NASA or any other arm of the government,  the 
    hope and hype of the impending SETI program is an empty diversion. 

      'It's still the Big Lie,' Tobias says,  'but it's a different part of 
    the Big Lie.' 

      Tobias' theory is that SETI is just an elaborate gimmick, a  PR trick 
    to further desensitize the public. 
      
      'NASA is trying to save their own integrity [with the SETI program],' 
    he says.  'It's an excuse.  It would just tell us what has been  slowly 
    massaged into the American consciousness.' 

      Similar  rumbles  are  being  heard  throughout  the  UFO  community, 
    according to the folks at the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, or 
    CUFOS,  as it's known, in Chicago.  CUFOS is probably the closest thing 
    UFOlogists have to a serious scientific research center. It was founded 
    in 1973  by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek,  the chairman of the astronomy 
    department  at  Northwestern  University,   an  Air  Force   consultant 
    throughout  the Blue Book era and a sort of scientific guru to the  UFO 
    community. CUFOS is basically an information clearinghouse and archive, 
    supported  by subscriptions to its monthly "International UFO Reporter" 
    and its biannual "Journal of UFO Studies," an academic journal. 

      CUFOS  also  tried to crank out two books a year,  with much  of  the 
    recent  material focused on the Roswell Case --  the 1947   New  Mexico 
    saucer crash and cover-up of Hangar 18 fame. David Boras, the assistant 
    to CUFOS director Mark Rodeghier, says that he's heard plenty of rumors 
    about the SETI program. 

      'For  the  most part,'  he says,  'people in SETI have a negative  or 
    indifferent  attitude towards UFOs....  They honestly don't believe  in 
    the phenomenon.  But there is that rumor in the UFO community that  the 
    SETI people are going to release information [about a contact] as a way 
    to condition people into accepting the existence of UFOs.' 

      Boras  stresses,  however that there is 'no real evidence for  this,' 
    adding  it's  just  part of the fringe group of UFOlogy.   Some  people 
    believe that [the government] knows everything,  that they have been in 
    contact for years...  there have been treaties...  all sorts of  stuff. 
    And everyone believes that this year they're gonna tell.' 

      Boras  sounds vaguely sad.  Disheartened.  As if maybe he's given  up 
    hope. As if maybe the government is never going to tell. 

      'It just sorta messes things up,  dealing with the fringe groups,' he 
    intones,   sadly.  'It's keeping the brains in the scientific community 
    from  wanting to pursue the field.  It's certainly keeping the  funding 
    away...'  he says, trailing off.  It sounds as if maybe he's had enough 
    of life on the UFO trail. 

      'It just gets kinda irritating.' 

      Michael  Mewhinney,  who's handling public relations for NASA's  SETI 
    program  from  his office at Ames Research Center,  in  Moffett  Field, 
    California, not far from San Francisco, is kind of irritated too. First 
    of  all,  the powers that be just changed the name of his project  last 
    week,   long after all the press material and general hoopla were  sent 
    out,  so now he has to make sure all reporters who call use 'HRMS'   in 
    their stories instead of 'SETI.' Second of all, I just mentioned UFOs. 

      'NASA has nothing to do with UFOs!'  he says, bristling.  'We are not 
    wasting taxpayer money.' 

      It sounds as if he's been through this before. 

      'This is not a frivolous enterprise -- this is serious science!' 

      Traditionally,   folks  at  NASA  are touchy  about  the  UFO  thing, 
    especially  with  all  the  trouble they have had  trying  to  convince 
    Congress to fund a search for distant alien civilizations in the middle 
    of  a recession.  Dr.  Gary Coulter,  the program manager for the newly 
    titled  HRMS,   knows  all  about  that.   Coulter  has  been  at  NASA 
    headquarters, in Washington, D.C., throughout the funding fray, setting 
    records  straight  and nudging the  $10-million-per-year  program  past 
    Congressional  critics.  He says that the new moniker has been  in  the 
    works for a while. 

      'It's a matter of semantics,'  he says.  'It's been obvious that when 
    we've  been criticized,  it's not for the science.  Most of what  draws 
    criticism  is  the  connotation  that  if you  are  searching  for  ETI 
    [extraterrestrial intelligence], it must be frivolous.' 

      According  to  Coulter,   there's  an official  NASA  name  for  this 
    phenomenon: 'SETI has what we call a Giggle Factor.' 

      The  Giggle  Factor  apparently was the final straw for  the  project 
    acronym.   'The name had this lightning rod stuck in the middle of it,' 
    he says. 

      Mike  Mewhinney back at Ames agrees.  'We're looking for  intelligent 
    life,  not ETs,' he complains indignantly.  'ET is that cute little guy 
    in the movies.' 

      In NASAspeak,  ETI tends to lead inexorably to LGM (Little Green Men) 
    in the minds of the public. 'It's like putting a red flag in front of a 
    charging bull,' Coulter says. 

      Whenever  NASA  functionaries are faced with  UFO-related  questions, 
    these Little Green Men always show up somehow. They even have their own 
    acronym now.  It is the ultimate shorthand put-down for nosy reporters, 
    instantly  defusing  the  most  loaded  of  questions  and  making  the 
    unfortunate inquirer look and feel like a four-year-old in the process. 
    'Oh!  You're talking about the Little Green Men,' they always say. It's 
    very effective. 

      Coulter manages to invoke the LGM only once,  but he throws in a  few 
    popular film allusions for good measure. 

      'This  is not a Bug Hunt,'  he says,  recalling a line from the  film 
    "Aliens." 'We are not a search-and-rescue team for UFOs. And I've never 
    felt a burning desire to climb the Devil's Tower, either.' 

      And as for those rumors about SETI/HRMS being a cover for an eventual 
    UFO disinformation campaign? Or a PR stunt? 

      'Well, I've never heard that one before,'  he says in a tone of voice 
    that indicates he has heard plenty of others.  'Look, I've been program 
    manager for four years. There is not one shred of truth to that. I have 
    never heard,  felt, seen, smelled, tasted,  or used any other organs to 
    sense anything to that effect.' 

      Seemed  convincing  enough  to me.  But despite  all  the  breathless 
    denials,   SETI  remains a ripe target for conspiracy theorists  simply 
    because  many just don't trust the government to tell the word  if  and 
    when  the massive radio telescopes manage to pick up and verify and ETI 
    signal. To rectify this perception, NASA's SETI Institute called on the 
    International  Academy of Astronautics,  one of  several  international 
    space    organizations   composed   of   astronomers   and   scientific 
    professionals from around the world that had expressed support for  the 
    project, to define the specific terms of this theoretical announcement. 
    They put their heads together and came up with a singularly  remarkable 
    document. 

      It  is  called the Declaration of  Principles  Concerning  Activities 
    Following  the  Detection  of Extraterrestrial  Intelligence,   and  it 
    states,   in  brief,  that any verified ETI signal picked  out  of  the 
    heavens  by SETI/HRMS is the property of all the people of the  planet, 
    not just  the U.S. or NASA. In two pages of densely worded legalese, it 
    calls  for  the swift dissemination ('promptly, openly, and widely') of 
    the  discovery to the United Nations, various academic institutions and 
    scientific  channels,   and then to the world media.   'The  discoverer 
    should   have   the privilege of making the first public announcement,' 
    Article 4 of the declaration states. 
      
      'It's the ultimate freedom of information act,' Coulter says proudly. 

      But  the  declaration  doesn't make any provisions  for  a  potential 
    response to the signal,  except to say that no response should be  sent 
    'until appropriate international consultations have taken place.' This, 
    of course, would require another declaration. 

      Coulter  thinks  we may be getting a bit ahead of  things.   For  one 
    things,   he  says 'we do not presume that the  message  is  answerable 
    necessarily.' 

      Though  numerous forward-thinking astrophysicists such as Carl  Sagan 
    have speculated on coded beams of radio waves carrying the secrets of a 
    distant advanced technology through the stars for the benefit of  less-
    adept neighboring civilizations, the message may merely be 'Hello.' Or, 
    for that matter, 'Why did you cancel F Troop?' 

      Or  as  Coulter says,  it may be just like a lighthouse beacon.   'No 
    matter  how closely you analyze a lighthouse beacon,  you're not  gonna 
    get the Encyclopedia Britannica,'  he says. 'Besides,  those things are 
    so far off, it's not worth thinking about.' 

      And for those people working on the project,  the detection alone, of 
    anything, would be plenty earthshaking in itself. Occasionally, Coulter 
    gets  so  caught up in trying to define what SETI is and isn't that  he 
    loses the true magnitude of its stated goal. 'It's an attempt to answer 
    one of the most  profound  questions facing  the human race,'  he says, 
    sounding a bit  stunned  himself.  'It would be the most important non-
    religious event in the history of the world, I guess.' 

      At  this  point  even  the canniest of  NASA  project  managers  must 
    struggle with the poetry of the moment.  For some things there are  yet 
    no acronyms. 

      'Philosophically,  I  see old Mother Earth spinning around as she has 
    for millions of years,'  Coulter says slowly, silently constructing the 
    image  in his mind.  'And I almost see old Mother Earth pausing  for  a 
    moment. And when she spins again, everything will be different.' 

      Meanwhile,  back in Dundalk,  Steve Tobias keeps up his lonely vigil, 
    playing  old NASA footage over and over again on his beatup VCR,  which 
    keeps breaking down, in search of those elusive white specks. 

      'I'd  be  making a fool of myself if I was  pursuing  something  that 
    wasn't  provable,'  he says from beneath the brim of his  Maryland  Air 
    National Guard cap.  'I know that people with different forms of mental 
    delusions  or dementia will grasp onto things.  But that  doesn't  take 
    anything away from the phenomena.' 

      'This  is  a struggle between perceptions of what is and  what  could 
    be,' he says firmly. 'And I am going all the way.' 

      He  keeps  hearing rumors of mysterious 'government'  operatives  who 
    periodically  appear on the doorsteps of intrepid investigators such as 
    himself to silence them forever - the 'Men in Black,'  they are called. 
    Tobias  is ready for them,  whoever or whatever they are.  'No one  can 
    intimidate me,'  he says. 'If they showed up at my door,  they would be 
    apprehended. One of us would die.' 

      Until  then,  he will keep compiling his odd fragments of information 
    and scraps of evidence,  keep typing his densely worded,  single-spaced 
    CIPPAC  reports.   'Make copies,'  he writes on the back of one  in  an 
    urgent red pen. 'Spread the word!' 

      But  it's getting on toward evening now.  Tobias has  more  evidence. 
    More books.  A radio interview. A  sketch of a possible alien footprint 
    in his notebook. And, before I go, that passage from Virgil's "Aeneid." 
      
      A sudden crash of thunder, and a shooting star slid down. 

      The sky's dark face, drawing a trail of light behind it. 
      
      He  leaves me with a copy of his group's logo --  a  picture  of  the 
    Greek discus thrower hurling an outsized flying saucer - and its motto: 

    'Seek after the truth.' 

      'I  fear  Tomorrow these days,'  he writes in the first lines of  his 
    first  CIPPAC report.  'I fear for Your Tomorrows as well.  All of you, 
    Humanity.' 

      For  all his wild speculation and conspiracy bluster,  Tobias  really 
    means it. And if the world chooses not to stop to listen to his one-man 
    call to arms, it will not be for lack of his trying or for the weakness 
    of  his  convictions.   Right or wrong,  Steve  Tobias  has  discovered 
    something. 

      'I don't consider myself a social martyr,'  he says. 'I really wish I 
    had never found this out. I wish I could be like everyone else.'
