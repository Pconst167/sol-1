SUBJECT: RIDDLE OF THE MAN WITHOUT A HEART                   FILE: UFO2801

Amazed Paramedics couldn't find a heartbeat at first - and then they couldn't 
even find a heart in an accident victim!

They were even more spooked when the FBI poped in and imposed a curtain of 
silence over the peculiar discovery.

Now, an ambulance driver who asks to be known as "Mike" has lifted the lid on 
the bewildering events which followed a horrendous head-on crash on a southern 
California freeway.

Mutilated

"I think we were dealing with a creature from another world," says Mike, whose 
first impression when he got to the scene was that everyone in the twisted 
wreckage was dead - or should have been.

One man was still moving, but the paramedics couldn't find a pulse. They 
rushed him back to the hospital, where the mutilated victim was x-rayed. The 
two men in the other car were declared dead and taken to the morgue.

"The emergency room nurse said there was no heart," recalls Mike.

"We were thinking the machine had malfunctioned because the plates showed what 
looked like a plate of spaghetti with meatballs.

"Then suddenly there were these guys in suits standing in the doorways and we 
were told to get back to our stations."

Since then, Mike has gone back over every detail and compared notes with his 
tow partners that night.

"There was this black stuff all around," he recalls.

"I was thinking it was crankcase oil from the wrecked vehicles, but now I 
realize there was no blood. That stuff was his bodily fluids."

The paramedics also now know the "suits" who took control were FBI agents.

"They were so matter-of-fact," he says.

"It was like business as usual. I think they knew who he was, that maybe he 
was even co-operating with them on something."

A reporter discovered that all records of the accident were expunged.

The strange thing that has been giving Mike many sleepless night, however, is 
one glimpse of something he has trouble understanding. "The dying man was 
slipping away when I saw to my horror...he had no face, nothing," he recalls.

"There was just a vague emptiness. Then just as quickly the man's face was 
back, kind of grinning.

"It was as though he was enjoying the confusion he was creating among us 
earthlings. He could make us see what he wanted us to see.

"But the x-ray machine was a different story. That showed he was a man with no 
heart - at least not one that we could relate to."
