³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³The Decatur Daily                                           ³o³
³o³February 21, 1993                                           ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³ALBERTVILL- At least 12 animals have been mysteriously      ³o³
³o³killed and mutilated since October. Cattle farmers,         ³o³
³o³including Albertville chief detective Tony Cole, have       ³o³
³o³reported dead bloodless, mutilated animals - cows,          ³o³
³o³goats and at least one dog. The animals were found in       ³o³
³o³pastures with no traces of auto mobile tracks,              ³o³
³o³footprints or blood.                                        ³o³
³o³  "On Jan. 9, I went to feed my steers and realized I       ³o³
³o³was one short. The sexual organs and rectum was removed     ³o³
³o³and the biood was gone," Cole said.                         ³o³
³o³   His animal was killed amid his investigations into       ³o³
³o³the mysterious case.                                        ³o³
³o³  All of the killings, including the latest - a             ³o³
³o³calf found near Arab Tuesday morning - have formed a        ³o³
³o³three or four mile ring around Albertville.                 ³o³
³o³  "They take tongues, eyes, ears, hearts. Sometimes they    ³o³
³o³take the blood," Cole said. There are no suspects in        ³o³
³o³the case.                                                   ³o³
³o³  Cattle mutilations are not entirely uncommon in this      ³o³
³o³Sand Mountain area - and residents remember some from       ³o³
³o³1986, 1989 and 1991. One farmer said he was hit a few       ³o³
³o³years ago and then hit again a few mornings ago. Cattle     ³o³
³o³owners from Browns Valley and Brindlee Mountain have        ³o³
³o³reported similar mutilations.                               ³o³
³o³   Most of the animals are worth about $800                 ³o³
³o³and many of them are not insured, Cole said. The            ³o³
³o³killings are apparently happening at night. All of the      ³o³
³o³animals have been found within 150 feet of power lines.     ³o³
³o³Speculation about who could be doing the killing ranges     ³o³
³o³from aliens to satanic worshipers to people in              ³o³
³o³helicopters and on foot.                                    ³o³
³o³   Marshall County authorities are aware of                 ³o³
³o³two black county helicopters, one blue and                  ³o³
³o³white Tennessee Valley Authority chopper and several        ³o³
³o³military helicopters that fly through the area              ³o³
³o³following flight paths.                                     ³o³
³o³   "A TVA helicopter is not a possibility. I                ³o³
³o³don't think ther're involved at all. Absolutely not,"       ³o³
³o³Cole said.                                                  ³o³
³o³   Most of the decomposed cows are buried hours after       ³o³
³o³they are found but three were found in time to send         ³o³
³o³for autopsies.                                              ³o³
³o³   "It's crazy. It's sick,"  John Strawn said. The          ³o³
³o³cattlemen and finance manager at Gilbert and Baker Ford     ³o³
³o³Inc. lost one of his animals to the mysterious              ³o³
³o³murderers. He said a state animal laboratory could not      ³o³
³o³determine the cause of death. "No one knows what's          ³o³
³o³killing the animals," Cole said. He said he's formed a      ³o³
³o³network with victims of the crime. On Tuesday night,        ³o³
³o³several people called the sheriffs department to report     ³o³
³o³mysterious helicopters flying over pastures near            ³o³
³o³Albertville. The county pilot, Jim Pickett, said he and     ³o³
³o³night supervisor deputy Bob Norwood went up in the          ³o³
³o³county chopper to see if they could locate another          ³o³
³o³helicopter. Norwood said he had already been to the farm    ³o³
³o³and heard a helicopter with a turbine engine. He said       ³o³
³o³the Huntsville Aviation Tower could not detect movement     ³o³
³o³on their screens and was unaware of flight Plans for        ³o³
³o³that area that night. The The chopper was reported near     ³o³
³o³Martling. Pickett and Norwood went about 2,500 feet up      ³o³
³o³with running lights. They were communicating with           ³o³
³o³dispatchers and receiving reports for sighting of the       ³o³
³o³other helicopter, which they said they tried to follow      ³o³
³o³but never found.                                            ³o³
³o³     We kept getting reports of a helicopter flying at      ³o³
³o³tree-top level with "no lights," he said. The sheriffs      ³o³
³o³helicopter, which is black was not flying at tree-          ³o³
³o³top level and had lights on at all times.                   ³o³
³o³While searching for the second helicopter, shots were       ³o³
³o³fired from the ground at the sheriffs helicopter.           ³o³
³o³No one was hurt. Also, Norwood said a car signaled the      ³o³
³o³chopper by flashing lights off and on. The helicopter       ³o³
³o³flew close enough to the car to see that it was parked      ³o³
³o³under power lines.                                          ³o³
³o³   "People were trying to lure us into high tension         ³o³
³o³wires. I don't think it was purposely for us," he           ³o³
³o³said.                                                       ³o³
³o³   Both agreed they had low visibility and needed           ³o³
³o³more light then what they had to adequately see what        ³o³
³o³they were doing.                                            ³o³
³o³   We Would need infrared equipment if there was            ³o³
³o³another chopper," Norwood said. The pair didn't see         ³o³
³o³another helicopter but said it would have been              ³o³
³o³extremely difficult because of the darkness-and because     ³o³
³o³the alleged chopper was running without lights..            ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³   ALBERTVILLE- Doug Segers said he saw a helicopter        ³o³
³o³forcing his herd of 42 cattle into a corner in his          ³o³
³o³pasture. He said he felt the wind and heard the engine.     ³o³
³o³   "The copter was behind my back with a spotlight." Of     ³o³
³o³course, I had a 30-30 r@fle over my shoulder. They saw      ³o³
³o³me run to my truck " he said.                               ³o³
³o³   "The cows were scared to death. One cow is real gentle   ³o³
³o³and we couldn't even get around her."                       ³o³
³o³   A neighbor called the Marshall County Sheriff's          ³o³
³o³Department.  The excitement scared the helicopter away,     ³o³
³o³Segers said.  He said he saw what looked like red,          ³o³
³o³green, blue and white lights but couldn't make out the      ³o³
³o³color of the chopper.  He said he also saw the sheriffs     ³o³
³o³helicopter much higher.  The alleged mysterious             ³o³
³o³helicopter barely cleared power lines before getting        ³o³
³o³lower.                                                      ³o³
³o³   "I wasn't scared, I was mad.  They                       ³o³
³o³would have gotten (a cow) that night" he said,              ³o³
³o³"The farmers, all of us, are going to have to pull          ³o³
³o³together and help one another out and do what we can to     ³o³
³o³help."                                                      ³o³
³o³   Segers owns a slaughterhouse and said they kill          ³o³
³o³animals every day for people.                               ³o³
³o³   "I don't see how in the world can they do it this        ³o³
³o³way," he said.                                              ³o³
³o³   Some farmers are using spotlights and patrolling         ³o³
³o³their land, he said.                                        ³o³
³o³  The animals weigh about 1,000 pounds and hold about 40    ³o³
³o³pounds - or five gallons - of blood. Some residents say     ³o³
³o³helicopters make sense because it would give the killers    ³o³
³o³lifting abilities and would make it easier to take heavy    ³o³
³o³blood animal parts and cutting and pumping equipment        ³o³
³o³away from the scene.                                        ³o³
³o³  Resident and victim Jole Strawn said he has seen          ³o³
³o³helicopters land in cow pastures at night. He said he       ³o³
³o³has 30 head or about $12,000 in animals.                    ³o³
³o³  He organized a network of victims and farmers and said    ³o³
³o³the group has been able to identify three turbine           ³o³
³o³helicopters in the area:                                    ³o³
³o³> Light blue and white with a big orange sun;               ³o³
³o³> dark blue;                                                ³o³
³o³> black                                                     ³o³
³o³  "I think they're coming in from away from here," he       ³o³
³o³said.                                                       ³o³
³o³  He also said he spotted a helicopter flying about 75      ³o³
³o³feet above the Ford dealership in the fog.                  ³o³
³o³  "Some of this stuff is real bizarre," he said. Some of    ³o³
³o³the animals were found with no rigor mortis and with        ³o³
³o³limber joints.                                              ³o³
³o³  According to mortician, J. Hammond Martin, animals and    ³o³
³o³humans are not stiff right after death but become stiff     ³o³
³o³later and then begin detcriorating - once again without     ³o³
³o³stifftness.                                                 ³o³
³o³   Mr. and Mrs. James Denney lost two cows in 1991. They    ³o³
³o³said they believe satanic worshippers could be              ³o³
³o³responsible for the killing. The cows were worth about      ³o³
³o³$800 each  and not insured.                                 ³o³
³o³   "We bought them on a Wednesday, they were killed the     ³o³
³o³next Sunday," Mrs. Denney said. One of the animals was      ³o³
³o³still warm and the calf was not hurt.                       ³o³
³o³   The only known helicopters in Marshall County are the    ³o³
³o³two black county choppers, a blue and white Tennessee       ³o³
³o³Valley Authority helicopter and several helicopters         ³o³
³o³that fly military flights through the county.               ³o³
³o³   "I think whoever is doing this is doing it for a         ³o³
³o³party with mystique," deputy Bob Norwood said. He           ³o³
³o³doesn't think it would involve a true cult.  "The true      ³o³
³o³meaning of the word cult is hidden.  They don't want the    ³o³
³o³publicity.  It's their own little party."                   ³o³
³o³Dozens of residents have spotted helicopters from about     ³o³
³o³8 p.m. to midnight near pastures.                           ³o³
³o³  "They're going to protect their property," Norwood said   ³o³
³o³of the farmers. A lot of the farmers in the area also       ³o³
³o³are hunters and know how to use guns.                       ³o³
³o³   Marshall County Sheriffs department pilot Jim Pickett    ³o³
³o³said minimum cost for a manufactured helicopter is about    ³o³
³o³$175,000. He said night vision equipment and a turbine      ³o³
³o³engine would cost about $200,000 more. He also said it      ³o³
³o³could cost about $300 an hour to operate.                   ³o³
³o³   Pickett said it would be difflcult to determine          ³o³
³o³whether a helicopter had landed on hard, dry packed         ³o³
³o³land.                                                       ³o³
³o³It could be a helicopter pilot and two ground people.       ³o³
³o³The helicopter doesn't have to land," he said.              ³o³
³o³  "They want people to be scared of them," Norwood said.    ³o³
³o³  They said while the helicopter theory is possible, the    ³o³
³o³same thing could be done on foot - without all the          ³o³
³o³cost. Helicopters have the danger of night, the             ³o³
³o³possibility of air and noise scaring the cattle and huge    ³o³
³o³costs.                                                      ³o³
³o³  Martin, who has been a mortician since 1939, said there   ³o³
³o³is a wide technical range of equipment used to pump         ³o³
³o³blood out of human bodies. He said the equipment could      ³o³
³o³easily be used on cattle - and without leaving a trace      ³o³
³o³of blood on the ground.                                     ³o³
³o³   "We used to do it by hand, using a bowl and gravity.     ³o³
³o³Now it's a machine," he said. He said morticians often      ³o³
³o³use a fluid to push the blood out of a body but said the    ³o³
³o³cow killers wouldn't need to do that. He also said the      ³o³
³o³equipment could easily be carried.                          ³o³
³o³   "They could drain it and not leave a drop of blood,"     ³o³
³o³he said.                                                    ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
³o³                                                            ³o³
