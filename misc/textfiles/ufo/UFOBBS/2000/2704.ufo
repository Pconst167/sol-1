SUBJECT: THE HILL ABDUCTION CASE                             FILE: UFO2704


PART 3

    
 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      Mark  Steggert  of  the  Space Research Coordination  Center  at  the 
    University of Pittsburgh developed a computer program that he calls PAR 
    (for Perspective Alteration Routine)  that can duplicate the appearance 
    of star fields from various viewpoints in space. 
    
      "I was intrigued by the proposal put forth by Marjorie Fish that  she 
    had  interpreted a real star pattern for the alleged map of Betty Hill. 
    I  was  incredulous that models could be used to  do  an  astronometric 
    problem,"  Steggert says. "To my surprise I found that the pattern that 
    I  derived from my program had a close correspondence to the data  from 
    Marjorie Fish." 
    
      After several run-throughs,  he confirmed the positions determined by 
    Marjorie Fish.  "I was able to locate potential areas of error,  but no 
    real errors," Steggert concludes. 
    
      Steggert  zeroed in on possibly the only real bone of contention that 
    anyone has had with Marjorie Fish's interpretation: The data on some of 
    the  stars  may  not  be  accurate enough for  us  to  make  definitive 
    conclusions.   For  example,   he says the data  from  the  Smithsonian 
    Astrophysical  Observatory  Catalog,   the Royal  Astronomical  Society 
    Observatory  Catalog,   and  the  Yale Catalog of  Bright  Stars  "have 
    differences  of  up  to  two magnitudes  and  differences  in  distance 
    amounting to 40 percent for the star Gliese 59".  Other stars have less 
    variations  in  the data from one catalog to another,   but  Steggert's 
    point  is valid.  The data on some of the stars in the map is just  not 
    good enough to make a definitive statement. (The fact that measurements 
    of  most  of the stars in question can only be made at  the  relatively 
    poor  equipped southern hemisphere observatories accounts for the  less 
    reliable data.) 
    
      Using  information on the same 15  stars from the  Royal  Observatory 
    catalog  (Annals #5),  Steggert reports that the pattern does come  out 
    differently  because of the different data,  and Gliese 59   shows  the 
    largest variation.  The Gliese catalog uses photometric,  trigonometric 
    and  spectroscopic  parallaxes and derives a mean from all three  after 
    giving  various  mathematical weights to each value.  "The  substantial 
    variation in catalog material is something that must be overcome," says 
    Steggert.   "This must be the next step in attempting to  evaluate  the 
    map." 
    
      This point of view is shared by Jeffrey L.  Kretsch, an undergraduate 
    student  who  is  working under the advisement of J.   Allen  Hynek  at 
    Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Like Steggert, he too checked 
    Marjorie  Fish's  pattern and found no error in the work.  But  Kretsch 
    reports  that  when he reconstructed the  pattern  using  trigonometric 
    distance  measurements instead of the composite measures in the  Gliese 
    catalog,  he found enough variations to move Gliese 95  above the  line 
    between Gliese 86 and Tau 1 Eridani. 
    
      "The data for some of the stars seems to be very reliable,  but a few 
    of the pattern stars are not well observed and data on them is somewhat 
    conflicting,"   says  Kretsch.  The fact that the pattern is less of  a 
    "good  fit"  using data from other sources leads Kretsch and others  to 
    wonder what new observations would do. Would they give a closer fit? Or 
    would  the  pattern become distorted?  Marjorie Fish was aware  of  the 
    catalog  variations,   but has assumed the Gliese catalog is  the  most 
    reliable source material to utilize. 
    
      Is  the Gliese catalog the best available data source.  According  to 
    several  astronomers who specialize in stellar positions,  it  probably 
    is. Peter Van de Kamp says, "It's first rate. There is none better." He 
    says  the  catalog was compiled with extensive research and  care  over 
    many years. 
    
      A  lot of the published trigonometric parallaxes on the stars  beyond 
    30 light-years are not as accurate as they could be,  according to Kyle 
    Cudworth  of  Yerkes  Observatory.  "Gliese  added  other  criteria  to 
    compensate and lessen the possible errors," he says. 
    
      The scientific director of the U.S.  Naval Observatory, K.A.  Strand, 
    is  among  the world's foremost authorities on  stellar  distances  for 
    nearby stars.  He believes the Gliese catalog "is the most complete and 
    comprehensive source available." 
    
      Frank  B.  Salisbury of the University of Utah has also examined  the 
    Hill and Fish maps.  "The pattern of stars discovered by Marjorie  Fish 
    fits  the  map drawn by Betty Hill remarkably well.   It's  a  striking 
    coincidence and forces one to take the Hill story more seriously,"   he 
    says. Salisbury is one of the few scientists who has spent some time on 
    the  UFO  problem and has written a book and several  articles  on  the 
    subject.  A  professor of plant physiology,  his biology expertise  has 
    been  turned  to  astronomy  on several occasions  while  studying  the 
    possibility of biological organisms existing on Mars. 
    
      Salisbury  insists  that  while  psychological  factors  do  play  an 
    important role in UFO phenomena,  the Hill story does represent one  of 
    the most credible reports of incredible events. The fact that the story 
    and  the  map  came to light under hypnosis is good  evidence  that  it 
    actually took place. "But it is not unequivocal evidence," he cautions. 
    
      Elaborating  on  this aspect of the incident,  Mark  Steggert  offers 
    this:   "I  am  inclined  to question  the  ability  of  Betty,   under 
    posthypnotic suggestion,  to duplicate the pattern two years after  she 
    saw it.  She noted no grid lines on the pattern for reference.  Someone 
    should  (or  perhaps  has already)  conduct a test to see  how  well  a 
    similar  patter could be recalled after a substantial period  of  time. 
    The stress she was under at the time is another unknown factor." 
    
      "The  derivation of the base data by hypnotic techniques  is  perhaps 
    not  as 'far out'  as it may seem,"  says Stanton  Friedman.   "Several 
    police  departments around the country use hypnosis on rape victims  in 
    order to get descriptions of the assailants --  descriptions that would 
    otherwise  remain repressed.  The trauma of such circumstances must  be 
    comparable in some ways to the Hill incident." 
    
      Is it at all possible we are faced with a hoax? 
    
      "Highly  unlikely,"   says Salisbury --  and the other  investigators 
    agree. One significant fact against a charade is that the data from the 
    Gliese catalog was not published until 1969,  five years after the star 
    map was drawn by Betty Hill.  Prior to 1969,  the data could only  have 
    been  obtained  from  the  observatories  conducting  research  on  the 
    specific stars in question.  It is not uncommon for astronomers not  to 
    divulge  their research data --  even to their colleagues --  before it 
    appears in print.  In general,  the entire sequence of events just does 
    not smell of falsification. Coincidence, possibly; hoax, improbable. 
    
      Where does all this leave us? Are there creatures inhabiting a planet 
    of  Zeta 2 Reticuli?  Did they visit Earth in 1961?  The map  indicates 
    that the sun has been "visited occasionally". What does that mean? Will 
    further  study  and measurement of the stars in the  map  change  their 
    relative positions and thus distort the configuration beyond the limits 
    of coincidence? 
    
      The  fact that the entire incident hinges on a map drawn  under  less 
    than  normal  circumstances  certainly  keeps us from  drawing  a  firm 
    conclusion.   Exobiologists are united in their opinion that the chance 
    of  us having neighbors so similar to us,  apparently located so close, 
    is vanishingly small. But then, we don't even know for certain if there 
    is  anybody at all out there --  anywhere --  despite the Hill map  and 
    pronouncements of the most respected scientists. 
    
      The only answer is to continue the search. Someday, perhaps soon,  we 
    will know.

    All   the   stars  listed here are main sequence or  spectral  group  V 
    stars.     Tau  Ceti   has   a slight peculiarity in  its  spectrum  as     
    explained in the  text.   W-velocity  is the star's motion in km/sec in 
    a direction above or below  (-)   in the  galactic  plane.  Total space 
    velocity  relative  to  the  sun is also in km/sec.  Data is  from  the 
    Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars (1969 edition).
