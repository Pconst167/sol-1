Flagstaff, Ariz. - A team of experts called in to examine strange debris at 
the bottom of the Grand Canyon discovered the wreckage of a UFO that crashed a 
mind boggling 4,000 years ago!

The scientists, members of a highly secret joint military task force on UFOs, 
inspected the spherical craft and found it to be in good condition despite its 
rough landing and incredible age.

The relic is made of an unknown metallic substance and emits low levels of 
radiation, according to leaks from highly placed sources. It was immediately 
removed from the site and is now in a secret location.

My contacts tell me this craft is definitely of extraterrestrial origin and 
without a doubt carried a crew of 12 to 20 individuals, said Dr. Henry 
Leaumont, a California based astronomer who contacted this reporter after he 
was shown secret air Force documents relating to the find.

Carbon dating shows it crash landed at the base of the canyon around 2,000 
B.C.

Cabin features suggest that the crew members were much like humans, although 
significantly smaller. They apparently breathed oxygen, guided their atom 
powered craft with a magnetic steering system and carried supplies of food and 
water on board.

According to reports filed by the scientific team, the spacecraft was lodged 
in limestone rubble at the base of the canyon not far from an area called 
Comanche Point.

Athorough inspection of the landing site revealed that the spacecraft's 
occupants left their ship and lived near it for a number of years after it 
crashed.

The finding proves the existence of a space alien colony on this planet nearly 
3,500 years before Columbus!

This impression is confirmed by Indian cave paintings made at the time, the 
Air Force secret documents attest. The paintings, found near the crash site, 
show strange humanoid creatures with bulbous heads. Experts believe these 
creatures were the same aliens who arrived in the ancient UFO.

The secret report said all traces of alien occupation disappeared within 50 
years or so of the crash date. There is no indication of what might have 
happened to the extraterrestrials, the documents reveal.

The ship is made of an extremely light metallic fiber, Dr. Leaumont said.

It measurers about 50 feet across at its widest point and it is 102 feet long. 
It's an incredible find - the latest in a series of artifacts collected 
secretly and hidden away in government UFO study centers.

There's a lot of official concern about keeping this latest discovery a 
secret. They've been covering up the truth about alien contacts for 50 years 
and they're not going to stop now. They want to study this thing, but they 
want it only for themselves.

Who knows what scientists might learn if they'd share this priceless find with 
the rest of the world?
