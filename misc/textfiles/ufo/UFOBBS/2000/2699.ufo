    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    
    To a 5-year-old kid from Indianapolis, the mountains and mesas and vast 
    scrubland surrounding Albuquerque seemed an alien world. 
    
    "I  was in awe"  recalls Gerald Anderson of his arrival in  New  Mexico 
    with his family in July 1947.  "I was in the wild frontier.  There were 
    real, live Indians out there." 
    
    Then says Anderson,  on his second day in the Southwest he bumped  into 
    real,live creatures from a truly alien world. 
    
    There were four --  two dead,  on dying, one apparently uninjured.  The 
    creatures  were about 4 feet tall,  with heads disproportionately large 
    for  their bodies by human measure and almond-shaped,  coal black eyes. 
    They  huddled in the shadow of 50-ft-diameter silver disk -  a  "flying 
    saucer"  that had crashed into a low hillside on the rim of what locals 
    call the Plains of San Agustin. 
    
    Anderson,   a  former police chief at Rockaway Beach and  Taney  County 
    deputy sheriff who now works as a security officer in Springfield,   is 
    adamant about events on the hot midsummer day so long ago. "I saw them. 
    I even touched one of the creatures. I put my hand on their ship. And I 
    wasn't alone - my dad,  my uncle,  my brother and my cousin all saw the 
    same things. And so did a lot of other people. But they aren't talking. 
    
    Anderson is talking, pubicly, after 43 years of silence. 
    
    Among   those  listening  most  intently  are  some  of  the   foremost 
    researchers  into  unidentified  flying object (UFO  phenomena.   These 
    experts  say  Gerald  Anderson appears to be an  important  link  in  a 
    frustratingly fragmented chain of evidence concerning the most famous - 
    or infamous - chapter in UFO annals: the so called "Roswell Incident." 
    
    No  one denies that "something"  happened in July 1947  in central  New 
    Mexico, cradle of U.S. nuclear and rocket technology. However, military 
    authorities  insist  reports  of strange craft in the  sky  and  bizare 
    wreckage  on  the ground were traced at the time to an  errant  weather 
    balloon and other manmade or natural circumstance. 
    
    Nonetheless,   over  the years,  persistent whispered rumors grew  into 
    published  articles and books,  even movies,  which fanned  speculation 
    that what actually occured was a visit by creatures from another planet 
    - an intergalactic expedition that turned to tragedy on the high desert 
    and  then  into a massive coverup in the highest circles  of  the  U.S. 
    government. 
    
    Anderson  says  he was unaware of ongoing fascination  and  controversy 
    over the strange episode from his childhood until one evening this past 
    January when he was flipping through channels on his television set and 
    stumbled across the popular program "Unsolved Mysteries." 
    
    "I  wasn't looking for any unsolved mysteries - I have enough mysteries 
    in  my life that are unsolved,  and I don't need any  more,"   Anderson 
    jokes.  He is a burly,  barrel-chested man standing 6-4  and carrying a 
    muscular  250-plus  pounds,   with reddish hair and a  rudy  complexion 
    creased from easy laughter. 
    
    "But,  bingo! On comes this story, and everything was wrong,"  Anderson 
    recalls  of  the TV show.  On sudden impulse,  he dialed an 800   phone 
    number that flashed onto the screen.  "I guess I figured that if people 
    were  still  interested  in  this thing,  they might  as  well  get  it 
    straight"   is the only explanation he can muster for speaking up after 
    years of keeping mostly mum on the matter. 
    
    "These people don't know what they're talking about," Anderson told the 
    operator on the other end of the long-distance line.  "The shape of the 
    craft is totally wrong. 'And how do you know that, sir?" she asked. ' I 
    saw it,  I  was there,'  I told her. "Whoa!"  she said.  "Thee are some 
    people who will want to talk to you...'" 
    
    Anderson's  phone  soon  was ringing with calls  from  UFO  researchers 
    around  the country.  One in particular,  Stanton Friedman,  a  nuclear 
    physicist and popular lecturer who had advised the "Unsolved Mysteries" 
    producers,  was struck by correlations between Anderson's recollections 
    and obscure details Friedman uncovered while sleuthing for a book to be 
    published next year. 
    
    Friedman, who lives in Canada, contacted John Carpenter, a  Springfield 
    professional  therapist  who in his spare time serves as a director  of 
    investigations  for  the  local  chapter  of  Mutual  UFO  Network,   a 
    nationwide  orgainization  of UFO researchers.  At Friedman's  request, 
    Carpenter   conducted  extensive  in  person  interviews  of  Anderson, 
    including sessions under hypnosis. 
    
    The  results  excited Friedman.  "Powerful stuff!"  he  exclaimed  upon 
    hearing interview tapes. Friedman arranged airline tickets for Anderson 
    and Carpent to join him in New Mexico to pinpoint the crash site. 
    
    Anderson  says  the flight was his first return to New Mexico  in  more 
    than  a  quarter-century.   After  poining the  pilot  of  a  chartered 
    helicopter  to  a  spot  in  the desert  75   air  miles  southwest  of 
    Albuquerque,   Anderson gazed at a hillside,  strewn with boulders  the 
    size of Volkswagens and dotted with a few gnarled pinion trees, that he 
    says he saw in the summer of 1947..... A NEW HOME 
    
    The  Anderson  family arrived in Albuquerque from Indiana  on  July  4, 
    1947.  they took up temporary residence at the home of one of  Gerald's 
    uncles, Guy Anderson. Gerald's father, Glen, was about to take a job as 
    a  master  machinist involved in nuclear weapons design at  the  super-
    secret Sandia base on the outskirts of town. 
    
    The  next  day,   another uncle,  Ted,  struck up a  conversation  with 
    Gerald's  older  brother  Glen Jr.,  who was on leave from  the  Marine 
    Corps.   Glen  Jr.   was a rockhound,  and his uncle piqued  the  young 
    Marine's  enthusiasm with talkes of gorgeous stones just waiting to  be 
    collected in the desert. 
    
     "  Ted told my brother, ' I  know where there's plenty of moss agate.' 
    So  we all piked into a 1940  Plymouth - Uncle Ted,  my  cousin  Victor 
    (Ted's 8 year old son),  my brother,  Glen, my dad and myself.  We went 
    out  into this area where the moss agate was supposed to be -  followed 
    two  ruts into the desert,  bounced along out there for a  while,   and 
    ended up on top of a ridgeline.  We parked the car and started to  walk 
    down  an arroyo (gully)  and dry creek bed and out onto the plains.   A 
    STRANGE DISCOVERY 
    
    "But  we came around a corner and right there in front of us stuck into 
    the  side  of this hill,  was a silver disc.  There were  some  remarks 
    like"There's  a crash up here!  Somthing's crashed up here!   And  then 
    someone saying 'That's a goddam spaceship!" 
    
    "We all went up there to it.  There were three creatures, three bodies, 
    lying  on  the ground underneath this thing in the shade.  Two  weren't 
    moving  and the third one obviously was having trouble breathing,  like 
    when you have broken ribs.  There was a fourth one next to it,  sitting 
    there  on  the  ground.  There wasn't a thing wrong with  it,   and  it 
    apparently had been giving first aid to the others. 
    
    Anderson  animatedly acts out the fourth creature's reaction  when  the 
    family  members approached.  "It recoiled in fear,  like it thought  we 
    were  going to attack it,"  anderson recounts,  covering his face  with 
    crossed  arms.  The adults tried to repeatedly to communicate with  the 
    frightened creature,  Anderson says,  but there was no audible response 
    to greetings spoken in English and Spanish. 
    
    A few minutes after the Anderson clan happened upon the bizarre  scene, 
    six  other  people arrived - five college students and  their  teacher. 
    They'd  been  working on an archeological dig around cliff dwellings  a 
    few  miles  away and had decided to hike over after  seeing  what  they 
    thought was a firey meteor crashing the night before.  The professor, a 
    Dr.  Buskirk,  tried several foreign languages in unsuccessful attempts 
    to coax a verbal response from the creature, Anderson says. 
    
    The sun had climbed to a midday peak by this time and recalls anderson, 
    "to  a  kid from Indiana,  it was hot brother,  let me tell  you."   He 
    chugged  a chocolate flavored soft drink an hour earlier and the  sweet 
    soda  pop  was  churning uncomfortably in his stomach.   so  he  sought 
    shelter in the shadow of the spacecraft. 
    
    "It was 115  (degrees)  out there that day. But around the craft,  when 
    you got close to it,  it was cold. When you touched the metal,  it felt 
    just like it came out of a freezer." 
    
    SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT 
    
    Anderson  also  touched one of the creatures lying  motionless  on  the 
    ground - and it,  too was cold. In his child's mind, he had thought the 
    figures looked like dolls.  But when he felt the colk skin,  "  I  knew 
    something wasn't quite right. Yuck!. 
    
    Anderson  says he ran to the crest of a nearby knoll to take stock.   A 
    pickup  truck  arrived  on the ridge,  and a  fellow  whom  researchers 
    believe  was a civil engineer named Barney Barnett joined  the  curious 
    audience.   "I remember thinking he looked like Harry Truman.  In 1947, 
    every kid knew what Harry Truman looked like," Anderson says. 
    
    After a few minutes,  Anderson summoned the courage to agin creep close 
    to  the strange saucer.  It was then more chilling than the surface  of 
    the  craft of the skin of the corpse;  The upright creature turned  and 
    looked right at me and it was like he was inside my head - as if he was 
    doing my thinking, as if his thoughts were in my head." 
    
    Anderson remembers a mental sensation of falling and tumbling end-over-
    end.   "I  felt  that thing's fear,  felt  its  depression,   felt  its 
    loneliness.  I  relived the crash.  I  know the terror it went through. 
    That one look told me everything that quickly,"  he says with a snap of 
    his fingers. 
    
    Other things began happening quickly about this time, Anderson says.  A 
    contingent of armed soldiers suddenly appeared. The creature, which had 
    calmed down after its initial fright, "went crazy"  at the sight of the 
    soldiers.   Thinking back on the creature's plight today brings on  the 
    "awfulest, horrible feeling," Anderson says. 
    
    "His  situation was hopeless.  He knew it.  He'd just lived  through  a 
    nightmare  that  most of us wouldn't be able to psychologically  stand. 
    He'd watched two of his crew, his friends or maybe even his family die. 
    He's  watching another one die.  He knows there's no chance of  rescue, 
    because the military is here and his people aren't going to be able  to 
    get him. 
    
    "God only knows how far away from home he was, and he knew he was never 
    going  to see - if they have loved ones - his loved ones again.  He was 
    totally  alone  on  a hostile planet,  and the only  people  who  where 
    showing  him  kindness  were being run off by the military  at  weapon-
    point. 
    
    "As a kid, I was aware of what being afriad of the dark was like.,  and 
    the feeling I got from him was that feeling multiplied a million times. 
    It was scary. It was terrifying. 
    
    SOLDIERS ON THE SCENE 
    
    Anderson  says  he lost sight of the creature as the  soldiers  swarmed 
    over  the  site.  The civilians were brusquely shoved from  the  craft. 
    Anderson remembers shouts and threats.  His uncle Ted threw a punch  at 
    one  of the GIs.  "Things got very tense,  very dangerious,"   Anderson 
    says. "The soldiers ushered us out of there very unceremoniously. Their 
    attitude, to describe it at best, was uncivilized." 
    
    Anderson  has an especially vivid memory of a tough-talking red  haired 
    Army captain and an equally gruff black sergeant. "They told my dad and 
    my uncle, who also worked at Sandia,  that if they were ever to divulge 
    anything  about this - it was a secret military aircraft,  they said  - 
    then  us  kids would be taken away and they'd never see us again."   It 
    seems an outrageious threat in hindsight, Anderson concedes. But at the 
    time,   he reminds,  "These people had machine guns and you listened to 
    what they said." 
    
    Another recollection strikes Anderson as odd today: The soldiers didn't 
    appear surprised about the otherwordly craft and creatures. they didn't 
    gawk,   slack-jawed  and  awestruck as the Andersons  had  done.   "The 
    soldiers weren't saying, 'Gee, look at that!"  They were very cognizant 
    of what they were looking at. They knew what it was. 
    
    And it soon became apparent,  Anderson says, that the Army knew what it 
    wanted to do with the find. "there was a battalion of military, a  real 
    invasion force,  when we got back up on the hilltop.  Thee were trucks, 
    there  wre  airplanes  -  they had the road blocked off  and  they  wre 
    landing on it.  They had radio communications gear set up.  There  were 
    ambulances, and more soldiers with weapons." 
    
    In  the days that followed,  all of New Mexico was abuzz with  talk  of 
    strange  lights in the sky,  strange echos on radar,  strange doings in 
    the desert. On July 7,  new reports told of remnants of an unidentified 
    aircraft  found by a rancher near the town of Roswell,  N.M.  about 150 
    miles  east  of  the hillside where the Anderson's  stumbled  upon  the 
    saucer. 
    
    Although  several witnesses said it was like nothing they'd  ever  seen 
    before,   military officers insisted the metallic pieces came  from  an 
    ordinary weather balloon..... 
    
    A WEATHER BALLOON? 
    
    Forty  three years later,  Anderson smiles wryly when reminded  of  the 
    Army's pronouncement,  "A lot of people wondered why,  if it was just a 
    weather balloon, the military put the pieces under armed guard and flew 
    them  in  a  B-29  to Wright Patterson Air Force  Base  in  Ohio,"   he 
    observes. 
    
    Anderson  believes  the wreckage scattered near Roswell and the  barely 
    damaged saucer on the Plains of San Agustin are connected. "There was a 
    gash in the side of the disc we saw,  like it had been crushed in,"  he 
    says.   "The contour of the craft would fit into that gash perfectly  - 
    like another one of these things had hit it. I think two of these discs 
    had a mid-air collision.  One exploded and feel in pieces near Roswell, 
    and the other crash-landed where we found it. 
    
    With all evidence confiscated and the military steadfastly sticking  by 
    the  weather  balloon explanation,  the story faded from  the  news  by 
    July's  end.  And Gerald Anderson says he tucked away the memory as  he 
    grew  into  manhood.   "I learned you just don't go up to  the  average 
    person on the street and say, "Damn, know what I saw?" The guy will go, 
    "Get  away from me,  fool!  Are you crazy?"  In later life,  he  didn't 
    mention it even to his wife until a few years after their marriage. 
    
    Anderson  joined the Navy in the late 1950s and served a dozen years in 
    posts around the globe.  He lived for a few years in Colorado,  working 
    as  a parmedic and working toward a college degree in microbiology.  In 
    1979,  he moved to Missouri to better raise his daughter away from what 
    he  terms  the "druggy"  atmosphere of Denver.  In addition to his  law 
    enforcement  posts,   Anderson  has worked for two  southwest  Missouri 
    trucking firms as a driver and instructor. 
    
    Anderson also has been active in the Episcopal Church.  He recently was 
    elected  to  the  vestry at Ascension Episcopal in Springfield  and  is 
    studying  toward becoming a deacon.A gold crucifix - a  cross  complete 
    with  a figure of the martyred Christ affixed to it - suspended from  a 
    chain around Anderson's neck is testimony to his faith. 
    
    NO CONFLICT IN BELIEFS 
    
    Although  he  concedes his account might make some  fellow  churchgoers 
    uncomfortable,  Anderson sees no conflict between what he saw with  his 
    eyes and what he believes in his heart:  "When you're talking about the 
    concept  of God,  you have to be talking in the context of a  universal 
    situations,  a  deity that built the whole universe.  And why should we 
    assume  that this speck of sand in the backwater of space would be  the 
    only place that an all-perfect, almighty God could create life?" 
    
    In  fact,  Anderson says he "wouldn't be one bit surprised to find  out 
    that,  wherever this creature came from,  there they have a very strong 
    concept  of a supreme being.  Because of my contact with  the  creature 
    showed   a  high  degree  of  civilized  sophistication,    gentleness, 
    compassion - all of the things we hold as ideals." 
    
    Of the five anderson men who ventured into the desert that day in 1947, 
    only  Gerald is still alive.  Age,  illness and accidents  claimed  the 
    other four in recent years.  But not only andersons were at the  scene, 
    Gerald says,  and he hopes his decision to come forth,  albeit belated, 
    will  encourage  others  to  tell  what they  know  and  spur  official 
    revelations about the captured craft and creatures. 
    
    "I want to see the government stand up and say, 'Look,  we're not alone 
    in the universe. 
    
    Let's  make  a 'Star Trek'  really happen.  Let's do go out  there  and 
    explore  the universe.  That may be our only salvation.   Because  with 
    what's  doing to this Earth,  we're not going to make it much past  the 
    year 2000.
