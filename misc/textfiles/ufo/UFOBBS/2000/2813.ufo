    I also grew up in Florida and have been to the Coral Castle many times...the
gates are constructed from old ford truck axles and the gates were hung and
THEN balanced with a chisel made of a leaf spring.
    The huge slabs of coral were split from the rockbed with ford leaf springs
also and the ground is still exposed and shows the marks of the tools. He used
a tripod/lever assembly similar to an egyptian design to hoist the slabs to
their present position. The lunar/planetary symbols atop the walls had some
signifigance to the builder and are apparantly to be viewed from an elevated
rock chair set into the center of the garden.

Dan,

	Now that I know what your talking about, it appears that yes, to a certa
in
degree something like what you described is common to many of the UFO Experience
s
that have been recorded. The most well known being that of Betty and Barney
Hill. If you are familiar with their story, they were apparently paralised when
the UFO interupted their journey. You will also note that in many cases the
victims cannot move until such time as the aliens either tell them to move or
somehow control their movement.

	I would be most interested in hearing more about your experience when
you were six years of age. Most abduction/contact cases it seems appear to begin
when the victim is of a very young age. If you wish to keep this slightly more
private, I invite you to call the UFINET BBS and talk to me there.

Kind regards,
Bill English

The Mantell case was one of the cases that APRO (Aerial Phenomenon Research
Organization) had originally investigated. I have copies of the original investi
gation
reports along with the offical publicity reports concerning Mantell's crash.

According to what I have here, a UFO was sighted on radar and several planes
were scrambled to investigate, among them Captain Mantell. Mantell apparently
chased the UFO successfully to a point and at the same time climbed almost to
his aircrafts limit. According the the APRO report Mantell radioed that he was
at the limit and was about to break off the chase when it was later reported
by the other pilots that a beam of some type came from the UFO and grabbed his
aircraft pulling it along at incrediable speeds. The other aricraft lost sight
of it, however radar was able to track it for a while longer. Radio contact
was apparently lost the moment the beam struck. AT this point the report becomes
a little cloudy. Mantell's aircraft and his body were found shortly thereafter,
but there is no indication from the APRO report nor from the offical Air Force
release indicating that the wreakage was radio active.

I don't seem to be able to find this one in the files, however there are several
similar reports of this nature. Among them are several reports from the White
Sand Missle Test Range here in New Mexico for that time period which tell of
several missles and of chase aircraft that were taken aboard UFOs while in fligh
t
and never seen again. One witness to such an accurance was my father, who was
among the elctronic tracking crew at White Sand at the time.

Hope this answers some of your questions.

Curtis, no this isn't true. I have known John personally for quite sometime,

add at this point also that John's material is John's research and work, and
not the work of others. I might also add that John most diffinently is not out

  Ok, That's what I was wondering about.

  I've heard of them, but I haven't ready their story. I saw a 'debunker'

than that, I'm not familiar with them.

  At the onset of this last episode, I tried to fight against the akinesia
(paralysis) and was becomming successful in my attempt, but as soon as I
started making headway, it was like another wave of it hit me but this

  Maybe I should type up something and send it your way. I'm feeling more at

  Uh... Can you say that fast, three times? <Grin>...

  Well, I'm getting confused here! hehe... Let me try to explain it again.
Hopefully I'll do a better job than last time!

  I was laying across the bed at a minimal angle, about half way down the
bed. My head slightly toward the upper right side of the bed, feet toward
the lower right. (Laying with the left side of my head on the bed, facing
the headboard which is against the wall.)

  From that position, with my left eye, I could see the headboard, and half
of the wall to the right of the bed where my robe generally hangs. with the
right eye I could see a bit more since the bed isn't obstructing my view.
The right eye has better periphery vision due to my position. I wouldn't be
able to see the left side of the bed, since that would be the area behind
my head and out of my view.

  From the area behind my head, at the ledt side of the bed, is where I could
see something moving with my periphery vision.  I have good periphery vision
as far as the angle of sight, but not in clearity, so I could not
make out a distinct form. I could, however, sense/feel movement, behind me
in much the same way that people are sensitive to heat, air movement, and awaren
ess
of a presence, but not by the actual hard sight of something.

>
> How similar?  How many times?

  Similar in all points except the eye part, and being in a different position
in the bed. On rare occassions, I find myself in a different place on the bed,
but very seldom.  As far as how mant times, well, this has been a regular thing
since I was six years old. (about 29 years.) Up till about six months ago, this
was a monthly episode, and now an then, it would shift to weekly for a month,
then go back to monthly.

> One ear or both ears?  Would you attribute this to temporarily heightened

> you to be more likely?

  Both ears... I would say that it is probably due to an increase of adrenal
secretion causing a temporary rise in BP... I'm not a medical doctor, so my
guess is only a guess.

> Smell anything during or shortly after this happenned?

  Not that I remember this time. I have smelled kind of a wet paper smell crosse
d
with a "hemp rope" type of smell during similar episodes. I was more caught
up in the "eyes" thing than in smelling...

> Did you notice your own shadow on the bed?  Assuming there's a small

  No shadow that I could notice. The room was evenly lit in all directions.
My head was about two to two and a half feet from the headboard, so I might
not have seen a shadow if there was one...

  Heat? Yeah, but not hot heat... just the type of heat exchange you might expec
t
if someone was near you.

> Are you sure your left eye was really opened?

  Yup. I switched back and forth from left to right a few times. My left eye
was open, and the room was bright.

> What happenned after?

  After the episode with my eyes? or the entire thing... After the thing with
my eyes, I noticed something was movig behind me, and I stopped using my eyes,
shut them and stayed motionless. After that, I don't know what happened until
I apparently woke up with the "Hemispherical perception" thing on my mind, while
i was telling myself that I "hadn't been dreaming."

> How did you feel physically?

  As best as I can remember, sore and awake.  Like someone had been hitting
me with a two-by-four, but it went away rather quickly.

> What did you do afterwards?

  I got up, turned on all of the lights in the house, sat in the front room
with a blanket over me and waited until I got the nerve to go back to bed!

  See above... <Grin>... I have no regular schedule anymore. I generally
stay awake until I can't stay awake.  Now and then when I don't feel
watched, and I get into a realitivly normal sleeping schedule.

feature & games.

The New Age board has message bases for dreams, astrology, runes/tarot, parapsyc
hology,
mainstream religion, general new age, and my board (which is called Heaven's
Records).  I also have 2 text files in the SHELF, which is located in the new

     Yeah, we do to.  That's why I asked, because some of the boards only carry
the UFO echo and you may even be getting the stuff from here from somebody else

Hi Tessa, my feelings exactly! Why limit the UFO experience when it is so multi-
faceted?
I know from personal experience that some of these beings are from "other planes
"
of existance. I guess it's hard enough for some people to swallow the fact that
there are UFO's at all, not to mention UFO's from outside of our physical univer
se.
I think Jym will let us know if we stray too far away from topic. I think he
would rather see discussions on the other planes taken to the meta echos unless
it has a direct link to the UFO experience. I just don't know how to avoid cross
ing
the line here.

The circles are points where a form of energy is being transferred from this
reality to another (more advanced) one. They cannot resist a clean, blank slate
any more than we can and have been using the whorls to create more and more
elaborate heiroglyphs. At least one of those depicts the relationship between
earth and heaven and God. The energy is called Forfe and is created unknowingly
by humans, just as bees produce honey. It is the energy food of the Gods....and
spirits.

A science fiction writer once told me that he was contacted once by the

him. They said if he'd write it, they'd find someone who'd swear to

It has been. In fact there ARE several blood substitutes on the
market (chloroflourocarbons, for example) but they all have shortcomings
of one kind or another (there was an article in either Science News or
Scientific American on the subject a year or two back). Obviously, a
substitute derived from real mammalian blood is a logical direction
for research to take.-Wm

Well, these aren't forces, but they can shut down a car yet leave it
apparently unharmed and startable after a few minutes.

Vapor lock. As the engine cools, the fuel vapor will condense and allow
the car to start. In this case, the starter will still work.

Battery damage. There are several places in the batter/electrical
system where a temporary loose connection can occur. Like vapor lock,
this can be temperature related and self correcting.

Voltage regulator. An electromechanical voltage regulator can have a
sticky contact plate. Repeated attempts at starting might jog it loose.

Starter solenoid and relay. This would allow headlights, etc. to work,
but would keep the car from starting.

Fuel pump. Can cause surging and eventual stopping. After several
minutes the car can restart and act as if nothing is wrong (for
awhile). This one actually happened to me on I-10 in west Texas one
night - the pump finally failed over 1000 miles later.

More mundane than UFOs, but you've got to rule these and a few others
out first.-Wm

The more you describe this, the more familiar it sounds. Beaucoup de
deja vu! The light was even as though the room were lit by lots of
flourescent tubes, right? (The brain as image processor, eh? :-)

One of the strangest versions of this that I had was lying in bed
watching the ceiling of my room open up to reveal a huge, cavernous
space filled with H.R. Geiger-style machines. The blend of reality
and dream was flawless - I could see the hinges on the ceiling
sections.

The prettiest version was "waking" up to see a fairy-like creature
sitting on the edge of my reading lamp - lovely butterfly-style
wings. As I came more awake, she faded out smoothely. Cute! :-)

There were several others over a period of a couple of years, but
not recently. BTW, I tend to dream vividly with solid plots and
characterizations, I don't know if that has any bearing on it -
do you have vivid dreams?-Wm

  Don't know about that one. Here's a similar incident.
  Sometime in late 1989 (I think), literally thousands of people saw a huge
triangular ufo cross the island of Puerto Rico. At some point, a large number
of people saw two F-14s orbiting the object.
  The F-14s, one by one, flew inside and never came back out.
  Jorge Martin will be speaking about that incident at the MUFON Symposium in
Chicago. I've never seen the story published.

  You got it. A wing is more stealthy than conventional design, but the real

  I vaguely recall Carter saying that he'd release info, but he didn't make

it.
  The MUFON investigation conclusion was that Carter and the others had been
watching Venus.

   A few books. The UFO Casebook, by Kevin Randle, will give you a good overview
..
Clear Intent, by Fawcett and Greenwood, on purported government coverups. Intrud
ers,
by Budd Hopkins, on the abduction phenomenon. Confrontations, by Jacques Vallee,
for the...opinion from left field, but makes about as much sense than anything
else.
  The Gulf Breeze Sightings, by Ed and Frances Walters, is the current bone
of contention for argumentive types.   Those will get you started.
  Periodicals I'd suggest are the MUFON Journal and UFO Magazine. Don't waste
your money on UFO Universe.

  This sounds like it's connected to the "meteor" sightings. I saw a quoted

hovering over NYC, and LIUFON has a report of a similar incident on Long Island.

But herein lies one very tremendous problem:  The imagery.  Why are there no
Ewoks, Storm-troopers, E.T.s, Klingons, Yodas, and the other thousands of
prevelent alien archetypes?  Why no cute, friendly beings as depicted in
_Close Encounters_?  Where are the lightsabers, X-Wing fighers, Enterprises,
laser guns, and so many of the other heavily reinforced images?  If the
unconcious mind were to concoct some fantastic episode of alien abduction to
bring feelings of specialness or to "justify an irrational stress response",
surely the doctrines of _Star Trek_ would hold more ground than the
relatively unknown images of floating through windows, sterile white rooms,
strange tables, exacting medical proceedures, bizarre (and often repeated)
instruments, little gray men, and so on.  The arguement "but there have been
so many books, and television programs about abductions" could be offered,
but judging from my own conversations with friends and aquaintances, I doubt
the average person knows much, if anything, about the experience, and
certainly not the finer aspects.

 SE>However, in the context of abduction experiences, there is no proven,

There was surely a great ammount of stress for the Hills, being part of an
interracial marriage back in that period of time.  But to rely solely upon
internally-generated theory is to ignore the physical elements involved in
the Hill abduction claim (spots on the car, stopped watches, etc.).

Dr. Simon's opinion likely reflected a conservative view, for I doubt that a
psychiatrist who valued his reputation and career would advocate the
abduction of humans by extraterrestial entities based upon the meager amount
of information available at that time.  He would have been laughed right out
into the street by his peers.  And as you must know, psychology is home to
numerous differing theories and stances, so the opinion of one individual
cannot totally refute (or substantiate for that matter) the validity of the
Hill's claims.

My attempt to illustrate an external stimulus-fear response was rather poor,
I concede, however, you should understand the idea I suggest.  A clearer
example might be this:  On several occasions in my youth, about age five or
six, I witnessed (or at least *thought* I witnessed) a small, semicircular,
red colored object eminating from the window sill in my bedroom at night, and
I can guarantee you that the resulting fear had nothing whatsoever to do with
thrill-seeking, nor any internal stresses, nor needs of any kind.

Should we assume then, given an apparently normal, well adjusted person
claiming such an experience, that there is nothing to worry about; nothing
which warrants investigation or further scrutiny beyond simply saying
"imaginary experience" and moving right along?

The scars to which I refer are anything but ambiguous, and are, quite to the
contrary, of very precise design.  One of the more common--a round scoop-like
mark appearing on the thigh or calf--seems, to me, more than coincidental
when found so often upon abduction claimants.  So far as "in the abscence of
other convincing evidence," I disagree wholeheartedly, and would refer you to
_Missing Time_, _Intruders_, _The Octover Scenario_, _Confrontations_, etc.
for further assistance.

As a joke the producer of the film said, in a promotional "behind the scenes

because it was too dangerous. I saw the promo and said to my wife at the time
that his demeanor was such that people were going to take him seriously. IT

If your refering to the honeycomb construction then your correct, however as
far as I know there still wasn't any real research with regard to bringing it
all together. Of course you may be right and I might not have been paying attent
ion.
But then I thought perhaps I was...unless of course I was in the bathroom during
that particular class...<grin>

I'll give credit where it is due. Especially if someone did a good job. As for

Yes there is a hard copy of Bill's speech at the 89 MUFON conference and I happe
n
to have one here. Unfortunately it is copyrighted material and I cannot place
it on the system for download. I would suggest that you contact Bill at his
office in LA and order one. I'll have to dig into my files and get the address
for you, but I will post it.

I don't know if there is still a copy of the tape available. All of the APRO
files were placed in storage when Coral Lorenzen passed away and as I understand
it they suffered a great deal of damage. The International Center for UFO Studie
s
in Scottdale, Az has managed to get those files and have been in the process
of restoring what they can for public access. I'll try and find their address
and number for you and post that also.

Lynn, we have a problem here.  I HAVE NOT called your BBS. If someone has logged
onto your system using my name I would suggest that you dump them immediately,
or at least question them as to their identity. It may be that they have the
same first and last name as I do. If they state that they are me then they are
lying. Once we get this little matter starightened out I will be most happy
to call your system. You of course are always welcome here at UFINET News BBS.

Yes I do have a complete files listing, freq the file "ALLFILES.BBS"

Kind regards,

If you did that you would have to run around with one set of
magnets on a seperate board for the other board to oppose.   The
thing Brown was doing is different.   Just read the book you'll
enjoy it.  ...LGM

  What you saw was QuickEd, by Dror Tirosh. It's the fullscreen editor I was
referring to. F3 turns on and off the quote window, enter quotes a line, and
Ctrl-Z saves the message.
  The other is the common line editor, in which you work line by line.
  You must be able to use ANSI.SYS and have graphics turned on at the bbs end
in order to use QuickEd. If you could use it once, you have it all set up at
your end.

Hi Bill,

the radio station WWCR post that I put on here several days ago,
 subject: Interesting.
    I didn't receive a message from you so I'll have to assume that

Subj: Philly Experiment                                                (64/100)

Hi! Ok--I have copies of my dads Seamans papers here in fromt of me...
I cant find any reference to Lipshiz(sp?) but I remember him mentioning
that--now I think that they were a supplier of food/supplies that they
dealt with--it been a lot of years.I have a paprer here from the US
Coast Guard--Dated Jul 30 1945 and he did graduate at Sheepshead Bay,
NY. And another letter from the LUCKENBACH STEAMSHIP COMPANY,
LUCKENBACH LINES, Foot of 35th Street, Brooklyn 32, NY, from the SS
HENRY D. THOREAU. Here is the text: To Whom It may Concern: William
Pietschman has served aboard this vessel from the 29th of January.
While this vessel was in route from Genoa to the United States, Mr.
Pietschman suffered a spinal attack, which was a recurrence of a
previous injury. From March 25th to March 31st he was unable to leave
his bed due to complete numbness in his lower limbs.
				   Yours truly,
				   Roger Brach, Purser
				   SS Henry D. Thoreau
He was discharged 11 April 1946 at Charleston, South Carolina, abter
being released from active duty on 8 Sept 1945 from USMSGS, New York.
He never had any "lower limb" problems that I ever saw, and I feel
somewhat qualified to comment on this, you see, he was a Doctor, and I
am a Registered Nurse. I any case, his injury(?) seems strange to me.
.... Thanks so much for your reply, and if anyone out there can find
and Merchant Marine info, please send it to this echo. There are fewer
and fewer of thse veterans left, and someone might talk about the
Philadelphia Experiment before their story dies with them...I wonder if
the experiments continued at all...don't you?

Hi, Chuck.  I thought your Close Encounter was really interesting, & I appreciat
e
how hard it is to write a public message about something like that.  I have
a few questions & would like to talk about it some more with you.

How old was your friend's little brother when this happened?

 > We got his little brother into the habbit of shining it at

 >

Is it possible that he attracted the UFO by shining the flashlight in the sky?

You know, I've read about people who have reported UFO's that "appeared to be
helicopters".  I wonder if you & your friends have had a "cover-up memory" of
watching a police helicopter, when you have actually been watching a UFO.

The other thing that curious about your story, that leads me to believe that
there is a missing time gap & that possibly you, your friend & his parents were
not able to act during that time gap is "why didn't the child's parents hear
his screams sooner & come out of the house before the UFO left?"

I suggest that it's possible that you & friend believe you could not open the
door, when what may have happened is that you were frozen & unable to move durin
g
that time, and maybe the UFO abducted the child.
How much
time would you estimate elapsed from beginning to end of te else's story.

   During October, 1973,  I saw about 25 UFO's in the Houston, Tx area.  They
were paying a lot of attention to the oil refineries in the eastern part of
the metroplex.  All of this was observed from a high rise dormitory at the Unive
rsity
of Houston.  Did anyone else have a similar experience that month?  This was
the month that the Yom Kippur war started in the Middle East.

  I read a book a couple of years ago written by a fellow by the name of Davidov
its.
Apparantly, he is an engineer who designed a method of casting fabricated stone.
He claims to be able to create any stone out of its elements. He calls this
process geopolymerization. He claims that this method is the one used by the
Egyptians to build the Pryamid at Gaza.
  I found his book extremely convincing but I was informed by another gentleman
via a message that Davidovits' theory was full of wholes. This gentleman said
that he was in a position to know but he did not elaborate.
  I mention this book and its author because he claims that the monuments at
Coral Castle were created via the same method that he has pioneered.
ALthough I received a dissenting opinion, I would recommend that you give the
book a read for yourself (If you can find it.). It was very well written and
did not seem like a book written by some kook. He seemed to have good answers
for all his critics and his theory does well in explaining the various problems
inherent in the building of large structures like the pryamids.
  Take care.

Some accounts of the Philadelphia Experiment mention the sighting of aliens
by crew members during the experiment, which seems to have involved
magnetic pulses.

Several years ago, there were a few reports about a helmet that pulsed
magnetic waves through the temporal lobes.  This device was intended to ind

This may be the same device discussed in the December 1988 OMNI, in

Ball lightening, corona discharge, what?  Your message is difficult to
understand.  Anyway, there is quite some difference between an ambiguous
light seen in the distance, and a structured craft with lights, windows,
whatever, seen at close proximity.  Certainly you do not mean to suggest that
"car stopping," in the UFO context, is purely coincidental?

Statistically, hoaxes do not represent the majority of UFO sightings--that
destincition belongs to misinterpretation of astronomical or conventional
objects, and the like.  The exact figures from the Air Force's Project Blue
Book study, as recorded in _The Hynek UFO Report_, were:  Astronomical:
26.0%; Aircraft: 17.0%; Hoaxes: 0.9%; Psychological: 0.5%.  This is only a
partial list, but serves its purpose nonetheless.  You will also note that of
some 12,618 sightings recorded by Blue Book, a mere 116 were identified as
hoaxes.  Even the 701 listed as "unknown" far outnumber those listed as
fraudulent.  Hardly a convincing case for the "made up" theory.

Hi Ben.  Your 101% correct with me.  Humor manifests itself in different ways
and is a nervous release at times.   The intent of my message was to propose
some type of often seen 'rules of the echo' to let new people know (and remind
the veterans) what to expect and what is expected of them when interacting with
the echo participants.  I'm sure I am not the first to suggest this, I don't
like to see people ridiculed for no reason.

 BC> I have had my experiences.  I don't relate it to anyone, because of
 BC> the "beyond belief" syndrome.  But, I do love a good natured spoof

Ben, you surely know this is a 'beyond belief' area.  We attempt to make sense
of all the nonsense.  That just isn't possible sometimes.  The trouble is one
doesn't always know where the nonsense ends and the sense starts.  I think that
is why a degree of respect is needed, especially to inform the new participant.
 To let them know that even if their sighting sounds like a lot of nonsense,
there is a place to attempt explanation.

 BC> now and then.  I guess that might be the question, if it is good
 BC> natured, or not.

I respect and understand your viewpoint. I agree that jokes are occasionally
needed for uplifting the monotony of seriousness here, if they are good natured
and most importantly, don't offend a participant _personally_.  I simply dislike
watching certain people (_most often new_) jump into a new or old message and
make 'wisecracks' at someones claimed experiences.  I don't see how that is
conductive to productive discussion.  My main concern is for those new individua
ls
who have been sent the questionable message, and might not view it as funny.
 Instead of relating their experience (or whatever it is), they might decide
to 'tune out' the echo and not return.  As it is said, "first impressions are
lasting impressions".  Ridicule is fine in my view, _if_ it is deserved.  Perhap
s,
just leaving the decision to the receiver of the message is more appropriate,
or ignoring it until it ceases.  I absolutely am not trying to be a 'topic cop',
I don't have the expertise or patience necessary.  I do tend to get a bit defens
ive
at times, as you and others have witnessed.  It _is_ done with a well intended
purpose and encourage anyone here to present differing opinions.

 BC> I wouldn't make an all out rule on laughter, just because a few are
 BC> too serious for thier health.  Why censor ... like the government
 BC> seems to do relating to UFO's?

No way!!  I don't want to see a ban on laughter, I need all the laughter I can
get. I believe in free information flow and don't want to see that flow obstruct
ed
in unnecessary ways.  I appreciate your response and for stating your views.
 I strongly believe that the echo is important for others, and 'hackers' like
me, with a serious interest in the phenomena.  I feel that next to paying the
big boys of electronic storage and transfer $6.00+ an hour for discussion forums
and e-mail, this is a unique medium and needs to exist. BTW, I did laugh at
the 'gas station' joke, really!

I am anticipatory of your description of "a different picture", if you can,
of "_this_" case and why I am jumping to conclusions.  Cases _have_ been misinte

in the past.  Researchers are human and subject to error.  Let's scrutinize
the information case by case, separately from the others.  'Night Siege' _is_
an informative book (and recommended). Ex-skeptic-government UFO researcher,
the late Hynek was even involved.

The research did produce witnesses, whose stories are in books/articles about
the incident.  Some of the witnesses preferred, at their request, to remain
anonymous as to their true identity for personal reasons.  As I stated before,
anyone with a serious interest in locating the witnesses should do so through
the investigators of the original research.  I do not have personally researched
information on this topic.
