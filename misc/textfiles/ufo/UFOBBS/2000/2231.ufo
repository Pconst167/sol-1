     Bert    | <Dialing Ed Walters>
     Drax    | (Its me Jim Speiser)
     Jerry Woody: Hi Drax and everyone
     Ted     | Hi James!
     Sysop Georgia Griff: ha
     Drax    | (Well some people dont know my handle)
     Bert    | All set to go here. I have Ed on the line. ga

     Ted     | Tonights special guest is Mr. Ed Walters, the original
             | photographer of the Gulf Breeze UFO and co author (with
             | his wife Francis) of the book "The Gulf Breeze Sightings."  ...
             | Ed, are there any recent sighting that you would like to
             | tell us about or any opening remarks that you would like
             | to make? ga
     Ed Walters: The sighting activity has continued very strongly. I can only
             | comment on the events that I witnessed even though the
             | investigators are flooded with many others. Along with
             | these continued sightings by groups of people with video
             | cameras and 35 mm cameras we have a hightened debunking
             | effort. The 1990 symposium is 3 weeks away and it seems
             | to have Phil Klass and his friends scared. The latest
             | effort to debunk me is a planted model made from materials
             | from my garbage. ga
     Ted     | Care to enlighten us about that? ga
     Ed Walters: The model does not resemble the photographs that I have
             | taken in color or details. It only has the general shape
             | which is too flat and skinny, even though it was a very
             | clever model and I am impressed with the debunking efforts. ga
     Ted     | Any idea how "they" gained access to your garage ga
     STEVE PETERSON: WHO PRESENTED THE MODEL? GA
     Ed Walters: I moved out of the house in question a year and a half
             | ago and the house was on the open market .. open every day
             | and very accessable for 10 months before it sold. But are
             | we to believe that I am stupid enough to move and vacate
             | everything from that old house except for a ufo model? ga
     Ted     | Just a reminder, this is a formal Conference. If you have a
             | question or comment please signify with a "?" or "!"
             | I will open the floor to questions in a few minutes.
             | I am a bit confused.  Did they find a model in your old home...
             | or did they find a materials that a model was built from?
     Ed Walters: The person who made the model is unknown and used material
             | from my discarded garbage and then when the house was
             | vacant some time during those 10 months placed the model
             | at the top of the pull-down stairs in the attic. ga
     Ted     | Time to open the floor to questions. GA
     Drax    | ?
     Ted     | Ok, GA Drax
     STEVE PETERSON: ?
     Drax    | Ed, assuming that the motive was to show the world what a
             | hoaxer you are and damage your credibility, why would they
             | wait so long to plant the model? Why wouldn't they time it
             | to coincide with the release of your book, or beforehand,
             | when you were doing publicity campaigns for the book? GA
     Ed Walters: If I am correct, the time of planting would be while the
             | house was vacant. Otherwise it would be very difficult to
             | do and the debunking campaign has really been contiunous
             | also involving the Smith hoax photo evidence i.e. Chrysler
             | Bldg. UFO. ga
     Ted     | Ok, any follow DRAX? ga
     marge Christensen: !
     Drax    | No, GA
     Ted     | Ok, ga Steve
     marge Christensen: SORRY I GOT DISCONECTED BEFORE, HI EVERYONE
     Ted     | Ga Steve
     STEVE PETERSON: ARE THERE PHOTOS OF THE POWER RING NOT FACING THE
             | CAMERA? GA
     Mike    | ?
     Ed Walters: Assuming you are talking about photos that I have taken
             | there are some that show the craft in more of a profile but...
             | I always tried to hit the shutter as the craft tilted
             | forward making it brighter. ga
     Ted     | GA Marge
     marge Christensen: Did I miss something or was there a comment about a
             | blueprint of yours being found inside the model?  Can you
             | comment?
     Ed Walters: The model was made of discarded material, styrofoam
             | plates, drafting paper, old blue print planned paper all
             | glued together with a hole in the bottom to insert a
             | lightbulb. ga
     Mike    | ?
     Drax    | ?
     Ted     | GA Mike
     Mike    | I arrived late so excuse me if this question has already
             | been answered. Who found the model and was its existence
             | made known to the media? ga
     Ed Walters: The present owner of the house went up into his attic
             | where there's a large storage area and found it several
             | weeks ago. The interesting part of this is that 4 days ago
             | a news reporter came up to the door and asked if he had
             | found any models. It seems to me like the debunker was
             | tired of waiting for the model to be found and therefore
             | called in a tip to a newspaper reporter. ga
     Drax    | ?
     Ted     | GA DRAX
     Drax    | This is second hand, but I understand you told someone else
             | a slightly different story, namely that you had built the
             | model at the behest of Dr. Maccabee for re-enactments and
             | measurements? Any truth to this? GA
     Ed Walters: I have built scores of re-enactment "models". All of
             | them made from very rudamentary material. I never used
             | styrofoam plates as this debunker model is made of. Mine
             | were lampshades and cardboard boxes so that Maccabee could
             | study size and distance calculations. ga
     Drax    | But did you tell anyone that this was a re-enactment model? GA
     Ed Walters: The re-enactment models that I built were specifically
             | requested by the researchers such as Maccabee and Nathans.
             | The re-enactments were usually also video taped showing
             | the activity of the investigators. ga
     Ted     | I think Jim (Drax) was trying to find out if you told anyone
             | that the the discovered model was one of those commisioned..
             | by Maccabee? ga
     Drax    | That's what I was after.
     Ed Walters: When I saw the debunker model for the first time
             | yesterday, I said immediately I have no idea and no
             | information as to where it came from. And I certainly did
             | not build it. ga
     Ted     | Ok, I know I had a lot of ?'s lined up before this bombshell ..
             | was dropped.  Somehow the timing seems, how do I say...
             | Convieeeennnnient. (With apologies to Dana Carvey) So with
             | that in mind, I'd like to ask a ? on a different subject.
             | Can you tell us a bit about your abduction experiences? ga
     marge Christensen: ?
 Ed Walters: I have no concious recall of the hour and 15 min. of missing
             | time on May 1, 1988. The hypnosis by Dr. Overlaid revealed
             | many troubling events if we can trust the hypnosis. The
             | reason I believe something happened of a physical nature
             | during the missing time is I was left with bruises and
             | abrasions on my temples, between my eyes,
             | and on the back of my head. ga
     Ted     | Can you tell us a bit about what your hypnotic regression
             | revealed? ga
     Ed Walters: I have been asked that question many times and
             | I still have no specific memory that would mean I was
             | in a ufo. I could have been in a building someplace. I did
             | not see any controls nor was I given a guided tour. I was
             | held in a small room. ga
     Ted     | What happened in that small room? ga
     Ed Walters: It's very difficult for me to make sense of those events
             | I would rather believe, even though I can't, that it was
             | all a dream. ga
     Ted     | Ok, Marge is next. ga
     marge Christensen: Did the request for a pardon coincide with the
             | publication of your book?
             | The reason I ask is that you mention owning firearms in the
             | book at a time when you were not permitted to own them as a
             | convicted felon.
     Ted     | Seems like a "loaded" question. (Pun Intended) GA Ed
     marge Christensen: A copy of your pardon is circulating in case you are
             | not aware of that.
     Ed Walters: When I told the MUFON investigator about two and a half
             |  years ago about my police record I had no idea Phil and
             | the debunkers would try to throw it in my face. After all
             | I was only an 18 year old kid. When it became clear that
             | my police record was going to be an issue. I applied for a
             | pardon in September of 1989. After a 6 month investigation
             | into my background and character, the govenor signed
             | my pardon. The guns that you refer to belong to my wife.
             | The shotgun was always unloaded in transport. ga
     STEVE PETERSON: ?
     Scott Blight: ?
     Ted     | GA Steve
     STEVE PETERSON: WAS THERE ANY SENSATION OF TEMPERATURE OR PRESSURE
             | WHILE IN THE BLUE BEAM?  GA
     Ted     | GA Ed
     Ed Walters: The blue beam feels as if you are encased in hardened
             | concrete. It does not squeeze. It only stops your
             | movement. I didn't notice any heat change. But my mind
             | was on other things. ga
     Ted     | Ok, GA Scott
     marge Christensen: !
     Scott Blight: Ed. Do you have any childhood memories of missing time
             | and/or unaccounted for scars or wounds.ga
     marge Christensen: Sorry, have to leave now.  Supper's getting cold. Bye!
     Ed Walters: Under hypnosis, Dr. Overlaid recovered missing time events
             | at ages 11, 17, 25, and 33. No wounds or scars. ga
     Scott Blight: What year would you have been 11.ga
     Ed Walters: it would have been 1957. I'm 43 now. ga
     Kay     | ?
     Ted     | Ed, Do you have any idea what the "Other's" motivation
             | might be? ga
     Ed Walters: I was never given any message or had "conversations". I
             | believe that the aliens are persuing their own motives.
             | But many many people who write me letters feel like the
             | entities are benevelent. ga
     Ted     | Ok, Kay is next GA Kay
     Kay     | One of the things that has puzzled me for awhile about this
             | case is the fact that there are soooo many military bases
             | in the area Navy, Air Force. How often if ever, do the
             | military take notice of the goings on in Gulf Breeze, it
             | seems to me that they would be very concerned
             | about such happenings. GA
    Ed Walters:The military aircraft consistently show up at the sighting
             | locations moments after the ufo disappears. They deny the
             | following day that there was any ufo or any aircraft in
             | the area even though many scores of us have stood and
             | watched and video taped these sightings of the aircraft. ga
     Terry   | ?
     Scott Blight: ?
     Ted     | Ga Terry
     STEVE PETERSON: ?
     Terry   | On our trip to Gulf Breeze we've noticed as we pass through
             | Tyndall Field on U.S. 98 that there is some kind of drone
             | research facility there. Is it possible that some
             | sightings are connected with that
             | and has anyone to your knowledge looked into that ? ga
     Ed Walters: I'm not familiar with Tyndall. It's a long way from us -- in
             | Panama City. ga
     Ted     | Ga Scott
     Scott Blight: Ed. If you are 43 now then I guess you were born in
             | 1947...Interesting. How that year keeps coming up....anyway...
             | I just bought your book yesterday and haven't finished it yet...
             | Was the any results from the analysis of the bubbling liquid.ga
     Ed Walters: The analysis shows up at the end of the soil analysis
             | (in the book).It's not labelled well. Hard to tell when
             | the reports go from the soil to the liquid. ga
     Mike    | ?
     Ted     | GA Steve
     STEVE PETERSON: OK...
             | DID THE POWER RING ACT AS A JET NOZZLE
             | POINTING OPPOSITE OF DIRECTION OF TRAVEL? GA
     CosmicThAng: ?!
     Ed Walters: The video tape shows the ufo traveling to the left and
             | slightly tilted with the power source facing direction of
             | travel. ga
     Ted     | GA Mike
     Mike    | When was the last time you experienced the "humming"
             | and do you have any updates on the
             | significance of "Zehaas"? ga
     Ed Walters: The last humming was a slight hum on May 1, 1988. Your
             | guess is as good as mine as to what Zehaas means. ga
     Ted     | GA CosmicThAng
     CosmicThAng: Sorry I'm over an hour late.
             | Comment:  I appreciate your segregating the reports of
             | conscious memory from any hypnotic recall.  I appreciate
             | that as a hypnotic subject.
             | Question:  Tell me if this has already been answered, but
             | have you been regressed, what came out under hypnosis, and
             | what is your opinion of the validity or reliability of
             | hypnosis recall any thoughts on how to separate truth
             | from potential fantasy?
     Ed Walters: It's easier for me to believe that it's a dream because I
             | don't like to believe otherwise. But the physical bruising
             | makes me understand that something happened that I am
             | still trying to understand.
     Ted     | DON, what questions does "UFO Magazine" have for Ed? ga DON
     STEVE PETERSON: ?
     Ted     | I guess DON is gone. One last ? and Ed has to leave GA Steve
     STEVE PETERSON: OK...
             | ARE THERE ANY UPDATES ON THE PHOTO ANALYSIS SINCE THE BOOK...GA
     Ed Walters: Morrow and Co. hired an independent analysis prior to the
             | publication handled by Dr. Ebert, who concluded that he
             | personally could not believe in space travellers but could
             | find no evidence of photographic trickery. The sightings
             | continue and Dr. Maccabee has dozens of other photographs
             | and video tapes from Gulf Breeze witnesses. My mind is
             | open to many different theories and I look forward to
             | meeting and sharing at the 1990 MUFON symposium. Thank
             | you very much. Good night. ga
     Ted     | I want to thank ED Walters for his time this evening and
             | especially Bert.  Not only for Bert's time but also for his
             | dual telephones.  Bert has been connected to not only CIS
             | for this CO but also long distance from Michigan to Florida
             | and has been relaying Mr. Walters ? and ! via land line!
             | That is well above the call of duty. Heart felt thanks to
             | Bert.
     Steve R | Thanks
     Terry   | Thank you Ed.
     Kay     | Thank You for your time Mr. Walters
     CosmicThAng: Thanks a lot Ed, though I don't know how you answered my
             | question
     Mike    | Thanks much to Ed and Bert...and Ted.
     Kay     | Good Job Bert!
     CosmicThAng: ?
     Terry   | Yes, thanks, Bert.
     Bert    | Night guys. It was real interesting. ga
