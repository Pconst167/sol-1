                      MOORE IS LESS                               
                  OR IS LESS... MOORE? 
                 by  William S. English
================================================================= 
    First of all, before I begin, I would like to state that this
year's MUFONs conference was, to say the least, one for the 
record books. And I was honored to be asked to speak at the 
non-conference part of the conference. I had waited ten years for
the opportunity to be able to speak at such a gathering. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to give the speech that I had planned
to give due to the machinations of Mr. William Moore.  Not with-
standing my own personal prejudices (for which I make no
apologies) it would seem that Mr. Moore has finally out done 
himself in the area of dirty tricks and low blows. That is to 
say, Moore sure did piss off a lot of people at this one.      
For those of you who were unable to attend this years Conference
and Symposium I will more or less try to cover the highlights of
Bill Moore's saturday night speech as accurately as possible.    
 
   Aside from the fact that Moore attacked several members of the
UFO Investigative community, among them Linda Moulton-Howe. And 
beside the fact that he over ran his allotted time by better than
an hour, causing the cancelation of the panel that was scheduled
to take place after his speech. He skated around the question and
answer period that was also scheduled, by stating that there 
would be such a period, however, he would ask the questions, and
then provide the answers....you figure it out. 
 
      During the course of his speech, however, he put the icing
on the cake in such a manner as to cause me personally to throw 
out the speech that I had initially written in order to respond 
to Moore's blatant lies. 
 
       Moore basically stated that he was in fact working for the
government as a dis-information agent. IT'S TRUE!!! In point of 
fact, it was during this particular part of his diatribe that he
admitted as to having taken part in the discrediting and eventual
involuntary committal of Paul Bennewitz to the New Mexico State 
Mental Hospital. 
 
      *(As a side note, I also have it on good authority that 
Moore was also instrumental, along with Corral Lorenzen, in the 
arrest and conviction of Wendelle Stevens on trumped up charges 
of child molestation. If ever there was a martyr to the 
cause....) 
      Moore continued with his speech by stating that he felt 
that the information that was released by his two buzzards, 
Falcon and Condor, was information that the government allowed 
them to state, and that in point of fact Moore felt that he was 
being used by the government. 
 
      At this point there are a number of issues that must be 
clarified in order to give you the reader the opportunity to form
your own opinions about what I am about to state.
      During the later part of October of 1988, very shortly
after my re-emergence into the public eye...It was reported to me
that Moore had spoken to two engineers from Aerojet Corporation. 
Moore told them that I had admitted to him that I, and Gerry
Schultz, were taking LSD when we initially wrote my report on
Blue Book Report #13. I did in fact confirm this fact with one of
the engineers while at the MUFONs conference this year in 'Vegas. 
 
     In point of fact this is a blatant lie, and I go on public 
record that no such admission ever took place. Additionally, I 
never wrote a report concerning Blue Book #13 with Gerry Schultz.
Whatever material that is out there is the work of Gerry Schultz
and not myself. The only authorized information that I have 
released is that which is published in Bill Steinman's book "UFO
CRASH AT AZTEC" and even then, the supposed hand written notes 
that are credited to me are in facts the notes that Schultz made
while talking to me at the APRO Offices in Tucson. I will state 
that the notes are accurate, but they were not written by me.    
With regard to Moore's comments about Falcon and Condor, Moore 
failed to make mention of the fact that all the while he was 
calling me a drug addict, his two birds were parroting everything
that I had told Moore during the later part of 1978. Allen Benz,
then chief librarian for APRO, had arranged for me to meet with 
Moore shortly after his arrival in Arizona. It was at this 
meeting I repeated everything for him that I had initially told 
Allen Benz, Stanton Friedman, and Jim Lorenzen at the APRO 
Offices in July of 1977, shortly after my return from Security 
Services Command, at RAF Chicksands, England. If you the reader 
would care to contact Mr. Allen Benz at the FOUNDATION FOR UFO 
RESEARCH to confirm this....do so. Don't just take my word for 
it. 
 
      Moore's statements concerning Paul Bennewitz require 
comment at this point. Moore stated that he was in constant 
contact with Bennewitz since the later part of 1979 shortly after
his arrival in Arizona. And that he was in fact passing 
information received from Bennewitz to government agents. His 
explanation was "because Bennewitz had inadvertently begun to 
pick-up top secret radio transmissions from the government on his
home computer".  HORSE SHIT!!!! 
  
      I haven't quite figured out what Moore hoped to accomplish
by making this statement, but it is absolute, utter crap! In 
point of fact I was viewing the original reports Bennewitz was 
filing almost a full year before Moore ever entered the scene. 
Additionally I would point out that as recently as six weeks 
prior to the writing of this, New Mexico State Police Officer, 
Gabe Valdez, stated to researchers of the Southwestern UFO 
Research Organization that with the possible exception of the 
exact location of the Dulce sight, everything that Bennewitz had
said was true. 
 
      I doubt seriously that a person that is in the position of
Gabe Valdez, is going to jeopardize his job by lying about 
something as touchy as this.  WHAT WAS HIS REASONING BY MAKING 
THESE STATEMENTS? 
 
IN CLOSING: 
 
      It has become apparent to many in the UFO Investigative 
fields that Moore's credibility has suffered greatly. My own 
personal opinion is that Moore has effectively removed himself 
from active investigations, and that anything that he might 
release in the future will be looked upon with a great deal of 
malice...you form your own opinions.
