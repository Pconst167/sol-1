SUBTLETIES OF THE TELEVISION TALK SHOW, PART I

In DR #10, we reviewed the major news media--print, radio and 
television--and showed how each could twist reality in their own 
special way.  Strictly for the sake of science, Psychospy allowed 
himself to be turned into a minor media celebrity so we could 
report to our readers the sometimes dubious processes behind the 
scenes.  There was a limit, however, to how low we would sink in 
the pursuit of knowledge.  We would not take off our clothes for 
the camera, and we would not place ourselves in any situation 
where our credibility, reputation or dignity could be seriously 
trashed. 

Now we can report that this barrier has been broken.  In the next 
two issues of the Rat we will recount our first-hand experiences 
with the lowest form of mass media, the television talk show.

 ..... THE MEDIUM OF TALK .....

Talk shows come in three basic formats.  The rarest but most 
respectable is the SERIOUS ISSUES talk show exemplified by "Meet 
the Press," "Nightline" and the roundtable discussions on PBS--
maybe even "Larry King Live."  They are dignified and serious, 
explore meaningful political and societal issues, and hardly 
anyone watches them.

The next rung down the ladder--vapid but benign--is the CELEBRITY 
CHAT talk show, like the "The Tonight Show," "Late Show with David 
Letterman" and "Arsenio Hall."  Movie stars and Big Money authors 
pump their latest work in a non-confrontational environment 
designed only to promote laughs.

The last and lowest form of the genre is the HUMAN CONFLICT talk 
show.  These syndicated programs always bear the name of the host, 
like  "Oprah," "Geraldo," "Vicky" or "Leeza."  He or she is a 
charismatic and camera-loving character, no doubt ruthless in real 
life, but blessed with the ability to convey warmth and sincerity 
on TV.  The fodder for these shows is a steady diet of human 
suffering, crises, angst and tragedy.  Former spouses and 
estranged friends face off against each other; grown men and women 
reveal to the parents their until-now-hidden perversities, and 
human oddities of all shapes and sizes present themselves for 
humiliation before a nationwide audience.  The ultimate goal of 
these shows is the public expression of private feelings.  They 
seek tears, anger, jealousy and graphic self-immolation recorded 
by the camera on a tight close-up.  With a dozen such shows now in 
syndication, the competition is intense to seek out new forms of 
conflict and expose the latest narcissistic trends.

Talk shows are produced "live on tape" with minimal editing, and 
this presents special problems for a guest.  In other forms of 
television, sound bites rule the show.  It may seem artificial, 
but tight editing at least assures that each party has their say 
and only their finest bon mot will be used.  The courteous speaker 
with a few good ideas can confidently compete with any 
extravagant, microphone-hogging blowhard, because most of what the 
blowhard says will be cut.  In the almost-live talk show, the more 
reasonable speaker has to compete with the blowhard head on.  
There is no time for an orderly presentation of evidence; he who 
makes the most outrageous, confident and colorful claims, 
groundless or not, gains the camera's eye and controls the game.

If you have any shred of personal dignity and are asked to be a 
guest on a Human Conflict show, the best response is obvious:  
"Just Say No."  Unless you are a masochist or a natural born 
actor, there is no way you can win in this format.  We know it 
now; we knew it then, but sometimes, like Oedipus, you just can't 
stop the inevitable march of Fate....

 ..... ONWARD TO HUMILIATION .....

The path to our own downfall was indirect.  For several months, a 
number of journalists have been making the pilgrimage to Freedom 
Ridge, and we generally escort them as a sort of local public 
relations representative.  We do not charge for this service, and 
we do not discriminate between journalists.  If TASS or Penthouse 
or the Podunk Review came to call, we would treat them no 
differently than the New York Times.

In May, we got a call from a producer from the Montel Williams 
Show, one of the Human Conflict shows that we had never seen.  It 
seems that "Montel," as he is known to the world, had promised on 
an earlier talk show that he would visit the border of Area 51.  
We told the producer that we would be willing to escort Montel and 
his crew to Freedom Ridge to tape a segment, but we declined an 
offer to come to New York to appear on the studio show.  Montel's 
visit was originally scheduled for May 5 but was canceled at the 
last minute, and we breathed a sign of relief.

In August, the project was reactivated, we suspect as the result 
of the June 22 article in the New York Times.  Montel's visit was 
scheduled for Aug. 16, and we were again asked if we would go to 
New York to appear on the later show.  Again, we declined.

When Montel came to Rachel, he brought a Humvee, his producers and 
a film crew.  We went through the usual script for the camera:  
Montel drives up to our Research Center, and we meet him in the 
driveway.  Inside, we show him where we are going on the map, then 
we get in the car and drive the rugged road to Freedom Ridge.  We 
had done it before with countless crews, but never so quickly and 
in so few "takes."  When Montel arrived, there was no question 
that he was in charge.  He asked no significant questions, and 
showed no particular interest in the secret base itself.  We 
sensed that he came only because he said he would and that his 
primary aim was to film a sound bite on the ridge that said, "You 
see, I did what I promised."

As we rode down from Freedom Ridge in the Humvee with Montel and 
the producer, we were again asked if we would come to New York to 
appear on the talk show the following week, Aug. 23.  We hesitated 
and were about to turn down the offer cold, when the producer 
uttered the only horrible words that could force us to comply.

Sean David Morton.

 ..... THE EMBODIMENT OF EVIL .....

We first learned of Sean Morton over two years ago, before we came 
to Rachel.  We had heard his enthusiastic endorsement of the Black 
Mailbox on a UFO video:

   "Probably the most amazing thing about Area 51 is the fact that 
this is literally the only place in the world where you can go out 
and actually see flying saucers on a timetable basis.  You can 
literally go out there on a Wednesday night between about seven 
and one a.m. and you'll see these things flying up and down the 
valley.  It's absolutely amazing.  On even a bad night you'll have 
ten, eleven, twelve sightings.  On a good night--and I've been out 
there with friends of mine camping--on a good night the sky will 
just rip open with these things.  You'll see anywhere between 
twenty to forty objects in a night testing over the base for 
anywhere from fifteen and forty minutes at a time."

We've lived near the border for over a year and a half now, are 
genuinely interested in UFOs and have spent countless days and 
nights in the desert; yet we haven't seen even ONE flying saucer, 
let alone scores.  The logical explanation is that we arrived too 
late, after the saucers had been packed up and moved elsewhere.  
The trouble with this theory is that during the early part of our 
tenure, Sean Morton continued to bring tours to the area--at $99 a 
head--and reported UFOs everywhere.

In one celebrated incident in March 1993, Psychospy spent the 
night on White Sides, overlooking Groom Lake, with some aviation 
watchers and a writer from Popular Science.  We were looking for 
the alleged Aurora spyplane--almost as ephemeral as flying 
saucers--but we saw nothing more than a few satellites, some 
distant aircraft strobes and an occasional meteor.  The following 
was reported in the March 1994 Popular Science....

   "Last March, three chilly airplane watchers with binoculars 
atop White Sides Mountain at this magic hour [4:45am] were 
tracking a 737 airliner approaching Groom Lake, as a fourth member 
of their group thawed out in his truck below.  Parked on a knoll, 
he was next to a vanload of UFO seekers.  They were lead by tour 
operator Sean Morton, whose leaflet described him as 'the world's 
foremost UFO researcher.'

   "Morton donned a horned Viking helmet and from time to time 
pointed to the sky, exclaiming: 'Look at that one!'  The airplane 
watcher trained his binoculars in the same direction but saw 
nothing out of the ordinary.  Later, Morton's group became excited 
by what they perceived as an entire formation of UFOs; the 
airplane watcher's lenses revealed only stars.  Finally, as the 
morning's first 737 made its gentle approach toward Groom Lake at 
4:45, the UFO enthusiasts rejoiced at Old Faithful's appearance.  
Everyone had seen exactly what they hoped for."

In the beginning, when we were new to the area, we were generous 
to Sean and called him "fantasy prone."  As we got to know him 
better and gained confidence in our own knowledge base, we came to 
mince no words.  Sean is a deliberate con man.  He recognizes as 
well as us the landing lights of a 737, but he knows that others 
can be fooled and taken for a $99 ride to see them.  If anyone is 
spreading disinformation about Area 51, filling the air with noise 
to make the truth harder to grasp, it isn't sinister government 
agents; it's Sean David Morton pursuing only his own greed and 
self-aggrandizement.

We have worked hard over the past 18 months to undo the damage 
Sean has done and displace him from the Area 51 scene.  
Discrediting Sean isn't complicated:  We simply quote his own 
words whenever we can.  Sean is a broadly diversified charlatan, a 
self-proclaimed expert in faith healing, earthquake prediction, 
psychic prophesy and virtually every other New Age fad.  We have 
no problem at all with him plying his trade within the confines of 
the state of California where he justly belongs, but when he 
proclaims himself the foremost authority on Area 51, we get 
territorial.  We hope that our "Area 51 Viewers Guide" has reduced 
the gullibility of newcomers and made the environment less 
attractive for leeches like him.  In fact, we haven't had a 
confirmed Morton sighting near the border in over a year.  We 
heard from sources in California that he no longer gave tours to 
Area 51 because the saucers had been moved elsewhere--which was 
fine by us.

The saucers must have returned, however.  As the recent Groom Lake 
publicity reached its peak, "The World's Foremost UFO Researcher" 
could not help but resurface to suck energy from it.  In recent 
months, reports began to reach us that he had appeared as an Area 
51 expert at UFO conferences, on radio talk shows and on the 
Montel Williams Show.  

In the latter appearance, which was first broadcast in December 
1993, Sean showed video footage of nighttime "UFOs" that he said 
he photographed "at great risk to my own life."  As we viewed them 
later, one clip showed an isolated circle of light jumping around 
within the frame.  It could have been any stationary out-of-focus 
light shot through a hand-held video camera.  Notches seen on the 
top and bottom of the "disk" correspond to protrusions inside the 
lens assembly.  In the other clip, only slightly out of focus, we 
saw the lights of a 737 landing on the Groom Lake airstrip.  To 
Sean, it was "an object actually coming in from space."  The time 
stamp in the corner said "4:49 am."

It was on this show that Montel promised to visit Area 51 escorted 
by Sean; yet when Montel finally made the trip eight months later, 
Sean was not invited.  The producer told us that word had reached 
him from many sources that Sean was considered a fraud, that in 
addition to UFOs he also did psychic prophesies and that his 
claimed credentials were highly dubious.  He and Montel felt that 
Sean had taken advantage of them and that by having him on the 
show they had inadvertently legitimized him.

But none of that prevented them from inviting him back as a guest 
the second studio show.

As we rode down in the Humvee from Freedom Ridge with Montel and 
the producer, the reality to us became crystal clear:  If we did 
not appear on the Montel Williams Show, then Sean would have the 
stage all to himself and could continue to spread any sort of 
nonsense about Area 51.  We felt that we had no choice.  Either we 
did battle with this guy now, before he grew bigger, or we would 
be cleaning up his mess for many months to come.

 ..... OUR RAPID EDUCATION .....

We had less than a week to prepare for the big show--nowhere near 
enough time to do all the research we needed.  The first item of 
business was to actually watch the Montel Williams Show and 
familiarize ourselves with the format.  We cranked up our 
satellite dish and surfed through the channels.  On "Donahue":  
"Six Year Olds Who Sexually Harass Other Six Year Olds."  On 
"Rolanda, a related topic:  "Will Your Child Grow Up To Be A 
Serial Killer?"  On "The Vicky Show," we heard that Sean Morton 
had just appeared as an expert on the prophesies of Nostradamus, 
but we were unable to catch that one.

The first Montel Williams Show we saw was, "Mistresses Who Want To 
End The Affair."  On the stage, three women disguised by dark 
sunglasses explained why they had been attracted to married men.  
We could only tolerate about ten seconds at a time of this show, 
but when we tuned back, we found that the women had shed their 
sunglasses and revealed their true identities.  Presumably, they 
had also revealed, or at least seriously compromised, the 
identities of the men they had been having the affairs with.  When 
we tuned in again later, one of the three was having an angry 
argument with a fourth female guest.  We guessed that this was the 
wife of one of the married men.

A friend sent us a tape of Montel's original UFO show in which 
Sean appeared as a "UFO Investigator" and Montel promised to 
visit.  The show included an abductee, a witness to the "Kecksburg 
Incident," a former actress, WFUFOR Sean David Morton, a requisite 
skeptic, a pro-UFO filmmaker and--as if you hadn't guessed--that 
talk show regular Travis Walton.  The show was conducted in the 
"expanding chairs" format.  It started out with two guests alone 
on the stage, then more guests and chairs were added during each 
commercial break until there were seven chairs and seven 
squabbling speakers vying for attention on the platform.  In this 
format, attention is diluted with each new chair, so the people 
who appear last, typically the skeptics, usually get only a few 
seconds of airtime.  During the free-for-all of a seven-person 
debate, the camera always focuses on the most aggressive and 
charismatic guest--i.e. Sean David Morton.

The last chair to be filled was occupied by filmmaker Russ Estes, 
who the on-screen caption said, "Does Not Believe In UFOs."  This 
is false.  He is a disciplined UFO investigator who has devoted 
his career to making films on the subject, as well as exposing 
obvious frauds.  What is true is that he "Does Not Believe In Sean 
Morton."  In his few seconds of air time, he raised doubts about 
one of Morton's many fake credentials, his claimed "Doctor of 
Divinity" degree.

RUSS ESTES:  "Montel, my biggest problem, and this is what I've 
run into over and over again, is the quality of the individual who 
is bringing me the message.  You know, the-boy-that-cried-wolf 
syndrome is phenomenal in this field.  You get people out there 
who are saying, I'm this, I'm that, and I hate to do this to you, 
Sean, but here's a guy right here who claims to be the Doctor, 
Reverend Sean David Morton.  In his own biography, he claims to 
have gotten his Doctor of Divinity at--excuse me, it will take me 
one second...."

SEAN MORTON:  "Berachah University."

RUSS ESTES:  "Berachah University, Houston, Texas--the Berachah 
Church.  I called them.  They don't have any type of degrees that 
they give.  They have Bible study at the best.  He claims to have 
attended University of Southern California...."

MONTEL WILLIAMS:  "So the point that you are making, Russ, is that 
there's a problem with the messenger, so therefore the message is 
not real."

RUSS ESTES:  "How can you believe the message if the people lie to 
you from the start."

SEAN MORTON:  "The thing I'd like to point out about Mr. Estes 
here is that if you don't like the message, you can shoot the 
messenger, and it's obvious to me that in the UFO field, we do 
this for free, we do this because we want to know the truth, 
because we have seen something...."

RUSS ESTES:  "But does that mean you bogey up your credentials?"

SEAN MORTON (angry):  "That is not true.  You are flat-out lying 
to these people.  I went to USC for four years."

Just then, the debate was cut off by a sloppy edit, and Sean's USC 
diploma appeared on the screen.  

After watching the tape, we contacted Russ Estes.  He said that 
the debate between he and Sean went on much longer than was shown 
on the screen.  "Live on tape" does not mean totally unedited.  
This show went on for over two hours to obtain a one hour's worth 
of material.  Sometimes, whole shows are thrown out when they 
don't work.  Unfortunately, Estes made a misstep on the USC 
degree.  As it turns out, this is just about the only authentic 
credential he has: a B.A. in Drama and Political Science.  We 
certainly believe the Drama part:  It's the last degree he ever 
needed.

The Doctor of Divinity degree is still phony, but in the talk show 
world, evidence counts for nothing; only emotions and presentation 
matter.  Sean walked away from the show as a brave and 
knowledgeable crusader, legitimized by a promise from Montel to 
take his tour, and with the implied invitation to reappear on the 
show.  Estes walked away alone, wasn't invited to return, and has 
since had to live down the "Does Not Believe in UFOs" moniker.  
Sean even had the delightful gall to send Estes a letter, through 
the producers...

Mr. Russ Estes
c/o Alex Williams [sic]
The Montel Williams Show
1500 Broadway Suite 700
New York, New York, 10036

Dear Russ:

I am going to assume that you are not a bold faced liar who is out 
for some kind of warped revenge, or a person who is just trying to 
make a buck off baseless slander.

Let's try to solve this like gentlemen - enclosed is a copy of my 
U.S.C. diploma.  I have also called the school and my records are 
intact.  The rest of your "research" on me is equally faulty.

I hope this solves out problem.  If not, I have consulted my 
attorney and any further slander directed toward me through your 
video series or elsewhere, will result in action taken against 
you.

Yours Truly,
[BIG signature]
Sean Morton

Things were beginning to look grim for Psychospy.  With the time 
of the taping drawing near, we hadn't even begun to scratch the 
surface of Sean David Morton and his path of destruction.  Talking 
to our contacts, we saw that Sean had accumulated a vast audience 
of intimate enemies, more than we could possibly contact.  If Sean 
sounds knowledgeable and occasionally has some meaningful 
information, it is because he has ripped it off from others.  We 
were amused to find that there was even an reputable astrologer 
who hated Sean, who felt that Sean had stolen his predictions and 
passed them off as his own.

It seemed a futile exercise anyway.  We knew all the evidence in 
the world wasn't going to matter when we actually faced off 
against Sean on camera.   We were leaving behind our own 
comfortable medium of logic and data and stepping into his home 
turf--the talk show--where presentation counts more than content.  
We were obligated by our own ethics to speak only the simplest 
truths and the cautious assertions supported by data.  Sean David 
Morton, bold faced liar that he is, faced no such constraints.  He 
could spout any lie he wanted to sound important and get himself 
off the hook, and the only thing that mattered here was that he 
said it with apparent sincerity and that it held up for 
television's thirty second attention span.  We knew that if we 
started to make an accusation about him, he would instantly sense 
the winds and make the same one against us with greater force.  
The ensuing argument would make he and us appear to be equals.

Sean knew all the buzzwords and cliches of the UFO movement and 
could spout the conventional wisdom much faster than we could.  He 
knew how to sound sincere and reasonable and adapt instantly to 
the sentiments of any social circumstance.  He was well-practiced 
at responding to inquisitions and had emerged from many without a 
scratch.  Opposing him, all we had was a body of mundane knowledge 
about a very limited area of the desert.  Sean was smooth and 
well-honed in his talk show delivery, and we were stumbling in for 
the first time to a medium where we really didn't want to be.

It was with these reservations and a sense of dark foreboding that 
we packed our bags and headed for New York City.  There, in Times 
Square, we expected a titanic battle between Good and Evil, and 
things didn't look good for Good.

[To be continued in Desert Rat #16....]

 ----- NEW AIR FORCE STATEMENT ON GROOM -----

The following statement was recently released to inquiring 
journalists by the Nellis AFB public affairs office.  (We 
requested our own copy from Major George Sillia on Aug. 26.)  It 
represents a significant shift from the previous "We know nothing 
about Groom Lake" response.

   "There are a variety of facilities throughout the Nellis Range 
Complex.  We do have facilities within the complex near the dry 
lake bed of Groom Lake.  The facilities of the Nellis Range 
Complex are used for testing and training technologies, 
operations, and systems critical to the effectiveness of U.S. 
military forces.  Specific activities conducted at Nellis cannot 
be discussed any further than that."

That's a step in the right direction.  What the base needs now is 
a name and a history.  For example, tell us about the U-2 and A-12 
programs at Groom in the 1950s and 1960s.  That's not very secret 
or critical to our current defense, so what's the point in 
pretending it is?  Will the Air Force take control of the 
situation and provide this information itself, or will the void be 
filled by a dozen aggressive entrepreneurs?

We'd bet our money on the entrepreneurs.

 ----- EG&G TO ABANDON TEST SITE ----

According to an 8/26 article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, EG&G 
and its REECo subsidiary will not seek renewal of their Nevada 
Test Site contract when it expires in 1995.  These are two of the 
three companies that have managed the nuclear testing ground since 
its inception.  It is unclear whether this action will have any 
affect on operations at the adjoining Groom Lake base, where EG&G 
and REECo are also assumed to be major contractors.  

Recent rumors say that EG&G no longer operates the "Janet" 737 
jets that shuttle workers to Groom and Tonopah.  That operation 
has supposedly been taken over by the Air Force, using the same 
aircraft and possibly the same staff.

 ----- JANET "N" NUMBERS -----

For aircraft watchers, here are the registration and serial 
numbers of Janet 737s and Gulfstream commuter planes spotted at 
the Janet terminal at McCarran airport.  Based on observations in 
5/94 and the 4/30/94 FAA registry.  One or more of the Janet 
aircraft are probably missing from this list.  (We ask our readers 
to find them.)

 ----- JANET HANDOFF FREQUENCIES ----

A DESERT RAT EXCLUSIVE!  Published here for the first time are the 
air traffic control frequencies for the "Janet" 737 crew flights 
from Las Vegas McCarran Airport to Groom.  The McCarran freqs are 
public, but the Groom ones have not been revealed until now.  Air 
traffic control broadcasts are "in the clear" and any scanner 
radio should be able to pick them up.  Each of these freqs has 
been personally confirmed by Psychospy or a close associate.

121.9   McCarran Ground Control
119.9   McCarran Tower
133.95  Departure Control
119.35  Nellis Control
120.35  Groom Approach
127.65  Groom Tower
118.45  Groom Ground

Here are some other Groom freqs (some of which were previously 
reported in DR #8).  The security frequencies are usually 
scrambled, but not always.

418.05  Cammo Dudes (primary)
408.4   Cammo Dudes (repeat of 418.05)
142.2   Cammo Dudes
170.5   Cammo Dudes (Channel 3)
138.3   "Adjustment Net" (seems related to security)
261.1   Dreamland Control (published)
255.5   Groom Tower (repeat of 127.65)
154.86  Lincoln County Sheriff
496.25  Road sensors on public land
410.8   Pager (apparently from Groom but unconfirmed)

The most accurate way to detect a road sensor (AFTER you have 
tripped it), is to program 496.25 into several channels of your 
scanner, then scan those channels exclusively as you are driving.  
When the scanner stops on one channel, you have just passed a 
sensor.

 ----- GROOMSTOCK '94 -----

The "Freedom Ridge Free Speech Encampment" went pretty much as 
planned, with at least sixty people in attendance but not all of 
them staying for the night.  There were no surprises and, sadly, 
no confrontations with the authorities when we whipped out our 
cameras and pseudo-cameras to point at the secret base.  The Cammo 
Dudes were visible but kept their distance, and the only authority 
figure to show up on the ridge was a BLM Ranger in a Smoky-the-
Bear hat.  He was concerned only that we clean up our trash, and 
he warned us, by his very presence, that "Only You Can Prevent 
Forest Fires."

The event was recorded in an 8/29 article in the Las Vegas Review-
Journal, which dubbed it "Groomstock."  [The article may be 
available at the FTP site.]  We were disturbed to read in the 
paper that the attendees included some "marijuana-smoking 
slackers."  We called around and found out it was true and that it 
happened after Psychospy went to bed.  Had we known, we would have 
quashed it immediately.  This sort of thing discredits our ability 
to police ourselves and hurts the reputation of the land grab 
opponents.

The hot gossip around the campfire was about the Review-Journal 
reporter and the loony in the tie-dyed shirt.  The loony had spent 
about an hour moving rocks and dirt around to make himself a 
comfortable bed, then he blew a conk-shell horn and banged cymbals 
together to bless it.  When the reporter arrived, he volunteered 
to make a bed for her, too, not far from his own, and he proceeded 
with the project without any encouragement.  It is unknown why he 
singled her out for this special honor, but evidently she was 
"chosen."  It should be noted, however, that while blessing the 
reporter's bed, the loony accidentally dropped one of the cymbals.  
We forget to check with the reporter in the morning to see if that 
omen affected the quality of her nighttime experience.

 ----- SOUND FAMILIAR? -----

From an AP news story printed in the 8/5 Review-Journal...

   "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Authorities deported an American TV 
crew Thursday, putting the three journalists in an open pickup 
truck, parading them through the capital and then dumping them at 
the Dominican border....

   "Soldiers detained the freelance journalists for PBS's 'The 
MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour' on Sunday while they were filming at 
Port-au-Prince's airport.  Three of their videotapes were 
seized....

   "The military-backed government has urged journalists not to 
report 'alarmist' news and has attempted to restrict news 
coverage....

   "'I think it's deplorable, and it's obviously an attempt to 
embarrass them,' [U.S.] Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager told 
The Associated Press.  'This treatment was not necessary; neither 
was the deportation....  It's a transparent attempt by this 
illegal regime to interfere with the free flow of information.'"

In related news, the four of the five video tapes seized on July 
19 from KNBC-TV have still not been returned.  The tapes were 
taken without a warrant after the crew filmed an interview on 
Freedom Ridge but not the Groom base itself.  Activist Glenn 
Campbell, who accompanied the crew, was arrested when he attempted 
to interfere with this seizure.

 ----- CAMPBELL ARRAIGNED -----

Activist Glenn Campbell reports that his Aug. 24 arraignment on 
obstruction charges was "amicable."  Charges were presented, but 
the District Attorney did not appear.  The complete text of the 
charges, stemming from the July 19 KNBC incident, reads as 
follows...

Case No. P55-94

IN THE JUSTICE COURT OF THE PAHRANAGAT VALLEY TOWNSHIP
IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF LINCOLN, STATE OF NEVADA

CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

STATE OF NEVADA, Plaintiff,
 vs.
GLENN P. CAMPBELL, Defendant.

STATE OF NEVADA    ) ss.
County of Lincoln  )

DOUG LAMOREAUX, being first duly sworn and under penalty of 
perjury, personally appeared before me and complained that on or 
about the 19th of July, 1994, in Lincoln County, State of Nevada, 
the above-named Defendant, GLENN P. CAMPBELL, committed the 
following crime:

COUNT 1

OBSTRUCTING PUBLIC OFFICER, a violation of NRS 197.1990 and LCC 
1.12.010, a MISDEMEANOR, in the following manner:

The Defendant did, then and there, after due notice, willfully, 
hinder, delay or obstruct a public officer in the discharge of his 
officer powers or duties.  Specifically, the Defendant did, then 
and there, after due notice, willfully hinder Sergeant Doug 
Lamoreaux in the discharge of his official duties by locking the 
doors of the vehicle which Sergeant Lamoreaux was retrieving 
certain items from and further refused to unlock the doors after 
being requested to do so by Sergeant Lamoreaux.

All of which is contrary to the form of Statute in such cases made 
and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State of 
Nevada.  The complainant, therefore, prays that a Warrant be 
issued for the arrest of the Defendant, if not already arrested, 
so that he may be dealt with according to law.

The only surprise in these charges is the line "and further 
refused to unlock the doors after being requested to do so by 
Sergeant Lamoreaux."  That is not how Campbell recalls the 
incident.  DR#12, published less than 12 hours after the incident, 
reported it as follows...

   "At this point Campbell, who had been standing on the opposite 
side of the vehicle, reached in and pushed down the door locks on 
the side that Lamoreaux was approaching.

   "Lamoreaux said, 'You're under arrest.'  Campbell was 
immediately handcuffed and placed in Deputy Bryant's vehicle."

Campbell claims that Lamoreaux said, "You're under arrest," 
IMMEDIATELY after he pushed down the door locks, with no request 
being made to unlock them.  Campbell says he has two other 
witnesses, the KNBC crew, who can verify his story.  In this case, 
where the basic recollection of facts is in conflict, it will be 
interesting to see what the second officer, Deputy Kelly Bryant, 
will say under oath.

However, the core of Campbell's defense rests on Constitutional 
issues.  He is guilty of obstruction only if the officer was 
indeed engaged in the "lawful" execution of his duties.  Lamoreaux 
justified his warrantless search by citing, in vague terms, a 
certain Supreme Court ruling, the name of which he could not 
recall at the time.  That ruling is apparently in the case "Ross 
vs. U.S." which allows the warrantless seizure of "contraband" 
from a vehicle when there is a danger of flight.  It is unclear at 
this point whether the video tapes of a news crew constitute 
contraband in the same manner as a shipment of marijuana or stolen 
merchandise.  Complex First Amendment issues may be invoked.  The 
case may be further complicated by the repeated offer by the TV 
reporter to allow Lamoreaux to view the video tapes himself.

Campbell has requested, and has been granted, a jury trial.  
According to the Justice, this will be the first jury trial held 
in this court since about 1987.  Campbell announced his intention 
to represent himself at the trial, with possible legal co-council.  
A tentative trial date of Oct. 25 has been set, but it is likely 
to be postponed.  Campbell indicated that he will waive his right 
to a trial within 60 days to allow more time to conduct legal 
research.

 ----- LARRY KING NOT CLONED? -----

Our report in DR#13 about the diversion of Larry King's plane to 
Nellis AFB continues to disturb many of our readers.  It raises 
the specter of secret contacts between King and the military or 
even a surreptitious replacement of the talk show host by a look-
alike clone.  Now, we wonder if our panic was only a false alarm.  

A producer from a Las Vegas TV station tells us:  "I checked into 
it and think it is legit.  According to the FAA, McCarran Airport 
was never really closed, but they did have pilots choose not to 
land on that Saturday afternoon because of inclement weather.  
They also confirm that there is an agreement with Nellis to allow 
planes in trouble to land there.  I spoke to the control tower at 
McCarran.  They checked their records, and they indicate that on 
that Saturday a nasty thunderstorm was noted by the tower at 1:45-
2:05.  In fact, four takeoffs were delayed during that time due to 
weather.  Planes in the air just flew holding patterns until the 
weather cleared."  

Presumably, King's plane didn't have enough fuel to maintain the 
holding pattern.  Thunderstorms can be very localized, and perhaps 
Nellis was clear.  A producer at Larry King Live says that, in her 
opinion, he is definitely the same Larry King.  She says he got 
the military escort because he was late for a speaking engagement 
and made his wants known on the plane.  

So what can we say?  Obviously, the FAA, the TV station and the 
King producer ARE PARTIES TO THE CONSPIRACY.  This story is deeper 
than it seems, and the Rat will pursue the investigation for as 
long as it takes.  THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.

 ----- MYSTERIOUS SIGN DISAPPEARANCE -----

The big "No Photography" signs on the Groom Lake Road have 
disappeared.  For over a year, they were installed on public land 
about two miles from the military border, but sometime in the 
first week of August they were cleanly removed, posts and all, 
apparently by the Air Force.  (A civilian thief--like SDM, who has 
a number of these signs in his possession--would have simply 
unscrewed the signs, not uprooted the heavy posts and carefully 
filled up the holes.)  The two signs on either side of the road 
were each about 3 feet by 4 feet and bore the following text:

WARNING: THERE IS A RESTRICTED MILITARY INSTALLATION TO THE WEST.  
IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE ANY PHOTOGRAPH, FILM, MAP, SKETCH, PICTURE, 
DRAWING, GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THIS AREA, OR EQUIPMENT AT OR 
FLYING OVER THIS INSTALLATION.  IT IS UNLAWFUL TO REPRODUCE, 
PUBLISH, SELL, OR GIVE AWAY ANY PHOTOGRAPH, FILM, MAP, SKETCH, 
PICTURE, DRAWING, GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THIS AREA, OR 
EQUIPMENT AT OR FLYING OVER THIS INSTALLATION.  VIOLATION OF 
EITHER OFFENSE IS PUNISHABLE WITH UP TO A $1000 FINE AND/OR 
IMPRISONMENT FOR UP TO ONE YEAR.  18 U.S. CODE SEC. 795/797 AND 
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10104.  FOR INFORMATION CONTACT:
   USAF/DOE LIAISON OFFICE
   PO BOX 98518
   LAS VEGAS, NV 89193-8518

The signs first appeared in May 1993 shortly after WFAA-TV from 
Dallas took video of the base from White Sides.  (When challenged 
by the Sheriff, they admitted photographing the base but managed 
to retain their tape.)  The signs were removed in Aug. 1994 
shortly after KNBC-TV from Los Angeles lost their video tape after 
NOT photographing the base.  It is unclear why the AF removed the 
signs.  Perhaps they have become a little smarter and are adopting 
a "don't ask, don't tell" policy toward photography (but we 
wouldn't want to be the ones to test that theory).  The signs 
themselves had become a tourist attraction, and no visitor could 
resist having their picture taken beside them.

At the same time the "No Photography" signs vanished, the 
misplaced "Restricted Area" sign also went away.  This is the 
crossed out sign seen in the NYT article, where the "stupid 
faggot" comment had later been written and then erased (DR#12,13).  
God, we'll miss that sign!  It was as illegal as hell--being on 
public land--but an old friend to us nonetheless.

At least now we can assure the public:  If you see a Restricted 
Area sign, it's real and they mean it.

ENCOUNTERS TRANSCRIPT.  Complete, unedited transcripts (not just 
the sound bites) of the interviews in the 7/22 Encounters show 
(DR#10) are available to Compuserve users.  Type GO ENCOUNTERS, 
and look under "Browse Libraries" and "Interview Transcripts."  
Interviews include Rep. James Bilbray (file FREED2.105), Agent X 
(FREED1.105) and Glenn Campbell (FREED3A.105, FREED3B.105).  This 
is a transcript for video editing, so every "Um" and "Ah" is 
recorded.

NEW GUARD FACILITY.  We send our congrats to the Dudes on their 
newly constructed prefab building next to the guard house on Groom 
Lake Road (about a half mile inside the border).  Apparently, they 
are expecting more business along this part of the border and need 
a new substation.  Interested taxpayers can view the new building 
from the first hill on the hiking trail to F.R. ("Hawkeye Hill"), 
a location that will continue to be public even if F.R. is taken.

UPCOMING TV SEGMENTS.  UNSOLVED MYSTERIES will broadcast a show on 
UFOs with a segment on Area 51 on Sunday, Sept. 18 at 8pm.  The 
broadcast will include a new interview with Bob Lazar.  THE 
CRUSADERS will broadcast a segment on UFOs, including a visit to 
F.R., on Sept. 10 or 11 (date and time vary by city).  Air date 
for THE MONTEL WILLIAMS SHOW taped on Aug. 23 has not been 
confirmed, but it could be the week of Sept. 12.
