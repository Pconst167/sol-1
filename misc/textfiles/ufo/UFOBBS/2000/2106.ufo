hearings for Secretary of Defense designate Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, Ret.) and 
several press organizations. The cc: list at the bottom of the letter shows to

                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                                January 12, 1994

Has Secretary of Defense designate Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, Ret., made
statements indicating that the U.S. Government has extraterrestrial craft in
its possession?  Admiral Inman has been credited with making such statements
which have been construed as meaning that he was aware:

*     that "recovered vehicles" (meaning extraterrestrial alien craft) have
      been in possession of the government for over 10 years, 

*     he had "some expertise" in the area of UFO before his retirement,
       
*     that he has been aware of a program to "indoctrinate the public" in UFO
      matters, 

*     that he "understood who is behind the technology in the crafts" meaning
      extraterrestrial alien beings,

*     that the matter (of U.S, government recovery and possession of alien UFO
      craft) was covered by the "national security laws".

The statements in question have been published in the United Kingdom and the
United States in the books: (UK) Alien Liaison, 1991, and (in the US) Alien
Update 1993, and (reiterated in a slightly different form) (US) Alien Contact:
Top-Secret UFO Files Revealed, 1993, all by Timothy Good.

The subject of "UFO" is a controversial one, but the subject of U.S.
Government possession of recovered alien craft is even more controversial. 
This has, and continues to be denied by every government agency queried.  

We are releasing this statement as a cover document to a letter which, along
with its attachments, calls the attention of the Senate Armed Service
Committee to these claims.  

It is not our intention to attempt to affect the course or outcome of the
confirmation hearing(s), or to impugn Admiral Inman's fine record or him
personally in any way.

It is our intention in making this information available that these issues be
addressed publicly; we feel that this is as important for Admiral Inman as it
is for the country.

We are writing to bring to your attention controversial claims made about 
statements made by Admiral Inman.  These claims have been published in the 
United Kingdom and the United States in the books: (UK) Alien Liaison, 1991, 
and (in the US) Alien Update 1993, and (reiterated in a slightly different 
form) (US) Alien Contact: Top-Secret UFO Files Revealed, 1993 all by Timothy 
Good. Please see bibliography for further information. 

It is not our intention to attempt to affect the outcome of the confirmation 
hearing(s), or to impugn Admiral Inman's fine record or him personally in any 
way. 

It is our intention to make this information available so that the confirmation 
hearings provide an opportunity to address this subject and thereby deal with 
these controversial issues.  We feel that addressing this issue is as important 
for Admiral Inman as it is for the country. 

In Mr. Good's books, Mr. Oeschler attributes the statements at issue here to 
Admiral Inman during a July 1989 telephone conversation which was recorded by 
Oeschler only for "note taking purposes."  Portions of the transcript of the 
recorded conversation are reproduced in Alien Update and portions of the tape 
have been played on a 1991 episode of the television documentary program Now It 
Can Be Told.  Mr. Oeschler credits Admiral Inman with statements indicating: 

      "...that MJ-12 meant something to him."  pp. 208 Alien Update

      that he has been aware of a program to "indoctrinate the public" in UFO 
       matters prior to his retirement. pp. 211 Alien Update

      that he had "some expertise" in the area of UFO but his information 
       was out of date at the time of the conversation. pp. 211 Alien Update

      that the "pace at which things move in that field" (UFO-related 
       technological research) was high. pp. 212 Alien Update

      that he was familiar with use of the term "craft" meaning UFO. 
       pp. 212 Alien Update

      that he "understood who is behind the technology in the crafts" 
       meaning extraterrestrial alien beings. pp. 212-213 Alien Update

      that he referred Mr. Oeschler to CIA Deputy Director for Science 
       and Technology Everett Hineman and former Director of Naval 
       Intelligence Sumner Shapiro in response to Mr. Oeschler's request 
       for "guidance" in his effort to "get closer to MJ-12" 
       pp. 213 Alien Update

      that he acknowledged that "recovered vehicles" (i.e. extraterrestrial 
       craft) have been in possession of the government for over 10 years, 
       that "access to them was them was denied" pp. 214 Alien Update

      that his "Executive Assistant" acknowledged that the Admiral Inman 
       was aware that the matter under discussion (U.S. government recovery 
       and possession of UFO craft) was covered by the "national security 
       laws." pp. 214 Alien Update

The matter of "MJ-12" or "the Majestic Twelve" is raised by Bob Oeschler who 
reports that it has been suggested that Admiral Inman was an actual member or 
an "insider" of MJ-12.  This is tantamount to accusing Admiral Inman of being a 
participating member of a 'secret inner government' which has been credited in 
print with everything from merely keeping secret certain facts to intimidation 
of witnesses and much more pervasive and sinister manipulation, for this is the 
reputation of MJ-12.  

MJ-12 is purportedly an organization set up by President Truman in 1947 in 
response to the purported recovery of a crashed extraterrestrial craft in New 
Mexico.  The "evidence" for the existence of MJ-12 is in the nature of a 
"Presidential Briefing Paper."  Despite extensive study and even more extensive 
speculation about it's implications, the "MJ-12 Briefing Paper" is by no mean a 
verified document.  Recently, after years of "no records" responses to Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA) requests regarding the authenticity of the MJ-12 
Paper, government agencies have shifted to responses of "BOGUS," and "Cannot be 
Authenticated as a Genuine ... Document".  Reasons for this apparent change in 
policy are unknown.  A recent FBI FOIA release containing the "MJ-12 briefing 
paper" is reproduced in attachment No. 4. 

We quote USA Today article "Inman gets Defense 'Duty'", by Steve Kamarow as 
printed in the FRI./SAT./SUN., DEC. 17-19, 1993 issue: 
      
      "Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former Navy secretary, said
      it's "a superb choice ... He has an absolute
      credibility with the men and women in uniform."

Yet Admiral Inman is being credited with very controversial statements 
regarding a subject which has, and continues to receive denials from every 
government agency queried.  Might Adm. Inman's "absolute credibility" come into 
question were he to be viewed as holding a view opposite to repeated 
official

pronouncements?... or of making what are perceived to be very controversial 
statements in a very controversial subject matter? After all, should it be true 
that recovered extraterrestrial artifacts are in the possession of the U.S. 
Government would be the biggest story of all time. 

Let us assure you that we take the matter of having verifiable information 
available seriously, and reiterate that our purpose is only to facilitate 
addressing these issues.
