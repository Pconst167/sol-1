     ParaNet   Information  Service  (Denver,  CO)  --   In   our

continuing  coverage of the remarkable revelations coming out  of

Las  Vegas, Nevada, here is the next installment to  the  program

aired  on  November 13, 1989 by television  station  KLAS-TV  and

George Knapp.



=================================================================

News Anchor persons:

     A  former  government scientist has alleged  that  the  U.S.

military is flying recovered UFOs at a secret base in the  Nevada

desert.  The allegations about the secret facility near the Groom

Mountains  first  surfaced  on Eyewitness  News  on  last  Friday

[November 10, 1989].

     Scientist Bob Lazar says that there are at least nine of the

flying  saucers  being  tested and that they were  not  built  on

Earth.   George Knapp has more on the continuation of our  series

on UFOs.



Lazar:   "Yeah.  It was obvious it came from somewhere else,  uh,

other than Earth."



     Scientist Bob Lazar was convinced that the technology he saw

being  tested at a secret base in the Nevada desert is  of  alien

origin,  and for Lazar the proof is, at least, partially  in  the

furniture.   One of the nine flying disks he says he saw  at  the

base,  which  was  designated S-4, looks exactly  like  this  UFO

photographed  in Europe [Photo of UFO shown].   Lazar  called  it

the "sport model."



Lazar:  "I gave everything names -- the top hat one and you  know

the  jello  mold and, uh, the sport model  operated  without  any

hitches  at  all.  I mean, it looked new.  If I knew what  a  new

flying  saucer looked like.  One of them looked like it  was  hit

with  some  sort  of a projectile.  It had a large  hole  in  the

bottom  and a large hole in the top with the metal bent out  like

some  sort  of,  you know, large caliber 4 or  5  inch  had  gone

through it."



     Even  before he saw the sport model operate, Lazar says,  he

suspected   that  the  ship  came  from  somewhere   else.    The

realization  slapped him in the face the first time  he  glimpsed

the inside of the disk.



Lazar:  "I got to look inside and it had really small chairs.   I

think  that  was the first confirmation I had.  That was  just  a

shocking thing because everytime before that I was able to  label

it.  This is just a little advance that a group of scientists had

formed  and,  you know, they're keeping it secret, and  yeah,  we

could  have  built  a big disk like that,  and  yeah,  that's  no

problem, and, you know, we could have adapted the use(?) to  make

it fly, but why does it have little furniture inside?  [garbled].

And things began to click together just all too fast."



     A  few of the disks had been completely dismantled  to  find

out   how  they  worked,  Lazar  says,  but  others  were   fully

operational.  A Japanese TV network created this animated version

of  Lazar's story after his first interview with us aired in  May

[showing  video].  Lazar says the dramatization is similar  to  a

test flight he witnessed.



Lazar:  "The bottom of it glowed blue and began to hiss like any,

like  high  voltage does on a round sphere.  It's  my  impression

that the reason that they're round and have no sharp edges is  to

contain the high voltage like, uh, if you've seen a high  voltage

system's insulators -- things are round or else you get a  corona

discharge.   In either case, it began to hiss as in high  voltage

and it lifted off the ground quietly except for that little  hiss

in  the background, and that stopped as soon as it reached  about

20 or 30 feet."



     Lazar  says the test of the sport model was a short  one  --

that  it  made  only a few moves before setting  back  down.   He

didn't  see  who  was actually flying the  craft,  but  was  very

impressed, nonetheless.



Lazar:  "Well, there's no action reaction system to it.   There's

no,  like  in a jet engine, exhaust gas being thrown  out  --  no

propeller,  no noise.  It's just, for all intents  and  purposes,

magic."



     To  Lazar's knowledge, the flying disks are not being  used,

for  say, any flights to Jupiter.  He said excessive caution  and

intense  secrecy contributed to the plodding pace of the  program

and were a main source of his disenchantment.



Lazar:   "It's just unfair, outright, not to put it in the  hands

of the overall scientific community.  There are people much  more

capable of dealing with this information, and by this time  would

have  gotten a lot further along than this small select group  of

people working out in the middle of the desert.  They don't  even

have  the facilities, really, to completely analyze what  they're

dealing with."



Gene  Huff:  "Well he was being quiet.  If he kept me abreast  of

anything,  he  kept me abreast of the security checks  --  they'd

randomly  drop  by his house.  They'd threaten his  life;  they'd

threaten  his wife's life.  They had done all that so  we  really

didn't converse, I mean, he really was adhering to the program."



     Gene  Huff is a Las Vegas real estate appraiser.  A  regular

guy  who  just  happens to have a friend  in  the  flying  saucer

business.  He learned about Lazar's S-4 experiences only after  a

long period.  Lazar is anxious for people to know that he  didn't

just  run  right out and spill the secrets of the  universe,  and

that some things are properly kept confidential.



Lazar:  "I did not believe that this should be a security matter.

Some  of it, sure.  But, just the concept that  there's  definite

proof, and uh, we even have articles from another world,  another

system, you just can't not tell everyone.  A lot of people  don't

believe that.  But, I do."



     When he reached what he felt was his bursting point, he took

Huff  and a few others to the edge of the Groom Mountains to  see

the  flights  for themselves.  A total of five witnesses  on  two

consecutive  weeks managed to dodge security patrols long  enough

to see the strange glowing object lift above the mountain.



Huff(?):   "Uh,  it came up above the same  mountain.   It  moved

around.   It  did a step move -- it actually went up in  the  air

like  this  [showing  details with hands]  and  it  hovered  then

dropped way down then it just floated around and cruised  around.

It starts coming up the mountain range...."



     This home video tape was recorded during one of the trips to

the   Groom   Mountains   [showing  video   tape.    A   lot   of

talking....Object  in  sight....Mention  of  brightness  of   the

object....].

     Admittedly,  the tape proves very little by itself  because,

with  the distance and darkness,  there are no  reference  points

other than the alleged flying disk, but Lazar's information about

the  time and location of the test flight proves correct  --  not

once  but  twice.  That, according to our  off-camera  interviews

with each of the other witnesses.  Gene Huff describes his second

sighting:



Huff:   "Through the telescope we could see an  elliptical-shaped

light.   You  can only get so close even with a  telescope  to  a

secure  facility.   Anyway, it came up by us  very  rapidly.   It

glowed  and  glows  brighter like a star and we  almost  got  the

feeling that it was going to explode, it glowed so brightly.   We

backed  up behind the car then it went down and glowed back up  a

little bit and then very softly glided back over, back where  the

mountains  where it came up, hovered for awhile, and then  that's

that....Just like you see in the movies."



     Bob Lazar isn't the only person to claim "inside  knowledge"

of  the  flying  disks at the test site -- he is  just  the  only

person  to  say so publicly.  We have communicated  with  several

people who say they know of the saucer program.  A technician  in

a highly sensitive position told us it is "common knowledge among

those  with high security clearances that recovered  alien  disks

are  stored at the Nevada test site."  A Las Vegas  professional,

who  once  served in the military and was stationed at  the  test

site,  said he saw a flying disk land outside the  boundaries  of

Area  51 -- that it was quickly surrounded by security  personnel

and  that he was taken away and debriefed for several  hours.   A

man  who  once  worked  at Groom Lake as  a  technician,  at  our

request, wrote this letter explaining how he inadvertently walked

into  the  wrong  hangar  and saw what appeared  to  be  a  large

metallic disk under a tarp.  It was being examined by men in  lab

coats.   And,  an  airman  who  worked  at  Nellis  at  a   radar

installation  says  he and his fellow servicemen watched  over  a

period  of  five nights, unusual objects flying  over  the  Groom

Mountains.  He says the radar images indicates the objects zoomed

into range at speeds of 7,000 miles per hour and then would  stop

on  a  dime, and that nothing we have is capable of  doing  that.

The  airman says that when word of his sighting got out,  he  was

ordered  to turn off his radar sensors for that area and told  to

keep quiet about the matter because it did not happen.

     None  of  this means that the military  is  actually  flying

alien  spacecraft in the Nevada desert.  It could all perhaps  be

explained as some other secret program.  Lazar insists that's not

the case.

     We  put  the  matter to the U.S. Navy,  which  according  to

Lazar, is running the saucer show.  Four different naval  offices

were  contacted.   All  denied having any  information  in  their

files.   The  Naval  Research Lab said it  conducted  a  thorough

search  but found "zip."  Naval Intelligence said much  the  same

thing,  adding,  it is not required to create a  file  where  one

doesn't  exist.  A side note:  We also requested files on  a  UFO

sighting over Tremonton, Utah in 1952.  The Navy spent more  than

a thousand hours studying film of that sighting -- a fact  that's

been  noted in several publications -- but, for purposes  of  our

request, the Navy couldn't find those files either.



Lazar:   "The group that runs this project, whether it really  is

the  Navy  or they just say that, apparently  these  people  have

executive power -- they don't report to anyone."



     Tomorrow,   more  troubling  allegations  of  the   military

potential of alien technology.
