      I have been  interested  in the UFO phenomenon for over four decades. 
    All but four months of it, as a reader of books, a dreamer of thoughts, 
    a wonderer of what-ifs,  and a debater of hypotheses.  One day I  saw a 
    message on  a  local BBS about a trip being organized to the Pilot Peak 
    area to search for a purported "underground UFO base".                  
                                                                            
      I wondered what-if and said why not?  I  met with the Sacramento  UFO 
    Group  and  together  with Steve Jones and three days later  with  John 
    Pickens   from  Fresno, I ventured to investigate. Steve Jones and John 
    Pickens both  have  written trip reports on our quests. I didn't. Their 
    concerns  were  mine  and  their reports related what probablly I would 
    have said. We found nothing.                                            
                                                                            
      In  September,   Steve  Jones,  Mike Mace and myself  met  with  Jack 
    Mathias,   the spokesman and Richard Miller,  a  friend of the  Phoenix 
    Group, We met for four hours at the "Ormsby" in Carson City, Nevada. We 
    chatted, traded   expectations, and discussed our lack of findings over 
    the K-2 Phoenix Report.  We  were aware of the Paranet warning over the 
    Phoenix Group and I  was particularly concerned over the question.  Why 
    Now?  Why wait three years  to  release  the  reports?  We received two 
    different answers. Jack Mathias said he had proded the group to release 
    the  information  and  Richard Miller said  he thought  the  Group  was 
    concerned over some possible events that might be occurring "soon".  He 
    said  he  thought  it  had  something to do  with  a  similar  incident 
    involving asteroid 1989FC. As an avid amateur astronomer since my early 
    youth,   my curiosity  was peaked.  He would not elaborate and said  he 
    would  need  permission   from   the  Phoenix  Group  to  release   the 
    information. If he received the Okay,  he would have Jack get us a copy 
    of their findings.  A  couple of days later the material was downloaded 
    to me.                                                                  
                                                                            
      We read it,  checked it out,  sought assistance from various sources. 
    Bottom line, it was less verifiable than the original material.  At the 
    time,  I  felt It would have been a dis-service to the UFO community to 
    release it. I felt it was that bad and I still do.                      
                                                                            
      Since  then,   through  the efforts of many on  this  echo  including 
    members  of the Sacramento UFO Group that physically visited the  site, 
    John  Pickens  report, Joseph Harris work, and Michael Corbin's initial 
    warning much  doubt  was placed on the K-2 Report. When Don Kirschner's 
    findings that the  K-2   tape was bogus became public, Paranet declared 
    the report a hoax.                                                      
                                                                            
      I  decided to release this part of the investigation that deals  with 
    the question why release the reports now? But instead of just releasing 
    Phoenix Project material on 1989FC whole with a warning message to take 
    it    with     a grain of salt, I have dissected and inserted editorial 
    comments along the way.  Hopefuly people will see it for what it is and 
    also hopefully people will be able pick up a pointer here and there and 
    use it in their future research efforts.                                
                                                                            
      I  don't consider myself the author of the commentary.  I  have  over 
    sixty  pages  of typewritten commentary on the original  material  from 
    many,   many sources that have contributed. I thank the various members 
    of   the    Sacramento    UFO    Group that have contributed and e-mail 
    correspondents on GENIE with special thanks to Art Bozlee and the other 
    Science Round Table sysops  that contributed,  many of which were never 
    aware of the original Phoenix Project material.

    From:     Staff 1,  The Phoenix Project                                 
    Subject:  Asteroid 1989FC -- Information requested per conversation     
              of 09/12/92 "Ormsby" meeting.                                 
                                                                            
    Note:  You will find this information useful. It will reveal additional 
    insights  in regard to our concern re the Alien intentions toward Earth 
    and  Humanity.  Thank you for meeting with our representatives.   Their 
    evaluation   of  that  contact  was  favorable.   They  requested  this 
    information  be  forwarded  to  you.  You may use  this  data  at  your 
    discretion.                                                             
                                                                            
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                            
    Commentary edited by Ed Stewart                                         
                                                                            
    Immediately   we  are  faced  with  contradictions.   The   "Privileged 
    Information" header accomplishes three goals:                           
                                                                            
            1. It  asserts  an  air of officialness where as we  shall  see 
               later, none should be asserted.                                 
                                                                            
            2. Creates  the idea that the information that follows  is  not 
               easily obtained, or from classified sources. 
                                                                            
            3. It  becomes  an  ego  boost for the  readers  by  having  an 
               important  piece  of  "Privileged  Information"   personally 
               addressed to them.                                              
                                                                            
    The last sentence nullifies the "Privileged Information"   designation. 
    As of this point,  all information becomes public release.  This is out 
    of character for anyone with a background in intelligence. So right off 
    the  bat  we  know  that  "Staff 1"   in  all  probability  is  not  an 
    intelligence operative or ever was.                                     
                                                                            
    The "From: Staff 1 Phoenix Project:" header accomplishes the following: 
                                                                            
            1. Polarization   around   a   singular,    mysterious   and/or 
               inaccessible  leadership.   Only select individuals  may  be 
               granted access to this person known only as "Staff 1". 
                
            2. But since the mysterious "Staff 1" has taken the reader into 
               his   confidence   by  making  him  privy  to   "Privileged" 
               documentation and establishing the fact that the reader  can 
               be trusted,  why then is this mysterious leader referring to 
               himself as "Staff 1"? 
                
            3. It  is  a  psychological ego  boost  to  have  documentation 
               addressed by the top authoritive figure of the group.   Keep 
               this in mind as we go through the documentation. 
                
    The "Note:" paragraph accomplishes the following: 
                
            1. "Thank you for meeting with our representatives." 
                                                                            
                    a. This reaffirms the inaccessibility of "Staff 1".     
                                                                            
                    b. This reaffirms the authority and rank of "Staff  1", 
                       thereby  putting  the reader in the  subjective  and 
                       subordinate posture. 
                                                                            
            2. "Their evaluation of that contact was favorable."            
                                                                            
                    a. This  is  an ego boost...a pat in the  back  if  you 
                       will. 
                                                                            
                    b. Also  a  subtle manipulation  of  the  reader,   but 
                       nonetheless a manipulation. 
                                                                            
                    c. The group has cracked the door open for the  reader. 
                       They   evaluated  you  and  you  have   been   found 
                       acceptable to them. 
                                                                            
            3. "You may use this data at your own discretion."              
                                                                            
                    a. As stated above, a contradiction.  Information is no 
                       longer privileged. 
                                                                            
                    b. This also makes "Privileged Information" nothing but 
                       a ploy or tease. 
                                                                            
                    c. The reader now has to decide as to whether or not to 
                       accept the mission. Even though none is specifically 
                       stated this introductory material has been carefully 
                       constructed  to imply dissimination.  What would you 
                       do  with  the information that follows?   Would  you 
                       immediately re-broadcast it throughout the echoes? 
                                                                            
                    d. The  seduction has been set.  The bait is in  place. 
                       Will you be pulled in? Just nibble? Or ignore it?

      First of all, nothing is "Privileged" about the above information. It 
    is simply a run of NASA launches that can be gotten by anyone that buys 
    a paper,  watches TV, has access to NASA-SELECT Cable,  or uses a modem 
    like  you  are right now to access one of the many echoes available  to 
    the public.                                                             
                                                                            
      A  very  subtle,  even maybe subliminal manipulation  of  the  reader 
    though is attempted---blank categories  up  at  the header information. 
    "Necessary" informational categories have been left out. This is one of 
    two   things.    It  is either out of character and sloppy for someone, 
    "Staff 1",   that  is supposed to have gleaned "Privileged Information" 
    through  unidentified field operatives from NASA,  or it was  purposely 
    omitted  thus   making   the   "Privileged Information classification a 
    "ploy", or "tease".                                                     
                                                                            
     Also,  we  have a very pertinent piece of information in the  schedule 
    missing:  The discovery and original earth-orbit crossing of 1989   FC. 
    Remember? That is why we are being fed all this privileged information. 
    That    date    is    important because later it will establish a major 
    contradiction to the scenario presented by the "Phoenix Project".

    TOPIC: 1989FC 
    SOURCE: New York Times, AP News Service - and others 
    LOCATION: Earth 
    COMMENTS: In  cosmic terms,  it was a close call.  The  object,   named 
              1989FC,   presumed to be a large asteroid capable of wreaking 
              widespread  destruction  in  a  collision  with Earth  passed 
              within a half million miles of Earth,  (a near-miss in cosmic 
              terms)  the closest approach of such an object in the last 50 
              years.                                    
                                                                            
      The asteroid,  a  collection of rock and dust half a mile or more  in 
    diameter,   crossed  Earth's  orbit undetected March 23,   in  what  is 
    presumed to be one of its annual passes near Earth.                     
                                                                            
      It was discovered by Dr. Henry Holt,  the Northern Arizona University 
    astrogeologist and astronomer, in photographs taken March 31, using the 
    18-inch Schmidt telescope at Mt. Palomar Observatory.     
                                                                            
      Scientists  later calculated that the asteroid,  traveling at  46,000 
    miles  and  hour,   is  orbiting  the Sun once a  year  on  an  erratic 
    elliptical path that brings it back every seven months toward Earth.    
                                                                            
      "It can come this close or closer in the future. When two objects are 
    in overlapping orbits,  the bigger one inevitably pulls the smaller one 
    into its path. Sooner or later it will collide with the Earth, the moon 
    or Mars," said Dr. Holt.                                           
                                                                            
      Dr. Brevan French, an advanced program scientist with NASA, said that 
    if  1989FC collides with the Earth,  the impact would be equivalent  to 
    the explosion of 20,000  one-megaton hydrogen bombs.  A  megaton is the 
    explosive power of one million tons of TNT.  French,  NASA's expert  on 
    large space objects in the solar system, said that such an impact would 
    dig  a crater a mile deep and five to 10  miles wide.  "Landing  in  an 
    ocean would be even more destructive," he said. "Depending on the depth 
    of the water, angle of entry and size, and speed, it could create tidal 
    waves  several hundred meters high.  Waves that large could sweep  over 
    coastal areas,  causing wide-spread destruction."   If 1989FC hits  the 
    Earth, the odds are that it will hit an ocean.

      Subsequent  observations  by  Holt and other astronomers  pegged  the 
    asteroids  speed  at  46,000  mph and determined its  orbit  is  highly 
    elliptical  and erratic.  It will cross Earth's orbit again in  October 
    1989,   but at a greater distance than the 500,000  miles of  its  last 
    encounter  in March.  This was the closest call of  any  Earth-crossing 
    object  since asteroid Hermes in 1937,  which passed at about the  same 
    distance.                                                               
                                                                            
      Many  scientists  believe that periodic collisions with asteroids  or 
    comets  have caused repeated mass extinctions on Earth,  including  one 
    about  65   million  years  ago  alleged  to  be  responsible  for  the 
    disappearance of the dinosaurs.

      Again,  we are provided with information that has been gleamed,  this 
    time  from  the NY Times and Popular  Mechanics---nothing  "Privileged" 
    about it.                                                               
                                                                            
      On the surface it looks inocuous, but we are again manipulated, 
    gently,  subtly  and maybe even subliminally.  Notice the header  date, 
    3/23/89,   the  same  date  that the  asteroid  crossed  Earth's  orbit 
    UNDETECTED.  Obviously,   it  was not the date of the NY Times article. 
    Also, notice that now we are also provided the "Privileged" information 
    of the location of this source in the header: "Location: Earth" 
     
      I point out these things because the reader's mind, subconsciously is 
    picking  all  of this up,  recording it and without the conscious  mind 
    awake,     these subtle data points have no reference of true or false. 
    This makes  it easier for someone to convince the reader that the whole 
    "scenario"  makes sense and has validity. Be aware and pay attention to 
    what you read  and  question it, before you accept the veracity of what 
    is being told.  Even  in presenting a truth, someone with an agenda can 
    manipulate a person's mind without them being aware unless you exercise 
    critical analysis in your thinking. 
     
      Also,  ask why are these sources being presented?  Why media  sources 
    and not the actual IAU circulars,  or the scientist's press releases to 
    the  media?   The  media will edit,  rewrite and  sometimes  leave  out 
    important information and sometimes even produce erroneous information. 
    The NY Times  article first tells us 1989FC makes a presumed pass every 
    year. Two paragraphs later we are told once every seven months. So what 
    is it then?  Is the article reliable?  Or was it just in a hurry to get 
    to press?  Does the Popular Mechanics article provide us  with  any new 
    "Privileged"   information?  No.  Its purpose here is to intensify  the 
    hype, placed here to manipulate the reader once again. 
     
      Never take the media source for your prime source of information.  Go 
    to the actual source. Maybe what we are seeing here is the prime source 
    for  the "Phoenix Project",  not the purported contacts they  say  they 
    have     within      the intelligence community and inside "mysterious" 
    government agencies.

      At this point, in the Phoenix Project file received, was a copy of an

      Due to  the  lenght of the article I am omitting most of it  and only 
    including  that part which deals with 1989FC.  For those that might  be 
    interested in the full article, it is available as ASTEROID.ZIP at your 
    favorite BBS across the country that have UFO related files. In essence 
    the  article  discusses  catastrophism  and our  fragile  existence  as 
    related to the geological record.

    From  "The  End of A Chapter?"  material from received Phoenix  Project 
    file: 
     
      But now (Daily Telegraph, April 21, 1989) we learn that our Earth has 
    just  narrowly  escaped  being struck by  a  fresh,   totally  unknown, 
    asteroid (1989FC)  weighing some 400,000,000 tons,  which passed within 
    half-a-million miles of us in March of this year! 
     
      Dr.   Henry  Holt,  the Northern Arizona  University  astronomer  who 
    discovered  this "beastie",  using the Mount Palomar Optical Telescope, 
    says that the thing had come in from the direction of the Sun,  so that 
    the  Sun's  glare  had  prevented anyone from  detecting  its  approach 
    sooner,   and that,  "If it had appeared only a few hours earlier,   it 
    would have nailed us." 
     
      "Half-a-million  miles from Earth"  mean that,  as it passed us,  the 
    size  of  the  gap separating the asteroid from us was only  twice  the 
    distance from the Earth to the Moon.

      By this time I am wondering what kind of hold that "Staff 1" has over 
    Jack  Mathias  and Richard Miller?  For Richard Miller to have  to  ask 
    permission to release this  kind of "Privileged"  information? But most 
    importantly,   this  article offers us a new piece of information  that 
    will  in  itself  cast serious doubt on the scenario that  the  Phoenix 
    Project  will  soon  "reveal",  the direction that  1989FC  encountered 
    earth's orbit.

    TOPIC: Launch abort, Mission STS-30 
    SOURCE: AP Wire 
    LOCATION: KSC 
    
    COMMENTS: The space shuttle Atlantis,  which came within 31  seconds of 
              liftoff  Friday,  could remain grounded until late next week, 
              space officials said. 
     
      Controllers  scrubbed  the launch when they  detected  an  electrical 
    surge  in a main engine fuel pump.  Launch director Bob Sieck  said  it 
    will  be at least Monday before a second launch can be tried,   and  he 
    termed that timetable "optimistic"  after saying NASA was also checking 
    on  an  unexpected "vapor cloud"  that emerged around a  hydrogen  fuel 
    line. 
     
    Note:   Both  of the above excuses were a cover story.  The  delay  was 
    needed to re-program Magellan's computers so it could track 1989FC when 
    launched, and then continue on its Venus mission. 
     
      NASA has a nice, long, launch window, until May 28 to get Magellan on 
    its  way.   NASA personnel will inspect the Atlantis shuttle  over  the 
    weekend.  Liftoff could be delayed well into next week if the fuel pump 
    or the fuel line has to be replaced.

    Commentary edited by Ed Stewart 
     
      First  we have a very not-so-subtle manipulation.  A  Note:  inserted 
    right  in  the  middle of the AP story.  Please note that it is  not  a 
    "Staff  1 note"  or a "Phoenix Project"  note,  but just a note.  It is 
    possible that a reader  not paying attention, could mistake it for part 
    of the AP story itself. 
     
      But   what   of  these  claims  the  note  makes?   It  is  full   of 
    contradictions. First of all,   there was no need to delay  a launch to 
    re-program  Magellan's  Computers.  If "Staff 1"  had simple access  to 
    NASA-SELECT  Cable  TV or if any of the  Phoenix  Project  "Operatives" 
    lightly followed NASA projects, they would know that Magellan's onboard 
    computers could be easily programmed remotely whether on the ground  or 
    in flight. 
     
      Also,  notice that the launch was stopped 31  seconds before liftoff. 
    This is  April  29,  1989.  Knowledge of 1989FC was known to science at 
    least since the release of IAU Circular 4767 dated April 7,  1989 so we 
    know that the actual discovery was made before April 7. But without any 
    substantiation at all "Staff  1"   wants  us to believe that NASA would 
    risk a one billion dollar  project  almost down to the wire, 31 seconds 
    before  lift-off  to  "reprogram"   its   computers---when  it  had the 
    knowledge of 1989FCs  existence  and the time to  do  it  for almost an 
    entire month. 
     
      Also,  remember  that  all this time that Magellan is on  the ground, 
    1989FC  is zip-a-doing away at the speed of 46,000  miles an hour  away 
    from  Magellan and the Earth going in the other direction---making  the 
    task  of tracking it that much difficult if it could even do it.  Well, 
    we  already  suspected  that "Staff 1"  had very  little  knowledge  or 
    experience as an intelligence operative,  now it appears that "Staff 1" 
    also  has very little knowledge of NASA operations,   capabilities  and 
    programs.

    COMMENTS: Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist,  said the launch of the 
              explorer craft Magellan will mark "a resurgence of  America's 
              planetary  program."   The last American probe sent  to  deep 
              space was the Pioneer-Venus dispatched in 1978.  Magellan  is 
              to  be  released  from Atlantis'  cargo bay six  hours  after 
              launch  and sent streaking on a 15-month,   806-million  mile 
              trip  of its own.  Magellan will be carrying some of the most 
              sophisticated  remote  mapping sensors ever sent  to  another 
              planet.   An  imaging  radar system will be  able  to  detect 
              features on the surface as small as 100 yards, about the size 
              of a football field. The radar will be operated during almost 
              2,000  passes over the Venusian surface,  each time viewing a 
              slice of the planet and then sending the images back to Earth 
              for computer enhancements.  Magellan is expected to map about 
              90  percent of the surface while orbiting Venus for about 243 
              Earth days, equal to a single Venus day.

      The 7600-pound  Magellan probe launched late Thursday,  was more than 
    175,000  miles from the shuttle Atlantis by late Friday afternoon.  Its 
    initial speed of 25,000 mph has slowed gradually to a cruising speed of 
    about 7,000  mph. As it nears its target in August 1990  the tug of the 
    Venusian gravity will increase its speed to 25,000 mph again. 
     
      NASA reported the Magellan was off course by a small amount, but this 
    was not unexpected.  On May 21, a  ground station will send a signal to 
    trigger a small motor firing to adjust the course. 
     
    Note:  It was "off course" because Magellan and its sophisticated radar 
    capability  was tracking 1989FC,  in an attempt to determine its  exact 
    orbit  so  its  return  and  possible collision  with  Earth  could  be 
    predicted.

      For those  of you that follow NASA,  you know that NASA  issues daily 
    reports and updates on all ongoing NASA projects. Here we have two hand 
    picked reports 8 days apart.  A  warning bell should go off.  Why these 
    two reports and not others? 
     
      Again,  we  have a very subtle deception in the above  two  pieces of 
    "Privileged"   information  provided by "Staff 1".  The first  AP  wire 
    addresses  the  capabilities of the onboard Magellan computers  and  it 
    certainly    appears that they are capable of tremendous feats and that 
    they  are,    manipulating   the reader into believing that they can do 
    anything.   But  there  is  one exception. They only work on Venus. The 
    sensor,   mapping  and   radar  devices  on  Magellan were designed and 
    calibrated to be used only on Venus and only a limited range of orbital 
    altitutes were available for  collection of mapping data.  For Magellan 
    to work and do its job,  it had to be in close  proximity to Venus. For 
    the  most  part,  this wonderful computer equipment had to  wait  until 
    Magellan achieved a Venus orbit. 
     
      In  the  2nd  AP wire story again we have the  intrusion  of the non- 
    identity  "note".  But what about its claim?  Do you recall the date of 
    its   closest approach to earth orbit? March 23, 1989. For 43 days now, 
    1989   FC  has been streaking away from us at 46,000 miles per hour. By 
    this time,  it isn't even close anymore or for that matter, in the same 
    part of  the  Solar  System  as Earth or Magellan. The "Phoenix Project 
    operatives"  and  "Staff  1"   also forget that Magellan slowed down to 
    7,000  mph.  Each  hour  that  goes  by,  1989FC is getting further and 
    further away making its tracking (if it was so)  that more difficult if 
    not impossible. 
     
      Now wait a minute? What about the off-course claim?  Yes,  it was off 
    course.  But what "Staff 1"  didn't know is that the booster used,  the 
    IUS,     is    solid fueled. With solid fuel you can not test the motor 
    beforehand.  Thus  it isn't uncommon to have to tweak the trajectory to 
    compensate    for    these   slight variations. The total delta vee (an 
    engineers shorthand way  of saying the change of velocity) of the tweak 
    was only a few feet per second,  a  very small value indeed. Which kind 
    of puts the  damper  on  "Staff  1"   and  the whole "off exploring the 
    asteroid" caper. 
     
      Again,   it  appears  that the only things that "Staff  1"   and  the 
    "Phoenix  Project  operatives"  really know and understand  about  NASA 
    operations,   comes from a cursory look at what the AP wire  puts  out. 
    Which leads me to  wonder, if the information they say they have access 
    to is not coming from the "inside", where is it coming from?

    COMMENTS: The Atlantis commander says his crew is "mighty proud"  to be 
              part  of  the first space shuttle planetary mission scheduled 
              to  blast-  off this Friday.  The countdown,   which  started 
              Tuesday, continued toward a liftoff at 2:24 p.m. Friday. 
     
      Six  hours after launch,  astronauts Mark Lee and Mary Cleave are  to 
    release  the 7,600-pound Magellan probe and a rocket to propel it on  a 
    468-day journey to Venus. 
     
      Magellan is  to reach its destination in August 1990,   swooping into 
    orbit  around Venus to begin a 243-day period during which it is to map 
    up  to  90   percent of the cloud-shrouded planet's  surface  with  the 
    probe's high resolution radar system. 
     
      "We're not really in charge of the deep space probe,"  said Commander 
    David Walker.  "We're fortunate enough to be part of the team that gets 
    to send it up there.  The rest of the NASA team will make sure that  it 
    gets to Venus and does its job." 
     
      UPDATE: NASA, KSC Release # 24-89, March 1989 
     
      Magellan  marks the first U.S.  planetary mission since Pioneer Venus 
    12   in  1978.   It  also kicks off a  core  program  of  solar  system 
    exploration involving NASA and organizations from the United States and 
    the international community. 
     
      Project  Zeus:  One of the payload experiments includes the Mesoscale 
    Lighting  Experiment,   a   NASA  sponsored  effort  involving  several 
    universities.  Its objective is to study the visual characteristics  of 
    large scale lighting in the upper atmosphere. (part of the Project Zeus 
    effort to study laser beam diffusion in the upper atmosphere). 
     
      In addition, as another experiment, "The Shuttle Atlantis will act as 
    a calibration point for a third experiment involving the Air Force Maui 
    Optical System Facility in Hawaii." 
     
      Phoenix  Project  Note:   Project Zeus -  SDI  Experiment.   Although 
    unstated in this NASA Release,  Atlantis is acting as an orbital mirror 
    being  tracked  by  the  Air Force facility  (SDI  ground  based  laser 
    facility) named in the above paragraph.

    Commentary edited by Ed Stewart 
     
      Here now for the first time we see "Phoenix Project Note",  no longer 
    "Note",   no  more  need to pussy foot around,   time  to  reaffirm(see 
    commentary in  Part 1). Ask yourself if your heart didn't pump a little 
    bit  faster  when  you read "Phoenix Project Note"? Why did it? Because 
    even  though  you  are  being walked through this, your subconscious is 
    reacting to the manipulative techniques exposed so far. 
     
      We  went  from  the initial strong  manipulative  Introduction  which 
    established  the subordinate/authority relation between the reader  and 
    "Staff 1", through a series of non-identity notes and now we are coming 
    back where the authority is once again emerging. 
     
      But what about the Phoenix Project Note? What does it really mean? 
     
      1. "Staff  1"   alludes  that  he is providing  us  with  "Privileged 
         Information",   hidden  knowledge  that NASA is  not  telling  the 
         reader. 
     
      2. Also he introduces a new player in the game---SDI experiment. 
         
      3. "Staff 1" has raised the stakes! Another sinister element. 
     
     
      But, is it really sinister?  Is NASA not telling us something?  Do we 
    really have a new player in the game? 
     
      First  of  all,  the source we are being quoted is once again  an  AP 
    wire.   Doesn't  "Staff 1"  know that NASA  releases  detailed  mission 
    profiles on shuttle missions?  Available to anyone that wants one.  And 
    if it indeed does have a  classified  DOD  mission,   it says so.  This 
    ladies and gentlemen,  is a classified  DOD mission or experiment. Each 
    shuttle  mission  carries an array  of  experiments and projects.   The 
    shuttle is often used as a tracking  target  for a number of earth  and 
    space based photo recon and optical  tracking  systems  as its orbit is 
    VERY WELL known,  and the optical characteristics of the spacecraft are 
    well  understood.  Thus many systems use it as a passive  target  test. 
    Nothing sinister here.

    Year: 1990 
    To: The Phoenix Project 
    Excerpt: 
     
    ...Start: 
     
      a) "The  Greys  are actively engaged in a wide variety  of  attention 
         diverting operations  on a world-wide scale.  Their operations are 
         to  delay  the SDI program,  and  human  counter-measures  against 
         them.(1)   The  operations  are  designed to re-direct  and  drain 
         humanities  resources in futile  attempts to deal with an  endless 
         series of new, urgent, and continually developing problems. 
     
         "Serious  events  will occur with overwhelming regularity  with  a 
         projected  peak  in  the latter half  of  1992.(2)   The  problems 
         confronting  all  humanity  are rapidly  reaching  the  saturation 
         level.    Their  enormous  quantity  threatening   to   "overload" 
         humanities  ability  to deal with them.(3)  The inevitable  result 
         when this occurs,  will be the collapse of civilized society --  a 
         prime objective of the Greys. 
     
         "Humanity is directly responsible for the greatest number of their 
         overwhelming problems --  for all the reasons intelligent men have 
         warned  about.   The Greys are using human  greed,   ambition  and 
         weakness,   and  lust for power,  against humanity.   This  is  an 
         indication of "their" intelligence." 
     
     b)  "The  alien  beings from Zeta Reticulum (the Greys)   have  become 
         aware that the U.S.  and USSR are deploying a major weapons system 
         for use against them. (The SDI, Star Wars system). 
     
         "With  the resumption of NASA's Shuttle Program,  on September 29, 
         1988, after the lengthy delay caused by the "Challenger" disaster, 
         the U.S.  has  made a frantic effort to launch secret SDI payloads 
         into orbit. This increased activity has alarmed the Greys. 
     
         "The  Greys,   know it is only a matter of time before  SDI  (Star 
         Wars) becomes fully operational and can be used against them.

    Commentary edited by Ed Stewart 
     
      Please note the added quotes, yet not one direct source cited.  Also, 
    this  alleged information is provided by not just intelligence members, 
    but  "concerned"   intelligence members.  The quotes provide  a  subtle 
    accent  of  authenticity  where none exists.   By  differentiating  and 
    stating     "concerned", "Staff 1" implies division within the ranks of 
    intelligence.   The   good   guys vrs. the bad guys. The good guys like 
    "Staff 1"  and his  group the Phoenix Project. Somewhere along the line 
    the "good intelligence  guys"  feel that "Staff 1" is somehow empowered 
    to do something about this. 
     
      But wait a minute! Why are they giving "Staff 1" the lowdown? If they 
    are really "concerned",  wouldn't they give this information to someone 
    that could really take care of the "threat"?  Not some obscure group no 
    one  ever heard of before?  Could it be that "Staff 1"  is somekind  of 
    powerhouse  in  disguise?   We know he does not have  a  background  in 
    intelligence.  We  know he doesn't know anything about NASA. What is it 
    that the "good intelligence guys" know that we don't? 
     
      But what is it that "Staff 1" is really saying here? 
     
           1. That the grays are going to kick our ass.                  
           2. That the world is going to come to an end.                 
           3. That we are on the verge of not having a leader.           
           4. That it is our own fault.                                  
           5. That the grays know us real well and our human weaknesses. 
           6. And therefore the grays are "really" smart.                
           7. But wait! The grays have a fear. SDI                       
     
      But if the grays are "really"  smart,  capable of travelling all  the 
    way  here  from  Zeta Reticuli,  using  technologies  hundreds  if  not 
    thousands   of   years ahead of us that we have no clues about, and not 
    giving  a  hoot  about  all the nuclear armaments stockpiled & deployed 
    over forty-five years,   why  would they fear something that is no more 
    than a SMART SPEAR?  Now,  I  am no Columbo. I really need some help on 
    this one folks. 
     
      But  so  far  all we have seen is subtle posturing  and  manipulation 
    coupled  with doses of hysteria and paranoia with the hint that  "Staff 
    1" might be some real "powerhouse" capable of taking us under his wing. 
    Never mind  that  so far everything he has told us simply doesn't check 
    out.   That  is  not  the point. The point is that there is no one else 
    around. Now, I  am no Columbo,  but it seems to me that just maybe this 
    "Staff 1" needs to be given a second look.

    Re: The Greys 
     
      "To delay the SDI effort the Greys conceived a masterful plan. A plan 
    to create the greatest delay possible.  A delay that would insure their 
    development of  a counter weapon and also allow  them  to  gain greater 
    control over human society. 
     
      "Their  plan was to create a major catastrophe,  seemingly natural in 
    occurrence,   which  would require the full attention and resources  of 
    humanity to cope with.  A  diversionary tactic so vast, in scope,  that 
    the  U.S.   and USSR would have little time or the resources to  deploy 
    SDI. 
     "This was their plan: 
     
      "In  early 1989,  two of the Grey's spacecraft entered  the  Asteroid 
    Belt between Mars and Jupiter.  There, they selected an asteroid (later 
    named 1989FC)  over a half-mile in diameter.  They nudged this asteroid 
    into position. Then, sent it hurtling on a collision course with Earth. 
     
      "Their well-planned catastrophe would occur when it  struck the Earth 
    several  months  later.  World governments would,  then,  divert  their 
    efforts  to  the  immediate tragic events.  The Greys  would  gain  the 
    additional delay they needed. 
     
      "The nature and consequences of this remarkable and deadly event, are 
    evidence that  the Grey's feel seriously threatened  by the SDI Weapons 
    System and that  they are  capable  of creating widespread destruction. 
    The death of thousands of humans is of little consequence to them. They 
    are  determined to subjugate the Earth and enslave  human society.  Any 
    act needed to accomplish this is acceptable to them. 
     
      "The Greys are still wondering why their asteroid (1989FC) missed the 
    Earth. They are unaware that it was diverted by (name deleted)."(4)

      Excuse me one moment "Staff 1". Did you say they nudged it into place 
    and  then  sent  it hurtling towards Earth?  I  am sorry.   I   knew  I 
    misunderstood.   MAJI and select few within the intelligence  community 
    said that.   That  makes  me feel much, much better. I have seen Mighty 
    Mouse do that on Saturday Mornings. 
     
      But  you see,  "Staff 1",  there is something that you  forgot  about 
    while  you  were trying to catch up on how intelligence operatives  and 
    NASA     operations work. It is called orbital mechanics. To change the 
    orbit  of   an   object  you have to consult Isaac Newton first. I also 
    suspect  that  a  spacefaring  race like the grays, would also know all 
    about orbital  mechanics.   Point and shove simply doesn't wash at all. 
    Also, if I recall from the earlier factual AP wires you were so kind to 
    provide me. Asteroid 1989FC approached Earth's orbit from the direction 
    of the Sun.  I  know that  is just a minor technicality but maybe it is 
    worth noting. 
     
      I am sorry. I didn't hear you.  You say to read the last paragraph of 
    the MAJI posting?  (name deleted)  diverted 1989FC?  And the grays  are 
    scratching their heads? Trying to figure out what went wrong? 
     
      But, now I am really confused. Didn't you just tell us that the grays 
    were  really  "smart"?  There is someone smarter?  (name  deleted)   is 
    smarter.   And the grays with all their might,  don't have a clue as to 
    who   (name    deleted)    is? But MAJI and a few select members of the 
    intelligence   community    know   who (name deleted) is. I assume that 
    you,"Staff 1", also knows who (name deleted) is?

    FOOTNOTES: 
     
    1. The Shuttle Challenger disaster.  Grey directed sabotage -- to delay 
       the  deployment  of  the SDI weapons system  by  halting  the  space 
       program.   A   two year delay was accomplished.  This  sabotage  was 
       revealed in the U.S.  Senate Investigation of the Challenger Shuttle 
       disaster.  Expert testimony,  revealed in the Senate  investigation, 
       disclosed the presence of  tiny "knife-like"  cuts in the rubber "O" 
       Rings between booster sections.  This damaging testimony was  openly 
       revealed in the televised Senate hearing. However, the source of the 
       sabotage was not revealed and the subject was quickly changed. 
     
       MAJI  determined  the sabotage was carried out by  an  inspector  at 
       Morton- Thiokol's Utah plant and by a contractor's worker at Kennedy 
       Space   Center.   MAJI  investigators,   later,   apprehended   both 
       individuals.   Examination  and interrogation revealed that both had 
       "implants" and were  under the Grey's mental control.  Both men have 
       disappeared from public view.

      I  used  to  work  on the STS program as well  as  Art  Bozlee,   the 
    Aerospace Science SYSOPS on Genie where most  of this information comes 
    from.   If the Challenger accident was an act of sabotage why are there 
    NO  records  of  the committee meetings?  Even secret testimony  has  a 
    public date. The dates are a matter of public record.  Only the records 
    would be secret.  The  fact  the  Senate met to investigate  Challenger 
    would be  in  the public  record.  All the meetings are known,  and the 
    record is in the public  domain through the Congressional Record. There 
    was no secret testimony. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. 
     
      There were cuts in some of the SRB O-rings caused by hot gas  erosion 
    that  look  much like they were made with a blade,  but  they  are  the 
    result   of   the lousy design of the system and the fact the cuts only 
    showed up  when  the  rings were cold. If the O-rings got cold and they 
    were flexed as  they  would be when the Shuttle SRBs ignite the brittle 
    O-ring material literally  cracks with a hard, clean edge that looks to 
    the naked eye as if it were made with a knife. 
     
      Electron microscopy shows a quite different picture on the very small 
    scale,   thus  we  can tell if the O-ring was cut or was  broken.   The 
    Challenger  0-rings were broken.  There is no evidence  that  suggests, 
    even for a milisecond,  that sabotage was a factor in the accident. And 
    yes, that aspect of it was investigated quite completely. 
     
      Apparently what  MAJI  also  doesn't know  is  that  the  O-rings are 
    installed  in Florida,  not Utah.  An inspector in Utah could not  have 
    done the deed if he wanted to.

    2. The  recent  "catastrophic"  weather events (examples of the  Grey's 
       technological prowess)  i.e.,  the two recent Hurricanes devastating 
       Florida,  Louisiana,  and Hawaii.  In addition,  consider the recent 
       diversionary  and attention demanding events in Germany,  the  USSR, 
       Yugoslavia, the Persian Gulf and Somalia. The Grey's timetable is on 
       schedule.   The number of controlled Humans exceeds one third of the 
       Earth's  population,  based on current intelligence estimates.  With 
       this  number  of  pawns,   under their  control,   they  can  create 
       diversions where ever they choose.

      Excuse  me  "Staff-1",  if what you say is true and the grays are  in 
    such control,  why would they have to skip-a-doo to the barrios between 
    Mars  and  Jupiter  to nudge a rock our way that would  only  create  a 
    crater      10 miles wide? And whose current intelligence estimates? It 
    wouldn't be  MAJI by any chance, the same folks that don't know that O- 
    rings are installed in Florida, not Utah?

    3. Current  relief  efforts  are being  strained  to  existing  limits. 
       "Overload," is close at hand.  The monetary expense to pay for same, 
       could  soon  bankrupt  the U.S.  and the world  economic  community. 
       Should  one or more additional major disasters occur before the  end 
       of 1992  i.e.,  a  major earthquake,  7.5  or greater,  in a heavily 
       populated area,  another devastating hurricane,  an asteroid strike, 
       etc., economic and social collapse is foreseen.  The Greys will have 
       achieved their objectives.

      Did  everyone  pay close attention as to  when  "Staff-1"   discourse 
    turned  from  an  appearance of presenting verifiable facts  to  wantom 
    hysteria and paranoia? Did everyone notice a steady declining rate from 
    the rational to the irrational? 
     
      Staff-1? Who is doing the foreseeing?  So far you have demonstrated a 
    lack of knowledge of intelligence procedures,  NASA operations, orbital 
    mechanics,   and you have an association with a group of people,  MAJI, 
    that   purports    to    have investigated the Challenger disaster, but 
    obviously doesn't even know where the O-rings were installed.

    4. MAJI,   elements  of the Intelligence Community,   and  the  Phoenix 
       Project,   know that there are "other"  extraterrestrials  adamantly 
       opposed  to  the Grey's plans.  On occasion,  these  "others"   have 
       quietly interfered with certain of the Grey's operations.  Thus far, 
       the  Greys are unaware that they have experienced such interference. 
       The diversion of 1989FC is an example.

      We  now see that we have a whole team in the huddle,  a  triad,  that 
    together are smarter than the grays.  "Staff-1",  you have me  confused 
    again.    First  you say the grays are smart, then you say they are not 
    smart,  then  you say they are powerful, then you say they are not that 
    powerful,  then you say they are all powerful, and now we find out that 
    they  don't   even   know   of  these  "others" that are spoiling their 
    takeover,  even though just a while back you emphatically suggest  that 
    they could do it  anytime  they  so  wished.  Is it that they have been 
    spending too  much  time  out  between  Mars  and  Jupiter moving rocks 
    around? 
     
      You say the grays can hop on two spacecraft, position an asteroid and 
    hurl it towards Earth, that they control the weather on Earth,  and one 
    third of the population,  yet not see someone tip-toe in their own turf 
    and   reposition the asteroid? I am really impressed. I have never seen 
    Mighty Mouse do that. Who are these "others"? 
     
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     
       MAJI is fully aware of the Greys intentions.  They  have  undertaken 
       many covert operations against the Greys,  without their  knowledge, 
       while maintaining a pretence of cooperation with them --still hoping 
       they  will obtain the Grey's technology.  This dangerous charade has 
       created   a   dissident  element  within  MAJI  that  is   "leaking" 
       information   to  sympathetic  and  concerned  individuals  in   the 
       Intelligence Community.

    Commentary edited by Ed Stewart 
     
      Whoo now!  You mean that not only the "others" but also MAJI tip-toes 
    behind  the grays without the grays knowing?  And still play poker with 
    them?  A while back,  I  thought you said that MAJI couldn't handle the 
    grays at all.  So it isn't MAJI that leaks information to you,  but the 
    dissident  MAJI.   What is it? They don't know how to play poker? Which 
    MAJI group investigated the shuttle disaster? I want to know who not to 
    stack my chips behind. 
     
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     
       MAJI, to "hedge their gamble," is also trying to establish a liaison 
       with those "other" extraterrestrials, in the hopes that "they"  will 
       "bail-them-out"   if  the Greys come too close  to  achieving  their 
       ultimate  objectives.  This duplicity has not gone un-noticed by the 
       "others."   To  date,   MAJI has not achieved any  success  in  this 
       endeavor.

      These "others" sound like the ones I would want to bet on.  Everybody 
    else  you have introduced me to seems to be loosing it somewhere  along 
    the way. Who are these "others"? I called Jack right after I first read 
    these files  and he wouldn't give me a direct answer. He did say though 
    that  if  I  read  the prologue to Starwards, all my questions would be 
    answered.   The  prologue would introduce me to the "others". But there 
    was nothing in  there  that  said "The 'others' are______." It was just 
    one of your  operatives,  Richard Miller talking about Hatoon, the real 
    Hatoon. 
     
      Staff-1,   just between you and I,  we both know that  the  contactee 
    scene of the  fifties  through seventies has for the most part fell out 
    of favor with the UFO community. You don't suppose Richard Miller might 
    be trying a comeback  of  somekind?   Do you?  You know. Something more 
    palatable to the hopla that  has taken investigators away from the real 
    phenomena and stopped investigating  sightings associated with physical 
    trace  evidence on the hope that somebody with the inside  stuff  would 
    line their pockets. Something with more of a 80s-90s flavor.  Something 
    that... Naa, sorry. It was just a silly thought.

       The  Phoenix  Project  realizes  that the  foregoing  has  a  strong

       sensational  material and can assure you that it is not based on any 
       Cooper  material we are aware of.  Cooper did not supply any of this

      Thank you for the qualifier.  "Staff-1",  when you do become aware of 
    whose material it is,  I hope you will let us know. I am sure Cooper is 
    happy not to be associated with you either.

       Our  only  purpose in providing this material is to clarify a  major 
       reason  for our concern --  regarding past,  current and  world-wide 
       events,  what we know concerning those events,  and how those events 
       are being orchestrated by the Greys.  Another purpose,  is to  alert 
       researchers  to  the presence of additional  information,   make  it 
       available to them for further research,  and provide another insight 
       into  what  is  happening.  It is not our  intent  to  present  this 
       material  for  sensational purposes,  gain recognition,   or  create

           Part 12: Concluding Remarks---A Case Study in Discerment

                           A Case Study Page 13 of 13 
     
     
      I hold that the UFO phenomenon is real,  physical, interacts with the 
    environment and as a corollary, humanity on a global scale. I also hold 
    that no one today knows what the UFO phenomenon is all about. I  know I 
    don't. 
     
      It appears to me that the best way to help unravel the UFO phenomenon 
    is  by  investigating  and  analysing those sighting  cases  that  have 
    physical trace evidence associated with it in the hopes that new  clues 
    can be turned into information that will give us a better understanding 
    of what the UFO phenomenon is all about. 
     
      One  thing that is clear,  to me at least,  is that for the last  few 
    years  UFO researchers have been chasing "windmills"  on the advice  of 
    "former intelligence officers", "unknown sources that can't be quoted", 
    "members   of  unknown,   mystical  government  agencies"   and  people 
    (sometimes  associated with cults)  that profess to have one or more of 
    "these inside sources".  Please! Ask yourselves a simple question. What 
    more  do we REALLY know about the phenomenon today,  than we  did  five 
    years ago? or ten? 
     
      When I  ask that of myself,  the answer comes back with  a resounding 
    NOTHING.  Another thing that is apparent to me is that all the time UFO 
    researchers  have invested on the advice of these "mystical moles"   is 
    time  that  has not been used to verify,  investigate and  analyse  UFO 
    cases  and  reports that have physical trace EVIDENCE  associated  with 
    them. Resources available to the UFO community are scarce at very best. 
    If  you  consider  yourself  as a resource,   invest  it  wisely,   use 
    DISCERNMENT   and  above  all  CRITICAL  THINKING.   You  can't   waste 
    discernment or critical analysis, but you can sure waste your time. 
     
      A common fallacy in reasoning is mistaking losses for investment.  We 
    all  do it.  A  typical example is the lottery player,  maybe your next 
    door neighbor,  maybe you, that views all the money spent previously on 
    lottery  tickets  as an investment and that that somehow will  increase 
    the  chances on the next lottery ticket purchased.  A  loss is  not  an 
    investment. A loss of time is not an investment. Losing time on a hoax, 
    misinformation, or disinformation is not an investment on coming closer 
    to REAL ANSWERS to the UFO phenomenon. 
     
      To paraphrase something that "Staff-1" said and change it slightly: 
     
        Some people are using human greed,  ambition and weakness,  and 
        lust for power against UFO researchers (and the UFO community). 
        This is an indication of their intelligence. 
     
      You and  I want REAL ANSWERS.  We are starving for real  answers with 
    substance.   We are lusting for real clues.  We have an ambition,   the 
    ambition to discover what the UFO phenomenon is all about. Don't let it 
    become  our weakness.  Use discernment and critical thinking---our  two 
    best allies.  Don't let some people con us out of our time---a resource 
    we will never be able to replace. If your serious about real answers to 
    the   UFO  phenomenon,   as  soon  as  you   discover   misinformation, 
    disinformation,   or hoaxes,  call it for what it is---A LOSS.  Not  an 
    investment.  And take your resources---discernment,  critical thinking, 
    and time---and invest them productively,  not with the same people that 
    you already know will produce losses for you.
