                     The Universal Hologram
                     ======================


     SCIENTIFIC authorities aver that the fourth dimension is a 

concept of purely abstract mathematics, and no human intellect 

can possibly visualize a tangible hyperspacial structure.


     The natural reflex of lay people to proclamations from 

Olympus is to believe the gods without question --- especially if 

you don't know what they are talking about. If you can resist 

your Unconscious reflex to suspend your disbelief, however, your 

critical faculties will be aroused to demand an explanation. And 

you want to be told in terms you can understand; an explanation 

you can't understand is no explanation at all --- like being 

paid money you can't spend. 


     An expert can't explain anything to you unless he knows 

what you can understand. Therefore, it is necessary for you to 

tell the exegist what you know before he can begin to tell you 

what he knows. So, how do you tell the expert where you are 

coming from without drawing a detailed map of your entire life 

territory? The expert sees what you know by the questions you 

ask him. Now you may wonder what kind of a question tells what 

you know, already. The right question to ask for a 

comprehendable explanation is the question to which you already 

know the answer; any other question will elicit a reply that can 

only confuse the matter. You can prove the practicality of this 

tactic by observing what happens every time your child asks a 

question without knowing what he is talking about. If you can't 

think of a question that you can answer immediately, ask a 

question for which you know how to find the answer. You can 

always find the answer to your question if you ask what the 

mystery does and what you can do about it? Directions you can 

understand but cannot implement mean that the matter is of no 

concern to you, so you are only wasting your time by investing 

more than idle curiosity. Anyone who can't give you directions 

you can follow doesn't know what you are talking about, and 

probably doesn't know what he is talking about, either, so you 

are only wasting your curiosity, never mind your belief. The 

main importance of knowing the answer when asking questions is 

that you also know when you are being answered truthfully, or 

you'll find out soon enough.


     Ah... so! A good question for starters is what are the 

identifiable characteristics of hyperspace that make it 

different from the ordinary garden variety of real estate where 

you hoe for a living. By strict mathematical definition, at 

least four dimensions are required in a space that can hold more 

than one (tridimensional) volume in the same place at the same 

time. All you have to do to find hyperspace is put two things in 

the same place at the same time --- and there you have 

hyperspace, already. See how easy it is to understand the 

inconceivable when you ask questions you can answer?


     Now, you are thinking that I am trying you for a fool. How 

can you put more than one thing in the same place at the same 

time? The directions cannot be followed; therefore, my own 

precepts prove I don't know what I am talking about. Trust me, 

and follow my directions.


     The professor demonstrates the fourth dimension to 

undergraduates by placing an object on his desk, then replacing 

that object with another object. This is supposed to show that 

two volumes can occupy the same volume at different times, 

proving that time is a fourth dimension. Do you see where the 

professor is breaking the rules? The mathematical definition 

specifies that two things must occupy the same place at the same 
                                                     -----------
time before the space can be hyper; occupying the same place at 
----
different times is not the same thing, at all. It is 

flabbergasting that profs have been bamboozling students for 

nearly a century without anyone blowing the whistle; anyone 

presenting this case in law school would be cashiered as soon as 

everyone realized he wasn't kidding.


     If you want to see real hyperspace, take one very level 

teaspoon of coarsely granulated sugar and one very level 

teaspoon of water. Now, drip the water onto the sugar until you 

have one heaping teaspoon of mixed solution. VOILA! you are 

looking at one teaspoonful of 80% pure hyperspace in your hand. 

How 'bout that, Mr. Spielberg?


     You will object that the water is merely filling the empty 

spaces between the crystals and the molecules of sugar. And 

there you have it. You have just discovered the principle of 

hyperspace. Genius is simply a matter of recognizing what you 

are looking for when you find it.


     You have just demonstrated that it is possible for two 

material volumes to coexist in the same space at the same time 

if they are not continuous. In other words, a continuous space 
                                              ----------
is tridimensional, but a discontinuous space allows another 
                         ---
discontinuous space to occupy the discontinuities, thereby 

answering the mathematical definition of four-dimensional 

hyperspace. Discontinuous space-time is what the Quantum Theory 

is all about. 


     The molecules of a solvent do not have enough empty space 

between them to contain the molecules of a solute without some 

increase in the volume of the solution; the amount of additional 

space occupied by the molecular intermixture varies according to 

the kind of molecules. There is, however, enough space between 

atoms for another kind of atoms to occupy without increasing the 

volume of their sum. The proof is found in gas chemistry; when 

44.8 litres of hydrogen is burned with 22.4 litres of oxygen, 

exactly 22.4 litres of water vapour is produced. When the volume 

of oxygen is chemically combined with the volume of hydrogen, 

the compounded mixture occupies exactly the same amount of space 

as the smaller volume of atoms. Chemistry, you see, is the 

applied science of hyperspace. (*1)


     A solution is not only a discontinuous structure 

manifesting four-dimensional properties, but the molecules 

comprising a solution are also so thoroughly mixed that any 

sample contains the same information that any other sample 

holds, and the information of any sample is identical to the 

information of the entire volume. A structure that contains all 

the information in every one of its parts, and all parts has the 

same significance as the whole, is called a hologram. Solutions 
                                            --------
are the original holograms and holograms are hyperspacial 
                               -------------------------- 
structures.
----------

     Although the Greeks had words for wind, some writers say the 

Greeks were unable to perceive the existence of still air. 

Likewise, hyperspace remains unknown to science simply because it 

is manifest as the oceans of air, water, and light we live in.

(SIDE-1)


      Einstein established the concept of the fourth dimension as 

a popular scientific fact, yet, he persisted in thinking of 

space-time as a continuum. You have just seen for yourself, that 

it is impossible to contain four dimensions in a continuum. It is 

the contradiction between Einstein's calculations and his beliefs 

that made him express his Theory of Relativity in words 

impossible to comprehend. Contemporary with Einstein, Max Planck 

plotted the four-dimensional coordinates of atomic space while 

continuing to express himself in tridimensional concepts. And so 

the two seminal genius of modern physics argued across the 

dimensional gap all their lives, unable to reach an agreement.

         SIDE-1                               

               Have you ever seen a three-dimensional square?            

                               
                    A square is a two-dimensional 

         figure, by mathematical definition; therefore, 

         a three-dimensional square must be a 

         contradiction of terms.        
                               

               A space that can contain more than one 

         plane structure on the same plane at the same 

         time answers the mathematical definition of a 

         hyperplane. Actually, no one ever made this 

         mathematical definition until now; nobody 

         thought such a definition would ever be 

         needed.                        
                               

               Now, project a photographic diapositive 

         slide onto a screen. The image you see on the 

         projection plane is two-dimensional, isn't it? 

         Now, project another image onto the same 

         screen at the same time and look at the 

         inconceivable mathematical impossibility, two 

         perfect planes in the same perfect plane at 

         the same time. The perfect hyperplane is 

         physically possible because light is the very 

         discontinuous wave phenomenon by which Planck  

         discovered and proved the Quantum Theory.            
                               

               Make this demonstration in school to 

         show your colleagues the five stages of 

         psychological repression when the prof flips 

         into a Freudian crash --- provided, of course, 

         that you have already decided you don't need 

         an academic degree to support your sex life in   
                                        
         the style to which she wants to become accustomed.

*1   Hyperspace can be deduced from the Pauli Exclusion 
Principle; to wit, two particles cannot occupy the same energy 
level at the same time. Exclusion is the effect of phase 
opposition. Atoms in phase harmony, however, can occupy the 
space at the opposite phase of the other. A chemical explosion 
occurs when a shock flips the atomic vibrations out of phase 
harmony, causing them to repel each other.

     MATHEMATICIANS define a four-dimensional hypersphere as a 

ball containing every point in its volume on its surface. In 

other words, a hypersphere is a globe that is all surface, 

inside and out. If you are baffled, it is simply because you are 

unfamiliar with the verbal statement. You have made hyperspheres 

all your life without knowing it by so many words; nobody told 

you that reg'lar fellas make a hypersphere every morning because 

nobody thought you had to know, so the concept was not included 

in high school family planning courses.


     Take a sizable piece of tissue paper. It is practically all 

surface and practically no volume, isn't it? Now, crumple it 

into a ball. VOILA! You got the whole hypersphere in your hand. 

The wad is all surface, inside and out, isn't it? (SIDE-1)


      Books are all surface, inside and out, and no words are so 

plane as the written word. Libraries are filled with four-

dimensional hypervolumes. Whereas oral communication can be 

processed in Consciousness as small as four dimensions, the 

written language resists reading by minds no greater than four 

dimensions. This is why Johhny can't read after graduating from 

high school. 


     Physicists are puzzled by the way some particles disappear 

at one place and reappear elsewhere, with no trace of passing 

through the intervening space and time. They say that locations 

widely separated in real space are adjacent to each other in the 

fourth dimension. The concept of wormholes is postulated to 
                                 ---------
account for jumps through warps in atomic space-time; a wormhole 

is nothing but a quantum jump that doesn't know when to whoa. 

Now, if you look at the wad of paper in your hand, you will see 

that points separated by considerable surface distance are in 

contact. You are holding a handful of wormholes. 


     If you could compress the wad to atomic density, every 

point on its surface would be practically in contact with every 

other point on its surface at the same time, making the entire 

wad into one humungous wormhole. Quantum jumps occur on the 

atomic scale simply because an atom is all wormhole. A structure 

containing every point in contact with every other point is a 

hologram. (*1)


          =============================================

               The human brain has more surface for its 

         volume than the brain of any other creature. 

         It is necessary for the human brain to have a 

         high ratio of surface to volume because the 

         human nervous system operates at a high 

         electrical potential. Tesla proved that a 

         voltage moves to the surface of its conductor 

         as its charge is raised. If the human brain 

         does not have enough surface to contain its 

         charge within its inefficient dielectric, 

         nervous electricity will arc and the body will 

         go into convulsions. 

                                
               As the human brain increases its 

         surface, the operation of the human mind 

         evolves from tridimensional activity to 

         quadimensional activity. The mental faculty 

         for fine-focus is actually splitting hairs to 

         the fourth dimension. As a focussing faculty, 

         language comes to us from the fourth 

         dimension. We have dominion over the beasts of 

         the field because language raises human 

         consciousness to a dimension above all the 

         other animals. If time is a higher dimension, 

         then we rule the  planet because we are 

         conscious of time, also; words are timed. 

         The ability of the brain to associate ideas 

         that are widely separated by a line of logic 

         is a manifestation of wormholes in the brain 

         --- so  you really do need holes in your head.                      
                               

               The TAO says that a cup holds its 

         contents by virtue of its emptiness. An 

         absolutely empty cup is all surface, and that 

         is the end to which the human brain is 

         evolving. Empty space is all surface, as you 

         can prove for yourself by simple palpation. 

         The ambient electromagnetic field is the 

         Universal Mind of God that has raised its 

         voltage beyond the capacity of a material 

         brain. Now you can see that your very own mind 

         becomes the legendary Divine Cup when it is 

         perfectly empty, and your own Consciousness 

         is the very Holy Grail sought by all the more 

         or less steined philosophers.           

                                                                    
 ---------------------------------------------------------------    
                                                                    
                                                                    
 *    Now that you know a hologram is the product of infinitesmal   
 division and perfect distribution, you understand that every       
 point-event in the universe is in immediate contact with a         
 REPLICA of every other point-event in the universe. Particles      
 don't jump through wormholes; quantum jumps are an illusion        
 created when a particle accelerates above detectability (i.e.      
 light speed) by drawing energy from another particle already       
 above light speed. When the drawn clone drops into detectability   
 below light speed, the perceived effect is identical to a single   
 identified particle that disappears in one place and reappears     
 instantaneously in another.

     EVERY time you slice a ham for sandwiches, you increase the 

surface of the meat without adding anything to its volume. 

Ultimately, your ham is all surface and no volume.  Since a 

hypervolume is all surface, division to finality is the physical 

operation that converts a tridimensional volume into a 

quadimensional surface. The single slice of ham in sandwiches 

sold on the Canadian Pacific Railway, fifty years ago, was 

shaved so thin that it was practically four-dimensional. Fine 

division transforms space from a continuum into a discontinuum. 

Fine division is what quantum physics is all about.


     The elemental substance of hyperspace is discovered by 

gradually dividing a volume until it becomes a mathematically 

perfect plane. We shall proceed with this process by way of a 

DEDANKEN experiment to discover the perfect four-dimensional 

element.


     Planets appear to be solid, tridimensional bodies, as in 

rigid,  but this perception is mistaken. A planet is an 
-----
exceedingly viscous fluid under the pressure of its own gravity, 

and it is centripetal force that molds both planets and 

raindrops into globular shapes. If a giant planet like Jupiter 

were divided into a few parts, all the segments would eventually 

collapse under gravity into balls. The plastic planet is actually 

a mixture of molecules in more or less solution, and you have 

just proven that a solution has more than three dimensions, 

although not quite four. Life as we know it, and everything in 

it, is in between three dimensions and four.


     If one of the planetary segments were subdivided 

progressively, a critical size would be attained when the 

cohesion of the material exceeds the force of its gravity so 

that it won't collapse into a ball. At this critical size, the 

planet becomes transformed into a chunk. Subplanetary debris is 

the nearest thing we have to ideal (tridimensional) volumes that 

will congregate by their mutual gravitational attraction. 

Trispace is the proper province of gravity, and it is by gravity 

that the trispacial world is described. 


     Dividing the planetary chunk into smaller pieces does not 

produce a congregation of smaller chunks as one may expect from 

a general understanding of gravity; up to a certain distance, 

minute chunks effectively repel each other. Over the course 

of time and continued subdivision, the chunks become a belt of 

cometary debris extending around the entire length of the orbit. 

This observed phenomenon reveals that subdivision of a material 

body to a critical size releases a seemingly mutually repelling 

force that eventually overcomes gravity. (*1)  As trispace is 

gradually converted into hyperspace by dividing chunks into 

crystals, electromagnetic forces become manifest until gravity 

is supervened. Quadspace is the proper province of the 

electromagnetic field which defines it.


     Subdivision of a chunk eventually reaches another critical 

size where individual crystals are defined. When the elemental 

crystal is divided, it ceases to be a crystal by reduction to a 

clump of molecules. The molecular clump can be divided until a 

single molecule remains. At this critical size, one more cut 

destroys the molecule into free radicals. After the radicals are 

sectored into electrically active atoms, the next cut demolishes 

the atom into particles. Eventually all particles are reduced to 

electrons; the electron is pure electricity. Notice that the 

electrical force and particle velocity increases inversely with 

size.


     The final sectioning transforms the massless volume of the 

electron into photons. A photon is defined by mathematical 

physicists as a plane particle. (SIDE-1) In other words, a 
                -----
photon is all surface with no volume. When a tridimensional 

space is subdivided into its elemental photons, all of its 

volume is reduced to an infinite surface. At this point, the 

space is wholly transformed from three dimensions to four. (*2)               


     The empty space of the universe is chock full of nothing 

but photons. Therefore, empty space is absolutely pure, 

hypersolid, Grade A, Government Inspected hyperspace.


      Four-dimensional structures manifest merely two dimensions 

in trispace (*3); all surfaces are the two-dimensional 

projections into material form of four-dimensional empty space. 

All surfaces are planes. All planes are pure energy. All energy 

is carried by photons. Photons are the agents of all 

transformation and transmutation. Therefore, all activity, 

chemistry, electricity, and change occurs on interfacing 

surfaces; this is why chemical reactions are accelerated by fine 

division. The geometry of energy is the mathematics of alchemy.


     When Einstein proved that time stops at light speed, the 

corollary that light speed is equivalent to infinite velocity 

also proves that light speed brings everything in the universe 

into immediate contact at the same time. Since the electro-

magnetic field has light speed, every part of it is everywhere 

at once. In other words, all space everywhere satisfies the 

definition of a hyperspacial hologram and everything in the 

universe is in intimate contact with everything else through 

cosmic wormholes. Since the atom is a part of the universal 

hologram, every atom must contain all the information of the 

entire universe. No wonder there is no end to subatomic 

particles.


     Correlative with progressive subdivision, the velocities, 

frequencies, and energy levels of parts and particles increase 

inversely as an exponential function of size. When subdivision 

of a tridimensional material body reaches finality by total 

conversion of volume into plane, material is entirely 

transformed into pure radiant photonic energy defined by the 

velocity of light. (*4) In other words, hyperspace is nothing 

but pure, kinetic energy. The higher dimensions of hyperspace 

are the very dimensions of energy already measured, plotted, and 

equated by physicists and engineers since Newton wrote his 

PRINCIPIA.


     The same equations that accelerate velocity as an inverse 

exponential function of size also prove that size is diminished 

as an exponential inverse function of velocity. In other words, 

size is reduced by accelerated velocity. As a result, a star 

decreases in size inversely with increase in mass until it 

disappears into atomic dimensions upon collapse into the 

hyperlight zone of a Black Hole. Conversely, a photon grows to 

infinite size as it decelerates from light speed. (*5)


     Einstein used the equations of the Fitzgerald Contraction 

to prove that extension is lost on the axis of travel as a 

function of accelerated velocity until a structure is squeezed 

into a plane at light speed; plane photons is the result of that 

Fitzgerald Contraction. (SIDE-1) From our perspective, Lorentz 

Transformations occur instantaneously above light speed; 

immediately over the time barrier at the light limit, the plane 

contracts into a line and the line collapses into a superdense 

point. The lines are probably manifest as String Theory and the 

points are particles composing the strings.

          =============================================

SIDE-1

               The rear end of a racing car crosses the 

         finish line after the front end. From the 

         velocity of the car and the temporal interval 

         between the front and rear ends, the length of 

         the car can be calculated; only professional 

         mathematicians would conceive of such a 

         complicated way to measure the overall length. 

         The front end of a bullet enters a target 

         ahead of the back end. From the velocity of 

         the bullet and the temporal interval between 

         the front and rear ends, the length of the 

         bullet can be calculated. The bullet, however, 

         travels much faster than a car, and a bullet 

         is also much smaller. It is considerably more 

         difficult, therefore, to measure the temporal 

         interval with any significant precision; for 

         all practical purposes, the rear end of a 

         bullet reaches the target in the same instant 

         as the front end. When dealing with a particle 

         as small as a photon travelling at light 

         speed, it is physically impossible to detect 

         any temporal difference between its bow and 

         stern. Therefore, for all mathematical 

         purposes, both leading and trailing surfaces 

         of the photon pass the measuring point in the 

         same instant. Mathematically, it is possible 

         for two separated surfaces to occupy the same 

         point in space at the same instant of time 

         only at infinite velocity; as a consequence, 

         light speed is mathematically equivalent to 

         infinite velocity. Since four dimensions of 

         space are required for two volumes to occupy 

         the same location at the same instant, it 

         follows that acceleration to light speed 

         expands the spacial extension of a structure 

         from three dimensions to four. Conversely, 

         (*3) it is possible for the trailing end of a 

         particle travelling at a finite velocity to 

         pass the measuring point in the same instant 

         as the leading end only if there is no 

         distance between the two ends. A perfect plane 

         is the only mathematical structure without 

         any distance between its front and its rear. 

         Since a plane has no extension in the third 

         dimension, it is mathematically possible to 

         lay an indefinite number of planes in the same 

         plane. And that is why planes answer the 

         definition of  hyperspace. Furthermore, the 

         elimination of capacity makes it impossible 

         for a plane to carry any mass, and that is why 

         photons are massless, plane particles. No mass 

         or extension is lost by acceleration; the 

         Fitzgerald Contraction is merely a 

         mathematical illusion produced by the limits 

         of precision. So now you know what the 

         mysterious Fitzgerald Contraction is all 

         about. A child can understand it easily, but 

         professional mathematicians can confuse the 

         obvious beyond the comprehension of a 

         Philadelphia lawyer.  


---------------------------------------------------------------


*1    The mutually repelling feature of small bodies produces the 
illusion perceived as the mysterious "Fifth Force". This 
illusion is produced when the proper velocity of particles/
bodies exceeds the orbital velocity defined by their positions 
in their field. Collisions among congregated bodies in orbit 
exchange velocity to produce a gradual separation.


---------------------------------------------------------------


*2    Whereas the electrically inert, gravitically active chunk 
defines the quintessential third dimension, the electromagnetic 
but massless photon defines the exact plane of the fourth dimension. 

     During its growth, the gravitic field of a star is 
supervened by its electromagnetic field. When a star collapses 
into a Black Hole, all its manifest gravitic features condense 
into the electromagnetic force.  A star that collapses into a 
Black Hole assumes atomic dimensions; the cosmic Black Hole is 
nothing but a glorified atom. Thus, the third dimension spans 
the space between quadimensional Black Holes defined by the atom 
and the quadimensional Black Holes of stars.


---------------------------------------------------------------


*3   The same mathematics that prove a photon at light speed to 
be a plane is extrapolated to prove that a particle's trailing 
end gets ahead of its leading end when exceeding light-speed, to 
produce reversal of extension on the axis of travel and reversal 
of time. In other words, hyperlight speed transforms a structure 
into its negative. As a practical consequence, orbitting bodies 
are experimentally proven to precess in time as Einstein 
calculated correctly.

     The negative of solid material is mathematically emptier 
than the perfect vacuum, and that is why a hyperspacial 
structure can contain an indefinite number of trispacial 
stuctures in the same space at the same time. 

     All fields have hyperlight centres, which is why all 
fields suck. All fields are glorified Bournelli Force.

     Field repulsion is defined wherever the velocity separating 
particles is less than light speed, but greater than zero. Thus, 
we find that mutual repulsion is reduced in both directions from 
a velocity differential of half light speed; the next chapter 
explains why mutual repulsion is defined by the square root of 
twice light speed, empirically. As a consequence, we find that 
all celestial bodies within the same scale of size repel each 
other more than they attract each other, and that is why all the 
planets maintain the largest possible average distance from each 
other, instead of gravitating into a clump. Velikovsky got 
pilloried for pointing out the mutual interplanetary repulsion 
that no astrophysicist could see. What greater punishment would 
have befallen Velikovsky if he managed to explain the phenomenon 
correctly? 


---------------------------------------------------------------


*4    A star cannot be tridimensional because it is a mass of 
free radicals, atomic particles, and blazing photons. A star is 
actually space in the process of condensing into hyperspace.


      Most astrophysicists will allow that a Black Hole is space 
concentrated into hyperspace by gravity. A Black Hole is 
calculated to be a gravitic centre of such intense concentration 
that anything falling into it exceeds the speed of light; even
light cannot escape from the interior of a Black Hole. 

     Now, if you take this information to an atomic physicist, you 
will be told that particles radiate intensely as they are 
accelerated to the speed of light. Specialists never compare notes 
under penalty of losing their membership cards, but as a lay 
person, there is nothing to stop you from putting the empirical 
fact of the atomic physicist to the calculated fact of the astro-
physicist to deduce that everything falling into a Black Hole must 
radiate with the intensity of a quasar before disappearing into 
the gravitic maelstrom. In other words, it is physically impossible
for Black Holes to be black; they must be the most brilliant 
centres in the known universe. And that is what a star is; a star 
is the brilliant photosphere surrounding a nascent Black Hole. 


-------------------------------------------------------------


*5   In a universe undergoing exponential aceleration, every 
observer experiences himself to be the One Still Point while 
everything accelerates away at a rate that increases with 
distance. Since wave strustures accelerate as a condition of 
their physical existence, the Big Bang is an unnecessary 
postulate.

     Since mass is a function of velocity, mass must increase as 
a function of distance. Infinite mass is found in atomic nuclei 
where velocities exceed light speed. In fact, all mass is 
defined by nuclear particles.

     Since velocity also accelerates to light speed at the event 
horizon, it follows that the event horizon must also be defined 
by infinite mass; astrophyicists are busy seeking a lot of 
missing mass and can't see it for looking. Since gravitation is 
a product of mass, it is necessary that the cosmos gravitate 
with accelerating velocity to the event horizon --- which is 
what the Big Bang is all about. The point is that the self-
evident can be confused beyond all comprehension, with a little 
mathematics, if you don't know what the equations mean.

     A SIMPLE demonstration will prove that all empty space is a 

hyperspacial hologram. Fix your camera on a tripod and take a 

picture through the aperture set at f/16. Then, take another 

picture after you open the aperture to f/2. You can see that 

both pictures are practically identical, except for depth of 

sharply focussed field. 


     The aperture opened to f/2 passes a beam of light sixty-

four times greater in area than the aperture closed to f/16. 

This means that each beam of light, no matter how constricted, 

contains the same information as every other beam and all beams 

put together. The only change that aperture makes is the 

resolution of fine detail. Furthermore, no matter where you set 

the camera, your pictures reveal essentially the same 

information; the only difference that perspective makes is the 

relative sizes and positions of the image details. If your lens 

could accept rays from all directions, you would see that every 

location in space contains all the same information as every 

other location; the differences produced by different locations 

are merely a matter of spacial sequence, aspects, and relative 

size. A space that contains all its information in all of its 

parts answers the mathematical definition of a hologram. You can 

see for yourself that we live in a cosmic hyperspacial hologram.
                      -----------------------------------------

     The hypothesis of the universal hologram is shaking 

scientific thought to its foundations at this time, but the 

proof has been self-evident to everyone since the effect of the 

pinhole camera was noticed. How 'bout that, Sir Isaac?  William 

Blake understood the universal hologram when he saw the universe 

in a grain of sand; art is truth apprehended directly with no 

need for logic --- so is insanity.


     Everyone has seen holograms in charm bracelets, on credit 

cards, in science fairs, and on the cover of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. 

A hologram can be understood as a moire pattern made with light 

waves. The EDMUND people at EDMUND SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTS         
                            International Operations Department

will sell you a kit of moire patterns to study. Moire patterns 

serve as moving pictures to illustrate this book.


     The hologram was inconceivable outside of a small cabal of 

theoretical physicists who plotted the mathematics since the 

beginning of this century, and a hologram couldn't be produced 

until the laser was invented to provide the necessary coherent 

waves. Without any parade of mathematics, I discovered the 

hologram while soaking in my tub, with my big toe protruding 

above the surface of the steamy water. I dare say many other 

soakers must have made the same discovery since bathing became 

intentional. (*1)


     Ordinary light can be represented by splashing water in a 

bathtub until the surface is covered with random waves. In 

contrast, a slow drip from the faucet into a tub full of still 

water covers the surface with a regular, parallel wave pattern, 

illustrating the coherent light waves in a laser beam. Now, if 

you set a firm object in the tub so that it breaks the surface 

of the water, the regular waves will reflect from the surface of 

the object, and the reflected waves intersect the regular waves 

at an angle determined by the angle of reflection. Soon the 

entire surface of the water is covered with a pattern of regular 

waves perfusing with reflected waves. The remarkable feature of 

this pattern is that the angles of intersection are about the 

same over the entire surface; remember Euclid's theorem that a 

straight line intersects all parallel lines at the same angle. 

In other words, every part of the surface of the water contains 

the same information; you have created a hologram in your 

bathtub. If it were possible to reverse the flow of the 

reflected waves, they would return to their points of reflection 

to reconstruct the cross section of the object.


     The coherent light of a laser beam functions as a moire 

screen. Waves reflected from an object function as a second 

moire screen to generate an interference pattern, like you can 

see in your tub demonstration. A sheet of microfine-grain 

photographic film placed in the laser light will record a moire 

pattern of swirls and whorls; no camera or lens is needed. The 

extremely fine lines defining wave interference function as a 

diffraction grating and a diffraction grating functions as a 

lens. When another laser beam is shone through the film, the 

rays are bent to meet at focal points corresponding to resolved 

points on the surface of the photographed object so that 

projection reconstructs the form of the original solid object as 

a ghostly image in space viewable from all sides. A real ghost 

is a natural hologram.


     Any movement while a hologram is being exposed will blur 

one wave into another to register nothing but an even light fog. 

Therefore, holograms are photographed on heavy stone tables 

firmly set on bedrock --- after consulting timetables for nearby 

railways and jetliner takeoffs, and the children are asleep. 

Furthermore, the photographic film must be at least as fine-

grained as the moire pattern in the laser light if the image is 

to be resolved. Film speed varies directly with graininess, so 

holographic microfilm is the slowest emulsion since Daguerre 

clamped his portrait sitters in a vise. The growing interest in 

holography is likely to stimulate Great Yellow Father to improve 

the speed of fine-grain film, while inventors will figure out 

ways to simulate holography by more practical techniques for

making television images in-the-round; the solution to cheap 

holograms seems to be in computer graphics.


     Holograms confound common sense because few people have 

ever seen diffraction gratings, and fewer have any idea how they 

function as lenses. Light bends around the edge of material 

particles, like you can see waves bend around your own big toe 

sticking through the water surface in your tub. Waves are bent by 

the edges of material structures because every body produces 

photonic turbulence around its surface, and turbulence retards the 

smooth transmission of wave energy. The more edges a ray of light 

brushes, the more it is bent. The amount of bending a diffraction 

grating imposes on a transmitted beam is determined by the 

closeness of lines in the area. (SIDE-1) In other words, the 

refractive index of a diffraction grating is a function of the 

concentration of the lines; the refractive index approaches 

infinity as the lines crowd together; the material becomes 

opaque when the lines touch each other to become a continuous 

area. A continuously accelerated density of lines across the 

diameter of a diffraction grating can bend all rays to the same 

focal point, like a parabolic glass lens or a Fresnel lens. A 

holograph of a lens functions as a lens. Since it is easier to 

print a diffraction grating onto an optical flat than to grind 

and polish delicate glass, Japanese are trying to solve the 

problems of diffusion and opacity in order to manufacture camera 

lenses as compact, light, and inexpensive as filters.                        


     The swirls and whorls of lines you see on a hologram mean 

that the light-bending power varies over its surface. A hologram 

is a complex lens with many focal points. A hologram can also be 

conceived as an array of innumerable lenses of different focal 

lengths, each focal point corresponding to a point resolved on 

the original object. Therefore, a hologram projects a 

tridimensional image instead of the plane image defined by an 

ordinary lens with a single focal length.


     The concept of photographic negative is imprinted in the 
                    ---------------------
mind so that people continue to perceive the hologram as a 

negative image even though there is no image on the film. As a 

consequence, watching a hologram being cut into several pieces 

with each piece containing the entire image is utterly baffling, 

demonstrating as it does that Aristotle's Three Laws of Logic 

are not absolutely true, but merely expresses the way the mind 

defines its perceptions. This modern miracle of loaves and 

fishes is also self-evidently simple when you think about what 

you actually see instead of see what you think you see.


     A hologram is not a pictorial image, but an array of lenses 

that projects the same image from any light. You can see how a 

hologram works by looking through a window sectored into many 

small panes. The view through each pane is the same, except for 

parallax displacement, and the view is complete no matter how 

small the pane. Likewise, you will find the same view through 

each lens in an array. A hologram is composed of millions of 

lens-like panes, mixed as thoroughly as gas molecules in the 

atmosphere. Since every part of a hologram has an equal sampling 

of replicated lenses, it is obvious that each part must project 

the same picture in its entirety. As a hologram is reduced in 

size, however, the number of lenses it contains is reduced, and 

the holograph becomes fuzzy when there are insufficient lenses 

to resolve each point in the image, uniquely. (*2)


     The universal hologram is composed of points in a volume 

rather than lines on a film plane. Every particle in the cosmos 

functions as a point in a voluminous diffraction grating, bending 

light as Einstein calculated the curve of waves around the Sun. 

The bending produced by the Sun is noticeable only to 

astrophysicists looking for the phenomenon; the bending of light 

by atomic particles is immeasurably minute, but there are an 

infinite number of particles in the cosmos, and compounding 

their refraction over a few million light years adds up to the 

curve of space around the fourth dimension. Einstein's 

mysterious curve of space, you see, can be understood as an 

effect produced by the diffraction of light as it flows through 

the cosmos.

SIDE-1

               The refraction of transmitted light by a 

         hologram is produced by wave interference that 

         amplifies phases off the projection axis so 

         that the beam of light appears to turn to one 

         side without any actual bending of the rays. 

         You can see this effect in the way moire 

         patterns are turned from the direction of 

         their elementary waves. The trouble with using 

         a diffraction grating as a lens is that it 

         really diffracts light to produce the illusion 

         of bending; diffraction also produces the 

         colour fringing that blurs all holograms not 

         viewed by laser light.          
                                

               Another way of understanding how a 

         diffraction grating can function as a lens is 

         illustrated by the pinhole camera. Light 

         passing through a pinhole forms an image. 

         Light passing through many pinholes form many 

         overlapping images. The images of random 

         pinholes fuse into a blurry patch of light. If 

         the pinholes are spaced at regular intervals 

         according to wavelength, however, the images 

         will fuse into register to form a brighter and 

         sharper image. A hologram can be considered as 

         an array of pinholes separated at wave length 

         intervals.               


---------------------------------------------------------------


*1    Itshak Bentov, author of Stalking_The_Wild_Pendulum and 
A_Co(s)mic_Book, discovered the principle of the hologram in a 
similar observation. If Diogenes had any water in his tub, he may 
have been the first Western philosopher to discover the 
structure of the universe.

---------------------------------------------------------------


*2    A hologram is to a picture what a shape program is to a bit-
mapped picture in computer graphics. A hologram is the digital 
code turning ANY light into pictures like a Compact Disc turns ANY 
electrical current into music.

     WHERE a current of water meets an opposing current, a bar 

or tidal rip is raised. The water in a opposed wave cycles, but 

the opposed wave does not travel; it remains raised in one spot 

as a standing-wave.
     -------------

     A cup of coffee on board a motor vessel or railway car 

manifests a pattern of concentric, annular standing-waves on its 

surface. These rings are raised by vibrations radiating from the 

walls of the cup to the centre, whence they continue until 

they strike the opposite wall and are reflected to repeat the 

cycle. The wavelengths which meet each other in exact phase 

congruence generate the standing-wave pattern; the other 

vibrations do not interfere with each other. In other words, the 

standing-waves are a wave/phase interference pattern similar to 

a moire pattern. The molecules in the central standing-wave 

swirl in a vortex. The standing-waves you see in your cup is, in 

fact, a model of the Solar System and atomic structure.


     Wave velocity is a function of the average particle 

velocity in the medium. Like cars speeding in traffic, particles 

driven faster than the average soon pile up a resisting bow wave 

that forces them to turn. When particles are driven to twice the 

average velocity, they are forced to turn around a complete 

circle, effectively stopping most of their net travel and 

raising a wave that travels at the average particle velocity in 

the medium. Particles driven faster than twice the average 

velocity in the medium are forced to turn around a second plane, 

to generate a secondary wave flowing at right-angles to the 

primary. The wave pattern you see on the surface of open water 

reveals these orthogonal dynamics. Particles driven over four 

times the average in the medium are forced to turn around a 

third plane at right-angles to the other two, to produce a fluid 

vortex. (*1)  A conical standing-wave is the negative of a vortex.


     The plane of particle cycling is at right-angles to the 

surface wave flow; frequency is wave velocity cycling at right-

angles to wave flow. Since cycling is produced by exceeding the 

speed limit, it follows that frequency represents particle 

velocity above wave velocity. Since momentum increases by the 

square of velocity, it follows that wave energy must increase by 

the square of wave frequency. Therefore, when photon velocity 

reaches light-speed, the electromagnetic wave satisfies the 

equation, e=mc^2. And where a radiant wave meets another radiant 

wave in precise phase opposition, the photonic fluid must 

collapse into a vortex because their photons exceed four

times average medium velocity in each wave relative to the other 

to generate the matter-wave frequencies calculated by de 

Broglie. Furthermore, the logical definition of a wave cycle 

makes a partial cycle impossible; therefore all radiant energy 

must exist in quantum units defined by frequency. Anyone could 

have deduced the Quantum Theory from observation of watery waves 

without waiting for Planck to analyze the Ultraviolet Catastrophe

and for Einstein to confuse the Theory of Relativity.


     If you have followed the line of reason through the 

previous paragraph, you must realize that material particles are 

created where the photonic field constituting empty space 

collapses into atomic vorteces. Fluid vorteces, therefore, must 

manifest the physical properties of material. It is the density 

gradient of the photonic vortex surrounding material particles 

that bends light rays. If you inspect a vortex in your bath tub, 

you will see for yourself that it refracts the light it 

transmits to cast both a bright spot and a shadow on the bottom 

of the tub. A whorl comprising a hologram is a standing-wave 

vortex, and you can see for yourself that it also bends light to 

produce bright spots and shadows. A vortex manifests the 

inertia of its spin, and inertia is the definitive physical 

property of a material particle. Mass is nothing but a 

measurement of gyroscopic inertia. Physics students can prove in 

ten minutes that vortex equations are equivalent to field and 

matter equations. (*2)


     Since a hologram is defined by vorteces and since particles 

are vorteces, the universal hologram is a cosmic compound vortex 

that defines itself by the very waves it transmits. As particles 

bend light to focal points, and radiant energy condenses into 

particles at focal points, all the particles in the universal 

hologram literally procreate all the particles in the universal 

hologram. Continuous movements throughout the universe produce 

continuously changing focal points so that all material particles 

move continuously as they grow and decompose back to radiant 

energy in the eternal cycle of YIN and YANG.

*1    The paradox of the vortex is that its acceleration 
results in a collapse of volume to produce increasing density 
while pressure falls; as a consequence, the surrounding medium 
is sucked into the vortex. In common experience, natural fluid 
vorteces are ephemeral because velocities exceeding four times 
the medium average are soon absorbed by the fluid field to 
raise the average energy of the medium. 


---------------------------------------------------------------


*2     Newton noticed the congruence between the equations for
fields and vorteces, but he decided to omit the proof from his 
Theory of Gravitation, and postulated a hypothetical attractive 
force, instead, even though he admitted that it is physically 
impossible to substantiate an attractive force through empty 
space. (I credit Mr. Whamond for this historical information.) 
Einstein rediscovered the identity of field with mass in the 
calculation of his General Theory of Relativity, and de Broglie 
rediscovered the same equivalence twenty years later. It just 
goes to show that the foundations of modern physics could have 
been laid by anyone knowing the most elementary equations taught 
in high school without an incomprehensible parade of mathematics 
backed by national treasuries.

     SCIENTIFIC research is a multibillion dollar industry. 

Scientists protest that fundamental research depends on 

megabucks. It is understandable why the scientific profession, 

like the artistic, medical, and teaching professions, believes 

that money produces quality. Historical facts, however, 

contradict the professional sales pitch; the quality of pure 

science correlates inversely with cash flow. All the seminal 

discoveries of science were made with apparatus put together for 

less than $100. Using a teaspoon of sugar, a sheet of tissue 

paper, a pinhole camera, and a basin of water, you have just 

discovered the answers to the greatest problems of pure 

mathematics, physics, and philosophy that defy all the genius in 

megadollar laboratories. And it didn't take a day of higher 

education, either, did it?
