            A Seminar on MAJIC 12 by Milton William Cooper
                          November 17th, 1989


Fellow Computer Enthusiasts,                                 11-24-89



     What  follows  is  a  transcript  of  a  45 minute lecture that I 
attended  on  11-17-89  at  the  "Whole  Life  Expo"  in  Los Angeles, 
California.  Speaking  was Mr. Milton William Cooper with whom I first 
became  acquainted  through  a  text  file  I  downloaded from a local 
computer  BBS.  The  file  dealt  with  the  subject  of UFO's and our 
government's  concealment  of  the truth about them in such a way that 
it  made  a  lasting  impression  on  me,  which is why I attended his 
lecture;  to  learn  more.  Please  forgive my probable misspelling of 
some  of  the  proper  names in the transcript which follows and allow 
that  I have taken it as best I could, word-for-word, from a less than 
acceptable  micro-cassette recording.  If you are as moved by what you 
are  about  to  read as I was in hearing it first-hand, I ask that you 
please  spread  it as far and wide as possible. Upload it to every BBS 
in  your  reach  and  please, don't change anything. Also, please give 
considerable  thought  to  Mr.  Cooper's suggestions as to what we all 
can  do to see that this information is confirmed by our government to 
make them stop what they are up to.

                  Thank you, and now, Milton Cooper:


     "For  those  of  you  who  don't  know  who I am, I was raised in 
a          military  family.  My family, my ancestors, since they came 
to  this  country,  have been government people. We have served in the  
military,  we  have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,  we 
care  about this country and believe in the constitution of the United 
States.  We  know, as many people don't know, that the Constitution of 
the  United  States  of  America IS the United States of America ! And 
that's  why we've always been ready ...to   do the things needed ...to 
preserve and protect it.

     When  I  left  home  I went into the Air Force, the Strategic Air   
Command.  As  a  child  I'd  heard  stories from my father and pilots,      
other  pilots,  my  father  was  a  pilot,  about Foo Fighters, UFO's,      
strange  craft  that  were  not  made on this Earth. And as a kid, you 
hear  that  in  passing,  and it's neat, and you giggle about  it, and 
you go out and play `Space Man', and you forget it.

     When  I  was  in  the Air Force I met men who had participated in   
alien  crashed-craft  recoveries. Now this intrigued me; it interested 
me,  but  it  was usually after quite a few bottles of beer that these 
stories  would  come  out,  and  sometimes the next morning I couldn't 
remember what the heck the guy said.

     When  I  left  the  Air  Force  I  went  into  the Navy, and this 
is         where  everything  began to happen for me. I had originally 
intended  to  just  go  from  service to service and do something that 
very  few people have ever done before. I was a very adventurous, very 
crazy  ...young  man,  and  I  thought  that  that  would  be a pretty 
exciting  life.  I  volunteered  for  submarines,  and  while  on  the 
submarine,   U.S.S.   Tyroot,   SS-416,   on  a  transit  between  the 
Portland/Seattle  area  and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port; the 
Pearl  Harbor  sub  base,  as  the port lookout I saw a craft, saucer-
shaped,  the  size  of  a  Midway class carrier, aircraft carrier, for 
those  of  you  who don't know how big that is; it's huge, come up out 
of  the  water  approximately  2  1/2 nautical miles off the port bow, 
which  is  about  45  degrees  to  the  left  of the pointy end of the 
submarine.  It  tumbled  slowly  on its own axis, and went up into the 
clouds.  It  appeared to be moving slowly to me at a distance of 2 1/2 
nautical  miles  but,  in reality it was moving pretty fast because it 
came up out of the water, did a few tumbles and it was gone !

     I  then  reported  it  to  the officer of the deck. I didn't tell  
him  what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no fools and 
in  case  nobody  else  saw  it  I  didn't  want to be the only looney 
onboard  the ship. So I asked the officer of the deck to help me cover 
that  area,  and  he did, which is common for officers and lookouts to 
help  each  other while on bridge watch because they all hang together 
if  something  bad  happens. After a few seconds of watching, the same 
craft,  or another craft exactly like it, came down out of the clouds, 
tumbled  again  on its own axis, and went into the water. Ensign Ball, 
who  was  the officer of the deck, was literally shocked! What could I 
say?  Seaman  Dejeralimo,  who  was  the  starboard  lookout, had also 
witnessed  this,  and ensign Ball called the captain to the bridge who 
was  followed  by  the  chief quartermaster who brought a 35mm camera, 
and  we  watched  for  between  7  and  10  minutes the same craft, or 
different  craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave the water. 
It  was  an  incredible show. I don't know if they knew we were there, 
or  if  they  even cared, but the craft did not glow, they were metal, 
they   were   machines   without   a   doubt,   they   were  obviously 
intelligently  guided,  they  were  HUGE,  and having  been in the Air 
Force  and the Navy and knowing what it takes, I knew without a doubt, 
and  know it today, that that machine was not made on the face of this 
Earth.  Because  there's  nothing  that  man  can  make,  that can fly 
through  the  air  at  a  speed like that, tumble on its own axis, and 
enter the water and effectively fly beneath the sea.

     If  you've  ever  been  aboard an airplane and then gone aboard a 
submarine.....I  know  there's  probably  some of you in this room who   
have  visited  a  submarine at one time or another.....you can readily 
see  just.....without  even any of the technicalities involved.....how 
difficult  such  a thing would be to do. Where would it be built  that 
size  ?  It was absolutely incredible. It changed my life because then 
all  the  stories  that  I'd heard all my life I knew were true, and I 
began seeing the world in a different light.

     It  wasn't  long  after  that  I was trained by Naval security in    
intelligence.  I  was  sent  to  Viet  Nam. I was assigned as a patrol     
boat  captain,  first  in  DaNang  harbor,  given a crew and a  multi-
million  dollar  patrol  boat.  My job was to gather intelligence from 
the  people  who  lived  around  the  harbor  and  the  fishermen  who 
transited  the  harbor,  and  maintain  the safety and security of the 
harbor  and  the shipping. After about 5 months I was sent up North to 
the  DMZ,  to  a place called Qua Vieaf [sp], on the Tacan [sp] river. 
Our  base  camp was at the river mouth.     We were only 3 miles South 
of  the  North  Vietnamese border and  our job was to patrol the Tacan 
river  from  the  river  mouth  to  Dong Ha, and then up the Quang Tri 
cutoff  to  Quang  Tri  city,  again  to get to know the people on the 
bank,  gather intelligence, and to patrol every night and maintain the 
safety and security of the river and the river traffic.

     It  was while there that I discovered that there was a tremendous 
amount  of  UFO  and  alien  activity  in  Viet  Nam.  It  was  always        
reported  in  official  messages  as  `enemy  helicopters.' Now any of   
you  who  know  anything  about  the  Viet Nam war know that the North   
Vietnamese  did  not  have  any  helicopters.....especially  after our   
first  couple  of  air  raids  into  North  Viet Nam. Even if they had      
they  would  not  have  been so foolish as to bring them over the  DMZ 
because  that  would  have insured their demise. Our troops were fired 
on  occasionally by these `enemy helicopters'; enemy troops were fired 
on  occasionally by these `enemy helicopters,' and occasionally people 
would  disappear.  And  on  one instance that I know for sure at least 
one  entire  village  disappeared one night due to alien activity. The 
reason  they  used  the  term  `enemy  helicopters'  in  messages  and 
dispatches  was  that  in Viet   Nam you could be overrun at any time, 
no  matter  where you were. We did not bring crypto encoding equipment 
into  Viet Nam. I'm talking about the machinery. What we did is we had 
crypto  tables,  and once every 24-hours those codes would be no good. 
So  that's what we used. Also, because of the inability to use  crypto 
transmitting  equipment,  we  had  to devise code words such as `enemy 
helicopters.'

     When   I   left  Viet  Nam  I  was  eventually  attached  to  the 
headquarters  staff  of  the  Commander  in Chief of the United States 
Pacific  Fleet  at  Macalappa,  [sp]  Hawaii,  which  is a little hill 
overlooking  Pearl  Harbor.  It's a beautiful white building up there, 
and  I  was specifically attached to the Intelligence Briefing Team of 
the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet.

     It  was  during  this  tour  of  duty  that,  in the course of my    
duties,  documents  were  placed in my hands that were so unbelievable 
and  so incredible that it took me quite a while to adjust to the fact 
that  what  I  was  seeing  was  real.  Now for those of you who don't 
understand  how I could come to see this information let me give you a 
little  short  course in security clearance and "the need to know" and 
how  you  get  to see classified information if you're in the military 
or  in  the  government,  it  doesn't  matter which, the rules are the 
same.



                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 4

     Number  One:  you  need  a  security clearance, and you've got to  
have  clearance  at  the level that the information you want to see is 
classified  at. In this instance it was classified `Top Secret, Magic, 
Restricted  Information,'  which  I  came  to  find  out  later is the 
highest  security  classification  in  the nation. To get that type of 
clearance,  all  you have to have is a Federal Bureau of Investigation 
background  check,  which takes about six months and they send federal 
agents  to  your  home,  to your old schools, to all your teachers, to 
your  friends,  to  everybody  you put down on your security clearance 
forms,  to  all  your  old  addresses,  your neighbors, everybody that 
you've  worked for, and it's embarrassing because they don't tell them 
what  they're  checking  on.  They just show them their identification 
and  start  asking  questions  and that's when you find out who's your 
friend  and  who's  not, because a lot of people get scared and think, 
`Bill must've just robbed a bank and I'm not talkin' to him anymore.'

     Now  once you get that, it's called a `B.I.' and for those of you 
who  have  received  a  copy  of my service record, look on the  first 
page,  the  DD  Form  214 where it says `Security Clearance,' you will 
see  the  term  `B.I.'  That's  a `Bureau of Investigation' clearance. 
[Note:  The  author of this piece apparently does not know that "B.I." 
stands  for  "Background  Investigation".  CSW] Now at that point, you 
have  the  clearance  for  everything  including Top Secret and above. 
What  determines  what you      get to see is `your need to know', and 
the job that you have determines what your need to know is.

     I   was  assigned  to  the  Intelligence  Briefing  Team  of  the 
Commander  in  Chief  of  the  United States Pacific Fleet, who had to 
know  everything  concerning his area of operations which was one-half 
of  the Earth's surface; the Indian ocean, the Pacific  ocean, and all 
the  land  masses in between. Believe it or not, if we ever go to war, 
it's  the  United States Navy that strikes the first blow and attempts 
to  keep  the  enemy  at  bay  while we can get ourselves together, at 
least  historically.  Nuclear weapons have kind of done away with that 
concept, but military commanders like to talk about it anyway.

     Because  of  this,  you  have  no  conception  of  the  amount of         
material  and  information  that  an  area commander has to know. It's 
unbelievable,  and he has to keep track of this, he has to keep on top 
of  it.  He  has  to  know what's happening, he has to  make the right 
decisions.  Because  it's  almost  humanly impossible for anyone to do 
that,  they  have  what's  called a briefing team, and it's our job to 
make  sure that he has the correct information, all the time, on a 24-
hour  basis.  And  every  morning, between 8 and 9 AM, we would give a 
briefing  which  covered  everything  that happened in the previous 24 
hours,  and  everything  scheduled to happen in the next 24 hours, and 
all  the pertinent intelligence reports that we had received since the 
last  briefing  that  he  needed  to  know  and that his staff members 
needed  to  know.  Occasionally  we  would  get  messages  marked `Top 
Secret,  Magic, Restricted Information,' and it would be coded in such 
a  way that all you had were answers to questions which you didn't now 
what  the  questions  were  so you really didn't know what the message 
was all about.

     But   eventually  I  found  myself  in  possession,  holding  two 
documents;  one called `Project Grudge,' another one called `Operation 
Majority.'  Project  Grudge contained the history of alien involvement 
since  around  1936,  and it began talking about Germany's involvement 
with  a  crashed  disk  that  they  had  recovered  in  1936  and were 
attempting  to  duplicate  the  technology.  They  were not successful 
despite  what  all  these Nazi hunters   want to tell you. If they had 
been  successful,  we  would  not have won the war, because you cannot 
beat  those weapons ! You cannot  out-fly those craft ! You can't even 
think  about  it  with  conventional  aircraft.  If  Germany  had been 
successful,  we  would  now   have  a  German flag up in front of this 
podium.

     They  did  make  some  headway.  When  we went into Penemunde, we 
captured   documents,  we  got  some  scientists  [and]  we  got  some 
hardware.  The  Russians also got some documents, some scientists  and 
some  hardware.  It  wasn't  until 1947 that we were able to capture a 
craft,  a  whole  craft,  not all together but it was everything. That 
occurred  near the city of Roswell, New Mexico. There were dead aliens 
recovered  from  the  craft.  In  Project  Grudge I saw photographs of 
these  dead  aliens  [and]  of  the   craft. I saw photographs of live 
aliens.  I  saw photographs of autopsies.....of internal organs, I saw 
photographs  of  the  alien  designated `E.B.'[or Ebe] who was held in 
captivity  from  1949 until June the 2nd, 1952 when he died. I saw the 
history  of  what  they  had been able to put together [at that time], 
from incidents in the 1800's which involved aliens and their craft.

     I  saw  the  names  of  projects. I saw a project that was to fly 
recovered  alien  craft  that had been recovered intact and undamaged, 
and  some  of  them were recovered intact and undamaged, and  how that 
happened  I  have  no  idea. It was called `Project Redlight,' and was 
first  conducted  from  the Tonopah Test Range in the Nevada Test Site 
and  then  was  moved  to  a  specially  built  area, ordered built by 
President  Eisenhower,  called  `Area-51,'  code named `Dreamland,' in 
the  Groom  [sp]  dry  lake  area  of the  Nevada Test Site, by secret 
executive  order.  It doesn't exist  officially. If you ask anyone, or 
if  you write letters to the government, they will tell you it doesn't 
exist.  However, if you go out there at several places and see it, fly 
outside  the boundaries and look down and see it, you know it's there, 
but according to the government it doesn't exist.

     The   project   to   test  fly  these  craft  was  ongoing  until          
sometime  in  1962  when  a  craft  blew  up  not  far  from  the test          
sight,  in  the  air,  and  the  explosion was seen over a three-state 
area.  The  pilots were killed. They [the government] had no idea what 
had  happened  or why the craft blew up, but they put Project Redlight 
on  hold   until a later date when the aliens supplied us with 3 craft 
and  personnel to help us learn how to fly them craft. That project is 
ongoing  [now]  and  we  now  have  not  only  alien craft that we are 
flying,  we  have  craft we have built, using the captured technology,  
and  some of the UFO's that people report seeing in the United States, 
and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by United States personnel.

     That  may  come as a shock to you. We have technology 'way beyond 
the  limits  of  what  we  have  been  told.  A lot of our development 
technologically  since  the  end  of  World War II has been due to the 
exchange  of  technology which occurs in the area  called `Area-51' on 
a regular basis ...ongoing.

     When  James  Oberth [Professor Oberth] retired, many of you don't 
know  who  he  is.....not  too  many  space  people in here. Professor 
Oberth  was  probably one of the greatest rocket scientists  and space 
commentists  that ever lived. When he retired, the government gave him 
a  special award. There was a press conference, all kinds of ceremony, 
and  when  he  got  up  to  speak  he  said, `Gentlemen,' {and I quote 
professor  Oberth}  he said, `Gentlemen, we cannot take credit for all 
the  technological  developments  that we have had in the last decade. 
We have had help,' and  that's where he stopped.

     One  of  the  reporters  raised  his  hand  and  said, `Professor 
Oberth, can you tell us what other country helped us?'

     He  said,  `It was those little guys from out in space,' and then 
he  got  down  and  and  would  not comment any further. Now remember,  
this   occurred  in  1959 !  I can go on and on but time doesn't allow 
it.

     I  will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds of 
things  going  on  all  the  time.  We  are  making  rapid progress in   
exposing  this.  Since  I  have begun talking, people have been coming 
out  of  the  woodwork  at  a rapid rate.....people  who know and have  
pieces  of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it together, because 
I  don't  have all the answers. I saw an awful lot of material. I have 
remembered  an  awful  lot  of it. I have probably, in my remembering, 
made  some  mistakes,  but  I  guarantee  you they're minor ones, if I 
have.

     We  have  just  recently.....for  those of you who didn't believe 
that  the  Jason  Society  of  the  Jason  Scholars - the secret group 
existed.....we  now  have a letter from the Pentagon with 51 names  of 
the  Jason  Scholars.....an admission from the Pentagon that they hold 
the  highest  security clearances in the nation.....an admission  from 
the  Pentagon that they hold the protocol rank of Rear Admiral and are 
treated  as  such  on  any  military installation or in any government 
office.  There  are  6 Nobel Prize winners on that list ! They are the 
elite  of  the  elite  of the scientific world. They are the only ones 
who  really  know  the truth about  the technology today and about the 
real  science  of  physics because the science that we're being taught 
all  the  time......well,  if  you  send your kids to college to learn 
physics,  you're  wasting  your  money  because  they're teaching them 
stuff  that doesn't work. It's not true; it's not real. Gravity is not 
what  we think it is. There IS a Unified Theory ! We already know what 
it  is.  It's  what  makes  those  [space]craft  work. It's absolutely 
incredible what's going on.

     How  many of you keep up with Billy Goodman's show on KVEG out of 
Las  Vegas  ? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning in on any 
night  between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM. It's 840 on your AM dial, and the 
subject  every night are those subjects that no  other media person in 
the  United  States will touch with a 10-foot pole. Every single night 
except  Saturday  night.  It's the  only show that you can call in and 
talk  to  another  caller.   You've  got 3 minutes to say whatever you 
want  to say as long as you don't cuss or swear or slander anyone, and 
every night  they're helping to expose this.

     When  John  Lear  and I first said what was going on out at Groom 
Lake  everybody  said,  `You're  nuts, there's nothing going on out at 
Groom  Lake!'  The  listeners  of  the  Billy  Goodman  radio show put 
together   an   excursion   and  went  up  to  Groom  Lake  and   they 
all.....ever  since.....every  night,  they go up there and watch them 
test  fly  the  alien  craft ...every night ! The first night they had 
100  people  there. And 100 people saw 4 alien craft fly, doing things 
that  no  airplane  and  no  helicopter can do. Now they don't tell us 
anymore  that  there's  nothing  happening at Groom         Lake. What 
they  tell  us  now  is  there's  no  such  thing  as aliens, it's all 
government  secret  projects.  That's  okay  because  we'll prove that 
wrong  too eventually, it just takes awhile. Because          where we 
WERE.....it's not where we're AT, and I'm really happy  about that.

     Now,  if  you  want  to  see  what's  happening  right  now, keep 
watching  your  movies,  keep  watching  your  television commercials,  
your  alien programs on television. Read Whitley Streeper's `Majestic' 
which  is a part of the contingency plan called `Majestic' to test the 
reaction  of  the population to the presence of aliens on the Earth. I 
have  just  finished  my  study of Whitley Streeper's book `Majestic,' 
and  I'm  gonna  tell  you  right   now  that most of the documents in 
there,  that  he  says are fiction, are real documents that came right 
out  of  Project  Grudge.  It  is part of the government's campaign to 
leak  information  out  in  ways  that  they can always deny that it's 
real.  There's  only   one  thing  wrong  with the information in that 
book.....The  stories of the characters in there I know nothing about. 
What  I'm  talking about are the supposed government documents that he 
has  in  that  book.  I'm  telling you tonight they're real. Those are 
some  of  the same documents that I saw in Project Grudge back between 
1970  &  1973,  and  where  we  have wondered before, now we know that 
Whitley  Streeper  IS  working  for the government. We had a suspicion 
anyway  because  in  the  front  of  his  book  he  states that he got 
information  and  was helped by the research team of Moore, Shanderey, 
and  Friedman.  William  Moore  has  publicly admitted on July the 1st 
that  he is an agent of the United States Government, and we know that 
the others are, too.

     This  is  gonna come out, and the reason they're doing it the way 
they're  doing  it is they know eventually you're gonna find  out that 
it's  all  true and real. They're desensitizing you so that you're not 
shocked......so  that  there's  no  collapse  of  society  as  we know 
it.....so  that  the religious structure doesn't fall to pieces.....so 
that  the  stock  market  doesn't  go crazy, because these  were their 
original  fears.  Now,  there's  nothing we can do about  the last one

because  it's  already  happened.  There  will  be  a  segment  of the 
population   that   worships  the  aliens,  even  though   they're  no 
different  than  us.....they're just from somewhere else, and they may 
look  a  little  different.  They  are not gods. But there are already 
people  worshiping  the  aliens  and  they predicted this would happen 
when they slapped the secret stamp all over all this stuff.

     You   know,   there's  really  nothing  wrong  with  what's  been 
happening  except  for  3  things." [Cooper forgets to mention the 3rd 
thing,  or  was  sidetracked,  or  included  it  into  the 2nd thing.]  
"Number  one,  when  they  decided  to  keep  it secret they needed to 
finance  it,  they  couldn't  tell  the  public  so they couldn't tell 
Congress.  They decided to finance it with the importation and sale of 
drugs.  Now  in  the  documents that I read, in Operation Majority, it 
specifically  stated  that  when George Bush was the president and CEO 
of  Zapata  [sp]  Oil,  he, in conjunction with the CIA, organized the 
first  large  scale drug importation  into this country from South and 
Central  America  by  fishing   boat  to the offshore oil platforms of 
Zapata  Oil  and  then  from  there into the beach, thus bypassing all 
Customs  inspections and law enforcement inspections of any kind. They 
are  still  bringing  in  drugs,  to a limited extent, in this manner. 
Another  manner  is by CIA contract aircraft which, one of their bases 
of   landing  is   Homestead  Air  Force  Base  in  Florida.  We  have 
affidavits   from air controllers who have vectored the planes in; who 
have   made  sure that they're not interfered with in any way. We have  
affidavits  from  personnel  at  Homestead Air Force Base who say  the 
planes  have  been  met  by Zeb Bush, who's George Bush's son. We have 
affidavits  from  people  who  work  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico, in the 
offshore  oil business, who say `yes indeed, the drugs are  coming in, 
at least some of them, from the offshore oil platforms.'"

     From the audience came a clear statement, "Just say no ?"

     "Pardon?  Right!  Just  Say  No!  Well that's what we're gonna do 
ladies  and  gentlemen  with  your help ...we are going to say  NO, no 
more!  And  you  gotta do it; you gotta act. You either  gotta act, or 
watch your country go down the tubes."

     "Now,  that's  one  of  the  things  that's wrong. The next thing  
that's  wrong is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people  who 
tried  to  leak it out. And if I hadn't done it the way that I did it, 
you  wouldn't be seeing me anywhere standing or walking  on this Earth 
now.  They killed President Kennedy and during the workshop, for those 
of  you  haven't seen the tape, I will show you, on the tape, who shot 
the  President  and  why. Between '70   and '73, in Operation Majority 
it  stated  verbatim that President Kennedy ordered MJ-12 to cease the 
importation  and sale of drugs to the American people, that he ordered 
them  to  impliment  a  plan  to  reveal the presence of aliens to the 
American  people  within  the  following  year.  His assassination was 
ordered   by   the   policy  committee  of  the  Vilderbergers.  MJ-12 
implemented  the  plan  and   carried  it  out  in Dallas. It involved 
agents  of the CIA, Division 5 of the FBI, the Secret Service, and the 
Office  of  Naval  Intelligence.  President  Kennedy was killed by the 
driver  of his  car, his name was William Greer. He used a recoilless, 


                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 9

electrically  operated,  gas-powered  assassination  pistol  that  was 
specially  built  by  the CIA to assassinate people at close range. It 
fired  an  explosive pellet which injected a large amount of shellfish 
poison  into  the  brain, and that is why, in the documents, it states 
that  President  Kennedy's  brain  was removed. If  you've studied the 
case,  you  will  find  that indeed his brain  disappeared. The reason 
for  that  is  so  that  they  would  not  find   the particles of the 
exploding  pellet  or  the  shellfish  poison in his brain which would 
have  proved  conclusively that Lee Harvy Oswald was NOT the assassin. 
In fact, Lee Harvy Oswald never fired a shot. He was the patsy."

     Mr.  Cooper  paused briefly, and a lady in the audience asked the 
obvious question, "Why haven't YOU been assassinated?"

     "If  they  were  to  kill  me  right  now, what would you think?"       
Cooper posed.

     "That it's the truth," several people chimed.

     "I've  got `em right where I want `em. If they touch me, everyone 
who's  ever heard me talk is gonna be absolutely enraged  and is gonna 
know  that  everything  I've said is true. As long as they don't touch 
me  there's  gonna  be  some of you who are always gonna be wondering. 
But  eventually we're gonna bring enough proof out, and if you're here 
during  the  workshop you're gonna see an awful lot of it that's gonna 
prove to you that it's true. It's real. And it's happening!"

     "Okay,  I've tried to cover a lot of stuff, just briefly, because 
there's no time in 45 minutes to get into anything very much."

     Mr.  Cooper  then  announced  the  scheduled workshop session the    
following  day in which tangible proofs could be seen but regrettably, 
I  was  unable to attend. He then opened up the floor to questions and 
answers.  A  muffled  question  was barely heard coming from the front 
of     the  room which in essence asked, "What about all the people in 
the   press   and   others   who  were  in  Dallas  and  who  saw  the 
assassination?  Couldn't  they  tell  where  the  shot  came from, why 
didn't they come forward? There must have been plenty."

     "There  was.  We  know  that  there  was at least 18 who were all 
murdered  within  2 years of the event. The odds of that happening are 
1 in 300,000 trillion," Cooper replied.

     Again  a  muffled  question,  "Why  did  the DRIVER have to shoot 
Kennedy?"

     "Because  the  other  fools missed! There were a total of 3 shots 
fired  at  President  Kennedy,  one  hit  him in the throat and didn't    
kill  him  and  2  of  them  hit  John Connelly [sp]. The one that was  
fired  from  the  grassy  knoll  hit  the President in the throat. The  
other  2  shots  came  from  directly  behind  the  limousine, not the  
school  book  depository building, and hit Governor Connelly. Governor 
Connelly,  in  intelligence  community circles, is known as a `can do' 
man, because he took 2 hits and still kept his mouth  shut."


                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 10


     "How  is  it  that  the  driver,  sitting on the front, left-hand  
side  of  the  car  was  able  to blow off the right side of Kennedy's   
brain  when  the  bullet  actually entered in, and it would have  been 
virtually impossible..." another person asked.

     Mr.  Cooper  seized  the  gist of his question and injected, "For 
those  of  you  who have been listening to all these talk show  hosts, 
whose  job  it  is  to be a talk show host, and who have not  done any 
legitimate  research  into  this,  if you come to the workshop, I will 
show  you,  on  the  tape,  how it was done. You will see that Kennedy 
was,  in  fact slumped over against Jackie. His  head was turned [this 
direction].  It  was very simple. It was easy and you will see it with 
your own eyes."

     Another  muffled, off-mike question from a member of the audience 
inquiring  why  no  one else had come forward with the information Mr. 
Cooper  was  disseminating,  and  why  those  who knew it  had kept it 
secret  for  so  long  was  quickly  answered,  "It  hasn't  been, I'm 
talkin'  about  it  now. Bill English was talkin' about it 8 years ago 
but  everybody laughed at Bill English. John Lear's been talkin' about 
it  for  3  years  and  everybody laughed  at him. Now there's so many 
people  have  been  talkin' about it,    people are startin' to listen 
and  it's  about  time.  Because it's about time we that we quit being 
fools,  and  that's  exactly what they think we are and we prove it to 
them every day."

     Almost  all  of  the questions from the audience were to faint to 
hear.  The  next  one  dealt  with  the  alien technology and asked in    
essence,  "Hasn't  any  one  else  [other than the government] come up 
with  the  energy  technology  that  the  aliens  have?" to which  Mr. 
Cooper  answered,  "There's  been  quite  a few people who've  come up 
with  it  and they've ALL been stopped, and they'll all continue to be 
stopped.  Because once you have it you have FREE ENERGY. Once you have 
free  energy  they  no  longer  have  power over  you. You understand? 
That's why they stop it."

     Another  question  asking,  "In  the  film  of  the assassination  
which  was examined greatly by experts, why didn't THEY conclude  that 
Kennedy's  driver  shot him?", to which Cooper asked, "Examined by WHO 
greatly?",  and  continued,  "Most  of the film that you  can purchase 
has  that  segment  cut  out, and you can always tell it by the person 
running  in  the background, they'll run up to here... all of a sudden 
they'll  be  down  here... running. You  will see in most of the clips 
that  you've ever seen on television, or in the movies, or that you're 
able  to  get  your  hands  on, you'll see William Greer start to turn 
like  this...",  then a muffled comment from the audience, then Cooper 
answered,  "That's   because  they  clipped  it  out ! And on a lot of 
them,  I'll  bet  you.....most  of  you.....every time you've seen the 
clip  on  television, you never looked at the driver anyway. If you're 
really  honest  with   yourself,  and with me, you know your eyes were 
right on Kennedy."



                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 11

     A  woman  asked  if any of the alien technology was being used in 
present-day  military  equipment  and  was  answered,  "Yes, there's a   
lot  of  alien  technology  contained  in  the  Stealth bomber. That's 
right.  The  Stealth  fighter  was flying for 10 years before you even 
knew it existed."

     As  the  hour  drew  late  another question, more clearly stated,   
was  asked  of  Mr.  Cooper by a woman closer to my ears, "Before  you 
let  us  all  out  of here, there's a bunch of us here wondering  what 
can we all do to help bring this all out?"

     A   single   word,   "REVOLT"   issued   from  several  listeners 
simultaneously  but  Cooper responded, "Don't revolt. What you need to  
do  is  what  you  should  have  been doing all along. You need to get  
involved  with  your  government.  The  first  thing you need to do is  
purchase  a  copy  of the Constitution, which I know that most of  you 
don't  have  anywhere  in your house, and if I were to go  around this 
room  and  ask  each  person  what  the Constitution says, most of you 
couldn't  tell  me what the Constitution says from  your grocery bill. 
And  that's  the  truth  ! And that IS your country ! So, if you don't 
know  what  your  Constitution is, you're dead  already ! So the first 
thing  you do is you get a copy of your Constitution. The second thing 
you  do  is you learn it ! The third thing you do is you start calling 
your  senators  and  your  representatives,  and  the President of the 
United  States  and  you  start  leaning  on  them, and you tell them, 
`Unless  you straighten up the government, and unless we start getting 
the  truth,  and  I mean the whole truth, and no more of this baloney, 
this's  the           last  job  you're  ever gonna have, period ! And 
I'll  do  everything  in  my  power to make sure that comes true.' And 
then  write  them,  frequently,  saying  the same thing. And then when 
they're  in your area, in their area offices, take a little delegation 
and  go  see  them,  and  make  them  understand that they're gonna be 
living  in  poverty  because they're not gonna have a job anymore come 
election  day.  You  see,  the secret government may own the Executive  
Branch,  but  you  people,  all  of  us,  we own the Congress, and the  
Congress  makes  the  laws,  and  the  Congress can impeach the entire 
Executive  Branch ! You also have the right to petition the government 
for  a redress of injuries. So you ARE powerful, you've just forgotten 
that  you're  powerful.  You've  forgotten  that  that voting that you 
haven't  been doing every time election comes around.....that vote you 
didn't  make  has  abdicated  your  power. That vote you did  not cast 
abdicated  your  power  and  gave  it  to those who are subverting the 
Constitution and are ruining this country."

     A  gentleman  then  asked,  "What  was  traded  to the aliens for    
their technology?"

     "People and animals," replied Cooper succinctly.

     Another man asked, "Is the Soviet Union in on any of this?"

     "The  Soviet  Union  and  the  United States of America have been  
close  allies  since  the  end  of  World War II and have been closely  
participating   in  the  secret  space  program  all  this  time.  The          


                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 12

Soviets  have  the same thing we have. Yes. What you see happening  in 
the  Soviet  block  right  now is not the result of people standing up 
and   saying,   `We   want  to  be  free.'  It's  the  result  of  the          
international  bankers saying, `You tear down these barriers, and  you 
meet   the   West  half  way,  give  your  people  some  freedom,  the          
West  is  gonna  take  some freedom away from their people so that  we 
can  put  together  a  one-world  economic system.....and have all the 
power.  That's  what's  happening!  If  you  don't  believe it,  stick 
around and watch it!"

     A  dubious  woman  then  asked,  "Why  was  the  shellfish poison        
necessary? A lot of his brain was blown off anyway."

     Cooper:  "The  shellfish  poison?  If you go to kill someone, one 
thing  I've learned....I learned it real good. I learned it especially 
good  when  I  went  to  Viet  Nam.....just  `cause  you shoot someone 
doesn't  mean  they're gonna die. And if they don't die, they're gonna 
be  MAD. And if they've got a gun, you're dead. So  you want the first 
time  to  be the last time. So if you really  want to to kill somebody 
you  don't  play  around.  If  you REALLY want to kill somebody ...you 
KILL  them  ! You don't play. You make  sure that when you shoot them, 
they're  dead.  That  way they can't    hurt you.....can't hurt you at 
all."

     Regrettably,  the next question was totally unintelligible, I was 
thankful  however that Mr. Cooper had a good public address  system to 
amplify  his reply, "The first moon landing was May the  22nd, 1962... 
or  excuse me, that was the first landing on Mars.  I'm sorry, May the 
22nd,  1962  was  the  winged  probe that used a  hydrozine propeller, 
flew  around approximately  3 orbits and landed on May the 22nd, 1962, 
was  a  joint  United  States-Russian endeavor. The first time that we 
landed  on  the moon was sometime during the.....probably middle 50's, 
because  at  the  time  when President Kennedy stated that he wanted a 
man  to set foot on the moon by the end of the decade we already had a 
base there."

     "What about Mars?" came another quick question.

     "We have a base on Mars also," Cooper calmly replied.

     "When did that happen?"

     "I  don't  know  the exact date but I know the project's name. It  
was `Adam and Eve'."

     "How long have you known about this?"

     "Well,  I  revealed  it  publicly  for the first time on July the 
2nd,  1989, and within 3-weeks of the time I revealed it publicly, the 
government,  to get the American people not to listen to  me, came out 
and  said  that they planned to build a base on the  moon and a colony 
on  Mars.  Now,  3  days  previous to my speech,  representatives from 
NASA  said, `We can never have a colony on  Mars, it's impossible that 


                       M J 1 2 - P T 2 . D O C 

                                Page 13

there's  a colony on Mars because Mars is a dead planet.' And it's NOT 
a dead planet, they've lied to you about Mars."

     "My  name  is  Dave [unintelligible], I'm a representative of the 
Crystic  Institute,  and I'd like to know why it was that when we sent 
a  representative  down  to your home, at your request, you  failed to 
produce any documentation to substantiate your allegations."

     "In  the  first  place  it  was  NOT  at my request, I have never 
contacted  the  Crystic  Institute  in  my  life.  I  was on the Carol 
Hemingway  Show.  She  contacted  the  Crystic  institute.   She  told  
Daniel  Shehan  [sp]  that  I  had  just said something about Bush and 
drugs  on  her  show.  HE  called  ME and told me he wanted to send an 
investigator.   In  fact,  he  told  me  to even help the investigator 
because  he  was  new  at  the job. His name was Wayne Nelson. He is a 
very  good  gentleman.  He  stayed  at  my  house  for  2  days, slept  
overnight  on  my  couch,  I  gave  him everything I had. I never told   
Daniel  Shehan  that  I  had  any  documents  and  I  never told Wayne         
Nelson  that  I  had  any documents. In fact what I told Wayne Nelson, 
and  I quote, `Wayne, if I did have the documents I couldn't  admit it 
and  I  don't  know you from Adam, and I don't know Daniel Shehan from 
Adam  and  what  makes  you think I would give them to  you.' Who am I 
going  to give them to and how quick are they going to disappear, that 
was  my  thought.  Wayne  Nelson also came to my house with a stack of 
documents  this  thick  already  substantiating the presence of aliens 
and  extraterrestrial craft on this  planet, and they are keeping it a 
secret,  because they're afraid  somebody'll laugh at them and they'll 
loose their credibility."

     "We  need  some  patriots  in  this country, not people trying to 
make  a  name  for  themselves,  trying  to  expose some drug runners, 
because  those  are  just  the bag-men. The real crook is in the White 
House! And you can tell THAT to Daniel Shehan!"

     "Why  didn't  Jackie  Kennedy  report  [the  source of the lethal 
shot]?" asked another audience member.

     "Who's  she  gonna  tell?  The  Secret  Service  just  killed her 
husband  and  they're assigned to protect the President. Also, who had 
her children? The same Secret Service had her children at the time."

     "Wasn't  the  craft  at  Roswell,  New  Mexico  destroyed and all 
the       aliens killed?" another young man asked.

     "All  the  aliens  were  dead  but  the  craft was not completely 
destroyed. It was severely damaged; yes."

     On  an  unrelated  note an older gentleman asked, "Does that mean 
that `Alternative 3' is true?"

     "Alternative 3 is absolutely true and so is `Alternative 2'."

                                Page 14

     Then  a  man in his late 20's or early 30's raised his hand, said 
something  I  couldn't  hear,  and  was  apparently recognized by  Mr. 
Cooper, who asked him to take the podium and address the audience.

     "What  I  said  was  that  I  thanked  him [Cooper] very much for 
coming  forward  and  saying  something. A lot of my friends out  here 
know  that  I  was  involved  in the United States Special Forces, UFO 
Tracking  and Research from the years 1971 to 1975. My name is Richard 
Murray,  I  was  based out of the 71st Tac Controll Flight, McDill Air 
Force  Base,  Tampa, Florida. We were `Mobile Radar Command,' that was 
combat  and  war  ready. We could be loaded on aircraft within an hour 
and  many  times  were  taken  into  areas [to] set up radar. A lot of 
times  we  were  set  up  around   Egland  [sp] Air Force Base because 
that's  where  they  have  the  `Altered Temperature Weather Control', 
where  they  can  test  various aircraft for their shrinkage and their 
dimension  change during altered temperature. So, you know, I was told 
to  shut  up twice in 1982 and they finally threatened my parents life 
so  I  stayed  quiet,  and,  that's  when Wendel Stevens was taken off 
the       streets...  Just  like that! And I hid for quite awhile, and 
decided  to  come  back  out when I heard that you're [Cooper] of such 
high  rank  as  you  were,  and  I  felt  just  in  saying  that  your 
credentials  are  true,  and  that  what  you  have to say, everything 
you've  said  here  today,  I've heard before behind closed doors. And 
you've  really  tied  the  link  for  me  to the Kennedy killing.  And 
there's  a  few more links that have to go on with the Columbia Cartel 
and  the  money laundering. I think there's more than       one cartel 
involved,  and  they're shutting one of them down so  one can maintain 
a power, it just seems to be the way it works."

     A  muffled  question  then  came  from  someone  in  the audience 
regarding the person referred to as "Colonel Stevens."

     "Oh,  Colonel Stevens is out of jail now," replied Murray who was 
quickly  asked  another question I couldn't hear to which he answered, 
"I  sure  hope  to  hell  so,  he is a wonderful man and I give him my 
utmost  respect  and  it was one of the saddest days in my life to see 
what  happened  to  him  happen to him. But I don't care what they say 
about  Wendel  Stevens,  in  my heart you can't  discredit that man to 
me.  I  don't care who the hell you are. I won't listen to it, I don't 
give  a  shit  if  he was screwin' babies. You know... that doesn't... 
he's  not that kind of a man, I        don't care what you say, I know 
him personally."

     The  lecture was then essentially over. The "Alternative-2 and-3" 
that  were  referred  to briefly are, to the best of my knowledge, two 
government  contingency  plans and I don't know which  is which. To 1: 
Declare  Martial  Law  and  invalidate the Constitution on the premise 
that  a  terrorist group had entered the country with a Nuclear weapon 
with  plans  to  detonate it in a major  city. All dissidents would be 
rounded  up  and placed in concentration camps and the press and media 
would  be nationalized. All    this, if the information becomes public 
before  they  want  it to  or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and 2: 
Another  contingency   plan  to  contain  or delay the release of this 
information,  the  details  of which I am probably wrong about anyway.

My  own  personal  reaction  to Milton William Cooper; Mr. Cooper is a 
man  who  appears  to  be  in his late fourties, of medium  height and 
weight,  and  was  dressed  casually  when I saw him. His hairline was 
receding  slightly and he carried himself with confidence and purpose. 
Bill  Cooper,  as  he  was  called  by several in attendance, is not a 
professional  speaker.  His presentation lacked the polish of repeated 
deliveries  which all the other lectures I heard during the Expo. had, 
but  what  it  lacked  in  fine  tuning  was easily made up for in its 
content.  Whether  or   not  everyone in the audience was convinced of 
his  sincerity  I  do  not  know,  but the thunderous peal of applause 
which  exploded  as  he  concluded  the  session  spoke for me and the 
majority  of those in attendance. I am convinced beyond any reasonable 
doubt  that  Bill Cooper believes everything he said, and I'm about as 
skeptical as they come.
