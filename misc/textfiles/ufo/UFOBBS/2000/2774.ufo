      The   growing   INSLAW  software  theft  is  now   reaching   foreign 
    proportions. While the U.S.  House Judiciary Committee is investigating 
    the theft of INSLAW's PROMIS software by the U.S.  Justice  Department, 
    the Canadian Parliament will commence its own investigation. 
    
      Two  agencies of the Canadian Government,  the Royal Canadian Mounted 
    Police  (RCMP)   and  the Canadian Security  and  Intelligence  Service 
    (CSIS)--equivalent  to the CIA--are using the pirated PROMIS  software, 
    allegedly supplied to them by Dr.  Earl Brian,  a  close associate  and 
    financial  partner of former U.S.  Attorney General Edwin Meese  and  a 
    former California cabinet officer under then Governor Ronald Reagan. 
    
      A  Federal  Bankruptcy judge--who was not re-appointed to  the  bench 
    after his ruling--said the U.S. Justice Department used trickery, fraud 
    and  deception  in "stealing"  the PROMIS software.  The  sophisticated 
    software is used for tracking criminal and military activities.  It was 
    illegally sold to South Korea,  Iraq,  Israel,  Canada and Libya by the 
    United States. 
    
      According  to  an affidavit,  the software was converted in  a  joint 
    venture between Wackenhut Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida, and the 
    Cabazon   Band  of  Indians  of  Indio--an  independent  nation.    The 
    declaration  by  Michael J.  Riconoscuito alleges that Dr.   Brian  was 
    deeply  involved  in  the joint venture.  One Indian  and  two  of  his 
    companions  who  objected to the joint venture--which also  dealt  with 
    military weapons,  biological and chemical warfare--were found murdered 
    in  execution style.  That execution was reported on 20/20  by  Barbara 
    Walters  and  the CIA was named as the prime suspect in the case.   The 
    software was specifically modified for the Canadian government. 
    
      Riconoscuito stated in an affidavit he was warned by officials of the 
    U.S.   Justice  Department  that if he cooperated  with  the  U.S.House 
    Judiciary  Committee he would be arrested.  Eight days after he  signed 
    the  affidavit  he was arrested by more than a dozen  Drug  Enforcement 
    Agency officers near Tacoma,  Washington.  He was held without bail for 
    several days and then charged with a single drug count. Though arrested 
    in the State of Washington, he was held without bail awaiting a federal 
    marshal to pick him up. 
    
      He,   along with several others,  have stated in an affidavit to  the 
    court  and  to  the U.S.  House Judiciary Committee,  that  the  PROMIS 
    software was modified and sold to several countries, including Canada. 
    
      Late  last week,  Members of Parliament demanded that  the  Solicitor 
    General  of  Canada,   Pierre Cadieux,  appear before  a  parliamentary 
    committee to answer charges the RCMP and CSIS are using stolen computer 
    software. Cadieux's ministry is responsible for the RCMP and CSIS. 
    
      Though  both  the RCMP and the CSIS originally denied they are  using 
    PROMIS,   court  documents  show a Canadian  communications  department 
    official  admitted last year that the RCMP was using PROMIS,   although 
    INSLAW never authorized its Canadian sale. 
    
      "Did CSIS and the RCMP use PROMIS software or modifications of it? If 
    so,  what were the circumstances of the acquisition?  Was the  software 
    stolen,  and if so, was the Canadian Government aware of it?" These are 
    the  questions Parliament wants to ask Cadieux.  The Canadian Solicitor 
    has  indicated  that  the  Government  is  already  launching  its  own 
    investigation into the pirated software scandal. Canadian officials are 
    indicating that the pirated software sales may have helped to illegally 
    fund the Contras in Nicaragua.  Contra funding and supplies was one  of 
    the  most  important  aspects of the Cabazon-Wackenhut  joint  venture. 
    Riconoscuito  has had inside connections with the CIA and U.S.  Justice 
    Department  and  some testimony put forward states that  he  helped  to 
    launder $40  million for the Bush-Quayle campaign--that report has  not 
    been substantiated by any more than one government source. 
    
      Brian  is the owner of a holding company which has interests  in  the 
    Financial  News Network,  United Press International and Hadron,   Inc. 
    Hadron  was  the  company that was unsuccessful in buying  out  INSLAW, 
    Affidavits  on file with the court allege that Hadron,  through  Reagan 
    cronies, attempted to force INSLAW out of business after it was awarded 
    a $10 million contract by the U.S. Justice Department. 
    
      The scandal involves Meese,  Brian,  former National Security Advisor 
    Robert  McFarland,  several senior staff members at the  U.S.   Justice 
    Department,  and even federal judges. The "Vancouver Sun,"  the leading 
    newspaper  in  Western Canada,  states,  "The pirated  software  battle 
    already has been compared to Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandal."
