SUBJECT: TOP POLITICIAN SAW UFO ABDUCT WOMAN                 FILE: UFO2797



Did a high-ranking political figure witness an alien abduction in 1989?

According to UFO researcher Budd Hopkins, the answer is yes - and the unnamed 
politician has not denied the incident.

Hopkins discussed the abduction - known in research circles as the Linda 
Napolitano case - during a recent Independent UFO Network conference in 
Sheffield, England.

The politician, accompanied by two government security guards, watched through 
binoculars as Napolitano, a 45-year-old mother of two, floated out of the 
closed window of her 12th-story Manhattan apartment and into a UFO.

Napolitano was asleep during the bizarre 3:15 a.m. incident, as was her 
husband, who remembers nothing.

The lights on the limousine, other area vehicles and the nearby Brooklyn 
Bridge all went out while the UFO was in the area - apparently to ensure that 
the politican saw what was happening.

The whole thing was probably a demonstration, Hopkins says, to warn of what 
the invaders are capable of.
