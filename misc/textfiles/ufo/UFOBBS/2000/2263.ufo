THE ET CONNECTION
or "How is it done?"

How do "wake-ups," "walk-ins," "crash-ins," and humans get to planet
earth? When we [malenchen and maruna] arrived, we defined ourselves as
Walk-Ins; the previous inhabitants of these bodies walked out and we
took the wheel. But it didn't feel like we "walked" in. And we still
don't feel like it. what seems more accurate is to say that we
projected our consciousness into them [the bodies]. We are
Project-Ins. Right now, we can "see" ourselves in our energetic form
in the seventh dimension. So, for us, we're here (on third-dimensional
earth) and we're there (in the seventh dimension), as well. Indeed, we
define "there" as our true home. Part of our Mission is to manifest
the reality-base of home, here. Crash-ins, those beings who enter a
human body after the body has a near-death experience, are
Project-Ins. So are wake-ups (a.k.a., crawl-ins), masters who project
into a baby body during the birth process. Because wake-ups bear the
full brunt of socialization, it is they who have the most intense
identification with the body. But regardless of their intensity, these
identification - attachments - are hallucinations.

There are millions of masters here, all sourcing from the fifth
dimension and above, shining their Light of Consciousness through
human eyes. To round out this picture, how do humans get here? As we
have said, ETs project their consciousness into human forms from their
Light Bodies. Their Light Bodies exist in another dimension: they are
*sourcing* from another plane of reality. The human experience is more
straightforward: Spirit projects it's consciousness directly into a
fetus - there is no middleman. this doesn't imply that humans are not
multidimensional beings; like everyone else, their spirit can
simultaneously manifest a multitude of different bodies in as many
different worlds. But the one that is projected directly into the
human form is "human."

when ETs project themselves into human forms, they become human, as
well: they acquire "dual citizenship." this can cause great distress;
they've just left a dimension where Limitation was not even a concept
and victims no more than a myth. and now they are here, suffering.
*but they wanted to be here.*; they really did. they knew how really
exciting it would be to participate in this planetary awakening. (it
becomes cool after they wake up [to their true identity]). and once
they begin living as masters, they realize that *accepting the human
aspect of self is of incredible importance to the Mission.* by
integrating their humanity with their divinity, they elevate the
former and serve the latter.
