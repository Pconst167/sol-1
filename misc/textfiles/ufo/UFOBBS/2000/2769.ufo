              HOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

      The  corruption  of the bankruptcy system is endemic of  a  political 
    patronage  system  with its roots going back to former  U.S.   Attorney 
    Edwin  Meese,  according to many former employees of the Department  of 
    Justice. The INSLAW case--reported last week in the "Napa Sentinel"--is 
    a microcosm of the entire system. 
    
      As a result of the INSLAW cases, many heads in the Justice Department 
    were lopped off.  When Judge George Bason,  a  bankruptcy court  judge, 
    refused  to  liquidate INSLAW,  ruling instead that the  Department  of 
    Justice used deceit,  trickery and fraud,  he was only one of four  who 
    were not re-appointed to their jobs. A total of 132 were re-appointed. 
    
      But to show the collusion of the Justice Department,  when it removed 
    Judge  Bason  from  the bench after his ruling  against  them  and  for 
    INSLAW,   they  had S.  Martin Teel appointed to the bench  to  replace 
    Bason.   Who  was  Teel?  He was a Department of Justice  attorney  who 
    unsuccessfully argued the INSLAW case before Judge Bason. 
    
      Tony Pasciuto admitted that he was ordered to pressure the bankruptcy 
    judge  to  rule  against INSLAW.  After being  subpoenaed  by  INSLAW's 
    attorney,  Pasciuto was offered a long-awaited transfer by the  Justice 
    Department from Washington, D.C. to Albany, New York. Pasciuto bought a 
    home in Albany and then changed his testimony.  After the testimony was 
    completed,  the Justice Department cancelled his transfer. Pasciuto had 
    to commute from Albany to Washington. 
    
      Former  Attorney  General  Elliott  Richardson made  a  list  of  the 
    baffling questions of why the Justice Department wanted INSLAW declared 
    insolvent  and  why it wouldn't pay a $6.8  million settlement  to  the 
    small company.  INSLAW received an offer to sell their company and they 
    refused.  The buyer informed the company that he had powerful political 
    influence and "We have ways of making you sell." Within 90 days of that 
    threat, the Justice Department commenced its attack on INSLAW. 
    
      The  company  that  made  the attempt to  buy  INSLAW  had  financial 
    connections  to  Meese  and some of Meese's cronies.  When  the  battle 
    ended,    INSLAW  was  broke,   an  attorney,   a   Justice  Department 
    whistleblower  and a judge were out to work,  but INSLAW was saved by a 
    corporate  giant--IBM--who  rescued  the  company  virtually  from  the 
    auction block. 
    
      The  company  that allegedly made the threat was Hadron.  It has  had 
    brushes with the Security Exchange Commission, it has gone to the brink 
    of being broke and one of its companies has been accused by the SEC  of 
    fraud and manipulation of stock prices,  the company lost $4.3  million 
    in one year. It soon sunk $12 million in the red. 
    
      But  once  Meese became Attorney General,  Hadron  suddenly  received 
    lucrative  Pentagon contracts,  along with the Agency for International 
    Development.  The company was also awarded a $40  million contract from 
    the  Justice Department,  despite protests against the bidding process. 
    One member of Hadron's board was Dr.  Earl Brian,  who was in  Reagan's 
    California  cabinet  along  with Meese.  Meese was chief  of  staff  in 
    California.  The Deputy Attorney General was D. Lowell Jensen,  who had 
    competed  against INSLAW years earlier.  The person in charge of making 
    Justice Department payments for INSLAW's software--and who  didn't--was 
    an employee who had been fired from INSLAW.  Jensen was also in trouble 
    when  the Senate was investigating the Iran-Contra scandal.  Apparently 
    the  Senate  committee  discovered  a memo written  by  Jensen  to  the 
    National  Security Council warning that the Miami  federal  prosecutors 
    where  on  Ollie  North's trail.  The memo revealed  that  the  Justice 
    Department,   who  was  supposed to prosecute the  Iran-Contra  affair, 
    actually was tipping off the government in advance. 
    
      One  Justice Department official testified at the INSLAW hearing that 
    INSLAW's software could be dangerous.  Thomas Stanton testified "INSLAW 
    could  besmirch  the  U.S.   Trustee  program."   The  program  is   so 
    sophisticated  that it could trace all assets,  track all trustees  and 
    judges.   Another  Justice  Department employee stated  that  the  U.S. 
    Trustee  program  was flagrantly political.  "It was a way  of  getting 
    cronies into office. There would be 50 or 60  positions to be filled... 
    it was Meese's baby." The official also stated, "It was always puzzling 
    to me how he got away with what he got away with.   He'd do things that 
    were  blatantly  wrong  and no one would  question  him--it's  kind  of 
    scary." 
    
      The Meese program would concentrate too much power in one  government 
    department.   "It's  supposed  to act as a watchdog  over  lawyers  and 
    trustees, but the problem is it's more. It has a considerable amount of 
    power  to control the administration of cases.  When a case moves  from 
    bankruptcy to liquidation, the U.S.  Trustees office names the trustee, 
    who converts the assets,  oversees the auction,  and retains appraisers 
    who  will put a price tag on the leavings.  The U.S.  Trustee's program 
    also  links Justice and the IRS.  The thing that's a little frightening 
    about  it is that the U.S.  Trustee department sees itself as a part of 
    the  tax-collecting  function  of government.  The  Justice  Department 
    represents  the  IRS,   and the IRS is often the  biggest  creditor  in 
    liquidation," states a leading bankruptcy attorney.
