On November 11 and 13, 1989, viewers of KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada, heard an 
incredible story from news reporter George Knapp: A scientist had come forth 
to reveal that the U.S. government possesses the remains of extraterrestrial 
vehicles. From these vehicles have come extraordinary technological 
breakthroughs.

The scientist, Robert Scott Lazar, said he had worked in the S-4 section of 
Area 51, a corner of the Nevada Test Site. There, he had read documents 
indicating the existence of ongoing research on an "anti-gravity reactor" for 
use in propulsion systems. He was astonished, he said, but he was even more 
shocked to be shown nine flying discs "of extraterrestrial origin" stored in a 
hangar. As part of the gravity-harnessing propulsion, the craft used an 
element, 115, unknown of Earth, because it is "impossible to synthesize an 
element hat heavy here on Earth.  .  .  . The substance has to come from a 
place where superheavy elements could have been produced naturally." From the 
recovered craft the U.S. government had collected some 500 pounds of the 
stuff.

Adding apparent credibility to Lazar's testimony were persistent reports 
(chronicled even in the respected Aviation Week & Space Technology) of bizarre 
lights over the test site - craft maneuvering in ways beyond the capacity of 
known aviation technology. These reports are almost certainly genuine.

Lazar's tales, on the other hand, are almost certainly bogus. Investigations 
raised serious questions about his reliability. His claims about his education 
and employment could not be verified, and his character proved to be 
questionable. In 1990 he was arrested for his involvement with the operation 
of a Nevada brothel.
