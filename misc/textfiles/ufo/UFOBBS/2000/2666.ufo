    BLACK HELICOPTERS 


    There   have  been  several  instances  of  black  or  dark,   unmarked 
    helicopters in Indiana recently.   The most recent involved FI Will Ott 
    who  reported that on September 6th 1991,  while investigating some UFO 
    cases he observed an unmarked dark helicopter north on the west side of 
    Hwy  37  near Martinsville,  flying parallel to the highway at tree top 
    level for 10-15 minutes. 

    On  the  11th of September,  Jerry Sievers had two observations in  one 
    day.  In one case the chopper hovered closeby while Jerry was swimming. 

    Except in cases where the choppers are definitely unmarked and behaving 
    in a suspicious manner,  I am still skeptical.  However, I  am aware of 
    actual cases where there is little doubt that somebody is going out  of 
    their way to observe or harass UFO witnesses,  even FI's.   It  appears 
    that  some  abductees  are being monitored by someone  other  than  the 
    abductors.   We are keeping tabs on Black Helicopters on the UFO Filter 
    Center's  UFO INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY,  as well as other possible  related 
    phenomenon.
