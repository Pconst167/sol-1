OZARK UFO CONFERENCE
 
Hi.  My name is Debbie Jordan-Learner.  I'm Kathie Davis, in Budd Hopkin's
book, INTRUDERS.  I just got on P, and I think I will really like this stuff.
I noticed that there was a reference to me in B. Mullins conference report.

I really learned alot while I was in Eureka Springs.  I want to make a
public apology for how crummy I was on the panel, Saturday night.  I had no
idea that I was going to have to "speak" that night.  I thought all I had
to do was answer questions. I am very self-conscious in front of large groups
of people.

I mainly wanted to tell people about how I seem to be going thru some kind
of changes.  Intellectually, and spiritually.  I don't know for sure if it
is all related to UFO, but, I don't have any other explaination for it.  By
the way.  I found the high school transcripts that I spoke of at the
conference, and I found that my I.Q. test score was actually 111, at that
time.  That's a 30 point jump.  I also believe, that fron the breakdown on
my transcsripts, the test that I took in school. was probably one of the
same ones that I had taken for the proctored MENSA tests. I think that either
the tests that we use to determine who gets the best jobs, and the
scholorships, is screwd up, or something is happening to people like me, who
have had these experiences.  Neither one will be easily swallowed by the
"experts."

I am trying to write a book about the new stuff that has been happening to me
and to my family.  I've got about 6 chapters done, so far.  I hope that I can
sell it when I am done, so that I can get this info out to all who need it,
or just want to know.  Wish me luck.  I'm not any better writer than I am a
speaker.  I'm just doing the best I can.  I hope to meet more people like me,
on this b.b. And bear with me.  I'm still pretty green.  See ya later.
"K.D." Debbie

HI.                                                         
Several people in my family have been having little visits by little (marble
sized) ball of white light.  They whizz thru the house, and whip right past
our heads.  The strangest thing about these lights, for me, is that I seem
to be able to feel them coming before, anyone actually sees them.. I get this
kind of static elcetricity feeling, and I get real dizzy.  Now, one would
wonder if there was something wrong with me, except that when they appear,
I'm not the only one to see them.  (Sometimes I wish it was that easy, to
just be crazy, or ill.)

Even my computer has started acting up, since I began this book.  One night,
as I was typing the word "light" , My 'puter started to beep, and make oodles
of exclamation points.  I tried everything I could think of to stop it.  I
even tried shutting the damn thing off, at the power source.  I could'nt
even turn it off!  I just crossed my arms, and sat back.  After about
three minute, I started to loose my patience with the thing, and gave it a
good cussing.  Immediately, it backed itself up, deleted each exclaimation
point, took me back to where I needed to be, and acted normal again.  Then,
one night, while my boyfriend was transfering some of my chapters from
one disk to another, my book dissapeared, and in its place where some
programs that we didn't even recognize.  Now, I'm certainly no pro at
computers, but my boyfriend has been an electrical engineer for GM for 25
years.  Computers were his life.  He just about had a cow.  He says there's
virtually no way that this could happen, as it would take a variety of
commands that he would remember doing, if he had done this himself.

Whatever.  I know that this all might not sound too exciting, but the
experiences that we are having now seemed to have jumped to some other kind
of level.  Nothing as spectacular as the mark in the yard incident of 1983,
but freaky in their own right.  I have about 250 pages in less than 5
chapters, and I'm not even half done.

We've been having alot of black helichopter activity around here, things
have been missing from our home, strangers have come up to the house to talk
to me about specific details of what my family has been thru, and We've
gotten some mighty strange phone calls, too.  In the book, we'll have lots
of photos of artwork that me and my sister have done, photos of black
helichopters, etc.... I want this book to be as full of info, as I can get
it.   Thanks for asking.
                      Debbie
