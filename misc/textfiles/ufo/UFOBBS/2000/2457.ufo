Recently, Jerry Clark published the first of three volumes titled "UFOs in the
1980s," an invaluable research tool containing a host of information on the
who, where and what of UFOlogy. With his kind permission and the kind
permission of Apogee Publishing Company, we are reprinting an article taken
from that book -- Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.  In this article, Jerry
culls all of the past history and controversy surrounding the MJ-12
controversy and other related material that has spewed forth from the extreme
side of UFOlogy representing the ETH such as Lear, Cooper and others. Although
this might be considered by some to be "old news," Jerry's chronology of
events shed a different light on the players that have made up this compendium
of scenarios -- aliens eating humans, genetic experimentation and the gamut of
sensationalistic information that drove Paul Bennewitz to an NBD at the kind
hands of admitted-disinformant, William L. Moore.

EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES

 Perhaps the strangest and most convoluted UFO story of the 1980s
concerns   allegations  from  various  sources,  some   of   them
individuals  connected with military and  intelligence  agencies,
that  the U.S. government not only has communicated with but  has
an  ongoing  relationship  with  what  are  known  officially  as
"extraterrestrial biological entities," or EBEs.

The Emenegger/Sandler Saga: The story begins in 1973, when Robert
Emenegger  and  Alan  Sandler,  two  well-connected  Los  Angeles
businessmen, were invited to Norton Air Force Base in  California
to  discuss  a  possible documentary film  on  advanced  research
projects. Two military officials, one the base's head of the  Air
Force  Office  of Special Investigations, the other,  the  audio-
visual director Paul Shartle, discussed a number of projects. One
of them involved UFOs. This one sounded the most interesting  and
plans were launched to go ahead with a film on the subject.

 Emenegger and Sandler were told of a film taken at Holloman AFB,
New  Mexico,  in  May  1971.  In  October  1988,  in  a  national
television broadcast, Shartle would declare that he had seen  the
16mm  film  showing "three disc-shaped craft. One  of  the  craft
landed  and two of them went away." A door opened on  the  landed
vehicle and three beings emerged. Shartle said, "They were human-
size.  They  had an odd, gray complexion and a  pronounced  nose.
They  wore tightfitting jump suits, [and] thin  headdresses  that
appeared  to  be communication devices, and in their  hands  they
held  a  'translator.' A Holloman base commander  and  other  Air
Force officers went out to meet them" (Howe, 1989).

 Emenegger was led to believe he would be given the film for  use
in  his  documentary. He was even taken to Norton and  shown  the
landing  site  and the building in which the spaceship  had  been
stored  and  others (Buildings 383 and 1382)  in  which  meetings
between  Air  Force personnel and the aliens had  been  conducted
over the next several days. According to his sources, the landing
had  taken place at 6 a.m. The extraterrestrials  were  "doctors,
professional  types." Their eyes had vertical slits like a  cat's
and their mouths were thin and slitlike, with no chins." All that
Emenegger was told of what occurred in the meetings was a  single
stray "fact": that the military people said they were  monitoring
signals from an alien group with which they were unfamiliar,  and
did their ET guests know anything about them? The ETs said no.

 Emenegger's military sources said he would be given 3200 feet of
film  taken  of  the  landing.  At  the  last  minute,   however,
permission  was  withdrawn, although Emenegger and  Sandler  were
encouraged   to  describe  the  Holloman  episode  as   something
hypothetical, something that could happen or might happen in  the
future.  Emenegger  went to Wright-Patterson AFB,  where  Project
Blue Book had been located until its closing in 1969, to ask Col.
George  Weinbrenner  one  of  his  military  contacts,  what  had
happened.  According  to Emenegger's account, the  exchange  took
place in Weinbrenner's office. The colonel stood up, walked to  a
chalkboard  and  complained in a loud voice, "That damn  MIG  25!
Here  we're  so public with everything we have. But  the  Soviets
have  all  kinds of things we don't know about. We need  to  know
more about the MIG 25!" Moving to a bookshelf and continuing  his
monologue  about the Russian jet fighter, he handed  Emenegger  a
copy  of  J. Allen Hynek's The UFO Experience  (1972),  with  the
author's signature and dedication to Weinbrenner. "It was like  a
scene from a Kafka play," Emenegger would recall , inferring from
the colonel's odd behavior that he was confirming the reality  of
the   film  while  making  sure  that  no  one  overhearing   the
conversation realized that was what he was doing.

 The  documentary  film  UFO's Past, Present  &  Future  (Sandler
Institutional  Films,  Inc.) was released in 1974  along  with  a
paperback  book  of  the same title.  The  Holloman  incident  is
recounted in three pages (127-29) of the book's "Future" section.
Elsewhere,  in  a  section of photos  and  illustrations,  is  an
artist's  conception of what one of the Holloman entities  looked
like,  though  it, along with other alien figures,  is  described
only  as  being "based on  eyewitness  descriptions"  (Emenegger,
1974). Emenegger's association with the military and intelligence
he had met while doing the film would continue for years. At  one
point in the late 1980s his sources told him that He was about to
be invited to film an interview with a live extraterrestrial in a
Southwestern state, he says, but nothing came of it.

The  Suffern Story: On October 7, 1975, a 27-year old  carpenter,
Robert  Suffern,  of Bracebridge, Ontario, got a  call  from  his
sister who had seen a "fiery glow" near his barn and concluded it
was  on  fire. Suffern drove to the spot and,  after  determining
that there was no problem, got back on the road. There, he  would
testify, he encountered a large disc-shaped object resting in his
path. "I was scared," he said. "It was right there in front of me
with  no  lights and no sign of life." But even  before  his  car
could  come to a complete stop, the object abruptly ascended  out
of sight. Suffern turned his car around and decided to head  home
rather  than  to  his  sister's  place,  his  original   intended
destination. At that point a small figure wearing a helmet and  a
silver-gray suit stepped in front of the car, causing Suffern  to
hit  the brakes and skid to a stop. The figure ran into a  field.
Then, according to Suffern, "when he got to the fence, he put his
hands  on a post and went over it with no effort at all.  It  was
like he was weightless" (UFOIL, n.d.).

 Within  two days Suffern's report was on the wire services,  and
Suffern   was   besieged  by  UFO   investigators,   journalists,
curiosity-seekers,  and  others. Suffern, who made no  effort  to
exploit his story and gave every appearance of believing what  he
was  saying, soon tired of discussing it. A year later,  however,
Suffern  and his wife told a Canadian investigator that  a  month
after  the encounter, they were informed that  some  high-ranking
officials  wished to speak with them. Around this time,  so  they
claimed,  they  were  given  thorough  examinations  by  military
doctors. After that an appointment was set up for December 12 and
on  that  day an Ontario Provincial Police cruiser  arrived  with
three  military officers, one Canadian, two American.  They  were
carrying books and other documents. In the long conversation that
followed,  the officers apologized for the UFO landing,  claiming
it   was  a  "mistake"  caused  by  the  malfunctioning   of   an
extraterrestrial spaceship.

 The  officers produced close-up pictures of UFOs, claiming  that
the  U.S. and Canadian governments had had intimate knowledge  of
aliens  since 1943 and were cooperating with them.  The  officers
even  knew  the  exact  dates  and  times  of  two  previous  but
unreported  UFO sightings on the Suffern property.  The  Sufferns
said  the  officers had answered all their  questions  fully  and
frankly,  but  they would not elaborate on what they  were  told.
Reinterviewed  about  the matter some months  later,  the  couple
stuck by their story but added few further details.

 The  investigator, Harry Tokarz, would remark,  "Robert  Suffern
strikes one as an individual who carefully measures his thoughts.
His  sincerity  comes through clearly as he  slowly  relates  his
concepts and ideas. His wife, a home-bred country girl, is  quick
to air her views and state unequivocally what she believes to  be
fact" (CUFORN, 1983).

EBEs in South Dakota: On February 9, 1978, a curious document--an
apparent  carbon  copy  of an official U.S.  Air  Force  incident
report-arrived at the office of the National Enquirer in Lantana,
Florida.  Accompanying the document was an unsigned letter  dated
"29  Jan." It read: "The incident stated in the  attached  report
actually  occurred.  The Air Force appointed a  special  team  of
individuals  to  investigate  the incident. I was  one  of  those
individuals.  I am still on active duty and so I cannot state  my
name at this time. It is not that I do not trust the Enquirer  (I
sure [sic] you would treat my name with [sic] confidence but I do
not trust others.) The incident which occurred on 16 Nov. 77, was
classified top secret on 2 Dec 77. At that time I obtained a copy
of the original report. I thought at that time that the Air Force
would  probably  hush the whole thing up, and they did.  The  Air
Force  ordered the silence on 1 Dec 77, after which,  the  report
was  classified. There were 16 pictures taken at the scene. I  do
not have access to the pictures at this time" (Pratt, 1984).

 The report, stamped FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, purported to be  from
the commander of the 44th Missile Security Squadron at  Ellsworth
AFB near Rapid City, South Dakota. The incident was described  as
a  "Helping  Hand (security  violation)/Covered  Wagon  (security
violation) at Lima 9 (68th SMSq Area), 7 miles SW of Nisland, SD,
at  2100  hours on 16 Nov. 77." The recipient of the  report  was
identified  as "Paul D. Hinzman, SSgt, USAF,  Comm/Plotter,  Wing
Security  Control."  Two security men, Airmen 1st  Class  Kenneth
Jenkins  and  Wayne  E.  Raeke,  experienced  and  reported   the
incident,  which  was investigated by Capt. Larry D.  Stokes  and
TSgt. Robert E. Stewart.

 The  document told an incredible story. At 10:59 on the  evening
of November 16 an alarm sounded from the Lima Nine missile  site.
Jenkins  and Raeke, at tHe Lima Launch Control Facility 35  miles
away,  were dispatched to the scene. On their arrival  Raeke  set
out  to  check the rear fence line. There he spotted  a  helmeted
figure  in  a glowing green metallic suit. The figure  pointed  a
weapon  at Raeke's rifle and caused it to  disintegrate,  burning
Raeke's  hands and arms in the process. Raeke  summoned  Jenkins,
who  carried  his  companion back to their  Security  Alert  Team
vehicle.  When  Jenkins went to the rear fence line, he  saw  two
similarly-garbed figures. He ordered them to halt, but when  they
ignored  his command, he opened fire. His bullets struck  one  in
the shoulder and the other in the helmet. The figures ran over  a
hill and were briefly lost to view. Jenkins pursued them and when
he  next  saw  them, they  were  entering  a  20-foot-in-diameter
saucer-shaped object, which shot away over the Horizon.

 As  Raeke  was  air-evacuated  from  the  scene,   investigators
discovered that the missile's nuclear components had been stolen.

 Enquirer  reporters suspected a hoax but when they called  Rapid
City and Ellsworth to check on the names, they were surprised  to
learn  that such persons did exist. Moreover, all were on  active
duty.  The  Enquirer launched an investigation,  sending  several
reporters  to  Rapid City. Over the course of the next  few  days
they found that although the individuals were real, the  document
inaccurately  listed  their  job titles,  the  geography  of  the
alleged  incident was wrong (there was no nearby hill over  which
intruders could have run), Raeke had suffered no injuries, he and
Jenkins did not even know each other, and no one (including Rapid
City  civilian  residents and area ranchers) had  heard  anything
about  such  an encounter. As one of the  reporters,  Bob  Pratt,
wrote   in  a  subsequent  account,  "We  found  more   than   20
discrepancies  or  errors in the report  -wrong  names,  numbers,
occupations, physical layouts and so on. Had the Security  Option
alert mentioned in the report taken place, it would have involved
all  security personnel at the base and everyone at the base  and
in  Rapid  City (Population 45,000 plus) would have  known  about
it."

The  Bennewitz  Affair:  In the late  1970s  Paul  Bennewitz,  an
Albuquerque businessman trained as a physicist, became  convinced
that   he   was   monitoring   electromagnetic   signals    which
extraterrestrials   were  using  to  control  persons  they   had
abducted. Bennewitz tried to decode these signals and believed he
was succeeding. At the same time he began to see what he  thought
were UFOs maneuvering around the Manzano Nuclear Weapons  Storage
Facility  and the Coyote Canyon test area, located near  Kirtland
AFB, and he filmed them.

 Bennewitz reported all this to the Tucson-based Aerial Phenomena
Research  Organization (APRO), whose directors were  unimpressed,
judging  Bennewitz  to be deluded. But at  Kirtland,  Bennewitz's
claims,  or  at  least  some  of  them,  were  being  taken  more
seriously.  On  October 24, 1980, Bennewitz contacted  Air  Force
Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) agent Sgt. Richard  Doty
(whose  previous tour of duty had been at Ellsworth) after  being
referred  to him by Maj. Ernest Edwards, head of  base  security,
and  related  that  he had evidence  that  something  potentially
threatening  was going on in the Manzano Weapons Storage Area.  A
"Multipurpose  Internal OSI Form," signed by Maj. Thomas A.  Cseh
(Commander  of the Base Investigative Detachment), dated  October
28,  1980,  and  subsequently  released  under  the  Freedom   of
Information Act, states:

 "On  26 Oct 80, SA [Special Agent] Doty, with the assistance  of
JERRY MILLER, GS-15, Chief, Scientific Advisor for Air Force Test
and  Evaluation Center, KAFB , interviewed Dr. BENNEWITZ  at  his
home in the Four Hills section of Albuquerque, which is  adjacent
to  the  northern boundary of Manzano Base. (NOTE:  MILLER  is  a
former  Project Blue Book USAF Investigator who was  assigned  to
Wright-Patterson  AFB (W-PAFB), OH, with FTD [Foreign  Technology
Division].  Mr.  MILLER  is one of  the  most  knowledgeable  and
impartial investigators of Aerial Objects in the southwest.)  Dr.
BENNEWITZ  has been conducting independent research  into  Aerial
Phenomena  for  the last 15 months. Dr. BENNEWITZ  also  produced
several  electronic  recording  tapes,  allegedly  showing   high
periods of electrical magnetism being emitted from Manzano/Coyote
Canyon  area. Dr. BENNEWITZ also produced several photographs  of
flying  objects taken over the general Albuquerque area.  He  has
several  pieces of electronic surveillance equipment  pointed  at
Manzano  and  is attempting to record high  frequency  electrical
beam  pulses. Dr. BENNEWITZ claims these Aerial  Objects  produce
these  pulses.  . . . After analyzing the data collected  by  Dr.
BENNEWITZ, Mr MILLER related the evidence clearly shows that some
type of unidentified aerial objects were caught on film; however,
no conclusions could be made whether these objects pose a  threat
to  Manzano/Coyote Canyon areas. Mr MILLER felt the  electronical
[sic]  recording  tapes  were inconclusive and  could  have  been
gathered  from several conventional sources. No sightings,  other
than these, have been reported in the area."

 On November 10 Bennewitz was invited to the base to present  his
findings to a small group of officers and scientists. Exactly one
week later Doty informed Bennewitz that AFOSI had decided against
further  consideration of the matter. Subsequently Doty  reported
receiving a call from then-New Mexico Sen. Harrison Schmitt,  who
wanted  to know what AFOSI was planning to do  about  Bennewitz's
allegations.  When  informed that no investigation  was  planned,
Schmitt spoke with Brig. Gen. William Brooksher of base security.
The  following  July New Mexico's other senator,  Pete  Domenici,
looked into the matter, meeting briefly with Doty before  dashing
off to talk with Bennewitz personally. Domenici subsequently lost
interest and dropped the issue.

 Bennewitz  was also aware of supposed cattle  mutilations  being
reported  in  the western United States. At one point  he  met  a
young mother who told him that one evening in May 1980, after she
and  her  six-year-old son saw several UFOs in a  field  and  one
approached them, they suffered confusion and disorientation, then
a period of amnesia which lasted as long as four hours. Bennewitz
brought  the  two to University of Wyoming  psychologist  R.  Leo
Sprinkle, who hypnotized them and got a detailed abduction  story
from  the mother and a sketchy one from the little boy. Early  in
the  course  of the abduction they observed aliens  take  a  calf
aboard the UFO and mutilate it while it was still alive, removing
the   animal's  genitals.  At  one  point  during   the   alleged
experience,  the  mother said, they were taken via  UFO  into  an
underground  area  which  she believed was  in  New  Mexico.  She
briefly  escaped  her captors and fled into an area  where  there
were  tanks  of water. She looked into one of them and  saw  body
parts  such  as tongues, hearts and internal  organs,  apparently
from  cattle.  But  she also observed a human  arm  with  a  hand
attached.  There  was also the "top of a bald  head,"  apparently
from  one of the hairless aliens, but before she could  find  out
for  sure,  she was dragged away. The objects in  the  tank,  she
said, "horrified me and made me sick and frightened me to  death"
(Howe, 1989). Later she wondered about the other tanks and  about
their contents.

The William Moore/MJ-12 Maze: Late in the summer of 1979  William
L.  Moore  had left a teaching job in a small Minnesota  town  to
relocate  in Arizona, where he hoped to pursue a writing  career.
Moore was deeply involved in the investigation of an apparent UFO
crash  in New Mexico in July 1947, a case he and Charles  Berlitz
would  recount in their The Roswell Incident the following  year.
After  his move to the Southwest Moore became close to Coral  and
James  Lorenzen  of the Aerial  Phenomena  Research  Organization
(APRO) and in due course Moore was asked to join the APRO  board.
The  Lorenzens told him about Bennewitz's claims. Bennewitz,  Jim
Lorenzen thought, was "prone to make great leaps of logic on  the
basis of incomplete data" (Moore, 1989a).

 The Roswell Incident was published in the summer of 1980 and  in
September  a  debate on UFOs at the Smithsonian  Institution  was
scheduled  to take place. Moore set off from his Arizona home  to
Washington, D.C., to attend the debate and along the way promoted
his  new  book  on radio and television shows.  According  to  an
account he would give seven years later, an extraordinary  series
of events began while he was on this trip.

 He had done a radio show in Omaha and was in the station  lobby,
suitcase in hand, on his way to catch a plane which was to  leave
within the hour when a receptionist asked if he was Mr. Moore. He
had  a  phone  call. The caller was a man who  claimed  to  be  a
colonel at nearby Offutt AFB, He said, "We think you're the  only
one  we've heard who seems to know what he's talking  about."  He
asked  if  he and Moore could meet and discuss  matters  further.
Moore  said  that  since  he was leaving town  in  the  next  few
minutes,  that  would not be possible, though he wrote  down  the
man's phone number.

 Moore went on to Washington. On September 8, on his way back, he
did a radio show in Albuquerque. On the way out of the studio the
receptionist  told  him  he had a phone  call.  The  caller,  who
identified  himself  as an individual from nearby  Kirtland  AFB,
said,  "We think you're the only one we've heard about who  seems
to know what he's talking about." Moore said, "Where have I heard
that before?"

 Soon afterwards Moore and the individual he would call  "Falcon"
met  at a local restaurant. Falcon, later alleged (though  denied
by  Moore) to be U.S. Air Force Sgt. Richard Doty, said he  would
be  wearing a red tie. This first meeting would initiate a  long-
running  relationship  between  Moore (and,  beginning  in  1982,
partner Jaime Shandera) and 10 members of a shadowy group said to
be connected with military intelligence and to be opposed to  the
continuation  of  the UFO cover-up. The story that  emerged  from
this interaction goes like this:

 The  first  UFO crash, involving bodies of  small,  gray-skinned
humanoids,  occurred  near  Corona,  New  Mexico,  in  1947  (the
"Roswell  incident"). Two years later a humanoid was found  alive
and  it  was housed at Los Alamos until its death  in  the  early
1950s.  It  was called EBE,  after  "extraterrestrial  biological
entity," and it was the first of three the U.S. government  would
have  in its custody between then and now. An Air Force  captain,
now  a retired colonel, was EBE-1's constant companion. At  first
communication with it was almost impossible; then a speech device
which enabled the being to speak a sort of English was  implanted
in  its  throat. It turned out that EBE-1, the  equivalent  of  a
mechanic  on a spaceship, related what it knew of the nature  and
purpose of the visitation.

 In  response  to the Roswell incident, MJ-12-the MJ  stands  for
"Majestic"--as  set  up  by executive order  of  President  Harry
Truman  on September 24, 1947. MJ-12 operates as a  policy-making
body.  Project  Aquarius is an umbrella group in  which  all  the
various compartments dealing with ET-related issues perform their
various    functions.   Project   Sigma    conducts    electronic
communication  with  the extraterrestrials, part  of  an  ongoing
contact  project run through the National Security  Agency  since
1964,  following a landing at Holloman AFB in late April of  that
year.

 Nine extraterrestrial races are visiting the earth. One of these
races,   little  gray-skinned  people  from  the   third   planet
surrounding  Zeta Reticuli, have been here for 25,000  years  and
influenced  the direction of human evolution. They also  help  in
the shaping of our religious beliefs. Some important  individuals
within the cover-up want it to end and are preparing the American
people for the reality of the alien presence through the  vehicle
of popular entertainment, including the films Close Encounters of
the Third Kind, whose climax is a thinly-disguised version of the
Holloman landing, and ET.

 At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, there is a thick  book
called  "The  Bible," a compilation of all  the  various  project
reports.

 According  to his own account, which he would not  relate  until
1989,   Moore  cooperated  with  his   AFOSI   sources-including,
prominently,  Richard  Doty-and provided them  with  information.
They  informed  him  that  there  was  considerable  interest  in
Bennewitz.  Moore was made to understand that as his part of  the
bargain  he was to spy on Bennewitz and also on APRO as well  as,
in Moore's words, "to a lesser extent, several other individuals"
(Moore, 1989a). He learned that several government agencies  were
interested in Bennewitz's activities and they wanted to  inundate
him   with  false  information-disinformation,  in   intelligence
parlance-to  confuse  him.  Moore says he was not  one  of  those
providing  the disinformation, but he knew some of those  of  who
were, such as Doty.

 Bennewitz  on  his own had already begun to  devise  a  paranoid
interpretation of what he thought he was seeing and hearing,  and
the disinformation passed on to him built on that foundation. His
sources  told him that the U.S. government and malevolent  aliens
are in an uneasy alliance to control the planet, that the  aliens
are  killing  and mutilating not only cattle  but  human  beings,
whose organs they need to lengthen their lives, and that they are
even  eating  human  flesh. In underground  bases  at  government
installations in Nevada and New Mexico human and alien scientists
work  together on ghastly experiments, including the creation  of
soulless androids out of human and animal body parts. Aliens  are
abducting  as many as one American in 40 and  implanting  devices
which control human behavior. ClA brainwashing and other  control
techniques  are  doing  the same, turning life on  earth  into  a
nightmare  of  violence  and  irrationality.  It  was,  as  Moore
remarks,  "the  wildest  science fiction  scenario  anyone  could
possibly imagine."

 But Bennewitz believed it. He grew ever more obsessed and  tried
to  alert  prominent  persons to  the  imminent  threat,  showing
photographs  which  he held showed human-alien  activity  in  the
Kirtland area but which dispassionate observers thought  depicted
natural  rock formations and other mundane phenomena.  Eventually
Bennewitz  was  hospitalized,  but on  his  release  resumed  his
activities,  which  continue  to  this  day.  Soon  the  ghoulish
scenario  would spread into the larger UFO community  and  beyond
and  command  a small but committed band of believers.  But  that
would  not  happen  until  the late 1980s and  it  would  not  be
Bennewitz who would be responsible for it.

 In 1981 the Lorenzens received an anonymous letter from  someone
identifying  himself  as a "USAF Airman assigned  to  the  1550th
Aircrew Training and Testing Wing at Kirtland AFB." The  "airman"
said,  "On July 16, 1980, at between 10:30-10:45 A.M.,  Craig  R.
Weitzel.  ..  a  Civil Air Patrol Cadet from  Dobbins  AFB,  Ga.,
visiting  Kirtland AFB, NM, observed a dull metallic colored  UFO
flying  from  South to North near Pecos New Mexico. Pecos  has  a
secret training site for the 1550th Aircrew Training and  Testing
Wing,  Kirtland AFB, NM. WEITZEL was with ten other  individuals,
including  USAF  active  duty  airmen,  and  all  witnessed   the
sighting. WEITZEL took some pictures of the object. WEITZEL  went
closer  to  the  UFO  and observed the UFO  land  in  a  clearing
approximately 250 yds, NNW of the training area. WEITZEL observed
an  individual  dressed in a metallic suit depart the  craft  and
walk  a few feet away. The individual was outside the  craft  for
just  a few minutes. When the individual returned the craft  took
off  towards  the NW." The letter writer said he  had  been  with
Weitzel when the UFO flew overhead, but he had not been with  him
to observe the landing.

 The  letter went on to say that late on the evening of the  next
day  a tall, dark-featured, black-suited man  wearing  sunglasses
called  on Weitzel at Kirtland. The stranger claimed to  be  "Mr.
Huck" from Sandia Laboratories, a classified Department of Energy
contractor  on  the  base.  Mr. Huck told  Weitzel  he  had  seen
something  he  should not have seen, a secret aircraft  from  Los
Alamos,  and he demanded all of the photographs. Weitzel  replied
that  he  hadn't taken any, that the photographer was  an  airman
whose name he did not know. "The individual warned Weitzel not to
mention  the  sighting to anyone or Weitzel would be  in  serious
trouble,"  the  writer  went  on.  "After  the  individual   left
Weitzel[']s room, Weitzel wondered how the individual knew of the
sighting  because Weitzel didn't report the sighting  to  anyone.
Weitzel became scared after thinking of the threat the individual
made.  Weitzel  call [sic] the Kirtland AFB Security  Police  and
reported the incident to them. They referred the incident to  the
Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (AFOSI),   which
investigates  these matters according to the security  police.  A
Mr. Dody [sic], a special agent with OSI, spoke with Weitzel  and
took  a report. Mr. Dody [sic] also obtained all the  photographs
of  the  UFO.  Dody [sic] told Weitzel he  would  look  into  the
matter. That was the last anyone heard of the incident."

 But that was not all the correspondent had to say. He added,  "I
have  every  reason  to beleive [sic] the  USAF  is  covering  up
something.  I spent a lot of time looking into this matter and  I
know  there  is more to it than the USAF will say. I  have  heard
rumors,  but serious rumors here at Kirtland that the USAF has  a
crashed UFO stored in the Manzano Storage area, which is  located
in a remote area of Kirtland AFB. This area is heavily guarded by
USAF  Security. I have spoke [sic] with two employees  of  Sandia
Laboratories,  who also store classified objects in Manzano,  and
they  told me that Sandia has examined several UFO's  during  the
last 20 years. One that crashed near Roswell NM in the late  50's
was  examined  by Sandia scientists. That craft  is  still  being
store [sic] in Manzano.

 "I have reason to beleive [sic] OSI is conducting a very  secret
investigation into UFO sightings. OSI took over when Project Blue
Book  was  closed.  I was told this by my  commander,  COL  Bruce
Purvine.  COL Purvine also told me that the investigation was  so
secret that most employees of OSI doesn't [sic] even know it. But
COL  Purvine told me that Kirtland AFB, AFOSI District 17  has  a
special secret detachment that investigates sightings around this
area.  They have also investigated the cattle mutilations in  New
Mexico."

 In  1985 investigator Benton Jamison located Craig Weitzel,  who
confirmed  that he had indeed seen a UFO in 1980 and reported  it
to  Sgt.  Doty. But his sighting, while interesting,  was  rather
less dramatic than the CE3 reported in the letter; Weitzel saw  a
silver-colored object some 10,000 to 15,000 feet overhead.  After
maneuvering  for a few minutes, he told Jamison, it  "accelerated
like you never saw anything accelerate before" (Hastings,  1985).
He also said he knew nothing of a meeting with anyone  identified
as "Mr. Huck."

 In  December  1982,  in response to  a  Freedom  of  Information
request  from  Barry Greenwood of Citizens  Against  UFO  Secrecy
(CAUS),  Air  Force Office of Special Investigations  released  a
two  page  OSI Complaint Form stamped "For  Official  Use  Only."
Dated September 8, 1980, it was titled "Kirtland AFB, NM, 8 Aug-3
Sept  80,  Alleged  Sightings of Unidentified  Aerial  Lights  in
Restricted Test Range." The document described several  sightings
of UFOs in the Manzano Weapons Storage Area, at the Coyote Canyon
section  of the Department of Defense Restricted Test Range.  One
of the reports cited was a New Mexico State Patrolman's August 10
observation  of a UFO landing. (A later check with  state  police
sources  by Larry Fawcett, a Connecticut police officer  and  UFO
investigator,  uncovered no record of such a report. The  sources
asserted  that  the absence of a report could only mean  that  no
such  incident  had ever happened.) This intriguing  document  is
signed by then OSI Special Agent Richard C. Doty.

 In  1987, after comparing three documents (the anonymous  letter
to  APRO,  the  September 8, 1980, AFOSI Complaint  Form,  and  a
purported  AFOSI  document dated August 14,  1980,  and  claiming
"frequency  jamming"  by UFOs in the Kirtland  area),  researcher
Brad  Sparks concluded that Doty had written all three.  In  1989
Moore  confirmed  that  Doty  had written  the  letter  to  APRO.
"Essentially it was 'bait,'" he says. "AFOSI knew that  Bennewitz
had close ties with APRO at the time, and they were interested in
recruiting  someone  within . . . APRO . . . who would  be  in  a
position   to  provide  them  with  feedback   on   Bennewitz'[s]
activities and communications. Since I was the APRO Board  member
in  charge of Special Investigations in 1980, the Weitzel  letter
was passed to me for action shortly after it had been  received."
According to Bruce Maccabee, Doty admitted privately that he  had
written the Ellsworth AFB document, basing it on a real  incident
which  he wanted to bring to public attention. Doty has  made  no
public comment on any of these allegations. Moore says Doty  "was
almost  certainly a part of [the Ellsworth report], but not in  a
capacity  where he would have been responsible for  creating  the
documents involved" (Moore, 1989a).

 Doty was also the source of an alleged AFOSI communication dated
November 17, 1980, and destined to become known as the  "Aquarius
document." Allegedly sent from AFOSI headquarters at Bolling  AFB
in Washington, D.C., to the AFOSI District 17 office at Kirtland,
it  mentions,  in brief and cryptic form, analyses  of  negatives
from a UFO film apparently taken the previous month. The  version
that   circulated  through  the  UFO  community  states  in   its
penultimate  paragraph:  "USAF NO LONGER PUBLICLY ACTIVE  IN  UFO
RESEARCH,  HOWEVER USAF STILL HAS INTEREST IN ALL  UFO  SIGHTINGS
OVER  USAF  INSTALLATION/TEST RANGES.  SEVERAL  OTHER  GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES,  LED  BY NASA, ACTIVELY INVESTIGATES  [sic]  LEGITIMATE
SIGHTINGS  THROUGH  COVERT  COVER....  ONE  SUCH  COVER  IS   UFO
REPORTING  CENTER,  US COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,  ROCKVILLE,  MD
20852, NASA FILTERS RESULTS OF SIGHTINGS TO APPROPRIATE  MILITARY
DEPARTMENTS  WITH  INTEREST  IN  THAT  PARTICULAR  SIGHTING.  THE
OFFICIAL US GOVERNMENT POLICY AND RESULTS OF PROJECT AQUARIUS  IS
[sic]  STILL  CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET WITH  NO  DISEMINATION  [sic]
OUTSIDE OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANNELS AND WITH RESTRICTED ACCESS
TO 'MJ TWELVE'."

 This  is the first mention of "MJ-12" in an  allegedly  official
government document. Moore describes it as an "example of some of
the  disinformation  produced in connection  with  the  Bennewitz
case.  The document is a retyped version of a real AFOSI  message
with  a  few  spurious additions."  Among  the  most  significant
additions,  by Moore's account, are the bogus references  to  the
U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and to NASA, which he says was NSA
(National Security Agency) in the original.

 According  to  Moore,  Doty  got the  document  "right  off  the
teletype"   (Moore,   1990)  and  showed  it  to   Moore   almost
immediately. Later Doty came by with what purported to be a  copy
of  it,  but  Moore noticed that it was  not  exactly  the  same;
material had been added to it. Doty said he wanted Moore to  give
the  doctored copy to Bennewitz. Reluctant to involve himself  in
the  passing  of  this dubious document, Moore sat on  it  for  a
while,  then finally worried that the sources he was  developing,
the ones who were telling him about the U.S. government's alleged
interactions with EBEs, would dry up if he did not cooperate.  So
eventually he gave the document to Bennewitz but urged him not to
publicize it. Bennewitz agreed and kept his promise.

 As of September 1982 Moore knew of three copies of the document:
the  one Bennewitz had, one Moore had in safekeeping, and one  he
had  in  his briefcase during a trip he made that month  to  meet
someone in San Francisco. He met the man in the morning and  that
afternoon  someone  broke into his car and stole  his  briefcase.
Four  months later a copy of the document showed up in the  hands
of  a New York lawyer interested in UFOs, and soon  the  document
was  circulating widely. Moore himself had little to say  on  the
subject  until he delivered a controversial and explosive  speech
to the annual conference of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) in Las
Vegas in 1989.

 In  late  1982,  "during," he says, "one of  the  many  friendly
conversations  I had with Richard Doty," Moore mentioned that  he
was looking into the old (and seemingly discredited) story that a
UFO had crashed in Aztec, New Mexico, in 1948. This tale was  the
subject  of Frank Scully's 1950 book Behind the  Flying  Saucers.
(Moore's long account of his investigation into the affair, which
he found to be an elaborate hoax, would appear in the 1985  MUFON
symposium  proceedings.) Doty said he had never heard  the  story
and asked for details, taking notes as Moore spoke.

 On January 10 and 11, 1983, attorney Peter Gersten, director  of
CAUS,  met with Doty in New Mexico. There were two meetings,  the
first of them also attended by Moore and San Francisco television
producer Ron Lakis, the second by Gersten alone. During the first
meeting  Doty  was guarded in his remarks. But at the  second  he
spoke openly about what ostensibly were extraordinary secrets. He
said  the Ellsworth case was the subject of an  investigation  by
AFOSI  and the FBI; nuclear weapons were involved.  The  National
Enquirer investigation, which had concluded the story was  bogus,
was  "amateurish." At least two civilians, a farmer and a  deputy
sheriff,  had  been involved, but were warned not  to  talk.  The
government  knows why UFOs appear in certain places,  Doty  said,
but  he  would not elaborate. He added, however, that  "beyond  a
shadow of a doubt they're extraterrestrial" (Greenwood, 1988) and
from 50 light years from the earth. He knew of at least three UFO
crashes, the Roswell incident and two others, one from the 1950s,
the   other  from  the  196Os.  Bodies  had  been  recovered.   A
spectacular incident, much like the one depicted in the ending of
the  film Close Encounters of the Third Kind, took place in  1966
The  NSA was involved in communications  with  extraterrestrials;
the   effort   is  called  Project  Aquarius.  Inside   the   UFO
organizations  government  moles are collecting  information  and
spreading  disinformation. Doty discussed the  Aquarius  document
and said the really important documents are impossible to get out
of  the appropriate files. Some are protected in such a way  that
they  will  disintegrate within five seconds'  exposure  to  air.
These  documents tell of agreements between the  U.S.  government
and extraterrestrials under which the latter are free to  conduct
animal  mutilations  (especially  of cattle) and  to  land  at  a
certain  base,  in exchange for information  about  advanced  UFO
technology. Doty also claimed that via popular entertainment  the
American  people  are  being prepared to accept  the  reality  of
visitation by benevolent beings from other worlds.

 At one point in the conversation Doty asked Gersten, "How do you
know  that I'm not here to either give you misinformation  or  to
give  you information which is part of the  programming,  knowing
you are going to go out and spread it around?" (Howe, 1989).

 In  the  1970s, as director of special projects for  the  Denver
CBS-TV   affiliate,   Linda   Moulton  Howe   had   produced   12
documentaries,   most   of   them   dealing   with    scientific,
environmental  and health issues. But the one that attracted  the
most  attention was Strange Harvest, which dealt with  the  then-
widespread  reports that cattle in Western and Midwestern  states
were  being  killed and mutilated by persons or  forces  unknown.
Most  veterinary  pathologists  said the animals  were  dying  of
unknown  causes.  Farmers,  ranchers  and  some   law-enforcement
officers thought the deaths were mysterious. Some even speculated
that   extraterrestrials  were  responsible.   This   possibility
intrigued Howe, who had a lifelong interest in UFOs, and  Strange
Harvest argues for a UFO mutilation link.

 In the fall of 1982, as Howe was working on a documentary on  an
unrelated matter, she got a call from Home Box Office (HBO).  The
caller  said  the  HBO people had  been  impressed  with  Strange
Harvest  and wanted to know if Howe would do a film on  UFOs.  In
March 1983 she went to New York to sign a contract with HBO for a
show to be titled UFOs-The ET Factor.

 The  evening  before her meeting with the HBO people,  Howe  had
dinner  with Gersten and science writer Patrick  Huyghe.  Gersten
told  Howe  that  he had met with Sgt. Doty, an  AFOSI  agent  at
Kirtland AFB, and perhaps Doty would be willing to talk on camera
or  in  some  other  helpful  capacity  about  the  incident   at
Ellsworth. Gersten would call him and ask if he would be  willing
to meet with Howe.

 Subsequently   arrangements  were  made  for  Howe  to  fly   to
Albuquerque  on April 9. Doty would meet her at the airport.  But
when she arrived that morning, no one was waiting. She called his
home.  A  small boy answered and said his father was  not  there.
Howe  then phoned Jerry Miller, Chief of Reality Weapons  Testing
at Kirtland and a former Blue Book investigator. (He is mentioned
in  the  October  28,  1980,  "Multipurpose  Internal  OSI  Form"
reporting on Doty and Miller's meeting with Bennewitz.) She  knew
Miller  from  an  earlier telephone conversation,  when  she  had
called  to ask him about Bennewitz's claims, in which she  had  a
considerable  interest.  Miller  asked  for  a  copy  of  Strange
Harvest.  Later he had given Howe his home phone number and  said
to  contact him if she ever found herself in Albuquerque. So  she
called and asked if he would pick her up at the airport.

 Miller  drove  Howe to his house. On the way Howe  asked  him  a
number  of  questions but got little in the way of  answers.  One
question  he  did  not  answer was whether  he  is  the  "Miller"
mentioned  in  the Aquarius document. When they got  to  Miller's
residence, Miller called Doty at his home, and Doty arrived a few
minutes  later, responding aggressively to Howe's question  about
where  he  had been. He claimed to have been at the  airport  all
along;  where had she been? "Perhaps," Howe would write, "he  had
decided he didn't want to go through with the meeting, and it was
acceptable in his world to leave me stranded at the airport-until
Jerry Miller called his house" (Howe, 1989).

 On  the way to Kirtland, Howe asked Doty, whose manner  remained
both defiant and nervous, if he knew anything about the  Holloman
landing. Doty said it happened but that Robert Emenegger had  the
date wrong; it was not May 1971 but April 25, 1964-12 Hours after
a much-publicized CE3 reported by Socorro, New Mexico,  policeman
Lonnie  Zamora. (Zamora said he had seen an egg-shaped object  on
the ground. Standing near it were two child-sized beings in white
suits.)  Military  and scientific personnel at the  base  knew  a
landing  was coming, but "someone blew the time and  coordinates"
and  an "advance military scout ship" had come down at the  wrong
time  and  place,  to  be observed by  Zamora.  When  three  UFOs
appeared  at Holloman at six o'clock the following  morning,  one
landed  while the other two hovered overhead. During the  meeting
between  the  UFO beings and a government  party,  the  preserved
bodies of dead aliens had been given to the aliens , who in  turn
had  returned  something  unspecified.  Five  ground  and  aerial
cameras recorded this event.

 At  the  Kirtland  gate  Doty waved to the  guard  and  was  let
through. They went to a small white and gray building. Doty  took
her  to  what he described as "my - boss'  office."  Doty  seemed
unwilling  to discuss the Ellsworth case, the  ostensible  reason
for the interview, but had much to say about other matters. First
he asked Howe to move from the chair on which she was sitting  to
another in the middle of the room. Howe surmised that this was to
facilitate the surreptitious recording of their conversation, but
Doty said only, "Eyes can see through windows."

 "My  superiors  have  asked me to show you this,"  he  said.  He
produced a brown envelope he had taken from a drawer in the  desk
at  which  he was sitting and withdrew several  sheets  of  white
paper.  As he handed them to Howe, he warned her that they  could
not be copied; all she could do was read them in his presence and
ask questions.

 The document gave no indication anywhere as to which government,
military  or scientific agency (if any) had prepared the  report,
titled A Briefing Paper for the President of the United States on
the  Subject of Unidentified Flying Vehicles. The title  did  not
specify which President it had in mind, nor did the document list
a date (so far as Howe recalls today) which would have linked  it
to a particular administration.


  The first paragraph, written--as was everything that followed--
in  what Howe characterizes as "dry bureaucratese," listed  dates
and  locations  of  crashes  and retrievals  of  UFOs  and  their
occupants. The latter were invariably described as 3 1/2 to  four
feet tall, gray-skinned and hairless, with oversized heads, large
eyes  and  no noses. It was now known, the document stated  on  a
subsequent  page, that these beings, from a nearby solar  system,
have  been  here  for many thousands of  years.  Through  genetic
manipulation they influenced the course of human evolution and in
a  sense  created us. They had also helped  shape  our  religious
beliefs.

 The  July  1947 Roswell crash was mentioned;  so,  however,  was
another  one at Roswell in 1949. Investigators at the site  found
five  bodies and one living alien, who was taken to a safe  house
at  the Los Alamos National Laboratory north of Albuquerque.  The
aliens,    small   gray-skinned   humanoids,   were   known    as
"extraterrestrial  biological  entities" and the living  one  was
called "EBE" (ee-buh). EBE was befriended (if that was the  word)
by an Air Force officer, but the being died of unknown causes  on
June 18, 1952. (EBE's friend, by 1964 a colonel, was among  those
who  were  there  to greet the aliens who  landed  at  Holloman.)
Subsequently,  it would be referred to as EBE-1, since  in  later
years  another  such being, EBE-2, would take up residence  in  a
safe house. After that, a third, EBE-3, appeared on the scene and
was now living in secret at an American base.

 The  briefing  paper said other crashes had  occurred  one  near
Kingman, Arizona, another just south of Texas in northern Mexico.
It  also mentioned the Aztec crash- The wreckage and  bodies  had
been  removed  to such facilities as Los  Alamos  laboratory  and
Wright-Patterson  AFB.  A number of  highly  classified  projects
dealt with these materials. They included Snowbird (research  and
development  from the study of an intact spacecraft left  by  the
aliens  as  a gift) and Aquarius (the  umbrella  operation  under
which the research and contact efforts were coordinated). Project
Sigma was the ongoing electronic communications effort. There was
also   a   defunct  project  Garnet,  intended   to   investigate
extraterrestrial  influence on human evolution. According to  the
document, extraterrestrials have appeared at various intervals in
human history-25,000, 15,000, 5000 and 2500 years ago as well  as
now--to manipulate human and other DNA.

 One   paragraph   stated  briefly,  "Two  thousand   years   ago
extraterrestrials  created a being" who was placed here to  teach
peace  and love. Elsewhere a passing mention was made of  another
group of EBEs, called the "Talls."

 The paper said Project Blue Book had existed solely to take heat
off  the  Air  Force and to draw attention  away  from  the  real
projects.  Doty mentioned an "MJ-12," explaining that "MJ"  stood
for  "Majority."  It was a policy-making  body  whose  membership
consisted of 12 very high-ranking government scientists, military
officers and intelligence officials. These were the men who  made
the decisions governing the cover-up and the contacts.

 Doty  said  Howe  would be given thousands of feet  of  film  of
crashed  discs,  bodies,  EBE-1  and  the  Holloman  landing  and
meeting.  She could use this material in her documentary to  tell
the  story of how U.S. officials learned that the earth is  being
visited and what they have done about it. "We want you to do  the
film," Howe quotes him as saying.

 When Howe asked why she, not the New York Times, the  Washington
Post  or  60  Minutes,  was  getting  this,  the  story  of   the
millennium, Doty replied bluntly that an individual media  person
is  easier to manipulate and discredit than a major  organization
with  expensive attorneys. He said that another plan  to  release
the  information, through Emenegger and Sandler, had been  halted
because political conditions were not right.

 Over  the  next weeks Howe had a number of  phone  conversations
with Doty, mostly about technical problems related to  converting
old film to videotape. She spoke on several occasions with  three
other men but did not meet them personally.

 Doty  suggested that eventually she might be allowed to film  an
interview with EBE-3. But the current film project was to have  a
historical  emphasis; it would deal with events between 1949  and
1964. If at some point she did meet EBE-3, however, there was  no
way she could prepare herself for the "shock and fear" of meeting
an alien being.

 Howe,  of course, had informed her HBO contacts, Jean  Abounader
and   her  superior  Bridgett  Potter,  of  these   extraordinary
developments. Howe urged them to prepare themselves, legally  and
otherwise,  for  the repercussions that would surely  follow  the
release  of the film. The HBO people told her she would have  to
secure  a  letter  of  intent from the  U.S.  government  with  a
legally-binding commitment to release the promised film  footage.
When  Howe called Doty about it, he said, "I'll work on  it."  He
said he would mail the letter directly to HBO.

 Then  HBO  told her it would not authorize funds  for  the  film
production until all the evidence was in hand and, as Potter  put
it,  Howe had the "President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary  of
State and Joint Chiefs of Staff to back it up" (Howe, 1989).  But
proceed  anyway, Howe was told. Now she was furious at  both  HBO
and Doty.

 When  she called him at the base, he remarked that he  had  good
news  and  bad news. She and a small crew would soon be  able  to
interview  the  retired colonel (then a captain)  who  had  spent
three  years with EBE-1. The bad news was that it would be  three
months  before  the thousands of feet of film of  EBE-1  and  the
Holloman  landing/contact would be available.  Meanwhile,  before
she  could  screen  the footage, Howe would have  to  sign  three
security  oaths  and undergo a background check. She  would  also
have  to supply photographs of all the technical  assistants  who
would accompany her to the interview.

 The  interview was repeatedly set up and canceled. Then in  June
Doty called to say he was officially out of the project. This was
a blow because Doty was the only one she could call. She did  not
know  how to get in touch with the others and always had to  wait
for them to contact her.

 By  October  the  contacts had decreased.  The  same  month  her
contract  with  HBO  expired. All she had was  the  name  of  the
Washington  contact.  In March 1984 this  individual  called  her
office  three  times, although she was out of town working  on  a
non-UFO story at the time. "Upon returning home," she writes,  "I
learned  the  man  was contacting me to explain  there  would  be
further  delays  in  the film project  after  the  November  1984
election" (Howe, 1989).

 For  Howe  that was the end of the matter, except  for  a  brief
sequel.  On March 5, 1988, Doty wrote ufologist Larry W.  Bryant,
who  had unsuccessfully sought access to Doty's military  records
through  the Freedom of Information Act, and denied that  he  had
ever  discussed  government UFO secrets or  promised  footage  of
crashed  discs, bodies and live EBEs. Howe responded by making  a
sworn  statement  about the meeting an producing  copies  of  her
correspondence from the period with both Doty and HBO.


 In 1989 Moore said that "in early 1983 I became aware that  Rick
[Doty] was involved with a team of several others, including  one
fellow  from  Denver  that I knew of and at  least  one  who  was
working  out  of  Washington,  D.C.,  in  playing  an   elaborate
disinformation scheme against a prominent UfO researcher who,  at
the  time,  had close connections with a  major  television  film
company interested in doing a UFO documentary." He was  referring
to  Howe, of course. The episode was a counterintelligence  sting
operation,  part  of  the "wall of  disinformation"  intended  to
"confuse"  the Bennewitz issue and to "call his credibility  into
question."  Because  of  Howe's  interest  in  Bennewitz's  work,
according  to  Moore, "certain elements within  the  intelligence
community were concerned that the story of his having intercepted
low  frequency electromagnetic emissions from the  Coyote  Canyon
area  of  the Kirtland/Sandia complex would end up as part  of  a
feature film. Since this in turn might influence others (possibly
even  the Russians) to attempt similar experiments, someone in  a
control  position apparently felt it had to be stopped before  it
got out of hand." In his observation, Moore said, "the government
seemed hell bent on severing the ties that existed between [Howe]
and [HBO]" (Moore, 1989b).

 Doty's assertion that Howe had misrepresented their meeting  was
not  to  be taken seriously, according to Moore, since  Doty  was
bound by a security oath and could not discuss the matter  freely
Moore  said that the Aztec crash, known beyond  reasonable  doubt
never  to  have  occurred, was something Doty had  added  to  the
document after learning from Moore of his recent investigation of
the hoax.

 In December 1984, in the midst of continuing contact with  their
own  sources  (Doty  and a number of others) who  claimed  to  be
leaking  the  secret  of the cover-up,  Moore's  associate  Jaime
Shandera  received a roll of 35mm film containing, it turned  out
what  purported to be a briefing paper dated November  18,  1952,
and  intended  for  president-elect  Eisenhower.  The   purported
author, Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, reported that an "Operation
Majestic-12,"  consisting  of a dozen  top  scientists,  military
officers  and  intelligence  specialists,  had  been  set  up  by
presidential  order on September 24, 1947, to study  the  Roswell
remains  and  the four humanoid bodies that  had  been  recovered
nearby. The document report that the team directed by MJ12 member
and  physiologist  Detlev Bronk "has suggested the  term  'Extra-
terrestrial  Biological Entities', or 'EBEs', be adopted  as  the
standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as
a more definitive designation can be agreed upon." Brief  mention
is also made of a December 6, 1950, crash along the  Texas-Mexico
border.   Nothing  is  said,  however,  about  live   aliens   or
communications with them.

 In  July  1985  Moore and Shandera, acting on  tips  from  their
sources,  traveled  to  Washington and spent  a  few  days  going
through  recently  declassified documents in  Record  Group  341,
including  Top  Secret  Air Force intelligence  files  from  USAF
Headquarters. In the 126th box whose contents they examined, they
found  a  brief  memo dated July 14, 1954,  from  Robert  Cutler,
Special  Assistant to the President, to Gen. Nathan  Twining.  It
says  "The  president  has decided that  the  MJ-12/SSP  [Special
Studies  Project] briefing should take place during  the  already
scheduled White House meeting of July 16 rather than following it
as  previously  intended.  More  precise  arrangements  will   be
explained to you upon your arrival. Your concurrence in the above
change of arrangements is assumed" (Friedman, 1987).

 The   Cutler/Twining  memo,  as  it  would  be  called  in   the
controversies  that  erupted  after  Moore  released  the   MJ-12
document to the world in the spring of 1987, is the only official
document-not  to  be  confused with such  disputed  ones  as  the
November  17, 1980, Aquarius document-to mention MJ-12.  (Several
critics   of  the  MJ-12  affair  have  questioned   the   memo's
authenticity  as well, but so far without  unambiguous  success.)
The  memo does not, of course, say what the MJ12 Special  Studies
Project was.

MJ-12  Goes  Public: Just prior to Moore's release of  the  MJ-12
briefing  paper,  another copy was leaked  to  British  ufologist
Timothy Good, who took his copy to the press. The first newspaper
article  on it appeared in the London Observer of May  31,  1987,
and  soon  it was the subject of pieces in the  New  York  Times,
Washington  Post and ABC-TV's Nightline. It was  also  denounced,
not  altogether persuasively, both by professional debunkers  and
by  many  ufologists. The dispute would rage  without  resolution
well  into 1989, when critics discovered that President  Truman's
signature on the September 24, 1947, executive order (appended to
the  briefing  paper)  was  exactly  like  his  signature  on  an
undisputed, UFO-unrelated October 1, 1947, letter to his  science
adviser  (and  supposed  MJ-12  member)  Vannevar  Bush.  To  all
appearances  a  forger had appended a real signature  to  a  fake
letter.   The   MJ-12  document  began  to  look   like   another
disinformation scheme.

 Although acutely aware of the mass of disinformation circulating
throughout  the UFO community, Moore remained convinced  that  at
least some of the information his own sources were giving him was
authentic. In 1988 he provided two of his sources, "Falcon" (Sgt.
Doty according to some) and "Condor" (later claimed to be  former
U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Collins), to a television  production
company.  (Moore  and  Shandera had given them  avian  names  and
called the sources collectively "the birds.") UFO Cover-up . .  .
Live, a two-hour program, aired in October 1988, with Falcon  and
Condor,  their faces shaded, their voices altered,  relating  the
same  tales with which they had regaled Moore and  Shandera.  The
show,  almost universally judged a laughable  embarrassment,  was
most  remembered for the informants' statements that  the  aliens
favored  ancient Tibetan music and strawberry ice cream.  Critics
found the latter allegation especially hilarious.


Lear's  Conspiracy Theory: Events on the UFO scene were taking  a
yet  more bizarre turn that same year as even wilder tales  began
to circulate. The first to tell them was John Lear, a pilot  with
a background in the CIA and the estranged son of aviation  legend
William  P. Lear. Lear had surfaced two or three  years  earlier,
but  aside  from  his  famous  father  there  seemed  little   to
distinguish  him  from  any of hundreds of other  UFO  buffs  who
subscribe  to  the  field's  publications  and  show  up  at  its
conferences.  But then he started claiming that  unnamed  sources
had  told  him of extraordinary events which made those  told  by
Doty   and  the  birds  sound  like  bland  and   inconsequential
anecdotes.

 According  to Lear, not just a few but dozens of flying  saucers
had  crashed over the years. In 1962 the U.S. government  started
Project  Redlight to find a way to fly the recovered craft,  some
relatively  intact. A similar project exists even now and is  run
out  of  supersecret  military  installation;  one  is  Area   51
(specifically  at a facility called S4) at the Nevada  Test  Site
and  the  other is set up near Dulce, New  Mexico.  These  areas,
unfortunately,  may  no  longer  be  under  the  control  of  the
government  or  even  of the human race. In  the  late  1960s  an
official agency so secret that not even the President may know of
it  had  made  an  agreement with the  aliens.  In  exchange  for
extraterrestrial  technology the secret government  would  permit
(or  at least not interfere with) a limited number of  abductions
of  human beings; the aliens, however, were to provide a list  of
those they planned to kidnap.

 All  went  relatively  well for a few years. Then  in  1973  the
government  discovered that thousands of persons who were not  on
the alien's list were being abducted. The resulting tensions  led
to  an  altercation  in 1978 or 1979. The aliens  held  and  then
killed  44  top  scientists as well as a number  of  Delta  force
troops  who had tried to free them. Ever since, frantic  efforts,
of  which the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars")  is  the
most  visible manifestation, have been made to develop a  defense
against the extraterrestrials, who are busy putting implants into
abductees  (as  many  as one in 10 Americans)  to  control  their
behavior.  At some time in the near future these people  will  be
used  for some unknown, apparently sinister, alien purpose.  Even
worse  than  all this, though, is the aliens' interest  in  Human
flesh. Sex and other organs are taken from both human beings  and
cattle  and  used  to create androids in giant  vats  located  in
underground   laboratories   at   Area   51   and   Dulce.    The
extraterrestrials,  from  an  ancient race near the  end  of  its
evolution,  also use materials from human body parts as a  method
of biological rejuvenation. ("In order to sustain themselves," he
said, "they use an enzyme or hormonal secretion obtained from the
tissue that they extract from humans and animals. The  secretions
are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide and applied on the skin  by
spreading  or dipping parts of their bodies in the solution.  The
body  absorbs the solution, then excretes the waste back  through
the skin" [Berk and Renzi, 1988].)

 One  of Lear's major sources was Bennewitz, who had first  heard
these scary stories from AFOSI personnel at Kirtland in the early
1980s. By this time Bennewitz had become something of a guru to a
small  group  of  UFO enthusiasts, Linda  Howe  among  them,  who
believed  extraterrestrials  were mutilating cattle  and  had  no
trouble  believing they might do the same thing to  people.  Also
Lear,  whose political views are far to the right of center,  was
linking  his  UFO  beliefs  with  conspiracy  theories  about   a
malevolent secret American government which was attempting to use
the  aliens  for its own purposes, including enslavement  of  the
world's  people  through drug addiction. A considerable  body  of
rightwing conspiracy literature, some with barely-concealed anti-
Semitic  overtones, was making similar charges. Lear himself  was
not anti-Semitic, but he did share conspiracy beliefs with  those
who were.

 Another  of  his claimed sources was an unnamed  physicist  who,
Lear  claimed, had actually worked at S4. To the many  ufologists
who  rejected Lear's stories as paranoid, lunatic  or  fabricated
(though  not by the patently-sincere Lear), there was  widespread
skepticism  about this physicist's existence. It turned out  that
he did indeed exist. His name is Robert Lazar, who, according  to
a  story  broken  by reporter George Knapp  on  KLAS-TV,  the  ABC
affiliate  in Las Vegas, on November 11 and 13, 1989,  claims  to
have worked on alien technology projects at Area 51. Lazar, whose
story  is  being investigated by both ufologists  and  mainstream
journalists,  has  not endorsed Lear's claims  about  human-alien
treaties,  man-eating  ETs or any of the rest and  has  distanced
himself from Lear and his associates. His claims, while fantastic
by most standards, are modest next to Lears.

Cooper's Conspiracy Theory: Soon Lear was joined by someone  with
an  even  bigger  supply of fabulous yarns:  one  Milton  William
Cooper. Cooper surfaced on December 18, 1988, when his account of
the  fantastic  secrets he learned while a  Naval  petty  officer
appeared  on a computer network subscribed to by  ufologists  and
others interested in anomalous phenomena. Cooper said that  while
working  as  a quartermaster with an intelligence team  for  Adm.


Bernard  Clarey, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Meet,  in  the
early  1970s he saw two documents, Project Grudge Special  Report
13 and a Majority briefing. (In conventional UFO history,  Grudge
was  the  second public Air Force UFO  project,  superseding  the
original Sign, in early 1949 and lasting until late 1951, when it
was  renamed  Blue Book. Whereas Sign investigators at  one  time
concluded UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin--a conclusion  the
Air  force  leadership found unacceptable--Grudge,  as  its  name
suggests coincidentally or otherwise, was known for its hostility
to the idea of UFOs and for its eagerness to assign  conventional
explanations,  warranted  or otherwise, to the  sighting  reports
that came its way.) Cooper's account of what was in these reports
is  much  like  the by-now familiar  story  of  crashes,  bodies,
contacts and projects, with some elaborations. Moreover, he  said
the  aliens  were called "ALFs" (which as any  television  viewer
knows,  stands for Alien Life forms) and the "M" in MJ-12 is  for
Majority not Majestic. Later he would say he had seen photographs
of aliens, including a type he called the "big-nosed  grays"-like
those  that  supposedly landed at Holloman in 1964 or  1971.  The
U.S.  government  was in contact with them  and  alien-technology
projects were going on at Area 51.

 If  this sounded like a rehash of Moore and Lear, that was  only
because  Cooper  had yet to pull out all the stops.  On  May  23,
1989,  Cooper  produced  a 25-page  document  titled  The  Secret
Government:  The  Origin,  Identity  And  Purpose  of  MJ-12.  He
presented  it  as a lecture in Las Vegas a few  weeks  later.  In
Cooper's version of the evolving legend, the "secret government,"
an  unscrupulous  group  of covert  CIA  and  other  intelligence
operatives who keep many of their activities sealed from even the
President's  knowledge, runs the country. One of its  first  acts
was  to murder one-time Secretary of Defense (and  alleged  early
MJ-12  member)  James Forrestal the death was made to  look  like
suicide-because  he  threatened  to  expose  the  UFO   cover-up.
Nonetheless,  President  Truman, fearing an invasion  from  outer
space, kept other nations, including the Soviet Union, abreast of
developments. But keeping all this secret was a real problem,  so
an  international  secret  society known  as  the  Bilderbergers,
headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was formed. Soon it  became
a  secret world government and "now controls everything,"  Cooper
said.

 All the while flying saucers were dropping like flies out of the
heavens.  In  1953  there were 10 crashes in  the  United  States
alone.  Also  that  year, astronomers  observed  huge  spaceships
heading  toward the earth and in time entering into orbit  around
the   equator.   Project   Plato  was   established   to   effect
communication with these new aliens. One of the ships landed  and
a  face-to-face  meeting  took place, and  plans  for  diplomatic
relations  were  laid. Meanwhile a race of  human-looking  aliens
warned  the U.S. government that the new visitors were not to  be
trusted  and  that  if  the government got  rid  of  its  nuclear
weapons,  the  human  aliens  would  help  us  in  our  spiritual
development,  which  would  keep  us  from  destroying  ourselves
through wars and environmental pollution. The government rejected
these overtures.

 The big-nosed grays, the ones who had been orbiting the equator,
landed  again, this time at Holloman AFB, in 1954 and reached  an
agreement with the U.S. government. These beings stated that they
were from a dying planet that orbits Betelguese. At some point in
the  not too distant future, they said, they would have to  leave
there  for good. A second meeting took place not long  afterwards
at Edwards AFB in California. This time President Eisenhower  was
there  to  sign  a  formal treaty and to  meet  the  first  alien
ambassador,  "His Omnipotent Highness Krlll,"  pronounced  Krill.
He, in common with his fellow space travelers, wore a  trilateral
insignia  on  his  uniform;  the  same  design  appears  on   all
Betelguese spacecraft.

 According  to  Cooper's account, the  treaty's  provisions  were
these: Neither side would interfere in the affairs of the  other.
The aliens would abduct humans from time to time and would return
them  unharmed, with no memory of the event. It would  provide  a
list of names of those it was going to take. The U.S.  government
would  keep  the aliens' presence a secret and it  would  receive
advanced  technology from them. The two sides would  exchange  16
individuals  each for the purpose of learning from  and  teaching
each  other. The aliens would stay on earth and the humans  would
go  to the other planet, then return after a specified period  of
time.  The two sides would jointly occupy huge underground  bases
which would be constructed at hidden locations in the Southwest.

 (It  should be noted that the people listed as members of  MJ-12
are  largely  from  the  Council on  Foreign  Relations  and  the
Trilateral Commission. These organizations play a prominent  role
in conspiracy theories of the far right. In a book on the subject
George  Johnson  writes, "After the Holocaust of  World  War  II,
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories became repugnant to all but  the
fringe of the American right. Populist fears of the power of  the
rich  became  focused  instead  on  organizations  that   promote
international capitalism, such as the Trilateral Commission,  the
Council  on Foreign Relations, and the Bilderbergers, a group  of
world  leaders  and businesspeople who held one  of  their  early
conferences on international relations at the Bilderberg Hotel in
the  Netherlands"  [Johnson,  1983].  According  to  Cooper,  the
trilateral emblem is taken directly from the alien flag. He  adds
that  under Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter MJ-12 became  known
as  the  50  Committee. Under Reagan it  was  renamed  the  PI-40
Committee.)


 By 1955, during the Eisenhower years, Cooper charged,  officials
learned for certain what they had already begun to suspect a year
earlier: that the aliens had broken the treaty before the ink  on
it  had time to dry. They were killing and mutilating both  human
beings  and  animals,  failing  to  supply  a  complete  list  of
abductees, and not returning some of those they had taken. On top
of  that,  they were conspiring with  the  Soviets,  manipulating
society  through  occultism,  witchcraft,  religion  and   secret
organizations.  Eisenhower prepared a secret executive memo,  NSC
5411,  ordering  a  study group of 35  top  members  (the  "Jason
Society")  associated  with the Council on Foreign  Relations  to
"examine  aIl  the  facts,  evidence,  lies,  and  deception  and
discover the truth of the alien question" (Cooper, 1989). Because
the  resulting meetings were held at Quantico Marine  Base,  they
were  called the Quantico meetings. Those participating  included
Edward  Teller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger  and  Nelson
Rockefeller.

 The  group  decided  that  the  danger  to  established  social,
economic, religious and political institutions was so grave  that
no one must know about the aliens, not even Congress. That  meant
that  alternative sources of funding would have to be  found.  It
also concluded that the aliens were using human organs and tissue
to replenish their deteriorating genetic structure.

 Further, according to Cooper, overtures were made to the  Soviet
Union and other nations so that all the earth could join together
to  deal with the alien menace. Research into  sophisticated  new
weapons  systems commenced. Intelligence sources  penetrated  the
Vatican  hoping to learn the Fatima prophecy which had been  kept
secret  ever  since  1917.  It was  suspected  that  the  Fatima,
Portugal,  "miracle" was an episode of alien manipulation. As  it
turned out, the prophecy stated that in 1992 a child would  unite
the  world under the banner of a false religion. By  1995  people
would  figure  out that he was the Anti-Christ.  That  same  year
World  War  III  would begin when an  alliance  of  Arab  nations
invaded Israel. This would lead to nuclear war in 1999. The  next
four  years would see horrible death and suffering all  over  the
planet. Christ would return in 2011.

 When confronted about this, claimed Cooper, the aliens  candidly
acknowledged it was true. They knew it because they had  traveled
into  the future via time machine and observed it with their  own
eyes.   They   added  that  they  created  us   through   genetic
manipulation. Later the Americans and the Soviets also  developed
time travel and confirmed the Fatima/ET vision of the future.

 In  1957 the Jason group met again, by order of  Eisenhower,  to
decide  what to do. It came up with three alternatives:  (l)  Use
nuclear bombs to blow holes in the stratosphere so that pollution
could  escape  into space. (2) Build a huge  network  of  tunnels
under the earth and save enough human beings of varying cultures,
occupations and talents so that the race could reemerge after the
nuclear  and environmental catastrophes to come. Everybody  else-
i.e.,  the  rest  of  humanity--would  be  left  on  the  surface
presumably to die. (3) Employ alien and terrestrial technology to
leave  earth  and colonize the moon (code name "Adam")  and  Mars
("Eve").  The  first alternative was deemed impractical,  so  the
Americans  and  the  Soviets started working on  the  other  two.
Meanwhile  they  decided  that the population would  have  to  be
controlled,  which  could be done most easily by killing  off  as
many  "undesirables"  as  possible. Thus AIDS  and  other  deadly
diseases  were  introduced into the population. Another  idea  to
raise needed funds was quickly acted on: sell drugs on a  massive
scale.  An  ambitious  young member of  the  Council  on  Foreign
Relations,  a Texas oil-company president named George Bush,  was
put in charge of the project, with the aid of the CIA. "The  plan
worked better than anyone had thought " CooPer said. "The CIA now
controls  all  the worlds [sic] illegal  drug  markets"  (Cooper,
1989).

 Unknown to just about everybody, a secret  American/Soviet/alien
space  base  existed on the dark side of the moon. By  the  early
1960s  human colonies were thriving on the surface of  Mars.  All
the  while the naive people of the earth were led to believe  the
Soviets  and the Americans were something other than the  closest
allies. But Cooper's story got even more bizarre and byzantine.

 He  claimed that in 1963, when President Kennedy found out  some
of  what was going on, he gave an ultimatum to MJ-12: get out  of
the  drug business. He also declared that in 1964 he  would  tell
the  American people about the alien visitation. Agents of  MJ-12
ordered  his assassination. Kennedy was murdered in full view  of
many  hundreds of onlookers, none of whom apparently noticed,  by
the  Secret  Service  agent driving the President's  car  in  the
motorcade.

 In   1969,  reported  Cooper,  a  confrontation  between   human
scientists  and  aliens at the Dulce laboratory resulted  in  the
former's being taken hostage by the latter. Soldiers who tried to
free the scientists were killed, unable to overcome the  superior
alien  weapons.  The  incident  led  to  a  two-year  rupture  in
relations. The alliance was resumed in 1971 and continues to this
day,  even as a vast invisible financial empire run by  the  CIA,
the NSA and the Council on Foreign Relations runs drugs, launders
money and encourages massive street crime so that Americans  will
be  susceptible to gun-control legislation. The CIA has  gone  so
far  as to employ drugs and hypnosis to  cause  mentally-unstable
individuals  to  commit mass murder of schoolchildren  and  other
innocents, the point being to encourage anti-gun hysteria. All of
this  is  part of the plot, aided and abetted by the  mass  media
(also  under  the  secret  government's  control),  to  so  scare
Americans  that they will soon accept the declaration of  martial
law  when  that  happens, people will be rounded up  and  put  in
concentration  camps  already in place. From there they  will  be
flown  to the moon and Mars to work as slave labor in  the  space
colonies.


 The conspirators already run the world. As Cooper put it,  "Even
a cursory investigation by the most inexperienced researcher will
show that the members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the
Trilateral  commission control the major foundations, all of  the
major media and publishing interests, the largest banks, all  the
major  corporations, the - upper echelons of the government,  and
many other vital interests."

Reaction  to  Lear  and  Cooper:  Whereas  Lear  had  felt   some
obligation  to  name  a  source or two, or  at  least  to  mutter
something  about  "unnamed sources," Cooper told  his  lurid  and
outlandish tale as if it were so self-evidently true that sources
or  supporting  data  were irrelevant. And  to  the  enthusiastic
audiences   flocking  to  Cooper's  lectures,  no  evidence   was
necessary.  By  the  fall  of the year  Cooper  was  telling  his
stories--whose  sources  were, in fact,  flying-saucer  folklore,
AFOSI  disinformation  unleashed during  the  Bennewitz  episode,
conspiracy  literature, and outright fiction--to large crowds  of
Californians  willing to pay $l0 or $15 apiece for the thrill  of
being scared silly.

 Lear  and Cooper soon were joined by two other tellers of  tales
of  UFO horrors and Trilateral conspiracies, William English  and
John Grace (who goes under the pseudonym "Val Valarian" and heads
the Nevada Aerial Research Group in Las Vegas).

 Few  if any mainstream ufologists took these  stories  seriously
and at first treated them as something of a bad joke. But when it
became  clear  that  Lear, Cooper  and  company  were  commanding
significant  media  attention and finding a following  among  the
larger  public interested in ufology's fringes, where  a  claim's
inherent  improbability  had never been seen as  an  obstacle  to
believe  in it, the leaders of the UFO community grew  ever  more
alarmed.

 One leader who was not immediately alarmed was Walter H. Andrus,
Jr.,  director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), one of the  two
largest  UFO organizations in the United States (the other  being
the  J.  Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies  [CUFOS]).  In  1987,
before Lear had proposed what some wags would call the Dark  Side
Hypothesis,  he had offered to host the 1989 MUFON conference  in
Las  Vegas.  Andrus  agreed. But as Lear's  true  beliefs  became
known,  leading  figures  within MUFON  expressed  concern  about
Lear's  role  in the conference. When Andrus  failed  to  respond
quickly, MUFON officials were infuriated.

 Facing  a  possible  palace revolt, Andrus  informed  Lear  that
Cooper, whom Lear had invited to speak at the conference, was not
an  acceptable choice. But to the critics on the MUFON board  and
elsewhere  in  the organization, this was hardly enough.  One  of
them,  longtime  ufologist  Richard Hall,  said  this  was  "like
putting  a  Band-Aid on a hemorrhage" (Hall, 1989). In  a  heated
telephone exchange Andrus called Hall's objections to Lear  "just
one  man's opinion" and claimed support, which turned out not  to
exist,  from other MUFON notables. In a  widely-distributed  open
letter to Andrus, Hall wrote, "Having Lear run the symposium  and
be  a  major speaker at it is comparable to NICAP in  the  1960's
having  George  Adamski  run a NICAP conference!  "  (NICAP,  the
National  Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, of  which
Hall  was executive secretary in the late 1950s and much  of  the
1960s,   was  a  conservative  UFO-research  organization   which
attacked  as  fraudulent the claims of Adamski, who  wrote  books
about his meetings with Venusians and distributed photographs  of
what  he said were their spaceships.) Hall went on, "You seem  to
be going for the colorful and the spectacular rather than for the
critical-minded approach of science; you even expressed the view-
in  effect-that having a panel to question Lear critically  would
be good show biz and the 'highlight' of the symposium. Maybe  so,
but it obviously would dominate the entire program, grab off  all
major  news  media attention, and put UFO research in  the  worst
possible  light." Hall declared, "I am hereby resigning from  the
MUFON Board and I request that my name be removed from all  MUFON
publications or papers that indicate me to be a Board Member."

 Fearing more resignations, Andrus moved to make Lear barely more
than a guest at his own conference. He was not to lecture  there,
as  previously planned, and hosting duties would be handled,  for
the most part, by others. Lear ended up arranging an "alternative
conference" at which he, Cooper, English and Don Ecker  presented
the latest elaborations on the Dark Side Hypothesis.
 Meanwhile  another  storm  was brewing. On  March  1,  1989,  an
Albuquerque   ufologist,  Robert  Hastings,  issued   a   13-page
statement, with 37 pages of appended documents, and mailed it  to
many  of  ufology's most prominent individuals.  Hastings  opened
with these remarks:

 "First,  it  has  been established that  'Falcon,'  one  of  the
principle  [sic]  sources of the MJ-12 material,  is  Richard  C.
Doty,  formerly  attached  to District 17  Air  Force  Office  of
Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  at  Kirtland  Air  Force  Base,
Albuquerque,  New  Mexico. Sgt. Doty retired from  the  U.S.  Air
Force on October 1, 1988.


 "How do I know that Doty is 'Falcon?' During a recent  telephone
conversation,  Linda  Moulton Howe told me that  when  Sgt.  Doty
invited  her to his office at Kirtland AFB in early  April  1983,
and  showed her a purportedly authentic U.S. government  document
on  UFOs, he identified himself as code-name 'Falcon' and  stated
that it was Bill Moore who had given him that name.

 "Also,  in  early  December  1988,  a  ranking  member  of   the
production   team  responsible  for  the  'UFO  Cover   Up?-Live'
television documentary confirmed that Doty is 'Falcon.' This same
individual  also identified the second MJ-12 source who  appeared
on  the  program,  'Condor'  as Robert  Collins  who  was,  until
recently,  a  Captain in the U.S. Air Force. Like  Doty,  he  was
stationed  at  KAFB  when he left the service  late  last  year."
(Collins,  a scientist, was assigned to the plasma physics  group
at  Sandia National Laboratories on the Kirtland Air Force  Base.
Following his retirement he moved to Indiana and remains actively
interested in UFOs.)

 Hastings   reviewed  evidence  of  Doty's  involvement  in   the
concoction   of  various  questionable  documents  and   stories,
including  the  Ellsworth tale and the Weitzel  affair.  He  also
noted important discrepancies between the paper Howe saw and  the
MJ-12  briefing document. For example, while the first  mentioned
the alleged Aztec crash, the second said nothing about it at all.
Hastings wondered, "[I]f the briefing paper that Sgt. Doty showed
to Linda Howe was genuine, what does that say about the  accuracy
(and  authenticity) of the Eisenhower document? If, on the  other
hand, the former was bogus and was meant to mislead Howe for some
reason,  what  does  that  say  about  Richard  'Falcon'   Doty's
reliability  as  a  source  for  MJ-12  material  as  a   whole?"
(Hastings,  1989). Hastings also had much critical to  say  about
Moore, especially about an incident in which Moore had flashed  a
badge in front of ufologist/cover-up investigator Lee Graham  and
indicated  he  was working with the government on  a  project  to
release  UFO  information. (Moore would characterize  this  as  a
misguided practical joke.)

 Both  Moore  and Doty denied that the latter  was  Falcon.  They
claimed  Doty had been given that pseudonym long after  the  1983
meeting with Howe. Howe, however, stuck by her account. Moore and
Doty said the real Falcon, an older man than Doty had been in the
studio audience as the video of his interview was being broadcast
on  UFO  Cover-up.  .  . Live. Doty himself  was  in  New  Mexico
training with the state police.

Moore's  Confession:  By  mid-1989  the  two  most  controversial
figures in ufology were Moore and Lear. Moore's MUFON lecture  on
July 1 did nothing to quiet his legion of critics. On his arrival
in  Las Vegas, Moore checked into a different hotel from the  one
at which the conference was being held. He already had refused to
submit his paper for publication in the symposium proceedings, so
no  one  knew what he would say. He had also stipulated  that  he
would accept no questions from the floor.

 Moore's speech stunned and angered much of the audience. At  one
point   the  shouts  and  jeers  of  Lear's   partisans   brought
proceedings  to a halt until order was restored.  Moore  finished
and exited immediately. He left Las Vegas not long afterwards.

 In his lecture Moore spoke candidly, for the first time, of  his
part in the counterintelligence operation against Bennewitz.  "My
role  in the affair," he said, "was largely that of a  freelancer
providing information on Paul's current thinking and activities."
Doty,  "faithfully carrying out orders which he personally  found
distasteful," was one of those involved in the effort to  confuse
and  discredit Bennewitz. Because of his success at this  effort,
Moore suggested, Doty was chosen by the real "Falcon" as "liaison
person,  although I really don't know. Frankly, I  don't  believe
that  Doty does either. In my opinion he was simply a pawn  in  a
much larger game, just as I was."

 From  disinformation  passed on by AFOSI sources,  and  his  own
observations  and  guesses,  according to  Moore,  "by  mid-1982"
Bennewitz had put together a story that "contained virtually  all
of  the  elements  found  in the current  crop  of  rumors  being
circulated around the UFO community." Moore was referring to  the
outlandish  tales Lear and Cooper were telling. Moore  said  that
"when  I first ran into the disinformation operation . . .  being
run on Bennewitz . . . [i)t seemed to me . . . I was in a  rather
unique position. There I was with my foot . . . in the door of  a
secret  counterintelligence  game that gave every  appearance  of
being  somehow directly connected to a high-level government  UFO
project, and, judging by the positions of the people I knew to be
directly  involved with it, definitely had something to  do  with
national  security!  There was no way I was going  to  allow  the
opportunity  to  pass me by without learning at  least  something
about  what was going on. . . . I would play  the  disinformation
game,  get  my  hands  dirty just  often  enough  to  lead  those
directing  the  process into believing that I was  doing  exactly
what  they wanted me to do, and all the while continue to  burrow
my  way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible  about
who  was directing it and why." Some of the same people who  were
passing alleged UFO secrets on to Moore were also involved in the
operation against Bennewitz. Moore knew that some of the material
he  was  getting--essentially  a mild version  of  the  Bennewitz
scenario, without the horror, paranoia and conspiracy--was false,
but  he (along with Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, to  whom
he  confided the cover-up story in June 1982; Friedman,  however,
would  not learn of Moore's role in the Bennewitz  episode  until
seven years later) felt that some of it was probably true,  since
an  invariable  characteristic  of  disinformation  is  that   it
contains some facts. Moore also said that Linda Howe had been the
victim of one of Doty's disinformation operations.

 Before  he stopped cooperating with such schemes in 1984,  Moore
said,  he had given "routine information" to AFOSI about  certain
other  individuals in the UFO community. Subsequently he  claimed
that  during this period this emphasis) "three other  members  of
the  UFO  community . . . were actively doing the same  thing.  I
have  since  learned of a fourth. . . . All  four  are  prominent
individuals   whose   identities,  if  disclosed,   would   cause
considerable  controversy in the UFO community and bring  serious
embarrassment  to two of its major organizations. To the best  of
my  knowledge,  at least two of these people are  still  actively
involved" (Moore, 1989b).

 Although  he would not reveal the identities of  the  government
informants  within  ufology,  Moore gave  the  names  of  several
persons "who were the subject of intelligence community  interest
between 1980 and 1984." They were:

 (1)  Len  Stringfield,  a ufologist known for  his  interest  in
crashed-disc   stories;  in  1980  he  had  been  set  up  by   a
counterintelligence operative who gave him phony pictures of what
purported to be humanoids in cold storage.

 (2) The late Pete Mazzola, whose knowledge of film footage  from
a  never-publicized  Florida UFO case was of  great  interest  to
counterintelligence types. Moore was directed to urge Mazzola  to
send the footage to ufologist Kal Korff (who knew nothing of  the
scheme) for analysis; then Moore would make a copy and pass it on
to  Doty. But Mazzola never got the film, despite  promises,  and
the  incident came to nothing. "I was left with the  impression,"
Moore  wrote,  "that  the  file  had  been  intercepted  and  the
witnesses somehow persuaded to cease communication with Mazzola."

 (3)  Peter  Gersten,  legal counsel  for  Citizens  Against  UFO
Secrecy  (CAUS),  who had spearheaded  a  (largely  unsuccessful)
legal suit against the NSA seeking UFO information.

 (4) Larry Fawcett, an official of CAUS and coauthor of a book on
the cover-up, Clear Intent (1984).

 (5)  James  and  Coral Lorenzen, the  directors  of  the  Aerial
Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) periodically "subjects  of
on-again,  off  again interest . . .  mostly  passive  monitoring
rather  than active meddling," according to Moore.  Between  1980
and  1982 APRO employed a "cooperative" secretary who  passed  on
confidential material to counterintelligence personnel.

 (6)  Larry  W. Bryant, who was battling without success  in  the
courts  to have UFO secrets revealed. Moore said, "His name  came
up often in discussions but I never had any direct involvement in
whatever activities revolved around him."

 These revelations sent shock waves through the UFO community. In
September CAUS devoted virtually all of an issue of its  magazine
Just  Cause to a harshly critical review of  Moore's  activities.
Barry  Greenwood  declared that the "outrageousness"  of  Moore's
conduct "cannot be described. Moore, one of the major critics  of
government  secrecy on UFOs, had covertly informed on people  who
thought he was their friend and colleague. Knowing full well that
the  government  people  with whom he  was  dealing  were  active
disinformants,  Moore  pursued  a  relationship  with  them   and
observed  the  deterioration of Paul Bennewitz'[s]  physical  and
mental  health.  . . . Moore reported the effects  of  the  false
information  regularly to some of the very same people  who  were
'doing  it'  to Paul. And Moore boasted in his speech as  to  how
effective it was" (Greenwood, 1989). Greenwood complained further
about  Moore's  admission that on the disastrous Cover-up .  .  .
Live  show Falcon and Condor had said things that they knew  were
untrue.  "In  the rare situation where two hours  of  prime  time
television  are given over to a favorable presentation  of  UFOs,
here we have a fair portion of the last hour wasted in presenting
what  Moore admits to be false data. . . . Yet he saw fit  to  go
ahead and carry on a charade, making UFO research look ridiculous
in  the process. Remarks by Falcon and Condor about  the  aliens'
lifestyle  and  preference for Tibetan music and  strawberry  ice
cream were laughable." So far as Greenwood and CAUS, skeptical of
the MJ-12 briefing document from the first, were concerned, "July
1, 1989, may well be remembered in the history of UFO research as
the day when the 'Majestic 12' story came crashing to Earth in  a
heap of rubble. Cause of death: Suicide!"

 Nonetheless  it  seemed  unlikely that MJ-12,  EBEs,  and  other
cover-up  matters would pass away soon. The Dark Siders  appeared
well  on their way to starting a new occult movement  in  America
and   elsewhere.   Among  movie  conservative   ufologists   many
legitimate  questions about conceivably more substantive  matters
remained  to  be  answered.  A  reinvestigation  of  the  Roswell
incident  by  Don Schmitt and Kevin D. Randle of  CUFOS  produced
what appeared to be solid new evidence of a UFO crash and  cover
up.  The  emergence  of  Robert  Lazar,  who  even  a  mainstream
journalist such as television reporter George Knapp concluded  is
telling  the truth as he knows it possibly suggested a degree  of
substance  to recurrent rumors about developments in Area 51  and
S4.  Even  Moore's  critics were  puzzled  by  the  extraordinary
interest  of  intelligence operatives in ufologists and  the  UFO
phenomenon,   going   back  in  time  long   before   Bennewitz's
interception  of low-frequency signals at Kirtland and  ahead  to
the present. Why go to all this trouble and expense, with so many
persons  over  such a period of time, if there are  no  real  UFO
secrets to protect?

 Moore  says  he is still working with the "birds,"  who  are  as
active as ever. The birds tell him, he says, that  disinformation
is  used  not  only against ufologists  but  even  against  those
insiders like themselves who are privy to the cover-up. Those  in
charge are "going to great lengths to mislead their own  people."
At  one point the birds were told that there is no  substance  to
abduction reports, only to learn later, by accident, that a major
high-level study had been done. "Even people with a need to  know
didn't know about it," he says. "The abduction mess caused a  lot
of  trouble.  There may have been an official  admission  of  the
cover-up by now if the abductions had not come into prominence in
the 1980s."

 As  for  the  stories  of  ongoing  contact  between  the   U.S.
government  and  extraterrestrial biological  entities,  he  says
there is, in his observation, a "pretty good possibility,  better
than three to one," that such a thing is happening. "But I  don't
think  we  can communicate with them. Perhaps we  only  intercept
their communications. Or maybe they communicate with us."

 He  thinks  he  has found MJ-12. "It's not in  a  place  anybody
looked,"  he  says. "Not an agency one would have  expected.  But
when you think about it, it fits there" (Moore, 1990).

 Doty, now a New Mexico State Police officer, was decertified  as
an  AFOSI agent on July 15, 1986, for "misconduct" related to  an
incident  (not  concerned with UFOs) that occurred while  he  was
stationed  in West Germany. In August Doty requested a  discharge
from  the  Air Force and was sent to New Jersey to  be  separated
from  the  service.  But then, Doty  says,  the  Senior  Enlisted
Advisor for AFOSI made a trip to the Military Personnel Center at
Randolph  AFB,  Texas,  and  asked that  Doty  be  reassigned  to
Kirtland,  where  his son lived. In September Col.  Richard  Law,
Commander of AFOSI District 70, rescinded Doty's  decertification
and  assigned  him to Kirtland as a  services  career  specialist
(i.e.,  an  Air Force recruiter). When he left the Air  Force  in
October  1988,  he  was  superintendent  of  the  1606   Services
Squadron.  Doty remains close to Moore and  uncommunicative  with
nearly everyone else. All he will say is that one day a book will
tell  his  side  of  the story and  back  it  up  with  "Official
Government Documents" (Doty, 1989).
