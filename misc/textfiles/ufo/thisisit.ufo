MAJESTIC TWELVE  (PROWORD) MAJIC

MAJESTIC TWELVE, MAJESTIC 12, MAJESTIC-12, MJ-12, MAJIC, are all forms of the
code name for the control group authorized by President Truman on 09/24/47.
The Director of the Central Intelligenge Agency (CIA) is the Director of
Majestic Twelve, MJ-1.  The control group was formed to oversee a TOP SECRET
Research and Development & Intelligence Operation and was responsible only to
the President.  The need for this group was dictated by the finding of a
downed FLYING SAUCER scattered over 2 sites near the town of Roswell New
Mexico in July 1947.  The dead bodys of 4 very small human like ALIENS were
also found.  MAJESTIC TWELVE is the most highly classified secret in the
United States and its existance has never been divulged to Congress.  The
funds for MJ-12 and Aquarius are CIA confidential (non-appropriated).

PROJECTS under MAJESTIC TWELVE
The operations listed here were current as late as 1976 with absolute
certainty and are still operational to the best of our knowledge.  The names
of the original operations were changed several times over the years and
eventually evolved into those listed.

PROJECT SIGN  (PROWORD) MAJIC
The first project under MAJESTIC TWELVE.  The mission of project sign was
essentially the same as that which PROJECT AQUARIUS evolved into.  PROJECT
SIGN referred to aliens as Extraterrestrial Biological Entities.  The reasons
for the absorbtion of PROJECT SIGN by PROJECT AQUARIUS were mainly of a
political and security nature.  PROJECT AQUARIUS stripped the Air Force and
Army Generals of their historic control of the UFO/IAC projects and placed
most of it under the Intelligence umbrella.

PROJECT AQUARIUS  (PROWORD) MAJIC
Established in 1953 by President Eisenhower under control of MJ-12 and PROJECT
SIGN.  The Project contains all information collected by the United States
since it began investigating UFO's (Unidentified Flying Objects) and IAC's
(Identified Alien Craft).  At the time we saw this information it existed in
approximately 15 or 16 volumes.  This project became an independent project
when PROJECT SIGN was eliminated in 1960. PROJECT AQUARIUS referred to aliens
as Alien Life Forms. The mission of PROJECT AQUARIUS was to gather all
scientific, technological, medical, and intelligence information from UFO &
IAC sightings and contacts with Alien Life Forms.  The information was to be
used in the space program.

PROJECT SIGMA  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS
Established in 1954 as part of PROJECT SIGN. The mission of PROJECT SIGMA was
to establish communication with the aliens. First communication was
established in 1959 through binary computer language. On April 25, 1964 a USAF
(OSI) officer met with aliens at a prearranged desert location in New Mexico.
Information was exchanged and a basic understanding was reached after several
hours.  It was learned through this effort that several species of alien
life existed. Communication was eventually established with all of them.
Through communications it was determined that 3 catagorys existed.  The three
catagorys are MALEVOLENT (DANGEROUS), BENEVOLENT (GOOD-HELPFUL), and NEUTRAL
(OBSERVERS ONLY)  The project has been extremely successful.

PROJECT PLATO (PROWORD) AQUARIUS Established in 1960 after the United States
established communications with the aliens.  The mission of PROJECT PLATO was
to establ ish diplomatic re lations with the aliens. Project Plato made
agreements in order to prevent hostilitys between the United States and the
aliens.  An agreement was made with the MALEVOLENT aliens whereby they could
abduct humans.  The purpose of these abductions were to provide blood and
other biological fluids as food for the aliens. The aliens agreed to furnish a
list periodically to MJ-12 of the names of those abducted.  PROJECT PLATO took
whatever steps neccessary to prevent public disclosure.


* PROJECT PLUTO  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS
Established in 1947 after the Roswell incident.  The mission of PROJECT PLUTO
was to recover all crashed or downed alien craft, to recover all evidence of
alien presence or technology, and to recover all alien bodies (alive or dead).
PROJECT PLUTO developed cover stories to satisfy press and civilian curiosity.
PROJECT PLUTO was authorized use of deadly force and/or relocation to insure
secrecy.  PROJECT PLUTO was responsible for and biological intelligence of the
Alien Life Forms.

PROJECT POUNCE  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS Established in 1968.  The mission of
PROJECT POUNCE was to evaluate all UFO/IAC information pertaining to space
technology.  The goal was to duplicate the technology and/or improve upon it.
Ultimate use of the technology would establish the United States as the
dominate world power and close the gap in any confrontation with the aliens.

PROJECT REDLIGHT  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS Established in 1954.  The mission
REDLIGHT was to test a recovered alien craft.  The mission was accomplished in
part only.  PROJECT REDLIGHT was terminated in 1963 after every (flyable)
recovered craft exploded during test flights. There were no survivors among
the human test pilots.

PROJECT SNOWBIRD  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS Established in 1972.  The mission of
PROJECT SNOWBIRD was to test fly a recovered alien craft.  The project was on
going the last time I saw this information.

PROJECT ????????  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS (NOTE...We are recall the name of this
project nor have we been able to get response from anyone on it.  At the time
we saw the information the project was ongoing.  It cannot be determined if
this project is still in existence.) The mission of this project was to
develop a low frequency pulsed sound generator.  The energy produced from this
generator was to be concentrated so that it could be aimed and used as a
weapon in order to destroy the alien craft and beam weapons.  The alien beam
weapons were described as ange but able to incapacitate or destroy any weapons
system known to date (1972).  The aliens also possess a beam weapon which is
described as being able to paralyse any human within range.  Tests were
described as having shown that the alien craft and weapons were extremely
sensitive to low frequency pulsed sound waves.  This weapon was to be used to
incapacitate the alien defenses in order to allow PROJECT EXCALIBUR to succeed
in its mission.  The initial technology used in this project was capture the
Germans during WW- II.  The German sound generators were described as being
able to knock down reinforced concrete buildings and shatter 4" thick armour
from a great range.  This technology is believed to further substantiate that
Germany had recovered alien craft and had possibly had some dealings with the
aliens prior to or during WW-II.  Documents captured during and after WW-II
indicated that an alien craft had been recovered by Germany in 1939.  A German
built flying saucer was captured dur last few months of WW-II.

PROJECT EXCALIBUR  (PROWORD) AQUARIUS Established in 1972.  The mission of
PROJECT EXCALIBUR is to develop a weapons system capable of destroying the
alien underground base after the alien beam weapons have been incapacitated or
destroyed.  The alien underground base is located beneath an indian
reservation near the small town of Dulce, New Mexico.  The device must be
capable of penetrating 1,000 meters of tufa / hard pack soil and sustain no
operational damage.  This typ is commonly found in New Mexico where the alien
base is located.  Missile apogee must not exceed 30,000 feet AGL.  Impact
deviation will now exceed 50 meters.  The device will carry a 1 megaton
warhead.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK A U.S. Air Force project establiahed to determine whether
UFO's pose a threat to the security of the United States and to determine
whether UFO's exhibit any unique scientific information or advanced technology
which could contribute to scientific or technical research.  PROJECT was
successful in its primary mission outlined above.  PROJECT BLUE BOOK was not
quite so successful in its secondary mission which was to publicly explain
away the UFO phenomenon as natural or known phenomenon in order to eleminate
public interest.  To completely fulfill the secondary mission it was decided
that an outside commission of distinguished scientists would be convened in
order to permanantly lay the issue to rest.  After this 'study' was completed
(Condon Commission) the Air Force state the continuation of Project Blue Book
cannot be justified, either on the ground of national security or in the
interest of science.  PROJECT BLUE BOOK was abandoned and its mission and
information was consolidated under PROJECT AQUARIUS in 1969.

SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS Contracted to the University
of Colorado in 1966 and Chaired by Dr. Edward U. Condon.  The results of the
panel were dictated before the first meeting.  Despite objections of the other
panel members, Dr. Cond le to fulfill the mission.  The general conclusion was
that "nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has
added to scientific knowledge."  A panel from the National Academy of Sciences
agreed.  The press and the public were satisfied. Except for a hard core
element of UFO believers the issue died in the public forum.

OPERATION UFO  (NSA OPERATION IN SUPPORT OF PROJECT PLUTO) The mission of
Operation UFO was to form intelligence teams versed in all of the knowledge
learned which would be the first on scene of any UFO crash site in order to
secure the technology and prevent it from falling into foreign hands.  Several
teams existed over the world.  The United States was specifically concerned
that it did not fall into Soviet hands.  This mission was to be accomplished
no matter the country of occurrance.  Many subsequent ALIEN CRAFT recoverys
would occur in foreign countrys as well as the United States.  UFO was also
used to recover downed space hardware (especially So d to recover nuclear
weapons which became lost (usually by accident).

OPERATION MOONDUST  (SUPPORTED SPACE PROGRAM & UFO) The mission of Operation
Moondust was to provide a cover which would neutralize public curiosity while
recovery of an ALIEN CRAFT was being conducted.  The teams that made up the
compliment of Moondust were the same teams that made up UFO. Moondust was made
public and its mission (to the public) was to identify and recover United
States space hardware which might fall to earth. s a bonified mission when
circumstances dictated.

OPERATION BLUEFLY  (SUPPORTED UFO & MOONDUST) The mission of operation Bluefly
was to provide QUICK REACTION COMBAT TEAMS known as ALPHA teams (fight for
technology if neccessary), mechanical and technological support in recovery,
rapid and secure transport to secure storage and examination areas.  There are
several of these storage and examination areas in order to limit distance
traveled and thus limit the possible chance of an accident that cou e cargo to
public knowledge.  Several teams existed over the world.  Recovery and
transport of both EBEs (dead or alive) and Alien craft were accomplished.
Bluefly was also utilized in event of recovery of space objects (of
terrestrial origin), and event of recovery of lost nuclear weapons (usually
due to accident).


NOTE....This account of the history and current status of MAJESTIC TWELVE and
the Alien Life Forms has been kept brief. We believe that the intent, however,
has been served with th on provided.  The whole story would fill several
hundred volumes.  We realize that even with the combined effort of several
memorys we have probably made some mistakes.  We have tried to minimize the
mistakes and feel that what is represented is true and correct to the best of
our combined knowledge.
