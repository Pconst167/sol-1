                    The latest on the controlled generation of
                                  Ball Lightning

                    basic info from the September 90' issue of
                                 Electronics World

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       A team of  Japanese  researchers,  under  the  guidance of Professor
       Yoshihiko Otsuki at  Tokyo's  Waseda  University  have  successfully
       generated ball lighting.

       Detailed reports are  not  available  at  this  time   although  the
       experiment is known to have been conducted out of doors.  The output
       from a 2KW microwave oven was attached to a TUBE OF COPPER WIRE MESH
       which then served as an OPEN WAVEGUIDE.

       When the oven was turned on, the tube produced a glowing ball 2 to 3
       centimeters in diameter  that  floated  along  the mesh for nearly 2
       minutes.

       During this period, the ball was  seen  to  change  from  white to a
       dazzling orange.

       Vangard notes...

           Researchers in the field of ball energy no doubt  are  aware  of
           the accidental generation of ball lightning onboard submarines.

           Relays used on subs have contacts which have a downward curve on
           the end  which  opens.   The  idea  is  to  quench  the  intense
           electrical arc which helps to reduce the life of the contacts.

           This type of contact acts as a  sort of waveguide to "shape" the
           high intensity electrical field (no doubt having  metal  residue
           in addition to carbon) into the shape of a sphere.

           The description of the antics which the submarine ball lightning
           carried out  are very similar.  A spherical waveguide would be a
           much more logical means of generating  a  3  dimensional  sphere
           which, with sufficient velocity, could be thrown  off the end of
           the tube.

           information on the Kugelblitz and Feurball fighters developed by
           the Germans prior to the end of WWII.

           In addition,   you  might  find  the  article  by  Larry  Spring
           interesting which  is  entitled   SPHERE1.ASC.   It  deals  with
           Larry's discovery that all propagating waves take  the form of a
           sphere.

           We will  keep  you  informed of anything else we find since this
           subject will eventually lead to  a  form of levitation much akin
           to the Kugelblitz technology which disappeared  at  the  end  of
           WWII.
