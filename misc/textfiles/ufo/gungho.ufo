Stealth - And Beyond - A look at Aurora and Some "Unfunded Opportunities" (UFO)

During this article,
the Mach 3-plus (2,000 mph), SR-71 Blackbird hasbeen referred to for comparison
several times. The SR first flew about 25 years ago. Twenty years or so before
that, the hottest thing in th eair was the 450 mph P-51 Mustang. Today, there
is Aurora, the codename given to a methane-powered, hypersonic,
strategic-reconnais-sance aircraft capable of Mach 7 (5,000 mph) speed in the
250,000 foot regime. Aurora has a three-man crew and has been operational
since the mid-1980s, after a testing period in the Nellis Range. It is 
refueled after conventional takeoff by a specially rigged KC-135Q tanker jet, 
and can fly from Nellis to Kadena Air Force Base in Japan in less than two
and a half hours.   Aurora first came to public attention in 1985, when an 
unclassified procurement document disclosed its existence. Disclosure
heightened speculation that the system was a stealth fighter or bomber, and 
program managers were happy to play along. Aurora's budget increase from
$80 million in FY 86 to $2.3 billion in FY 87 was unprecedented, given that:
(a) black-project budget figures are normally withheld; and (b) $80 million
is very little for development, and $2.3 billion is a lot for operations.
As for "UnFunded Opportunities," these are programs dealing with technology
levels so advanced that one Air Force officer involved in SR-71 development
said: "We are flight-testing vehicles that defy description. To compare them
conceptually to the SR-71 would be like comparing Leonardo da Vinci's
parachute design to the space shuttle."   Other officers are similarily
emphatic about the nature of these new systems.   "We have things that
are so far beyond the comphrehension of the average aviation authority as to
be really alien to our way of thinking," says one retired colonel.   Rumour
has it some of these systems involve force-field technology, gravity-drive
systems, and "flying saucer" designs. Rumour further has it that these designs
are not necessarily of Earth human origin - but of who might have designed them
or helped us to do it, there is less talk.   "Let's just put it this way,"
explained one retired Lockheed engineer.  "We have things flying in the Nevada
desert that would make George Lucas drool."   (Editor's note and conclusion: 
The Air Force has had a unit at Nellis for several years; its name: Alien
Technology Center. The first question is, do you think they are studying
Mexicans?   The center is rumored to have obtained alien ( not earth )
equipment and, at times personnel to help develop our new aircraft star wars
weaponry, etc. Yes, I know I sound crazy, but the rumour is aufully solid!
The Alien Technology Center is for real. Something remarkable has caused the
Russians to suddenly want to play ball, and I personally believe this could be
it.  Sure, it sounds strange, but the most advanced known airplane in today's
world (SR-71) was secretly flying in 1963-64.  Do you really think our best,
23 years later, is the F-16?)
