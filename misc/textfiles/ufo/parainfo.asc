                  HOW TO BECOME A PARANET AFFILIATE


ParaNet(sm)  Information  Service  is looking for  new  affiliates  to
connect to our international electronic network via PC and  main-frame
computers.  We are the world's largest and most reliable media  outlet
concerning the paranormal with emphasis on unidentified flying objects
(UFOs).

ParaNet(sm)  is  not  for  everyone,  though.   Affiliate   membership
requires  that you have a serious interest in exploring the  mysteries
of  the  phenomenon and are interested in teaming up  with  recognized
scientific/researchers  in the field.  Our affiliates will maintain  a
high standard of objectivity and will represent our organization in as
professional a manner as possible.  Your users will be presented  with
a forum for fair and open-minded thought provoking discussion.

You do not have to change the flavor of your current setup, nor do you
have to be operating a BBS at the current time to become an affiliate.
All  that  is  required  is a separate and  distinct  place  for  your
ParaNet(sm) section.

There  are many benefits in becoming an affiliate.  Mostly,  you  will
find  yourself  on  the cutting edge  of  discovery.   ParaNet(sm)  is
growing  rapidly and many programs are being implemented  whereby  you
can  take  an active part in the research and investigation  of  UFOs.
You will get your information first hand, often before the major media
begins broadcasting it.  ParaNet(sm) has built relationships with many
prominent  and  leading  researchers,  such  as  Budd  Hopkins,  Bruce
Maccabee,  Dr. Richard Haines, and many others.  Often,  these  people
take  part in our forums.  You and your users will have direct  access
to these people and their findings.

We are very interested in affiliates which can take an active interest
in their local community.  We are interested in your participation  in
providing   newsclippings,   interaction  with   your   local   radio,
television  and newspaper outlets, and some field  investigation.   If
you  have the spare time for these activities, we are very  interested
in a relationship with you.

The following items are requirements for membership:

1)  A PC computer capable of operating Fido compatible mailer and  BBS
software.   Most of our affiliates operate IBM compatible machines  as
there is more Fido compatible software available almost free of charge
for these type of machines.

2)  A minimum of 2400 bps modem.

3)   A system which is available 24-hours per day and is considered  a
"Continuous Mail" system.

4)   You  cannot  be operating a mandatory  pay  system.   ParaNet(sm)
requires  that all users have free access, although we do encourage  a
user contribute a fee for access to our files library.

5)   You  do  not  have  to  have  a  FidoNet  node  number  to  join.
ParaNet(sm)  assigns  you a private network number, although  you  are
free to use your currently assigned number.

6)   ParaNet affiliates may not carry adult-theme echoes in  a  public
area.   This is our only requirement as far as "flavor" is  concerned.
We do not feel that this type of BBS represents our image well.

7)   You must provide a separate and unique ParaNet(sm) area  on  your
BBS.   If you subscribe to our file service, you must also  provide  a
separate files area for the ParaNet(sm) section.  We do not allow  any
mixing of our areas with other subjects or interests.

8)  Our affiliates must be over the age of 18 years of age.

9)   We  have  two levels of membership.  One is free  and  the  other
requires a small investment.  They are:

     a)   Conference Affiliate:  Under this program, you are under  no
obligation  to  join.   You  will be provided with  all  of  our  echo
conferences.  From time-to-time, we upload a file to the message area,
however  you do not receive our files library, nor do you receive  new
files as they become available to us.

     b)  Full-service Affiliate:  Under this program, you receive  all
of  our  echo  conferences,  our comprehensive  files  library  and  a
subscription to our bi-monthly news magazine, The Continuum.  The  fee
for this is $500.00 and $100.00 per year.  The files library is
contained on  disks formatted  to  your choice, in either 3.5 or
5.25  floppy.   You  also receive  new files as they become available to
us.  To apply for  this status, fill out the additional enclosed application
and mail it  with your check made payable to ParaNet.
