STEIN1.TXT  -  Text file that was scanned and processed via OCR by
^^^^^^^^^^^^   Harvey Stewart [UFONET I] .
               The file was run through the Microsoft Word 5.0 spell
               checker following conversion so most errors in character
               recognition should be ok. Now that I finally have OCR
               software that works there should be lots of files on the
               way so stay tuned.

               Do you have important material that needs to be shared?
               Contact us here at UFONET I and perhaps we can convert
               your document to a text file for you using our OCR
               software and hardware. You can contact either myself
               Harvey Stewart or the Sysop of this board Tom Mickus
               for details.

  Dear Mr.  Steinman :

          This is in response to your letter of May  8,  1984,  in
  which you request information concerning "The Interplanetary
  Phenomenon Unit of the Scientific and Technical Branch of
  Army counterintelligence Directorate, DA. "Your letter was
  received in this office on May 15, 1984 .

        As you note  in your letter, the  so-called Interplanetary
  Phenomenon Unit  ( IPU )  was disestablished  and,  as  far as we
  are aware, all records, if any, Were transferred to the Air
  Force in the late 1950's . The "unit was formed as an in-
  house project purely as an interest item for the Assistant
  Chief of Staff for Intelligence . It was never a "unit" in
  the military sense, nor was it ever formally organized or
  reportable, it had no investigative function, mission or
  authority, and may not  even have had any formal records at
  all, It is only through institutional memory that any
  recollection exists of this unit. We are  therefore Unable
  to  answer your questions as to the exact purpose of the
  unit,  exactly when  it was  disestablished, or who was in command
  this  last would not apply in any case, as no one was
  in command ".  We have no records  or documentation of any
  kind on this unit, "Also, it is Very unlikely that there
  was any relationship between xxxxxxxxxx and the IPU, but
  only xxxxxxxxxxxxx could answer that question.

         I regret that we are unable to be of more assistance in
 this matter.

                                   Sincerely,

                                   Lance R. Cornine
                                   Lieutenant Colonel, General Staff
                                   Director of Counterintelligence
