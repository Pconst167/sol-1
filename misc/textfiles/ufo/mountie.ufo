               The file was run through the Microsoft Word 5.0 spell
               checker following conversion so most errors in character
               recognition should be ok. Now that I finally have OCR
               software that works there should be lots of files on the
               way so stay tuned.

               Do you have important material that needs to be shared?
               Contact us here at UFONET I and perhaps we can convert
               your document to a text file for you using our OCR
               software and hardware. You can contact either myself
               Harvey Stewart or the Sysop of this board Tom Mickus
               for details.

         Mountie UFO witness silenced

     From the Vancouver Sun of April
     26, 1976, we learn (in a report datelined
     "Terrace") some details of an
     event which is said to have occurred
     on April 21, 1976,- ""Bill Toffan, the
     21 year old Terrace RCMP constable
     who said he had a near crash last
     Wednesday after sighting an unidentified
     flying object while on highway
     patrol, has been ordered by his superiors
     not to comment on the incident.

        "Toffan says he would be putting
     his job on the line if he said anything
     further, but his superior says there is
     nothing out of the ordinary in the
     order.

        "RCMP subdivision head, Edward
     Trefry, denied there is any police
     cover-up of the incident.

        "We're not trying to hide anything
     It's simply policy which has been
     laid down throughout this subdivision
     that all press releases are
     made by senior personnel at each
     detachment instead of by the individual
     officer. Inspector Trefry said in an
     interview from Prince Rupert.

         "This is to avoid confusion and
     there are no exceptions to the rule".
     he said.

        "According to a press release made
     last week by  Staff-Sgt.  Murray
     Morrison, commanding officer of the
     Terrace detachment, Toffan saw  a
     vehicle with its lights flashing ahead of
     him on Highway 16 about 60 miles
     east of Prince Rupert.

        "However, when he drew closer, he
     discovered it was not on the road, but
     was flying. As Toffan drew abreast of
     the air-borne object there was a blinding
     flash. He was so startled he nearly
     lost control of his car. He stopped and
     investigated the area on foot but found
     nothing.

        "Immediately after the sighting,
     Toffan dropped out of sight - on four
     days, prearranged leave, according to
     Morrison.

        "Morrison told a reporter Friday
     that police further checked the area in
     daylight but found nothing to assist
     them in identifying what Toffan saw.

         "As far as We're concerned, the
     matter is now closed,, Morrison said
     then.

       "He was unavailable for comment
     today.

        "The earlier theory of a Light aircraft
     in trouble has been discounted
     by the rescue co-ordination center in
     Victoria".
