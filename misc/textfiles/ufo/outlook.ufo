	THE OUTLOOK
       -------------


	By now it is certain that all of the people, everywhere, who
 take an interest in or are aware of the "UFO Problem", will have heard
 and read a greatdeal about such things as the "Majestic 12" documents;
 the astounding claims of John Lear and of Bill Cooper; the shattering
 books "Matrix" and "An Alien Harvest"; the talk and the rumours of
 underground alien bases on Earth at such places as Dulce and Groom
 Lake; the talk of an alleged governmental deal with Aliens that went
 disastrously wrong; of human abductions, of cattle mutilations, and
 alas - of other things much worse than that.

	Apart from a few brief references in recent issues, we at FSR
 have so far said little about these potentially grave new aspects of
 the UFO Problem.  There are others who have already said far more than
 we have.  We ourselves propose to say little more for the moment.

	But this does not mean that we are in any sense unaware of the
 prevailing situation.  We have all the key books referred to - and more,
 and in fact the amount of accumulated material which we now have on all
 these matters is enormous and we doubt whether any other civilian
 investigators in Britain have anywhere near as much as we do.  Indeed -
 and this may surprise some - we started receiving this type of material,
 from Canadian as well as U.S. sources, as far back as 1980.  And although
 we still do not know how much of this disturbing material is true, it is
 notable that the main themes running through it for nearly a whole
 decade now have been remarkably consistent.

	A reader asked us recently why we have not said much more than we
 have on all these developments.  And the reply we gave him was simply
 that _we_do_not_yet_know_how_much_of_it_all_is_true_and_how_much_false_.
 So we prefer to wait a while and see.

	Rumour has it that Mr. John Lear has said: "It's all over bar the
 screaming".  He may or may not have said this.  We at FSR don't know
 whether he said it.  But, if the position really is as indicated in the
 voluminous material now in our hands, then we have to agree that it may
 indeed be "all over bar the screaming".

	But we think we have some responsibilities, and one of those
 responsibilities is not to contribute to "rocking the boat" needlessly.

	Unlike most others in this field, we do not seek financial gain,
 and we think that poor old _Homo_Sapiens_ (self-dubbed_ has already got
 more than enough to worry about.  So we think we will let others "spill
 it all now", if they want to.  If it turns out to be untrue or badly
 exaggerated, an awful lot of alarm and despondency will have been
 generated unnecessarily.  And, if the picture is indeed as sombre as
 presented, then we feel sure that _Homo_Sap._ will find out quickly
 enough.  We don't aspire to be the first bearers of all the bad news.

 	As a last thought however, we will tell you this: some of the
 information brought to us privately out of China in April of this year -
 information emanating from Chinese Government levels - was as terrifying
 as anything that we have ever heard.  So it may well be, after all, that
 John Lear and Bill Cooper and Paul Bennewitz, along with not a few others,
 are telling the truth.

	But, we repeat, we do not intend to be the first to write or speak
 too much about it all

 now_being_played_out_here._
