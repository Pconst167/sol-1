Dear Bill:

Re yours of May 18. Some data...

I checked telephone information in State College, PA -- home of Penn
State after checking the library re Walker. There was no listing so
I called the University. I eventually was given a location in South
Carolina.. Hilton Head. I got his number there and called. He was out.
I left my name and said I would call back the next night when
according to his wife he would be in. I did so. He was cagey and 
careful. There was no admission whatsoever of any involvement with
UFOs at all.

He did say that the subject had of course been discussed by everybody
back then. He did admit to having read the Roswell Incident and threw
in some cracks. There is absolutely nothing that can be used in a
court of law. He certainly will not respond to pressure. My reaction
to how he answered the various questions was that he knew a great
deal. He surely wasn't saying that. I think you are probably right
about him... his background is certainly impressive and of course Ike
had a farm in Gettysburg PA and there were other connections. I don't
have a mailing address for him but he does apparently go in to the
university still as an ex president.

I would certainly agree that HAK was in all the right places at the
right times doing the right things for him to have been involved and
perhaps still involved in the UFO coverup. I have no idea how to 
prove that at this time.

I have no idea why you want to have the government turn flying saucers
over to the scientific community. The security implications of the
technology of the saucers are enormous. I do not want technical
information made public. Why do you? I want the world to know that
indeed our planet is being visited by ETI and that the government
knows a great deal. I certainly don't want all the information made
public. After all what about all the data obtained by other
governments especially the Soviet Union? Do you expect them to
make their information available? I would expect them to grab ours
and put it together with theirs...

A direct frontal approach often calls the troops out of the closet.
I certainly appreciate that you have been spending a lot of effort
and turning up leads worthy of further attention. But again I must
express my strong concern about not going past the data... as was
the case with Sarbacher. These guys can't be brow beaten.
Impressions and feelings are useful in pursuit of truth but not in
establishing it in a courtroom. I appreciate4 the info about Wang,
but again his wife's statements to you don't prove anything... about
him or HAK. Incidentally I long ago suggested that HAK knew all
about UFOs and that was the reason for the embargo raising oil
prices because once the truth was out oil would be of much less
value... he was closely tied to the Rockefeller interests as you
know... But I hadn't checked his early background until you
suggested it.... It was probably expected that some of the truth
would be released during Nixon's second term....

Hastily,
               Stan
