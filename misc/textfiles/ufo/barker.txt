BARKER.TXT  - Facts surrounding the Steinman-Barker letter
^^^^^^^^^
            - By Grant Cameron

======================================================================

 Note:  The Barker re-write can be found on page 334 of Steinman's
        book, "UFO Crash at Aztec".  The original is reproduced on
        pages 326-328.

	"The truth is only arrived at by the painstaking process
	 of eliminating the untrue."

				Sherlock Holmes as quoted by Bill Moore



	In a Sept. 14,1989 letter to myself and T. Scott Crain,
 Williams L. Moore sent us a copy of the April 84,Issue #21 Steinman-
 Gray Barker letter.  We were asked to consider Steinman's credibility
 in light of this letter.  Bill Moore stated, "It was precisely over
 this issue that I broke off relations with Steinman five years ago."

	Bill Steinman, it appears, has taken much criticism over this
 letter from many circles.  In an August 6, 1985 letter from Jerome
 Clark to Bill Steinman, Clark stated he was glad that the Sarbacher
 letter had gotten wide distribution, "otherwise, we'd have nothing
 but your lurid fantasies about it (such as your science-fictional
 version described in GRAY BARKER'S NEWSLETTER while back.)"

	In a May 25,84 letter from Stanton Friedman to William Steinman,
 Friedman also hints at this letter.  "I must express my strong concern
 about not going past the data... as was the case with Sarbacher."

	I was most concerned  ,  related to the Steinman-Barker letter,
 about why Steinman would say that Sarbacher had attended the WPAFB
 meeting when Steinman knew quite clearly that he had not.  Fortunately,
 before Steinman had the chance to write me and point out my lack of
 checking and verifying, I discovered the answer for myself.  Had others
 checked, they too, would have discovered the fact that Gray Barker made
 significant and damaging changes to the letter.


 Here are the FACTS


	The Steinman-Barker letter refered to my all researchers is a
 rewritten distorted extrapolation of the origional Dec 24, 1983 letter.
 Steinman in his book UFO CRASH AT AZTEC refers to it as "a somewhat
 distorted version." (P.334)  I have enclosed the original which
 Steinman provided in his book for comparison.

	Why did Steinman state Sarbacher had attended the WPAFB meeting
 when he hadn't?  Steinman didn't.  Barker added the words (which he
 attended.)  A quick check of the enclosed original will show that
 these words were not in the original.

	Steinman has frequently extrapolated on the known data to present
 his impression of what that data means.  In the Dec.24,83 letter to
 Barker he does so and clearly states this.  "My speculations are,"
 writes Steinman, "that the purposes of those meetings were..."

	Barker in his rewriting of this sentence, however, leaves out the
 "my speculations are"  thus making it appears that Steinman is claiming
 that this information related to the purposes of the WP meetings was
 given him by Sarbacher.  Steinman is saying no such thing.

	As to the outcome of the meetings, Steinman states "I believe that
 the outcome of the meetings..."  Barker once again leaves out the "I
 believe" thus creating the impression that Steinman is claiming this
 information came from Sarbacher.  Once again this is not true.

	As to the diversionary measures Steinman clearly states "I believe
 the following diversionary measure..."  Barker again leaves out the "
 I believe" in his retelling to make it appear Sarbacher related this
 information.

	Barker even goes as far as to extend the underlining under
 "did recover" to "did recover three flying saucers."  He also capitolized
 all the words which is not done in the original.

	It appears therefore that Barker is the one that is guilty of
 lurid fantacies and science fiction versions.  Steinman Dec.24,83 letter
 to Barker was based upon the Sarbacher letter which he received, and
 on the Smith-Sarbacher notes which he assumed had not yet been released.
 A re-reading will I think show that Steinman letter was very accurate
 based on what Sarbacher material he had.
