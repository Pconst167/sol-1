Dear Sir:

     This is a response to your Jan 9, 1989 letter.
     I am the Richard C. Doty mentioned by Barry Greenwood of
Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS). I did retire from Government
Service last year. I spent eight years with the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations at Kirtland AFB, NM. I was also assigned
duty in West Germany. My last two years of service was in the Services
career field, but not as a cook. I never lost my top secret security
clearance. In fact my current position requires the clearance. I did
do something wrong. While assigned to the AFOSI District 70
Headquarters, Weisbaden, West Germany, I performed duties as a
counterespionage specialist. In 1986, I was involved in a sensitive
operation where I attempted to perform certain duties which would
enable our team to trap possible foreign agents working against the
interests of the United States. My supervisors, however, seen my
actions as being unauthorized. Therefore, I was asked to leave AFOSI,
which I did voluntarily. I accepted a position at Kirtland AFB, in 
Albuquerque, NM, where my son was residing with my former spouse.
     While assigned to duties with AFOSI at Kirtland AFB, NM, I did
investigate a number of UFO sightings. However, my normal duties were
that of an counterintelligence investigator. I did not devote my
entire time to the conduct of UFO investigations.
     At present, my job deals with investigations and I do work for a
Government agency. However, I do not have anything to do with UFO
research or investigations.
     My own personal beliefs regarding the subject of UFO is this.
I think Earth is not the only planet in the Universe that supports
intelligent life. Whether Earth has been visited in the past by
visitors from other planets I simply don't have enough information
to make a personal decision. If I should base my decision on 
information that I had access to during my Government Service, I would
have to say, yes, Earth has been visited. However, I am not 100
percent certain that the information I had access to was entirely
accurate.
     My father was never an investigator for Blue Book. That was an
uncle. He will be prominently mentioned in a book due out this fall.
This book will also discuss a number of inaccurate statements made by
CAUS regarding me, the Kirtland and Ellsworth AFBs incidents. This
book will name people who CAUS says do not exist.
     The last thing I would like to mention is the story that I am the
Falcon mentioned in the Television program last October. I have been
exonerated by Government Investigative Agencies regarding that matter.
I am not that person.
     I presently no longer reside in New Mexico, but I do have a
forwarding service in New Mexico. If you should respond to this letter
please allow approximately one month for my reply.
     This matter involving CAUS will come to an end soon after legal
action has been taken.

                                             P.O. Box 973
                                             Grants, NM 87020
