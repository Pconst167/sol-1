                            CAN MOON ILLUSIONS MOVE?

                                By Felix A. Bach


          What could be more galling than spotting still further changes in
     the monstrous moon objects I've been viewing and telling folks about
     lately, especially after all the effort our vaunted "space experts"
     keep expending to convince us that _nothing_ is up there?

          Despite their sneering claims that moon objects can only be
     "illusions," new ones continue to make surprise appearances, put on
     spectacular displays of activity, and then just blithely disappear!  A
     good example was the original "See Through Bags" object at Crater
     Rost, a sketch of which was published in FATE (July 1986).  In all the
     sightings prior to that sketch, it showed seven puffy, gossamer bags
     draped from the hooked end of a very shiny, jet-black (a significant
     feature of many major objects) mast about 20 _miles tall!_  Sometime
     between mid-August and September of 1986, though, the mast was rotated
     halfway around, and the "bags" were strung out on a line stretching
     some 35 miles over to Crater Schiller, reminiscent of laundry hanging
     on a clothesline.

          After a dozen or so sightings of this object I naturally assumed
     it was a permanent fixture that would stay there forever, just
     changing appearance every now and then to do whatever job it does.  I
     described and sketched the new changes in a later article for the July
     1987 issue of _The Gate._  Even before that article reached its
     readers, astounding changes had already taken place.  Sometime before
     May 1987, the mast had acquired a new crossbar near its hooked end.
     There was also a new fabric-like skirt running down most of the shaft
     to the surface (making that part look like a very tall "tepee").

          _WEATHER PROTECTION?_

          A new ribbon of shiny material several miles wide was also draped
     from the crossbar swooping down to the surface like a waterfall.
     Where it landed, it transformed into a long, tubelike form a mile or
     so wide, which subsequently ran across the same 35 miles of surface
     over to Crater Schiller that was covered by its former aerial route.
     (The whole scene was reminiscent of the familiar plastic sheets we see
     draped around our earthly construction sites nowadays for weather
     protection.)  There is very little chance of error about this since I
     studied the condition at length and under optimal conditions for three
     nights in a row, beginning the 10th night after the Full Moon (May 8,
     9, and 10) at high resolution powers up to 500x, (which according to
     my "Celestron" manufacturer allows viewing of lunar details as small
     across as a football stadium.)

          Upon looking just one month later I was very surprised to find
     that everything described here was _gone._  Apparently, whatever
     purpose this contraption served  was completed and it was quickly
     dismantled and removed (or maybe just retracted?).

          _THE BEADED ARCH_

          Another of my original sightings published in that same 1986
     sketch in FATE was the "Spectacular Beaded Arch," parts of which were
     first seen with my old 60mm starter telescope as early as 1983.  As
     shown here again in the sketch accompanying this article, it runs
     south roughly 175 miles from near Mt. Hadley toward Mt. Bradley.

          Regardless that viewing conditions were good back then it didn't
     matter much because I was still to naive at the time to grasp the
     enormity of what I was viewing, anyway (and would not have believed it
     possible).

          Then I got a view of more aspects of this arch the next summer
     while looking through an 8-inch Meade (S/C) telescope of a neighbor on
     the eighth night.  He was set for 600x.  There were excellent viewing
     conditions at the time, which yielded better than twice the
     magnification at better clarity than I had ever experienced before.

          Even so, I was still unable to connect the various parts seen
     into a recognizable whole object yet.  I did note that a mysterious
     bright bead seemed to be sitting atop Mr. Hadley though, unexplainably
     moved from its prior-year location seen somewhere to the east.

          _I SEE IT ALL_

          It all came together when the arch became gloriously visible once
     again in 1985 on the seventh night (November 19th), while I was
     viewing with my own new SPC 8-inch telescope.  Because of a different
     _libration_ (viewing angle), I was able to see the whole arch from end
     to end at a single whack!  When I saw that jet black shaft vaulting
     about 50 miles above the surface with five bright "beads" spaced along
     its length (all verified by great shadows, incidentally), I finally
     realized that I was looking at a stupendous object.  I had no idea
     that still more arches were concealed in the terminator darkness
     heading southwest, so I sketched as much as I had seen up to that time
     for the first publication.

          When the moon got in another favorable libration again in July
     1986, a second beaded arch became visible -- a virtual twin sister of
     the earlier one, running another 175 miles southward from near Mr.
     Bradley almost to Crater Eratosthenes.

          As though this second arch wasn't mind-boggling enough, still a
     third little brother arch, about 50 miles long, became visible
     snuggled under the twin sister just two months later (in September
     1986).  At that time, all three arches were visible together similar
     to the condition as shown in the sketch on the next page.

          _U.S. AND SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS?_

          Please note the relative position of the Apollo 15 landing site
     shown at the announced coordinates of 24N, 2E.  If you can see the
     fortuitous location as roughly central between the ends of the two
     larger arches, then you may suspect that some other very knowledgeable
     people know a whole lot about these arches, too.
          Incidentally, the Soviets also showed great interest in them
     earlier, when their Luna 2 space probe landed just 80 miles away at
     31N, 1E, (they say) a bit off the mark but still a very respectable
     position for reconnaissance.

          _WHERE DID THEY GO?_

          Once again, all arches shown in the sketch were gone by the time
     I viewed the area just one month later (in October 1986).  Untimely
     bad weather has hindered follow-up viewing ever since, so I can't say
     if they have been visible lately or not.  You can see parts of them
     pictured in a legitimate 1956 Mt. Wilson photo on plate 7-1 in
     Dinsmore Alter's _Pictorial Guide to the Moon_, (3rd Revised Edition
     1973), as well as on page 9 of _The Questar Moon_ (published since
     1981).

          Since we have these various sightings, plus independent
     photographic evidence of their sporadic reappearances, viewers should
     keep watching for these arches because it is most likely they will be
     visible again as soon as conditions warrant.  Some special mention is
     deserved by the crane boom shown above Crater Eratosthenes.
     Unfortunately, it may show up only faintly at times, no doubt
     depending on where it was "parked" after its last use.

          When position, lighting, libration, and perigee (i.e. lunar
     nearness) are favorable, it is a joy to see.  Due to its 12 or so mile
     height, it gets lit several hours before the surface below, so it
     gleams with a metallic brilliance that makes it look like a tiny bar
     of light floating magically above that whole sea of darkness.  Several
     hours later, though, viewings will show its distinctive shadows
     running across the crater floor and curling around its western rim.

          The object shows up with sparkling clarity (with shadow) in at
     least a half dozen places in _The Questar Moon_, and a bit less clear
     but in more places in _Pictorial Guide to the Moon_.  Artists disguise
     it as a rock or rill in most of the "official" published photos (as
     well as those that appear in many textbooks and encyclopedia sets).

          _CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF_

          Several hundred known objects are now visible on the Moon, with
     surprising new ones still popping up on occasion.  That is not an
     exaggerated number, for on a good, clear night (especially around the
     5th to 9th), a hundred or more objects can be seen in one evening
     alone.  Many of these are nondescript "post" and "pole" type things
     that proliferate in certain areas though, and are not especially
     photogenic (or even sketchable).  It is not necessary to view them all
     to realize something is dreadfully wrong with the "official" lunar
     photos and explanations foisted off on us.

          Just _one good sighting_ should convince you that these things
     are not the illusions that our space gurus and their many cronies
     piously claim and urgently insist that we believe without question.

          Check these images out with your own eyes by viewing them on a
     systematic basis right in your own backyard.  You must use a minimum
     60mm telescope though, yielding a mid-range power of 140x or more.

          Dark sites on remote mountaintops are not needed for this
     activity (regardless of popular myths invented to discourage the
     public from wholesale viewing).  The Moon is so big and bright that
     even city lights can hardly hinder your effort.  Viewing is relatively
     inexpensive, great fun, and a constant source of wild and awesome
     excitement!

          _DISINFORMATION_

          After your first unmistakable sighting, you will know that a lot
     of very prominent people have conspired to disinform us.  That
     realization may disappoint you, make you angry about the concerted
     dishonesty involved, and cause a deep concern over this abuse of our
     trust, rights, and privileges.  On the bright side, you will be immune
     from further hero worship, skeptical about much of the cunning
     propaganda still piled on us, and saved from much of the futility
     forced into our lives.

          Best of all, knowing the truth dispels myths and bridges many of
     the gaps that were so painstakingly programmed into our thinking,
     allowing us to share the knowledge gained from firsthand viewing.
