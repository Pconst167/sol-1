Subject: The infamous photon belt
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 1995 02:59:33 GMT


All right, I'm sick of this.  Unlike everyone else I've seen post, I
*am* an astronomer; I am with the University of Chicago and do studies
of star formation using measurements made in the far-infrared (60-200
micro-meters) part of the spectrum.

The Pleiades is at a distance of 410 light-years.  Its motion with
respect to us can be broken into two components: along the line of
sight and transverse to the line of sight.  The former is called
"radial velocity", the latter "proper motion".  The radial velocity of
the Pleiades with respect to us is 4.5 miles/second in recession--that
is, the Sun and the Pleiades are moving *away* from each other.  The
proper motion of the Pleiades is 5.5 arcseconds/century, roughly
south-east as seen on the sky.  This is towards Orion and is consistent
with both ourselves and the Pleiades being in orbit around the center
of the galaxy.

The 8 star names devolve from antiquity, specifically from a the
Greeks; c.f the 3rd century BC poem by Aratus.

All of the Pleiadean stars share the same motion; they are thus not
orbiting Alcyone, but rather moving together as a group.  The Pleiades
is an "open cluster", which means that it is not gravitationally
bound.  Thus, over a timescale of a few million years, the cluster will
evaporate into individual stars all orbiting the galaxy.  The
second-to-last sentence in the above paragraph is simply wrong, and the
writer of that sentence (presumably the book's author, not Mr Nanomius)
is either ignorant or a liar.

(My sources for this information are the Bright Star Catalogue and
Burnham's Celestial Handbook.  Also, torriod is not a word; toroid,
torus, and toroidal are, but of these only toroidal is an adjective, as
is needed above.)

The names exist, although astronomers tend to refer to stars by their
BS (Bright Star) or HD (Henry Draper) catalog numbers instead, since so
few stars have names.

On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to reach space,
on the first (sub-orbital) Mercury mission.  Thus there weren't exactly
a lot of things in orbit then; it ought to be easy to use a book on the
history of space flight to pick out which satellite it is to which your
channelers refer, particularly since those early satellites couldn't
have been doing a lot of science.  If you truly care, Mr Nanomius, you
should be able to find out and enlighten us all.  Speaking as an
astronomer, however, I wouldn't trust any measurements made in 1961--I
would demand they be redone, at least!

>
Let's do the math:  As I have said, the distance to the Pleiades is 410
LY.  Therefore, the length of a circular orbit around them at our
distance is 2*pi*410 LY = 2581 LY, or 2.4x10^19 meters.  The claimed
orbital period is 24000-26000 years; take 25,000 years, which is
7.9x10^11 seconds.  Our orbital velocity is then 2.4x10^19 m /
7.9x10^11 s = 3.0x10^7 m/s.  The speed of light is 3.0x10^8 m/s, so our
orbital velocity is one-tenth the speed of light, or 0.1c.

Possible, according to relativity, but I assure you, Mr Nanomius, we
would notice.  We do not see this.  If you have questions, please
contact me privately.

A larger question is *why* would we be orbiting the Pleiades; to do so
would require a large mass centered there.  We can derive what that
mass is from the fact that the velocity with which an object orbits
(assuming a circular orbit) another is also given by the equation v^2 =
GM/R.  We can rewrite that as M = R*v^2/G.  So doing, we can deduce
that for the Sun to orbit the Pleides at a distance of 410 LY at a
velocity of 0.1c would require a central mass of
    M = 410LY * (3x10^7m/s)^2 / 6.668x10-11 m^3/kg*s^2
      = 3.88x10^18 m * 9x10^14 m^2/s^2 / 6.668x10-11 m^3/kg*s^2
      = 5.24x10^43 kg

The mass of the Sun is 2x10^30 kg, so this is 2.6x10^13 Suns.  The mass
of the galaxy, including dark matter (see below), is estimated to be
between 10^9 and 10^10 Suns, so in order for us to orbit the Pleiades,
there would have to be a mass of around 10000 galaxies there.  That
would definitely be something we'd notice--if only by the gravitational
lensing!

I should point out that these are not difficult calculations, Mr
Nanomius.  The fact that they give such ridiculous results is a major
blow to your theory.

As others have said, that is P.A.M. Dirac.

You needn't go into space; they happen all the time in first-year
physics and chemistry labs all around the world.  The cardinal sign is
a gamma ray--photon--which has 511 keV of energy.  Such photons have
been observed coming from space.

>
Well, the simplest source of an electron stream of which I can think is
the device upon which you're currently reading this, your monitor/CRT =
Cathode Ray Tube.  A Cathode Ray is a free electron.  You could of
course build a CRT using positrons, but since they have an annoying
tendency to explode whenever they're around matter, no one's yet been
able to do it.

This brings up a separate point, though.  Our universe has an extreme
matter/anti-matter imbalance; that is, there is very little anti-matter
out there.  We do not believe, for instance, that galaxies made of
anti-matter exist.  Explaining why that is the case is a problem for a
cosmologist!  Now, we see jets from a variety of sources--young stars,
active galactic nuclei, quasars--but all of those jets are consistent
with electrons & protons being accelerated by a magnetic field and
flung out in a stream.  So while a positron stream might exist, we
certainly haven't seen one.

I'm sorry to have to say this, but this is almost insulting.  Halley
discovered proper motion, Bessel made later observations, absolutely.
No *reputable* astronomer would ever contend that proper motion doesn't
exist.  So, is it recorded?  Of course.  What do we think?  We believe
it.  What does this have to do with Mr Nanomious's claims?  Not a whit.

Mr Nanomius also seems laboring under a false assumption of how work in
astronomy (at least) is done.  I can't tell you where Halley or Bessel
might have written any of this down; to find it, you would have to
consult the rare books section of a good library.  I've never read an
original text from the 18th or 19th centuries, it would be pointless.
When astronomical discoveries pass into the accepted body of thought,
they appear first in reviews and then in textbooks and catalogs.  In a
very real sense, I do not care what either Halley or Bessel measured
the proper motion of the Pleiades to be; it has been done many times
since, with ever better equipment, and I want to use the most certain
value!

I've never heard of this man.  That doesn't mean he is not an
astronomer, but it doesn't bode well, either.  And since the only
reference given is for a book in German, a language I only nominally
speak, neither can I offer any help on that front.  What I would like
to point out is that an *astronomical* discovery would have to have be
reported in a peer-reviewed journal, not in a book, to have credibility.

I would also like to say that quite frankly you, Mr Nanomius, are not
pulling your own weight in this matter.  If you want to have an honest
discussion of your unorthodox ideas, the burden is on you to do the
research, not us.  I can sympathize with posting something in which one
says "I tried to find X, but didn't get very far, any ideas?" but that
is not what you have done.  It is very clear that you have not bothered
to read even an introductory astronomy text, for had you done so you
would not have made the errors you did which struck me as just plain
stupid.  Perhaps the most grevious example is that you don't know what
"dark matter" is.

"Dark matter" is defined as matter we sense only through its
gravitational effects, rather than by emitted or reflected radiation.
I quote a later posting of yours:
>

Dark matter is not matter we cannot find, it is matter we cannot SEE.
The difference is crucial.  Mr Nanomius, if you want to know more about
dark matter, I would be happy to email you privately, or you could go
read a textbook; in the meantime, you should desist commenting upon a
subject about which you are ignorant.

This essentially says that I am required by someone else not to tell
the truth in this matter--a very handy way of discounting anything I
have to say: "it's all lies from the NSA."  This is a beautiful example
of the classic logical fallacy 'argumentum ad hominem', or 'arguing
against the man'.  Since you can't oppose my arguments, you attempt to
construct a straw man--"all astronomers are suppressed, and thus if
they claim not to be, they are liars paid by the NSA"--so you can use
it to discredit me.  Well, discredit all you wish, Mr Nanomius; I have
never had any association with the NSA--unless you count visiting their
museum!

Now, in direct contradiction to this claim about the Hubble Space
Telescope, it is a fact that all its images are in the public domain,
because it is a public venture.  Space Telescope Science Institute will
send you any images you want--and you can acquire them even more easily
through a little net-surfing.  The only restriction on data is that the
investigators who take the observations are entitled to sole access to
the data for a short while so that they get first crack at reducing it.

As far as some other kind of suppression occuring, I should point out
that many of the largest telescopes in the world are not government but
privately owned.  The University of Chicago, for instance, has two
1-meter telescopes at Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin and a 3.5-meter
one at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, to name just the ones at
least 1 meter in diameter.  Persons at the University of Chicago could
not be prevented from publishing whatever they wanted concerning images
from these telescopes.

For perhaps one final piece of evidence, I'd like to point out that
many astronomers I know went into this field in order to have as little
to do with the government as possible--not wanting to build bombs or
drive nuclear submarines--thus their tolerance for anything reeking of
censorship from the government is exceedingly low.

I don't believe this, and here's why:  my compass works just fine.  And
as far as I know, my dad's compass, which he got as a Boy Scout in the
40's, works fine as well.  Had there been a noticeable change over the
last few decades, don't you think that the manufacturers of magnetic
compasses, at least, would have noticed?  Wouldn't they have said
*something*?

I have never heard of Swimme.  However, Mr Nanomius, the quote does not
say what you think it does.  It isn't talking about, nor does it say
there was, an "increase in background radiation" over the last few
decades.  Rather, it refers to the fact that it has become possible,
due to advances in solid state physics and the creation of the space
program, to sense the photons which comprise the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation (CMBR).  The existence of these photons was
discovered by Penzias and Wilson in the early 60's--you shouldn't have
any trouble finding them, they won the Nobel Prize for it--and their
characteristics investigated in detail by the COBE (COsmic Background
Explorer) satellite, launched in 1989.  The reason this discovery is so
important is that CMBR photons are an essential prediction of the Big
Bang theory, and that because those photons are as old as anything
gets, they give us valuable information on the state of the very, very
early Universe.

The Sun does have an 11 year sunspot cycle, peaking again in ~1998, but
somehow I doubt that's what you mean.

The explanation is "it's extragalactic".  Whether or not such a
phenomenon could be related to the photon belt would depend on an
actual, physical, definition of the same; lacking such, this is a
meaningless question.

Accurate?  What does that mean?  It's the accepted explanation.  No new
evidence has been acquired to cast doubt upon it.

We only know of a few mechanisms of producing extremely high-energy
cosmic rays--a cosmic ray being defined as a high-energy charged
particle, i.e. the proton so described.  None of those mechanisms,
acting in the conditions of our galaxy, could give a cosmic ray that
much energy; here, the most energetic sources are supernovae, which
can't produce enough energy.  If the cosmic ray came from outside our
galaxy, however, it could come from, for instance, an active galactic
nucleus, which could give it much more energy.

Although this is a bit more esoteric a subject than dark matter, a good
astronomy textbook should be able to tell you more about cosmic rays.

>
There are two problems with this question: first, how are we to observe
gamma radiation "in the area"?  We can only see what *comes from* the
area; even if we had a probe which could nearly attain the speed of
light, we wouldn't get any results back for at least 820 years.
Second, "area supposedly occupied"?  While you have told us some things
about where it is, you have not told us enough to actually locate it
specifically.  So where would we look?

I can't speak to that, of course.

This debate has gone on far too long for what it has become, a forum in
which Mr Nanomius can demonstrate both his lack of knowledge on the
subject and his willingness to shout others down rather than learn.
You came to this newsgroup, Mr Nanomius, pretending to be interested in
what astronomers or at least astronomically-knowledgable people had to
say in reaction to the astronomical claims of these authors' theory.
The fact is, however, that a couple of hours work at the public
library, less work than you put into your WWW page and certainly less
work than I have put in responding to this drivel, could have
enormously enhanced both your argument and your apparant understanding
of it, let alone any replies.  It's not that you have put up some
claims that turn out not to work, Mr Nanomius, that is objectionable;
it is that you use all tools you can find--including your ignorance--to
denigrate anyone who tries to show you you're wrong.  Even, or perhaps
most certainly, when it's clear to anyone with actual knowledge--the
very people you claim to be trying to ask--that your questions are too
silly to consider seriously.

You don't know what dark matter is, Mr Nanomius, you don't know what
cosmic microwave background radiation is, you don't recognize classical
logical fallacies when you see them--or if you do, you purposely
traffic in them--and to be honest you seem most interested not in
learning but in just being sarcastic.  That, and making a fool out of
yourself.  Please tell us, Mr Nanomius, what are your credentials--8th
grade?  High school?  College?  It would help everyone greatly to know
at what level arguments need be pitched--if not assist in the
deaccreditation process.  For that matter, tell us, why should we
believe you are interested in anything but virtual masochism?  What
reasons can you give us for not believing that, in accordance with what
I've concluded from your postings to date, were we discussing the time
of day, you would tell me I was wrong even had I the only timepiece?
