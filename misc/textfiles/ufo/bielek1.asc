          Mufon Metroplex presents "The Philadelphia Experiment"
                               by Al Bielek
                       on Saturday, January 13, 1990
                             in Dallas, Texas

         The Philadelphia   Experiment  (U.S.  Government  designation
         "Project Rainbow") had its  origin  in  a  feasibility  study
         started in  the  early  1930's at the University  of  Chicago
         (1931) and  later  moved to Princeton's Institute of Advanced
         Studies.  Involved  in the  Program  at  various  times  were
         renowned scientists that included Dr.  Albert  Einstein,  Dr.
         John von Neumann, Dr. Nikola Tesla, and others.

         Originally a  theoretical  study  in  methods  to  produce an
         "invisibility screen", the  first  fully  successful  test in
         1940 converted the program to a military project  :  "Project
         Rainbow".

         As a  military  (Navy)  program,  a  volunteer crew had to be
         trained and  a  ship  selected   -  the  Eldridge  (DE  173).
         Equipment had  to  be  ordered,  built,  and   installed  for
         seaborne tests.    Sea   trials  were  conducted  outside  of
         Philadelphia, in the Delaware Bay area.

         First tests  were  in  July,   1943  with  serious  personnel
         problems resulting.  The final test - 12 August 1943 - was an
         utter disaster to ship and crew : the ship survived after its
         return to  normal  time  and  location  in  the  Philadelphia
         harbor.

         The U.S. Navy continues to deny to this day that this project
         ever took  place  : or that it was coupled through hyperspace
         to another project in the future (1983).

         The expectations  for the  project  and  the  nature  of  the
         problems with  the crew will be developed and  discussed,  as
         well as  why  the "human equation" failed.  A review of prior
         publications attempting to expose  this  project will also be
         discussed.

         The lecturer, Alfred D. Bielek, was born in  August  1916  as
         Edward A.  Cameron,  son  of  Alexander  D.  Cameron, Sr.  He
         attended several Universities,  graduating  with  a  Ph D. in
         Physics (1939).   Enlisting  in  the  Navy  along   with  his
         brother, they  eventually  became  directly  involved  in the
         "Philadelphia Experiment".   The  story  of  how  he - Edward
         Cameron - was eventually removed form the project and became
         Alfred D.   Bielek   is   a   bizarre  story  of   government
         brainwashing and  manipulation,  and destruction of a career.
         The story of his brother is  still  more  bizarre  as well as
         tragic.

         Mr. Bielek  is  today  a retired electronics engineer with 30
         years of a consulting career behind him.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
     The following is a Vangard Sciences commentary by Jerry W. Decker
      and is  based  on personal studies  in  a  variety  of  subjects
                 including the "Philadelphia Experminent"
                       and attendance of the lecture
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mr. Bielek is a most engaging speaker.  He presents  a  wide range
    of popular references during his talks and weaves quite a web.

    However, the information  available  prior to the 1983 movie, "The
    Philadelphia Experiment" does not  concern  the  prospect  of time
    transport.

    The stated focus of the "Philadelphia Experiment"  project  was to
    "achieve radar invisibility".    Mr.   Bielek   states   that  his
    "memories began coming back AFTER seeing the movie in 1988."

    I got the  impression that he incorporates  new  topics  into  his
    storyline as fast  as  he  hears them, claiming that  his  "memory
    suddenly came back on that."

    Another major flaw  was  the  statement  that  Nikola Tesla was in
    association with and in charge of  the  project.   This  is highly
    incredible since the experiment occurred in July,  43'  and  Tesla
    died on January 7, 1943 in New York City.

    Yet another reference  which  is  difficult  to  believe  is  that
    Gustave LeBon was a consultant and  worked with Tesla and Einstein
    on the project.

    Bielek says that   Thorn   EMI,   producer  of  the   film,   "The
    Philadelphia Experiment" was  banned  from showing it in September
    1983.  He later says it was given a limited showing in the USA.

    Thorn Instruments, an old English manufacturer of labware from the
    early 1800's bought into EMI and  had in their archives a story of
    a disappearing ship  with  a picture of the "time  traveller"  who
    brought it to them.

    In the picture were the Wilson brothers of Thorn, Aleister Crowley
    (infamous occultist) and a 4th person who was Preston Nickles.

    This "traveller" said  to  be Peter Nickles is a past president of
    the USPA (United   States  Psychotronic   Association)   and   was
    supposedly in the picture taken in 1890.  Supposedly  Mr.  Nickles
    was shown the   picture   by  a  Thorn/EMI  representative  (Chief
    Archivist).  It showed him about 10 years older than now, 1989.

    They would not let Nickles copy the  picture.  Bielek says Crowley
    said that Nickles was a man out of the future and  gave  them  the
    story of the disappearing ship.

    Alan Batchelor? is said to be another survivor of the experiment.



                                  Page 2





    Project Rainbow was  said  to be the original name of the project,
    later changed to Project Phoenix.   It  took  four  hours  for the
    disappearance from Philadelphia to return.

    Bielek also said  EBE-1 (extra-terrestrial biological  entity  #1)
    gave the secret  of  the  transistor  to  the government, (no time
    frame).  (Of course,  we all know  the  germanium  transistor  was
    invented by Thomas Henry Moray and stolen by Bell Labs)

    Bielek says his  brother time travelled to 1983,  lost  his  "time
    lock", aged about 1 year per hour and died shortly thereafter.  He
    then said his  brother  was  later  reborn.   (I  don't pretend to
    understand this.)

    Supposedly every 20 years on the  12th  of  August,  the  magnetic
    energy peaks, i.e.   1943-1963-1983  to  allow  a   synchronicity.
    Linking and coupling  to  the  surge  would  cause a shift, (again
    confusing).

    Dr. Von Neumann (of computer fame)  was supposedly involved in the
    "Philadelphia Experiment" with Tesla, Einstein and  LeBon.  Bielek
    says he is recorded to have died in 1953 or 1957.

    In Phoenix, 1986,  Bielek's  memories  recalled  a site in Montauk
    which might be where Von Neumann  currently  resides in obscurity.
    In January 1988,   Bielek's   memories   of   the    "Philadelphia
    Experiment" were recalled.

    Another major discrepancy,  records  indicate  the original manned
    experiment occurred on October  28,  1943,  NOT  the  12th August,
    1943.

    Despite the irregularities,  there were some interesting  comments
    made in regard to time.

    The two most  outstanding  things about the public lecture was the
    showing of a  slide  purported   to  be  a  "Zero  Time  Reference
    Generator" which looks  strangely  similar to an  old  Army  field
    kitchen refrigeration unit.   No  technical  details were given or
    offered.

    This device was purported to be  the  oscillator  which  drove the
    coils of the experiment.  Mr. Bielek claimed that  the  unit shown
    was used to synchronize two separate signals (one for each coil).

    The literature of  the  "Philadelphia  Experiment" is replete with
    descriptions of the technology.  Further findings by our group
    and associates indicate a more "coherent" approach.

    Basically, a coil was wound on each half of the ship and driven by
    separate oscillators, synced with  an  adjustable  phase  angle to
    create a "Scalar-type wave".  This distorted the field matrices of
    matter encompassed within the field for "unusual effects".

    Keely was more   than  familiar  with  this  field   of   compound
    vibrations and their applications, HELL, HE PRECEDED ALL OTHERS.




                                  Page 3





    The other interesting comment was about a Professor of Mathematics
    at the University  of  Wisconsin  in  the  30's.  His name - Henry
    Levenson.  He specialized in time  studies  and  developed  a time
    variant equation.

    Mr. Levenson co-authored 2 books and wrote 1.  None of these books
    are available (of  course)  but  Bielek indicates  they  might  be
    available in restricted or private libraries such as Princeton.

    The time comments  centered around a concept involving a TIME LOCK
    which was "encoded" at the time of  creation of all matter, living
    or otherwise.  Thus,  all  matter created on the  Earth,  must  be
    "clocked" to the  Earth time lock.  The Earth must be "clocked" to
    the Solar time lock and that to the Galaxial.

    If your time lock became "distorted"  by high intensity fields, it
    would create a variety of problems due to the instability  of  the
    recovery process, assuming that recovery could be possible.

    Bielek claimed that  the original system was powered with a 500 KW
    generator, later increased to 2 MegaWatt.   Another experiment was
    supposed to have been done with 3 field coils, all  synced  to the
    same clocking system.

    The 3 field design created major arcing and caused a return to the
    2 field design.   Bielek  also  claims  that there were 3000 tubes
    used in the system.

    If you get the chance to hear Mr.  Bielek,  I  do  recommend it if
    only for entertainment.  However, if you want useable  data, stick
    to books periodicals and your own research.

    The time theories  espoused  by Bielek seem particularly worthy of
    study.  Much of the "Scalar" craze  indicates  a  technology which
    could duplicate or surpass the original "Philadelphia Experiment".

    Just for grins, I will state my own conclusion and  theory  on the
    subject.  I base  it  on  UFO phenomena, the work of Dr. Harold S.
    Burr, Dr. Walter Russell, W. J. Hooper and personal observations.

    If the original purpose was "invisibility"  as  stated  in various
    articles and commentaries, then why did a SHIP wind up in a HARBOR
    FILLED WITH WATER  and  NOT in the middle of a city  street  or  a
    wheat field in Kansas.

    Seems that something  is amiss as other accounts of the experiment
    state it was not carried out once  but  several times.  Each time,
    the ship "teleported" to a watery target.  What  are  the  chances
    that EVERY TIME the ship would "land" in water??

    As I understand  it,  partially  based on this quote from our file
    PHILAD1.ZIP:

        The U.S. Navy,  for one, seemed obsessed with the idea  of
        the  perfect  camouflage  -  the   ultimate  secret  weapon  -
        INVISIBILITY.  If  only one of their warships  could  be  made
        invisible,  think   of   the   havoc it could cause the enemy.
        Havoc  that could conceivably  bring   the  bitter   and long-
        enduring war to an end.

                                  Page 4





        On October  28,   1943,   an  experiment  was conducted at the
        Philadelphia Navy Yard.  This   event,  appropriately  enough,
        became  known as  "The Philadelphia Experiment".

        A Navy  escort  destroyer named the DE 173 (better  known   as
        the  U.S.S.   Eldridge),  with hundreds  of tons of electronic
        equipment aboard,  lay  in  its  dock.   Scientists  on  shore
        started the  experiment which involved Dr.  Albert  Einstein's
        "Unified Field  Theory",  a completed version appearing in the
        period  1925-27.   "Withdrawn"   as  incomplete,  the  revised
        theory returned  in  1940.  The result of the  experiment  was
        brain-rattling!

        The ship  faded   rapidly   from   sight  in  a  foggy,  green
        mist  -   and  COMPLETELY VANISHED!   Speechless     amazement
        struck   the wide-eyed scientists ashore.

        Then, after  a   few  minutes  (another  account   makes  that
        "seconds"),  the  ship  reappeared  where   it   had  formerly
        been, to its Philadelphia dock,  and  regained its visibility!
        But that   was   not  all.   Something  equally  stunning  was
        discovered to have happened during its vanishment.

    --> During that period of a few minutes (or seconds) the ship  had
    --> shown up  at  its other  Norfolk  Navy  Yard dock in Virginia!
    --> So, not only had it successfully  become invisible, but it had
    --> also been TELEPORTED!

    Notice the arrows and how the ship went to its OTHER  DOCK  but in
    Virginia, not the one in Philadelphia.

    Since we live  in  a serial time which clocks our every action and
    records it on the surrounding space continuum.  Our presence at
    in any space  at  a  given  timeframe   is   captured   by   local
    space/matter conditions so that the moving of the  earth  and  our
    solar system in  its  orbit would not leave us in space were we to
    teleport.

    So we have slices of wherever we have been since our creation.  We
    should be able to step back into  any  given  slice,  not in time,
    only in space.

    Another condition of this concept is that the PRESENT represents a
    suction which maintains  matter  as a balloon in the  "holographic
    image" of a  mass in a single time frame and in a specific spatial
    location.  Remember that this is in the PRESENT ONLY.

    Since the Eldridge had a history  of having been at its OTHER DOCK
    SOMETIME IN THE PAST and probably on several occasions, then if we
    could distort the tempic (time) field enough, we could momentarily
    teleport the ship NOT THROUGH TIME BUT THROUGH SPACE to a place IT
    HAD BEEN BEFORE.

    Now, if during   that  act  and  BEFORE  COMPLETE   TRANSFER   WAS
    ACCOMPLISHED, someone cut  the power, the portions of matter which
    had teleported would be "sucked" back like a vacuum to the source,
    i.e. the original spatial location of the PRESENT.



                                  Page 5





    Think of it   as   two  balloons.   A  full  one  in  Philadelphia
    represents the Eldridge.   At  the  port  in  Virginia,  an  empty
    balloon represents the holographic image (with no matter) and of
    a SPATIAL image sometime in the past.

    (Of course, for  each  timeframe past, an empty holographic  image
    balloon lies there  recording  the  passage  through  time of each
    object, just like a frame of a comic strip)

    If we slowly squeeze the full balloon  (representing  the Eldridge
    at the Philadelphia port in the original or PRESENT  location),  a
    connecting tube to   the  Virginia  port  allows  the  passage  of
    "matter" into the empty Eldridge.

    We get to a point where the source  is 1/4 empty and the target is
    3/4 full.

    IF at this point, someone RELEASES THE PRESSURE, what happens?

    The "teleported matter" will surge back into the  ORIGINAL SPATIAL
    location which exerts a vacuum to keep its balloon full.

    Of course, once  the  transfer is complete, the suction then takes
    place from the target spatial location.

    Since the pressure (high intensity  pulsing  magnetic  waves)  was
    released before the  transfer  was complete, the resulting  surges
    created massive distortions in all mass encompassed by the field.

    Living organisms record    field   effects   in   their   tissues.
    Therefore, all tissure formations  which  took  place  during  the
    surge, recorded the   surges   to   "haunt"  the  victims.    This
    apparently distorts the  Bio-plasmic  field  also  to  cause major
    physical problems.

    This is probably damnably confusing,  but I can't do pictures with
    this word processor, so words must suffice.
