                        Two interesting stories about Keely
                    from personal anecdotes told by Dale Pond,
                          Dan Davidson and Victor Hansen

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                        >>>  A Run on the Stock Market  <<<

       Keely was alleged  to  have  invented  a mineral disintegrator which
       could be tuned to a given substance  to  reduce it to dust.  In this
       particular account, the device was tuned to Quartz.

       Sometime during the   1880's,  Keely  was  experimenting   with   an
       instrument originally intended to be used to overcome gravity.  When
       a block of  quartz  was  used  as  a  weight, the intense vibrations
       generated by the device partially disintegrated the quartz block.

       This came as a surprise to Keely but he analyzed the effect and came
       up with a device specifically designed to disintegrate quartz.

       As we understand   it,   the   Quartz   Disintegrator   device   was
       approximately the size  of  a Brownie camera with a  protruding  rod
       which in turn  supported  a vibrating plate.  In use, the device was
       excited, which transferred the vibration  through the rod to a plate
       which was made  to  vibrate over its entire surface.   Wherever  the
       plate was touched  to  a piece of quartz, disintegration would occur
       at that location, leaving only a fine powder.

       A group of twelve wealthy businessmen  from  New  York heard of this
       experiment and came up with a brilliant idea to make  money with the
       new technology.

       Since quartz contains threads of gold, if the disintegrator could be
       used for mining,  it  could  result in large quantities of gold from
       relatively worthless mines.  The disintegrator would only affect the
       quartz and leave the gold behind for harvesting.

       So, the businessmen went to Keely's  lab  in  Philadelphia and asked
       for a demonstration.  Keely placed a block of quartz   on  a  table,
       the disintegrator was  touched  to  the  surface  and within a short
       time, a pile of dust was all that remained.

       Needless to say, the businessmen were very excited about the process
       and asked if Keely could do this at a place of their choosing. Keely
       said yes.  The businessmen offered  to each pay Keely a check in the
       amount of $1000.00  if  the  experiment worked at a  site  of  their
       choice.

       Within the next  few weeks, a site had been selected.  This site was
       a relatively worthless mine which had a very low yield.  In other


                                      Page 1





       words, the cost of mining and processing the quartz was much greater
       than the amount of gold which could be extracted (by normal means).

       The site was  a  quartz vein in the side of a mountain.  Keely asked
       that the twelve  businessmen  synchronize   their   watches.     The
       disintegrator was excited and Keely applied the vibrating  plate  to
       the face of  the  quartz  vein.  Instantly a fine dust began falling
       wherever the plate was touched.

       Moving the disintegrator in an ever  widening circular motion, Keely
       created a hole  in  the quartz about four feet in diameter.   As  he
       proceeded to walk  into  the  vein, the businessmen marvelled at the
       exhibition of such a superior mining technology.

       After about 15 minutes, Keely came out of the hole which he had just
       bored into the now exposed vein.  When measured, it was roughly four
       feet wide and almost twenty feet deep into the side of the mountain.

       On entering the passage, the businessmen picked up the small threads
       of unaffected gold which had earlier  been  suspended in the bulk of
       the quartz and now lay on the floor.

       Keely received twelve checks, each in the amount of $1000.00 for his
       efforts.

       The twelve businessmen thanked him and immediately  returned  to New
       York.  On their  arrival,  they immediately began purchasing all the
       most worthless gold mining stock they could lay their hands on.

       Now, many smaller investors tend to  watch the bigger guys hoping to
       copy their actions and make a profit.  This is done  even  when they
       don't have the whole picture.

       In this case,  many small investors also began to buy worthless gold
       mining stocks.  After several months,  nothing else happened and the
       small investors began  to  worry.   After  about a year,  the  small
       investors had to  sell  their  purchases  for  pennies on the dollar
       since they were not in on the Keely  Disintegrator  secret and could
       not afford to wait like the more wealthy investors could.

       When Keely ran into trouble with the investors in  the  Keely  Motor
       Company, he was  ordered by a court to reveal all his secrets to the
       Company investors.  In a fit of rage,  Keely  destroyed  the  Quartz
       Disintegrator along with many other one of a kind devices  which  he
       had constructed over a period of many years.

       As a result  of  this,  Keely  was never again able to duplicate the
       Quartz Disintegrator although  he  stated  in  later  life  that  he
       understood it to a point that he could if he so desired.

                       >>>  The Harmony of the Spheres  <<<

       Keely had the honor of exhibiting his Musical Globe  at  the World's
       Fair in the  late  1880's.  The Musical Globe was a spherical device
       which had one side painted white and the other painted black.

       When properly tuned, it could be excited by the simple act of

                                      Page 2





       playing a harmonica.   This  would  cause  the  Globe to slowly spin
       under its own  power  which  was  derived  from  an  arrangement  of
       vibrating components within the sphere.

       John Jacob Astor  and  his  entourage  were  visiting   the  various
       exhibits and had  seen little of novelty or interest.  However, they
       did find Keely's exhibit intriguing.

       Keely immediately recognized who  Mr.  Astor  was (and the extent of
       his fortune) and spoke with him in private.  Keely  told  Mr.  Astor
       that the "good stuff" was in his laboratory and he would be only too
       happy to demonstrate  a  fascinating  experiment  if Mr. Astor could
       manage to visit the lab.

       Being bored with the rest of the  fair,  Mr.  Astor  decided to take
       Keely up on the offer and went to the lab.

       Now there is  a  picture  taken  in Keely's lab which  has  been  of
       interest since we   first  saw  it.   There  is  no  description  or
       explanation of what the device is  but  this  story  seems  to  have
       something relating to it, as you can clearly see when looking at the
       device in the photo.

       Shown is a  large  metal  sphere supported in a circular  ring.   An
       outer ring surrounds  the  inner  and  supports  a number of various
       sized smaller spheres.

       Keely asked that Mr. Astor stand  back  and  watch closely.  He then
       went to one of his compound devices and began making adjustments.

       When the syren or whatever type of excitation he used  was  engaged,
       the large sphere  began  to  slowly  spin  on its axis in the inside
       ring.

       Within minutes, the smaller spheres each began to spin on their axis
       at rates proportionate to their diameter.   In addition, the smaller
       spheres began to orbit the larger central sphere.   The smaller ones
       spun faster, the larger ones slower, and all seemed to be related to
       the large sphere spinning on its axis in the center ring.

       After a few  minutes  of this, the large sphere began to slowly rise
       into the air and with it, the smaller  spheres  also  rose,  all the
       while spinning on their own axis and orbiting the large sphere.

       There seemed to  be  some  sort of equator generated  by  the  large
       sphere which supported the smaller spheres.

       At a certain  spot, the large sphere stopped rising and continued to
       spin while the smaller spheres of varying size began to fan out.

       Each reached a specific orbit which appeared to be a DIRECT ANALOGUE
       to our SOLAR SYSTEM.

       Just picture this, Keely standing  there operating his machine, John
       Astor standing with  his  mouth  open, both of them   watching  this
       miniature version of the solar system floating about the room.

       Astor reached up  and grabbed hold of one of the smaller globes.  It
       held him off the floor and continued to orbit about the central

                                      Page 3




       sphere with no   diminution  of  speed  or  height,  Astor  laughing
       gleefully as he spun about the room.

       He eventually let go and walked over  to Keely to ask about how this
       miracle was done.  Keely said that he had indeed modelled  the solar
       system and that  each  sphere  was  harmonically related in size and
       frequency to the planets and sun of our system.

       When his instrument was properly  adjusted  and  excited,  a natural
       sympathetic response was  generated  in  each  of   the  spheres  to
       generate the same effect which makes the worlds move.

       Astor asked what  would  happen  if  one of the spheres were to lose
       control.  Keely assured him that the chance of this happening was as
       remote as if one of the planets in  our  system  were to drop out of
       orbit.

       However, Keely had anticipated such a problem and an  experiment had
       been done to  see  what  the effect might be.  An enharmonious chord
       was set in to the compound instrument  which  would cause the sphere
       representing the Earth to lose its "tether" to our central sun.

       When the chord  was  played,  the  Earth sphere slowly  moved  in  a
       straight line, creating  a  hole  through  the  wall  of the lab and
       disappeared from site.

       Seconds later, Keely readjusted the  machine  to  an orderly pattern
       which caused the sphere to retrace its path and return to the proper
       orbit.

       The movie "Explorers" with the electrical point in space is the best
       demonstration of this effect that we have come across.

       Astor was dumbfounded by the entire experience.  We  have no further
       information on this  particular story, so we don't know if Keely got
       funding or whatever.
