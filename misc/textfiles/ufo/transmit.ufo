Note:  What follows are typed in portions of four pages of text. The
       first two pages, are medical reports from the University of
       California Medical Center, San Diego.  The third page is a
       letter from Dr. P.A. Lindstrom to Robert Naeslund.  The last
       page is a brief summary of the brain transmitter experiments
       as compiled by R. Naeslund and friends.  At the end of the
       third and fourth pages, there are several paragraphs of
       commentary, attributed to someone by the name of "Koski".
       This file begins with a few observations made by UFORIC
       Director Lorne Goldfeather as to the implications of the
       Swedish brain transmitter experiments on the subject of
       brain implants being performed during "alien abductions".
======================================================================

======================================================================

    -- Human implantations are not only possible but have been done
       years ago and documented in studies.  Therefore it is quite
       conceivable and closer to reality than science fiction that
       if aliens are abducting humans, they could indeed be
       implanting a sophisticated monitoring device.

   	TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

	Recently I reviewed a skull film marked: NASLUND, ROBERT and
        dated 26-11, 1981.  That film shows a couple of unusual
        foreign bodies at the base of the skull, possibly some form
        of brain transmitters.

        However, I have not examined or talked to this patient and
        do not know the pertinent history.

 Mr. Robert Naeslund

 Dear Mr. Naeslund:

 In response to your most recent letter regardging the roentgen films,
 I can only confirm that some foreign objects, most likely brain
 transmitters, have been implanted at the base of your frontal brain
 and in the skull.

 The risk of such implantations is considerable and the risk of chronic
 infections and meningitis when the implantation has been made through
 the nose or the sinuses are real issues.

 In my opinion, there is no excuse for such implantations if the
 patient has not been fully informed about the procedures, the
 purposes, the risks, the method of anesthesia, etc, and then gives
 a clear written consent.

 I fully agree with Lincoln Lawrence, who in his book on page 27 wrote:
 "There are two particularly dreadful procedures which have been
 developed.  Those working and playing with them secretly call them
 R.H.I.C. and E.D.O.M. -- Radio-Hypnotic Intracerebral Control and
 Electronic Dissolution of Memory."

 Many years ago I had some discussions with Delgado.  He asked me to
 apply my ultrasonic technique for his particular purpose of altering
 patient's behaviour but I declined because we had entirely different
 airs and approaches.  However, I found Delgado to be an intelligent
 but somewhat strange man.

 Best wishes,

 KOSKI'S COMMENTARY, APPARENTLY (he is one of the victims referred to
 below) (I THINK KOSKI IS THE ONE DISTRIBUTING THIS MATERIAL)


 Robert Naeslund is one of the victims of Swedish brain-research.
 On 15th January 1985 Robert Naeslund and 49 other people send a
 petition to Magnus Sjberg, the Director of Public Prosecutions
 of Sweden.  The 49 people who had signed the petition varied for
 professor of physics to journalists and human rights activists.
 In petition they demanded investigation about braintransmitters
 that are implanted in heads of people without their knowledge
 and consent.
 The director of public prosecutions who haven't earlier answered
 Robert Naeslund's letters didn't answered this time either.  His
 subordinate, Chief Prosecutor Jonny Jarnefelt made his decision
 after 3 months waiting that there is no reason to believe that
 crime which may lead legal action has been committed and therefore
 no investigation will be made.
     This in spite of three professors testimony that certifies
 presence of strange foreign objects in Robert Naeslund's skull.

 	On 1985.  I got contact for R. Naeslund who is a victim of
 Swedish brain-research.  This yellow leaf is compiled from
 information R. Naeslund and his friends have gathered.


 (NOTE: Article follows)


 BRAIN TRANSMITTER

 Device which stream through the brain with a frequency that picks
 up the sensory functions of the brain by means of a transmitted
 wave length, which is transmitted to a receiver.  Vision, thoughts,
 images, hearing, etc are completely obvious to the person who has
 the receiver connected to his head.  Vision can even be transmitted
 to a screen.  The eyes of the person with an installed brain
 transmitter function in this case the equivalent of the lens of a
 camera.

 (NOTE: comment on the margin -  This is _not_ fantasy.  Read J.M.R.
 Delgado's "Physical Control Of The Mind.")

 The brain transmitter is the size of about half of a cigarette filter.
 The shell is manufactured of optical fibre, and teh contents of
 liquid chrystals.

 The brain transmitter is inserted into the head through the nose.

 During its first experimental period the brain transmitter was
 implanted in patients under general or local anesthesia during
 hospital operations.  The police began to use brain transmitters
 around 1972.

 During the early 70's, the police instigated illegal use of brain
 transmitters.  People under arrest and in detention were
 anaesthetized by mixing somnisacients in food and drink.  The
 apparatus was then inserted.

 A doctor at one of the larger hospitals in Stockholm has also
 mentioned that young children were also used for these experiments
 in order to evaluate thought activity and reactions in children.

 (NOTE: comment on the margin - They start young. They (the victims)
 are "visited" regularly throughout their lives by the controllers.)

 According to information from a person close to Department Head
 Falkenstam at the National Swedish Police Board, Swedish Prime
 Minister Palme gave the police the rights in 1973 to insert brain
 transmitters into the heads of human beings.

 It has been verified by people in official positions that the brain
 transmitter is used both in the Soviet Union and the United States,
 as well as in countries such as Sweden.

 One of the brain transmiiter centre in Sweden is known to be
 located at the police headquarters at Kungsholmen, Stockholm.

 (NOTE: end of article)


	Some of the victims of Swedish brain-manipulation are dead,
 some alive.  According to Robert Naeslund, the last victim who
 died was Edward Kelly.  He died for cancer on 28, May 1985.
  	United Nations Center of Human Rights, Chief for communications
 unit, Jacob T.H. Muller answered on 14th August for a complaint made
 for Swedish government illegal use of brainstransmitters: "I regret
 having to inform you that the United Nations cannot be of any
 assistance to you in the matter which you have raised."
	With the exception of a few free newspapers, Swedish media have
 exercised total silence about this matter
