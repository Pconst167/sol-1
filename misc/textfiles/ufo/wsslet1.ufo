Dear Stan:

     I received a letter from Fred Darwin of Dallas, Texas, in which
he laid down the history of N.D.R.C. - O.S.R.D. as it became J.D.R.B.
and eventually ended up becoming R.D.B.  He gave me names of persons
whom he considered to be the most likely candidates for team members
on a Flying Saucer recovery operation - "if there were ever such a
happening". They are as follows:

          (1) Dr. Vannevar Bush
          (2) Dr. Karl T. Compton
          (3) Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner
          (4) Dr. Robert F. Rinehart
          (5) Dr. Eric A. Walker
          (6) Dr. John Von Neumann

     I did some library research on each name, xeroxing a biography
of each individual, and looking up their descendants in local area
telephone directories.
     Stan, I believe that the name of that individual, whom Sarbacher
mentioned as attending all of the meetings pertaining to recovered
flying saucers, is Dr. Eric A. Walker.
                   ------------------
     Remember Sarbacher stating (moore let me hear that tape
recording) that this man came from Pennsylvannia and wrote a book
on Electrical Engineering; well Walker, at that time, was President
of Penn state university, was formerly head of Penn States electrical
Engineering Dept., wrote a book on Electrical Engineering, and was a 
consultant ("dollar a year man") to J.R.D.B 1949-1951. He also was in
charge of a naval laboratory that was developing electronically sonar
guided Torpedoes - which were consequently showing very positive
results against the Japanese during WW II.
     The last residence that I have for him is as follows:

               Dr. Eric A. Walker
               Rock Springs Farm Pennsylvania
               Furnace, Pennsylvania
               16895

     I suppose that Moseley contacted you as pertaining to Dr. Robert
I. Sarbacher. This only proves one thing to me; Moseley is just as
interested in the Crash-Recovery cases as he was in 1954.
     Stan, I am not doing research for Todd Zechel, altho I did have
an earlier run-in with him, which I later regreted. My main goal is
to solve the Flying Saucer Enigma, through the recovery and attempted
duplication cases.
     Please let me know what you find out through Dr. Walker, and do
keep in touch.

                                   Very Sincerely
                                   WM Steinman
