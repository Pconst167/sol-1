Found: Algorithm used by IBM in calculating CRC checksums for PS/2
       (see bytes 32h-33h). Complex (recursive part is 12 lines of
       assembly) and not yet validated for every model.


			Background

The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) memory is actually 
a 64 or 128 byte battery-backed RAM memory module that is a part of the 
system clock chip. Some IBM PS/2 models have the capability for a
2k (2048 byte) CMOS ROM Extension.

First used with clock-calender cards for the IBM PC-XT, when the PC/AT
(Advanced Technology) was introduced in 1985, the Motorola MC146818 
became a part of the motherboard. Since the clock only uses fourteen of 
the RAM bytes, the rest are available for storing system configuration data.

Interestingly, the original IBM-PC/AT (Advanced Technology) standard for 
the region 10h-3Fh is nearly universal with one notable exception: The 
IBM PS/2 systems deviate considerably (Note: AMSTRAD 8086 machines were 
among the first to actively use the CMOS memory available and since they 
*predate* the AT, do not follow the AT standard).

This is just another example of how IBM created a standard, lost control 
of it, tried to replace it, failed and lost market share in the process. 

Originally, the IBM PC/AT only made use of a small portion of CMOS memory
and was defined in the IBM PC/AT Technical Reference Manual, specifically 
bytes 10h, 12h, 14h-18h, 2Eh-33h. The balance was left undefined but was 
quickly appropriated by various BIOS manufacturers for such user-selectable 
options such as wait states, clock speeds, initial boot drive selection, and 
password storage.

Later, as CMOS memory requirements grew, newer clock chips with 128
bytes of RAM came into use. However the fact remains that once the AT 
standard was established, only IBM has tried to change the definitions 
of that first description.

			Accessing the CMOS

The CMOS memory exists outside of the normal address space and cannot
contain directly executable code. It is reachable through IN and OUT
commands at port number 70h (112d) and 71h (113d). To read a CMOS byte,
an OUT to port 70h is executed with the address of the byte to be read and
an IN from port 71h will then retrieve the requested information. The 
following BASIC fragment will read 128 CMOS bytes and print them to the 
screen in 8 rows of 16 values.

CMOS RAM space has an upper limit of 128 bytes because of the structure
of port 70: only bits 0-6 are used for addressing, bit 7 is used to 
enable (0) or disable (1) Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI) and explains why
IBM uses 80h OR <address> to read/write data & follows with  a "throw-away"
call.

Note that if the CMOS only has 64 bytes available, addressing will 
generally wrap and addresses from 40h-7Fh will mirror 00h-3Fh. Output will 
be hexadecimal.

10 CLS
20 FOR i = 0 TO &H7F 
30 OUT &H70, i
40 PRINT USING "\   \"; HEX$(INP(&H71));
50 NEXT i
60 PRINT " " 

Note: where not otherwise noted, all data points are expressed as BYTES
      these are eight bit values and are read from MSB to LSB e.g.
      0000 0000     0101 1010 binary would be written as 5Ah
      7654 3210     where only some bits are used this is represented with
                    Xs e.g bits 5-3 would be shown as 00xx x000


		Organization of CMOS Memory - Clock

00h-0Eh is defined by the clock hardware and all must follow it. Other 
manufacturers generally follow the same format as specified for the
region 10h - 2Fh. Some also follow the IBM format for 30h-33h but not all 
(Zenith in particular is different).

The first fourteen bytes are dedicated to the MC146818 chip clock functions 
and consist of ten read/write data registers and four status registers, two 
of which are read/write and two of which are read only.

The format of the ten clock data registers (bytes 00h-09h) is:

 00h Seconds       (BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B) Note: Bit 7 is read only      
 01h Second Alarm  (BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B)      
 02h Minutes       (BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B))         
 03h Minute Alarm  (BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B)       
 04h Hours         (BCD 00-23, Hex 00-17 if 24 hr mode)
                   (BCD 01-12, Hex 01-0C if 12 hr am)
                   (BCD 81-92. Hex 81-8C if 12 hr pm)         
 05h Hour Alarm    (same as hours)     
 06h Day of Week   (01-07 Sunday=1)    
 07h Date of Month (BCD 01-31, Hex 01-1F)    
 08h Month         (BCD 01-12, Hex 01-0C)         
 09h Year          (BCD 00-99, Hex 00-63)         

BCD/Hex selection depends on Bit 2 of register B (0Bh)
12/24 Hr selection depends on Bit 1 of register B (0Bh)
Alarm will trigger when contents of all three Alarm byte registers
match their companions.

The following is the on-chip status register information. 

 0Ah Status Register A (read/write) (usu 26h)
  Bit 7     - (1) time update cycle in progress, data ouputs undefined 
              (bit 7 is read only)
  Bit 6,5,4 - 22 stage divider. 010b - 32.768 Khz time base (default)
  Bit 3-0   - Rate selection bits for interrupt.
              0000b - none
              0011b - 122 microseconds (minimum)
              1111b - 500 milliseconds  
              0110b - 976.562 microseconds (default)

 0Bh Status Register B (read/write) 
  Bit 7 - 1 enables cycle update, 0 disables
  Bit 6 - 1 enables periodic interrupt
  Bit 5 - 1 enables alarm interrupt
  Bit 4 - 1 enables update-ended interrupt
  Bit 3 - 1 enables square wave output
  Bit 2 - Data Mode - 0: BCD, 1: Binary
  Bit 1 - 24/12 hour selection - 1 enables 24 hour mode
  Bit 0 - Daylight Savings Enable - 1 enables

 0Ch Status Register C (Read only)
  Bit 7 - Interrupt request flag - 1 when any or all of bits 6-4 are
          1 and appropriate enables (Register B) are set to 1. Generates
          IRQ 8 when triggered.
  Bit 6 - Periodic Interrupt flag
  Bit 5 - Alarm Interrupt flag 
  Bit 4 - Update-Ended Interrupt Flag
  Bit 3-0 ???

 0Dh Status Register D (read only)
  Bit 7 - Valid RAM - 1 indicates batery power good, 0 if dead or
          disconnected.
  Bit 6-0 ???

---------------------------------------------

		Organization of CMOS Memory - non-Clock

The last two bytes in the first hexadecimal decade (hexade ?) were not 
specified in the PC/AT but may have the following use on some systems:

 0Eh (PS/2) Diagnostic Status Byte 
     Bit 7 - When set (1) indicates clock has lost power
     Bit 6 - (1) indicates incorrect checksum
     Bit 5 - (1) indicates that equipment configuration is incorrect
                 power-on check requires that atleast one floppy be installed
     Bit 4 - (1) indicates error in memory size
     Bit 3 - (1) indicates that controller or disk drive failed initialization
     Bit 2 - (1) indicates that time is invalid
     Bit 1 - (1) indicates installed adaptors do not match configuration
     Bit 0 - (1) indicates a time-out while reading adaptor ID

 0Eh (AMSTRAD) 6  BYTEs time and date machine last used

 0Fh Reset Code        
     (IBM PS/2 "Shutdown Status Byte")

---------------------------------------------

The second group of values extends from address 10h to 2Dh. The word at
2Eh-2Fh is a byte-wise summation of the values in these bytes. Most BIOSes
will generate a CMOS Checksum error if this value is invalid however many 
programs ignore the checksum and report the apparent value. The current
version of MSD reports my XT as having 20+ MB of extended memory. 

Where a definiton appears universal, no identification is made. Where
the definition is thought to be specific to a manufacturer/model (AMI, 
AMSTRAD, IBM AT, IBM PS/2) the identification is enclosed in parens. The
AMSTAD definitions appear to relate to 8088/8086 (PC and PC/XT class)
mchines only. AT class machines appear to adhere to IBM PC/AT fornat.

 End of original 64 CMOS RAM bytes. Many modern chips now contain 128
 bytes and the IBM PS/2 has provision for 2k of "Expansion CMOS". 
 The AMI HI-FLEX description is below. If the chip does have only
 64 bytes, addresses will wrap so that requests for bytes 40h-7Fh will 
 return the same values as 00h-3Fh.
