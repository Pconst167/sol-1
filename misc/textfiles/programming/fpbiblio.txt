This is a bibliography of material on floating point arithmetic that I
came up with while doing research on a floating-point package of my own.
I don't claim it to be anywhere near complete. The material listed is
only what I myself possess. My main interest was in software based,
binary floating point arithmetic on a microprocessor, so you won't find
much material about the hardware used in floating point arithmetic (e.g.
adders, carry propagation schemes, higher radix representation for multi-
plication and division, etc.) in this list. There is also not too much on
non-binary floating point arithmetic. For most fields covered in this
bibliography, the important or historically relevant articles should be
included. There is also some material on integer arithmetic in this list
as some of the methods used with integer arithmetic contain interesting
ideas that may be useful in the realization of a floating point arithmetic
package. Also, depending on the type of microprocessor used, one may
need to implement integer multiplication and division for use in the
floating-point package, so articles about this topic are included as well.
As I am German, there is a bit of material in German in this bibliography.
All German umlauts are written in German LaTeX format, that is "a, "o, "u, "s.
These are equivalent to \"a, \"o, \"u, \"s in plain TeX.
