Welcome to Issue #1 of Pazuzu's Guide to C Programming: The Fun, Easy, And 
Possibly DESTRUCTIVE Way to Learn C!  

You may wonder why I'm writing an article on a non-underground topic. In 
truth, it's really not any of your fucking business and you should just BUTT 
OUT, MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS, AND ENJOY THE INFO. But, since I'm in a 
good mood, I'll tell you anyway.

I've been seeing posts all over the place, on nets, local BBS's, everywhere, 
with people saying "hOw Do YoU pRoGrAm In C?!^%$!$!$!!!?????". So, I decided 
to write a tutorial series so that even the stupidest fool who can't even use 
WINDOWS will be able to program in C, without damaging his hard drive (at 
least not physically anyway.).  Actually, you can't be a total idiot, you DO 
have to get a C compiler, and figure out how to use it, because I'm not 
telling you how to use the compiler, only how to write programs. If you can't 
accomplish the simple task of getting a C compiler and figuring out how to 
use it (I recommend Turbo or Borland C, as some of my examples are 
TC/BC-specific), then please put your computer in a suitable shipping box and 
ship it to the PO box listed at the end of this article, then place a loaded 
gun to your head and pull the trigger. 


C programming is not particularly difficult, and I assume only a knowledge 
of either BASIC or Pascal in this series. C will save you much time when 
coding, just in typing alone. For example, in Pascal, to define a code block, 
you have to type "Begin" and "End". This is utterly ridiculous. In C, it is 
simply "{" and "}". Besides, Pascal was invented as a teaching language 
anyway, while C was made BY programmers FOR programmers, and we ALL know what 
BASIC is for, so WHY would you want to use anything but C?



Variables, Declarations, Type Specifiers, Etc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In BASIC, when you need a variable, you just use it. However, in most other 
languages, you must DECLARE each variable before it is used. You do this by 
telling the compiler the name of the variable and what type of data it needs 
to hold. Here are a few examples in C:

int i;
register int j;
char a_string[9];
unsigned char q;

The first line declares an integer variable named "i", which can hold any 
value between -32,767 and +32,767 - the maximum values allowed in 16 bits. 

The second line is a special case - it tells the compiler to write code that
will use a REGISTER for the variable, if one is available. You would do this 
for any variables that are used for loop control, as the CPU can access a 
register MUCH faster than a memory location, and any loop control variable is 
going to be accessed many times. If there is no register available, the 
compiler just makes it a normal variable - you don't need to worry about it. 

Line 3 is a very important example. There isn't a string data type in C - you
must use arrays of char's. Line 3 defines an 8-character string. Why only 8?, 
you ask... Well, in C, every string must end in a NULL (ASCII 0), and that 
NULL takes up a position in memory, so you need to always make the strings 
one bigger than what you really need. The NULL is handled automagically by 
all of the library's string functions. 

Line 4 defines an 8-bit variable which can hold either an actual ASCII 
character or an integer value in the range 0 to 255 - the maximum for 8 
bits. If you define an unsigned int, you can hold a value between 0 and 
65,535. The reason for this is that C assumes you want a signed unless you 
say unsigned. The highest bit is always used for the sign, so with a signed 
int, you can have -32,767 to +32,767 (-128 thru +128 for signed char), and 
with an unsigned, you get 0 thru 65,535 for int, and 0 thru 255 for char. 
There's a few other type specifiers also, the most important being long. If 
you apply long to an int, you get 32 bits, which is a pretty huge range, even 
if it's signed. Unsigned, it's really huge. I don't remember the range off 
the top of my head, and I don't want to load the compiler and check in the 
help right now, so you'll just have to figure it out yourself. But trust me, 
it's big enough to handle any values you could ever possibly want. 




Very Basic C Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With that out of the way, on to the structure of a C program... 

C is a weird language in that it defines NO, that's right - NO input/output 
commands... "Well then how the fuck do I do input/output???" you ask. You do 
it through FUNCTION CALLS. The C language has control structures, arithmetic 
operators, and logical test commands, but no i/o commands - that is the job
of the library. Every C compiler comes with a library, and it's basically 
standardized - for example, printf will almost always be printf, but the 
compiler writer could have just as easily called it print_the_fucking_stuff 
if he really wanted to. 


A C program is made up of functions and function calls. The *MUST* be one 
function, called main() which is what gets called when you first execute the 
program... Here is an example of a very basic C program:

#include <stdio.h>

void main(void) {
   clrscr();
   printf("\n\nhElLo cReWeL, EViL, aNd WiCKED wOrLd!%$^!$!!^%$!^%$!!\n\n");
}

This illustrates several important things:

Line 1 (the #include line): The #include command isn't a C command, it's a 
command to the compiler to include (I bet you would have never figured that 
out!!!) another file into the compilation. In this case, we are including the 
stANdARD iNPUT/oUTPUT library header file. We need to do this because without 
it, the compiler won't know what the fuck we're talking about when we use any 
i/o functions - they're defined in stdio.h ...

Line 2: This declares the main() function. The first void tells the compiler 
that main() doesn't return any value to the caller (since there isn't one!), 
while the second void tells the compiler that main() doesn't require any 
parameters. The { opens the function block.

Line 3: This is a call to the library's clear screen routine.

Line 4: This prints a string. The "\n"'s are NEWLINES, they tell the function 
to go to the next line. You will also notice that all statement lines and in 
a ";"...

Line 5 (}): This ends main()'s function block, and also in this case the 
program. 

This illustrates several important points, as well as carries on the 
traditional of ALWAYS making programming students write a "hello world" 
program as their first. Of course, I altered the text, because I'm scum, but 
ohwell. 


Here is another sample program:

#include <stdio.h>

void main(void) {
   register int i;
   char inpstr[81];
   for(i=0;i<100;i++) {
      clrscr();
      printf("\n\nInput a string: ");
      gets(inpstr);
      printf("\n\nYou typed: %s, number %i\n",inpstr,i);
      gets(inpstr);
   }
}

Ok, the first few lines should already be familiar for you. I'm going to 
start with the "for..." line. This illustrates an important thing in C - the 
for loop. Most other languages have this - in BASIC its FOR I = 1 TO 100. The 
C version is a bit harder to understand, yet infinitely more powerful. The 
first part ("i=0;") set the loop counter to 0. The second part ("i<100";) 
specifies what condition to test when deciding if the loop is done yet. In 
this case, as long as i is less than 100, the loop will execute. The last 
part ("i++") specifies the increment command. This command is what gets 
executed to increment the loop counter. In this case, i gets 1 added to it 
every time the loop executes. The "++" operator is VERY important: In other 
languages, you have to code i = i + 1 - in C, the i = i + 1 is valid - 
however, it will be less efficient when compiled. The reason for the is that 
the i=i+1 version compiles to an ADD instruction, while i++ would compile to 
a simple INC instruction. This is far more efficient. This is called "C 
SHORTHAND", and there are several others as well: i-- (subtract 1), i+=3 
(i=i+3), and so on. Of course, the variable doesn't have to be i, could be 
any other variable.

Another VERY important concept is demonstrated by this for loop as well - the 
BLOCK STATEMENT. Any place a normal single statement is valid, a block 
statement enclosed by { and } is also valid. In this example, everything 
between the { and } will get executed on each iteration of the loop.

clrscr() is the Borland library function to clear the screen - other 
compilers may vary. 

The first printf statement should be quite obvious.

gets() is one of the Borland library functions to input a string from the 
keyboard. Quite simple.

The next printf line shows off part of the true power of printf. The string 
between the quotes in any printf statement is really a FORMAT STRING, and in 
most cases, will just be output as is. However, if you insert any % commands, 
printf will expect additional arguments to tell it what to print in their 
place. The %s means put a string at this position, and %i means use an 
integer. For every % command, you must have a variable, separated by commas 
outside the closing quote, else you will crash your program. In this case, 
printf will print "You typed: " then whatever you typed into inpstr, then ", 
number " and the current value of i. This makes printf very powerful as 
I'm sure you can see. 

The last gets() line just makes you press enter to continue.




I've covered quite a bit here, and you can actually do quite a bit with this 
small amount of knowledge, if you're creative enough. Next issue, I'll cover 
pointers, bit fields, structures, and basic file accessing.
