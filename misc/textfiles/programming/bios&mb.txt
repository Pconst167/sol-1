If you own an AMI bios, set auto-detection (of newly installed devices and
memory configuration changes) to OFF. My machine was set to ON when I bought
it, and that turned out a Norton SI score of 99.8, now, when set to on, it
pumps out 107.9.

Sometimes it is not called "auto-detection". But it's always something similar,
so you can really figure it out...

The only case you want to set it on, is when you have installed more ram, etc..
Then reboot, and set it to OFF again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other useful parameters so set are, ALL cache [this and that] to on.
Memory tick sound=off.
Test memory over 1 mb=off.

hmmmmmmm........ I will think of more as I proceed......

If you by mistake set the password-checking in the bios to ON, the password
is AMI by default. If you however have changed the password before turning
password-checking to on, there are still two things you might do.

1)	Search the motherboard for a jumper that states "bios password check",
	or something similar. Change it, turn on the machine, remove the
	password, save and leave the bios, turn off the machine, and put
	the jumper back in place.

2)	Remove the CMOS battery. It is usually (?) blue, and the size of
	2*3*1.5cm's. Remove it, and put it back in. ALL your bios settings
	should now be gone. You DID take a backup of it, didn't you??!?

	If it is melted down into a socket. There IS a way to remove it,
	but nah.... That should be left to professionals.

If you cannot change the parameters supplied with your BIOS, there IS a way to
change it! There are some special operations you can easily do with machine-
code to change your parameters, but the upmost excellent way of doing this
is to use a program that usually is supplied with your computer. If it is not,
you might freely download a program that do the same task (or you may HOPE
that that's what it does. There is no safety regarding this. Bios'es is
different...) An even better solution is to buy a version of Checkit PRO
that I think contains code that let's you change your CMOS parameters...
(Great, a 100$+ product to change your CMOS settings!), Ofcourse, you might
find additional uses for that product, or you might find different products
that performs similar actions.

If your motherboard supports changes of clock-speeds, you might try out a new
setting. Usually the jumper is marked by a VL-BUS clock speed jumper, or by
a CLOCK-SPEED jumper (or motherboard clo...., and so on...). Set it higher
and higher, if possible. If your system boots nice with this change, AND your
computers built in clock works fine, you might find out that you want to live
with the new configuration. If you do so, INSTALL A FAN! I have experienced
a 50 mhz dx2 burn up when left on for a whole day! If the processor feels
hot, install a heat sink in addition! Coolness extends your computers life, and
might avoid some unfortunate errors, like sudden system crashes, bios failure,
etc.... Intel and all other chip manufacturers STRONGLY DISCOURAGES you to
set the clock speed higher than rated. But several systems work fine. For
example, a 486 sx 25, where set to 50Mhz, and now it BLAZES away! Several
people have tried this with luck, so you might want to consult them before
taking any actions. A good place to meet such people, is at a BBS, a NET
like internet, or perhaps the excellent Compuserve Information Service (CIS),
America ONLINE, or some other place.
