<H1>Programming Textfiles: Bowen's Instruction Summary Cards</H1>
<P>
Sometimes, you'll stumble upon the work of someone that takes your breath
away, for many different reasons. Such is the work of Jonathan Bowen of the
Oxford University Computing Laboratory, who has maintained a truly
<I>excellent</I> set of instruction summary cards for many major chips in use
by computers from the 60's to the present day. While the first of these files
is dated from 1982, Mr. Bowen has continued to maintain them for accuracy
and new information for all the years hence; decades of vigilance to keep
his work relevant and useful.
<P>
The intention of these summaries is to print them out and have at the ready
as you work with these different processors, and they've been designed for 
easy printing and clear reference. 
<P>
Besides instruction sets, there are also command summaries, and, in an 
interesting tangent, the solution to several puzzles, including the original
Rubik's Cube and its variants. This is truly a treasure.
