A number of quick reference cards have been produced. These are 64
characters wide with 80 lines on each page. Each card consists of
three pages. With appropriate formatting, the cards look good with
the pages side by side on A4 paper or card in landscape format.  They
may then be conveniently folded. (See Microprocessors and Microsystems,
Vol 9, No 6 (July/August 1985), pp274-289 for more details.)

A selection of the programming cards for microprocessors from various
manufacturers may be found in this directory.  See the file "00index"
for a list.
