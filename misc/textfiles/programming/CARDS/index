A number of quick reference cards have been produced. These are 64
characters wide with 80 lines on each page. Each card consists of
three pages. With appropriate formatting, the cards look good with
the pages side by side on A4 paper or card in landscape format.  They
may then be conveniently folded. (See Microprocessors and Microsystems,
Vol 9, No 6 (July/August 1985), pp274-289 for more details.)

A selection of the programming cards for microprocessors from various
manufacturers may be found in this directory.  The full set available
at present comprises of the following:

 uP - microprocessor, uC - microcomputer.

In addition to the above cards for microprocessors and microcomputers,
a number of other support cards have been written in a similar format.
These include the following:

 Name      Description

 HP64000   HP64000 assembler and uP support summary
 HP_Pascal HP64000 Pascal compiler summary
 Macro-11  DEC Macro-11 assembler summary
 Pascal    Pascal programming language summary

A number of puzzle solutions are also available:

 Name      Description

 Rubik     Rubik's Cube (3x3x3 cube)
 Revenge   Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4 cube)
 Pyramix   Pyramid - similar to Rubik's cube but simpler

A highly machine dependent shell script for use under BSD Unix may be
of use to some people. This processes the files above and outputs them
in a form suitable for a PostScript printer in landscape format with
each of the three columns side by side. As well as standard Unix
utilities such as "sed", this script also depends on "rs" (available on
some BSD (and other?) systems) for producing the three column format,
and also the PostScript formatting program "enscript". Output can
optionally be sent directly to a PostScript printer called "ps". If
this might be useful to you, it is available as:

 Name      Description

 process   Process card for output on PostScript printer

If anyone produces cards in this format or any associated formatting
software which they are willing to have included in the PRG archive,
please send them to me at one of the e-mail addresses below.

Currently the following submissions are available:

 SC        Spreadsheet Calculator in comp.unix.sources
 imagen    Process card for output on Imagen printer
