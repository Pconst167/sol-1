               Inmark zApp vs. Borland Object Windows Library		

"zApp is a second-generation application framework for C++ under Windows that
implements the same general concepts as Borland's Object Windows Library but
takes them significantly further, with about 130 classes. ... The zApp class
library is larger than OWL's and much richer." - Jeff Duntemann, Editor-in-
Chief, PC Techniques, Apr/May 92.
