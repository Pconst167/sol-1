/*
 *  Generic Heapsort.
 *
 *  Synopsis:
 *	hsort(char *base, unsigned n, unsigned size, int (*fn)())
 *  Description:
 *	Hsort sorts the array of `n' items which starts at address `base'.
 *	The size of each item is as given.  Items are compared by the function
 *	`fn', which is passed pointers to two items as arguments. The function
 *	should return < 0 if item1 < item2, == 0 if item1 == item2, and > 0
 *	if item1 > item2.
 *  Version:
 *	1988 April 28
 *  Author:
 *	Stephen Russell, Department of Computer Science,
 *	University of Sydney, 2006
