What is more confusing than Hayes AT-commands? (Init's maybe.......=*)

Let's list the ones I know (the most HANDY though, left out the rest!)

AT	Inform the modem that there is coming information.
A/	Repeat the previous command.

FROM HERE ON.....ALL COMMANDS LISTED SHOULD HAVE A "AT" DIRECTLY FORE THE
COMMAND! (Example......"A" would mean "ATA"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A	Answer the phone. An "ath1" and "ata" will also work...sometimes.
D	Dial the phone.
H0	Hang up the phone.
H1	Pick up the phone.

FROM HERE ON, YOU WILL NEED A "D" AFTER "AT". (Example...."P" would be "ATDP")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P	Pulse dial the phone. (slow, and sometimes bugs)
T	Tone dial the phone. (fast)

MODEM SPEAKER SECTION                                     (standard AT prefix)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L0	Very low speaker volume.
L1	Low speaker volume.
L2	Medium speaker volume.
L3	High speaker volume.

M0	Shut up the speaker!
M1	Speaker on, but off while carrier/connect.
M2	Turn on the speaker.

That is the most useful I know. There are SEVERAL others, but we won't
cover those........................yet. There is also SEVERAL other
vendor-specific at-commands.....

All..........................later!
