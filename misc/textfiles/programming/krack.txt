There are a couple of unprotects going around for this piece of software.
This one is rather short but others make you change 51 other bytes that seem
to be unneeded.  You will need DEBUG for you dos diskette and a Copy (doesn't
matter if it works) of NewsRoom.

      At Dos: A> Ren nwsrm.exe nwsrm.zap
              A> Debug nwsrm.zap
                -E 691A EB 41
                -E 6973 90 90
                -E 6977 EB 25 90
                -W
                -Q
              A> Ren nwsrm.zap nwsrm.exe
              A> Debug nwsrm1.ovl
                -E 05db 8B 46 04 89 46 FE 3B 46 04

                -W
                -Q

You now have a working copy of newsroom.  The only not is that all file
most reside on drive A:.  Assign can be use to allow this program to work
on a hard drive.

You will need:  Dos DEBUG
                A formatted Blank diskette
                A non working copy of the program

This tutorial show how defeat prolock on dBASE III but can be used for most
prolocked disks.

                    A> Debug DBASE.exe
                      -R

       You will now see whats in the registers.  Record the values
                      -U
                      -U

     Look for a LOOP instruction.  The next instruction will be a XCHG.
     Using the Address in the first column [091B:XXXX  92   XCHG  DX,AX]
     enter            -G XXXX
                      -S 100 3000 83 c4 08

     Some address will be listed.  Take the last address 091b:XXXX and
                      -A XXXX
                        XOR AX,AX
                        RET
     Press Return twice until the "-" prompt. enter
                      -S 100 3000 C0 45 F8
     This will display a single value [091B:XXXX].  use it and enter
                      -E XXXX 0B 46
                      -M 0:c f 0:200
     Prolock will test for the original diskette enter
                      -R BX
                        0001
                      -R CX
     When prompted enter the original value of CX
                      -N TEMP
                      -S 100 3000 4D 5A
    Several values will be displayed.  Remove the program disk and
    insert the black disk and type
                      -W 1A50
                      -Q

  Locksmith is in my oppion the BEST copy program for the IBMpc.  Using
Special Parameters Locksmith can copy almost anything.  I hope to explain to
all you PC Pirates how to use this great program.  This is first in a 2 part
series on the use of locksmith.

Window #1:  Current Track Window.  This window is used for selecting what
          Tracks are to be used.  To get to this window press the [F1] key.
          If a number (Track) has a "." under it then it is to be used.
          The SPACEBAR is used to toggle a single Track.  The "+" key is
          used to toggle the whole side of a disk.  Left and Right Arrows
          keys are used to move the cursor.

Window #2:  This is the Sector window.  Here you will find the Size (N) and
          the Error in the sector if any and the percent of the track taken up
          by that sector.  By examine the sector's number you can find out how
          how the sectors are really numbered because some protection schemes
          use abnormal sector numbering.  HOME will take you to the top of the
          screen to the Number of sectors [SECTORS: 00] prompt.  This is used
          in creating your own protection schemes which will be explained in
          the next issue of KRACK: [F2] get this window

Window #3:  The data window can be used to examine, edit and create data to
          be written out to the disk.  So protection schemes need certain
          bytes to be changed.  [F3] get you here while [F9] toggle Ascii/Hex
          display.  If a search string has been entered then [F10] will start
          the search.

Copying something with locksmith is pretty easy.  If the disk is unprotected
then use the BACKUP in the SECTOR utilitys.  If the disk is protected then
you must use the BACKUP in the TRACK utilitys.  The best way to copy a
protected diskette is the first to Slow Copy the whole disk [TRACK utilitys]
then write down any odd tracks (more sectors than the other errors etc.).
Use Fast copy [SECTOR utilitys] to copy similar track then use Slow copy to
copy the Fuckup tracks.
