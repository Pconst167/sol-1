            Artificial Intelligence List - v2.3
                       -Apr 6 1990-
  
  This file contains a list of novels and stories which contain
  one or more Artificial Intelligence (AI) characters.  Most of
  characters whose intelligence places a title on this list are
  effected or affected through the use of hardware, software or
  genetic alteration (rarely).  Additions and corrections would
  be most appreciated as the list compiler <Garet Sheppard> has
  not read all of the works listed here - or even a significant
  portion, and will probably never have a chance to do so.   My
  thanks to Dan Bloch and Robert Stanley for suggestions, ideas
  and editing.  The list uses the following AI definitions:

   A  androids - robots in human form
   C  computer systems - intelligent stationary computers or networks
   H  humans in computerized/program/digitized form
   N  non-mechanical, human created intelligences - usually biological
   O  other intelligences - intelligent tanks, books, planets, whatever
   P  programs - intelligent entities able to move between computer systems
   R  robots - mobile, usually mechanical AIs
   S  ships - intelligent; only mobile in the form of a (star)ship
   Y  cyborgs - born human, almost completely replaced by machine parts
   *  new/improved - information has changed since last edition
   
   e  evolved - any of the AI forms which evolved their intelligences

	(expanded definitions are listed at the end of the list)

Things not included:

Dr. Who stuff      (K-9, Daliks, Cybermen)
ST:TNG stuff       (Mr. Data)

expanded definitions:
   
   All of the following should be able to pass the Turing test,
   and should be/have been (at the minimum in their original
   forms) products of human or alien intelligence.  "Standard"
   definitions of intelligence apply.

  androids (A) - robots in humanoid form, these can be mechanical
      and/or organic (_Do androids Dream of Electric Sheep_).
  computer systems (C) - these range in size and type from a
      fair sized mini computer (_Ariel_) to an planetary
      computer (_Colossus_) to a galactic network with one
      single mind (_Speaker for the Dead_).
  humans in computerized/program/digitized form (H) - these tend
      to be copies of people which only exist in computerized
      form - such as the hacker in (_Neuromancer_) and folks of
      City Memory in (_Eon_).
  non-mechanical, human created intelligences (N) - beings
      which have been (in most cases) genetically altered or
      are biological (_Blood Music_).  NOT forced evolution
      however.
  other intelligences (O) - beings which are difficult to
      categorize: anything Berserker, tanks, books, planets,
      planets (Asimov's Gaia), satellites, etc.  Where (O) is
      used, the particular form has also been named when known.
  programs (P) - able to move independently from one computer
      system to another, usually created by a program(mer)
      (_The Adolescence or P1_).
  robots (R) - constitute functional and specialized beings  
      which are mobile and are not (S) or (P).  Anything between
      vaguely humanoid (Dr. Who's Cybermen) and computers on
      wheels (R2D2) can be considered robots of the 'functional'
      robot class.  'Specialized' robots are those which are
      geared/optimized to performing one job - they can look like
      either androids (The Terminator) or functional robots (Val's
      from _Pirates of the Thunder_).
  ships/computer systems (S) - essentially an (A) which is
      only mobile in the form of a (star) ship (_Pirates of the
      Thunder_).  However, there are cases where the (S) is
      essentially a well programmed (R) which is only mobile
      as stated (_The Number of the Beast_).
  cyborgs/mechanical humans (Y) - strictly speaking these are not
      AI. The definition here is that the (Y) is either (1) a human
      brain in control of a computer system/star ship (_The Ship
      Who Sang_) where at the very least the person's brain has
      been modified to contain computerized parts (_The Rapture
      Effect?_) (Did you ever wish that you could have a math
      co-processor?).  (Y)'s are NOT (for the purpose of this
      list) organic beings whose natural body parts have been
      replaced by mechanical ones (ie. Luke Skywalker after
      his forearm was severed, or bionic people).
  unsure/no idea (?) - just what it says, so someone PLEASE read
      it and tell me what type is is and whether it belongs here.
  evolved AI being (e) - usually begin as man-made devices
      which then develop intelligence on their own (_Valentina_).
