          Introduction


               Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was developed by Hans
          Kamp 1981 in order to combine "a definition of truth with a
          systematic account of semantic representations (277)".  The

          semantic representations produced are to provide a bridge between
          syntactic parses and model theoretic semantics such that the
          representations can be used to determine the truth conditions of
          a discourse.  This report describes that theory, both the

          original, basic form and some extensions that have been suggested
          by Kamp and others, and applies it to a "real" discourse in order
          to indicate further extensions that will be necessary if DRT is
          to be used as a complete theory of semantic representations.

               Truth in model theoretic semantics is determined by a
          mapping from a representation of the discourse to a model, a
          mapping that preserves the properties and relationships of the
          discourse.  A model consists of two sets: a set of entities (the

          universe) and a set of properties of those entities and relations
          that hold among them.  The discourse representation must likewise
          consist of two sets, a set of referenced items and a set of
          propositions about those items.  A discourse is held to be true

          in a model if there is a mapping such that the set of referenced
          items maps to a subset of the universe and each property or
          relation expressed by the propositions is true of the
          corresponding entities in the model.  

               Kamp addressed the questions of how a discourse places items
          in the set of referenced items and of how anaphoric relations can
          be expressed in the discourse representation.  In particular, he
          was concerned with situations in which an item should not be

          placed in that set yet should serve as the antecedent for an
          anaphoric relationship (the so-called "donkey sentences").  To
          that end, he developed the basic version of DRT (1981).  Part 1







                                                                          2

          of this report describes that basic theory.  Part 2 presents some
          extensions to the basic theory.  Part 3 describes an attempt to
          represent a text in DRT and suggests further extensions that
          might be made.


          1.   Discourse Representation Theory

               The central notion of DRT is the Discourse Representation

          Structure (DRS).  A DRS K is a pair <U, C>, where U is a set of
          reference markers (the universe) and C is a set of conditions
          (properties, relations, or complex conditions--negation,
          disjunction, or implication).  The initial DRS, K0, contains none

          of the information in the discourse. As the discourse is
          processed, the DRS construction algorithm produces a series of K'
          as it incorporates material from the discourse into K.  For
          example 


          (1)       Pedro owns a donkey.
                    K:<U:{R1, R2},
                       C:{Pedro(R1),

                          donkey(R2),
                          own(R1, R2)}>

               Although U and C are described as sets, at least one of

          these must be ordered by time of introduction into the discourse
          if the construction algorithm is to work properly in assigning
          antecedents to anaphoric expressions (cf Goodman 1988). 
          Antecedent assignment is accomplished by finding an item in U

          that agrees with the anaphoric expression (for pronouns, an
          entity that agrees in gender and number). Thus, (2) shows an
          extension of (1) (:= is an assignment operator, as in Pascal; +
          is union of sets):


          (2)       He beats it.
                    K: <U, 
                        C := C + {beat(R1, R2)}>


          (The basic theory would add R3, R4 to U, and then set them equal
          to R1, R2, respectively.  A later "clean-up" operation would
          eliminate these redundant discourse markers.  Here we assume that


          







                                                                          3





          the clean-up operation has been applied.)  A discourse of any
          size, however, is likely to include several such entities; most
          often, the conflict is resolved by selecting from the candidates
          the one that was most recently encountered.  In order to make

          that selection possible, the set of items must be ordered, and
          must in fact be re-ordered every time reference is made to an
          entity.
               For purposes of exposition, K0 is usually treated as

          consisting of empty sets.  Such is often not the case in real
          discourse, where referring items are often exophoric, their
          referents to be found in the nonlinguistic context or in the
          shared knowledge of the participants.  While DRT allows for such

          references, it is not clear how or when the antecedents are to be
          entered into K.
               Kamp 1985 describes the DRS construction algorithm is "a set
          of rules that operate, in a roughly top-down manner, on the nodes

          of the parse tree, (2)" converting those nodes into the
          conditions of C and, when appropriate, introducing new reference
          markers into U.  As was noted in the introduction to this report,
          the basic version of DRT is directed toward the role of noun-

          phrase (NP) nodes in the discourse--their relationship to U.
               It would seem, at first glance, that every NP should be
          associated with an entity in the model and should therefore have
          a corresponding marker in U.  (That view is, of course, a great

          oversimplification.  Most work in DRT has limited itself to
          singular concrete NPs, where the oversimplification is not so
          drastic.)  When the algorithm encounters a NP, it should either
          associate it with a marker already present in U (anaphora) or

          introduce a new marker, and these were the problems that Kamp
          1981 addressed.
               The main problem for anaphora is that theories of sentential
          syntax do not provide for intersentential anaphora.  DRT solves

          that problem by creating a unified representation for the
          discourse, so that all markers in the discourse are available for
          anaphoric relations (with exceptions to be treated shortly). 
          Conflict resolution is not treated beyond the recency heuristic;

          this is not a weakness particular to DRT, for a full treatment of

          







                                                                          4

          pronominal anaphora must take into consideration grammar,
          pragmatics, and knowledge of the real world.  Definite noun
          phrases perform as do personal pronouns but, since they carry
          more content, are less likely to introduce conflict.  (Definite

          NPs used generically are not considered.)
               Proper nouns and indefinite NPs introduce new reference
          markers into U.  Although this procedure corresponds to the
          "first glance" view of natural language, it encounters problems

          in sentences that involve negation, disjunction, or conditions:

          (3)       Pedro does not own a donkey.
          (4)       Pedro owns a donkey or a cow.

          (5)       If Pedro owns a donkey he beats it.

          One certainly would not want to add a reference marker for
          'donkey' in (3); the semantics would require that it map to an

          entity in the model, and the sentence explicitly denies its
          existence.  The same holds for the donkey in (4), since it has
          perhaps a 50-50 chance of existing (although it might be useful
          to add a marker for the thing that Pedro owns).  Sentence (5) is

          the so-called "donkey sentence"; it not only introduces a donkey
          that may or may not exist, but goes on to make anaphoric
          reference to it.
               DRT handles sentences of the above types by adding to C one

          or more sub-DRSs.  Each sub-DRS has its own universe, which is
          not visible to the superordinate DRS, and its own condition set,
          and the truth value of the sub-DRS is determined by the logical
          connective that controls it.

















          







                                                                          5





          (3')      K:<U:{R1}
                       C:{Pedro(R1), ªK',
                          K':<U:{R2}, C:{own(R1, R2), donkey(R2)}> }>
          (4')      K:<U:{R1}

                       C:{Pedro(R1), K' or K'',
                          K':<U:{R2}, C:{own(R1, R2), donkey(R2)}>
                          K'':<U:{R3}, C:{own(R1, R3), cow(R3)}> }>
          (5')      K:<U:{R1}

                       C:{Pedro(R1), K' -> K'',
                          K':<U:{R2}, C:{own(R1, R2), donkey(R2)}>
                          K'':<C:{beat(R1, R2)}> }>


          Thus, (3) is true if there is no entity in the model that
          satisfies its universe and conditions, (4) is true if there is a
          successful mapping from one of its sub-DRSs to the model, and (5)
          is true if any mapping that satisfies the antecedent DRS also

          satisfies the consequent DRS.
               Sentences (4) and (5) introduce an additional problem; each
          could be followed by a sentence such as (6):


          (6)  It is unhappy.

          The pair (5-6) is handled by including (6) in the consequent DRS
          for (5).  The other pair, (4-6), seems to be overlooked by

          theorists, but it can be handled, as was suggested above, by
          adding to the main DRS a marker for the thing that Pedro owns and
          including only the properties -- donkey or cow -- in the sub-
          DRSs.

               Universal propositions have the same DRS form as
          conditionals.  The scope of a universally quantified term
          relative to an existentially quantified term is indicated by the
          U in which the existentially quantified term is placed.  Thus,

          the usual interpretation of (7) is represented by (7a), while the
          interpretation that places 'donkey' outside the scope of 'farmer'
          is shown in (7b):


          (7)       Every farmer owns a donkey.

          







                                                                          6

          (7a)      K:<C:{K' -> K'',
                          K':<U:{R1}, C:{farmer(R1)}>
                          K'':<U:{R2}, C:{own(R1, R2), donkey(R2)}> }>
          (7b)      K:<U:{R2}, 

                    C:{donkey(R2), K' -> K'',
                          K':<U:{R1}, C:{farmer(R1)}>
                          K'':<C:{own(R1, R2)}> }>


               DRT, as described so far, does a very good job of handling a
          very small subset of English sentences.  Kamp and others have
          offered a number of extensions to the basic theory in order to
          expand that subset.


          2.   Extensions to the Basic Theory

               The basic theory is confined to a very limited subset of

          natural language.  In particular, it is limited to singular, non-
          generic NPs, to anaphoric reference (i.e. the referent is present
          in the discourse), and to sentences whose main verbs do not take
          propositions (i.e. DRSs) as arguments.  Researchers have offered

          extensions to the basic theory that reduce the second and third
          of those limitations.
               Kamp 1983 and Pinkal 1986 have offered refinements to the
          reference-resolving algorithm for definite NPs that extend the

          power and accuracy of that algorithm.  Kamp distinguishes four
          kinds of definite noun phrases (Pinkal: 369):

          (8a)      Personal and possessive pronouns

          ( b)      Complex demonstratives.  (Demonstrative + NP; NP may
                    include a restrictive relative clause.)
          ( c)      Definite descriptions. ('the' + NP; NP may include a
                    relative clause.)

          ( d)      Functional definite descriptions. ('the' + NP +
                    prepositional phrase, the latter limiting the set from
                    which NP selects.)


          Complex demonstratives differ from definite descriptions in that
          the latter presuppose a unique referent while the former
          presuppose a contrast between two or more possible referents. 
          Resolution of referential expressions requires the following


          







                                                                          7





          (Pinkal: 370):

          (9a)      The DRS K.
          ( b)      A salience ranking of the markers in UK. (Including

                    recency of reference.)
          ( c)      A selection set of UK whose members are available as
                    antecedents.
          ( d)      The universe of the real world needed for deictic

                    reference.

          Pinkal argues that definite descriptions are not limited to the
          selection set and that there is no motivation for the distinction

          between anaphora and exophora (where the referent is not present
          in the discourse; it is either physically present--deixis--or
          present in shared knowledge).
               Guenthner et al. 1986 extend the basic theory by adding two

          new types of discourse markers: event markers and time markers. 
          They include meaning rules in the DRS construction algorithm that
          assign each verb and each noun that refers to an action (e.g.
          'accident') to an event marker.  Each time reference (i.e. time

          of day or extent of duration) is assigned to a time marker. 
          Events are temporally ordered with respect to each other and to
          time references: an event may precede or overlap another event or
          time, it may be given a time argument expressing its duration,

          and it may be a subset of another event.  The addition of event
          markers makes it possible for predicates to take DRSs as
          arguments. Guenthner et al. do not include any examples of such a
          use of event markers, but Guenthner 1987 does.  In that article

          he also makes a notational distinction between events, which
          advance the time of the discourse, and situations or static
          verbs, which do not.
               Spencer-Smith 1987 does not use event markers, but adds a

          different type of discourse marker, a proposition marker.  This
          extension makes it possible to include embedded predicates, such
          as infinitival complements and beliefs:


          (10)      Mary wants to marry a rich man.

          







                                                                          8

                    K:<U:{R1, P1},
                       C:{Mary(R1), want(R1, P1),
                         P1:<U:{R2},
                             C:{rich(R2),

                                man(R2),
                                marry(R1, R2)}> }>

               The representation of beliefs, which is explored more fully

          in Kamp 1985, requires two further additions to DRT: internal and
          external anchors.  Anchors are used to associate discourse
          markers to entities in the world.  External anchors are ordered
          pairs, <Marker, Entity>, that associate the two as they actually

          are, while internal anchors are DRS-like structures that
          associate items as the speaker believes they are.  The use of
          anchors makes it possible to represent propositions that are in
          fact contradictory but are not so in the speaker's belief system

          because his internal anchors differ from the external anchors:

          (11)      John believes that Hesperus is pretty and Phosphorus is
                    not pretty.

                    External anchors: <R1, John>, <R2, Venus>, <R3, Venus>
                    Internal anchors: 
                         K:<U:{R2, R3},
                            C:{evening_star(R2),

                               morning_star(R3)}>
                    K:<U:{R1, P1},
                       C:{John(R1),
                          believes(R1, P1),

                          P1:<U:{R2, R3},
                              C:{pretty(R2),
                                 ªK',
                                 K':<C:{pretty(R3)}> }> }>


               These extensions to DRT give it considerable power, but are
          far from giving it the power necessary to represent adequately
          the full range of meanings available in natural language.  In the

          next section we attempt to apply DRT to a selection of natural
          language in order to discover further extensions that will be
          necessary if DRT is to become an adequate theory for the
          representation of natural language.


          







                                                                          9





          3.   Application of DRT

               The passage to be analyzed here was treated extensively in
          Smith 1977 in order to determine the types of information that

          must be added to the text in order to obtain a complete
          representation of the situation reported by the text.  The text
          is a narrative passage that has been normed at sixth-grade
          readability (ETS 1969).  It is particularly interesting because

          it forces the reader to treat certain items as if they were in
          K0.
               In order to represent this passage, it is necessary to
          postulate ad hoc extensions to DRT.  Although these extensions

          work for this passage, they should be regarded as suggestions
          only and not as fully developed extensions; some will reveal
          their weaknesses as the representation is developed.
               The DRS K for the passage will be developed incrementally,

          the DRS for each portion being added to the existing DRS.  The
          clean-up of redundant discourse markers, however, is assumed to
          take place before the DRSs are combined.  Additional symbols will
          be explained as they are introduced.  As before, discourse

          sentences will be presented in the company of the DRSs that they
          add to K; since these sentences, unlike those in previous
          examples, have a cumulative effect, they will be denoted with the
          prefix N.

               In order to treat reference adequately, the items shown
          below must be included in DRS K0.  These items are, in effect,
          imposed on the reader as possible referents.  The marker Now
          indicates the time of reading.

           











          







                                                                         10

          (N0)      K:<U0:{R1, R2, Now, R10, R15},
                       C0:{}>

          (N1a)     The cave widened out as he went

                    U := U0 + {E1, E2}
                    C := C0 + {cave(R1),
                               E1:widen_out(R1),
                               E2:go(R2),

                               E2 o E1,
                               E2 << Now }

               The symbol o indicates that E2 overlaps E1; << indicates

          that E2 (and therefore E1) precedes the time of reading. 
          'widened out' is treated as a unit verb; the 'out' is actually
          redundant.  Since 'the cave' is definite, its referent must exist
          prior to (N1); for this reason R1 is included in U0, and the same

          is true of 'he' and R2.

          (N1b)     and the bottom seemed to drop away little by little
                    U := U + {R3, E3, P1}

                    C := C + {bottom(R3),
                              part-of(R3, R1),
                              E3:seem(P1),
                              P1:<U:{E4},

                                  C:{E4:drop_away(R3),
                                     little_by_little(E4)
                                     E4 =< E3}>
                              E2 o E3}


               R3, 'the bottom,' has no apparent antecedent and might have
          been included in U0.  It seems more likely, however, that it
          existed implicitly and that a meaning rule (such as 'Every

          physical object has a bottom') resolves the reference.  E3 is
          true if P1 seems to be true, even if P1 is actually false.  Since
          E4 is controlled by 'seem,' it is a subset ( =< ) of E3.  (I am
          not sure that this is what Guenthner et al. mean by subset, since

          they offer no examples, but it works here.)





          







                                                                         11





          (N1c)     and then, with no warning, it split in two directions,
                    U := U + {E5, Set1}
                    C := C + {ªK1c
                              K1c:<U:{R4},

                                   C:{warning(R4)}>
                              E5:split_in(R1, Set1),
                              E3 << E5,
                              direction(Set1)}


               Since there is no warning, R4 is not visible to the top-
          level K.  'directions' introduces what is perhaps the major
          weakness in current versions of DRT, a means of representing

          plural nouns.  The ad hoc solution offered here is to use set
          markers, following a suggestion in Guenthner et al.  The
          proposition direction(Set1) is a notational shorthand for a
          complex sub-DRS representing "All members of Set1 are

          directions."

          (N1d)     one path leading straight ahead and one off to the
                    left.
                    U := U + {E6, R5, R6, E7, R7, R8}

                    C := C + {path(R5),
                              E6:lead(R5, R6),
                              R6 <- Set1,
                              straight_ahead(R6),

                              E6 =< E5,
                              path(R7),
                              E7:lead(R7, R8),
                              R8 <- Set1,

                              to_the_left(R8)
                              E7 =< E5}

               The cohesion of R5 and R7 with R1 is indicated by the fact

          that R6 and R8 are members of ( <- ) Set1.

          (N2)      "If I were an opening to this cave, where would I be?"
                    he asked himself.

                    U := U + {E8, P2, R9}
                    C := C + {E8:ask(R2, R2, P2)
                              P2:K2a -> K2b,
                              K2a:<U:{R9}

                                   C:{opening(R9),
                                      part-of(R9, R1),
                                      R2 = R9,
                                      R2 \= R9}>

                              K2b:<C:{location(R2, ?)}>
                              E7 << E8 }

               (N2) is, on the one hand, almost ridiculous; its only

          contribution to the understanding of the passage is the knowledge
          that 'he' is lost (Smith 1977), but that knowledge is no more
          explicit in the DRS than it is in the sentence itself.  On the
          other hand, it is a major headache for DRT.  (N2) is an embedded

          contra-factual conditional whose antecedent is impossible and
          whose consequent is a rhetorical question (indicated by the ? as
          an argument to location).  Its embeddedness, in this case, is
          wrong, in the sense that it is not a matter of 'his' belief, but


          







                                                                         13





          in another situation it might be.  The implication itself is
          worthless, but another implication might not be.  The conclusion
          that R9 is not R2 (indicated by \= ) is obvious but might be
          useful in another contrafactual.  The whole DRS must be added to

          K so that the reader can infer, by conversational implicature,
          that 'he' does not know the answer to the rhetorical question and
          that, since he does not know the answer, he is lost.


          (N3)      Luke wasn't frightened.
                    U := U + {Sit1}

                              Sit1 o E8}

               (N3) introduces a situation (more accurately, a non-

          situation) whose duration is vague but which at least overlaps
          E8.

          (N4a)     Oh, he knew there were such things in this world as

                    bottomless caves,
                    U := U + {Sit2, P3}
                    C := C + {Sit2:know(R2, P3),
                              Sit2 o Sit1,

               P3 is like an external anchor, in that it is a fact about
          the world, but Kamp 1985 does not allow for propositions as

          external anchors.  It could be treated as an internal anchor, but
          it is explicit in the discourse.  Both Sit2 and Sit3 are true
          throughout the discourse, so they are irrelevant as temporal
          markers, but either might have changed during the discourse and

          the representation must allow for that possibility.

               This is a continuation of the sub-DRS begun in (N4a); it is
          interpreted as a universal: 'No person who falls in such a cave
          is ever heard of again.'  Since this universal is embedded in a

          belief, it does not matter whether such persons exist or not; if
          it were not, it would be necessary to replace R11 with a set of
          at least two members.


          (N4c)     but if there had been any such thing around the cottage
                    he would have heard about it.
                    U := U + {Set2}
                    C := C + {K4c -> K4d,

                              cottage(R15),
                              K4c:<U:{R14, Sit4},
                                   C:{R14 <- Set2,
                                      Sit4:exist_around(R14, R15),

                                      ªexist_around(R14, R15)}>
                              K4d:<U:{E11},

                                      E11 << E1}> }


               It is not clear whether (N4c) should be treated as a
          continuation of the belief initiated in (N4a), as a different
          belief, or as a top-level condition.  Viewed objectively, it is a

          belief (and an illogical one at that), yet it does not seem to be
          syntactically embedded in 'know,' or any other verb of belief. 
          If it is a different belief, or a top-level condition (as it is
          treated here), Set2 must be promoted from P3 to the top-level so

          that it can be visible to other sub-DRSs.  R15 must be added to
          K0; it is a definite description whose referent cannot be deduced
          in the way 'bottom' can be deduced as 'part-of' a cave.  As with
          K2a, it would seem reasonable to elevate the negation of the

          antecedent of a contrafactual to the top-level, but in that case
          R14 would not be accessible (it would exist in a subordinate
          universe).  Since Sit4 is a general proposition, no temporal
          relation is assigned; the same is true of Sit5, Sit6, and Sit7

          below.

          (N5a)     This was just a plain, ordinary cave--deeper than most,
                    but that was all--

                    U := U + {Sit5, Sit6, Set4}
                    C := C + {Sit5:plain_cave(R1),
                              Sit6:ordinary_cave(R1),
                              just(Sit5),

                              just(Sit6),
                              cave(Set4),
                              ªK5,
                              K5:<U:{Set5, R16},

                                  C:{Set5 =< Set4,
                                     cardinality(Set5) >
                                        cardinality(Set4)/2,
                                     R16 <- Set5,

                                     R1 <-\- Set5,
                                     deeper_than(R16, R1)}> }

               From a logical point of view, most of (N5a) is redundant;

          the only useful part is 'deeper than most,' and that belief lacks
          credibility.  Nevertheless, it poses several problems: handling
          the adjective-common noun combination, handling 'just,' and
          accounting for 'most' in a manner suitable for logic.  The

          adjectives 'plain' and 'ordinary' (unlike 'red,' e.g.) have
          little meaning until applied to a particular domain-- caves, in
          this case.  The adverb 'just' means something like 'not other
          than' in this case, but how is that meaning determined?  It does

          not seem to be a syntactic matter, but a DRS is composed from a

          







                                                                         16

          syntactic parse.  K5 is an attempt to handle 'most'; the symbols
          < and / have their usual mathematical meanings; <-\- indicates
          'not a member of.'


          (N5b)     and some place there had to be an opening to it.
                    U := U + {R17, R18, Sit7, P4}
                    C := C + {place(R17),
                              opening(R18),

                              part-of(R18, R1),
                              Sit7:necessary(P4),
                              P4:<C:{located(R18, R17)}> }


          The truth of (N5b) is doubtful, but given its truth, R17 and R18
          must exist at the top-level.  It is possible that R18 is
          identical to R9, now raised to top-level.  Sit7 suggests one way
          to handle modal auxiliaries.


          (N6)      There was, though, one big difference about this cave:
                    it was Luke's.
                    U := U + {Sit8, Sit9}

                    C := C + {Sit8:difference(R1, Set5, Sit9),
                              Sit9:own(R2, R1),
                              Sit8 o E1,
                              Sit9 o Sit8}


               The noun 'difference' entails two things that are different
          (this cave and other caves) and the thing that distinguishes them
          (Sit9).  However, only Sit9 is syntactically specified.

















          







                                                                         17






          (N7)      He had found it and it was his own secret place.
                    U := U + {E12, Sit10, R19}
                    C := C + {E12:find(R2, R1),

                              E12 << E1,
                              secret_place(R19),
                              R19 = R1,
                              Sit10:own(R2, R19)

                              E12 << Sit10}

               The representation of (N7) is straight-forward; R19 is R1,
          but to replace it by R1 in Sit10 is to make Sit10 a copy of Sit9.

               This application of DRT has pointed out several needed
          extensions to the theory.  One of the most obvious is the means
          of representing plural NPs, including those with quantifiers that
          are less specific than 'all' but more specific than 'some' (e.g.

          'most').  Another needed extension is a means of handling terms
          that modify conditions: verbs that take verbals as complements
          (modals and verbs such as 'seem') and adjectives whose meanings
          depend on the particular nouns that they modify.  A third

          extension is a formalism for specifying arguments that
          are not syntactically indicated (such as those for 'difference'). 
          Whether or not the second and third extensions are feasible
          without appealing to semantic analysis prior to constructing the

          DRS remains to be seen; perhaps the needed machinery is available
          in the lexicon.

          Conclusion


               DRT has been successful in representing a small subset of
          natural language, and is being extended to increase the size of
          that subset.  As we have seen in Part 3 of this report, other

          extensions will be necessary before it can handle the full range
          of natural language expressions.   If those extensions can be
          accomplished without appeal to semantics, DRT will prove to be
          quite powerful.  However, DRT is intended to provide a bridge

          between syntactic parses and model theoretic semantics; if

          







                                                                         18

          semantic analysis is necessary before a DRS can be constructed,
          the purpose of DRT has been lost, or at least seriously modified.
