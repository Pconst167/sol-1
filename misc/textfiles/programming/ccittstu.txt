   You will be given an entry followed
by 4 pieces of information on that en-
try.  The titles for those 4 pieces of
information are: Direction, CCITT #3
(1VF), CCITT #4 (2VF), and CCITT #5 (2
VF).  The individual pieces of infor-
mation will be, for the most part, ab-
breviated to the use of symbols, the
symbols table will follow the entries
at the end of this section.

X = 2280+OR-6HZ,120+OR-30MS

XX = 2280+OR-6HZ,600+OR-120MS

S=100+OR-20MS SILENCE

<-- OR --> = DIRECTION

Those were for CCITT #3 (1VF) (Second
item after each signal)

X = 2040+OR-6HZ,100+OR-20MS

Y = 2400+OR-6HZ,100+OR-20MS

XX = 350+OR-70MS

YY = 350+OR-70MS

S = 35+OR-7MS;x:2040HZ,35MS

P = (2040HZ,2400HZ),150+30MS

Those were for CCITT #4 (2VF)

X = 2400+OR-6HZ

Y = 2600+OR-6HZ

Those were for CCITT #5 (2VF)

N/A = Not Applicable
