The number of hard disks on a PC-XT can be found with: PEEK(1141).

In determining the status of a drive motor:
"PEEK(1087) AND 128" = 128 when a drive is being written to.
"PEEK(1087) AND 15" = 0 when no drive being written to.
If drive L is running, then "PEEK(1087) AND 2 ^ (ASC ("L")-65)" will be 1.
Drive L here is A, B, C or D, and the letter must be typed in uppercase.
These value are not affected if an OUT was used to turn on the motor.
To turn on drive L for n seconds, where n is at most 14:
POKE 1088,18.2*n:OUT 1010,2^(ASC("L")-61)+ASC("L")-53.
Location 1088 holds the countdown, in clock ticks, until the motor is shut off.
To turn off all drives, send:  OUT 1010,12
To determine the diskette track that was last accessed, use PEEK(1093).
To determine which diskette head (0 or 1) was last accessed, use PEEK(1094).
To determine which diskette sector was last accessed, use PEEK(1095).
The number of bytes per sector on a diskette is given by 128*2^PEEK(1096).

The diskette parameter table consists of 11 bytes.  To explore this:
 LET D = PEEK(120)+256*PEEK(121).
 Then, after executing: DEF SEG = PEEK(122)+256*PEEK(123)
 you can derive the following table:
(PEEK(D) AND 240)\8     is the time (in milliseconds) required for the
                          diskette drive to move from track to track
(PEEK(D) AND 15)*32     is the head unload time (in milliseconds) after
                          a read or write operation has occurred
(PEEK(D+1) AND 240)\4   is the head load time (in milliseconds)
PEEK(D+1) AND 15        is the Direct Memory Access mode
PEEK(D+2)               is the wait time until turning the motor off
PEEK(D+3)               is the number of bytes per sector on the disk;
                          a value of v specifies 128*2^v bytes per
                          sector, for v=0 to 3
PEEK(D+4)               is the number of sectors per track, usually
                          8 or 9
PEEK(D+5)               is the gap length (in bytes) between sectors
PEEK(D+6)               is the data length that you read out or write
                          into a sector when the sector length is not
                          specified
PEEK(D+7)               is the gap length used when formatting
PEEK(D+8)               is the value the format operation uses to
                          initialize diskette sectors, usually 256
PEEK(D+9)               is the number of milliseconds allowed for the
                          heads to stabilize
PEEK(D+10)              is the number of eighths of a second to allow
                          for motor startup

Changing the values of PEEK(D+3) and PEEK(D+4) can modify the way that
diskettes are read and might require you to format your diskettes
manually.

If a single diskette drive is used for both drives A: and B:, its current roles
is:  CHR$(65 + PEEK(1284))

                        RS-232 INTERFACE

The number of RS-232 cards attached can be found with: (PEEK(1041) AND 14)/2
To determine the first of the seven ports associated with COMn:
PEEK(1022+2*n)+256*PEEK(1023+2*n).
If this number is 0, then COMn is not available.
To swap two RS-232 interfaces, interchange their initial port numbers.
Denote the initial port associated with COMn by Pn.
Normally, the value of P1 is 1016 and the value of P2 is 760.

Interrupt enabling:
OUT Pn+1,1   enables an interrupt when a character has been received
OUT Pn+1,2   enables an interrupt when a character has been transmitted
OUT Pn+1,4   enables an interrupt when an error has occurred
OUT Pn+1,8   enables an interrupt when the modem status has changed

To enable several of the above interrupts at the same time, OUT the
sum of the associated numbers to port Pn+1.

To identify interrupts, use the port number determined above (Pn) and:
  LET X = INP(Pn+2).  "X AND 1" has a value of 1 as long as no
interrupts have been issued because of communications port activity.
Similarly, "X AND 6" is used to identify the highest priority interrupt
pending, as indicated in the table "Interrupt Control Functions" in the
IBM Technical Reference manual.

To establish the number of data bits (d), the number of stop bits (s),
and the parity (p=0 for no parity, p=1 for odd parity, p=3 for even parity),
send:  OUT Pn+3, d-5 + 4*(s-1) + 8 * p.

To establish the baud rate:  H=INP(Pn+3):OUT Pn+3,H OR 128:
 OUT Pn,DL:OUT Pn+1,DH:OUT Pn+3,H.  Use values DL=128 and DH=1 for 300
baud, and DL=96 and DH=0 for baud rate 1200.  Otherwise, DL=d MOD 256
and DH=d\256, where d is the divisor number given by the IBM Technical
Reference manual in the table "Baud Rate at 1.853 MHz."

 To produce a break signal:
X=INP(Pn+3):OUT Pn+3,X OR 64:PLAY "MF":SOUND 32767,6:SOUND 32767,1:OUT Pn+3,X.
The PLAY and SOUND statements produce a delay of 1/3 second.

 To control the modem, use:
OUT Pn+4,1     to assert that the data terminal is ready (DTR)
OUT Pn+4,2     to raise a request to send (RTS)
OUT Pn+4,16    to perform loopback testing

To accomplish several of the above tasks simultaneously, OUT the sum of the
associated numbers to port Pn+4.

To determine the status of data transfer, begin with:
LET X = INP(Pn+5).  Now:

X AND 64    has a value of 64 if the transmitter shift register is idle
X AND 32    is 32 if the transmitter holding register is ready to
              accept a character for transmission
X AND 16    has the value 16 if the received data input is held in the
              spacing state too long (that is, if a break was received)
X AND 8     has the value 8 if the received character did not have a
              valid stop bit; that is, if a framing error occurred
X AND 4     has the value 4 if the received character does not have
              the correct parity
X AND 2     is 2 if the received data destroyed the previous character
              (an overrun error)
X AND 1     has value 1 if a character is ready to be read from the
              received buffer register

 INP(Pn) will read the ASCII value of a character from the serial port,
provided:  (INP(Pn+5) AND 1) = 1

 You can use OUT Pn,m to write the character with ASCII value m to the serial
port, provided that:  (INP(Pn+5) AND 32) = 32

 To determine the status of the modem, use:  X = INP(Pn+6). Then:
X AND 128    has the value 128 if a Carrier signal has been detected
X AND 64     is 64 if the modem is ringing
X AND 32     has a value of 32 if the modem has asserted Data Set Ready
X AND 16     is 16 if the modem has asserted Clear to Send
X AND 8      is 8 if the Carrier Detect has changed state
X AND 4      has the value 4 if the Ring Indicator input has changed
               from On to Off
X AND 2      is 2 if the Data Set Ready input has changed state since
               the last time it was read
X AND 1      has a value of 1 if the Clear to Send input has changed
               state since it was last read

                             SPEAKER
     To turn the speaker on, use:  OUT 97,INP(97) OR 3
     Conversely, to turn the speaker off:  OUT 97,INP(97) AND 252
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      CASETTE PORT CONTROL
     To turn the cassette motor on:  OUT 97,INP(97) AND 247
     To turn the cassette motor off:  OUT 97,INP(97) OR 8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          MISCELLANEOUS
(PEEK (1041) AND 16)/16 = number of game adaptors attached.
PEEK(1043) + 256*PEEK(1044) = size of RAM in KB.
PEEK(1132)+256*PEEK(1133)+65536PEEK(1134)= number of ticks since midnight.
With 18.2 ticks per second up to 1,533,039.
Memory locations 1264 to 1279 are not used by either DOS or BASIC.
Data can be passed from one program to another by POKEing and PEEKING.
To exit BASIC and complicate reinvoking it, you can:  POKE 1295,2:SYSTEM.
Memory location 1295 is set to 2 when the BASIC command SHELL is executed.
The segment number of BASIC's data segment may be found with:
PEEK(1296)+256*PEEK(1297)
