This is AmyNews 3.
New releases always from the start.
Amiga development continues as never befor.
These are only a fraction of what developers are developing for the Amiga
platform.

- Terra Nova Development announces the availability of Magic Lantern 
  v2.0, the critically acclaimed 24 bit animation package for the Amiga.
  Magic Lantern version 2.0 allows users to create, edit and display 
  delta compressed animations in up to 24 bit color on all the popular
  true color display cards for the Amiga, as well as all the native 
  Amiga modes (including AGA). It will also play sound effects in either
  mono or stereo though the Amiga sound chip during animation play back.
  New features include virtual memory support; now animations can be as
  large as your hard disk, and Magic Lantern will still be able to edit
  and display them.  Double Time compression technology can double
  animation speed and reduce animation sizes by half.
  Another new compression technology has been added that can speed up
  some animations (especially those in 16 and 24 bit) by up to 25%, and
  reduce animation sizes by up to 20%.  Rebuilding animations has been
  optimized, and for large animations can be 75% faster.
  Direct support for the Retina Z3 has been added, resulting in
  animations that are up to 50% faster and 40% smaller for that card.
  Magic Lantern 2.0 still contains all the features of previous
  versions, including sound synchronization, enforcement of frame
  rates, full ARexx support, animation disassembly, palette changes and
  more.

- Sound/Noise tracker compatible module player for the Amiga, the D.A.S.

  including TFMX Pro, TFMX 7V and C64 SID modules.

- Powerful spreadsheet for the Amiga, TurboCalc, will jump directly from
  version 2.1 to 3.0. Lots of improvments are promissed. The goal is to
  make it equal or better than microsoft excel. TurboCalc supports SYLK
  format and in it's current version it's much like Excel. If you are
  familiar with Excel then you are familiar with TurboCalc too.

  software. It uses 72 pin SIMMs (up to 8 megs via two SIMMs), and will
  retail for ~$299 w/0k RAM.  With video speed equal to the PowerMAC's 
  PDS video board, it is fast. 640x480x32 bit animations in realtime 
  by just moving the data to the board. Up to 80 megapixels per second,
  and the blitter can move entire offscreen bit maps into the viewing 
  area without any glitches in the display. It's also very fasstttt.

  softwares like our "Bars & Pipes professional" are constructed for the
  Amiga first. Then we port our softwares to other platforms. The 
  multitasking nature of the Amiga, makes this computer number 1 source
  for the music and midi. We did a lot of improvments to the Track 
  Window Menu, Edit Window, Song Construction Window, Metronome, 
  printing, Tool and Accessories sections in the version 2.5 of the 
  "Bars & Pipes professional" but the development continues and we are
