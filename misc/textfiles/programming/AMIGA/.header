<H1>Programming Textfiles: The Amiga</H1>
<P>
It was hard for me not to go completely over the top for the Commodore Amiga
when I became aware of it in 1985. Here was a machine incredible graphics,
stunning sound, amazing games, and a general sense that the thing could do
most anything. I wasn't the only one; Amigas are still in use to this day for
professional graphics work and video editing. But at the time, it just
changed everything. Here's some files discussing the minutae of being a 
programmer on the Amiga.
