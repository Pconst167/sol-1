     'Lo again,

     We are very proud to bring you our current issue of Phirst Amendment!
Once again, we will try to broaden your mind and show you many new things.
This is an open forum periodical.  Although most issues will have a general
topic, I will still be informing you of certain things I feel are important.
I will also keep supplying you with my regular columns [Now marked with an
'*' - Thanks Electroman!]  and try to work in a few new ones later.

     As you have probably noticed, we are changing the format slightly.
This is, mostly, based on the comments and suggestions from you, our
readers.  Also, we can definitely find a use for ANY articles submitted.
We have a wide variety of things planned for all of 1993 and quite a bit of
1994.  [see the Addendum] I'm sure you will enjoy them.

     I really enjoy writing these articles, but I am not skilled in every
area in which you are probably interested.  If someone requests an article,
and I neither know anything about it nor can find enough information about
it, this is where I will request it.  Maybe someone else can do it justice.

     January is going to be a very nice issue from the looks of things.  I,
also, plan to step up the pace of my articles.  I'm sure some of you will
appreciate that.

     Enjoy the issue, and stay free in '93!
                                              - Anesthesia -

     Well, here we are.  We've made it this far with this fine, electronic
publication.  Support has been amazing.  I hope that we can continue to keep
this thing going for F81 issues.  It is my intention to constantly provide
you with the best data and scandals that our government can (willingly or
unwillingly) provide.  I support everyone's right to show their disapproval
of any portion of our newsletter and, especially, of our government.  I will
be more than happy to include any editorials on anything.

     Our first intention was to write mainly about AIDS and the genre of
government sponsored diseases and other methods of governmental genocide.
But when the dust settled, quite a few related topics were uncovered.  This
issue has transmogrified into a commentary on racism, sexism, homophobia,
et al.  I feel that this issue compares quite favorably to our previous.
I think you'll appreciate the effects which these turns of events have
created.

	We have added a new member to our ranks:  Sir Galahad (916)  His
current role is that of editor, researcher, and disseminator.  I will be
handing over the Poet's Corner, and Gnus Around Town to him, so that I may
have additional time to research future articles and conduct field
response/public relations.  In a short time, he will be writing articles
of his own, like the madman we all know him to be.  (Inside joke:  He's
actually kinda reserved...)

     The feedback is tremendous.  We will be reviewing and replying publicly
to feedback in a new section at the end of the mag.  Feel free to send
editorial responses to ANY part of the 'zine you feel necessary.  We can't
respond to everything... but we'll publish a sampling of the responses we
get.  If you wish to use a handle, fine... If you wish to remain compleatly
anonymous, that's fine, too...  Don't be afraid to be heard!

How'd I get involved?   You asked me to! (chuckle)

<SG>
     Governments have always existed "to protect their people, and to act
in their people's best interests".  Initially, I thought that was true of
our government.

     However, as I have grown up (living in a small, sheltered town) and
travelled a little, I experienced different thoughts.  The most important
thing I did was... LISTEN.  I listened to what people said about their
homes, their childrens' future, their retirement, the environment, et. al.
These things, the experiences and thoughts of others, helped me form my
views.  Not that I'm easily persuaded by anyone, but I had many of the same
thoughts.  My most important thought, however, is this:  EVERYONE HAS A
RIGHT TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY WANT, AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY OR DO WHAT
THEY CHOOSE WITHOUT PERSECUTION OR FEAR OF RETRIBUTION.  To me, that is what
Phirst Amendment is all about,.  a system where people can express their
(FACT-SUPPORTED) views.  This is why, when Daiv asked me to join, I eagerly
accepted.  I have read many of the responses to the first issue.  Those that
responded seemed very pleased with the work that KAoS has done.  One
important note on this:  the more feedback and articles we receive, the more
productive we will be.  So write!!  Be writing to you soon-


                    Your Knight,

Well, he seems noble enough (heh heh), I think we'll be seeing a lot of good
things from him...  (hopefully soon! :> )

                       !!!!!! Safety With Chemicals !!!!!!
                          by Anesthesia, (our protector)

     Something that really bothers me is listening to someone that plays
with chemicals and doesn't have a clue as to what they are doing.  I've been
flashed several times myself as well as burned my hair several times.
Chemicals are dangerous things if you don't know what they do! [Even if you
do - they still are! - Daiv]  I would like to offer some help for those who
wish to experiment but are unsure of their ability or don't know where to
start.

     Since most people reading this text file also read other text files,
that makes me think this is where they would like to learn these things.
Always remember that anyone can put one of these out, and just because
someone puts out a file, does NOT mean they know what they are doing.
Your library is your best friend in this case!  Before trying any
experiment, research the items involved to assure that the people involved
didn't leave anything out. (i.e., the fact that mixing the dry, red
phosphorous, dry sulphur, and dry potassium chlorate will cause it to
immediately explode,  but when moist, it is safe to mix.)

     For those of you lucky enough to still be in high school, take a
chemistry class.  (This goes for those interested parties in college as
well!) [Lotta exclams there, Anesthesia - Daiv]  You will enjoy it and
something you learn there may just save you life and/or limbs later.  I've
also found it's one of the best ways to obtain some hard to find
ingredients.

     Always be sure to read the instructions completely and assure you
have the correct items on hand to complete the project in one shot.   Some
recipes won't wait for you to find the appropriate items.   Also, never
substitute something 'close' in a project unless it is specifically listed
as a substitute.

     [A guy I know, Felo De Se (FDS), once used a smoke bomb recipe and
ended up torching his face and kitchen, because he used ground rocket cells
in place of potassium nitrate (aka saltpeter). - Daiv]

     There are ten important rules for chemistry safety that should always
be followed.  These are:


	1.  Never store chemicals for extended periods.
	2.  Never store chemical combinations for any length of time.
	3.  Work in a cool, well-ventilated area.
	4.  Keep sources of heat and electricity away from the work area.
	5.  Keep the number of people in the work area to a minimum.
	6.  Keep materials far apart.
	7.  Use a respirator while working.
	8.  Wear safety goggles.
	9.  Wear as much protective, rubber clothing as possible.
	10. Have appropriate fire-fighting equipment available and large
	    volumes of water.

     One of the things that I am trying to do with my 'Chemical of the
Month' is  share a few common chemicals at first, then, later, some of their
uses.  In my opinion, it is better to have some knowledge about what you are
working with before you begin working.

                        By: Dead Kennedys

We got a drug - We're gonna try it out on you.
Won't make you die - It'll getcha just a little bit sick.

[Chorus]
Got a head cold,  Got a chest cold,  And it's three days old
(goin' on forever)
Make you hazy, Make you lazy, Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days and years.

Barely got the time now - To stay on the job.
Double up the dosage in your water supply.
Make you even sicker 'til you're slippin' away.

Getting all depressed - It's getting all your friends.
You can't get it up - For nothing that'll rock the boat.

The government flu - The government flu - The government flu.

Slip it abroad, Keep a-slowin' down the USSR.
But meanwhile, We'll keep an eye
On what it's doin' to you.

[Chorus]
Got a head cold, Got a chest cold, And it's three days old
(goin' on forever)
Make you hazy, Make you lazy, Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days and years.

The government flu - The government flu - The government flu
Flew - Through - You.

|                     Fluoridation is STILL a Mistake!                     |
|                        Editorial by Frank Murray                         |
|               Editor of Better Nutrition for Today's Living              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     The fluoridation of public water supplies to allegedly prevent dental
caries in children [Who are going to lose their baby teeth anyway! - Daiv]
makes about as much sense as putting aspirin in the water to deter
headaches.  Sodium fluoride has no effect on the teeth of adults, even
though everyone is obliged to drink the souped-up water, whether they like
it or not!

     The flap about fluoridation began in 1945 [commonly mentioned era in
this 'zine, eh??], when the Public Health Service (PHS) decided to do a
double-blind study to convince Americans that fluoridation was one of the
greatest advances of the 20th century.  Newburg, New York was selected to
have its water fluoridated, while the residents of nearby Kingston would
continue to drink pure water.

     The study was supposed to last five years, but halfway though the
project, the PHS abruptly terminated it, claiming that, based upon the
analysis of the Newburg statistics, fluoridation was a tremendous deterrent
to tooth decay in children.  Unbiased researchers later determined that
children in non-fluoridated Kingston had fewer cavities.  But by then the
bandwagon was already in high gear.

     As scientific evidence against fluoridation mounted - it is related to
heart disease, cancer, and allergies, among other things - many countries
have either discontinued fluoridation or never approved it.  These included
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India,
Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.

     Another highly controversial use of fluoride is supposedly to
strengthen the bones of osteoporotic women.  At an international symposium
on osteoporosis in Washington several years ago, researchers were
vociferously pro and con on the subject.  Because the use of fluoride is
still highly suspect, it would make sense to halt it until further studies
can be made.  Unfortunately, this hasn't been the case.

     The latest indictment of this therapy is recapped in the May 25 issue
of 'Science News'.  After analyzing the bone density of more than 800 Iowa
women, ages 20 to 80, MaryFran R. Sowers and her colleagues at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor concluded that women over the age of 55
who drink fluoridated water are MORE prone to fractures.

     Postmenopausal women drinking higher-fluoride water faced more than
double the fracture risk of their counterparts in the comparison community,
the magazine reported.

     Professor Sowers, no doubt, echoed the sentiments of many researchers
in the field who are wary of fluoride use.


In Good Health!

|                           United Colors of Benetton                      |
|                                  by Spike Lee                            |
|                              Transcribed by Daiv                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


     The following text is from an interview, of sorts, with Writer/
Activist Spike Lee.  This interview was released in the form of a Benetton
ad in November's Rolling Stone.

     For almost ten years, United Colors of Benetton has used advertising
imagery to draw a symbolic parallel between the colorful casual apparel we
sell and the many "colors" of our customers all over the world.  Under the
creative direction of photographer Oliviero Toscani and the aegis of company
founder Luciano Benetton, our advertising imagery has evolved over the years
to reflect a broad range of social issues.  Sometimes controversial and
always compelling, these images have never been intended to express a
particular point of view but rather to encourage discussion about such
important subjects as racism, AIDS, war, and the environment.  It is our
hope that though dialogue, greater understanding and positive change will
occur.

     On the occasion of Rolling Stone's twenty-fifth anniversary and for
this unique 'portfolio' of Benetton advertising photography, we sought
another powerful voice in the realm of social commentary.  We could think of
no more qualified individual to break through the static of mainstream media
in the pursuit of change than filmmaker Spike Lee.

[Begin Interview]

      Out of the blue, out of nowhere, I got a telephone call from somebody
at Rolling Stone magazine about Benetton.  I called back, more curious than
ever.  "What's this 'bout?" I asked.  I was told Benetton wanted me to write
something for them that was going to be a supplement in Rolling Stone.  My
first thought was why me?  WHY ME?  Of all the people they coulda asked.
They would make a sizable donation to the charity of my choice.  Well, if
they want me that bad, I'll find time to do it.  After a little haggling
about the amount of the donation, I signed on the dotted line.  Benetton
agreed to donate $50,000 to the United Negro College Fund Malcom X
Scholarship.  That check is going to send some needy, deserving students to
school.  Thank you, Benetton.

     Before I get into this, please allow me to say my views, my thoughts,
my opinions.  They are mine.  I have never attempted to position myself as a
spokesperson for anybody.  To be honest, I'm very uncomfortable with that.
The media has repeatedly tried to designate me that so-called honor, but I'm
not accepting it.  Here it goes, Benetton, hope this will do.
                                            - Spike Lee


     If I were to choose one word for the present state of the world, one
quickly comes to mind.  Fucked!  That's right.  Fucked.  OK, it's a bad
word, but hey buddy, we're living in a bad world.  Things are so bad, people
are seriously considering whether they would want to have children today.
I'm not that pessimistic yet, but it makes you wonder.

     I'm thirty-five now, still young, still single, but I wish to have a
family.  What kind of world will my kids and your kids be living in?  Are we
gonna fuck it up totally for them?  We're all headed in that direction -
pedal to the metal - 150 miles per hour.  My youth was spent playing
softball, stickball, two-hand touch football, everything.  The summers, boy,
do I remember them.  I thought they would never end, no school, no teachers,
no homework.   We didn't have a care in the world.

     Oh, there would be fights sometimes, but the most it turned out to be
was a bloody nose or maybe, just maybe, a black eye, which always turned out
the be a badge of honor.

     Nowadays, Forgetaboutit.  Kids are killing kids.  Kids have real guns
with real bullets that bring real death.  We're not talking GI Joe shit
either.

     I had a 007 James Bond gun, and me and my friends had gun fights, but
it was fake, nobody got crippled, nobody died.  We got up off the street
after we were dead.

     As for drugs in our Cobble Hill neighborhood, we were all terrified of
the glue sniffers.  That's about as far as drugs went.  I can still see Rory
stumbling down Court Street high as a kite, dried glue under his nose and
mouth, his brown paper bag filled with model airplane glue moving in, moving
out.  I heard Rory later died.  Glue has nothing on crack, no comparison.
I never heard about the dreaded glue sniffers ever killing anybody to buy
a tube, or young girls turning tricks for a hit!  That stuff just didn't
happen.  But that was a Brooklyn that only exists in my memories.

     Jobs, drugs, crime, AIDS, racism, education, the homeless, and the
environment.  These are the issues today.  Issues that we will have to take
the initiative on.  Even though this is an election year, does anybody feel
Bush or Clinton will do something concrete to address this stuff that's
gonna directly effect [sic] all of our urban children?  I don't.  That
doesn't mean, however, I'm not gonna vote.  I will.  But you know and I know
what politicians do in the long run.  Nada.  Not jack shit.  As Stevie
Wonder put so eloquently in song, "You Haven't Done Nuthin."

     So what are we gonna do?  What can individuals do to ensure that this
planet doesn't self destruct?  I can only come up with one solution:
everyone get involved.

    And that's where the imagery involved in the Benetton ads stands head
and shoulders above the rest.  Let me first say that I have no illusions
about them.  Benetton wants to make a buck like any other company.  In fact,
we all do but it's the route, the path we choose that makes the difference.
We all know that the quickest way to make a buck in film, music, and
advertising is SEX.  I feel that more often than not this is the "low road."
Oh, you want to sell some jeans, an album, a film.  Get a pretty face with a
pretty body that has pretty breasts, and a pretty butt.  Voila.  That low
road is as jam-packed as the FDR Drive at rush hour.

     The high road is a lot riskier.  Why?  Because it might make people
think.  If it's provocative enough, it might make people sit down and
discuss it, talk about the message.  Talk about the imagery used in the ads.
Of course, this takes more creativity.

     When I first saw the Benetton ads, I had no idea what they were
selling.  This was before a Benetton store was on every other corner in
Manhattan (one day, please, explain that to me).  I had no idea they sold
clothes.  Regardless, it still made an impact on me.  Isn't that what good
ads are about?

     A lot of people will have to do a lot of explaining on AIDS one day.
All of a sudden, a disease appears out of nowhere that nobody has a cure
for, and it's specifically targeted at gays and minorities (i.e., Hispanics
and blacks).  The mystery disease, yeah, about as mysterious as genocide.

     I'm convinced that AIDS is a government engineered disease.  They got
one thing wrong, they never realized that it couldn't just be contained to
the groups it was intended to wipe out.  So, now it's a national priority.
Exactly like drugs became when they escaped the urban centers into white
suburbia.  So you might think I'm crazy about this one.  I don't think so.
Who knows, the day might be fast approaching when you want documented blood
tests from prospective sexual partners.  No papers, no sex.

    That's the kind of world our children might be born into.  What a drag!
Sounds like a bad science-fiction movie!

     Let's all get down on our hands and knees right now and pray to the
highest heavens that it doesn't come to that:


Dear Lord,

     Deliver us from the evils of the world, the evil people in this world.
Please wipe out all diseases, especially AIDS.  Give everybody a job so that
they can make a comfortable living.  NO MO' WARS.  Give us all education,
and the homeless, homes.  Please give us the intelligence to save what's
left of our environment.

     And Lord, if you take care of that, my children and your children can
have those endless summers like we all had.  Let them all be able to run and
play and eat ice cream.  Let them not have to worry about whether they might
get killed by a stray bullet in school trying to get an education.

     Dear Lord, please finally come once and for all deliver us from sexism,
racism, and all the other "ism's".

     Dear Lord, if you can take care of that, I promise we'll take care of
the rest.  One last thing, if you allow me my selfish motives, please don't

	The laws currently in effect to buffer the government approved
religions may also be utilized to buffer an anti-establishmentarianist
(whew) church!  The requirements, so far as the government is concerned,
are as follows:

     1.  A place, or places, of worship.
     2.  A constituency.  That is, a group, rather than one, that believe
         in that religion.
     3.  A belief structure, or set of precepts that the group holds true.


     Webster, my buddy sitting on the couch next to me, as I write this on
my laptop, says that religion is "any specific system of belief, worship,
conduct, etc., often involving a code of ethics and a philosophy."

     I will attempt to state, herein, a universal concept, which avid
readers of this publication will have no desire to contest.  My purpose is
to unite our audience under a common system of beliefs, which will be
recognized by the government.  And united as such, protected by the
government itself.  Then the organization will be a tax-haven for those who
wish to donate and also a means for the 'priests' or whatever name they will
attain, to make their dedication to our cause more easily handleable by
making food and other purchases tax free.  We are already a non-profit
organization with, already, hundreds of man-hours, donated to the cause.  If
we can utilize the system to maintain our organization, taxes and lives will
be more easily handled or non-existent.

     I openly welcome changes and additions to this purported belief
structure.  It is obviously incomplete.  But as it is, it is simple,
universal, and true.  Too dense, and we become a bureaucratic mess like the
government itself.  Too many restraints and we close the doors to many
people who would be of great benefit.  To change the rules so that they are
falsehoods would make us hypocrites like those we oppose.


                            Belief Structure

Survive.
Knowledge is Power.
Power should be shared, for survival.
United, a group of believers, is more powerful, than each individual acting
    separately.
Hoarders of knowledge are enemies.
Enemies must be equalized for survival.

Individuality sparks from knowledge.
Opinions are formed from individuality.
Opinions, therefore individuality, therefore power, should be allowed to
     exist in others and respected for what it is.

Our only true threat is suppression -
     suppression of thought, knowledge, individuality.
These hoarders want to restrain all knowledge and breed ignorance -
     to create and maintain absolute power for themselves.
Power should be shared - for survival.

To share knowledge is to smite the enemy - ensuring survival.
To use knowledge, thought to be hoarded, is to pull the pin while it's 
     in their hand.


The ability to know, form opinions, and think is not inherent to any race,
religion, area of inhabitance, birthright, sex, age, height, weight,
political affiliation, sexual preference, lifestyle, diet, eye color,
recessive or dominant gene.

     As a free-thinker, I promise to:

1.  Think for myself, not blindly accepting all that is spoken.
2.  Share knowledge.  With the press, politicians, citizens.
3.  Expose hoarders of knowledge, and share their knowledge.
4.  To prevent hoarders from hoarding.
5.  To support true equality for all.
6.  To promote the freedom of speech in the world.
7.  To support free-thinkers and free-thinking worldwide.
8.  To stress the importance of knowledge to the public.
9.  To increase the numbers of free-thinking humans in the world.
10. To make this world a better place.

     Meetings of the organization may take place in many forms and places. 
Sharing of information is not restricted by physical barriers.  1A will be a
forum for sharing knowledge, thus constituting a monthly meeting, on the
first of every month.

    I hope that this is enough to fully separate our cause from the scads of
other religions across the world.  I, also, hope that you see the need and
strength available by creating a group of such massive proportion that the
government will indeed listen.  This is NOT a joke.  This organization CAN
be REAL!  Let us know.  No donations are required.  This is not a scam to
get you!  This is an attempt to use the rules the government creates to
protect its own [thus rendered state and church less divisible] to protect
US!  To give us a non-taxed, non-profit, protected forum to air our views
and grievances.

     Moon Web is a group of Witches and Pagans who join energies in healing
and peace efforts.  This Moon Web is scheduled for January 31st, 1993 at
7 pm.  It is the seventh anniversary of the first AIDS Moon Web.  This
ritual focuses on destroying barriers and increasing the positive elements
that will help us overcome AIDS.

     The ritual space is purified according to personal practice.
Invocations to Athena, Hermes, and/or Brigid may be done.  Those gathered
will be divided into five groups.  One will be assigned to each of the
elements with one group in the center.  Each group may be led by a
particular coven or group of coven leaders.  The center (altar) group will
present each elemental group with the obstacle to overcome and later accept
the positive "goal".  We have divided the elements this way:
     AIR - Knowledge/Ignorance
     FIRE - Commitment/Indifference
     EARTH - Funding/Red Tape
     WATER - Empathy/Hostility

     When confronted with the obstacles the small groups will be wrapped
with crepe paper by the center group.  We suggest the spectral colors: Air -
Purple, Fire - Green, Earth - Red, Water - Orange.  The groups break their
bonds, overcoming the obstacle.  When all four are done, each quarter group
presents the center group with a candle symbolizing the positive quality.
They are all placed on the altar and tied with silver thread.  As they burn,
the group can dance to raise energy.

     Afterwards, all are given candles charged during the ritual that were
on or under the altar to take home and spread the light.  Cakes and
Wine/Libations can follow.

     This Moon Web was created by the leaders of The Gaia Group, Knossos
Grove, and Kathexis of NYC.

                                AIDS MOON WEB

All present will be divided into five groups. In the east - air.  In the
south - fire.  In the west - water.  In the north - earth.  In the center
are the drama facilitators.  Each group is "lead" by an experienced person.

Water, salt are consecrated.
Circle is drawn with wand.
Circle is blessed with water and incense.

Invocation to Athena, Hermes and Brigid as to purpose of rite.

Air group speaks INTELLIGENTLY on AIDS.  Statements like "The HIV virus is
very fragile and is only passed through intimate contact."
They are all bound with PURPLE crepe paper.
They begin to make IGNORANT statements like '"you can catch AIDS from
shaking hands".  They are temporarily defeated by the IGNORANCE of the crepe
paper.  Then they rally and tear apart their bonds.

Fire group speaks about dedication to finding a cure for AIDS, expressing
COMMITMENT.
They are bound with GREEN crepe paper.
They speak with INDIFFERENCE.
They slowly overcome and break free of their bonds.

The Water group talks about EMPATHY.
They are bound with ORANGE crepe paper.
They speak of HOSTILITY.
They break free.

The Earth group talks about adequate FUNDING.
They are bound with RED crepe paper.
They become tangled in RED TAPE.
They overcome the challenge.

Each group charges a taper with their positive element.  The tapers are
placed on the altar and bound with silver thread.  They are lit and all
dance around in a single or double circle and send energy out to spread our
will.  Extra candles on the altar are also charged.

Juice and cookies are blessed and shared.
All are given candles to take home to spread the light.

The deities are thanked.
The circle is closed.

|                 IS AIDS MANMADE?  THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM                |
|                      by The Strecker Society                             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     We have a story to tell you, a very strange story, one that affects
you, me and every other human being on earth.  A story that must be taken
seriously by the governments of every nation in the world because there may
not be many humans left to govern by the turn of the century, or shortly
thereafter.  A story so bizarre, and so sinister that, if it were not for
the fact that it is all true, it would make a great science fiction
thriller. (Interestingly enough, Lorimar Pictures of Hollywood has purchased
the rights to Dr. Strecker's life story.)

     The story begins in 1983 with Dr. Robert B. Strecker, M.D., Ph.D.
Dr. Strecker practices internal medicine and gastroenterology in Los
Angeles. He is a trained pathologist and holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology.  Dr.
Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were preparing a proposal for a
health maintenance organization (HMO) for the Security Pacific Bank of
California.  They needed to know the long-term financial effects of insuring
and treating AIDS patients.  In as much as this information was not readily
available in 1983, both brothers began researching the medical literature to
learn what they could about their relatively new disease.  The information
they uncovered right from the beginning was so startling to them, so hard to
believe, that it would dramatically alter both their lives and lead them on
a five-year quest culminating with the creation of "The Strecker Memorandum"
the most controversial video tape of our time and a remarkable set of
documents called "The Bio-Attack Alert."

WHAT THEY DISCOVERED

     Right there in the medical literature for anyone to read for
themselves was, basically, proof that the AIDS virus and pandemic was
actually PREDICTED years ago by a world-famous virologist, among others. 
They found that top scientists writing in the BULLETIN of the World Health
Organization were actually REQUESTING that AIDS-like viruses be created to
study the effects on humans.  In fact, the Streckers unearthed thousands of
documents all supporting the man-made origin of AIDS.  Meanwhile, the
government was telling everyone that a green monkey in Africa bit some
native and started AIDS.  As their research continued, it became obvious
from the documentation that the virus itself was not only created as
requested, but actually DEPLOYED, and now threatens the existence of mankind
because it does what it was designed to do:  Cause cancer in humans via a
contagious virus.  Eventually, the Streckers came to realize everything the
government, the so-called AIDS experts and media were telling the public was
not only misleading, but out and out lies...The truth of the matter is:
     *  AIDS is a man-made disease;
     *  AIDS is not a homosexual disease;
     *  AIDS is not a venereal disease;
     *  AIDS can be carried by mosquitoes;
     *  Condoms will not prevent AIDS;
     *  There are at least six different AIDS viruses loose in the world;
     *  And on and on, but...

THE SCARIEST PART

     The most dreaded fear that all oncologists (cancer doctors),
virologists, and immunologists live with is that some day CANCER, in one
form or another, will become a contagious disease, transferable from one
person to another.  AIDS has now made that fear a reality.  If you think you
are safe because you are not sexually active, then you must watch "The
Strecker Memorandum" very carefully.

IF YOU PLAN TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT YOU HAD BETTER READ THIS

     The most common misconception being foisted upon us right now concerns
sexually active Americans.  We are told that if a man uses a condom, the
transference of the deadly virus is virtually eliminated.  Nothing could be
further from the truth.  Of all the body fluids that the AIDS virus is found
in, semen contains the least.  As a matter of fact, in every single study
ever published on the subject, no one has found a significant amount in
anyone's semen.  It just isn't there in huge numbers.  There is usually
about one virus per milliliter, a statistically irrelevant amount.  One
copious ejaculation might produce only one or two viruses.  This is
substantiated in the medical literature.  But, just for argument's sake,
let's say all the medical studies are wrong.  Let's pretend that there are
countless millions of AIDS viruses in the ejaculation.  Are you aware that
condoms are riddled with microscopic or larger holes?  Studies show that
even the smallest holes found in condoms are two to ten times larger than
the AIDS virus.  It's like shooting a golf ball through a basketball hoop.
Condoms have not, will not, and cannot prevent AIDS.

THOUSANDS ALREADY DEAD

     Over one hundred thousand Americans have already died because they
didn't know the truth about AIDS.  Between twelve and fifteen million
Americans are already infected.  One in 60 babies born in New York City is
infected; one in 300 college students in America is infected; one in 20
aliens applying for amnesty is infected, including men, women and children.
These are just some of the facts you are not likely to hear about from the
media.

WHY A VIDEO TAPE?

     One of the first things the Streckers did was to try and tell their
medical and legal colleagues what they were finding in the literature.  Some
were interested; most were not.  Certainly no one was prepared to risk their
professional standing by making waves within the establishment.  Ted
Strecker compiled some of the most damaging documents into a report he
called "The Bio-Attack Alert" and sent it to every Governor of every state,
the President, the Vice-President (now [ex]President), the FBI, the CIA, the
NSA, and selected members of Congress.  He got a grand total of three
replies from three governors; nothing from the government.

     Both he and Dr. Strecker were laughed at and ridiculed at every turn.
As an example, Dr. Strecker told the government in 1985 that virtually every
person testing positive for AIDS would die prematurely and painfully.  The
government said that was nonsense.  Their figures showed that maybe ten
percent at most would die from the disease.  In 1986, the government said
maybe 50 percent of those infected would die, in 1987, they said maybe 75
percent, in 1988 they finally agreed with Dr. Strecker that AIDS is
virtually 100 percent fatal.  We could go on and on with facts Dr. Strecker
unearthed that the "experts" said were wrong and now accepted as the truth.
Dr. Strecker, like a good scientist, submitted paper after paper with his
findings to all the prestigious medical journals in America.  They were
refused.  He then tried to have his findings published in Europe.  Again,
closed doors.  What to do?  Dr. Strecker did not feel he could take the time
from his practice and his research to write a book.  On the other hand,
everyone has a TV and now most households have a video cassette recorder
(VCR).  The time involved to make a video is nothing compared to writing a
book, and so the video "The Strecker Memorandum" was created.  It is 96
minutes of the most startling, controversial, and information-packed video
you will ever see.  It disputes virtually everything the American public is
being told by the government, the so-called AIDS experts, and the media.
In fact, after seeing it YOU will know more about AIDS than 99 percent of
all doctors in America.

MUSIC IS NOTHING IF THE AUDIENCE IS DEAF

     With the video made, it seemed a simple matter to advertise it and the
world would now become aware of what it was facing, right?  WRONG!  The fact
that you are even reading about "The Strecker Memorandum" now is a minor
miracle by itself, in as much as TV station managers have refused to
advertise it.  TV and radio time brokers that sell blocks of commercial time
have refused to sell us time.  TV station managers have refused to even air
programs containing interviews with Dr. Strecker.  A national radio network
did an interview with a famous talk show host and Dr. Strecker and then
refused to run it.  Virtually every big name network television magazine
show and all the syndicated TV interviewers and talk show hosts have said
NO to Dr. Strecker.  Big city newspapers will not take any print ads telling
about it, and so it goes...WHY?  What is in "The Strecker Memorandum" that
sends a cold chill down the spine of most media executives?

WHY IS EVERYONE AFRAID OF "THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM?"

     The excuse we hear over and over is that it is too controversial.  TOO
CONTROVERSIAL?  They say that this information, if widely disseminated, will
cause the public to panic.  IF someone had poisoned your water supply and
you and your family could die, wouldn't you want to know about it?  Would
you panic?  Or would you more likely be outraged and try to find out who did
it and punish them?  We feel the only persons who might panic are those
scientists who willingly or otherwise created AIDS and are now promoting
misinformation by covering it up.  After all, if you made AIDS would you
tell anyone about it?

THINK OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...NOW THINK OF THEM DEAD

     It may take a while before the words "species threatening" sink in,
because the term has rarely been used before to describe an existing human
condition.  But once you realize the implications of that term, and realize
that, unlike any other kind of disease ever known to man, past or present,
AIDS can, if unchecked, kill every human on earth, then your outlook and
attitude regarding everything in life must change.  Whether you like it or
not, and despite all your precautions, the time will come when you will test
positive for AIDS, and it can happen much quicker than you realize.

IT'S OUT THERE

     The number of AIDS-infected people is doubling approximately every 12
months, and in some areas even sooner.  With twelve to fifteen million
Americans carrying the virus, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see
how long we have here in the U.S.  Africa has, conservatively, 75 million
infected; some estimates double that.  Brazil as a country is in serious
jeopardy because all through the 1970's they were buying their blood supply
from Africa.  On top of that, the World Health Organization conducted a
large scale small pox vaccination program there in the 1970's (for the full
implications of that see "The Strecker Memorandum").  Southern Japan has
about 30 percent infected with HTLV I, the leukemia-causing virus (although
you will never hear about that on TV).  Russia is now reporting AIDS as a
problem and no one can enter Russia permanently without a current negative
blood test for AIDS.  Cuba has already set up concentration camps for the
AIDS-infected and they are full (you won't see that on TV either).  Haiti
of course is ravaged by AIDS; more than 20 percent of the people are
infected and getting worse every day.  And so it goes.  Virtually every
nation on earth with few exceptions (Iran is one) is reporting a growing
problem.  It's on every continent, every sub-continent, and every island
chain, Atlantic and Pacific. So why won't the media or government tell you
these things?  It is too controversial for you to handle?  Are you going to
panic?

IS THERE ANY HOPE?

     Yes and no.  No, if you are waiting for the government to create a
magic bullet.  As you will see in "The Strecker Memorandum,"  part of the
problem is that all the various AIDS viruses are "recombinant retroviruses."
Very simply, that means they have the ability to recombine with the genes of
any cell they enter and the offspring or new viruses they form are different
from the parent viruses.  HTLV III alone (that's the most common American
AIDS virus) has the mathematical ability to change itself 9,000 X 9,000 X
9,000 X 9,000 times (which is 9,000 to the forth power).  The common cold
recombines much less frequently and we haven't found a cure for it after a
hundred years.  Besides, does it make much sense to entrust the cure for
AIDS to the same people that may have created it?

     YES, there is hope if Dr. Strecker and a growing number of realistic
scientists are correct in looking at alternative, non-allopathic, non-drug
modalities based on Raman spectroscopy.  In fact, many experiments are going
on now that offer great promise.

     Unfortunately, our government takes a dim view of any type of treatment
for any type of disease -- let alone AIDS -- that does not conform to its
rigid rules for acceptance, registration, and legalization.  Of course the
FDA would definitely like to see an allopathic drug treatment or cure
presented by an ethical drug company or university.  Well, we don't think
that's going to happen.  Because of this attitude, much experimentation in
America must go underground, underfunded, or out of the country entirely.
Again, this is explained further in "The Strecker Memorandum".

BE BOLD AND MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME TO YOUR AID
OR MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME AND KILL YOU

     An ominous personal aspect of this story has been the sudden and
unexpected deaths of two of the key players.  First Dr. Strecker's brother,
Ted Strecker, was found shot to death in his home in Springfield, Missouri,
an apparent suicide, on August 11, 1988.  Was Ted Strecker Suicidal?
Perhaps.  In the past he suffered from depression and monumental frustration
at the relative lack of interest in his findings.  Dr. Strecker spoke with
him the night before his death.  Ted was cheerful, in good spirits, and
looking forward to certain new developments that promised progress.  The
next day he was found dead, his 22-caliber rifle next to him.  No note, no
message, no goodbyes to anyone.  Very untypical of him.  Officially a
suicide.  Next, Illinois State Representative Douglas Huff of Chicago was
found alone in his home, dead from an apparent overdose of cocaine and
heroin, on September 22, 1988.  Representative Huff did everything in his
power to make the Illinois State Legislature and the people of Chicago aware
of Dr. Strecker's work.  He was very vocal, gave many press interviews, was
constantly on television and radio urging people to wake up to the cover-up
concerning AIDS.  Did Representative Huff use drugs?  Perhaps.  Was he an
addict?  NO.  Would he have known how dangerous a massive overdose of
cocaine and heroin was?  Yes, of course.  Cause of death; officially a
stroke.  Dr. Strecker has serious doubts that his brother killed himself.
Representative Huff's associates doubt he died accidentally, and yet they
are gone.  Who's next?

IGNORANCE IS BLISS, OR IS IT SUICIDE?

     We all know it is easier for a king to have a lie believed than a
beggar to spread the truth.  Well, we are spreading the truth about AIDS.
Unfortunately, it isn't pretty.  But the fact is you are not being told the
truth by the government or the so-called AIDS experts.  The media, for
reasons of their own, will not present information contradicting the
official propaganda.  So you can choose to go along with the same people who
gave us brain cancer (SV-40 virus) as a result of their contaminated polio
vaccines in the early 1960's; a polio-like disease from their contaminated
Swine Flu vaccine in the 1970's; and AIDS from their smallpox and hepatitis
B vaccinates; or, you can at least make yourself aware of the clear and
present dangers that we all face by watching "The Strecker Memorandum."
The cost of the tape is nominal, but we submit that remaining ignorant can
cost infinitely more.

means, that the government and major pharmaceutical corporations are
ignoring.]

     In 1988, Parade magazine profiled 16 patients with Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), who had survived the disease longer than
expected.  In their June 10, 1990 issue, the magazine reported that 13 of
the patients are still alive, although three have been experiencing some
health problems.

     Current statistics available at the time of their second article showed
there have been 128,319 adults and adolescents with AIDS diagnosed in
America since 1981.  Of that number, more than 78,340 have died.

     Of the ten patients who have not had any major setbacks, all are living
normal lives.  Louie Nassaney, 35, who has lectured at a number of natural
food industry seminars, has had a reversal of the disease, but he told
Parade that he expected to participate in the Special Olympics games in
Vancouver this year.

    "I've found that some AIDS patients do very well in combinations of
approaches," said Richard Elion, M.D., a New York physician who has treated
hundreds of HIV-positive and AIDS patients. "They may be getting [the drug]
AZT, alpha interferon, or Bactrim and at the same time use Chinese herbs or
visualization.  Having options and choices tends to promote well-being."

     Luc Montagnier, M.D., of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, added that,
"Psychological factors are critical in supporting the immune function.  If
you suppress this psychological support by telling someone that he is doomed
to die, your words alone have condemned him.  It simply isn't true that the
virus is 100 percent fatal.  There is much we do not know in medicine, but
there is little question that a positive outlook is extraordinarily
helpful."

     All aspects of AIDS treatment were covered at the Advanced Immune
Discoveries Symposium, June 20-24 in San Francisco.  The symposium was held
concurrently with the annual International Conference on AIDS, which was
sponsored by the World Health Organization.  Among the speakers and the
treatments they discussed were:

    -Laurence E. Badgley, M.D., in private practice in CA, described a
double-blind study involving medicinal mushrooms.
    -John Bogden, Ph.D., of the NJ Medical School in Newark, described his
work with minerals and other micronutrients.
    -Robert Cathcart, M.D., San Francisco General Hospital, explained his
mistletoe protocol.
    -Raxit Jariwalla, Ph.D., of the Linus Pauling Institute, Palo Alto, CA,
described new vitamin C research.
    -Osana Kandil, Ph.D., Zayed Institute for Immunological Research and
Medicinal Plants, Panama City, FL, explained the stimulation of the immune
system by an herbal preparation.
    -And many, many others...

     Since 1983, Robert Cathcart, M.D., has treated more than 250 HIV -
positive patients with megadoses of vitamin C, according to an article in
the Lancet.  The sicker the patient the more ascorbic acid in water he can
tolerate before diarrhea sets in, Dr. Cathcart said.  A healthy person can
generally tolerate only 10 to 15 grams of vitamin C in four to six divided
doses over 24 hours before the tissues become saturated and diarrhea begins.
But symptom-free HIV-positive patients regularly tolerate 20 to 40 grams of
vitamin C daily;  ARC or AIDS related complex patients 25 to 60 grams; and
AIDS patients 30 to 200 grams daily without getting diarrhea.  Dr. Cathcart
theorizes that the massive amounts are used up to fight the infection before
enough is left to cause diarrhea.

     "Doses of 100 to 200 grams are tolerated in patients acutely ill, such
as those with acute pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)," he said.  "Oral
doses are encouraged to be at every hour at first.  The frequency will vary
with the 'toxicity' of the disease.  The patient titrates the dose until it
relieves the toxic symptoms or almost produces diarrhea.  During a crisis,
doses may be taken every fifteen minutes, but when the patient is completely
symptom free, doses may be taken only six times a day."

     When doses of vitamin C close to tolerance are maintained consistently,
the depletion of harmful T-cells is sometimes slowed, stopped, or even
reversed for several years, he said.

     When patients cannot tolerate megadoses of vitamin due to stomach
upset, or other gastrointestinal difficulties, Dr. Cathcart recommends
intravenous doses of sodium ascorbate (a form of vitamin C.)  The shots are
given during a 3-4 hour period one to three times daily, and oral doses of
the vitamin are given to tolerance level at the same time.

     Vitamins and minerals are necessary for stimulating the immune system,
according to John D. Bogden and colleagues, who reported their study in
"Annals New York Academy of Science."

     "The immune system utilizes tissue vitamins and trace element stores to
meet the demands of the challenges by infectious agents," they reported. "If
these stores are inadequate, immunity may be compromised.  Thus, immunity is
highly dependent on vitamin and trace element status, and failure to detect
deficits of these nutrients could exacerbate the progression and/or severity
of HIV infection."

     The study involved 26 males and four females.  Seventeen had mild or
severe ARC; seven had AIDS; and six were asymptomatic.  Eight of the
volunteers had lost 10 or more pounds during the previous six months.

     Blood analysis showed that the patients averaged a thirty percent
deficiency in zinc; 27% in calcium, 30% in magnesium, 31% in carotenes,
50% in choline, and 27% in vitamin C.

     "Eighty-seven percent of the subjects had at least one abnormally low
value,"  the researchers said.  "Percentages with above-normal values
include folic acid (37%) and cartine (37%).  Some subjects with above-normal
values for plasma vitamins reported self-supplementation, usually with large
doses.  The results suggest that one or more abnormally low concentrations
of the plasma micronutrients studied here are likely to be present in the
majority of HIV sero-positive patients."

     Selenium and gluthione peroxidase, an antioxidant enzyme, are natural
substances which inactivate free radicals [ionized particles in the air and
food] and prohibit them from destroying cells and compromising the immune
system, according to Julian E. Spallholz, Ph.D., Texas Tech University,
Lubbock, in 'Antioxidant Nutrients and Immune Functions.'  In addition to
being an antioxidant, selenium is crucial for health of platelets and
lymphocytes [red blood cells and the tissue which creates white blood
cells.]  The mineral works with gluthione peroxidase in conjunction with
arachidonic acid in the formation of prostaglandins [lost me there, babe...]

     Selenium has been used extensively to treat AIDS patients, because it
and other antioxidants provide protection for the microphages [white blood
cells, themselves.]  The white blood cells are one of the body's defense
mechanisms against bacteria and other foreign invaders.

     Hideaki Hagiwara, Ph.D., and scientists at the University of California
at San Francisco (UC@SF), have reported that an extract from barley leaves
inhibits further infection by the AIDS virus in a laboratory setting.

     "It has already been found that there is an anti-viral activity in the
extract of green barley leaves," Dr. Hagiwara said.  "We still need to
demonstrate whether it is effective to patients as an AIDS-curing drug.
However, we think we've obtained almost 100% effective results, in an
experimental stage."

     Michael S. McGrath, Division of AIDS/Oncology at the UC@SF, and
colleagues there and in other agencies in California and Hong Kong, have
reported that trichosanthin, which is made from the root of the Chinese
snakegourd Trichosanthes kirilowii, inhibits the HIV virus in vitro.

     "The anti-HIV activity of [the substance] in both acutely and
chronically affected cells of both lymphoid and mononuclear phagocytic
lineage make it an interesting candidate in HIV infection of AIDS," they
reported in the 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Science' [A similar
substance has been extracted from the American castor bean - Daiv]

|               Why Don't More Doctors Treat AIDS Holistically?            |
|                         Editorial by Frank Murray                        |

     [To holistically treat a disease, is to identify what the body is
missing or has extra that is causing the symptoms that exist, to persist.
Most doctors do NOT treat any diseases holistically, instead treating each
symptom, to make that one symptom go away... only to return, because the
actual problem was not identified and solved.  This maintains a steady
client base, as no one actually gets cured; they just come back in again and
again to relieve the newest exhibited symptom of what is really wrong.  This
is much the equivalent of removing each combusted item from an inferno,
rather than extinguishing it at the base.  There are many stories to
illustrate this further, but I think you get my point.]

     I admire the courage required by basketball star "Magic" Johnson to
announce to the world that he was carrying the HIV virus that may eventually
develop into full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  But I am
pessimistic enough to believe that his painful ordeal will have little or no
effect on the long-term AIDS crisis.

     If we are to save lives, we need someone of Johnson's stature to insist
that the government and/or private enterprise provide significant funding
for the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto,
California, or other holistically oriented research centers.  These
organizations are dedicated to researching the effects of vitamin C, garlic,
St. John's wort [a root], echinacea [an herb], zinc, astragalus [an herb],
selenium and other holistic treatments for AIDS patients.  Natural therapies
like this, exercise, and biofeedfack have few, if any, side effects.  This
is the way to save lives.

     As I reviewed some recent studies on vitamin C, I was reminded of an
article in a popular health magazine in the 1980s.  In that article, a
researcher at a New York university reported that he had filled dozens of
test tubes with the AIDS virus and then tested every substance in his
laboratory to see if anything would inactivate the virus.  Three things did:
vitamin C, vitamin E, and the amino acid alanine.  All three nutrients boost
the immune system and aid in the production of lymphocytes [tissue which
produces white blood cells -Daiv].

     This startling revelation almost ranks alongside Dr. James Lind's
assertion that scurvy is caused by a vitamin C deficiency or Dr. Casimir
Funk's belief that beriberi is a vitamin B1 deficiency disease.

     To my knowledge, the evidence was ignored.  The researcher is no longer
at that university and has apparently never spoken about his findings.  One
can only assume that someone told him to keep his discovery quiet, if he is
expected to get any grants from industry, since drug companies cannot make a
million dollars on natural, non-patented substances.

     Although many holistic physicians treat AIDS patients with natural
therapies, it is often at a high cost.  These dedicated doctors are often
ridiculed by their peers, and their names turn up on the black list
published by the ever present "quack busters."

     Since it may be a decade before and AIDS vaccine is approved, why does
The Establishment continue to belittle the dedicated professionals who are
using natural therapies?  For such an insidious disease, no one can really
afford to be omniscient.

In good health!

[    We've discovered that AIDS is not just a sex disease, but a disease
caused by infecting the bloodstream.  In the following article, Anesthesia
discusses some precautions when getting tattooed.]


                  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-* Tattoo You *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
                                 by Anesthesia

     With all the talk in this issue about disease, I felt I should share my
views on this topic.  (Also, to test David Lightman's skills as an editor.
:> )  [Thanks, I love a challenge - Daiv]  Besides, I've learned some things
lately that disturb me.

     Lately, tattoos have become a modern, acceptable thing.  Body graffiti
is not just for overweight bikers any more.  I have a growing collection and
am pleased with them. (Note: Daiv, Storm, and I all have tattoos.)  I have
heard stories from people of all walks of life getting them.

     Find a reputable shop and ask friends that have been there.  Usually
there  are a few people, regular customers, in the lobby, as tattoos are
rather addictive, that are more than willing to show you theirs.  Talk to
them and see what they have to say.  Also, visit several shops, if you can,
to see what's available to you in your area.

     Remember that looking for the cheapest price is usually a bad idea.
These are permanent. If the artist makes a mistake, it could be hard to fix.
(eg, One of the eyes on one of mine, has a line that is too long because
someone hit the chair while the artist did the work.)  The artist did a
great job of covering it up.  I can still, however, tell that it's wrong. [I
can't - Daiv]  Fixes can cost a great deal more than the original design.

     Don't be afraid to ask the artist if he has a book of his own designs
or will do one of your own.  Most don't mind and are proud to do this.

     Always make sure that the shop uses fresh, sterile needles.  They are
making thousands of punctures [per minute] into the skin.  That raises the
chance of infection or spreading disease quite a bit.  Another important
factor is that the artist wear surgical gloves!  They are highly resistant
to spreading disease.  Although I hate to stereotype, I have met quite a few
artists that do drugs. [All three that I have hired, do - Daiv]  This, in
itself, increases the chance of spreading AIDS.  If they don't wear gloves,
request it.  If they won't, make an excuse to go to another shop!

     To dispel a certain myth: there are parts of the anatomy, where the
process hurts.  But, in general, it isn't too uncomfortable.  If it was,
would so many people get them?  I think not.

     For those interested, good luck and be safe.  If you ever see someone
with a skull on their right arm with 'Anesthesia' written under it - It's
probably me!


[    As AIDS has been traditionally associated with homosexuals, and was
created to wipe out homosexuals and intravenous drug users in one swipe...
Here's a sampling of how the public in general also can view alternative
lifestyles as a threat! - People who are stuck in their ways, and want
others to stop what they are doing and to comply with their beliefs!

    This article reminds me of a poem that I will attempt to relay to
feeling of, as I don't have it completely memorized.  This was originally
written about the holocaust, in the 50's.

     First they came for the Jews,
     But I was silent, I am not a Jew.

     Then they came for the Christians,
     I said nothing, I am not a Christian.

     Then they took the Catholics.
     I did nothing.  I am not Catholic.

     Finally, they came for the Protestants,
     I cried for help... to no avail,
     there was no one left to hear my screams.

                      Colorado Passes Anti-Gay Amendment!
                       by Bruce Finley and Michael Booth


     Colorado political leaders, last month, launched plans for a legal war
on Amendment 2, while Gay Rights activists promised a national boycott of
the state until it is overturned.

     The measure, approved by a 53% to 47% ratio, in last month's statewide
election would ban civil rights protections for gays and repeal existing
anti-discrimination ordinances in Denver, Boulder, and Aspen.

     Denver officials said they would file a lawsuit within ten days to
overturn the measure.  By mid-afternoon, the American Association of
Physicians for Human Rights, a gay and lesbian doctors group had cancelled
plans to hold its August 1993 convention, with several hundred delegates in
Denver. "It's inconceivable to us to spend our money in a state that
endorses discrimination against us," said executive director, Benjamin
Schatz.

     Other amendment opponents said they planned an effort similar to the
boycott against Arizona when state officials refused to create a holiday
honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. "Every penny not spent in Colorado, will be
spent elsewhere, and that's how it works, by pennies," said Martin Hiraga,
spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C.

     Representative of Colorado for Family Values, the group that backed
Amendment 2, said a gay boycott won't hurt Colorado.

     "What about all of those who will want to come here because this state
is not a bastion of gay rights?", said C.F.V. founder Tony Marco.  [Whatta
jerk!  Like anyone wants to live in a state that specifically denies ANYone
rights! - Daiv]  "I think the economic benefits of THOSE people will be far
greater."

     Marco also chided civic leaders for trying to overturn the new
amendment. "It's regrettable that the governor is unwilling to abide by the
expressed will of the people,"  he said from Colorado Springs, where the
amendment drew its strongest support.

     Colorado is the only state in the nation where voters have banned laws
protecting gays.

     The outcome brought hundreds of protestors to the state capitol, for a
candlelight vigil last night. Loud chants of "No more hate!" reverberated
through the grounds.

     Denver will file a legal challenge within ten days, Mayor Wellington
Webb said yesterday.  Webb said the amendment violates the state
constitutions home-rule provision, which gives some cities authority to make
their own laws.

     Some legal experts said the amendment also violates the 14th amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, which gives citizens equal protection under the
law.  Aspen and Boulder, likely, will join Denver as plaintiffs in the
lawsuit, said Denver city attorney, Dan Muse.  A coalition of private
groups, including the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union),  Colorado Legal
Initiatives Project, and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, will
bankroll the lawsuit.

     As the state's top legal officials, Gov. Roy Romer and Atty. General,
Gale Norton, likely will be named as defendants, despite Romer's furious
opposition to the amendment.  Romer's lawyer, Cole Finnegan, said he's
researching the law, but noted that the governor "is obliged,
constitutionally, to execute the laws of the state."

     Romer called a morning meeting after amendment opponents marched
through downtown until 2 am yesterday to protest the vote.  At the meeting,
Romer told a crowd of about 600 people the amendment passed because of "a
gross, gross misunderstanding that needs to be corrected."

     U.S. Representative Pat Schroeder, of Denver said: "Some of you have
asked: 'Where am I going to move to?'  Don't Move!  FIGHT!  Stay here and
fight!"

     Alamosa nurse, Vicky Clark confronted Romer saying she has already been
discriminated against.  "I just applied for a job," said Clark, 43. "I
didn't get it.  I was qualified, but they knew I was gay.  Now I may have to
come to Denver to work."

     In a telephone call to the Denver Post, San Francisco investor, John
Snipes, said he and his lover, are cancelling plans to move to Colorado
because of the amendment.

     "What this tells me, is that there is definitely hate fostered by half
of the voting community in Colorado," Snipes said.  "I don't want to know
that there is somebody out there who has been given permission to draw a
bead on me because of the initiative."

     The Colorado ski industry may also become a boycott target.

     Fred Kohn, president of the International Gay Travel Association said
he has already begun discouraging clients from visiting the state.  Kohn
said his association includes agencies that handle $1 billion in annual
travel spending.

     Aspen's annual Gay Ski Week, which fills hotels and restaurants with
more than 3,000 skiers, also is in jeopardy. "I do not want to be punitive
to the Aspen community, but I think the state of Colorado has to understand
that they cannot get away with this kind of discrimination," said Los
Angeles travel agent Robin Tyler, who helps publicize the ski weekend.

     Deb Cirksena, of Nebraska, a lesbian who has skied in Colorado for 24
years, called after learning of the vote.  Cirksena said she will no longer
visit the state and will discourage her friends from coming also.  "I spend
a lot of time and money in Colorado, and that will likely come to an end,"
she said.

     Some amendment opponents called on gays statewide to openly declare
their sexuality, arguing that more people will realize they know individuals
affected by the amendment.  Oregon voters defeated a stern measure to limit
gay rights.  Backers of that proposal said they will try again with a
measure modeled on the new Colorado Law.  [Which was confusing, and misled
voters! - Daiv]


[For a more in depth attack on the supposed equal protection under the law
that is constantly known as not being so, here's another by George
Knoblauch...]

|                              Equal Protection?                           |

     This illegal grab of power by all branches of government is called
usurpation.  It is: "to seize and hold (a position, power, etc.) by force or
without legal right."  As you can see, this is exactly what has been
happening in our great country.

     A law professor, Raoul Berger of Harvard University, made the
statement:  "On the contrary, it is never too late to challenge the
usurpation of power... -- Usurpation -- the exercise of power not granted
is not legitimated by repetition."

     A great many people realize this but those in government wouldn't be
overjoyed for you and I to know it.  And they would be even less happy when
we take the action that the professor recommends.  As he says, just because
a practice has been going on for a long time does not make it legal.

     If it was against the law when it started, no amount of talking or
usage will make it within the law now.  Ignoring of our Constitution and the
assuming of powers we did not grant has to be stopped.

     Carved in the stone face on the Supreme Court building is the
statement: "Equal Protection Under the Laws."

     Compare that statement with the state of our protection today. It's
apparent that it was carved a long time ago.

     Their decisions today just serve to justify some government action, not
to protect a citizen's rights.

     Let's see, what did their oath say?  That they will "administer justice
without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and the rich.. "

     Perhaps they are administering justice without respect to persons and
that's how they now use their power only to justify some governmental
action? 

     This is equal protection under the laws?

     Can you think of any rich and/or powerful person who gets the same
justice as the average citizen?  How about some members of Congress who
ignore (break) the law and nothing is done to satisfy justice?  How about
Nixon?  There was no right for Ford to issue that pardon.  How about Spiro
Agnew?  (Spiro who?)  Our ex-vice president pleaded guilty to tax evasion.
Anything happen to him?  No!  How about a Kennedy who swam away from his car
and didn't report the incident for over eight hours?  What if that were you
or I?  Does that oath mean they can disrespect any person they choose and
then administer justice as they define it?  Equal protection indeed.

     This is el toro caca and their duty is still to protect the American
citizen from illegal and unlawful practices by the government.  We have the
absolute right to demand and expect protection from the judicial branch, not
persecution.

     The issue of the independence of federal judges is of importance to us.
If they are not independent of the other two branches of government, we
can't expect protection from them if their opinion will go against some
other part of government.

     If they are not independent, we get into what is called 'collusion'
which is "acting together through a secret understanding."  The law
dictionary is more specific in it's definition:  "A secret combination,
conspiracy, or concert of action between two or more persons for fraudulent
or deceitful purpose."

     Look at what's been going on lately...  with the beginning of the so
called tax rebellion, the Internal Revenue Service, way back in 1973, has
been conferring with federal judges on the necessity of handing out prison
sentences in tax cases.

     This has been revealed in IRS memos which were received through the
Freedom of Information Act.  The minutes of a meeting of IRS officials show
that they have been conferring with US attorneys and judges to point out the
problems they are having with 'tax protestors.' [More on the Internal
Revenue Service and Tax Evasion in a later issue!!]

     One recommendation of the memo was to "Wage a campaign to educate U.S.
attorneys and federal judges with the importance of prison sentences on
cases."  This is just one area where the "secret combinations" are going on
that we know of...  In how many other areas is our central government
conducting the same type educational campaigns for U.S. attorneys and
federal judges? 

     I guess the recommended prison sentences do not apply to an ex-vice
president.

     Is there any way a citizen could feel they are being afforded the
protection of a judicial branch in a situation as we have it today?  Hardly.
There would be only one in a hundred judges that could make an honest
decision after all the brainwashing by the other branches of government.

     This could easily be defined as "action of two or more persons for a
fraudulent or deceitful purpose."  The very definition of collusion!  And
judges are to make impartial decisions?

     Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist Papers, had some strong words on
the function of the judicial branch of our new government that judges are to
be interpreters of the law and "It is impossible to keep the judges too
distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws.  It is
peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or
influenced by the executive."

     With that statement in mind, to what branch of government does the
Internal Revenue Service belong?  Why, to the executive of course!

     As was pointed out, an adverse decision can be appealed to the next
higher level of the judicial system.  If the answer of the higher court is
the same, in face of significant constitutional challenges, better check the
definition of the word collusion again.

     It is a bit suspicious to note decisions in these so-called case law
books that are on similar issues around the country all with the same
decisions, even many words being similar. 

     These generally seem to occur after the judicial system has had its
annual conference.  Strange?  Is this where our socially redeeming issues
are discussed?  The nature of the decisions certainly suggest at least that.

     It was reported in a book on American Jurisprudence that the Supreme
Court now wants to become involved in the area of foreign affairs.  Can you
imagine the nerve of these people?  They must figure they have been able
thus far to invade any area they desire and their next target is to be
foreign affairs.  Where do they find the authority for this trespass on
powers reserved to another branch of the central government?  Did the people
authorize it?

      Now the new chief justice, in a speech before a national meeting of
the Bar Association, (his fraternity buddies) asks members to help stop this
trend to 'federalize' crimes.  He insists the courts are now overworked and
by making more crime a federal issue, the courts will be overwhelmed.  Aw...
makes you want to cry!  Why doesn't he request the Congress eliminate all
federalized crimes for which they have no authority to try?

     One area we can point to that shows clearly the judicial branch is
amending the Constitution by decree to violate Article V (Amendment
process), is concerning the writ of habeas corpus.  The Constitution is
plain and definite...

   "The Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in
    cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." 

     Congress is the only branch of government given power in the
Constitution to suspend the Writ.

     The judicial department does it all the time by refusing to consider
the petition, refusing to grant the writ, refusing to act on the petition
or requiring specific forms to apply for a writ, etc.  Of course, their
argument is that they are overworked and underpaid so they have to
concentrate on important issues which is a load of hogwash.

     The Writ cannot be suspended and if it is, it is only the Congress who
has the authority to do so!  There are basic requirements spelled out in our
Constitution which must be followed and not changed by edict by a branch of
our government which has no right to make a law.

[Here's a bit about Anesthesia and I securing some data under the Freedom
of Information Act... ;>  ]

                      :::: Adventures in Trashing ::::
                          as related by Anesthesia

	It seems like a few of you that have read issue #1 are still missing
the point on Dumpster Diving.   Either that or you want to hear more about
other people doing it.  So Lightman and I hit the road, deciding to prove
our point as to the value of this past time.  Here's how it went:

     Since we weren't very familiar with the city, we started very early in
the evening, casing places of interest.  To do this, we found several
typical strip malls and checked out dumpster type, location, and ease of
access, as well as the hours of operation of the businesses they were for.
Many of the ones we found were of the compressor type that offer poor
outside access, but we still found a few very interesting ones and wrote
these down.  (Very important to take notes of good sites, it's easy to
forget which ones are best.)  We even walked around quite a bit to find the
dumpster in one mall, but ended up finding a cool, abandoned building and a
dumpster behind a computer store and real estate office.

     We went to Denny's and waited until prime trashing time... Dark!  So
that gave us some time to make plans for the night and have a little fun.
Our waitress was a real witch and that made it even more fun.  It just
struck me a little odd that Denny's are usually a good spot to meet
interesting folks, but I guess it was a bit early.  (BTW, this is a
tradition long held by me.  I always go to a Denny's and wait for dark
before trashing.)

     So then we got started, much of what we found was totally useless, but
we did come up with some excellent manuals and a lot of carbon atoms ;),  We
also grabbed a sofa and chair that we plan on selling.  So, not too bad
overall, especially for a first night in a fresh city.  Now that we have
some prime targets, we are going to build a database of targets, as well as
their quirks and 'safe' times.

     Some things you will want to be sure to bring are a flashlight, with a
red filter for the lens, and a BIG box.  You can take the box to separate
the good trash from the bad.  It's a good idea to sort through your pile
every now and then and dump what's not useful in some other poor sod's
dumpster.

     Good luck and remember to look before you leap!  I was almost injured
on a board with some nails sticking out of it.  Be careful and have some
idea what you're jumping on or poking through.

     Well, it seems my board is not as supportive of my creative efforts as
I thought.  My partner (Harvester of Sorrow) and I had a brief disagreement
over the subject content of Phirst Amendment and he has refused to carry
some issues of it.  The decision of what issues he decides to carry will be
based on his judgement.  The issues to be found there may not end up being a
complete set.  I assume this means that the issues will only be those
containing no information considered illegal or immoral.  Mainly the board
is used to help people understand virii and prevent them (in fact, when I
get home again I will finish testing my new virus scanner) as well as
express their views on certain areas.  We try not to censor anything written
on the board (within reason) and this does not mean we will start.  We just
don't want to get busted unnecessarily.  The hassle of an arrest would
complicate our lives to an extreme point.

     So now I guess we need a home board to maintain our files again.  This
definitely is a setback this early on, but it can't be helped.  If a few of
you find our issues helpful or interesting then simply pay us back by
sending this issue around as well as to the EFF where anyone can get them.

     Sorry about the inconvenience this may cause, but I can't do much about
it.

                            Review: The Hacker Files 
                            By: Anesthesia
____________________________________________________________________________

     
     For those that haven't heard of it yet, there is a new comic book (it's
about five months old now) called "Hacker Files!".  It is scheduled as a 12
issue maxi series (currently on issue five) and is well worth reading.

     The writer seems to have an unnatural insight on exactly what is going
on in the underground lately.  In fact, they are currently covering the E911
Scandal and Operation Sun Devil [Called Moon Witch in the comic.]  The names
have been changed (to protect the "guilty") but the story line is amazingly
close to the experience as it unfolded.

     The excellent thing about this is that they are showing a different
side to hacking and not condemning it.  Plus, the writing also states things
in ways people will understand that are not involved.  The remarkable
illustrations also assist in this.

     I rate this series very high in my collection and enjoy reading it.
It's a far cry from a Cliff Stoll novel too!  Well worth the effort to find.

     Also, if enough interest is generated in the comic (by sales and
letters) it has been hinted at that it may be extended past its 12 issue
scheduled limit. So ask your local comic shop to carry this fine comic and
give it a try.  I assure you that you will enjoy it.

                             Written by Anesthesia

     I have been expecting this book for a long time.  I was beginning to
think it would never get released.  So I stopped looking for it.  Sure
enough, as soon as I stopped looking for it-it's released.

     Bruce Sterling has long been the "King of Cyberpunk" and it is a well
deserved title.  His current work is not a techno-crime science fiction, but
a true life documentation of the computer underground.

     It begins with an excellent history of the phone company.  I really
enjoyed learning about how the company I love to thrash was started as well
as all it's mutations throughout the many years.

     Then he spends a great deal of well used space discussing the
"definitions" and the " why's" of the many forms of the underground.  This
was an absolute delight to read about some old friends that are both
retired/otherwise gone and still lurking around.  I also like the mention
of the "look but don't harm" hacker ethic that so many people forget about.

     The other major parts of the book cover the opposing side of view.  In
other words, the "might and right" of the law.  I found this part
fascinating as well.  The views expressed show me how outsiders view our
culture.  A view I always love to hear.  It makes for very interesting
debates.

     Although the book is currently only available in hardback, it's well
worth the $23.00 to buy it.  Ask for it at your local bookstore.

System Type: IBM
Software Type: PC Board
Sysop(s): ?
Speeds: 1200/2400/4800/14.4k/57.6k
NUP: NA

Other Info: An excellent board with very diversified interests.  Mainly
concerned with virus research, it does not support piracy, hacking, or
phreaking; so don't ask!  Also has an excellent stock of public domain/
shareware.  Well worth the call.


The following is from an interview with Chuck Price, sysop of Chivalry!
The exclam is part of the name...

[Have you heard of Phirst Amendment?]

Haven't seen it around here...Course I usually only read the 40Hex, Nuke
InfoJournal, CryptLetter, and DA's stuff as its all virus related.  CUD,
Phrack, etc, I usually don't read.

[Why does your board focus mainly on viruses?]
My main focus here, as you'll no doubt see is PD/Shareware stuff.  No elite,
no carding, no phreaking... I do have about 900 or so viruses online in a
PRIVATE conference.  I decide on a case-by-case basis who and what I allow. 
The reasons for this:

1) I believe that all PC users have a right to understand for themselves the
danger of viruses.  It makes me sick to see the overrated threats issued by
the media and software developers cause unnecessary panic among users.  I
feel that it is in the interest of the media to create panic to sell
airtime/readership and it is in the interest of authors to sell software.

2) I also feel that these (authors/media) do not meet the needs of the PC
user in terms of informing them of the threat of viruses.  The true threats
that is.  How can a virus attack a PC?  How can a virus be found?  What
can't a virus do?  There's too many myths and too little information.  Media
likes panic and numbers (stats).  Authors like to say "Buy this and you'll
be fine"  No one says WHY!

[Here Here!  I applaud your action to inform the public at large.  I believe
that you would find 1a.1 and its siblings very informative and supportive of
ideals that you have mentioned.   Publishing the truth rather than hype for
media bucks..  May I use what you've said and may say in an 'interview'
article?]

Sure.  I don't mind a bit.  'Course the good ol' thought police won't like
it.

[Do they ever?!?  So... What's changed?? Not a lot.  I hope that enough
people soon enough, can wake up enough to keep us from killing ourselves
with ignorance...]

No kidding.  Do you have any other questions?  No rush for me, just don't
want to waste your dime.

[I am a volunteer...  What it costs... it costs.  Oh well...  anyway,  I'd
like to 'babble' for lack of a better term about things you'd like to see
change, that kinda thing,  if you've the time and the inclination..]

Sure...I'm really not a revolutionary, everything must change type.  I even
voted for Bush! :)  ...can't win 'em all....but as far as the virus industry
goes.  I see too much of what is in my opinion misleading or false.  And the
companies/authors should and probably do know better.  Example: NOVI an
anti-virus product, claims to be able to catch ALL known and unknown
viruses. Yet the brochure offers that updates to the software are regularly
avail...for $$$ of course.  1) NO software can claim to catch everything new
that comes along.  McAfee's SCAN which catches the most "known" viruses
doesn't even do this.  F-PROT which catches most unknown viruses through
heuristics can be defeated by simple programming techniques.  2) If it did
catch everything, why is it necessary to purchase updates?  In my opinion,
authors get away with too much because consumers and the legal system do not
understand the problem.  A major contributor to this is America's
willingness to believe without seeing.

[Wow... sounds like they're almost 'out to screw us over'.  That the feeling
you get?]

Yes.  Although there isn't malice.  Just a desire for the almighty dollar.

[Oh...  YEAH!   GREED!  I've heard of that...  Big motivator in these here
parts...  I really cannot think of anything specific to ask, as you've
pretty much covered all the bases for me...   Is there any advice, as it
were, that you'd like to give computer users  (our viewing public at this
time...)]

Well, I'm not saying that the products are useless.  Anything that limits
the risk is worthwhile, just maybe not worth the asking price.  The most
important thing to do is to get an understanding for yourself of what
viruses can and cannot do.  The rampant claims of wanton damage wreaked by
viruses, the scare tactics too often employed, need to be seen through.
Your own understanding of your risks and the threats to your data is your
best weapon.  And backup often! :)

[Essentially, Don't just believe everything Big Brother and his consort
Media Man feed you..  See for yourself... Learn about it...  Figure out what
it's about without intervention?]

Absolutely.  And in closing...why are companies that write AV software
afraid of individuals who exchange known viruses?  Is it because they might
infect a few PCs like they claim?  Or is it because they realize that
someday, one of these people could compete with their own product on a level
they are unready to face?

[I really appreciate your time.  I was wondering if you would occasionally
come up with sort of an article dealing with recent developments from your
viewpoint?]

Sure.  My main concern is about viruses and the information regarding them,
but I'd be happy to put together a better article containing what my view
is.

[Excellent.  I think that, regarding viruses, people want to know what's
going on!]

As well they should!


[That concludes our interview of Chuck Price: Sysop and closet idealist]

[Now for my favorite part, where you, our viewing audience, participate in
the discussion...

'Do we have a caller??'
'Good.'
'Caller... are you there?'  (looking upward)]

     Skinhead: The first idea derived from seeing a youth with a shaved head
or even wearing combat boots.  The word "skinhead" is one of violence and
racism.  Thanks to the efforts of tabloid television, all skinheads are
quickly identified.

     This gross assumption is definitely wrong.  Several non-racist skin
factions exist among our American sub-cultures.  SHARPs [Skinheads Against
Racial Prejudice], for example, bear values directly opposite in polarity to
the Aryan groups they're associated with.  The skinheads against racial
prejudice originated in the central Florida area.

     More well known, the Straight-Edge movement denounces violence and
substance abuse, seeking to promote unity among people of all races.

     It is, indeed, difficult at first not to respond as our media's
conditions would have us.  But with a little thought, you can avoid jumping
to the wrong conclusion.  Common sense would denote a Nazi skin by Swastikas
or other symbolage upon his person.  White laces in the boots would
represent belief in White Power.  Straightedgers have a large, black 'X' on
the back of their hand(s).

     Condemning every skinhead is equally atrocious, if not quite as severe,
as the racist actions that tear our society at the seams.

Subject: New Tax Bill Being Debated at 2 a.m. EDT
         October 6, 1992


Just some current events, happening as I write. I'm watching C-SPAN's
coverage of the U.S. House of Reps debate of the "Tax and Urban Aid
Bill."  This is basically the main tax code bill.

It's nearly 2 a.m., Eastern time, though only 11 p.m out here in
California (so I'll be able to watch the circus for a few more hours).

What's shocking--but not surprising--is that nearly all the members
getting up to speak are freely admitting they have almost no idea of
what's in the several hundred page bill! This is the last day of the
session, so they're all sitting there at 2 a.m. (and they may still be
there by the time some of you read this Tuesday morning!), getting
increasingly punchy...the better to debate such a bill, I suppose.

We in the U.S. will be living with the consequences of bills like this
for years, bills written by staffers and unseen by our elected
representatives (not that that would make a huge difference!). Some
taxes are being cut, but others are increasing. Riders are attached to
punish some, reward others. (Needless to say, cutting spending in a
serious way is not considered seriously.)

The old saw is that one should never see sausages--or law--being made.
I disagree--watching how this process operates is highly instructive,
if depressing.

(Final update before I sign off: It's after 2, now, and they're barely
making progress. This may go on 'til dawn. And none of them admits to
knowing what's in the bill!)

Lemme know if there's something you want written up on drugs...  And it'd
help if I had an idea of what you'd like to publish...

And actually, I was thinking that the net needed a virtual mag exactly
like this awhile ago....  weird...

Re: factual

Would you consider more of an opinion piece?  like for example, I've been
thinking of writing one on a presentation of various alternatives to the
drug war, various programs that need to be considered WRT the drug issue
(ie. things like alternative drug treatment programs), various issues that
arise from the pharmacology and neurochemistry of drugs, and finally
issues commonly not considered WRT legalization...

Thanks for sending me that issue.  I take it you want archive space?
If so, looks like no problem.  BTW, many of the lines in that mag are
well over 80 characters and don't really come out too well paging through
it on a Unix machine.  To maintain cross-platform compatibility, I generally
prefer to get stuff saved as text with linebreaks, and lines no longer
than 80 characters.

I can include it in advertisements for the site that I pump out to a
variety of usenet groups, and of course I will u/l it to the local BBSs,
since there are a few elites around here that have interest in that sort of
stuff.  (That's how I keep my ratios up, since I'm not a warez collector.)
I will print out a copy so I can easily tell which lines are too long.

There's currently not any sort of space shortage on the ftp sites, so
I won't have any problem archiving as many as you can send on...
That site is red.css.itd.umich.edu and that's the site that has
a writeable incoming directory, as well as an official EFF/Computer
Underground Digest mirror, and a spot for Factsheet Five.  There's also
a BBS running on it -- you can telnet in and type "bbs" at the login
prompt.  It is not a p/h kind of BBS -- it is just for politics, but you're
welcome to show up if interested.

You should presently find Phirst Amendment on both sites in the
directory /poli/Phirst.Amendment.

being too long for UNIX machines.  We have fixed them.  The content is the

two different versions out there, but no REAL difference.

Dear sir:
   I received, and read with some interest, your "First Amendment"

of political causes to which I am at best indifferent and at worst violently
opposed, I suggest that for the sake of all concerned my name be removed

ADDENDUM:


Apologies:   

It seems that issue #1 was released approximately one year earlier than it
should have been... The issue is dated November 4, 1993...  It really was
released in 1992!

It also seems that some illiterate boob, I have a hunch who it is,
adulterated the copy of 1a.1 that was on my hard drive.  They changed the
tense of some verbs and changed words so that they were misspelled.  This
person also turned many of the indentations of five spaces into tabs, which
some of you have mentioned cause formatting difficulties.  This situation
has been remedied on some sites, but there are some versions out there that
make me look illiterate and incompetent...  It's not my fault!

It appears that Cheap Shades' name was 'bastardized' in the previous bio on
me.  I accidentally called him Cool Shades.  My apologies to Cheap Shades,
and my thanks to Taran King for pointing it out to me.  It's been quite
awhile, and I either said the wrong thing or it got lost in the translation.
But once again, my apologies.

In our first issue mentioned in 'Gnus' that you should write to
'Phrack@StormKing.com.'  This was an error caused by our rushed deadline and
thus our lack of ability to verify the information.  The correct address is
'Listserv@StormKing.com' - this is a wonderful service and we apologize to
the folks at Phrack for this misprint.  Check out Phrack 40 for more details
on the service!


Corrections: I believe I've found another mistake in issue #1.  Our Internet
address was printed, at least once, as DLightman@nyx.cs.du.edu.  It should
be DLightma@nyx.cs.du.edu instead.  This 'abbreviation' is due to the
character limitations on the UNIX system we use.


Want ads:
     In our attempts to secure a larger volunteer staff, we have been asked
what our plans are for future issues.  Well, here they are... along with
their issue numbers and planned date of release.  These are not the end, but
we can only go so far ahead of ourselves.

                        NOTE! on distribution of this file:

     Issue #1 has been circulated quite a bit around a few areas and a bit
on Internet. [eg. England, Germany, Australia]  If you find our articles of
interest then please pass this file around in your local area, as well as
anywhere on any Net you can.  Writing us a letter via Internet will almost
assure future issues directly to you.  We realize that there are many places
on Internet we cannot reach or simply don't know about (please send all
mail-serv's and ftp sites to us) and that's where you can help.

     For most of us, this is free.  We are getting copies out by E-mail,
postal mail, and file transfer.  We cannot spare the time to call everywhere
though.  So we are trying to work out places that this publication can
ALWAYS be found.  If you're interested in carrying it, let us know, we'll be
more than happy to work something out.

info.

     Things can only get more interesting!
