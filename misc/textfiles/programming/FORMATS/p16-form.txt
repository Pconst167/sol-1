Below lists the format of the Protracker Studio 16 (PS16) header.  This can
change if it doesn't allow for enough flexibility for the time being.

Sig                      5  Character  This contains the string "PS16" which
                                         acts as both an identifier to
                                         determine the file, but also serves
                                         as part of the text string which
                                         can be done by TYPEing the file to
                                         the screen.
SongName                75  Character  This contains the 75-character name of
                                         the music file.  This may contain
                                         the MODule name if converted from a
                                         MOD, or it may contain information
                                         on number of channels or whatever.
                                         The final byte, 75, MUST have a ^Z
                                         in it.
TypeOfFile               1       Byte  This field holds what type of music
                                         file the file is.  If this field
                                         contains a 0, then it is a module
                                         with self-contained instruments.
                                         If it is a 1, then it is a song
                                         with the header and patterns, but
                                         not the samples.
CommentOfs               4    Longint  The Comment Offset field points to
                                         the offset of the file where
                                         comments begin.  The comments
                                         contain all text and information
                                         pertinent to the music.  The
                                         sample names are also stored here.
                                         See below for parsing information.
                                         This field DOESN'T need to be
                                         used.  Just store a zero here if
                                         there are no comments.
Version                  1       Byte  This is the version identifier for
                                         the PS16 file.  All versions of
                                         PS16 formats will have the header
                                         structure as described thus far.
                                         The format from here on can change,
                                         although it isn't likely.  The
                                         format described below is a Version
                                         0 format.

NumPatterns              1       Byte  Contains the number of patterns
                                         (max 256) in the file.
totalPatternSize         4    Longint  For quick reads off the disk, the
                                         TOTAL pattern length is stored here.
                                         The maximum total size of patterns
                                         for any given music file is
                                         3075 bytes per pattern * 256 patterns.
                                         With the current player, this is
                                         simply not possible.
SongLen                  1       Byte  This contains the number of sequences
                                         in the PS16 file.
Sequences              128       Byte  These are the sequences for the entire

                                         doesn't support greater than 64k
                                         samples, and I really don't see
                                         the need.  It's here in case it's
                                         needed.
Repeat                   4    Longint  This contains the repeat start for

RepeatLength             4    Longint  This contains the repeat length for
                                         the sample.  If the sample Length
                                         is greater than the sample Repeat
                                         plus the sample RepLen, then the
                                         sample can be clipped to Repeat+
                                         RepLen.  If you didn't get that,
                                         don't worry about it.
C-2 Freq                 2       Word  The default playback frequency of

                                         can be used to fine tune a sample,
                                         but it defaults to 8448.

Immediately following the version 0 header structure are the patterns.  The
reason that the offset of the patterns in the file is not contained in the
header is because it was felt that the patterns would probably not be
relocated.

When converting from the MODule format, this format will always be a minimum
of 253 bytes smaller than the patterns in a MODule.  A MODule's pattern is
always 1,024 bytes.  This is obvious since a MODule note and effect occupies
four bytes, and there are four channels per row.  With 64 rows in a file,
this equation becomes:  4 bytes * 4 channels * 64 rows = 1,024 bytes.

A PS16 note occupies three bytes.  A "note" in PS16 consists of the actual
note, an instrument, and a special effect and its data.

A PS16 note will use the following table to convert from Amiga periods to
its own notes, and they will be stored as such:

A zero is stored in the event a period was not found or approximated or when
there is not an actual period being played.  The note field requires 6 bits.

Version 0 only handles 31 instruments.  Thus, the instrument field requires
5 bits.

The special effect field can range from 0 to F in hexadecimal and requires
4 bits.

The special effects data field is a whole byte and can have 8 bits.

Thus, with this information, we are able to construct the following bitfields:
          Byte  1                  Byte  2                  Byte  3

Bit 7 requires a bit of additional explanation.  As aforementioned, patterns
can be a MINIMUM of 253 bytes smaller than their MOD counterparts.  This is
due to three special compression methods.

One)  Instead of ordering the patterns as Track 1, Track 2, Track 3, Track 4,
        then Track 1, Track 2 again and so on until the end, the Tracks are
        grouped together as all of Track 1 and all of Track 2 and so on.

Two)  If a note appears on row 0 and another note appears on row 5 with
Three)  nothing in between, why not get rid of the blank rows?  For instance,
        a situation such as this may appear as:

           Module Track             MOD Data            PS16 Data
           00  C-1 01 F06          0358 1F06             8D 1F 06

                                  1024 bytes             11 bytes

      Two and three are combined for two reasons.  As can be seen, MODs
        store extra information for blank pattern lines.  This was
        remedied in PS16 by two methods.  If the jump between one line
        and another was greater than one, then the new line number was
        written out (see row 5 of the PS16 Data, first byte).  However,
        if the two lines were right by each other (5 & 6), then the
        pattern row was not written out.

      Here's why.  As you recall from the above diagrams of PS16 notes,
        it can be seen that Bit 7 is named "Follow Previous Line."  This
        means that if the new PS16 line follows the previous line, there
        is no need to store a row number in front.  All that needs be
        done is have this bit set.

      Let's break down the PS16 data from above:

        Row 0: 8D 1F 06    -- Bit 7 is set here.  The first line of a pattern
                              is always assumed to follow Byte 255 (which is
                              what the line counter is initialized).  A byte
                              of 255 plus 1 = 0.  Otherwise, the 0Dh in 8Dh
                              specifies note 0Dh, which is C-1.  The 1F 06
                              specifies instrument 1, special effect F (speed)
                              06.
        Row 5: 05 29 3C 40 -- Since there was a large skip here, and row 5
                              does not immediately follow row 0, the 5 was
                              stored in first here.  How does the interpreter
                              know the difference between a row number and
                              a note?  A note ALWAYS follows a row number
                              and if a row number is not present, then bit 7
                              MUST be set in the note.  Bit 7 is NEVER set
                              in a row except for the ONE exception below.
        Row 6: A9 1A 01    -- Immediately follows Row 5, so bit 7 is set.
        Final
         Byte: FF          -- This is a -1 which means terminate track.

A -1 always terminates the current track.  Bear in mind that ALL 16 tracks
are stored per pattern, so if converting from a MOD, tracks 5-16 are
automatically set to -1.

The discussion thus far has been centered around the general pattern format.
Two other factors are introduced into the PS16 pattern.  The format of a
pattern is this:

        Byte    Name            Description
       ฤฤฤฤฤฤ  ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
         0-1   Size     (Word) Size is the total size of the ENTIRE
                                pattern, INCLUDING bytes 0 through 2.
                                This number is paragraph aligned.  This
                                means that if a pattern is 253 bytes
                                long, its actual size is 256.  If the
                                size is 256, no change takes place.
           2   NumLines (Byte) This is the number of pattern lines in
                                the pattern.  If a pattern only uses
                                30 lines and the pattern must terminate
                                to the next pattern at this point,
                                store a 30 here.  Otherwise, ALWAYS store
                                a 64 so the entire pattern will play.
        3-??   Track           This is Track 1, terminated with a -1.
                                The other tracks follow immediately after
                                this.

Only the digital sample format has been defined thus far.  In order to appeal
to archivers more, the sample storage format has changed.  Instead of being
stored as raw data as in all trackers I am aware of, the format was changed
to use "deltas."  The algorithm for converting a sample to deltas is:

                Get the number of sample bytes to process.
                  Call this SamplesLeft.

                Set Delta counter to 0.

                DO
                  Get a byte from the buffer.
                  Store the byte in Temp.
                  Subtract the Delta counter from the byte.
                  Store it in the buffer.
                  Move the Temp byte into the Delta Counter
                  Decrement SamplesLeft.
                WHILE(SamplesLeft <> 0)

The technique for conversion back to the raw data is:

                Get the number of sample bytes to process.
                  Call this SamplesLeft.

                Set Delta counter to 0.

                DO
                  Get a byte from the buffer.
                  Add onto the byte the Delta Counter.
                  Store the byte in Delta Counter.
                  Store the byte in Temp.
                  Decrement SamplesLeft.

This format resembles an ILBM format.  Only two things are currently defined
in this format.

          INST        Immediately following this four character
                        identifier is a byte indicating the length of
