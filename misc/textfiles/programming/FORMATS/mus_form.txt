1. General Description 
 
 
   A .MUS file is a simple clone of .MID file. It uses the same instruments, 
   similar commands and the same principle: a list of sound events. 
   It consists of two parts: header and body. 
 
 
2. MUS File Header 
 
 
   The MUS header has the following structure: 
 
        struct MUSheader { 
                char    ID[4];          // identifier "MUS" 0x1A 
                WORD    scoreLen; 
                WORD    scoreStart; 
                WORD    channels; 
                WORD    dummy1; 
                WORD    instrCnt; 
                WORD    dummy2; 
        // variable-length part starts here 
                WORD    instruments[]; 
        }; 
 
   NOTE: WORD is a 16-bit unsigned integer (little-endian) 
 
   The header has two parts: the fixed-length and the variable-length parts. 
   The former contains file identifier, score start and length, number of 
   channels and number of used instruments. The latter part is actually 
   a list of used instruments. The instruments are stored as numbers which 
   are arranged in this fashion: 
 
    Instrument Number      Meaning 
        0 - 127           standard MIDI instruments 
      135 - 181           standard MIDI percussions (notes 35 - 81) 
 
   scoreStart is the absolute file position of the score and scoreLen is its 
   length in bytes. Use of 16-bit number as length limits .MUS file size to 
   64KB. 
 
   channels tells you how many channels are utilized in the song. The channel 
   number 15 (percussions) is not included in the sum. 
 
 
3. MUS File Body 
 
 
   Unlike MID files, MUS body contains only one track. File body is 
   a sequence of sound events and time records. A sound event consists of 
   one or more bytes encoded as follows: 
 
   1st byte -- event descriptor: 
         ™7ƒ6ƒ5ƒ4ƒ3ƒ2ƒ1ƒ0ù 
         §Last3  Event type  3  Channel number   § 
         ¢       « 
 
             'Event type' is one of these: 
               0 - release note 
               1 - play note 
               2 - pitch wheel 
               3 - tempo ??? 
               4 - change controller 
               5 - ??? 
               6 - score end 
               7 - ??? 
 
             'Channel number' determines which channel this event refers to. 
 
             'Last' - if set, the event is followed by time information. This 
             means that this is the last event in a group of events which 
             occur at the same time. The time information is a number of 
             ticks to wait before processing next event. One tick is usually 
             1/128 sec (Raptor uses 1/64 sec). 
 
             Time information can be read in this way: 
               1. time = 0 
               2. read a byte 
               3. time = time * 128 + byte AND 127 
               4. if (byte AND 128) go to 2 
               5. return time 
             The time info is a series of 7-bit chunks. The 8th bit is set 
             until the last byte whose 8th bit is zero. This scheme allows 
             small numbers occupy less space than large ones.

          ¢       «  ¢       « 
 
          Note volume is present only if 'Vol' is set. Otherwise the previous 
          value is used and the second byte is not present. 
          NOTE: Each channel keeps track of its own last volume value. 
                More than one note can be played at once in one channel. 
          Channel 15 is dedicated to drums and percussions. Note number acts 
          as an instrument selector there. see Appendix C
