       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                   Introduction
       

       1  Introduction

       1.1  Overview of PopDBF

       PopDBF is a pop-up memory resident program that uses only 4K of RAM!
       PopDBF allows you to  have "Instant Access" to any  dBase compatible
       .DBF database  file.  This  includes, but is  not limited to,  files
       used  by Clipper, dBASE III,  dBASE IV, dBXL,  FoxBASE+, FoxPro, PC-
       File/db and  Quicksilver.  The term  X-base (which is in  the public
       domain) refers to all of the different dialects referred to above.

       Memory resident programs, also call TSRs (Terminate Stay  Resident),
       are special programs that stay in memory after you run them.  To use
       a  memory  resident  program  that  is  in  memory,  you  press  the
       designated hotkey.  It is this hotkey that causes the program, which
       is hibernating in memory, to "spring"  to life and pop-up for you to
       use.

       After PopDBF has  been loaded,  you can access  your database  files
       from  anywhere  by  pressing  the  hotkey  (the  default  hotkey  is
       Alt-BackSpace).  To  return to where  you came  from just press  the
       hotkey again.  It's that simple!

       There  are many  reasons why PopDBF  is the best  tool available for
       accessing your database files.  Some of the reasons include:

            *    Faster than  using dBASE  or  a compatible  program!   You
                 don't have  to wait while  a bulky database  program loads
                 just  to take a quick  look at a  database file.  "Instant
                 Access" means just that - INSTANT!

            *    Easier to use  than dBASE!  You  don't have to know  dBASE
                 commands.   Switching from append  to browse to  edit is a
                 matter of pressing one key!

            *    Access database files without leaving another application!
                 You  no longer have to exit your word processor, load your
                 database program,  look at  the  database file,  exit  the
                 database  program and  reload your  word processor  - just
                 press the PopDBF hotkey!

            *    Cut and Paste  information from a  database directly  into
                 another application!  Save time typing in name and address
                 information  to your word processor - let PopDBF do it for

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                   Introduction
       

            *    Searches on  a database for  ANY text are  lightning fast.

                 in, PopDBF takes care of it for you!


       The applications for PopDBF are just as numerous.  After  just a few
       minutes of using PopDBF you will be thinking up your own ways of how
       to use  its many  features to improve  your productivity.   Here are
       just a few examples to spark your creativity.

            Great for Anybody who uses a phone:

            *    Maintain  and search a rolodex database  of all the people
                 you  know with  their place  of business,  address(es) and
                 phone number(s).   This could  be applied to  any type  of
                 information you need "instant" access to.

            Great for Secretaries and Order Operators

                 the  field  without having  to leave  the program  you are
                 currently running.

            *    Add  an order to the order database or search the database
                 to see the current status of the order.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                   Introduction
       

       PopDBF provides an easy way to move throughout your hard disk(s) and
       networks to find your database files.  It also has context sensitive
       help  for novice (or forgetful)  users, but you  probably won't need
       it.  PopDBF is that easy to use!


       You can use PopDBF to:

            *    pick a database file
            *    delete a database file
            *    view file structure
            *    print file structure
            *    append and edit records
            *    browse records
            *    delete or undelete records
            *    print records (design your own mini-report)
            *    search for strings anywhere in a database
            *    pack or zap a database
            *    specify fields  and  assign  their  order  for  the  above
                 features
            *    view index expressions of index files


       And if you  don't feel comfortable  using memory resident  programs,
       PopDBF has a non-resident  "pass-thru" mode so that  you can run  it
       from the DOS prompt like any other program.

       Programmers can even set  up macros in some program  editors (BOXER,
       Qedit,  etc.) to execute PopDBF  and have it  automatically open the
       database the cursor is positioned on.

       PopDBF has four main areas:

            1.   Pick File
            2.   Setup View
            3.   Browse Records
            4.   Append/Edit Records

       Each of these  areas is described  more fully below  along with  the
       actions available from each.


       1.2  Limitations

       Though PopDBF has many features, it does not do everything, yet!.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                   Introduction
       

       Currently PopDBF does not do the following:

            *    view or edit memo fields
            *    use index  files (it does  display the expression  used to
                 create them)
            *    view more than one database file at a time
            *    handle database files with more 65,535 records
            *    handle fields larger than 254 characters
            *    lock individual records in a database on the network

       Also,  PopDBF is  not  meant to  be a  complete replacement  for the
       relational  database  management  systems  (RDBMS)  many people  are
       currently  using (i.e. dBASE).  In some instances the function being
       done  with the RDBMS can be fulfilled  entirely by PopDBF.  However,
       in general PopDBF  is meant  to enhance those  programs and  improve
       productivity by providing "instant access" to your valuable database
       information.


       1.3  Cautions

       When using PopDBF from  within any RDBMS or application  that allows
       dBASE  compatible records to be changed, it is important to remember
       that  most of  those products  do internal  record buffering.   This
       means that if a record is changed and resides in an internal buffer,
       the change will NOT be reflected when viewed from within PopDBF.

       Likewise, if a record is changed in PopDBF while that same record is
       in an internal buffer,  the change will be overwritten  by the RDBMS
       or application when it  closes the file and/or flushes  the internal
       buffer.

       As a general rule, do not use PopDBF to change records in a database
       that might be opened by an RDBMS or similar application.

       It should also be pointed out that because PopDBF does not currently
       use index files,  no indexes will be updated.   Care should be taken
       when changing databases  that have associated indexes  which need to
       stay up to date.  For these types of databases, as long as you don't
       change  key fields (fields used  to create an  index), add or delete
       records there will be no problem.

       Should  you need to change information in databases falling into the
       category  mentioned  above,  just  make sure  that  you  reindex the
       database.

       1.5  What is "Shareware"

       "Shareware" is a term used to describe a system for distribution  of
       software.   Under  the  shareware concept,  software  may be  freely
       copied and passed along  to others, or distributed  through bulletin
       board systems, etc.

       As a recipient of a shareware program, you may use  the software for
       a short trial  period to determine if  it meets your needs.   If  it
       does, you  pay the registration  fee.   By paying the  fee, you  are

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                   Introduction
       

       granted  the right  to retain  the software  for your  use.   If the
       software is not suitable, then you may discard it.

       The shareware system provides significant benefits to the  computing
       community (of which YOU are a member):
            
            1)   You get to  try out the software BEFORE you  buy it so you
                 know exactly what you're buying.

            2)   Shareware  is  substantially   less  expensive  than  most
                 commercial programs.   You don't pay  for costly marketing
                 programs and fancy packaging.

            3)   You get  access  to  a  MUCH  broader  base  of  available
                 programs.    Thousands  of excellent  programs  have  been
                 written by  expert programmers  who  would never  consider
                 marketing commercially.  Through the concept of shareware,
                 these  people  make  their   programs  available  to   the
                 community.  Usually, all they ask in return is a small fee
                 to  reward them for the  time and effort  they've put into
                 the program.

       The  system is  based entirely  on the  honor system,  and generally
       works  quite well (Most people  are honest and  wouldn't violate the
       trust placed in them by the  author of the software!).  Shareware is
       NOT free software - the author counts on your integrity.   


       1.6  ASP Ombudsman Information

       Bowen Software is an  author member of the Association  of Shareware
       Professionals  (ASP).   ASP wants  to make  sure that  the shareware
       principle  works  for  you.    If  you  are  unable   to  resolve  a
       shareware-related  problem  with an  ASP  member  by contacting  the
       member  directly, ASP may  be able to  help.  The  ASP Ombudsman can
       help  you resolve a dispute or problem  with an ASP member, but does
       not provide technical support  for members' products.  Please  write
       to the  ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box 5786, Bellevue, WA 98006 or send a
       Compuserve message via Compuserve Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                  Getting Started
       

       2  Getting Started

       2.1  Installing PopDBF

       To  load the PopDBF  and its associated  programs and  files on your
       hard  disk, you use the installation program called INSTALL.EXE.  To
       run the installation program, do the following:

            1.   Place the PopDBF diskette in drive A:

            2.   Type A:INSTALL and press ENTER.
                 (If you are using drive B, substitute B: for A: above)

            3.   Make sure that  the name of the installation  directory is
                 correct and press  ENTER.  The  installation directory  is
                 where the PopDBF files  will be copied.  If  the directory
                 you specify does not exist, it will be created.

            4.   You will see the names of each of the files as it is being
                 copied to the  destination directory.  When  all the files
                 have been copied, the  message "press any key..."  will be
                 displayed in the lower  left corner of the screen.   Press
                 any key and you will be returned to DOS and will be in the
                 directory you specified as the installation directory.

       NOTE:     When PopDBF is  executed it assumes  that POPDBF.HLP,  the
                 context sensitive  help file, is in the  same directory as
                 POPDBF.EXE.    If POPDBF.HLP  is  not  in that  directory,
                 context sensitive help will not  be available.  See "Help"
                 on page 21.

       2.2  Executing PopDBF

       PopDBF can be  run in two modes.  Normally,  when PopDBF is executed
       it  installs itself into memory for access from anywhere by pressing
       its  hotkey.   Alternatively,  you  can run  PopDBF  in non-resident
       "pass-thru" mode like any other DOS program.

       2.2.1  Running PopDBF in Memory Resident Mode

       To run PopDBF in memory  resident mode, just type POPDBF at  the DOS
       prompt and press ENTER.  It  is in this mode that PopDBF  can become
       an  invaluable tool.  Once  loaded into memory,  pressing the hotkey
       (the default hotkey is Alt-BackSpace) will give you "instant access"

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                  Getting Started
       

       to your  X-Base files!  See "Command Line Options"  on page 13 for a
       list of configuration options. 

       PopDBF  does  not  need to  be  the  last  memory resident  program.
       However, it can NOT be uninstalled from memory if it is not the last
       memory resident program  or if another  memory resident program  has
       recaptured one of PopDBF's interrupts.

       When PopDBF is installed in memory it requires only 4K of RAM!

       If the /SN command line  option is used to prevent swapping  to disk
       or EMS,  PopDBF will  require around  45K of  RAM.   This  may be  a
       desirable mode if  no EMS is available, the local  hard disk is very
       slow and  most of the lower 640K of RAM is available for application
       programs. 


       2.2.2  Running PopDBF in Non-Resident Mode

       The second mode  of operation is to run PopDBF  in "Pass-Thru" mode.
       In "Pass-Thru" mode, PopDBF  works like most other programs.   To do
       this type POPDBF /p at the DOS prompt and press ENTER.

       In this  mode the hotkey  is ignored.   To exit PopDBF in  this mode
       press the ESCAPE key until you return to the DOS prompt.

       When using this mode, the Ctrl-P paste key in Edit mode is disabled.

       Memory  consumption  in "Pass-Thru"  mode  depends  on command  line
       options, but will default to using 45K of RAM.

        
       2.3  Modifying AUTOEXEC.BAT to Load PopDBF

       To  have PopDBF  load each  time you  start  your computer,  add the
       following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

                 .
                 [path\]POPDBF [options]       <load PopDBF into memory>
                 .

       If the optional path is not  specified, POPDBF.EXE must either be in
       the current directory or in the PATH.

                                  Getting Started
       

       For help on which  options to use  when loading PopDBF see  "Command
       Line Options" on page 13.


       2.4  Removing PopDBF from Memory

       To remove  PopDBF from  memory use  the  /U command  line option  by
       typing the following at the DOS prompt:

            POPDBF /U

       PopDBF must be the last memory resident program or you will  receive
       an error message indicating that  PopDBF was unable to unload.   See
       /U under  "Command Line  Options" below for  further information  on
       this option.


       2.5  How to Invoke PopDBF (Using the "Hotkey")

       By default the hotkey to invoke  PopDBF is Alt-BackSpace.  To invoke
       PopDBF, press and hold  the Alt key and  at the same time  press the
       BackSpace key.

       As soon as you press the hotkey, PopDBF will "pop"  onto the screen.
       Pressing   the  hotkey  again  will  take  you  right  back  to  the
       interrupted program.   You can  pop out  of PopDBF from  anywhere in
       PopDBF,  except a  few  places  when  you  are  being  prompted  for
       information.   At those times,  pressing the hotkey  will abort that
       action just as if you had pressed ESCAPE.

       When you  press the  hotkey to  leave PopDBF,  any open  database is
       automatically  closed.  Pressing the hotkey again will return you to
       the same location in PopDBF with the file being opened automatically
       as if it had  never been closed.  You  can even pop out and  back in
       while in the middle of using Edit or Append!

       2.6  Command Line Options

       To load or execute PopDBF type the following at the DOS prompt:

       PopDBF [options],   where options can be:

       /A<A|B|E|S>    Default action, where:

                      A>ppend <B>rowse E>dit S>tructure

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                  Getting Started
       

                      The  default is to open databases in Browse mode.  To
                      load PopDBF  so that  databases  are opened  in  Edit
                      mode, use the following command line:

                      POPDBF /AE

       /C<C|M|O>      Color scheme, where: 

                      M>ononchrome O>riginal

                      The  original  colors  option is  provided  for those
                      people  who  liked the  colors  used  in versions  of
                      PopDBF before 3.7.

                      To  load or run PopDBF  so that monochrome colors are
                      displayed, use the following command line:

                      POPDBF /CM
        
       /D<dir>        Initial PopDBF Directory

                      The format  of <dir> is  [d:\]path, where  d: is  the
                      optional disk drive identifier.

                      The initial PopDBF  directory is set  to the  current
                      DOS directory the first time PopDBF invoked, if  this
                      option is not specified.

                      The PopDBF directory changes only when a move is made
                      from within PopDBF.  Each time PopDBF is invoked, the
                      current  DOS  directory  is  saved   and  the  PopDBF
                      directory  becomes  the  current  directory.     When
                      leaving PopDBF the  DOS directory is  restored.   See
                      also "Move to Current DOS Directory" on page 28.

                      To load or run PopDBF so that the starting  directory
                      is C:\DBASE, use the following command line:

                      POPDBF /DC:\DBASE

       /E<size>       Edit buffer of size bytes (default = 512)

                      If  a file  has a  record size  larger than  the edit
                      buffer size,  you  will not  be  allowed to  Edit  or
                      Append.   Should this occur an error  message will be

                      displayed.  To  determine the minimum  size that  you
                      will need  to specify to  allow Editing on  the file,
                      press Alt-S to view the record size.

                      To load or run PopDBF  so that you can Edit a  record
                      1024 bytes long, use the following command line:

                      POPDBF /E1024

       /F<num>        Maximum of num fields (default = 64, max = 1024)

                      The  default value should  handle most needs, however
                      Clipper databases can have up to 1024 fields.

                      Should  you try to Browse or Edit a database with too
                      many fields, an error message  will be displayed.  To
                      determine the minimum number of fields you will  need
                      to  specify to  allow Browsing  or Editing  the file,
                      press Alt-S to view the number of fields.

                      To load or run PopDBF so that  you can Browse or Edit
                      a file  with 95  fields,  use the  following  command
                      line:

                      POPDBF /F95

       /G<num>        Maximum of num files (default = 100, min = 3)

                      The default  value  should handle  most  directories,
                      unless  the  file specification  is  changed to  *.*.
                      Files  matching  the  file specification  are  loaded
                      first,  then  any  sub-directories  in   the  current
                      directory.

                      If  too many files are found, you will be notified by
                      an error message that the /G option should be used to
                      correct the problem.   Just press any key to  respond
                      to the  error.   Only the  specified number  of files
                      will be displayed.

       /H             Command line syntax and options

                      This will list all of PopDBF's command line options.
                      You can also specify a single question mark (?).

       /I             Ignore hotkey, toggles on and off

                      To  use this option,  run PopDBF from  the DOS prompt
                      with  this  option.   This can  be  used if  for some
                      reason  you  want   to  disable  the  PopDBF   hotkey
                      temporarily.   To  reactivate the  hotkey  run PopDBF
                      using this option again.

       /L<dir>        Directory where master .FRQ file is located

                      Normally, the frequent  database access list  file is
                      located  in  the   same  directory   as  the   PopDBF
                      executable.  However,  when PopDBF is  loaded from  a
                      Network drive, users will probably want to specify  a
                      local  drive  and  directory  where   their  personal
                      frequent database  access list file  is located using
                      this option.

                      To load  or run  PopDBF and  specify that the  master
                      .FRQ file is located in F:\PUBLIC, use the  following
                      command line:

                      POPDBF /LF:\PUBLIC

       /[!]P[file]    Use "Pass-Thru" non-resident mode

                      This  option will  NOT load  PopDBF into  memory, but
                      will  execute  it and  allow you  to  use all  of its
                      features.

                      If  a  file  is  also  specified  (no  brackets   are
                      necessary), PopDBF will automatically come up in that
                      file  in Browse,  unless  the /A  option  is used  to
                      specify a different action.

                      Pass-Thru mode is indicated on the screen by the word
                      "PASSTHRU"  in the  upper left-hand  corner.   The /P
                      option  can also be used even if PopDBF is already in
                      memory  without  affecting   the  resident   version.

                      Append,  Browse,  Edit, or  Setup.   This  is  a nice
                      feature to use  from batch files, so  that users only
                      have to press ESCAPE once to exit PopDBF.

                      To run PopDBF  in "Pass-Thru" mode and  automatically
                      open C:\DBASE\ROLODEX in Edit mode, use the following
                      command line:

                      POPDBF /AE /PC:\DBASE\ROLODEX

       /R<size>       Read buffer of size bytes (default = 4096)

                      If  a  file's record  size  is larger  than  the read
                      buffer size,  you will not  be allowed to  Browse the
                      file.

                      The larger  the read buffer the  faster scrolling and
                      finding will be done when in Browse and Edit.

                      Specifying  a larger  read  buffer  will  not  affect
                      memory consumption unless PopDBF is run using the /SN
                      option to prevent swapping.

                      To  load or run PopDBF  using a 16K  read buffer, use
                      the following command line:

                      POPDBF /R16184

       /S<D|E|N>      Swap to Disk|EMS|None

                      D for Disk swap, E for EMS swap, N for No swap.

                      If this option is not specified, swapping to EMS will
                      be  attempted  first and  swapping  to  Disk will  be
                      attempted second.  If both fail, no swapping  will be
                      done.

                      If  Disk swapping is done,  it can be  helpful to use
                      the  /X  option  to  specify that  the  swap  file be

                      located on a RAM drive or a Network drive.  This  can
                      greatly decrease swap time.

                      To load PopDBF so that it does disk swapping to a RAM
                      drive  E: and a  swap file name  called POPDBF.SWP in
                      the root directory, use the following command line:

                      POPDBF /SD /XE:\POPDBF.SWP

                      To load PopDBF  so that it does  NOT swap to disk  or
                      EMS and resided entirely in memory, use the following
                      command line:

                      POPDBF /SN

       /T<B,C,I,V,W,Z>
                      Toggle indicator defaults

                      Any  or all  of the  toggle indicator letters  may be
                      specified to override the defaults.  The letters  and
                      the toggle indicator they modify are discussed below.
                      The  /W option should be specified  as /TW.  However,
                      it   will   still   function   to   provide  backward
                      compatibility.

                      B - Borders for fields ON

                      Specifying  this  option  forces  all  finds  to   be
                      successful only if WITHIN field borders.

                      C - Case sensitive

                      Specifying  this  option  forces  all  finds   to  be
                      sensitive to upper and lower case letters.

                      I - Insert mode

                      When  insert   mode  is  on  and   you  are  entering
                      information or  editing a  record, characters to  the
                      right will move to the right as you enter data.

                      V - Verify mode in Edit

                      When  verify mode is on you will be required to press
                      ENTER in Edit to move to the next field.  When verify

                      Specifying this option will cause each database to be
                      opened with read-write access.

                      Z - Zoom the Browse window

                      By default  the Browse window shows  only 12 records.
                      When  zoomed it will show 18 records.  See also "Zoom
                      Browse Window" on page 33.

                      For more  information on toggle indicators,  see "Alt
                      Toggle Keys" on page 23.

                      To load or run  PopDBF so that read-write mode  is on
                      and  finds are  done with  case sensitivity,  use the
                      following command line:

                      POPDBF /TCW    (you can combine options)

       /U             Uninstall (remove) from memory

                      This will remove PopDBF from  memory, but ONLY if  it
                      is the last memory resident program.

                      In some special  cases, even when PopDBF  is the last
                      memory  resident  program it  can't  be removed  from
                      memory.    This occurs  if  another  resident program
                      recaptures one  of the interrupt vectors after PopDBF
                      has  chained into it.  Sidekick is an example of this
                      type of program.

       /X<file>       File name for swapping to Disk

                      If PopDBF swaps to Disk, it can be very beneficial to
                      use  this option  to direct  the swap  file to  a RAM
                      drive  or Network  drive (if  faster than  local hard
                      disk).  This can greatly decrease the swap time.  The
                      default is POPDBF.SWP  in the root  directory on  the
                      current drive.

                      This is very similar to the  Pass-Thru option, but is
                      used for memory resident mode.  This is the file that
                      will be opened when PopDBF is first activated.  It is
                      an especially  nice feature  to  use for  people  who

       Help is  available in PopDBF only  if the file POPDBF.HLP  is in the
       same directory as POPDBF.EXE, the main program.

       While in Help you  can press the up and  down arrow keys as  well as
       PgUp and PgDn  to scroll the help text.   To get out of  Help, press
       ESCAPE.  


       3.1  Generic Help (Alt-F1)

       You can  get generic help about  the system by  pressing Alt-F1 from
       any area of the program.

       The  generic help explains  the Alt Action  and Toggle  Keys and the
       toggle  indicators.  See  "Alt Menu" on  page 22.   It also explains
       cursor and lite-bar movement.


       3.2  Context Sensitive Help (F1)

       Pressing F1  will provide specific help for any area of PopDBF.  The
       help provided is basically the same text found in this manual and in
       some cases is even more thorough.

       Pressing  the Alt  key will show  the Alt  menu on  the status line.
       Releasing the Alt key will restore the previous status line. The Alt
       menu is divided  into two  parts, "Action Keys"  and "Toggle  Keys".
       Pressing Alt  and one of the highlighted  Action Keys will cause the
       appropriate   action  to  occur.    Pressing  Alt  and  one  of  the
       highlighted Toggle Keys will toggle the appropriate indicator in the
       indicator  window located  in  the lower  left  border of  the  main
       window.

       4.1  Alt Action Keys
       Alt Action Keys  will have no effect when responding  to an error, a
       prompt,  or  inside  of Help.    They  also  have  no  effect  while
       positioned on a directory in the Pick File window.

       The Alt Action Keys are:

            Alt-A     Append records  in the current database.   Ignored if
                      file access mode is read-only.

            Alt-B     Browse records  in the current database.   If pressed
                      while in  Edit  or Append  is  the same  as  pressing
                      ESCAPE to  abort.   See "Abort  and Lose Changes"  on
                      page 40.

            Alt-E     Edit records in  the current database.   If the  file
                      access mode  is read-only, Edit acts as a full screen
                      record viewer.

            Alt-P     Pick a  different database or directory.   If pressed
                      while in  Edit  or Append  is  the same  as  pressing
                      ESCAPE to abort.

            Alt-S     Setup View of current database.  If  pressed while in
                      Edit or  Append is  the  same as  pressing ESCAPE  to
                      abort.

       There are potentially 12 other Alt Action keys.  These keys are used
       to access  frequently  used  databases.   For  more  information  on
       Frequent  Database Access keys, see FREQUENT DATABASE ACCESS on page
       28.

       4.2  Alt Toggle Keys
       Alt  Toggle Keys  will function regardless  of where you  are in the
       program.

       The Alt Toggle Keys are:

            Alt-C     Toggles the case  sensitivity indicator between "IC",
                      ignore  case,   and  "CS",  case  sensitive.     This
                      indicator  affects  how the  Find  function does  its
                      search.  See "Find Text" on page 34.

            Alt-D     Toggles  the field border  indicator between "NB", no
                      borders, and  "BO", borders on.   This indicator also
                      affects how the Find function behaves.

            Alt-I     Toggles the insert/overstrike indicator between "IN",
                      insert  mode,  and  "OV",  overstrike   mode.    This
                      indicator affects  how text is placed  into fields in
                      Edit.  It can also be toggled by pressing Insert.

            Alt-M     Toggles the file access mode indicator between  "RO",
                      read-only mode, and "RW", read-write mode.  When  the
                      file access  mode  is  read-only,  you  will  not  be
                      allowed to Edit or Append.

                      On a  NETWORK read-write  mode  will open  files  for
                      EXCLUSIVE access.  Read-only will open files so  that
                      multiple users can have access.  Record level locking
                      is not currently implemented.

                      If opening  a  file  in  read-write  mode  fails,  an
                      attempt  to  open the  file  in  read-only mode  will
                      automatically be made.  If successful, when the  file
                      is  closed, the  mode  will  automatically return  to
                      read-write.

            Alt-F5    Toggle viewing  underlying application screen.   This
                      avoids having to swap out and back.

       6  Pick File (Alt-P)

       Pressing any  letter will  move the  lite-bar to  the first file  or
       directory that begins with  that letter.  Successive presses  of the
       same letter will move to the next file or directory that begins with
       that  letter.   If  no  file or  directory  begins  with the  letter
       pressed, no movement will occur.


       6.1  Select Directory/File/Index (Enter)

       Pressing ENTER will cause one of the following to occur: 

            *    If  the file  is  a  directory,  you  will  move  to  that
                 directory.  Once in that directory the Pick File window is
                 refreshed  with the  names of  files that  match the  file
                 specification.

            *    If the file is a database, the action taken corresponds to
                 the currently  specified  Action  letter.    This  can  be
                 changed  by pressing  F5 (see  "Change Default  Action" on
                 page 27).  It is the same as pressing Alt-<action letter>.

            *    If the  file is an index (.NDX, .IDX, .NTX only), you will
                 view  the index  expression used  to create  it.   You can
                 press Ctrl-I to change the file specification to show only
                 index  files.    Pressing  Ctrl-B  will  change  the  file
                 specification back to show only database files.


       6.2  Move to Parent Directory (BackSpace)

       Pressing  BackSpace will  take  you to  the  parent of  the  current
       directory, unless you  are currently  in the root  directory.   This
       feature is especially useful on a network, where no parent directory
       will be shown in the Pick File window, but the function still works.
       The lite  bar will be  positioned on the  name of the  directory you
       came from.


       6.3  Change Directory and/or Drive (F2)

       Pressing  F2 will allow you  to change the  current PopDBF directory
       and/or drive.  The name supplied can be a drive letter followed by a

       colon   (C:),   a   directory   path   (\DBASE\PAYROLL),   or   both
       (C:\DBASE\PAYROLL).

       If the new directory is invalid, an error message will be displayed.
       If it is valid the  file selection window will be filled  with files
       matching the current file specification.


       6.4  Enter A Specific File (F3)

       Pressing  F3 will allow you to  enter a specific file  name.  If the
       file is  not found or  is not  a valid database  or index,  an error
       message  will be  displayed.    If  no  extension  is  entered,  the
       extension  in the file specification will be  used.  This will cause
       an error  if that extension contains  a wildcard (*/?) and  you will
       need to enter the file extension as well.


       6.5  Change File Specification (F4)

       Pressing  F4 will allow you to modify the file specification located
       in   the  upper  right  corner  of   the  main  window.    The  file
       specification is used to determine which files in the current PopDBF
       directory  you  are  allowed   to  pick  from.    Entering   a  file
       specification of *.* will  allow you to pick  from all files,  while
       *.DBF will allow only files with an extension of .DBF.

       The names of any sub-directories in the current PopDBF directory are
       included   for   possible   selection   regardless   of   the   file
       specification.


       6.6  Change Default Action (F5)

       The current default action is displayed in the upper left portion of
       the  file  selection window.    The default  action  determines what
       happens when  you press Enter  and the selection  bar is on  a valid
       database file.  Each press of F5 will change the action as follows:

       Append -> Browse -> Edit -> Setup -> Append, etc.

       The result is the same as holding the Alt key and pressing the first
       letter  of the  appropriate action.   You  can override  the default
       action by  holding the Alt  key and pressing a  different action key
       while the lite bar is positioned on the desired database.

       6.7  Delete File (F6)

       Pressing F6  will allow you to delete a file.   You will be asked to
       verify that you really want to delete  the file.  If you answer with
       a Y for yes, the file will be deleted.  Pressing ESCAPE or N for no,
       will cancel the delete.

       When the lite bar is on a directory, this function is ignored.


       6.8  Move to Current DOS Drive & Directory (F10)

       Pressing  F10  will move  you to  the  current DOS  directory.   The
       current DOS directory is the directory you were in before the PopDBF
       hotkey was pressed or when you  loaded PopDBF.  If that directory is
       on  a drive  other than the  current drive,  that drive  becomes the
       current drive as well.

       This is a  handy function to use when you want to move from wherever
       you were using PopDBF last to the directory where you are currently.


       6.9  Frequent Database Access (Alt-1 thru Alt-=)

       To use  this feature  you must  have already  created an  ASCII file
       named  POPDBF.FRQ containing the names  of up to  12 frequently used
       databases.  Multiple POPDBF.FRQ  files can exist.  PopDBF  will look
       first  in the current directory and then in the directory from which
       it was executed, unless the /L  option was specified on the  command
       line.

       Each database name can include a drive identifier and path.  It MUST
       include  file  name and  extension.   Optionally,  each file  can be
       preceded  by an  action letter  and a  space.   See  "Change Default
       Action" on page 27 for more information on action letters.

       Pressing Alt-1 will access the  database whose name is on the  first
       line of this file, Alt-2 will access the second, and so on.  If more
       than 12 lines are included POPDBF.FRQ they are ignored.

       Examples of lines in POPDBF.FRQ:

       C:\ME\DBF\ROLODEX.DBF         (use default action)
       E C:\PERSONAL\MILEAGE.DBF     (open database in Edit mode)

       A MILEAGE.DBF                 (open database in Append mode)

       Using this feature while in the middle of Edit or  Append, will save
       any current changes.

       The  mode and current record number is maintained on each frequently
       accessed database.   If you press  Alt-1, then go off  and use other
       files and  press Alt-1 again you  will be returned to  the same mode
       and positioned at the same record.  This is very  handy for toggling
       between any of the 12 possible frequent databases.


       6.10 Show Names of Frequently Accessed Databases (Ctrl-N)

       Pressing Ctrl-N will pop  up a window to show the names of the files
       in  the current frequent  database access file.   Each  name will be
       preceded by  an action letter, if it  was specified.  Currently, you
       can not change these names from within PopDBF.


       6.11 Program Information

       Pressing Ctrl-H will pop up  a window to show you the version of the
       context sensitive help  file, along with other information on PopDBF
       and Bowen Software.

       7  Setup View (Alt-S)

       Setup View can be used to create a customized view  of the currently
       opened database.  You can select only the fields you want to view in
       Browse or Edit.  You can even order the fields differently than they
       are  physically laid  out  in  the  database.    This  ordering  (as
       described below) is not permanent.

       Pressing any letter  will move the lite-bar to the  first field that
       begins with that letter.  Successive presses of the same letter will
       move  to the next field that  begins with that letter.   If no field
       begins with the letter pressed, no movement will occur.


       7.1  Return To Data (Enter)

       Pressing ENTER  will  return you  to either  Browse or  Edit/Append,
       depending on which you were in last.  This makes  changing the Setup
       View (by pressing  Alt-S) and returning to  data (Browse or  Edit) a
       little easier.


       7.2  Number/Un-Number Fields (Space)

       Pressing  the  SPACE bar  will  number/un-number  the field  at  the
       selection bar.   If any fields are numbered, only  those fields will
       be shown when  you Browse or  Edit records.   The number beside  the
       field determines  the order  in  which it  will be  displayed.   Two
       fields  with  the  same number  will  remain  in  the same  relative
       position to each other.

       Pressing SPACE will automatically move the selection bar down to the
       next field, unless it is on the last field.


       7.3  Clear Field Numbers (F2)

       Pressing  F2  will  clear all  field  numbers,  but  leave the  file
       structure  in the  present order.   This means  that you  can assign
       field numbers,  press F4 to  order the fields,  and then remove  all
       field  numbers by  pressing F2.   This  will allow  you to  view all
       fields but in  an order different from the original.   Field numbers
       are also  cleared when  a new  file is selected  from the  Pick File
       window.

       7.4  Assign a Specific Field Number (F3)

       Pressing F3 will allow you to assign a specific number (0-1024) to a
       field to  affect its  order.   Assigning a  zero will  un-number the
       field.


       7.5  Order Fields Using Field Numbers (F4)

       Pressing F4 will reorder the fields in  the structure based on their
       field  numbers.   THIS  NEW ORDER  IS  NOT  PERMANENT.   The  actual
       structure  of the  file on  disk is  NOT affected.   To  restore the
       original field order either return  to the Pick File window  and re-
       select the  file or clear all field numbers by pressing F2 and press
       F4 again.


       7.6  Tag/Un-Tag Field for Exclusive Find (F6)

       Pressing  F6  will tag/un-tag  the field  at  the selection  bar for
       exclusive find.  When any fields are tagged for exclusive find, only
       those fields are used when doing a Find or Find Next from Browse  or
       Edit.   Also,  if the  field  border indicator  is  on (see  "Toggle
       Indicators Summary" on page 24), the text being searched for MUST be
       found entirely within  ONE field.   For more  information see  "Find
       Text" on page 34.

       Pressing  F6 will automatically move  the selection bar  down to the
       next field, unless it is on the last field.


       7.7  Clear Exclusive Find Tags (F7)

       Pressing  F7  will turn  off the  exclusive  find indicator  for all
       fields.

       This will  allow Find and Find  Next to locate text  anywhere in the
       record, unless  field  borders are  on,  in which  case it  must  be
       entirely within ONE  field.   Exclusive find tags  are also  cleared
       when a new file is selected from the Pick File window.

       Pressing  F8  will  allow you  to  copy  the  current database  file
       structure  to another  file.    You will  be  prompted  for the  new
       database file name.  Pressing  ESCAPE will abort this function.   If
       any fields are  marked, only  those fields, and  in their  specified
       order, will be copied.

       If the specified file already exists, you will be asked  if you want
       to overwrite it.  NO CHECK IS DONE TO INSURE THAT YOU DO NOT SPECIFY
       THE SAME FILE YOU ARE CURRENTLY VIEWING.


       7.9  Print the File Structure (F9)

       Pressing F9  will  print the  file  structure.   If any  fields  are
       numbered only those fields will be printed.  The file statistics are
       printed first followed by the field structure.

       8.1  Current Record and Delete Status

       The current record  number and  delete status are  displayed in  the
       bottom border of the Browse window.  See below for directions on how
       to delete a record.


       8.2  Toggle Vertical Separator Bars On/Off (Shift-|)

       Pressing Shift-| (pipe  symbol) will toggle  the vertical  separator
       bars on  and off.   The default  is off.   Viewing can  be a  little
       easier with them  on, but printing is best done  with the separators
       off.


       8.3  Pan the Browse Window (LeftArrow/RightArrow)

       The  LeftArrow and RightArrow will allow you  to pan to the left and
       right, respectively.


       8.4  View Large Fields (Tab/Shift-Tab)

       Tab  and Shift-Tab change  the offset of fields  that are wider than
       the Browse  window.  The offset is  incremented or decremented by 10
       characters.  The current offset is displayed in the upper right-hand
       corner of the Browse window.


       8.5  Zoom the Browse Window (F2)

       Pressing F2  will either expand or contract the Browse window.  When
       expanded  the window shows 18 records and when contracted shows only
       12, but has the advantage of allowing you to see the file statistics
       as well.


       8.6  Goto a Specific Record (F3)

       record.


       8.7  Zap Database (F4)

       Pressing F4  will Zap  the current  database.   When  a database  is
       zapped,  all records are  deleted AND  physically removed.   Because
       this  is potentially a dangerous  function, you will  be prompted to
       make sure you  really want to zap the database.   Pressing ESCAPE or
       entering N will abort.  If the database is currently opened in read-
       only (RO) mode, this function will cause an audible beep.


       8.8  Pack Database (F5)

       Pressing F5  will Pack the current database.  When a file is packed,
       all logically deleted records are physically removed.  Because  this
       is  potentially a dangerous function,  you will be  prompted to make
       sure  you really  want to  pack the  database.   Pressing ESCAPE  or
       entering N will abort.  If the database is currently opened in read-
       only (RO) mode, this function will cause an audible beep.

       8.9  Find Text (F7)

       Pressing F7 will prompt you for the text you want to locate.
       Type in the text to find and press ENTER to begin the find.

       Memo fields are not currently searched.

       Date fields  need to be  searched as follows.   If the date  you are
       looking  for is  11/03/89 you  would  enter: "891103"  or "19891103"
       (don't enter the quotes).

       When  the case sensitivity indictor  is off (IC)  finding "don" will
       locate records containing "Don", "DON", and other combinations.   To
       find only  occurrences of  "don", you  must first  turn on  the case
       sensitivity indicator (CS) by pressing Alt-C.

       There may be times that you want to find text only if it occurs in a
       specific field  or fields, not just  anywhere in the record.   To do
       this press Alt-S for the Setup View window.   Now tag the fields you
       want searched exclusively by pressing F6.   When you have tagged the
       fields  to be searched, press ENTER  to return to the Browse window.
       Now Find will search only the fields you tagged.

                                  Browse Records
       

       By  default,  Find  will  locate  text  even  if  it  crosses  field
       boundaries.   To prevent  this  you can  turn  on the  field  border
       indicator  by pressing Alt-D.  When field  borders are on (BO), text
       must be  found entirely within ONE  field.  Field borders  are on by
       default.

       Find can also  be used to locate deleted records.  Do a find for "*"
       and  make sure that  field borders are  off (NB) and  no fields have
       been tagged for exclusive find.  This will only work  if an asterisk
       is not actually found in one of the database fields.

       Find always begins  with the first  record in the  file.  See  "Find
       Next  Occurrence of  Text" below  to see  how to  start Find  at the
       current record.

       If Find fails an audible beep will sound.


       8.10 Find Next Occurrence of Text (F8)

       Pressing F8 will do a  Find Next.  Find Next always  begins with the
       next record in the file.

       To  start a Find at the current record you can use Find Next.  Press
       F7 and  enter the text  to find  and then press  ESCAPE.   This will
       cause  the find  text window  to disappear.   Now  press F8  and the
       search will begin at the next record.

       If Find Next fails an audible beep will sound.


       8.11 Print Records (F9)

       Pressing F9 prompts for  print parameters and then prints  the data.
       The parameters you will be asked for are the starting record, ending
       record,  if only records matching the find  text should be used, and
       the width of the print line.  Data is printed exactly  as it is seen
       in the Browse window, but more text may be printed if a longer print
       width is specified (this is how you print the additional data to the
       right of the Browse window).

       Print can be used in conjunction with the find text  string to print
       only  records that  contain  certain text.    Find behaves  here  as
       described above under "Find Text".

       The maximum print width is 250 characters.


       8.12 Turn Century On/Off (Ctrl-K)

       Pressing Ctrl-K will  toggle the century  on or off.   When on,  the
       year  of the  date displays  using four  positions as  in MM/DD/YYYY
       (unless the date format was changed using the configuration program)
       to show the century.


       8.13 Mark Record as Deleted (Ctrl-U)

       Pressing Ctrl-U will toggle the delete status of the current record.
       The delete status  of the current record is displayed  in the bottom
       border of the Browse (and Edit) window.  See  "Find Text" on page 34
       for a tip on how to find deleted records.

                                Edit/Append Records
       

       9  Edit/Append Records (Alt-E/Alt-A)


       9.1  Copy a Record (F2)

       Pressing F2 will prompt you for the number of the record you want to
       copy into  the current record.   To append a duplicate  of a current
       record you  must first go into Append by pressing Alt-A.  Then press
       F2 and specify the  number of the record to  copy.  To complete  the
       operation, press PgDn.

       Pressing Ctrl-F2  will also  copy a record,  but will  use the  last
       record you specified to be copied instead of prompting you.  


       9.2  Goto a Specific Record (F3)

       Pressing  F3 works  the same  as it  does in  Browse.   See "Goto  a
       Specific Record" on page 33.


       9.3  Cut Field into Keyboard Paste Buffer (F4)

       Pressing F4 will  "cut" the  current field into  the keyboard  paste
       buffer for  later pasting  inside PopDBF  (using Ctrl-P)  or outside
       PopDBF  (using  Ctrl-Alt-P).   If  data  has  been  cut it  will  be
       indicated by a "P" in the upper right border of the Edit window.

       Trailing blanks are not cut.  Each cut field is terminated by a user
       selected key.  The termination key  is placed into the paste  buffer
       after  the cut  field, unless  it  is ESCAPE.    If a  comma (,)  is
       pressed, an additional space is placed in the paste buffer after it.
       This is  for  use  with  City, State  cuts,  as  well  as  Lastname,
       Firstname cuts.

       If  there is not enough  room to cut the  current field, a beep will
       sound indicating that the field was NOT placed into the buffer.

       The  entire  contents of  the keyboard  paste  buffer can  be pasted
       inside  PopDBF using Ctrl-P or into  an underlying application using
       the  paste  hotkey Ctrl-Alt-P  (the default).    Data can  be pasted
       multiple times.

                                Edit/Append Records
       

       The keyboard  paste buffer  is cleared  when a cut  is made  and the
       previous paste buffer had been pasted at least once.  It can also be
       pasted by pressing Shift-F4.


       9.4  Clear Keyboard Paste Buffer (Shift-F4)

       Pressing Shift-F4 will clear the keyboard paste buffer.

       If data has been cut into the keyboard paste buffer, it is indicated
       by a  "P" in the  upper right border  of the Edit window.   Pressing
       Shift-F4 will turn this indicator off.


       9.5  Find Text (F7)

       Pressing F7 works the same as it does in Browse.  See "Find Text" on
       page 34.


       9.6  Find Next Occurrence of Text (F8)

       Pressing F8 works  the same as it  does in Browse.   See "Find  Next
       Occurrence of Text" on page 35.


       9.7  Print Records (F9)

       Pressing  F9 will prompt you for the print parameters and then print
       the data.  Data is printed exactly as it appears  in the Edit/Append
       window.  Blank fields product blank lines.

       The extra  lines parameter can be  used to print labels  even if the
       data you are  using doesn't fill up all the lines  on the label.  It
       defaults to one to space between records (or labels).

       Records requiring  multiple pages  of fields  currently  have to  be
       printed separately.

       Print can be used in conjunction  with the find text string to print
       only  records that  contain  certain text.    Find behaves  here  as
       described above.

       9.8  Field Information (F10)


       Pressing  F10 will pop-up a window  containing information about the
       field  in which the  cursor is  currently positioned.   This  can be
       helpful if you  forget the field  type or want  to know exactly  how
       long it is.


       9.9  Restore Field Data (Ctrl-J)

       Pressing  Ctrl-J will restore the  field's original data.   Once you
       have  moved  to another  record any  changes  that were  made become
       permanent and can NOT be restored.


       9.10 Turn Century On/Off (Ctrl-K)

       Pressing Ctrl-K  works the  same as  it does in  Browse.   See "Turn
       Century On/Off" on page 36.


       9.11 System Date (Ctrl-M)

       Pressing Ctrl-M while in a date  field will place the system date in
       the field.   It will only work  in a character field  if enough room
       remains from  the cursor  to the end  of the  field.   It will  also
       overwrite any existing data in the field at those positions.


       9.12 Move to Last Field Position (Ctrl-N)

       Pressing Ctrl-N will move  the cursor to the last  possible position
       in a field.


       9.13 Restore Entire Record (Ctrl-O)

       Pressing Ctrl-O will restore the entire record's original data.  See
       "Restore  Field Data" above for  when changes in  the current record
       become permanent.

       9.14 Paste Data (Ctrl-P)

       Pressing Ctrl-P will paste  any data currently in the  Paste buffer.
       If  there is data  to paste,  a "P" will  be displayed  in the upper
       right border of the Edit window.

       This feature  can be  used to  copy information from  one part  of a
       record to another or from one record to  another.  You can even copy
       data from a record in one database to a record in another database.


       9.15 Abort and Lose Changes (Ctrl-Q/ESCAPE)

       Pressing Ctrl-Q or ESCAPE  will quit Edit and abort any changes made
       to  the current record will be lost.   If any changes have been made
       you will be asked if you want to lose  the changes.  Pressing ESCAPE
       will  abort and leave you in Edit.  Pressing N will save the changes
       and then  exit, while pressing Y  will exit and the  changes will be
       lost. 


       9.16 Mark Record as Deleted (Ctrl-U)

       Pressing Ctrl-U will toggle the delete status of the current record.
       The  delete status of the current record  is displayed in the bottom
       border of the Edit (and Browse) window.   See "Find Text" on page 34
       for a tip on how to find deleted records.


       9.17 Toggle Verify Mode On/Off (Ctrl-V)

       Pressing Ctrl-V will toggle verify mode.  When verify mode is on you
       will be forced to press ENTER to move on  to the next field.  Verify
       mode is indicated  by a "V"  in the upper right  border of the  Edit
       window.

       9.18 Quit and Save Changes (Ctrl-W/Ctrl-End)

       Pressing Ctrl-W or Ctrl-End will quit Edit and save any changes made
       to the current record.


       9.19 Blank Current Field (Ctrl-Y)

       Pressing Ctrl-Y will fill the current field with spaces.

       9.20 Blank to End of Field (Ctrl-Delete)

       Pressing Ctrl-Delete will delete from the current cursor position in
       the current field to the end of the field.


       9.21 Move to End of Data (End)

       Pressing  the  End key  will  move  the cursor  to  the  first blank
       position after any data entered in the current field.  If the entire
       field is full, the cursor will move to the last position.


       9.22 Move to First Position (Home)

       Pressing the  Home key will move the cursor to the first position of
       the current field.


       9.23 Move Word (Ctrl-LeftArrow/Ctrl-RightArrow)

       Pressing Ctrl-LeftArrow or Ctrl-RightArrow will move one word to the
       left or right, respectively.  You can also use the Wordstar commands
       Ctrl-A and Ctrl-F to do the same functions.


       9.24 Move to First/Last Field (Ctrl-UpArrow/Ctrl-DownArrow)

       Pressing Ctrl-UpArrow and Ctrl-DownArrow will move  to the first and
       last field respectively, on the current screen.


       9.25 Previous Record/Next Record, Same Page (Alt-PgUp/Alt-PgDn)

       Pressing  Alt-PgUp or  Alt-PgDn will  move to  the previous  or next
       record, but  stay on the  same page.   This is  very helpful when  a
       database has more fields than will fit on one page.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                 Common Questions

       10  Common Questions and Answers

       10.1  How can I change the PopDBF hotkey?

            You  can change both the  main PopDBF hotkey  (defaults to Alt-
            Backspace)  and the  Paste hotkey  (defaults to  Ctrl-Alt-P) by
            using the PopCFG configuration program.

       10.2  Why doesn't PopDBF pop up in the right directory?

            By default PopDBF pops  up in the first directory in  which the
            hotkey is  pressed.  To  load PopDBF  so that it  pops up in  a
            specific directory, regardless of where you  are when you first
            press  the hotkey, use the /D<dir>  command line option (POPDBF
            /Dc:\dbase).

       10.3  Why are files always opened in Browse mode?

            PopDBF  uses the  default action, displayed  in the  upper left
            corner of the  Pick File  window, whenever a  database file  is
            selected.  To  change the default action you can  press F5 from
            the  Pick File window or use the /A<action> command line option
            (POPDBF /Ae).

       10.4  Why doesn't PopDBF display on my Monochrome monitor?

            If you have problems getting PopDBF to display on your monitor,
            use  the /Cm option to  force PopDBF to  use monochrome colors.
            You  could also  use  the configuration  program  to force  the
            current colors to be monochrome.

       10.5  How can I change the PopDBF colors?

            To  change the PopDBF colors  you use the configuration program
            PopCFG.

       10.6  How can I use my extended memory?

            Load  the  device driver  RAMDRIVE.SYS or  VDISK.SYS, following
            directions in your  DOS manual.   Then use the /X  command line
            option and specify the name of  the swap file on the RAM drive.
            This will cause PopDBF to swap in and out exceptionally fast.

       10.7  How can I limit displayed fields in Edit or Browse?

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                 Common Questions

            After selecting a  database file,  press Alt-S to  go to  Setup
            View.  To mark the fields you want to use press the  SPACE bar.
            Press F4 to see the  order the fields will be displayed  in and
            use F3 to change the order to suit your needs.

       10.8  Why does PopDBF hang when I pop it up on a network?

            When  loading PopDBF in memory resident mode, it must be loaded
            after any network TSR programs (i.e. IPX, NET3, RPRINTER).

            PopDBF  can be loaded first  if it resides  entirely in memory.
            This can be done using the /SN switch.

            When  loading PopDBF  in  swap  mode (to  disk  or EMS)  it  is
            important  to  load it  AFTER programs  which  must be  able to
            operate at all times.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual

       11  Error Messages

       11.1  Too many files, Re-install using new /G parm.

            The default  number of files that  will fit into the  Pick File
            window is 100.  This  can be changed using the /G  command line
            option.   Another way to avoid this  error message is to change
            the default file  specification to something  other than  *.DBF
            (which is the default).

       11.2  Too many fields, Re-install using new /F parm.

            The default maximum number of fields a file can have is 64.  To
            change this  use the  /F command  line option.   Until this  is
            fixed, you will  not be  able to load  any databases that  have
            more fields than were specified (64 if none specified).

       11.3  EDIT buffer too small, Re-install using new /E option.

            If the record size of a database is larger than the Edit buffer
            size you  will not be allowed to Edit the database.  To correct
            this  problem, press Alt-S to see the record size and reinstall
            PopDBF using the /E command line option.

       11.4  READ buffer too small, Re-install using new /R option.

            If the  read buffer size is  smaller than the record  size of a
            database, you will not be  allowed to Browse or Edit the  file.
            To correct this problem, press Alt-S to see the record size and
            reinstall  PopDBF using the /R command line option.  A multiple
            of  at  LEAST  12  times  the size  of  the  biggest  record is
            recommended.

       11.5  Not a dBASE compatible file.

            If this message is displayed, the first byte of the file is not
            one of the following:

       12  Configuring PopDBF

       The program PopCFG is provided  to allow customized configuration of
       the  PopDBF  program.   You can  use  PopCFG to  change  the colors,
       date/number formats, hotkeys and paste options.

       To execute  the PopDBF  configuration  program, type  the  following
       command line at the DOS prompt:

            POPCFG

       To force monochrome  attributes use  the command line  option /M  by
       typing the following command line at the DOS prompt:

            POPCFG /M

       12.1  The Configuration Main Menu

       ------| Configuration Options |------
       |  Colors                           |
       |  Date/Numbers Formats             |
       |  main Hotkey                      |
       |  Paste Options                    |
       |  Quit - Do NOT Save Changes       |
       |  eXit - Save Changes              |
       -------------------------------------

       To  execute any menu  option, type the first  capital letter in that
       option  or move  the selection bar  using the  arrow keys  and press
       ENTER.

       If you  press ESCAPE  or select  the Quit option  from the  menu and
       changes have been  made, you  will see  the prompt  "Abort and  lose
       changes [N]?".   To quit and  lose changes you  must then press  the
       letter "Y".  Pressing ENTER or the letter "N" will return you to the
       main menu.

       Changes made using  the configuration program  are written  directly
       into the POPDBF.EXE file.


       12.2  Configuring Colors

       To  change colors  use the  up  and down  arrow keys  to change  the
       category.   Use the left  and right arrows to  change the foreground
       color.  Use Ctrl-left  and Ctrl-right (press  and hold the Ctrl  key

                                Configuring PopDBF

       and then press the left or right arrow key) to change the background
       color.  
       To restore the  default color  for the current  category, press  the
       letter "D".  The  default color is the "factory default", meaning it
       is the way PopDBF was when you first received it.

       To  restore the  color  for  the  current category  to  what  it  is
       currently in the POPDBF.EXE file, press the letter "O".

       To restore all "factory default" colors, press the letter "R".

       Press ESCAPE when you are done making color changes to return to the
       main menu.


       12.3  Configuring Date/Number Formats

       ---------- Date/Number Formats ----------
       | Date Format:  U.S.        (MM/DD/YY)  |
       | date Separator:  /                    |
       | decimal Point:  .                     |
       | Return to Main Menu                   |
       -----------------------------------------
             press ENTER to toggle an option

       The date format rotates through one of the following:
            U.S.          (MM/DD/YY)
            ANSI          (YY/MM/DD)
            European      (DD/MM/YY)

       The date separator  toggles between a slash (/), dash (-) and period
       (.).   When the separator  is changed the  format correctly reflects
       what the date will look like in PopDBF.

       The decimal point toggles between a period (.) and comma (,).

       Press "R" or ESCAPE to return to the main menu.


       12.4  Configuring Main Hotkey

       The main PopDBF hotkey defaults to Alt-Backspace.  It can be changed
       to almost any key combination.  At least one  of the shift keys, Alt
       or Ctrl must be  included.  It can include Alt, Ctrl  and both shift
       keys, but must include at least one of those keys.

       PopDBF                                                 User's Manual
                                Configuring PopDBF

       The left  and right shift  keys are treated  differently.   Left and
       right Alt and Ctrl keys are treated as being the same key.

       After selecting this option you will see:

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       | Main Hotkey Selection: <Alt>Backspace                           |
       |                                                                 |
       | Enter new hotkey selection (press ESCAPE to cancel):            |
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

       Of  course the main hotkey  selection will display  the current main
       hotkey, which may be different if you have changed it.

       To cancel changing the hotkey, press ESCAPE at this point.

       After you  have pressed the  new main hotkey,  you will be  asked to
       confirm  your selection.    Press "Y"  if  the hotkey  selection  is
       correct.  Press "N" or ESCAPE if you want to change your selection.

       NOTE:     Though it is  possible to have <LShift>A  or other similar
                 keys  as the PopDBF hotkey, it is recommended that this be
                 avoided.


       12.5  Configuring Paste Options

       ---------| Paste Options |---------
       | Paste Rate                      |
       | Paste Frequency                 |
       | Paste Hotkey                    |
       | Return to Main Menu             |
       -----------------------------------

       Changing the paste rate, affects the number of keys that are  pasted
       per timer tick.  This is a  number between 1 and 15 and defaults  to
       15, the maximum paste rate.

       Changing the paste frequency determines how many timer ticks to wait
       between  each group of pasted keys.   There are 18.2 timer ticks per
       second.  The  default is 0, which means keys  are pasted every timer
       tick.   This can  be any value  between 0 and  255 (approximately 14
       seconds).

       Changing  the paste hotkey is the  same as changing the main hotkey.
       See "Configuring Main Hotkey" above.
