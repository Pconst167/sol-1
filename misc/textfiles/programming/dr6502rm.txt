	   Several  files  summarizing information about the 6502 software
      simulator the 6502 project board are presented.   These  files  were
      created  to  give  the  student FREE information to supplement other
      available sources of information.

	   If read in  the  order  presented  below  in  conjunction  with
      actually  trying  the  examples  or  processes  described, a student
      should gain a working knowledge of the 6502, the simulator  and  the
      software  development process.  Such a knowledge is essential before
      a student can efficiently manipulate code and produce  the  required
      software component of the design.
