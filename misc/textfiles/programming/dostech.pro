SOME HISTORY

 Development of MSDOS/PCDOS began in October 1980, when IBM began searching 
the market for an operating system for the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC.
Microsoft had no real operating system to sell, but after some research licensed
Seattle Computer Products' 86-DOS, which had been written by a man named Tim 
Paterson for use on the company's line of 8086, S100 bus micros. This was 
hurriedly polished up and presented to IBM for evaluation. IBM had originally 
intended to use Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which was the industry
standard at the time. Folklore reports everything from obscure legal 
entanglements to outright snubbing of the IBM representatives by Digital,
irregardless, IBM found itself left with Microsoft's offering of "Microsoft Disk
Operating System 1.0". An agreement was reached between the two, and "IBM PC-DOS
1.0" was ready for the introduction of the IBM PC in October 1981. IBM subjected
the operating system to an extensive quality-assurance program, found well over
300 bugs, and decided to rewrite the programs. This is why PC-DOS is copyrighted
by both IBM and Microsoft. 

 It is sometimes amusing to reflect on the fact that the IBM PC was not
originally intended to run MSDOS. The target operating system at the end of the
development was for a (not yet in existence) 8086 version of CP/M. On the other
hand, when DOS was originally written the IBM PC did not yet exist! Although
PC-DOS was bundled with the computer, Digital Research's CP/M-86 would probably
have been the main operating system for the PC except for two things - Digital
Research wanted $495 for CP/M-86 (considering PC-DOS was essentially free) and
many software developers found it easier to port existing CP/M software to DOS
than to the new version of CP/M.

 MSDOS and PC-DOS have been run on more than just the IBM-PC and clones. There 
was an expansion board for the Apple ][ that allowed one to run (some) well - 
behaved DOS programs. There are expansion boards for the Commodore Amiga 2000,
the Apple MacIntosh II, and the IBM RT PC allowing them to run DOS, and the IBM
3270 PC, which ran DOS on a 68000 microprocessor. The Atari STs can run an 
emulator program and boot MSDOS.


Specific Versions of MS/PC-DOS:

 DOS version nomenclature: major.minor.minor.  The digit to the left of the 
decimal point indicates a major DOS version change. 1.0 was the first version. 
2.0 added subdirectories, etc. 3.0 added file handles and network support.
 The first minor version indicates customization for a major application. For 
example, 2.1 for the PCjr, 3.3 for the PS/2s. The second minor version does not 
seem to have any particular meaning.

 The main versions of DOS are:

 PC-DOS 1.0   October  1981  original release
 PC-DOS 1.1   June     1982  bugfix, double sided drive support
 MS-DOS 1.25  June     1982  for early compatibles
 PC-DOS 2.0   March    1983  for PC/XT, many UNIX-like functions
 PC-DOS 2.1   October  1983  for PCjr, bugfixes for 2.0
 MS-DOS 2.11  October  1983  compatible equivalent to 2.1
 PC-DOS 3.0   August   1984  for PC/AT, network support
 PC-DOS 3.1   November 1984  bugfix for 3.0
 MS-DOS 2.25  October  1985  compatible; extended foreign language support
 PC-DOS 3.2   July     1986  3.5 inch drive support for Convertible
 PC-DOS 3.3   April    1987  for PS/2 series


 Some versions of MS-DOS varied from PC-DOS in the availible external commands.
Some OEMs only licensed the basic operating system code (the xxxDOS and xxxBIO
programs, and COMMAND.COM) from Microsoft, and either wrote the rest themselves
or contracted them from outside software houses like Phoenix. Most of the 
external programs for DOS 3.x are written in "C" while the 1.x and 2.x utilities
were written in assembly language. Other OEMs required customized versions of 
DOS for their specific hardware configurations, such as Sanyo 55x and early 
Tandy computers, which were unable to exchange their DOS with the IBM version.

 At least two versions of DOS have been modified to be run entirely out of ROM.
The Sharp PC5000 had MSDOS 1.25 in ROM, and the Toshiba 1100 and some Tandy 
models have MSDOS 2.11 in ROM.


 THE OPERATING SYSTEM HIERARCHY

 The Disk Operating System (DOS) and the ROM BIOS serve as an insulating layer 
between the application program and the machine, and as a source of services 
to the application program.
 The system heirarchy may be thought of as a tree, with the lowest level being 
the actual hardware. The 8088 or V20 processor sees the computer's address 
space as a ladder two bytes wide and one million bytes long. Parts of this 
ladder are in ROM, parts in RAM, and parts are not assigned. There are also 
256 "ports" that the processor can use to control devices. 
 The hardware is normally addressed by the ROM BIOS, which will always know
where everything is in its particular system. The chips may usually also be
written to directly, by telling the processor to write to a specific address or
port. This sometimes does not work as the chips may not always be at the same
addresses or have the same functions from machine to machine.



 DOS STRUCTURE

DOS consists of four components:

 * The boot record
 * The ROM BIOS interface  (IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS)
 * The DOS program file    (IBMDOS.COM or MSDOS.SYS)
 * The command processor   (COMMAND.COM or aftermarket replacement)


* The Boot Record

 The boot record begins on track 0, sector 1, side 0 of every diskette formatted
by the DOS FORMAT command.  The boot record is placed on diskettes to produce an
error message if you try to start up the system with a nonsystem diskette in 
drive A.  For hard disks, the boot record resides on the first sector of the DOS
partition.  All media supported by DOS use one sector for the boot record.


* Read Only Memory (ROM) BIOS Interface

 The file IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS is the interface module to the ROM BIOS.
This file provides a low-level interface to the ROM BIOS device routines and 
may contain extensions or changes to the system board ROMs. Some compatibles do
not have a ROM BIOS to extend, and load the entire BIOS from disk. (Sanyo 55x,
Viasyn)


* The DOS Program File

 The actual DOS program is file IBMDOS.COM or MSDOS.SYS. It provides a high-
level interface for user (application) programs. This program consists of file
management routines, data blocking/deblocking for the disk routines, and a
variety of built-in functions easily accessible by user programs.
 When a user program calls these function routines, they accept high-level
information by way of register and control block contents. For device 
operations, the functions translate the requirement into one or more calls to 
IBMBIO.COM or MSDOS.SYS to complete the request.
    

* The Command Interpreter
  
 The Command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, consists of these parts:
    
Resident Portion:

 The resident portion resides in memory immediately following IBMDOS.COM and its
data area. This portion contains routines to process interrupts 22h (Terminate 
Address), 23h (Ctrl-Break Handler), and 24h (Critical Error Handler), as well as
a routine to reload the transient portion if needed. For DOS 3.x, this portion 
also contains a routine to load and execute external commands, such as files 
with exensions of COM or EXE.

 When a program terminates, a checksum is used to determine if the application 
program overlaid the transient portion of COMMAND.COM. If so, the resident 
portion will reload the transient portion from the area designated by COMSPEC= 
in the DOS environment. If COMMAND.COM cannot be found, the system will halt.

NOTE: DOS 3.3 checks for the presence of a hard disk, and will default to 
      COMSPEC=C:\. Previous versions default to COMSPEC=A:\. Under some DOS
      versions, if COMMAND.COM is not immediately availible for reloading
      (i.e., swapping to a floppy with COMMAND.COM on it) DOS may crash.

 All standard DOS error handling is done within the resident portion of 
COMMAND.COM.  This includes displaying error messages and interpreting the 
replies of Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail.  

  
 An initialization routine is included in the resident portion and assumes
control during startup. This routine contains the AUTOEXEC.BAT file handler and
determines the segment address where user application programs may be loaded.
The initialization routine is then no longer needed and is overlaid by the first
program COMMAND.COM loads.

 NOTE: AUTOEXEC.BAT may be a hidden file.

 A transient portion is loaded at the high end of memory. This is the command 
processor itself, containing all of the internal command processors and the 
batch file processor. For DOS 2.x, this portion also contains a routine to load
and execute external commands, such as files with extensions of COM or EXE.

 This portion of COMMAND.COM also produces the DOS prompt (such as "A>"), reads
the command from the standard input device (usually the keyboard or a batch 
file), and executes the command. For external commands, it builds a command line
and issues an EXEC function call to load and transfer control to the program.

NOTE: COMMAND.COM may be a hidden file.
    
NOTE: For Dos 2.x, the transient portion of the command processor contains the
      EXEC routine that loads and executes external commands. For DOS 3.x, the
      resident portion of the command processor contains the EXEC routine. 



  DOS Initialization

 The system is initialized by a software reset (Ctrl-Alt-Del), a hardware reset
(reset button), or by turning the computer on. The Intel 80x8x series processors
always look for their first instruction at the end of their address space 
(0FFFF0h) when powered up or reset. This address contains a jump to the first 
instruction for the ROM BIOS.
 Built-in ROM programs (Power-On Self-Test, or POST, in the IBM) check machine
status and run inspection programs of various sorts. Some machines set up a
reserved RAM area with bytes indicating installed equipment (AT and PCjr). 
 The ROM routine looks for a disk drive at A: or an option ROM (usually a hard
disk) at absolute address C:800h. If no floppy drive or option ROM is found, the
BIOS calls int 19h (ROM BASIC if it is an IBM) or displays error message. 
 If a bootable disk is found, the ROM BIOS loads the first sector of information
from the disk and then jumps into the RAM location holding that code. This code
normally is a routine to load the rest of the code off the disk, or to "boot"
the system. 
 The following actions occur after a system initialization:

 1.  The boot record is read into memory and given control.    

 2.  The boot record then checks the root directory to assure that the first 
     two files are IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM. These two files must be the 
     first two files, and they must be in that order (IBMBIO.COM first, with 
     its sectors in contiguous order).
     NOTE: IBMDOS.COM need not be contiguous in version 3.x.

 3.  The boot record loads IBMBIO.COM into memory.

 4.  The initialization code in IBMBIO.COM loads IBMDOS.COM, determines 
     equipment status, resets the disk system, initializes the attached 
     devices, sets the system parameters and loads any installable device 
     drivers according to the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory (if 
     present), sets the low-numbered interrupt vectors, relocates IBMDOS.COM 
     downward, and calls the first byte of DOS.
     NOTE: CONFIG.SYS may be a hidden file.

 5.  DOS initializes its internal working tables, initializes the interrupt
     vectors for interrupts 20h through 27h, and builds a Program Segment 
     Prefix for COMMAND.COM at the lowest available segment. For DOS versions
     3.10 up, DOS initializes interrupt vectors for interrupts 0Fh through 3Fh.

 6.  IBMBIO.COM uses the EXEC function call to load and start the top-level
     command processor. The default command processor is COMMAND.COM.

note:   These are functions common across the IBM range. The PCjr, PC 
        Convertible and PS/2 (both buses) have enhancements. In some cases, the
        AT and PS/2 series ignore, duplicate, or reassign ports arbitrarily. If
        your code incorporates specific port addresses for video or system board
        control it would be wise to have your application determine the machine
        type and video adapter and address the ports as required.

                  The IBM PC System Interrupts   (Overview)

 The interrupt table is stored in the very lowest location in memory, starting 
at 0000:0000h. The locations are offset from segment 0, ie location 0000h has
the address for int 0, etc. Each address is four bytes long and its location in
memory can be found by multiplying the interrupt number by 4. For example, int
7 could be found by (7x4=28) or 1Bh (0000:001Bh).
 These interrupt vectors normally point to ROM tables or are taken over by DOS 
when an application is run. Some applications revector these interrupts to 
their own code to change the way the system responds to the user.

 For consistency in this volume, all locations and offsets are in hexadecimal 
unless otherwise specified. All hex numbers are prefaced with a leading zero 
if they begin with an alphabetic character, and are terminated with a 
lowercase H (h). The formats vary according to common usage.


                The IBM-PC System Interrupts  (in detail)


Interrupt  00h  Divide by Zero (processor error). Automatically called at end
(0:0000h)       of DIV or IDIV operation that results in error. Normally set by
                DOS to display an error message and abort the program.


Interrupt  01h  Single step - Taken after every instruction when CPU Trap Flag
(0:0004h)       indicates single-step mode (bit 8 of FLAGS is 1). This is what
                makes the T command of DEBUG work for single stepping. Is not
                generated after MOV to segment register or POP of segment 
                register. (unless you have a very early 8088 with the microcode
                bug).


Interrupt  02h  Non-maskable interrupt - Vector not disabled via CLI. Used by
(0:0008h)       parity check routine in POST, 8087 coprocessor, PCjr infrared
                keyboard link.


Interrupt  03h  Breakpoint - Taken when CPU executes the 1-byte int 3 (0CCh).
(0:000Ch)       Generated by opcode 0CCh. Similar to 8080's RST instruction.
                Generally used to set breakpoints for DEBUG.


Interrupt 04h  Divide overflow -  Generated by INTO instruction if OF flag is
(0:0010h)      set. If flag is not set, INTO is effectively a NOP. Used to trap
               any arithmetic errors when program is ready to handle them rather
               than immediately when they occur.


Interrupt  05h  Print Screen - service dumps the screen to the printer. Invoked
(0:0014h)       by int 9 for shifted key 55 (PrtSc). Automatically called by 
                keyboard scan when PrtSc key is pressed. Normally executes 
                routine to print the screen, but may call any routine that can
                safely be executed from inside the keyboard scanner. Status and
                result byte are at address 0050:0000.
entry   AH      05h
return  absolute address 50:0   
        00h     print screen has not been called, or upon return from a call 
                there were no errors.
        01h     print screen is already in progress.
        0FFh    error encountered during printing.
note 1) Uses BIOS services to read the screen
     2) Output is directed to LPT1
     3) Revectored into GRAPHICS.COM if GRAPHICS.COM is loaded

(0:0020h)  (IRQ0)  BIOS clock and turns off diskette drive motors after 2
           seconds of inactivity. 
entry   AH      08h
return  absolute addresses:

 Copyright 1988, Dave Williams

Interrupt  10h  Video I/O - services to handle video output
(0:0040h)       The ROM video routines in the original PC BIOS are designed for
                use with the Color Graphics Adapter and incorporate code to test
                for the horizontal retrace before writing. The check is
                performed no matter what actual display adapter is installed.
                The ROM character table for the first 128 characters is located
                at 0FA6Eh in the PC. Int 01Fh can be used to point to a second
                table of 128 characters.
                 CS, SS, DS, ES, BX, CX, DX are preserved during call. All
                others are destroyed.

note 1) If the high bit in AL is set, the display buffer is not cleared when a
        new mode is selected. This may be used to mix modes on the display;
        for example, characters of two difference sizes might be displayed
     2) Modes 8-10 are available on the PCjr, Tandy 1000, and PS/2
     3) IBM claims 100% software and hardware emulation of the CGA with the
        MCGA chipset. All registers may be read and written as CGA. All
        characters are double-scanned to give 80x25 with 400 line resolution.
        The attributes for setting border color may be set on MCGA, but the
        borders will remain the default color (they cannot actually be set)
     4) The IBM Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) is too slow for the screen to
        be updated before the vertical retrace of the monitor is completed.
        If the video RAM is addressed directly, the screen will have "snow"
        or interference. IBM's default is to turn the adapter off when it is
        being updated, ie "flickering" when the display is scrolled.
     5) The vertical retrace signal may be ignored when using the MCGA adapter.
        The MCGA will not generate snow when written to. There is no flicker
        with the MCGA.
     6) The PCjr Video Gate Array uses a user-defined block of main system RAM
        from 4 to 32k in size instead of having dedicated memory for the
        display. Vertical retrace may be ignored when writing to the PCjr.
        There is no flicker with the PCjr display.
     7) The Hercules Graphics Card has 750x348 resolution
     8) The Hercules Graphics Card takes 32k beginning at B:000 (same as MDA)
     9) The CGA, MCGA, and VGA adapters use hardware address B:800
    10) The BIOS clears the screen when the mode is set or reset.
    11) For AT&T VDC overlay modes, BL contains the DEB mode, which may be 06h,
        40h, or 44h

                      text modes 00h-03h:     6      7
     2) The blinking in text mode is caused by hardware and cannot be turned
        off, though some kludges can temporarily fake a nonblinking cursor
     3) The cursor is automatically turned off in graphics mode
     4) Another method of turning off the cursor in text mode is to position it
        to a nondisplayable address, such as (X,Y)=(0,25)
     5) Buggy on EGA systems - BIOS remaps cursor shape in 43 line modes, but
        returns unmapped cursor shape

return  none
note 1) CX should not exceed actual rows availible, or results may be erratic
     2) Setting CX to zero will cause runaway
     3) All values of AL result in some sort of display; the various control
        characters are not recognized as special and do not change the current
        cursor position
     4) Does not change cursor position when called - the cursor must be
        advanced with int 10 function 0Ah.
     5) If used to write characters in graphics mode with bit 7 of AH set to 1
        the character will by XORed with the current display contents.
     6) In graphics mode the bit patterns for ASCII character codes 80h-0FFh
        are obtained from a table. On the standard PC and AT, the location is at
        interrupt vector 01Fh (0000:007C). For ASCII characters 00h-07Fh, the
        table is at an address in ROM. On the PCjr the table is at interrupt
        vector 44h (0000:00110) and is in addressable RAM (may be replaced by
        the user)

note 1) CX should not exceed actual rows availible, or results may be erratic
     2) All values of AL result in some sort of display; the various control
        characters are not recognized as special and do not change the current
        cursor position
     3) If used to write characters in graphics mode with bit 7 of AH set to 1
        the character will by XORed with the current display contents.
     4) In graphics mode the bit patterns for ASCII character codes 80h-0FFh

note 1) The ASCII codes for bell, backspace, carriage return, and linefeed are
        recognized and appropriate action taken. All other characters are
        written to the screen and the cursor is advanced to the next position
     2) Text can be written to any CGA page regardless of current active page
     3) Automatic linewrap and scrolling are provided through this function
     4) This is the function used by the DOS CON console driver.
     5) This function does not explicitly allow the use of attributes to the
        characters written. Attributes may be provided by first writing an ASCII
        27h (blank) with the desired attributes using function 09h, then
        overwriting with the actual character using this function. While clumsy
        this allows use of the linewrap and scrolling services provided by
        this function


Function 0Fh    Return Current Video State - mode and size of the screen

note 1) The clock ticks are incremented by timer interrupt at 18.2065 times
        per second or 54.9254milliseconds/count. Therefore:
                counts per second = 18      (12h)
                counts per minute = 1092    (444h)
                counts per hour   = 65543   (10011h)
                counts per day    = 1573040 (1800B0h)
     2) counter is zeroed when system is rebooted

     2) IBM and Microsoft recommend using int 21 Fn 4Ch. Using int 20 is
        officially frowned upon since the introduction of DOS 2.0

Interrupt 1Bh   Control-Break
(0:006Ch)       This interrupt is called when the keyboard scanner of the IBM
                machines detects Ctrl and Break pressed at the same time.

note 1) If the break occurred while processing an interrupt, one or more
        end of interrupt commands must be send to the 8259 Programmable
        Interrupt Controller.
     2) All I/O devices should be reset in case an operation was underway at
        the time.
     3) It is normally pointed to an IRET during system initialization so that
        it does nothing, but some programs change it to return a ctrl-C scan
        code and thus invoke int 23h.




Interrupt 1Ch   Timer Tick
(0:0070h)
note 1) Taken 18.2065 times per second
     2) Normally vectors to dummy IRET unless PRINT.COM has been installed.
     3) If an application moves the interrupt pointer, it is the responsibility
        of that application to save and restore all registers that may be
        modified.




Interrupt 1Dh   Vector of Video Initialization Parameters.
(0:0074h)       This doubleword address points to 3 sets of 16-bytes containing
                data to initialize for video modes for video modes 0 & 1 (40
                column), 2 & 3 (80 column), and 4, 5 & 6 (graphics) on the
                Motorola 6845 CRT controller chip.
 6845 registers:
        R0      horizontal total (horizontal sync in characters)
        R1      horizontal displayed (characters per line)
        R2      horizontal sync position (move display left or right)
        R3      sync width (vertical and horizontal pulse: 4-bits each)
        R4      vertical total (total character lines)
        R5      vertical adjust (adjust for 50 or 60 Hz refresh)
        R6      vertical displayed (lines of chars displayed)
        R7      vertical sync position (lines shifted up or down)
        R8      interlace (bits 4 and 5) and skew (bits 6 and 7)
        R9      max scan line addr (scan lines per character row)
        R10     cursor start (starting scan line of cursor)
        R11     cursor stop (ending scan line of cursor)
        R12     video memory start address high byte (6-bits)
        R13     video memory start address low byte (8-bits)
        R14     cursor address high byte (6-bits)
        R15     cursor address low byte (8-bits)

 6845 Video Init Tables:
        table for modes 0 and 1   \
        table for modes 2 and 3    \ each table is 16 bytes long and
        table for modes 4,5, and 6 / contains values for 6845 registers
        table for mode 7          /
        4 words:   size of video RAM for modes 0/1, 2/3, 4/5, and 6/7
        8 bytes:   number of columns in each mode
        8 bytes:   video controller mode byte for each mode
note 1) There are 4 separate tables, and all 4 must be initialized if all
        video modes will be used.
     2) The power-on initialization code of the computer points this vector
        to the ROM BIOS video routines.
     3) IBM recommends that is this table needs to be modified, it should be
        copied into RAM and only the nescessary changes made.




Interrupt 1Eh   Vector of Diskette Controller Parameters
(0:0078h)       Dword address points to data base table that is used by BIOS.
                Default location is at 0F000:0EFC7h. 11-byte table format:
                bytes:

                        DOS 2.10  2
note 1) This vector is pointed to the ROM BIOS diskette tables on system
        initialization
     2) IBM recommends that is this table needs to be modified, it should be
        copied into RAM and only the nescessary changes made.




Interrupt 1Fh   Pointer to Graphics Character Extensions (Graphics Set 2)
(0:007Ch)       This is the pointer to data used by the ROM video routines to
                display characters above ASCII 127 while in CGA medium and high
                res graphics modes.

note 1) Doubleword address points to 1K table composed of 28 8-byte character
        definition bit-patterns. First byte of each entry is top row, last byte
        is bottom row.
     2) The first 128 character patterns are located in system ROM.
     3) This vector is set to 000:0 at system initialization
     4) Used by DOS' external GRAFTABL command


Interrupt 20h   PROGRAM TERMINATE
(0:0080h)
 Issue int 20h to exit from a program. This vector transfers to the logic in
DOS to restore the terminate address, the Ctrl-Break address,and the critical
error exit address to the values they had on entry to the program. All the file
buffers are flushed and all handles are closed. You should close all files
changed in length (see function calls 10h and 3Eh) before issuing this
interrupt. If the changed file is not closed, its length, time, and date are
not recorded correctly in the directory.
 For a program to pass a completion code or an error code when terminating, it
must use either function call 4Ch (Terminate a Process) or 31h (Terminate
Process and Stay Resident). These two methods are preferred over using
int 20h and the codes returned by them can be interrogated in batch processing.
Important: Before you issue an interrupt 20h, your program must ensure that
           the CS register contains the segment of its program segment prefix.

Interrupt 20h   DOS - Terminate Program
entry   no parameters
return  none

Interrupt 20h   Minix - Send/Receive Message

note    The message contains the system call number (numbered as in V7 Unix)
        and the call parameters

DOS REGISTERS

 DOS uses the following registers, pointers, and flags when it executes
interrupts and function calls:

GENERAL REGISTERS    register                definition
                        AX      accumulator (16 bit)
                        AH      accumulator high-order byte (8 bit)
                        AL      accumulator low order byte (8 bit)
                        BX      base (16 bit)
                        BH      base high-order byte (8 bit)
                        BL      base low-order byte (8 bit)
                        CX      count (16 bit)
                        CH      count high order byte (8 bit)
                        CL      count low order byte (8 bit)
                        DX      data (16 bit)
                        DH      date high order byte (8 bit)
                        DL      data low order byte (8 bit)

FLAGS                   AF, CF, DF, IF, OF, PF, SF, TF, ZF

POINTERS             register        definition
                        SP      stack pointer (16 bit)
                        BP      base pointer (16 bit)
                        IP      instruction pointer (16 bit)

SEGMENT REGISTERS    register       definition
                        CS      code  segment (16 bit)
                        DS      data  segment (16 bit)
                        SS      stack segment (16 bit)
                        ES      extra segment (16 bit)

INDEX REGISTERS      register        definition
                        DI      destination index (16 bit)
                        SI      stack       index (16 bit)


INTERRUPTS

 Microsoft recommends that a program wishing to examine or set the contents of
any interrupt vector use the DOS function calls 35h and 25h provided for those
purposes and avoid referencing the interrupt vector locations directly.
 DOS reserves interrupt numbers 20h to 3Fh for its own use. This means absolute
memory locations 80h to 0FFh are reserved by DOS. The defined interrupts are as
follows with all values in hexadecimal.


Interrupt 21h   FUNCTION CALL REQUEST
(0:0084h)
 DOS provides a wide variety of function calls for character device I/O, file
management, memory management, date and time functions,execution of other
programs, and more. They are grouped as follows:

          call              description
        00h             program terminate
        01h-0Ch         character device I/O, CP/M compatibility format

        25h-26h         nondevice functions,  CP/M compatibility format
        27h-29h         file management,      CP/M compatibility format
        2Ah-2Eh         nondevice functions,  CP/M compatibility format
        2Fh-38h         extended functions

 CALLING THE DOS SERVICES

 The DOS services are invoked by placing the number of the desired function in
register AH, subfunction in AL, setting the other registers to any specific
requirements of the function, and invoking int 21h.

 On return, the requested service will be performed if possible. Most codes
will return an error; some return more information. Details are contained in
the listings for the individual functions. Extended error return may be
obtained by calling function 59h (see 59h).

 Register settings listed are the ones used by DOS. Some functions will return
with garbage values in unused registers. Do not test for values in unspecified
registers; your program may exhibit odd behavior.

 DS:DX pointers are the data segment register (DS) indexed to the DH and DL
registers (DX). DX always contains the offset address, DS contains the segment
address.

 The File Control Block services (FCB services) were part of DOS 1.0. Since
the release of DOS 2.0, Microsoft has recommended that these services not be
used. A set of considerably more enhanced services (handle services) were
introduced with DOS 2.0. The handle services provide support for wildcards and
subdirectories, and enhanced error detection via function 59h.

 The data for the following calls was compiled from various Intel, Microsoft,
IBM, and other publications. There are many subtle differences between MSDOS
and PCDOS and between the individual versions. Differences between the
versions are noted as they occur.

 There are various ways of calling the DOS functions. For all methods, the
function number is loaded into register AH, subfunctions and/or parameters are
loaded into AL or other registers, and call int 21 by one of the following
methods:
 A) call interrupt 21h directly
 B) perform a long call to offset 50h in the program's PSP.
    1) This method will not work under DOS 1.x
 C) place the function number in CL and perform an intrasegment call to
    location 05h in the current code segment. This location contains a long
    call to the DOS function dispatcher.
    1) IBM recommends this method be used only when using existing programs
       written for different calling conventions. This method should be avoided
       unless you some specific use for it
    2) AX is always destroyed by this method
    3) This method is valid only for functions 00h-24h.

00h   Terminate Program
      Ends program, updates, FAT, flushes buffers, restores registers
entry   AH      00h
        CS      segment address of PSP
return  none
note 1) Program must place the segment address of the PSP control block in CS
        before calling this function.
     2) The terminate, ctrl-break,and critical error exit addresses (0Ah, 0Eh,
        12h) are restored to the values they had on entry to the terminating
        program, from the values saved in the program segment prefix at
        locations PSP:000Ah, PSP:000Eh, and PSP:0012h.
     3) All file buffers are flushed and the handles opened by the process are
        closed.
     4) Any files that have changed in length and are not closed are not
        recorded properly in the directory.
     5) Control transfers to the terminate address.
     6) This call performs exactly the same function as int 20h.
     7) All memory used by the program is returned to DOS.


01h     Get Keyboard Input
        Waits for char at STDIN (if nescessary), echoes to STDOUT
entry   AH      01h
return  AL      char from STDIN (8 bits)
note 1) Checks char for Ctrl-C, if char is Ctrl-C, executes int 23h.
     2) For function call 06h, extended ASCII codes require two function calls.
        The first call returns 00h as an indicator that the next call will be an
        extended ASCII code.
     3) Input and output are redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to
        detect EOF.


02h   Display Output
      Outputs char in DL to STDOUT
entry   AH      02h
        DL      8 bit data (usually ASCII character)
return  none
note 1) If char is 08 (backspace) the cursor is moved 1 char to the left
        (nondestructive backspace).
     2) If Ctrl-C is detected after input, int 23h is executed.
     3) Input and output are redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to
        detect disk full.


03h   Auxiliary Input
      Get (or wait until) character from STDAUX
entry   AH      03h
return  AL      char from auxiliary device
note 1) AUX, COM1, COM2 is unbuffered and not interrupt driven
     2) This function call does not return status or error codes. For greater
        control it is recommended that you use ROM BIOS routine (int 14h) or
        write an AUX device driver and use IOCTL.
     3) At startup, PC-DOS initializes the first auxiliary port (COM1) to 2400
        baud, no parity, one stop bit, and an 8-bit word. MSDOS may differ.
     4) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.


04h   Auxiliary Output
      Write character to STDAUX
entry   AH      04h
        DL      char to send to AUX
return  none
note 1) This function call does not return status or error codes. For greater
        control it is recommended that you use ROM BIOS routine (int 14h) or
        write an AUX device driver and use IOCTL.
     2) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.
     3) Default is COM1 unless redirected by DOS.
     4) If the device is busy, this function will wait until it is ready.


05h   Printer Output
      Write character to STDPRN
entry   AL      05h
        DL      character to send
return  none
note 1) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.
     2) Default is PRN or LPT1 unless redirected with the MODE command.
     3) If the printer is busy, this function will wait until it is ready.


06h   Direct Console I/O
      Get character from STDIN; echo character to STDOUT
entry   AH      06h
        DL      0FFh for console input, or 00h-0FEh for console output
return  ZF      zero flag set   (1) = no character
                zero flag clear (0) = character recieved
        AL      character
note 1) Extended ASCII codes require two function calls. The first call returns
        00h to indicate the next call will return an extended code.
     2) If DL is not 0FFh, DL is assumed to have a valid character that is
        output to STDOUT.
     3) This function does not check for Ctrl-C or Ctrl-PrtSc.
     4) Does not echo input to screen
     5) If I/O is redirected, EOF or disk full cannot be detected.


07h   Direct Console Input Without Echo         (does not check BREAK)
      Get or wait for char at STDIN, returns char in AL
entry   AH      07h
return  AL      character from standard input device
note 1) Extended ASCII codes require two function calls. The first call returns
        00h to indicate the next call will return an extended code.
     2) No checking for Ctrl-C or Ctrl-PrtSc is done.
     3) Input is redirectable.


08h   Console Input Without Echo                (checks BREAK)
      Get or Wait for char at STDIN, return char in AL
entry   AH      08h
return  AL      char from standard input device
note 1) Char is checked for ctrl-C. If ctrl-C is detected, executes int 23h.
     2) For function call 08h, extended ASCII characters require two function
        calls. The first call returns 00h to signify an extended ASCII code.
        The next call returns the actual code.
     3) Input is redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to check EOF.


09h   Print String
      Outputs Characters in the Print String to the STDOUT
entry   AH      09h
        DS:DX   pointer to the Character String to be displayed
return  none
note 1) The character string in memory must be terminated by a $ (24h)
        The $ is not displayed.
     2) Output to STDOUT is the same as function call 02h.


0Ah   Buffered Keyboard Input
      Reads characters from STDIN and places them in the buffer beginning
      at the third byte.
entry   AH      0Ah
        DS:DX   pointer to an input buffer
return  none
note 1) Min buffer size = 1, max = 255
     2) Char is checked for ctrl-C. If ctrl-C is detected, executes int 23h.
     3) Format of buffer DX:
        byte       contents
         1      Maximum number of chars the buffer will take, including CR.
                Reading STDIN and filling the buffer continues until a carriage
                return (<Enter> or 0Dh) is read. If the buffer fills to one less
                than the maximum number the buffer can hold, each additional
                number read is ignored and ASCII 7 (BEL) is output to the
                display until a carriage return is read. (you must set this
                value)
         2      Actual number of characters received, excluding the carriage
                return, which is always the last character. (the function sets
                this value)
         3-n    Characters received are placed into the buffer starting here.
                Buffer must be at least as long as the number in byte 1.
     4) Input is redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to check EOF.
     5) The string may be edited with the standard DOS editing commands as it
        is being entered.
     6) Extended ASCII characters are stored as 2 bytes, the first byte being
        zero.


0Bh   Check Standard Input (STDIN) status
      Checks for character availible at STDIN
entry   AH      0Bh
return  AL      0FFh    if a character is availible from STDIN
                00h     if no character is availible from STDIN
note 1) Checks for Ctrl-C. If Ctrl-C is detected, int 23h is executed
     2) Input can be redirected.
     3) Checks for character only, it is not read into the application


0Ch   Clear Keyboard Buffer & Invoke a Keyboard Function       (FCB)
      Dumps buffer, executes function in AL (01h,06h,07h,08h,0Ah only)
entry   AH      0Ch
        AL      function number (must be 01h, 06h, 07h, 08h, or 0Ah)
return  AL      00h     buffer was flushed, no other processing performed
                other   any other value has no meaning
note 1) Forces system to wait until a character is typed.
     2) Flushes all typeahead input, then executes function specified by AL (by
        moving it to AH and repeating the int 21 call).
     3) If AL contains a value not in the list above, the keyboard buffer is
        flushed and no other action is taken.


0Dh   Disk Reset
      Flushes all currently open file buffers to disk
entry   AH      0Dh
return          none
note 1) Does not close files. Does not update directory entries; files changed
        in size but not closed are not properly recorded in the directory
     2) Sets DTA address to DS:0080h
     3) Should be used before a disk change, Ctrl-C handlers, and to flush
        the buffers to disk.


0Eh   Select Disk
      Sets the drive specified in DL (if valid) as the default drive
entry   AL      0Eh
        DL      new default drive number (0=A:,1=B:,2=C:,etc.)
return  AL      total number of logical drives (not nescessarily physical)
note 1) For DOS 1.x and 2.x, the minimum value for AL is 2.
     2) For DOS 3.x, the minimum value for AL is 5.
     3) The drive number returned is not nescessarily a valid drive.
     4) For DOS 1.x: 16 logical drives are availible. A-P.
        For DOS 2.x: 63 logical drives are availible. (Letters are only used for
                     the first 26 drives. If more than 26 logical drives are
                     used, further drive letters will be other ASCII characters
                     ie {,], etc.
        For DOS 3.x: 26 logical drives are availible. A-Z.


0Fh   Open Disk File                                                    (FCB)
      Searches current directory for specified filename and opens it
entry   AH      0Fh
        DS:DX   pointer to an unopened FCB
return  AL      00h     if file found
                0FFh    if file not not found
note 1) If the drive code was 0 (default drive) it is changed to the actual
        drive used (1=A:,2=B:,3=C:, etc). This allows changing the default drive
        without interfering with subsequent operations on this file.
     2) The current block field (FCB bytes C-D, offset 0Ch) is set to zero.
     3) The size of the record to be worked with (FCB bytes E-F, offset 0Eh) is
        set to the system default of 80h. The size of the file (offset 10h) and
        the date (offset 14h) are set from information obtained in the root
        directory. You can change the default value for the record size (FCB
        bytes E-F) or set the random record size and/or current record field.
        Perform these actions after the open but before any disk operations.
     4) The file is opened in compatibility mode.
     5) Microsoft recommends handle function call 3Dh be used instead.
     6) This call is also used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+
     7) Before performing a sequential disk operation on the file, you must
        set the Current Record field (offset 20h). Before performing a random
        disk operation on the file, you must set the Relative Record field
        (offset 21h). If the default record size of 128 bytes is incorrect, set
        it to the correct value.


10h  Close File                                                         (FCB)
     Closes a File After a File Write
entry   AH      10h
        DS:DX   pointer to an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     if the file is found and closed
                0FFh    if the file is not found in the current directory
note 1) This function call must be done on open files that are no longer needed,
        and after file writes to insure all directory information is updated.
     2) If the file is not found in its correct position in the current
        directory, it is assumed that the diskette was changed and AL returns
        0FFh. This error return is reportedly not completely reliable with DOS
        version 2.x.
     3) If found, the directory is updated to reflect the status in the FCB, the
        buffers to that file are flushed, and AL returns 00h.


11h   Search For First Matching Entry                                   (FCB)
      Searches current disk & directory for first matching filename
entry   AH      11h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     successful match
                0FFh    no matching filename found
note 1) The FCB may contain the wildcard character ? under Dos 2.x, and ? or *
        under 3.x.
     2) The original FCB at DS:DX contains information to continue the search
        with function 12h, and should not be modified.
     3) If a matching filename is found, AL returns 00h and the locations at the
        Disk Transfer Address are set as follows:
        a) If the FCB provided for searching was an extended FCB, then the first
           byte at the disk transfer address is set to 0FFh followed by 5 bytes
           of zeroes, then the attribute byte from the search FCB, then the
           drive number used (1=A, 2=B, etc) then the 32 bytes of the directory
           entry. Thus, the disk transfer address contains a valid unopened FCB
           with the same search attributes as the search FCB.
        b) If the FCB provided for searching was a standard FCB, then the first
           byte is set to the drive number used (1=A,2=b,etc), and the next 32
           bytes contain the matching directory entry. Thus, the disk transfer
           address contains a valid unopened normal FCB.
     4) If an extended FCB is used, the following search pattern is used:
        a) If the FCB attribute byte is zero, only normal file entries are
           found. Entries for volume label, subdirectories, hidden or system
           files, are not returned.
        b) If the attribute byte is set for hidden or system files, or
           subdirectory entries, it is to be considered as an inclusive search.
           All normal file entries plus all entries matching the specified
           attributes are returned. To look at all directory entries except the
           volume label, the attribute byte may be set to hidden + system +
           directory (all 3 bits on).
        c) If the attribute field is set for the volume label, it is considered
           an exclusive search, and ONLY the volume label entry is returned.
     5) This call is also used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+


12h   Search For Next Entry Using FCB                                   (FCB)
      Search for next matching filename
entry   AH      12h
        DS:DX   pointer to the unopened FCB specified from the previous Search
                First (11h) or Search Next (12h)
return  AL      00h     if matching filename found
                0FFh    if matching filename was not found
note 1) After a matching filename has been found using function call 11h,
        function 12h may be called to find the next match to an ambiguous
        request. For DOS 2.x, ?'s are allowed in the filename. For DOS 3.x,
        global (*) filename characters are allowed.
     2) The DTA contains info from the previous Search First or Search Next.
     3) All of the FCB except for the name/extension field is used to keep
        information nescessary for continuing the search, so no disk operations
        may be performed with this FCB between a previous function 11h or 12h
        call and this one.
     4) If the file is found, an FCB is created at the DTA address and set up to
        open or delete it.


13h   Delete File Via FCB                                               (FCB)
      Deletes file specified in FCB from current directory
entry   AH      13h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     file deleted
                0FFh    if file not found or was read-only
note 1) All matching current directory entries are deleted. The global filename
        character "?" is allowed in the filename.
     2) Will not delete files with read-only attribute set
     3) Close open files before deleting them.
     4) Requires Network Access Rights


14h   Sequential Disk File Read                                         (FCB)
      Reads record sequentially from disk via FCB
entry   AH  14h
        DS:DX   pointer to an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read
                01h     end of file (no data read)
                02h     Data Transfer Area too small for record size specified
                        or segment overflow
                03h     partial record read, EOF found
note 1) The record size is set to the value at offset 0Eh in the FCB.
     2) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     3) The record is read into memory at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h
     4) If a partial record is read at the end of the file, it is passed to the
        requested size with zeroes and the error return is set to AL=03h.


15h   Sequential Disk Write                                             (FCB)
      Writes record specified by FCB sequentially to disk
entry   AH      15h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write
                01h     diskette full, write canceled
                02h     disk transfer area (DTA) too small or segment wrap
note 1) The data to write is obtained from the disk transfer area
     2) The record size is set to the value at offset 0Eh in the FCB.
     3) This service cannot write to files set as read-only
     4) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     5) If the record size is less than a sector, the data in the DTA is written
        to a buffer; the buffer is written to disk when it contains a full
        sector of data, the file is closed, or a Reset Disk (function 0Dh) is
        issued.
     6) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


16h   Create A Disk File                                                (FCB)
      Search and open or create directory entry for file
entry   AH      16h
        DS:DX   pointer to an FCB
return  AL      00h     successful creation

note 1) If a matching directory entry is found, the file is truncated to zero
        bytes.
     2) If there is no matching filename, a filename is created.
     3) This function calls function 0Fh (Open File) after creating or
        truncating a file.
     4) A hidden file can be created by using an extended FCB with the attribute
        byte (offset FCB-1) set to 2.


17h   Rename File Specified by File Control Block (FCB)                 (FCB)
      Renames file in current directory
entry   AH      17h
        DS:DX   pointer to an FCB (see note 4)
return  AL      00h     successfully renamed
                0FFh    file not found or filename already exists
note 1) This service cannot rename read-only files
     2) The "?" wildcard may be used.
     3) If the "?" wildcard is used in the second filename, the corresponding
        letters in the filename of the directory entry are not changed.
     4) The FCB must have a drive number, filename, and extension in the usual
        position, and a second filename starting 6 bytes after the first, at
        offset 11h.
     5) The two filenames cannot have the same name.
     6) FCB contains new name starting at byte 17h.

19h   Get Current Disk Drive
      Return designation of current default disk drive
entry   AH      19h
return  AL      current default drive (0=A, 1=B,etc.)
note    Some other DOS functions use 0 for default, 1=A, 2=B, etc.


1Ah   Set Disk Transfer Area Address (DTA)
      Sets DTA address to the address specified in DS:DX
entry   AH      1Ah
        DS:DX   pointer to buffer
return  none
note 1) The default DTA is 128 bytes at offset 80h in the PSP. DOS uses the
        DTA for all file I/O.
     2) Registers are unchanged.
     3) No error codes are returned.
     2) Disk transfers cannot wrap around from the end of the segment to the
        beginning or overflow into another segment.


1Bh   Get Current Drive File Allocation Table Information
      Returns information from the FAT on the current drive
entry   AH      1Bh
exit    AL      number of sectors per allocation unit (cluster)
        DS:BX   address of the current drive's media descriptor byte
        CX      number of bytes per sector
        DX      number of allocation units (clusters) for default drive
note 1) Save DS before calling this function.
     2) This call returned a pointer to the FAT in DOS 1.x. Beginning with
        DOS 2.00, it returns a pointer only to the table's ID byte.
     3) IBM recommends programmers avoid this call and use int 25h instead.


1Ch   Get File Allocation Table Information for Specific Device
      Returns information on specified drive
entry   AH      1Ch
        DL      drive number (1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc)
return  AL      number of sectors per allocation unit (cluster)

        CX      sector size in bytes
        DX      number of allocation units (clusters)
note 1) DL = 0 for default.
     2) Save DS before calling this function.
     3) Format of media-descriptor byte:
        bits:   0       0   (clear)   not double sided
                        1   (set)     double sided

                3-7     always set (1)
     4) This call returned a pointer to the FAT in DOS 1.x. Beginning with
        DOS 2.00, it returns a pointer only to the table's ID byte.
     5) IBM recommends programmers avoid this call and use int 25h instead.

21h  Random Read from File Specified by File Control Block              (FCB)
     Reads one record as specified in the FCB into the current DTA.
entry   AH      21h
        DS:DX   address of the opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read operation
                01h     end of file (EOF), no data read
                02h     DTA too small for the record size specified
                03h     end of file (EOF), partial data read
note 1) The current block and current record fields are set to agree with the
        random record field. Then the record addressed by these fields is read
        into memory at the current Disk Transfer Address.
     2) The current file pointers are NOT incremented this function.
     3) If the DTA is larger than the file, the file is padded to the requested
        length with zeroes.


22h  Random Write to File Specified by FCB                              (FCB)
     Writes one record as specified in the FCB to the current DTA
entry   AH      22h
        DS:DX   address of the opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write operation
                01h     disk full; no data written (write was canceled)
                02h     DTA too small for the record size specified (write was
                        canceled)
note 1) This service cannot write to read-only files.
     2) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     3) If the record size is less than a sector, the data in the DTA is written
        to a buffer; the buffer is written to disk when it contains a full
        sector of data, the file is closed, or a Reset Disk (function 0Dh) is
        issued.
     4) The current file pointers are NOT incremented this function.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


23h  Get File Size                                                      (FCB)
     Searches current subdirectory for matching file, returns size in FCB
entry   AH      23h
        DS:DX   address of an unopened FCB
return  AL      00h file found
                0FFh file not found
note 1) Record size field (offset 0Eh) must be set before invoking this function
     2) The disk directory is searched for the matching entry. If a matching
        entry is found, the random record field is set to the number of records
        in the file. If the value of the Record Size field is not an even
        divisor of the file size, the value set in the relative record field is
        rounded up. This gives a returned value larger than the actual file size
     3) This call is used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+


24h  Set Relative Record Field                                          (FCB)
     Set random record field specified by an FCB
entry   AH      24h
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  Random Record Field of FCB is set to be same as Current Block
        and Current Record.
note 1) You must invoke this function before performing random file access.
     2) The relative record field of FCB (offset 21h) is set to be same as the
        Current Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h).
     3) No error codes are returned.
     4) The FCB must already be opened.


25h  Set Interrupt Vector
     Sets the address of the code DOS is to perform each time the specified
     interrupt is invoked.
entry   AH      25h
        AL      int number to reassign the handler to
        DS:DX   address of new interrupt vector
return  none
note 1) Registers are unchanged.
     2) No error codes are returned.
     3) The interrupt vector table for the interrupt number specified in AL
        is set to the address contained in DS:DX. Use function 35h (Get Vector)
        to get the contents of the interrupt vector and save it for later use.
     4) When you use function 25 to set an interrupt vector, DOS 3.2 doesn't
        point the actual interrupt vector to what you requested. Instead, it
        sets the interrupt vector to point to a routine inside DOS, which does
        this:
                1. Save old stack pointer
                2. Switch to new stack pointer allocated from DOS's stack pool
                3. Call your routine
                4. Restore old stack pointer
        The purpose for this was to avoid possible stack overflows when there
        are a large number of active interrupts. IBM was concerned (this was an
        IBM change, not Microsoft) that on a Token Ring network there would be
        a lot of interrupts going on, and applications that hadn't allocated
        very much stack space would get clobbered.


26h  Create New Program Segment Prefix (PSP)
     This service copies the current program-segment prefix to a new memory
     location for the creation of a new program or overlay. Once the new PSP is
     in place, a DOS program can read a DOS COM or overlay file into the memory
     location immediately following the new PSP and pass control to it.
entry   AH      26h
        DX      segment number for the new PSP
return  none
note 1) Microsoft recommends you use the newer DOS service 4Bh (EXEC) instead.
     2) The entire 100h area at location 0 in the current PSP is copied into
        location 0 of the new PSP. The memory size information at location 6
        in the new segment is updated and the current termination, ctrl-break,
        and critical error addresses from interrupt vector table entries for
        ints 22h, 23h, and 24 are saved in the new program segment starting at
        0Ah. They are restored from this area when the program terminates.
     3) Current PSP is copied to specified segment


27h  Random Block Read From File Specified by FCB                       (FCB)
     Similar to 21h (Random Read) except allows multiple files to be read.
entry   AH      27h
        CX      number of records to be read
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read
                01h     end of file, no data read
                02h     DTA too small for record size specified (read canceled)
                03h     end of file
        CX      actual number of records read (includes partial if AL=03h)
note 1) The record size is specified in the FCB. The service updates the Current
        Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h) fields to the next
        record not read.
     2) If CX contained 0 on entry, this is a NOP.
     3) If the DTA is larger than the file, the file is padded to the requested
        length with zeroes.
     4) This function assumes that the FCB record size field (0Eh) is correctly
        set. If not set by the user, the default is 128 bytes.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


28h  Random Block Write to File Specified in FCB                        (FCB)
     Similar to 27h (Random Write) except allows multiple files to be read.
entry   AH      28h
        CX      number of records to write
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write
                01h     disk full, no data written
                02h     DTA too small for record size specified (write canceled)
        CX      number of records written
note 1) The record size is specified in the FCB.
     2) This service allocates disk clusters as required.
     3) This function assumes that the FCB Record Size field (offset 0Eh) is
        correctly set. If not set by the user, the default is 128 bytes.
     4) The record size is specified in the FCB. The service updates the Current
        Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h) fields to the next
        record not read.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h
     6) If called with CX=0, no records are written, but the FCB's File Size
        entry (offset 1Ch) is set to the size specified by the FCB's Relative
        Record field (offset 21h).


29h  Parse the Command Line for Filename                                (FCB)

                           string
                        1: extension left unchanged
                    4-7    must be zero
return  AL      00h     no wildcards in name or extension
                01h     wildcards appeared in name or extension

        DS:SI   pointer to the first character after the parsed string
        ES:DI   pointer to the unopened FCB
note 1) If the * wildcard characters are found in the command line, this service
        will replace all subsequent chars in the FCB with question marks.
     2) This service uses the characters as filename separators
        DOS 1       : ; . , + / [ ] = " TAB SPACE
        DOS 2,3     : ; . , + = TAB SPACE
     3) This service uses the characters
        : ; . , + < > | / \ [ ] = " TAB SPACE
        or any control characters as valid filename separators
     4) A filename cannot contain a filename terminator. If one is encountered,
        all processing stops. The handle functions will allow use of some of
        these characters.
     5) If no valid filename was found on the command line, ES:DI +1 points
        to a blank (ASCII 32).
     6) This function cannot be used with filespecs which include a path
     7) Parsing is in the form D:FILENAME.EXT. If one is found, a corresponding
        unopened FCB is built at ES:DI

                        06h     Saturday
note 1) Date is adjusted automatically if clock rolls over to the next day,
        and takes leap years and number of days in each month into account.
     2) Although DOS cannot set an invalid date, it can read one, such as
        1/32/80, etc.
     3) DesQview also accepts CX = 4445h and DX = 5351h, i.e. 'DESQ' as valid
     4) DOS will accept CH=0 (midnight) as a valid time, but if a file's time
        is set to exactly midnight the time will not be displayed by the DIR
        command.

return  none
note 1) This is the call invoked by the DOS VERIFY command
     2) Setting of the verify switch can be obtained by calling call 54h
     3) This call is not supported on network drives
     4) DOS checks this flag each time it accesses a disk


2Fh  Get Disk Transfer Address (DTA)
     Returns current disk transfer address used by all DOS read/write operations
entry   AH      2Fh
return  ES:BX   address of DTA
note 1) The DTA is set by function call 1Ah

entry   AH      30h
return  AH      minor version number  (i.e., DOS 2.10 returns AX = 0A02h)
        AL      major version number
        BH      OEM ID number
                00h     IBM
                16h     DEC
        BL:CX   24-bit user serial number
note 1) If AL returns a major version number of zero, the DOS version is
        below 1.28 for MSDOS and below 2.00 for PCDOS.
     2) IBM PC-DOS always returns 0000h in BX and CX.


31h  Terminate Process and Stay Resident
     KEEP, or TSR
entry   AH      31h
        AL      exit code

return  AX      return code (retrieveable by function 4Dh)
note 1) Files opened by the application are not closed when this call is made
     2) Memory can be used more efficiently if the block containing the copy of
        the DOS environment is deallocated before terminating. This can be done
        by loading ES with the segment contained in 2Ch of the PSP and issuing
        function call 49h (Free Allocated Memory).
     3) Unlike int 27h, more than 64k may be made resident with this call


32h  Read DOS Disk Block

note 1) Use [BX+0D] to find no. of clusters (>1000H, 16-bit FAT; if not, 12-bit
        (exact dividing line is probably a little below 1000h to allow for
        bad sectors, EOF markers, etc.)
     2) Short article by C.Petzold, PC Magazine  Vol.5,no.8, and the article
        "Finding Disk Parameters" in the May 1986 issue of PC Tech Journal.
     3) This call is mostly supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box. The
        dword at 12h will not return the address of the next device driver when
        in the Compatibility Box.

34h  Return INDOS Flag
 *   Returns ES:BX pointing to Critical Section Flag, byte indicating whether
     it is safe to interrupt DOS.
entry   AH      34h
return  ES:BX   points to DOS "critical section flag"
note 1) If byte is 0, it is safe to interrupt DOS. This was mentioned in some
        documentation by Microsoft on a TSR standard, and PC Magazine reports
        it functions reliably under DOS versions 2.0 through 3.3. Chris
        Dunford (of CED fame) and a number of anonymous messages on the BBSs
        indicate it may not be totally reliable.
     2) The byte at ES:BX+1 is used by the Print program for this same purpose,
        so it's probably safer to check the WORD at ES:BX.
     3) Reportedly, examination of DOS 2.10 code in this area indicates that the
        byte immediately following this "critical section flag" must be 00h to
        permit the PRINT.COM interrupt to be called. For DOS 3.0 and 3.1 (except
        Compaq DOS 3.0), the byte before the "critical section flag" must be
        zero; for Compaq DOS 3.0, the byte 01AAh before it must be zero.
     4) In DOS 3.10 this reportedly changed to word value, with preceding byte.
     5) This call is supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box
     6) Gordon Letwin of Microsoft discussed this call on ARPAnet in 1984. He
        stated:
        a) this is not supported under any version of the DOS
        b) it usually works under DOS 2, but there may be circumstances
           when it doesn't (general disclaimer, don't know of a specific
           circumstance)
        c) it will usually not work under DOS 3 and DOS 3.1; the DOS is
           considerably restructured and this flag takes on additional
           meanings and uses
        d) it will fail catastrophically under DOS 4.0 and forward.
        Obviously this information is incorrect since the call works fine
        through DOS 3.3. Microsoft glasnost?


35h  Get Vector
     Get interrupt vector
entry   AH      35h
        AL      interrupt number (hexadecimal)
return  ES:BX   address of interrupt vector
note    Use function call 25h to set the interrupt vectors


36h  Get Disk Free Space
     get information on specified drive
entry   AH      36h
        DL      drive number (0=default, 1=A:, 2=B:, etc)
return  AX      number of sectors per cluster
                0FFFFh means drive specified in DL is invalid
        BX      number of availible clusters
        CX      bytes per sector
        DX      clusters per drive
note 1) Mult AX * CX * BX for free space on disk
     2) Mult AX * CX * DX for total disk space
     3) Function 36h returns an incorrect value after an ASSIGN command. Prior
        to ASSIGN, the DX register contains 0943h on return, which is the free
        space in clusters on the HC diskette. After ASSIGN, even with no
        parameters, 0901h is returned in the DX register; this is an incorrect
        value. Similar results occur with DD diskettes on a PC-XT or a PC-AT.
        This occurs only when the disk is not the default drive. Results are as
        expected when the drive is the default drive. Therefore, the
        circumvention is to make the desired drive the default drive prior to
        issuing this function call.
     4) Int 21h, function call 36h returns an incorrect value after an ASSIGN
        command. Prior to ASSIGN, the DX register contains 0943h on return,
        which is the free space in clusters on the HC diskette. After ASSIGN,
        even with no parameters, 0901h is returned in the DX register; this is
        an incorrect value. Similar results occur with DD diskettes on a PC-XT
        or a PC-AT. This occurs only when the disk is not the default drive.
        Results are as expected when the drive is the default drive. Therefore,
        the circumvention is to make the desired drive the default drive prior
        to issuing this function call.
     5) This function supercedes functions 1Bh and 1Ch.


37h  SWITCHAR / AVAILDEV
 *   Get/set option marking character (is usually "/"), and device type
entry   AH      37h
        AL      00h     read switch character (returns current character in DL)
                01h     set character in DL as new switch character
      (DOS 2.x) 02h     read device availability (as set by function AL=3) into
                        DL. A 0 means devices that devices must be accessed in
                        file I/O calls by /dev/device. A non-zero value means
                        that devices are accessible at every level of the
                        directory tree (e.g., PRN is the printer and not a file
                        PRN).
                        AL=2 to return flag in DL, AL=3 to set from DL (0 = set,
                        1 = not set).
      (DOS 2.x) 03h     get device availability, where:
        DL      00h     means /dev/ must precede device names
                01h     means /dev/ need not precede device names
return  DL      switch character (if AL=0 or 1)
                device availability flag (if AL=2 or 3)
        AL      0FFh    the value in AL was not in the range 0-3.
note 1) Functions 2 & 3 appear not to be implemented for DOS 3.x.
     2) It is documented on page 4.324 of the MS-DOS (version 2) Programmer's
        Utility Pack (Microsoft - published by Zenith).
     3) Works on all versions of IBM PC-DOS from 2.0 through 3.3.1.
     4) The SWITCHAR is the character used for "switches" in DOS command
        arguments (defaults to '/', as in "DIR/P"). '-' is popular to make a
        system look more like UNIX; if the SWITCHAR is anything other than '/',
        then '/' may be used instead of '\' for pathnames
     5) Ignored by XCOPY, PKARC, LIST
     6) SWITCHAR may not be set to any character used in a filename
     7) In DOS 3.x you can still read the "AVAILDEV" byte with subfunction 02h
        but it always returns 0FFh even if you try to change it to 0 with
        subfunction 03h.
     8) AVAILDEV=0 means that devices must be referenced in an imaginary
        subdirectory "\dev" (similar to UNIX's /dev/*); a filename "PRN.DAT"
        can be created on disk and manipulated like any other. If AVAILDEV != 0
        then device names are recognized anywhere (this is the default):
        "PRN.DAT" is synonymous with "PRN:".
     9) These functions reportedly are not supported in the same fashion in
        various implementations of DOS.

note 1) When an alternate keyboard handler is invoked, the keyboard routine is
        loaded into user memory starting at the lowest portion of availible
        user memory. The BIOS interrupt vector that services the keyboard is
        redirected to the memory area where the new routine resides. Each new
        routine takes up about 1.6K of memory and has lookup tables that return
        values unique to each language. (KEYBxx in the DOS book)
         Once the keyboard interrupt vector is changed by the DOS keyboard
        routine, the new routine services all calls unless the system is
        returned to the US format by the ctrl-alt-F1 keystroke combination. This
        does not change the interrupt vector back to the BIOS location; it
        merely passes the table lookup to the ROM locations.
     2) Ctrl-Alt-F1 will only change systems with US ROMS to the US layout.
        Some systems are delivered with non-US keyboard handler routines in ROM
     3) Case mapping call: the segment/offset of a FAR procedure that performs
        country-specific lower-to-upper case mapping on ASCII characters 80h to
        0FFh. It is called with the character to be mapped in AL. If there is
        an uppercase code for the letter, it is returned in AL, if there is no
        code or the function was called with a value of less than 80h AL is
        returned unchanged.

                or error code (1, 2, 4, 5, 0Ch)
note 1) Opens any normal, system, or hidden file
     2) Files that end in a colon are not opened
     3) The rear/write pointer is set at the first byte of the file and the
        record size of the file is 1 byte (the read/write pointer can be changed
        through function call 42h). The returned file handle must be used for
        all subsequent input and output to the file.
     4) If the file handle was inherited from a parent process or was
        duplicated by DUP or FORCEDUP, all sharing and access restrictions are
        also inherited.
     5) A file sharing error (error 1) causes an int 24h to execute with an
        error code of 2

                1       error
        AX      error code if error (6)
note 1) When executed, the file is closed, the directory is updated, and all
        buffers for that file are flushed. If the file was changed, the time
        and date stamps are changed to current
     2) If called with the handle 00000, it will close STDIN (normally the
        keyboard).

                        or number of bytes read
                        or error code (5, 6)
note 1) This function attempts to transfer the number of bytes specified in CX
        to a buffer location. It is not guaranteed that all bytes will be read.
        If AX < CX a partial record was read.
     2) If performed from STDIN (file handle 0000), the input can be redirected
     3) If used to read the keyboard, it will only read to the first CR
     4) The file pointer is incremented to the last byte read.


40h  Write To A File Or Device
     Write to file with handle

                1       error
        AX      number of bytes written
                or error code  (5, 6)
note 1) This call attempts to transfer the number of bytes indicated in CX
        from a buffer to a file. If CX and AX do not match after the write,
        an error has taken place; however no error code will be returned for
        this problem. This is usually caused by a full disk.
     2) If the write is performed to STDOUT (handle 0001), it may be redirected
     3) To truncate the file at the current position of the file pointer, set
        the number of bytes in CX to zero before calling int 21h. The pointer
        can be moved to any desired position with function 42h.
     4) This function will not write to a file or device marked read-only.

4Bh  Load or Execute a Program
     (EXEC)
entry   AH      4Bh
        AL      00h     load and execute program. A PSP is built for the program
                        the ctrl-break and terminate addresses are set to the
                        new PSP.

                03h     load overlay (do not create PSP, do not begin execution)
        DS:DX   points to the ASCIIZ string with the drive, path, and filename
                to be loaded
        ES:BX   points to a parameter block for the load
               (AL=00h) word    segment address of environment string to be
                                passed
                        dword   pointer to the command line to be placed at
                                PSP+80h

                        word    relocation factor to be applied to the image
return  CF      clear   successful
                set     error
                AX      error code (1, 2, 8, 0Ah, 0Bh)
note 1) If you make this call with AL=1 the program will be loaded as if you
        made the call with AL=0 except that the program will not be executed.
        Additionally, with AL=1 the stack segment and pointer along with the
        program's CS:IP entry point are returned to the program which made the
        4B01h call. These values are put in the four words at ES:BX+0eh. On
        entry to the call ES:BX points to the environment address, the command
        line and the two default FCBs. This form of EXEC is used by DEBUG.COM.
     2) Application programs may invoke a secondary copy of the command
        processor (normally COMMAND.COM) by using the EXEC function.  Your
        program may pass a DOS command as a parameter that the secondary
        command processor will execute as though it had been entered from the
        standard input device.
        The procedure is:
         A. Assure that adequate free memory (17k for 2.x and 3.0, 23k for 3.1
            up) exists to contain the second copy of the command processor and
            the command it is to execute. This is accomplished by executing
            function call 4Ah to shrink memory allocated to that of your current
            requirements. Next, execute function call 48h with BX=0FFFFh. This
            returns the amount of memory availible.
        B. Build a parameter string for the secondary command processor in the
           form:
                         1 byte   length of parameter string
                        xx bytes  parameter string
                         1 byte   0Dh (carriage return)
           For example, the assembly language statement below would build the
           string to cause execution of the command FOO.EXE:
                              DB 19, "/C C:FOO" , 13
        C. Use the EXEC function call (4Bh), function value 0 to cause execution
           of the secondary copy of the command processor. (The drive,
           directory, and name of the command processor can be gotten from the
           COMSPEC variable in the DOS environment passed to you at PSP+2Ch.)
        D. Remember to set offset 2 of the EXEC control block to point to the
           string built above.
     3) All open files of a process are duplicated in the newly created
        process after an EXEC, except for files originally opened with the
        inheritance bit set to 1.
     4) The environment is a copy of the original command processor's
        environment. Changes to the EXECed environment are not passed back to
        the original. The environment is followed by a copy of the DS:DX
        filename passed to the child process. A zero value will cause the
        child process to inherit the environment of the calling process. The
        segment address of the environment is placed at offset 2Ch of the
        PSP of the program being invoked.
     5) This function uses the same resident part of COMMAND.COM, but makes a
        duplicate of the transient part.
     6) How EXEC knows where to return to:  Basically the vector for int 22h
        holds the terminate address for the current process.  When a process
        gets started, the previous contents of int 22h get tucked away in the
        PSP for that process, then int 22h gets modified.  So if Process A
        EXECs process B, while Process B is running, the vector for int 22h
        holds the address to return to in Process A, while the save location in
        Process B's PSP holds the address that process A will return to when
        *it* terminates.  When Process B terminates by one of the usual legal
        means, the contents of int 22h are (surmising) shoved onto the stack,
        the old terminate vector contents are copied back to int 22h vector from
        Process B's PSP, then a RETF or equivalent is executed to return control
        to process A.


4Ch  Terminate a Process (EXIT)
     Quit with exit code
entry   AH      4Ch
        AL      exit code in AL when called, if any, is passed to next process
return  none
note 1) Control passes to DOS or calling program
     2) return code from AL can be retrieved by ERRORLEVEL or function 4Dh
     3) all files opened by this process are closed, buffers are flushed, and
        the disk directory is updated
     4) Restores Terminate vector from PSP:000Ah
                 Ctrl-C vector from PSP:000Eh

                                        from the name and extension, and if an
                                        extension is present it is preceded by a
                                        period.
note 1) Will not find volume label
     2) This function does not support network operations
     3) Wildcards are allowed in the filespec
     4) If the attribute is zero, only ordinary files are found. If the volume
        label bit is set, only volume labels will be found. Any other attribute
        will return that attribute and all normal files together.
     5) To look for everything except the volume label, set the hidden, system,
        and subdirectory bits all to 1


4Fh  Find Next Matching File (FIND NEXT)
     Find next ASCIIZ
entry   AH      4Fh
return  CF      clear   data block written at current DTA
                set     AX      error code (2, 12h)
note 1) If file found, DTA is formatted as in call 4Eh
     2) Volume label searches using 4Eh/4Fh reportedly aren't 100% reliable
        under DOS 2.x. The calls sometime report there's a volume label and
        point to a garbage DTA, and if the volume label is the only item they
        often won't find it
     3) This function does not support network operations
     4) Use of this call assumes that the original filespec contained wildcards


50h   Set PSP
 *    Set new Program Segment Prefix; current process ID
entry   AH      50h
        BX      segment address of new PSP
return  none - swaps PSP's regarded as current by DOS
note 1) By putting the PSP segment value into BX and issuing call 50h DOS stores
        that value into a variable and uses that value whenever a file call is
        made.
     2) Note that in the PSP (or PDB) is a table of 20 (decimal) open file
        handles. The table starts at offset 18h into the PSP. If there is an
        0FFh in a byte then that handle is not in use. A number in one of the
        bytes is an index into an internal FB table for that handle. For
        instance the byte at offset 18h is for handle 0, at offset 19h handle
        1, etc. up to 13h. If the high bit is set then the file associated by
        the handle is not shared by child processes EXEC'd with call 4Bh.
     3) Function 50h is dangerous in background operations prior to DOS 3.x as
        it uses the wrong stack for saving registers.  (same as functions
        0..0Ch in DOS 2.x)
     4) Under DOS 2.x, this function cannot be invoked inside an int 28h handler
        without setting the Critical Error flag
     5) Open File information, etc. is stored in the PSP DOS views as current.
        If a program (eg. a resident program) creates a need for a second PSP,
        then the second PSP should be set as current to make sure DOS closes
        that as opposed to the first when the second application finishes.
     6) See PC Mag Vol.5, No 9, p.314 for discussion.


51h   Get Program Segment Prefix
 *    Returns the PSP address of currently executing program
entry   AH      51h
return  BX      address of currently executing program
note 1) Used in DOS 2.x, 3.x uses 62h
     2) Function 51h is dangerous in background operations prior to DOS 3.x as
        it uses the wrong stack for saving registers.  (same as functions
        0..0Ch in DOS 2.x)
     3) 50h and 51h might be used if you have more than one process in a PC.
        For instance if you have a resident program that needs to open a file
        you could first call 51h to save the current id and then call 50h to set
        the ID to your PSP.
     4) Under DOS 2.x, this function cannot be invoked inside an int 28h handler


52h     IN-VARS

return  ES:BX   pointer to the DOS list of lists, for disk information. Does not

53h  Translate BPB
 *   Translates BPB (BIOS Parameter Block, see below) into a DOS Disk Block (see
     function call 32h).

55h  Create "Child" PSP
 *   Create PSP: similar to function 26h (which creates a new Program Segment
     Prefix at segment in DX) except creates a "child" PSP rather than copying
     the existing one.
entry   AH      55h
        DX      segment number at which to create new PSP.
return  unknown
note 1) This call is similar to call 26h which creates a PSP except that unlike
        call 26h the segment address of the parent process is obtained from the
        current process ID rather than from the CS value on the stack (from the
        INT 21h call). DX has the new PSP value and SI contains the value to be
        placed into PSP:2 (top of memory).
     2) Function 55 is merely a substitute for function 26h. It will copy the
        current PSP to the segment address DX with the addition that SI is
        assumed to hold the new memory top segment. This means that function
        26h sets SI to the segment found in the current PSP and then calls
        function 55h.


56h  Rename a File
     if the first file exists, it is renamed to the name in ES:DI

note 1) Works with files in same drive only
     2) Global characters not allowed in filename
     3) The name of a file is its full pathname. The file's full pathname can
        be changed, while leaving the actual FILENAME.EXT unchanged. Changing
        the pathname allows the file to be "moved" from subdirectory to
        subdirectory on a logical drive without actually copying the file.
     4) DOS 3.x allows renaming of directories

        fit. The get subfunction returns the last value set, so programs should
        check whether the value is greater than or equal to 2.


59h  Get Extended Error Code (DOS 3.x)
     returns additional error information when requested
      The Get Extended Error function call (59h) is intended to provide a common
     set of error codes and to supply more extensive information about the error
     to the application. The information returned from function call 59h, in
     addition to the error code, is the error class, the locus, and the
     recommended action. The error class provides information about the error
     type (hardware, internal, system, etc.). The locus provides information
     about the area involved in the failure (serial device, block device,
     network, or memory). The recommended action provides a default action for
     programs that do not understand the specific error code.
       Newly written programs should use the extended error support both from
     interrupt 24h hard error handlers and after any int 21h function calls. FCB
     function calls report an error by returning 0FFh in AL. Handle function
     calls report an error by setting the carry flag and returning the error
     code in AX. Int 21h handle function calls for DOS 2.x continue to return
     error codes 0-18. Int 24h handle function calls continue to return error
     codes 0-12. But the application can obtain any of the error codes used in
     the extended error codes table by issuing function call 59h. Handle
     function calls for DOS 3.x can return any of the error codes. However, it
     is recommended that the function call be followed by function call 59h to
     obtain the error class, the locus, and the recommended action.
       The Get Extended Error function (59h) can always be called, regardless of
     whether the previous DOS call was old style (error code in AL) or new style
     (carry bit). It can also be used inside an int 24h handler.
      You can either check AL or the carry bit to see if there was no error,
     and call function 59h only if there was an error, or take the simple
     approach of always calling 59h and letting it tell you if there was an
     error or not. When you call function 59h it will return with AX=0 if the
     previous DOS call was successful.

note 1) Not all DOS functions use the carry flag to indicate an error. Carry
        should be tested only on those functions which are documented to use it.
     2) None of the DOS functions which existed before 2.0 use the carry
        indicator.  Many of them use register AL as an error indication instead,
        usually by putting 0FFh in AL on an error. Most, but not all, the "new"
        (2.x, 3.x) functions do use carry, and most, but not all, of the "old"
        (1.x) functions use AL.
     3) On return, CL, DI, DS, DX, ES, BP, and SI are destroyed - save before
        calling this function if required.
     4) DOS 2.x Error Codes:  If you are using function calls 38h-57h with DOS
        2.x, to check if an error has occurred, check for the following error
        codes in the AX register:

                        Interrupts 22h Through 86h


Interrupt 22h   Terminate Address
(0:0088h)
 This interrupt transfers control to the far (dword) address at this interrupt
location when an application program terminates. The default address for this
interrupt is 0:0088h through 0:008Bh. This address is copied into the program's
Program Segment Prefix at bytes 0Ah through 0Dh at the time the segment is
created and is restored from the PSP when the program terminates. The calling
program is normally COMMAND.COM or an application. Do not issue this interrupt
directly, as the EXEC function call does this for you. If an application
spawns a child process, it must set the Terminate Address prior to issuing the
EXEC function call, otherwise when the second program terminated it would
return to the calling program's Terminate Address rather than its own. This
address may be set with int 21, function 25h.



Interrupt 23h   Ctrl-Break Exit Address
(0:008Ch)
 If the user enters a Ctrl-Break during STDIN, STDOUT, STDPRN, or STDAUX, int
23h is executed. If BREAK is on, int 23h is checked on MOST function calls
(notably 06h). If the user written Ctrl-Break routine saves all registers, it
may end with a return-from-interrupt instruction (IRET) to continue program
execution. If the user-written interrupt program returns with a long return, the
carry flag is used to determine whether the program will be aborted. If the
carry flag is set, the program is aborted, otherwise execution continues (as
with a return by IRET). If the user-written Ctrl-Break interrupt uses function
calls 09h or 0Ah, then ctrl-C/CR/LF are output. If execution is continued with
an IRET, I/O continues from the start of the line. When the interrupt occurs,
all registers are set to the value they had when the original function call to
DOS was made. There are no restrictions on what the Ctrl-Break handler is
allowed to do, including DOS function calls, as long as the registers are
unchanged if an IRET is used. If the program creates a new segment and loads a
second program which itself changes the Ctrl-Break address, the termination of
the second program and return to the first causes the Ctrl-Break address to
be restored from the PSP to the value it had before execution of the second
program.



Interrupt 24h   Critical Error Handler
(0:0090h)
 When a critical error occurs within DOS, control is transferred to an error
handler with an int 24h. This may be the standard DOS error handler (ABORT,
RETRY, IGNORE) or a user-written routine.
 On entry to the error handler, AH will have its bit 7=0 (high order bit)
if the error was a disk error (probably the most common error), bit 7=1 if
not.
 BP:SI contains the address of a Device Header Control Block from which
additional information can be retrieved (see below).
 The register is set up for a retry operation and an error code is in the
lower half of the DI register with the upper half undefined. These are the
error codes:

 The user stack is in effect and contains the following from top to bottom:

        IP      DOS registers from issuing int 24h
        CS      int 24h
        flags
        AX      user registers at time of signal
        BX      int 21h request
        CX
        DX
        SI
        DI
        BP
        DS
        ES
        IP      from original int 21h
        CS
        flags

 To reroute the critical error handler to a user-writen critical error handler,
the following should be done:

Before an int 24h occurs:
1) The user application initialization code should save the int 24h vector and
   replace the vector with one pointing to the user error routine.

When the int 24h occurs:
2) When the user error routine received control it should push the flag
   registers onto the stack and execute a far call to the original int 24h
   vector saved in step 1.
3) DOS gives the appropriate prompt, and waits for user input (Abort, Retry,
   Ignore, Fail). After the user input, DOS returns control to the user error
   routine instruction following the far call.
4) The user error routine can now do any tasks nescessary. To return to the
   original application at the point the error occurred, the error routine needs
   to execute an IRET instruction. Otherwise, the user error routine should
   remove the IP, CS, and flag registers from the stack. Control can then be
   passed to the desired point.


 Int 24h provides the following values in registers on entry to interrupt

handler must return

 The registers are set such that if an IRET is executed, DOS responds according
to (AL) as follows:
 AL     00h  ignore the error
        01h  retry the operation
        02h  terminate via int 22h
        03h  fail the system call that is in progress (DOS 3.2+)
note 1) Be careful when choosing to ignore a response because this causes DOS to
        beleive that an operation has completed successfully when it may not
        have.
     2) If the error was a character device, the contents of AL are invalid.



OTHER ERRORS

 If AH bit 7=1, the error occurred on a character device, or was the result of
a bad memory image of the FAT. The device header passed in BP:SI can be examined
to determine which case exists. If the attribute byte high-order bit indicates
a block device, then the error was a bad FAT. Otherwise, the error is on a
character device.
 If a character device is involved, the contents of AL are unpredictable, the
error code is in DI as above.

Notes:
1.  Before giving this routine control for disk errors, DOS performs several
    retries. The number of retries varies according to the DOS version.
2.  For disk errors, this exit is taken only for errors occurring during an
    int 21h function call. It is not used for errors during an int 25h or 26h.
3.  This routine is entered in a disabled state.
4.  All registers must be preserved.
5.  This interrupt handler should refrain from using DOS function calls. If
    necessary, it may use calls 01h through 12h. Use of any other call destroys
    the DOS stack and leaves DOS in an unpredictable state.
6.  The interrupt handler must not change the contents of the device header.
7.  If the interrupt handler handles errors itself rather than returning to DOS,
    it should restore the application program's registers from the stack,
    remove all but the last three words on the stack, then issue an IRET. This
    will return to the program immediately after the int 21h that experienced
    the error. Note that if this is done DOS will be in an unstable state until
    a function call higher than 12h is issued, therefore not recommended.
8.  For DOS 3.x, IGNORE requests (AL=0) are converted to FAIL for critical
    errors that occur on FAT or DIR sectors.
9.  For DOS 3.10 up, IGNORE requests (AL=0) are converted to FAIL requests
    for network critical errors (50-79).

The device header pointed to by BP:SI is as follows:

DWORD Pointer to next device (0FFFFh if last device)

WORD Attributes:

Bit     15      1       if character device.
                        If bit 15 is 1:
                        Bit 0 = 1 if current standard input
                        Bit 1 = 1 if current standard output
                        Bit 2 = 1 if current NULL device
                        Bit 3 = 1 if current CLOCK device
                0       if block device
Bit 14 is the IOCTL bit
WORD pointer to device driver strategy entry point
WORD pointer to device driver interrupt entry point
8-BYTE character device named field for block devices. The first byte is the
number of units.
 To tell if the error occurred on a block or character device, look at bit 15
in the attribute field (WORD at BP:SI+4).
 If the name of the character device is desired, look at the eight bytes
starting at BP:SI+10.


HANDLING OF INVALID RESPONSES (DOS 3.x)

        A) If IGNORE (AL=0) is specified by the user and IGNORE is not allowed
           (bit 5=0), make the response FAIL (AL=3).
        B) If RETRY (AL=1) is specified by the user and RETRY is not allowed
           (bit 4=0), make the response FAIL (AL=3).
        C) If FAIL (AL=3) is specified by the user and FAIL is not allowed (bit
           3=0), make the response ABORT. (AL=2)




Interrupt 25h   Absolute Disk Read
Interrupt 26h   Absolute Disk Write
(0:0094h, 0:0098h)
  These transfer control directly to the device driver. On return, the original
flags are still on the stack (put there by the INT instruction). This is
necessary because return information is passed back in the current flags.
  The number of sectors specified is transferred between the given drive and the
transfer address. Logical sector numbers are obtained by numbering each sector
sequentially starting from track 0, head 0, sector 1 (logical sector 0) and
continuing along the same head, then to the next head until the last sector on
the last head of the track is counted.  Thus, logical sector 1 is track 0, head
0, sector 2; logical sector 2 is track 0, head 0, sector 3; and so on. Numbering
then continues wih sector 1 on head 0 of the next track. Note that although the
sectors are sequentially numbered (for example, sectors 2 and 3 on track 0 in
the example above), they may not be physically adjacent on disk, due to
interleaving. Note that the mapping is different from that used by DOS 1.10 for
dual-sided diskettes.

The request is as follows:

note 1) Original flags on stack! Be sure to pop the stack to prevent
        uncontrolled growth
     2) Ints 25 and 26 will try rereading a disk if they get an error the first
        time.
     3) All registers except the segment registers are destroyed by these calls



Interrupt 27h   Terminate And Stay Resident
(0:009Ch)       (obsolete)
 This vector is used by programs that are to remain resident when COMMAND.COM
regains control.
 After initializing itself, the program must set DX to its last address plus
one relative to the program's initial DS or ES value (the offset at which other
programs can be loaded), then execute interrupt 27h. DOS then considers the
program as an extension of itself, so the program is not overlaid when other
programs are executed. This is useful for loading programs such as utilities
and interrupt handlers that must remain resident.

entry   CS      current program segment
        DX      last program byte + 1
return  none
note 1) This interrupt must not be used by .EXE programs that are loaded into
        the high end of memory.
     2) This interrupt restores the interrupt 22h, 23h, and 24h vectors in the
        same manner as interrupt 20h.  Therefore, it cannot be used to install
        permanently resident Ctrl-Break or critical error handler routines.
     3) The maximum size of memory that can be made resident by this method is
        64K.
     4) Memory can be more efficiently used if the block containing a copy of
        the environment is deallocated before terminating. This can be done by
        loading ES with the segment contained in 2Ch of the PSP, and issuing
        function call 49h (Free Allocated Memory).
     5) DOS function call 4Ch allows a program to pass a completion code to DOS,
        which can be interpreted with processing (see function call 31h).
     6) Terminate and stay resident programs do not close files.
     7) Int 21, function 31h is the preferred method to cause a program to
        remain resident because this allows return information to be passed and
        allows a program larger than 64K to remain resident.



Interrupt 28h   (not documented by Microsoft)
           *    DOS Idle Interrupt
 This interrupt is continuously called by DOS itself whenever it is in a wait
state (i.e., when it is waiting for keyboard input) during a function call of
01h through 0Ch. DOS uses 3 separate internal stacks: one for calls 01h through
0Ch; another for calls 0Dh and above; and a third for calls 01h through 0Ch when
a Critical Error is in progress. When int 28h is called, any calls above 0Ch can
be executed without destroying the internal stack used by DOS at the time.
 It is used primarily by the PRINT.COM routines, but any number of other
routines can be chained to it by saving the original vector and calling it with
a FAR call (or just JMPing to it) at the end of the new routine.
 Int 28h is being issued it is usually safe to do DOS calls. You won't get int
28hs if a program is running that doesn't do its keyboard input through DOS. You
should rely on the timer interrupt for these.
 Int 28h is not called at all when any non-trivial foreground task is running.
As soon as a foreground program has a file open, INT28 no longer gets called.
Could make a good driver for for abackground program that really works as long
as there is nothing else going on in the machine.

entry   no parameters availible
return  none
note 1) The int 28h handler may invoke any int 21h function except functions
        00h through 0Ch (and 50h/51h under DOS 2.x).
     2) Apparently int 28h is also called during screen writes
     3) Until some program installs its own routine, this interrupt vector
        simply points to an IRET opcode.
     4) Supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box

note 1) Documented by Digital Research's DOS Reference as provided with the

     3) Works on the IBM PC and compatibles, Wang PC, HP-150 and Vectra, DEC
        Rainbow, NEC APC, Texas Instruments PC and others
     4) This interrupt is called from the DOS's output routines if output is
        going to a device rather than a file, and the device driver's attribute
        word has bit 3 (04h) set to "1".
     5) This call has been tested with MSDOS 2.11, PCDOS 2.1, PCDOS 3.1, PCDOS
        3.2, and PCDOS 3.3.
     6) Used in IBMBIO.COM as a vector to int 10, function 0Eh (write TTY)
        followed by an IRET.

Interrupt 2Eh   (undocumented by Microsoft)
           *    Internal Routine for DOS  (Alternate EXEC)

  This interrupt passes a command line addressed by DS:SI to COMMAND.COM. The
command line must be formatted just like the unformatted parameter area of a
Program Segment Prefix. That is, the first byte must be a count of characters,
and the second and subsequent bytes must be a command line with parameters,
terminated by a carriage return character.
  When executed, int 2Eh will reload the transient part of the command
interpreter if it is not currently in memory. If called from a program that
was called from a batch file, it will abort the batch file. If executed from a
program which has been spawned by the EXEC function, it will abort the whole
chain and probably lock up the computer. Int 2Eh also destroys all registers
including the stack pointer.
  Int 2Eh is called from the transient portion of the program to reset the DOS
PSP pointers using the above Functions #81 & #80, and then reenters the
resident program.
  When called with a valid command line, the command will be carried out by
COMMAND.COM just as though you had typed it in at the DOS prompt. Note that the
count does not include the carriage return. This is an elegant way to perform a
SET from an application program against the master environment block for
example.

note 1) Destroys all registers including stack pointer
     2) Seems to work OK in both DOS 2.x and 3.x
     3) It is reportedly not used by DOS.
     4) As far as known, int 2Eh is not used by DOS 3.1, although it was called
        by COMMAND.COM of PCDOS 3.0, so it appears to be in 3.1 only for the
        sake of compatibility.



Interrupt 2Fh   Multiplex Interrupt

 Interrupt 2Fh is the multiplex interrupt. A general interface is defined
between two processes. It is up to the specific application using interrupt
2Fh to define specific functions and parameters.
 Every multiplex interrupt handler is assigned a specific multiplex number.
The multiplex number is specified in the AH register; the AH value tells which
program your request is directed toward. The specific function that the handler
is to perform is placed in the AL register. Other parameters are places in the
other registers as needed. The handlers are chained into the 2Fh interrupt
vector and the multiplex number is checked to see if any other application is
using the same multiplex number. There is no predefined method for assigning a
multiplex number to a handler. You must just pick one. To avoid a conflict if
two applications choose the same multiplex number, the multiplex numbers used by
an application should be patchable. In order to check for a previous
installation of the current application, you can search memory for a unique
string included in your program. If the value you wanted in AH is taken but
you don't find the string, then another application has grabbed that location.
 Int 2Fh was not documented under DOS 2.x. There is no reason not to use int 2Fh
as the multiplex interrupt in DOS 2.x. The only problem is that DOS does not
initialize the int 2Fh vector, so when you try to chain to it like you are
supposed to, it will crash. But if your program checks the vector for being zero
and doesn't chain in that case, it will work for you in 2.x just the same as
3.x.
 Int 2Fh doesn't require any support from DOS itself for it to be used in
application programs. It's not handled by DOS, but by the programs themselves.
The only support DOS has to provide is to initialize the vector to an IRET. DOS
3.2 does itself contain some int 2Fh handlers - it uses values of 08h, 13h, and
0F8h. There may be more.

                        This call must be defined by all int 2Fh handlers. It
                        is used by the caller of the handler to determine if
                        the handler is present. On entry, AL=0. On return, AL
                        contains the installed state as follows:

                     DOS CONTROL BLOCKS AND WORK AREAS

When DOS loads a program, it first sets aside a section of memory for the 
program called the program segment, or code segment. Then it constructs a 
control block called the program segment prefix, or PSP, in the first 256 
(100h) bytes. Usually, the program is loaded directly after the PSP at 
100h.
 The PSP contains various information used by DOS to help run the program.  
The PSP is always located at offset 0 within the code segment. When a program 
recieves control certain registers are set to point to the PSP. For a COM 
file, all registers are set to point to the beginning of the PSP and the 
program begins at 100h. For the more complex EXE file structures, only DS and 
ES registers are set to point to the PSP. The linker passes the settings for 
the DS, IP, SS, and SP registers and may set the starting location in CS:IP to 
a location other than 100h.



IBMBIO provides an IRET instruction at absolute address 847h for use as a 
dummy routine for interrupts that are not used by DOS. This lets the 
interrupts do nothing until their vectors are rerouted to ttheir appropriate 
handlers.

A storage block is used by DOS to record the amount and location of allocated 
memory withion the machine's address spacd.
 A storage block, a Program Segment Prefix, and an environment area are built 
by FDOS for each program currently resident in the address space. The storage 
block is used by DOS to record the address range of memory allocated to a 
program. IOt us used by DOs to find th enext availible area to load  a program 
and to determine if there is a\enough memory to run that porogram. When a 
memory area is in use, it is said to be allocated. Then the program ends, or 
releases memory, it is said to bne deallocated. 
 A storage block contains a pointer ro rhe Program Segment Prefix assoiciated 
with each program. This control block is constructed by IBMDOS for the purpose 
opf providing stanfdardized areas for DOS/program communication., Within ghr 
PSP are arsas which  are used to save interrupt vectors, pass parameters to 
the program, record disk directory information, and to buffer disk reads and 
writes. This control block is 100h bytes in lengrth and is followed by the 
program mopdule loaded by DOS. 
 The PSP contains a pointer to the environment area for that program. This 
area contains a copy of the current DOS SET, PROMPT, COMSPEC, and PATH values 
as well as any user-set variables. The program may examine and modify this 
information as desired. 
 Each storage block is 10h bytes long, although only 5 bytes are currently 
used by DOS. The first byte contains 4Dh (a capital M) to indicate that it 
contains a pointer to the next storage block. A 5Ah (a capital Z) in the 
first byte of a storage block indicatres there are no more storage blocks 
following this one (it is the end of the chain). The identifier byte is 
followeed by a 2 byte segment number for the associated PSP for that program. 
The next 2 bytes contain the number of segments what are allocated to the 
program. If this is not the last storage block, then another storage block 
follows the allocated memory area.
 When thge storage block contains zero for the nuymber of allocated segments, 
then no storage is allocated to thius block and the next storage block 
immediately follows this one. This can ha-p[en whjen memory is allocated and 
then deallocated repeatedly.
 IBMDOS constructs a storage block and PSP before loading the command 
interpreter (default is COMMAND.COM).


If the copy of COMMAND.COM is a secondary copy, it will lack an environment 
address as PSP+2Ch.
 


 The Disk Transfer Area (DTA)

 DOS uses an area in memory to contain the data for all file reads and writes 
that are performed with FCB function calls. This are is known as the disk 
transfer area. This disk transfer area (DTA) is sometimes called a buffer. 
It can be located anywhere in the data area of your application program and 
should be set by your program.

 Only one DTA can be in effect at a time, so your program must tell DOS what 
memory location to use before using any disk read or write functions. Use 
function call 1Ah (Set Disk Transfer Address) to set the disk transfer address.
Use function call 2Fh (Get Disk Transfer Address) to get the disk transfer 
address. Once set, DOS continues to use that area for all disk operations until
another function call 1Ah is issued to define a new DTA. When a program is given
control by COMMAND.COM, a default DTA large enough to hold 128 bytes is 
established at 80h into the program's Program Segment Prefix.

 For file reads and writes that are performed with the extended function calls,
there is no need to set a DTA address. Instead, specify a buffer address when 
you issue the read or write call.


DOS Program Segment

 When you enter an external command or call a program through the EXEC function 
call, DOS determines the lowest availible address space to use as the start of 
available memory for the program being started. This area is called the Program
Segment.
 At offset 0 within the program segment, DOS builds the Program Segment Prefix 
control block. EXEC loads the program after the Program Segment Prefix (at
offset 100h) and gives it control.
 The program returns from EXEC by a jump to offset 0 in the Program Segment 
Prefix, by issuing an int 20h, or by issuing an int 21h with register AH=00h or 
4Ch, or by calling location 50h in the PSP with AH=00h or 4Ch.
 It is the responsibility of all programs to ensure that the CS register 
contains the segment address of the Program Segment Prefix when terminating by
any of these methods except call 4Ch.

 All of these methods result in returning to the program that issued the EXEC. 
During this returning process, interrupt vectors 22h, 23h, and 24h (Terminate, 
Ctrl-Break, and Critical Error Exit addresses) are restored from the values 
saved in the PSP of the terminating program. Control is then given to the 
terminate address.


When a program receives control, the following conditions are in effect:

For all programs:

1) The segment address of the passed environment is contained at offset 2Ch in 
   the Program Segment Prefix.

2) The environment is a series of ASCII strings totalling less than 32k bytes
   in the form:       NAME=parameter      The default environment is 160 bytes.
    Each string is terminated by a byte of zeroes, and the entire set of strings
   is terminated by abother byte of zeroes. Following the byte of zeroes that 
   terminates the set of environment string is a set of initial arguments passed
   to a program that contains a word count followed by an ASCIIZ string. The 
   ASCIIZ string contains the drive, path, and filename.ext of the executable 
   program. Programs may use this area to determine where the program was loaded
   from. The environment built by the command processor (and passed to all 
   programs it invokes) contains a COMSPEC=string at a minimum (the parameter on
   COMSPEC is the path used by DOS to locate COMMAND.COM on disk). The last PATH
   and PROMPT commands issued will also be in the environment, along with any 
   environment strings entered through the SET command. 
    The environment that you are passed is actually a copy of the invoking 
   process's environment. If your application terminates and stays resident 
   through int 27h, you should be aware that the copy of the environment passed 
   to you is static. That is, it will not change even if subsequent PATH,
   PROMPT, or SET commands are issued.
 
   The environment can be used to transfer information between processes or to
   store strings for later use by application programs. The environment is
   always located on a paragraph boundary. This is its format:
        byte    ASCIIZ string 1
        byte    ASCIIZ string 2
            ....
        byte    ASCIIZ string n
        byte    of zeros (0)
   Typically the environment strings have the form:
        parameter = value
   Following the byte of zeros in the environment, a WORD indicates the number 
   of other strings following. 

   If the environment is part of an EXECed command interpreter, it is followed 
   by a copy of the DS:DX filename passed to the child process. A zero value 
   causes the newly created process to inherit the parent's environment.

3) Offset 80h in the PSP contains code to invoke the DOS function dispatcher.
   Thus, by placing the desired function number in AH, a program can issue a
   long call to PSP+50h to invoke a DOS function rather than issuing an int 21h.

4) The disk transfer address (DTA) is set to 80h (default DTA in PSP).

5) File Control Blocks 5Ch and 6Ch are formatted from the first two parameters 
   entered when the command was invoked. Note that if either parameter contained
   a path name, then the corresponding FCB will contain only a valid drive
   number. The filename field will not be valid.

6) An unformatted parameter area at 81h contains all the characters entered
   after the command name (including leading and imbedded delimiters), with 80h
   set to the number of characters. If the <, >, or | parameters were entered
   on the command line, they (and the filenames associated with them) will not
   appear in this area, because redirection of standard input and output is
   transparent to applications.

(For EXE files only)
7) DS and ES registers are set to point to the PSP.

8) CS, IP, SS, and SP registers are set to the values passed by the linker.

(For COM files only)
9) For COM files, offset 6 (one word) contains the number of bytes availible in 
   the segment.

10) Register AX reflects the validity of drive specifiers entered with the
    first two parameters as follows:
        AL=0FFh is the first parameter contained an invalid drive specifier,
                otherwise AL=00h.
        AL=0FFh if the second parameter contained an invalid drive specifier, 
                otherwise AL=00h.

11) All four segment registers contain the segment address of the inital 
    allocation block, that starts within the PSP control block. All of user
    memory is allocated to the program. If the program needs to invoke another
    program through the EXEC function call (4Bh), it must first free some memory
    through the SETBLOCK function call to provide space for the program being
    invoked.

12) The Instruction Pointer (IP) is set to 100h.

13) The SP register is set to the end of the program's segment. The segment size
    at offset 6 is rounded down to the paragraph size.

14) A word of zeroes is placed on top of the stack.


 The PSP (with offsets in hexadecimal) is formatted as follows:


     P  R  O  G  R  A  M       S  E  G  M  E  N  T       P  R  E  F  I  X

 002Eh  34 bytes  reserved, DOS work area                                   

          4 bytes   stores the calling process's stack pointer when          
                    switching to DOS's internal stack.

 00FFh  128 bytes command tail and default Disk Transfer Area (DTA)         


1. The first segment of availible memory is in segment (paragraph) form. For 
   example, 1000h would respresent 64k.

2. The word at offset 6 contains the number of bytes availible in the segment.

3. Offset 2Ch contains the segment address of the environment.

4. Programs must not alter any part of the PSP below offset 5Ch.

offset 0 contains hex bytes CD 20, the int 20h opcode. A program can end
       by making a jump to this location when the CS points to the PSP.
       For normal cases, int 21, function 4Ch should be used.

offset 2 contains the segment-paragraph address of the end of memory as 
        reported by DOS. (which may not be the same as the real end of RAM).
        Multiply this number by 10h or 16 to get the amount of memory availible.

offset 4 reserved

offset 05 contains a long call to the DOS function dispatcher. Programs may 
       jump to this address instead of calling int 21 if they wish. 

offsets 10, 14, 18  vectors

offset 2C is the segment:offset address of the environment for the program 
       using this particular PSP.

offset 2E The DWORD at PSP+2EH is used by DOS to store the calling process's
       stack pointer when switching to DOS's own private stack - at the end of
       a DOS function call, SS:SP is restored from this address.

offset 50h contains a long call to the DOS function dispatcher.

offsets 5C, 65, 6C  contain FCB information for use with FCB function calls. 
        The first FCB may overlay the second if it is an extended call; your
        program should revector these areas to a safe place if you intend to
        use them.

offset 80h and 81h contain th elength and value of parameters passed on the 
       command line. 

offset FF contains the DTA




STANDRD FILE CONTROL BLOCK

 The standard file control block is defined as follows, with the offsets in 
decimal:


                 F I L E      C O N T R O L      B L O C K                    

 Bytes                            Function                                   

   0    Drive number. For example:                                           
        Before open:    00h = default drive                                  
                        01h = drive A:                                       
                        02h = drive B: etc.                                  
        After open:     00h = drive C:                                       
                        01h = drive A:                                       
                        02h = drive B: etc.                                  
        0 is replaced by the actual drive number during open.                

  1-8   Filename, left justified with trailing blanks. If a reserved device  
        name is placed here (such as PRN) do not include the optional colon. 

  9-11  Filename extension, left justified with trailing blanks.             

 12-13  Current block number relative to beginning of file, starting with 0  
        (set to 0 by the open function call). A block consists of 128        
        records, each of the size specified in the logical record size field.
        The current block number is used with the current record field       
        (below) for sequential reads and writes.                             

 14-15  Logical record size in bytes. Set to 80h by the OPEN function call.  
        If this is not correct, you must set the value because DOS uses it   
        to determine the proper locations in the file for all disk reads and 
        writes.                                                              

 16-19  File size in bytes. In this 2 word field, the first word is the      
        low-order part of the size.                                          

 20-21  Date the file was created or last updated. The mm/dd/yy are mapped   
        as follows:                                                          
                15  14  13  12  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0         
                y   y   y   y   y   y   y  m  m  m  m  d  d  d  d  d         
        where:            mm is 1-12                                         
                          dd is 1-31                                         
                          yy is 0-119 (1980-2099)                            

 22-31  Reserved for system use.                                             

  32    Current relative record number (0-127) within the current block.     
        (See above). You must set this field before doing sequential         
        read/write operations to the diskette. This field is not initialized 
        by the open function call.                                           
         If the record size is less than 64 bytes, both words are used.      
        Otherwise, only the first 3 bytes are used. Note that if you use the 
        File Control Block at 5Ch in the program segment, the last byte of   
        the FCB overlaps the first byte of the unformatted parameter area.   


note 1) An unopened FCB consists of the FCB prefix (if used), drive number, and 
        filename.ext properly filled in. An open FCB is one in which the 
        remaining fields have been filled in by the CREAT or OPEN function 
        calls.
     2) Bytes 0-5 and 32-36 must be set by the user program. Bytes 16-31 are set
        by DOS and must not be changed by user programs.
     3) All word fields are stored with the least significant byte first. For 
        example, a record length of 128 is stored as 80h at offset 14, and 00h 
        at offset 15.



EXTENDED FILE CONTROL BLOCK

 The extended file control block is used to create or search for files in the 
disk directory that have special attributes.

It adds a 7 byte prefix to the FCB, formatted as follows:


       E X T E N D E D     F I L E      C O N T R O L      B L O C K          

 Bytes                            Function                                   

   0    Flag byte containing 0FFh to indicate an extended FCB.               

  1-6   Reserved                                                             

  6-7   Attribute byte. Refer to function call 11h (search first) for        
        details on using the attribute bits during directory searches. This  
        function is present to allow applications to define their own files  
        as hidden (and thereby excluded from normal directory searches) and  
        to allow selective directory searches.                               

                                     
 Any reference in the DOS function calls to an FCB, whether opened or unopened,
may use either a normal or extended FCB. If you are using an extended FCB, the 
appropriate register should be set to the first byte of the prefix, rather than
the drive-number field.



MEMORY CONTROL BLOCKS

 DOS keeps track of allocated and availible memory blocks, and provides three 
function calls for application programs to communicate their memory needs to 
DOS. These calls are 48h to allocate a memory block, 49h to free a previously 
allocated memory block, and 4Ah (SETBLOCK) to change the size of an allocated 
memory block.


CONTROL BLOCK

DOS manages memory as follows:

 DOS build a control block for each block of memory, whether free or allocated.
For example, if a program issues an "allocate" (48h), DOS locates a block of
free memory that satisfies the request, and then "carves" the requested memory 
out of that block. The requesting program is passed the location of the first 
byte of the block that was allocated for it - a memory management control block,
describing the allocated block, has been built for the allocated block and a 
second memory management control block describes the amount of space left in the
original free block of memory. When you do a setblock to shrink an allocated 
block, DOS builds a memory management control block for the area being freed and
adds it to the chain of control blocks. Thus, any program that changed memory 
that is not allocated to it stands a chance of destroying a DOS memory 
management control block. This causes unpredictable results that don't show up 
until an activity is performed where DOS uses its chain of control blocks. The 
normal result is a memory allocation error, which means a system reset will be 
required.

 When a program (command or application program) is to be loaded, DOS uses the 
EXEC function call 4Bh to perform the loading.

 This is the same function call that is availible to applications programs for 
loading other programs. This function call has two options:

      Function 00h, to load and execute a program (this is what the command
                    processor uses to load and execute external commands)

      Function 03h, to load an overlay (program) without executing it.

 Although both functions perform their loading in the same way (relocation is 
performed for EXE files) their handling of memory management is different.


FUNCTION 0: For function 0 to load and execute a program, EXEC first allocates 
the largest availible block of memory (the new program's PSP will be at offset 
0 in that block). Then EXEC loads the program. Thus, in most cases, the new 
program owns all the memory from its PSP to the end of memory, including memory
occupied by the transient parent of COMMAND.COM. If the program were to issue 
its own EXEC function call to load and execute another program, the request 
would fail because no availible memory exists to load the new program into.

NOTE: For EXE programs, the amount of memory allocated is the size of the 
      program's memory image plus the value in the MAX_ALLOC field of the file's
      header (offset 0Ch, if that much memory is availible. If not, EXEC 
      allocates the size of the program's memory image plus the value in the 
      MIN_ALLOC field in the header (offset 0Ah). These fields are set by the 
      Linker).

 A well-behaved program uses the SETBLOCK function call when it receives 
control, to shrink its allocated memory block down to the size it really needs.
A COM program should remember to set up its own stack before doing the SETBLOCK,
since it is likely that the default stack supplied by DOS lies in the area of 
memory being used. This frees unneeded memory, which can be used for loading 
other programs.

 If the program requires additional memory during processing, it can obtain 
the memory using the allocate function call and later free it using the free 
memory function call.

 When a program is loaded using EXEC function call 00h exits, its initial 
allocation block (the block beginning with its PSP) is automatically freed 
before the calling program regains control. It is the responsibility of all 
programs to free any memory they allocate before exiting to the calling 
program.


 FUNCTION 3: For function 3, to load an overlay, no PSP is built and EXEC 
assumes the calling program has already allocated memory to load the new program
into - it will NOT allocate memory for it. Thus the calling program should 
either allow for the loading of overlays when it determines the amount of memory
to keep when issuing the SETBLOCK call, or should initially free as much memory 
as possible. The calling program should then allocate a block (based on the size
of the program to be loaded) to hold the program that will be loaded using the 
"load overlay" call. Note that "load overlay" does not check to see if the 
calling program actually owns the memory block it has been instructed to load 
into - it assumes the calling program has followed the rules. If the calling 
program does not own the memory into which the overlay is being loaded, there is
a chance the program being loaded will overlay one of the control blocks that 
DOS uses to keep track of memory blocks.

 Programs loaded using function 3 should not issue any SETBLOCK calls since
they don't own the memory they are operating in. (This memory is owned by the
calling program)

 Because programs loaded using function 3 are given control directly by (and 
return contrrol directly to) the calling program, no memory is automatically 
freed when the called program exits. It is up to the calling program to 
determine the disposition of the memory that had been occupied by the exiting 
program. Note that if the exiting program had itself allocated any memory, it 
is responsible for freeing that memory before exiting.


 MEMORY CONTROL BLOCKS

 Only the first 5 bytes of the memory control block are used. The first byte 
will always have the value of 4Dh or 5Ah. The value 5Ah indicates the block is 
the last in a chain, all memory above it is unused. 4Dh means that the block is
intermediate in a chain, the memory above it belongs to the next program or to 
DOS.

 The next two bytes hold the PSP segment address of the program that owns the 
corresponding block of memory. A value of 0 means the block is free to be 
claimed, any other value represents a segment address. Bytes 3 and 4 indicate 
the size in paragraphs of the memory block. If you know the address of the first
block, you can find the next block by adding the length of the memory block plus
1 to the segment address of the control block. 

 Finding the first block can be difficult, as this varies according to the DOS 
version and the configuration. 

 The remaining 11 bytes are not currently used by DOS, and may contain "trash" 
characters left in memory from previous applications.

  If DOS determines that the allocation chain of memory control blocks has been 
corrupted, it will halt the system and display the message "Memory Allocation 
Error", and the system will halt, requiring a reboot.

 Each memory block consists of a signature byte (4Dh or 5Ah) then a word which
is the PSP value of the owner of the block (which allocated it), followed by a 
word which is the size in paragraphs of the block. The last block has a 
signature of 5Ah. All others have 4Dh. If the owner is 0000 then the block is 
free.

 User memory is allocated from the lowest end of available memory that will 
satisfy the request for memory.

                             DOS File Structure


File Management Functions

 Use DOS function calls to create, open, close, read, write, rename, find, and 
erase files. There are two sets of function calls that DOS provides for support
of file management. They are:

* File Control Block function calls   (0Fh-24h)
* Handle function calls               (39h-62h)

 Handle function calls are easier to use and are more powerful than FCB calls.
Microsoft recommends that the handle function calls be used when writing new
programs. DOS 3.0 up have been curtailing use of FCB function calls; it is
possible that future versions of DOS may not support FCB function calls.
 The following table compares the use of FCB calls to Handle function calls:

                FCB Calls                       Handle Calls

        Access files in current         Access files in ANY directory
        directory only.

        Requires the application        Does not require use of an FCB.
        program to maintain a file      Requires a string with the drive,
        control block to open,          path, and filename to open, create,
        create, rename or delete        rename, or delete a file. For file
        a file. For I/O requests,       I/O requests, the application program
        the application program         must maintain a 16 bit file handle
        also needs an FCB               that is supplied by DOS.

 The only reason an application should use FCB function calls is to maintain
the ability to run under DOS 1.x. To to this, the program may use only function
calls 00h-2Eh.


FCB FUNCTION CALLS

 FCB function calls require the use of one File Control Block per open file, 
which is maintained by the application program and DOS. The application program
supplies a pointer to the FCB and fills in ther appropriate fields required by 
the specific function call. An FCB function call can perform file management on
any valid drive, but only in the current logged directory. By using the current
block, current record, and record length fields of the FCB, you can perform 
sequential I/O by using the sequential read or write function calls. Random I/O
can be performed by filling in the random record and record length fields. 

 Several possible uses of FCB type calls are considered programming errors and 
should not be done under any circumstances to avoid problems with file sharing
and compatibility with later versions of DOS.
 Some errors are:
1) If program uses the same FCB structure to access more than one open file. By
   opening a file using an FCB, doing I/O, and then replacing the filename field
   in the file control block with a new filename, a program can open a second
   file using the same FCB. This is invalid because DOS writes control info-
   rmation about the file into the reserved fields of the FCB. If the program
   then replaces the filename field with the original filename and then tries to
   perform I/O on this file, DOS may become confused because the control info-
   rmation has been changed. An FCB should never be used to open a second file
   without closing the one that is currently open. If more than one File Control
   Block is to be open concurrently, separate FCBs should be used.

2) A program should never try to use the reserved fields in the FCB, as the
   function of the fields changes with different versions of DOS.

3) A delete or a rename on a file that is currently open is considered an error
   and should not be attempted by an application program.

 It is also good programming practice to close all files when I/O is done. This
avoids potential file sharing problems that require a limit on the number of
files concurrently open using FCB function calls.



HANDLE FUNCTION CALLS

 The recommended method of file management is by using the extended "handle" 
set of function calls. These calls are not restricted to the current directory.
Also, the handle calls allow the application program to define the type of 
access that other processes can have concurrently with the same file if the file
is being shared.

 To create or open a file, the application supplies a pointer to an ASCIIZ 
string giving the name and location of the file. The ASCIIZ string contains an 
optional drive letter, optional path, mandatory file specification, and a 
terminal byte of 00h. The following is an example of an ASCIIZ string:

                  format [drive][path] filename.ext,0

                      DB "A:\path\filename.ext",0

 If the file is being created, the application program also supplies the 
attribute of the file. This is a set of values that defines the file read 
only, hidden, system, directory, or volume label.

 If the file is being opened, the program can define the sharing and access 
modes that the file is opened in. The access mode informs DOS what operations 
your program will perform on this file (read-only, write-only, or read/write) 
The sharing mode controls the type of operations other processes may perform 
concurrently on the file. A program can also control if a child process inherits
the open files of the parent. The sharing mode has meaning only if file sharing
is loaded when the file is opened.

 To rename or delete a file, the appplication program simply needs to provide 
a pointer to the ASCIIZ string containing the name and location of the file 
and another string with the neew name if the file is being renamed.

 The open or create function calls return a 16-bit value referred to as the 
file handle. To do any I/O to a file, the program uses the handle to reference
the file. Once a file is opened, a program no longer needs to maintain the 
ASCIIZ string pointing to the file, nor is there any need to stay in the same 
directory. DOS keeps track of the location of the file regardless of what 
directory is current.

 Sequential I/O can be performed using the handle read (3Fh) or write (40h) 
function calls. The offset in the file that IO is performed to is automatically
moved to the end of what was just read or written. If random I/O is desired, the
LSEEK (42h) function call can be used to set the offset into the file where I/O 
is to be performed.


SPECIAL FILE HANDLES

 DOS reserves five special file handles for use by itself and applications 
programs. They are:

              0000h   STDIN   Standard Input Device
              0001h   STDOUT  Standard Output Device
              0002h   STDERR  Standard Error Output Device
              0003h   STDAUX  Standard Auxiliary Device
              0004h   STDPRN  Standard Printer Device

 These handles are predefined by DOS and can be used by an application program.
They do not need to be opened by a program, although a program can close these 
handles. STDIN should be treated as a read-only file, and STDOUT and STDERR 
should be treated as write-only files. STDIN and STDOUT can be redirected. All 
handles inherited by a process can be redirected, but not at the command line.

 These handles are very useful for doing I/O to and from the console device. 
For example,  you could read input from the keyboard using the read (3Fh) 
function call and file handle 0000h (STDIN), and write output to the console 
screen with the write function call (40h) and file handle 0001h (STDOUT). If 
you wanted an output that could not be redirected, you could output it using 
file handle 0002h (STDERR). This is very useful for error messages that must 
be seen by a user.

 File handles 0003h (STDAUX) and 0004h (STDPRN) can be both read from and 
written to. STDAUX is typically a serial device and STDPRN is usually a parallel
device.


ASCII and BINARY MODE

 I/O to files is done in binary mode. This means that the data is read or 
written without modification. However, DOS can also read or write to devices in
ASCII mode. In ASCII mode, DOS does some string processing and modification to 
the characters read and written. The predefined handles are in ASCII mode when 
initialized by DOS. All other file handles that don't refer to devices are in 
binary mode. A program, can use the IOCTL (44h) function call to set the mode 
that I/O is to a device. The predefined file handles are all devices, so the 
mode can be changed from ASCII to binary via IOCTL. Regular file handles that 
are not devices are always in binary mode and cannot be changed to ASCII mode.

 The ASCII/BINARY bit was called "raw" in DOS 2.x, but it is called ASCII/BINARY
in DOS 3.x.

 The predefined file handles STDIN (0000h) and STDOUT (0001h) and STDERR 
(0002h) are all duplicate handles. If the IOCTL function call is used to change
the mode of any of these three handles, the mode of all three handles is 
changed. For example, if IOCTL was used to change STDOUT to binary mode, then 
STDIN and STDERR would also be changed to binary mode.



FILE I/O IN BINARY (RAW) MODE

The following is true when a file is read in binary mode:

1)  The characters ^S (scroll lock), ^P (print screen), ^C (control break) are 
    not checked for during the read. Therefore, no printer echo occurs if ^S or
    ^P are read.
2)  There is no echo to STDOUT (0001h).
3)  Read the number of specified bytes and returns immediately when the last 
    byte is received or the end of file reached.
4)  Allows no editing of the ine input using the function keys if the input is 
    from STDIN (0000h).


The following is true when a file is written to in binary mode:

1)  The characters ^S (scroll lock), ^P (print screen), ^C (control break) are 
    not checked for during the write. Therefore, no printer echo occurs.
2)  There is no echo to STDOUT (0001h).
3)  The exact number of bytes specified are written.
4)  Does not caret (^) control characters. For example, ctrl-D is sent out as 
    byte 04h instead of the two bytes ^ and D.
5)  Does not expand tabs into spaces. 


FILE I/O IN ASCII (COOKED) MODE

The following is true when a file is read in ASCII mode:

1)  Checks for the characters ^C,^S, and ^P.
2)  Returns as many characters as there are in the device input buffer, or the 
    number of characters requested, whichever is less. If the number of 
    characters requested was less than the number of characters in the device 
    buffer, then the next read will address the remaining characters in the 
    buffer.
3)  If there are no more bytes remaining in the device input buffer, read a 
    line (terminated by ^M) into the buffer. This line may be edited with the 
    function keys. The characters returned terminated with a sequence of 0Dh,
    0Ah (^M,^J) if the number of characters requested is sufficient to include
    them. For example, if 5 characters were requested, and only 3 were entered
    before the carriage return (0Dh or ^M) was presented to DOS from the console
    device, then the 3 characters entered and 0Dh and 0Ah would be returned. 
    However, if 5 characters were requested and 7 were entered before the 
    carriage return, only the first 5 characters would be returned. No 0Dh,0Ah 
    sequence would be returned in this case. If less than the number of 
    characters requested are entered when the carriage return is received, the
    characters received and 0Dh,0Ah would be returned. The reason the 0Ah 
    (linefeed or ^J) is added to the returned characters is to make the devices
    look like text files.
4)  If a 1Ah (^Z) is found, the input is terminated at that point. No 0Dh,0Ah 
    (CR,LF) sequence is added to the string.
5)  Echoing is performed.
6)  Tabs are expanded.


The following is true when a file is written to in ASCII mode:

1)  The characters ^S,^P,and ^C are checked for during the write operation.
2)  Expands tabs to 8-character boundaries and fills with spaces (20h).
3)  Carets control characters, for example, ^D is written as two bytes, ^ and D.
4)  Bytes are output until the number specified is output or a ^Z is 
    encountered. The number actually output is returned to the user.


NUMBER OF OPEN FILES ALLOWED

 The number of files that can be open concurrently is restricted by DOS. This 
number is determined by how the file is opened or created (FCB or handle 
function call) and the number specified by the FCBS and FILES commands in the 
CONFIG.SYS file. The number of files allowed open by FCB function calls and the
number of files that can be opened by handle type calls are independent of one 
another.


RESTRICTIONS ON FCB USAGE

 If file sharing is not loaded using the SHARE command, there are no 
restrictions on the nuumber of files concurrently open using FCB function calls.

 However, when file sharing is loaded, the maximum number of FCBs open is set
by the the FCBS command in the CONFIG.SYS file.

 The FCBS command has two values you can specify, 'm' and 'n'. The value for 
'm' specifies the number of files that can be opened by FCBs, and the value 'n' 
specifies the number of FCBs that are protected from being closed.

 When the maximum number of FCB opens is exceeded, DOS automatically closes the
least recently used file. Any attempt to access this file results in an int 24h
critical error message "FCB not availible". If this occurs while an application
program is running, the value specified for 'm' in the FCBS command should be
increased.

 When DOS determines the least recently used file to close, it does not include
the first 'n' files opened, therefore the first 'n' files are protected from 
being closed.


RESTRICTIONS ON HANDLE USAGE

 The number of files that can be open simultaneously by all processes is 
determined by the FILES command in the CONFIG.SYS file. The number of files a 
single process can open depends on the value specified for the FILES command. If
FILES is greater than or equal to 20, a single process can open 20 files. If 
FILES is less than 20, the process can open less than 20 files. This value 
includes three predefined handles: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. This means only
17 additional handles can be added. DOS 3.3 includes a function to use more than
20 files per application.

ALLOCATING SPACE TO A FILE

 Files are not nescessarily written sequentially on a disk. Space is allocated 
as needed and the next location availible on the disk is allocated as space for
the next file being written. Therefore, if considerable file generation has
taken place, newly created files will not be written in sequential sectors.
However, due to the mapping (chaining) of file space via the File Allocation
Table (FAT) and the function calls availible, any file may be used in either a
sequential or random manner.

 Space is allocated in increments called clusters. Cluster size varies 
according to the media type. An application program should not concern itself 
with the way that DOS allocates space to a file. The size of a cluster is only 
important in that it determines the smallest amount of space that can be 
allocated to a file. A disk is considered full when all clusters have been 
allocated to files.



MSDOS / PCDOS DIFFERENCES

 There is a problem of compatibility between MS-DOS and IBM PC-DOS having to 
do with FCB Open and Create. The IBM 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 documentation of OPEN
(call 0Fh) contains the following statement:

 "The current block field (FCB bytes C-D) is set to zero [when an FCB is 
opened]."

 This statement is NOT true of MS-DOS 1.25 or MS-DOS 2.00. The difference is
intentional, and the reason is CP/M 1.4 compatibility. Zeroing that field is 
not CP/M compatible. Some CP/M programs will not run when machine translated if
that field is zeroed. The reason it is zeroed in the IBM versions is that IBM 
specifically requested that it be zeroed. This is the reason for the complaints
from some vendors about the fact that IBM MultiPlan will not run under MS-DOS.
It is probably the reason that some other IBM programs don't run under MS-DOS.

NOTE: Do what all MS/PC-DOS Systems programs do: Set every single FCB field you
want to use regardless of what the documentation says is initialized.



.EXE FILE STRUCTURE

 The EXE files produced by the Linker program consist of two parts, control and
relocation information and the load module itself.

 The control and relocation information, which is described below, is at the 
beginning of the file in an area known as the header. The load module 
immediately follows the header. The load module begins in the memory image of 
the module contructed by the Linker.

 When you are loading a file with the name *.EXE, DOS does NOT assume that it
is an EXE format file. It looks at the first two bytes for a signature telling
it that it is an EXE file. If it has the proper signature, then the load 
proceeds. Otherwise, it presumes the file to be a .COM format file.

 If the file has the EXE signature, then the internal consistency is checked.
Pre-2.0 versions of MSDOS did not check the signature byte for EXE files.

 The .EXE format can support programs larger than 64K. It does this by 
allowing separate segments to be defined for code, data, and the stack, each 
of which can be up to 64K long. Programs in EXE format may contain explicit 
references to segment addresses. A header in the EXE file has information for 
DOS to resolve these references.


The .EXE header is formatted as follows:

 Offset                        C O N T E N T S                              

   00h    4Dh  This is the Linker's signature to mark the file as a valid   
 .EXE file  (The ASCII letters M and Z, for Mark Zbikowski,  
   01h    5Ah  one of the major designers of DOS at Microsoft)             

 02h-03h  Length of the image mod 512 (remainder after dividing the load    
          module image by 512)                                              

 04h-05h  Size of the file in 512 byte pages including the header.           

 06h-07h  Number of relocation table items.                                 

 08h-09h  Size of the header in 16 byte increments (paragraphs). This is    
          used to locate the beginning of the load module in the file.      

 0Ah-0Bh  Minimum number of 16 byte paragraphs required above the end of    
          the loaded program.                                               

 0Ch-0Dh  Maximum number of 16 byte paragraphs required above the end of    
          the loaded program.                                               

 0Eh-0Fh  Displacement in paragraphs of stack segment within load module.   

 10h-11h  Offset to be in SP register when the module is given control.     

 12h-13h  Word Checksum - negative sum of all the words in the file,        
          ignoring overflow.                                                

 14h-15h  Offset to be in the IP register when the module is given control. 

 16h-17h  Displacement in paragraphs of code segment within load module.    

 18h-19h  Displacement in bytes of the first relocation item in the file.   

 1Ah-1Bh  Overlay number (0 for the resident part of the program)           




THE RELOCATION TABLE

 The word at 18h locates the first entry in the relocation table. The 
relocation table is made up of a variable number of relocation items. The number
of items is contained at offset 06-07. The relocation item contains two fields
- a 2 byte offset value, followed by a 2 byte segment value. These two fields 
represent the displacement into the load module before the module is given 
control. The process is called relocation and is accomplished as follows:

1. A Program Segment Prefix is built following the resident portion of the 
   program that is performing the load operation.

2. The formatted part of the header is read into memory (its size is at 
   offset 08-09)

3. The load module size is determined by subtracting the header size from the 
   file size. Offsets 04-05 and 08-09 can be used for this calculation. The 
   actual size is downward adjusted based on the contents of offsets 02-03. 
   Note that all files created by the Linker programs prior to version 1.10 
   always placed a value of 4 at this location, regardless of the actual 
   program size. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that this field be ignored if 
   it contains a value of 4. Based on the setting of the high/low loader switch,
   an appropriate segment is determined for loading the load module. This
   segment is called the start segment.

4. The load module is read into memory beginning at the start segment. The
   relocation table is an ordered list of relocation items. The first relocation
   item is the one that has the lowest offset in the file. 

5. The relocation table items are read into a work area one or more at a time.

6. Each relocation table item segment value is added to the start segment value.
   The calculated segment, in conjunction with the relocation item offset value,
   points to a word in the load module to which is added the start segment 
   value. The result is placed back into the word in the load module.

7. Once all the relocation items have been processed, the SS and SP registers 
   are set from the values in the header and the start segment value is added 
   to SS. The ES and DS registers are set to the segment address of the program 
   segment prefix. The start segment value is added to the header CS register 
   value. The result, along with the header IP value, is used to give the 
   module control.


"NEW" .EXE FORMAT (Microsoft Windows and OS/2)

 The "old" EXE format is documented here. The "new" EXE format puts more 
information into the header section and is currently used in applications that 
run under Microsoft Windows. The linker that creates these files comes with the 
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit and is called LINK4. If you try to 
run a Windows-linked program under DOS, you will get the error message "This 
program requires Microsoft Windows".

                          DOS DISK INFORMATION


THE DOS AREA

 All disks and diskettes formatted by DOS are created with a sector size of 512
bytes. The DOS area (entire area for a diskette, DOS partition for hard disks)
is formatted as follows:

        Boot record - 1 sector
        First copy of the FAT - variable size
        Second copy of the FAT - same size as first copy
        Root directory - variable size
        Data area

The following sections describe each of the allocated areas: 


THE BOOT RECORD

 The boot record resides on track 0, sector 1, side 0 of every diskette 
formatted by the DOS FORMAT program. It is put on all disks to provide an error
message is you try to start up with a nonsystem disk in drive A:. For hard disks
the boot record resides on the first sector of the DOS partition.


THE DOS FILE ALLOCATION TABLE (FAT)

 This section explains how DOS uses the FAT to convert the clusters of a file 
into logical sector numbers. We recommend that system utilities use the DOS 
handle calls rather than interpreting the FAT.

 The FAT is used by DOS to allocate disk space for files, one cluster at a time.

 The FAT consists of a 12 bit entry (1.5 bytes) for each cluster on the disk or
a 16 bit (2 bytes) entry when a hard disk has more than 20740 sectors as is the
case with fixed disks larger than 10Mb.
 The first two FAT entries map a portion of the directory; these FAT entries 
contain indicators of the size and format of the disk. The FAT can be in a 12 
or 16 bit format. DOS determines whether a disk has a 12 or 16 bit FAT by 
looking at the total number of allocation units on a disk. For all diskettes 
and hard disks with DOS partitions less than 20,740 sectors, the FAT uses a 12 
bit value to map a cluster. For larger partitions, DOS uses a 16 bit value.
 The second, third, and fourth bit applicable for 16 bit FAT bytes always 
contains 0FFFFh. The first byte is used as follows:

The third FAT entry begins mapping the data area (cluster 002).

NOTE: These values are provided as a reference. Therefore, programs should not 
      make use of these values.

 Each entry contains a hexadecimal character (or 4 for 16 bit FATs). () 
indicates the high order four bit value in the case of 16 bit FAT entries. 
They can be:

            (0)000h  if the cluster is unused and availible

(0F)FF8h - (0F)FFFh  to indicate the last cluster of a file

            (X)XXXh  any other hexadecimal numbers that are the cluster number
                     of the next cluster in the file. The cluster number is the
                     first cluster in the file that is kept in the file's 
                     directory entry.

 The values (0F)FF0h - (0F)FF7h are used to indicate reserved clusters. 
(0F)FF7h indicates a bad cluster if it is not part of the allocation chain. 
(0F)FF8h - (0F)FFFh are used as end of file markers.

 The file allocation table always occupies the sector or sectors immediately 
following the boot record. If the FAT is larger than 1 sector, the sectors 
occupy consecutive sector numbers. Two copies of the FAT are written, one 
following the other, for integrity. The FAT is read into one of the DOS buffers
whenever needed (open, allocate more space, etc).


USE OF THE 12 BIT FILE ALLOCATION TABLE

Obtain the starting cluster of the file from the directory entry.

Now, to locate each subsequent sector of the file:

1. Multiply the cluster number just used by 1.5 (each FAT entry is 1.5 
   bytes long).
2. The whole part of the product is offset into the FAT, pointing to the entry 
   that maps the cluster just used. That entry contains the cluster number of 
   the next cluster in the file.
3. Use a MOV instruction to move the word at the calculated FAT into a register.
4. If the last cluster used was an even number, keep the low order 12 bits of 
   the register, otherwise, keep the high order 12 bits.
5. If the resultant 12 bits are (0FF8h-0FFFh) no more clusters are in the file.
   Otherwise, the next 12 bits contain the cluster number of the next cluster in
   the file. 

  To convert the cluster to a logical sector number (relative sector, such as 
that used by int 25h and 26h and DEBUG):

1. Subtract 2 from the cluster number
2. Multiply the result by the number of sectors per cluster.
3. Add the logical sector number of the beginning of the data area.


USE OF THE 16 BIT FILE ALLOCATION TABLE

 Obtain the starting cluster of the file from the directory entry. Now to 
locate each subsequent cluster of the file:

1.  Multiply the cluster number used by 2 (each FAT entry is 2 bytes long).
2.  Use the MOV word instruction to move the word at the calculated FAT offset 
    into a register.
3.  If the resultant 16 bits are (0FF8h-0FFFFh) no more clusters are in the 
    file. Otherwise, the 16 bits contain the cluster number of the next cluster 
    in the file. 

 Compaq DOS makes availible a new disk type (6) with 32 bit partition values, 
allowing 512 megabytes per hard disk (Compaq DOS 3.3.1)



DOS DISK DIRECTORY

 The FORMAT command initially builds the root directory for all disks. Its 
location (logical sector number) and the maximum number of entries are 
availible through the device driver interfaces.



DIRECTORY ENTRIES 

 Since directories other than the root directory are actually files, there is 
no limit to the number of entries that they may contain. 

 All directory entries are 32 bytes long, and are in the following format (byte
and offset are decimal). The following paragraphs describe the directory entry 
bytes:

*BYTES 0-7
 Bytes 0-7 represent the filename. The first byte of the filename indicates the 
status of the filename. The status of a filename can contain the following 
values:

   00h Filename never used. This is used to limit the length of directory 
       searches, for performance reasons.
   05h Indicates that the first character of the filename actually has an 0Edh 
       character.
  0E5h Filename has been used but the file has been erased.
   2Eh This entry is for a directory. If the second byte is also 2Eh, the 
       cluster field contains the cluster number of this directory's parent 
       directory.  (0000h if the parent directory is the root directory).
                                                 
Any other character is the first character of a filename.

*BYTES 8-10
 These bytes indicate the filename extension.

*BYTE 11
 This byte indicates the file's attribute. The attribute byte is mapped as 
 follows (values are in hexadecimal):

NOTE: Attributes 08h and 10h cannot be changed using function call 43h (CHMOD).

 The system files IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM (or customized equivalent) are 
marked as read-only, hidden, and system files. Files can be marked hidden when 
they are created. Also, the read-only, hidden, and system and archive attributes
may be changed through the CHMOD function call.

01h Indicates that the file is marked read-only. An attempt to open the file 
    for output using function call 3Dh results in an error code being returned. 
    This value can be used with other values below.

02h Indicates a hidden file. The file is excluded from normal directory 
    searches.

04h Indicates a system file. This file is excluded from normal directory 
    searches.

08h Indicates that the entry contains the volume label in the first 11 bytes. 
    The entry contains no other usable information and may exist only in the 
    root directory.

20h Indicates an archive bit. This bit is set on whenever the file is written 
    to and closed. It is used by BACKUP and RESTORE.

All other bits are reserved, and must be 0.

*BYTES 12-21
 reserved by DOS


*BYTES 22-23
 These bytes contain the time when the file was created or last updated. The 
time is mapped in the bits as follows:
      
               B Y T E    23                  B Y T E    22

       H   H   H   H   H  M   M   M   M   M   M  D   D   D   D   D 
      
       binary # hrs 0-23  binary # minutes 0-59  bin. # 2-sec incr 
      

NOTE: The time is stored with the least significant byte first.


*BYTES 24-25
 This area contains the date when the file was created or last updated. The 
mm/dd/yy are mapped in the bits as follows:

      
               B Y T E    25                  B Y T E    24

       Y   Y   Y   Y   Y   Y   Y  M   M   M   M  D   D   D   D   D 
      
            0-119 (1980-2099)         1-12             1-31        
      

NOTE: The date is stored with the least significant byte first.


*BYTES 26-27
 This area contains the starting cluster number of the first cluster in the 
file. The first cluster for data space on all fixed disks and floppy disks is 
always cluster 002. The cluster number is stored with the least significant 
byte first.


*BYTES 28-31
 This area contains the file size in bytes. The first word contains the low 
order part of the size. Both words are stored with the least significant byte 
first.

  26      2 bytes number of sides, heads, or cylinders (1 or 2 for floppy)
  28      2 bytes number of special reserved sectors


THE DATA AREA

 Allocation of space for a file (in the data area) is done only when needed 
(it is not preallocated). The space is allocated one cluser (unit allocation) 
at a time. A cluster is always one or more consecutive sector numbers, and all 
of the clusters in a file are "chained" together in the FAT. 

 The clusters are arranged on disk to minimize head movement for multisided 
media. All of the space on a track (or cylinder) is allocated before moving 
on to the next track. This is accomplished by using the sequential sector 
numbers on the lowest-numbered head, then all the sector numbers on the next 
head, and so on until all sectors of all heads of the track are used. Then the 
next sector used will be sector 1 of head 0 on the next track.

 An interesting innovation that was introduced in MS-DOS 3.0: disk space that 
is freed by erasing a file is not re-used immediately, unlike earlier versions 
of DOS. Instead, free space is obtained from the area not yet used during the 
current session, until all of it is used up. Only then will space that is freed
during the current session be re-used.

 This feature minimizes fragmentation of files, since never-before-used space
is always contiguous. However, once any space has been freed by deleting a file,
that advantage vanishes at the next system boot. The feature also greatly
simplifies un-erasing files, provided that the need to do an un-erase is found
during the same session and also provided that the file occupies contiguous 
clusters.

 However, when one is using programs which make extensive use of temporary
files, each of which may be created and erased many times during a session,
the feature becomes a nuisance; it forces the permanent files to move farther
and farther into the inner tracks of the disk, thus increasing rather than
decreasing the amount of fragmentation which occurs.

 The feature is implemented in DOS by means of a single 16-bit "last cluster
used" (LCU) pointer for each physical disk drive; this pointer is a part of
the physical drive table maintained by DOS. At boot time, the LCU pointer is
zeroed. Each time another cluster is obtained from the free-space pool (the
FAT), its number is written into the LCU pointer. Each time a fresh cluster
is required, the FAT is searched to locate a free one; in older versions of
DOS this search always began at Cluster 0000, but in 3.x it begins at the
cluster pointed to by the LCU pointer.

 For hard disks, the size of the file allocation table and directory are 
determined when FORMAT initializes it and are based on the size of the DOS 
partition.

The following table gives the specifications for floppy disk formats:

               # of   sectors  FAT size    DIR        DIR     sectors  total

 Files in the data area are not nescessarily written sequentially on the first.
The data area space is allocated one cluster at a time, skipping over clusters 
already allocated. The first free cluster found is the next cluster allocated, 
regardless of its physical location on the disk. This permits the most efficient
utilization of disk space because clusters freed by erasing files can be 
allocated for new files. Refer back to the description of the DOS FAT in this 
chapter for more information.


Hard Disk Layout

 The DOS hard disk routines perform the following services:

1) Allow multiple operating systems to utilize the hard disk without the need 
   to backup and restore files when changing operating systems.

2) Allow a user-selected operating system to be started from the hard disk.
   
   I) In order to share the hard disk among operating systems, the disk may be 
      logically divided into 1 to 4 partitions. The space within a given 
      partition is contiguous, and can be dedicated to a specific operating 
      system. Each operating system may "own" only one partition in DOS versions
      2.0 through 3.2. PCDOS 3.3 introduced the "Extended DOS Partition" which 
      allows multiple DOS partitions on the same hard disk. The FDISK.COM (or 
      similar program from other DOS vendors) utility allows the user to select
      the number, type, and size of each partition. The partition information is
      kept in a partition table that is embedded in the master fixed disk boot 
      record on the first sector of the disk. The format of this table varies 
      from version to version of DOS.

  II) An operating system must consider its partition to be the entire disk, 
      and must ensure that its functions and utilities do not access other 
      partitions on the disk. 

 III) Each partition may contain a boot record on its first sector, and any 
      other programs or data that you choose - including a copy of an operating 
      system. For example, the DOS FORMAT command may be used to format and 
      place a copy of DOS in the DOS partition in the same manner that a 
      diskette is formatted. With the FDISK utility, you may designate a 
      partition as "active" (bootable). The master hard disk boot record causes
      that partition's boot record to receive control when the system is started
      or reset. Additional disk partitions could be FORTH, UNIX, Pick, CP/M-86,
      or the UCSD p-System.



SYSTEM INITIALIZATION

The boot sequence is as follows:

1. System initialization first attempts to load an operating system from 
   diskette drive A. If the drive is not ready or a read error occurs, it then 
   attempts to read a master hard disk boot record on the first sector of the 
   first hard disk in the system. If unsuccessful, or if no hard disk is 
   present, it invokes ROM BASIC in an IBM PC or displays a disk error 
   message on most compatibles.

2. If initialization is successful, the master hard disk boot record is given 
   control and it examines the partition table embedded within it. If one of 
   the entries indicates an active (bootable) partition, its boot record is 
   read from the partition's first sector and given control.

3. If none of the partitions is bootable, ROM BASIC is invoked on an IBM PC or
    a disk error on most compatibles.

4. If any of the boot indicators are invalid, or if more than one indicator is 
   marked as bootable, the message INVALID PARTITION TABLE is displayed and the 
   system stops.

5. If the partition's boot record cannot be successfully read within five 
   retries due to read errors, the message ERROR LOADING OPERATING SYSTEM 
   appears and the system stops.

6. If the partition's boot record does not contain a valid "signature", the 
   message MISSING OPERATING SYSTEM appears, and the system stops.

NOTE: When changing the size or location of any partition, you must ensure that
      all existing data on the disk has been backed up. The partitioning program
      will destroy the data on the disk.



BOOT RECORD/PARTITION TABLE

 A boot record must be written on the first sector of all hard disks, and 
must contain the following:

1. Code to load and give control to the boot record for one of four possible 
   operating systems.

2. A partition table at the end of the boot record. Each table entry is 16 
   bytes long, and contains the starting and ending cylinder, sector, and head 
   for each of four possible partitions, as well as the number of sectors 
   preceding the partition and the number of sectors occupied by the partition. 
   The "boot indicator" byte is used by the boot record to determine if one of 
   the partitions contains a loadable operating system. FDISK initialization 
   utilities mark a user-selected partition as "bootable" by placing a value 
   of 80h in the corresponding partition's boot indicator (setting all other 
   partitions' indicators to 0 at the same time). The presence of the 80h tells 
   the standard boot routine to load the sector whose location is contained in 
   the following three bytes. That sector is the actual boot record for the 
   selected operating system, and it is responsible for the remainder of the 
   system's loading process (as it is from the diskette). All boot records are 
   loaded at absolute address 0:7C00.

The partition table with its offsets into the boot record is:
(except for Wyse DOS 3.2 with 32 bit allocation table, and DOS 3.3-up)

HARD DISK TECHNICAL INFORMATION

 Boot indicator (boot ind): The boot indicator byte must contain 0 for a non- 
bootable partition or 80h for a bootable partition. Only one partition can be 
marked as bootable at a time.

 System Indicator (sys ind): The sys ind field contains an indicator of the 
operating system that "owns" the partition.

          The system indicators are:
                       00h unknown (unspecified or non-DOS)
                       01h DOS 12 bit FAT
                       02h DOS 16 bit FAT

 Cylinder (CYL) and Sector (S): The 1 byte fields labelled CYL contain the low 
order 8 bits of the cylinder number - the high order 2 bits are in the high 
order 2 bits of the sector (S) field. This corresponds with the ROM BIOS 
interrupt 13h (disk I/O) requirements, to allow for a 10 bit cylinder number.

 The fields are ordered in such a manner that only two MOV instructions are 
required to properly set up the DX and CX registers for a ROM BIOS call to 
load the appropriate boot record (hard disk booting is only possible from the 
first hard disk in the system, where a BIOS drive number of 80h corresponds 
to the boot indicator byte).

 All partitions are allocated in cylinder multiples and begin on sector 1,
head 0.

 EXCEPTION: The partition that is allocated at the beginning of the disk starts 
at sector 2, to account for the hard disk's master boot record.

 Relative Sector (rel sect): The number of sectors preceding each partition 
on the disk is kept in the 4 byte field labelled "rel sect". This value is 
obtained by counting the sectors beginning with cylinder 0, sector 1, head 0 
of the disk, and incrementing the sector, head, and then track values up to 
the beginning of the partition. This, if the disk has 17 sectors per track and 
4 heads, and the second partition begins at cylinder 1, sector 1, head 0,and 
the partition's starting relative sector is 68 (decimal) - there were 17 
sectors on each of 4 heads on 1 track allocated ahead of it. The field is stored
with the least significant word first.

 Number of sectors (#sects): The number of sectors allocated to the partition 
is kept in the "# of sects" field. This is a 4 byte field stored least 
significant word first.

 Signature: The last 2 bytes of the boot record (55AAh) are used as a signature
to identify a valid boot record. Both this record and the partition boot record 
are required to contain the signature at offset 1FEh.

 The master disk boot record invokes ROM BASIC if no indicator byte reflects a 
bootable system.

 When a partition's boot record is given control. It is passed its partition 
table entry address in the DS:SI registers.



DETERMINING FIXED DISK ALLOCATION

DOS determines disk allocation using the following formula:

                      SPF = 
                                        BPS * SPC
                                 CF + 
                                           BPC
where:

     TS      total sectors on disk
     RS      the number of sectrs at the beginning of the disk that are reserved
             for the boot record. DOS reserves 1 sector.
     D       The number of directory entries in the root directory.
     BPD     the number of bytes per directory entry. This is always 32.
     BPS     the number of bytes per logical sector. Typically 512, but you can
             specify a different number with VDISK.
     CF      The number of FATS per disk. Usually 2. VDISK is 1.
     SPF     the number of sectors per FAT. Maximum 64.
     SPC     The number of sectors per allocation unit.
     BPC     the number of bytes per FAT entry. BPC is 1.5 for 12 bit FATs.
             2 for 16 bit FATS.


To calculate the minimum partition size that will force a 16-bit FAT:

        CYL = (max clusters * 8)/(HEADS * SPT)

where:
     CYL     number of cylinders on the disk
     max clusters  4092 (maximum number of clusters for a 12 bit FAT)
     HEADS   number of heads on the hard disk
     SPT     sectors per track  (normally 17 on MFM)


note: DOS 2.0 uses a "first fit" algorithm when allocating file space on the 
hard disk. Each time an application requests disk space, it will scan from the 
beginning of the FAT until it finds a contiguous peice of storage large enough 
for the file.
 DOS 3.0 keeps a pointer into the disk space, and begins its search from the 
point it last left off. This pointer is lost when the system is rebooted. 
This is called the "next fit" algorithm. It is faster than the first fit and 
helps minimize fragmentation.
 In either case, if the FCB function calls are used instead of the handle 
function calls, the file will be broken into peices starting with the first 
availible space on the disk.

Better late than never...
A partition table entry for the IBM AT is set up as follows:

        DB      drive   ; 0 or 80H, 80H marks a bootable, active partition
        DB      head1   ; starting heads
        DW      trksec1 ; starting track/sector (CX value for INT 13)
        DB      system  ; see below
        DB      head2   ; ending head
        DW      trksec2 ; ending track/sector
        DD      sector1 ; absolute # of starting sector
        DD      sector2 ; absolute # of last sector

The system byte is different for different O/S entries:

        1      DOS, 12-bit FAT entries
        4      DOS, 16-bit FAT entries
        DB     Concurrent DOS
        F2     2nd partition for Sperry machines with large disks

        And so on.  There are bytes for XENIX, Prologue and lots of other O/S. 
Many manufacturers diddle with these system bytes to implement more than 1 DOS
partition per disk.  The only one I know about who violates the rule that only
one DOS partition (1 or 4) per disk may exist is Tandon.

                       INSTALLABLE DEVICE DRIVERS


DEVICE DRIVER FORMAT

 A device driver is a COM or EXE file that contains all of the code needed to
control an add-in device. It has a special header to identify it as a device,
define the strategy and interrupt entry points, and define its various
attributes.

NOTE: For device drivers the COM file must not use the ORG 100h. Since the
      driver does not use the program segment prefix, it is simply loaded
      without offset. Therefore the memory image file must have an origin of 0 
      (ORG 0 or no ORG statement).


TYPES OF DEVICES

 There are two types of devices: Character devices and Block devices. Their 
attributes are as follows:

 Character devices are designed to do character I/O in a serial manner like 
CON, AUX, and PRN. These devices have names like CON, AUX, CLOCK$, and you can 
open channels (handles or FCBs) to do input and output with them. Because 
character devices have only one name, they can only support one device.

 Block devices are the fixed disk or diskette drives on a system. They can do 
random I/O in peices called blocks, which are usually the physical sector 
size of the disk. These devices are not named as character devices are, and 
cannot be opened directly. Instead they are mapped by using the drive letters 
A,B,C etc. Block devices can have units within them. In this way, a single block
driver can be responsible for one or more disk drives. For example, the first
block device driver can be responsible for drives A,B,C,and D. This means it has
four units defined and therefore takes up four drive letters. The position of
the driver in the chain of all drives determines the way in which the drive
letters correspond. For example, if the device driver is the first block driver
in the device chain, and it defines four units, then these devices are called
A,B,C, and D. If the second device driver defines three units, then those units
are E,F,and G. DOS 1.x allows 16 devices. DOS 2.x allows 63, and DOS 3.x allows
26. It is recommended that drivers limit themselves to 26 devices for
compatibility with DOS 3.x.

 DOS doesn't care about the position of installed character devices versus 
block devices. The installed character devices get put into the chain ahead of
resident character devices so that you can override the system's default driver
for CON etc.

 Although it is sometimes beleived that installed block devices get linked into
the chain BEHIND the resident block devices, if you look at the actual device
chain, this is not true (though it is true in the sense that installed block
devices get assigned drive letters in sequence, starting with the next letter
after the last one assigned to a resident block device).



DEVICE HEADER

 A device driver requires a device header at the beginning of the file. This 
is the format of the device header:

                Field                           Length

        Pointer to next device header field     dword
        Attribute                               word
        Pointer to device strategy routine      word
        Pointer to device interrupt routine     word
        Name/Unit field                         8 bytes


POINTER TO NEXT DEVICE HEADER FIELD

 The device header field is a pointer to the device header of the next device 
driver. It is a doubleword field that is set by DOS at the time the device 
driver is loaded. The first word is an offset and the second word is the 
segment.
 If you are loading only one device driver, set the device header field to -1 
before loading the device. If you are loading more than one device driver, set 
the first word of the device driver header to the offset of the next device 
driver's header. Set the device driver header field of the last device driver 
to -1.


ATTRIBUTE FIELD

 The attribute field is a word field that describes the attributes of the 
device driver to the system. The attributes are:

        word    bits (decimal)
                15      1       character device
                        0       block device
                14      1       supports IOCTL
                        0       doesn't support IOCTL
                13      1       non-IBM format (block only)
                        0       IBM format
                12      not documented - unknown
                11      1       supports removeable media
                        0       doesn't support removeable media
                10      reserved for DOS
             through
                4       reserved for DOS
                3       1       current block device
                        0       not current block device
                2       1       current NUL device
                        0       not current NUL device
                1       1       current standard output device
                        0       not current standard output device



BIT 15  is the device type bit. Use it to tell the system the that driver is a
        block or character device.

BIT 14  is the IOCTL bit. It is used for both character and block devices. Use 
        it to tell DOS whether the device driver can handle control strings
        through the IOCTL function call 44h.
         If a device driver cannot process control strings, it should set bit
        14 to 0. This way DOS can return an error is an attempt is made through
        the IOCTL function call to send or receive control strings to the
        device. If a device can process control strings, it should set bit 14 
        to 1. This way, DOS makes calls to the IOCTL input and output device 
        function to send and receive IOCTL strings.
         The IOCTL functions allow data to be sent to and from the device 
        without actually doing a normal read or write. In this way, the device
        driver can use the data for its own use, (for example, setting a baud
        rate or stop bits, changing form lengths, etc.) It is up to the device
        to interpret the information that is passed to it, but the information
        must not be treated as a normal I/O request.


BIT 13  is the non-IBM format bit. It is used for block devices only. It affects
        the operation of the Get BPB (BIOS parameter block) device call.

BIT 11  is the open/close removeable media bit. Use it to tell DOS if the 
        device driver can handle removeable media. (DOS 3.x only)

BIT 3   is the clock device bit. It is used for character devices only. Use it 
        to tell DOS if your character device driver is the new CLOCK$ device.

BIT 2   is the NUL attribute bit. It is used for character devices only. Use it
        to tell DOS if your character device driver is a NUL device. Although
        there is a NUL device attribute bit, you cannot reassign the NUL device.
        This is an attribute that exists for DOS so that DOS can tell if the NUL
        device is being used.

BIT 0   are the standard input and output bits. They are used for character
  &     devices only. Use these bits to tell DOS if your character device 
BIT 1   driver is the new standard input device or standard output device.


POINTER TO STRATEGY AND INTERRUPT ROUTINES

 These two fields are pointers to the entry points of the strategy and input 
routines. They are word values, so they must be in the same segment as the 
device header.


NAME/UNIT FIELD

 This is an 8-byte field that contains the name of a character device or the 
unit of a block device. For the character names, the name is left-justified and
the space is filled to 8 bytes. For block devices, the number of units can be 
placed in the first byte. This is optional because DOS fills in this location 
with the value returned by the driver's INIT code.


CREATING A DEVICE DRIVER

 To create a device driver that DOS can install, perform the following:

1) Create a memory image file or an EXE file with a device header at the start 
   of the file.
2) Originate the code (including the device header) at 0, not 100h.
3) Set the next device header field. Refer to "Pointer to Next Device Header 
   Attribute Field" for more information.
4) Set the attribute field of the device header. Refer to "Attribute Field" for 
   more information.
5) Set the entry points for the interrupt and strategy routines.
6) Fill in the name/unit field with the name of the character device or the unit
   number of the block device.

 DOS always processes installable character device drivers before handling the 
default devices. So to install a new CON device, simply name the device CON. 
Be sure to set the standard input device and standard output device bits in 
the attribute field of a new CON device. The scan of the device list stops on 
the first match so the installable device driver takes precedence.

NOTE: Because DOS can install the device driver anywhere in memory, care 
      must be taken in any FAR memory references. You should not expect that 
      your driver will be loaded in the same place every time.



INSTALLING DEVICE DRIVERS

 DOS installs new device drivers dynamically at boot time by reading and 
processing the DEVICE command in the config.sys file. For example, if you have 
written a device driver called DRIVER1, to install it put this command in the 
CONFIG.SYS file:
                             DEVICE=DRIVER1

 DOS calls a device driver at its strategy entry point first, passing in a 
request header the information describing what DOS wants the device driver 
to do.
 This strategy routine does not perform the request but rather queues the 
request or saves a pointer to the request header. The second entry point is 
the interrupt routine and is called by DOS immediately after the strategy 
routine returns. The interrupt routine is called with no parameters. Its 
function is to perform the operation based on the queued request and set up 
any return infromation.
 DOS passes the pointer to the request header in ES:BX. This structure consists
of a fixed length header (Request Header) followed by data pertinent to the 
operation to be performed.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the device driver to preserve the machine 
      state. For example, save all registers on entry and restore them on exit.

 The stack used by DOS has enough room on it to save all the registers. If more
stack space is needed, it is the device driver's responsibility to allocate and
maintain another stack.
 All calls to execute device drivers are FAR calls. FAR returns should be 
executed to return to DOS.



INSTALLING CHARACTER DEVICES

 One of the functions defined for each device is INIT. This routine is called 
only once when the device is installed and never again. The INIT routine returns
the following:

A) A location to the first free byte of memory after the device driver, like a
   TSR that is stored in the terminating address field. This way, the 
   initialization code can be used once and then thrown away to save space.
B) After setting the address field, a character device driver can set the status
   word and return.


INSTALLING BLOCK DEVICES

 Block devices are installed in the same way as character devices. The 
difference is that block devices return additional information. Block devices 
must also return:

A) The number of units in the block device. This number determines the logical 
   names the devices will have. For example, if the current logical device 
   letter is F at the time of the install call, and the block device driver INIT
   routine returns three logical units, the letters G, H, and I are assigned to 
   the units. The mapping is determined by the position of the driver in the 
   device list and the number of units in the device. The number of units 
   returned by INIT overrides the value in the name/unit field of the device 
   header.
B) A pointer to a BPB (BIOS parameter block) pointer array. This is a pointer 
   to an array of *n* word pointers there *n* is the number of units defined. 
   These word pointers point to BPBs. This way, if all of the units are the 
   same, the entire array can point to the same BPB to save space.
    The BPB contains information pertinent to the devices such as the sector 
   size, number of sectors per allocation unit, and so forth. The sector size of
   the BPB cannot be greater than the maximum allotted size set at DOS 
   initialization time.
   NOTE: This array must be protected below the free pointer set by the return.
C) The media descriptor byte. This byte is passed to devices so that they know 
   what parameters DOS is currently using for a particular drive unit.

 Block devices can take several approaches. They can be *dumb* or *smart*. A 
dumb device would define a unit (and therefore a BPB) for each possible media 
drive combination. Unit 0=drive 0;single side, unit 1=drive 0;double side, etc.
 For this approach, the media descriptor bytes would mean nothing. A smart 
device would allow multiple media per unit. In this case, the BPB table 
returned at INIT must define space large enough to acommodate the largest 
possible medias supported (sector size in BPB must be as large as maximum 
sector size DOS is currently using). Smart drivers will use the media byte to 
pass information about what media is currently in a unit.


REQUEST HEADER

 The request header passes the information describing what DOS wants the 
device driver to do.


  Length                         F i e l d                                   

   BYTE    Length in bytes of the request header plus any data at end        

   BYTE    Unit code. The subunit the operation is for (minor device)        
           Has no meaning for character devices.                             

   WORD    Command code                                                      

 8 BYTES   Deserved for DOS                                                  

(variable) Data appropriate for the operation                                



UNIT CODE FIELD

 The unit code field identifies which unit in a block device driver the request
is for. For example, if a block device driver has three units defined, then the
possible values of the unit code field would be 0,1,and 2.


COMMAND CODE FIELD

 The command code field in the request header can have the following values:

      CODE         FUNCTION

        0       INIT
        1       MEDIA CHECK      (block only,NOP for character)
        2       BUILD BPB        (block only, NOP for character)
        3       IOCTL input      (called only if IOCTL bit is 1)
        4       INPUT            (read)
        5       NONDESTRUCTIVE INPUT NO WAIT (character devices only)
        6       INPUT STATUS     (character devices only)
        7       INPUT FLUSH      (character devices only)
        8       OUTPUT           (write)
        9       OUTPUT           (write with verify)
        10      OUTPUT STATUS    (character devices only)
        11      OUTPUT FLUSH     (character devices only)
        12      IOCTL OUTPUT     (called only if IOCTL bit is 1)
        13      DEVICE OPEN      (called only if OPEN/CLOSE/RM bit is set)
        14      DEVICE CLOSE     (called only if OPEN/CLOSE/RM bit is set)
        15      REMOVEABLE MEDIA (called only if OPEN/CLOSE/RM bit is set and
                                  device is block)

NOTE: Command codes 13,14,and 15 are for use with DOS versions 3.x.


STATUS FIELD
The status field in the request header contains:


            D E V I C E    D R I V E R    S T A T U S    F I E L D            

   B    0                                                                   
        1                                                                   
   Y    2                                                                   
        3    Error message return code                                      
   T    4    (with bit 15=1)                                                
        5                                                                   
   E    6                                                                   
        7                                                                   

  bit   8    DONE                                                           

  bit   9    BUSY                                                           

  bits  10 - 14    Reserved                                                 

  bit   15    Error                                                         


 The status word field is zero on entry and is set by the driver interrupt 
routine on return.

BIT 15  is the error bit. If this bit is set, the low 8 bits of the status word
        (7-0) indicate the error code.

BITS 14-10 are reserved.

BIT 9   is the busy bit. It is only set by status calls and the removable media 
        call. See "STATUS" and "REMOVABLE MEDIA" in this chapter for more 
        information about the calls.

BIT 8   is the done bit. If it is set, it means the operation is complete. The 
        driver sets the bit to 1 when it exits.

 The low 8 bits of the status word define an error message if bit 15 is set. 
These errors are:

        00h  Write protect violation   01h  Unknown unit
        02h  Device not ready          03h  Unknown command
        04h  CRC error                 05h  Bad drive request structure length
        06h  seek error                07h  unknown media

DEVICE DRIVER FUNCTIONS

 All strategy routines are called with ES:BX pointing to the request header. 
The interrupt routines get the pointers to the request header from the queue 
the strategy routines store them in. The command code in the request header 
tells the driver which function to perform.
NOTE: all DWORD pointers are stored offset first, then segment.

The following function call parameters are described:

        INIT
        MEDIA CHECK
        BUILD BPB (BIOS PARAMETER BLOCK)
        MEDIA DESCRIPTOR BYTE
        INPUT OR OUTPUT
        NONDESTRUCTIVE INPUT NO WAIT
        STATUS
        FLUSH
        OPEN OR CLOSE
        REMOVABLE MEDIA


INIT
Command code=0
        ES:BX   pointer to request header. Format of header:
                length           field
                13 bytes  request header
                 dword    number of units (not set by character devices)
                 dword    Ending address of resident program code
                 dword    Pointer to BPB array (not set by character devices)
                          /pointer to remainder of arguments
                  byte    Drive number (3x only)

The driver must do the following:

        A) set the number of units (block devices only)
        B) set up the pointer to the BPB array (block devices only)
        C) perform any initialization code (to modems, printers, etc)
        D) Set the ending address of the resident program code
        E) set the status word in the request header.

 To obtain information obtained from CONFIG.SYS to a device driver at INIT 
time, the BPB pointer field points to a buffer containing the information 
passed from CONFIG.SYS following the =. The buffer that DOS passes to the 
driver at INIT after the file specification contains an ASCII string for the 
file OPEN. The ASCII string (ending in 0h) is terminated by a carriage return 
(0Dh) and linefeed (0Ah). If there is no parameter information after the file 
specification, the file specification is immediately followed by a linefeed 
(0Ah). This information is read-only and only system calls 01h-0Ch and 30h can 
be issued by the INIT code of the driver.
 The last byte parameter contains the drive letter for the first unit of a 
block driver. For example, 0=A, 1=B etc.
 If an INIT routine determines that it cannot set up the device and wants to 
abort without using any memory, follow this procedure:

        A) set the number of units to 0
        B) set the ending offset address at 0
        C) set the ending offsret segment address to the code segment (CS)

NOTE: If there are multiple device drivers in a single memory image file, the 
      ending address returned by the last INIT called is the one DOS uses. It is
      recommended that all device drivers in a single memory image file return
      the same ending address.


MEDIA CHECK
command code=1
        ES:BX   pointer to request header. Format of header:
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header
                byte      media descriptor from DOS
                byte      return
                dword     returns a pointer to the previous volume ID (if bit
                          11=1 and disk change is returned) (DOS 3.x)

 When the command code field is 1, DOS calls MEDIA CHECK for a drive unit and 
passes its current media descriptor byte. See "Media Descriptor Byte" later in 
this chapter for more information about the byte. MEDIA CHECK returns one of 
the following:

        A) media not changed             C) not sure
        B) media changed                 D) error code

The driver must perform the following:
        A) set the status word in the request header
        B) set the return byte
               -1       media has been changed
                0       don't know if media has been changed
                1       media has not been changed

 DOS 3.x: If the driver has set the removable media bit 11 of the device header
attribute word to 1 and the driver returns -1 (media changed), the driver must 
set the DWORD pointer to the previous volume identification field. If DOS 
determines that the media changed is an error, DOS generates an error 0Fh 
(invalid disk change) on behalf of the device. If the driver does not implement
volume identification support, but has bit 11 set to 1, the driver should set a
pointer to the string "NO NAME",0.


MEDIA DESCRIPTOR
 Currently the media descriptor byte has been defined for a few media types. 
This byte should be idetnical to the media byte if the device has the non-IBM 
format bit off. These predetermined values are:

media descriptor byte =>    1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0
 (numerical order)          7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

       BIT                MEANING        

        0       1=2 sided       0=not 2 sided
        1       1=8 sector      0=not 8 sector
        2       1=removeable    0=nonremoveable
       3-7      must be set to 1


Examples of current DOS media descriptor bytes:

           media      sides   sectors  ID byte

        hard disk       *       *       0F8h
        5-1/4 floppy    2       15      0F9h
        5-1/4 floppy    1       9       0FCh
        5-1/4 floppy    2       9       0FDh
        5-1/4 floppy    2       8       0FFh
        5-1/4 floppy    1       8       0FEh
        8" floppy       1       26      0FEh *
        8" floppy       2       26      0FDh
        8" floppy       2       8       0FEh *

*NOTE: The two Media Descriptor Bytes that are the same for 8" diskettes (0FEh) 
are not a misprint. To determine whether you are using a single sided or double
sided diskette, attempt to read the second side, and if an error occurs you can
assume the diskette is single sided.


BUILD BPB (BIOS Parameter Block)
command code =2
        ES:BX   pointer to request header. Format:
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header
                byte      media descriptor from DOS
                dword     transfer address (buffer address)
                dword     pointer to BPB table

DOS calls BUILD BPB under the following two conditions:

A) If "media changed" is returned
B) If "not sure" is returned, there are no used buffers. Used buffers are 
   buffers with changed data that has not yet been written to the disk.

The driver must do the following:

A) set the pointer to the BPB
B) set the status word in the request header.

 The driver must determine the correct media type currently in the unit to 
return the pointer to the BPB table. The way the buffer is used (pointer 
passed by DOS) is determined by the non-IBM format bit in the attribute field 
of the device header. If bit 13=0 (device is IBM compatible), the buffer 
contains the first sector of the FAT (most importantly the FAT ID byte). The 
driver must not alter this buffer in this case. If bit 13=1 the buffer is a 
one sector scratch area which can be used for anything.
 For drivers that support volume identification and disk change, the call 
should cause a new volume identification to be read off the disk. This call 
indicates that the disk has been legally changed.
 If the device is IBM compatible, it must be true that the first sector of the 
first FAT is located at the same sector for all possible media. This is 
because the FAT sector is read before the media is actually determined.
 The information relating to the BPB for a particular media is kept in the boot
sector for the media. In particular, the format of the boot sector is:


 For DOS 2.x, 3 byte near jump (0E9h) For DOS 3.x, 2 byte near jump (0EBh)    
 followed by a NOP (90h)                                                      

 8 bytes    OEM name and version                                             

   BYTE          sectors per allocation unit (must be a power of 2)         
     
   WORD     B    reserved sectors (strarting at logical sector 0)           
     
   BYTE          number of FATs                                             
     
   WORD     P    max number of root directory entries                       
     
   WORD          number of sectors in logical image (total number of        
                 sectors in media, including boot sector directories, etc.) 
  B  
   BYTE          media descriptor                                           
     
   WORD          number of sectors occupied by a single FAT                 

   WORD     sectors per track                                                

   WORD     number of heads                                                  

   WORD     number of hidden sectors                                         


 The three words at the end return information about the media. The number of
heads is useful for supporting different multihead drives that have the same
storage capacity but a different number of surfaces. The number of hidden
sectors is useful for drive partitioning schemes.


INPUT / OUTPUT
command codes=3,4,8,9,and 12
        ES:BX   pointer to request header. Format:
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header
                byte      media descriptor byte
                dword     transfer address (buffer address)
                word      byte/sector count
                dword     (DOS 3.x) pointer to the volume ID if error code 0Fh
                          is returned

The driver must perform the following:
        A) set the status word in the request header
        B) perform the requested function
        C) set the actual number of sectors or bytes tranferred

NOTE: No error checking is performed on an IOCTL I/O call. However the driver 
      must set the return sector or byte count to the actual number of bytes 
      transferred.


The following applies to block device drivers: 

 Under certain circumstances the device driver may be asked to do a write 
operation of 64k bytes that seems to be a *wrap around* of the transfer address
in the device driver request packet. This arises due to an optimization added to
write code in DOS. It will only happen in writes that are within a sector size
of 64k on files that are being exetended past the current end of file. It is 
allowable for the device driver to ignore the balance of the write that wraps 
around, if it so chooses. For example, a write of 10000h bytes worth of sectors
with a transfer address of XXXX:1 ignores the last two bytes.

Remember: A program that uses DOS function calls can never request an input or 
          output function of more than 0FFFFh bytes, therefore, a wrap around 
          in the transfer (buffer) segment can never occur. It is for this 
          reason you can ignore bytes that would have wrapped around in the 
          tranfer segment.

 If the driver returns an error code of 0Fh (invalid disk change) it must put 
a DWORD pointer to an ASCIIZ string which is the correct volume ID to ask the 
user to reinsert the disk.

DOS 3.x:
 The reference count of open files on the field (maintained by the OPEN and 
CLOSE calls) allows the driver to determine when to return error 0Fh. If there 
are no open files (reference count=0) and the disk has been changed, the I/O 
is all right, and error 0Fh is not returned. If there are open files 
(reference count > 0) and the disk has been changed, an error 0Fh condition 
may exist.


NONDESTRUCTIVE INPUT NO WAIT
command code=5
        ES:BX   pointer to request header. Format:
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header
                byte      read from device

The driver must do the following:
        A) return a byte from the device
        B) set the status word in the request header.

 If the character device returns busy bit=0 (characters in the buffer), then 
the next character that would be read is returned. This character is not removed
form the buffer (hence the term nondestructive input). This call allows DOS to
look ahead one character.


STATUS
command codes=8 and 10
        ES:BX   pointer to a request header. Format:
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header

This driver must perform the following:
        A) perform the requested function
        B) set the busy bit
        C) set the status word in the request header.

The busy bit is set as follows:

 For input on character devices: if the busy bit is 1 on return, a write 
request would wait for completion of a current request. If the busy bit is 0, 
there is no current request. Therefore, a write request would start immediately.

 For input on character devices with a buffer: if the busy bit is 1 on return, 
a read request does to the physical device. If the busy bit is 0, there are 
characters in the device buffer and a read returns quickly. It also indicates 
that a user has typed something. DOS assumes all character devices have a type-
ahead input buffer. Devices that do not have this buffer should always return 
busy=0 so that DOS does not hang waiting for information to be put in a buffer
that does not exist.


FLUSH
command codes=7 and 11
        ES:BX   pointer
                length          field
                13 bytes  request header

 This call tells the driver to flush (terminate) all pending requests that it 
has knowledge of. Its primary use is to flush the input queue on character 
devices.
 The driver must set the status word in the request header upon return.


OPEN or CLOSE (3.x)
command codes=13 and 14
        ES:BX   pointer
                length          field
                13 bytes  static request header

 These calls are designed to give the device information about the current file
activity on the device if bit 11 of the attribute word is set. On block 
devices, these calls can be used to manage local buffering. The device can keep
a reference count. Every OPEN causes the device to increment the reference
count. Every CLOSE causes the device to decrement the reference count. When the
reference count is 0, if means there are no open files in the device. Therefore,
the device should flush buffers inside the device it has written to because now
the user can change the media on a removeable media drive. If the media had been
changed, it is advisable to reset the reference count to 0 without flushing the
buffers. This can be thought of as "last close causes flush". These calls are 
more useful on character devices. The OPEN call can be used to send a device 
initialization string. On a printer, this could cause a string to be sent to set
the font, page size, etc. so that the printer would always be in a known state
in the I/O stream. Similarly, a CLOSE call can be used to send a post string 
(like a form feed) at the end of an I/O stream. Using IOCTL to set these pre and
post strings provides a flexible mechanism of serial I/O device stream control.

NOTE: Since all processes have access to STDIN,STDOUT,STDERR,STDAUX, and STDPRN
      (handles 0,1,2,3,and 4) the CON, AUX, and PRN devices are always open.


REMOVABLE MEDIA (DOS 3.x)
command code=15
        ES:BX   pointer
                length          field
                13 bytes  status request header

 To use this call, set bit 11 of the attribute field to 1. Block devices can 
only use this call through a subfunction of the IOCTL function call (44h). 
This call is useful because it allows a utility to know whether it is dealing 
with a nonremovable media drive or with a removable media drive. For example, 
the FORMAT utility needs to know whether a drive is removable or nonremovable 
because it prints different versions of some prompts.

 The information is returned in the BUSY bit of the status word. If the busy 
bit is 1, the media is nonremovable. 

NOTE: No error checking is performed. It is assumed that this call always 
      succeeds.


THE CLOCK$ DEVICE

 To allow a clock board to be integrated into the system for TIME and DATE,
the CLOCK$ device is used. This device defines and performs functions like any
other character device (most functions will be reset done bit, reset error bit,
and return). When a read or write to this device occurs, 6 bytes are
transferred. The first 2 bytes are a word, which is the count of days since
01-01-80. The third byte is minutes, the fourth is hours, the fifth is
hundredths of a second, and the sixth is seconds. 
Reading the CLOCK$ device gets the date and time, writing to it sets the date 
and time.

THE EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER

History

 The Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Manager was originally a Lotus and
Intel project and was announced as version 3.0 in the second quarter of 1985
primarily as a means of running larger Lotus worksheets by transparently
paging unused sections to bank-switched memory. Shortly afterward Microsoft
announced support of the standard and version 3.2 was subsequently released
with support for Microsoft Windows. LIM 3.2 supported up to 8 megabytes of
paged memory. The LIM 4.0 supports up to 32 megabytes of paged memory.



AST/QUADRAM/ASHTON-TATE ENHANCED EXPANDED MEMORY SPECIFICATION

 The AQA EEMS maintains upward compatibility with the LIM, but is a superset
of functions.

 The AQA EEMS permits its pages to be scattered throughout the unused portion
of the machine's address space.

On August 19, 1987, the new version of the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)
was announced by Lotus, Intel and Microsoft. This new version of the
specification includes many features of the Enhanced Expanded Memory
Specification (EEMS) originally developed by AST Reserach, Quadram and Ashton-
Tate, although the three original sponsoring companies elected not to make the
new specification upward compatible with EEMS. AST Research says that they will
endorse EMS 4.0 without reservation.

 The definitive document for the LIM-EMS is Intel part number 300275-004,
August, 1987.

 The page frame is located above the 640k system RAM area, anywhere from
0A000h to 0FFFFh. This area is used by the video adapters, network cards, and
add-on ROMs (as in hard disk controllers). The page frames are mapped around
areas that are in use.



                 WRITING PROGRAMS THAT USE EXPANDED MEMORY

 In order to use expanded memory, applications must perform these steps in the
following order:

1. Determine if EMM is installed.
2. Determine if enough expanded memory pages exist for your application.
   (Function 3)
3. Allocate expanded memory pages. (Function 4 or 18)
4. Get the page frame base address. (Function 2)
5. Map in expanded memory pages. (Function 5 or 17)
6. Read/write/execute data in expanded memory, just as if it were conventional
   memory.
7. Return expanded memory pages to expanded memory pool before exiting. Function
   6 or 18)


Programming Guidelines

 The following section contains guidelines for programmers writing applications
that use EMM.

A) Do not put a program's stack in expanded memory.

B) Do not replace interrupt 67h. This is the interrupt vector the EMM uses.
   Replacing interrupt 67h could result in disabling the Expanded Memory
   Manager.

C) Do not map into conventional memory address space your application doesn't
   own. Applications that use the EMM to swap into conventional memory space,
   must first allocate this space from the operating system. If the operating
   system is not aware that a region of memory it manages is in use, it will
   think it is available. This could have disastrous results. EMM should not be
   used to "allocate" conventional memory. DOS is the proper manager of
   conventional memory space. EMM should only be used to swap data in
   conventional memory space previously allocated from DOS.

D) Applications that plan on using data aliasing in expanded memory must check
   for the presence of expanded memory hardware. Data aliasing occurs when
   mapping one logical page into two or more mappable segments. This makes one
   16K-byte expanded memory page appear to be in more than one 16K-byte memory
   address space. Data aliasing is legal and sometimes useful for applications.
    Software-only expanded memory emulators cannot perform data aliasing. A
   simple way to distinguish software emulators from actual expanded memory
   hardware is to attempt data aliasing and check the results. For example, map
   one logical page into four physical pages. Write to physical page 0. Read
   physical pages 1-3 to see if the data is there as well. If the data appears
   in all four physical pages, then expanded memory hardware is installed in the
   system, and data aliasing is supported.

E) Applications should always return expanded memory pages to the expanded
   memory manager upon termination. These pages will be made available for other
   applications. If unneeded pages are not returned to the expanded memory
   manager, the system could run out of expanded memory pages or expanded
   memory handles.

F) Terminate and stay resident programs (TSRs) should always save the state of
   the map registers before changing them. Since TSRs may interrupt other
   programs which may be using expanded memory, they must not change the state
   of the page mapping registers without first saving them. Before exiting, TSRs
   must restore the state of the map registers.
    The following sections describe the three ways to save and restore the state
   of the map registers.
   1) Save Page Map and Restore Page Map (Functions 8 and 9). This is the
      simplest of the three methods. The EMM saves the map register contents in
      its own data structures -- the application does not need to provide extra
      storage locations for the mapping context. The last mapping context to be
      saved, under a particular handle, will be restored when a call to Restore
      Page Map is issued with the same handle. This method is limited to one
      mapping context for each handle and saves the context for only LIM
      standard 64K-byte page frames.
   2) Get/Set Page Map (Function 15). This method requires the application to
      allocate space for the storage array. The EMM saves the mapping context in
      an array whose address is passed to the EMM. When restoring the mapping
      context with this method, an application passes the address of an array
      which contains a previously stored mapping context. This method is
      preferable if an application needs to do more than one save before a
      restore. It provides a mechanism for switching between more than one
      mapping context.
   3) Get/Set Partial Page Map (Function 16). This method provides a way for
      saving a partial mapping context. It should be used when the application
      does not need to save the context of all mappable memory. This function
      also requires that the storage array be part of the application's data.

G) All functions using pointers to data structures must have those data
   structures in memory which will not be mapped out. Functions 22 and 23
   (Alter Map & Call and Alter Map & Jump) are the only exceptions.



EMS 4.0 SPECIFICATIONS

Page Frames

 The bank switched memory chunks are referred to as "page frames". These frame
consist of four 16K memory blocks mapped into some of the normally unused
system ROM address area, 0C0000-0EFFFF. Each 16K page is independent of the
other and they can map to discrete or overlapping areas of the 8 megabyte
expanded memory address area. Most cards allow selection of addresses to prevent
conflict with other cards, such as hard disk controllers and other expanded
memory boards.


Calling the Manager

 Applications programs communicate with the EMM device driver directly via user
interrupt 67h. All communication between the application program and the driver
bypasses DOS completely. To call the driver, register AH is loaded with the
number of the EMM service requested; DX is loaded with the file handle; and
interrupt 67h is called. ES:DI is used to pass the address of a buffer or array
if needed.
 On return AH contains 0 if the call was successful or an error code from 80h to
8Fh if unsuccessful.



          TESTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER

 Before an application program can use the Expanded Memory Manager, it must
determine whether the manager is present. The two recommended methods are the
"open handle" technique and the "get interrupt vector" technique.

 The majority of application programs can use either the "open handle" or the
"get interrupt vector" method. However, if your program is a device driver or
if it interrupts DOS during file system operations, you must use only the "get
interrupt vector" method.

 Device drivers execute from within DOS and can't access the DOS file functions;
programs that interrupt DOS during file operations have a similar restriction.
During their interrupt processing procedures, they can't access the DOS file
functions because another program may be using the system. Since the "get
interrupt vector" method doesn't require the DOS file functions, you must use
it for programs of this type.


 The "Open Handle" Method

 Most application programs can use the DOS "Open Handle" method to test for
the presence of the EMM. To use this method, follow these steps in order:

1) Issue an "open handle" command (DOS function 3Dh) in "read only" access mode
   (register AL = 0). This function requires your program to point to an ASCII
   string which contains the path name of the file or device in which you're
   interested (register set DS:DX contains the pointer). In this case the file
   is actually the reserved name of the expanded memory manager.

   you should format the ASCII string as follows:

   ASCII_device_name  DB  'EMMXXXX0', 0

   The ASCII codes for the capital letters EMMXXXX0 are terminated by a byte
   containing a value of zero.

2) If DOS returns no error code, skip Steps 3 and 4 and go to Step 5. If DOS
   returns a "Too many open files" error code, go to Step 3. If DOS returns a
   "File/Path not found" error code, skip Step 3 and go to Step 4.

3) If DOS returns a "Too many open files" (not enough handles) status code, your
   program should invoke the "open file" command before it opens any other
   files. This will guarantee that at least one file handle will be available to
   perform the function without causing this error.
    After the program performs the "open file" command, it should perform the
   test described in Step 6 and close the "file handle" (DOS function 3Eh).
   Don't keep the manager "open" after this status test is performed since
   "manager" functions are not available through DOS. Go to Step 6.

4) If DOS returns a "File/Path not found," the memory manager is not installed.
   If your application requires the memory manager, the user will have to reboot
   the system with a disk containing the memory manager and the appropriate
   CONFIG.SYS file before proceeding.

5) If DOS doesn't return an error status code you can assume that either a
   device with the name EMMXXXX0 is resident in the system, or a file with this
   name is on disk in the current disk drive. Go to Step 6.

6) Issue an "I/O Control for Devices" command (DOS function 44h) with a "get
   device information" command (register AL = 0). DOS function 44h determines
   whether EMMXXXX0 is a device or a file.
    You must use the file handle (register BX) which you obtained in Step 1 to
   access the "EMM" device.
   This function returns the "device information" in a word (register DX).
   Go to Step 7.

7. If DOS returns any error code, you should assume that the memory manager
   device driver is not installed. If your application requires the memory
   manager, the user will have to reboot the system with a disk containing the
   memory manager and the appropriate CONFIG.SYS file before proceeding.

8) If DOS didn't return an error status, test the contents of bit 7 (counting
   from 0) of the "device information" word (register DX) the function
   returned. Go to Step 9.

9) If bit 7 of the "device information" word contains a zero, then EMMXXXX0 is
   a file, and the memory manager device driver is not present. If your
   application requires the memory manager, the user will have to reboot the
   system with a disk containing the memory manager and the appropriate
   CONFIG.SYS file before proceeding.
    If bit 7 contains a one, then EMMXXXX0 is a device. Go to Step 10.

10) Issue an "I/O Control for Devices" command (DOS function 44h) with a "get
    output status" command (register AL = 7). You must use the file handle you
    obtained in Step 1 to access the "EMM" device (register BX). Go to Step 11.

11) If the expanded memory device driver is ready, the memory manager passes
    a status value of 0FFh in register AL. The status value is 00h if the device
    driver is not ready.
     If the memory manager device driver is "not ready" and your application
    requires its presence, the user will have to reboot the system with a disk
    containing the memory manager and the appropriate CONFIG.SYS file before
    proceeding.
     If the memory manager device driver is "ready," go to Step 12.

12) Issue a "Close File Handle" command (DOS function 3Eh) to close the expanded
    memory device driver. You must use the file handle you obtained in Step 1 to
    close the "EMM" device (register BX).



 The "Get Interrupt Vector" technique

 Any type of program can use this method to test for the presence of the EMM.

 Use this method (not the "Open Handle" method) if your program is a device
driver or if it interrupts DOS during file system operations.

 Follow these steps in order:

1) Issue a "get vector" command (DOS function 35h) to obtain the contents of
   interrupt vector array entry number 67h (addresses 0000:019Ch thru
   0000:019Fh).
    The memory manager uses this interrupt vector to perform all manager
   functions. The offset portion of this interrupt service routine address is
   stored in the word located at address 0000:019Ch; the segment portion is
   stored in the word located at address 0000:019Eh.
2) Compare the "device name field" with the contents of the ASCII string which
   starts at the address specified by the segment portion of the contents of
   interrupt vector address 67h and a fixed offset of 000Ah. If DOS loaded the
   memory manager at boot time this name field will have the name of the device
   in it.
    Since the memory manager is implemented as a character device driver, its
   program origin is 0000h. Device drivers are required to have a "device
   header" located at the program origin. Within the "device header" is an 8
   byte "device name field." For a character mode device driver this name field
   is always located at offset 000Ah within the device header. The device name
   field contains the name of the device which DOS uses when it references the
   device.
    If the result of the "string compare" in this technique is positive, the
   memory manager is present.



 Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) Program Cooperation:
 In order for TSR's to cooperate with each other and with other applications,
TSRs must follow this rule: a program may only remap the DOS partition it lives
in. This rule applies at all times, even when no expanded memory is present.

             Maps one of the logical pages of expanded memory assigned to a
             handle onto one of the four physical pages within the EMM's page
             frame.
entry   AH      44h
        AL      physical page to be mapped (0-3)
        BX      the logical page to be mapped (zero through [number of pages
                allocated to the EMM handle - 1]). If the logical page number
                is 0FFFFh, the physical page specified in AL will be unmapped
                (made inaccessible for reading or writing).
        DX      the EMM handle your program received from Function 4 (Allocate
                Pages).
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ah, 8Bh
note 1) downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2; EMS and EEMS 3.2 do not
        support unmap (logical page 0FFFFh) capability. Also, EEMS 3.2
        specified there were precisely four physical pages; EMS 4.0 uses the
        subfunctions of function 58h to return the permitted number of physical
        pages. This incorporates the functionality of function 69h ("function
        42") of EEMS.
     2) uses register AX


Function 45h Release Handle and Memory
LIM Function Call 6
             Deallocates the logical pages of expanded memory currently
             assigned to a handle and then releases the handle itself.
entry   AH      45h
        DX      handle
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 86h
note 1) upward and downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2.
     2) uses register AX
     3) when a handle is deallocated, its name is set to all ASCII nulls
        (binary zeros).
     4) a program must perform this function before it exits to DOS or no other
        programs can use these pages or the EMM handle.


Function 46h Get EMM Version
LIM Function Call 7
             Returns the version number of the Expanded Memory Manager software.
entry   AH      46h
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h
        AL      version number byte (if AL=00h)
                binary coded decimal (BCD) format if version byte:
                high nibble: integer digit of the version number
                low nibble : fractional digit of version number
                i.e., version 4.0 is represented like this:
                          0100 0000
                            /   \
                           4  .  0
note 1) upward and downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2. It appears
        that the intended use for this function is to return the version of the
        vendor implementation of the expanded memory manager instead of the
        specification version.
     2) uses register AX


Function 47h Save Mapping Context
LIM Function Call 8
             Save the contents of the expanded memory page-mapping registers on
             the expanded memory boards, associating those contents with a
             specific EMM handle.
entry   AH      47h
        DX      caller's EMM handle (NOT current EMM handle)
return  AH      error status:  00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ch, 8Dh
note 1) upward and downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2.
     2) This only saves the context saved in EMS 3.2 specification; if a driver,
        interrupt routine or TSR needs to do more, functions 4Eh (Page Map
        functions) or 4Fh (Partial Page Map functions) should be used.
     3) no mention is made about the number of save contexts to provide. AST
        recommends in their Rampage AT manual one save context for each handle
        plus one per possible interrupt (5 + <handles>).
     4) uses register AX
     5) this function saves the state of the map registers for only the 64K page
        frame defined in versions 3.x of the LIM. Since all applications written
        to LIM versions 3.x require saving the map register state of only this
        64K page frame, saving the entire mapping state for a large number of
        mappable pages would be inefficient use of memory. Applications that use
        a mappable memory region outside the LIM 3.x page frame should use
        functions 15 or 16 to save and restore the state of the map registers.


Function 48h Restore Page Map
LIM Function Call 9
             Restores the contents of all expanded memory hardwere page-mapping
             registers to the values associated with the given handle by a
             previous function 08h (Save Mapping Context).
entry   AH      48h
        DX      caller's EMM handle (NOT current EMM handle)
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Eh
note 1) upward and downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2.
     2) This only restores the context saved in EMS 3.2 specification; if a
        driver, interrupt routine or TSR needs to do more, functions 4Eh (Page
        Map functions) or 4Fh (Partial Page Map functions) should be used.
     3) uses register AX
     4) this function saves the state of the map registers for only the 64K page
        frame defined in versions 3.x of the LIM. Since all applications written
        to LIM versions 3.x require saving the map register state of only this
        64K page frame, saving the entire mapping state for a large number of
        mappable pages would be inefficient use of memory. Applications that use
        a mappable memory region outside the LIM 3.x page frame should use
        functions 15 or 16 to save and restore the state of the map registers.


Function 49h Reserved
LIM Function Call 10
             This function was used in EMS 3.0, but was no longer documented in
             EMS 3.2. It formerly returned the page mapping register I/O port
             array. Use of this function is discouraged, and in EMS 4.0 may
             conflict with the use of the new functions 16 through 30 (4Fh
             through 5Dh) and functions 10 and 11. Functions 10 and 11 are
             specific to the hardware on Intel expanded memory boards and may
             not work correctly on all vendors' expanded memory boards.


Function 4Ah Reserved
LIM Function Call 11
             This function was used in EMS 3.0, but was no longer documented in
             EMS 3.2. It was formerly Get Page Translation Array. Use of this
             function is discouraged, and in EMS 4.0 may conflict with the use
             of the new functions (4Fh through 5Dh).


Function 4Bh Get Number of EMM Handles
LIM Function Call 12
             The Get Handle Count function returns the number of open EMM
             handles (including the operating system handle 0) in the system.
entry   AH      4Bh
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h
        BX      handle count (AH=00h) (including the operating system handle
                [0]). max 255.
note 1) upward and downward compatible with EMS and EEMS 3.2.
     2) uses registers AX and BX


Function 4Ch Get Pages Owned by Handle
LIM Function Call 13
             Returns number of logical expanded memory pages allocated to a
             specific EMM handle.
entry   AH      4Ch
        DX      handle
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h
        BX      pages allocated to handle, max 2048 because the EMM allows a
                maximum of 2048 pages (32M bytes) of expanded memory.
note 1) This function is upward compatible with EMS and EEMS 3.2.
     2) programmers should compare the number returned in BX with the maximum
        number of pages returned by function 42h register DX, total number of
        EMM pages. This should be an UNSIGNED comparison, just in case the spec
        writers decide to use 16 bit unsigned numbers (for a maximum space of
        one gigabyte) instead of signed numbers (for a maximum space of 512
        megabytes). Unsigned comparisons will work properly in either case
     3) uses registers AX and BX


Function 4Dh Get Pages for All Handles
LIM Function Call 14
             Returns an array containing all active handles and the number of
             logical expanded memory pages associated with each handle.
entry   AH      4Dh
        ES:DI   pointer to 1020 byte array to receive information on an array of
                structures where a copy of all open EMM handles and the number
                of pages allocated to each will be stored.
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h
        BX      number of active handles (1-255); array filled with 2-word
                entries, consisting of a handle and the number of pages
                allocated to that handle. (including the operating system handle
                [0]). BX cannot be zero because the operating system handle is
                always active and cannot be deallocated.
note 1) NOT COMPATIBLE with EMS or EEMS 3.2, since the new special OS handle
        0000h is returned as part of the array. Unless benign use of this
        information is used (such as displaying the handle and count of pages
        associated with the handle) code should be changed to only work with
        handles between 01h and FFh and to specifically ignore handle 00h.
     2) The array consists of an array of 255 elements. The first word of each
        element is the handle number, the second word contains the number of
        pages allocated.
     3) There are two types of handles, "standard" and "raw". The specification
        does not talk about how this function works when both raw and standard
        handles exist in a given system. There is no currently known way to
        differentiate between a standard handle and a raw handle in EMS 4.0.
     4) uses registers AX and BX


Function 4Eh Get or Set Page Map
LIM Function Call 15
             Gets or sets the contents of the EMS page-mapping registers on the
             expanded memory boards.
              This group of four subfunctions is provided for context switching
             required by operating environments and systems. These functions are
             upward and downward compatible with both EMS and EEMS 3.2; in
             addition, these functions now include the functionality of EEMS
             function 6Ah ("function 43") involving all pages.
              The size and contents of the map register array will vary from
             system to system based on hardware vendor, software vendor, number
             of boards and the capacity of each board in the system. Note the
             array size can be determined by function 4Eh/03h.
              Use these functions (except for 03h) instead of Functions 8 and 9
             if you need to save or restore the mapping context but don't want
             (or have) to use a handle.

        00h  Get Page Map
             This call saves the mapping context for all mappable memory regions
             (conventional and expanded) by copying the contents of the mapping
             registers from each expanded memory board to a destination array.
             The application must pass a pointer to the destination array.
entry   AH      4Eh
        AL      00h
        ES:DI   pointer to target array
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
note 1) uses register AX
     2) does not use an EMM handle


         01h  Set Page Map
             This call the mapping context for all mappable memory regions
             (conventional and expanded) by copying the contents of a source
             array into the mapping registers on each expanded memory board in
             the system. The application must pass a pointer to the source array.
entry   AH      4Eh
        AL      01h
        DS:SI   pointer to source array
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A3h
note 1) uses register AX
     2) does not use an EMM handle


        02h  Get & Set Page Map
             This call simultaneously saves the current mapping context and
             restores a previous mapping context for all mappable memory regions
             (both conventional and expanded). It first copies the contents of
             the mapping registers from each expanded memory board in the system
             into a destination array. Then the subfunction copies the contents
             of a source array into the mapping registers on each of the
             expanded memory boards.
entry   AH      4Eh
        AL      02h
        DS:SI   pointer to source array
        ES:DI   pointer to target array
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A3h
note 1) uses register AX


          03h  Get Size of Page Map Save Array
entry   AH      4Eh
        AL      03h
return  AH      error status:  00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        AL      size in bytes of array
note 1) this subfunction does not require an EMM handle
     2) uses register AX



FUNCTIONS NEW TO EMS 4.0

Function 4Eh Get or Set Page Map
LIM Function Call 16
entry   AH      4Eh
        AL      00h     if getting mapping registers
                01h     if setting mapping registers
                02h     if getting and setting mapping registers at once
                03h     if getting size of page-mapping array
        DS:SI   pointer to array holding information (AL=01/02)
        ES:DI   pointer to array to receive information (AL=00/02)
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A3h
note 1) this function was designed to be used by multitasking operating systems
        and should not ordinarily be used by appplication software.


Function 4Fh Get/Set Partial Page Map
LIM Function Call 16
             These four subfunctions are provided for context switching required
             by interrupt routines, operating environments and systems. This set
             of functions provides extended functionality over the EEMS function
             6Ah (function 43) involving subsets of pages. In EEMS, a subset of
             pages could be specified by starting position and number of pages;
             in this function a list of pages is specified, which need not be
             contiguous.
              Interrupt routines can use this function in place of functions 47h
             and 48h, especially if the interrupt routine wants to use more than
             the standard four physical pages.
        AH      4Fh
        AL      subfunction
                00h     get partial page map
                        DS:SI   pointer to structure containing list of
                                segments whose mapping contexts are to be saved
                        ES:DI   pointer to array to receive page map
                01h     set partial page map
                        DS:SI   pointer to structure containing saved partial
                                page map
                02h     get size of partial page map
                        BX      number of mappable segments in the partial map
                                to be saved
return  AH      error status (00h): 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Bh, 8Fh, 0A3h
                error status (01h): 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A3h
                error status (02h): 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Bh, 8Fh
        AL      size of partial page map for subfunction 02h
        DS:SI   (call 00h) pointer to array containing the partial mapping
                context and any additional information necessary to restore this
                context to its original state when the program invokes a Set
                subfunction.
note    uses register AX


Function 50h Map/Unmap Multiple Pages
LIM Function Call 17
entry   AH      50h
        AL      00h     (by physical page)
                01h     (by segment number)
        CX      contains the number of entries in the array. For example, if the
                array contained four pages to map or unmap, then CX would
                contain 4.
        DX      handle
        DS:SI   pointer to an array of structures that contains the information
                necessary to map the desired pages.
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ah, 8Bh, 8Fh
note 1) New function permits multiple logical-to-physical assignments to be made
        in a single call.(faster than mapping individual pages)
     2) The source map array is an array of word pairs. The first word of a
        pair contains the logical page to map (0FFFFh if the physical page is
        to be totally unmapped) and the second word of a pair contains the
        physical page number (subfunction 00h) or the segment selector
        (subfunction 01h) of the physical page in which the logical page shall
        be mapped.
     3) A map of available physical pages (by physical page number and segment
        selectors) can be obtained using function 58h/00h, Get Mappable
        Physical Address Array.
     4) uses register AX
     5) Both mapping and unmapping pages can be done simultaneously.
     6) If a request to map or unmap zero pages is made, nothing is done and no
        error is returned.
     7) Pages can be mapped or unmapped using one of two methods. Both methods
        produce identical results.
         A) A logical page and a physical page at which the logical page is to
            be mapped. This method is an extension of Function 5 (Map Handle
            Page).
         B) Specifys both a logical page and a corresponding segment address at
            which the logical page is to be mapped. While functionally the same
            as the first method, it may be easier to use the actual segment
            address of a physical page than to use a number which only
            represents its location. The memory manager verifies whether the
            specified segment address falls on the boundary of a mappable
            physical page. The manager then translates the segment address
            passed to it into the necessary internal representation to map the
            pages.


Function 51h Reallocate pages
LIM Function Call 18
             This function allows an application to change the number of logical
             pages allocated to an EMM handle.
entry   AH      51h
        BX      number of pages desired at return
        DX      handle
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 87h, 88h
        BX      number of pages now associated with handle
note 1) uses registers AX, BX
     2) Logical pages which were originally allocated with Function 4 are called
        pages and are 16K bytes long. Logical pages which were allocated with
        Function 27 are called raw pages and might not be the same size as pages
        allocated with Function 4.
     3) If the status returned in BX is not zero, the value in BX is equal to
        the number of pages allocated to the handle prior to calling this
        function. This information can be used to verify that the request
        generated the expected results.


Function 52h Get/Set Handle Attributes
LIM Function Call 19

note 1) uses register AX
     2) A volatile handle attribute instructs the memory manager to deallocate
        both the handle and the pages allocated to it after a warm boot. If all
        handles have the volatile attribute (default) at warm boot the handle
        directory will be empty and all expanded memory will be initialized to
        zero immediately after a warm boot.
     3) If the handle's attribute has been set to non-volatile, the handle, its
        name (if it is assigned one), and the contents of the pages allocated to
        the handle are all maintained after a warm boot.
     4) Most PCs disable RAM refresh signals for a considerable period during a
        warm boot. This can corrupt some of the data in memory boards. Non-
        volatile handles should not be used unless it is definitely known that
        the EMS board will retain proper function through a warm boot.
     5) subfunction 02h can be used to determine whether the memory manager can
        support the non-volatile attribute.
     6) Currently the only attribute supported is non-volatile handles and
        pages, indicated by the least significant bit.


Function 53h Handle Name Functions
LIM Function Call 20
             EMS handles may be named. Each name may be any eight characters.
             At installation, all handles have their name initialized to ASCII
             nulls (binary zeros). There is no restriction on the characters
             which may be used in the handle name (ASCII chars 00h through
             0FFh). A name of eight nulls (zeroes) is special, and indicates a
             handle has no name. Nulls have no special significance, and they
             can appear in the middle of a name. The handle name is 64 bits of
             binary information to the EMM.
              Functions 53h and 54h provide a way of setting and reading the
             names associated with a particular handle. Function 53h manipulates
             names by number.
              When a handle is assigned a name, at least one character in the
             name must be a non-null character in order to distinguish it from
             a handle without a name.

        00h  Get Handle Name
             This subfunction gets the eight character name currently
             assigned to a handle.
              The handle name is initialized to ASCII nulls (binary zeros)
             three times:  when the memory manager is installed, when a handle
             is allocated, and when a handle is deallocated.
entry   AH      53h
        AL      00h
        DX      handle
        ES:DI   pointer to 8-byte handle name array into which the name
                currently assigned to the handle will be copied.
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Fh
note    uses register AX

        01h  Set Handle Name
             This subfunction assigns an eight character name to a handle.
             A handle can be renamed at any time by setting the handle's
             name to a new value. When a handle is deallocated, its name is
             removed (set to ASCII nulls).
entry   AH      53h
        AL      01h
        DX      handle
        DS:SI   pointer to 8-byte handle name array that is to be assigned to
                the handle. The handle name must be padded with nulls if the
                name is less than eight characters long.
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A1h

Function 54h Handle Directory Functions
LIM Function Call 21
             Function 54h manipulates handles by name.

        00h  Get Handle Directory
             Returns an array which contains all active handles and the names
             associated with each.

return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        AL      number of active handles
note 1) The name array consists of 10 byte entries; each entry has a word
        containing the handle number, followed by the eight byte (64 bit) name.
     2) uses register AX
     3) The number of bytes required by the target array is:
                10 bytes * total number of handles
     4) The maximum size of this array is:
                (10 bytes/entry) * 255 entries = 2550 bytes.

        01h  Search for Named Handle
             Searches the handle name directory for a handle with a particular
             name. If the named handle is found, this subfunction returns the
             handle number associated with the name.
entry   AH      54h
        AL      01h
        DS:SI   pointer to an 8-byte string that contains the name of the
                handle being searched for

        DX      handle number
note 1) uses registers AX and DX

        02h  Get Total Handles
             Returns the total number of handles the EMM supports, including
             the operating system handle (handle value 0).
entry   AH      54h
        AL      02h
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        BX      total number of handles availible
note 1) This is NOT the current number of handles defined, but the maximum
        number of handles that can be supported in the current environment.
     2) uses registers AX and BX


Function 55h Alter Page Map and Jump (cross page branch)
LIM Function Call 22
             Alters the memory mapping context and transfers control to the
             specified address. Analogous to the FAR JUMP in the 8086 family
             architecture. The memory mapping context which existed before
             calling function is lost.
entry   AH      55h
        AL      00h     physical page numbers provided by caller
                01h     segment addresses provided by caller
        DX      handle
        DS:SI   pointer to structure containing map and jump address
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ah, 8Bh, 8Fh
note 1) Flags and all registers except AX are preserved across the jump.
     2) uses register AX
     3) Values in registers which don't contain required parameters maintain the
        values across the jump. The values in registers (with the exception of
        AX) and the flag state at the beginning of the function are still in the
        registers and flags when the target address is reached.
     4) Mapping no pages and jumping is not considered an error. If a request to
        map zero pages and jump is made, control is transferred to the target
        address, and this function performs a far jump.


Function 56h Alter Page Map and Call (cross page call)
LIM Function Call 23
        00h and 01h
               This subfunction saves the current memory mapping context,
               alters the specified memory mapping context, and transfers
               control to the specified address.
entry   AH      56h
        AL      00h physical page numbers provided by caller
                01h segment addresses provided by caller

return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ah, 8Bh, 8Fh
note 1) Flags and all registers except AX are preserved to the called routine.
        On return, flags and all registers except AX are preserved; AL is set to
        zero and AX is undefined.
     2) uses register AX
     3) Values in registers which don't contain required parameters maintain
        the values across the call. The values in registers (with the exception
        of AX) and the flag state at the beginning of the function are still in
        the registers and flags when the target address is reached.
     4) Developers using this subfunction must make allowances for the
        additional stack space this subfunction will use.

        02h  Get Page Map Stack Space Size
             Since the Alter Page Map & Call function pushes additional
             information onto the stack, this subfunction returns the number of
             bytes of stack space the function requires.
entry   AH      56h
        AL      02h
return: BX      number of bytes of stack used per call
        AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
note 1) if successful, the target address is called. Use a RETF to return and
        restore mapping context

note 1) uses register AX

        01h  Exchange Memory Region
             Exchanges data between two memory areas. Includes exchanges between
             paged and non-paged areas, or between two different paged areas.
entry   AH      57h
        AL      01h
        DS:SI   pointer to the data structure which contains the source and
                destination information for the exchange.
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 83h, 84h, 8Ah, 8Fh, 93h, 94h, 95h,
                96h, 97h, 98h, 0A2h
note 1) The request block is a structure with the following format:
        dword   region length in bytes
        byte    0=source in conventional memory
                1=source in expanded memory
        word    source handle
        word    source offset in page or selector
        word    source logical page (expanded) or selector (conventional)
        byte    0=target in conventional memory
                1=target in expanded memory
        word    target handle
        word    target offset in page or selector
        word    target logical page (expanded) or selector (conventional)
     2) Expanded memory allocated to a handle is considered to be a linear
        array, starting from logical page 0 and progressing through logical page
        1, 2, ... n, n+1, ... up to the last logical page in the handle.
     3) uses register AX


Function 58h Mappable Physical Address Array
LIM Function Call 25
             These functions let you obtain a complete map of the way physical
             memory is laid out in a vendor independent manner. This is a
             functional equivalent of EEMS function 68h ("function 41"). EEMS
             function 60h ("function 33") is a subset call of 68h.

        00h  Get Array
             Returns an array containing the segment address and physical page
             number for each mappable physical page in a system. This array
             provides a cross reference between physical page numbers and the
             actual segment addresses for each mappable page in the system.
entry   AH      58h
        AL      00h
        ES:DI   pointer to target array
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        CX      entries in target array
note 1) The information returned is in an array composed of word pairs. The
        first word is the physical page's segment selector, the second word the
        physical page number. Note that values are not necessarily returned in a
        particular order, either ascending/decending segment selector values or
        as ascending/decending physical page number.
     2) For compatibility with earlier EMS specifications, physical page zero
        contains the segment selector value returned by function 41h, and
        physical pages 1, 2 and 3 return segment selector values that corrospond
        to the physical 16 KB blocks immediately following physical page zero.
     3) uses registers AX and CX
     4) The array is sorted in ascending segment order. This does not mean that
        the physical page numbers associated with the segment addresses are
        also in ascending order.

        01h   Get Physical Page Address Array Entries.
              Returns a word which represents the number of entries in the
              array returned by the previous subfunction. This number also
              indicates the number of mappable physical pages in a system.
entry   AH      58h
        AL      01h
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        CX      number of entries returned by 58h/00h
note 1) multiply CX by 4 for the byte count.
     2) uses registers AX and CX


Function 59h Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information
LIM Function Call 26
             These functions return information specific to a given hardware
             implementation and to use of raw pages as opposed to standard
             pages. The intent is that only operating system code ever need use
             these functions.
        00h  Get EMS Hardware Info
             Returns an array containing expanded memory hardware configuration
             information for use by an operating system.
entry   AH      59h
        AL      00h
        ES:DI   pointer to 10 byte target array
                The target array has the following format:
                word: raw page size in paragraphs (multiples of 16 bytes)
                word: number of alternate register sets
                word: size of page maps (function 4Eh [15])
                word: number of alternate registers sets for DMA
                word: DMA operation -- see full specification
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A4h
note 1) uses register AX
     2) This function is for use by operating systems only.
     3) This function can be disabled at any time by the operating system.

        01h  Get Unallocated Raw Page Count
             Returns the number of unallocated non-standard length mappable
             pages as well as the total number of non-standard length mappable
             pages of expanded memory
entry   AH      59h
        AL      01h
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh
        BX      unallocated raw pages availible for use
        DX      total raw 16k pages of expanded memory
note 1) uses registers AX, BX, CX
     2) An expanded memory page which is a sub-multiple of 16K is termed a raw
        page. An operating system may deal with mappable physical page sizes
        which are sub-multiples of 16K bytes.
     3) If the expanded memory board supplies pages in exact multiples of 16K
        bytes, the number of pages this function returns is identical to the
        number Function 3 (Get Unallocated Page Count) returns. In this case,
        there is no difference between a page and a raw page.


Function 5Ah Allocate Raw Pages
LIM Function Call 27
             Allocates the number of nonstandard size pages that the operating
             system requests and assigns a unique EMM handle to these pages.
entry   AH      5Ah
        AL      00h     allocate standard pages
                01h     allocate raw pages

return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 85h, 87h, 88h
        DX      unique raw EMM handle (1-255)
note 1) it is intended this call be used only by operating systems
     2) uses registers AX and DX
     3) For all functions using the raw handle returned in DX, the length of
        the physical and logical pages allocated to it are some nonstandard
        length (that is, not 16K bytes).
     4) this call is primarily for use by operating systems or EMM drivers
        supporting hardware with a nonstandard EMS page size.

entry   AH      5Ch
return  AH      error status: 00h, 80h, 81h, 84h
note 1) uses register AX
     2) this function assumes that the next operation that the operating system
        performs is a warm boot of the system.
     3) in general, this function will affect the current mapping context, the
        alternate register set in use, and any other expanded memory hardware
        dependencies which need to be initialized at boot time.
     4) if an application decides to map memory below 640K, the application must
        trap all possible conditions leading to a warm boot and invoke this
        function before performing the warm boot itself.


Function 5Dh Enable/Disable OS Function Set Functions
LIM Function Call 30
             Lets the OS allow other programs or device drivers to use the OS
             specific functions. This capability is provided only for an OS
             which manages regions of mappable conventional memory and cannot
             permit programs to use any of the functions which affect that
             memory, but must be able to use these functions itself.
entry   AH      5Dh
        AL      00h     enable OS function set
                01h     disable OS function set

                        key at next invocation)
        BX,CX   access key returned by first invocation
return  BX,CX   access key, returned only on first invocation of function
        AH      status  00h, 80h, 81h, 84h, 8Fh, 0A4h
note 1) this function is for use by operating systems only. The operating system
        can disable this function at any time.
     2) 00h uses registers AX, BX, CX
        01h uses registers AX, BX, CX
        02h uses register AX
     3) 00h, 01h: The OS/E (Operating System/Environment) functions these
        subfunctions affect are:
        Function 26. Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information.
        Function 28. Alternate Map Register Sets.
        Function 30. Enable/Disable Operating System Functions.

 These scan codes are generated by pressing a key on the PC's keyboard. This 
is the 'make' code. A 'break' code is generated when the key is released. The 
break scancode is 128 higher than the make code, and is generated by setting 
bit 7 of the scan code byte to 1.
