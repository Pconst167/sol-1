                               PRINTING AND VIEWING
                               --------------------

   The document is formatted for printing, at 55 lines per page, with no
   special characters EXCEPT diacriticals (e.g. non-English characters, such
   as U Umlaut, C Cedille and so on).  When printed, it it very large indeed,
   pages, so we recommend that you view it online, using a file-viewer such as
   Pinnacle Software's freeware SEE program, or Vern Buerg's LIST program.
   
   To download a freeware copy of the SEE program, dial Pinnacle Software's
   free files BBS at 514-345-8654 (any speed above 1200 bps) and sign on as
   GUEST. When you see the menu, type  PRO  to select a download protocol
   (ZMODEM is the default), then type  GET N SEE  to start downloading the
   SEE.ZIP archive.

   In order to make it possible for us to offer this service free of charge,
   we have automated the processing of application forms.  This means we do
   not proof-read the listings in detail, so some of them may contain typo-
   graphical or other errors.  We do not check the information, though we do
   endeavour to remove entries that are proven to be erroneous.

            Snarf (action/arcade, many levels, EGA/VGA)
            Hero's Heart (non-shareware is Hero GOLD)
Notes about the Author or Company:
I specialize in games that challenge the mind more than your reflexes (except 
for Snarf).  All are done in exceptional graphics, lots of options, learn 
quickly but play forever.

                         HOW TO SHARE THE APPLICATION FORM
                         ---------------------------------

   The best way to share the application form with others is to pass around
   the original "Who's Who in Shareware" package as an archive -- give it the
   name WWIS.ZIP if possible.  However, if you don't have enough time (or disk
   space) for that, you may post our application form on a BBS as a message,
   or send it to somebody via electronic mail.  We have carefully edited the
   form so that all necessary information is contained in less than 100 lines.
   (In the original package, the form is also contained in the file WWIS.FRM)

   A copy of the application form is presented below. When you send somebody a
   copy of the form via email, you should leave at least one leading space; on
   most systems this will prevent the form from being formatted.

================================================================================

        ---------------------- FINAL LINE OF FORM ----------------------|

        GUIDE TO DATA ENTRY:  DO NOT ALTER THE FORMAT OF THE FORM.  When
        submitting  your form,  you need to send  only the lines between
        (and including) the  FIRST LINE and FINAL LINE  separator lines.

        (1)  Place an "X" in the appropriate boxes. If this is the FIRST
             TIME you have  submitted a listing,  mark  New Listing.  If
             you are CHANGING a listing,  check off Update if it is MORE
             than a year old,  or Early Update if it is LESS than a year
             old  ($5 fee for Early Update).   If the mailing address is
             already cited in  another listing, also place an "X" beside
             Extra (there is a $5 fee for each extra listing).
        (3)  Enter the name of your company, if any.
        (4)  Enter  your name  here or  (for a company)  the name of the
             primary contact at your company.
        (7)  Enter up to four phone numbers, with descriptions, such as:
             Voice line, Fax, BBS (9600 bps), Order line, etc.
        (8)  Enter your online addresses.   Use  "Other"  to specify the
             name and ID for other services, such as Internet, Fido etc.
        (9)  Describe your top five  services or products.  If a product
             is for computers other than PC compatibles, please say so.
        (10) Write up to  four  lines  about the person or company being
             described.  You can mention such things as: number of years
             in shareware, important lessons learned, and so on.
        (11) If you have provided any  special service  to  promote  the
             shareware industry,  describe  your  contribution.  You can
             list your affiliations (e.g. ASP, STAR).   Also, list which
             shareware conferences you participate in more than once per
             week (e.g. CompuServe ASP or UKSHARE, GEnie HOSB, etc.).

        NOTE: If a payment is required, you can use your Visa or Master-
        Card by dialing 800-995-1605 or 619-685-7291. (These numbers are
        for payment only.  For other matters, call Tim at 514-345-9578.)

        Please pass this form around so that others may benefit from it.


================================================================================

   In order to ensure that this project benefits the shareware industry as
   much as possible, we would like to ask you to upload the directory (or
   just the application form) to your favourite BBS.

   Thanks for your help!



                         -----------------------------
                         TIPS FOR FILLING OUT THE FORM
                         -----------------------------


   The form itself provides the basic information you need to get a listing.
   However, here are some tips that will help your listing look its best...

   GENERAL:  Used mixed case in your entry.  An entry all in uppercase does
             not look attractive.  You can leave in the underscores but please
             make sure that NO line goes past the | vertical bar character.
             and that everything is precisely where it was in the original
             form.  It is possible for us to offer this service for FREE
             because we process the forms with a program.  So we may have to
             reject a form that doesn't follow the format exactly.  Please
             double-check your spelling; our program can not do that.

   (4) NAME  Give just your name -- no titles.  Also, if you have a multiple-
             part last name (e.g. Frans van der Waal), you can make things
             easier for us by placing a slash character before the last name
             (for example:  Frans/van der Waal).  Only ONE name per form.  If
             you wish to list more than one person, you must obtain an "Extra"
             listing (see the explanation of part (1) of the form.)

   (8) TOP5  When listing programs, there is no need to cite version numbers.

   WHEN SENDING US THE FORM VIA COMPUSERVE, PLEASE DO NOT USE AN ATTACHED
   UPLOAD; that method costs both of us money.  A better way is to paste the
   completed form into the email line editor (using a paced ASCII upload).
   An even easier way is to use a CompuServe reader program, such as CIM,
   OzCIS or TAPCIS.
