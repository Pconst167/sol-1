Demos - only for Europe? / Celebrandil of PHA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello everyone... I'm really glad to see that this newsgroup has
become so popular.  In the very beginning there were not so many
people here at all. 

It seems to me that we have a little war going on between the two
different continents. The problem is that most demos are made for
only one configuration and don't work on all the rest. Most (all?)
demos are made in Europe and are therefore only working here. You
(at least the americans) are always asking why it has to be that
way. 

I think that the reason is because of the growing competition 
between all democoders here in Europe. They (we) always want to be
ahead of the rest and since the number of members of _The_Scene_
in the US are so few, we don't care at all. You make a demo for
several different reasons, 

1) to become as wellknown as possible among the others (not among
   the 'serious' A3000 users (I'm one of them)), 
2) to reach the top of all existing charts (especially the most 
   important one, the Eurochart),
3) to win as many competitions as possible,
4) to convince yourself that you have gain a bit of experience.   

Now I suppose that you (the americans) have become quite mad with
me. Please be patient and go on reading. The reasons why we don't
care about you over there are also important.

1) You will never be popular in Europe if you try to use 320*200
   screens, instead of the ordinary 320*256 ones, just to suit all
   the americans.
2) To make your demo as good as possible you use about 99 percent 
   of the CPU time in order to drain the computer completly. Since
   the screens are updated 60 times every second on the american
   computers (not 50 times) there won't time enough in the US.
3) There are NO important american demo charts at all and the 
   competitions are very few. 

The reasons why most demos only work on A500s are almost the same.
As a new owner of an A3000 I also think that this is a pity. The 
number of A3000 owners will probably grow and sooner or later we
(the democoders) will be forced to change our habits in order to
make the demos work on all configurations. 

How do we solve this then? I think that there are different ways
for the americans to convince us. Why don't you start your own 
American Demo Chart? Only the demos working in the US will be 
there. Don't you understand how important the charts are for the
european democoders? You can also try to arrange your own parties
and code your own demos. 

Remember one thing: _The_Scene_ isn't only consisting of a couple
of hundred freaks spread all over Europe. The number of voters for
the Eurochart are about 1 thousand and every year about 1 thousand
demos are released in Europe. One hundred of these are quite good
and about ten are really good. If you consider these figures it's 
easy for you to understand that we are quite many, 20'000 or maybe   
ever more. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that I am.

Have a nive day....

It seems to me that most of the people here are americans.  Am I right? I
don't know how easy it is to organize an American Chart at all. The major
problem is  how to find all  these voters,  they have to be  at least one 
hundred. How many bigger groups do exist in the US? 

One way of doing it is to let others (europeans) vote as well. Only demos
working both in NTSC  and PAL will be allowed.  Which charts are supposed 
to be there? I've a few suggestions:

1) Best demo (both oneparts and multiparts)
2) Best musicdisk 
3) Best coder 
4) Best musician
5) Best artist
6) Best group 
7) Best American group (to help you grow up)

and maybe

8) Best European group
9) Best Australian group.

Note: no trader charts
      no game charts
  	
Most of the work must be done in the states, but I think we also need a
european (and australian?) part of it.  It doesn't have to be at all as
professional as the EuroChart. We will grow after a while.

I (Celebrandil) am  willing to create a  european staff if someone else
try to start the same in the US.  The program (not too much job) has to
be coded in the US and then we will spread it all over Europe. 

Remember one thing:      The reason why people don't care to make demos
  working on all configurations  isn't because they don't now how to do
  it.  It's just because they want the demos to be as fast as possible.
  It will never  stop us from being hired as  professionals for serious
  stuff.  That's bullshit!  You (some stupid americans) don't know what
  you are talking about.  You have never been in the situation when you
  want to win a competition  and the only way of doing that is speeding
  the demo up a bit and not letting the demo work in the US at the same
  time. 

Have a nice day...
