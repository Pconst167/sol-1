  Disclaimer: The description below is a mere extrapolation from the  files  I
have encountered. Note that there is another Library format under  CP/M  which
is completely different and is not discussed here.

  The Library archive format has a structure  that  is  similar  to  the  Lynx
format. The archives start with a 'DWB' signature (probably  the  monogram  of
the author), a number showing the number of files  inside  the  archive.  Then
comes the directory, followed by the files themselves. Library archives are in
no way compressed, the files are simply linked after each other in it.  Unlike
in Lynx and Arkive archives, no file is aligned to a sector boundary.
  All entries, strings and other parts of the directory are separated  with  a
carriage return. All numbers are stored in a string form which starts and ends
with a space.

  An example for an archive start would be like this:

  DWB 13 <CR>

  which means this is a valid Library archive and there are 13 files in it.

  Entries in the directory are made up by the file name, the file type and the
length of the file in bytes, e.g.

  HASHMON<CR>P<CR> 4098 <CR>

  means that the current file is called "hashmon", it is a program and  it  is
4098 bytes long.
