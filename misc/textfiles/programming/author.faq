Subject: Listing by programs

1. *****
 Q: Why don't you add a line for the program category?
 Q2: Why don't you allow several lines or several items to list all
the author's programs?
 Q3: Why isn't this list arranged by products?

 A: I appreciate this frequent query and suggestion, but it is based
on a misunderstanding of my goal for this authors' list. This list
is not meant to be a product catalogue for finding programs. This is
meant to be a list of the email addresses of the authors on the
list. For finding programs use files such as garbo.uwasa.fi:
/pc/INDEX.ZIP, /pc/INDEXTS.ZIP and /pc/pd2/bestp*.zip.

Subject: How to submit

2. *****
 Q: How do I submit my own entry to this list?

 A: The information is given in SUBMIT.TXT in this same package.
Please read it carefully before submitting.

Subject: Drawbacks of being on the list

3. *****
 Q: Are there any drawbacks of being on the authors' address list?

 A: Frankly, yes. There are the same dangers as being on any public
address list. Besides the desirable contacts you might get unwanted
solicitations from vendors etc. That has been known to happen.
   Another natural drawback is that you should remember to send in
an updated entry if your information changes. Again this is as with
any address list. Having and old and / or invalid address on a
public list can be a disadvantage to the author's image.

Subject: Are all submissions accepted

4. *****
 Q: Are all submissions accepted to the list?

 A: No, even assuming that the submitted entry is valid and
complete. There are several restrictions:

 - Only authors who produce PD and shareware material are covered:
   - Solely Windows authors are not covered. But there is a separate
     Windows authors' list as announced in AUTHOR.LST.
   - Authors with only fully commercial material are not covered.

 - Authors of recreational MS-DOS games are not covered.

 - Authors of religious material, support a cause material, or
   otherwise controversial material are not covered.

 - On the other hand, authors of MS-DOS related and other FAQ
   (Frequently Asked Questions) material are welcome.

Subject: Submitting for someone else

5. *****
 Q: May I submit an entry on behalf of my friend?

 A: No, I am afraid I must decline such submissions. This is in
effect a database of persons' or companies' addresses. I must have
the information directly from the author to prevent any
misunderstanding about him/her wanting to be on this list. Besides I
wish to assure that the email address really is valid and usable.
   But if you wish to inform your friend of the existence of this
list, I would very much appreciate that. You might even suggest to
me authors who should be on this list, so I can send them the
invitation to the MS-DOS authors' list. But then you'll have to
include his/her email address in your suggestion to me.
