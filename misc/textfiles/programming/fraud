RE: Yes Prodigy does e-mail...

    With regard to the postings going around about Prodigy's services and them
using their software for checking "you out"... etc..

    As I had seen some info on this, I decided to check it out.  Upon
examining my "STAGE.DAT" file, I found that it had in it text from some of my
programs on my system, most notably from games.  Prodigy has said that this
can happen due to the "STAGE.DAT" file using "deleted file" space.  Well, the
games that were in this file were ones that were currently in use in my
system, and had no files from them deleted.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT PRODIGY
COULD COME BY THIS HONESTLY!!!
    Due to this fact, I have cancelled my service and am considering taking
further action.  What you do with this information is your business, but I
figure prospective users should be aware of such things when using or looking
to subscribe to the service.

I would think that the information which Prodigy can retrieve about your
system may have been designed so that they could gain marketing information
about you, so that they can adjust their advertising to suit.  If this is
true, and not a fault from programming, I find this to be criminally
intrusive.  I would hope that the FCC is aware of this, if not, perhaps fellow
bbsers would care to create a letter writing campaign.

so basically speaking Prodigy knows what's on your system, I say we all
carefully examine this and take a few steps furthur.  I swear, maybe we could
get a big law suit going. Hmmmmmmm

It was recently posted that someone had looked at their STAGE.DAT file in       
their PRODIGY directory. They were amazed at the info that had been pulled      
into this file by Prodigy. I immediately checked my own STAGE.DAT and, sure     
enough, there were .DOCS from my MS-WORD directory, files from my QMODEM        
directory and several other files that you, normally, would not find in a       
directory of Online Computer Services. I have moved my Prodigy program to disk  
on the outside chance that I may use it again. I'm really p.o.'d about it and   
haven't, yet, decided what I will do. Maybe discuss the matter with several of  
my law professors.

RE: prodigy checking personal files???                                          
                                                                                
...i ripped out my backup copy of prodigy.. sure enough.. STAGE.DAT was there.. 
                                                                                
guess what was in it:                                                           
                                                                                
         part of my telemate dialing directory                                  
         some PERSONAL letters I had on my system                               
         bits and pieces of almost ever .ASM file on my system                  
            (seems they are looking to pirate code eh??)                        
         and some EXE files (at least headers) I couldn't                       
            Identify..  MZ every couple of K.. geesh                            
                                                                                
I am now going to contact my lawyer to see if what they are doing is legal (I   
know it isn't) and to find out what >I< can do about it... probably not much..  
                                                                                
anyways.. if your on prodigy.. GET OFF!!! don't call em again, don't use their  
software.. BACK IT UP, and REMOVE IT FROM YOUR HARD DRIVE.                      
                                                                                
make sure you DO make a backup though.. just in case something ELSE like this   
comes up... you can se what else prodigy knows about you..
