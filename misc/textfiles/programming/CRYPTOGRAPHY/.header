<H1>Programming Textfiles: Cryptography</H1>
<P>
A goal of all communicators, as far back as time records, is to ensure that 
those communications reach the right people and don't fall into the hands
of others. To this end, codes and passwords and ciphers have been created
to make it so anyone intercepting a communication is unable to know what the
message is.
<P>
This goal has come into the computer era in the form of encrypted e-mail
and secure networking, and the politics that have arisen as a result are
what have brought a strong awareness of government policy and social 
change to computing. This directory contains both technical and political
discussions.
