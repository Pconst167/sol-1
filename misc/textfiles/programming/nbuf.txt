                USE A BUFFERING FIFO QUEUE TO OUTPUT YOUR GFX

  This little text was originally placed in the Imphobia MAG 12.  I've added
  some little things and I want it to be available for every programmers and
  not only sceners.  I hope you'll like it and I encourage you to D/L the
  Imphobia MAGs (great MAG, Darky !!!) available on ftp.cdrom.com /pub/demos
  and ftp.arosnet.se to read other amazing programming tricks and more...

  Maybe this article has no interest for you, but i think  it's  important  to
be clear about how to display frames on your screen in a clean manner. 

  There are many demos done by respectable groups, full of nice 3D algorithms,
nice distos, ...  which suffer of a bad display of the frames (ugly horizontal
cuts in the frames). The problem is similar with many games (except DOOM which
is perfect in this domain ;-) ).

  In the good old time of Mode-X, there weren't such problems because everyone
was using  the multiple pages offered by this scheme of adressing, in order to
get a perfect double (or triple) buffered display. I know  that  many  of  you
will argue that ModeX is slow, that now we have PCI/VLB adapters wich run damn
fast in Mode 13h, and so why to support Mode-X again ... 

  The reply is simple: i don't say that we must support Mode-X... no ! We have
a better tool now, called UNIVBE 5.1, which offer  many  extended  modes  with
multiple pages (unlike Mode 13h).

Others will argue: pffff... i don't want to get my 3D engine idle loosing time
to synchronise with the VGA display and to support double-buffering.

  The reply is : It is possible to get your engine 100% efficient and to get a
perfect  synchronised  display,  without  "ugly cuts" ,...  Even without using
UniVBE, if you still want to use your favourite Mode 13h and you have at least
a VLB/PCI adapter, there is a way to get  a  single-buffered  display  without
cuts (no, Wizard, it's not with a HBL handler ;-)), and without idle graphics.


                                 =============
                                 1: THE BASICS
                                 =============

  I  just  put  here  some  lines grabbed from my Open GL user guide, and some
personnal comments:

  In a movie, motion's achieved by taking a sequence of pictures (24 per sec),
and then projecting them at 24/s on the screen.  In Computer Graphics, screens
typically refresh (redraw the picture) approximately 60 to 76/s, and some even
run at about 120 refreshes/sec.  The usual video modes used in demos and games
have 70,60, and eventually 50 Hz refresh.

  The 'key' idea that makes motion picture projection work  is that when it is
displayed, EACH FRAME IS COMPLETED. This is NOT the case if you fill the video
page during its display  (single-buffering),  because  you  alter  the  screen
while the video processor decodes it !!!. So the video processor decodes a mix
of your old and your new frame, and you get those ugly cuts.  You can say that
a  "rep movsd"  or  "rep stosd" is faster than the decoding of video memory on
your PCI/VLB adapter in Mode 13h, and it is impossible to "see" the update  of
the screen.  Right,  if you work with a small video mode (like 64 Kb video mem
update) and if you are SYNCHRONISED with the screen DURING the modification.

  Now,  suppose  that  you  want  to  display  your million-frame movie with a
program like this (we suppose the screen refreshes at 70Hz, ie. Mode 13h):

init_gfxmode();
for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
{
    clear_screen();
    draw_frame(i);
    SYNC / wait_until_a_70th_of_a_second_is_over();
    i = i + number of frames to skip to get a constant speed on every machine;
}

  If  you  add the time taken by your system to clear the screen and to draw a
typical frame, this program gives more and more disturbing  results  depending
on  how  close  to 1/70 second it takes to clear and draw. Suppose the drawing
takes nearly a full 1/70 second. Items drawn first are visible  for  the  full
1/70  second  and  present a solid image on the screen; items drawn toward the
end are instantly cleared as the programs starts on the next  frame,  so  they
present at best a ghostlike image,  since for most of the 1/70 second your eye
is viewing the cleared background  instead  of  the  items  that  were  enough
unlucky  to  be  drawn  last. The problem is that this program doesn't display
completely drawn frames; instead, you watch the drawing as it happens.

********************* 0    solid scanlines
********************* .
********************* .
--------------------- .    ghost scanlines !!!
--------------------- 199

There are many solutions to this problem:

A) WORK IN A BUFFER IN CENTRAL MEMORY, AND THEN COPY THIS BUFFER TO THE SCREEN 
   (REP MOVSD)

The code becomes:

init_gfxmode();
for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
{
    copy my buff to video;
    clear my buff
    draw_frame(i) in my buff;
    SYNC / wait_until_a_70th_of_a_second_is_over();
    i = i + number of frames to skip to get a constant speed on every machine;
}

  This is better ...  But if you work in a Hi-res GFX mode (ex. 640x400x16M =>
768k or 1M),  may  be  the  copy  will take more than 1/70, and you will see a
piece of the previous frame at the bottom of the screen  (instead of the ghost
frame described before).  This is not esthetic. Moreover you will need to work
in central mem and then copy to video mem, this is far to be optimal  when  we
think  that  the recent Video cards have a flat linear display in which we can 
work directly.

********************* 0    portion of frame i
********************* .
********************* .    frontier 
--------------------- .    portion of frame i-1
--------------------- 199

  The frontier is +- constant thanks to the SYNC  (assuming the calculation of
a frame take a constant time... this can be true for plasmas, but not for 3D).

  But concretely, this is worse because the SYNC line is often removed because
it takes time we could use for the calculation of effects.

  In this case the code becomes:

init_gfxmode();
for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
{
    copy my buff to video;
    clear my buff
    draw_frame(i) in my buff;
    i = i + number of frames to skip to get a constant speed on every machine;
}        

  This means that there is no more synchronisation with  the  retrace  of  the
screen.  In this case the frontier between the old (at the bottom) and the new
frame will move on the screen, and this is REALLY ugly and visible.

i   ******************   i+1 *******************   i+2 ******************
    ******************       *******************       ******************
    ******************   i   -------------------       ******************
i-1 ------------------       -------------------       ******************
    ------------------       -------------------   i+1 ------------------

      AND EVEN : (!)
i+2 ------------------       If you look carefully many 3D phong, mapped,  
    ------------------       bumped demos, you will often see such things. 
i+3 ******************       (Look them on a 486 DX2-66, Fast Pentiums can 
    ******************       false the results on demos designed for 486). 
    ******************


  So, this is NOT the right thing to do if you want a quality animation.

B) USE DOUBLE BUFFERING
    ...


                             ===================
                             2: DOUBLE BUFFERING
                             ===================

  Double buffering is a radical way to remove the problems  described  before.
The  idea  is to have 2 video pages, one is displayed while the other is being
drawn.  When the drawing of a frame is complete,  the two buffers are swapped.
So the one that was being viewed is now used for drawing, and vice versa. It's
like  a  movie  projector  with  only two frames in a loop; while one is being
projected on the screen, an artist is desperately erasing  and  redrawing  the
frame that is not visible.  As long as the artist is quick enough,  the viewer
notices  no difference between this setup and one where all frames are already
drawn  and  the  projector is simply displaying them one after the other. With
double-bufering,  every frame is shown only when the drawing is complete ; the
viewer never sees a partially drawn frame.

  This is a sample of code:

  init_gfxmode();
  j = 0; k = 1;
  SYNC
  SetVisualPage(j)
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)  {
    clear page(k)
    draw_frame(i) in page(k);
    SYNC / wait_until_a_70th_of_a_second_is_over();
    k <=> j
    SetVisualPage(j) // must wait the vertical retrace to set new values to
                     // the video registers
    i = i + number of frames to skip to get a constant speed on every machine;
  }        

The benefits are:

- You  can  work  directly in video mem and use the possibility of FLAT linear
  adressing. 
- It is impossible to have interferences between the new and the old frames.
- Because  you  are  working  directly  in  video memory, you can even use the
  BitBLT accelerator of  your  card  to  "clear page(k)"  or  to  set  a  nice
  background,  or to draw lines,  sprites, ... (There are very few cards which
  have a BitBLT able to work in central memory,  even  if  you  just  want  to
  specify  a  source  in central mem... so in the single buffering scheme, the
  copy buff to screen must be done by hand :-( ).  With the new UniVBE 5.2 and
  the  VBE/AI,  BitBLT  will  be a reality !!! Think about that !!! I'll speak
  about BitBLT in a next article, both customs routines and VBE/AI support...

The prob:

- You MUST be synchronised with the screen !!! So your graphics engine is idle
  until the vertical retrace is done, and that is time lost for calculation.

  With the SYNC line, you wait until the current screen refresh period is over
so that the previous buffer is completely displayed. Assuming that your system
refreshes  the  display 70 times per second, this means that the fastest frame
rate you can achieve is 70 frames per second, and if all your  frames  can  be
cleared  and  drawn  in under 1/70 second, your animation will run smoothly at
that rate.

  What  often happens on such a system is that the frame is too complicated to
draw in 1/70 second, so each frame  is  displayed  more  than  once.  If,  for
example,  it  takes 1/45 second to draw a frame, you get 35 frames per second,
and the graphics are idle for 1/35-1/45=1/157 second per frame.  Altough 1/157
second  of  wasted  time might not sound bad, it's wasted each 1/35 second, so
actually more than 1/5 of the time is wasted.

  That  means  that  if  you're  writing  an  application and gradually adding
features, at first  each  feature  you  add  has  no  effect  on  the  overall
performance  -  you still get 70 frames per second. Then, all of a sudden, you
add one new feature, and your performance is cut in half  because  the  system
can't  quite draw the whole thing in 1/70 of a second. A similar thing happens
when the drawing time per frame is more than  1/35 second  -  the  performance
drops to 35 to 23 frames per  second, and so on (70/1, 70/2, 70/3, 70/4, 70/5,
...).


                      ====================================
                      3: N-BUFFERING / THE BUFFERING QUEUE
                      ====================================

  How to get cuts-free animation without idle graphics ?

  The idea is to think in a different manner the couple CPU/Video.  We can see
this  as  the  classical  problem of producer/consummer: here the CPU produces
frames and the Video consummes them in parallel.

  The CPU produces the frames as fast as it cans, and the Video  consumes  the
frames  at  its own independant rate (ex. 70 frames/s). The frames produced by
the CPU are placed in a FIFO Queue which feeds the Video.


              FIFO Queue (N entries max)
          ---------------------------------
 CPU ->                        *  *  *  *    -> Video  
          ---------------------------------


  If the FIFO queue is full (the N entries are filled), then the CPU enters in
a  idle  loop  until  there  is  some  place  free to put the new frame it has
calculated.

  If the FIFO queue is empty, the Video will keep the old frame displayed, and
look in the FIFO at the next refresh. 


For N=2, we have the double-buffering described before.
    N=3, we have triple-buffering which is often satisfactory, because it
         breaks yet the rigid synchronism we had with double-buffering,
         without using many buffers (3). ID Software have used triple-
         buffering in their game DOOM, which work in Mode-X (which gives
         3 pages 320x240x256 or 4 pages 320x200x256).
    N=4, ...
    .
    .
  The more the buffers,  the  more the CPU can anticipates frames and avoid to
enter in a idle loop.

  Concretely,  we  can  bufferize the start-adresses of the video pages we are
working on. In this case, we have a code like that:


init_gfxmode();
install_interrupt_handler();

// CPU (Producer)                             // Interrupt handler (Consummer)
                                                 (Handler called at each
j = 1;                                            Vertical retrace)
InQ(0);

for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) 
{                                                if (EmptyQ() == false) 
    clear page(j); // use BitBLT                 {   
    draw_frame(i) in page(j);                     new_start = OutQ(); 
    while (FullQ() == true) {}; // idle loop      SetVisualPage(new_start);
    InQ(j);                                      }
    j = (j + 1) MOD N;                           iret 
    i = i + number of frames to
            skip to get a constant 
            speed on every machine;

}        

Yep, that's quite cool, uh ??? 

Note: to do an interrupt handler synchronized with a refresh of 70Hz, you just
      have to reprogram the PC timer to a clock a bit faster like 75 Hz,  wait
      for the VR bit in 3DAh (resynchronisation) and restart the timer...(this
      is  called  a  semi-active wait). There are many VR-Handler available on
      FTP sites or BBSes (look for example at the Starport  BBS  intro  source
      code, ... ). 

  Well, this code work fine if you have a multipage display ...  This is not a
problem for SVGA modes: if we  consider  a  1M  board,  which  is  the  actual
standard,  we  have  8  pages  in  320x200x65K,  16 pages 320x200x256, 4 pages
640x400x256, 3 pages 640x480x256, ... (at least if you use UniVBE).

  But 320x200x256 16 pages doesn't work on all cards, and so the good old Mode
13h  has  still  a reason to exist. No problem, remember what i told before in
"The basics",  don't use (physical) synchronised single-buffering with  an Hi-
Resolution mode...  Ok, but Mode 13h is a small mode which can be updated very
fast on PCI/VLB cards (64k to fill).  The idea is to use a Logical N-buffering
combined with a synchronised Physical single buffering.

  In a synchronised Physical single buffering, we work in buffers  in  central
memory,  and  then  copy  them  into  the  video memory. So, we can imagine to
bufferize the addresses of those buffers (we place the addresses in the FIFO),
and then to have an interrupt handler (synchronised with the VR) which get the
address of the new buffer to display (= to copy) and invoke a copy routine for
this buffer.

  Warning !!!  This  invoquation can not be a simple call, because if the copy
routine takes too much time, this can result in a total misfunctionning of the
interrupt handler (Remember that such periodic interrupt handler is a critical
code which has some real time constraints and which cannot miss an event !!!).
In  order  to  avoid  problems,  the  copy  rout  must be interruptible by the
handler.  This  is obtained if we invoke the copy rout using a context-switch:
we pop the stack layers  until  we  reach  the  return  address  of  the  code
interrupted  by  the  handler, and we insert the address of the copy-rout, and
then we re-push the layers, and when we'll do an "iret"  at  the  end  of  the
handler,  we'll  jump to the copy-rout (which is interruptible by the handler,
because it's seen as a normal user application),  at the end of the copy rout,
we do an iret to restore the code interrupted previously by the handler.
  

  STACK

| Var 1 |               | Var 1 |
| Var 2 |  insert Adr 2 | Var 2 |
| Adr 1 |      --->     | Adr 2 | 
| ..... |               | Adr 1 |

  You don't have to forget that just before the return address,  there is also
the status flag, and you have to consider it when you push/pop  if  you  don't
want  to  obtain  awesome crashes. Just refer you to your 8x86/80x86 manual to
see how the instructions iret, iretd, ret, ... work. In particular,  when  you
push the address  (which is in the form segment:offset/selector:offset) of the
Copy_rout, you must push a dummy flag,  because  it  will  be  invoked  by  an
iret/iretd (you just have to do a pushf/pushfd).


The code becomes:

init_gfxmode(13h);
install_interrupt_handler();

// CPU (Producer)                             // Interrupt handler (Consummer)
                                                 (Handler called at each
j = 1;                                            Vertical retrace)
InQ(0);

for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) 
{                                                 if (EmptyQ() == false) 
    clear buffer(j); // use CPU                   {   
    draw_frame(i) in buffer(j);                    Adr_Buffer = OutQ(); 
    while (FullQ() == true) {}; // idle loop       Pop all local variables;
    InQ(j);                                        pushfd;
    j = (j + 1) MOD N;                             Push Adr of Copy_Rout; 
    i = i + number of frames to                    RePush all local variables;
            skip to get a constant                } 
            speed on every machine;               iretd; // this handler MUST             
                                                         // be short !!!!
}                                                
                                                  Adr_Buffer: Integer;
                                                  Copy_Rout:  
                                                  (assume ds/es -> 0)
                                                  mov esi, Adr_Buffer
                                                  mov ecx,16000
                                                  mov edi,0a0000h
                                                  rep movsd
                                                  iretd


  This is the idea... With this scheme of work, we get 100% efficient code and
100% synchronisation with the  display.  Moreover,  there are many interesting
properties  of  the buffering queue, but i let you imagine that ;-). Good luck
with your implementation.
