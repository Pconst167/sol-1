        *  (Also called <entry>) means that there are more than one  word
        for a certain concept.  Do not bother looking at <entry>, it will
        just refer you back to the original entry

        * See also [entry] at the end of a definition refers you to  more
        information or an entry that may help you understand the original
        entry  better.  Also, opposites of words will often refer to  one
        another.

        *  See <entry> appearing directly after the term  indicates  that
        the definition is the same as <entry>, and you should look there.

        * BBS is used generically to denote any service that you can call
        up  with your computer, whether it is a bulletin board or  a  pay
        service.

        *  Note that many words have more than one definition- some  that
        pertain  to telecommunications and some that don't.   Definitions
        that do not relate to telecommunications will not be listed.

        8N1 - the most common modem set-up.  [see also format]

        0004-0000-00345-4  -  the stock number for "How to  Identify  and
        Resolve Radio-TV Interference Problems," as listed in almost  all
        manuals  for hardware.  If you want a copy, write to: US  Govern-
        ment Printing Office, Washington, DC  20402.

        103  - officially, `Bell 103' which is the  standard  controlling
        transmission  at  300 baud.  It was created by AT&T.   [see  also
        212A]

        202 - the mode used by the Applecat modem and CATFUR.

        212A - officially, `Bell 212A' which is the standard  controlling
        transmission  at 1200 baud.  It was created by AT&T.   [see  also
        103]

        300  baud (bps) - a transmission speed that is  quickly  becoming
        outdated  (though  most modems will allow  communication  at  the
        speed) that is roughly equal to 30 characters per second.

        1200  baud  (bps) - In the mid 1980's this was  the  most  common
        transmission  speed, until 2400 baud became popular/cheaper.   It
        is roughly equal to 120 characters per second.

        2400  baud  (bps) - A fairly high-speed transmission  speed  that
        towards the end of the 1980's has been gaining popularity.  It is
        roughly equal to 240 characters per second.

        9600  baud (bps) - At this time, the fastest  transmission  speed
        available for commercial modems.


        ---A---


        abort - [1] The command word used with editors that allows you to
        exit,  destroying your message.  [2] The character used  to  stop
        characters from a block of text appearing on your screen.  Usual-
        ly the spacebar or CTRL-X are used to abort a message.

        access  - [1] (verb) When someone is using a BBS with their  com-
        puter.   "My boss was accessing a BBS bulletin board when he  was
        interrupted by the doorbell."  [2] (noun) Refers to an intangible
        amount  (usually represented by a security level or  flags)  that
        indicate to what extent you are allowed to use a BBS.  When  used
        in  a  term such as `you will be granted access',  it  means  the
        amount of access that new users will generally receive.

        account - A term that refers to information that a BBS has  about
        you.   It  is usually referred to by an ID number or  your  name.
        The information it contains can include any information that  you
        have at some point given the BBS, usually including your name and
        phone number.  [see also ID number]

        account number - See ID number.

        ACK  A  character (CTRL-F) that acknowledges  something,  usually
        that a certain amount of data has been received correctly.   [see
        also NAK]

        alias - A name that users can use on a bulletin board that is not
        their own.  Aliases are usually used by young BBS users and those
        who  pirate software or do other illegal activities.  Some  exam-
        ples  of  aliases are `Cracker Kid',  `Starbuck',  and  `Midnight
        Killer'.  (Also called handle)

        ampersand - A character (&) that usually means `and'.

        analog  -  As  far as electronic signals  are  concerned,  analog
        refers  to signals that can represent an infinite range  of  num-
        bers,  as  opposed to digital which can only  be  distinct  whole
        numbers.  Analog data often comes from measurements.  The sound a
        modem  makes over the phone is analog since it can be any  number
        of different frequencies.  [see also digital]

        anonymous - Refers to an author of a message that is unknown.  On
        some  BBS's  you are allowed to post anonymous messages  so  that
        others  won't know who you are.  The SysOp usually can  find  out
        who the author is, however.

        answer  mode - The condition in which a modem is ready to  answer
        the  phone  when  it rings and prepare to  connect  with  another
        modem.  All BBS's are in answer mode.  [see also originate mode]

        apostrophe - The character '.  It is usually used in contractions
        of words, such as "don't".

        append - To add to.  Some BBS's allow you to add text from anoth-
        er message to the message you are posting.

        ASCII  -  An acronym for American Standard  Code  of  Information
        Interchange.   It  uses  7 bits to represent  all  uppercase  and
        lowercase characters, as well as numbers and many characters  and
        punctuation marks.  ASCII often uses 8 bits in the form of  bytes
        and ignores the first bit.  [see also EBCDIC]

        asterisk - The character *.

        asynchronous  communication - This is when the beginning and  end
        of each byte that is sent over the phone lines is marked somehow.
        This  way, if there is line noise, the modem can find  out  right
        away where the next byte should start.

        at sign - The character @.  Often read as 'at'.

        AT&T  -  American Telegraph and Telephone, the inventors  of  the
        first modem.

        attended mode -

        audio  monitor - A speaker that is part of the modem  and  allows
        you  to listen to whatever sound is on the phone line.   This  is
        often used to hear busy signals or make sure that the other modem
        picks up the carrier.

        auto-answer - When a modem has the ability to automatically  pick
        up  the  phone when the phone rings and attempt to  connect  with
        another computer.

        auto-dial - When a modem is capable of dialing a phone number, so
        that you don't have to dial manually.

        auto-kill - A feature on some BBS's that will delete a message on
        a board if a certain threshold limit is reached.  For example,  a
        BBS  might  delete  the second message on a board  if  there  are
        already 100 messages and someone posts another message.

        auto-page -

        auto-redial - A feature that allows a modem or a term program  to
        dial  a number again after it finds out that the number is  busy.
        This is very handy when trying to get through to popular bulletin
        boards that are often busy.

        auto-reply - To send a message (either public or private) immedi-
        ately after reading a message on a BBS.  Usually, this is used to
        respond to the author of the message.

        auto-save - The ability of a terminal program to save information
        that it receives from BBS on disk that it was originally  storing
        in memory.  This way, if there is more information than will  fit
        in the buffer, it will not be lost.

        auto-syncing driver -


        ---B---


        backdoor  - A way of getting into a BBS and getting full  access,
        without  using a regular account.  Usually the author of the  BBS
        program built the backdoor into the program so that he could  get
        access to any BBS running his software.

        backslash - The character \.

        backspace - The character (CTRL-H) that causes the cursor on your
        screen  to move back one space.  [see also destructive  backspace
        and non-destructive backspace]

        baud -  A term referring to the speed at which computers communi-
        cate.   Officially, it is the number of changes in an  electronic
        signal  per second.  Since the number of changes usually  is  the
        same  as the number of bits sent or received per second, bps  and
        baud are often used interchangeably.  However, there is a  slight
        difference,  so if you are writing a technical manual  make  sure
        you understand the difference.

        BBS - An acronym for Bulletin Board System.  Usually it is a home
        computer that has a modem attached and is waiting for calls  from
        your  computer.  It can, however, also refer to commercial  serv-
        ices (such as CompuServe and the Source) and any other  computers
        that you can call via telephone lines. BBS's almost always  allow
        you to leave messages for other users.  Many BBS's have  programs
        that you can download and use on your computer.  BBS can also  be
        expanded simply to `bulletin board'.

        bisync  - Refers to a modem that synchronizes with an  electronic
        signal  over  the  telephone lines that marks  the  beginning  of
        words.  Don't worry if you don't understand this term.

        bit - A Binary digIT.  It is a number in base 2, which means that
        it  can only be a 0 or a 1.  It is used in the  expression  `bits
        per second'.  [see also byte, word]

        block  - A group of characters.  For example, when downloading  a
        program, blocks of 128 characters are often sent.

        board  - [1] See BBS.  [2] A group of messages on a BBS that  are
        related.   For  example,  a BBS might have a  board  for  general
        messages and another board for messages dealing with computers.

        bps - Bits Per Second.  The transmission speed of most modems  is
        measured  in  baud or bps.  Bps is literally the number  of  bits
        sent by the modem every second.  [see also baud]

        braces - The characters { and }.

        break character -

        browse  - To go through the list of titles of bulletins and  note
        which ones you want to read.

        buffer  -  [1] (verb) To save all incoming data in  memory.   [2]
        (verb)  to temporarily save data until the computer has a  chance
        to  use  it (using interrupts).  [3] (noun) The place  in  memory
        where the saved information is stored, as in "I have a 32K  buff-
        er."

        bulk  mailing - Used on a BBS when you send the same  message  to
        more than one person.  This saves you from rewriting the message.

        bulletin - A special message posted on a BBS, usually written  by
        the SysOp.  In most cases all users are expected to read any  new
        bulletins that may have been posted since their last call.

        bulletin board - [1] see BBS [2] see board (definition #2)

        bulletin board system - see BBS

        busy - When a bulletin board is being used by a user, or when the
        telephone line is being used.

        busy  signal - The sound that you hear on a phone when the  phone
        number  you are trying to reach is being used.  It  usually  con-
        sists of 60 cycles per second.  [see audio monitor]

        byte - A group of 8 bits.  [see ASCII]


        ---C---


        call back unit - A device that, after you connect with a BBS  and
        tell  it who you are, will then call your phone number.  This  is
        used  to  make  a  very secure system  to  prevent  hackers  from
        invading  a  system.   It then becomes  very  difficult,  if  not
        impossible, for a hacker to get into the computer system.

        caller - Anyone who connects with a BBS.  It is usually used in a
        phrase such as "You are caller #4328."

        caller  log  - A list of callers who have called a BBS  within  a
        given  time period.  The list may also keep information  such  as
        the baud rate of the caller.  This is used so that the SysOp  can
        keep track of users, as well as the occasional hacker.

        call  waiting  -  A service that the phone  company  offers  most
        customers that allows the customer to hear a special sound on the
        phone if there is an incoming call while the customer is  talking
        with someone else.  The customer can then talk with either  call-
        er.   This  is a nice service unless you have a  modem  and  call
        BBS's.   If you are connected with a BBS and someone  else  calls
        you, you will be disconnected.  In most areas there is a  special
        2  or 3 digit number that you can dial before a phone  call  that
        will temporarily disconnect call waiting.

        capture buffer - The area in a computer's memory where a terminal
        program  stores incoming data that is to be saved.  (Also  called
        capture memory).  [see also buffer]

        capture memory - see capture buffer

        card (peripheral) -

        caret - The character ^.

        carriage return - see return

        carrier  -  The tone that the modem sends over  the  phone  lines
        before  any data is sent on it.  It has a fixed frequency  and  a
        fixed amplitude.

        carrier  detect  - The wire in an RS-232C cable  that  holds  the
        information  as  to whether the modem senses  a  carrier.   (Also
        called CD)

        CB simulator - A computer service where there are multiple  phone
        lines  (usually  at least 5).  The CB simulator  allows  all  the
        users to send messages to one another while they are on-line.  It
        usually  allows both public messages that everyone who is on  can
        see and private messages that only one user can see.

        CD - see carrier detect

        center - Some editors on BBS's allow you to center a line of text
        so that it appears in the middle of the screen.

        character - Any letter, numeral, or symbol.

        characteristic -

        chat  -  A mode that allows two or more people (almost  always  a
        SysOp  and a user on a BBS) to communicate with each other  using
        the modem.  Usually, each person can see what the other is typing
        at  all  times  and can interrupt them (a beeping  sound  with  a
        CTRL-G is useful to interrupt with).

        checksum - A number that represents a larger group of numbers  in
        order  to check for errors in date transmission.  It is  commonly
        used when downloading a program.  The checksum is the result of a
        mathematical equation, such as adding all the numbers in a  group
        together.

        Christensen protocol - see Xmodem

        columns  - The width of your screen as measured by the number  of
        characters  your screen can fit across it.  BBS's often  ask  for
        your screen width.  Most current computers have a screen width of
        80 columns.

        command buffer - the place in your modem's memory where it stores
        the commands that you give it.  [see also buffer]

        command  set - A list of all the possible commands that  you  can
        give something, such as a modem, a BASIC program, or a BBS.

        commands  - Instructions that you can give to a modem, a BBS,  or
        another similar device.

        communication - The idea of transferring one's thoughts or  ideas
        to another person.

        communications program - A program similar to a terminal  program
        but  somewhat better.  Often used interchangeably  with  terminal
        program.

        compatible  -  When one object can work as another.   Though  the
        term  is usually used with computers, it is often used  with  mo-
        dems.  Many lesser known modems are compatible with more  popular
        modems.

        configure - To set something to your liking.  To configure a BBS,
        you may have to tell it your screen width, whether you need  line
        feeds and other such information.

        configuration - All of the information that you used to configure
        something.    Configuration  is  often  used  to  describe   what
        equipment  you have for your computer (your  computer  configura-
        tion).

        connect - [1] To be at a point where you can start  communicating
        with a BBS, as in "I have connected with the BBS."  [2] Any point
        after you have established contact with a BBS, as in "I am  still
        connected  with  the  BBS" or "I have  been  connected  with  the
        bulletin board for just over an hour."

        connect speed -

        connection  -  The actual contact with a BBS.  It  is  used  most
        often  in expressions such as "I have a bad connection,"  meaning
        that there is line noise.

        console -

        continue  - To pick up where you left off, usually after  pausing
        in  the  middle of a message.  CTRL-Q and the spacebar  are  used
        most commonly to let the BBS know that you want to continue.

        control character - On of 32 ASCII characters that does not print
        on your screen or printer.  These characters are usually used  to
        control your computer.  [see also CTRL]

        copyright  - A term meaning that a program or text file  is  pro-
        tected  by the government so that it may not legally  be  copied,
        except to make backup copies.  You should not upload a copyright-
        ed  program to a BBS, unless it is shareware or  freeware.   [see
        shareware, freeware]

        Co-SysOp - A term similar to a vice president.  The Co-SysOp of a
        BBS  has  more access to the BBS than any other user  except  the
        SysOp.  The Co-SysOp might check messages to make sure that  they
        are  suitable for the BBS (not containing illegal messages),  and
        he may be able to validate users.  Sometimes a Co-SysOp is just a
        title  given to someone who helped the BBS a lot by doing  things
        such  as posting messages.  Also, there can be more than one  Co-
        SysOp.  [see also SysOp]

        <CR> - Carriage Return.  See return.

        CRC  -  Stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check.  CRC is a  system  to
        make sure that data (usually a downloaded program) is as free  as
        possible from error.

        crash - When a BBS is harmed in such a way that it is temporarily
        inoperable.   The usual cause is that some files  are  destroyed,
        either  by  accident or by a hacker.  Some people  try  to  crash
        BBS's,  a fact that most users (and especially SysOps)  think  is
        sad.

        CTRL-  The  abbreviation  for  ConTRoL.   This  abbreviation   is
        followed by a dash and then a character, such as CTRL-C,  meaning
        the control character C.  [see also control character]

        CTRL-G  -  The  control character G,  which  usually  causes  the
        computer to produce a beeping sound.

        cursor  - The marker that points out where text will next  appear
        on  your screen.  It can be one of many things, usually  a  plain
        white or flashing square, or an underline.

        cyclic redundancy check - see CRC


        ---D---


        dash - the character -.

        data   -  a  group  of  characters  that  represents   meaningful
        information.  It can be in the form of anything ranging from bank
        account numbers to all the words in a book.

        database  - [1] A program that keeps track of data, such  as  the
        information  contained on mailing labels.  [2] A large  group  of
        data.  The sum of the information that you can receive on  exten-
        sive  pay services such as CompuServe can be considered  a  data-
        base.

        database  hack  - A way that hackers attempt to  gain  access  to
        someone's account.  They create a list of common passwords  (such
        as SECRET and MINE) and try every one on an account to see if  it
        is the right password.  Knowing about this method, an intelligent
        BBS  user should realize that they should not  use  easy-to-guess
        passwords.

        data  bits - The number of bits that the modem uses to  represent
        one  byte.   This is usually 8, though it can be  7  since  ASCII
        needs only 7 of the 8 bits.

        data mode -

        data terminal ready - see DTR

        decoy program -

        default  - A setting or an answer that is automatically  assumed.
        If  80 columns is a default, then you only have to change  it  if
        you want something other than 80 columns.

        define -

        delete  -  To  destroy information.  Often you  only  delete  one
        character  at a time, such as when you are typing a message.   To
        do that you usually use the DELETE key.

        destination -

        destructive backspace - A term that indicates that your  terminal
        program  deletes the character the cursor is on when it  receives
        the backspace character.  [see also non-destructive backspace]

        dial - To send out either tones or pulses that the phone  company
        needs  to  understand what number you are calling.   Most  modems
        will dial automatically.

        dial tone - The sound that is on the phone line when the phone is
        picked  up  if it is ready to have an outgoing call  made.   Your
        modem, if it can dial, should  understand this tone.

        digital - A system using discrete numbers to represent data.   In
        computer  systems,  these are the numbers 0 and 1  (for  binary).
        [see also analog]

        DIP  switch - DIP stands for Dual In-line Package.  DIP  switches
        are  a group of small switches placed together, usually on  elec-
        tronic  equipment.  Many modems have these.  The switches can  be
        changed  to alter various settings.  For example, one DIP  switch
        on a modem may change the status of the DTR.

        disconnect  - To hang up the phone and cause the  connection  be-
        tween  you  modem and another computer to be stopped.   Most  BBS
        programs  have a way of disconnecting a user who has  called  the
        bulletin board.

        down - A word meaning that a bulletin board that is not  working,
        so  that you can not connect with it.  This can mean  that  there
        was a crash, or it could simply mean that the SysOp is playing  a
        game on his computer.  Often a SysOp will leave a phone connected
        to his BBS line off the hook so that you will get a busy signal.

        door  - A gateway that will allow a bulletin board to run a  pro-
        gram  while a user is using the BBS.  The user can use most  pro-
        grams  that  the computer can normally run.  These  programs  can
        range from games to business programs.

        download - To receive a computer file from a bulletin board.   It
        is  usually a computer program, but can also be text.  [see  also
        upload]

        driver  - A program that will connect a program to  a  peripheral
        device  (usually  a modem or a printer).  The driver  will  allow
        characters  to be sent to or received from the device.  Also,  it
        will  allow control of certain functions (such as letting a  pro-
        gram hang up the phone with the modem)

        DTR  - Stands for Data Terminal Ready.  DTR is a flag that,  when
        set, indicates that the modem will be using its built-in terminal
        program.   When  running a BBS, this flag should  be  turned  off
        (either with a DIP switch or a command sent to the modem).

        dumb  modem - A modem that only sends and receives characters  to
        or from the phone line.  [see also smart modem]

        dumb  terminal  - A keyboard and monitor that  receive  and  send
        information  either to or from another computer or a phone  line.
        It is up to the other computer to do anything else, such as  word
        wrap.

        duplex  -  The capability of both sides of a connection  to  send
        information.   Full duplex is the same as duplex.  When  you  are
        talking on the telephone to someone you are using duplex (you can
        both talk at the same time).  [see also simplex, half duplex]


        ---E---


        EBCDIC  -  Stands for Extended Binary-Coded  Decimal  Interchange
        Code.   It  is  a ways of coding characters.  It  is  similar  to
        ASCII, but it uses 8 bits instead of 7.  [see also ASCII]

        echo  - [1] A character that is sent back from a BBS  instead  of
        the one that is sent.  For example, if you enter your password on
        a  BBS it will often say `dots will echo', meaning that  it  will
        send  a  period  for every character in your password  (it  is  a
        safety  feature).   [2] When a bulletin board  or  your  terminal
        program sends back the characters that you type.  If the bulletin
        board  does not send back the characters, your  terminal  program
        should print them to your screen as you type them.

        edit - To change a message that you have created.

        editor  - The part of the BBS that allows you to enter a  message
        and edit it.

        electronic mail - see E-mail

        E-mail - (electronic mail) - Messages that are sent to individual
        people.   You  choose who to send the message to  and  only  that
        person  receives  the message.  (Some BBS programs allow  you  to
        send  bulk  E-mail, which goes to more than one person,  but  the
        concept is still the same.)

        emulate - when a communications program imitates a certain  brand
        of terminal.

        encryption  - Coding data so that people who are not supposed  to
        see the data will not.

        entry -

        EOF - Stands for End Of File.  It is the character CTRL-Z,  which
        marks the end of a text file.

        error  - When there is line noise and one or more characters  are
        changed.   This is especially noticeable when downloading or  up-
        loading  a  program.  In this case the error  must  be  detected.
        [see also line noise]

        error  free  - When referring to data  transmission,  error  free
        refers  to data that is transmitted perfectly.  This is  actually
        an impossible situation, but it is possible to have data that  is
        very, very close to error-free.

        ESC - see escape key

        escape key -

        even  parity - When the last bit of every byte transmitted  makes
        it  so  that all the bits in that byte add up to  be  even.   For
        example, if you have the byte 0111101, the next digit would be 1,
        creating  01111011,  so that there are 6 ones (an  even  number).
        [see also parity, odd parity, mark parity and space parity]

        executive  mode - When a user is connected to a  bulletin  board,
        but the SysOp is controlling the bulletin board.  The most common
        use of an executive mode is when the SysOp validates users  with-
        out the user having to hang up.

        exit - see logoff

        external modem - A modem that is located outside of the computer.
        It  is hooked up to the computer with a cable, most  commonly  an
        RS-232C cable.  [see also internal modem]


        ---F---


        FCC - Stands for Federal Communications Commission.  This is  the
        government agency that is responsible for making sure that  phone
        lines are being used correctly and that radio interference is  as
        close to nonexistent as possible.

        feedback  -  A message that is sent by a user to the SysOp  of  a
        bulletin  board.  While it is meant to be a way for the  user  to
        let  the  SysOp know of any complaints or  compliments  they  may
        have, it is more often a convenient way of sending E-mail to  the
        SysOp.

        file  - Any data that is stored by a computer in a form  that  is
        accessible by disk.  It can normally a program, text, or data for
        a program.

        filter - When a communications program or a BBS program take  out
        certain characters or words and don't accept them.  For  example,
        a  bulletin  board program may filter out CTRL-G's  so  that  the
        SysOp  does not hear the beeping.  Also, some BBS  programs  have
        the ability to take out obscene words from messages.

        flag  - A piece of information that is either TRUE or FALSE.   It
        is  used  in  some bulletin board security  systems  to  indicate
        whether  the  user has access to certain parts  of  the  bulletin
        board.  It is also used by modems for certain indicators such  as
        DTR.

        flow control -

        format  - Information such as `8N1' that describes the  way  that
        your  computer  and a bulletin board should  be  connected.   The
        first  digit  is normally 7 or 8, the number of data  bits.   The
        second character is a letter describing the parity (N for None, M
        for  Mark,  S for Space, O for Odd, and E for  Even).   The  last
        number is the number of stop bits.  8N1 is most often assumed.

        forward - When pertaining to E-mail, it means to send E-mail that
        you received to someone else.

        framing  bits - Bits that are used to separate  characters.   The
        bits themselves are not used for information.

        freeware  - Computer programs that are copyrighted, but they  may
        be  legally  copied if there is no payment  involved.   They  are
        almost  the  same as public domain programs,  but  public  domain
        programs  are not copyrighted and may be sold for payment.   [see
        also public domain, shareware, copyright]

        full duplex - see duplex


        ---G---


        general  file - Any kind of text on a bulletin board that is  not
        specifically E-mail, a bulletin of any sort or a message.  Usual-
        ly they are long files for the user's information.  Some examples
        of  general files are: a file containing more information on  the
        bulletin board program, a newspaper article about a controversial
        issue,  and  an article that explains how to make your  own  disk
        drive.

        global scan - When a bulletin board goes through all the messages
        on all boards to check for new messages that the user has not yet
        read.   This is very useful as it prevent you from having  to  go
        through each board to check for new messages.

        goodbye -

        guest  -When a user is just looking at a bulletin board and  does
        not  want to receive an account there.  The user usually has  the
        same  privileges  as a new user who has not yet  been  validated.
        Quite a few bulletin board programs allow guests.  This is a good
        feature, since the SysOp does not have to validate users who will
        not be calling the board more than once or twice.


        ---H---


        hacker - [1] A programmer who likes to experiment with  computers
        (this  is the type of person who will not read the  documentation
        to software).  [2] A person who attempts to abuse the  privileges
        of  computer BBS's and other services.  His activities may  range
        from getting and exploring an account he is not supposed to  have
        on a mainframe computer to attempting to crash a bulletin  board.
        These people are unwanted by most BBS's.

        half  duplex - Same as simplex.  It is a mode which  allows  only
        one computer at a time to transmit information.  When one comput-
        er is finished, the other then can start to transmit.

        hand-shaking  -  The process of establishing an  electronic  link
        between  two computers.  Handshaking can let both computers  know
        the speed they will be using, as well as other information.

        handle - see alias

        hang  - When a bulletin board all of a sudden starts to do  noth-
        ing.   That  is, it will not accept calls or let the  SysOp  type
        anything until the computer is turned on again.

        hang  up - When someone closes a switch which stops  a  telephone
        connection.   This either happens when someone puts  a  telephone
        receiver into its cradle or when the person instructs the comput-
        er to hang up.

        help  file - Many BBS systems will include information of how  to
        run  the  system  in case you are having  troubles.   Often  just
        pressing  H at the main menu will show you the  information,  but
        with some well-designed (there's a hint of sarcasm there in  case
        you  didn't  notice it) systems you have to find  the  help  file
        somewhere, sometimes amidst the files to be downloaded.

        host  -  The  computer that is being used to  send  and  retrieve
        information  from other computers.  Every BBS is a host,  and  so
        are pay services.

        host  program - A computer program that allows your  computer  to
        accept  incoming  calls.  If you want to do  anything  more  than
        that,  such  as record information or print it out,  you  usually
        have to do the programming yourself.

        hyphen - The character -.


        ---I---


        ID number - The unique number that a computer bulletin board  may
        assign  you.   If the BBS uses ID numbers, you need  to  remember
        this  number  and your password in order to access  the  bulletin
        board.  Same as user number, account number.

        idle  time - When a computer is not being used.  This  refers  to
        either   a computer running a BBS that is not busy, or  a  caller
        that  is not typing anything or receiving anything.   Some  BBS's
        will  hang  up a user if there is a certain amount of  idle  time
        (such as a minute).

        incoming  - Information that is being sent to the computer  which
        is being referred to.  Therefore, incoming data it the data  that
        is being sent to your computer.

        information -

        information system -

        initialize  -  To  set up either hardware  or  software  to  work
        correctly  with your system.  Many modems have to be  initialized
        each time they are used so they `know' what to expect.  When your
        software initializes your modem, it may tell the modem to  expect
        2400 baud and no parity, as well as the fact that you do not want
        any information to echo on your screen.

        internal  modem - A modem that is `hidden' inside your  computer.
        Outside  of your computer you will only see the phone  cord.   An
        internal modem can either be on a peripheral card that is  placed
        inside your computer, or it can be built into your computer.

        interrupt  -  An interrupt, as far as modems  and  computers  are
        concerned,  is an electronic signal that tells the computer  that
        something  important is happening.  Most modems can be set up  by
        software to send an interrupt every time a character is  received
        by the computer.  When operating at fast speeds, this makes  sure
        that the computer doesn't miss characters as it is printing  them
        on the screen or saving them to a disk.


        ---J---


        jack - A small plastic box that your phone cord fits into on your
        wall.   This  box converts the three wires that  are  inside  the
        phone  cord into 3 separate wires that the phone company uses  to
        make your phone calls.

        jump (to a different board) -


        ---K---


        K  -  When K is placed after a number, it means 1024  times  that
        number.  If you computer has 128K that means that it has a little
        more  than  128000  bytes of  memory.   Often  telecommunications
        software  will  tell you that you have a certain amount  of  free
        memory to use as a buffer.

        Kermit protocol -

        keyboard macro -

        kill - when referring to a message on a bulletin board, it  means
        deleting the message from the board.  Usually you can only delete
        the messages that you write (unless you are a SysOp).



        This  is  the  end  of  the file.   If  you  have  any  comments,
        suggestions, praise (if you REALLY liked it A LOT, you can always
        send a dollar or two) or want to help define the rest of the list
        (I have the words already, just no definition), just write to me:
