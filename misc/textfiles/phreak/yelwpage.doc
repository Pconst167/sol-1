    Access Arrangement
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Another name for a protective connecting arrangement. Access ar-
    rangement is normally used in reference to the interconnection
    of customer-provided data modems or automatic calling units in
    which data access arrangement (DAA) service includes the provision
    of a DAA with appropriate loop conditioning (including adjustments
    for loop loss) to meet data requirements. Got that?

    ~~~           ...also See Abbreviation for CB Achievement Test.

    Actual Work Time (AWT)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The average time an operator requires to handle a call. This
    corresponds to the expected value (mean value) of the holding
    time distribution used in the ol' Erlang C model. Bob the Cow
    enjoys the Erlang C model. Very much, in fact. Moo.

    Adaptive Transversal Equalizer
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A transversal filter that automatically adjusts its characteristics
    to compensate for linear distortion. Adaptive equalizers are par-
    ticularly important in data modems where their use has permitted
    voiceband data rates to be increased from about 3000 bits/per/sec
    to about 10,000 bps. This ain't no run-of-the-mill transversal
    filter, let me assure you.

    Address
    ~~~~~~~
    (1) Where fascist pig postal people deliver their letters.
    (2) A sequence of #'s that identifies the phone to which a call
        is directed. An address is usually 7 to 10 digits, depending
        on whether the destination is in- or outside the NPA where
        the call originated. Also called a Destination Code (or,
        far more technically, a p-h-o-n-e n-u-m-b-e-r).
    (3) Digital info. (a combo. of bits) that identifies a location
        in a storage device or equipment unit (ie, a computer, etc.).

    Address Signals
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Signals used to convey call destination info., such as telephone
    station codes, c.o. codes, and area codes. Some forms of address
    signals are called pulses; dial pulses, MF pulses, etc.

    Administration
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In operating companies, dial or network administration is a number
    of related functions with the aim of ensuring the overall provision
    of service by a switching system. This includes assignment of lines
    and trunks to switching terminals, collection of traffic data,
    analysis of troubles and customer gripes, and requests for
    additions and modifications to switching systems.

    Alerting (Alerting Signal)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is a signal sent to a customer, PBX, or switch to indicate an
    incoming call. A common form is the signal that rings a bell in
    your average telephone, usually arousing the customer from
    sleep, the shower, the climax of Pudenda-Around-the-Globe, etc.

    All-Number Calling (ANC)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The system of telephone numbering that uses all numbers and
    replaces the 2-letter plus 5-number (2L + 5N) numbering plan.
    ANC offers more usable combo's of numbers than the old 2L+5N
    numbering plan and has just about become nationally standard.

    Alternate Routing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A way to selectively distribute traffic over a number of routes
    which ultimately lead to the same destination. Sometimes called
    Call Detouring.

    AM
    ~~
    Amplitude Modulation; that is, when an EM wave is transmitted
    (such as radio waves), that wave is given an "identity" by
    modulating its amplitude (i.e., its 'heigth', in very rough
    terms).

    Analog Facility Terminal (AFT)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A voice-frequency facility terminal that performs signaling and
    transmission functions and includes analog channel banks. It
    interfaces between an analog carrier system and a switching system,
    a metallic facility, a digital facility terminal, or another
    analog facility terminal.

    Analog Signal
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A signal that varies in a continuous manner, such as voice or
    music. An analog signal may be contrasted with a digital signal

    Answer Delay
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Just what you think it is: the time from the beginning of a phone's
    ringing to the moment the receiving end answers. Answer delay
    patterns are one of the traffic indicators your friendly non-ess
    CO looks at when trying to nab boxers (since boxing, from the CO's
    frame of reference, is just a longer-than-normal, unsuccessful
    answer delay).

    Area Transfer

    Automatic Call Distributor (ACD)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A system for automatically providing even distribution of incoming
    calls to operator or attendant positions; calls are served in the
    order of arrival and are routed to positions in the order of
    their availability for handling the call.

    Automatic Intercept Center (AIC)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A centrally located set of equipment that is a part of an Automatic
    Intercept System and provides arrangements, having stored program
    control, whereby the caller is automatically advised, by means of
    either recorded or electronically assembled announcements, of the
    situation that prevents completion of connection to the
    called number.

    Automatic Intercept System (AIS)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A type of Traffic Service System consisting of one or more
    automatic intercept centers and a centralized intercept bureau for
    handling intercept calls.

    Automatic Message Accounting (AMA)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The automatic (the key word IS automatic...) collection, recording,
    and processing of info. relating to calls for billing purposes.

    Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The automatic identification of a calling station, usually for
    automatic message accounting (and thus, in the end, for billing).
    ANI, to you neophytes, is one of the scourges of ess. It's the
    magic that makes using Bell Calling Cards unwise...et cetera.

    Automatic Ringdown
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A technique for supervision alerting on a nondial trunk in which
    the application of a 2-second burst of ringing at the originating
    end results in a supervisory signal at the terminating manual
    PBX. See Ringdown.

    Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A private voiceband nerwork serving the Dept. of Defense. AUTOVON
    uses automatic switching and handles both voice and data traffic.

    Average Business Day (ABD)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Refers to the average of the parameter in question over the
    business days during the period considered; for example, busy-
    hour traffic, phreak traffic, etc. Business days include Mondays

    Balance
    ~~~~~~~
    (1) To distribute traffic over the line terminals at a CO as
        uniformly as possible. Without load balancing, a portion of
        the switching equipment may become overloaded even though the
        total capacity of the system has not been exceeded.
    (2) To adjust the impedance of circuits and balance networks to
        achieve specified return loss objectives at junctions of 2-
        wire and 4-wire circuits.

    Balance Network
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    An adjustable impedance used to terminate one port of a hybrid
    such that the hybrid characteristics approach the ideal when used
    to provide 2 to 4-wire conversion.

    Baseband
    ~~~~~~~~
    The frequency band occupied by one or more info. signals that
    either modulate a carrier or are transmitted at baseband freq.
    over a suitable medium.

    Baud
    ~~~~
    A unit of digital signaling rate. The signaling rate in bauds is
    equal to the reciprocal of the length in seconds of the signal
    element when all signal elements have equal length.  If sig.
    elements are not of equal length, as in "stop-start" character
    asynchronous operation, the signaling rate in bauds is expressed
    as the reciprocal of the length of the shortest signal element.
    The information rate in bits per second may be greater than the
    baud rate because one signal element can represent more than one
    bit. So, okay?

    technical info. and operating methods within the Bell System.
    Certain series of BSPs cover manufacturing, installation,
    computer crime/prevention (ha!), and equipment performance
    requirements; these things are mainly of interest to Western
    Electric. Other series are instructions for engineering, operation,
    and maintenance, and repair of the telephone 'plant'; these are
    mainly of interest to operating companies. Other BSPs are prepared
    for the instruction and training of telephone company personnel
    (the Being a Bitch BSP for TSOs, etc.).
    Most BSPs are edited by Western Electric. Bell Labs prepares
    certain BSPs and is responsible for the accuracy of technical

        of two equally likely possibilities.

    Bits per Second (b/s)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Digital info. rate expressed as the number of binary info. units
    transmitted per second. See Symbol. If a channel produces errors,
    the info. rate (as defined by Shannon) will be lower than the
    figure noted above, but this lower figure is rarely used.
    Typically, a data channel is described as having a stated bit rate
    and a stated expected error rate.

    Blocking
    ~~~~~~~~
    The inability of the calling party to be connected to the called
    party because either a) all suitable trunk paths are busy or b)
    a path between a given inlet and any suitable free outlet of the
    switching network of a switching system is unavailable.

    Bridged Tap
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Systems, such as key telephones, pbx's, automatic call distrib-
    utors, and telephone answering systems, that are used to fill the
    communication needs of business customers and the discerning
    phreak. Because BCS has become a term used by other companies, the
    term is being replaced by Customer Switching Systems (CSS).

    That hour during which the portion of the telephone network in
    question carries the most traffic. Traffic peaks caused by
    holidays or special events are not considered. Switching systems
    and trunk groups are normally sized for the busy hour load.

    Busy Hour, Bouncing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The highest load may not occur at the same hour on all days, need-
    less to say. If the highest load is selected for each day without
    regard to the hour in which it occurs, the average of these loads
    is said to occur in the bouncing busy hour. Traffic measurements
    are usually made over the five working days of each week.

    Busy Hour, Fixed
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    (Okay, this is the last busy hour def. Bear with me. This stuff is
    great for social engineering. Really. Anyway, you never know.)
    When the hourly loads are averaged across days for each hour of the
    day, the max. of these averages defines the fixed busy hour, also
    called the time consistent busy hour. Traffic measurements are usu-
    ally made over the five working days of each week.

    Busy Tone
    ~~~~~~~~~
    An audible signal indicating a call can't be completed because

  Call Store
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  The equipment unit of an Electronic Switching System that provides temporary
  memory storage of information pertaining to call processing & maintenance.

  Call Waiting
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The custom calling service adored by millions that provides a tone burst
  to a customer on an established call when a second call has been directed
  to that line. The notification tone is heard only by the called customer,
  whereas the incoming caller hears regular ringing. The customer can place
  the existing call on hold, connect to the calling party, and then repeat
  the procedure to reestablish the original connection. This operation can
  be done ad nauseum. [See File on the Call Waiting Tap...available to some]

  Carrier System
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A system for transmitting one or more channels of information by processing
  and converting to a form suitable for the transmission medium used by the
  system [got that?]. Many information channels can be carried by one broad-
  band carrier system. Common types of carrier systems are frequency-division,
  in which each info. channel occupies an assigned portion of the frequency
  spectrum, and time-division, in which each info. channel uses the trans-
  mission medium for periodic assigned time intervals.

  Carterfone Decision
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The MONUMENTAL decision made by the FCC in 1968 to the effect that telco
  customers should be allowed to connect their own equipment (i.e.
  DATA MODEMS) to the public telenetwork provided that this interconnection
  not adversely affect the telco's operations or the utility of the tele-
  phone system to others. Prior to this wonderful decision, only telco
  provided equipment could be hooked up to the network. Let's take a
  few moments to thank the Modem Deity for Equal Access.

  original modulating signal.

  Coherent Phase-Shift Keying (CPSK)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  is conveyed by selecting discrete phase changes of the carrier relative
  to a reference. See Coherent Modulation System or a physicist near you.

  Coin-First Service
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Coin telephone service in which an initial rate deposit is required to
  obtain a dial tone. Coin-first service is being replaced by dial-tone-
  first, an improved service requiring additional functions in the station
  and in the switching system. (Thus the BIOC concept that areas with
  coin-first fortress phones are served by older switches.)

  Coin Relay
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  A relay in a coin telephone that collects or returns the coins under the
  control of the central office. This relay is activated by CO tones,
  and in areas that do not use out-of-band signaling, Red Box tones can
  mean free calls by activating this relay.

  Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This is as precise a definition as I could find. I remember on Phreak Klass
  2600 (in 806), the arguments used to rage as to what CCIS is and how
  it negates or prevents boxing. Sigh. I'll go into all that here, since
  CCIS is one of the Top Five most-likely Philter Questions.

  CCIS is a signaling system, developed for use between stored program
  switching systems (i.e., ESS et alia), in which all of the signaling info.
  for a group of trunks (i.e., operator or 'blue box' MF tones, Green and
  Red tones) is transmitted over a dedicated high-speed data link, rather
  than on a per-trunk basis (i.e. inband signaling, whereby tones
  were actually 'shuttled' on your voice trunk). CCIS can reduce call setup
  time and save money (yeah!) compared with individual trunk signaling.

  That is the definition. Now, you may wonder what the difference
  is between out-of-band signaling and CCIS. Alright, though some will
  say that they're the same, that's not quite so. CCIS is out-of-band, but
  out-of-band is not always CCIS. Got that? That is to say, out-of-band
  is the generic label of signaling that occurs outside the voiceband.
  This method usually places signaling at frequencies beyond the voice
  frequencies, but not necessarily on a dedicated-trunk (CCIS). Thus,
  per-trunk signaling COULD be out-of-band. CCIS, on the other hand,
  devotes a separate trunk to signaling data. Thus, all such signaling
  is carried over a trunk separate from the voice trunk. This is out-of-
  band in a sense, then. The following is a letter I wrote to 2600 Mag. and
  their response. It's not too explicit, but it may help clarify a touch.

  Dear 2600:
       In the course of two years of telecom, I've read countless Gfiles
  which describe the (virtual) spectrum of 'boxes'. Yet few files give
  a clear explanation as to why boxing is impossible in many electronic
  switching offices. Would you mind explaining CCIS, and just how this
  'prevents' boxing? Thanks.

  Reply: "Put quite simply, it's impossible to blue box in an electronic
  switching office under CCIS because the equivalent of the blue box tones
  that a phreak would send are transmitted over a completely different line.
  Since you don't have access to these lines, blue boxing no longer works.
  This is ALSO called out-of-band signaling."

  Common Control
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  An automatic arrangement in which items of control equipment in a switching
  system are shared; they are associated with a given call only during the
  periods required to accomplish the control functions. All Bell System
  Crossbar and ESS systems have common control. This is in contrast to the
  individual relays of Strowger switching.

  Common-Control Switching Arrangement (CCSA)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  An arrangement in which switching for a private network is provided by one
  or more common-control switching systems. The switching systems may be
  shared by several private networks and also may be shared with the public
  telephone network.

  Common Language Code

  places, place names, etc. (Be nice to get ahold of a summary...anyone?)

  Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Created by authorization of Congress in the Communications Satellite Act
  of 1962. This private corporation (NOT any agency of the U.S. Government,
  though subject to governmental regulation) was created primarily to
  provide for the establishment, operation, and management of a commercial
  communications satellite system. COMSAT presently acts as manager for
  INTELSAT and also represents the U.S. in INTELSAT.

  Community Dial Office (CDO)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A small automatic switching system that serves a separate exchange area
  having its own numbering plan and ordinarily having no operating or
  maintenance force located in its own building; operation is handled and
  maintenance is directed from a conveniently located and beautifully
  landscaped point referred to as an operator office.

  Compandor
  ~~~~~~~~~
  An abbreviation for compressor-expandor. A device used to compress the
  range of talker volumes at the input to a carrier system (in particular,
  to increase low-level talker volumes) and to expand the received volumes
  at the output of the carrier system (to provide complementary function
  and to make the transmission system transparent). This technique improves
  the signal-to-noise ratio for low-level talkers and provides a
  substancially reduced received noise level during the so-called quiet
  intervals. A miracle, really.

  Compandor Mistracking
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If this shows up on a philter, leave me mail. Mistracking refers to the
  failure of the expandor-characteristic of a compandor to complement
  exactly the compressor-characteristics, thereby causing signal distortion.

  ~~~~~~~~~
  In Step-by-Step switching systems, a 2-motion electromechanical switch that
  operates on the last two digits of the telephone number to connect from a
  selector to any one of 100 customer loops. The connector performs the
  following functions:
  o Tests for busy
  o If busy, returns busy tone
  o If idle, rings the called party and returns ringback tone to calling line
  o Provides a supervisory signal indicating that answer has occurred and
    trips ringing
  o Provides talking battery to the calling line on intraoffice calls and
    to the called line
  o Disconnects when the customer hangs up
