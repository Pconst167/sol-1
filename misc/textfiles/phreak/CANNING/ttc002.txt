Introduction:  The purpose of this manuscript is to introduce useful phreaking
-------------  techniques.  These techniques have been developed by the Third
Cartel and have proved to be convenient and reliable.  


Field Phreaking Kit:  
====================

The Field Phreaking Kit is a neccessity for the serious phreaker.  Some 
so-called phreaks get all of their information including codes from BBSs and
have an ego big enough to call themselves phreaks.  The real phreak acquires
knowledge on his own through perseverence and ingenuity.  Following is a list 
of useful items for your Phreaking Kit:

o  Backpack:  Get a nice one to hold all of your materials.
o  Test Phone:  Very Handy.  We'll tell you how to get one or make one.
o  Ratchet Set:  Usually, you'll only need 7/16 and 3/8" size ratchets.
o  Screwdrivers:  Get medium and large screwdrivers, and a phillips head.
o  Wire Cutters:  Just in case you want to wipe out some lines.
o  Pliers:  For misc. stuff.
o  Xacto or Pocket Knife:  To strip or cut wires.
o  Penlight:  Nice and small; very useful for night work.
o  Flashlight:  If you need lots of light and have enough room in your pack.
o  Gloves:  Make sure you don't get shocked or leave your fingerprints around.
o  Pencil and Paper:  Write down locations, notes, numbers, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Third Cartel carries the following optional materials in their Field Kit:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Walki-Talkies:  For communications when yelling isn't possible or smart.
o  Battery Operated Camara Flash:  Good for flashing in someone's eyes at night
                                   Will blind a telco guy for a few seconds.
o  Mace/Dog Repellant:  Spray in someone's eyes if they give you trouble.
o  Smoke Bomb:  Helpful to divert attention or scare. [drop in telco car]
                [Mix 3 parts potassium nitrate with 2 parts sugar and melt]
o  Matches:  For smoke bomb or anything that is flammable.
o  Bandana/Surgical Mask:  Manholes are dusty; Wear these for easier breathing.
o  Marker:  Mark your "territory" on phone boxes.
o  Fake Telco ID Card:  Will make some people think that you work for telco.

Organize your kit so you know where everything is and can get something quickly
when needed.  You don't want to be fumbling for your mace when the gestapo is 
about to get you.


Test Phone:
===========

The Test Phone is the most useful piece of equipment for Field Phreaking.  You 
can try to sneak into a telco Plant Department [truckyard] and get a real test 
phone out of a truck like we did.  If you'd rather not do this, don't worry; 
making your own test phone is ultra-easy.

First, get a telephone for your own purposes.  Find the wire coming out of the
phone that is supposed to go to the wall's modular jack.  It should be at least
three feet long for convienience.  Cut off the modular jack at the end of the 
wire.  Strip the wire, and there should be two or four small  wires inside.  
Hook the two middle wires to alligator clips [preferably insulated]. You now 
have a test phone!  Very easy, indeed.  Now let's see if you hooked everything 
up ok.  First find your phone box.  It'll probably be on the outside of your 
house.  It's farly small, and you might need the ratchet to open it up.  Once 
you get it open, you should see some screws.  These are the terminals for your 
phone line.  Hook the alligator clips to the two top terminals.  If your phone 
is ok, you should get a dial tone.  Once you know that your phone is working, 
a whole new world opens up to you!  You can hook the phone up to your 
neighbor's terminal and call long distance or yell at the operator on their 
line.  Be careful, though.  You don't want to be talking to Sue in L.A. when 
your neighbors are home and awake.  If they pick up the phone when you're 
already on, you could get into serious trouble.  Of course, you could always 
listen in on them!  If you want, you can hook wires up to your neighbor's 
terminal and lead them to your house.  In case you didn't know, this is called 
Beige Boxing.  You can then hack computers on their line, call Dial-A-Prayer, 
etc.  Make sure to hide the wire well so that it won't be traced to your 
house!


Manholes:
=========

One way to get access to an abundance of phone lines is by getting into telco 
manholes.  You don't want to accidentally get in a sewer manhole, so the first 
thing to do is find the differences between sewer and telephone manholes.  If 
you have trouble with this, here's a few tips that might help:
o  Telco manhole covers are usually larger and heavier than other covers.
o  Telco manholes are scarce compared to sewer manholes.  So if there are
   a lot of checkered manhole covers in your area, those are probably sewer 
   manholes.  If there are only a handful of unmarked manhole covers in
   your area, those probably contain phone lines.
o  Go to your local telco Central Office [CO] and find out what the manhole 
   covers look like there.  Find manhole covers that look the same in other
   areas, and pick a convenient/safe manhole to explore.   

Getting into a manhole is a different story.  Here in the Denver area, it takes
at least three people to get a manhole cover off.  Hopefully it'll be easier
to do in your area.  To open the manhole, you'll probably need at least two
crowbars [You could try using a pickaxe].  Get a group together to open the 
manhole, using 2 or more people with crowbars to slide the cover off.  You 
might want to get a strong guy to push the manhole cover while the other people 
with crowbars support it.  If you know of a tool that was made specifically
for opening manholes, we'd appreciate it if you contacted us on
