How to hack the lines...
go down to your local industrial estate and find the box where the lines
connect.
 Right, now from the box, (They look like this..)

                          __________
                         /          \
                         |  O    O  |          O = terminal
			 |  O    O  |
			 |          |
                         |  O    O  |
                         |  O    O  |
			 |          |
                         \__________/

You get a resistor and place it across from the top left to the top right,
Now get a piece of wire and attach this from the top-middle right to the top
middle left, No trace the line that was attached to the left hand one and
find out where it goes,. Find out the number for the place,.
When you dial the number you will now get a dial tone,. Try it and see.
You will now get local rate calls for where ever you dial from this no.

		Have Fun !!!!
