   Hello. This is a Phile on what
those nice, innocent, little green
boxes on street corners are used
for. Beware! The penalty for breaking
into one of these is >very< steep!
It comes under Phederal juristiction,
Since it has to do with Communication!
Watch your ass!
   
   Now that I have scared ya a little,
let me tell you that >yes< I have
been in several of these...and I know
what I am talking about!!
   
           Different Types
           --------- -----
 
   There are 3 different types of
of 'Cans' or 'boxes.' The first type
I will talk about is the small
type. The little puny ones that are
painted pale green. We will call these
cans 'type 1' or just '#1' for easier
description.
   The second one that I will talk
about is the type on fone poles.
Either on the top, or at the base.
These are very thin, and only 2 feet
tall and 2 inches wide. They don't
have anything in them. We will call
these 'type 2' or just '#2' for easier
description.
   The third type is the big suckers.
They are painted dark green, and
have brown panneling on each door
shaped like rectangles. They are the
ones that have the interesting
stuff! We will call these 'type 3' or
just '#3' for easier description.
 
 
             Finding One
             ------- ---
 
   It is easier a lot more easier to
find any can than it is to find a
manhole.
  Type #1 are more frequent than
#3. They will be every 4 streets on
track-houses, and every 300 or so
yards in hilly area. In the city,
I dont know. But they do have them.
  Type #2 are on every other 5-8
poles. They will be silver, and 
usually have some Greek writing on
it. These are company test lines or
trunks! Write them down, although
they might be something else, 
sometime you get lucky! The sliver
suckers will sometimes be 5 feet
off the ground, and have the standard
spring-bolt lock. (a spring bolt
lock is a flat me3[handle fitting
into the metal case, that has a
7/8 inch bolt on it. Turn the bolt
1/2 turn to the left, and it will
pop open!) It could have a lock 
though, so bring some Thermite, or
Chain-cutters. (these can be 
'obtained' (i mean stolen, borrowed,
or bought) from any hardware store,
or Montgomery Wards has them for
about 45 bux..(thats what mine were!)
I advise that you only open a silver-
can if it is the 5-foot kind, cause 
any cop can see you, and you will
be >stuck< up the pole looking very
funny. Also, you may fall off!!
  Type #3 is the meaty one! These
are very rare. Every 1/2 mile or
so usually. But, they can be very
well hidden! (under a hanging tree
branch) behind a incredibly huge
thorn bush. (the ghistapho are
>very< clever) Don't be discouraged,
a determined phreak like you can find
one, if you look a‘*¹½Õ¡¹¢…«V¯C…are approximately 3 1/2 feet wide,
3 feet tall, and 1/2 foot deep. 
(or wide.) They almost >always< have
the standard spring bolt lock on
them. But if not..get out the chain
cutters! 
 
   If you are wondering how the wires
get into the boxes, they come in 1
pipe from below the street (for type
#1) and 2 pipes from below for
type #3. They are cables, if you
cut one, with a metal tool (how
else??) No matter how much insulation
you have, you are history. (unless
you have an abnormal heart) Remember,
insulative type material isn't proof
against high voltage. Any thing can
conduct electricity! Even your rubber
gloves! Or wood! Its just how much
they can conduct. Wood is a >very<
bad conductor, but given 10,000
volts, it will give you about a
200 volt shock. (not much, but it
can kill you!!) So watch out!
 
            
       The Presents They Hold
       --- -------- ---- ----
  
 
  Type #1 is very stingy. They rarely
have extra wire supplies, but they
usually have aligator-clips. And if
you are real lucky, some crimps.
   Type #1 contains about 100 rows
of PC panneling, with blue, red,
and sometimes green wire sticking out
of the little PC holes. (PC stands
for 'printed circuit' for those of
you that aren't familiar with
a little electronics.) 
   >DON'T< ever mess with any of
those wires! It could cause a small
electrical fire in there, resulting
in your clothes catching on fire,
loss of phones to about 100+ people,
or any dry leaves around igniting,
then you'll have a >real< problem!
   If you find anything of use, take
it. The Phone guys dont miss anything.
They have a huge stock room. They
can take virtually anything they want
for 'extra' supply. They won't miss
anything. (-note: The only reason
there is extra wire, clips, or crimps
lying around is they leave it after
they have opened a bag of crimps, or
started a spool of wire, and the other
guys just use the open stuff.)
   Type #2 has absolutely >nothing<
except...yes! Trunk line numbers,
AT&T office numbers, and Some AT&T
Technician's Mother's fone number.
(they sit up there talking to Mom
sometimes! Ha!) These numbers will
be written in chalk, or scratched in
to the sides of the sliver cans.
They won't be like:
     
            415/949-1049
         (thats my ae line)
            (pw:gossip)
 
They will look like this:
 
       41-59-49-10-49-03-73
 
   Write these down, they might
not be accessable from you home
fone. Maybe only fromt the fone-
pole test line..or wire. (you'll
see if you are ever looking in one
of those tubes on a fone line wire)
 
   Type #3 is the meaty one, like
I have said before! It will usually
contain the following:
 
2 spools of Dbl insulated wire (400ft)
About 25-30 aligator clips at the
bottom.
Maybe 1 or 2 test sets if you are
very, very lucky!
 
   Besides all of that nice stuff,
which by the way, is yours phree,
compliments of AT&T! (i hope that
didnt ryhme!!) There is some phun
stuff you can do.
   With your newly found test-sets,
you can now tap into lines. Simply
take the 2 clips from your newly
found test set, and attach them to the
2 screws you will find in the upper
right corner of the box. There 
>should< 2 wires with clips hanging
on the end of eash screw. Take these,
and attach them to the 2 wires that
you have selected to tap into!
The 2 wires you selected should be
together, by the way.
   There might be a few company
test-trunks scratched in somewhere
also. Sometimes, I have sen little
notes from: "Bob" to "Mack" that
say stuff like: "well, VTE#38 is a 
little loose, but I didn't have time
to fix it". Interesting? Write your
own!
    "Hi. Thsi is Mr. Phreak, could
you please leave some more wire,
im running low". They might reply!
Ha!
 
If you find any more uses for these
cans, let me know! Im always
interested.
