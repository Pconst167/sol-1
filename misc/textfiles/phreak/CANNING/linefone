      A Line-mans phone, is really just a phone that you can use
 anywhere. It has two alligator clips, that can be hooked into someones
 phone junction box (He He), and you can make calls off of it. This is
 a short tutorial of what you need to make one and how to do it.

      First, you need a trimline phone. That is a phone where the dial
 is in the handset. Pry off the plastic that covers the phone number
 on the base. (The part with the bell in it is the base) There should
 be two screws. Loosen them and take the plastic cover off of the base.
 Find where the wire from the handset comes in. If it is a modular
 phone (One with a small plastic plug), there should be a red and a
 green wire connecting to a circiut board. If the phone is hard wired,
 (Meaning there is no plug, the wires go right into the phone, the
 color of the wires could be anything) Take the red and green wires,
 (Or what ever color YOU have), and remove them from the screws. Next,
 find where the line cord (The wire that comes from the wall) connects.
 It should be to the same circuit board. Place the wires coming from the
handset on the wires that are coming from the wall. hook the red to
the red and the green to the green. You should hear a dial tone. Most
 trimline phones do not need anything in the base to work. The base only
 has the bell so it will ring.
 
     Once you have confirmed a dial tone, and also that it dials, take
 two alligator clips and hook one to each wire.( to the green and red
 wires coming from the handset) If you phone is modular, take the
 small modular outlet out of the phone base, and plug the handset
 into that outlet, and hook the wires that used to be hooked to the
 circut board, to the alligator clips.
 
       One last test, clip one alligator clip to the red wire that
 comes from the wall, and hook one to the green wire that comes from
 the wall. You should hear a dial tone and you should be able to
 dial out. Wrap these alligator clips in electrical tape and you are all
 set. You can invade a junction box anywhere and make some calls!!
 This will work with a rotary phone or a push button phone. This is
 a good way to get back at someone you do not like. Make a call to
 England off of his box outside and he will get the bill.
