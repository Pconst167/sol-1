* Introduction:

Since the days of hacking using a standard telephone line are almost over,
many of todays hacker community are moving towards cellular communications.

ESN/MIN pairs are no longer difficult to obtain and if used carefully will
last much longer than calling cards, codes and most other methods of phone
phreaking.

This text file will explain how to easily connect any cellular phone to a
modem, without the expense of buying a cellular line interface or
similar device.

* What you will require:

To undertake this project you will require the following;

1 desktop telephone
1 telephone doubler socket
4 lengths of wire (30cm long)
1 roll of solder
1 roll of masking tape

You will also require a soldering iron, wire strippers and a screw driver.

* Instructions:

1. Unscrew the screws holding your desktop telephone handset together. Remove
the ear piece speaker and microphone from the plastic moulding and cut
the wires connected to them.

2. Now solder the 30cm long lengths of wire onto the existing handset ear
piece speaker and microphone wires. Once you have done this, simply re-solder
the ear piece speaker and microphone onto the extended handset wiring.

3. Place the extended handset ear piece speaker over the mouth piece on your
cellular telephone and wrap in masking tape. This will not only hold the
extended handset ear piece speaker in position, but also prevent background
noise problems.

4. Now place the extended handset microphone over the ear piece on your
cellular telephone and wrap in masking tape as above.

* How to use the device:

Basically, what you have done is turned your desktop telephone into an
accoustic coupler type device. To use the device, simply follow the
instructions below.

1. Plug your telephone doubler socket into your telephone socket. Plug
your desktop telephone into one socket and your modem line into the other
socket.

2. Leave your telephone handset off the hook until your line is completely
dead. (i.e. after you have listened to "please replace the handset and try
again" or something similar about 10 times.

3. Dial the modem dialup you wish to call on your cellular phone and
press SEND as you would normally.

4. Type ATD into your terminal package and press return. Your modem should
now be off the hook and waiting for a carrier signal from your cellular
telephone.

  desktop telephone
       handset
         
* How it works:

The carrier signal from the remote modem will be sent out of your cellular
telephone ear piece speaker and into the desktop telephone handset
microphone. Your modem will receive any data send into the desktop telephone
handset after the ATD (off-hook) command has been issued.

In the same way, any carrier signals from your modem will be sent out of the
desktop telephone handset earpiece speaker and into your cellular telephone
microphone.

At the time of writing, I have not connected at speeds higher than 1200 baud
due to the low quality of anologue cellular network telephone lines. I would
expect that those using transportable cellular phones (such as the Motorola
4800 and 6800 series) should have no problems connecting at 2400 baud or
higher.

I did not write this text file so that people could use it to transfer large
amounts of data at high speed. This is simply a guide to explain how easy
it is to use any cellular telephone with a modem. 1200 baud may be slow,
but it is fine for hacking, calling your favourite underground BBS or
transfering text files --- especially if you are not paying for it!
