AUTOMATICALLY DIAL UP A TELEPHONE # THROUGH AN EXISTING DIAL-OUT LINE.

THE DATABASE MAINTENANCE FUNCTION, BILLING FUNCTION, MAY BE REMOTED BY
SIMPLY INSTALLING AUTOANSWER 300 BAUD DATA MODEMS AT THE CELL & CENTRAL
LOCATION.(AND IN YOUR HOME COMPUTER) SINCE NONE OF THESE FUNCTIONS REQUIRE
FULL TIME ATTENTION,A NORMAL DIAL-UP LINE IS ENTIRELY ADEQUATE.(BOY-O-BOY)

SYSTEM IN SAY BEAUMONT AND ADD A CUST OMER TO THE SUBSCRIBER DATA BASE,OR
DELETE ONE!(I LOVE IT)
