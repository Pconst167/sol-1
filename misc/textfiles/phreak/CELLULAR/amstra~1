        Introduction
        ============

        As  standard,  the Amstrad SRX100/200/SRD400 family of  satellite 
        receivers are only able to receive audio sub-carriers 7.02, 7.20, 
        7.38 and 7.56 MHz.  For Astra satellite television viewing  only, 
        this is fine. However, for those wanting extra radio stations (at 
        7.74  and  7.92 MHz) and/or to pick-up the sound carrier  on  the 
        Eutelsat  and Intelsat satellites (6.50,  6.60 & 6.65 MHz),  then 
        this   limited  selection  of  audio  sub-carriers  is   somewhat 
        frustrating.

        Various  commercial audio upgrades have been available for  these 
        receivers for some time - however their relatively high price has 
        made  it  difficult  for  most Amstrad  owners  to  justify  this 
        expense!

        This article describes how to make such an upgrade, yourself, for 
        about 10 UKP,  if you want to add subcarriers 6.50/6.60/6.65  and 
        7.74/7.92 MHz. If you want to add just 7.74/7.92 MHz then it will 
        only  cost  about  3 UKP.  It should be of  interest  to  Amstrad 
        owners,  who  want more than to just watch television from Astra, 
        and  also  anyone that might want to buy one of  these  receivers 
        secondhand  (they are very cheap now to pick-up - the  SRD400  is 
        usually  a bargain as it has VideoCrypt built in) and upgrade  it 
        cheaply.

        This  upgrade involves desoldering crystal(s) from your receiver, 
        placing them elsewhere on the main PCB board and connecting  them 
        up  to either a SPDT switch (by adding one additional crystal) or 
        a DPDT switch (by adding two additional crystals) - very easy!

        Please  note  that the following upgrade  has  been  successfully 
        performed  on an Amstrad SRD400,  but should be very similar  for 
        the SRX100/200 family of receivers.


        Components Required
        ===================

        In  order  to perform the upgrade,  the following components  are 
        required.  These are available from Maplins (and other  component 
        suppliers like RS Components) and their order reference and price 
        (UKP) is also given, which are valid until 28 February 1996.

        Notes:
        -----
        1) This is a Series Resonant crystal, utilising Can Style HC-49U.
           It will only be required if you want sub-carriers 7.74 &  7.92 
           MHz.

        2)  Order a Single Pole/Double Throw (SPDT) switch if you want to 
            fit ONLY ONE additional crystal, otherwise order the DPDT.

        3) You will need one resistor for each additional crystal you are 
           fitting: order one, or two, as appropriate.

        4) This is 75ohm  miniature coax cable.  If fitting two  crystals 
           then you should have a bit left over from 1 metre.

           All the components above are available from Maplins:
           Tel. +44 (0) 1702 554161
           Fax. +44 (0) 1702 553935

           Please note that Maplin add a handling charge of 1.55 UKP  per 
           per order.

        In addition,  if you require 6.50/6.60/6.65MHz audio sub-carriers 
        then  you will need to order a 17.170 MHz Series Resonant crystal 
        (Can  Style HC-49U) from QuartSLab Marketing Ltd.  This firm  can 
        make crystals up to any value (apparently). This cost me 6.50 UKP 
        inclusive of VAT and p&p in January 1995 - contact them first and 
        confirm  details  and prices (note they only  take  cheques/money 
        orders) before ordering. QuartSLab can be contacted at:

        Please note that I have no connection,  or interest,  with  these 
        companies whatsoever except as a satisfied customer.


        Tools Required to perform the upgrade
        =====================================

        The  following  tools  will be required to carry  out  the  audio 
        upgrade:

        1)      Soldering Iron
        2)      Sharp Knife
        3)      Phillips (cross-head) screwdriver
        4)      Wide(ish) flat-head (normal) screwdriver


                                        5








        How is the UpGrade possible?
        ============================

        The  Amstrad SRX100/200 and SRD400 family of receivers use two IF 
        filters  to  derive the left channel (audio modes 3  and  5)  and 
        right  channel  (audio  modes 4 and 6).  The values of  these  IF 
        filters  are  10.70  MHz  (left channel)  and  10.52  MHz  (right 
        channel). 

        Two crystals are also employed in deviring the  subcarriers,  one 
        is 17.72 MHz (audio modes 1 and 3/4) and 18.08 MHz (audio modes 2 
        and 5/6).

        If  you  take the crystal value and subtract the IF filter  value 
        the result is the subcarrier frequency that will be received, eg:


        Crystal         IF Filter       Subcarrier Remarks
        Value (MHz)     (MHz)           (MHz)

        17.72     -     10.70      =    7.02       ) ie. audio modes
        17.72     -     10.52      =    7.20       )     1 and 3/4

        18.08     -     10.70      =    7.38       ) ie. audio modes
        18.08     -     10.52      =    7.56       )     2 and 5/6

        and if we add crystals 18.432 MHz and 17.17 Mhz:

        18.432    -     10.70      =    7.732      or nearly 7.74 MHz
        18.432    -     10.52      =    7.912      or nearly 7.92 MHz

        17.17     -     10.70      =    6.47       or nearly 6.50 MHz
        17.17     -     10.52      =    6.65       also picks-up 6.60 MHz

        You might want to add subcarriers 8.10 and 8.28 MHz (with an
        18.80 MHz crystal!):

        18.80     -     10.70      =    8.10
        18.80     -     10.52      =    8.28

        In practise, the 18.432 MHz crystal gives excellent performance.

        The  17.17 MHz crystal is satisfactory for subcarriers  6.50  MHz 
        and 6.65 MHz. A slight distortion is experienced on 6.60 MHz, the 
        distortion being worse on weak stations.  This may, however, have 
        more  to  do  with the de-emphasis system used  on  the  Eutelsat 
        satellites (50 us) as the Amstrad receivers use 75 us.

        Performing the UpGrade
        ======================

        When referring to top,  bottom,  left hand side, right hand side, 
        etc.  please note that I am referring to the view of the receiver 
        when  it is in its normal position with the control panel  facing 
        you, as below:

                          Rear/back of the receiver

                    \ \     \                                          \

                Figure 1: Amstrad SRX100/200/SRD400 satellite receiver


        Once you have obtained the components, outlined above, proceed as 
        follows:

        1) Disconnect your receiver from the electricity mains supply and 
           disconnect all leads going into the receiver (LNB,  TV aerial,
           RF out, etc.).

        2) Place your receiver on a suitable workbench.

        3) Switch on your soldering iron (to warm up!).

        4) Turn the receiver over and undo the four screws underneath.

        5) Remove the top cover (slide backwards and lift).

        6) Remove the  front (facia) cover - there are two plastic  clips 
           holding  this on  underneath (unclip these first) and three on
           the top (unclip these last).

        7) Remove the VideoCrypt decoder board (SRD400):
           Unclip  the three leads - gently tease the leads out of  their 
           sockets with a thin wide(ish)  blade  screwdriver.  Remove the 
           two screws holding the board on. Lift out the Videocrypt board
           by pushing the body lugs outwards.

        8) Gain access to underneath of main PCB:
           Remove  the  two screws holding the board to the  lower  tray. 
           Push  lugs to  left of  receiver  outwards and lift from  left  
           hand side,  pull  slightly  leftwards and then  hinge on  left 
           hand side. Their is no need to remove this board fully.

                           Continued on next page  ...


                                        7








        The next thing to do is locate the original crystals supplied, on 
        the main board, which you will need to remove by desoldering one, 
        or two, as appropriate. The two crystals will be located together 
        on  the  board,  one  being marked 17.720 and  the  other  marked 
        18.080.

        Before  removing the crystal(s) pause and think,  at this  stage, 
        how you want to be able to switch to your new selection of  audio 
        sub-carriers.  By keeping it simple, I'll assume that you wish to 
        fit  only  the  18.432 MHz (7.74/7.92) crystal.  If you  want  to 
        select  7.74/7.92 on audio 1/3/4/7 then desolder  crystal  17.720 
        otherwise  desolder  crystal 18.08 (audio 2/5/6).  You will  only 
        need to de-solder both if you are adding two (or more?) crystals.

        If  only  adding  one extra crystal,  then the  new  circuit  for 
        switching between the old and new crystals is given below:

              position)                                                 |
         (2) ------------------------------------------------------------

                Figure 2: Schematic diagram of adding one crystal.

        If  you wish to select your new crystal on setting audio  1/3/4/7 
        then  'Crystal One',  in the diagram,  would be the  (desoldered) 
        17.720 crystal whilst 'Crystal Two' would be your new 18.432  MHz 
        crystal.

        The  connections,  that  will require soldering,  are marked  (1) 
        through to (9) above.  These connections should be made by  using 
        the inner strand of the miniature co-ax cable.  Technically,  the 
        outer  strands  should be earthed,  to reduce  any  interference, 
        although  I  found  that  this  was  not  necessary.  Keep  these 
        connections as short as possible.

        Decide where, on the board, you wish to re-locate the crystals (I 
        turned  mine upside down and glued them to the main PCB very near 
        to  their original location) and do a quick 'dry-run' of  cutting 
        the co-ax to its appropriate length before soldering anything.


                                        8








        You will need to locate your switch somewhere convenient. This is 
        best fitted after you have made your solder connections,  (1) and 
        (2) in the diagram figure 2 above,  to the main PCB and  refitted 
        the main PCB back into the lower (cover) tray with the two screws 
        (solder these connections underneath the board).

        I  found  an  ideal place to house the SPDT (DPDT if  adding  two 
        crystals) switch was between the two lips that protrude  slightly 
        inwards  into  the set on the right hand side of the  lower  tray 
        (immediately  to the right of the crystals).  You will find  that 
        the  switch will fit into the gap when the lever is facing either 
        towards  the  front  of the set or to the rear of  the  set  (not 
        facing  up or down).  You will need to make a small hole  in  the 
        right  hand  side of the lower tray so that the switch  will  fit 
        through.  I  found that I only needed one of the nuts supplied to 
        retain it in the tray.  If you locate it here, you will also need 
        to  remove,  with  a sharp knife,  part of the lip on  the  upper 
        (cover) tray, or it will not fit back on!

        Remember  to  connect  a 10Kohm resistor to  the  throws  of  the 
        SPDT/DPDT switch (connections (7) and (9) in figure 2 above).

        If  you are adding two additional crystals then you need to  just 
        'double-up' the schematic diagram in Figure 2 above.

        Note  that  the  connection  of the crystal(s)  is  not  polarity 
        dependant ie. they can be connected either way round.

        Re-assembly is a direct reversal of dis-mantling the unit.


        Some extra hints and tips
        =========================

        I've  tried my crystals on different settings and found that  the 
        following combination gave the best results:

        With DPDT switch facing to the front of the receiver (I call this 
        TV mode):

        Audios 3 and 4 give 6.50 MHz and 6.60/6.65 MHz respectively.
        Audios 5 and 6 give 7.02 MHz and 7.20 MHz respectively.

        With DPDT switch facing to the rear of the receiver (I call  this 
        Radio mode):

        Audios 3 and 4 give 7.74 MHz and 7.92 MHz respectively.
        Audios 5 and 6 give 7.38 MHz and 7.56 MHz respectively.

        The  reason that I set them up in this sequence is the  rationale 
        that  I would either want to sit down and watch TV or just listen 
        to  radio stations (the switch involves getting up  and  flicking 
        the switch over on the receiver, rather than in the armchair!).

                           Continued on next page  ...


                                        9








        Also,  most  people  are  'lazier'  when watching  TV  than  when 
        listening to the Radio.  Thus the ability to select any TV  sound 
        when the switch is in any one position.

        I  reset all channels 1 to 48 to Audio 2 (normal Astra TV sound). 
        I  can now select most Astra radio stations just by flicking  the 
        switch over (most are on 7.38/7.56 MHz).

        Particularly  for  Eutelsat viewing,  I can do all the  TV  sound 
        selecting from the armchair! (6.50/6.60/6.65 and 7.02/7.20).

        I found better performance from the 6.50/6.60/6.65 MHz crystal by 
        running  it  through the audio 1 circuit (I did try the  audio  2 
        circuit on my first attempt but experienced more distortion).

        Introduction
        ============

        As standard, the Remote control unit on the Amstrad SRX200/SRD400 
        family  of  satellite  receivers  are not  able  to  perform  all 
        functions that are available on the front panel of the receiver.

        The functions unavailable on the Remote Control are  PRESET,  H/V 
        select, TUNING DOWN, TUNING UP and AUTHORISE.

        This is particularly frustrating to those users that want to make 
        use  of  the  extended presets facility,  outlined  in  the  next 
        chapter,  and  those  that want to scan the frequencies on  other 
        satellites,  like the Eutelsat family,  without having to get out 
        of their armchair,  kneel down perhaps,  and press buttons on the 
        front panel of the receiver.

        This  article deals with upgrading the Remote Control to  perform 
        all functions, except AUTHORISE.

        This upgrade involves dismantling the Remote Control unit, making 
        up  some  connectors  with  tin-foil,   perhaps  soldering  these 
        connections to make them more reliable,  and making four  buttons 
        out  of any piece of spare rubber (black colour preferred!).  You 
        will  also  need  to cut out the new  buttons  positions  on  the 
        remote,  with a sharp knife. This upgrade really is very easy and 
        virtually free.

        Note  that  this  upgrade has been successfully completed  on  an 
        Amstrad SRD400 remote. These notes can also be adapted to upgrade 
        the  SRX200 Remote Control but the IC chip  numbers,  and  Remote 
        Control layout,  will be different on the SRX200 - experiment and 
        adapt!

        For  a  more  permanent fix,  it may be better to  purchase  some 
        silver  paint and use this instead of the silver foil.  This will 
        prove more reliable in practise.


        Components Required
        ===================

        In  order to perform the upgrade,  the following  components  are 
        required. These are normal household items!

        Tools Required to perform the upgrade
        =====================================

        The  following  tools will be required to carry  out  the  remote 
        control upgrade:

        1)      Soldering Iron (recommended - may not be necessary - will
                not be necessary if using the Silver Paint method)
        2)      Sharp Knife
        3)      Small length of wire (for circuit testing)
        4)      Wide(ish) flat-head (normal) screwdriver

                                       12








        How is the UpGrade possible?
        ============================

        The IC (Integrated Circuit) chip inside the Remote Control of the 
        Amstrad SRX200/SRD400 is capable of performing all functions that 
        are available on the front panel, except AUTHORISE (SRD400 only). 
        Also,  there are four more 'press key' contacts inside the SRD400 
        Remote (sorry,  don't know about the SRX200) that are blanked off 
        - one of these is between the STANDBY and RECALL keys,  the other 
        three  being below the CHANNEL DOWN,  CHANNEL UP and AUDIO keys - 
        all very convenient for the upgrade!

        It   would  seem  that  Amstrad  did  consider  providing   these 
        functions, as standard, on the remote but decided at a later date 
        to  blank them off.  I can only think that they did this so  that 
        users would not accidently lock themselves out of the receiver by 
        inadvertently enabling the parental lock (more of this later).



        Performing the UpGrade
        ======================

        In order to perform this upgrade, you will need to gain access to
        the inside of your Remote Control unit.

        To do this:

        1) Slide off the battery compartment cover.
        2) Remove the batteries.
        3) You should see,  inside the  battery  compartment,  where  the 
           upper cover (of the remote) meets the lower cover.
           Insert  a wide(ish) thin flat-headed screwdriver in  here,  as 
           indicated in figure 1 below.
           Push  the  screwdriver in,  and downwards (towards  the  upper 
           cover  with  the remote upside down) whilst pulling the  upper 
           cover away from the lower.  They should seperate.  Repeat  for 
           the other side of the remote.
           Pull  the  lower cover slightly upwards whilst pushing in  the 
           upper  cover at the other two clip points (one in  the  middle 
           and   the   other  at  the  end  furthest  from  the   battery 
           compartment).

        With the lower cover removed access can now be gained to the  PCB 
        of the remote.

        Remove the PCB from the upper cover,  simply by lifting, and also 
        remove  the rubber key selector (which is located underneath  the 
        PCB with the Remote Control upside-down).

        Now,  replace the PCB in the upper cover, but the wrong way round 
        (so  that  the contacts face upwards,  and towards you).  At  the 
        other  end  of  the  battery  compartment,   remove  the  battery 
        connector  and replace the other way round.  You can now  replace 
        the  batteries  (the  wrong way round) and  lay  the  rubber  key 
        selector on top of the PCB.

        Pointing your remote at your receiver (with it switched ON) press 
        the  key  in  the  bottom right hand corner  of  the  rubber  key 
        selector  (the key immediately below the AUDIO key - this key  is 
        not  full  height).  This  should activate  H/V  select.  No  new 
        connection  is  necessary to enable this function (but  you  will 
        need to cut out the 'blank off' area and make a new key - more of 
        this later).  Also note that this function is also available,  at 
        this  stage,  by pressing the key to the left of it  (immediately 
        below the CHANNEL UP key).

        Whilst  in  this  test mode you may like to  test  the  different 
        selections  possible,   and  check  these  with  my  results,  by 
        connecting a short length of wire between the IC chip pins in all 
        the different permutations.  The chip is located at the bottom of 
        the remote, or the point nearest the battery compartment.

        My  testings  have  resulted in determining  that  the  following 
        combinations are possible, as per the table in figure 3 below.

        Note  that  some  pin  connection permutations  do  not  activate 
        anything. SRX200 users will need to prepare their own table as it 
        may be different to the SRD400.

                Figure 3: Table of possible Remote Control permutations.

        In  order to activate your new Remote Control selections you  may 
        wish to solder small lengths of wire to the relevant IC chip  pin 
        soldering  the other end to your tin-foil,  or  whatever,  button 
        switch.

        I  decided against this approach.  The main reason being that the 
        pin connections are so close together on the chip that,  I  felt, 
        soldering direct to the pin(s) would have been too difficult.

        Instead,  I  traced  the relevant pin connections and  translated 
        these  into  a  map of the  'rubber-button'  switch  contacts.  I 
        decided to solder to these contacts instead (much easier).  At  a 
        later date,  I removed the silver foil contacts and replaced them 
        with new tracks painted with Silver Paint.

        As standard, each switch contact appears as in figure 4 below.

        You  are now ready to make the new connectors with  tin-foil  (or 
        paint new tracks on the board with Silver Paint).
        First,  decide the layout of your upgraded remote. I decided that 
        the layout, for my remote, would follow that in figure 7 below.

        No  further work was needed to enable H/V select.  There are two, 
        exposed,  connecting  contacts that  are,  conveniently,  located 
        beneath the button.

        In  order to enable TUNING UP (which at this time  functioned  as 
        H/V  select) I masked off the existing connection with a piece of 
        self-advesive paper (like that used for envelope labels) so  that 
        it  would not activate H/V select.  I then cut out a piece of tin 
        foil  for one side of the 'switch' (IC pin contact 6 in figure  7 
        above).  I  cut-out  a second,  longer,  strip for the IC  no  13 
        connection  part  of  the switch - this doubled  as  serving  the 
        TUNING DOWN switch as well.  Position the tin foil connectors  as 
        close  to centre,  of where the button will press,  as  possible. 
        Also,  leave  as  small a gap between the  connectors,  for  each 
        switch,  as  possible.  Same applies if you are using the  Silver 
        Paint method.

        A  thin,  tin-foil,  connection  was  then made  between  IC  pin 
        connector 6, on TUNING UP and IC pin connector 6 on AUDIO.

        A  thin,  tin-foil,  connection  was  then made  between  IC  pin 
        connector 13, on TUNING UP and IC pin connector 13 on CHANNEL UP.

        This was the TUNING UP key enabled!

        Half  of  TUNING  DOWN key was already prepared when  making  the 
        connections for TUNING UP (the IC pin 13 connection).  A largeish 
        piece  of  tin-foil was cut to double as the second half  of  the 
        switch connection,  connecting directly to IC pin connection 7 on 
        the CHANNEL DOWN switch above it.

        This was TUNING DOWN key enabled!

        Finally, PRESET needed to be enabled.

        A largeish piece of tin-foil doubled as the IC pin 5  connection, 
        connecting directly to IC pin connection 5 on the RECALL button.

        A piece of tin-foil was then cut for the IC 13 connection part of 
        the  switch.  A  long,  thin,  piece of tin-foil was then cut  to 
        connect this IC 13 connection,  on PRESET to IC pin 13 connection 
        on  the new TUNING DOWN switch.  This was run down the  left-hand 
        side and underneath the switch contact side of the PCB.

        This was PRESET enabled!

        Finally, all new contacts were soldered at their joins. I did not 
        do this on my first attempt and suffered unreliable operation, so 
        I  recommend that you solder these joins.  Solder as far away  as 
        possible from where the rubber keys will make contact,  otherwise 
        these  joins will 'break' as soon as you start using your  remote 
        again!

        To  avoid any problems in the future,  it would be better to  use 
        the Silver Paint method instead, as this is more robust.

        In order to use these keys you will,  of course,  need to cut-out 
        the rectangular key holes,  which are blanked off,  in the  upper 
        cover of the remote.

        Use a very sharp knife to cut out these holes. Try and smooth the 
        edges of these new holes after they are cut out.

        Finally,  you  will need to make some new rubber keys in order to 
        use your new functions.

        I suggest that you make the keys just a bit too big to start with 
        and  cut  to  size gradually until you get a  good  fit.  Also  I 
        suggest you leave a thin 'foot' on your new rubber switches (this 
        will stop them from falling out of the upper cover of the remote) 
        as in figure 8 below.

                                       21








        If you prepare your new rubber switches in this way then you will 
        actually  install them by inserting them from inside  the  Remote 
        Control  unit.  The  retaining  foot  is  to  prevent  them  from 
        inadvertently 'popping-out'.

        I  did  try and glue the new rubber switches on my first  attempt 
        but  rubber is not the easiest material to glue - and easily  un-
        sticks!

        Now reassemble everything,  except do not replace the upper cover 
        of the Remote Control at this stage (ie.  insert your new  rubber 
        keys  in  their  respective  housings,  replace  the  rubber  key 
        selector and replace the PCB and batteries).

        Whilst supporting the PCB with one hand, turn your remote over so 
        that  the  keys  are  facing you and check that  all  your  keys, 
        including the new ones, function as they should.

        If one,  or more, of the new keys do not function then remove the 
        batteries  from the remote,  turn the PCB and  battery  connector 
        over  and replace the batteries.  Use your test wire to check the 
        connections on the tin-foil, near to where the keys are touching. 
        If  the  function(s) fails then this would indicate that  one  of 
        your connections has come loose - re-solder! If these connections 
        are  ok  then  it may be that the rubber key  selectors  are  not 
        connecting  over the gaps in your tin-foil - reposition the  tin-
        foil connections before the glue sets!



        Some extra hints and tips
        =========================

        Try to avoid,  at all times,  hitting the H/V select key twice in 
        quick  succession  - if you then press AUDIO or RECALL  you  will 
        enter  one  of the (damned!) parental  lock  sequences.  If  this 
        happens  (four dashes will appear on your display) the best thing 
        to do is remove the mains plug,  wait 10 seconds,  then plug back 
        in!

        Introduction
        ============

        As standard,  the Amstrad SRD400 satellite receiver appears to be 
        capable  of  storing  only  48  channels.   For  Astra  satellite 
        television viewing only, this is fine. However, for those wanting 
        extra  presets  to  store  radio stations  and/or  to  store  the 
        different  frequencies on the Eutelsat and  Intelsat  satellites, 
        then this limited selection of presets is somewhat frustrating.

        Various  commercial '99 channel' upgrades have been available for 
        these  receivers  for some time - however their  relatively  high 
        price  has made it difficult for most Amstrad owners  to  justify 
        this expense!

        This  article describes how to access an extra 80 presets and the 
        good  news is that this will not cost you a penny or involve  any 
        modifications whatsover.



        Accessing the Free Presets
        ==========================

        Selecting the extra 80 presets is simplicity itself.  Go over  to 
        your  SRD400 and press PRESET then press either one of TV/SAT  or 
        RECALL.

        If  you  pressed  TV/SAT  your display will now  show  channel  0 
        (Zero)!

        If  you pressed RECALL your display will show a  frequency,  then 
        the audio mode then 0 (Zero)!

        I  would  recommend that you use the second method  (PRESET  then 
        RECALL) to access these extra presets,  just in case you have  an 
        ADX unit connected or intend to fit one at a later date.

        The  only  drawback to these extra presets is that you  can  only 
        access  them  sequentially,  by pressing the CHANNEL DOWN key  to 
        scroll  through  them  (you can press TUNING UP  or  TUNING  DOWN 
        though).

        Whilst in this mode,  which we will call Extended Mode,  you  can 
        return  to Standard (48 channel) mode by pressing CHANNEL UP key, 
        or  by  directly  accessing  one  of  the  normal,  standard,  48 
        channels.


                                       23








        Do  not store anything on these Extended Presets at this  time  - 
        read this article in full first!

        If  you press CHANNEL DOWN you will notice the display changes to 
        channel 95.  Pressing it again will show channel 94 and so on  in 
        steps of -1 (minus one).

        The  first  80  of these presets,  in extended  mode,  are  extra 
        presets.  The  next 48 are repeats of your Standard (48  channel) 
        mode  - so  changing any of these (in extended  mode)  will  also 
        change them in Standard mode.  The next 80 presets after this are 
        repeats  of  the first extra 80 presets in Extended  mode,  so  I 
        suggest  that you do not store anything whilst displaying  these, 
        or  be aware that any changes you make will also change the first 
        80 presets! After you have scrolled through these you will return 
        to Standard (48 channel) mode.

        There does appear to be an exception to this rule though.  If you 
        press  CHANNEL  DOWN until you come to channel  31,  in  extended 
        mode,  you  should see either a sparkly Teleclub or an  Astra  1D 
        TestCard  (at  the time of writing) - these are two  channels  on 
        Astra  1D  but the Amstrad SRD400 is picking them up (without  an 
        ADX!!). Pressing RECALL shows the frequency to be around 6297 (or 
        16.297 GHz) which is incorrect. Channels 31 through to 20 step -1 
        show  these funny frequencies together with Astra 1D channels  55 
        (Teleclub) or 56 (Astra 1D TestCard).  If possible,  do not store 
        anything  on these channel presets in case someone can shed  some 
        more  light  on these.  If you keep pressing CHANNEL  DOWN  until 
        channel 63 is displayed then theory dictates that channels 63  to 
        52 step -1 should be repeats of the first set of Extended presets 
        31 to 20 step -1,  but this time no TV transmissions are received 
        and  pressing RECALL displays a frequency of around 2106  (12.106 
        GHz).

        Whilst  exploring these extra presets you will notice some  funny 
        channel numbers being displayed.

        The following table, summarising the sequence of channels, should 
        be of use to you when using these extra (Extended) presets:

        Some extra hints and tips
        =========================

        Avoid  pressing the 'H/V SELECT' key twice,  as this may initiate 
        the,  damned,  parental lock function.  If you do press it  twice 
        then the best thing to do is press CHANNEL UP or CHANNEL DOWN key 
        - this will cancel any parental lock sequence.

        If  you do,  inadvertently,  enter the parental lock feature then 
        you  will need to reset the receiver by un-plugging it  from  the 
        mains, wait around 10 seconds, then plug back in.

        Introduction
        ============

        When  new,  one of the Amstrad SRD400's selling points  was  it's 
        built-in  parental  lock 'feature',  which was included to  allow 
        parents  to prevent their children,  etc.,  watching  the  erotic 
        offerings from the clear PAL channels of RTL, SAT 1 and PRO 7.

        However,  this  feature can be more of a nuisance than a facility 
        and there may be times,  for instance if you have 'freinds' round 
        that  don't know what they're doing or just simply like  pressing 
        buttons  in  all sorts of combinations,  when the  receiver  will 
        suddenly 'lock-up'.

        In  times  like these then you will not know how  to  unlock  the 
        receiver  if the PIN is unknown.  In this situation you have  two 
        choices.  Either  leave the unit on STANDBY for at least 48 hours 
        (2 days) or read this article and unlock it electronically!

        Please note that the following upgrade has not been performed  on 
        my Amstrad SRD400.

        Tools Required to perform the upgrade
        =====================================

        The following tools will be required to carry out the upgrade:

        1)      Soldering Iron
        2)      Phillips (cross-head) screwdriver
        3)      Wide(ish) flat-head (normal) screwdriver



        Performing the Repair
        =====================

        When referring to top, bottom, left hand side, right hand side, etc.
        please note that I am referring to the view of the receiver when
        it is in its normal position with the control panel facing you, as
        below:

        Once you have obtained the components, outlined above, proceed
        as follows:

        1) Disconnect your receiver from the electricity mains supply
           and disconnect all leads going into the receiver (LNB, TV
           aerial, RF out, etc.).

        2) Place your receiver on a suitable workbench.

        3) Switch on your soldering iron (to warm up!).

        4) Turn the receiver over and undo the four screws underneath.

        5) Remove the top cover (slide backwards and lift).

        6) Remove the front (facia) cover - there are two plastic clips 
           holding this on underneath (unclip these first) and three on 
           the top (unclip these last).


                           Continued on next page  ...


                                       34








        7) Remove the VideoCrypt decoder board (SRD400):
           Unclip the three leads - gently tease the leads out of their
           sockets with a thin wide(ish) blade screwdriver.
           Remove the two screws holding the board on.
           Lift out the Videocrypt board by pushing the body lugs outwards.

        Now,  locate  IC  number  IC104.  This  is located  on  the  main 
        motherboard towards the rear/right-hand side of the receiver.  It 
        is located just in front of the LNB input 'box'.

        You will need to,  temporarily,  solder/connect one end of the 1K 
        resistor to pin 5 of IC104.

                            ---------------------

             Figure 1: Chip IC104

        The other end of the resistor needs to be connected to  'ground'. 

        Do  this  by connecting it to any one of the 2 black leads  which 
        you  dis-connected from the rear of the VideoCrypt  decoder  (the 
        socket with two two white leads and two black leads).

        Once  you  have connected the resistor up in this way,  then  re-
        connect  the LNB lead back into the receiver and plug  back  into 
        the  mains (do not re-assemble the VideoCrypt decoder or  replace 
        the receiver's cover at this time).

        Do  not  touch anything inside the receiver  (keep  children/pets 
        well  away)  and  press  the  following  keys  in  the  following 
        sequence:













                           Continued on next page  ...


                                       35








        1)   Press STANDBY on Receiver's Front Panel.
                  Display should show 8

        2)   Press H/V button twice.

        3)   Press AUDIO button once.
                  Display should show - - - -

        4)   Press 1234 on Remote Control.
                  Display should show ]] ]] ]] ]]

        5)   Remove resistor whilst the receiver is still switched on. do 
             this by dis-connecting the end from the VideoCrypt lead.

             DANGER.  MAINS  VOLTAGE - DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE  INSIDE 
             THE RECEIVER WHILST IT IS STILL SWITCHED ON !

        6)   Press AUDIO button once.

        7)   Press STANDBY button once.

        If  the  receiver still fails to respond then ic104  is  probably 
        faulty.

        If  this was successful,  then dis-connect the receiver from  the 
        mains supply and dis-connect the LNB lead.

        De-solder the other end of the resistor from chip IC104.

        Re-assembly  is a direct reversal of the dismantling instructions 
        above.



        Some extra hints and tips 
        =========================

        Although  the  voltage  and  current that  will  go  through  the 
        resistor is very low, and safe, do not touch anything else inside 
        the receiver whilst performing this repair.  Some parts are  live 
        mains,  although  these items tend to be on the left-hand side of 
        the receiver, where the transformer is located.
