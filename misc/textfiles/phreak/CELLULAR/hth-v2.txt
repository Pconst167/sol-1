 Ok well, I guess you have the Motorola Software that's why your reading this.
Now let me stress to you this is for Versions  1 & 2. 

**Check which version you are using! Version #1 Software WILL NOT change 
  phones with software versions higher than 9122!!

**Version #2 (HTH-V2.EXE) will do ALL the New Phones with software later than
  9122.  

 So don't fuck up and hook up a new phone to the old software!!

Now if you need the Hook Up instructions for the phones you should be able to
get it the same place you got DownLoaded this file OR you can get it from
The New York Hack Exchange BBS (718) 379-4702. The New York Hack Exchange is
the only BBS that will get the Software & Updates before any other BBS.

Following the directions, attach the phone to the cables. Make sure the phone
is powered off, because the software will turn it on and begin reading the
programed information.
 Once the phone is attached to the programming cables, and there is adequate
power source (remember, don't turn the phone on) hit "ENTER" on your keyboard
Now you'll get another box that will ask you the type of phone that you are
programming.

 If you are programming a Motorola "FLIP" also known as the 550 line, of a
Micro Tac portable, select "M"

 If you are programming an 8000 series, also known as the "Brick","Classic"
or "Ultra Classic" then select "H"

 If you are programming any installed , bag or transportable Motorola phone
then select "C"

 If you have established a successful connection, then the screen will let 
you know, and then using the tab key and arrow keys, you may select certain
fields for editing. The most important fields are obviously the ESN and the 
MIN fields, with the "AID" used for the Home System I.D.

 Now you can type over the information you want changed, but remember to
copy the original info. somewhere just in case you have to restore the phone 
back.

 The AOIC is usually the last number of your phone number, preceded by a
Zero.

 If you don't become connected, the screen will tell you. Check your cables,
 your power source, and possibly your printer port. 
 
 The following computers have trouble running the software:
   I.B.M.'s (The real ones not the clones)
   Compaq
   and 486's with over 25Mhz clock speed.
Certain ports do not have the correct output, so if you are sure that your
wiring is correct, move the software to another computer and try again.

 After the phone is successfully programmed the menu will say disconnect
phone. Now you are ready to use your phone!!

 Remember, voltage is critical in programming phones. The cable MUST be built
 exactly as diagrammed, and the voltage supplied must be within the specified
 tolerance.

NEVER REMOVE THE PHONE WHEN IT IS CALCULATING CHECK SUMS, OR BEING READ. THIS
MAY PERMANENTLY DAMAGE THE PHONE BEYOND REPAIR. 

If you have any problems at all just leave me E-MAIL on:
 THE NEW YORK HACK EXCHANGE BBS (718) 379-4702 in the States
 OR THE HACK FACTORY +44PRIVATE in the U.K.

Greets go to The RAVEN, V2 will work I did the Mods. myself! Even though it
