NOTES:  This is a dual NAM unit.
        The ESN prefix is 153 decimal and 99 hex.
        This unit was only imported for a short time and is no longer
        supported in the USA.
        Several different software versions have been available and not
        every phone will follow these steps... Good Luck!
        Leave NAM 2 data at factory default If NAM 2 is not used.
