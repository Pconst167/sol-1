
PART III.                      TYPES OF NAMS

                     NAM Types Used in Cellular Phones

NAM- Number Assignment Module - A 32 word by 8 bit PROM
The NAM contains all the information that can be programmed to the phone
directly from the handset. (i.e. SIDH,MIN,LOCK-CODE,etc.).

All phones except NEC will accept tri-state NAMs.  NEC requires an open
collector NAM.  Fujitsu phones will accept either open collector or tri-
state NAMs.

Brand Qualifications:  Fujitsu and Alpine phones will not operate properly
with any Harris Brand NAM or with any Signetics brand NAMs with a part
number NOT ending with an "A".  TI NAMs must not be used in GE Star models.
Panasonic has suggested only TI NAMs should be used in their phones.  NAMs
are available in ceramic (F) or plastic encapsulation (N).
