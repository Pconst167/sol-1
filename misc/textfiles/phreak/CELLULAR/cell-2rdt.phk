        In the last issue we discussed the history of cellular telephony,
        monitoring techniques, and a brief description of its predecessors.
        In this issue I'll describe the call processing sequences for land-
        originated and mobile-originated calls, as well as the signaling
        formats for these processes.  I apologize for the bulk of information
        but I feel it is important for anyone who is interested in how the
        network communicates.  Please realize that there was very little I
        could add to such a cut and dried topic, and that most is taken
        verbatim from Industry standards, with comments and addendums salt
        and peppered throughout.

                          Time

        Let me review the frequency allocation for Wireline and non-Wireline
        systems.  Remember that the Wireline service is usually provided by
        the area's Telephone Company, in my area that company is NYNEX.  The
        non-Wireline companies are usually operated by other carriers foreign
        to the area, in my area we are serviced by Cellular One (which is owned
        by Southwestern Bell).  Each company has its one slice of the electro-
        magnetic spectrum.  The coverage is not continuous, remember that there
        are also 800 MHz trunked business systems that also operate in this
        bandwidth.  Voice channels are 30 KHz apart and the Data channels are
        10 KHz apart.


        Frequency Range         Use
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        870.000 - 879.360       Cellular One (mobile input 825.000 - 834.360)
        880.650 - 890.000       NYNEX (mobile input 835.650 - 845.500)
        890.000 - 891.500       Cellular One (mobile input 845.000 - 846.500)
        891.500 - 894.000       NYNEX (mobile input 846.500 - 849.000)
        879.390 - 879.990       Cellular One (data)
        880.020 - 880.620       NYNEX (data)


        The data streams are encoded NRZ (Non-return-to-zero) binary ones
        and zeroes are now zero-to-one and one-to-zero transistions respect-
        ivly.  This is so the wideband data can modulate the transmitter
        via binary frequency shift keying, and ones and zeroes into the
        modulator MUST now be equivalent to nominal peak frequency deviations
        of 8 KHz above and below the carrier frequency.


   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER - Signaling on the Control Channels

        The following information will be invaluable to the hobbiest that
        is monitoring cellular telephones via a scanner and can access
        control channel signals.  All information released below is
        EIA/TIA - FCC standard.  There are a lot of differences between
        cellular phones, but all phones must interface into the mobile
        network and talk fluently between each other and cell sites.
        Therefore, the call processing and digital signaling techniques are
        uniform throughout the industry.


   MOBILE CALL PROCESSING

        Calling:

        Initially, the land station transmits the first part of its SID
        to a mobile monitoring some control channel, followed by the number
        of paging channels, an ESN request, then mobile registration, which
        will either be set to 0 or 1.  When registration is set to one, the
        mobile will transmit both MIN1 and MIN2 during system access, another
        1 for discontinuous (DTX) transmissions, read control-filler (RCF)
        should be set to 1, and access functions (if combined with paging
        operations) require field setting to 1, otherwise CPA (combined paging
        access) goes to 0.

        Receiving:

        As the mobile enters the Scan Dedicated Control Channels Task, it
        must examine signal strengths of each dedicated control channel
        assigned to System A if enabled.  Otherwise System B control channels
        are checked.
        The values assigned in the NAWC (Number of Additional Words
        Coming) system parameter overhead message train will determine for
        the moblie if all intended information has been received.  An EDN
        field is used as a crosscheck, and control-filler messages are not
        to be counted as part of the message.  Should a correct BCH code
        be received along with a nonrecognizable overhead message, it must
        be part of the NAWC count train but the equivalent should not try
        and execute the instructions.

        Under normal circumstances, mobiles are to tune to the strongest
        dedicated control channel, receive a system parameter transmission,
        and, within 3 seconds, set up the following:

        o  Set SID's 14 most significant bits to SID1 field value.

        o  Set SID's least significant bit to 1, if serving system status
           enables, or to zero if not.

        o  Set paging channels N to 1 plus the value of N-1 field.

        o  Set paging channel FIRSTCHP as follows:
                If SIDs = SIDp then FIRSTCHPs = FIRSTCHPp (which is
                an 11-bit paging channel).
                If SIDs = SIDp and serving system is enabled, set
                FIRSTCHPs to initial dedicated channel for system
                B.
                If SIDs = SIDp and serving system is disabled, set
                FIRSTCHPs to first dedicated control channel for
                system B.

        o  Set LASTCHPs to falue of FIRSTCHPs + Ns -1.

        o  Should the moblie come equipped for autonomous registration, it
           must:

                o Set registragion increment (REGINCRs) to its 450 default
                  value.

                o Set registration ID status to enabled.

        I know that was a little arcane sounding but it's the best you can
        do with specifications.  Data is data, there is no way to spruce it
        up.  From here on out a mobile must begin the Paging Channel Selection
        Task.  If this cannot be completed on the strongest dedicated
        channel, the second strongest dedicated channel may be accessed and
        the three second interval commenced again.  Incomplete results should
        result in a serving system status check and an enabled or disabled
        state reversed, permitting the moblie to begin the Scan Dedicated
        control Channels Task when channel signal strengths are once more
        examined.

        Custom local operations for mobiles may be sent and include roaming
        mobiles whose home systems are group members.  A new access channel
        may be transmitted with a new access field set to the initial access
        channel.  Autonomously registered mobiles may increment their next
        registered ID by some fixed value, but the global action message
        must have its REGINCR field adequately set.  Also, so that all
        mobiles will enter the Initialization Task and scan dedicated
        control channels, a RESCAN global action message must be transmitted.

        Moblie stations may be required to read a control-filler message
        before accessing any system on a reverse control channel.

        System access for mobiles is sent on a forward control channel in
        the following manner.  Digital Color Code (DCC) identifies the land
        station.  Control Moblie Attenuation Code (CMAC) is included in the
        control-filler message for moblie power level transmitter adjustment
        before accessing any system on a reverse control channel.  The WFOM
        Wait for Overhead Message field must register 0 before the moblie
        accesses a system on a reverse control channel.  When moblies are
        assigned to one or more of the 16 overload classes are not to access
        organizations on a reverse control channel, an overload control message
        is carried with the system parameter overhead message overload class
        fields are set to zero among the restricted number, and the remainder
        set to 1.  Busy-to-idle status (BIS) access parameters go to zero when
        mobiles are prevented from checking on the reverse control channel and
        the message must be added to the overhead.  When mobiles can't use the
        reverse control channel for seizure messages attemps or busy signals,
        access attempt parameters must also be included in the overhead.  And
        when a land station receives a seizure precursor matching its digital
        color code with 1 or no bit errors, busy idle bits signals on the
        forward control channel must be set to busy within 1.2 milliseconds
        from the time of the last bit seizure.  Busy-idle bit then must remain
        busy until a minimum of 30 msec following the final bit of the last
        word of the message has been received, or a total of 175 msec has
        elapsed.

        Channel Confirmation

        Mobiles are to monitor station control messages for orders and
        respond to both audio and local control orders even though land
        stations are not required to reply.  MIN bits must be matched.
        Thereafter, the System Access Task is entered with a page response,
        as above, and an access timer started.
        This time runs as follows:

                o  12 seconds for an origination
                o  6 seconds for page response
                o  6 seconds for an order response
                o  6 seconds for a registration

        The last try code is then set to zero, and the equipment begins the
        Scan Access Channels Task to find two channels with the strongest
        signals which it tunes and enters the Retrieve Access Attempts
        Parameters Task.

        This is where both maximum numbers of seizure attempts and busy
        signals are each set to 10.  A read control-filler bit (RCF) will
        then be checked: if the RCF equals zero, the mobile then reads a
        control-filler message, sets DCC and WFOM (wait for overhead message
        train before reverse control channel access) to the proper fields
        and sets the proper fields and sets the appropriate power level.
        Should neither the DCC field nor the control-filler message be
        received and access time has expired, the mobile station goes to
        Serving System Determination Task.  But within the allowed access
        time, the mobile station enters the Alternate Access Channel Task.
        BIS is then set to 1 and the WFOM bit is checked.  If WFOM equals 1,
        the station enters the Update Overhead Infromation Task; if WFOM
        equals 0, a random delay wait is required of 0 to 200 msec, +/- 1
        msec.  Then, the station enters the Seize Reverse Control Channel
        Task.

        Service Requesting is next.  This task requires that the mobile
        continue to send is message to the land station according to the
        following instructions:

                o Word A is required at all times.
                o Word B has to be sent if last try access LT equals 1 or
                  if E requires MIN1 and/or MIN2, and the ROAM status is
                  disabled, or if the station has been paged with a 2-word
                  control message.
                o Word C is transmitted with S (serial number) being 1
                o Word D required if the access is an origination
                o Word E transmitted when the access is an origination and
                  between 9 and 16 digits are dialed.  When the mobile has
                  transmitted its complete message, an unmodulated carrier is
                  required for another 25 milliseconds before carrier turnoff.
                  After words A through E have been sent, the next mobile task
                  depends on the type of access.

        Order confirmation requires entry into the Serving System Determination
        Task.

             Origination means entry into the Await Message Task.
             Page response, is the same as Origination.

            Registration requires Await Registration Confirmation, which
        must be completed within 5 seconds or registration failure follows.
        The same is true for Await Message since an incomplete task in 5
        seconds sends the mobile into the Serving System Determination Task.
        Origination or Page response requires mobile update of parameters
        delivered in the message.  If R equals 1, the mobile enters the
        Autonomous Registration Task, otherwise, it goes to the Initial
        Voice Channel Confirmation Task.  Origination access may be either
        an intercept or reorder, and in these instances, mobiles enter the
        Serving System Determination Task.  The same holds true for a page
        response access.  But if access is an origination and the user
        terminates his call during this task, the call has to be released
        on a voice channel and not control channel.

        If a mobile staion is equipped for Directed Retry and if a new
        message is received before all four words of the directed retry
        message, it must go to the Serving System Determination Task.  There
        the last try code (LT) must be set according to the ORDQ (order
        qualifier) field of the message as follows:

                        If 000, LT sets to 0
                        If 0001, LT sets to 1

        Thereafter, the mobile clears the list of control channels to be
        scanned in processing Directed Retry (CCLIST) and looks at each
        CHANPOS (channel postition) field contained in message words three
        and four.  For nonzeor CHANPOS field, the mobile calculates a cor-
        responding channel number by adding CHANPOS to FIRSTCHA minus one.
        Afterwards, the mobile has then to determine if each channel number
        is within the set designated for cellular systems.  A true answer
        requires adding this/these channel(s) to the CCLIST.


        Awaiting Answers

        Here, an alert timer is set for 65 seconds (0 to +20 percent).  During
        this period the following events may take place:

                o Should time expire, the mobile turns its transmitter off and
                 enters the Serving System Determination Task.

                o An answer requires signaling tone turnoff and Conversation
                  Task entry.

                o If any of the messages listed hereafter are received within
                  100 milliseconds, the mobile must compair SCC digits that
                  identify stored and proper SAT frequencies for the station to
                  the PSCC (present SAT color code).  If not equivalent, the
                  order is ignored.  If correct, then the following actions
                  taken for each order:

                Handoff:  Signaling extinguished for 500 msec, signal tone
                          off, transmitter off, power lever adjusted, new
                          channel tuned, new SAT, new SCC field, transmitter
                          on, fade timer reset, and signaling tone on.  Wait
                          for an answer.

                  Alert:  Reset alert timer for 65 seconds and stay in
                          Waiting for Answer Task.

             Stop Alert:  Extinguish signaling tone and enter Waiting for
                          Order Task.

                Release:  Signaling tone off, wait 500 msec, then enter
                          Release Task.

                  Audit:  Confirm message to land station, then stay in
                          Waiting for Answer Task.

            Maintenance:  Reset alert timer for 65 seconds and remain in
                          Waiting for Answer Task.

           Change Power:  Adjust transmitter to power level required and
                          send confirmation to land station.  Remain in
                          Waiting for Answer Task.

          Local Control:  If local control is enabled and order received,
                          examine LC field and determine action.

                          Orders other than the above for this type of action
                          are ignored.

        Conversation

        In this mode, a release-delay timer is set for 500 mSec.  If Termin-
        ation is enabled, the mobile sets termination status to disabled and
        waits 500 mSec before entering Release Task.  The following actions
        may then execute:

        o  Upon call termination, the release delay timer has to be checked.
           If time has expired, the Release Task is entered; if not expired,
           the mobile must wait until expiration and then enter Release Task.

        o  Upon user requested flash, signaling tone turned on for 400 mSec.
           But should a valid order tone be received during this interval,
           the flash is immediately terminated and the order processed.  The
           flash, of course, is not then valid.

        o  Upon receipt of the following listed orders and within 100 mSec,
           the mobile must compare SCC with PSCC, and the order is ignored
           if the two are not equal.  But if they are the same, the following
           can occur:

                Handoff:  Signaling tone on for 50 mSec, then off, trans-
                          mitter off, power level adjusted, new channel tuned,
                          adjust new SAT, set SCC to SCC field message value,
                          transmitter on, fade timer reset, remain in
                          Conversation Task.

    Send Called Address:  Upon receipt within 10 seconds of last valid flash,
                          called address sent to land station.  Mobile remains
                          in Conversation Task.  Otherwise, remain in Conver-
                          sation Task.

                  Alert:  Turn on signaling tone, wait 500 mSec, then enter
                          Waiting for Answer Task.

                Release:  Check release delay timer.  If time expired, mobile
                          enters Release Task; but if timer has not finished,
                          then mobile must wait and then enter Release Task
                          when time has expired.

                  Audit:  Order confirmation sent to land station while
                          remaining in Conversation Task.

            Maintenance:  Signaling tone on, wait 500 mSec, then enter Waiting
                          for Answer Task.

           Change Power:  Adjust transmitter to power level required by order
                          qualification code and send confirmation to land
                          station.  Remain in Conversation Task.

          Local Control:  If local control in enabled and local control order
                          received, the LC field is to be checked for subse-
                          quent action and confirmation.

        Orders other than the above for this type of action are ignored.


        Release

        In the release mode the following steps are required:

        o  Signaling tone sent for 1.8 sec.  If flash in transmission when
           signaling tone begun, it must be continued and timing bridged so
           that action stops within 1.8 sec.
                o  Stop signaling tone.
                o  Turn off transmitter.
                o  The mobile staion then enters the Serving System Deter-
                   mination Task.

        The above is the Cellular System Mobile/Land Station Compatibility
        Specification.  The following shall be Signaling Formats which are
        also found in the above document.  I converted all these tables by
        HAND into ASCII so appreciate them.  It wasn't the easiest thing to
        do.  But I must say, I definately understand the entire cellular
        operation format.



           There are two types of continuous wideband data stream transmissions.
        One is the Forward Control Channel which is sent from the land station
        to the mobile.  The other is the Reverse Control Channel, which is
        sent from the mobile to the land station.  Each data stream runs at a
        rate of 10 kilobit/sec, +/- 1 bit/sec rate.  The formats for each of
        the channels follow.


      - Forward Control Channel

        The forward control channel consists of three discrete information
        streams.  They are called stream A, stream B and the busy-idle
        stream.  All three streams are multiplexed together.  Messages to
        mobile stations with the least significant bit of thier MIN number
        equal to "0" are sent on stream A, and those with a "1" are sent
        on stream B.

        The busy-idle stream contains busy-idle bits, which are used to
        indicate the status of the reverse control channel.  If the busy-idle
        bit = "0" the reverse control channel is busy, if it equals "1"
        it is idle.  The busy-idle bit is located at the beginning of each
        dotting sequence, word sync sequence, at the beginning of the first
        repeat of word A and after every 10 message bits thereafter.

        Mobile stations achieve synchronization with the incoming data via
        a 10 bit dotting sequence (1010101010) and an 11 bit word sync
        sequence (11100010010).  Each word contains 40 bits, including parity
        and is repeated 5 times after which it is then refered to as a
        "block".  For a multiword message, the second word block and subsequent
        word blocks are formed the same as the first word block including the
        dotting and sync sequences.  A "word" is formed when the 28 content
        bits are encoded into a (40, 28; 5) BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem)
        code.  The left-most bit shall be designated the most-signifigant bit.

        The Generator polynominal for the (40, 28;5) BCH code is:

                        12    10    8    5    4    3    0
              G (X) =  X   + X   + X  + X  + X  + X  + X
               B

        Each FOCC message can consist of one or more words.  Messaging trans-
        mitted over the forward control channel are:

                - Mobile station control message
                - Overhead message
                - control-filler message

        Control-filler messages may be inserted between messages and
        between word blocks of a multiword message.

        Message Formats:  Found on either stream A or B

     -  Mobile Station Control Message

        The mobile station control message can consist of one, two, or four
        words.

        Forward Voice Channel

        The forward voice channel (FVC) is a wideband data stream sent by the
        land station to the mobile station.  This data stream must be gen-
        erated at a 10 kilobit/Sec +/- .1 bit/Sec rate.  The Forward Voice
        Channel format follows:

  +-----------+------+--------+-----+------+--------+-----+------+------

        A 37-bit dotting sequence and an 11-bit word sync sequence are sent
        to permit mobile staions to achieve synchronization with the incom-
        ming data, except at the first repeat of the word, where the 101-bit
        dotting sequence is used.  Each word contains 40 bits, including
        parity, and is repeated eleven times together with the 37-bit dotting
        and 11-bit word sync; it is then refered to as a word block.  A word
        block is formed by encoded the 28 content bits into a (40, 28) BCH
        code that has a distance of 5 (40, 28; 5).  The left-most bit (as
        always) is designated the most-significant bit.  The 28 most-
        significant bits of the 40-bit field shall be the content bits.  The
        generator polynominal is the same as that used for the forward
        control channel.

        The mobile station control message is the only message transmitted
        over the forward voice channel.  The mobile staion control message
        consists of one word.

       SCC     - SAT color code for new channel (see SCC table)
       PSCC    - Present SAT color code.  Indicates the SAT color code
                 associated with the present channel.
       ORDER   - Order field.  Identifies the order type.  (see Order table)
       ORDQ    - Order qualifier field.  Qualifies the order to a specific
                 action (see Order table)
       LOCAL   - Local Control field.  Thsi field is specific to each system.
                 The ORDER field must be set to local control (see Order table)
                 for this field to be interpreted.
       VMAC    - Voice mobile attenuation code field.  Indicates the mobile
                 station power level associated with the designated voice
                 channel.

       P       - Parity field.




        Reverse Control Channel

        The Reverse Control Channel (RECC) is a wideband data stream sent
        from the moblie station to the land station.  This data stream runs
        at a rate of 10 kilobit/sec, +/- 1 bit/sec rate.  The format of the
        RECC data stream follows:

     +---------+------+-------+------------+-------------+-----------+-----
     | Dotting | Word | Coded | first word | Second word | Third word|
     |         | sync |  DCC  | repeated   |   repeated  |  repeated | ...
     |         |      |       | 5 times    |   5 times   |  5 times  |
     +---------+------+-------+------------+-------------+-----------+-----
  bits:  30       11      7        240           240          240


                         Dotting = 01010101...010101
                       Word sync = 11100010010


        All messages begin with the RECC seizure precursor with is composed
        of a 30 bit dotting sequence (1010...101), and 11 bit word sync
        sequence (11100010010), and the coded digital color code.

        Each word contains 48 bits, including parity, and is repeated five
        times after which it is refered to as a word block.  A word is
        formed by encoding 36 content bits into a (48, 36) BCH code that has
        a distance of 5, (48 36; 5).  The left most bit shall be designated
        the most-significant bit.  The 36 most-significant bits of the 48 bit
        field shall be the content bits.

        The generator polynomial for the code is the same for the (40,28;5)
        code used on the forward channel.

        Each Reverse Control Channel message can consist of one of the five
        words.  The types of messages to be transmitted over the reverse
        control channel are as follows:

                o  Page Response Message
                o  Origination Message
                o  Order Confirmation Message
                o  Order Message

        These messages are made up of combination of the following five words:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+


        Examples of encoding called-address information into the called-
        address words follow:

        If the number 2# is entered, the word is as follows:

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+---------+
   | NOTE | 0010 | 1100 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 |    P    |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+---------+

        If the number 13792640 is entered, the word is as follows:

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+---------+
   | NOTE | 0001 | 0011 | 0111 | 1001 | 0010 | 0110 | 0100 | 1010 |    P    |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+---------+

        As you can see the numbers are coded into four bits and inserted
        sequentialy into the train.  Notice that when the number is longer
        than 8 numbers it is broken into two different Words.

    If the number 6178680300 is entered, the words are as follows:

        Word D - First Word of the Called-Address

        Reverse Voice Channel

        The reverse voice channel (RVC) is a wideband data stream sent from
        the mobile station to the land station.  This data stream must be
        generated at a 10 kilobit/second +/- 1 bit/sec rate.  The format
        is presented below.

        A 37-bit dotting sequence and an 11-bit word sync sequence are sent
        to permit land stations to achieve synchronization with the incoming
        data, except at the first repeat of word 1, where a 101-bit dotting
        sequence is used.  Each word contains 48 bits, including parity, and
        is repeated five times together with the 37-bit dotting and 11-bit
        word sync sequences; it is then referred to as a word block.  For a
        multi-word message, the second word block is formed the same as the
        first word block including the 37-bit dotting and 11-bit word sync
        sequences.  A word is formed by encoding the 36 content bits into a
        (48, 36) BCH code that has a distance of 5, (48, 36; 5).  The left-
        most bit (earliest in time) shall be designated the most-significant
        bit.  The 36 most-significant bits of the 48-bit field shall be the
        content bits.  The generator polynomial for the code is the same as
        for the (40, 28; 5) code used on the forward control channel.

        Each RVC message can consist of one or two words.  The types of
        messages to be transmitted over the reverse voice channel are as
        follows:

                o Order Confirmation Message
                o Called-Address Message

        The message formats are as follows:

     The fields are descriptions a the same as those for the Reverse Control
     channel above.



        Overhead Message

        A three-bit OHD field is used to identify the overhead message
        types.  Overhead message type codes are listed in the table below.
        They are grouped into the following functional classes:

                o System parameter overhead message
                o Global action overhead message
                o Registration identification message
                o Control-filler message

        Overhead messages are send in a group called an overhead message
        train.  The first message of the train must be the system parameter
        overhead message.  The desired global action messages and/or a
        registration ID message must be appended to the end of the system
        parameter overhead message.  The total number of words in an overhead
        message train is one more than the value of the NAWC field contained
        in the first word of the system parameter overhead message.  The last
        word in the train must be set to '0'.  For NAWC-counting purposes,
        inserted control-filler messages must not be counted as part of the
        overhead message train.

        The system parameter overhead message must be sent every .8 +/- .3
        seconds on each of the following control channels:

                o combined paging-access forward channel.
                o Separate paging forward control channel
                o Separated access forward control channel
                  when the control-filler message is sent with the WFOM bit
                  set to '1'.

        The global action messages and the registration identificaion message
        are sent on an as needed basis.
                o The system parameter for overhead message consists of two
                  two words.

        The interpretation of the data fields are as follows:

        T  T    - Typ efield.  Set to '11' indicating overhead word.
         1  2
        ACT     - Global action field (see table below).
        BIS     - Busy-idle status field.
        DCC     - Digital Color Code.
        OHD     - Overhead Message type field.  Set to '100' indicating the
                  global action message.
        REGINCR - Registration increment field.
        NEWACC  - News access channel starting point field.
        MAXBUSY - Maximum busy occurrences field (page response).
        - PGR
        MAXBUSY - Maximum busy occurences field (other accesses).
        - OTHER
        MAXSZTR - Maximum seizure tries field (page response).
        - PRG
        MAXSZTR - Maximum seizure tries field (other accesses).
        - OTHER
        OLCN    - Overload class field (N = 0 to 15)
        END     - End indication field.  Set to '1' to indicate the last word
                  of the overhead message train; set to '0' if not last word.
        RSVD    - Reserved for future use, all bits must be set as indicated.
        LOCAL   - May be set to any bit pattern.
        CONTROL
        P       - Parity field.


        The registration ID message consits of one word.  When sent, the
        message must be appended to a system parameter overhead message in
        addition to any global action messages.

        T  T    - Type field.  Set to '11' indicating overhead word.
         1  2
        DCC     - Digital color code field.
        OHD     - Overhead message type field.  Set to '000' indicating the
                  registration ID message.
        REGID   - Registration ID field.
        END     - End indication field.  Set to '1' to indicate last word of
                  the overhead message train;  set to '0' if not.
        P       - Parity field.


        The control-filler message consists of one word.  It is sent whenever
        there is no other message to be sent on the forward control channel.
        It may be inserted between messages as well as between word blocks of
        a mulitword message.  The control-filler message is chosen so that
        when it is sent, the 11-bit word sequence will not appear in the
        message stream, independent of the busy-idle bit status.

        The control-filler message is also used to specify a control mobile
        attenuation code (CMAC) for use by mobile stations accessing the
        system on the reverse control channel, and a wait-for-overhead-
        message bit (WFOM) indicating whether or not mobile staions must
        read an overhead message train before accessing the system.

        Data Restrictions

        The 11-bit sequence (11100010010) is shorter than the length of a
        word, and therefore can be embedded in a word.  Normally, embedded
        word-sync will not cause a problem because the next word sent will not
        have the word-sync sequence embedded in it.  There are, however, three
        cases in which the word-sync sequence may appear periodically in the
        FOCC stream.  They are as follows:

                o the overhead message
                o the control-filler message
                o Mobile station control messages with pages to mobile stations
                  with certain central office codes.

        These three cases are handled by:

                1. Restricting the overhead message transmission rate to about
                   once per second
                2. designing the control-filler message to exclude the word-
                   sync sequence, taking into account the various busy-idle
                   bits
                3. Restricting the use of certian office codes


        If the mobile station control message is examined with the MIN1
        separated into NXX-X-XXX as described earlier (where NXX is the
        central office code, N represents a number from 2 - 9, and X
        represents a number from 0-9) the order and order qualifications
        table can be used to deduce when the word-sync word would be sent.
        If a number of mobile stations are paged consecutively with the same
        central office code, mobile stations that are attempting to synchronize
        to the data stream may not be able to doso because of the presence of
        the false word sync sequence.  Therefore, the combinations of central
        office codes and groups of line numbers appearing in the following
        table must not be used for mobile stations.

        1. In each case, Z represents a bit that may be 1 or 0.
        2. Some codes are not used as central office codes in the US at this
           time.  They are included for completeness.
        3. The bit in parentheses is the busy-idle bit.


        Well there is your signaling in a nutshell.  Please note I hardly have
        the most up-to-date signalling data.  Basically what was presented
        here was a skeleton, the bare bones without all the additions.  There
        are some additions that are system specific.  As I get updates I'll be
        sure to share them with the rest of you.  I would be interested in
        any feedback, so, if you have something to say, send it to:

        In the last article I said that there would be a listing of SID codes
        accompanying the article.  Well, I forgot to edit that line out, but
        if you would like a copy of it, just mail me at the above address an
        you shall receive one.

        In the next article I will be going indepth on the actual hardware
        behind the Mobile telephone, the chip sets, and its operation.
        I will also publish any updates to the previous material I find, as
        well as information on the transitory NAMPS system that will be used
        to bridge the existing AMPS cellular network over to the ISDN
        compatible fully digital network.


            Yet another...
