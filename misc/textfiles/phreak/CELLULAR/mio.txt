The Cheese box is first.  Seems like the Phreaker world has struck.  We now 
have three definitions of cheese boxes, all of which are correct.  But each 
one does a differnt thing.  Theres the untracable ending cheese box, like
Slipped Disk mentioned.  Used by organized crime, Mafia and so on.  There is
the one that MyTH mentioned, which I forget what he said.  And there is the
one I mentioned which makes your normal phone into a pay phone.  Making it
accept a red boxes coin tones.  So, we have a lot of these defintions all
wrapped up.  Don't worry, just throw all this away, and forget about it.

Digital Logic, nice to see you here again!

About the antennas Digital, what about a small perabolic dish, one about the
size of a garbage can lid?  That round, but of course, you can't use one!
That could serve as a good antenna, accepting all radio waves to be focused
on the interceptor?.

Cellular Car Phones II.

MyTH, I'm not saying "Steal it" or even "Card it", I'm saying "Fraud it!".
You should know how to do that man!  Hell call them up, start bitching to 
them, and soon enough, if you do it right, you'll get it!  I've written a
file along with some input from Digital Logic on fraud, so that explains it
all!  A cellular car phone should be easy to pull, let me thik up a way to
make it look better, and I'll post it all here.

Ok, now onto the phones, lets digress some more here...

As I said before, the Cellular car phone companies, who have set up a 
small system for you can either be AT&T, some huge telco like Western Union,
or ITT, or a small investment company.  These are called RCC, the small 
companies, who have a service over a small area of "Cells", RCC stands for
Radio Common Carrier.  RCC is like a INWAT operation, in a way.  As in the
800 systems, INWAT, and OUTWAT, these companies get a bill, for a lower fee
then normal, dependent upon sertain things, like stock, or even Easy Access
which will be around very soon, and only exists in Southern California.
So the RCC gets a bill, then thats charged to the mobile phone subscribers, 
then plus a bill for the service, or how much they want to rip them off for.

Now, I'll describe how a call is oriented, and how the phone answers, and the
systems involved between these.  Maybe a little "K-K00L TEXT-GRAFIX" is in 
stake here...  Let see how good I/O is at art..  The system is set up like 
this.... Hope you have 80 columns!

Not bad!  What an awesome artist!  Stick with me here...

Now, the switching between the Central Office-Switching Network-Switching 
Network-Central Office, is pretty basic.

Like if I were to dial (609)-921-1994, from (609)-452-0001, I would switch
from my central office [452] to the 921 central office.  A local call.  Then
of course the rest of the phone, 1994, and so on.

Problem number one:
  How do you dial the damn car out there?  Dial like normal!  It's all set,
the Base Station has a computer, which has a normal 452-xxxx in it, where the
xxxx would be that car.  Now each base antenna as I mentioned earlier has 60 
bands it can operate on, untill newer modles come out, I'll deal with that
as well later in the week.  So what happens is the Base Station's computer
will process your number dialed, then it has a number for each subscriber
within it's cell.  Now these signals are seven digits long, it's pretty much
standard for now.  So thats how the Cellular phone is signaled that it's
being dialed.

How do they know which one?  How does it work when signaling?  Next time
folks.  And this is all going into a file that will be out, and will have it
all organized.

MyTH, anything you want me to focus on that you want to know, or should I just
move on?
