NOTES:  These are single NAM units that have user programmable MIN & SIDH,
        See below for user instructions.
        The ESN prefix is 138 decimal, 8A hex (Toshiba)
        These units have an excessive number of "security" features,
        You MUST know the lock code or the "reprograming" code and you
        may also need an "activation" code.  Take care not to program
        these options unless you're sure the numbers will not be mislaid.
        There is a "back door" for the PT 300 portable, see end.

NAM programing:

1.  With the power turned on enter N N N FUNC # 1, where NNN is the three
    digit lock code.  The manufacturers default is 000.  If a reprograming
    code has been entered in step 26 (see below) this code must be used in
    place of the three digit lock code.  If "CODE ?" appears when the phone
    is powered up then you must enter the 7 digit "Activation Code" before
    entering programing mode, (see step 30).

2.  The # key increments the step number.

3.  The * key decrements the step number.

4.  STO enters the data for each step.

5.  You MAY directly access any step by pressing RCL followed by the step
    number.

6.  FUNC SND completes programing.

7.  FUNC CLR exits programing mode.

FCN 0 3 = NON PREFERRED ONLY,


USER PROGRAMING OF MIN & SIDH

Press CLR followed by the new five digit SIDH and ten digit MIN.
Press FUNC 6.  The new MIN will be displayed, hold 6 to display the SIDH.


"BACK DOOR" FOR PT-300

1.  Remove the battery.
2.  Remove the small black square access plate at the lower left of the
    phone.
3.  Place a 10k resistor between pins 4 and 5.
    (Pin 5 is top right, pin 4 is center bottom)
4.  Replace battery, power up phone and enter 0 0 0 FUNC # 1.

LOCK: Press LOCK. UNLOCK: Enter three digit code.

SYSTEM SELECT: F 0 4 shows current mode.  F 0 0 = Pref/Non pref, F 0 1 = Pref
only, F 0 2 = Home Only, F 0 3 = Non pref only.
