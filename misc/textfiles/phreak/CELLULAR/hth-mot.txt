                     MOTOROLA RE-PROGRAMMING FOR ALL
                        OF THE MOTOROLA PHONES!
                        Written By The Punisher


 Ok well it seems that everyone jumped on the scene to get our Motorola 
 Software but we were not finished! Actually we did not release the 
 instructions for it. No matter what you tried if you were trying to do 
 a new model phone you got fucked! Anyway Here's what you did'nt know you
 had to do:

  In order to do the newer Motorola flip, Microtac and Lite phones you will
  need the Software that we've let out, and the special 'trick clip', this
  process requires you to open the phone. Since that's a pain in the ass
  look for updates that will let you do it with out opening up the phone.
  Anyway When you open the phone you will find the 27C512 chip. This chip
  is the shit that you'll be getting ready to alter. This chip is sometimes
  blacked out to prevent identifying it. Now you'll need to either do one or
  both of the following in order to get this stuff started: 
   You can order the clip from HTH Technologies for $285
   or you can build it fromthe instructions that will soon follow you can
   order the parts from HTH Technologies or anybody else that will have them.

   To build this 'trick clip' order the IC TEST CLIP #50F1528, Type 5733
   I think Digikey also sells them but if you ordered crystals from them
   then you know there bullshit with backorder.

  Attach the 213 Series Chip Carrier Socket. Use the diagram 2 to jumper 
  the pins correctly.

  Place an M27C512 - 15XC1 PROM in the socket that has been programmed with
  the Motorola.BIN software that could be found on the New York Hack Exchange
  BBS or any good H/P BBS.

  When programming the phone you'll still keep the cables the same and have
  the clip hooked onto the prom.

     Pin 5 (on the Quad clip) is not connected to the top chip holder.
     It is jumpered to PIN 30. Pin 5 on the chip holder is jumpered to
     Pin 7 on the chip holder.
