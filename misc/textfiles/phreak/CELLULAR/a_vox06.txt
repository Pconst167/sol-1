AUDIOVOX CTX 3200, 3200M, 4200

NOTES:  These are single NAM units.
        The ESN prefix is 138 decimal, 8A hex (Toshiba)
        This unit has an excessive number of "security" features,
        You MUST know the lock code or the "reprograming" code and you
        may also need an "activation" code.  Take care not to program
        these options unless you're sure the numbers will not be mislaid.
        Audiovox: 516-231-6051/213-926-7758

NAM programing:

1.  With the power turned on enter N N N FUNC # 1, where NNN is the three
    digit lock code.  The manufacturers default is 000.  If a reprograming
    code has been entered in step 41 (see below) this code must be used in
    place of the three digit lock code.  If "CODE ?" appears when the phone
    is powered up then you must enter the 7 digit "Activation Code" before
    entering programing mode, (see step 45).

2.  The # key increments the step number.

3.  The * key decrements the step number.

4.  STO enters the data for each step.

5.  You MAY directly access any step by pressing RCL followed by the step
    number.

6.  FUNC SND completes programing.

7.  FUNC CLR exits programing mode.
