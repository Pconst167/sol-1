<H1>Phone Phreaking: Cellular Telephony</H1>
<P>
When portable (cellular) telephones became generally available, they had a deadly
combination: they were absolutely useful, and they were amazingly expensive. The power
of being able to reach into your pocket and call anyone in the world was perhaps
the perfect holy grail to young phreaks looking for the next big thing. Since cellular
telephones are simply technology with broadcasting ability, it was just a matter of
time before the wave of curiousity that has always driven phreaking would turn towards
this new horizon. In the early 90's, it truly exploded, but there are traces of interest
in the late 80's, and the battle rages on.
