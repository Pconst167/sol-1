
PART II.                      DEFINITIONS


The following is a list of commonly used abbreviations used in cellular
phones.

SIDH

A 15-bit field in the NAM designating the System Identification for the Home
System.  Bit 0 of the SIDH corresponds to the Preferred System flag used
elsewhere in the NAM.  Bits 6 and 5 of byte 0 are international code bits.
Normally the SIDH is entered during programming of the phone as a 5 digit
decimal number.  Enter 0's to the left-most unused positions when 
reprogramming.

L.U.

Local Use Flag.  Tells the cellular phone user if it must preregister with
the system.  Preregistration with the system means that a mobile must 
transmit its parameters to the Cellular System as soon as the power-up
task and the control channel tasks are completed. "1" enables the flag.
Usually set to "1".

MIN MARK

A 1-bit flag designating that MIN2 (area code) is always sent when making
system access.  "1" enables the flag.  Usually set to "1".

MIN2

A 10-bit field representing the area code of the mobile ID number.

MIN1

A 24-bit field representing the mobile telephone number.  MIN2 plus MIN1
equals MIN, the 10-digit phone number.

SCM

A 4-bit field designating the Station Class Mark. A (3-Watt) 832 channel
mobile unit typically will be 1000, a 1.2 Watt portable 1001 or a 0.6 Watt
handheld 1010 or 1110 (discontinuous transmission, meaning push-to-talk).
These are class I, Class II and Class III power levels respectively.
With the SCM the cellular system determines whether or not a cellular phone
can be switched to one of the 156 channels.
        Bit-1 is "0" for 666 and "1" for 832. (See cellular freq. list)
        Bit-2 is "0" for a mobile unit and "1" for a voice-activated 
          transmit.
        Bit-3 and -4 identify the power class of the phone: 
                "00" = 3.0 watts
                "01" = 1.2 watts
                "10" = 0.6 watts
                "11" is not assigned

IPCH

An 11-bit field designating the initial paging channel to be used if in
the home system.  Normally it is 334 for wireline systems, 333 for non-
wireline systems.  But most phones allow other settings for test purposes.

ACCOLC

A 4-bit field designating the overload class for the cellular phone.  The
intention of this entry is to allow the Cellular System to be able to 
determine priority in the event of a system overload, however it is currently
useless as the system operators have generally not provided guidance for
thier installers.  The usual (and correct) system now in effect (in U.S.) is
to use a "0" plus the last digit of the phone number.  Test phones should be
set at "10",emergency vehicles at "11","12" through "15" are reserved.
(A class 15 system is supposed to be police, fire, or military).
P.S.

1 1-bit flag designating the preferred system.  If PS is "0", channels 334
through 666(EVIL!!!) are used.  If PS is "1" then channels 1 through 333 are
used.  Even numbered system numbers (B systems) require a PS of "0", odd
system numbers (A systems) require a "1".

GIM

A 4-bit field designating the Group Identification Mark.  This number tells
the Cellular system how far to look in the SIDH to determine if it is roaming
in a system which may have a roam agreement with the phone system.  It is
usually set to "10".

LOCK DIGITS

A 4-bit field designating the unlock code.  The digit "0" in the lock code
is represented by an "A" in the actual NAM hexidecimal data.  A lock code of
all "0" sometimes unlocks the cellular phone.(Note: Lock codes are 3 digits.
When programming a phone use "0" as the first number.)

E.E.

A 1-bit flag designating that end-to-end signaling is enabled.  End-to-end
signaling means that the DTMF tones will be transmitted on the voice channel
as well as being echoed on the handset.  This feature in necessary for
such services as Bank by Phone, activating answering machines and in third
party long distance services such as Sprint and MCI. A "1" enables the flag.
Usually set to "1".

REP

A 1-bit flag designating that repertory memory (speed dialing) in the
cellular phone is enabled.  And once a again a "1" enables the flag.

H.A.

A 1-bit flag designating that the horn alert feature in enabled. "1" enables 
the flag.

H.F.

A 1-bit flag designating that the handsfree option is enabled. A "1" enables
the flag.  Often, transceivers supplied as hands-free units require that
this flag be left at "0".
