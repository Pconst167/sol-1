      -//-> The Citronic Cellular Suite :: NEC P3 Reprogramming <-\\-

In this package you will find the reprogramming software imaginatively 
titled 'P3.EXE'. This text file shows a diagram of the programming cable.

     2 x 1N4148 Diodes
     25-pin D-Plug
     Plug for P3's socket 
              
To get the plug for the phones 'up-the-bum' socket you will need to buy
the car saver. Simply cut the cigaretter lighter end off the cable and
keep the rest.

From the cigarette lighter end find the wires that correspond to the
correct pins on the P3 plug as per the diagram below and solder on to
the relevant pins of the D-plug. Don't forget to solder the diodes on  
the right way round. I would recommend putting a decent case around the
D-25 plug as they can undergo a good deal of stress with continuous use.

Once that is done, simply connect up the cable and fire up the software!
Enter the ESN you wish to program the phone with. Next you must enter the
phone number. (Note: You need to use the normal 0850 etc. prefixes not in
2342 format). The software currently does not accept the new 0585 Cellnet
prefixed numbers. However it will accept 0374 numbers. If you do need to
program one with an 0585 number, just enter a valid number, and change it 
with the handset by entering test mode. Lastly you can choose a 4-digit 
unlock code and then you are ready to program. Enter 'Y' at the "Reset and 
Initialise" prompt and your phone will be programmed up for you ready to go.
