AUDIOVOX CTX1500, 2500, 4000, 5000, BC410, 55, SP85, TRANS 410.

NOTES:  These are single NAM units.
        The ESN prefix is 138 decimal, 8A hex (Toshiba)
        You MUST know the lock code to program this unit, see below for
        "back door" programing methods.
        Audiovox: 516-231-6051/213-926-7758

NAM programing:

1.  With the power turned on enter N N N FUNC # 1, where NNN is the three
    digit lock code.  The manufacturers default is 000

2.  The # key increments the step number.

3.  The * key decrements the step number.

4.  STO enters the data for each step.

5.  You MAY directly access any step by pressing RCL followed by the step
    number.

6.  FUNC SND completes programming.

7.  FUNC CLR exits programming mode.

NOTES:

1.  This is an eight digit binary field.

    10000000 = CALL TIMER BEEP
    01000000 = AUTO LOCK
    00100000 = AUTO SYSTEM REDIAL
    00010000 = CALL RESTRICTION
    00001000 = 32 DIGIT DIALING CAPABILITY
    11111000 = ALL OF THE ABOVE


2.  As above but options are:

    10000000 = HANDS FREE
    01000000 = CONTINUOUS DTMF
    00100000 = REPERTORY DIALING
    00010000 = HORN ALERT
    00001000 = ALLOWS 911 CALLING WHEN UNIT IS LOCKED
    01101000 = ALL OF THE ABOVE


A/B SYSTEM SELECT:

FCN 0 4 DISPLAYS CURRENT MODE,
FCN 0 0 = PREFERRED/NON-PREFERRED,
FCN 0 1 = PREFERRED ONLY,
FCN 0 2 = HOME ONLY
FCN 0 3 = NON PREFERRED ONLY,

"BACK DOOR" PROCEDURES:

We cannot guarantee the accuracy of these procedures, USE CAUTION!

SP 85
The lock code can be reset to 000 be shorting pins 6 and 17 on the handset
control conector.

CTX SERIES
Short pins 6 an 17 on the data cable, turn power on and enter 000 FUNC # 1.

TRANS 55 AND BC 55
Ground pin 1 of the six pin connector next to the modular jack on the
tranceiver.  Looking at the tranciever with the modular jack to the right
of the six pin connector, pin one is bottom right.

LOCK: Press LOCK. UNLOCK: Enter three digit code.

SYSTEM SELECT: F 0 4 shows current mode.  F 0 0 = Pref/Non pref, F 0 1 = Pref
only, F 0 2 = Home Only, F 0 3 = Non pref only.
