Subj: DIALCOM ACCSS NUA AND SPRINTING
ok, someone asked, for some acces NUA's via TELENET and TYMNET, here is a short
list, but you may have to translate them. 0311030100241 SYSTEM 57 0311030100243
SYSTEM 52 031103010022 SYSTEM 50 0311030100224  SYSTEM 61 0311030100353  SYSTEM
53 0311030100355  SYSTEM 55 0311030100357  SYSTEM 57 0311030100359  SYSTEM 61 
0311030100361  SYSTEM 61 ETC ETC ETC, They are all called PRIMECON NETWORKS. I
only found one via TYMNET and the NUA is: 03106001572  system 50 ok, here are
some more to chew on: 05053200000 MINERVA  system 07 05053200002  Minerva
system 09 05053200050 Minerva system 08 there is one in ISRAEL called GOLDNET 
0425130000215  system whatever. and there are virtually thousands of DIALCOM
networks in the UK, some are: 023421920100472  BT-GOLD  SYSTEM 72 
023421920100473  BT-GOLD  SYSTEM 73 REST FOLLOW THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN.

I THINK the best thing you could do, is try sprinting them or register on one
system to get some inside info.  If you're interested, the password format is 
ABCxxx  and at the '>' prompt you would type: ID ABC001 PASSWORD for example,
the account names range from  AA001 to ZZZ001  (they are the high lev ones, the
rest are AAA002 and higher,  it is rare though to get more then 5 accounts in
the same series. THEy don't usually go over AAA005, but on  systems belonging
to large companies they may reach to a thousand and beyond. OK, hope that
helps...Oh one other thing to bare in mind,  call made via TELENET, DIALCOM,
OUTDIAL to a outside system, is virtually untraceable. Catch Ya Later
