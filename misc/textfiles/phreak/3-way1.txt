Step by Step:

   1] You will need two different lines for this. Okay first take
      off both of the boxes covering the wires.

   2] Take the green and red from each box and attach a wire to
      each of these. One wire to green one wire to red same on the other
      box.

   3] After you have 4 wires (2 for each box). Then get a two way switch 
      with two terminals. Then hook the two green wires to one side and 
      the red wire two the other side. Then when you switch the switch 
      you should here a dial tone and then just dial out and you will be 
      able to talk to two people at one time.
