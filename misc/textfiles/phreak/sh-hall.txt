        Once Again, The mass-market Consumer electronics industry has sucseeded
     To bring down the cost of sophisticated technology to ridiculous levels.
     Hallmark. inc has teamed up with Isd, inc.,to produce the talking
     greating card.

        For a mere $7.95. you can buy a completely assembled digital audio
     recording device (complete with speaker and microphone) Built into a
     greeting card.  The idea is to record a 10 second message and mail it to
     a person of your choice.  It could be a death message or a thankyou message
     It dont matter.

        If you take the card apart you will find a plastic and cardboard frame
     containing a 1" square circut board, four 1.5 volt watch batteries
     2 switches and a piezoelectric microphone and decent 1.5" 16-ohm
     speaker.

        My Hacker friends and I have removed these modules and conceled them in
     all kinds of unlikely containers, Zippos, Dental floss dispencer, Even
     a coat or shirt collar.  The voice-band fidelity is quite good, and it
     is excellent to record(and play back) ACTS coin-deposits,  sprint
     voice foncards, call progress tones, telco recordings etc.

        Thank You Hallmark, for "caring  enough to send the very
        best" in a cheap accesible, and readily hackable device!

                            .! HAVE PHUN!.
                            .!PHREAK OUT!.
