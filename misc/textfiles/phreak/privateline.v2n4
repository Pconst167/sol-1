The Second Year; A Price Increase?; Def Con III

Welcome to the July/August edition. private line is now a year 
old. Things are looking up. Reader submitted articles and letters 
are coming in and I am grateful for this. It takes pressure off me 
to write every single word in every single issue. And it makes the 
magazine more informative. This issue contains quite a bit of 
information that did not originate with me: reader letters, a 
subscriber written product review and a transcript of a speech 
given by an expert on debit cards by an industry expert. Please 
know that your contributions are always welcome and that article 
writers get free subscriptions. The deadline for the 
September/October issue is August 8th and October 8th for the 
November/December. Try to get your submissions in well before dead 
line.

The last year has been very instructive for me, in particular, the 
last 6 months since newsstand distribution began with the 
January/February issue. I had less than 12 subscribers at that 
point and I was very nervous about printing up 750 copies. What 
would happen? I could envision UPS trucks heading back to 
Carmichael, filled to top with returned issues of private line. 
And especially since Number 4 was on patents. A good issue, I 
thought, but a bit dry. Who would buy it? 600 went to the magazine 
racks. The first feedback came from the Tower chain. They sold 97 
of the l 00 copies I had sent them. 85% of the total news copies 
eventually sold. And all the extras that I had sold as well, in 
fact, I've been forced to make up a photocopy version to sell as a 
back issue. That patent issue found a home.

I'm now up to 102 subscribers with a newsstand circulation of 
around l,000 copies. Current press run is 1,500. Newsstand copies, 
back issue orders and subscriptions now equal the cost of 
printing. This is good. So why the price increase? People liked 
the increased page count last issue. So I'm staying with it. 
Adding four pages, though, increases costs about 14%. Printing 
costs go down as the number of copies produced goes up. But 
increasing page count always drives the cost of each copy up. The 
cover price has been now been increased by 12% to $4.50. Subs are 
now $27.00. (Existing subscribers, however, will be allowed to 
subscribe at the old rate for as long as they wish.) This increase 
keeps me somewhat even, while I wait for bigger press runs that 
will bring down per unit costs. I had hoped that advertising could 
cover the costs of printing and not sales. Three or four pages of 
the magazine could go into ads and that would pay the printing 
bills. Sales would cover the other costs of production. But that's 
not realistic for a number of reasons.

	This current issue cost about $1800 to print. That's for 1500 
copies. I'd need to charge $450 a page for four pages to cover 
that. What advertiser would want that? You can buy a lot of ads in 
Nuts and Volts for that price and reach 80,000 plus instead. 
Besides, Nuts and Volts is set up for that sort of thing and they 
do it well. I don't have enough time to write, let alone sell ad 
space. So, the cover price will have to do more. I'll still 
welcome any electronic related advertiser but I won't bother 
looking for them right now. By the way, subscribers still get free 
classifieds of 25 words or less. And ad rates are still $100 for a 
full page, $50 for a half and $25 for a quarter. In addition, only 
CONSUMERTRONICS pays me any money -- the other ads are favors or 
bartered. Like Damien's ad. He answers my questions from time to 
time so I run his ad. Dark Tangent has a cool convention so I run 
an ad for him. DT didn't even know that I placed an ad for him  
last issue. I just went ahead and did it. This is the way that a 
lot of 'zines work.

	Speaking of how things work, let me explain how distribution 
and subscriptions work for a little magazine. Let's start with the 
big picture. National distribution costs. A national distributor 
like Fine Print, Desert Moon or the Tower chain take from 50% to 
60% of a magazine's cover price. The printer takes $1.20. Distro 
takes about $2.47. Leaves me with 83 cents for each copy sold. 15% 
to 20% of the newsstand copies aren't sold. You don't get returns 
anymore so you have to eat the printing and shipping costs on 
those. Newsstand circulation is about 950 this issue. Do the math. 
Remember, too, that the 83 cents I get is before expenses.

	Subscription copies are different. No middleman to pay except 
for the post office. $1.20 a copy to print and $1.01 to mail. This 
is one reason, by the way, that the magazine can't get much bigger 
-- the weight will push the postage up to $1.23 if I add another 
four pages. In any case, this leaves me with $2.29 before expenses 
on the 100 or so subscribers that I have. Money from subs goes to 
paying the printer. There is no float or reserve or interest 
accrued from these subscriptions. In fact, I was recently owed 
$1700 by a major distributor. They did not pay me a dime for over 
six months. I can't get interest on that either. Money goes out as 
soon as it comes in.
	 I have nothing to apologize for by increasing the price. 
Just wanted to explain. This magazine is about the honest exchange 
of information. It should begin with me. Let me know if you are 
interested in the back issues and I will price all that out. The 
bottom line? I am very happy with what I am doing and the response 
to the magazine has been very good. Breaking even on printing is a 
good first step. The magazine is growing more slowly than I wanted 
but I can work with that. What are the plans for the future? I'd 
like to have a BBS that connects to the Internet. I'd post the 
text of all the back issues as well as all the strange files I 
find that I can't put in the magazines. Like FCC and patent files. 
I'd ideally like to scan in all the articles and product 
information I reference so that you could read further without 
driving 60 miles to find, say, the Bell Laboratories Record.

II LETTERS

Dear private line:

   Just received my first issue of private line. Nice little 
publication you have there. I think I shall be enjoying it very 
much in the months ahead. A few comments, if I may. They regard 
the note about the step by-step switch on page 44 of issue number 
5. Rather than being "the" step-by-step switch, there are also 
connectors, frequency selecting connectors, reverting call 
connectors and toll selectors; the mechanical structure below the 
relays being the common denominator construction. Actually the 
switch shown is a line finder as evidenced by the single 
horizontal wiper just below the ticket tag and the tenth level 
overrun spring assembly in front of the A and C relays. Depending 
on sub scriber activity, 10 to 20 line finders are mounted on a 
"shelf". The shelf, along with other "shelves" are mounted on a 
"bay" or common hardware framework which is 72" wide. The shelf is 
actually the "bank" multiples at the bottom of the switch (they 
don't show well in the photo) and the wiring. This is all factory 
pre-wired and shipped as a unit. It is not unusual to see bays 
with partially equipped shelves which allow for lower initial 
capital investment and facilities to accommodate increased future 
traffic activity. The can cover at the left of the photo contains 
supervisory relays used for assigning the next finder to answer a 
call for dial tone.

   An interesting feature to me over the years has been that each 
type of switching system (machine) has had its own distinct 
characteristic sound signature. In a small rural office step-by-
step is characterized by intermittent bursts of staccato reports, 
20 or more per second if line finders, several groups of 10 per 
second as a call is dialed through, followed by silence broken 
only by soft pulsing of interrupter relays and occasional clicking 
of manually operated toll ringing relays as an operator in the 
toll switchboard works a call. It also is interesting to listen to 
call activity. There will be silence broken by switching of a 
call. This invites a second call which immediately begets a third 
call, followed by silence again. And so it goes, sporadic 
outbursts followed by silence.

   A crossbar office on the other hand is a different experience. 
Listening to a working crossbar office is like being shaken up 
inside a can of loose bolts. It actually can be deafening, 
especially in the vicinity of the sender groups or the markers. 
The crossbar aisles are less noisy, punctuated occasionally by 
operation of trunk block connector relays at bay tops and 
occasional soft "tink" sounds as cross-points release. However, 
the granddaddy of all bedlam was created by a room full of 
mechanical foreign area card translators, especially on Mothers' 
Day! And a very different sound was heard by those privileged to 
witness call-through tests of a No.4 Toll Crossbar machine. These 
were tests performed by the installation departments on completion 
of wiring a machine and prior to turning it over to the operating 
company. Every number that could ever possibly be placed in the 
machine was called using groups of call test "tea wagons". Any 
call that failed to complete properly was traced out and corrected 
immediately. Each tea wagon would present twenty simultaneous 
calls to the senders. The re lay activity through the office, a 
city block square in size, had a never to-be-forgotten sound that 
was like an echo as trunk block relays operated in sequence 
trailing away to more distant link frame aisles. There would be 
silence while the tea wagons did their thinking. Then every call 
would be simultaneously dropped with a gigantic "thud" and then 
the whole sequence would repeat.

   My favorite switching machine sound however was the panel 
office. If ever there was a machine with (if it can be called 
that), a "comfortable" sound, it was a panel office. To me, a 
panel machine was a collection of simply delightful "clinking", 
"whirring" and "squeak, squeak, squeak" noises. It was by far, the 
quietest of all the machines. The only noisy areas, like crossbar, 
were those near sender, marker and decoder bays. Unfortunately, 
today's generation of central office technicians have never had 
the privilege of hearing these old machines doing their thing. 
It's a part of the art that has come and gone. I'm glad I was 
privileged to have heard them.

   With reference to your "Lost In Space" column, attached is a 
recent copy of the Bell Labs News. In it are phone numbers and 
points of contact. Hope it is of some help to you. On the back 
cover you show views of the old "500 Sub Set". Mr. Bill Brander, a 
retired close friend who lives not too far from here, did the 
first die drawings for the 500 model when he worked at BTL in 
Murray Hill NJ.

John W. Sponsler Hampton, NH

   Thank you for the informative letter. I've added a few 
illustrations and comments; I hope my explanation of a card 
translator is accurate enough.

(Sidebars)

(The hardcopy magazine contains illustrations of both a card 
translator and a tea wagon. The text of their captions are
as follows:

What is a Card Translator?

Large machines called card translators helped route long distance 
calls before computer assisted switching. They were very complex 
internally. Punch card technology was used, somewhat analogous to 
a loom. Steel cards were covered with 118 holes, each enlarged a 
certain amount to represent different area codes and prefixes. 
Cards with foreign country codes contained the most information. 
One translator mechanism might hold 1200 cards in a single stack. 
A particular card was selected by shooting a light beam through 
the stack and then lifting and dropping the cards with solenoids. 
Read more by looking up 'Operation of the Card Translator" in the 
March, 1955 Bell Laboratories Record.

Tea wagons are portable test equipment mounted on two wheels like 
the one shown above. They are used in switching offices. Very old 
models were made of wood and all tea wagons are specific to the 
switch they service. The one above was used to test a No. 4 toll 
cross bar.)

Dear private line,

   Thank you for promptly mailing me my sample issue of private 
line. I Number 51 Your cellular article gave me some lucid 
insights into the system; as a novice to this technology, I was 
waiting for such an article for a long time. Being originally from 
Germany, the debit card article was in some ways interesting as 
well. In the latest issue of 2600 you can find an article on 
European debit cards that was reprinted from an older issue of 
Hack-Tic. As you can clearly see, this system is close to being 
utterly defeated the weak point of an EEPROM chip-based debit card 
system is emulating the card with a little homemade device hooked 
up to a notebook computer. In Germany, this was and is impossible 
because the payphone completely swallows the card while you are 
using the phone (ATM-style) Even running thin wires through the 
steel latch does not work; if it does not completely close the 
phone does not recognize the card (just thought you'd like to 
know) I say-bring 'em on! We'll be well able to put the experience 
we gained in Europe to work and try to emulate their measly cards 
! Warm up the notebook and the soldering iron, I am sure we're 
going to see some interesting stuff right here in the US shortly-
as greed drives the telcos to new inventions, we shouldn't lag be 
hind.

   However, did you notice that the address and 800 numbers for 
both Public Communications and TeleCard World, as printed in the 
back of number 5 are completely identical? I'll give it a shot and 
see if I can parasite a sample copy for both publications out of 
them. Overall I am impressed with private line; it is not as 
novice as 2600 and Factsheet 5 made it look like. IMHO, it's a 
magazine for phreaks. For me being a phreak by definition, this is 
what I was waiting for. You'll see my order for a subscription and 
back issues shortly. Keep up the good work!

   Onkel Dittmeyer onkeld@planet.net

   My readers are certainly a creative lot. I also worry about 
them. Mr. Dittmeyer further informs me that he is interested in 
the "exploration of switching systems, digital switches 
themselves, PBX's and their de faults/backdoors, and programming 
phreaking tools for the PC using Turbo Pascal, Assembler and C++. 
" His program, 'BlueBEEP' is a blueboxing tool that he has made 
available to the H/P community as public domain. (Now you know who 
to thank.) The 1-800 number is indeed the same as both 
publications are published by Multimedia. A free sub to Public 
Communications is easy to get, however, a free one for TeleCard 
World is not. I think they make most of their money from that 
magazine. Sub scribe to Premier Telecard instead. It's worth $30 a 
year if cards are your interest. I explore some of the chip card 
possibilities Mr. Dittmeyer mentions on page 94.

Dear private line,

Your article on digital cellular was a good attempt at a high 
level summary. Your carousel analogy is interesting. I would like 
to see you ex tend it to Digital Speech Interpolation! However, 
there are a few corrections and additions. I would like to point 
out:

   1. All TDMA phones can handle AMPS calls as well, not 'most'. 
TDMA phones used for PCS ( 1.8-2.2 GHz) will not support analog, 
and eventually some cellular TDMA phones may also be digital only.

   2. E-TDMA has been trialed in Mobile, but is not in commercial 
service. One other form of TDMA, that you allude to, is half-rate 
coding (e.g. each of the six slots assigned to only one call, not 
two slots as occurs with basic full-rate TDMA). E-TDMA gets about 
a 10 times capacity increase due to a combination of half-rate 
coding and digital speech interpolation. The reason why these 
systems are not in commercial service is because most systems 
don't need the capacity right now, and the reduced bandwidth 
assigned to each conversation reduces voice quality. Improved 
voice coding technology is expected to allow these systems to be 
used commercially in a few years.

   3. Digital Speech Interpolation (DSI) has nothing to do with 
signal level, at least not in E-TDMA. You would be assigned a time 
slot in either or both directions as long as there was voice to 
transmit at all signal strengths.

   4. I do not know of any CDMA digital systems that are in 
commercial service. There may be some confusion in Los Angeles 
because one of the carriers is a joint venture between McCaw (a 
TDMA proponent) and AirTouch (a CDMA proponent). Their system is 
TDMA, however.

Regards,

   David Crowe, Cellular Networking Perspectives
   71574.3157@compuserve.com ( 1-800-633-5514)

   DSI or digital speech interpolation is a specialized form of 
multiplexing. All conversations on all channels get digitized. 
Just like TDMA or T-I. Half of your conversation, though, may be 
spent in silence as you listen and pause to speak. Your voice 
channel is still open, though, and still carrying data. Just not 
very much. DSI fills in those silent periods with the conversation 
of someone else. T-l and normal TDMA, by comparison, are 
multiplexing schemes that assign each call a discrete, non-
volatile channel. DSI increases system capacity by maximizing the 
use of each channel. Speech may sound clipped as a result. It's 
not good for sending data. The analog predecessor of DSI was TASI: 
Time Assigned Speech Interpolation, developed back in the 1950's. 
It was used for trunks with a small number of circuits. Like cable 
undersea between California and Hawaii. It's probably still being 
used in some places.

   That digital article was tough. It's difficult explaining a 
subject to others when I am not completely sure of the topic 
myself. Every non technical writer, though, faces this same 
problem in explaining technology. I just hope that people can 
learn as they go along and as each issue comes out. I'm convinced 
that discussing an issue, even if it means going back and forth, 
will result in a better grasp of the subject for those who do 
follow it.
      
 Dear private line,
	I thought you might want a photostatic copy of the famous 
(infamous) cover of the Boston Phone Book. A friend of mine sent 
it to me; I can not believe almost 20 years have past. The phone 
book was quickly recalled. I heard, but I have no facts, that  the 
artist was taken to court by Ma Bell but that Ma Bell lost the 
case. Turn the picture right and left.

Decorum and printing limitations prohibit Your Editor from 
publishing the cover of the 1977-1978 North Boston Phone Book,  
however, Mr. Onraet has agreed to send you a copy for three 
dollars. Makes a nice conversation piece. 

Dear private line,
	Great magazine! I picked up my first sample at a bookstore 
here in Cleveland. A section that would be interesting is one that 
covers schematics for telephones, old supply catalogs from Western 
Electric North Electric, Stromberg, Automatic Electric, etc. I 
have several that I use to repair phones with but no one has a 
complete selection. Thank you for your time and attention.
Charles Augustine
Cleveland, Ohio
	Thank you for the subscription and the suggestion. I can 
easily incorporate schematics within the context of a telephone 
repair column. See page 111 for the start of this feature. I know 
of no one who has a complete selection -- joining the Antique 
Telephone Collector's Association seems to be the best bet at this 
point. Their newsletter will point to dozens of resources.  Anyone 
up to publishing a book of schematics?

Best Message Left on The Answering Machine:

   "Hey, Tom, this is Chris Thornton. When I sent you my fax [His 
letter on page 62 in No.6] I didn't realize that the system would 
send you all capital letters like I was shouting at you -- I 
didn't mean it that way.

   Damien Thorn was talking about The Source, well, there's a bio-
computer at UC Berkeley that handles security for the government 
out that way. It's quite interesting. It supposed to be half human 
and halt bio-chemical, that's what I understand. Sounds like it 
threw a fit tantrum in Oklahoma. That's just a comeback to tell 
you to check it out. They're using their people to cover it up 
with that Tim McVeigh dude. You all have a good one and take care 
of your self."

Dear Eric:

   No consciousness raising going on here, unless you mean arming 
yourself intellectually against the dreaded telco. That's 
something private line can help you with. Okay, okay, here's my 
stab at consciousness raising; this is now the official haiku of 
my 'zine -- created just for you:

Mobile Radio Technology
A monthly magazine dedicated to non-cellular radio communication 
technologies including paging, SMR, 2 way, etc. The magazine has 
very good technical coverage of these "traditional" radio 
industries. Includes a lot of coverage of RF issues such as 
antenna interference, simulcast systems, pager internals, bandpass 
filters, cavities, splitters, etc. Oriented to the radio 
technician and service folk, so explains a lot of the RF issues 
without excessive math found in some microwave and RF design 
magazines. May be useful for the ham operator, but does not cover  
ham products or frequencies. Also only covers US radio.

A bi-monthly magazine for ROLM customers produced by ROLM/Siemens. 
Definitely not a technical magazine. This marketing magazine 
covers ROLM success stories and introduces new ROLM products and 
technologies to their customer base. Worthwhile if you are 
following the PBX vendors in terms of the new product directions 
they are rolling out, or you are working on competing or 
cooperating telephony products. Since this is a corporate 
magazine, you obtain it by contacting your ROLM  sales rep, 
finding a copy and filling out a subscription card. ROLM can be

Premier Telecard Magazine
"The first U.S. Telecard Magazine." A beautiful publication. I 
think it caters more to the collector than to the corporate user, 
however, it does cover every aspect of the telecard world. They're 
nice people, too.

Telecoms Heritage Journal
Magazine of the Telecoms Heritage Group (UK), once or twice a 
year.  48 or 96 pages. Members also receive an 8-page newsletter 
four times a year. "Mainly for telephone collectors and

research about telephone history and practice. 'Subscriber Loop 
Signaling Systems' by Graeme Marett  in Issue 24 , was to me, a 
better introduction to the UK angle than anything Welch ever 
wrote. That issue also had a history of UK telephone poles as well 
as at least 20 other interesting articles. Apply for membership or

Telecom History
The Journal of the Telephone History Institute. More great 
information on early telephony. Stanley Swihart's lead article in 
the first edition of Telecom History  (1994-1) is entitled 
'Earliest telephone service: The genesis and early development of 
telephone exchange service.' It is a monumental piece of research, 
worldwide in scope and running almost 90 full sized pages. With a 
complete bibliography. Amazing.

	I didn't have space in Number 6 to give you the text of the 
regulation prohibiting cloning. It was revised as of the first of 
the year and is now found in 47 C.F.R. Section 22.919 and not 
22.915. Anyway: 

"Section 22.91 9 Electronic Serial Numbers. 
The purpose of this new section is to deter cellular fraud by 
requiring that the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) unique to each 
cellular phone be factory set, inalterable, non-transferable, and 
otherwise tamper-proof and free of fraudulent manipulation in the 
field. This subject received substantial attention from commenters 
and is discussed in the Report and Order. 

22.91 9 Electronic Serial Numbers. 
The Electronic Serial Number (ESN) is a 32 bit binary number that 
uniquely identifies a cellular mobile transmitter to any cellular 
system. 
(a) Each mobile transmitter in service must have a unique ESN. 
   (b) The ESN host component must be permanently attached to a 
main circuit board of the mobile transmitter and the integrity of 
the unit's operating software must not be alterable. The ESN must 
be isolated from fraudulent contact and tampering. If the ESN host 
component does not contain other information, that component must 
not be removable, and its electrical connections must not be 
accessible. If the ESN host component contains other information, 
the ESN must be encoded using one or more of the following 
techniques: 
( I ) Multiplication or division by a polynomial; (2) Cyclic 
coding; (3) The spreading of ESN bits over various non sequential 
memory locations.
	(c) Cellular mobile equipment must be designed such that any 
attempt to remove, tamper with, or change the ESN chip, its logic 
system, or firmware originally programmed by the manufacturer will 
render the mobile transmitter inoperative. 
   (d) The ESN must be factory set and must not be alterable, 
transferable, removable or otherwise able to be manipulated in the 
field. Cellular equipment must be designed such that any attempt 
to remove, tamper with, or change the ESN chip, its logic system, 
or firmware originally programmed by the manufacturer will render 
the mobile transmitter inoperative. 
Questions concerning this Public Notice should be addressed to 
Steve Markendorff at 202-653-5560 or Andrew Nachby at 202-632-
6450." 
   The person who posted this to CompuServe is Robert Keller, 
P.C., Federal Telecommunications Law, 4200 Wisconsin Ave NW #106-
261, Washington, DC 20016-2143. Or rjk@telcomlaw.com. The entire 
file that he posted is very interesting as it contains the FCC's 
comments on extension phones and how the new rule relates to them.

	Altering an ESN to produce a clone is illegal, although some 
companies maintain that they have the right to effectively clone a 
phone through software. Less Buster mailed in an article on 
cellular extensions written by Patricia Staino in the May 
Teleconnect. I'll modify her example of "software cloning" a 
little by describing the following: a company has 10 salespeople 
with 10 phones and 10 ESNs but one phone number. The phones are 
all kept off. The company pages a per son when they want them to 
call the office for instructions. They only call in after getting 
beeped. The company saves on 9 monthly flat charges but still pays 
for all calls. You can read ads for these companies in the 
classifieds of Nuts and Volts. The CTIA contends that such phones 
are illegal but I 'm not sure they'll have much of a case with the 
current law. There have been a number of raids in the southwest 
lately, but they seem to deal with hardware based cloning. 
   Page 67 in the last issue was not my best writing. Too many 
errors. I redid that page and sent subscribers a copy. Send me an 
S.A.S.E. if you want the revised page. l had been doing my own 
proofreading be fore. Not good. Little Sheeba will now help me 
proof. And I will now delay each issue until I get the mistakes 
out, rather than obeying my deadline and leaving the mistakes in. 
In addition, the index was a bit of a mess. The next will be 
better. 
   Thought that the "Internet Bridge" column last issue was a bit 
irrelevant? The one that focused on Bell 829 Loopback Devices? 
There may be far more of these left in service than we suspect. I 
note that the current Jensen tool catalog features a tester called 
the "Brown Box", more specifically known as a Model 91 Analog Test 
Set. It does channel measurements of "any 2 or 4 wire voice grade 
telephone line" and it can "activate Bell Telephone remote 
loopback equipment." The Jensen catalogs are always nice. Call 
(602) 968-6231 to get one. 
    I talked about PINs in the last issue but I said that I didn't 
know how they got delivered as hookflash. David Crowe says that 
IS-53 de scribes the actual process. The practice for the customer 
seems very cumbersome. NYNEX requires that you 1) dial your 
number, 2) press send, 3) wait for two rings, 4) enter your PIN 
number and 5) press the send button again. It's my understanding 
that an operator comes up on frequency to have you set a code if 
you don't have a PIN number al ready. But wouldn't some 
reprogramming of the phone be needed? It all sounds like a 
nightmare and Crowe says that it might be cutting down on normal 
calling volume and revenue because of the inconvenience. Want to 
know more about plans and authentication? Here's the full quote 
from David, "They are standardized in IS-53 Rev. A. True 
authentication, as defined in IS-54, IS-91, IS-95 and IS-136, and 
as supported by IS-41 Rev. B (plus TSB-51) and IS-41 Rev. C is 
much more complex, but with less user involvement. The user starts 
the process by entering a 26 digit key, and the phone then 
generates a temporary key that is used for most operation. The 
temporary key can be updated by the system, and the " A " key by 
manual entry in the phone and in the Authentication Center. 
Confused? Time to read the sidebar on this page and to get a free 
sub from Cellular Business. 
    I was not able to get a copyright release for the Numismatic 
News article that ImOkey sent in a while back. It's entitled 
"Telephone Tokens: The forerunner of the phone card" and it 
appeared in the January 10, 1995 issue. That's Volume 44, No. 2. 
Let me mention three articles in the last few months that I 
thought were very good. The first was Jack Rickard's "Editor' s 
Notes: The Security Paradox" in April's Boardwatch. It brings some 
reasoned, rational, and humorous thinking into the debate about 
Mitnick. (1-800-993-6038 is the number for subs.) Another great 
article was "Toll Fraud: Debunking Popular Myths" by Stan Tyo in 
May's TeleProfessional. Tyo admits that disgruntled employees may 
contribute to toll fraud. He also described how current employees 
might be contributing. A very honest article. The MCI switch 
technician, for example, who helped steal over $50,000,000 worth 
of calls last December was certainly no outsider. MCI tried to 
paint him as a hacker but that was just a cover for their failed 
security. The guy was an MCI employee first. They had the means 
and the methods to control his activities but they did not do so. 
In the February 27, 1995 Bell Labs News, an article on security 
mentioned hackers as a source of problems for business but they 
also included corporate competitors, industrial espionage and 
"problems caused by poorly administered systems and inadequate 
employee awareness." Exactly. Toll fraud and abuse is a big 
problem. But I'm not convinced that hackers are a big part of it. 
Why do I mention all of this?
	Mike Moss recently became a subscriber to private line. He's 
a reporter with New York Newsday. (Two Park Avenue, NY, NY 10016)  
He writes a great deal about phone fraud but it's not the kind you 
might suspect. Most of his recent articles deal with long distance 
companies who switch a customer's carrier without telling them. 
Slamming. The subscriber often gets a huge bill after being  
switched illegally to one of these high priced carriers. He 
details how hard it is to get your bill fixed and the bureaucratic 
nightmare that awaits most who are victimized. His articles remind 
me of how much toll fraud is sponsored by industry types such as 
Oncor and Sonic. Throw in telemarketing scams and the damage 
caused is enormous. You have to look at the entire picture of 
fraud and not just the lone hacker. Mitnick's real crime is 
probably electronic vandalism and should be treated as such. But 
individuals are always easier to target than corporations. A group 
of hackers is a gang or a ring. A group of corporate thieves, 
however, can call themselves a  Board of Directors. I know that 
sounds naive but that's really the way it is.

IV. THE PAYPHONE CORNER

Let's continue with some points that Onkel Dittmeyer raised in his 
letter on page 94. I'm not comfortable discussing card technology 
because it takes us away from telephony, however, telephone cards 
will be a major part of public communications in the near future. 
So, lets roll around in some terms and speculate. For purposes of 
this article, I assume that you all have read "The Gold Card" 
article in the Spring, I 995 2600.  
	  First things first. A normal telephone calling card is one 
issued by your local exchange carrier or a long distance company. 
Like an AT&T calling card. These are really not part of our 
discussion. Eric Stebel, managing editor of both TeleCard World 
and Public Communications, now uses the term remote memory card to 
identify a prepaid calling card. A remote memory card accesses a 
distant switch by an 800 number to connect the call. The majority 
of calling cards sold in America uses this technology. Talk and 
toss. The phone does not require any intelligence or memory on the 
part of the calling card. Just an 800 number and an access code. 
The card itself could be plastic, steel, wood or paper. Anything 
printed that contains the two numbers. Some simple remote memory 
cards, though, may have a magnetic stripe used by a retailer to 
activate the card once it's sold. Don't confuse this with a 
magnetic stripe card that requires a payphone with a reader. Like 
the ones that NYNEX uses. Those are true swipe reader phones .   
	 By comparison, Stebel now refers to debit cards as phone-
based cards. This implies that a true debit card must contain some 
intelligence or memory within the card itself. That could be a 
magnetic or optical striped card which you swipe or a chip card 
that you insert. In either case, the phone must be sufficiently 
complex to accept such a card and then inter act with it. 
Ameritech, NYNEX Bell South and US West have all run trials or 
experimented with phone based cards. These are now all magnetic 
stripe cards. Only International Telecom Incorporated (ITI) of 
Alaska, a private payphone operator, has had any real, lengthy 
experience with chip based cards. The trend in the next four or 
five years, though is toward re mote memory cards/ pre-paid 
calling cards.    
	You will notice, however, that David Stubbs of Teltrust used 
the word debit card to refer to remote memory cards throughout the 
length of his speech that begins on page 110. A debit card in 
banking has usually referred to an instrument which transfers 
funds automatically from your account to the account of someone 
else. So, you have industry leaders using some these terms 
interchangeably. The bottom line? Ask. Inquire. Write in and get 
people to define their terms. There will be a built-in amount of 
confusion until everybody gets on the same page.    
	Back to Dittmeyer's comments. Installing a magnetic reader 
card phone has been fairly simple. Kits are made to retrofit an 
existing COCOT with a normal DTMF keypad to one with a keypad and 
a reader. A reader is attached underneath the keypad. This keypad 
connects to the phone's circuit board with a ribbon cable. Put in 
the card and pull it out. Altering the magnetic stripe alters the 
balance on the card. No need for a laptop or wires hanging out of 
a phone. 

	I understand, though, that most of the information is 
encrypted in such a way that defeat is impractical; the methods 
used by a NYNEX phone card parallel the sophisticated methods used 
by a VISA card, a gas card or an ATM card.    This is very 
different from a phone that can read chip cards and magnetic 
cards. These machines hold the card in place while it reads the in 
formation The trend is not toward access to the card while this 
happens -- Protel's new 100, 8505 and 8600 Series payphone all 
seem to swallow the card completely, much like an ATM machine. 
They've learned their lessons in Europe, in part, because they
are already there.

IV. QUICK AND DIRTY GUIDE TO THE RELEVANT EIA/TIA STANDARDS

          (Prices are from Global)

I S-41: "Intersystem Operations" A patched together set of rules 
designed to handle roamers: validation, hand-off from one system 
to another, location tracking and so on. It's been revised many 
times. It has not been implemented everywhere nor with equal 
uniformity where it has been. Some carriers may comply and some 
might not. There are at least five parts of IS-41, with each part 
costing from $36.00 to $100. 
IS-53: The features or services interim standard. Describes how 
things like call forwarding, PIN numbers, calling name 
identification, incoming call screening and law enforcement 
intercepts should be handled. Revised many times and over laps 
with IS-41 in some areas. $49 
IS-54: TDMA. $227
IS-91: 800 MHz Analog Cellular. $126 
IS-95: CDMA. $260 
IS-136 Revision of IS-54 (U.S. Digital TDMA) $? 

The electronics and telecom industry develops standards, interim 
standards (IS) and telecommunications system bulletins (TSBs) for 
many reasons. Chiefly uniformity. The Electronic Industry 
Association and The Telecommunications Industry Association are 
the chief players in developing cellular standards in the US. Even 
after a decade, most of the cellular trade is still governed by 
interim standards, many of which have undergone countless 
revisions with no end in sight. 

Global Engineering has the monopoly on publishing the EIA/TIA 
standards. It's quite a racket. For them. The standards are 
printed on plain paper with no covers. They are stapled once on 
the top left corner and the documents are three hole punched. They 
can be 50 pages or 500 pages long depending on the standard. Call 
or write for a free catalog and price list. l find the catalog 
helpful in deciphering all the acronyms. Global publishes for over 
400 standard developing bodies!

V CLASS OF SERVICE AND PAYPHONES

   We haven't discussed classes of services before. A business 
line and a residential line may use the same kind of twisted pair 
but they are treated differently by the telco. A residential line 
usually gets an unlimited amount of calls for a flat rate while 
business lines are charged on a per minute basis. Similarly, COCOT 
lines and telco coin lines also get treated differently.    COCOTs 
are not controlled by the local exchange carrier but the payphone 
operator must apply for a special class of service. The LEC keeps 
track and tags each call from a COCOT with an identifying marker. 
John Higdon points out that COCOTs are a special class of service 
that provides the following:    
1. 900/976 blocked;
2. Billed number screening (no collect or third party can be 
billed to them); 
3. LEC operator will complete no calls, or provide call assistance 
to caller; 
4. Show up as COCOT class of service on real-time ANI 
applications; 
5. Get special local rates from the LEC.

machine. They've learned their lessons in Europe, in part, because 
they are already there. Stebel reports that "All of the major 
payphone manufacturers in the United States are selling smart card 
payphones to foreign countries. Some international payphone 
companies are even selling smart card payphones to the RBOCs."
	 So, the payphone companies have learned their lessons and 
are already learning more. Much of this ties into the standards 
that The Gold Card article mentions. AFNOR. ISO. Who are these 
groups and where can you read these standards? AFNOR stands for 
Association Francaise de Normalisation (of course). Only ITI, as I 
understand it, has used their standards with their cards. Let's 
concentrate on the ISO. The ISO or International Standards 
Organisation is a body composed of many nations. They try to get 
together to settle on the ways that things work What does the ISO 
itself say about standards?  
	  "Standards are documented agreements containing technical 
specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently 
as rules guidelines, or definitions of characteristics, to ensure 
that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their 
purpose. For example, the format of the credit cards, phone cards, 
and " smart" cards that have become commonplace is derived from an 
ISO International Standard. Adhering to the standard, which 
defines such features as an optimal thickness (0,76 mm), means 
that the cards can be used worldwide. International Standards thus 
contribute to making life simpler, in creasing the reliability and 
effectiveness of the goods and services we use. "    

	"What does an ISO standard look like? It can be anything from 
a four-page document to a 1000-page tome, including twice the 
weight of the standard itself in informative annexes. It may 
specify the tasks that a certain range of equipment must be able 
to perform, or describe in detail an apparatus and its safety 
features. It may contain symbols, definitions, diagrams, codes, 
test methods, etc."    Okay, okay you say, so what are the ISO 
standards regarding chip cards? It's not that simple. The ISO is 
currently producing draft industry standards (DIS) that have not 
been finalized. Here are the ones that seem to apply most to chip 
cards:  
1) ISO 9992- 1: 1990 Financial transaction cards -- Messages 
between the integrated circuit card and the card accepting device 
-- Part 1: Concepts and structures; 
 2) ISO 10202-1:1991 Financial transaction cards -- Security 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 1: Card life cycle;  
3) ISO/DIS 10202-2 Financial transaction cards -- Security 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 2: Transaction process; 
 4) ISO/DIS 10202-3 Financial transaction cards -- Security ISO 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 3: Cryptographic key relationships;  
5) ISO/DIS 10202-4 Financial transaction cards -- Security 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 4: Secure application modules;
6) ISO/DIS 10202-5 Financial transaction cards -- Security 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 5: Use of algorithms;
  7) ISO 10202-6: 1994 Financial transaction cards -- Security 
architecture of financial transaction systems using integrated 
circuit cards -- Part 6: Cardholder verification.    The ISO is 
represented in America by the American National Standards 
Institute. ANSI.

 I asked for a price list on the above interim standards and for 
their free brochure explaining the ISO but after a month and a

VIII OUTSIDE PLANT, PART 1

Outside plant or OSP refers to telco-owned equipment and 
facilities that are outside the main central office that serves 
local customers. Cables, manholes, utility poles, equipment 
cabinets and remote switching modules are all outside plant 
facilities. Everything from the cable vault at the central office 
to the demarcation point at your house or office. I'm doing two 
things in this article: I) introducing the subject of outside 
plant and 2) looking at buried facilities or buried plant. I'll 
look at aerial plant and rural OSP in more detail in the next 
issue. Let's look at the big picture first and then define outside 
plant a little more. This quote is nearly fifty years old but it 
still manages to put the entire public telephone switched network 
(PTSN) into perspective: 
  "The term 'telephone plant' includes (I) the telephone ap 
paratus and wiring at the subscribers' premises; (2) the central 
office switching equipment (with the buildings that contain it) 
for interconnecting subscribers' lines; and (3) the aerial and 
underground wires and cables with their pole lines and con duits, 
which connect the subscribers' stations with the central offices 
and the latter with each other whether they be in the same city or 
in different cities. This piant makes it possible, at the present 
time, for any user of the telephone service to be connected 
promptly with any other station of the telephone system, and to 
converse easily, by electrical means, with the person called, 
after the connection is established, regardless of distance. The 
systems which enable this nation-wide service to be rendered are 
necessarily complex and intricate and they in clude a multitude of 
auxiliary devices and appurtenances.''l 11 
   Complex and intricate indeed. But the layout of outside plant 
is fairly straightforward, even though the technology has been 
getting more complex. Let's define outside plant more specifically 
before showing how the different elements come together. Lee says 
that "The outside plant of a telephone company encompasses all 
telephone fa cilities from the main distributing frame (MDF) in 
the central office to the protector at the customer's residence or 
business location." Besides the many forms of buried and aerial 
cable involved, Lee also maintains that OSP includes "electronic 
carrier systems, microwave, or some form of subscriber or 
concentrator arrangement.''l2l That's practically everything in 
the local loop. There are some problems with that definition. 
   Remote switches confuse the outside plant definition somewhat. 
They are tied to the main central office by trunks but they 
generally provide their own dial tone and switching. They are part 
of today's distributed switching, with a little central office 
possible nearly every where. The remote 5ESS pictured on page 107 
is an example. That switch is the termination for the entire local 
loop distribution plant in its area. It has its own backup power 
supply, ringing generator distribution frame and multiplexing 
equipment. Among other things. Everything outside of this facility 
is outside plant as well, but possibly not the switch itself. 
That's because switching equipment has usually been considered the 
province of central office plant, things within the building 
proper.  

	But many remotes are housed in underground vaults. That makes 
them buried plant. And that means outside plant to me. I'd argue 
that out sidc plant includes any equipment or facilities that are 
connected to a particular central office. That means remotes and 
anything else that helps provide local service. Sound pedantic? 
Not really. The last census I saw showed that there were 8 663 
central offices in the United States but 10,584 remote 
switches.(3) Seems like a good dcfinition is in order. Yet 
industry itself does not agree on terms. The best selling telecom 
dictionary today says that outside plant does nol include micro 
wave towers, antennas and cable system repeaters. (4) This 
directly contradicts Lee. And although he is no longer with us, I 
think I will stick with his older but more authoritative opinion. 
   Now that we've somewhat defined what outside plant is, let us 
look at how it is arranged. Again, the focus is on an urban 
setting. I'll leave rural areas for the next issue. (Gives me an 
excuse for a road trip.) 

   Lee mentions five kinds of plans for outside plant. But only 
the serving area concept and the modified serving area concept 
seem to be in favor. I'll let another expert describe it, " In 
order to standardize the way loop distribution plants are set up 
in the U.S. (and to prevent chaos) the Bell System created a 
standard reference design. For urban and suburban areas, this plan 
was called the Serving Areas Concept (SAC) plan. Basically, in the 
SAC plan, each city is divided into one or more Wire Centers which 
are each handled by a local central office switch. A typical WC 
will handle 41,000 subscriber lines. Each WC is divided into about 
10 or so Serving Areas (depending on the size and population of 
the city), with an average size of 12 square miles . . . each 
Serving Area may handle around 500 to 1,000 lines or more for 
maybe 200 to 400 housing units, typically a tract of homes."

Feeder cable (F1) goes out to each serving area managed by the 
central office. "This cable can contain from 600 to over 2,000 
pairs, and often more than one physical F1 cable is needed to 
service a single Serving Area (at an SAI). The F1 is almost always 
located underground because the size, weight and number of feeders 
makes it impossible to put them on normal telephone poles. Since 
it is also impractical to use one single piece of cable, the F1 
usually consists of several pieces of large, pressurized or 
armored cable spliced together underground into a single 
cable."[6] 
	One or more F1s terminate or are wired into the back of a 
Serving Area Interface. This could be a small or large terminal 
board or block. Local twisted pairs connect to the other side of 
these boards and go out to the local neighborhood. The idealized 
map presented on page 102 is just that: idealized. Where the SAI 
is and how many of them are tied to a particular central office is 
all dependent on population, the switch that exists at the C.O., 
the facilities available to the local telco, future plans and so 
on. You can make a more realistic map yourself by noting the SAIs 
in your neighborhood in relation to the end office that serves 
you. In addition, F1 may first terminate at a multiplexer or a 
pair gain facility like a SLC-96.  These systems put many, many 
conversations over a single pair of wires. That helps if, say, a 
large apartment complex gets built in an already developed area. 
The existing feeder cables and ducts may already be at capacity. 
Multiplexing takes the analog traffic of the local loop and 
digitizes it over the existing F1 cable. An SAI is usually nearby 
to provide a connection to the local loop's twisted pairs. The SAI 
is most commonly housed in the kind of cabinet shown on page 103. 
There are smaller and larger cabinets, however, so it is often 
tough to tell.  But most have doors and those labeled with a 
street address are almost certainly an SAI. Automatic Electric 
cabinets often had simulated wood grain siding. (No, I'm not 
kidding.) What then, are in the rest of the smaller green boxes 
that dot the landscape? 
	Most of these are called pedestals and most of them don't 
have doors. Most relate to buried plant and a neighborhood that 
has its utilities underground. They serve as splice housings and 
service terminals for buried drop wires to connect to the local 
distribution cable. The most common "are the PC4, PC 6 and PC 12; 
these are around 50" tall by 4", 6" or 12" respectively, and are 
painted gray-green like SAI cabinets. These are the smallest 
pedestals in the distribution plant and they don't have doors 
(they look like waist-high square poles). [T]hese pedestal 
closures are often used for other purposes, such as splicing 
points in underground distribution, loading coil mounting, and 
even used as temporary wire storage containers."[7] We've now 
looked a bit at what is on the surface. What's down below?

	Buried plant is an underground system. It  depends on 
conduits or ducts, manholes, cables, and vaults. Conduit or ducts 
are simply empty pipes, often made of plastic or structural foam. 
These are laid into trenches, filled or capped with concrete and 
backfilled over. Spare conduits get put in at the same time. This 
makes it possible to pull out an old cable or to put a new one in.  
Directly plowing a cable into the earth is done only for buried 
distribution cable or  rural trunks. The F1 cable usually runs in 
conduit all the way from the C.O. to the SAI.  Cables are then 
accessed and pulled from manholes or vaults. Many conduits have 
become filled over the years, especially in downtown areas. 
Happily, fiber optic cable recovers space in old, crowded 
quarters. Conduits that were crowded with bulky copper cable are
 now giving way to fiber optic cables that take far less space yet
 provide far more capac ity. Much of what you'd see in a manhole
 is represented in the photographs on page 105 albeit, in the more 
spacious, well lit surroundings of the cable vault. In addi tion,
 certain areas have concrete tunnels between manholes and not 
conduit, with telephone cables racked to the sides of the tunnels.
 Lee says that manholes should not be further than 750 feet apart. 
I'm not sure if that works out in practive, however, I have noticed 
something about the covers. There seems to be two types: the round
ones and the kind that have two hinged steel plates. The ones with
the steel plates seem easier to lift and they provide a bigger entrance.
But I see them only on sidewalks and not out in the middle of the
 street. They must be limited to areas without traffic. The round,
 iron manhole cover may be the only kind that stands up well to 
40,000 pound trucks running over them all day.

   I hope to look at aerial plant and rural OSP in more detail next
issue. I had hoped to include some photos of various oddities in 
this issue but I wasn't able to get on the road to take black and white
photos of them. The nearest post-pay phones, for ex ample, that I 
know are in Idaho.  And I'm no longer certain that they can be 
considered outside plant equiyment. In any case, l hope you enjoyed 
this introduction to the subject and feel free to send me copies of any 
interesting photographs that you may wish to share.

IX. A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE TELECOM DIGEST

Pat Townsend moderates a discussion group about telecommunications 
on the Internet. Look for comp.dcom.telecom if you have USENET 
access. He's been moderating this group for over ten years. People 
submit hundreds of questions to the digest each week. Pat selects 
which ones to post. He sometimes edits the question for clarity 
and he often adds his own opinions. Replies to a question are not 
automatically put up by Pat. He controls them as well. You have, 
in effect, a kind of daily telecom newspaper under strict 
editorial control. I do not subscribe to this group but I do look 
it over from time to time.
	Here's a list of topics selected at random to show what's 
discussed:

	Pat spends as much time writing and editing as any newspaper 
or magazine writer. He's just doing it electronically. I think he 
needs encouragement to put some of the ten years of the Telecom 
Digest into hardcopy. He's contemplating a CD ROM but that would 
cut out access for anyone without a computer and a CD drive. He 
also needs contributions to continue the work of the digest:

X. BOOK REVIEWS

   Old Time Telephones is a wonderful book about 
telephones for collectors, repair people and just about 
anyone who wonders how telephones work. You'll find
 everything from the earliest history of telephony to a lengthy 
discussion of modern touch tone phone circuitry. It's divided 
into four parts. The first discusses the development of
 components. It includes chapters on early developments and 
the Bell patent, receivers, induction coils, magnetos, ringers,
 switches and dials. The other major parts of the book are Telephone
 Instruments, Electrical Circuits, and Restoration and Repair.
 Each of these parts are as well detailed as the first. There's a 
good appendix that describes basic electrical principals 
(Myer holds a Ph.D. in physics), an excellent bibli ography and
 a well done index. 

   Myer's approach is comprehensive. He comments, for example, 
on a component's function as well as its evolution. Let me illustrate 
this point. In the first part he explains that varistors protect a telephone
 receiver from elec trical distrubances and that they reduce clicking
 noises on the line that you might hear otherwise. He then writes in
 a later chapter that, "Unfortunately for Western Electric, the No. 44 
varistor could only be successfully made with copper oxide from a 
mine in the Chilean Andes, and that ore was being rap idly depleted 
(Michal 1960). Consequently, the Bell Laboratories developed a new
 low voltage varistor out of silicon." Your editor approves of esoterica! 
haven't seen this kind of detail since Fagen edited A History of 
Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The Early Years. 
I use this book for reference and for browsing. It keeps things straight. 
Dozens of models, makes and manufacturers are described or mentioned.
  ITT, Kellogg, Stromberg-Carlson, A.E. and Western Electric all made 
different products at different times and this book does a great job of sorting
most of them out. It's a little light on Automatic Electric and foreign makes
like
  Ericsson are generally not treated but what do you want? The 290
 pages of details that it does have will make any telephone enthusiast happy.
 Myer says that it took him more than five years to write this book and
 I believe it. Here's a nice paragraph from his book to end this review: 

   "On January 1, 1984, the Western Electric Company, then older than 
the telephone itself, ceased to exist (Hochheiser 1991, 143). On that 
day of court ordered divestiture, the Bell System was broken into seven
 regional operating companies (the Baby Bells) and a more compact 
AT&T. AT&T retained the long-distance part of the business, its 
venerable research organization (Bell Laboratories), and its manufacturing 
operations (which could no longer have exclusive supply arrangements with 
the operating companies). A newly cre ated AT&T Technologies, Inc. assumed 
the corporate charter of Western Electric and continued making 500-type,
 2500-type, and Trimline telephones under the AT&T Technologies label for
 several years at plants in Indianapo lis and Shreveport. However, to become
 competitive in the market, AT&T shifted residential telephone manufacturing 
to the Far East, beginning in Hong Kong in late 1985, Singapore the following
 year, and later in Bangkok and elsewhere. Thus ended U.S. production of
 rugged electromechanical telephones, and though phones similar to the 500-type,
the 2500-type, the Princess, and the Trimline are still made to day, they are
 products of the modern electronics age, rather than a bygone culture."

	ISDN: A User's Guide to Services, Applications & Resources In  
California, is this issue's freebie to write away for. It's 60 
pages of information on the Integrated Services Digital Network -- 
the most talked about and most delayed telecommunication service 
in the last 15 years. The best parts of this book are the hand 
drawn graphics, lifted with permission from France Telecom, Inc. 
and reworked by Pacific Telesis.
	ISDN is a digital service provided by some phone companies. 
It uses two conventional twisted pairs. You could set it up right 
now if you had two phone lines and your local telco had a switch 
equipped with ISDN capabilities. Pacific Bell, though, recommends 
that you also have an additional line with a normal phone in case 
of a power failure. 
	In any case, ISDN allows a digital connection from you to the 
telephone company. It makes sense to put digital into the local 
loop since nearly all traffic is digital between switches. This 
allows a full digital connection from one end of the telephone 
system to the other. Provided, of course, that the person on the 
other end has or can get the same kind of ISDN connection that you 
have.  Voice and data or both can travel at the same time on the 
same ISDN line. You can do video conferencing with one person 
while sending a fax to someone else. You can also run a fast 
Internet connection on this, although frame relay may be a better 
choice.
	ISDN is a particular kind of digital service, with its own 
protocols and signaling requirements. It's being implemented in 
various parts of the country in some form. Thus, it competes with 
or complements other digital services such as switched 56, frame 
relay, full T-1 and fractional T-1. The speed of the connection 
most resembles fractional T-1, which has always been the least 
expensive digital line if your telco provides it. Implementing  
ISDN, though, may be the most difficult of all the services at 
this point.
	Pacific Bell's offering is a good place to start 
understanding the terminology, procedures and possible 
applications of ISDN. I keep it as a reference to look up things 
like BRI, PRI, NT1 and so on. I may not need ISDN but it's 
interesting to read about and to keep current on. The book is free 
but you may have to flatter them if you are from out of state.

XI. DEBIT CARDS: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

	David Stubbs of Teltrust gave a great talk about debit cards 
at TeleCard World '95 in Los Angeles in March.  I didn't  go to 
the convention but I did get a tape of his speech. His remarks 
concentrate on pre-paid calling cards but he does mention optical 
cards and magnetic cards in passing. Optical, magnetic and chip 
cards all store value in the card itself. Remote memory cards, 
however, store value in a remote database. Stubbs uses debit card 
to refer to all pre-paid cards.
	 Remote memory cards are a big business getting bigger. 
Please read this article even if you are not interested in cards; 
I think you will become interested in them if you do. The 
following is not a verbatim transcript, by the way.  I did have to 
add some words here and there to make the text flow more freely. I 
would say, though,  that 98% of his speech is unchanged. Remember, 
too, that this talk was aimed squarely at trade people and not the 
average phone user.  It does not, for example, address the fraud 
committed by certain debit card companies. Like giving you 58 
seconds instead of 60 seconds for one minute of time. Or printing 
up a million units worth of time but only buying 800,000 units, 
hoping that not all of the cards get used up.

	Good morning, my name is David Stubbs and as you can probably 
tell straight away, I've got a rather funny accent. I come from an 
area that is very much involved in the use of debit cards for 
rather a long time. In fact, it's almost twenty years since it was 
actually started. I am both an Englishman and a New Zealander and 
both of these countries have major investments  in debit cards. 
Probably most of you have seen this - I've got here a 20 unit 
British Telecom card. A unit in the UK is a period of time. If you 
are talking in the London area you might get two minutes per unit, 
if you are talking from London to the north of Scotland you might 
get half a minute and if you talk to the United States you may get 
three seconds per unit. I bought this card last week for two 
pounds which is about $3.40. This thing has been around in the UK  
I think for about 17 years. 
	I'm going to talk a little bit more about the fraud side of 
things, not the side that we have been talking about like the 
switches and  the issuing of cards. More about a different sort of 
area because I was an original frauder of these cards. It was 
possible in the old days to coat the back of this card with 
ladies' nail polish, be able to insert the card into a British 
Telecom reader and get all the free calling you wanted. [Laughter] 
That was before Landis and Gyr decided that perhaps they ought to 
modify the machines so that people like me couldn't do it. But my 
history as a hacker goes back a lot, lot further than that.
	Do you remember the English telephone boxes, the red ones you 
often see in the movies? In the old days they used to have these 
lovely black telephones inside that used 'push-push' operation.  
Put your money in and push to talk if your party answered. You 
pressed 'A' if they did and if they didn't you pressed 'B' and 
your money came falling out. Well, we as kids learned that if you 
picked up the handset and you tapped out on the cradle, three taps 
gave you a three, four taps gave you a four, and, in fact, you 
used to be able to make free telephone calls. So, as kids about on 
the West Side we used to call people for free all the time and 
annoy them just for having use of the telephone system.
	Well it's come a long way since then in the UK. You've got 
two different systems.  You've got a system like this which is 
produced by British Telecom, with the payphones made by Landis and 
Gyr. And then you have another system made by GPT which I think is 
the one that is used  by the Japanese and by the New Zealanders 
where they actually store the value not in a strip across the 
front of the card where it is optically burned out and scanned, 
which is the little white line that you can see when you come up 
later on,  but in three magnetic  stripes. It's actually a fairly 
interesting algorithm that calculates how much is being used and 
rewrites it to the card. The only place you'll buy those readers 
from is GPT so there's a fair amount of security built into the 
system by the fact those cards can only be read by certain 
readers.
	We don't face that problem, in fact, in the United States. We 
have a different set of rules. We have allowed our debit cards to 
be used absolutely everywhere. Here I have a sample of a debit 
card that my company  issues. Teltrust, by the way, started life 
as a payphone operator. I think we hated  the concept and the idea 
of debit cards when they first came out because we thought 
everybody would use our telephones without us making any revenue. 
[People dial around a payphone owner and their profits with 800 
numbers] I think we finally came to the realization that, okay, if 
we help sell these cards we'll make revenue from both sides of it 
coming and going.  We've actually been playing now with debit 
cards for two years; I think we're fairly serious now. We've 
issued something like five million cards so far.
	My question, by way of Rick's comments, is how many of the 
250 to 500 million cards issued in the United States in 1995 will 
actually be used? I don't know if you realize it but something on 
the order of 85% to 90% of all debit cards issued are not going  
to be used. [This is very high. I think he means that the card 
will not be used up completely] A statement was made in December 
at a conference I was at in Houston that less than 3% of the 
population currently knows anything about what a debit card really 
is. Bear in mind these large numbers are going to be . 
associated with cards that are active but not being used. And that 
is the hacker's dream.	
	It's finding out [for the hacker] who's been issuing these 
cards. For instance, if a half million Kodak cards were given away 
with a box of three rolls of film, and the number of those that 
were used was minuscule, a hacker who gains access to your system 
and gains access to those cards can absolutely make free with what 
is your money.  And so I think the control of those is very, very 
important. Richard mentioned that activation is a great problem - 
you have to be able to control the activation. I'm just  making 
these comments before I go into what I really wanted to talk 
about.
	Why were debit cards originally issued overseas? They were 
issued because they were a way to give an economic calling  method 
to the casual caller. We're all very familiar with people going 
out and using payphones; they're  all over the place in this 
country. I think there are estimated to be something like two and 
a half to three million pay-phones available in the United States. 
But we're paying a premium, though, with payphones because of 
fraud.
 	If ever you go to one of the pay-phone shows and listen to 
the people talk about fraud, you'll wonder why the heck people 
ever go into the business. The destruction of payphones for 
accessing the coins is the main reason why people are thinking of 
changing [to cards]. I asked our payphone division head about what 
he thought was the reason a payphone was broken into or stolen. He 
said 95% of the people who break in are after the money. There may 
be $2,000 worth of control boards and mechanisms and everything 
else in the payphone but they're not interested.  95% of the 
reasons you have problems is because of money;  either they're 
breaking into the money box or they're really hacked off with this 
payphone because it swallowed their money and so they take the 
handset and they bash the heck out of the payphone and break the 
handset.
	So, the people overseas learned their lessons fairly early on 
with payphones. They were controlled by the national telephone 
companies.  [The Post or Postal Telephone & Telegraph companies 
(PTTs)] I showed you a British Telecom card earlier on as an 
example - they had to find a better method of a) stopping the 
destruction of their payphones and  b) giving the user a break. If 
you don't have a problem with the payphone you bring down the 
costs of service. That's one of the things that we are seeing as a 
spin-off over here, because of the reduced amount of fraud that 
there is using debit cards we're able to offer really low cost 
calling. For example, typically we're seeing anything from the 
independents who are producing debit cards, producing a debit card 
that's giving you like 20, 24, 25 cents a minute in the United 
States. If you go to our majors, the AT&T's, the MCI's and the 
Sprints, they're charging a higher premium  because 
they are protecting their existing business which is calling 
cards. 
	These then are the reasons why people did it: it was more 
economic, there was less fraud, and there was less  knocking of 
the phones around. For instance, in New Zealand -I like to bring 
this one up because I know this study  fairly well there - they 
have approximately 9,500 payphones in the country and 5,000 of 
those are debit card only. They do not take anything other than 
the debit card. They have placed those in the higher crime areas, 
they've placed those in the remote areas of the countryside, 
they've cut down considerably on the cost of servicing that 
business. 
	The other thing we've got to do to be able to get more debit 
cards in the United States is, in fact, to educate the general 
public. As I've mentioned before, only 3% of the population really 
knows what the heck we are doing. As we see the majors move more 
into the debit card business you're going to see more and more 
acceptance by the general public and therefore more and more usage 
of those. 
	The key questions? [About fraud] I thought I'd take this 
invitation to speak to you as a challenge to learn something more 
about it. My background is more on the switch side of things;  I 
do know quite a lot about our switching facility although I am a 
simple peddler in the field. My background is 25 years in 
computers so I know quite a lot about hacking. I was mentioning 
the hacking in the early days, it was fairly simple to do hacking 
through systems and networks because most people didn't protect 
them. A lot of the things we are going to learn over the next 
couple of years in our industry is how to protect our switches 
against this. But what we've got to look at are the vulnerable 
areas, where the risks are, who has the liability and who pays for 
the fraud. These are four very, very key questions that we need to 
answer when looking at debit cards. 
	In particular, we need to look at the PINs, which we've 
talked about, the physical cards, the actual cash that's being 
paid over, the credit cards that are used, the time that is being 
stolen and what I call the intellectual property rights of the 
actual card itself. That's because one of the major areas that is 
not being addressed by my two colleagues is the actual card. Rick 
mentioned the card that was issued at the Democratic National 
Convention. That card currently sells from $1500 to $2000. It's 
just a simple piece of plastic. And here we have, as I've said 
before, the typical piece of plastic that is issue by Teltrust. 
[Shows debit card to audience again] And I, as a fairly 
sophisticated computer user, wouldn't bother to actually hack into 
your database. There's far, far more money to be made by simply 
taking a 2400 dpi scanner, scanning in the front and back of that 
card, pressing it through my PC and going to a very sophisticated 
printer, which might cost me about  $5,000 and physically 
duplicating the card. And you say, "Why do that?" On the back you 
notice the little sticker, it can either be a sticker or a scratch 
off, I don't care which. I'll put either one on there. The thing 
is, the value to that card is going to be associated with the fact 
that that sticker or scratch off has not been removed. Or if it 
was in a pouch, that the card has not been taken out of the pouch. 
We're going to see cards in this country go up in value like crazy 
as more and more people become aware of what they are and more and 
more people collect them. The biggest fraud, I believe, is not 
going to be the theft of time, I believe it is going to be the 
duplication and copying of cards. All right? That's where the 
money is going to be made. 
	Do you realize that the most valuable card in New Zealand at 
the moment is one that shows Dunedin's railway station, a god 
awful place, excuse my French, but I don't know why they put it on 
a card. That card sells for $46,000 dollars now. And I was in New 
Zealand last year and they held an auction for debit cards. 
Telecom New Zealand is the major issuer of debit cards. It issued 
25 cards of face value of $100 dollars each. The first 24 cards 
were sold en block for $125,000. The last single card, number 25, 
was sold for $25,000. It's just a piece of plastic. So bear with 
me and see what's going to happen. So that's the thing that you 
are going to have to control. The question is, how are you going 
to control it?
	There are two sets of numbers on the back of a card. There 
happens to be a number hidden under here which is the 
authorization number and there is a number over here which is the 
control number. And Richard talked about the fact that you are 
generating a card, getting them out to the general public's hands, 
but as you pass through you've got various  phases. And you've got 
to control that all the way through. What we have recommended is 
the use of a single control number on the back here. This is a 
sequential number that is used - if someone buys 2,000 cards they 
get number 1 to 2,000. You then should take those cards, if they 
are going to be sold out and activated, and use a system like one 
that Rick talked about. You should track who they've gone to, at 
what time they went and where they've gone. Right? Then you have 
the ability to check that there are only 2,000 of those. So, that 
reduces the risk of someone straight copying the card compared to 
one that has only an authorization number that I as a perspective 
dealer in these cards would not want to scratch off. This control 
number is trackable and you should know where it was and when it 
was sold. This reduces and minimizes  risk. 
	But it is something you've got to be vigilant about. I don't 
know if you've been following the copyright law cases that have 
been going on between the United States and China, which we have 
finally resolved. They have now basically come to the realization 
that intellectual property rights are vested and need to  be 
protected. You could go and get any book copied in Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and somewhere else and there was nothing 
against anybody copying that and going out and selling an 
identical product. We need to control this, we need to come up 
with systems. Richard's got a very good system, being able to 
track and do inventory on this but we have got be serious about 
this. Number your cards, put control numbers on them and watch it. 
Because that, I believe, is the biggest problem.
	Who's going to be responsible if we go back to the problem of 
time theft? That's one of the things that's not been talked about. 
Who's got the liability and who's got to pay for it? That depends 
on how you sell the card. If you as a card generator, sell the 
card to a dealer then make sure he pays you. He, in turn will sell 
it to somebody who is going to retail it and he makes sure that he 
gets paid. The retailer wants to make sure he gets the cash before 
he gives the card out. One of the things about retailing is that 
you are dealing with human beings. We talked about a card swipe 
system. You swipe the card through to activate it. A customer then 
gives the clerk some money. You've got to make sure that you get 
that cash. Fraud is associated, of course, with not getting cash 
for a  card that has been issued. So be aware of who is selling 
your cards and where the money is going. And from my old murky 
past, the rule was always to follow the money trail. That's the 
biggest thing you've got to keep an eye on. Where, oh where, is 
the cash going and  who's blowing it and who's pocket is it going 
in now? Be very much aware. Richard's control system will help you 
with that but you have to be aware of the people you are dealing 
with.
	Okay, the activation at the switch which David talked about - 
there are some wonderful things at the moment. One of the things 
that I'm not sure David mentioned is about the trunk group coming 
in. Make sure your switch can look at the physical telephone 
number of the person endeavoring to activate that card at the 
time. We talked about a card swipe. There are other systems where 
a clerk actually phones in from the retail store to activate the 
card. One of the things that you can check is that the phone 
number  line that is used to place that activation call is already 
in the database in the switch to make sure that the two numbers 
marry. little since it isn't on the card but there is still a 
chance of fraud.  I've talked about vending machines a little. I 
think that we are ultimately going to see vending machines in 
which you can put in your debit card and cash or a debit card and 
a credit card and the machine will reload your debit card account. 
I know because I built one a few years ago.
	You see, all we're doing in this debit card business here in 
the United States is remembering a physical number. I wrote out a 
number on a piece of paper at a lecture I gave in Houston. I hung 
it up and asked if anybody would give me fifty bucks for this 
piece of paper. Nobody took it. There was actually $100 worth of 
time on a debit card. All I was getting over was the point that 
all we are selling is a number. What I am saying is that there is 
risk, there is reward, there is liability, you have to define 
who's got that, where they've got it and at what point does 
somebody take over that. And be aware that with collector cards  
there is a opportunity for people to copy these and make a lot of 
money. And that is where I think the future is going to be.

XII. TELEPHONE REPAIR COLUMN

PRODUCT REVIEW:

Telephone Ringing Generator Board: RG12V/5RP. The board itself is 
2 inches square. The mechanism is adjustable from 15 to 68 Hz, 
costs $49.95 and is featured in the latest Hosfelt Electronics 
Catalog. The part number is 56-374. Hosfelft is at 800-524-6464.

USES:

   An interesting product was recently offered for sale which can 
actually make your telephone bell ring. Not only can it be used to 
test phone bells and do line simulations, but it can also activate 
equipment that listen for phone bells such as modems, faxes, and 
answering recording machines. It can also be used for inlercom 
signaling or to provide a variable Hz output for electronic 
experimentation. The variable Hz output could also be used to test 
old rural farm-country phones which were set to ring at different 
fre quencies (for several parties on a line). This product can be 
useful in testing old phones for repair or new ones to see if they 
ring properly. The product would be especially useful for folks 
who lack a second line with which to call their first line from. 
Most of all, of course, the product is an amazing and wonderful 
toy which a person can enjoy playing with in order to have fun.

OPERATION:

Connect Ground and 12 Volt-ln leads to a 12 Volt DC Power Adapter.
   Ground = black wire may be used.
   12 Volts = red wire may be used.
Connect Outputs to Phone Set. (Either since it's AC)
   One of the Outputs = red Ring wire of phoneset.
   Other of the Outputs = green Tip wire of phoneset.
Touch a yellow wire between Enable and Ground to cause ringing.
Set Cycles Per Second to about 20 Hz where phone bell sounds 
proper.

CYCLES PER SECOND ADJUSTMENT:

   Although it is advertised as adjustable between 15 & 68 Hz; in 
practice I find it to be adjustable between 5 & 4500 Hz when I 
measure the output with a digital multimeter with frequency 
feature. Telephones use 20Hz.

OUTPUT:
   When set to 20Hz exactly (by digital multimeter reading), this 
product puts out an alternating current of 150 volts and so the 
positive portion of that which is located above the ground would 
be 75 volts which is just per fect for Ringing phone bells. The 
150 volts, by the way, is an unloaded voltage which instead reads 
147 volts when a phone bell is connected.
   In order to picture in your mind how there can be an 
alternating current with a positive half located above the ground, 
think for a moment of how your ordinary household current is 240 
volts AC but has a positive portion above ground which is 120 
volts and used in ordinary household wiring such as that leading 
to your light bulbs. 240 volts is available between the hot 
positive black and the hot negative red wires. But 120 volts is 
available between either of those wires and the white ground wire.

TELCO'S BELL-RINGING POWER IS DIFFERENT:
   The phone company sends out a pulsating positive direct current 
of 75 volts root-mean-square measurement at 20 cycles per second 
through the red Ring wire and receives the power back through the 
green Tip wire (which is near ground) in the case of ordinary 
normal private subscriber
lines. Remember that pulsating direct current stays on the plus 
side of the ground when it pulsates up and down. In contrast, 
alternating current wanders on both side of ground when it 
pulsates between minus and plus. But phone bells usually don't 
care whether they get pulsating direct or alternating current.
HAVE FUN WITH IT:
	This unique product is a lot of fun, very useful and varied 
in potential application. For further information, dial (800) 524-
6464 and ask for their free catalog and look up the product on 
page 39.

      Information Regarding Phone
       Line Colors and Voltages

The green Tip wire is near ground. In that sense it is somewhat 
related to the yellow ground wire which is an actual ground. The 
red wing wire carries minus 50 volts when the phone is hung up or 
on hook. The red Ring wire carries a minus twenty volts when the 
phone is in use or off hook. This steady, direct current is used 
for talking and listening. But when the phone bell is ringing, 
there is superimposed upon the red Ring wire a positive 75 or 90 
volt pulsating direct current at 20 cycles per second. So, 
remember that the red Ring wire's current is negative for talking 
but pulsating-positive for bell ringing. In both cases, the 
current finds its ground in the green Tip wire. The Tip of the old 
operator's plug was more positive than the Ring of the plug 
because that which is near ground is more positive than a nega 
tive direct talking current. This takes some thinking to get used 
to because we so often think of ground as being the more negative. 
But with telephone talking power, the more negative was the minus 
fifty volts of the red Rinq wire.

A single wire does not run from your house to the central office. 
A connection is maintained, instead, by a collection of wires and 
cable that are strung together. Let's take one common example. 
We'll follow your phone line from your house to the nearest C.O. 
This example combines aerial and buried plant. Let's assume that 
you live in an older neighborhood in a medium sized town. The kind 
with telephone cable running through the backyards on poles. 

1. Telephone wiring inside your house first connects to the 
telco's wire at the houseprotector or service terminal. This is 
the demarcation point. Your wiring ends here and the telco's 
wiring begins. 
2. A drop wire containing one twisted pair goes to a pole closure, 
an aerial terminal or ready access terminal Call it what you will, 
this is the termination of the sub scriber's drop wire. Drop wires 
may be 30 feet or 3,000 feet long. They contain one twisted pair 
apiece.
 3. The customer's twisted pair is connected to binding posts 
within the enclosure. Depending on the enclosure, a wire 
representing your twisted pair may now be connected to the aerial 
cable servicing your neighborhood. This sort of enclosure is 
inline with the aerial cable and may serve as a connecting or 
splice point. Or, a wire from the back of the enclosure may run to 
a splice case nearby. This marries that enclosure's wire with the 
larger aerial cable that services your area. 
4. This cable may contain 50 pairs or more. It's called 
distribution cable or aerial cable or F2 for being the secondary 
feeder cable. Several F2 cables may work their way back to the 
nearest SAI. 
5. These cables go underground via conduit before connecting to 
the serving area interface. 6. The SAI. A big terminal block. 
Those ubiquitous gray-green cabinets you see nearly everywhere. F2 
cable pairs connect with F1 pairs at this point. F1 or main feeder 
cables then go underground in conduit, usually to the nearest C.O. 
or remote switching module. Or first to transmission equipment and 
then to the central office.
 
1. The demarcation or demark point. A residential one. This one is 
protected by fuses so it is considered a protected service 
terminal. Note the cable near the rain gutter. It runs up to the 
top of the roof to become an aerial drop wire. A 66 block is a 
much larger protected service terminal installed at many 
businesses, apartment complexes and other multi-unit buildings. 
April's Blacklisted! 411 had a picture of a Western Electric 66 on 
the cover. John Higdon notes that some GTE served residences have 
a mulitplexer at this point. 
2. An aerial drop wire goes to a telco's service terminal. Fooled 
you, didn't l? Everyone's seen aerial drop wire so why show it? 
This is actually open wire. It does the same thing as a drop wire 
does. It brings a customer's tip and ring to a distribution point 
in the form of bare copper wire instead of a cable with a twisted 
pair of wires. 
3. Pole mounted service terminal. They come in many shapes and 
sizes. They all do the same job. They connect the drop wire to a 
larger cable. A stub from the box goes to a splice case a few feet 
away. Ready access enclosures, by comparison, terminate the drop 
wire and splice into the larger F2 cable all at once. 
4. A serving area interface? Possibly. Many pole mounted SAls do 
look similar. 
5. Typical aerial splice case.
6. A terminal block of some sort. Maybe an SAI. Or it could be 
connecting the local drops to a larger distribution cable that in 
turn runs to an SAI.
 7. A modern SAI cabinet. Loosely called a connecting point or a 
junction box or cross connect box by some. Hundreds of connections 
possible at these binding posts. The back is mostly wired in, just 
waiting for local pairs to come to it. These cabinets can be many 
sizes. The inside of the frame usually tilts forward, providing 
access to the other side. 
8 . & 9. Still going. A car crashed into this cabinet. See the 
spare duct for future cable? Underground cable comes in and goes 
out. The SAI is the interface between the loops in the local 
neighborhood (gathered up by F2 or distribution cable) and the 
cable below the street which is F1. The main feeder goes to the 
C.O. 
10. Exterior. Handle is mounted flush with the door. Opens with a 
normal can opener but it's a strange, pull out, turn halfway kind 
of locking mechanism. 

The Cable Vault
Here's where outside plant begins, even though it is within the 
central office. See page 101. Harry Newton defines it thus, "Cable 
Vault: Room under the main distribution frame in a central office 
building. Cables from the subscribers lines come into the building 
through the cable vault. From here they snake their way up to the 
main distribution frame. The cable vault looks like a bad B-movie 
portrayal of Hell, replete with thousands of dangerous black 
snakes. Cable vaults are prime targets for the spontaneous 
starting of fires. They should be protected with Halon gas, but 
they usually aren't because some parts of the phone industry think 
Halon is too expensive." C'mon, Harry! Lighten up. Maybe that's 
the way it is in NYNEX country but the vault I saw was a picture 
of orderliness and careful workmanship. Everything was in its 
place, including a Halon fire suppression system. I can't imagine 
an insurance company settling for anything less.
1. Exterior of typical C.O. But what's below ground?
2. Roof of the cable vault, with each cable neatly held to the 
rack.
3. Far end of vault, where cables enter through conduit. Note the 
extra conduit available.
4. Long view of the cable vault. A massive amount of cable but all 
neatly racked up. Those large splice cases are better considered 
as vault closures.
5. Close-up of the entry point to the vault. Each black cable 
contains 2400 twisted pairs. Lighter colored housings contain 
several fiber optic threads  in a loose tube cable.  Air pressure 
hoses connect to the copper cable housings.
6. Splice case. Similar to what you'd see in a manhole. 
7. Over-exposed photo of a NT fiber optic cabinet. This enclosure 
is a Fiber Manager. It first arranges some of the fiber coming 
into the vault before it heads upstairs to the distribution frame.
8. Pressure monitoring system for the pressure distribution 
system. Very expensive equipment  feeds dry air (3%) into the F1 
copper cables at about 10 P.S.I. 24 hours a day. This helps keep 
water out of the cables. There are two systems in this vault. One 
takes over if the other fails.
9. Cutaway of a fiber optic "splice case".
