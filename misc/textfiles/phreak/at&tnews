  User Group member Bill Todd of Todd PC3 gave a demonstration of his
  AT&T PC6300 conversions.  Bill has been an AT&T owner/user since
  September, 1985.  He uses the computer for business, engineering and
  scientific applications.  Through his business, Bill does computer
  conversions and sells accelerator boards.  He has been working on
  several upgrades to the PC6300, which he has designated the
  Mark 8, Mark 10, and Mark 11.5.  They were developed as inexpensive
  alternatives for increasing the performance of the 6300, using an
  integrated approach, combining both software and hardware changes.
  These include the installation of an NEC V-30 microprocessor; new DMA,
  bus controller and timer chips as necessary; and software that moves
  the ROM BIOS and hard disk BIOS into RAM, and also changes the memory
  refresh rate.

  Bill explained that the AT&T 6300 is assembled with parts that meet
  specification, but they are not "dynamically optimized".  Some
  motherboards may have the same revision letter but still use different

  The systems are tested before conversion to check relative
  performance.  The soldered-in chips are professionally removed, and
  sockets are installed.  Then high speed componentry is installed.  If
  it all meets spec, the software is added.  The system is then tested
  for final benchmarks.  As part of the conversion process, any
  deficiencies in hard disk setup are found and corrected, and several of
  the modifications are specifically designed to increase hard disk
  throughput.

  The Mark 8 conversion is available now at $225.00, and Bill claims a
  typical benchmark speed increase of about 20% with actual throughput
  approximately doubled (depending on application and hard disk).  Both
  the Mark 10 and the Mark 11.5 conversions are under development,
  probably due in mid-March.
   
  The Mark 10 conversion, which is planned to increase throughput by a
  factor of approximately 7 times, will go for an estimated $500.00. 
  The systems have a 1 year parts and labor warranty.  The conversion can
  be done on site, but it normally takes 7-10 working days to do a
  conversion when you ship the unit to his shop.  Contact Bill Todd for
  shipping details.  In the near future the data can be downloaded from a
  the mailing list or for more information.

  Bruce MacKenzie from SOTA spoke about the SOTA Mothercard 5.0A.  He
  briefly explained EMS, EEMS, and protected mode operation with an
  80286 system, and how these hardware features will affect a user's
  ability to run new software and operating systems.  The main features
  of the SOTA card are:

  1) full compatibility with the AT&T 6300, standard DOS applications,
  and networks; 2) the ability to run OS/2 and other protected mode
  systems, such as ORACLE; 3) the ability to access up to 16 Mbytes of
  extended memory (non-paged) 16-bit RAM; and 4) a significant speed
  increase due to the 80286 microprocessor.  The "A" version of the
  Mothercard 5.0 was designed specifically for the PC6300 to meet the
  requirements of several large government agencies.  Installation
  involves the running of a specially designed 2.2 ft. impedance matched
  shielded cable from the SOTA card to the 8086 socket on the bottom of
  the 6300 motherboard, and transferring the 8086 to the new card.

  Bruce demonstrated the operation of IBM OS/2 on a 6300 with the SOTA
  card installed.  One of the neat tricks that SOTA has come up with
  is a programmable AT ROM BIOS to keep up with whatever tricks
  machines.  The card runs at 10 Mhz, with a 12.5 MHz version
  in the works.  With a 10 Mhz SOTA card installed, a PC6300 runs
  about 20% faster than an 8 MHz IBM AT.  At the moment, switching
  between 80286 and 8086 mode requires a re-boot.  

  In 80286 mode, original PC6300 memory is used only by utility software
  -- normal program operation takes place in the SOTA card's own RAM. 
  There is a spare connector on the card that SOTA intends to use for
  connection to a 16-bit hard disk controller card they will manufacture. 
  List price:  $895 for the 10 MHz card, $995 for the 12.5 MHz version
  (a 10% discount is available to User Group members through Todd PC3).

  ****************

  We are looking for programs for meetings in June, July, August. 
  Please call with your ideas.  Your President is taking a close look at
  have a new subscription plan ($12/year) for out-of-state readers who
  are not members.  Individuals will be contacted by letter before they
  are dropped from the mailing.  The 13th West Coast Computer Faire is
  coming up April 7-10.  We will participate in the event with a booth,
  and badges to see the Faire for members who help at the booth, as last
  year.  Call the Joe, or Kevin Newman for details.
  
  We will have election of officers in June, with nominations starting
  at the May meeting.  Consider taking a spot on the Executive
  (steering) Committee.  Anyone interested in attending an Executive
  Committee meeting or having an item discussed at the meeting should
  contact me quickly.  I hope to get the EC together before the March
  meeting.  

  Scanning other user group's publications can be interesting and
  entertaining.  The Sacramento PC Users is one of the largest in the
  West (2000+) and has an impressive publication, Sacra Blue.  The Editor
  recently happened across an old, unopened, dust-covered box of Dysan
  DD/DD floppies at a Davis office supply store.  The price? Only
  $85.00.  This sort of believe-it-or-not is just the opposite of the
  kind of consumer action report I'd like to see shared here in the
  newsletter: if you find a good buy or exceptional service in an area
  shop, pass the word along to the readers!

  I can't resist a magazine subscription or the rack at Crown Books. 
  Have you discovered PC RESOURCE yet? Not only have they plugged our
  group and reviewed the 6300 (Clone Report, Feb 88), they always have
  great do-it-yourself tips on hardware -- disk drive maintenance (Sep),
  drive alignment (Nov), installing a 3.5" drive (Jan), memory chip
  additions and the Mothercard from SOTA (Feb).  This magazine has
  articles on software, new products, programming, applications, industry
  news -- written so that even a novice can get into the subject. 
  There's DOS handbook reference cards bound into most issues.  The

  USER GROUP TECH-TIPS #6
  L.J.(Larry)Risner
  AT&T Tech Staff
  ***********************

  A major concern of computer owners today is how to upgrade their
  current CPU and retain as much of their investment as is possible.  In
  this article I will attempt to describe some of the benefits of
  "adding a system to a system" as well as some of the trade-offs one
  should consider.  The boards being discussed here are the i80286 &
  i80386 processor boards that can be inserted into the bus in the CPU
  housing.  

  First consider the starting point, your existing CPU.  If it is an
  AT&T PC (I am assuming for this discussion that it is an AT&T PC), the
  basic CPU meets the first test with flying colors - an adequate power
  supply.  The power supply in the PC6300 is rated at 170 watts, which
  will support even the most demanding peripheral.

  What board fits the bus?  The PC6300 as well as the PC6300+ will
  accept PC/XT compatible boards, but not AT style boards.  The 6310,
  6312 and 6386 will accept PC/XT boards, and also AT style boards. 
  Refer to your user's manual to determine your bus configuration.

  What will the board do for me?  Perhaps the best way to think of an
  "add-on" board is to consider your original system as an input/output
  device for another computer.  That is, all activity to and from the
  added CPU, regardless of how fast it is, will be to and from your
  existing system and peripherals (by the way, the biggest bottleneck for
  a CPU is it's storage media).

  So there you are.  Adding a board will give you a much more powerful
  CPU that is "wrapped" by your existing hardware.  This may not be
  at all bad depending on your reasons for adding the CPU.  If all you
  want is more horsepower and you are using applications that don't
  utilize a lot of disk access then this may be for you.  However, if you
  are into something that moves a lot of information around and through
  the bus, then you may want to consider a unit that is totally faster, a
  new machine - the decision is yours.  Here is a small list of
  comparisons:

  ADD-ON BOARD

  Memory - Limited to on-board space (4-16M max - typical)
  Power Supply - Original PC unit
  Speed - Accelerator board increase only (not entire system)
  Peripherals - Limited by bus design

  NEW MACHINE

  Memory - Limited by bus slots (16-48M max - typical)
  Power Supply - Large capacity to support added memory
  and peripheral requirements
  Speed - Higher performance bus and peripherals are in support of CPU.
  Peripherals - Total adaptability (except 32 bit slots, which differ by
  manufacturer)


  FILE MANAGERS
  Kevin Newman
  *************

  (editors note:  At the time Kevin was writing this, things looked
  pretty sad for newsletter contributions from members.  However, in the
  last several weeks, articles have started to come in, and we hope this
  is a trend.  Otherwise, I heartily endorse what Kevin is saying here.)

  It's been 7 month since my last "monthly" article.  The reason I have
  started this article in this manner (which is supposed to be
  about file managers), is that I am trying to show that I understand
  why so few of YOU have never sent in an article, come up with a
  program for the meeting, or offered to help with any of the many things
  which need to be done to keep the User Group going.  It is a pain to
  try and write these things when you aren't a writer (7 months between
  articles indicates how difficult this is for me, and when compounded
  by inherent laziness -- poof! -- 7 months).

- But try and think of what Ed has to go through to get the newsletter
  out by himself, and my laziness (and maybe yours) is rather a weak
  excuse.   What I am trying to say is that I have been rather surprised
  at the lack of enthusiasm that people show when asked to volunteer for
  any type of position in the group (such as the "enthusiasm" we all
  showed when Joe asked for volunteers for group Secretary).

  Now, I am not the one to criticize. I volunteered all right, but have
  produced less than nothing when compared to the fact that just a few
  individuals are shouldering most of the work (we all know who they
  are).  What I am trying to say is, we as a group will only survive if
  we work as a group.  Now that I've said my piece, I'll get down off my
  soapbox and cover file managers.

  Have you ever looked at the multitude of files on your hard disk and
  thought to yourself "What a mess?".  Well, if so, you are in need of a
  file manager.  A file manager is a utility that allows you to do the
  basic and not so basic manipulations that we all have to do to keep our
  hard disks organized and have some space left over.

  One quick side note:  so far I have only talked about using file
  managers on your hard disk, the reason being that with the current low
  price of hard disks I don't know of anyone other than laptop users
- without a hard disk in their computer (and the 720k floppies in
  laptops could use a file manager).

  It is true that DOS gives us ways to keep everything organized, but
  what happens when you have a directory with 240 files in it and you
  only want to delete certain ones (and you have to decide which ones to
  delete)?  This is where the file manager comes in.  There are a large
  number of different file managers that are available, but all do
  basically the same things with some doing a bit more than others.  In
  the next few paragraphs I will discuss the basic functions of most
  file managers.

  One of the most powerful feature included in almost all file managers
  is a concept known as "tagging".  The idea behind tagging is to mark
  specific files within a group allowing you to manipulate all of these
  "tagged" files as you require (i.e. delete, copy, move).  Since most
  file managers display all files in a directory in two, three, or more
  columns, "tagging" files as you move the cursor across the file
  listing is quite an easy task. 

  Another powerful feature of file managers is the ability to sort files
  so that you may look at them in different ways, such as sorted by
  date, extension, attribute and other sort keys. 
-
  One feature that I use quite often is the "move" command.  This
  command performs a pseudo file copy, but instead of actually copying
  the file to the destination (i.e. different directory), simply
  performs a rename in the File Allocation Table, effectively
  "moving" the file to the new location by assigning a new pathname
  to the file (the actual physical location of the data on the
  disk is unchanged).  There is one limitation to this command:
  it can only move files on the same physical device (i.e. files
  can be "moved" to a different directory on one hard disk, or on a
  floppy, but not from a hard disk to a floppy).

  I realize that this has been a rather brief article but you can't
  imagine the agony of just getting this out.  Hopefully as I continue
  to write, this will become easier.  
 
  (Kevin Newman is our Public Domain software librarian, and a
  knowledgeable source on available programs that make life easier for
  computer users.  I would like to add two of my favorite file manager
  functions to his list.  The "look" function (or "browse", or "scan")
  allows you to make a quick check of the contents of a file without
  having to call up the application that created the file.  Also, most
  file managers give you the ability to "rename" a file simply and
  easily from the file listing.  -ed) 


  COMPATIBLE HARDWARE
  Thomas Herzfeld
  *******************

  KEYTRONICS KB5151 KEYBOARD.  This keyboard is available as an
  alternative to the AT&T standard keyboard, which does not provide a
  separate numerical keypad and arrow keys.  It is cabled to use the
  standard AT&T keyboard input port, and behaves exactly like the AT&T
  keyboard.  The touch is excellent.  Drawbacks include lack of a mouse
  port and a small carriage return key.  The former makes it necessary
  to use the serial port for mice (see below) and the latter problem has
  generated more typos than any intoxicant.  The function keys are
  placed across the top of the keyboard, which means that the standard
  templates provided with most programs will not fit.  Special templates
  for the KB5151 are readily available for WordPerfect, and no doubt for
  other programs.

  LOGITECH C7 MOUSE.  I just obtained the latest version of this best of
  all mice.  Logitech has eliminated the external power supply, so all
  you have to do is plug it in to the serial port and load the software. 
  The touch is excellent, and the editor provided continues to improve. 
  The mouse can be configured to run on COM1 or COM2, which is more than
  can be said for the 6300's serial port.

  AST RAMPAGE BOARD (STANDARD VERSION).  I was unable to obtain the AT&T
  version of this board, because no one would acknowledge its existence
  in 1986, so I bought the 8-bit bus version.  It works perfectly, and I
  don't know how I got along without it.  It may be slower than the 16
  bit version, but I have not been bothered by any sluggishness using it
  as a virtual hard disk.

  A NOTE REGARDING THE 6300 SERIAL PORT.  It is hard-wired as COM1. 
  This becomes a major flaw when you have an internal modem which you
  want configured as COM1.  As a result of this glitch, I now own both an
  internal modem and an external modem.  The external modem is connected
  to the serial port via an A-B switch, so that I can use either the
  external modem or the mouse.  Fortunately, I have not needed both at
  the same time.


  VIRUS EPIDEMIC?
  Joe Mahoney
  ***************
  A microbiologist, I read with interest the reports on virus problems
  with PC's.  You've heard of these nasty items -- known also as Trojan
  Horses, worms, logic bombs -- tiny (a few hundred bytes) programs or
  segments that invade your diskettes or disks (!) and secretly
  replicate, eventually wrecking or erasing your data, interrupting
  entire systems, or perhaps only flashing a surprise message ("Peace or
  Earth" or the like, or worse) on the monitor.

  The San Francisco Chronicle (2-12-88) covered a MacIntosh virus that
  was spread through "infected" files on CompuServe and GEnie (hypercard
  application files, system files).  The virus creator bragged that this
  group had worked on the virus for over a year!  John Dvorak (PC
  Magazine) describes virus concerns and mentions the celebrated Lehigh
  University virus -- computing center students at that college found
  viruses widely spread throughout their public domain diskette library
  in December 87.  Earlier, AMIGA users got an infection through altered
  boot or system files on application software diskettes.

  Publications and industry spokespersons have been reluctant to cover
  this area, fearing that publicity will invite problems and ever more
  diabolical and creative sabotage.  Software developers and university
  researchers are scrambling to find ways to detect viruses and write
  utility programs, but the wicked hackers will always strive to outsmart
  'em.  Security and protection of data -- personal or corporate or
  government -- is at stake... part of our right to privacy, no?

  What do we do to protect ourselves? 

  The choices now are few.  First, wear your protect tabs ("safe-
  computing" as Dvorak calls it) to prevent unexpected program segments
  being written to your floppies.  Viruses spread from machine to
  machine within a file on a floppy or perhaps through E-mail or BBS
  systems.  Once programmed into a COMMAND.COM or other executable file,
  you may unknowingly replicate them -- a write protect precaution will
  alert you when a harmless copy, dir, or type command gives a write
  protect error.

  Back-up your files frequently.  If you discover an infection you may
  still have "safe" files in reserve.  (We do this routinely anyway,
  right?)

  Dvorak and others tell us to keep an eye on the date/time labels on
  files.  COMMAND.COM, and other .COM or .EXE files do NOT get updated
  frequently...you could print-screen and save to refer back to this data
  periodically.  Some writers say to keep an eye on file size (bytes) --
  system files should not change size unexpectedly.  Dvorak says size is
  not a good check as most viruses are small.

  Be a little reluctant to take personal diskettes into the workplace and
  chose your software carefully.  Trading programs and diskettes is a
  popular but risky business.  One peninsula computer store claims they
  got a virus when a customer brought a game disk in to try on some of
  their computers!

  Yes, "safe-computing":  use prophylaxis, and know your files and
  friends!

  EQUIPMENT REVIEW 
  Ed Ely
  ****************

  RAMSACK 16-bit Memory Board
  Computer Peripherals, Inc.

  I have been looking onto various upgrades for my PC6300 for some time,
  and I have found that while not all PC/XT compatible hardware will work
  with the AT&T machines, some of the best pieces of equipment work just
  fine, and many specifically support installation in AT&T computers. 
  The Plus HardCard and Intel AboveBoard are two examples that come to
  mind.  

  However, the fact that we sometimes have fewer choices in a given
  hardware category can mean that it is sometimes difficult to find an
  effective solution that is also inexpensive.  For example, try to get
  two floppy drives and a hard disk operating on a 6300.  Not an
  inconvenient arrangement for other machines, it is for the 6300.  We
  must install a hard disk on a card, or an external unit, typically at
  greater cost than would be the case for a standard-mount hard disk of
  similar performance.
  
  If AT&T had decided to provide the PC6300 and PC6300+ with industry
  standard 16-bit peripheral slots, instead of the AT&T proprietary
  design, there would be a lot more 16-bit peripherals that would
  support the AT&T machines.  As it is, there are very few products
  designed to take advantage of the wider data channels available on
  these computers.

  With AT&T's recent decision to discontinue the 6300, we can probably
  expect even fewer new products that will specifically support it. 
  However, there are products out there that do utilize the special
  features of the AT&T machines, and we will continue to report them as
  they come to our attention.

  Memory cards are an interesting case study.  AT&T sells an "Enhanced
  Memory Board", manufactured by AST, that uses the special AT&T 16-bit
  bus on the 6300 and 6300+, and has excellent performance.  It is a good
  product, but it is relatively expensive, and it can only be used on an
  6300 or the 6300+ (not even the 6310/6312 can use it).  Memory boards
  that utilize AT compatible 16-bit slots are not compatible due to the
  bus design.

  Many PC/XT memory boards that use the standard 8-bit slot are
  compatible with the AT&T machines, but you are limited in performance
  due to the narrower data path and lower clock speed on the 8-bit
  peripheral bus (4MHz).  Of course, many of us have opted for the AT&T
  board, or for one of the many 8-bit memory boards, and have been very
  happy with the results (big RAM-disks, print spoolers, disk caches,
  swapping programs in and out of EMS memory or even multi-tasking on a
  PC6300 with DESKview).
  
  Along comes Computer Peripherals, Inc. (CPI) and produces a memory
  board called RAMSACK.  This is a hybrid product that has the standard
  8-bit PC bus connector, the 16-bit AT bus connector, and the 16-bit
  AT&T bus connector.  Therefore, it works in 8-bit mode on a PC/XT
  compatible machine, in 16-bit mode on an AT compatible machine, and in
  16-bit mode on a PC6300.  It was originally designed to work also on a
  6300+, but that did not work out (CPI claims AT&T changed technical
  specifications on the 6300+ after it was too late for them to re-
  engineer their board).
  
  There are a minimal number of jumpers and DIP switches to check on the
  board, mostly of concern if you are going to install more than one
  RAMSACK board, but for the installation of one board, the entire
  installation setup is done through software that is run from a floppy
  disk.  The setup information is then stored in non-volatile RAM.  
  One unusual and necessary trick to the installation, that is not made
  clear anywhere in the manual, is that to install the RAMSACK for the
  16-bit bus on an AT&T machine, you must run the installation program
  while the board is plugged into an 8-bit slot.  When the installation
  program is complete, you then shut down the computer and transfer the
  board to a 16-bit slot.  This information had to be obtained from a
  phone call to CPI technical support.  They were very helpful, but such
  a major omission in the manual was not an encouraging omen.

  There were two main reasons that I wanted additional memory beyond the
  640K already on the main board.  The first was to be able to run a
  large disk cache without eating into DOS memory.  With the RAMSACK
  memory board, this has worked out wonderfully.  I use the cache
  program from MACE utilities (a licensed version of Golden Bow VCACHE),
  and it has resulted in a very substantial decrease in effective disk
  access times, as the cache program typically finds approximately 85% of
  requested data in the cache, and therefore only about 15% of disk reads
  actually go to the hard disk.  There is also a smaller saving in disk
  writes, by ignoring duplicate data.
  
  The cache operates slightly slower using EMS memory, as compared to the
  same size cache in standard DOS memory.  The "paging" requirements of
  EMS memory exact a slight penalty here.  One important note: the
  newest version of MACE utilities uses a different cache program that
  does not recognize the EMS memory on RAMSACK (so far, neither MACE nor
  CPI has come up with a satisfactory explanation).

  The second reason for the extra memory was to be able to swap programs
  in and out of expanded memory -- allowing an entire application (and
  all its data) to stay resident in expanded memory while another
  application runs in DOS memory -- and then be able to switch back and
  forth between applications.  There are several programs available that
  accomplish this -- the one I use is the shell program from WordPerfect
  Library.  So far, the program recognizes the extra memory and utilizes
  it correctly when I manually "exit to shell" from an application --
  that application is then swapped to expanded memory, and I am able to
  utilize the full 640K of DOS memory for another application (less any
  TSR programs, and the resident portion of the shell program and the
  disk cache).  The actual swapping takes place in less than a second,
  which is tremendously quicker than saving your data, exiting one
  application and then starting up a new one.

  However, I have run into problems when I attempt to use a "hot-key" to
  switch applications, which is supposed to work, and works on other
  identical systems.  When I contacted WordPerfect about the "hot-key"
  problem, they said they would obtain a RAMSACK board, put it in an
  PC6300 and try to find a fix.  A plug for WordPerfect product support -
  - they are the best I have ever encountered -- they don't just mutter
  something about hardware incompatibility, they actually seem to have an
  interest in getting things to work right, and they are well acquainted
  with AT&T machines.

  The RAMSACK board with 2 MBytes sells for $450 to $600 retail (I don't
  have the actual list price), but I have seen it priced as low as $175
  with 0K installed ($165 in quantity).  The board comes with software
  for a print spooler, RAM-disk, and disk cache (for diskettes only). 
  They do not provide a hard disk cache.  CPI also includes a SIDEKICK-
  like collection of desktop utilities which I haven't tried because it
  duplicates many of the functions I am already using with WordPerfect
  Library.

  The RAM-disk can be varied in size, but I ran up against a 64 file
  limit, regardless of the amount of memory allocated for the RAM-disk. 
  Fortunately, the DOS RAMDRIVE.SYS recognizes and uses the RAMSACK EMS
  memory, and can be set for a maximum of 1,024 root directory entries
  (DOS 3.2).  The RAMSACK board come in various standard configurations
  with up to 4 Mbytes of memory (with a plug-in daughterboard).
  There are DIP switch settings to allow unique memory addresses
  for up to four boards (if you have the slots).

  The RAMSACK memory can be used to "back-fill" conventional memory up
  to 640K, or as LIM compatible expanded memory (paged), or as extended

  SERVICE/PARTS EXCHANGE
  **********************
  
  Last month, we reported some rather remarkable exchange parts prices
  available through the AT&T Service Center in San Leandro.  Some members
  called, and received substantially different (and higher) price quotes
  over the phone.  The problem was not that the prices were wrong -- the
  telephone number was wrong.  We  inadvertently published the number
  for the Data Services Organization (AT&T DSO) in Oakland, not the San
  Leandro Service Center.

  All the DSO service depots (there are several in the Bay Area) look up
  their prices on a common data base, and whatever price is shown is what
  they have to charge.  The Service Center in San Leandro is a separate
  organization within AT&T and has a totally different pricing structure,
  and since the last newsletter, they have reduced their prices.  The
  AT&T Parts Hotline will also arrange parts exchanges, and they have yet
  another pricing structure.

  As an example, to replace a PC6300 motherboard through the Parts
  Hotline, you will end up paying something like $1,100, depending on
  the model of the motherboard and amount of RAM installed (that price
  includes a small exchange value for your old board).  If you were to
  make the exact same exchange through a DSO location, the cost would be
  in the neighborhood of $500, again depending on model and amount of
  RAM.  If you take your old board to the counter at the San Leandro
  Service Center, the cost will be $101.00 plus a $10 handling charge,
  for any PC6300 model.  

  Now this price does not apply if you bring in the whole computer and
  have them look for the problem, remove the board, make the repairs,
  and put everything back together again.  That process could very well
  cost you around $500.  Also, they do not just give you a new board in
  exchange.  You need to leave your board there, and they will attempt to
  repair it.

  If it can't be repaired, you will be given an exchange board.  Either
  way, it's the same price.  And the board you get back will have all
  the latest revisions (including ROM BIOS updates).  You won't get a
  640K board back if you give them 256K, and you won't get a CPU-3 if
  you give them a CPU1-A, but otherwise it will be completely updated
  (unless you request that it not be).

  The Service Center is located at 2200 William Street, at the corner of
  Doolittle, in San Leandro.  Their telephone number is (415) 678-1300
  (that's the correct number this time).  Business hours are
  8 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday.

  They will also accept UPS shipment, but you must contact them
  by telephone prior to shipping.
  So far, they are set up only for repairs on the PC6300 (and PC6300+).

  Here are some more examples of their exchange prices:  Keyboard
  ($35.11 + $2.00 handling); ANY supported hard disk, 10 or 20 Mbytes
  ($95.56 + $10.00 handling); power supply ($42.11 + $2.00); video card
  ($89.38 + $2.00); HD controller card ($44.24 + $2.00).  Thanks again to
  Dave Ralston, who is the supervisor for the computer repair group at
  the service center.

  In upcoming issues, we will look into the services provided by the DSO
  depots, and the various AT&T Hotlines.  If you can pinpoint your
  computer problems down to the board level, and feel comfortable with
  removing and reinstalling components in your machine, the San Leandro
  Service Center prices can't be beat.  If you need someone else to
  handle more of the job for you, the DSO depots may be more convenient
  and may be somewhat closer in price for the same work performed at the
  main service center.  However, Dave Ralston and his group may be hard
  to beat.  For more information, use your phone -- that's why God
  created AT&T.
