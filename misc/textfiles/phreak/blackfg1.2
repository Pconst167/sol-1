    Allience Teleconfrencing
    ------------------------
     Allience Teleconfrencing recently had a merger with AT&T, that means
    that it will get thougher to access it, but these set backs shall not
     stop a true phreak.
     At&t's access to Allience is 0-700-456-x00y, x=1-3, y=1 Los Angelos,
     2 Chicago, 3 White Plains, and 4 Houston. But, 0-700, is just a dummy
    number, when you dial 0-700-456-1001 for instance, it dials, KP+
             +ST. There for you can box to Allience, but there are easier
    ways, which will be discussed in the latter part of this file.
     When you dial Allience, no matter what method you use, the commands
    are the same. After contacting Allience you will hear a tone, then a
    voice will say, How Many locations do you wish ??, enter a number
    from around 1-15, it says in literature that you may have up to 51
    conferees, but I have never gotten past 25. It will then say, you
    have 12 locations (Or whatever you entered), if there isn't enough
    space, it will hang up, it there is, it will say, enter # to keep
    this and go on, or * to change this setting. Then enter # or *,
    it will say, dial the Area code, and number you wish to reach. That
    means NPA+PRE+SUFF, or international, CNTRY+NPA+PRE+SUFF. Then dial
    * to cancel the call, or # to add them to the confrence. You must
    say something to them, or it will hang them up. Then Dial # to add
    them to the confrence.
     To spice up a confrence, try adding some Directory Assistence ops,
    freak out when you add more then one, they argue who should be on
    the line. I will also provide a list of good payphone numbers at
    Disney Land.. One instance, I and Master Scorpio called one with 3
    way calling, and a mexican women answered, MS Replied "Do you have
    a green card?", the lady hung up, pretty funny. I also got numbers
    to malls. Well, that's all I got to say about it. The next file
     will explain how to access Allience for free, see if you call it
    direct without a divertor or PBX, it cost $.10 a minute per line,
    plus long distance charges. According to allience it is illeagle,
    tS but not your number, so, they can call the poble you
    dial, and check with them, but I have@1j5>    just say, sorz- but I can't
helpyou, I got a crank call, so I
    took my phone off the hook, and I guess they didn't hang up.
     There are many other ways to have confrences, such as the old
    reliable 3 way calling, bridges, or, even 3 line loops. Well,
    I have never found anything as good allience yet.

    Methods of Contacting Allience
    ------------------------------
     There are many ways to call allience for free, see, you can't
    call allience through MCI or Sprint for ovious reasons. But you
    can take and Call a Divertor, and just like say, I got a
    wrong number, and just wait, when she hangs up, you will get their
    dial tone, it routes you back to the main switchboard, and you
    get their dial tone, then you can dial where ever, sometimes the
    people don't hang up, cause they know it's a divertor, and they
    don't want a big bill. To find a divertor, look through the
    yellow pages, and look for 24 Hr doctors, vets, etc.. And to tell
    if it's one, the ring will usually change tones.
     Private Branch Exchange (PBX) are a company's number that you
    and get a dial tone, most of the time you need a code, and then
    you usually dial 9 for an outside line then 0-700, if it's a
    sprint line, dial 10288, then 0-700-456-x00y.

    Don't Call Gateway/Globe Quest. Grow up Riger Mortis.
