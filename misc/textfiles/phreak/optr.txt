OPERATOR TRICKS
-------- ------

OPERATOR TRICK #1:

DIAL 0 (FOR OPERATOR) AND SAY:

  "HELLO, THIS IS TSPS ENGINEERING.  I'D LIKE TO CONDUCT SOME TESTS
PLEASE.  PLEASE RING FORWARD TO 001 + AREA CODE + NUMBER TO CALL, HIT
NO AMA, AND RING BACK TO AREA CODE + YOUR PHONE NUMBER.  THANK YOU."



OPERATOR TRICK #2:

DIAL 0 + AREA CODE + NUMBER TO CALL.

SAY (TO THE OPERATOR):

  "HI, I'D LIKE TO CHARGE THIS IS MY HOME PHONE.  MY HOME NUMBER IS
(AREA CODE + NUMBER TO CHARGE IT TO).  THANK YOU."
  IF SHE STARTS CALLING THAT # (TO ASK IF THEY ACCEPT CHARGES), HANG
UP AND DO IT AGAIN.  ONE OUT OF FIVE TIMES, YOU'LL GET AN OPERATOR
DUMB ENOUGH TO DO IT.



CHECK FOR TRACED LINE
----- --- ------ ----

DIAL 415-284-1111 OR 617-890-9900.

  IF YOU GET A TONE THAT GOES UP SLOWLY, THEN DOES IT OVER AND OVER,
THEN THE LINE IS NOT BEING TRACED.

  IF IT GOES UP AND STAYS UP, HANG UP FAST.  IT IS BEING TRACED
