Introduction:
------------
  This phile will deal with accessing, understanding and using the Alliance
Teleconferencing Systems....  it has many sections and for best use should be
printed out...enjoy...


Alliance:
--------
  Alliance Teleconferencing is an independant company which allows the general
public to access and use it's conferencing equipment.

  Many rumors have been floating around that Alliance is a subsidary of AT&T.
Well, they are wrong.  As stated above, Alliance is an entirely independant
company.  They use sophisticated equipment to allow users to talk to many people
at once.

The Number:
--- ------
  Alliance is in the 700 exchange, thus it is not localized, well, not in a way.
Alliance is only in certain states, and only residents of these certain states
can access by dialing direct.  This, however, will be discussed in a later
chapter.  The numbers for alliance are as follows:

	0-700-456-1000 (chicago)
		 -1001 (los angeles)
		 -1002 (chicago)
		 -1003 (houston)
		 -2000 (?)
		 -2001 (?)
		 -2002 (?)
		 -2003 (?)
		 -3000 (?)
		 -3001 (?)
		 -3002 (?)
		 -3003 (?)

  The locations of the first 4 numbers are known and i have stated them.
However, the numbers in the 200x and 300x are not definately known.  Rumor has
it that the pattern repeats itself but this has not been proven.

Dialing:
-------
  As stated before, Alliance is only in certain stated and only these states can
access them via dialing direct.  However, dialing direct causes your residence
to be charged for the conference and conference bills are not low!!!  Therefore,
many ways have been discovered to start a conference without having it billed to
ones house.  They are as follows:

     1) Dialing through a PBX
     2) Incorporating a Blue Box
     3) Billing to a loop
     4) Billing to a forwarded call

  I am sure there are many more but these are the four i will deal with.


Dialing through a PBX:
------- ------- - ---
  Probably the easiest method of creating a free conference is through a PBX.
Simply call one in a state that has Alliance, input the PBX's code, dial 9 for
an outside line and then dial alliance.

  An example of this would be:


PBX: 800-241-4911

  When it answers it will give you a tone.  At this tone input your code.

Code: 1234

  After this you will receive another tone, now dial 9 for an outside line.  You
will now hear a dial tone.

  Simply dial Alliance from this point and the conference will be billed to the
PBX.



Using a Blue Box:
----- - ---- ---
  Another rather simple way of starting a conference is with a Blue Box.  The
following procedure is how to box a conference:

  Dial a number to box off of.	In this example we will use 609-609-6099

  When the party answers hit 2600hz.  This will cause the fone company's
equipment to think that you have hung up.  You will hear a <beep><kerchunk> You
have now 'seized' a trunk.  After this, switch to multi-frequency and dial:

  KP-0-700-456-x00x-ST

KP=KP tone on Blue Box
x=variable between 1 and 3
ST=ST tone on Blue Box

  The equipment now thinks that the operator has dialed Alliance from her
switchboard and the conference shall be billed there.  Since Blue Boxing is such
a large topic, this is as far as I will go into it's uses.


Billing to a loop:
------- -- - ----
  A third method of receiving a free conference is by billing it to a loop.  A
loop is 2 numbers that when two people call, they can talk to each other.
You're saying woop tee do right?  Wrong!  Loops can be <very> usefull to
phreaks.  First, dial alliance direct.	After going through the beginning
procedure, which will be discussed later in this tutorial, dial 0 and wait for
an Alliance operator.  When she answers tell her you would like to bill the
conference to such and such a number.  (A loop where your phriend is on the
other side) She will then call that number to receive voice verification.

  Of course your phriend will be waiting and will accept the charges.  Thus, the
conference is billed to the loop.


Billing to call forwarding:
------- -- ---- ----------

     When you dial a number that is
 call forwarded, it is first answered
 by the original location, then
 forwarded.  The original location
 will hang up if 2600hz is received
 from only one end of the line.

  Therefore, if you were to wait after
 the forwarded residence answered, you
 would receive the original location's
 dial tone.

     Example:

Dial 800-325-4067

  The original residence would answer, then forward the call, a second type of
ringing would be heard.  When this second residence answers simply wait until
they hang up.  After about twenty seconds you will then receive the original
residence's dial tone since it heard 2600hz from one end of the line.  Simply
dial Alliance from this point and the conference will be billed to the original
residence.

  These are the four main ways to receive a free conference.  I am sure many
more exist, but these four are quite handy themselves.


Logon Procedure:
----- ---------

  Once Alliance answers you will hear a two-tone combination.  This is their way
of saying 'How many people do you want on the conference dude?' Simply type in a
2-digit combination, depending on what bridge of Alliance you are on, between 10
and 59.  After this either hit '*' to cancel the conference size and inout
another or hit '#' to continue.

  You are now in Alliance Teleconferencing and are only seconds away from having
your own roaring conference going strong!!!


Dialing in Conferees:
------- -- ---------
  To dial your first conferee, dial 1+npa+pre+suff and await his/her answer.

npa=area code
pre=prefix
suff=suffix

  If the number is busy, or if no one answers simply hit '*' and your call will
be aborted.  But, if they do answer, hit the '#' key.  This will add them to the
conference.

  Now commence dialing other conferees.


Joining Your Conference:
------- ---- ----------
  To join your conference from control mode simply hit the '#' key.  Within a
second or two you will be chatting with all your buddies.  To go back into
control mode, simply hit the '#' key again.


Transferring Control:
------------ -------
  To transfer control to another conferee, go into control mode, hit the #
6+1+npa+pre+suff of the conferee you wish to give control to.

  If after, you wish to abort this transfer hit the '*' key.

  <note>:Transfer of control is often not available.  When you receive a message
stating this, you simply cannot transfer control.


Muted Conferences:
----- -----------
  To request a muted conference simply hit the 9 key.  I am not exactly sure
what a muted conference is but it is probably a way to keep unwanted
eavesdroppers from listening in.


Dialing Alliance Operators:
------- -------- ---------
  Simply dial 0 as you would from any fone and wait for the operator to answer.


Ending Your Conference:
------ ---- ----------
  To end your conference all together, that is kick everyone including yourself
off, go into control mode and hit '*'...after a few seconds simply hang up.
Your conference is over.


Are Alliance Operators Dangerous?
--- -------- --------- ---------
  No.  Not in the least.  The worst they can do to you while you are having a
conference is drop all conferees including yourself.  This is in no way harmful,
just a little aggravating.


Alliance and Tracing:
-------- --- -------
  Alliance can trace, as all citizens of the United States can.  But this has to
all be pre-meditated and AT&T has to be called and it's really a large hastle,
therefore, it is almost never done.  Alliance simply does not want it known that
teenagers are phucking them over.  The only sort of safety equipment Alliance
has on-line is a simple pen register.  This little device simply records all the
numbers of the conferees dialed.  No big deal.	All Alliance can do is call up
that persons number, threaten and question.  However, legally, they can do
nothing because all you did was answer your fone.

  <note>:Almost all instructions are told to the person in command by Alliance
recordings.  A lot of this tutorial is just a listing of those commands plus
information gathered by either myself or the phellow phreaks of the world!!!
