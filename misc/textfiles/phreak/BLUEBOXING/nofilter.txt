I have inbteresting info for all phreaks around the world, right now i have
broken through the international country blockade, you know blue box filter,
yeah i have !!!!


Well, incase you not sure of what i mean, allow me to explain ...


OTC's around the world have decided that they have had enough of international
blue boxing, but i still think its a great idea. Well, i was mucking around
with tones, R1 tones to be precise, yes MF freqs, and i discovered something
that literally opens the doors to all phreaks.



Well, normall this is hwo you would dial someone ...

	DIAL INTERNATIONAL:	KP2 + COUNTRY CODE + 0 + AREA CODE + NUMBER
	DIAL LOCAL/NATIONAL:	KP1 + 0 + AREA CODE + NUMBER

	Well, i have discovered a new method of dialing, and here it is,
	dedicated to all phreaks around the world ...

	DIAL INTERNATIONAL:	KP2 + KP2 + COUNTRY CODE + AREA CODE + NUMBER
	DIAL LOCAL/NATIONAL:	KP1 + KP1 + AREA CODE + NUMBER

NOTE: you must omit the 0 when dialing this method !!!



Mow people, this gives you better lines than satelites, i have never ever, 
connected via international Mf freqs without MNP, however, this method allows
you to get the clearest most possible lines, truelly operator quality, its
like owning a BANG & OLUFSEN BEOSYSTEM !!!

Please spread this info for all phreaks ...

I have not had enough time to muck around more with this new info, but i am sure
that it would be helpfiul to my collegues in AUS, however, not sure about them
interantional dudes ...

Hey, this works perfectly for me, good luck phreaks ...
