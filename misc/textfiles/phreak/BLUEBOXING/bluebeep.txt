ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  Yo everybody,
  
  I am proud to be able to present you the latest, the one and only, the
  unbelievable, innocent, colorful, phun-philled BlueBEEP, version 0.07á !
  
  Released on the HoHoCon '93 party held in Austin, TX winter 1993.
  
  This version is nothing that a BlueBEEP that has less bugs, is more
  compatible, and has more "little goodie" options to make your life
  easier. A good example is the ALT-W (Worldtime) in the dialer. No
  "major" features have been added, as I just cannot SEE any features
  which I could add. Well, I could write a NUA attacker, a war dialer,
  or something like that and add it in, but there are already very good
  programs available for this purpose (eg. if you are looking for a good
  wardialer, try ToneLoc). I could also have been writing nonsense features
  (like a Tic-Tac-Toe in the dialbutton window of the dialer), but what
  is it good for? Nuttin. This is a solid, working, almost bug-free,
  comfortable and good-looking dialer. Chew it.
  
  (If you find a feature you would like to see added, send mail, and
   I bet a million dollars that I will add it in, because there is
   nothing else to do on this thing.)
  
  Basically, this release is a complete miracle, because somewhen in
  September, every programmer's nightmare, a total devastation, the coders
  personal horror show, a digital asassin took place in my tiny apartment
  in the nice peaceful city of Hamburg, Germany. A trojan horse unleashed
  its evil power and sent both of my hard drives to eternity, to the
  hunting grounds of all bits, to HELL.
  
  After falling to the floor and struggling with unconciousness for at least
  2 hours, I realized that everything was gone. 212848274 bytes free. I
  grabbed for the coke can, and it fell. To the wrong place. The sticky
  liquid soaked the desk, and, the backup disks. General Failure, Abort,
  Retry, commit Suicide? was the message I got when I tried to PkUnzip (R)
  the files on the backup disk. The horror. The horror.
  
  Then, I got all pissed off. I decided to get a life, not to hang around on
  the keyboard 25 hours a day, trying to win the fight of the humans against
  the computers and telcos. But, Onkel Dittmeyer would not be Onkel
  Dittmeyer, if I would not have been lusting for a compiler and an editor
  after a couple weeks. So, I blew the dust off the keyboard, fired up my
  machine, and tried to seize parts of the source code from the physical
  cylinders of my trusty drive. The result was a 5,9 MB large file called
  ASH.BIN that contained about 25000 lines of pascal source, fragmented,
  shattered, plus millions of control characters, parts from zip files,
  and other junk.
  
  I made my way through this garbage. A couple weeks, $600 on pizza home
  delivery, and one School-You-Are-Fired letter later, BlueBEEP was back in
  a hardly compilable shape. That got me high. I did it. 48 hours of non-
  stop programming later, BlueBEEP was back in the shape where I had it
  before the trojan asassin took place. I looked at the calendar on the
  wall. November 9th, 1993. I looked over to the desk. And I saw it.
  The ticket. SCANDINAVIAN SAS, HAM-LAX, 12/01/93, 0845. In less than
  three weeks I would be on my way to california, and I should have
  BlueBEEP ready to be released at the HoHoCon 3 weeks later in Texas.
  No way I could program any further after 12/01/93, 0845. This was my
  deadline. I glanced at my watch, and soaked in the tasty smoke from the
  joint in my left hand. Lets go for it.
  
  November 11th, the thrill came to a new max. My mom returned from her
  3-week spain vacation, which she payed with money she stole me. That
  raised my motivation like shit. It really gets you highly agressive
  and motivated if you are staying with someone where you know, that she
  will steal all your cash and sell your equipment if you go out for dinner.
  
  Agressivity. That is the key word. Agressivity that causes a lion to
  survive. Just like me. A line of coke. Ahhh. Onkel Dittmeyer on his
  highest point of agressivity, motivation to kill. Or code, whatever way
  you might put this. Eliminating bugs. Asassinating slack code. And
  anything else that comes into my way. Groooan, I said, and put "Killing
  Season" into my DAT tape deck. 777-095. "Sorry, we dont have pizza
  with ripped-off baby heads, sir." Phuckups. Where's my M-60? Lets kill
  this though, back to work. The Major Threat of the telcos is back, and
  more fucking evil than ever before.

  So we are pretty close to hit the 10,000 lines barrier...
  

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Frequencies - The technical aspect, or "whats that noise?"
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  Okay, when you are not clear how a "trunk" is set up, you should read
  on here. Well, it's rather simple. You have 5 values in each line, these
  are:
             Freq-1  Freq-2  Freq-3  Lenght  Delay
              (Hz)    (Hz)    (Hz)    (ms)    (ms)
  
  Freq1-3 will be overlaid (played at the same time) for a length of "Len"
  milliseconds, followed by a pause (silence) of "Delay" milliseconds.
  After this is done, it will proceed to the next line. If the next line is
  empty, it's done, got it ?
  
  With the dial sets, its just the same. It plays Freq1+2+3 for Len mili-
  seconds, and then delays for the time you have set as the "dial speed"
  in Action Mode.  The dial speed can be modified by pressing Cursor Left
  and Right in Action Mode.
  
  The Frequencies are generated through the FM chipset on your adlib
  compatible sound card, again, the credits for the adlib frequency output
  goes to Urmel.  There are no program-internal sinus tables, like in Blue
  Dial, that just slow down all the shit stuff, the frequency generation
  is handled 100% by the adlib sound card.
  
  Compatible cards that will also work are:
  
  - AdLib
  - AdLib Gold
  - all SoundBlaster and SoundBlaster Pro/Pro16 models
  - AudioBlaster, all models
  
  Thats it! I don't think that this is a big deal because adlib cards can
  be bought for $20, and you should buy one real quick.
  
  I personal like the SB/16 ASP most. 44k, Stereo, and feature-packed.
  

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Usage - How to use this shit, keys, hints, etc.
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  Most of the functions are self-explaining for a real phreak, so
  you should find out the most stuff yourself without having any
  trouble. Watch the bottom line of the screen while wandering
  through the menus, some useful information is often displayed there.
  
  The DialTranslation feature should be also known; it works like
  in BlueDial (Great Job, Casanova!). Just put a %x to put part x
  of the number in, &x for part x to the end of the number. All
  characters will be passed on as-is; spaces will be ignored.
  
  So far for that. Now for the keys. Try it all out, and memorize
  them carefully, because I did not waste much time putting online
  help into the program. For example, in Action Mode only 10% of the
  available features are acutally displayed on screen. Just read on.
  
  In Action Mode, use the following keys:
  
    0..1                for digits
    A..H                for operator codes
    +                   for trunk
    ENTER               for current number
    F1                  to load new trunk, edit trunks in SETUP menu
    F2                  to load new dial set, edit dialsets in SETUP menu
    F5                  to take the hardware device off/onhook
    F6                  to switch play/record mode on hardware device
    F7                  to switch phone on/off on
    F8                  to hangup everything if you have device & phone
    F10                 for QUICK EXIT (to your terminal program maybe)
    CurLft/Rt           to change dial speed
    CurUp/Dn            to select a new number
    ESC                 to return to the main menu
    SPACE               to edit the current phone number
    Del                 to delete the current phone number
    P                   to pulse-dial the current phone number
    S                   to see debug status info
    ALT-M               to toggle device play/rec auto switching
    ALT-W               to see the World Time (set correct timezone 1st!)
    W                   to say "Please Wait", I found this to be useful
    Q                   to record quick sample
    R                   to replay quick sample
    M                   to modem-dial the current number
    ALT-S               to sort the phone book alphabetically
  
  
  In Scanning Mode, the stuff is sent in the following format:
  
  BEFORESTRING+SCANSTUFF+AFTERSTRING
  
  Got it ? If you turn AutoIncrease ON, the scanner will raise
  the scan by one every time you press ENTER, if not, you will
  have to do this yourself by pressing Cursor Up/Down.
  
  In CardTalker Mode, use the following keys:
  
    F1     talks " I would like to make a call using my AT&T calling card "
    F2     talks " I would like to make a call using my MCI calling card "
    F3     talks " I would like to make a call using my Sprint Phonecard "
    F4     talks " The number I'm calling is "
    F5     talks the card number you can edit with F9
    F6     talks the fone number you can edit with F10
    F7     talks " I would like to place this call collect. "
    F8     talks " You're nothing more than a bucket of boiling shit! "
    F9     edits the current card number that's sent by pressing F5
    F10    edits the current fone number that's sent by pressing F6
    ESC    leaves CardTalker Mode
  
  In Frequency Tester, use the following keys:
  
    1-5, Q-T       Modify Clear Forward
    A-F, Y-V       Modify Seize
    F1-F4          Set Step Rate to 1, 3, 5 and 20 Hz
    F5             Play trunk that is current in Action Mode
    F6             Saves current settings into a selectable trunk
    F7             On-The-Fly modification of whole break sequence
    F8             Reset Trunk to "normal" trunk
    F9             Zero Out Clear Forward
    F10            Zero Out Seize
    Space          Edit Quick Test Number
    Enter          Send Quick Test Number
  
  In Terminal mode, use the following keys:
  
    ALT-E          Toggle local echo
    ALT-H          Hangup the modem (DTR drop)
    ALT-L          Open or close a log file
    ALT-X          Exit
    ALT-Z          little help screen

 The Mouse - Stories about squeaky, gross things
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  Just Left-Click an menu item to open it.
  Right-Click to close a menu, the right mouse button does almost the
  same as the ESC key.
  
  In Action mode, you can use the mouse to leftclick the numbers and
  special keys to sound the tones, just like pressing the key itself.
  If you want to click at function keys, click the function key number
  in brackets.  You can also select new numbers by clicking at them.
  Clicking the [Scroll Up] and [Scroll Down] buttons on the bottom of
  the screen lets you scroll through the numbers. If you click at the
  [CR] sign the current number is automatically dialed, just like the
  key would do itself. To quit, either click the right mouse button
  or click at the [ESC] sign in the bottom line of the screen.
  
  In CardTalker mode, the mouse movement is locked to the function box,
  just click on the line of the function you wish to use, or rightclick
  to exit.
  
  In this document reader, use the Left & Right buttons to scroll up and
  down in the text. To quit reading, press both buttons at once.
  
  By the way, I programmed the whole user interface myself, I used nothing
  like toolboxes, or third-party TPUs. Everything and everything except the
  adlib sound routines are my work, so if you encounter bugs with the user
  interface tell me and it will be fixed. If you are a programmer and want
  to use my user interface or parts of it, send me a mail.
  

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 Parameters - Command Line Parameters
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  BlueBEEP offers several command line parameters to make things easier.
  Here is a detailed list:
  
   /?            Shows avaiable command line parameters
   /(C)          Displays source code information
   /A            Starts the program in Action Mode
   /S            Starts the program in Scanning Mode
   /R            Starts the program in Red Box Mode
   /T            Starts the program in CardTalker Mode
   /F            Starts the program in Frequency Tester Mode
   /C            Starts the program in CardChecker Mode *regged only*
   /TERM         Starts the program in tiny terminal mode
   /NOMODEM      Disables the modem usage, overrides the config
   /NOMOUSE      Disables mouse usage, even if a mouse is present
   /DEBUG        Displays some debugging info
   /EXEC <fn>    Executes BSLI script file <fn>
  
  That's it so far. You cannot combine /A, /S, /R, /T, /F, /C and /TERM.
  The options /NOMOUSE and /NOMODEM can be combined with any other command
  line parameters.
  
  You cannot combine /NOMODEM and /TERM, you idiot !
  
  Note that you cannot use parameters when you have the password
  protection on; this is a security feature.
  

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 The hardware - The BlueBEEP Pulse Dialing Hardware
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  From now, you can pulse dial with BlueBEEP, send the tones
  DIRECTLY into the phone line, and many more. You can
  powerdial at speeds never seen before...sounds k-rad huh?
  
  All you need is a little piece of hardware that you have to
  connect to your parallel port (printer port) and to your joy-
  stick port (that's where it gets that 5V+ power that it needs
  to operate). Then plug it into the blaster and the phone line..
  
  If you are an elite phreaker and interested in that device,
  email me for an assembly instruction or a ready-to-plug
  device.
  
  For all people that already have one, one quick note.
  The german phone system can handle up to 35/30/300 timings,
  but the TELEKOM will probably notice that you are powerdialing
  and kick your ass, so use the defaults (50/50/500).
  
  When pulse dialing, 1-9 are 1-9 tacks,
                      0    is 10 tacks,
                      A    is 11 tacks,
                      B    is 12 tacks,
                      C    is 13 tacks,
                      D    is 14 tacks,
                      E    is 15 tacks,
                      F    is 16 tacks,
                      G    is 17 tacks and
                      H    is 18 tacks.
  
  You can use tacks over 10 to access the military phone system.
  By the way, holding down the "O" button and listening to the
  clicking relays is fun, but will fuck up your relays with the time.
  
  For the HOOK relay we recommend you to use a high-quality relay,
  because this is the most-used part in the device.
  
  A soldering plan for the device is under development and will be
  published in one of the next releases.
  
  If you are into electronics and soldering, then you could just make
  a little device with some relais on it. You should make Relay 0 control
  the hook switch, Relay 1 control the play/rec condition of the phone
  line transmitter, and let toggle relay 2 the phone/device switch.
  You can then connect the device to any serial port and set it up in
  the Setup/Pulse Dialing menu.
  
  By the way, we have another cool device in development that can detect
  incoming touch-tones as well. Means, you can use BlueBEEP as your ans-
  werring machine, or as your own voice mail system. Killer? Killer!

 Script Language - Instructions on the BlueBEEP Script Language (BSLI)
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   The BSLI Script Language
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
  BSLI is BlueBEEP's script language, that means that it is a tiny pro-
  gramming language that can access all major functions of BlueBEEP just
  by typing a little text. It is very powerful, or at least: It WILL become
  powerful, after it was thrown back due to the big crash, and I was lacking
  the time to finish it till HoHoCon.
  
  Okay. Lets talk about the script format. Each command is a line of text.
  Each blank line or a line starting with a ; symbol will be ignored,
  just like it wouldn't be there. Each other line is interpreted as code.
  
  To run a BSLI script, call one of this commands:
  
          BSLI <scriptname>
          BLUEBEEP EXEC <scriptname>
  
  where <scriptname> is the file name of the script you want to execute.
  The BSLI.EXE is much smaller and handy if you want to give your scripts
  away without the person having the full BlueBEEP at their hands.
  
  Commands
  
  Valid commands for the scripts are:
  
  CLEAR_SCREEN
    This will clear the screen and put the cursor in the top left position.
  
  WRITE <text>
    This will write the string <text> on screen.
  
  WRITELN <text>
    This will write the string <text> on screen and proceed to the
    next line.
  
  DIAL <number>
    This will dial the number <number> without any dial translation
    appearing to it, regardless to the DTL_Ineffect value. Valid characters
    in the number are 0123456789ACBDEFGH, other characters will just be
    ignored. Dialing will occur using the current dial set and -speed.
  
  DELAY <miliseconds>
    This will halt (delay) the computer for the given time of
    <miliseconds>, eg. DELAY 5000 would wait 5 seconds and proceed
    with the next line in the script.
  
  CHANGE_DIALSET <dialsetname>
    This will change the current dialset to <dialsetname> by loading
    the corresponding dial set from BLUEBEEP.SET and activating it. For
    example if you put DTMF after it it would switch BlueBEEP into touch
    tone mode. This is not case sensitive. Selecting an nonexisting dial
    set will result in a fatal error and cancellation of the script.
  
  CHANGE_TRUNK <trunkname>
    This will change the current trunk (break tone) to <trunkname>.
    Almost the same as CHANGE_DIALSET.
  
  FAST_EXIT
    This will exit the script to DOS at once. Almost the same as pressing
    F10 while in Action Mode.
  
  WAIT_ENTER
    This will wait for the ENTER key to be pressed. No text will be
    displayed. If you want to notify the user of your actions first,
    be sure to put a WRITE statement in the above line.
  
  PLAY_TRUNK
    This will play the currently loaded trunk; same as hitting +.
    Note that the last used trunk will be saved on exit and loaded as
    default when you run either BlueBEEP or BSLI.
  
  MODEM_DIAL <number>
    This will dial the <number> on the modem, corresponding to the
    current modem settings (pulse/tone) and the presence of a modem.
    You do NOT have to specify anything like ATDT; BSLI will do it auto-
    magically.
  
  MODEM_DROP_DTR
    This will drop the DTR on the modem line and will abort any dialing
    in progress.
  
  MODEM_RAISE_DTR
    This will raise the DTR on the modem line.
  
  SEND_TONE <f1> <f2> <f3> <length>
    This will send tone <f1>,<f2>,<f3> for <length> miliseconds,
    if you need delay between the tones, take advantage of the DELAY
    routine.
  
  That's it so far! I am currently working on variables and new commands,
  so you can be sure that you get something to play with when I release
  the soon-to-come BlueBEEP V0.08 in the next couple of weeks!
  
  Enjoy!
