letter, stop reading NOW! Those of you who are SMART and dont want to end
up with your ass in jail and/or BIG fines, continue reading!

The truth is, that some guyz in France has got busted for the single reason
of BlueBoxing! The punishment to one of them was 12 days improsonment and
$100.000 in fines!! The telecoms are cooperating to get the ones left using
it, i.e the French-German-English telecoms and maybe Swedish one too! So!
If you are smart, then you QUIT CALLING NOW! If not.. Dont say you didn't
have the chance to do it! I myself have been calling quite a lot, but from
this day, I am out of it! I have seen many letters trying to scare lamers
off, but this one is for real! So.. OK, this is for all my phreaking
friends! Take care guyz, you'll need it! Signing off / Willy

PS. To those of you who think you are safe using AT&T cards, the facts are that
the AT&T are pretty pissed on the hackers using it now! One example is that
they have started to call up the persons beeing called with an old or
overused CallingCard to check who the person was that called them! So.. You
smart = Stop the AT&T too!
