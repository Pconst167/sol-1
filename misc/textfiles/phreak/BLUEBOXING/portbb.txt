DIAGRAM #2 SHOULD CONNECT TO THE RIGHT OF DIAGRAM #1, MY 40 CHARACTER DISPLAY 
REQUIRES I CUT IT OFF HERE. IF YOU CUT A PRINTOUT OF #2 OUT AND PLACE IT 
TO THE RIGHT OF #1 THEY SHOULD MATCH UP PERFECTLY. DIAGRAM #3 IS THE SCHEMATIC 
FOR THE POWER SUPPLY. 1 AND 2 OF COURSE ARE THE BOX ITSELF.

(A) CONNECT THE OUTPUT FROM THE POWER 
    SUPPLY HERE. 
(B) 8038 WAVEFORM GENERATOR 
(C) .010F MYLAR CAPACITOR 
(D) 82K RESISTOR (YOU WILL HAVE TO USE 
    2 OR MORE IN SERIES.)(RESISTENCE IS 
    ADDITIVE IN SERIES.) 
(E) 100K RESISTOR (5% IS BEST.) 
(F) 741 OP-AMPLIFIER

(F) 276-007  (H) 272-1065 (J) 276-1778 
(K) 272-131  (L) 271-019  (M) 271-019 
(/) 275-1547 (V) 276-1122 
 
 
THE SPOT ON THE DIAGRAM THAT HAS 700, 900, ETC. SHOULD BE FILLED IN WITH A 25K 
MULTI-TURN POTENTIOMETER (VARIABLE RESISTOR). THE 15-TURN POT FROM RADIO 
SHACK (#271-340) WILL WORK IF A 1/4 WATT, 5%, 5K RESISTOR IS PUT IN SERIES. 
 
THE EASIEST WAY TO TUNE THE BOX IS TO PLAY BOTH IT AND A SAMPLE OF THE TRUE 
SOUND TOGETHER, THEN ADJUST THE BOX UNTIL ONLY 1 NOTE CAN BE HEARD. AS 
INACCURATE AS THIS SOUNDS, THIS IS MORE THAN ACCURATE ENOUGH FOR THE FONE 
COMPANY. THE APPLE WITH AN APPLE CAT MODEM, THE ATARI, THE COMMODORE, AND THE 
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS CAN ALL GENERATE THE NEEDED TONES. 
 
THESE PLANS ARE BASED ON A SET OF PLANS I (FORD PREFECT) RECEIVED TWO YEARS 
AGO. THEY WERE ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THE POWER SUPPLY INCLUDED OUTDATED PARTS. 
THE TOTAL COST IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE $50 BUT WHEN PROPERLY ASSEMBLED IT WILL WORK 
PERFECTLY. (THESE PLANS HAVE BEEN FIELD TESTED!)
