  NOTE TO ALL:THIS IS AN ORIGINAL PHILE
FROM THE OSUNY BBS(NOW DEFUNCT)...IT IS
STILL A VERY COMMONPLACE FILE, AND MANY
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DO HAVE A
PRINTUP OF THIS FILE...IF YOU WERE EVER
CAUGHT WITH A COPY OF THIS PHILE, I
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA NOR GRASP OF
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE..ALSO
NOTE THAT IT IS AN OLD HARDWARE TYPE
FILE...UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED
IN BUILDING ONE, AND CAN ACCEPT THE
CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CAUGHT WITH A
HARDWARE BLUE BOX(OUTLINED ON D1'S
"PHREAKERS RIGHTS") THEN DO NOT TAKE 
THIS FILE AND TRY TO USE IT...IT CAN
CERTAINLY MEAN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE 
FOR YOU....

THIS IS THE TONE MATRIX FOR A BOX WHICH GENERATES
TONES THAT OPERATORS USE TO DIAL..ROTARY WORKS AS WELL,
ON OPERATOR LINES, BUT THIS IS TECHNOLOGICAL(!).
NOW I AGREE WITH THE OPINION OF A WELL KNOWN PHREAK
THAT 'BOXING' IS/WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART DEAD, BUT
THIS IS TRADITION... FIRST,YOU DIAL DIR.ASST, OR AN OPER. ETC,
THEN YOU BLAST THE LINE WITH A 2600HZ TONE. THIS GIVES YOU THE
LINE, THIS IS ALSO HOW MA BELL TRACKS DOWN BLUE BOXERS...
Press [RETURN]                  THERE  ARE 2600HZ DETECTORS SYSTEMS, AND
EVEN ON OLD #4 CROSSBARS... ONCE ON A OPER.TRUNK LINE,
YOU USE YOUR BLUE BOX/ROTARY TO DIAL...
SO,  IF YOU USE 2600HZ, WHICH IS NECESSARY, UNLESS YOU
ARE *VERY* CAREFUL, YOU WILL BE SNAGGED.
FINALLY, THIS IS WHAT YOU READ!SO LONG AND HARD FOR:

      :  900  : 1100  : 1300  :  1500 : 1700  :
USE KP TO START A CALL, AND ST TO STOP, WITH
THE BELOVED 2600HZ TONE TO DISCONNECT.
I ALSO HEAR THAT 2600HZ RESETS SPRINT NODES AND
GIVES YOU THEIR INITIAL TONE..

                       BLUE BOXES, PART II


     WHILE  READING  THE FINE ARTICLE ON THE BLUE BOX I SAW  THAT 
THERE A LOT OF DATA LEFT OUT OF THE DOCUMENT.   I HOPE THIS ADDS, 
IN SOME SMALL WAY, TO THE INFORMATION.
Press [RETURN]                       FIRST THE TONES.   WHILE ALL THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT, THE 
TIMING SPECS WERE NOT INCLUDED.   THE TONE PAIRS ARE TO REMAIN ON 
FOR 1/10 SEC. WITH 1/10 SEC. OF SLIENCE BETWEEN DIGITS.  THE 'KP' 
TONES  SHOULD BE SENT FOR 2/10 SEC.   A WAY TO DEFEAT THE  2600HZ 
TRAPS  IS TO SEND ALONG WITH THE 2600HZ SOME PINK  NOISE(MOST  OF 
THE  ENERGY  IN THIS SIGNAL SHOULD BE ABOVE 3000HZ,  THIS  SIGNAL 
WON'T MAKE IT OVER THE TOLL NETWORK,  BUT SHOULD CARRY AS FAR  AS 
YOUR  LOCAL  TOLL  CENTER) SO THAT THE TRAPS  WON'T  FIND  'PURE' 
2600HZ  ON THE TRUNK.   THIS IS NOT A PERFECTLY SAFE WAY TO  BOX, 
BUT IT SHOULD SLOW DOWN THE DISCOVERY.
     AS  TO USE,  THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS  THAT 
THERE  ARE  TWO(2)  TYPES OF TOLL COMPLETING  TRUNK,  INWARD  AND 
OUTWARD.  THE NAMES ARE REFERENCE TO THE OFFICE THAT IS SWITCHING 
THE  CALL(THE TOLL CENTER THAT SERVES THE WATS LINE  YOU  CALLED) 
AND EACH TYPE OF TRUNK HAS A DIFFERENT CLASS OF SERVICE.  FROM AN 
INWARD TOLL COMPLETING TRUNK, YOU CAN REACH THE DIFFERENT SERVICE 
OPERATORS,  THE TOLL TEST BOARD,  AND THE INWARD OPERATOR.   SOME 
OFFICES ALSO ALLOW REMOTE TESTING AND IT IS IN THESE OFFICES THAT 
YOU  CAN ACCESS THE OUTWARD TOLL COMPLETING TRUNKS.   THE OUTWARD 
TRUNKS  ALLOW  YOU  TO  MAKE  VERIFICATION(EMERGENCY)  CALLS,  DO 
Press [RETURN]                  SERVICE  MONITORING(TAPPING),  STACK TRUNKS(BUSY OUT  ALL  TRUNKS 
BETWEEN  LA AND NYC),  ENABLE AND DISABLE TSPS POSITIONS,  AND IN 
SOME CASES(ON SOME 4A'S) ISSUE TEMPORARY REROUTING INSTRUCTIONS( 
SEND  ALL CALLS FROM LA TO NYC VIA MIAMI,  BOSTON,  OR ANY  OTHER 
CLASS  5  OFFICE OR OFFICES).   BOTH TYPE OF TRUNK ALLOW  YOU  TO 
PLACE A 'STANDARD' CALL WITH A BOX.
     IN  SOME  OFFICES,  MOSTLY THE SMALL ONES WITH A  TOLL  TEST 
BOARD THAT IS UNATTENDED AT NIGHT AND ON WEEKENDS, YOU CAN GET AN 
OUTWARD  TOLL COMPLETING TRUNK AS WELL AS PERFORMING  OTHER  TEST 
AND  ROUTING FUNCTIONS.   YOU DO THIS BY USING THREE DIGIT  CODES 
THAT  ARE INVALID EXCHANGES(NOT OF THE PATTERN NNX[SEE NOTE  1]).  
DURING  THE  SIXITES  THE  CODES USED WERE  FAIRLY  STANDARD  AND 
CONSISTENT, HOWEVER WHEN THE BOXES BECAME POPULAR AND THE PHREAKS 
STARTED  DOING THINGS LIKE ROUTING ALL CALLS FROM DALLAS  TO  FT. 
WORTH VIA WASHINGTON D.C. MOTHER STARTED CHANGING THE TEST CODES 
ON  A  RANDOM(AS FAR AS I KNOW) BASIS.   WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST  IS 
THAT EVERYBODY INTERESTED IN DOING THIS SORT OF THING PICK OUT  A 
NICE  QUIET  LITTLE OFFICE SOMEWHERE AND WORK ON  DISCOVERING  THE 
CODES ACCEPTABLE TO THAT OFFICE.
     EACH  NUMBERING PLAN AREA(NPA,  ALSO KNOWN AS AREA CODE) HAS 
Press [RETURN]                  AN OFFICE DESIIGNATED AS ITS MASTER OFFICE.  THIS OFFICE CONTROLS 
ALL OF THE OTHER TOLL OFFICES IN THE AREA AS WELL AS SERVING AS A 
CONCENTRATION  POINT FOR MOST OUT OF AREA CALLS.   TO ACCESS  THE 
SERVICES OF A NON-MASTER OFFICE YOU NEED IT'S 'CITY  CODE',  THIS 
IS  A  THREE(3) DIGIT CODE THAT IS OF THE FORM 0XX,  AND IS  SENT 
AFTER THE AREA CODE[SEE NOTE 2].  AS AN EXAMPLE,  THE 'CITY CODE' 
FOR  CANTON,  OHIO IS 042;  THUS TO REACH THE INWARD OPERATOR  IN 
CANTON, YOU WOULD SEND 'KP-216-042-121-ST' WHERE AS IF YOU WANTED 
THE INWARD OPERATOR IN CLEVELAND, YOU WOULD SEND 'KP-216-121-ST'.  
THE  REASON THIS IS NECESSARY IS THAT THE OPERATOR  IN  CLEVELAND 
CAN'T VERIFY A NUMBER IN CANTON, SO IF YOU WANT TO VERIFY SOMEONE 
IN CANTON YOU NEED THE CITY CODE.  ALSO, MOST AREA MASTER OFFICES 
HAVE DEDICATED DATA TRUNKS TO THE NETWORK CONTROL CENTER AND THUS 
DON'T  ACCEPT TEST AND REROUTING COMMANDS OVER THE SWITCHED  NET-
WORK.
     IN CONCLUSION,  THE SWITCHING NETWORK WILL DO A LOT MORE FOR 
YOU THEN CONNECT YOU TO PEOPLE AND THE SMALL OFFICES THAT REQUIRE 
A 'CITY CODE' ARE THE TYPE OF OFFICE TO TRY TO BREAK.

     NOTE 1:   THE  NORMAL  FORMAT  FOR TELEPHONE NUMBERS  IS  AS 
               FOLLOWS: NYN/NNX-XXXX.  WHERE N=ANY DIGIT EXCEPT 1 
               AND 0; Y=0 OR 1, AND X=ANY DIGIT.  YES I KNOW THAT 
               IN  SOME AREA CODES THE NNX FORMAT HAS CHANGED  TO 
               NXX.   THIS  IS  A NEW OCCURRENCE AND  ONLY  OCCUR

               FUNNY  EXCHANGES ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO  MASTER

               CODE' FORMAT.

     NOTE 2:   YOU  CAN  OBTAIN THE 'CITY CODE' FOR A  NUMBER  BY 
               CALLING RATE AND ROUTE AND ASKING FOR THE 'NUMBERS

 WE ALL KNOW THAT THE TOUCH TONES FREQUENCIES ARE COMPOSED
OF TWO TONES (TWO DIFFERENT FREQS.) SO THAT IS THE REASON
WHY WE HAVE 2 VCO'S ( VOLTAGE CONTROLLED OSCILATORS). WE
WILL CALL THESE VCO#1 AND VCO#2. IF YOU HAVE NOTICED
VCO#1 ANS VCO#2 ARE EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF CIRCUITS.
THAT IS WHY ONLY ONE WAS DRAWN. BUT REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER
GOES FOR VCO#1 ALSO GOES FOR VCO#2. BOTH VCO'S ARE COMPOSED
OF A HANDFULL OF PARTS. ONE CHIP TWO CAPACITORS 2 RESISTORS
AND FIVE POTENTIOMETERS. ALL OF THIS WILL GIVE YOU (WHEN PROPERLY
CALIBRATED) ONE OF THE FREQS. NECESSARY (THE OTHER ONE WILL
COME FROM VCO#2) FOR THE OPERATION OF THE BB. BOTH OF THESE
FREQS. WILL BE MIXED IN THE SPEAKER THUS FORMING THE REQUIRED
TONE.

                TROUBLE SHOOTING
 
 BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE TWO VCO'S
ON A BREAD BOARD OR ANYTHING THAT PLEASES YOU.
 
 CHECK FOR COLD SOLDER JOINTS, BROKEN WIRES, POLARITY
OF THE BATTERY, ETC.........
 
 BEFORE WE APPLY POWER TO THE VCO'S WE HAVE TO ADJUST THE POTS
FOR THEIR HALF WAY TRAVEL POINT. THIS IS DONE BY TURNING THEM
21 TURNS TO THE RIGHT AND THEN 10 TURNS TO THE LEFT. DO THE
SAME FOR ALL TEN OF THEM.
 
Press [RETURN]                  NOW APPLY POWER TO THE UNIT CHECK TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE POWER
IN THE CHIPS BY PUTTING THE POSITIVE LEAD OF YOUR VOLT METER
ON PIN 7 AND THE NEGATIVE LEAD ON PIN 12. IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING THERE TURN OFF THE UNIT ANT RECHECK THE WIRING.
 
WHEN YOU GET THE RIGHT VOLTAGES ON THE CHIPS, CONNECT A
DIODE TO A PIECE OF WIRE (LOOK AT FIG. 2 FOR THE ORIENTATION
OF THE DIODE) FROM GROUND TO ANY POT AT POINT T (LOOK CAREFULLY
AT THE SCHEMATIC FOR POINT T IT IS LABELED T1-T10 FOR ALL POTS)
 YOU SHOLD BE ABLE TO HEAR A TONE, IF NOT DISSCONNECT THE LEAD
AND PLACE THE SPEAKER CLOSE TO YOUR EAR AND IF YOU HEAR A CHIRP
LIKE SOUND, THIS MEANS THAT THE TWO VCO'S ARE WORKING IF YOU DON'T,
IT MEANS THAT EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF THE VCO'S IS DEAD.
SO IN THIS CASE IT IS ALLWAYS GOOD TO HAVE AN OCILLOSCOPE ON HAND.
 
 DISCONNECT THE SPEAKER FROM THE CIRCUIT AND HOOKUP THE OCILLISCOPE
TO ONE OF THE LEADS OF THE SPEAKER AND THE GROUND FROM THE SCOPE
TO THE GROUND OF THE BATTERY. CONNECT AGAIN THE GROUND LEAD
WITH THE DIODE CONNECTED TO IT FROM GROUND TO ANY POT ON THE
VCO THAT YOU ARE CHECKING AND YOU SHOULD SEE A TRIANGLE WAVE

   DISCONNECT THE SPEAKER FROM THE CIRCUIT AND CONNECT A FREQ.

   CONNECT THE NEGATIVE LEAD TO THE BATTERY NEGATIVE AND
CONNECT THE JUMPER LEAD WITH THE DIODE FROM GROUND TO POT NUMBER 1
T1 .( THE FIRST POT NUMBER 1 POINT T1)
