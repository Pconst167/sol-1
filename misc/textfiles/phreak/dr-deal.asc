                MERIDIAN BALANCING BY USE OF THE NEUROPHONE

                        Sheldon C. Deal, D.C., N.D.

ABSTRACT
        A series of experements were done by muscle testing paitents for
meridian imbalences and then strengthing the muscle indicators, indicating
balanced meridians, by running a time-domain amplifies signal through the
paitent's skin.
        The skin is embryonically the source of all special senses.  Our skin
contains more sensors for heat, touch, pain, etc., than any other part of the
human anatomy.  The human ear evolves embryonically out of the convolutions of
the skin of an embryo in the mothers uterus.  Basically, the skin is the
oldest evolutonary nervous system sensor.  Another way to look at this, is the
special sense of tough has progressively extended over the entire body by way
of skin and evolutionary wise our other special senses should follow suit and
extend over our entire body in time.  The skin then, since it is the precursor
of the ears, should also be capable of hearing, or to put it another way, it
should beable to transmit the sense of hearing to the brain by means other
than the 8th Crainial Nerve.
        The skin is both piezo-electric and opto-electric, that is, when the
skin is stimulated by an electric or photon field, it vibrates.  If it is
mechanically stimulated, it will generate its own electric and photon field.
In Russia, blind people have been trained to "see" with their fingertips and
in Czechoslavakia, deaf people have been trained to "hear" with their
fingertips.
        For the purpose of our experement, we used a Neurophone, a device
developed by Dr Pat Flanagan, author of the book, PYRAMID POWER.  The device
uses hyperspacial nested modulation technology.  Briefly the device takes a
complex signal such as the sound of an orchestra and electriclly processes it.
First, the signal is passed into a section which clips everything into a
series of square waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of clipped waves
Lisitsyn confirms are the carriers of the human brain waves.  Next, the
square waves are differentiated, since these are finite spikes with real
non-zero rise times and decay times rather than theoretical constructs, a
series of noisy spikes results the second differentiator section.  From here,
the noisy spikes are introduced to special contact electrodes which are placed
on the skin.  The electrodes are fabricated of zirconium titanate imbedded in
acrylic plastic tiles to provide maximum impedance match to the skin itself.
        In experements done at Tufts niversity near Boston by Dr Dwight
Batteau in Man-Dolphin communications and assisted by Dr Flanagan, it was
established that the nervous system uses time ratios as major sources of
intelligent information.  It was found that speech intelligibility was
contained in time dominant ratios of the speech waveform.  Speech quality was
found to be contained in dominant frequency ratios.  So the nervous system is
designed to recognise two distinct paramaters: the time domain and the
frequency domain.
        Baised partially upon work done at Tufts University, it is known that
the human voice does not depend upon frequencies.  People who have had their
larynix removed can use an "artificial larynix", a buzz generator held against
the side of the throat.  Word information is formed by the action of the jaw,
tongue, teeth, glottis, and the nasal cavaties.  The human nose and mouth form
a variable time dely generator.  Thus, the basic audio information our brains
evolved to decipher, the human voice, is dependent not upon frequency but upon
the time rate of change nature of sound caused by time delays imposed by the
mouth and nasal passages.
        The Neurophone makes use of these research results by suppressing the
frequency domain and amplifying the time domain of the incomming signal.  This
is one reason why the Neurophone sounds so scratchy when one first begins to
listen to it.  The electronic circuitry of the Neurophone presents audio
information to the skin in the way the skin originally evolved to recieve and
decode the information eons ago.  Thus the Neurphone directly inputs
information into the brain and nervous system, and even the mind, bypassing
all the normal sensory systems that lie between the mind/brain loop and the
outside environment.
        Since all of the acupuncture meridians are present on the surface of
the skin, we found some very interesting affects when the skin was activated
by the Neurophone.  All the subjects of the experement were muscle tested for
one major muscle for each of the twelve meridians bilaterally.  The meridians
were recorded as under active for muscle weak in the clear and over active for
muscles that became weak only by stimulation of the alarm point for its
respective meridian.  The subjects were then connected to the Neurophone by
placing the electrodes on the skin of the forehead just lateral ans superior
to the eyes.  K-Y Jelly was used to enhance the contact between the skin and
the electrodes.  A tape recording of pink noise was then played through the
Neurophone for a period of two minutes and then the muscles were retested
after removal of the electrodes.

CONCLUSION
        Table 1 represents the totals of 10 different paitents who went
thorugh the experiment.  Out of the 240 meridiand tested, 85.8% of the
unbalanced ones found, were corrected.  The Neurophone appears to have a
beneficial effect on the body.  On subesquent visits, the meridians were
remaining in balance two weeks later.  Some of the many comments from the
paitents included: cessations of seizures, inproved sleep, total relaxation,
improved respiration, better concentration, and cessation of pain.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
        To be certain the Neurophone was not operating by bone conduction, a
simple experement was done, known as the Batteau test in honor of the hearing
research of the late Dr Dwight Batteau who developed the test during the
Neurophone evaluation at Tufts University.
        Two seperate channels of auditory information were used.  One channel
goes through a set of ordinary headphones, the other goes through the
Neurophone.  One specific frequency is played through the headphone channel.
Another frequency slightly different is played through the Neurophone
circuitry to the transducer disks.  If the Neurophone was producing hearing
by bone conduction, the two slightly different frequencies would "mix" in the
bone structures of the inner ear, producing a discernible "beat frequency"
which is the difference between the two frequencies.  With the Neurophone,
this "beat" is heard only at very high volume levels in both channels, levels
at which the Neurophone is probably producing bone conduction by the strong
vibration of the skin under each transducer disk.  However, the beat frequency
should theoreitcally be heard at all volume levels; it is not heard at normal
neurophonic listining levels.

LOOKING AHEAD
        Although the present experement was a relatively simple one, the
implications of future possibilities are tremendous.  The following ideas may
well serve as topics of future research papers and I invite all the members of
the I.C.A.K. to pursue them, either on their own or in conjunction with me.
Some of the possibilities for which ther is already some evidence are:
        1.  Increase in telepathic awareness.
        2.  A brain/mind link between two or more people.
                T.E. Bearden has developed a mathematical formula that
                indicates that the combined mind power of a group of people
                will multiply exponentially if these people are linked in a
                unitary consciousness.
        3.  Subliminal learning may be accomplished by the subject material
            being played through the Neurophone at a low volume level.  No
            conscious effort is made to learn the material.  This could even
            be accomlished while the student is asleep.
        4.  Conscious learning may be accomplished by simultaneously listening
            to tape recorded data by means of Neurophone and headphones.  In
            this way, the learning centers of the brain are being accessed by
            at least two seperate channels.
        5.  Positive subliminal programs to alter undesirable habits: i.e.
            weight control, smoking control, and creation of positive mental
            attitude.
        6.  Control the aging process by means of positive cellular
            programming via the Neurophone.
        7.  Totally deaf people being able to the recorded audio.
