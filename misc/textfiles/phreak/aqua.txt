
A LONG TIME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOCK IN TRACE. THIS BOX DOES
OFFER AND ESCAPE ROUTE WITH SIMPLE DIRECTIONS TO IT. THIS BOX IS QUITE A
SIMPLE CONCEPT, AND ALMOST ANY PHREAKER WITH BASIC ELECTRONICS KNOWLEDGE CAN
CONSTRUCT AND USE IT.

 A LOCK IN TRACE IS A DEVICE USED BY THE F.B.I. TO LOCK INTO THE PHONE USERS
LOCATION SO THAT HE CAN NOT HANG UP WHILE A TRACE IS IN PROGRESS. FOR THOSE OF
YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF 'LOCKING IN', THEN HERE'S A BRIEF
DESCRIPTION.

 THE F.B.I. CAN TAP INTO A CONVERSATION, SORT OF LIKE A THREE-WAY CALL
CONNECTION. THEN, WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY CAN PLUG ELECTRICITY INTO THE
PHONE LINE. ALL PHONE CONNECTIONS ARE HELD OPEN BY A CERTAIN VOLTAGE OF
ELECTRICITY, THAT IS WHY YOU SOMETIMES GET STATIC AND FAINT CONNECTIONS WHEN
YOU ARE CALLING FAR AWAY, BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TROUBLE KEEPING THE LINE
UP. WHAT THE LOCK IN TRACE DOES IS CUT INTO THE LINE AND GENERATE THAT SAME
VOLTAGE STRAIGHT INTO THE LINES. THAT WAY, WHEN YOU TRY AND HANG UP, VOLTAGE
IS RETAINED. YOUR PHONE WILL RING JUST LIKE SOMEONE WAS CALLING YOU EVEN AFTER
YOU HANG UP. (IF YOU HAVE CALL WAITING, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND BETTER ABOUT
THAT, FOR CX:CQ%INTERCEPTS THE ELECTRICITY AND MAKES A TONE THAT MEANS
SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH YOUR LINE. THEN, IT IS A MATTER OF WHICH VOLTAGE IS
HIGHER. WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE RECEIVER, THEN IT SEE-SAWS THE ELECTRICITY TO
THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSON ON EACH LINE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HANG
UP UNLESS ONE OR BOTH OF THEM WILL HANG UP. IF YOU TRY TO HANG UP, VOLTAGE IS
RETAINED, AND YOUR PHONE WILL RING. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF
HOW ,BLING UOR-.1M=. WHEN ELECTRICITY PASSES."CI=Q?A CERTAIN POINT ON
YOUR PHONE, THE ELECTRICITY CAUSES A BELL TO RING OR ON SOME NEWER PHONES AN
ELECTRONIC RING TO SOUND.)

 SO, IN ORDER T? ELIMINATE THE TRACMR=UOMEHOW MUST LOWER THE VOLTAGE ON YOUR
PHONE LINE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERY TIME(SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE
PHONE LINE, THEN THE VOLTAGE DOES DECREASE A LITTLE. IN THE FIRST STEPS OF
PLANNING THIS OUT, K.K. SUGGESTED GETTING ABOUT A HUNDRED PHONES ALL HOOKED
INTO THE SAME LINE THAT COULD ALL BE TAKEN OFF THE HOOK AT THE SAME TIME.
THAT WOULD GREATLY DECREASE THE VOLTAGE LEVEL. THAT IS ALSO WHY MOST THREE-
WAY CONNECTIONS THAT ARE USING THE BELL SERVICE THREE WAY CALLING (WHICH IS
ONLY $3 A MONTH) BECOME QUITE FAINT AFTER A WHILE.

 BY NOW, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BASIC IDEA. YOU HAVE TO DRAIN ALL OF THE
POWER OUT OF THE LINE SO THE VOLTAGE CAN NOT BE KEPT UP. I RATHER SUDDEN
DRAINING OF POWER COULD QUICKLY SHORT OUT THE F.B.I. VOLTAGE MACHINE, BECAUSE
IT WAS ONLY BUILT TO SUSTAIN THE EXACT VOLTAGE NECESSARY TO KEEP THE VOLTAGE
OUT.

 FOR NOW, IMAGE THIS. ONE OF THE NORMAL RADIO SHACK GENERATORS THAT YOU CAN GO
PICK UP THAT ONE END OF THE CORD THAT HOOKS INTO THE CENTRAL BOX HAS A PHONE
JACK ON IT AND THE OTHER HAS AN ELECTRICAL PLUG. THIS WAY, YOU CAN "FLASH"
VOLTAGE THROUGH THE LINE, BUT CANNOT DRAIN IT. SO, SOME MODIFICATIONS HAVE
TO BE DONE.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/


 MATERIALS NEEDED- A BEOC (BASIC ELECTRICAL OUTPUT SOCKET), LIKE A SMALL LAMP
TYPE CONNECTION, WHERE YOU JUST HAVE A SIMPLE PLUG AND WIRE
THAT WOULD PLUG INTO A LIGHT BULB.
- ONE OF CORDS MENTIONED ABOVE, IF YOU CAN'T FIND ONE THEN
CONSTRUCT YOUR OWN... SAME VOLTAGE CONNECTION, BUT THE
RESTRAINER MUST BE BUILT IN (I.E. THE CENTRAL BOX)
- TWO PHONE JACKS (ONE FOR THE MODEM, ONE FOR IF YOU ARE
BEING TRACED TO PLUG THE AQUA BOX INTO)
- SOME CREATIVITY AND EASY WORK.


 NOTICE: NO PHONES HAVE TO BE DESTROYED/MODIFIED TO MAKE THIS BOX, SO DON'T GO
OUT AND BUY A NEW PHONE FOR IT!


 ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE. IF YOU HAVE THE BEOC, IT COULD
DRAIN INTO ANYTHING, A RADIO, OR WHATEVER. THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THAT IS
YOU ARE GOING TO SUCK THE VOLTAGE OUT FROM THE PHONE LINE INTO THE ELECTRICAL
APPLIANCE SO THERE WOULD BE NO VOLTAGE LEFT TO LOCK YOU IN WITH.
 1)TAKE THE CONNECTION CORD. EXAMINE THE PLUG AT THE END. IT SHOULD HAVE ONLY
TWO PRONGS, IF IT HAS THREE, STILL, DO NOT FEAR. MAKE SURE THE ELECTRICAL
APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF UNLESS YOU WANNA BECOME A CRISPY CRITTER WHILE MAKING
THIS THING. MOST PLUG WILL HAVE A HARD PLASTIC DESIGN ON THE TOP OF THEM TO
PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING IN AT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES INSIDE. WELL, GET A NICE
AND REMOVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PLUG (I DON'T SEE WHY[...) THEN JUST CUT
THE TOP OFF.
 WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE, LOW AND BEHOLD, YOU WILL SEE THAT AT THE BASE OF THE
PRONGS THERE ARE A FEW WIRES CONNECTING IN. THOSE WIRES CONDUCT THE POWER INTO
THE APPLIANCE. SO, YOU CAREFULLY UNWRAP THOSE FROM THE SIDES AND PULL THEM OUT
UNTIL THEY ARE ABOUT AND INCH AHEAD OF THE PRONGS. IF YOU DON'T WANNA KEEP
THE JACK, THEN JUST RIP THE PRONGS OUT. IF YOU ARE, COVER THE PRONGS WITH
INSULATION TAPE SO THEY WILL NOT CONNECT WITH THE WIRES WHEN THE POWER IS
BEING DRAINED FROM THE LINE.
 2)DO THE SAME THING WITH THE PRONGS ON THE OTHER PLUG, SO YOU HAVE THE WIRES
EVENLY CONNECTED. NOW, WRAP THE END OF THE WIRES AROUND EACH OTHER. IF YOU
HAPPEN TO HAVE THE OTHER END OF THE VOLTAGE CORD HOOKED INTO THE PHONE, STOP
READING NOW, YOUR TOO FUCKING STUPID TO CONTINUE.
 AFTER YOU'VE WRAPPED THE WIRES AROUND EACH OTHER, THEN COVER THE WHOLE THING
WITH THE PLUGS WITH INSULATING TAPE. THEN, IF YOU BUILT YOUR OWN CONTROL BOX
OR IF YOU BOUGHT ONE, THEN CRAM ALL THE WIRES INTO THE AND RECLOSE IT. THAT
BOX IS YOUR TICKET OUT OF THIS.
 3)RE-CHECK EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL IN PLACE. THIS IS A PRETTY FLIMSY
CONNECTION, BUT ON LATER MODELS WHEN YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCED AT IT THEN YOU
CAN SOLDER AWAY AT IT AND FORM THE WHOLE DEVICE INTO ONE BIG BOX, WITH SOME
KIND OF CHEAP MATTEL HAND-HELD GAME INSIDE TO BE THE POWER CONNECTOR.

 IN ORDER TO USE IT, JUST KEEP THIS BOX HANDY. PLUG IT INTO THE JACK IF YOU
WANT, BUT IT WILL SLIGHTLY LOWER THE VOLTAGE SO IT ISN'T CONNECTED. WHEN YOU
PLUG IT IN, IF YOU SEE SPARKS, UNPLUG IT AND RESTART THE WHOLE THING. BUT IF
IT JUST SEEMS FINE THEN LEAVE IT.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

 NOW, SO YOU HAVE THE WHOLE THING PLUGGED IN AND ALL... DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS
THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! WHEN THE TRACE HAS GONE ON, DON'T PANIC, UNPLUG
YOUR PHONE, AND TURN ON THE APPLIANCE THAT IT WAS HOOKED TO. IT WILL NEED
ENERGY TO TURN ITSELF ON, AND HERE'S A GREAT SOURCE... THE VOLTAGE TO KEEP
A PHONE LINE OPEN IS PRETTY SMALL AND A SIMPLE LIGHT BULB SHOULD DRAIN IT ALL
IN AND PROBABLY SHORT THE F.B.I. COMPUTER AT THE SAME TIME.
