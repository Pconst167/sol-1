|                                     |
|   This is basically a list of some  |
| different recordings that GTE uses, |
| and how to access them by calling   |
| the recording itself...             |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #1: [503] 620-0041        |
|   This is GTE's own version of get- |
| ing a hold of a wrong number:       |
|      "We're sorry, your call cannot |
| be completed as dialed.  Please     |
| check the number and dial again, or |
| ask your operator for assistance."  |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #2: [503] 620-0042        |
|   This recording is received when   |
| calling your own number:            |
|      "Number you have dialed is on  |
| your party line, please hang-up and |
| allow sufficient time for the party |
| you are calling to answer before    |
| you return to the line."            |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #3: [503] 620-0043        |
|   You get the next one while your   |
| talking to someone while they call  |
| you on their other line:            |
|      "Someone on your line is call- |
| ing you, please wait a moment for   |
| them to return to the line."        |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #4: [503] 620-0045        |
|   This recording is received when   |
| there's some probs with the fone    |
| companies shit:                     |
|      "We're sorry, due to telephone |
| company facility trouble your call  |
| cannot be completed at this time.   |
| Will you try your call later?"      |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #5: [503] 620-0046        |
|   You'll hear the following when    |
| you're calling somewhere that gets  |
| a lot of calls, places like radio   |
| stations get this a lot, it's when  |
| all the people possible are trying  |
| to call, and it can't handle any    |
| more, so it drops you to this gap:  |
|      "We're sorry, all circuits are |
| busy now, will you please try your  |
| call later?"                        |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #6: [503] 620-0047        |
|   Ya get the recording coming up    |
| when some a-hole is screwing you    |
| over by taking yer line out, or the |
| fone co. is gettin' ya back for the |
| bill ya didn't pay last month...A   |
| good one to trip people out if you  |
| have 3-way:                         |
|      "Your line has been temporar-  |
| ily disconnected.  For service,     |
| please contact our customer billing |
| center toll free at 1-206-823-8655."|
|                                     |
| RECORDING #7: [503] 620-0048        |
|   If you hear the next recording    |
| then you have a number that's no    |
| good, and you're using some added   |
| feature in yer calling:             |
|      "We're sorry, your call cannot |
| be completed as dialed, please      |
| check your instruction manual or    |
| call the business office for ass-   |
| istance."                           |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #8: [503] 620-0049        |
|   You'll hear the next recording    |
| when ya have speed-calling, and you |
| fuck the number up:                 |
|      "We're sorry, the code you     |
| have dialed is not active, please   |
| hang-up and dial the complete num-  |
| ber, or re-establish your speed-    |
| calling code."                      |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #9: [503] 620-0050        |
|   GTE plays this one for ya when    |
| there's mass calls going through at |
| one time, and their system can't    |
| handle it:                          |
|      "We're sorry, due to heavy     |
| calling we cannot complete your     |
| call at this time, will you please  |
| hang-up, and try again later.  If   |
| your call is urgent, please try     |
| again now."                         |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #10: [503] 620-0051       |
|   This is just GTE's basic way of   |
| saying yer call didn't make it:     |
|      "We're sorry, you're call did  |
| not go through.  Will you please    |
| try your call again?"               |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #11: [503] 620-0055       |
|   I'm not too sure about the next   |
| one, but I believe that the trench  |
| is trying to say that you left your |
| fone off the hook, and something's  |
| wrong:                              |
|      "Please hang-up, and if you'd  |
| like to make a call try it again,   |
| if you need assistance, please hang-|
| up and dial the operator."          |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #12: [503] 620-0056       |
|   This one is a cool one for really |
| trippin' people out, it's the re-   |
| cording you get when dialing from a |
| payfone without putting a quarter   |
| in, it asks for 25 cents:           |
|      "The call you have made re-    |
| quires a 25 cent deposit.  Please   |
| hang-up momentarily and listen for  |
| dial tone, deposit 25 cents, and    |
| dial your call again."              |
|                                     |
| RECORDING #13: [503] 620-0059       |
|   The final one, another strange    |
| one, it's played when calling a 911 |
| and all the lines are busy:         |
|      "This is a recording, all of   |
| the 911 emergency lines are busy    |
| now, if your call is an emergency   |
| please hang-up and dial the oper-   |
| ator."                              |
|                                     |
