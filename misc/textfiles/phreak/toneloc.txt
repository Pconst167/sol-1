I. Differences between THC-SCAN and TONELOC
===========================================


Commandline Options:
--------------------

SAME as TONELOC : <DatFile>, /M, /X, /R, /D /# /H /S /E /Q


CHANGED :    TONELOC         THC-SCAN
               /K       ->      /C        for carrier scanning
               /C       ->      /!        specify an alternate CFG File


ONLY IN TONELOC
     /C- and /T-  I think there is no use for them.


ONLY IN THC-SCAN
     /A + /B turns the autonom/manual mode on/off (read THC-SCAN.DOC for infos)
     /*      dials only special specified types from the DATFILE.
     /&      Debug Mode, all modem output is also written into MODEM.LOG
     /N      Disable Effects
     @<Textfile> Scan all numbers specified in Textfile

  read THC-SCAN.DOC for details.


Options /r /d /x may be used up to 10 times on command line in THC-SCAN,
in TONELOC up to 9 times. (who cares)




Scanning:
---------

THC-SCAN has got everyting TONELOC has got - 'cause TONELOC is very very good
but now a bit out of date (and didn't work correct on my computer!  <grmpf>
that's the reason I programmed that one!). So i'll only mention keys that
changed and then what is enhanced/new.

NOT IN THC-SCAN
     N   -  Note a number                  (also you can do this with CUSTOM)
     0-9 -  Change Modem Speaker volume


CHANGED :
  TONELOC                                THC-SCAN
     A   -  Load alternate screen            ALTA-   Alarm (Alternate Screen)
     B   -  Blank Screen                     ALTB-   Bosskey (blank)
     J   -  Jump to DOS                      AltJ-   Jump to DOS
     K   -  Write a (K)omment :-)            S   -   (S)ave a Comment ;-)
     S   -  Modem Speaker on/off             ALTS-   Modem Speaker on/off


ENHANCED :
     P   - Pause : Now you can enter some commands like oontinue, redial, next
                   and hangup.
     S   - Save comment - better edit options.


NEW :
     I   - Interesting Voice ID
     U   - Unused Number ID
     M   - Redial & use autonom/manual mode this call only
     1-3 - Custom 1-3 ID (can be precisely defined in CFG)
     4-5 - SECONDARY ID : identify as CCiTT #4 or CCiTT #5 line (for blueboxers)
     6-0 - SECONDARY ID : identify country of number (6=europe, 7=usa etc.)
     ?   - Help screen for keys to use (online, 6 pages)
     +   - like X, extend timeout for 5 seconds for this call only
     -   - decrease timeout for 5 seconds for this call only
     <BACKSPACE>- Select some of the last 20 dialed numbers to be dialed again.
     <ENTER>- Enter Manual Dial Mode (if redial+manual set or Autonom mode=on)
     N and <TAB> Next Number without changing the ID
     AltC- Comment-everything-switch
     AltD- Enter Dial Menu
     AltM- Mode Menu Switch
     AltO- Option Menu
     AltT- Enter Terminal   (full terminal implemented)
     F1-F8 - Execute a program specified in CFG plus behavior and variables.


NEW FEATURES :
   When an incoming call comes, a window pops up with the message INCOMING CALL
      and waits until RINGs stop. Plus option for Answering with modem etc.
   Even if you get a NO CARRIER, THC-SCAN detects that as a carrier, Toneloc
   doesn't ...



Configuring :
-------------

NOT IN THC-SCAN :
    No Blacklist (for what use is this ...)
    No Fossil Driver Support. (maybe i'll put that in, but only on demand)


CHANGED :
    Easy Modem Initialisation. No use for characters like "|!~^<>" etc.


NEW FEATURES :
    More Responses can be defined
    More Log Files can be defined
    Automatic Identification is much enhanced (f.e. VOICE response, and no
       ring is a VMB etc.)
    Execute Programs on F1 to F8 with behaviour etc.
    Auto-Execute Programs when Response IDs are recognized
    More Hacking functions for Carriers & Tones
    Redial Busy numbers in random scan mode
    Use a Step Rate when scanning sequentiell up/down (f.e. very 5th number)
    Real DATA Autodetect mode. Not just a silly parity stripping.
    plus much, much, much more !  (Read HISTORY.DOC to get an overview)


Known Problems :
----------------

PROBLEMS IN THC-SCAN
    Old Modems may be to slow and may seem to lose characters (report please!)
    Maybe the port may lock up on baud speed higher then 9600 (depends on
        seriell port) ya'll see the msg "Can't initialise Port!" on start.
        Lower the Speed and everything should work. 
        It is not important to have a high baud rate while scanning


PROBLEMS IN TONELOC
    On some computers the modem initialisation does not work (on mine f.e. !)


if something other doesn't work on your computer with either program it's more
likely that you didn't configure everything right.



       ----------------------------------------------------------------

       There are some more features and enhancements in THC-SCAN but it
       is very difficult to remember everything ... so check it out ;-)







II. How to change from TONELOC to THC-SCAN 
==========================================

If you did any batch files you can keep them and use them with THC-SCAN.
Read Section I to take a note of the options with another parameter and
the new ones.
You can convert the DAT Files of TONELOC with DAT-CONV.EXE. It autodetects
TL Format and converts to TS.
Print out the Online Keys and put them beside the keyboard until you got them
in your head.
Read the Documentation to check what are THC-SCAN's other possibilities & modes.
Run TS-CFG to create your Config File.

Then ya can start.




III. How to change from THC-SCAN to TONELOC
===========================================
If you did any batch files, check Section 1 to see what is not supported from
Toneloc and what paramters got another name.
You can convert the DAT Files of THC-SCAN with DAT-CONV.EXE. It autodetects
TS Format and converts to TL.
Remember NOT to try all the fine commands & keys possible in THC-SCAN ....
they are not implemented into TONELOC !
Run TLCFG to create your Config File.
