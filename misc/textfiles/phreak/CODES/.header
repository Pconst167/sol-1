<H1>Phone Phreaking: Telephone Access Codes (Codez)</H1>
<P>
It used to cost an enormous amount of money to call long distance for any large
amount of time. One phone company, one price, one <I>high</I> price. And if
you were connecting to a BBS across the country for hours at 300 baud, that
first phone bill realigned what your parents thought a telephone bill could
cost.
<P>
Some of the BBS community, intent on calling anywhere they wanted to whenever
they wanted to, started learning how to scan for telephone access codes, where
you would dial an access number for another telephone company or voice mail
system, and then hit random digits until you stumbled onto a "code" that
let you dial anywhere you wanted to. An entire subculture rose up to trade
in these "codez", and to many casual observers this seemed to be the
whole of Phone Phreaking.
