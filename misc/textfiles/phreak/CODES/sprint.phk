 Sprint Code Access *> 619-340-4800

 To begin with, pick a random 5 didit number. It is usually better to start 
with a '1'.

Example:  14121

 After you have picked the digits, add 100 to the ending.

Example:  14121100

 Call the Sprint dial-up for your area and after the tone, enter the code.  
This is the tricky part. After you enter the code, listen. If a recording 
comes on BEFORE you finish entering the code number, you do not have a code 
between 100 and 200.  If this happens, do the following, enter the 5 digit 
number with 200 added on.

Example: 14121200

 Call up the dial-up again and enter the new code. If the recording comes on 
after the new code has been dialed, then there is one code between 200 and 
300.  In other words, there is one code between 14121200 and 14121300.  You 
have just narrowed it down to 100 digits (about 20 mins. time).

 Call Sprint back and enter the following: 14121250.  Notice the increasement 
, same five digit number plus 250 upwards to 300.  The key here is the last 2 
digits.  These are routing codes used by Sprint.  You started with a 5 digit 
number and now you have a 6 digit number. You only need the last two.

Example: 50 thru 99
         00 thru 49

 Once you have Sprint hacking mastered you can hack one in less than 20 mins.
I hope this has helped somewhat.
