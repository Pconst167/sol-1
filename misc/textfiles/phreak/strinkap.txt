	Hello prospective member. I don't want your real name, your phone 
number, or your sister's measurements. All I want is one reference who will
vouch for you. This must be someone who has been around for awhile, and who
is of good reputation. We don't accept warez puppies, or 10 year old HeathKit
addicts. You don't have to know everything, just know something. This NOT a 
Phreaking group per se, but the devices built *can* be built for that purpose.
Didya hear that, FEDS? Didya? We only seek knowledge that would otherwise be
unlawfully denied to us. Nothing wrong with that... So, if you have been 
dismantling your toys since you were 4, you are probably what we are looking
for. We are just getting up and running, so get in on the ground floor. I want 
to limit membership to under 15. So apply soon. All you have to do is fill 
this out, ZIP it using the password option, and upload it to one of the boards 
listed in the other text file included with this package. Leave me private
e-mail with the ZIP password in it, and I'll get back to you in a few days. 
I'll either reply at the board you upload it to, or to another board of your
choice, just leave the name and number of the BBS you want me to reply to.
Thanks!

	Yeah, I know, that was pretty stupid. I just want to get a feel for 
you and where you are in your 'education'. Just 'cuz you didn't answer a 
question right, does not mean you will be eliminated from membership. I am
interested in your ideas, and whether or not you can implement them.


I do not claim to know everything, so don't feel like you are being 
scrutinized (ha!). Anyway, if there is anything else regarding this app. just 
write it in below:
