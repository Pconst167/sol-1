one-how to get free phone calls from a payphone 
                by phoenix


if you are to wussy or to big of a lamer to make a red box, this wussy 
way might be what you should do.  this method was said in a FAQ i got 
from a phriend, but since the FAQ wasnt popular, i will print it here.

when you dial a 1800 number into a payphone, it HAS to let you make the call
for free.  on some COCOTS, you can use this to get free calls.  first, call
a number like 1800MUSICNOW.  in this case, you would keep hitting # 
until music now hung up on you.  then, you will get a dial tone.  SOME COCOTS
lock up so you cant dial anything, but most dont.  then, dial any number 
you want and it should work.

if you do this on a non COCOT such as a USWEST, an operator will get on
and ask for the money for the call.  that is why you must do this on a 
COCOT.  when you get the operator phuck with her!!!!  say something like
"i put in my damn money now let me on!!!!!!!" and if she says no you didnt
start whistling and maybe youll whistle right (yeah right) then, tell 
the operator how stupid she is for being an operator and tell her if she
lets you get away with this, youll do it with her!!!  <DONT EVER DO THIS
FROM YOUR HOME PHONE!!!!>

two-how to get free sodas from a soda machine

there are lotsa ways to get sodas from a soda machine.  the way all the lamerz
on 2600 say you should do it is stick in money, but since i dont like to 
spend money, these ways are easier. 

method one-  this way works SOMETIMES.  but once you get it working once, you 
will probably be able to do it again and again.  first stick in all
your coins except for the last coin, then drop in the last coin.  just
when it is going down, hit whatever selection you want as fast as you can.
if this works, you should get your money back and two sodas.  i was told
by a phriend that if you dont hear a rumbling when you are hitting the button
a lot, then you should hit the refund button as soon as possible and try
again.  this works best on old coke machines.

method two-all the lamerz on 2600 said had a BIG fight about if this way works
but it does, so dont listen to anything you hear.

pour water into a squirt bottle.  pour A LOT of salt.  go to a soda machine
that is isolated and squirt the salt water into the dollar thing.  you 
should get all of one type of coin (all the dimes, nickels, or quarters) and
all the sodas (about 80+).  It should also smoke a lot...dont worry, you wont 
die, its just the machine breaking!  run once you get the stuff.  this costs 
the coke company 800 dollars to fix so be careful.   you can get in deep
shit for this! NOTE: THE NEWER MACHINES HAVE GUARDS ON THEM!

     Okay, 4 all u phreakin newbies. This is aimed in your direction. So this
is my pathetic attempt to try to tell you how to make the almighty Red Box.


First go take your cheap ass into Gay Shack(Radio Shack lamerz) and buy a tone
dialer.  Get the 33-memory tone dialer so you can get all five tonez in at
the same time. 


Now buy yourself a 6.5536 mhz crystal(don't get too picky, take a 6.5 if they 
have the phuck) You will probably have to order it from Phucked-Up-Shit Shack
(Radio Shack) If they ask what you need it 4 say "My phuckin science project"
or something like that.


 IMPORTANT PHUCKIN DISCLAIMER!-NEVER BUY THESE 2 AT THE SAME TIME!!


 Now borrow or steal a solder iron  from a lamer/store/phriend/someplace.


                OkAy NoW tO tHe PhUn PaRt

                WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR SHIT!


 First of phuckin all take the batteries out of the tone dialer(if any). 
 Now take the 4 screwz out of the back of it cause they suck. Now pry the
 shit apart.

 Okay I'm not even gonna tell you what all the shit is so look for the 
 cylinder shaped silver thing that has prongz on it. Thatz the crystal
 my phriends. Un-phuckin-solder the crystal and replace it with the lamer
 6.5536 crystal. It's huger than the other damn-hell so you have to experiment 
 a bit to figure out how to put it in. Put it in any way you can! Now solder the 
 shit to the prongz.

 Now program the dear-sweet-bejesus dialer. Turn the switch to program and
 hold down the memory button/switch and press the * key 5 timez. Now hit
 memory again and the place you want to store it. It should beep, if it doesn't
 then you are phuckin deaf, or you did it wrong. DO IT AGAIN IF IT DOESN'T BEEP!

 Have phun u phreex!

 four-PrAnK cAlLs


   So you want to have some phun? 

   Pick up the phuckin phone and dial a number!

   When they answer say "I'm sorry"

   They will say "What 4?"

   Say "I spooged on your car! But I'm willing to pay 4 the damages!"

   They might say "REALLY?"

   Say "Your tailpipe looked so appealing! But your wife was better"

   They'll probably hang up but u and your phriends will get a laugh..

 phive-bomb

here is a cool bomb...it can really phuck up a wall...  

take some ammonia (that smelly shit under your sink) and pour it into a 
bucket.  take some iodine (dont have any?  go to school and steal some
from your dumbass science teacher who has prostate cancer.  pur in the iodine
go make a red box.  come back and then there should be some gummy shit
on the bottom.  pour out the liquid and then leave the gummy stuff.  put 
the gummy stuff on a paper towel.  tack the towel to a dumbass sysop
who pisses you off (like lamerz like steve sharpe)  throw a rock at the 
towel and RUN LIKE SHIT!!!
when all the blue smoke goes away...there will be a BIG stain on the side   
of the phuckers house.  run around like a monkey and brag to your phriends
and then dont tell anyone else.
=============================================================================
