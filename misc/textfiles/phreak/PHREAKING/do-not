We are having fun - Phreakin, hacking, stealing.....

BUT - As we are having most fun - The feeds shows up / Why????

Here's some info on what to take care of:

REGISTRATION OF PHONE CALLS:

By the start of 1994 the Danish phone companies will register ALL national
calls. I don't know if other calls will be registred.
The companies says it will only allow people to get a printout of there
calls destination and duration. 
But - As you may know PET (The police Intelligence Service) are tapping
phones in a large scale. So, they will deffenetly use this oppetunity
to monitor YOUR phone traffic.


COPIES OF PHONE CARDS:

Don't try making copies of the phone cards used i pay phones. They may work
once - But the pay phones (This system i active in Denmark) communicate
with a central computer. If it detects two identical cards being used
with different amounts of credit left it will blacklist it.
I guess this kind of system is being used in other countries too. But I'm  
not sure.         
NOTE: All calls made from payphones using payphone-cards will in Denmark be 
registred with: TIME, DATE, LASTING OF THE CALL, PLACE YOU ARE CALLING FROM 
AND TO!!!!!

So - Don't use these phones if you're in trouble or don't want anyone to know
about your call - Use normal payphones in stead. They will "only" log the
number ya calling.
