Ok, I might as well reveal myself to you all now.  I am really Sharp
razor of LOD fame.  In this file I am interviewing Lex Luther, we can
get to see what the REAL Lex is like.  Here we are:

ME:Hey Vinny, whats up?
AN:Hey dude, whats that?  Hey, thats a nice walkman let me see...
ME: <SLAP> NO!  Get away from it.  I... sorry... its just that I'm
protective about my walkman...
AN:Ok, I understand.
ME:So Vinny, tell me about yout latest files.
AN:You want to know about my files! $Ok!$I typed in 183 more$manuals into $LOD$
$text-files.  Some$preety good stuff$to.
ME:Um, how come when you talk with all these '$'s?
$AN$:$And I'm gonna$type 54$more...What? oh, sorry, I always get like that
when I talk about my ELITE files...  So what were you saying?
ME:Ok, I understand, anyway whats going on in LOD lately?
AN:$LOD$!Well$ we... oh... sorry... um, LOD is doing fine, we have created
our own little world of Elite BBSs.  All of them are LOD only, you should see
the incredible info, so many codes!  And we have succeded in populating
these ELITE $LOD$, um I mean Elite LOD boards with complete know-nothings.
ME:Sounds preety Elite.  Oh shit, my walkman... hold on.. *&&%^&*PIYHIOYB
C)*UAJHFD"LF.... ok, fixed it...  So, is LOD's Public relations going?
AN:Elite... Totally ELite, everyone loves us, its great... people who know
A LOT more than us, tell us everything they know about phreak/hack, all
we do is out them through our filter to get info out of them... Its Elite...
ME:Cool, I've heard a lot of rumours going around lately about your
accomplishments, could you tell me about them?
AN:Well to start with, some people are trying to take away my credit for 
inventing the blue box.  I mean, you think Joe Engressia did it by himself?
He was fucking blind!  I told him what to do.  Of course, I gave ole'
Al Bell that idea about using acid to the get the telephone to work.
Of course, that never could have happened if I hadn't invented the light
bulb, I don't know why I gave Edison the credit... You know those rumours
that I wrote all of Shakesphere's works aren't true.  Lets just say I
dictated...  I don't know though, sometimes I think I should have given
my military advice to the turks instead of Alexander the Great...  About
the pc world though, the Woz and I are good friends,  I did him a favour
once, gave away a computer I had invented, but I didn't like to much,
some thingy with a 6502, um... Apple 2 I think he called it.  Of course
after that I went on and made that other computer, the one with the
8088, uh, pc something they called it... And then -
ME:OK! Enough, I'm running out of tape - uh, I mean time, I gotta go...
I have some typing to do...
AN:Oh, really? on what?
ME:Oh, just a little file, you know...

$Well$dudes$you$just$read$a$very$Elite$interview$!!!

And now an interview with Executive Hacker, of CEO

ME:Hey dude, how's The Chief Executive Officers?
AN:Well, we just wrote some more about our opinions on everything 
technical, ever....
ME:Oh, I hear you've been kinda out of the BBS world except to release your
files?
AN:Oh, well, not really, we stay in touch...
ME:Hey, by the way do you have Ultima IV docs?
AN:Haha, very funny.
ME:What do you mean "very funny"?
AN:I meant no one even has Ultima IV, much less the docs, when do you think
it will be released?
ME:um, exec, Ultima IV has been around a few months.. seriously...
AN:WHAT?!?!  You're kidding?!?!?!
ME:Look, forget it, back to our discussion, I heard you were running a board
on Tele-cat software?
AN:Ult. IV!? released?  What?  Oh, I think The Byte should be releasing 
version 1.0 of that program soon.
ME:um, exec, its... oh forget it.  You said you stayed in touch, with who?
AN:Oh, no one special... well, actually Corprate Criminal... and... no one.
ME:Oh, Corprate Criminal of CEO?
AN:Yes
ME:So, who else is in CEO?
AN:Corprate Criminal.
ME:And?
AN:ME.
ME:And?
AN:Well, thats about all.. in fact, that is all.
ME:Ok, I gotta run now, nice talking to ya...
AN:Later, is Ult. IV really released yet?  forget it.
ME:later...
                 

Ok, in case you're too stupid, what I am trying to say is that LOD is a group
of egotistical fools, and CEO, even though they know a lot(all 2 of them)
don't know whats going on...

later...
Don't you just love the Elites?  I do, in fact, I love them so much that:

--------------------------------THE ELITE FILE---------------------------------
                                June 2nd, 1986
Ok, I have just read the "SpecElite 1980-85" disk and I writing partially
in response to it, but also because the things I am going to say have been
building up inside me for a long time.

To start, "The Doc", who is the sysop of SpecElite claims to be "Elite" all
over the place.  He tells us of the hard way to "Eliteness" and how he finally
learned the ropes of Piracy.  Very funny.  The first thing I would like to
establish, before I go any further is that Piracy is not a "skill" not a
"talent" and takes no effort.  Kraking is another matter and takes a slight
amount of skill, but to call Aes and Cfurs and "distribute warez!", which
is what most of out present "Elites" do, means nothing.  The Doctor has no
programing skills, no hacking talent, and no phreaking knowledge, his main
claim to fame is that he used to run a kool cat-fur/Pirate BBS(he claims it
was the first!HA!).  It is so easy to become Elite now, with all these low
I.Q. new warez kids running aroung, who are looking for pirates to ass
kiss it is relatively easy to build up a following.  Now I won't get into
the "To spot a rodent look for 'K00l' and 'C0dezz'" syndrome which so
many people writing rodent files are doing, seriously its the people that
concern themselves with that type of thing that are assholes (then why am
I wasting my time doing this?).note:here "Elite", means Elite Pirate,
not Elite phreak.  I would also like to mention that people
that make garbage wares, (ie: take-1 movies, parrot songdisks, and other
no-skill/talent necessary items) are the lowest, they are just out to get
their name better known in piracy.  And, whatever you do, don't respect me
for writing this...
Lets take a case that just came to my mind...
for instance, "Monty Python" of 516.  Monty started out in Oct. 85(yes! 85!)
as "Hockey Nut".  Wow, he was a total moron, posting about snoppy and whatnot
on boards.  Ok, so then he changed his handle to "Monty Python" and put
up The Flying Circus Ae, which later became a BBS.  Monty had his BBS up for
a few weeks, when he decided he was ready to be *ELITE*.  Ok, his board had
been pitiful, with D&D games, etc.  Well, the Elite board was even worse,
the new user p.w was NONE. Ok, this was an Apple-net, what is the usually new
-user login? Exactly, but Monty insisted that it was a p/w he had put in.
In fact he actually posted on boards "New user p/w:None".  Well he met Taran
King of the 2600 club (No way associated with 2600 magazine), and got in
(it was because he was a sysop).  Anyway, to make a long story short, he
got on a few phreak board, was on Stronghold East *ELITE*, and posted a 
notice retiring from the "phreak world".  As far as I'm concerned he was
never in it.  Back to SpecElite though, I know you were all iritated by
the 'SpecElite [###-###-####]' well the # is 213-391-6835.  who cares...
Anyway I am supposed to be telling what I think about modems, eh... In my
*ELITE* opinion, if you put up a transfer board, and especially an "Elite only"
transfer board(cough, cough, Blackwater..) you are an asshole.  Pirating is 
total crap, every lose loves to post his theory on why the wares stopped
flowing, who cares?  I got my modem in June '84, now back then... well actually
when I think about it it sucked.  It was when all the k00l California pirates
were emerging and when pirating was at its peak.  Today, its a lot worse
and lible to become more so.  All these Elite boards are popping up all over
all "$LOD$: Invitation only".HA!  SpecElite is the worst, to get on you have to
"know someone from the Spectrum."  I talked with the doc, and he knows NOTHING!
What should I talk about now... hm...
Why don't I talk about my hometown scene for a while, NYC...  I believe a lot
of you have heard of TAP meetings, Chesire Catalyst, the same guy who 
founded TAP mag., holds them(call 212-JOY-LILY for more info).  Anyway, Today
, as you have probably heard from "TAP.INTERVIEWS" the meetings have
degenerated, Chesire is a tired old man, Broadway Hacker, who is an
obnoxious slob anyway, stopped going, the "950 codes kids" Ninja NYC
and his pals have mostly moved on, thought NYC still attends.  Ok Ninja
is, at 17 yrs. old, a complete criminal, the guy has stolen everything you
can think of, I'd love to see what he has hidden under his bed... The
two Sigmunds Frauds also attend(they are partners) one is an skinny
asshole who has an earing and the other I never spoke to, but he is the one
who supposedly does all the bbs calling.  There is also some friend of
Ninja's who works for Northern Telcom.  Ok, then there is Number 6, this guy
is about 40ish, but from what I have heard is AWESOME, really knows boxes,
etc. is supposed to be working on some new box which traces calls.  
There is some young guy with a French accent who always smiles, and
some middle aged fag who is always talking.  Then there is MARK!  Yes Mark,
though he tries to be friendly, people try to stay away.  He works as
a Camera man, but is working on his locksmith license (knows EVERYTHING about
lockpicking).  He is slightly (very) unbalanced mentally, and always very
confused.  He is teased constantly but tolerated.  There are also a few 
less important people, such as "Sid" some greasy kid who is proud to have
had a $1700+ fone bill because he thought he was using a divertor.
Right now, they are generally a motley bunch.  Also they get kicked out
of restaurants frequently now, and are now down to meeting at Burger King.
<SIGH>  How pitiful...  Another thing about NY, you guys have all heard of 
Lord Digital?  And Phantom Access?  Well LD used to have a cult following
in NY, it was very funny, you should have seen some of the rumours,
such as the "screamer" an apple-cat program that could blow up another
modem by emiting a 9600 baud carrier, sure... Also He and Paul Maud'ib
got killed a few times, arrested, went bankrupt, made a fortune, and several
other minor things...  About Phantom Access, ok by now we have confirmed
that it does exist, only whoever has it isn't giving it out, I don't have it,
and I dont' know anyone who does.  I can't understand how it wasn't given out!
What kind of rodents kept it secret?  Well don't fret I am going to write
my own hacker/scanner, etc in C language (LD would be proud, he supposedly
loves C).  Ahh... What I really want to say any how is that unless you
really love computers and telephones, I mean are really dedicated to them, then
I hope your modem blows up.  The age of Hackers has passed because everyone
has gotten a computer to use for word processors, etc.  I am very young and
I really love programming and learning about computers and when I look to
find kindred spirt, I find the likes of "Monty Python".  I still have more to
say though.  I would like to talk about Phrack, TWCB, Stronghold East, Private
Sector, 2600 and some other things.
Actually, all I have to say about TWCB, is that they are child molesters,
who promised to re-publish TAP, but are in jail now so it doesn't look to
likely that they will.  They got busted for carding, and are incredible
delinquents.  I also talked to Bootleg, and he said that are never ever
going to publish TAP, they were never serious about it in the first place,
and are just a bunch of stupid kids.
Also, Phrack really sucks, if any of you know anything about anything
technical you know that the plagerize ALL their stuff off Telephony magazines
and books, and they don't understand the stuff themselves.  It great to read
if you want to end up feeling very melancholy about life.  They also reject
anything original and not plagerized (I know from experience).  Also Taran
King is a loser, his father beat him up and the police had to drag him
away, nice work.  His board, Metalshop Elite(ha!) is awful, I am on it
, and its really sad.  Another work of Fart is Stronghold East, the
Sysop, the "Equilizer" is scared to touch his board, "The Slayer" runs
it for him, and won't let anyone on who he thinks doesn't know about
the latest PBX, or whatever rodent nonsense.  I said I would talk about 
2600 magazine, well it sucks, it never was any good, Private Sector sucks
also.  Many people don't know this, but PS always did suck, I have buffers
of it and it was mostly "codes" messages (ie: "Got sum metroz?").
Their only merit is that they are very militant about phreak's rights, and
sysop's rights to have what they want on their boards, nice work in that
respect.  As for phreaking on the Private Sector, forget it, its garbage...
Some other boards worthy of mention, are The Inner View, and The Jailhouse,
I chose these because they are prime examples of shit. To begin with, The Inner
View (617-632-9330) is ALL codes, people ask such burning questions as:
"Can I make Blue Box tones with my micromodem?" "Does Sprint really Trace?"
,"How do you start a Confrence?" and "Is Coca-Cola a good contraceptive?"
The Sysop takes it all very seriously and has even selected a panel of 7
people to judge who is c00l enough to get on the board.
Another doozie is The Jailhouse(305-788-6354), on this one, you get post
only access to the phreak subs (their are 5. why? don't ask me, the sysop
is a turd).  You have to post some of "The latest phreak info" first to get 
read access.  Obviously the sysop has been mislead, what he wants is PBX's
so he can start confrences.  He doesn't understand that a phreak board consists
of a technical disscussion of telephony, not "phreak info".
Also, The Speed Demon Elite (415-522-3074) is another good one, the
sysop devoted half the bbs to music, has a limit of 10 messages per
sub, and calls it "Elite only" <<SIGH>>
I could on for ages, if you really want to see what goes on, call some
of the BBSs in NYC, wow!  What GARBAGE!  Its all warez!1!11! and my
favorite: The War Board!  How many of you have seen a war board? This
invention was a step backwards for homo sapien...
Here people prove themselves at "ragging".  Many people consider this a
skill, I had the pleasure of d/loading the e-mail volume from a board called
the forge, and while looking through it, I saw some very intresting things.
People were having disscussions through e-mail about who was good at wars.
somewhere along the line, rodents have picked up the idea that you can "win" a
modem war.  How?  Its hard enough to fight one, I mean what do you do? Throw
names at each other, well actually, if you really want to know, thats exactly
what you do.  <<SIGH>>.  I have seen people I thought were cool actually take
modem wars seriously, its amazing, let me tell you about a real encounter I
had with some loser.  Somehow, he decided he wanted to "war" with me.  So
he posted a message declaring war.  Well when I didn't bother to respond,
he got even more excited, and started his "ragging", well for a few monthes,
this guy actually, in his own demented mind thought he was "hurting" me
by posting on the war board, that I really cared, he simply couldn't
believe me when I said I don't care, he still thinks I'm scarred of his
"ragging" abilities(after all he might rag me out dude!).
Hmm, what else do I have to say.  The Infiltrator, author of
TAP.INTERVIEWS, some think he is actually Sharp Razor, ah that brings
me to my next subject, LOD...  As we all know, LOD stands for Legion
of Doom, and was founded by Lex Luthor.  I won't go into the whole
shpiel about their history, I assume you've heard most of it.  Anyway,
I will say that they started their own little world of know-nothings
and made it Elite, they and TKOS will be the basis for the next Elite group
, but I shouldn't leak about that now.  LOD's main claim to fame is that
Lex types up shitloads of manuals and plasters LOD all over them.  Getting
published in 2600 every other month probably helps also.  Another emerging
group CEO, isn't as ridiculous as LOD, I mean the memebers know a lot, and
write intelligent stuff, the only problem is, as far as I can tell its made
up of 2 people!  Executive Hacker, and Corprate Criminal, not much of a group
even if these 2 do stack up better than the entire LOD.  I think I should say
now, before I forget, that if you want to get in touch with me, post a 
message about it on Draco Tavern (707-745-5805), you get instant validation,
so thats why I'm using it for mail.  Something funny which relates to LOD,
I should tell you about, is a a very funny case of people impresonating
Lex and King Blotto.  The Weseal (alias Nap. Bonaparte, John Mulligan)
was running a board, when I called up, said I was Lex, and offered to
take over the board and make it Elite.  I called pretending I was 
several LOD members, including Blotto, and I even sent him tc //+ software
which was ready for him to put up.  The sofware had LOD, written all over
it, and the kid actually put it up.  As far as I know, it may still be 
up, call at 212-535-2389.
well, by now I am draging this a bit to far, I would just like to say that
Adventurer's Tavern always sucked, it was a shit pirate board, even on my first
call back in early '84, it was nonsense.  Sherwood Forest ][ was a great one,
very huge, and very easy to get on.  I remember some rodent Disk Raper thought
that they were running the board on a black box, 'cuz the # didn't show up
on his bill, funny...

                 
later
The Infiltrator - Ok, I admit it, I'm not really The Infiltrator(HEHE!)...
p.s: I just wannt scream and shout, I have so many stories to tell, about
so many people, the modem world was immense but not always intense,
Atom: Write a 1985 loser file, please...
