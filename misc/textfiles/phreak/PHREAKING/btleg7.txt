CRACKING DOWN ON ABUSE

The nationwide attack on telephone fraud got a boost recently when the U.S.
Secret Service joined the effort to curb the crime that costs the industry
millions in lost revenue annually.

The Secret Service used new jurisdiction over the telephone fraud for the first
time to arrest five individuals in raids on four illegal "Call-Sell" operations
in New York City last November.

The five suspects are awaiting trial in federal court on charges based on a
Secret Service investigation conducted in cooperation with MCI and other
members of the long distance telephone industry.

The defendants were charged with violation of a law on Fraud In Connection With
Access Devices which carries maximum penalties of 15 years imprisonment and a
fine of $50,000, or twice the value of the fraudulent activity.

Several other investigations are under way and future arrests are expected,
according to a Secret Service spokesman.

MCI cooperated in the investigation as a company and through membership in the
Coomunications Fraud Control Association (CFCA), made up of some 35 telephone
industry firms.

"Because it's an industrywide problem, we have organized to crack down on all
kinds of fraud, from the isolated 'hacker' to more organized schemes to use
long distance lines illegally," said Everick Bowens, senior manager of MCI
security investigations and president of CFCA.

The Secret Service said that in the New York cases, the defendants operated
Call-Sell businesses out of their homes and charged "customers" a flat fee for
making long distance calls.  They used "Blue Boxes" and stolen or compromised
authorization codes or credit card numbers to use the long-distance networks of
several companies.

Blue Boxes are electronic tone-generatine devices used to bypass billing
systems and gain access to company networks.  They can be assembled from
generally available electronic parts or they can be purchased ready-made
through illegal sources.

In the New York raids, agents seized unauthorized code and credit card numbers,
four Blue Boxes and more than 20 telephones.

It is estimated that in 1984, fraud in the telecommunications industry totaled
$500 million nationwide, and approximately $70 million in the New York City
area.

CFCA members are primarily interexchange carriers, such as MCI, but resale
carriers and some Bell operating companies are also members, along with
representatives of computer services and credit card companies.

Bowens says CFCA is intensifying efforts to stop the spread of fraud. Among
other things, CFCA is developing educational packages for carriers and the
public to promote widespread understanding of telephone fraud and ways to
counter the crime.

"Our aim is jointly to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute any
fraudulent use of our long-distance networks," Bowens said.

Authorization codes are obtained by theft from individuals and by "hackers" who
randomly try combinations of numbers by telephone or through computer scanning
of number combinations until a working code is "hit."  Illegally obtained codes
are fraudulently used by "boiler room" telemarketing operations, for example,
or are passed along for use by individuals.

MCI had developed software to detect illegal entry into its network and it is
expected that the spread of dial 1 service, in which authorization codes are
not used, will help reduce the incidence of telephone fraud.

You reckon they mean us???????????????

What's wrong with them, can't they take a a joke???????????
of dial 1 service, in which authorization codes are not used, will help reduce
the incidence of telephone fraud.

                   THE LONG DISTANCE LETTER
    NEWS AND ANALYSIS FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXECUTIVE

                       DECEMBER 1985

Dear Executive:

FRAUD WASTES MILLIONS OF INDUSTRY'S DOLLARS!

     Fraudulent use of toll services costs the long-distance industry millions
of dollars each year.  And unlike access charges or even advertising costs,
expenses paid out as a result of unauthorized, illegal toll usage can never be
rationalized as a true cost of or a potential benefit for the business.
     The problem of toll fraud diminishes the bottom line of every
long-distance company, whether the company is AT&T or a regional reseller of
service.  Fraud costs the alternate long-distance industry alone $10 million
per month, estimated Teltec Saving President Robert Hurwitz, speaking at a
Competitive Telecommunications Association meeting.

THE TYPES OF FRAUD

     The varieties of fraud, although many, are not indefinite.  Yet industry
members readily agree that for every type of fraud that is either diminished or
eradicated, another pops up.  James S. Minogue, a general attorney with
Satellite Business Systems, listed several varieties of fraud:
     * BLUE BOXING occurs when people use tone generators, devices that
generate tones to bypass telephony billing systems (usually from a payphone),
to enter the network without being billed for the calls.
     *HACKERS--perhaps the most infamous group--use computers to identify
authorization codes.  Hackers fall into 2 categories--true crooks, and those
who indulge in breaking codes for ego gratification
("phone freaks").  The latter group uses the authorization codes.  But these
computer whizzes also set up computer bulletin boards in which illegally
obtained long distance numbers or authorization codes are posted so others may
use them.
     A variation of hacker's fraud is "prison fraud", said Minogue. Prisoners
have access to touch tone phones and simply sit by the phone and punch numbers.
 "Sooner or later, they hit upon the right numbers," Minogue said.
     Prisoners have also been known to illegally obtain authorization codes,
and by punching the pound key, hand the phone from inmate to inmate for their
different calls, a practice that once kept an access line of Execulines of
Florida, Inc. busy for more than 12 hours, Peter Sawn, marketing manager for
the Orlando-based company, told us.
     That experience also included MCI, as the number used was an MCI travel
card.  The prison was in Tennessee, but because of the switching equipment used
at the time, the calls were made via incoming
lines from Orlando, confounding both companies initially as to where the calls
were from.  The Prison warden wouldn't agree to replace the Touch-Tone phones
with rotary dials, as Execulines suggested.  with the crooks already in prison,
not much more could be done.
     An outgrowth of hacker fraud is the set-up of telemarketing groups based
on the ill-gotten distribution codes.  "The primary expense in these boiler
room or telemarketing operations is the telephone expense," noted Jim
Yarborough, vice president of corporate development for Advanced
telecommunications Corp., parent company of Transcall America and Direct Line,
long-distance companies serving the Southeast and Western United States,
respectively.
     A number of these cases where telemarketing groups are fraudulently using
long-distance services are run by businessmen, and the chances of these
businessmen not knowing that what they are doing is illegal are slim to none. 
"Any businessman who's using a service and not paying for it knows it's
illegal.  Th only free cheese is in a mousetrap," said Yarbrough.
     Some crooks barter with the stolen numbers.  One such entrepre-
neurial sort talked a jewelry store into giving him discounts on the
merchandise.  In return, he would take care of the store's long-distance
service, Chris Davis, an attorney with the Washington D.C.-based law firm
Surrey & Morse, told us.  The jewelry store was delighted with the arrangement
until the long-distance company whose service was used, came calling for bill
payment.  The hacker who provided the number was long gone, along with his
discounted jewelry.
     Ironically, long-distance companies themselves have contributed to the
problem.  "Part of the problem is that the industry has been doing it to
itself, through the drive for market share.  In their desire to sign up
customers, checks are not made on the names and addresses of people signing up
for the service," noted Davis.  And as with credit cards, people sign for the
service with the express intent of defrauding the company.  Other groups that
contribute greatly to fraud are schools, college campuses and military bases.

HOW CAN FRAUD BE THWARTED?

     Sometimes, it takes a thief to catch a thief.  Execulines' Peter Sawn
suggests that several companies sponser an electronic bulletin board
anonymously, to obtain the codes passed around.  Sawn warns that if a bulletin
board is set up, the system must not contain a lot of other data, because a
hacker can zap it quite easily out of existence.
     TelTec Saving had some success with posting a $10,000.00 reward for
information leading to conviction of abusers on computer bulletin boards.  In
the bulletin board message, TelTec also informed possible abusers that the
company had automatic number identification (ANI) capability--to trace calls to
the abusers.  Just telling them of ANI, even if you don't have it, may work for
a while.
     TelTec Saving had experienced abuse costing up to $250,000.00 a month, but
with a stringent plan reduced losses to $30,000-$70,000 per month (TLDL, March,
p. 3).
     Software can also thwart fraud--at least for a while.  American
Telemangement Corp. markets a software product that detects hackers trying to
steal authorization codes, President William O'Reilly told us.  O'Reilly
founded Lexitel Corp. and was one of the founders of the Association of
Long-Distance Telephone Companies (ALTEL), now the Competitive
Telecommunications Association.
     The Network Security Monitor software has been available on a limited
basis for about 90 days.  Carriers using the program are Satellite Business
Systems, TelTec Saving, Communications Co. and Microtel Inc. Cost of the
software is based on the size of the company and the extent of the problem.
     O'Reilly admits the product won't stop fraud, but says it will keep losses
down to a minimum.  Although no industry wide statistics
have been gathered, O'Reilly estimates that companies lose 1/2 of 1% of revenue
per month, on the low side, to 3% per month on the high side.  (American
Telemanagement Corp., 26899 N.W. Highway, Suite 420, Southfield, MI. 48034,
313/358-1414.)
     Software is indeed seen as a major solution to the problem-but after the
fact.  MCI spokesman Gary Tobin says that with software the company developed,
MCI can detect and then stop incidences of fraud on a real-time basis.
     "Fraud is now down to less that 3/10 of 1% per month with the new
software; before fraud was much higher, although still "single-digit,"
Tobin said.
     For all its attendent maladies, the equal access conversion effort may
help to reduce fraud.  Since authorization codes won't be used as much, with
networks accessed from phones, rather than just through code numbers, Tobin
says that fraud will continue to be diminished.
     While many industry members acknowledge that equal access helps in
fighting fraud, that will be true only for those companies entered in the
presubscription process, such as larger companies, both facilities-based
carriers and resellers.
     Regional carriers that in many cases do not join the equal access process
will still make use of the authorization codes, and of course, travel cards,
calling codes and any type of service that uses access codes will remain at a
high level of risk.

DETERRENTS TO FRAUD: PROSECUTION, THE PRESS AND PUBLIC AWARENESS

     While many long-distance companies expressed a reluctance to discuss the
problem, fearing that mention of fraud in a trade periodical would incite
further instances, Advanced Telecommunications' Jim Yarbrough noted that when
the company prosecuted, the press coverage of the prosecution as well as the
prosecution acted as a deterrent.
     "The biggest deterrent is punishment.  When we caught some teenagers
commiting fraud, the publicity generated by the prosecution resulted in
bulletin boards passing the word to 'stay away from this company--it
prosecutes,'" said Yarbrough.
     "I don't expect fraud to stop--it can't ever be stopped totally. But as
people realize there are laws on both the state and federal level--once people
realize that it's not a game, that people do go to jail, the type of fraud
commited by phone freaks will dry up.  But the people who are selling codes and
are crooks to begin with will continue to do so," predicated Yarbrough.
     Prosecution may include both criminal and civil action, noted SBS' James
S. Minogue.   "In civil actions, judges can award punitive damages also.  Civil
action is not as effective as criminal--law enforcement is preferable.  But if
enforced, civil actions may also act as deterrents.  But criminal charges are a
far more serious deterrent," noted Minogue.
     Another deterrent is public awarness.  AT&T has embarked on a
fraud-awareness program developed by Bell Atlantic for AT&T.
     The program focuses on computer and credit card fraud and is aimed at
junior and senior high school students, college students and military
personnel.
     Four videotapes have been filmed, each one geared to a specific group. The
tapes will be shown to schools, colleges and military bases as cornerstones of
sessions dealing with fraud in a pilot program in New Jersey.  The tapes are
based on an actual case of fraud showing a junior high school student selling a
software progam for $5 to a friend, saying that with the program he can contact
bulletin boards across the country without being charged for the calls.  The
kid buys the program, goes to town with it and wham, is caught by telephone
company investigators.
     The kid is hauled to juvenile court, found guilty and required to pay for
the long-distance calls anbd is sentenced to community work.
     After showing the tape, a security representative discusses what
constitues an illegal call and the penealties for making them. Literature about
telephone fraud is also distributed.
     "The program shows that AT&T is determined not only to investigate and
prosecute fraud cases, but also to educate potential abusers about the possible
consequences of their actions," said Charles Schnitzelein, general security
manager for AT&T Communications
     Security representatives of Bell Atlantic, acting as agents for AT&T, are
approaching schools, colleges, school boards, parent-teacher associations and
military bases to schedule the sessions.  AT&T is also working with other BOCs
that are investigating fraud cases, so AT&T can extend the program nationwide.
     AT&T declines to say how much money the company lost to fraud last year,
but before divestiture, the total Bell System, AT&T and the Bell operating
companies lost $150 million annually as a result of all types of fraud, calling
card, coin, third-party billing, etc., Neal Norman, AT&T-C district manager of
corporate security, told us.
     AT&T has had problems with fraud not only domestically but internationally
as well.  In March 1984, AT&T-C was permitted by the
FCC to restrict international card usage from those countries or international
area codes where the company experienced a high incidence of fraud.
     Software has also enabled AT&T to diminish fraud, but the end is not yet
in sight.  Norman concurs that reducing dependency on codes would help the
industry with fraud, but notes that fraudulent users will always find a way.
     Making the customers aware of the Truth in Lending Act, under which
cardholders are liable for the first $50 on fraudulent phone bills--as long as
there is no intention to defraud the companyu--is another way to increase
public security consciousness.
     Customers must be made aware that fraud is a problem, so they will
exercise more control over their codes and numbers, and BOCs must join the
effort to reduce fraud, said Norman,
     "BOCs must participate too.  They have problems of their own, although
slightly different in nature," noted Norman.

FRAUD FIGHTERS GROUP FORMED

     Fraud fighters now have an association to aid their efforts.  The
Communications Frauds Control Association, a nonprofit group incorporated in
May, works to increase cooperation within as well as beyond the industry to
promote fraud control, President Everick Bowens told us.
     Specificially, the association was formed to:
     *Establish and maintain closer communications regarding security matters.
     *Promote the mutual interests of telecommunications carriers to the extent
of protection and efficiency of security operations.
     *Provide a forum where information can be collected, classified and then
distributed to members for security purposes.
     The association resulted from meetings hosted by Network 1 in Florida last
winter.  Members include local telephone companies as well as long-distance
providers--both resale and facilities-based carriers.  Companies that provide
computer services are also members.
     The association is working to collect statistics on the extent of fraud
experienced by the industry, and even within the association, the company
representatives are loathe to reveal losses due to fraud, Bowens said.
     To protect themselves from fraud, OCCs must build a better mousetrap, and
first realize just how "un" secure their operations are, said Bowens.  "We have
to produce better, safer, more secure
products.  The hardware and software for seitches must be more
security-conscious," said Bowens.
     Sharing information is a necesity.  "The population of fraudulent users
although great, is pretty static.  One may abuse AT&T for a while and then go
on to an OCC.  Information on abusers must be shared," said Bowens.
     Local exchange companies and long-distance companies must cooperte more
fully.  "Both segments must be allowed to communicate their needs to arrive at
solutions.  We must identify and isolate given fraudulent situations.  The
interexchange carrier has some information;  the exchange carrier has
some--they must work jointly with law enforcement," said Bowens.
     "All long-distance companies should also keep in mind that fraud control
is a serious project in terms of dollars and in terms of how secure the
national telecommunications security systems really are. It behooves anyone in
the industryu to band together to ensure tha security.  The ultimate victims
are the general public.  No company will be able to exist if fraud is not taken
care of," stated Bowens. (The Communications Fraud Control Association, PO Box

OUTSKIRTS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE EVERY
MONTH.ARRIVING AT THE TAP MEETING
ON TIME INTRODUCTIONS WERE QUICKLY
MADE AND STORIES ABOUT THE PAST
STARTED FLYING.CHESIRE STATED THAT
TAP ORIGINALLY WAS STARTED BACK IN
1971 BY ABBEY HOFFMAN(OF CHICAGO 7
FAME) AS A POLITICAL ANARCHIST
NEWSLETTER CALLED YPPL (YOUNG PEOPLES
POLITICAL LOBBY).A FEW YEARS LATER
THE NAME WAS CHANGED TO TAP AND AL
BELL TOOK OVER.AS WE ALL KNOW CHESIRE
CATALYST RAN TAP FOR AWHILE WHILE THE
INFAMOUS ISSUE #91 WHICH WAS PRINTED
BUT NEVER MAILED,WAS DONE BY TUC AND
BIOC 003. (ISSUE #91 WAS GIVEN TO ALL
THOSE THAT ATTENDED SATURDAY NIGHTS
TAP CONVENTION)

ANYHOW,I HAD HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS
ABOUT WHO OWNED TAP AND OTHER SULTRY
COMMENTS BY THE TIME I ARRIVED IN NYC.
 SO I DEFINATELY WANTED TO BE AT FRIDAY
NIGHTS TAP MEETING BEFORE EVERYONE
ARRIVED FOR THE BIG TAP CONVENTION ON
SATURDAY NIGHT.(INCLUDING ALL THE FEDS
THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE SNEAKING
AROUND)
 WE HAD A GREAT TIME FRIDAY NIGHT,MET
A LOT OF COOL PEOPLE,AND FOUND OUT
WHAT A LOT OF SHIT WAS TRUE AND WHAT
WAS GOSSIP & BULLSHIT. 
 AFTER ABOUT 4 HOURS,I GAVE THE OLD
TAP CREW A BOX OF MANUALS TO COPY,
AND WE DEPARTED BACK TO OUR HOTEL SO
WE COULD GET AN EARLY START ON THINGS.

      S-T-R-R-A-A-N-N-G-G-E-E

UPON ARRIVAL AT OUR ROOM,I FIND MY
DOOR UNLOCKED BUT NOTHING MISSING.
 THEN 5 MINUTES LATER THE OLE LADY
HEARS VOICES OUTSIDE OUR DOOR SAYING
"YA-THEYRE FROM OREGON"
THEN LATER MORE FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE
OUR DOOR.(OUR ROOM WAS THE LAST ONE
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY)

COULD THE FEDS HAVE OUR ROOM BUGGED??
 THE FACT THAT WE WERE ARRIVING WAS
NOT A WELL KEPT SECRET.NOR WAS THE
TAP CONVENTION TO BE HELD SATURDAY.
SINCE THE CRACKER ALSO MET THE TAP
CREW AND LEFT FOR HIS ROOM THE SAME
TIME AS US,I CALLED HIM TO SEE IF
ANYTHING UNUSUAL TWAS GOING ON AT
HIS ROOM.BUT HE REPORTED ALL WAS WELL
AT HIS END.BUT EVEN CHESIRE COMMENTATED
THAT IT WAS UNUSUAL THAT THERE WAS SO
MANY PEOPLE AT THAT HOTEL THAT WEEKEND!



CALLED TIM UP-HE SAID HIS MOM WAS
GIVING HIM STATIC BOUT FLYING TO
NYC,AND TH@T IM NOW PROMOTED TO
MANAGING EDITOR WITH TUC AS EAST
COAST EDITOR AND SUSAN THUNDER AS
WEST COAST EDITOR AND SCAN MAN AS

 HE ASKED ME TO CARRY ON FOR HIM IN
CASE HE COULDNT MAKE IT.

(NOW YE GOTTA REMEMBER THAT IVE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF TIM OR THE WHACKO BROTHERS UNTIL 2 WEEKS PREVIOUS TO THIS.BUT THE

BOTH BILL AND I. ALSO, IVE BEEN
PROMISSING THE NINJA NYC FOR YEARS THAT
SOMEDAY ID MAKE IT TO NYC FOR ONE OF

 SO,I FIGURED IF WORSE CAME TO WORSE AND TAP DISSOLVED,I STILL HAD ONE GREAT
VACATION AND FINALLY GOT TO MEET ALL
THE GREAT PEOPLE THAT ATTEND THE MONTHLY TAP MEETINGS THAT IVE TALKED TO OVER
THE YEARS.)

 CABLE TV ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO FILM
 FROM THE REAR SO AS NOT TO GET ANYONES
 FACE ON FILM EXCEPT THE SPEAKERS (CHES
 IRES),AND EVERYONE PRESENT APPROVED OR
 STAYED BEHIND THE CAMERAS.      

WHILE CHESIRE WAS IN FRON OF THE ROOM
EXPLAINING THE VIRTUES OF CCIS,MOST
OF US OLE FARTS WERE IN BACK BEHIND
THE CAMERAS HASHING OVER THE REAL
TECH STUFF CONFRONTING OUR FUTURE.
TOPIC TOUCHED UPON WERE BIT-MILE,
CLASS,AND OF COURSE TAPS FUTURE.

UPON CHESIRES COMPLETION OF HIS
TUTORIAL OF CCIS,HE THEN PROCEEDED
INTO THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
REGARDING TAPS FUTURE AND IF INDEED
TAP SHOULD BE RESTARTED AT ALL.

(NOW YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FACT
 THAT SINCEACHESIRE HAS BEEN CASHING
 TAPS SUBSCRIPTION CHECKS FOR THE  
 LAST 2 YEARS AND BLOWING THE MONEY
 ON HIMSELF,HE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE
 TRUSTED TO PUBLISH TAP.ALSO WITH
 OVER A THOUSAND OUTSTANDING CHECKS
 THAT HE CASHED,IM SUPRISED THAT
 NO-ONE HAS YET COMPLAINED ABOUT
 FRAUD TO POSTAL INSPECTORS.)

TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT,SCAN MAN
CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT THOSE CHECKS
AND HIS RIPPING EVERYONE OFF,BUT ALL
CHESIRE COULD SAY WAS HE WAS SORRY
AND SPENT THE MONEY ON HIS BILLS.
WHEN ASKED BY SCAN MAN ABOUT REFUNDS
HE ASKED 2600 IF THEY WOULD LIKE TAP.
THEY SAID THEY SURE WOULD LIKE TAPS
MAILING LIST BUT WOULDNT WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH TAPS LIABILITIES.
 I OFFERED ON BEHALF OF OUR GROUP
TO ACCEPT BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
OF TAP,BUT THAT HE HAS TO SIGN OVER
OWNERSHIP IN WRITING.
 OBVIOUSLY,CHESIRE WAS IN THE HOT SEAT.
HE HAD ADMITTED TO A FEDERAL FELONY OF
MAIL FRAUD IN FRONT OF TV AND WITNESSES. OBVIOUSLY HE NEEDED TIME TO THINK
ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF HIS STATEMENTS
AND LOOKED FOR THE QUICKEST WAY OUT OF
THE LIMELIGHT WHICH WAS TO DECLARE THAT
TAP MAGAZINE WAS DEAD FOREVER.
 OBVIOUSLY,THAT ANSWER PACIFIED THE
PRESS,FEDS,AND FOOLS.BUT TO SOME OF US
,NO WAS NOT YET ACCEPTABLE.SO AFTER THE
MAIN CONVENTION WAS OVER,CHESIRE,MYSELF,SCAN MAN,THE CRACKER,AND OTHERS
DECENDED DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE HOTEL BAR.

AFTER A FEW DRINKS,I ASKED CHESIRE WHY
HE WAS DETERMINED TO KILL TAP.
HE FIRST SAID THAT HE DIDNT FEEL IT
COULD BE CONTINUED IN THE SAME IDEOLOGY
AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED.I BLEW THAT FLIMSY EXCUSE AWAY BY STATING THAT
TAPS ORIGIN WAS ABBEY HOFFMAN AND TAP WAS
ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS AN ANARCHY TYPE
NEWSLETTER OF THE OLE VIETNAM PROTEST
DAYS,AND IF INDEED IT WAS CHANGE HE WAS
WORRIED ABOUT,THEN HE HIMSELF HAD ALREADY DONE THAT.
 NEXT EXCUSE WAS THAT HE DIDNT WANT TO
SEE TAP PUBLISHED USING LAZAR WRITERS
AND NEW HIGH TECH METHODS INSTEAD OF
THE OLE GLUE POT AND PASTEBOARD METHODS. THIS ONE ANSWER RAISED EVERYONES EYE-
BROWS HALF AN INCH.OBVIOUSLY EITHER
HIS EGO IS SUCH THAT HE WANTS HIS NAME
AND TAP TO DIE TOGETHER,OR POSSIBLY
SOMEONE IS PAYING CHESIRE NOT TO GIVE
UP TAP,AND LET IT DIE.(I.E.BELL SECURITY,FBI,SECRET SERVICE.) THE LATTER MAKES
MORE SENSE,AS THAT TIS THE ONLY WAY HE

SEEING THAT IT WAS USELESS TO CONTINUE
ALONG THOSE LINES,ME,SCAN MAN & MY OLE
LADY WENT ON TO THE RED PARROT DISCO
UNTILL 4 AM HAVING ONE GOOD TIME,AND
GETTING WASTED.

IS TAP REALLY DEAD YOU ASK?

NOT ON YOUR LIFE-SEEMS LIKE A GOOD POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT ABBEY HOFFMAN NEVER
SIGNED OVER THE RIGHTS TO TAP TO ANYONE! AND ALL THESE YEARS THE REAL OWNERSHIP
STILL LIES IN HIS HANDS!    

AND THE WHACKO BROTHERS JUST FINISHED
A 2 HOUR CONFERANCE WITH ABBEY HOFFMAN
IN WHICH HE SAID NOT ONLY WILL HE GIVE
THEM YPPL AND TAP RIGHTS,BUT WILL ALSO
HELP WRITE FOR THEM AND USE HIS EXPERTISE TO HELP THEM AQUIRE MILLIONS OF
NEW SUBSCRIBERS.SEEING AS HOW CHESIRE
WOULD HAVE TO FILE SUIT AND EXPLAIN
HIS ACTIVITIES WITH TAPS SUBSCRIPTION
FUNDS BEING DIVERTED INTO HIS OWN
POCKET,I FIND IT VERY UNLIKELY CHESIRE
WILL DO NOTHING MORE THAN HUMBLY STEP
ASIDE.

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE TAP WILL RE-START.
BUT EVEN IF THE WACKO BROTHERS DONT USE
TAPS NAME,THEY STILL MAY BE PUTTING OUT
A PHREAK/HACKING MAGAZINE THAT CERTAINLY HAS STIRRED THE INTEREST OF ALL THE
GREATS BOTH PRESENT AND PAST.(PROVIDING
THE WACKO BROTHERS STAY OUT OF JAIL
LONG ENOUGH)

ABOUT TAP STARTING UP AGAIN!
 WELL,SO HAVE I.
SO-O-O,YE OLE BOOTLEG DECIDES TO
CALL ROUND YE U.S. TO SEE JUST
WHAT TIS HAPPENING,AND LO AND 
BEHOLD,A STORY OF INTRIGUE,MYSTERY,
AND SPY VS SPY IN THE PHREAKING/HACKING
UNFOLDS AS NEVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY.
 ALTHOUGH I LIKE EVERYONE PERSONALLY
THAT IM GONNA TELL YA ABOUT,A FEW OF
THEM DEFINATELY HAVE BEEN BURNING AND
FUCKING PEOPLE IN SPADES.
 NOW LET YE STORY UNFOLD.



R-R-R-I-I-I-N-N-N-G-G-G

HELLO

BOOTLEG,THIS IS TIM OF THE WACKO/CRACKO
 BROTHERS.DO YOU WANNA JOIN A CONFERANCE.
SURE SAYS I.

BEEP

HEY BOOTLEG,SAYS TIM,IVE BEEN TALKING TOCHESIRE CATALYST AND HE'S GONNA GIVE
ME THE RIGHTS,MAILING LIST,BACK ISSUES,
AND NAME OF TAP MAGAZINE TO ME SO I CAN
RESTART TAP.

WHOA-A SAYS I-HOW YOU GONNA GET PEOPLE
 TO SUBSCRIBE SINCE TAP BURNED LOTS OF
PEOPLE 2 YEARS AGO OUT OF A BUNCH OF
SUBSCRIPTION MONEY.

WELL,SINCE MY MOM OWNS A PRINTING
COMPANY AND MY DAD OWNS 2 AD AGENCYS
AND 2 RADIO STATIONS AND IVE ALREADY
INTERVIEWED 50 OF THE GREATEST PHREAKS
AND HACKERS IN HISTORY AND IVE GOT A
53 PAGE 1ST ISSUE ALL LAID OUT AND
READY TO GO,IVE BEEN ADVERTISING ON
ALL THE BOARDS FOR SUBSCRIBERS,AND
IVE BEEN GETTING ABOUT A HUNDRED
SUBSCRIBERS PER DAY AT $35 EACH.

WOW-SAYS I!! THAT SOUNDS GREAT SO
FAR.IF INDEED YOU CAN RE-START
TAP,YOU CAN COUNT ON ANY HELP I
CAN GIVE YOU.

WELL BOOT,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD
BE TAPS WEST COAST EDITOR.            

SURE SAYS I,IF INDEED YOU CAN REALLY
PUT WHAT YOU SAY TOGETHER ILL EVEN
SEND YOU A BOX OF TELCO MANUALS AND
INTRODUCE YOU TO A GREAT HACKER THAT
ALREADY HAS PUBLISHING EXPERIENCE.
(BILL LANDRETH AKA THE CRACKER THAT
WROTE "OUT OF THE INNER CIRCLE")
AS A MATTER OF FACT,ILL CALL BILL
AND SEE IF HE WANTS TO GET INVOLVED,
IF SO HE WILL CALL YOU SOON.

BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM SAYS TIM.
SEEMS LIKE AS SOON AS A LOT OF
PEOPLE HEARD I WAS GETTING TAP,THEY
ALSO HAVE STARTED CALLING CHESIRE
TRYING TO GET HIM TO GIVE THEM THE
MAGAZINE OR STOP ITS PUBLICATION
BECAUSE THEY DONT WANT THE COMPET
ITION.

WHAT AND WHOM ARE THESE PEOPLE SAYS
I? AND WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

ONE GROUP IS LEX LUTHOR AND L.O.D.
MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY WERE THINKING
OF STARTING THEIR OWN MAGAZINE CALLED
PROJECT AWARE,AND WERE AFRAID THAT
TAPS REBIRTH WOULD KILL ANY CHANCES
OF THEIR PUBLICATION SUCCEEDING.

HELL,SAYS I-LOD TIS BUT A VERY SMALL
GROUP IN THE HACKING/PHREAKING
COMMUNITY.ALTHOUGH I KNOW A LOT OF
THEM OVER THE YEARS,I WOULD THINK
THEY HAVE MATURED BEYOND PLAYING
KID TYPE GAMES AND PETTY JEOLOUSLY.
AFTER ALL,THERE IS ROOM FOR ANOTHER
10 GOOD MAGAZINES,AND I MYSELF HAVE
MORE INFO,MANUALS,ETC. THAT CAN
EVER BE PUBLISHED BY EVEN 10 MAGAZINES.
NOT ONLY THAT-BUT NEW STUFF TIS AVAILABLE AT AN ASTOUNDING RATE NOWADAYS.      

 NO TIM,YOU JUST TELL ANYONE THAT TRYS
TO INTIMIDATE YOU TO FUCK OFF AND DIE!
 EVERYONE COULD HAVE CALLED CHESIRE
AND DONE THE SAME THING YOU DID OVER
THESE LAST 2 YEARS.NOW THAT SOMEONE
FINALLY HAS THE BALLS TO DO IT,I FOR
ONE WILL HELP THEM OUT.AND IM SURE
THAT EVERYONE I KNOW WILL STAND BEHIND
WHOMEVER HAS THE GUTS TO PUBLISH TAP
AGAIN.

THANX BOOTLEG,BUT ANOTHER PROBLEM
THAT HAS ARISED IS THE RUMOR THAT
CHESIRE DOESNT OWN TAP ANYMORE.

TIM-THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE FEEDING
YOU ALL THIS BULL ARE THE ONES PRETEND
ING TO BE YOUR FRIENDS SO THAT THEY
CAN TALK YOU INTO NOT PUBLISHING TAP.
 THESE PEOPLE(NAMES WITH-HELD) HAVE
THEIR OWN GREEDY PLANS FOR GETTING
TAPS NAME AND WILL TRY ANYTHING TO
CON OR SCARE YOU INTO GIVING UP.
 YOUVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON YOUR
OWN SO FAR,AND YOU DONT NEED ANY OF
THEM,THEY NEED YOU,OR OTHERWISE THEY
WOULDNT BE GIVING YOU THE TYPE OF
ATTENTION YOUVE BEEN GETTING.
 DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE 1 % OF
OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE ARROGANT
SUPPOSED KNOW IT ALLS.OVER THE YEARS
IVE FOUND THAT THE BEST HACKERS AND
PHREAKS HELP OTHERS,AND COULDNT CARE
LESS ABOUT JOINING GROUPS WITH FUNNY
NAMES.99% OF THE COMMUNITY WILL
SUPPORT TAPS NEW PUBLISHERS 100%.
 AND THATS WHAT THE OTHER 1% IS
DEATHLY AFRAID OF!!!!!!!!!

OK BOOT-IM GONNA GO AHEAD WITH TAP
EVEN IF CHESIRE DOESNT WANT IT
REVIVED!BUT FIRST IM GONNA ASK
FOR A MEETING IN NEW YORK WITH
CHESIRE,YOU,ME,THE CRACKER,TUC,
SUSAN THUNDER,2600 MAGAZINE,HIGH
TIMES MAGAZINE,SCAN MAN,LEX LUTHOR,
AND CAP'N CRUNCH AKA JOHN DRAPER.
 IF YOU AND BILL CAN GO,ILL PAY
FOR THE PLANE TICKETS AND HOTEL.



(AFTER SEVERAL MORE DAYS OF CONFERANCES, PEOPLE CHANGING SIDES,AND MORE
FIGHTING FOR TAPS CONTROL,A DECISION WAS REACHED TO MEET IN NYC MARCH 8TH FOR A

BOOTLEG
TRANSMISSION TEST LINE AND TEST-LINE TERMINATIONS DIRECTORY

1.   GENERAL

1.01      The purpose of this practice if to provide a list of working NNX
Codes, The Common Language Location Identification (CLLI) Codes for the
associated Central Office Building, the principal geographical location served,
and related test-line terminations.

1.02      Since the test numbers have been standardized, this practice will
also indicate the type of test line provided for each NNX Code.

1.03      Test line or test termination are terms sometimes used
interchangeably to name a testing equipment, facility, circuit, or test
communication channel.  These include simple static terminations and relatively
complex testing circuits capable of applying marginal tests and recognizing and
replying to specific signals received.

1.04      Test lines for intertoll trunks are known as National Code Test Lines
(or test terminations) and are a part of the basic maintenance pattern in the
intertoll dialing plan.  These National Code Test Lines provide assistance in
connection with maintenance tests at Testboards and automatic testing
equipment.  These test lines and details of operation are shown in Section 2 of
this practice.

1.05      Bell System Practice 660-450--301 contains information on testing at
Testboards and locations other than Testboards.

1.06      Local Test Lines (or terminations) are located in the end offices
(local central offices) and complement the manual and automatic test facilities
at the outgoing end of the trunk under test. These test lines and details of
operation are shown in Section 3 of this practice.

1.07      This practice is organized in sections to simplify the proceures for
additions and corrections:

     Section No. 1 - General Information
     Section No. 2 - National Code Test Lines
     Section No. 3 - Local Office Test Lines
     Appendix 1    - Numerical list of NNX Codes and Associated Test
                     Numbers


2.   NATIONAL CODE TEST LINES

2.01      National Code Test Lines (or test terminations) are part of the basic
maintenance pattern in the distance dialing plan for the maintenance of
intertoll trunks.  These test lines provide assistance in connection with
maintnence tests at testboards and automatic testing equipment.

2.02      National Code Test Lines 100, 101, 102, 103, and 104 will return a
steady "Off-Hook" signal which removes the single frequency signaling tone that
would otherwise interfere with certain measurements.

2.03      It is important that the equipment associated with the test line
codes be well maintained.  Regular checks should be made of their performance
as covered in the Bell System Practice.

2.04      National Code Test Lines include fixed terminations and relatively
complex testing circuits.  Some are capable of recognizing, testing, and
replying to specific signals.  The more complicated test lines can be used to
make two-way net loss measurements and noise test without assistance from the
far-end office.

2.05      Each test line circuit is connected automatically by the far-end
switching equipment upon receipt of the proper code number. It is disconnected
either on a time interval basis or when released at the originating end.

2.06      Reference:
               Code 100 - Bell System Practice 660-440-100
               Code 101 - Bell System Practice 660-440-101
               Code 102 - Bell System Practice 660-440-102
               Code 103 - Bell System Practice 660-440-103
               Code 970 - Bell System Practice 660-440-113

2.07      Code 100 - Noise and Balance Terminations
          Provides a connection to a test line termination at the terminals of
intertoll trunks for noise and balance testing.  The features of this test line
termination are:
          a)   Returns "Off-Hook" supervision to the calling end as
               long as the trunk is held by the calling end.
          b)   Provides a "Pad Control" feature at offices having
               pad control arrangements.  Tests are normally made
               in the "Pad Out" condition.
          c)   Provides a 600 or 900 Ohm impedance termination.  This
               impedance simulates the impedance at 1000 hertz
               presented by the intertoll trunk at the point at
               which the termination is connected.
                 NOTE:   There is a program underway to convert all
                         Code 100 test lines to Combination Milliwatt
                         and Balance test lines.  The new test line
                         enables both far-near loss and noise
                         measurements to be made on one connection.
                         The features of the new termination are:
                         off-hook followed by 5.5 seconds of 1000
                         hertz, then 5.5 seconds of 600 or 900 Ohm
                         impedance termination followed by one second
                         of on-hook, then 600 or 900 Ohm termination
                         until the calling end disconnects.

2.08      Code 101 - Toll Testboard Communication and Test Trunk
          Provides a dial communication line into the testboard that maintains
the intertoll trunks.  The features of this test line are:
          a)   Returns "Off-Hook" supervision to the originating point
               when the trunk is answered at the testboard position
               and "On-Hook" supervision when the testboard
               disconnects.
          b)   A recall signal from the originating point is indicated
               on the testboard position cord lamp.  A recall signal
               may be returned to the originating point by operating
               the proper testboard position key.
          c)   Provides a "Pad-In" condition during connection at
               offices having pad control arrangement.  A  pad control
               key is provided at testboards to check operation of
               switching pads.

2.09      Code 102 - One Milliwatt, 1000-hertz Testing Power
          Provides access to 1000-hertz test power in various switching systems
for one-way transmission measurements of intertoll trunks.  The features of
this test line are:
          a)   Sends test power for approximately 10 seconds.  The
               power is then removed to assure that the test line
               will be disconnected from the intertoll trunks
               single frequency signaling.
          b)   Returns "Off-Hook" supervision when testing power
               is connected and "On-Hook" signal when it is
               disconnected.
          c)   Provides idle circuit termination in the on-hook
               condition.

2.10      Code 103 - Supervisory and Signaling Test Termination
          Provides a connection to a test circuit for overall test of
supervisory and signaling path features of intertoll trunks.  The features of
this test line are:
          a)   Returns "Off-Hook" supervision to the originating
               point on seizure of test trunk.
          b)   Returns "On-Hook" supervision on receipt of a ring
               forward signal.
          c)   Provides a flashing "On-Off-Hook" signal of 120 IPM
               (recorder flashes) on reciept of a second ring forward
               signal.

2.11      Code 104 - Far-End Transmission Measuring and Noise Checking
                     Circuit
          Provides a test termination for two-way transmission testing and
one-way noise checking on calls originated by a Distant Automatic Transmission
Test and Control Circuit (ATTC) or by a distant testboard.  The features of
this test line are:
          a)   Provides for normal pad arrangement under measuring
               condition.
          b)   Receives and measures 1000 hertz, one milliwatt minus
               the circuit loss.
          c)   Arranges a network to simulate the loss indicated
               above.
          d)   Sends 100-hertz, one milliwatt tone toward testing pad.

2.12      Code 105 - Automatic Transmission Measuring System (ATMS)
                     Circuit
          Provides access to an ATMS responder used for automatic transmission
measuring programs, such as ATMS and CAROT (Centralized Automatic Reporting on
Trunks).  For more information on 105 test lines, see Bell System Practice
103-250-101.

2.13      Code 970 - Used for Office Balance
          Provides a connection through the crossbar switches to a spare office
link terminal and the associated appearance at the manual outgoing trunk test
frame.

3.   LOCAL OFFICE TEST LINES

3.01      Local office test lines (or test terminations) are provided for the
maintenance of interoffice and toll switching trunks with the test originated
either on a manual or automatic basis.

3.02      These test lines are reached by dialing or keying a customer-type
telephone number.

3.03      Combination One Milliwatt (102-Type Test Line) and Loop
          Around
          Two terminations are provided for transmission testing of trunks. 
Test calls directed to the first termination are connected to a one-milliwatt,
1000-hertz source for far-to-near end termination loss measurment.

          Two-way transmission loss measurements may be made by one person
utilizing both terminations.  After having measured the far-
to-near end loss of all trunks in the group using this reference trunk, a test
call is originated to the first termination.  Taking each of the remaining
trunks in turn, originate a call to the second termination and connecting test
power to this trunk at the near end, then measure power received at the near
end on the reference trunk. By knowing the far-to-near loss of the reference
trunk and the overall measurement of the two trunks, the near-to-far loss is
calculated by subtraction.  The requirements for these terminations are as
follows:
          a)   Trips machine ringing.
          b)   Connects one-milliwatt, 1000-hertz testing power to the
               first termination at 10-second intervals as long as the
               connection is held at the calling end and no connection
               made to the second termination.  This interval consists
               of 9 seconds test power with off-hook supervision and 1
               second no power with on-hook supervision and idle
               circuit termination.
          c)   With a connection to the first termination with the
               second termination selected, test power is removed from
               the the first termination and the transmission path of
               both terminations are directly connected, forming a
               loop.  Off-hook supervision (9 seconds), followed by
               on-hook supervision (1 second), is returned on both
               terminations.  Release of the second termination
               returns test power to the first termination.
          d)   When the second termination is selected without a
               connection to the first termination, ringing will
               be tripped and an idle circuit termination connected
               to the transmission path with on-hook supervision.
               (No.1 and No. 5 Crossbar only.  Panel and step-by-
               step ringing will not trip.)
                    Caution:  In general, a call to the second
                              termination should not be made without
                              first establishing a call to the first
                              termination, otherwise you may interfere
                              with other testing.

3.04      Nonsynchronous-Type Test Line
          The nonsynchronous-type test line provides an operation test which is
not as complete as the synchronous test but can be made rapidly.  the test may
be originated on either a manual or automatic basis.

          a)   For those offices where marginal-type tests cannot be
               applied directly to the incoming trunk circuit, as is
               frequently the case in connection with step-by-step
               systems, the synchronous test line (See 3.05) is not
              required and only the nonsynchronous test line is
               required.  In this case, the minimum requirements for
               this termination are as follows:
                    1)   Starts to function under control of ringing
                         signal.
                    2)   returns audible ringing for a minimum of 5
                         seconds.
                    3)   Trips machine ringing.
                    4)   Returns 60-IPM busy signal which consists of
                         low tone applied during alternate .5 second
                         intervals until disconnection.  Alternate .5
                         second off-hook and on-hook suppervisory
                         signals may or may not be returned in
                         addition to low tone.
          b)   For those offices where marginal-type test can be
               applied directly to the incoming trunk cicuit, as in
               the case of Bell System Panel and Crossbar-type
               Offices, both the synchronous (See 3.05) and the
               nonsynchronous-type test lines are required.  In
               this case, the minimum requirements for this termina-
               tion are as follows:
                    1)   Returns 60=IPM busy signal which consists of
                         low tone applied during alternate .5 second
                         intervals until disconnection. Alternate .5
                         second off-hook and on-hook supervisory
                         signals may or may not be returned in
                         addition to low tone.

3.05      Synchronous-Type Test Line
          The synchronous-type test lines provide marginal test of the
supervisory and tripping functions.  Tests may be originated on either a manual
or automatic basis.

          This type of test line is required for offices, such as Bell System
Panel and Crossbar-type Offices where ringing, tripping and supervisory
features are in the incoming trunk relay equipment and may be tested directly. 
The requirements for this termination are as follows:
          a)   Test for application of the ringing signal.
          b)   Test for pretripping of machine ringing during the
               silent interval.
          c)   Provide interrupted audible ringing tone during one
               two-second interval.
          d)   Test for tripping machine ringing during three-second
               silent interval.
          e)   Provide the following supervisory tests:
               1)   An off-hook signal of approximately 1.3 seconds
                    duration for synchronizing with automatic
                    progression test equipment in the originating
                    office.  During this period, soak current is
                    applied to the supervisory relays.
               2)   The synchronizing signal is followed by two
                    seperate off-hook signals of .3 second duration
                    during which time soak current is applied to the
                    supervisory relays.
               3)   Next, an on-hook signal of approximately .2 second
                    duration is returned during which time the release
                    current is applied to the supervisory relays.
               4)   A second series of off-hook signals consisting of
                    a synchronizing signal and two flashes are
                    returned.  During each off-hook interval of this
                    series, operate current is applied to the super-
                    visory relays.  During each on-hook interval, an
                    open circuit condition is presented to the
                    supervisory relays.
          f)   Send tone signals to the originating office as follows:
               1)   Continued regular audible machine ringing tone
                    indicates a failure to trip ringing.
               2)   Audible ringing tone for .3 second intervals
                    interrupted for .2 second indicates that the
                    trunk circuit tripping feature operated on the
                    pretripping test.
               3)   A "tick-tock" tone at the rate of 120 IPM without
                    flash indicates that all tests have been completed
                    and are awaiting disconnect.

3.06      Office Identification
          An office identificaton test termination is provided so that manually
originated test calls, directed to this termination from other offices within
the system, will receive an indication that the proper termination was reached.
 To insure that the proper office is reached, a different telephone number
(four digits excluding office prefix) is required for each series of telephone
numbers comprising a terminating local office unit in a Numbering Plan Area.
          a)   Electro-mechanical Offices
               The requirements for electro-mechanical office termina-
               tions are as follows:

               2)   Return high tone to the calling end as identifica-
                    tion tone.
               3)   Return on-hook supervision to the calling end to
                    prevent charge in case a subscriber inadvertently
                    dials this termination.
                    Note:  The present Panel and Crossbar-Type Offices
                           use a call-through test line circuit for
                           this termination which returns interrupted
                           high tone for approximately seven seconds
                           before it returns off-hook supervision.
          b)   Electronic Switching Offices
               The requirements for No. 1 and No. 2 ESS Office Termi-
               nations are as follows:

                    vision.
               2)   Busy tone for seven seconds with off-hook super-
                    vision.
               3)   Following the period of busy tone, the connection
                    to the busy tone is abandoned and the ICT is
                    connected to a steady high tone trunk. A continous
                    alternating sequence of on-hook (500 - 600 ms) and
                    off-hook (1500 - 1700 ms) signals is sent until
                    disconnect.

3.12      "99" Test Terminal
          In some stp-bystep offices the tens and units digits, 99, is a
reverse battery test number.

3.13      Combination Milliwatt and Balance Test Line (New 100-Type
          Line)
          This is a new test termination that will be installed in all central
offices to replace existing Noise and Balance - 900 Ohm or "quiet line"
terminations (See 3.07).  Although all codes will eventually be equipped, a c
following the 900 Ohm balance number in the appendixes indicates that the
100-type test line is the old type (i.e., termination only, no tone).  The
advantages of the Combination Test Line are:
          a)   Gives a positive indication that a properly terminated
               Balance test line has been reached.
          b)   Allows both far-near loss and noise measurements to be
               made on one dial-up connection.

               The features of the Combination Milliwatt and Balance
               test line are as follows:
               a)   Trip machine ringing and return off-hook super-
                    vision.
               b)   Send 1000 hertz, one milliwatt test tone for 5.5
                    seconds.
               c)   Provide on-hook supervision for one second.
               d)   Return off-hook supervision and 900 Ohm
                    impedance termination until calling end
                    disconnects.

3.14      ATMS 105 - Automatic Transmission Measuring System (ATMS)
          Circuit (105-Type Test Line)
          Provides access to an ATMS responder used for automatic transmission
measuring programs, such as ATMS and CAROT (Centralized Automatic Reporting on
Trunks).  Information on Central Office responsibilities for CAROT can be found
in Addendum 010-410-300 OB.

3.             Description of Test Lines

3.01      "Test Line" and "Test Termination" are terms sometimes used
interchangebly to designate a testing equipment, facility, circuit or testing
communicaiton channel.  These include simple passive terminations and
relatively complex testing circuits capable of applying marginal signaling
tests, transmission tests, and recognizing and replying to specific signals
received.

3.02      Trunk test lines return off-hook (answered) supervision. This permits
measurements to be made in the normal "in-service" (talk) condition.

3.03      Test lines are adjusted to provide correct level and impedance as
measured at their actual switch appearance.

3.04      Test lines are reached by dialing a customer-type telephone number
when testing toward a class 5 office.

3.05      Class 5 office test lines are arranged to trip machine ringing and
may furnish timed disconnect features when joint-holding and/or in-band
signaling is used.  Line equipment is arranged for terminating service only.

3.06      Following is a description of the various test lines:
     A)   100-types L or T - provide a termination equivalent to the
          office switching impedance and is used for balance and noise
          test.  A typical sequence after seizure is:
               -- Off-hook supervision
               -- 175 millisecond delay
               -- 5.5 second burst of 1000 Hz tone
               -- 5.5 second termination
               -- 1 second interval of on-hook supervision
               -- termination with off-hook supervision until
                  released by calling end.
          Earlier versions are not equipped with timed test tone and
          may return repetitive 1 second intervals of on-hook every
          10 seconds until released.

     B)   AC short and AC open termination - used to test the
          stability of trunks with negative impedance repeaters.
          These test lines:
               -- Trip ringing
               -- Return off-hook supervision
               -- Provide essentially an AC short circuit and an
                  AC open circuit respectively.  They may be equipped
                  with repetitive disconnect features.

     C)   102-type - provides connection to a 1004 Hz power source
          (milliwatt) required for one-way transmission testing.
          Typical features are:
               -- Off-hook supervision
               -- 175 millisecond delay
               -- 1004 Hz at reference level
               -- 1 second interval of on-hook supervision, without
                  tone.  Every 10 seconds until released.
               -- Idle circuit termination during on-hook


          Fixed pads (TP2, TP9) and pad switching signals are included
          in the test line, when required, to furnish proper reference
          level at the switch.

     D)   Synchronous type - enable automatic and manual testing of
          the signaling and supervisor features of trunks not equipped
          to recognize ring forward signals.
               1)   After ringing signal and pretripping test, a 1.3
               second synchronizing pulse (off-hook signal) is sent.
               This synchronizes the automatic progression test equip-
               ment in the originating office with the test line.
               2)   The synchronizing pulse is followed by three 0.2
               second intervals of off-hook.  During the off-hook
               periods, soak current is applied; during the on-hook
               periods an open circuit is presented to the supervisory
               relays.
               3)   A third series of signals may be provided to test
               transfer features of centrex offices.
               4)   Results of tests are as follows:
                    -- 0.3 second bursts of audible ringing at 0.2
                       second intervals indicate that the trunk
                       tripping feature operated on the pretripping
                       test, or
                    -- a tick-tone at 120 IPM, without flash,indicates
                       that all tests are completed.
     E)   Nonsynchronous type - after ringing signal and tripping of
          ringing tests are made, flashing supervisory signals are
          sent.  A typical sequence is:
               -- 1.0 or 1.5 seconds off-hook
               -- 0.5 second on-hook
               -- 1.0 or 1.5 second off-hook
               -- 0.2 second on-hook
               -- 0.3 second off-hook
               -- Repeats of 0.2 second on-hook and 0.3 second
                  off-hook until released.  Low tone is generally
                  applied during off-hook periods.
          In offices also equipped with a synchronous test line, the
          nonsynchronous test line may:
               -- Trip ringing, and
               -- Return alternate 0.5 second off-hook and on-hook
                  signals with low tone applied during the off-hook
                  periods, until released.
     F)   105-types L or T - provide access to a far end automatic
          transmission measuring system (ATMS) responder.  Two-way
          transmission, noise and gain-slope measurements may be made
          between the far end responder and a near end responder under
          control of automatically or manually directed test equip-
          ment.  Gain-slope measurements are made  at 404, 1004 and
          2804 Hz at a transmitting level of -16dBM.  Early type
          responders may not be equipped with this feature.

     G)   106-type - Loop-Around test lines permit manual two way
          transmission measurements without far end assistance.
          Two test line numbers are required for access in class
          5 offices.
               -- Port A, seized alone, provides the functions of a
                  102-type test line.
               -- Port B, seized alone, provides the functions of a
                  100-type test line.
               -- Ports A and B, seized sequentially, enables the
                  loop-around feature.
               1)   Trunk A is directed to Port A and a far-near
               measurement is made and recorded.  With port A held,
               trunk B is directed to port B.  This loops the far end
               transmission paths of ports A and B.
               2)   A reference tone is transmitted near-far over
               trunk B and measured as far-near over trunk A.  The
               first recorded measurement subtracted from the second
               measurement indicates the near-far loss of trunk B.
               3)   Early versions may not be equipped with reference
               tone, and the initial far-near measurement must first
               be ascertained from a 102-type test line.  Also, some
               early versions do not trip ringing on Port A until Port
               B is seized.
          NOTE:  All loop-around test lines should be equipped with
                 60A control units.

     H)   107-type - provides an automatically generated progression
          of test signals.  The durations and sequence is as follows:
               1)   P/AR (Peak to Average Ratio) signal: 15 seconds
               2)   1004 Hz at -16dBM: 10 seconds
               3)   404  Hz at -16dBM: 10 seconds
               4)   2804 Hz at -16dBM: 10 seconds
               5)   Termination (balance): 20 seconds
               6)   1004 Hz at -16dBM: 7.5 minutes
               7)   Terminations: 3 seconds
               8)   Repeats steps (6) and (7) until released by
                    calling end.

This description contained a little additional information about the
subject of Test Numbers. The main items were the acronyms and abbreviations
plus the switching equpiment designations.  The
equipment type ID is very useful because with different types of switches, you
can do different things--IF YOU KNOW HOW!!!!!!

However, not all test number lists include equipment IDS, but most of them do. 
Hope you phreaky phellows and phelines phind this info of use.  Phreak it up,
but be careful-it's getting nasty out there!!!

The following is an article from the January issue of MCI World, a monthly
newsletter published by MCI for it's employees.

THE MANY FACES OF FRAUD

The new year will see a stepped up MCI attack on telephone fraud--illegal use
of the long distance network through access by stolen authorization codes or
electronic devices.  The offensive is led by Everick Bowens, senior manager of
MCI's security investigations department and president of the industry-wide
Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA).  Success in curbing this theft
of service has earned MCI security investigators a reputation as super sleuths
at headquarters and in the divisions.

New teeth were added to the attack on telephone fraud when the U.S. Scret
Service was assigned to augment continuing investigative efforts by the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies.

Because telephone fraud is outright theft from the company, MCI is determined
to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute any illicit use of its network. 
To learn more about how MCI conducts its antifraud campaign, MCI World talked
with Bowens.

MCI World:  Is it true that MCI has systems that can detect fradulent activity
while it is occuring?

Bowens:     Yes: Our fraud systems detect abnormal usage and hacking. The
systems also help us to track down offenders even when we have only the
authorization code he or she is abusing.  Because we can profile abusers and
trace phone calls, it is easier for  us to prepare cases for prosecution.

MCI World:  Abuses involving computer "hacking" to get authorization codes seem
to attract public attention. But there are other types of fraud equally
damaging to the telecommunications industry.  Would you identify some of these?

Bowens:     The primary form of abuse is by "hackers," who use computer
programs to derive customers' authorization codes.  These codes can be widely
disseminated via electronic bulletin boards. Because many of these boards are
public, the codes fall into the hands of anyone with access to the boards. We
also encounter electronic toll fraud, wich involves tone-generating devices
that allow offenders to place fraudulent calls.

MCI World:  Is one type of fraudulent activity more prevalent than another?

Bowens:     Natonwide, fraud  most frequently originates from military posts,
college campuses and prison--places where there are numbers of people far from
home, or who have little else to do but manipulate the telephone.  This type of
abuse prompts the bulk of our investigations.

MCI World:  Who is most likely to commit fraud?  Is there a general profile of
the common offender?

Bowens:     Computer crime typically occurs in affluent, metropolitan suburbs
and involves juveniles.  Electronic fraud also occurs in major metropolitan
areas.  Other abusers, such as high-pressure telemarket-
eers, usually follow the coast lines.  California and Florida, for "boiler
room" operations in which phone service is used illegally to sell merchandise. 
However, fraud can't be totally attributed to any specific group at any
particular time.

MCI World:  How can you keep up withh code abuse and fraud?  Don't offenders
change frequently?

Bowens:     Interestingly enough, the patterns don't change much. Those who
commit fraud form a finite community that doesn't expand a great a great deal
over time.  Casual offenders, individuals who may take advantage of a "hot"
toll free number, will use the number only when it's hot.  Once the number no
longer works, they'er not likely to repeat the offense.  On the other hand,
repeat offenders are dedicated to getting something for nothing.  They're
somewhat easier to identify because they commit the same offense over and over.

MCI World:  How does MCI know when it is the target of fradulent activity?

Bowens:     Our systems generally alert us, or an employee or a customer
informs us.  People know the MCI name.  When they recognize something happening
illegally with an authorization code, they'll get in touch with us.  People
generally feel that a cheat is a cheat, a crook is a crook, and if they have to
pay full value for a phone call they see no reason why someone else shouldn't. 
There also ar professional tipsters who go from one company to another offering
information for a price.  However, we rarely deal with them.

MCI World:  Which MCI people, by the nature of their jobs, are most likely to
detect or at least suspect, fraudulent activity?

Bowens:     Our switch technicians have been very instrumental indetecting
abuse.  They're in a position to identify extensive busy signals on circuits,
abnormal calling patterns and code use.  They've identified many hackers just
by reviewing their daily call statistics. Employees in our billing department
are also good at spotting unusually large bills and abnormal patterns.  Though
most fraud is detected by the systems we ahve in place, the human eye continues
to be extermely helpful.

MCI World:  In addition to working with internal people to help detect
fraudulent activity, you also rely on the expertise of external agencies. Which
outside agencies assist you with investigations.

Bowens:    When fraudulent activity involves the theft or illicit use of
authorizatin codes or credit calling cards, MCI and the Secret Service work
together to investigate the case.  If other activity is involved, such as the
use of our service in furtherance of other crime, MCI works with the FBI.  When
the U.S. Postal Service is manipulated in a fraud case, MCI anb postal
inspectors investigate together.  Additionally, Bell operating companies often
provide hard evidence in cases that MCI prosecutes.

MCI World:  When you are alerted to suspected fraudulent activiy, what steps do
you take to open and pursue the case?

Bowens:     Security investigators contact the customer whose code is being
abused, advise them of MCI's suspicions, and attempt to confirm them.  If the
response confirms their suspicion of fraud, they open
the case.  Normally, an investigation entails much research into toll records
to identify abusers, unusual call patterns and the parties who might be
involved in illicit activity.  We also interview parties receiving the calls
and document their statements.  Once we collect sufficient evidence, we decide
whether a case should be pursued as a criminal or civil action.

MCI World:  How long does it normally take MCI's investigators to "crack" a
case?

Bowens:     Typically, investigators can crack a case within hours. identifying
fraud suspects is the easy part.  Amassing the evidence--dotting all  of the
legal i's and crossing the t's--is tougher.  Gathering evidence may take weeks
and large cases involving many parties can take months to solve.

MCI World:  With fraudulent activity knowing no geographical restricitons, how
do you segment the problem divisionally?

Bowens:     The security investigations department acts primarily in an
advisory capacity, helping investigators in the divisions with procedural
matters.  The divisons generally take responsibility for investigating
fraudulent activity within their jurisdicitons and corporate investigators
pursue cases that are large in scope or require specific expertise.  Coporate
also takes on cases invovling ofenders operating in more than one division.

MCI World:  Cna you elaborte on MIC's goals for reducing the level of
fraudulent activity?

Bowens:     we want to reduce fraud to the lowest possible level.  One of MCI's
goals is to cut fraud by more than half in 1986.  We want to be the industry
leader in curbing this illegal activity.
