First off: This is not meant for a
good phreak, such as, Chris Chronos.
This file is meant for people who are
interested in getting into phreaking.
This is not so much my own work, as it
is a compilation of a bunch of others.
So, don't get uptight if you reconize
stuff.
 
=-]BASICS
 
A phreak is either: 
(1) Someone who just uses mci, etc...
or:
(2) Someone who is into boxing, etc...
--------------------------------------
 
=-]TRASHING
becuz i am saying what comes to mind 
i'll start with this. this is the
*BEST* way for phreaks to get info.
now it was recently brought to my 
atention, that some peopl don't know
what trashing is, so, here is a basic
definetion; Trashing is the art of
raiding your local c.o. (central
office, where all calls are connected)
dumpster, getting printouts, invoices,
 maybe discarded parts, but anything
of interest. Now the way (best) to
do it is, to wait until nite, with
a raincoat, flashlite, something to
carry your goodies home in, go to
you c.o.'s dumpster, climb in, and
get what you will...
  This is a *FEDERAL OFFENSE* (big
deal!), bell has busted a lot of
people for doing dis, so be fucking
careful, if you get anything, post the
results on the boards at the end of
this phile. 
 
-=]CALLING PHREE
 Now this is all the 1st type of phreak
does, #2 phreaks do this also (unless
they're millionares...), so, i'll
explain the basic principle.  You 1st
get an extender/port, what they're is
what mci, sprint, allnet, etc... use.
the basic principle is, you call, 
mci picks up, gives a tone, key in your
code (mci=5 digits), and then the
npa <area code>, and the exchange/#
so, if you wanted to dial say, gse,
you'd go...
123-4567, it'd ring, pick up, type:
517312037756392
^^^^^||||||||||
code phone # to call
it's really quite simple. 
---------------------------------------
-=]INTERESTING NOTE
becuz of a law passed in '82 <i think>,
any phone numbers that are used on
t.v./radio, and occasionaly movies, 
the exchange *MUST* be 555, why,
you might ask...well that is bell's
special exchange, for instance, if
you wanted to get the number for a
place in San Fransisco, but lived in
Flordia, you'd dial: 415-555-1212
415 sends your call to Ca, 555 alerts
the computer to route it with bell's
special calls, and the 1212 tells it
it's an information call (411)...
just thought you'd be interested in 
that.
---------------------------------------
-=]BOXING
Boxing ('specially blue), is the best
way for a phreak to interact with the
phone system, in a future phile i'll
go more into it, but for now, i'll
just give you a basic idea of what
it tis...boxes are electronic 
creations which somehow interact with
the phone system, the famous ones are:
blue: allows you to become an operator
red: simulates coins in a pay (fortress
) phone, allowing phree calls.
and now there is a whold new slew of
'em...such as
mirror: rumored to trace
brown: connects to lines, wierd!
silver: creates 4 new keys for dtmf
(touch tone) pad...
white: portable dtmf pad
cheese:used with call forwarding, 
basically red
black: now defunct, but would work
on bells system of billing.
====================================
the above are just a few of the many
boxes...some have multiple names, such
as, beige or bud..they are basically
lineman's handsets...
------------------------------------
-=]LINEMAN'S HANDSETS
a lineman's handset (lh) is what
the telephone repairmen use to 
help aid in fixing a phone. recently,
when my line was on the fritz, the
repairman came to fix it. i was in
the middle if a phone conversation,
when i hear a bunch of static, and
someone's voice boom out: "is this
555-4980?" my answer was yes, and he
said he was here to repair the line.
what he did was climb up the 
telephone pole, where there was a 
silver box (rectanglish), he opened
it and there were a bunch of pairs
of terminals, each one was a phone line
for that block. The reason for a phreak
to build an lh is to tap into people's
lines to:
(A) make free calls
(B) run it back to his house as a tap
(C) using a,b to call up traced #'s
such as cosmos (bell's computer), and
not worry 'bout getting caught.
(D) this reason is the most fun, to 
harass the operator...
--------------------------------------
-=]COSMOS
 
Okay, becuz this is just a primer, i
won't bother with what to do when you
<and how to> get on a cosmos system,
they will come later in life (err, this
series), but here is what cosmos 
basically consists of:
COSMOS is:
the computer(s) which operators, 
information, the cn/a operator, use.
it is used to keep track of bills.
it can be used to:
trace calls, disconnect phone lines,
order new parts for c.o., set up
loops, establish credit, establish
a new frame (in the computer's mind),
stack calls (make all the lines (trunks
) from here to say tokyo busy! and it
has many more capabilities, as you
can see though, Cosmos is *POWER*,
so it is a vital phreak tool. Now
here is where some ambugitity (howeva
ya spell the shit) forms. Becuz a 
phreak isn't a hacker, how can they use
cosmos, simple, becuz Cosmos is part
of bell, and it is what keeps Bell
running these days, to play hell with
it, is to Phreak, by defintion.
Now while *ALL* hackers are leech
phreaks, some are also true phreaks,
so, there is really no problem, but if
a cloud of doubt had formed in your
mind, this was meant to dis-spell it.
So in a later volume, i will have it
all Cosmos...
--------------------------------------
-=]Switching Systems
a switch system (ss) is what connects,
complete your calls. there are four
main ones (a fifth is being testedin
some hicktown in Pa.), they are:
 
SxS, the 1st switching system, was
invented by an undertaker, becuz
he felt that a biased switchboard
operator was routing all calls for
a undertaker to the operator's husband.
In 1979 53% of the bell network was
SxS (or step by step), and by 1990
only 'bout 10 sxs offices will remain
in the u.s. <wah!, it is the best to
phreak on, even though they do have
penregisters, etc...>
also, with sxs, there is no dtmf
(Dual Tone Multi-Frequency, aka touch-
tone) on sxs, what you might have is a
converter, but then the call goes thru,
just as slowly. So that's sxs now onto:
 
Crossbar;
 Crossbar is the next step up in the
ss hierarchy, crossbar is slightly more
advanced than sxs, and dtmf is real on
it, but it is just 'bout as safe (as
of 11/1/85) as sxs, but remember, just
'bout anything is safe at a fortress
(pay) phone, 'cept if you repeatdly box
there, becuz the s.s. (bell security),
has been known to stake out f.f. 
now onto the world's worst nightmare...
 
---------------------------------------
-=]ESS
I gave ess it's own section, becuz i 
have so much to write 'bout it. ess
stands for: Electronic Switching
System, and thatis just what it is.
by using computers, calls are processed
by copmuter, are connected instantly
after the last digit is dialed, and
can be traced in a mille-second <some
short amount of time, that's approx.
it>, so, ess is quite dangerous (if
you're reckless, i mean i'm on it,
and i haven't been caught yet, course,
i use mci, so bell doesn't give a shit!
), now then back to ess...
ess also can do the following:
call waiting <if somebody else calls
while you are already online, they 
hear a ring, while your hear a slight
tone, you hang-up/pick-up all in 1
second, the orginal party is put on
hold, while you talk to the 2nd party,
you can switch back and forth>
 
speed dialing <kinda stupid, just like
auto-dial memory phones, only it's
stored in the c.o.>
 
call forwarding <key ingredient to a
cheese box, and very useful, if you
were going to be at an orgie say, but
you needed to get your calls, you'd
type: *, then the number you'd be at.
very cool!>
 
three way calling <also cool, allows
you to call someone (a), then using
the same procedure as with call waiting
only instead of someone being on the
other line, you get a dial tone, dial
out, then when party b answers, press
the hung-up switch down for a second, 
release it, and presto, you have a
three way connection (mini-conference).
 
those are the main "home" features
offered by ess, besides that, if you
don't pay your bill, it takes one
minute to disconnect your line (see
cosmos section above)
well, there is more info on ess, but
i don't remember it off hand....
-=}Digital
related to ess, only totaly electronic,
whereas with ess there were still
some switches, this is all solid
(altered, haha) states, which reminds
me, with ess/digital, it is
very easy for the phone co. to tap your
line <it is a little harder in other
ss's>, of course with the advent of
remobs, it is now east in any ss...
______________________________________
Special Note Related to Above:
ciss, don't know what it stands
for, but it incorparates every
thing that digital/ess does plus
a couple of other things, the main one
is auto-tracing from the house, what
happenes, is when somebody calls you,
you press a button on your phone, and
a thermal printer prints out the number
of the person who is calling you.  This
probally won't catch on (thank you god!
) though becuz it requires leasing a
phone with a printer attached for 'bout
$30 a month, tres expensive!
=======================================
-=]REMOBS
a remobs, whilei don't have any at
the moment, they are incredibly cool.
can tap into somebody's line by:
dialing up the remob, dialing in
the access code, then the #, without
npa, becuz these can't cover a whole 
npa, just a part of it, then you are
tapped into the line, you can listen
in, but your mouthpeice is cut-off
(if noone's using the phone, you hear
silence, but calls can still be 
recived/initaited), plus there
is some other shit it can do...
=====================================
