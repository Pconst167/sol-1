               Equal Access and Modem Autodialers by Shadow 2600

    Now that AT&T is being divested of its local telephone companies, phone
customers across the nation have to choose their long distance carrier as equal
access is phased in.  Advertising campaigns emphasize such aspects as low rates
and operator assistance, but no one mentions a factor that will affect modem
users who use auto dialers for long distance calls.  Not all of the alternate
long distance carriers provide called party answering supervision on all calls.
Called party answering supervision basically has the telephone company start
billing only when the called party answers the telephone.  However, many of the
alternate long distance companies still operate with the "fixed timeout" basis
for charging.  That is, if a call is held for a fixed length of time (usually
30 seconds) the charging starts, whether or not the call was answered.  This
could cause modem owners large bills if they use autodialers to make long
distance calls.  Modems are usually set up to wait up to one minute when
attempting to make a call, and thus have to timeout through busy signals, long
call setup sequences, extender waits, and similar problems.  This could result
in many billed but never answered calls.

    Some of the other carriers provide it on calls to some cities, and others
not support it at all.  Only AT&T Communications provides called party
answering supervision on all calls to all points at this time.  It is almost
impossible to get information on how a long distance company charges its calls
as as they don't want to reveal how their billing is handled.  The alternate
carriers get called party supervision when the destination location goes equal
access.  However, there has been no quick action on the part of the alternate
long distance companies to make use of the supervision data as they would have
to get equipment for passing the information back to the billing computer at
the originating point.  Thus called party answering supervision information
often ends up being ignored by these carriers even when available.  Another
point to remember is that called party answering supervision's availability
depends on whether the destination has equal access, not the originating
location.  The lower long distance rates of alternate long distance rates must
be weighed against the time out problem as it affects autodialing modems.  One
way to circumvent this is merely to set your modem to a shorter
waiting-for-connect time, but this may not provide enough time for the call to
go through.  [For more information on this and other telecommunications topics

                Toward Universal Information Services Via ISDN
                ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~
                                 by Taran King

                From PROTO newsletter of AT&T Bell Laboratories
         ------------------------------------------------------------
Phase one, the Present.
~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~
  The local network of today, although still largely voice-oriented, is already
on the path to Universal Information Services.  Lightguide fiber is
dramatically expanding the capacity of local networks, helping to lower the
costs and increase the demand for high-band width, Information Age services.
And public networks are increasingly digital and geared for data and special
 services.  For example:

o   The AT&T Network Systems 5ESS (TM <riiiight>) switch, designed by Bell
Laboratories, can serve as the hub of a local deployment of remote modules at
locations up to 100 miles from a host central office.

o   The Integrated Special Services Network (ISSN) is a channel network that
provides special services, customer control options and digital private lines
rearrangeable under software control. The ISSN incorporates digital carrier
terminating equipment such as the D4 Channel Bank, D5 Digital Terminal System
and Digital Access and Cross-connect System (DACS).

o   The New Centrex is bringing greater levels of customer control, improved
services and a broad range of data capabilities to the business customer.

   Today's public networks consist of multiple or overlay networks. The public
switched network, or circuit network, mainly for voice, is the base network.
Two kinds of overlay networks provide special services.  Channel networks carry
private lines leased by large customers and transmit much of today's data and
image traffic; they also handle traffic for network operations support.  Packet
networks carry data communications, while packet switching is used internally
to public networks for common channel signaling to set up, route and take down
calls, or to give customers information. "Overlay networks help
telecommunications companies efficiently meet growing demand for digital
transmission and special services," says Stan Johnston, Market Planning
Manager, Network Systems Evolution, in AT&T Network Systems. "Their integration
into a single network, however, would be still more effective."

Phase two, the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
  The ISDN is a concept to which AT&T is committed - and it's the foundation
for Universal Information Services.  The central idea of ISDN, as AT&T Network
Systems sees it, is to provide an individual user a link to the local central
office of generous band-width - a digital subscriber line that can carry
144,000 bits per second (sure beats 2400 baud!).  The band-width is subdivided
into two 64,000-bit channels, which may carry voice or data or both, and one
16,000-bit channel for packetized signaling information or data transport.
Such a link provides convenient "integrated" network access by accommodating
voice, data and signaling over a single line.
  The ISDN will make it easier for a customer to get varied services from
public and private networks.  More bandwidth for big customers will be
available through another ISDN access standard, the extended digital subscriber

                                    Page 161




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

line, which provides 1.5 billion bits per second as 24 channels of 64,000 bits
each.
   In 1986, new software from Bell Labs will enable the 5ESS switch to
accommodate ISDN-sized 144,000-bit channels that standardize and simplify
subscribers' use of local networks.  AT&T is committed to future products that
will also be ISDN-compatible.  Other vendors, too, some of whom already plan to
build premises, terminal, and other equipment to ISDN standards, will make ISDN
a cooperative effort.
   By providing integrated digital access to networks, ISDN will make important
progress toward the goal of Universal Information Services. But overlay
networks will continue to divvy up the transport job.  And messages needing
less than 144,000 bits per second will not fill their allotted bandwidth,
leaving capacity under utilized.

Phase three, Universal Information Services.
~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
   Rooted in the fertile ground of 5ESS switches, ISDN equipment and
technologies such as wideband packet transport, Universal Information Services
will bear fruit during the 1990s.  From a single kind of network will hang
services as different as apples, oranges and pears. Just as network access was
integrated in ISDN, transport functions will increasingly be integrated by
powerful new network equipment evolved from equipment developed for the ISDN.
Where customers once got standard-sized ISDN channels, they'll get big
bandwidth for large jobs, little bandwidth for small jobs.

MCI Communications Corporation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., provides a
full range of domestic and international telecommunications services, including
voice and data, telex and cable, paging and mobile telephone, and time
sensitive message delivery.

Since its founding in 1968, MCI has grown to more than $1.6 billion in annual
sales and serves more than 1.9 million business, residential and government
customers through its four major business units:

MCI Telecommunications

MCI Airsignal

MCI International

MCI Digital Information Services


MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS

   MCI Telecommunications provides domestic interstate long distance service
throughout all 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and major
calling areas of Canada.  It is also authorized to provide varying degrees of
intrastate long distance service in some states.

MCI also is the first long distance carrier other than AT&T to offer direct
dial service overseas.  International telephone service is available to all
residential and commercial customers (with the exception of Private Line
customers).  In October, 1984 the first international service agreements were
announced with the following countries:  Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, East
Germany, Greece, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Total capital investment in MCI's long distance network is approximately $2
billion.  MCI's network, the second largest in the U.S., employs microwave
optical fiber, satellite and various digital transmission technologies.

MCI INTERNATIONAL

MCI International provides private-line voice service to several overseas
countries, and data and message services, including telex, cablegram, leased
channel, and packet switching communications, to more than 200 overseas points.
MCI has moved into two new areas of service:  International direct-dial
telephone service and international electronic mail and hard-copy delivery
services.

International Record Services

TELEX SERVICE   (domestic and international) permits instantaneous, two-way,
written communications with other subscribers worldwide.  Customers can send
messages at any time, even though the receiving terminal may be unattended. MCI
International offers access to its telex service from a variety of terminals
and networks; not only subscribers with telex terminals but also those with
communicating word processors, data terminals or computers that communicate
over telephone lines can take advantage of MCI International telex service.  To
subscribers connected to its own telex network, MCI International offers World
Message Services--a package of communications offerings including telex,
cablegram and MCI Mail services.  Various service enhancements are available to
save time, improve operating efficiency and simplify records keeping for telex
users.

CABLEGRAM SERVICE, the traditional means of international written
communications, offers flexibility in delivery and economical rates for shorter
messages.  Cablegrams can be delivered to virtually any overseas
point.Subscribers with telex terminals or various other types of equipment can
access and TELUS cablegram switch and take advantage of such service

                                    Page 167




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

enhancements as abbreviated addressing and departmental billing.

LEASED
CHANNEL SERVICE  provides an exclusive line between a U.S. firm and it's
overseas office for private communications 24 hours a day.  Each MCI
International leased channel is tailored to meet the needs of a specific
customer for teleprinter, facsimile, voice and/or data traffic. For subscribers
with several offices requiring private communications with each other, MCI
International offers a versatile message-switching service. Voice/data leases
can be configured to meet a whole array of communicating needs; for example,
one channel might carry data traffic from a computer at night, voice
communications during office hours, and simultaneous teleprinter messages at
any time.  Data channels can handle requirements for traffic at any speed from
1200 bits per second to 1.544 megabits per second.

IMPACS SERVICE   uses packet-switching technology to provide international
communications service between data terminals and computers.  Impacs offers
on-line, real-time connections and enables many types of incompatible systems
to communicate.  Impacs service offers virtually error-free transmission
because of the error-detection and retransmission capability of the network.

INSTALINK SERVICE allows businesses overseas to use regular telex equipment to
access remote computing systems and databases in the U.S.  Subscribers can
retrieve data from a computer-based information service or use a computing
system connecting to a packet-switching network in the U.S.

INTERNATIONAL
FACSIMILE SERVICE enables subscribers to send duplicates of original documents
overseas quickly and efficiently, even when neither the sender or the receiver
has facsimile transmission equipment, or when the sender and receiver have
incompatible equipment.

DATEL SERVICE  provides automatic or voice-coordinated data transmission at
speeds up to 2400 bits per second. Either digital or analog facsimile traffic
can be transmitted via Datel.  Datel facilities are conditioned to ensure
high-quality transmission.  The MCI International switching center allows
communications between incompatible terminals.

MARITIME SERVICES   provide instant, high--quality contact between ships at sea
or offshore rigs, and between these vessels and land-based subscribers
worldwide.

International Voice Services

PRIVATE
LINE SERVICE   provides, fast, easy access to a single overseas location at an
economical monthly rate.  This technically efficient system maximizes the use
of line capacity by recognizing idle time and assigning a speaker to a
transmission path only when the path is needed.  Users can dial a four-digit
extension from a regular business phone to reach a key overseas location.

International Mail Services

WORLD
MESSAGE SERVICE   subscribers can access the domestic electronic mail and
hard-copy delivery offerings of MCI Mail.  In addition, MCI International is
developing fast, low-cost services that will deliver electronic messages and
high-quality printed documents worldwide.

Customer Service

THE CUSTOMER TROUBLE REPORTING ASSISTANCE CENTER at MCI International addresses
customer concerns such as equipment maintenance and service performance
questions.  Customer service specialists, on duty 24 hours a day on business
days, answer questions and electronically route service requests to technicians
nationwide.

services.  MCI Mail can be delivered electronically, terminal to terminal, or
laser printed on letterhead stationery with the customer's signature.

MCI Mail customers can even order gifts and services direct through MCI Mail,
ranging from software and paper for personal computers to investment advisory
services to travel specials.

There are no sign-up, monthly service charges or "connect time" charges for MCI
Mail.  MCI Mail can be used by virtually any personal computer, word processor,
electronic typewriter, data terminal, telex, or other digital communications
device.  The service is accessed by a local telephone call or 800 number.

MCI Mail

INSTANT delivery to an "electronic" mailbox.

FOUR-HOUR paper delivery by courier to 17 major metropolitan areas regardless
of point of origin.

OVERNIGHT paper delivery by courier by noon the next day in 20,000 continental
U.S. cities.

To dial international calls:

International Access Code + Country code + Routing code

Example :

To call Frankfurt, Germany, you would do the following:

011 + 49 + 611 + (# wanted) + # sign(octothrope)

The # sign at the end is to tell Bell that you are done entering in all the
needed info.

                            TYPED BY THE GHOST WIND

                         FROM THE BOOK BUILD YOUR OWN
         LASER, PHASER, ION RAY GUN & OTHER WORKING SPACE-AGE PROJECTS
                       BY ROBERT IANNINI (TAB BOOKS INC)

Description:  Briefly, the Infinity Transmitter is a device which activates a
microphone via a phone call.  It is plugged into the phone line, and when the
phone rings, it  will immediately intercept the ring and broadcast into the
phone any sound that is in the room. This device was originally made by
Information Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did not
know the code from being able to use the phone in its normal way.  This
version, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it is
in operation.
NOTE:  It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is also
pretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.

Circuit Operation: Not being the most technical guy in the world, and not being
very good at electronics (yet),  I'm just repeating what Mr. Iannini's said
about the circuit operation.  The Transmitter consists of a high grain
amplifier fed into the telephone lines via transformer.  The circuit is
initiated by the action  of  a voltage transient pulse occurring across  the
phone line  at the instant the telephone circuit is made (the ring,  in other
words).  This transient immediately triggers a timer  whose output  pin  3 goes
positive, turning on transistors Q2 and  Q3. Timer TM1 now remains in this
state for a period depending on the values  of R17 and C13 (usually about 10
seconds for  the  values shown). When Q3 is turned on by the timer, a simulated
"off hook" condition is created by the switching action of Q3 connecting the
500  ohm  winding  of the transformer directly across  the  phone lines.
Simultaneously, Q2 clamps the ground of A1, amplifier, and Q1, output
transistor, to the negative return of B1,B2, therefore enabling this amplifier
section.  Note that B2 is always required by  supplying  quiescent power to TM1
during  normal conditions. System is off/on controlled by S1 (switch).
  A  crystal mike picks up the sounds that are fed to  the  first two
transistors of the A1 array connected as an emitter follower driving the
remaining  two  transistors  as  cascaded   common emitters. Output of the
array now drives Q1 capacitively coupled to  the  1500 ohm  winding of  T1.
R7  controls  the  pick  up sensitivity of the system.
  Diode  D1  is  forward biased at the instant of  connection  and essentially
applies a negative pulse at pin 2 of TM1,  initiating the cycle.   D2 clamps
any high positive pulses.   C9 dc-isolates and desensitizes the circuit. The
system described should operate when any incoming call is made without ringing
the phone.

Schematic Diagram:  Because this is text,  this doesn't look  too hot. Please
use  a little imagination!  I will hopefully get  a graphics drawing  of  this
out as soon as I  can  on  a  Fontrix graffile.

To be able to see what everything is, this character: | should appear as a
horizontal bar. I did this on a ][e using a ][e 80 column card, so I'm sorry if
it looks kinda weird to you.

Construction notes: Because the damned book just gave a picture instead of step
by step instructions, and I'll try to give you as much help as possible. Note
that all the parts that you will be using are clearly labeled in the schematic.
The perfboard, knobs, 'gator clips, etc are optional. I do strongly suggest
that you do use the board!!! It will make wiring the components up much much
easier than if you don't use it.
 The knob you can use to control the pot (R7). R7 is used to tune the IT so
that is sounds ok over the phone. (You get to determine what sounds good) By
changing the value of C13, you can change the amount of time that the circuit
will stay open (it cannot detect a hang up, so it works on a timer.) A value of
100 micro Farads will increase the time by about 10 times.
 The switch (S1) determines whether or not the unit is operational. Closed is
on. Open is off. The negative return is the negative terminals of the battery!!
The batteries will look something like this when hooked up:

                                    Page 201

 To hook this up to the phone line, there are three ways, depending upon what
type of jack you have. If it is the old type (non modular) then you can just
open up the wall plate and connect the wires from the transmitter directly to
the terminals of the phone.
 If you have a modular jack with four prongs, attach the red to the negative
prong (don't ask me which is which! I don't have that type of jack... I've only
seen them in stores), and the green to the positive prong, and plug in. Try not
to shock yourself...
 If you have the clip-in type jack, get double male extension cord (one with a
clip on each end), and chop off one clip. Get a sharp knife and splice off the
grey protective material. You should see four wires, including one green and
one red. You attach the appropriate wires from the IT to these two, and plug
the other end into the wall.

Getting the IT to work: If you happen to have a problem, you should attempt to
do the following (these are common sense rules!!) Make sure that you have the
polarity of all the capacitors right (if you used polarized capacitors, that
is). Make sure that all the soldering is done well and has not short circuited
something accidently (like if you have a glob touching two wires which should
not be touching.) Check for other short circuits. Check to see if the battery
is in right. Check to make sure the switch is closed.
 If it still doesn't work, drop me a line on one of the Maryland or Virginia
BBSs and I'll try to help you out.

The sense output: Somehow or other, it is possible to hook something else up to
this and activate it by phone (like an alarm, flashing lights, etc.)

As of this writing, I have not tried to make one of these, but I will. If you
actually get it working, leave me a note somewhere.

I sure hope all you people appreciate this.

PARTS & EQUIPMENT:
(1) POCKET TONE DIALER  (RADIO SHACK CAT. NO. 43-138)
(2) SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW SWITCH  (TOGGLE, THE SMALLER THE BETTER)
(3) SOLDERING IRON

     THIS MODIFICATION WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF A,B,C,&D TONES. WHEN YOU
FLIP THE SWITCH THE 3,6,9,&# KEYS WILL BECOME A,B,C,&D RESPECTIVELY.  THE IC
INSIDE THE DIALER IS CAPABLE OF MAKING THESE TONES ALREADY, ALL WE MUST DO IS
CONNECT IT FULLY.  THIS MOD CAN ALSO BE MADE TO MANY ELECTRONIC FONES THAT
CONTAIN A DTMF TONE ENCODING IC. THIS CHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE NUMBER 5089
OR S2559 OR MK5380 OR TCM5087N.  PIN 9 OF THESE CHIPS IS THE FOURTH COLUMN
KEYPAD INPUT WHILE PIN 5 IS THE THIRD COLUMN.  NOW ON WITH THE CONSTRUCTION.

1)    REMOVE THE BATTERY COVER, BATTERIES, AND THE SMALL SCREW. THE CASE SHOULD
NOW POP OPEN WITH A LITTLE PRESSURE.
2)    OPEN THE CASE SO THAT THE HALF CONTAINING THE SPEAKER AND THE BATTERIES
IS ON YOUR LEFT WITH THE BATTERIES ON THE BOTTOM. YOU SHOULD NOW BE LOOKING AT
THE BACK OF 2 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS.
3)  FIND THE TWO ROWS OF SOLDER BEADS WHERE THE IC IS CONNECTED.  THE UPPER
LEFT PIN OF THE 2 ROWS SHOULD HAVE NO SOLDER ON IT. THIS IS PIN 9 OF THE IC.
4)  ATTACH A SHORT WIRE TO PIN 9.
