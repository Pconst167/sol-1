Phreaker Scams

Every business should be aware that there has been an outbreak of 
attempted telephone fraud which targets PBX systems. Some 
of the more frequently used tactics to breach the systems include:

1. An outside caller pretending to be a telephone maintenance technician 
reaches a victims extension and asks the victim to participate in a 
test of the telephone line or the touch tones by dialing 9-0-# or 9-0-0 
and then hang-up; DON'T DO IT! This is an attempt by the phreaker to 
connect to an outside line operator and get long-distance access from 
your business's extension and thus your company would be charged for the long
distance calls.

2. Another way for the would-be phreaker to get fraudulent access to a toll 
operator is to call into an extension and, pretending to have reached 
the wrong number, ask the person to transfer the call to an extension 
beginning with 9-0 or 9-0-0, e.g., 9001, 9015, 9027, etc. DON'T DO IT!

Beware of any forwarding or call transfer request from a caller you 
don't know. Never agree to a transfer request or to participate in a 
telephone "test" if it includes as a first digit an outside line access 
number. 

Most of these scams target businesses and  not residential customers so don't be afraid 
little kiddies.

Do not try this at home kids...because the person you call will be on that business's COLLECT
call record.  *duH*
