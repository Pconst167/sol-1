 ------------------------

 FROM 2600......

DID YOU KNOW THAT PHREAKING STARTED
FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY SOURCE......  
           CAP'N CRUNCH CEREAL!
YES, IN THE 1960'S A TOY WHISTLE WAS
PLACED IN THE FAMOUS CEREAL.  
UNFORTUNATELY (NOT FOR US),THE WHISTLE
GENERATED 2,600 CYCLE-TONE, DUDE! A 
YOUNG MAN WHO JUST ENTERED THE USAF
AS A RADIO TECH., WAS FASCINATED WHEN 
HE DISCOVERED THAT BLOWING THE WHISTLE
INTO THE FONE AFTER DIALING ANY LONG-
DISTANCE # AND HEAING THE DISCONNECT
SIGNAL, THE TRUNK WOULD REMAIN OPEN 
WITHOUT TOLL CHARGES ACCOUNTING, AND
THEN ON, ANY NUMBER COULD BE DIALED 
REPEATEDLY. 800 #'S (INWATS) , WERE
LATER USED AS THE STARTER CALL TO
AVOID ANY CHARGES. HE USED THIS TO
CALL HOME WHILE STATIONED IN ENGLAND.

THE CAP'N PRACTICED FOR YEARS. HE
REPORTEDLY WOULD PLACE CALLS AROUND
THE WORLD TO HIMSELF.
HE WOULD THEN TALK AND HERE HIMSELF
20 SEC. LATER.  HE WENT ON TO 
DISCOVER THE OPERATOR CODES INCLUDING
AUTO-RELAY (OPERATOR INTERUPT, OR
VERIFY BUSY).
THUS, EAVESDROPPING IN CONVERSATIONS.
HE CLAIMED TO LISTEN IN ON THE 
FOLLOWING: 1. PRES. OF THE USA 2. FBI
WHEN IT WAS AFTER PATTY HEARST 3. THE
SECT. OF DEFENSE 4. AND VARIOUS
MILITARY BASES THRU AUTOVON.

CAP'N CRUNCH WAS THRUST INTO THE
SPOTLITE WITH AN ARTICLE IN ESQUIRE.
THE TERM "BLUE BOX" CAME ABOUT BECAUSE
THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS CAPTURED WAS
THAT COLOR. THE CAP'N SOON WENT BEYOND
THE SIMPLE WHISTLE TO MORE COMPLICATED
DEVICES.
