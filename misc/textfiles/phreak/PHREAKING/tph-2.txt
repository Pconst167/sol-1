                  SIMPLE STEPS TO BEIGE BOXING & OUTPUT DEVICES
                  ---------------------------------------------
          First  thing  you  ask is what is a beige box? Yeah I know, well, 
     here's  an  explanation.  A  beige  box is merely a portable lineman's 
     telephone  that  has  clips  on  the  end  of it's cord or clips and a 
     modular  plug  on  the  end  of the cord to facilitate the use of both 
     modular  and unconventional methods of connecting this phone to a free 
     line.  If you have guessed right, the clips are for the unconventional 
     connections  and  the  modular plug is the typical plug that fits into 
     the female modular connector in your own home.
     
          Then  you  say,  big  deal,  they have portable telephones, and I 
     don't.  Besides,  I don't have a portable telephone, the most portable 
     one  I  have  is  the one in my car, and that one's no biggie... Well, 
     WRONG,  a  beige  box  can  be very useful and entertaining as a phone 
     phreak's  tool/toy.  For  instance,  have  you ever wanted to call the 
     operator  and  bitch  at  her  and  threaten  all of your phone phreak 
     attempts  to  undermine  your  local  telco  at  her? Or have you ever 
     wanted  to  phuck  someone  over real bad with the OWN phone system so 
     that  they  get  into a helluva mess with the telco? Or ever wanted to 
     experiment  with  a  certain  kind of box, but you thought it might be 
     too  risky  or  something? Maybe you wanted to tap lines, phuck people 
     over,  get  free calls, mess with the telco, and do everything without 
     the risk of being traced. Sound impossible? Sound good?
     
          Well,  now that I have gotten you to listen, calm down! Remember, 
     all  this  is  is  a  phone,  a  portable  one  that  can be hooked up 
     unconventionally.  This  in  itself is, I agree, no big deal. However, 
     the  uses  of  such  a  fone  are unlimited. With a beige box, one can 
     enter  any  output  device  and easily connect their fone onto another 
     line  or  an open line and phuck with it! This is the part that I will 
     cover  in  detail,  the  connection  and  the  physical aspects of the 
     various  telco  output  devices,  and how to use beige boxes properly. 
     Now,   if   you   are  interested  enuff,  follow  the  STEP  BY  STEP 
     instructions and you'll be on your way...
     
     
     STEP I::Building Your Own Beige Box
     -----------------------------------
          So  you  want  to  build  a  beige  box, eh? Well, all it is is a 
     telephone  equipped with some clips to ease hooking this baby onto any 
     wires  or  terminals  that  you might run into, instead of the typical 
     modular  plug  found  on  most fones. Here's the basics on how to make 
     one.
     
          A  beige  box  can  be made two ways. The first way is the method 
     where  you  must take apart a fone for optimum results. The second way 
     can  use  a  regular  fone  with  no  taking  or  breaking involved. I 
     personally  prefer the take and break method since you can add as many 
     extra features on the fone as you like.
     
     Method 1 - The Take And Break Method
          Ok,  get  a  real  cheap  fone  at a real cheap store, preferably 
     touch  tone  if  it  is  offered in your area. Or, get a fone you have 
     that  you don't use anymore. The best kind of fone for this box is the 
     kind  that  has  the touch tone pad and the mouthpiece/earpiece in one 
     unit  that  can be plugged directly into a modular outlet (ie, no base 
     station  thing  that weighs 10 pounds). Then, if this fone is the kind 
     that  has  the  modular  female  connector in it then stick a plug and 
     fone  cord in it so that you have at least 5' of cord attached to your 
     fone.  If  your  fone  has  cord built into it, then you don't have to 
     worry about this.
     
          Then,  you  take  the  fone  cord,  and strip the outside rubbery 
     layer  off  and  you should see four smaller wires inside, red, green, 
     black,  and  yellow. Cut off the black and yellow wires, and strip the 
     red  and  green  wires.  The  red  wire is called the "ring" while the 
     green is called the "tip", remember this.
     
          Ok,  now that you have stripped wire, get some alligator clips or 
     some  clips  of  some  sort that will open at least to 1cm across, and 
     attache  one to each wire, the red and green. Now, you have yourself a 
     primitive  beige  box.  If you want to make it a bit more "technical," 
     you  can  open  your  cheap fone and cut one of the wires going to the 
     microphone  (mouthpiece)  and  connect it to a SPST switch (2 terminal 
     type)  which  will make a great mute switch when tapping lines. If you 
     happen  to  have  a  DPST switch (6 terminal type) handy, you can make 
     the  switch-hook  into  a switch instead of a button, which is helpful 
     (at  least  I think so). Also, if you are good at electronics, you can 
     mess  around  with  the insides of your fone and make it into a silver 
     box,  which  will  yield  more  phun  things to do with your beige box 
     (hey, two boxes in one then!).
     
     Method Two - The Fone Saver Method
          Ok,  you  don't  wanna  mess  with the breaking apart and messing 
     with  the  insides  of  a  phone or cords. Then, get yourself a phone, 
     preferably  touch  tone, at least five feet of phone cord, and a phone 
     jack  (ie,  wall  outlet jack that you stick fone cord into). Now, get 
     the  fone  jack  and look at it, it should have 4 wires going into the 
     jack.  These  wires  should  be colored black, yellow, red, and green. 
     Cut  the  black and yellow wires off and strip the red and green ones. 
     Put  clips on the end of the red and green wires, clips that will open 
     to  1cm  across  minimum  or  your  beige  box will be hard to install 
     quickly.  Now  remember  this,  the red wire is called the "ring," and 
     the  green wire is called the "tip." Ok, now, take the fone cord, plug 
     it  into  your  fone  and  then  plug the other end into your modified 
     jack. You are set with a primitive beige box.
     
     
     STEP II::Phucking Around With Your Beige Box
     --------------------------------------------
          Now,  you  either  have  a  beige box or are bored and decided to 
     read  this  lengthy info anyway. So, you have a beige box, right! Now, 
     you  wanna  mess with it... Go look around your neighborhood or cruise 
     around  in  a  car  if you have access to one and look for the telco's 
     output  devices;  the ones in southern California are green and are of 
     various  shape  and  size, but all are ugly! By the way, the technical 
     name  for  these  green  bases  are  "Controlled  Access  Design (CAD) 
     Pedestals".  These  green  bases  usually  come in a few sizes, I have 
     seen  many  kinds.  There  are  green  bases  that are about 4"x6"x36" 
     (approximate    dimensions),   6"x6"x36"   (approximate   dimensions), 
     8"x8"x36"    (approximate    dimensions),    12"x8"x36"   (approximate 
     dimensions),  and larger ones with handles that pop open when you turn 
     the  lock  bolt.  All  of  these green bases can be opened universally 
     with  a 7/16" wrench; however, these devices usually have some sort of 
     guard  against  typical  wrenches  but socket wrenches and hex drivers 
     will work fine.
     
          To  open  the  regular  sized  green  bases  without  the  silver 
     handles,  all  you  hafta  do is loosen the bolts at the sides holding 
     the  front  cover  in  place. Then, lift up on the bottom of the front 
     lid  and  pull  out; this should pull the cover out of place, exposing 
     the  treasure  inside. However, if you chose a real boonie spot in the 
     middle  of  nowhere,  such as unfinished construction sites, there may 
     be  nothing  on the inside and you will hafta go look for another one. 
     To  open  the ones with the silver handles, all you hafta do is follow 
     directions  (it  says  turn  1/8  counterclockwise on the handle!), so 
     turn  the  bolt  above  the handle 1/8 counterclockwise and the handle 
     should  pop  up and the green box should pop partially open. Then open 
     the big sucker up and check out the inside.
     
          Allright,  you  have  infiltrated  a green base, now what? If you 
     have  done  everything  correctly  and  haven't chosen a bad base, you 
     should  see a bunch of bolts or screws connected to a piece of plastic 
     or  material  in pairs creating a long strip of pairs. This pairing of 
     screws/bolts  in  a  group on a block of material (usually plastic) is 
     called  a  terminal  block. Sometimes there is a thick black wire that 
     enters  the  terminal  block at either end of the block. You might see 
     two  or  more  of  these pair blocks if you have picked a big box in a 
     busy  area.  Either way, if the base has a block and pairs inside, you 
     should see something like this:

          If  you  see  something  like the above, you should also see some 
     small  wires  connecting  to  a  few  of the 0's and O's, if so, those 
     wires  go  to  some nearby house, and you are pretty much in business. 
     If  you  don't  see any wires connected to the 0's or O's, read on and 
     hope this one is live...
     
          The  terminal  block shown above is probably the most common type 
     of  block  used, however, you might see some blocks that look like the

          Now,  do  you  see  a  pattern  evolving here? Yes, there are two 
     types  of  terminal  blocks,  the  single  sided and the dual sided. I 
     really  don't  know the difference, just that the dual sided has twice 
     as  many  terminals.  Anyway,  remember this. Ring Right Red, the Ring 
     always  connects  to  the  RIGHT terminal, and is Red. The Tip, figure 
     that one out if you are not stupid!
     
          Ok,  if  you have followed me this far, I am going extremely slow 
     for  you  slow  people,  so listen up. If there are wires connected to 
     any  screws  or bolts on the terminal block, those ones are, for sure, 
     connected,  so  if  worse  comes  to  worse,  you  can tap or use them 
     (unless  you  were planning to tap them in the first place). From this 
     point,  if  you see no wires connected to the bolts or see some, place 
     the  tip  of  your fone on an UNUSED (no wires) tip side of a terminal 
     and  the  ring  side  of  your  fone  to the matching ring side of the 
     terminal.  Listen  to your fone, if you have a dial tone, you have hit 
     the  jackpot. Dial whatever or box off that line or ANI if you want to 
     know  what  number  you  are  calling  from.  Read  further  for other 
     possibilities of this great box.
     
          If  you  see  no  wires on this terminal, the line belongs to the 
     telco,  and  they can trace it but will have no address listing for it 
     (hehe...).  On  the  other  hand,  if  you  don't get anything or just 
     static,  try  some  more  unused  ones,  and  if  you  have  no unused 
     terminals  on  your  terminal  block,  then go for the used terminals; 
     these  live  terminals  will  be connected to homes or businesses VERY 
     nearby  so  you  might suddenly break into a conversation or something 
     (if  someone  picks  the  fone up, yell at them, etc, phuck with them, 
     etc,  they  probably won't know what the phuck is going on) that could 
     be  really  neet,  now,  understand how the tapping part works? If you 
     are  tapping  a  line  and  want to know more about the person you are 
     tapping  (if  you don't know who you are tapping), you always can dial 
     ANI  and  then  inquire  your  CN/A bureau for more info. You can also 
     locate  a  certain  fone  #  in  a base by using the ANI over and over 
     (tiring, but works).
     
          If  you have the primitive beige box with the fone jack attached, 
     to  reduce  static upon connection, remove the fone cord from the jack 
     and  place  the  clips on the tip and ring of the terminal. Then, with 
     the  fone  on (switch-hook up) put the fone cord in the jack. This may 
     reduce  the  suspicion of tapping if the person you are monitoring has 
     anything  to be suspicious about in the first place. Also, if you have 
     a  fone  with  a  mute switch, turn it on if you are tapping, then you 
     can laugh and cry and shit and the tapped person will not hear it.
     
          Now,  understand  the  concept  of  the  beige box? You are using 
     someone  else's  line...  hehe...  that mean you can dial LD for free, 
     phuck  with  the  operator(s),  call Alliance direct, tap the line you 
     are  connected  to,  put  recorders and shit on the line directly from 
     the  green  base,  make the line busy forever (stick a wire across the 
     tip  and  the  ring so they short), box directly from your line, phuck 
     people  over  from  your  line  (like they will see their fone bill or 
     Pheds  at  their  door  for boxing or LD calls), and anything you want 
     without  the  fear  of  being  traced  or  caught (unless you choose a 
     stupid base in front of a police station or telco!).
     
          If  you  are  a  bit more quick, all you hafta do is make a beige 
     box,  open  a green base with the 7/16" socket wrench/hex wrench. Find 
     an  open  terminal  that works or seize/tap one that is connected. Tap 
     it, use it or abuze it. Close the base. Leave the site!
     
          To  insure  safety  in  beige  boxing  and  phucking  with output 
     devices,  you  should  place  a  piece  of  transparent tape over some 
     obscure  place  on  the  base so that if it is opened in your absence, 
     you  will  notice  the  displacement  of  the tape and you can get the 
     phuck  out  of  there. Also, choose a spot where neighbors and curious 
     policemen  will not bother your beige boxing, nightime is a great time 
     to  go  beige boxing. Use more than one output device, the Gestapo has 
     been  known  to  stake  out pay fones, why shouldn't they stake out an 
     over-used green base?
     
     
     SUMMARY OF EVENTS::The Do's And Dont's Of Beige Boxing
     ------------------------------------------------------
     The Do's:
          1) DO call Alliance Direct
          2) DO call long distance phriends direct
          3) DO bitch at the operator and threaten the bring the telco
             down with a phederation of phreakers
          4) DO tap other people and phuck with them if they pick their
             fone up while you are beige boxing
          5) DO phuck with the output device so that you record off the
             line, make it busy forever, or something
          6) DO box directly off of a seized line, who cares if they trace
          7) DO phuck people over by unlawfully using their line which
             gets traced to THEM
          8) DO call anything and anywhere
          9) DO phuck with the output device, like switching the fone
             wires around so the lines are crossed, changed, all on one
             extension, or blow the base up if you are pissed
     
     The Dont's
          1) DO NOT use only one output device excessively
          2) DO NOT beige box where people are apt to see you and get
             suspicious
          3) DO NOT post your accomplishments on public BBS's under your
             real name
          4) DO NOT let your phriends let the Pheds or any inquiring
             person know that you placed an illegal phone call to them
          5) DO NOT forget to place that tape over the box, you want
             to minimize your chance of getting caught as much as possible
          6) DO NOT forget that we are not responsible if you get caught

                        DIVERTORS & WHAT TO DO WITH THEM
                        --------------------------------
          Yes,  at  last,  an  in  depth  guide to divertors, or at least a 
     pretty  good  guide  on  divertors. In this article, I will attempt to 
     cover  he  major  aspects  of  divertors,  from  their  advantages  to 
     disadvantages; not to mention to cover their discovery and use.
     
          Well,   now   that  you  have  come  this  far,  you  have  tried 
     everything,  codes and extenders, fortress phreaking, and hacking with 
     your  favorite  program  (I  hope  it's  Code Thief, my fav). But, the 
     pheds  are  catching  up  on us phone phreaks; hear about that guy who 
     got  a  $1000+  phone bill at the end of the month for all the illegal 
     fone  calls  he  placed  through  the  950 dial-ups? How about all the 
     busts  going  down  by phreaks who were hacking out codes? Yeah, it is 
     getting  rough  and  tough  out  there, and I kinda propose a possible 
     solution to all of that through the use of divertors.
     
          What  is  a divertor? A divertor is a type of call forwarding but 
     it  is independent from the phone company, it is a mechanical piece of 
     equipment  which  serves  as a forwarding device. For example, in many 
     24hr  services like plumbing and repair, they may have to foreword all 
     calls  after a certain time of day (people don't live in their offices 
     you  know).  Anyway,  lets  say  it's  12am  and  you want to call the 
     plumber  cuz  your  drains  are  all  blocked up. You look in the fone 
     book,  find  a  24hr  plumber  and  call  him/her.  Then,  if  it is a 
     divertor,  you  will  hear a normal ring or two, and then a click, and 
     then  another  ring  (sometimes  this other ring sounds different from 
     the  first).  What  the divertor is doing is it is picking up one side 
     of  the  fone  (your side) and dialing another fone # at the same time 
     so  that  your call is "forwarded" through the divertor. Get it? This, 
     in  itself  is no big deal, but, when it comes to using them, they are 
     great.
     
          Ok,  now that you know what a divertor is, it is time to find and 
     use  them.  Look in your telephone yellow pages and write down a bunch 
     of  fone  numbers  which could be divertors, look under 24hr plumbers, 
     repairmen,  doctors, and dentists. Note that most doctors and dentists 
     often  have  networks  set  up so one answering service always answers 
     their  calls  and  forewords  them to the actual office, so you cannot 
     phreak  off  of  these networks (I think); you can tell if a doctor or 
     dentist  has a network if you find three or more doctors/dentists with 
     the  same  fone  #  and  it  is  24hrs  a day. Anyway, find a few fone 
     numbers  that  might  be divertors. Then, at night (probably after 8pm 
     or  whenever  regular business hours are over), give the number a call 
     and  listen for clicks or anything. Then, when the other side answers, 
     get  the  other  side  to hang up by asking some stupid question about 
     their  business  (how  much  would  it  cost to un-clog 2 drains in my 
     house?)  or  ask  for  someone  that you know is not there and say you 
     have  the  wrong  number;  however, do not hang up on them, and do not 
     annoy  them  (they  are  smarter than you think!) but wait for them to 
     hang  up.  Then, when they hang up, wait for the dial tone (could take 
     a  few seconds) and when you get a dial tone, if it is a divertor, you 
     will  have  the  dial  tone  of the divertor! But, to make sure it is, 
     dial  your  local  ANI  number  to  find  out; if it repeats your fone 
     number,  it  is  not a divertor, if it repeats another fone number, it 
     is a divertor!
     
          Now,  you  have  found  a  divertor,  how would you use it? Well, 
     first  give the divertor a call and wait for the other side to pick it 
     up.  Say  something  stupid or say nothing at all and wait for them to 
     hang  up. Now, wait for the divertor's dial tone. Now, dial any number 
     you  want; if you are using it to phreak data calls off and your modem 
     is  the  kind that clears the line before it dials (touch tone only!), 
     then  just  get  a  fone in your house and take it off the switch-hook 
     while  your  modem  is  dialing, then hang the fone up when your modem 
     finishes dialing. You are now phreaking off of a divertor... hehe
     
     Advantages Of Divertors
          There  are  numerous  advantages to divertors. First, they aren't 
     used  as  widely as codes and extenders, so they are much safer. Also, 
     you  won't  have  to  worry about getting traced or anything like that 
     cuz  if  you  happen  to  bitch  at  someone in the White House from a 
     divertor,  they  will  trace  the divertor's number, not yours! So, at 
     the  end  of  the  month or whatever, the owner of the divertor has to 
     explain  the  extra  LD  charges  on  his/her fone bill as well as any 
     charges  to  him/her  on  phucking  with the white house or somewhere. 
     Also,  most  divertors local to you will have cleaner connections than 
     most  950  or port dialups. Also, you can dial anywhere direct, if you 
     want  to  call  Alliance, just dial it direct; if it won't go through, 
     dial  10288  first and then Alliance, your call will be routed through 
     AT&T.  Also, you can do anything you want, since all traces will be to 
     the   divertor;  box  off  the  divertor,  phreak  off  the  divertor, 
     experiment with the divertor, etc...
     
     Disadvantages of Divertors
          Yes,  this  was  too good to be true, wrong. There are only a few 
     disadvantages  to  these  babies.  The  most  common  problem  is  the 
     security  divertor  which  may  hang  up  on you after a set period of 
     time,  usually  5-10  minutes. Also, there is the divertor that clicks 
     every  minute or so, enuff to kill a computer connection, but annoying 
     with  voice phreak calls. One danger of divertors is if you or someone 
     else  overuses them. Never use divertors for more than 2 months, maybe 
     1  month.  If  the  pheds or telco suspect someone using a divertor to 
     phreak   calls,   then   they   can   place   a  CLID  (Customer  Line 
     IDentification)  on  the  line  and it is just as bad as an ANI from a 
     dialup.
     
          There  is  one  other  type  of  divertors  that can be used with 
     payphones.  This  divertor only works with ESS. All you hafta do is go 
     up  to  a phortress, dial "0" and ask for the AT&T Credit Operator. If 
     you  normal  Credit  Operator  says  that  they  can  take  all refund 
     information,  insist on the AT&T Credit Operator. Then you should hear 
     a  real  lame  recording  on you name, address, etc and how much money 
     you  lost. Don't say anything and wait for the recording to hang up on 
     you.  Now,  you  should  get  a  dial  tone;  to  dial  off of it, hit 
     9+1+NPA+Nxx-xxxx.  Also,  dial  ANI  to make sure you have a divertor; 
     dial  9+ANI  if  ANI  is  3 digits in your area and 9+1+ANI if it is a 
     seven  digit  number. If it says the payfone's fone number, it isn't a 
     divertor  in  your  area;  if  it  says a different number, write that 
     number  down (for phucking up the telco, explained later) and you have 
     a  divertor!  Now  you  can  dial off if it and shit like that. If you 
     dial  that  number  I  told  you  to write down, you will connect with 
     other  people  trying to connect with the credit operator! You can act 
     like the credit operator and you know what happens next!
     
          That  is  about it on divertors, use, abuze, and share the wealth 
     if  you  find  one! Remember not to use them too much, since the owner 
     of  the  divertor  will  get  suspicious quickly if 10 people in a row 
     call  and say they got the wrong number! Also, never use them for long 
     periods  of  time,  or they will stick a CLID on the line and you know 
     what  happens  then.  Another thing, don't forget to try the ANI first 
     on  a  divertor  to  make  sure  it is one, otherwise you might have a 
     large  fone  bill  at  the end of the month if it isn't! Have phun and 
     hasta!

          CODEC  - The combination of a coder and decoder, as used in time-
     division  switching  systems  to  code the incoming message and decode 
     the  message  being returned to the caller. It is a contraction of the 
     words, coder and decoder.
     
          common  control  - An exchange control method in which the dialed 
     signals  are  received  and  registered  separately from the switching 
     elements  before they are used to control these switches. Also defined 
     as  a  control method, which identifies the input and output terminals 
     of  the  switching  network  and  then  causes a connecting path to be 
     established  between  them.  Such  systems are also designed as marker 
     systems.
     
          concentration  stage  -  A  switching  stage in which a number of 
     input  lines  are  connected  to  a  smaller number of output lines or 
     trunks,  as in the connection of a large number of subscriber lines to 
     a smaller number of trunks based on the grade of service desired.
     
          connecting  row  - All those crosspoints directly accessible from 
     an  inlet. only one connection can be established via a connecting row 
     at any instant.
     
          coupler  -  A  device  used  to  prevent electrical flashback and 
     maintain  normal electrical flow on a telephone line. Used as a buffer 
     between COAME and telephone company equipment.
     
          crosspoint  -  A  set  of  contacts  that  operates  together and 
     extends  the  speech  and signal wires of the desired connection. Each 
     connection  in  a  space-division  switching network is established by 
     closing one or more crosspoints.
     
          crosstalk  -  An unwanted transfer of signals from one circuit to 
     another as may occur between switching elements or circuit wiring.
     
          day-to-busy  hour  ratio  -  The  ratio  of  the 24hr day traffic 
     volume  to  the  busy  hour  traffic  volume.  In  some  countries the 
     reciprocal of this ratio is used.
     
          delay  system - A switching system in which a call attempt, which 
     occurs  when  all  accessible  paths  for  the required connection are 
     busy, is permitted to wait until a path becomes available.
     
          dial  pulse  -  The  signaling  pulse  which  is  formed  by  the 
     interruption  of  the  current  in the DC loop of a calling telephone. 
     Such  interruptions  are  produced  by  the breaking of the dial pulse 
     contacts of the calling telephone subset during the dialing process.
     
          DID - Direct Inward Dialing.
     
          DOD - Direct Outward Dialing.
     
          DUV  - Data Under Voice - Electromechanical Switching System - An 
     exchange  system  in  which  both  the  speech  paths  and the control 
     equipment   is   composed   of  electronic  circuits  and  components, 
     generally of a solid-state type.
     
          EMD  Switch - The speech-path switching element used in a Siemens 
     rotary  switching  system. EMD is an abbreviation of Edelmetall-Motor-
     Drehwahler, which translates in English to Noble-Metal Motor Switch.
     
          Entraide  -  A  switching  system  in  which outlets from a given 
     connecting  stage  are  connected  to  inlets  of the same or previous 
     stage.  In  such  systems  calls  may traverse a stage more than once. 
     Usually  these  reentering links are used as last choice paths and the 
     resulting  network  is  heterogeneous.  Such an arrangement is used in 
     ITT's Pentaconta Crossbar system.
     
          Erlang  -  The  unit  of  traffic intensity, which is measured in 
     call-seconds  per  second or call-minutes per minute. Also, one erlang 
     equals  3600  call-seconds per hour. It is named after A.K.Erlang, the 
     Danish engineer and mathematician who first adopted it.
     
          FX  -  Foreign Exchange calls - The term applied to calls made to 
     a  central  office  other than the one located in the calling customer 
     area.
     
          GTN    -   Global   Telecommunications   Network   -   Citibank's

     offices.  The  KK6  can can handle 5 lines, the 6th button is used for 
     hold.
     
          link  -  trunk  -  The  connection  between  the terminals of one 
     switch  and  the terminals on a switch of the next stage corresponding 
     to a single transmission path.
     
          link  system  -  A  system  in  which: (1) there are at least two 
     connecting  stages;  (2)  a connection is made over one or more links; 
     (3)  the links are chosen in a single logical operation; and (4) links 
     are seized only when they can be used in making a connection.
     
          long  distance  - Technically, any call that terminates more than 
     seventeen miles from the source.
     
          Long Lines - A division of AT&T which is responsible for the day-
     to-day  operation  of the long distance network. While the local Telco 
     handles all maintenance, Long Lines directs overall supervision.
     
          lunch  box  -  A  simple  transmitter  which  could be aired over 
     common  AM  airwaves.  Another  component  of  this  box  was also the 
     receiver,  which  could  be  made  out  of similar parts. This box was 
     designed and developed by Dr. D-Code.
     
          Matrix  -  A  simple switching network in which a specified inlet 
     (matrix  row)  has  access to a specified outlet (matrix column) via a 
     crosspoint  placed  at  the  intersection  of  the  row  and column in 
     question.  A  complete matrix is one in which each inlet has access to 
     each  outlet,  while  an  incomplete matrix is one in which each inlet 
     may have access to only some of the outlets.
     
          mauve  box  - A strange box which, with the use of magnets, dirt, 
     and  batteries,  creates  a magnetic field with "draws" in the nearest 
     fone  conversation. I think this one is great, but dirty! This one was 
     developed by Captain Generic and The Genetic Mishap.
     
          message  switching  - A method of receiving and storing a message 
     for  more  appropriate  time of retransmission. With such a method, no

          olive  box  -  This box merely serves as a phone ringer. This one 
     was presented by Arnold.
     
          packet switching - Basically the same as message switching.
     
          PBAX  -  Private  Automatic Branch eXchange - A private automatic 
     telephone  exchange  which  provides for the connection of calls going 
     to   and   coming  from  the  public  telephone  network  as  well  as 
     intraexchange calls between the served extensions.
     
          PBX  - Private Branch eXchange - Commonly known as a switchboard. 
     Mini-central  office  equipment  for  business customers with from 10-
     2000 telephones.
     
          pearl  box - A great box which generates any tones from 1-9999Hz. 
     This  can  be  substituted  for  many  other  boxes,  and it great for 
     experimenting. This one was developed by Dr. D-Code.
     
          pink  box  -  This  is  a relatively simple box which serves as a 
     telefone  hold  button/hold with music on-line. This one was presented 
     by The Crack Crew.
     
          purple  box  -  (Different  from Purple Box in TPH#1) This box is 
     another  type  of  telefone  hold  button. No biggie. Presented by The 
     Flash.
     
          rock  box - This box allows good quality audio signals to be sent 
     directly  through  the  fone line. A interesting concept! This one was 
     developed by Video Vindicator.
     
          RPL - Restricted Private Line.
     
          terminal  block - A block of plastic or other insulating material 
     which  has  a  grouping of paired terminals (ring/tip pairs) which are 
     the  origin  of  the  telephone  source for most homes and businesses. 
     These  terminal blocks may be found in COD pedestals (aka green bases) 
     in groups from 1+ depending on the area it is installed in.
     
          Trans-Union  - Another credit service which is like CBI, TRW, and 
     Chilton, but offers more competitive rates.
     
          scarlet  box  -  This  box  will create a very bad connection and 
     lots  of  line  noise.  It  must  be connected to a victim's fone line 
     (output  devices  can  be  hooked up too). A good one developed by The 
     Pimp.
     
          SCC  -  Specialized  Common  Carriers  - Companies like MCI, ITT, 
     Travelnet, Metrofone, Sprint, etc. Also see OCC.
     
          snow  box  -  A  non-phreak related box which is a mini-TV pirate 
     station.  It  allows  the  takeover  of  small areas of TV (non-cable) 
     reception  with  normal HAM radio equipment. This one was developed by 
     the Outlaw Telecommandos.
     
          tan  box  - This box allows you to make fone recordings only when 
     the  fone is picked up. This can be connected at the victim's house or 
     in  an  output  device.  It was developed by the Samuri Cat and Tarkin 
     Darklighter.
     
          TASI  -  Time  Assignment Speech Interpolation - Allows more than 
     one  person  to  use  a trunk at one time by putting them on while the 
     other  person  isn't  talking.  This  can  kill a modem communication; 
     however, you can get an independent trunk with the locking frequency.
     
          TASI  Locking  Frequency  -  Frequency which allows the caller to 
     use  an  independent  trunk (ie, he/she will not have to share it with 
     some  other  geek).  The  frequency  is  1850Hz which should be played 
     before the transmission.
     
          tron  box  -  A non-phone related box which negates the power use 
     in  a  household,  thus  saving  money!  A  very ingenious box! It was 
     developed by Cap'n Crunch.

480-0003     I scanned these carriers today, I don't know how high each
480-0037     carrier's baud rate can max at.
480-0038
480-0118     I think the 0003, 0037, 0038, are the fone company's test #'s,
480-0197     but I am not sure... I haven't tried any of the rest yet, so
480-0243     check them out and tell me what they are...
480-0387
480-0457     Otherwise, happy scanning....

And there is something weird about 480-0243, I called it a 7,E,1, and then
connected at 1200 bps, then I pushed return a few times, and it sent a few
bells/beeps. Then it just sat there....

My results scanning the 679 exchange, the 99xx suffix: 679-9900 to 679-9999

The following consists of two digit numbers, xx counterpart of the 99xx suffix

01  ---+           The remaining 99xx counterparts of the suffix that are
03     ]           not listed ALL went to that lame recording that says:

15     ]                  user time. I have to sit by the computer and listen
16     ]                  to the modem dial, and re-dial. The reason being
17     ]                  that most modems won't pick up these "goodies".
18 ----+
             [ This one is WEIRD. When it rings once, a recording picks the
44 ----------[ fone up and says, "The number you have reached, 321-3342 has

             [ I was scanning the 679 exchange! WEIRD! Check it out!

Well, again, it seems as if I didn't find anything exciting, such as loops,
ANI and all of those other things I have been looking for. Oh well, I won't
give up and I will attack the Mira Mesa exchanges next!!! ATTACK!

Well, it's me again, scanning as usual... This time, I was scanning the 695
exchange and the 99xx prefix range. I didn't find anything too interesting,
but the numbers below are some "carriers" that my modem found in the range
but I know they aren't computers, I think the telco uses them for test
or other purposes.

695-9933 695-9934 695-9935 695-9936 695-9938 695-9944 695-9945 695-9946

695-9994 695-9995 695-9996

These are a few others that were busy during my scan:
695-9920 695-9923 695-9973 695-9997

till later....

This one is weird, it is a computer, but it only gives a ":" prompt at logon,
the number is 578-9975. Call it a 7,E,1.

I was informed that 578-9933 is a computer of some sort.

Unknown lines, 3 digit (DTMF) code:
578-9950 578-9951 578-9952 578-9953 578-9954 578-9955

(lady answers if you enter code, 1 second dial tone before)

Another note: 578-9962, if you press "9" (DTMF) at connection, you will get
a beeping dial tone.

Okay! Yeah, as usual, here's my latest and greatest scan results. I have not
tested any of them yet, as usual, and as usual, you the experimenting fone
modemer will hopefully test them for all of us. Anyway, I continued my last
carrier scan from 566-0870 all the way to 566-1370. That means, if you can't
subtract, that I scanned 500 numbers today. The carriers are listed below,
they might be BBS's, computers, test numbers, or something else, but in
any case, please test them out and POST all results.... thanx

The following have a carrier, but send garbage at 7,E,1 and 8,N,1. Perhaps
baud rates at 110/600 would work, or some other bps.
=> 566-0954 566-1299 566-1215

This is a strange one, it doesn't ring, but answers with a carrier.

                                 PHEDS & PHREAKS
                                 ---------------
          Phreak  phriends  alike  are  growing less and less daring as the 
     horrific  system  of  ESS  and  Ma  Bell's  Gestapo loom warily in our 
     shadows.
     
          To  this  date,  I am aware that Ma Bell is getting more and more 
     tuned  in  to  what  phreaks  and hackers are doing to their system as 
     phreaking  used  to  get easier and easier. Well, things are different 
     now,  and  it's Ma Bell's turn to taking to toll on phreak and hackers 
     alike.  Security  in  the  Bell  system get tighter and tighter by the 
     day,  and each little company which used to be considered as "safe" is 
     now  rigged  with  the  best  ANI and alert the telco of every illegal 
     move processed by the phreak.
     
          Isn't it a shame, I have heard of so many recent busts and break-
     ups  of elite phreak/hack oriented groups which were caught in the act 
     of  phreaking or hacking the telco systems/subsidiaries. Even Phortune 
     500's  own  nodes, 1-3 were brought down by the mighty sword of old Ma 
     Bell,   who   seems  to  cast  a  shadow  on  the  activities  of  the 
     telecommunications  community  today.  Now is a time of change, a time 
     where  phreaks  find  less and less alternatives and experiments which 
     could avoid the prying eyes of the Gestapo or our phriends, the Phbi.
     
          But,  why look so down? Hey, I know of a few reports where people 
     have  been  billed  $1000+ fone bills for phreaking off of the 950 and 
     800  access  ports? So what? Why not stop using them then? Ok.... then 
     we  do  stop.  And then we hear of 950-0266's announcement through the 
     Wall  Street  Journal  that they will be cracking down on phreakers as 
     time progresses. Now is a time of change.
     
          Wait,  what  is  it  a  time  of change for? Is it a time to stop 
     phreaking  and  start  paying  for  all those long distance fone calls 
     everybody  puts  through?  Or  is  it a time to look for new and fresh 
     ways  to  make  those  free  calls and gather that information that is 
     halfway  across our grand nation? Of course it's a time of change, but 
     not for the worse, but the better.
     
          Now  is  a time to change the phreak practice for codes to other, 
     perhaps   simpler   methods   of   phreaking.   Now   is  a  time  for 
     experimentation,  a  time  of  curiosity,  a  time of change! And when 
     someone  asks  if  someone  is ending his/her phone phreak career, the 
     answer  is  "no"  because  they  will  be looking, searching, for new, 
     brand  new  ways  to free the fone phreak from Ma Bell's uncomfortable 
     grasps!

                       CONCLUSION & CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENTS
                       ----------------------------------
          Well,  it's  time to say goodbye to a wealth of readers out there 
     (sniff).  Oh  well...  I  hope you enjoyed this issue of TPH, and look 
     foreward  to  the  next,  great issue of TPH and maybe I'll cover your 
     favorite subject there or something.
     
          Also,  I  hope you read phile 2.6, because it deals with a lot of 
     technical  stuff which might overcome the phreak kingdom today, and it 
     is  a  time  of  change  where  the  phreak kingdom must change or get 
     caught. Know what I mean?
     
          Anyway,  good luck and god bless. Don't get caught, and feel free 
     to  give  me some mail or messages on the many BBS's I call. Also, any 
     articles  and  submissions  to  me  may be placed in the next issue of 
     TPH, so send me something that's interesting!
     
          Until we meet again.................
