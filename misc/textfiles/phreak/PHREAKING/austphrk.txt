This  tutorial  will  be  focusing on  the  'phone  side  of
hacking.  I will include numbers,  passwords, and other bits
of  interesting info that I have picked up during my  career
as one of the >ELITE< hackers here in Australia. I will also
include information on the American 'Telenet' system, though
I  regret  I have no password (yet) for the Midas  data-link
system. Well, now, onto the juicy stuff.. here goes..
>>>>>>>>>>>>> Dial Locks <<<<<<<<<<<<<
Have  you  ever been into an office,  and  found  that  some
barstard  has  put  a dial lock so that the  dial  can't  be
turned? Well, you can use that phone, it's just a bit harder
than normal.  What you have to do, is pick up the phone, and
press  the  receiver  button >RAPIDLY< the number  of  times
needed for that digit.  For example,  to dial 762-1582,  you
would  press  the receiver button 7  times,  pause,  then  6
times,  pause,  then  2 times,  etc.  Make sure you do  this
quickly and evenly.  Practice on your own number, and you'll
get an engaged tone when you succeed. Good luck!

Have  you ever wondered about those 11 numbers?  Like  11612
for Bible Readings, etc. Ever noticed that those numbers are
not sequential?  Ever wondered what lies in between? Well, I
wondered about that once too,  so here is a list I have made
of all the 11 and 01 numbers.. Here goes..

>>>>>>>>>>> An explanation <<<<<<<<<<<
Now  to  explain some of my  (cryptic?)  notes.  Any  number
marked 'operator' answers with 'Telecom, what number are you
calling?'.  If there are words in quotes,  then that is what
she said instead.  'not connected' is the usual message, but
if it has a asterisk (*) after it,  then it was a male voice
(they are normally female voices).
Now, onto some of the more exciting of these numbers. As you
can  see,  Telecom actually does not hide much,  but some of
what  is hidden is quite interesting.  For example there  is
0109 which gives a tone,  then goes dead.  When you tap  the
receiver button, or dial a number, it repeats the tone. Very
weird  indeed!  Now,  how about the five million 'Eyewitness
news  poll'  lines.  I always thought they had only  two  or
three!  But more interesting is the 'Green phone tone  info'
number  (11570).  It goes though the different tones that  a
'Green  phone'  (the type you put money into)  makes..  very
interesting..  you  could probably use this info to build  a
'fuzz box'.  (a box which simulates the dropping of a  coin,
by sending the right frequency out a speaker,  which is held
next  to  the mouthpiece of a 'Green phone'..  the  exchange
thinks  you are putting money in..  hehe!) There are  a  few
extra  stock exchange numbers (11501,  11502 and 11616)  but
they don't really excite me.
Now,  for you astronomy fans, how about the 'Hailey's comet'
line on 11613.  Gives scientific info, and other such stuff.
How come Telecom never told us about that one? eh?
>>>>>>>>>>>> #8 exchanges <<<<<<<<<<<<
Right,  you may be asking, what about those numbers I marked
above  with  '<<<<<  see below'?  Well,  if you  dial  those
numbers,  all you get is nothing,  but it is my belief  that
they could (possibly) be loops!  What I will have to do,  is
get  my  friends  each  to dial one,  then  see  if  anybody
connects. If not, then these are just dud numbers.
Note  that some of these numbers are for  recorded  messages
that are only activated during certain times..
Almost  forgot  two  other things.  The #8 numbers  and  the
ringback numbers.  #8 is LOTS of fun.  When you dial it  up,
all  you  get  a series of long beeps,  but if  you  have  a
multimeter, or (like I had) an auto-answer unit connected to
the line, you will notice that after each beep, the polarity
of the line changes over. Now, at Telecom, when the polarity
changes,  you  are  charged  for one metered  call  (ie:  16
cents).  If you ring this number up, it costs you about $5 a
minute!  hehe!  One  Telecom technician made the mistake  of
leaving  it on once,  over lunch (he was testing  somebodies
line)  and  this persons bill  went  up  $300!  hahaha!  The
numbers  listed as #8 are most likely these sort of  numbers
(I  didn't  hang  about long to find out),  but I  have  two
numbers which are definate #8 numbers. They are:
            8008        For Balwyn area
            6308        Should work for all Melbourne
>>>>>>>>>> Ringback numbers <<<<<<<<<<
Right,  then there are ringback numbers.  These are  numbers
which  you dial,  and then hang up,  and they ring you back.
Most of the ringback numbers listed will not work.  Some are
only for certain areas,  others are not properly  connected.
The numbers I have which do work, are:
            8000        For Balwyn area
            859899      For North Balwyn
            199         For Doncaster/Templestowe area
            2200        For ?? area
Note  that  199 is the most common.  If you live in an  area
other than the above listed,  then try that one, or 2200 (if
you are desperate.. don't know what areas for that one)
Another ringback number I have is a bit different.  When  it
rings you back, rather then getting "ring-ring, pause, ring-
ring",  etc,  it just keeps ringing "riiiiiiiinnnnnggg".  It
never stops until you answer!! hehe!!
            8007        For Balwyn area
Note  that  most  ringback numbers give a low  purring  type
noise when you dial them,  wait a second or two,  then  hang
up.  When  you  answer the phone (after it rings) you get  a
tone until you hang up.  On 8007,  however,  after  dialling
there  is nothing,  and when you answer the phone (after  it
rings) there is also nothing.
>>>>>>>>> Charge call meters <<<<<<<<<
Charge call meters are used to detect whether or not you are
being charged for a call. Ever been told about a number by a
friend,  'Oh yes,  it's free, call it up all the time..' and
never known whether it WAS free or not? Well, construct your
own 'Charge call meter' and find out..
**NOTE**  In  the Box Hill area,  where the  new  touch-tone
lines  have  been installed,  some other method is  used  to
detect whether a call has been charged for or not,  but this
should work in most areas anyway.
All  you  need is an old meter of some kind (doesn't  really
matter  where  from)  and you connect  one  wire  from  each
terminal  of the meter to each of the two phone line  wires.
If you connect it up,  and the meter moves up full, then you
have  the  polarity wrong,  switch the wires around and  try
again..  If the phone does not work correctly with the meter
connected, then you have a meter which has too much drain on
the lines, try again with another meter.
When you have it all going,  then dial away.  When the meter
hits  the right hand side of the dial,  then you  have  been
charged.  To test it out,  dial 6308 and watch the meter. It
should  look like a windshield wiper.  **WARNING** Don't  do
this for too long! It is expensive! (about $5 per minute!)
