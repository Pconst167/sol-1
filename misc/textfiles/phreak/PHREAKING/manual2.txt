SHE WILL NEVER QUESTION A CALL AS LONG AS THE CALL IS WITHIN HER SERVICE AREA.
SHE CAN ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER OPERATORS OR BY A BLUE BOX.  FROM A BB, YOU
WOULD DIAL KP+NPA+121+ST FOR THE INWARD OPERATOR THAT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT ANY
CALLS WITHIN THAT NPA AREA ONLY. (BLUE BOXING WILL BE DISCUSSED IN A FUTURE
PART OF BASIC TELCOM)

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OPERATOR:
____________________________________________________________

    THIS IS THE OPERATOR THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WHEN YOU DIAL:  411 OR
NPA-555-1212.  SHE DOES NOT READILY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  SHE DOES
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO UNLISTED #'S, BUT SHE DOES KNOW IF AN UNLISTED # EXISTS FOR
A CERTAIN LISTING.

    THERE IS ALSO A DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR DEAF PEOPLE WHO USE
TELETYPEWRITERS IF YOU MODEM CAN TRANSFER BAUDOT (THE APPLE CAT CAN), THEN YOU
CAN CALL HER UP AND HAVE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH HER.  THE #
IS:800/855-1155. SHE USES THE STANDARD TELEX ABBREVIATIONS SUCH AS GA FOR GO
AHEAD. THEY TEND TO BE NICER & WILL TALK LONGER THAN YOUR REGULAR OPERATORS.
ALSO, THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE INTO BEING TALKED OUT OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE
PROCESS OF "SOCIAL ENGINEERING" AS CHESHIRE CATALYST WOULD PUT IT.

OTHER OPERATORS HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR OWN DA BY DIALING KP+NPA+131+ST (MF).

    THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THIS TUTORIAL, BUT MANY TELCO'S ARE
NOW CHARGING FOR CALLS TO DIR. ASST. YOU CAN BEAT THIS BY:

(1) COUNT HOW MANY CALLS YOU MAKE TO DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE IN A BILLING PERIOD.
GO TO A FORTRESS FONE & DIAL DA.  WHEN THE OPERATOR COMES ON, GIVE HER A NAME
THAT YOU KNOW HAS AN UNLISTED # OR ASK FOR A TOWN THAT ISN'T IN THE NPA.  SHE
WILL THEN ASK FOR YOUR # SO SHE CAN CREDIT THE CALL TO YOU. GIVE HER YOUR HOME
#, SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE MAKING A FREE CALL FROM THE FORTRESS. JUST
MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T CREDIT YOURSELF FOR MORE CALLS THAN YOU ACTUALLY MADE
OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS!

(2) IF YOU HAVE A BAUDOT TERMINAL, USE THE 800 #, IT'S FREE & THERE IS ONE #
FOR ALL REQUESTS.

C/NA OPERATORS:
____________________________________________________________

    C/NA OPERATORS ARE OPERATORS THAT DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT DIRECTORY
ASSISTANCE OPERATORS ARE FOR.  SEE PART II, FOR MORE INFO ON C/NA & #'S.  IN MY
EXPERIENCES, THESE OPERATORS KNOW MORE THAN THE DA OP'S DO & THEY ARE MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO "SOCIAL ENGINEERING."  IT IS POSSIBLE TO BULLSHIT A C/NA
OPERATOR FOR THE NON-PUB DA # (IE, YOU GIVE THEM THE NAME & THEY GIVE YOU THE
UNLISTED #).  THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ASSUME YOUR ARE A PHELLOW
COMPANY EMPLOYEE.

INTERCEPT OPERATOR:
____________________________________________________________

    THE INTERCEPT OPERATOR IS THE ONE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WHEN THERE ARE
NOT ENOUGH RECORDINGS AVAILABLE TO TELL YOU THAT THE # HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED OR
CHANGED.  SHE USUALLY SAYS, "WHAT # YOU CALLIN' ? " WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT.
THIS IS THE LOWEST OPERATOR LIFEFORM.  EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
ARE CALLING FROM, IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME TO TRY TO VERBALLY ABUSE THEM
SINCE THEY USUALLY UNDERSTAND VERY LITTLE ENGLISH.

                                    Page 107




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


OTHER OPERATORS:
____________________________________________________________

AND THEN THERE ARE THE:
MOBILE
SHIP-TO-SHORE
CONFERENCE
MARINE VERIFY, "LEAVE WORD & CALL BACK,"
ROUT & RATE (KP+NPA+141+ST) & OTHER SPECIAL OPERATORS WHO HAVE ONE PURPOSE OR
ANOTHER IN THE NETWORK.

    PROBLEMS WITH AN OPERATOR?  ASK TO SPEAK TO THEIR SUPERVISOR... WHICH IS
THE EQUIVALENT OF THE MADAME IN A WHOREHOUSE (IF YOU WILL EXCUSE THE ANALOGY).

    BY THE WAY, SOME CO'S THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DIAL A 1 OR 0 AS THE 4TH
DIGIT, WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO CALL SPECIAL OPERATORS WITHOUT A BLUE BOX.  THIS
IS VERY RARE THOUGH!  FOR EXAMPLE, 212-121-1111 WILL GET YOU A NY INWARD
OPERATOR.

OFFICE HIERARCHY
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

    EVERY SWITCHING OFFICE OFFICE IN NORTH AMERICA (THE NPA SYSTEM), IS
ASSIGNED AN OFFICE NAME & CLASS.  THERE ARE FIVE CLASSES OF OFFICES NUMBERED 1
THROUGH 5.  YOUR CO IS MOST LIKELY A CLASS 5 OR END OFFICE. ALL LONG-DISTANCE
(TOLL) CALLS ARE SWITCHED BY A TOLL OFFICE WHICH CAN BE A CLASS 4, 3, 2, OR 1
OFFICE.  THERE IS ALSO A 4X OFFICE CALLED AN INTERMEDIATE POINT.  THE 4X OFFICE
IS A DIGITAL ONE THAT CAN HAVE AN UNATTENDED EXCHANGE ATTACHED TO IT (KNOWN AS
A REMOTE SWITCHING UNIT-RSU).

    THE FOLLOWING CHART WILL LIST THE OFFICE #, NAME, & HOW MANY OF THOSE
OFFICES EXISTED IN NORTH AMERICA IN 1981.

CLASS       NAME       ABB  # EXISTING
----- ---------------- --- ------------
1   REGIONAL CENTER  RC         12
2   SECTIONAL CENTER SC         67
3   PRIMARY CENTER   PC        230
4   TOLL CENTER      TC       1,30
4P  TOLL POINT       TP          ?
4X  INTERMEDIATE PT  IP          ?
5   END OFFICE       EO     19,000
R   RSU              RSU         ?

    WHEN CONNECTING A CALL FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER, THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT
USUALLY TRIES TO FIND THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF THE
CALLER & THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF THE CALLED PARTY. IF NO INTER-OFFICE TRUNKS
EXIST BETWEEN THE 2 PARTIES, IT WILL THEN MOVE UPTO THE NEXT HIGHEST OFFICE FOR
SERVICING (CLASS 4).  IF THE CLASS 4 OFFICE CANNOT HANDLE THE CALL BY SENDING
IT TO ANOTHER CLASS 4 OR 5 OFFICE, IT WILL BE SENT TO THE NEXT OFFICE IN THE
HIERARCHY (3). THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT FIRST USES THE HIGH-USAGE INTEROFFICE
TRUNK GROUPS, IF THEY ARE BUSY IT THEN GOES TO THE FINAL TRUNK GROUPS ON THE
NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL. IF THE CALL CANNOT BE CONNECTED THEN, YOU WILL PROBABLY GET
A RE-ORDER (120IPM BUSY SIGNAL) SIGNAL.  AT THIS TIME, THE GUYS AT NETWORK
OPERATIONS ARE PROBABLY SHITTING IN THEIR PANTS AND TRYING TO AVOID THE DREADED
NETWORK DREADLOCK (AS SEEN ON TV!).

                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

    IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT 9 CONNECTIONS IN TANDEM IS CALLED
RING-AROUND-THE ROSY AND IT HAS NEVER OCCURRED IN TELEPHONE HISTORY.  THIS
WOULD CASE AN ENDLESS LOOP CONNECTION. [ A NEAT WAY TO REALLY SCREW-UP THE
NETWORK].

    THE 10 REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE US & THE 2 IN CANADA ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED.
THEY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE ENTIRE TELEPHONE NETWORK.  SINCE THERE ARE ONLY
12 OF THEM, THEY ARE LISTED BELOW:

SWITCHING EQUIPMENT

                                    Page 109




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

    IN THE NETWORK, THERE ARE 3 MAJOR TYPES OF SWITCHING EQUIPMENT. THEY ARE
KNOWN AS:  STEP, CROSSBAR, & ESS.


STEP-BY-STEP (SXS)
____________________________________________________________

    THE STEP-BY-STEP, A/K/A THE STROWGER SWITCH OR TWO-MOTION SWITCH, WAS
INVENTED IN 1889 BY AN UNDERTAKER NAMED ALMON STROWGER.  HE INVENTED THIS
MECHANICAL SWITCHING EQUIPMENT BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE BIASED OPERATOR WAS
ROUTING ALL REQUESTS FOR AN 'UNDERTAKER' TO HER HUSBAND'S BUSINESS. BELL
STARTED USING THIS SYSTEM IN 1918 AS OF 1978, OVER 53% OF THE BELL EXCHANGES
USED THIS METHOD OF SWITCHING.

    STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING IS CONTROLLED DIRECTLY BY THE DIAL PULSES WHICH MOVE
A SERIES OF SWITCHES (CALLED THE SWITCH TRAIN) IN ORDER. WHEN YOU FIRST PICK UP
THE FONE UNDER SXS, A LINEFINDER ACKNOWLEDGES THE REQUEST (SOONER OR LATER) BY
SENDING A DIAL TONE.  IF YOU THEN DIALED 1234, THE EQUIPMENT WOULD FIRST FIND
AN IDLE SELECTOR SWITCH.  IT WOULD THEN MOVE VERTICALLY 1 PULSE, IT WOULD THEN
MOVE HORIZONTALLY TO FIND A FREE SECOND SELECTOR, IT WOULD THEN MOVE 2 VERTICAL
PULSES, STEP HORIZONTALLY TO FIND THE NEXT SELECTOR, ETC.  THUS THE FIRST
SWITCH IN THE TRAIN TAKES NO DIGITS, THE SECOND SWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, THE THIRD
SWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, & THE LAST SWITCH IN THE TRAIN (CALLED THE CONNECTOR)
TAKES THE LAST 2 DIGITS & CONNECTS YOUR CALLS. A NORMAL (10,000 LINE) EXCHANGE
REQUIRES 4 DIGITS (0000-9999) TO CONNECT A LOCAL CALL & THUS IT TAKES 4
SWITCHES TO CONNECT EVERY CALL (LINEFINDER, 1ST & 2ND SELECTORS, & THE
CONNECTOR) .

    WHILE IT WAS THE FIRST, SXS SUCKS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

[1] THE SWITCHED OFTEN BECOME JAMMED THUS THE CALLS OFTEN BECOME BLOCKED.

[2] YOU CAN'T USE DTMF (DUAL-TONE MULTI-FREQUENCY A/K/A TOUCH-TONE) DIRECTLY.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TELCO MAY HAVE INSTALLED A CONVERSION KIT BUT THEN THE
CALLS WILL GO THROUGH JUST AS SLOW AS PULSE, ANYWAY!

[3] THEY USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY & MECHANICAL MAINTENANCE. (BAD FROM TELCO
POINT OF VIEW)

[4] EVERYTHING IS HARDWIRED.

    THEY CAN STILL HOOK UP PEN REGISTERS & OTHER SHIT ON THE LINE SO IT IS NOT
EXACTLY A PHREAK HAVEN.

YOU CAN IDENTIFY SXS OFFICES BY:

(1) LACK OF DTMF OR PULSING DIGITS AFTER DIALING DTMF.

(2) IF YOU GO NEAR THE CO, IT WILL SOUND LIKE A TYPEWRITER TESTING FACTORY.

(3) LACK OF SPEED CALLING, CALL FORWARDING, & OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICES.

(4) FORTRESS FONES THAT WANT YOUR MONEY FIRST (AS OPPOSED TO DIAL TONE FIRST
ONES).

    THE PRECEDING DON'T NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT YOU HAVE SXS BUT THEY SURELY

                                    Page 110




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

GIVE EVIDENCE THAT IT MIGHT BE.  ALSO, IF ANY OF THE ABOVE CHARACTERISTICS
EXIST, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T ESS!  ALSO, SXS HAVE PRETTY MUCH BEEN ERADICATED FROM
LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS NYC (212).

CROSSBAR:
____________________________________________________________

    THERE ARE 3 MAJOR TYPES OF CROSSBAR SYSTEMS CALLED:  NO. 1 CROSSBAR (1XB),
NO. 4 CROSSBAR (4XB), & NO. 5 CROSSBAR (5XB).  5XB HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY END
OFFICE SWITCH OF BELL SINCE THE 60'S AND THUS IT IS IN WIDE-USE.

    CROSSBAR USES A COMMON CONTROL SWITCHING METHOD.  WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING
CALL, A STORED PROGRAM DETERMINES ITS ROUTE THROUGH THE SWITCHING MATRIX.

    IN CROSSBAR, THE BASIC OPERATION PRINCIPLE IS THAT A HORIZONTAL & A
VERTICAL LINE ARE ENERGIZED IN A MATRIX KNOWN AS THE CROSSPOINT MATRIX. THE
POINT WHERE THESE 2 LINES MEET IN THE MATRIX IS THE CONNECTION.


ESS
____________________________________________________________

ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM (ESS) THE PHREAK'S NIGHTMARE COME TRUE (OR ORWELL'S
PROPHECY AS 2600 PUTS IT)

    ESS IS BELL'S MOVE TOWARDS THE AIRSTRIP ONE SOCIETY DEPICTED IN ORWELL'S
1984. WITH ESS, EVERY SINGLE DIGIT THAT YOU DIAL IS RECORDED--EVEN IF IT IS A
MISTAKE.  THEY KNOW WHO YOU CALL, WHEN YOU CALL, HOW LONG YOU TALKED FOR, &
PROBABLY WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT (IN SOME CASES).  ESS CAN (AND IS) ALSO
PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT #'S OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO 800 #'S OR
DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS CALLED THE "800 EXCEPTIONAL CALLING REPORT." ESS
COULD ALSO BE PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT LOGS OF WHO CALLS CERTAIN #'S--LIKE A
BOOKIE, A KNOWN COMMUNIST, A BBS, ETC THE THING TO REMEMBER WITH ESS IS THAT IT
IS A SERIES OF PROGRAMS WORKING TOGETHER.  THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE VERY EASILY
CHANGED TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO DO.  ONE PHREAK WHOM I KNOW HAS SOME ESS
SOURCE CODE LISTING WHICH IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX (AS WELL AS DOCUMENTED--GRACIAS
DIOS).  THIS SYSTEM MAKES THE JOB OF BELL SECURITY, THE FBI, NSA, & OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS THAT LIKE TO INVADE PRIVACY INCREDIBLY EASY.

    WITH ESS, TRACING IS DONE IN MICROSECONDS (EINE AUGENBLICK) & THE RESULTS
ARE PRINTED AT THE CONSOLE OF A BELL GESTAPO OFFICER.  ESS WILL ALSO PICK UP
ANY "FOREIGN" TONES ON THE LINE SUCH AS 2600 HZ!

    BELL PREDICTS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL BECOME TOTALLY ESS BY THE 1990'S.

    YOU CAN IDENTIFY ESS BY THE FOLLOWING WHICH ARE USUALLY ESS FUNCTIONS:

[1] DIALING 911 FOR HELP.
[2] DIAL-TONE-FIRST FORTRESSES.
[3] CUSTOM CALLING SERVICES SUCH AS:CALL FORWARDING, SPEED DIALING, & CALL
WAITING.  (ASK YOUR BUSINESS OFFICE IF YOU CAN GET THESE.)
[4] ANI (AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION) ON LD CALLS.

    PHREAKING DOES NOT COME TO A COMPLETE HALT UNDER ESS THOUGH--JUST BE VERY
CAREFUL, THOUGH!!!

    DUE TO THE FACT THAT ESS SENDS A COMPUTER GENERATED "ARTIFICIAL RING,"
WHERE THE VOICE IS NOT CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE CALLED PARTIES LINE UNTIL HE

                                    Page 111




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

PICKS UP, BLACK BOXES & INFINITY TRANSMITTERS WILL NOT WORK!

NOTE: ANOTHER INTERESTING WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT YOU ARE ON IS
TO RAID THE TRASH CAN OF YOU LOCAL CO--THIS ART WILL DISCUSSED IN A SEPARATE
ARTICLE SOON.

PREFACE:

    PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS OF THIS SERIES WERE FOCUSED ON TELEPHONY FROM A
NETWORK POINT-OF-VIEW.  PART V WILL DEAL WITH TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS FOCUSING
PRIMARILY ON THE SUBSCRIBER'S TELEPHONE. HERE-IN-AFTER SIMPLY REFERRED TO AS
"FONE."

WIRING:
____________________________________________________________

    ASSUMING A STANDARD ONE-LINE FONE, THERE ARE USUALLY 4 WIRES THAT LEAD OUT
OF THE FONE SET.  THESE ARE STANDARDLY COLORED RED, GREEN, YELLOW, & BLACK.
THE RED & GREEN SIRES ARE THE TWO THAT ARE ACTUALLY HOOKED UP TO YOUR CO.  THE
YELLOW WIRE IS SOMETIMES USED TO RING DIFFERENT FONES ON A PARTY LINE (IE, ONE
#, SEVERAL FAMILIES--FOUND PRIMARILY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY PAY LESS FOR THE
SERVICE AND THEY DON'T USE THE FONE AS MUCH); OTHERWISE, THE YELLOW IS USUALLY
JUST IGNORED. ON SOME TWO-LINE FONES, THE RED & GREEN WIRES ARE USED FOR THE
FIRST FONE # AND THE YELLOW & BLACK ARE USED FOR THE SECOND LINE. IN THIS CASE
THERE MUST BE AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL DEVICE THAT SWITCHES BETWEEN THE TWO
LINES AND PROVIDES A HOLD FUNCTION. (SUCH AS RADIO SHACK'S OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED
2 LINE & HOLD MODULE-9.

    IN TELEPHONY, THE RED & GREEN WIRES ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS TIP (T) & RING
(R).  THE TIP IS USUALLY THE MORE POSITIVE OF THE TWO WIRES.  THIS NAMING GOES
BACK TO THE OLD OPERATOR CORD BOARDS WHERE ONE OF THE WIRES WAS THE TIP OF THE
PLUG AND THE OTHER WAS THE RING (OF THE BARREL).
    A ROTARY FONE (AKA DIAL OR PULSE) WILL WORK FINE REGARDLESS WHETHER THE RED
(OR GREEN) WIRE IS CONNECTED THE TIP(+) OR RING(-).  A TOUCH-TONE (TM) FONE IS
A DIFFERENT STORY, THOUGH.  IT WILL NOT WORK EXCEPT IF THE TIP(+) IS THE GREEN
WIRE. [ALTHOUGH, SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE DTMF FONES DO HAVE A RECTIFIER
BRIDGE WHICH COMPENSATES FOR POLARITY REVERSAL.]  THIS I WHY UNDER CERTAIN
(NON-DIGITAL) SWITCHING EQUIPMENT YOU CAN REVERSE THE RED & GREEN WIRES ON A
TOUCH-TONE FONE AND RECEIVE FREE DTMF SERVICE.  EVEN THOUGH IT WON'T BREAK DIAL
TONE, REVERSING THE WIRES ON A ROTARY LINE ON A DIGITAL SWITCH WILL CAUSE THE
TONES TO BE GENERATED.

VOLTAGES, ETC.
____________________________________________________________

    WHEN YOUR TELEPHONE IS ON-HOOK (IE, HUNG UP) THERE IS APPROXIMATELY 48
VOLTS OF DC CURRENT (VDC) FLOWING THROUGH THE TIP & RING.  WHEN THE HANDSET OF
A FONE IS LIFTED A FEW SWITCHES CLOSE WHICH CAUSE A LOOP TO BE CONNECTED (KNOWN
AS THE "LOCAL LOOP") BETWEEN YOUR FONE & THE CO.  ONCE THIS HAPPENS DC CURRENT
IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THE FONE WITH LESS RESISTANCE. THIS CAUSES A RELAY TO
ENERGIZE WHICH CAUSES OTHER CO EQUIPMENT TO REALIZE THAT YOU WANT SERVICE.
EVENTUALLY, YOU SHOULD END UP WITH A DIAL TONE.  THIS ALSO CAUSES THE 48 VDC TO
DROP DOWN INTO THE VICINITY OF 13 VOLTS.  THE RESISTANCE OF THE LOOP ALSO DROPS
BELOW THE 2500 OHM LEVEL.

                                    Page 113




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


    AS OF NOW, YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING TO YOURSELF THAT THIS IS ALL NICE AND
TECHNICAL BUT WHAT THE HELL GOOD IS THE INFORMATION.  WELL, ALSO CONSIDER THAT
THIS VOLTAGE (& RESISTANCE) DROP IS HOW THE CO DETECTS THAT A FONE WAS TAKEN
OFF HOOK (PICKED UP).  IN THIS WAY, THEY KNOW WHEN TO START BILLING THE CALLING
NUMBER.  NOW WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD HAPPEN IF A DEVICE SUCH AS A RESISTOR OR
A ZENER DIODE WAS PLACED ON THE CALLED PARTIES LINE SO THAT THE VOLTAGE WOULD
DROP JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW TALKING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START BILLING?  FIRST OFF,
THE CALLING PARTY WOULD NOT BE BILLED FOR THE CALL BUT CONVERSATION COULD BE
PURSUED. SECONDLY, THE CO EQUIPMENT WOULD THINK THAT THE FONE JUST KEPT ON
RINGING. THE TELCO CALLS THIS A "NO-NO" (TOLL FRAUD TO BE MORE SPECIFIC) WHILE
PHONE PHREAKS AFFECTIONATELY CALL THIS MUTE A BLACK BOX.

    THE FOLLOWING ARE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BUILD A SIMPLE BLACK BOX. OF
COURSE, ANYTHING THAT PREVENTS THE VOLTAGE FROM DROPPING WOULD WORK.
YOU ONE OR TWO PARTS:      A SPST TOGGLE SWITCH AND A 10,000 OHM (10 K), 1/2
WATT RESISTOR.  ANY ELECTRONICS STORE SHOULD STOCK THESE PARTS.

    NOW, CUT 2 PIECES OF WIRE (ABOUT 6 INCHES LONG) AND ATTACH ONE END OF EACH
WIRE TO ONE OF THE TERMINALS ON THE SWITCH.  NOW TURN YOUR K500 (STANDARD DESK
FONE) UPSIDE DOWN AND TAKE OFF THE COVER.  LOCATE THE 2 SCREWS ON THE NETWORK
BOX LABELED >F< AND >RR<.  WRAP THE RESISTOR BETWEEN THE 2 SCREWS MAKING SURE
THAT IT DOESN'T TOUCH ANY OTHER TERMINALS!.  NOW CONNECT ONE WIRE FROM THE
SWITCH TO THE RR TERMINAL. FINALLY, ATTACH THE REMAINING WIRE TO THE GREEN WIRE
(DISCONNECT IT FROM ITS TERMINAL).  NOW BRING THE SWITCH OUT THE REAR OF THE
FONE AND REPLACE THE COVER.

    PUT THE SWITCH IN A POSITION WHERE YOU RECEIVE A DIAL TONE.  MARK THIS
POSITION NORMAL.  MARK THE OTHER SIDE FREE.

    WHEN YOUR PHRIENDS CALL (AT A PREARRANGED TIME), QUICKLY LIFT & DROP THE
RECEIVER AS FAST A POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL STOP THE RINGING (DO IT AGAIN IF IT
DOESN'T) WITH OUT STARTING THE BILLING.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO IT QUICKLY
(LESS THAN ONE SECOND THEN PUT THE SWITCH IN THE FREE POSITION AND PICK UP THE
FONE.  KEEP ALL CALL SHORT AND PREFERABLY UNDER 15 MINUTES.

NOTE:      IF ANYONE PICKS UP AN EXTENSION IN THE CALLED PARTIES HOUSE AND THAT
FONE IS NOT SET FOR FREE THEN BILLING WILL START.

NOTE:      AN OLD WAY OF SIGNALING A PHRIEND THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALL IS
MAKING A COLLECT CALL TO A NON-EXISTENT PERSON IN THE HOUSE.  SINCE YOUR FRIEND
WILL NOT ACCEPT THE CHARGES, HE WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALL AND THUS
PREPARE THE BLACK BOX    (OR VISA VERSA).

WARNING:     THE TELCO CAN DETECT BLACK BOXES IF THEY SUSPECT ONE ON YOUR LINE.
THIS IS DONE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF AC VOICE SIGNAL AT THE WRONG DC LEVEL!

NOTE:      THE BLACK BOX WILL NOT WORK UNDER ESS OR OTHER SIMILAR DIGITAL
SWITCHES SINCE ESS DOES NOT CONNECT THE VOICE CIRCUITS UNTIL THE FONE IS PICKED
UP (& BILLING STARTS).  INSTEAD, ESS USES AN "ARTIFICIAL"   COMPUTER GENERATED
RING.

RINGING:
____________________________________________________________

    TO INFORM A SUBSCRIBER OF AN INCOMING CALL, THE TELCO SENDS 90 VOLTS (RMS)
OF AC CURRENT DOWN THE LINE (AT AROUND 15 TO 60 HZ)  IN STANDARD FONES, THIS
CAUSES A METAL ARMATURE TO BE ATTRACTED ALTERNATELY BETWEEN TWO ELECTRO-MAGNETS
THUS STRIKING 2 BELLS.  OF COURSE, THE STANDARD BELL (PATENTED IN 1878 BY TOM
A. WATSON) CAN BE REPLACED BY A MORE MODERN ELECTRONIC BELL OR SIGNALING
DEVICE.

    ALSO, YOU CAN HAVE LIGHTS AND OTHER SIMILAR DEVICES IN LIEU OF (OR IN
CONJUNCTION WITH) THE BELL.  A SIMPLE NEON LIGHT (WITH ITS CORRESPONDING
RESISTOR) CAN SIMPLY BE CONNECTED BETWEEN THE RED & GREEN WIRES (USUALLY L1 &
L2 ON THE NETWORK BOX) SO THAT IT LIGHTS UP ON INCOMING CALLS.  A REGULAR 60
WATT LIGHT BULB CAN ALSO BE HOOKED UP USING A SIMPLE (120 VAC) RELAY.

WARNING:      90 & 120 VAC CAN GIVE QUITE A SHOCK.  EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION IF
YOU WISH TO FURTHER PURSUE THESE TOPICS.

    ALSO INCLUDED IN THE RINGING CIRCUIT IS A CAPACITOR TO PREVENT THE DC
CURRENT FROM INTERFERING WITH THE BELL [A CAPACITOR WILL PASS AC CURRENT WHILE
IT WILL PREVENT DC CURRENT FROM FLOWING (BY STORING IT)].
    ANOTHER REASON THAT THE TELCO HATES BLACK BOXES IS BECAUSE RINGING USES
ALOT OF COMMON-CONTROL EQUIPMENT, IN THE CO, WHICH USE ALOT OF ELECTRICITY.
THUS THE RINGING GENERATORS ARE BEING TIED UP WHILE A FREE CALL IS BEING MADE.
USUALLY CALLS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO RING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME MAY BE
CONSTRUED AS SUSPICIOUS.  SOME OFFICES MAY BE SET UP TO DROP A TROUBLE CARD FOR
LONG PERIODS OF RINGING THEN A "NO-NO" DETECTION DEVICE MAY BE PLACED ON THE
LINE.
    INCIDENTALLY, THE TERM "RING TRIP" REFERS TO THE CO PROCESS INVOLVED TO
STOP THE AC RINGING SIGNAL WHEN THE CALLING FONE GOES OFF HOOK.

NOTE:      IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU ACTUALLY DISSECT FONES TO HELP YOU BETTER
UNDERSTAND THEM. IT WILL ALSO HELP YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS HERE
IF YOU ACTUALLY PROVE THEM TO YOURSELF.  FOR EXAMPLE, ACTUALLY TAKE THE VOLTAGE
READINGS ON YOUR FONE LINE [ANY SIMPLE MULTI-TESTER (A MUST) WILL DO.]
PHREAKING IS AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS NOT A PASSIVE ONE!

DIALING:
____________________________________________________________

    ON A STANDARD FONE, THERE ARE TWO COMMON TYPES OF DIALING:  PULSE & DTMF.
OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE INSIST UPON BEING DIFFERENT AND DON'T USE THE DT THUS
LEAVING THEM WITH MF (MULTI FREQUENCY, AKA OPERATOR, BLUE BOX) TONES.  THIS IS
ANOTHER "NO-NO" AND THE TELCO SECURITY GENTLEMEN HAVE A SPECIAL KNACK FOR
DEALING WITH SUCH "PHREAKS" ON THE NETWORK.

                                    Page 115




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

    WHEN YOU DIAL ROTARY, YOU ARE ACTUALLY RAPIDLY BREAKING & RECONNECTING
(MAKING) THE LOCAL LOOP ONCE FOR EVERY DIGIT DIALED. SINCE THE PHYSICAL
CONNECTION MUST BE BROKEN, YOU CANNOT DIAL IF ANOTHER EXTENSION (OF THAT #) IS
OFF-HOOK.  NEITHER OF THE FONES WILL BE ABLE TO DIAL PULSE UNLESS THE OTHER
HANGS UP.
    ANOTHER TERM OFTEN REFERRED TO IN TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS IS THE BREAK RATIO.
IN THE US, THERE ARE 10 PULSES PER SECOND (MAX).  WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS OPENED IT
IS CALLED THE BREAK INTERVAL. WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT IS CALLED THE MAKE INTERVAL.
IN THE US, THERE IS A 60 MILLISECOND (MS) BREAK PERIOD AND A 40 MS MAKE PERIOD.
(60+40=100 MS = 1/10 MINUTE).  THIS IS REFERRED TO AS A 60% BREAK INTERVAL.
SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONIC FONES CAN SWITCH BETWEEN A 60% & A
67% BREAK INTERVAL.  THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT MANY FOREIGN NATIONS USE A
67% BREAK INTERVAL.
    HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN AN OFFICE OR A SIMILAR FACILITY AND SAW A FONE
WAITING TO BE USED FOR A FREE CALL BUT SOME ASSHOLE PUT A LOCK ON IT TO PREVENT
OUTGOING CALLS?
    WELL, DON'T FRET PHELLOW PHREAKS, YOU CAN SIMULATE PULSE DIALING BY RAPIDLY
DEPRESSING THE SWITCHOOK.  (IF YOU DEPRESS IT FOR LONGER THAN A SECOND IT WILL
BE CONSTRUED AS A DISCONNECT.)  BY RAPIDLY SWITCHOOKING YOU ARE CAUSING THE
LOCAL LOOP TO BE BROKEN & MADE SIMILAR TO ROTARY DIALING!  THUS IF YOU CAN
MANAGE TO SWITCHOOK RAPIDLY 10 TIMES YOU CAN REACH AN OPERATOR TO PLACE ANY
CALL YOU WANT! THIS TAKES ALOT OF PRACTICE, THOUGH.  YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRACTICE
ON YOUR OWN FONE DIALING A FRIEND'S # OR SOMETHING ELSE. INCIDENTALLY, THIS
METHOD WILL ALSO WORK WITH DTMF FONES SINCE ALL DTMF LINES CAN ALSO HANDLE
ROTARY.
    ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH PULSE DIALING IS THAT IT PRODUCES HIGH-VOLTAGE SPIKES
THAT MAKE LOUD NOISES IN THE EARPIECE AND CAUSE THE BELL TO "TINKLE."  IF YOU
NEVER NOTICED THIS THEN YOUR FONE HAS A SPECIAL "ANTI-TINKLE" & EARPIECE
SHORTING CIRCUIT (MOST DO).  IF YOU HAVE EVER DISSECTED A ROTARY FONE (A MUST
FOR ANY SERIOUS PHREAK) YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE 2 SETS OF CONTACT
THAT OPEN AND CLOSE DURING PULSING (ON THE BACK OF THE ROTARY DIAL UNDER THE
PLASTIC COVER).  ONE OF THESE ACTUALLY OPENS AND
CLOSES THE LOOP WHILE THE OTHER MUTES THE EARPIECE BY SHORTING IT OUT. THE
SECOND CONTACTS ALSO ACTIVATES A SPECIAL ANTI-TINKLE CIRCUIT THAT PUTS A 340
OHM RESISTOR ACROSS THE RINGING CIRCUIT WHICH PREVENTS THE HIGH VOLTAGE SPIKES
FROM INTERFERING WITH THE BELL.
    DUAL TONE MULTI FREQUENCY (DTMF) IS A MODERN DAY IMPROVEMENT ON PULSE
DIALING IN SEVERAL WAYS.  FIRST OF ALL, IT IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE USER
SINCE IT IS FASTER AND CAN BE USED FOR SIGNALING AFTER THE CALL IS COMPLETED
(IE, SCC'S, COMPUTERS, ETC.).  ALSO, IT IS MORE UPTO PAR WITH MODERN DAY
SWITCHING EQUIPMENT (SUCH AS ESS) SINCE PULSE DIALING WAS DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY
MOVE RELAYS BY THE NUMBER OF DIGITS DIALED (IN SXS OFFICES).

    EACH KEY ON A DTMF KEYPAD PRODUCES 2 FREQUENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY (ONE FROM
THE HIGH GROUP AND ANOTHER FROM THE LOW GROUP).

A PORTABLE DTMF KEYPAD IS KNOWN AS A WHITE BOX.

    THE FOURTH COLUMN (1633 HZ) IS NOT NORMALLY FOUND ON REGULAR FONES BUT IT
DOES HAVE SEVERAL SPECIAL USES.  FOR ONE, IT IS USED TO DESIGNATE THE PRIORITY
OF CALLS ON AUTOVON, THE MILITARY FONE NETWORK. THESE KEY ARE CALLED:  FLASH,
IMMEDIATE, PRIORITY, & ROUTINE (WITH VARIATIONS) INSTEAD OF ABCD.  SECONDLY,
THESE KEYS ARE USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES BY THE TELCO.  IN SOME AREA YOU CAN
FIND LOOPS AS WELL AS OTHER NEAT TESTS (SEE PART II) ON THE 555-1212 DIRECTORY
ASSISTANCE EXCHANGE. FOR THIS, YOU WOULD CALL UP AN DA IN CERTAIN AREAS [THAT
HAVE AN AUTOMATIC CALL DISTRIBUTOR (ACD)] AND HOLD DOWN THE "D" KEY WHICH
SHOULD BLOW THE OPERATOR OFF.  YOU WILL THEN HEAR A PULSING DIAL TONE WHICH
INDICATES THAT YOU ARE IN THE ACD INTERNAL TESTING MODE.  YOU CAN GET ON ONE
SIDE OF A LOOP BY DIALING A 6.  THE OTHER SIDE IS 7.  SOME PHREAKS CLAIM THAT
IF THE PERSON ON SIDE 6 HANGS UP, OCCASIONALLY THE EQUIPMENT WILL SCREW UP AD
START DIRECTING DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE CALLS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOOP.
ANOTHER ALLEGED TEST IS CALLED REMOB WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TAP INTO LINES BY
ENTERING A SPECIAL CODE FOLLOWED BY THE 7 DIGIT NUMBER YOU WANT TO MONITOR.
THEN THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MASS CONFERENCING.
    ACD'S ARE BECOME RARE THOUGH.  YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE SEVERAL
NPA-555- 1212 CALLS BEFORE YOU FIND ONE.
    YOU CAN MODIFY REGULAR FONES QUITE READILY SO THAT THEY HAVE A SWITCH TO
CHANGE BETWEEN THE 3RD AND 4TH COLUMNS. THIS IS CALLED A SILVER BOX (AKA GREY
BOX) AD PLANS CAN BE FOUND IN TAP AS WELL AS ON MANY BBS'S.

TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER:
____________________________________________________________

    WHEN YOU TALK INTO THE TRANSMITTER, THE SOUND WAVES FROM YOUR VOICE CAUSE A
DIAPHRAGM TO VIBRATE AND PRESS AGAINST THE CARBON GRANULES (OR ANOTHER SIMILAR
SUBSTANCE).  THIS CAUSES THE CARBON GRANULES TO COMPRESS AND CONTRACT THUS
CHANGING THE RESISTANCE OF THE DC CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH IT.  THEREFORE, YOUR
AC VOICE SIGNAL IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE DC CURRENT OF THE LOCAL LOOP. THE
RECEIVER WORKS IN A SIMILAR FASHION WHERE THE SIMPLE TYPES UTILIZE A MAGNET,
ARMATURE, & DIAPHRAGM.

HYBRID/INDUCTION COIL:
____________________________________________________________

    AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, THERE ARE TWO WIRES FOR THE RECEIVER AND TWO FOR
THE TRANSMITTER IN THE FONE, YET THE LOCAL LOOP CONSISTS OF 2 WIRES INSTEAD OF
4. THIS 4-WIRE TO 2-WIRE CONVERSION IS DONE INSIDE THE FONE BY A DEVICE KNOWN
AS AN INDUCTION COIL WHICH USES COUPLING TRANSFORMERS.
    THE REASON 2 SIRES ARE USED ON THE LOCAL LOOPS ARE BECAUSE IT IS ALOT
CHEAPER FOR THE TELCO.  ALTHOUGH, ALL OF THE INTER-OFFICE TRUNKS UTILIZE 4
WIRES.  THIS IS NECESSARY FOR FULL DUPLEX (IE, SIMULTANEOUS CONVERSATION ON
BOTH SIDES) AND FOR AMPLIFICATION DEVICES.  THERE ARE SIMILAR DEVICES IN THE
CO'S, KNOWN AS A HYBRID, THAT COUPLE THE 4-WIRE TRUNKS TO THE 2-WIRE LOCAL
LOOPS AND VISA-VERSA.

                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

MISCELLANEOUS:
____________________________________________________________

    IN THE TELEPHONE, THERE IS ALSO A BALANCING NETWORK CONSISTING OF A FEW
CAPACITORS & RESISTORS WHICH PROVIDE SIDETONE.  SIDETONE ALLOWS THE CALLER TO
HEAR HIS OWN VOLUME IN THE RECEIVER. HE CAN THEN ADJUST HIS VOICE ACCORDINGLY.
THIS PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM SHOUTING OR SPEAKING TOO SOFTLY WITHOUT NOTICING IT.

HOLD:
____________________________________________________________

    WHEN A TELEPHONE GOES OFF HOOK, THE RESISTANCE DROPS BELOW 2500 OHMS.  AT
THIS POINT, THE TELCO WILL SEND A DIAL TONE.  TO PUT SOMEONE ON HOLD YOU MUST
PUT A 1000 OHM RESISTOR (1 WATT) ACROSS THE TIP & RING BEFORE IT REACHES THE
SWITCHOOK.  IN THIS WAY, WHEN THE FONE IS HUNG UP (FOR HOLD) THE RESISTANCE
REMAINS BELOW 2500 OHMS WHICH CAUSES THE CO TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE STILL
OFF-HOOK.  YOU CAN BUILD A SIMPLE HOLD DEVICE USING THE FOLLOWING PICTORIAL

REVISED:  27-OCT-84

Preface:

    This article will focus primarily on the standard Western Electric
single-slot coin telephone (aka fortress fone) which can be divided into 3
types:

- Dial-Tone First (DTF)

- Coin-First (CF):  (ie, it wants your $ before you receive a dial tone)

- Dial Post-Pay Service (PP):  you pay after the party answers

Depositing Coins (Slugs):
____________________________________________________________

    Once you have deposited your slug into a fortress, it is subjected to a
gamut of tests. The first obstacle for a slug is the magnetic trap.  This will
stop any light-weight magnetic slugs and coins. If it passes this, the slug is
then classified as a nickel, dime, or quarter.  Each slug is then checked for
appropriate size and weight. If these tests are passed, it will then travel
through a nickel, dime, or quarter magnet as appropriate.  These magnets set up
an eddy current effect which causes coins of the appropriate characteristics to
slow down so they will follow the correct trajectory.  If all goes well, the
coin will follow the correct path (such as bouncing off of the nickel anvil)
where it will hopefully fall into the narrow accepted coin channel.
    The rather elaborate tests that are performed as the coin travels down the
coin chute will stop most slugs and other undesirable coins, such as pennies,
which must then be retrieved using the coin release lever.
    If the slug miraculously survives the gamut, it will then strike the
appropriate totalizer arm causing a ratchet wheel to rotate once for every
5-cent increment (eg, a quarter will cause it to rotate 5 times).
    The totalizer then causes the coin signal oscillator to readout a
dual-frequency signal indicating the value deposited to ACTS (a computer) or
the TSPS operator. These are the same tones used by phreaks in the infamous red
boxes.
    For a quarter, 5 beep tones are outpulsed at 12-17 pulses per second (PPS).
A dime causes 2 beep tones at 5 - 8.5 PPS while a nickel causes one beep tone
at 5 - 8.5 PPS.  A beep consists of 2 tones:  2200 + 1700 Hz.
    A relay in the fortress called the "B relay" (yes, there is also an 'A
relay') places a capacitor across the speech circuit during totalizer read-out
to prevent the "customer" from hearing the red box tones.
    In older 3 slot phones:  one bell (1050-1100 Hz) for a nickel, two bells
for a dime, and one gong (800 Hz) for a quarter are used instead of the modern
dual-frequency tones.

TSPS & ACTS
____________________________________________________________

                                    Page 120




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


    While fortresses are connected to the CO of the area, all transactions are
handled via the Traffic Service Position System (TSPS).  In areas that do not
have ACTS, all calls that require operator assistance, such as calling card and
collect, are automatically routed to a TSPS operator position.
    In an effort to automate fortress service, a computer system known as
Automated Coin Toll Service (ACTS) has been implemented in many areas.  ACTS
listens to the red box signals from the fones and takes appropriate action.  It
is ACTS which says, "Two dollars please (pause) Please deposit two dollars for
the next ten seconds" (and other variations). Also, if you talk for more than
three minutes and then hang-up, ACTS will call back and demand your money.
ACTS is also responsible for Automated Calling Card Service.
    ACTS also provide trouble diagnosis for craftspeople (repairmen
specializing in fortresses).  For example, there is a coin test which is great
for tuning up red boxes.  In many areas this test can be activated by dialing
09591230 at a fortress (thanks to Karl Marx for this information).  Once
activated it will request that you deposit various coins. It will then identify
the coin and outpulse the appropriate red box signal.  The coins are usually
returned when you hang up.
    To make sure that there is actually money in the fone, the CO initiates a
"ground test" at various times to determine if a coin is actually in the fone.
This is why you must deposit at least a nickel in order to use a red box!

Green Boxes:
____________________________________________________________

    Paying the initial rate in order to use a red box (on certain fortresses)
left a sour taste in many red boxer's mouths thus the GREEN BOX was invented.
The green box generates useful tones such as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to the
CO when appropriate. Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a fortress
station but it must be used by the CALLED party.

Here are the tones:

COIN COLLECT       700 + 1100 Hz
COIN RETURN       1100 + 1700 Hz
RINGBACK           700 + 1700 Hz

    Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO. This can be
accomplished by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed
by a 60 ms gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.
    Also, do not forget that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3
minute period is up.
    Incidentally, once the above MF tones for collecting and returning coins
reach the CO, they are converted into an appropriate DC pulse (-130 volts for
return & +130 volts for collect). This pulse is then sent down the tip to the
fortress.  This causes the coin relay to either return or collect the coins.
    The alleged "T-Network" takes advantage of this information.  When a pulse
for COIN COLLECT (+130 VDC) is sent down the line, it must be grounded
somewhere.  This is usually either the yellow or black wire. Thus, if the wires
are exposed, these wires can be cut to prevent the pulse from being grounded.
When the three minute initial period is almost up, make sure that the black &
yellow wires are severed; then hang up, wait about 15 seconds in case of a
second pulse, reconnect the wires, pick up the fone, hang up again, and if all
goes well it should be "JACKPOT" time.

Physical Attack:
____________________________________________________________

    A typical fortress weighs roughly 50 lbs. with an empty coin box. Most of
this is accounted for in the armor plating.  Why all the security?  Well, Bell
contributes it to the following:

        "Social changes during the 1960's made the multislot coin station a
prime target for:  vandalism, strong arm robbery, fraud, and theft of service.
This brought about the introduction of the more rugged single slot coin station
and a new environment for coin service."

As for picking the lock, I will quote Mr. Phelps:

        "We often fantasize about 'picking the lock' or 'getting a master
key.'  Well, you can forget about it. I don't like to discourage people, but it
will save you from wasting alot of your time--time which can be put to better
use (heh, heh)."

    As for physical attack, the coin plate is secured on all four side by
hardened steel bolts which pass through two slots each.  These bolts are in
turn interlocked by the main lock.
    One phreak I know did manage to take one of the 'mothers' home (which was
attached to a piece of plywood at a construction site; otherwise, the permanent
ones are a bitch to detach from the wall!). It took him almost ten hours to
open the coin box using a power drill, sledge hammers, and crow bars (which was
empty -- perhaps next time, he will deposit a coin first to hear if it slushes
down nicely or hits the empty bottom with a clunk.)
    Taking the fone offers a higher margin of success.  Although this may be
difficult often requiring brute force and there has been several cases of back
axles being lost trying to take down a fone!  A quick and dirty way to open the
coin box is by using a shotgun.  In Detroit, after ecologists cleaned out a
municipal pond, they found 168 coin phones rifled.
    In colder areas, such as Canada, some shrewd people tape up the fones using
duct tape, pour in water, and come back the next day when the water will have
froze thus expanding and cracking the fone open.In one case:

        "unauthorized coin collectors" where caught when they brought $6,000 in
change to a bank and the bank became suspicious...

    At any rate, the main lock is an eight level tumbler located on the right
side of the coin box.  This lock has 390,625 possible positions (5 ^ 8, since
there are 8 tumblers each with 5 possible positions) thus it is highly pick
resistant!  The lock is held in place by 4 screws.  If there is sufficient
clearance to the right of the fone, it is conceivable to punch out the screws
using the drilling pattern below (provided by Alexander Mundy in TAP)

   What is covered in these last few articles, is the essence of phreaking,
blue boxing & equal access.  These last articles, I hope will be the final
stage of phreak education for now.  Basic telecommunications 7 is a brief intro
to the art of blue boxing, while Better Homes & Blue Boxing will cover it in
full.  Equal access will be an interesting switch, it is installed in my area
already and I have been investigating it.  One thought is to call MCI operators
and box through them, over MCI lines...

Preface:

    After most neophyte phreaks overcome their fascination with Metro codes and
WATS extenders, they will usually seek to explore other avenues in the vast
phone network.  Often they will come across references such as "simply dial KP
+ 2130801050 + ST for the Alliance teleconferencing system in LA.". Numbers
such as the one above were intended to be used with a blue box; this article
will explain the fundamental principles of the fine art of blue boxing.

Genesis:
____________________________________________________________

    In the beginning, all long distance calls were connected manually by
operators who passed on the called number verbally to other operators in
series.  This is because pulse (aka rotary) digits are created by causing
breaks in the DC current (see Basic Telcom V). Since long distance calls
require routing through various switching equipment and AC voice amplifiers,
pulse dialing cannot be used to send the destination number to the end local
office (CO).

    Eventually, the demand for faster and more efficient long distance (LD)
service caused Bell to make a multi-billion dollar decision. They had to create
a signaling system that could be used on the LD Network. Basically, they had
two options:

[1]     To send all the signaling and supervisory information (ie, ON & OFF
HOOK) over separate data links.  This type of signaling is referred to as
out-of-band signaling.
                           -or-
[2]      To send all the signaling information along with the conversation
using tones to represent digits.  This type of signaling is referred to as
in-band signaling.

    Being the cheap bastard that they naturally are, Bell chose the latter (and
cheaper) method -- IN-BAND signaling.  They eventually regretted this, though
(heh, heh)...

IN-BAND SIGNALING PRINCIPLES:
____________________________________________________________

    When a subscriber dials a telephone number, whether in rotary or touch-tone
(aka DTMF), the equipment in the CO interprets the digits and looks for a
convenient trunk line to send the call on its way.  In the case of a local
call, it will probably be sent via an inter-office trunk; otherwise, it will be
sent to a toll office (class 4 or higher -- see Telcom IV) to be processed.

    When trunks are not being used there is a 2600 Hz tone on the line; thus,
to find a free trunk, the CO equipment simply checks for the presence of 2600
Hz. If it doesn't find a free trunk the customer will receive a re-order signal

                                    Page 124




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

(120 IPM busy signal) or the "all circuits are busy..." message.   If it does
find a free trunk it "seizes" it -- removing the 2600 Hz.  It then sends the
called number or a special routing code to the other end or toll office.

    The tones it uses to send this information are called multi-frequency (MF)
tones.  An MF tone consists of two tones from a set of six master tones which
are combined to produce 12 separate tones.  You can sometimes hear these tones
in the background when you make a call but they are usually filtered out so
your delicate ears cannot hear them. These are NOT the same as touch-tones.

    To notify the equipment at the far end of the trunk that it is about to
receive routing information, the originating end first sends a Key Pulse (KP)
tone.  At the end of sending the digits, #he originating end then sends a STart
(ST) tone. Thus to call 914-359-1517, the equipment would send KP + 9143591517
+ ST in MF tones.  When the customer hangs up, 2600 Hz is once again sent to
signify a disconnect to the distant end.

History:
____________________________________________________________

    In the November 1960 issue of The Bell System Technical Journal, an article
entitled "Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching" was published.
This journal, which was sent to most university libraries, happened to contain
the actual MF tones used in signaling.  They appeared as follows:

Digit                Tones
-----                -----
  1              700 +  900 Hz
  2              700 + 1100 Hz
  3              900 + 1100 Hz
  4              700 + 1300 Hz
  5              900 + 1300 Hz
  6             1100 + 1300 Hz
  7              700 + 1500 Hz
  8              900 + 1500 Hz
  9             1100 + 1500 Hz
  0             1300 + 1500 Hz
  KP            1100 + 1700 Hz
  ST            1500 + 1700 Hz
  11  (*)        700 + 1700 Hz
  12  (*)        900 + 1700 Hz
  KP2 (*)       1300 + 1700 Hz

(*)  Used only on CCITT SYSTEM 5 for special international calling.

    Bell caught wind of blue boxing in 1961 when it caught a Washington state
college student using one.  They originally found out about blue boxes through
police raids and informants. In 1964, Bell Labs came up with scanning
equipment, which recorded all suspicious calls, to detect blue box usage.
These units were installed in CO's where major toll fraud existed. AT&T
Security would then listen to the tapes to see if any toll fraud was actually
committed.  Over 200 convictions resulted from the project. Surprisingly
enough, blue boxing is not solely limited to the electronics enthusiast; AT&T
has caught businessmen, film stars, doctors, lawyers, college students, high
school students and even a millionaire financier (Bernard Cornfeld) using the
device.  AT&T also said that nearly half of those that they catch are
businessmen.

                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

    Of course, phone phreaks have achieved an almost cult status. They have
also had their fair share of media.  In October 1971, Esquire published the
infamous "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" article which featured phreaks such
as Captain Crunch, who took his name from the cereal which one gave away
whistles that produced a perfect 2600 Hz pitch; Joe Engressia, the blind
phreak; and Mark Bernay, one of the nation's first and oldest phreaks. Others
such as Apple computer co-founders Steve Wozniak & Steve Jobs have also had
blue box backgrounds. 1971 also saw the publication of the first issue of YIPL,
the phone phreak newsletter, (now TAP) under the editorship of supreme yippie
Abbie Hoffman.

Usage:
____________________________________________________________

    To use a blue box, one would usually make a free call to any 800 number or
distant directory assistance (NPA-555-1212).  This, of course, is legitimate.
When the call is answered, one would then swiftly press the button that would
send 2600 Hz down the line.  This has the effect of making the distant CO
equipment think that the call was terminated and it leaves the trunk hanging.
Now, the user has about 10 seconds to enter in the telephone number he wished
to dial -- in MF, that is.  The CO equipment merely assumes that this came from
another office and it will happily process the call. Since there are no records
(except on toll fraud detection devices!) of these MF tones, the user is not
billed for the call.  When the user hangs up, the CO equipment simply records
that he hung up on a free call.

Detection:
____________________________________________________________

    Bell has had 20 years to work on detection devices; therefore, in this day
and age, they are rather well refined.  Basically, the detection device will
look for the presence of 2600 Hz where it does not belong.  It then records the
calling number and all activity after the 2600 Hz.  If you happen to be at a
fortress fone, though, and you make the call short, your chances of getting
caught are significantly reduced (see Telcom VI). Incidentally, there have been
rumors of certain test numbers (see Telcom II) that hook directly into trunks
thus avoiding the need for 2600 Hz and detection!

    Another way that Bell catches boxers is to examine the CAMA (Centralized
Automatic Message Accounting) tapes. When you make a call, your number, the
called number, and time of day are all recorded.  The same thing happens when
you hang up.  This tape is then processed for billing purposes. Normally, all
free calls are ignored. But Bell can program the billing equipment to make note
of lengthy calls to directory assistance.  They can then put a pen register
(aka DNR) on the line or an actual full-blown tap.  This detection can be
avoided by making short-haul (aka local) calls to box off of.

    It is interesting to note that NPA+555-1212 originally did not return
answer supervision.  Thus the calls were not recorded on the AMA/CAMA tapes.
AT&T changed this though for "traffic studies!"

CCIS:
____________________________________________________________

    Besides detection devices, Bell has begun to gradually redesign the network
using out-of-band signaling.  This is known as Common Channel Inter-office
Signaling (CCIS).  Since this signaling method sends all the signaling
information over separate data lines, blue boxing is impossible under it.

                                    Page 126




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


    While being implemented gradually, this multi-billion dollar project is
still strangling the fine art of blue boxing. Of course until the project is
totally complete, boxing will still be possible. It will become progressively
harder to find places to box off of, though.  In areas with CCIS, one must find
a directory assistance office that doesn't have CCIS yet.  Area codes in Canada
and predominately rural states are the best bets.  WATS numbers terminating in
non-CCIS cities are also good prospects.

Pink Noise:
____________________________________________________________

    Another way that may help to avoid  detection is too add some "pink noise"
to the 2600 Hz tone. Since 2600 Hz tones can be simulated in speech, the
detection equipment must be careful not to misinterpret speech as a disconnect
signal.  Thus a virtually pure 2600 Hz tone is required for disconnect.

    Keeping this in mind, the 2600 Hz detection equipment is also probably
looking for pure 2600 Hz or else is would be triggered every time someone hit
that note (highest E on a piano =2637 Hz).  This is also the reason that the
2600 Hz tone must be sent rapidly; sometimes, it won't work when the  operator
is saying "Hello, hello."  It is feasible to send some "pink noise" along with
the 2600 Hz.  Most of this energy should be above 3000 Hz.  The pink noise
won't make it into the toll network (where we want our pure 2600 Hz to hit) but
it should make it past the local CO and thus the fraud detectors.

Construction:
____________________________________________________________

    While step-by-step details for the construction of a blue box is beyond the
scope of this tutorial, it is worthwhile to mention some of the details.

    First there are some alternatives but they are not as good as an actual
blue box.  Many computers are capable of generating MF tones. Thus, your local
phriendly software pirate should have a program compatible for your computer.

    However, it is highly advisable not to box from home as stated in The Ten
Commandments (as interpreted for phreaks by Fred Steinbeck -- TAP #86).

I.     Box thou not over thine home telephone wires, for those who doest must
surely bring the full wrath of the Chief Special Agent down upon thy heads.

    Another alternative that has a moderate success rate involves recording the
tones from a phriend with a box or computer onto a cassette tape.  They can
then be used at a fortress.

    As for actual construction techniques, TAP has devoted many issues to blue
boxing.  Basically, a blue box is merely a device capable of generating two
different tones simultaneously. There are two basic construction methods that I
will outline below for the electronics hobbyist.

    The first involves the use of two 555 timer chips (or a 556 -- i.e., two
555's in one chip).  It offers excellent frequency and voltage stability.
Also, it does not need a diode matrix keypad but used double-pole switches
instead.  Schematics for this type of box can be found in TAP issue #29.

    The other common box makes use of two Intersil 8038CC Function Generators.
It does require a diode matrix keypad though, potentiometers, an LM-100 voltage

                                    Page 127




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

regulator, a 741 Op-amp, and a handful of other parts.  The schematics for this
type of blue box can be found in TAP #26. Both designs draw about 20 ma of
current.

    Also, most blue boxes use telephone earpieces (with the varistor removed)
for speakers.  These can be easily liberated from fortress fones with a small
coping saw.

    Usually, the hardest part about building a blue box is the calibration. A
frequency counter is a must and an oscilloscope won't hurt.

    Some boxes also take timing into account.  It is feasible on the ESS
systems that they check to see if the digits are of uniform length.  If they
aren't, they are probably from a blue box and a trouble card may be dropped.
With this in mind, the Bell standard for MF pulses and interdigit intervals is
around 75 ms.  It varies with the equipment used since ESS can handle higher
speeds and doesn't need interdigit intervals.

Applications:
____________________________________________________________

    Besides dialing normal calls free, i.e., KP+NPA+NNX+XXXX+ST, blue boxes
offer the entire network for exploration.  Emergency break-ins, service
monitoring (aka taps), stacking tandems (the art of busying out all trunks
between two points), re-routing calls, conference calls, and much, much more
are all feasible.  Although, Bell frequently changes these codes due to
phreaks. Here are some standard ones, though:

Operator & Other Codes:
____________________________________________________________

    (an optional NPA may proceed all of the numbers; otherwise, you will reach
the one local for the area where the call is originated)

001  --  Trunk Access System
009  --  Rate Quote System
101  --  toll office test board
121  --  INWARD Operator

    This operator assists the local "0" operator in completing calls. (S)he
will do virtually anything for you  providing it is within her NPA.

131  --  Operator Directory assistance
141  --  Rout & Rate
141 defunct -- use KP + 800 + 141 +1212 + ST)

    These operators are very useful if you know how to mumble a few cryptic
phrases as compiled below (with thanks to Fred Steinbeck): To find out.....Area
Codes

         For example say , "Miami, Florida, numbers route, please." The R&R
operator will tell you "305 plus," meaning that 305 plus the seven digit number
will get you Miami.

... Inward Operator City Codes

         Usually, the INWARD operator for an area is simply KP + NPA + 121 +
ST.  In some area codes, though, there are several large cities and thus

                                    Page 128




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

several inwards.  To find the inward for a specific city, you would say "916
756, operator route, please" to the R&R operator who will then tell you "916
plus 001 plus."  This means that KP+ 916 + 001 + 121 + ST will get you an
inward for Sacramento, CA (916-756).

... City names

         If you want to know the city that corresponds to an area code and
exchange, you simply tell the R&R, "Place name, 914 390, please." In this
example, the R&R operator will respond with "White Plains, NY."

... International Directory Assistance

         If you need a directory route for London, you could say
"International, London, England.  TSPS directory route, please."  The R&R
operator will respond with "Directory to London, England. Country code 44 plus
1 plus 986 plus 3611." Therefore to get a DA operator in London, you would
route yourself to an international sender and KP + 04419863611 + ST.

... Country & City codes

         If you need to know the country and city code for an international
number you can say "International, Sydney, Australia, TSPS numbers route,
please" and get "Country code 61 plus 2."

... International Inwards Routes

         To get routing codes for international inwards say "International,
London, England, TSPS inward route, please." The R&R Operator will respond with
"Country code 44 plus 121."

    Finally, to get language assistance for completing a foreign call you can
tell the foreign inward, "United States calling.  Language assistance in
completing a call to (called party) at (called number)."

151      --  Overseas incoming (212 +& 914+)
160-XX0  --  Various Overseas Operators
161      --  Trouble reporting operator (defunct)
181      --  Coin Refund Operator
18X      --  Overseas senders

    To make an international call, one would KP + 011 + 0CC + ST where CC is
the country code.  This will route you to the appropriate overseas sender. You
will then receive a 480 Hz dial tone.  Here you enter KP + 0CC + city code +
local number + ST and the call is on its way.

    Country codes can be either 1, 2, or 3 digits but they must be padded for
three digits to create a pseudo-country code with extra zero's if necessary.
For example, England, country code 44, becomes 044.

    To see which international sender a certain country (lets use French
Guiana, country code 594, for example) goes through, you can dial KP + 011 +
594 + ST, wait for the Proceed to Send tone then KP + 000 + 0000 + ST and you
will receive a recording saying which ISC (International Switching Center) it
is.  For the example it will say, "This is the international switching center
in Pittsburg, PA -- This is a recording - 4121."  You can actually route calls
to certain senders yourself (KP + NPA + 18X + ST) but it is better off not to
since it may look suspicious if a call is sent through a sender that it

                                    Page 129




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

shouldn't go through.  Here are the senders:

182  -- White Plains, NY
183  -- New York, NY
184  -- Pittsburg, PA
185  -- Orlando, FL
186  -- Oakland, CA
187  -- Denver, CO
188  -- New York, NY

    Also, there tends to be alot of talk about the Code 11, Code 12, KP2, STP,
ST3P, & ST2P keys.  While they do exist the blue boxer need not concern himself
with them.  The first three are used on CCITT System 5.  This is the signaling
system that the International Senders use to send information to other
countries.  These codes are usually added automatically just like the language
assistance digit [which distinguishes operator (or blue box) dialed calls from
customer dialed calls].  The STP, ST3P, & ST2P tones are used when equipment is
communicating with the TSPS.  These also are automatically added when needed in
most cases.

Miscellaneous Routing Codes :
____________________________________________________________

    Alliance Teleconferencing has several numbers, a few of which are listed
below:

KP + 213 080 XXXX + ST
KP + 305 025 XXXX + ST
KP + 312 001 XXXX + ST
XXXX = 1050, 1100, or a few others

    Also, at KP + 317 009 + ST there is a MF tone checker.  After the
beep-kerclunk, dial in KP + 999 1234567 890 + ST and it will repeat the digits
that you pulsed if they are of the right frequency.

Tandem Scanning:
____________________________________________________________

    To find all sorts of interesting things, you must look.  Begin scanning
three digit codes in your area (i.e., KP + 000 + ST, KP + 001 + ST, etc.). Keep
track of all of your results. Sometimes you must probe things, send additional
digits and see what happens, send touch-tone, send it 2600 Hz, rip it apart.
You never know, you may run into something phun, like a computer that checks CC
numbers.

                                    Page 130




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


    Incidentally, in some exchange you can dial inwards and other box codes
directly!  For example, 914-121-1111 will get you a NY inward. The only problem
is that a 0 or 1 as the first digit of the exchange is usually *prohibited in
customer dialing. Somebody may have "accidentally" changed this screening code
on your ESS's computer, though -- you never know and it can't hurt to try.
WATS translation numbers also take up some of the 0XX & 1XX codes.

    Finally, certain tones on the blue box can also be used for other purposes.
An MF "2" corresponds to COIN COLLECT while "KP" corresponds to COIN RETURN.
Thus every blue box is also a green box (see Telcom VI).

Coming soon:

Telcom VIII will deal with cordless phones, mobile phones, and other neat
things.

Be careful and have phun,

                              Theory of Operation
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has always been the most noble form of
phreaking. As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make a free fone
call, which is merely mindless pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing is actual
interaction with the Bell System toll network. It is likewise advisable to be
more cautious when blue boxing, but the careful phreak will not be caught,
regardless of what type of switching system he is under.

  In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as where.
In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue boxing and
routing information.

  To begin with, blue boxing is simply communicating with trunks. Trunks must
not be confused with subscriber lines (or "customer loops") which are standard
telefone lines. Trunks are those lines that connect central offices. Now, when
trunks are not in use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state) they have 2600Hz applied
to them. If they are two-way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When a
trunk IS in use (busy or "off-hook" state"), the 2600Hz is removed from the
side that is off-hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a supervisory signal,
because it indicates the status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or off-hook (no
tone). Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency) signalling and is
"in-band." This is very important. "In-band" means that is is within the band
of frequencies that may be transmitted over normal telefone lines. Other SF
signals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However, they cannot be carried over the
telefone network normally (they are "out-of-band") and are therefore not able
to be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is.

  Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical phone call. You pick up your fone
and dial 1+806-258-1234 (your good friend in Armarillo, Texas). For ease, we'll
assume that you are on #5 Crossbar switching and not in the 806 area. Your
central office (CO) would recognize that 806 is a foreign NPA, so it would
route the call to the toll centre that serves you. [For the sake of accuracy
here, and for the more experienced readers, note that the CO in question is a
class 5 with LAMA that uses out-of-band SF supervisory signalling]. Depending
on where you are in the country, the call would leave your toll centre (on more
trunks) to another toll centre, or office of higher "rank". Then it would be
routed to central office 806-258 eventually and the call would be completed.

(2600Hz) signalling, while all the others use out-of-band signalling (3700Hz).
If you don't understand this, don't worry too much.  I am pointing this out
merely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you are connected to
806-258-1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office (CO1) to the 806-258
central office (CO2) do *NOT* have 2600Hz on them, indicating to the Bell
equipment that a call is in progress and the trunks are in use.

  Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in Amarillo
(806-258-1234) so you send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down the
line to your friend's central office (CO2) where it is detected.  However, that
CO thinks that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to it
that you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once again idle (with 2600Hz
present on them). But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled the
equipment at your friend's CO into thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects him
and resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens very
quickly (300-800ms for step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms for other
equipment).

  When you stop sending 2600Hz (after about a second), the equipment thinks
that another call is coming towards it (e.g. it thinks the far end has come
"off-hook" since the tone has stopped. It could be thought of as a toggle
switch: tone --> on hook, no tone -->off hook. Now that you've stopped sending
2600Hz, several things happen:

1) A trunk is seized.

2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that the
CALLED end (trunk) is not ready to receive digits yet.

3) A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within about
two seconds (max).

4) A start-dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end
indicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits.

Now, all of this is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he really
hears when these four things happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So, seizure of a
trunk would go something like this:

1> Send a 2600Hz
2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
3> [beep][kerchunk]

  Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey your
every command. The next step is to send signalling information in order to
place your call. For this you must simulate the signalling used by operators
and automatic toll-dialing equipment for use on trunks. There are mainly two
systems, DP and MF.  However, DP went out with the dinosaur , so I'll only
discuss MF signalling. MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the signalling used
by the majority of the inter- and intra-lata network. It is also used in
international dialing known as the CCITT no.5 system.

  MF signalling consists of 7 frequencies, beginning with 700Hz and separated
by 200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the digits 0
thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are as
follows:

Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l

1500+1700           ST         ST

  The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which
should have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent period
between digits. This is very flexible, however, and most Bell equipment will
accept outrageous timings.

  In addition to the standard uses listed above, MF pulsing also has expanded
usages known as "expanded inband signalling" that include such things as coin
collect, coin return, ringback, operator attached, and operator released. KP2,
code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes") all have special uses which
will be mentioned only briefly here.

  To complete a call using a blue box, once seizure of a trunk has been
accomplished by sending 2600Hz and pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one must
first send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow.  For a
standard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits (if the
call were in the same NPA as the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the call were
not in the same NPA as the seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing a normal fone
call]. Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is sent to signify
that no more digits follow. Example of a complete call:

1> Dial 1-806-258-1234
2> wait for a call-progress indication (such as ring, busy, recording, etc.)
3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
4> Wait for about 2 seconds while a trunk is seized.
5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST

  The call will then connect if every-thing was done properly. Note that if a
call to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the area code
would be omitted and only KP+ seven digits+ST would be sent.

  Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request certain
types of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a call other
than by way of the normal route, whether for economic or equipment reasons.

  STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two prime, and three prime) are used in TSPS
signalling to indicate calling type of call (such as coin-direct dialed).

                            Practical Applications
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

(It is assumed that the reader has read and understood Part I of this series).

  The essential purpose of blue boxing in the beginning was merely to receive
toll services free of charge. Though this can still be done, blue boxing has
essentially outlived its usefulness in this area. Modern day "extenders" and
long distance services provide a safer and easier way to make free fone calls.
However, you can do things with a blue box that just can't be done with
anything else. For ordinary toll-fraud, a blue box is impractical for the
following reasons:

1. Clumsy equipment required (blue box or equivalent)
2. Most boxed calls must be made through an extender. Not for safety reasons,
but for reasons I'll explain later.
3. Connections are often sacrificed because considerable distances must be
dialed to cross a seizable trunk, in addition to awkward routing.

  As stated in reason #2, boxed calls are usually made through an extender.
This is for billing reasons. If you recall from Part i, 2600Hz is used as a
"supervisory" signal. That is, it signals the status of a trunk--"on-hook" or
"off-hook." When you seize a trunk (by briefly sending 2600Hz), your end (the
CALLING end) goes on hook for the duration of the 2600Hz and then goes off-hook
once again when the 2600Hz is terminated.  The CALLED end recognizes that a
call is on the way and attaches a register, which interprets the digits which
are to be sent. Now, understand that even though your end has come off-hook (no
2600Hz present), the other end is still on-hook. You may wonder then, why, if
the other end (the CALLED end) is still on-hook, there is no 2600Hz coming the
other way on the trunk, when there should be. This is correct.  2600Hz *IS*
present on the trunk when you seize it and afterwards, but you cannot hear it
because of a Band Elimination Filter (BEF) at your central office.

  Back to the problem. Remember that when you seize a trunk, 2600Hz is indeed
coming the other way on the trunk because the CALLED end is still on-hook, but
you don't actually hear it because of a filter. However, the Bell equipment
knows it's there (they can "hear" it). The presence of the 2600Hz is telling
the billing equipment that your call has not yet been completed (i.e., the
CALLED end is still on-hook). When finally you do connect with your boxed call,
the 2600Hz from the called end terminates.  This tells the billing equipment
that someone picked up the fone at the CALLED end and you should begin to be
billed. So you do start to get billed, but for the call to the trunk, NOT the
boxed call. Your billing equipment thinks that you've connected with the number
you used to seize the trunk. Illustration:

1. You call 1+806-258-2222 (directly)
2. Status of trunks:

<----------------------------------->
(You)                    806-258-2222
No 2600Hz-------> <------------2600Hz

  When you seize a trunk (before the number you called answers) there is no

                                    Page 136




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

affect on your billing equipment.  It simply thinks that you're still waiting
for the call to complete (the CALLED end is still on-hook; it is ringing, busy,
going to recorder or intercept operator.

  Now, let's say that you've seized a trunk (806-258-2222) and for example,
KP+314+949+1705+ST. The call is routed from the tandem you seized to:
314-949-1705. Illustration:

<------------------>O<--------------->
(You)              806         314-949
    tandem
No 2600Hz----------> <----------2600Hz

  Note that the entire path towards the right (the CALLED end) has no 2600Hz
present and is therefore "off-hook." The entire path towards the left (the
CALLING end) does have 2600Hz present on it, indicating that the CALLED end has
not picked up (or come "off-hook"). When 314-949-1705 answers, "answer
supervision" is given and the 2600Hz towards the left (the CALLING end)
terminates. This tells your billing equipment, which thinks that you're still
waiting to be connected with 806-258-2222, that you've finally connected.
Billing then begins to 806-258-2222. Not exactly an auspicious beginning for an
aspiring young phone phreak.

  To avoid this, several actions may be taken. As previously mentioned, one may
avoid being charged for the number called to seize a trunk by using an extender
(in which case the extender will get billed). In some areas, boxing may be
accomplished using an 800 number, generally in the format of 800-858-xxxx (many
Amarillo numbers) or 800-NN2-xxxx (special intra-state class in-WATS numbers).
However, boxing off of 800 numbers is impossible in many areas. In my area,
Denver, I am served by #1A ESS and it is impossible for me to box off of any
800 number.

  Years ago, in the early days of blue boxing (before my time), phreaks often
used directory assistance to box off of because they were "free" long distance
calls. However, because of competitive long distance companies, directory
assistance surcharges are now $0.50 in many areas. It is additionally advised
that directory assistance numbers not be used to box from because of the
following:

  Average DA calls last under 2 minutes. When you box a call, chances are that
it will last considerably longer. Thus, the Bell billing equipment will make a
note of calls to directory assistance that last a long time. A call to a
directory assistant lasting for 4 hours and 17 minutes may appear somewhat
suspicious.

  Although the date, time, and length of a DA call do not appear on the bill,
it is recorded on AMA tape and will trip a trouble report if it were to last
too long. This is how most phreaks were discovered in the old days. Also,
sometimes too many calls lasting too long to one 800 number may raise a few
eyebrows at the local security office.

  Assuming you can complete a blue box call, the following are listed routings
for various Bell internal operators.  These are in the format of KP+NPA+
special routing+1X1+ST, which I will explain later. The 1X1 is the actual
operator routing, and NPA and NPA+ special routing are used for out-of-area
code calls and out-of-area code calls requiring special routing, respectively.

KP+101+ST ...... Toll test board.

                                    Page 137




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

KP+121+ST ...... Inward Operator.
KP+131+ST ...... Directory assistance.
KP+141+ST ...... was rate & route. Now only works in 312, 815, 717, and a few
others. It has been replaced with a universal rate & route number
800+141+1212.
KP+151+ST ...... Overseas completion operator (inbound). Works only in certain
NPAs, such as 303.
KP+181+ST ...... In some areas, toll station for small towns.

  Thus, if you seize a trunk in 806 NPA and wanted an inward (in 806), then you
would dial KP+121+ST. If you wanted a 312 inward and were dialing on an 806
trunk, an area code would be required.  Thus, you would dial KP+312+121+ST.
Finally, some places in the network require special routing, in addition to an
area code. An example is Franklin Park, Ill. It requires a special routing of
032. For this, you would dial KP+312+032+121+ST for a Franklin Park inward
operator.

  Special routings are in the format of 0XX. They are used primarily for load
balance, so that traffic flow may be evenly distributed. About half of the
exchanges in the network require special routing. Note that special routings
are NEVER EVER EVER used to dial normal telephone numbers, only operators.

  Operator functions:

TOLL TEST BOARD- Generally a cordboard position that assists in trunk testing.
They are not used by operators, only switchmen.

INWARD- Assists the normal TSPS (0+) operator in completing calls out of the
TSPS's area. Also, inwards perform emergency interrupts when the number to be
interrupted is out of the area code of the original (TSPS) operator. For
example, a 303 operator has a customer that needs an emergency interrupt on
215-647-6969. The 303 operator gets the routing for the inward that covers
215-647, since she cannot do the interrupt herself. The routing is found to be
only 215+ (no special routing required). So, the 303 operator keys
KP+215+121+ST. An inward answers and the 303 says to her, "Inward, this is
Denver. I need an emergency interrupt on 215-647-6969. My customer's name is
Mark Tabas." The inward will then do the interrupt (off the line, of course).
If the number to be interrupted had required special routing, such as, say,
312-456-1234 (spec routing 032), then the 303 operator would dial
KP+312+032+121+ST for the inward to do that interrupt.

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE- These are the normal NPA+555+1212 operators that assist
customers with obtaining telefone directory listings. Not much toll-fraud
potential here, except maybe $0.50.

RATE AND ROUTE-   These operators are reached by dialing KP+800+141+1212+ST.
They assist normal (TSPS) operators with rates and routings (thus the name).
The only uses I typically have for them are the following:

 1. Routing-
    Information-    In the above example, when the 303 operator needed to dial
an inward that served 215-647, she needed to know if any special routing was
required and, if so, what it was. Assuming she would use rate and route, she
would dial them and say nicely, "Operator's route, please, for 215-647." Rate &
route would respond with "215 plus."  This means that the operator would dial
KP+215+121+ST to reach the inward that serves 215-647.  If there were special
routing required, such as in 312-456, rate & route would respond with "312 plus
032 plus." In that case, the operator would dial KP+312+032+ST for the inward

                                    Page 138




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

that serves 312-456.

  It is good practice to ask for "operator's route" specifically, as there are
also "numbers route" and "directory routes." If you do not specifically ask for
operator's route, rate & route will generally assume that is what you want
anyway.

"Numbers"   route refers to overseas calls. Example, you want to know how to
reach a number in Geneva, Switzerland (and you already have the number). You
would call routing and say "Numbers route, please, Geneva, Switzerland." The
operator would respond with: "Mark 41+22. 011+041+ST (plus) 041+22" The "Mark
41+22" has to do with billing, so disregard it. The 011+041 is access to the
overseas gateway (to be discussed in Part iii) and the 041+ 22+ is the routing
for Geneva from the overseas sender.

"Directory" routings are for directory assistance overseas. Example: you want a
DA in Rome, Italy. You would call rate & route and say, "Directory routing
please, for Rome, Italy." They would respond with "011+039+ST (plus) 039+1108
STart." As in the previous example, the 011+039 is access to the overseas
gateway. The 039+1108 is a directory assistant in Rome.

 2. Nameplace information-  Rate & Route will give you the location of an NPA+
exchange. Example: "Nameplace please, for 215-648." The operator would respond
with "Paoli, Pennsylvania." This isn't especially useful, since you can get the
same information (legally) by dialing 0, but using rate & route is often much
faster and it avoids having to hang up when you are already on a trunk.

*NOTE*   On Rate & Route: As a blue boxer, always ask for "IOTC" routings.
(e.g., "IOTC operator's route", "IOTC numbers route", etc.) This tells them
that you want cordboard-type routings, not TSPS, because a blue boxer is
actually just a cordboard position (that Bell doesn't know about).

OVERSEAS COMPLETION
OPERATOR (inbound)-  These operators (KP+151+ST) assist in  the completion of
calls coming in to the United States from overseas. There are KP+151+ST
operators only in a few NPAs in the country (namely 303). To use one, you would
seize a trunk and dial KP+303+151+ST. Then you would tell the operator, for
example, "This is Bangladesh calling. I need U.S.  number 215-561-0562 please."
[in a broken Indian accent]. She would connect you, and the bill would be sent
to Bangladesh (where I've been billing my KP+151+ST calls for two years).

Other internal Bell Operators.

KP+11501+ST ...... universal operator
KP+11511+ST ...... conference op
KP+11521+ST ...... mobile op
KP+11531+ST ...... marine op
KP+11541+ST ...... long distance terminal
KP+11551+ST ...... time & charges op
KP+11561+ST ...... hotel/motel op
KP+11571+ST ...... overseas (outbound) op

  These 115X1 operators are identical in routing to the 1X1 operators listed
previously, with one exception. If special routing is required (0XX), then the
trailing 1 is left off.

Examples:

                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

A 312 universal op ... KP+312+11501+ST
A Franklin Park (312-456) universal op (special routing 032 required)........
KP+312+032+1150+ST  [The trailing 1 of 11501 is left off].

Purposes of 115X1 operators.

UNIVERSAL- Used for collect/callback calls to coin stations.

CONFERENCE- This is a cordboard conference operator who will set up a
conference for a customer on a manual operation basis.

MOBILE- Assists in completion of calls to mobile (IMTS) type telefones.

MARINE- Assists in completion of calls to ocean going vessels.

LONG DISTANCE TERMINAL- Now obsolete.Was used for completion of long distance
calls.

TIME & CHARGES- Will give exact costs of calls. Used to time calls and inform
customer of exactly how much it cost.

HOTEL/MOTEL- Handles calls to/from hotels and motels.

OVERSEAS
COMPLETION (outbound)- assists in completion of calls to overseas points. Only
works in some, if any NPAs, because overseas assistance has been centralized to
IOCC (covered in Part III).

  Note that all KP+1X1+ST and KP+115X1+ST operators automatically assume that
you are a TSPS or cordboard operator assisting a customer with a call. DO NOT
DO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE THIS! If you do not know what to do, don't call these
operators! Find out what to do first.

  This concludes Part II. There is one final part in which I will explain
overseas dialing, IOCC (International Overseas Completion Centre), RQS
(Rate/Quote System), and some basic scanning.

(It is assumed that the reader has read and understood parts i & ii before
proceeding to this part).

  In Parts I & II, I covered basic theory and domestic signalling and
operators. In this part I will explain overseas direct boxing, the IOCC, the
RQS, and some basic scanning methods.

Overseas Direct Boxing.

  Calling outside of the United States and Canada is accomplished by using an
"overseas gateway." There are 7 over-seas gateways in the Bell System, and each
one is designated to serve a certain region of the world. To initiate an
overseas call, one must first access the gateway that the call is to be sent
on. To do this automatically, decide which country you are calling and find its
country code.  Then, pad it to the left with zeros as required so it is three
digits. [Add 1, 2, or 3 zeros as required].

Examples:

Luxembourg (352) is 352 (stays the same)
Spain (34)   becomes 034 (1 zero added)
U.S.S.R. (7) becomes 007 (2 zeros added)

  Next, seize a trunk and dial KP+011+ CC+ST. Note that CC is the three digit
padded country code that you just determined by the above method. [For
Luxembourg, dial KP+011+352+ST, Spain KP+011+034+ST, and the U.S.S.R. KP+011+
007+ST]. This is done to route you to the appropriate overseas gateway that
handles the country you are dialing. Even though every gateway will allow you
to dial every dialable country, it is good practice to use the gateway that is
designated for the country you are calling.

  After dialing KP+011+CC+ST (as CC is defined above) you should be connected
to an overseas gateway. It will acknowledge by sending a wink (which is audible
as a <beep><kerchink> and a dial tone. Once you receive international dial
tone, you may route your call one of two ways: a) as an operator-originated
call, or b) as a customer-originated call. To go as a operator-originated call,
key KP+ country code (NOT padded with zeros)+ city code+number+ST. You will
then be connected, providing the country you are calling can receive
direct-dialed calls. The U.S.S.R. is an example of a country that cannot.

Example of a boxed int'l call:

To make a call to the Pope (Rome, Italy), first obtain the country code, which
is 39. Pad it with zeros so that it is 039. Seize a trunk and dial
KP+011+039+ST. Wait for sender dial tone and then dial KP+39+6+6982+ST.  39 is
the country code, 6 is the city code, and 6982 is the Pope's number in Rome. To
go as an operator-originated call, simply place a zero in front of the country
code when dialing on the gateway. Thus, KP+0+39+6+6982+ST would be dialed at
sender dial tone. Routing your call as operator-originated does not affect much
unless you are dialing an operator in a foreign country

                                    Page 141




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


  To dial an operator in a foreign country, you must first obtain the operator
routing from rate & route for that country. Dial rate & route and if you're
trying to get an operator in Yugoslavia, say nicely, "IOTC Operator's route,
please, for Yugoslavia." [In larger countries it may be necessary to specify a
city].  Rate & route will respond with, "38 plus 11029". So, dial your overseas
gateway, KP+011+038+ST, wait for sender dial tone, and key KP+0+38+11029+ST.
You should then get an operator in Yugoslavia. Note that you must prefix the
country code on the sender with a 0 because presumably only an operator here
can dial an operator in a foreign country.

  When you dial KP+011+CC+ST for an overseas gateway, it is translated to a
3-digit sender code of the format 18X, depending on which sender is designated
to handle the country you are dialing. The overseas gateways and their 3-digit
codes are listed below.

182 ..... White Plains, NY
183 ..... New York, NY
184 ..... Pittsburg, PA
185 ..... Orlando, FL
186 ..... Oakland, CA
187 ..... Denver, CO
188 ..... New York, NY

  Dialing KP+182+ST would get you the sender in White Plains, and KP+183+ST
would get the sender in NYC, etc., but the KP+011+CC+ST is highly suggested (as
previously mentioned). To find out what sender you were routed to after dialing
KP+011+CC+ST, dial (at int'l dial tone): KP+0000000+ST.

  If you have difficulty in reaching a sender, call rate and route and ask for
a numbers route for the country you're dialing. Sometimes, KP+011+ padded
country code+ST will not work.  I have found this in many 3-digit country
codes. Luxembourg, country code 352, for example, should be KP+011+352+ST
theoretically. But it is not. In this case, dial KP+011+ 003+ST for the
overseas gateway. If you have trouble, try dialing KP+00+ first digit of
country code+ST, or call rate The IOCC.

  Sometimes when you call rate and route and ask for an "IOTC numbers route" or
"IOTC operators route" for a foreign country, you will get something like
"160+700" (as in the case of the Soviet Union). This means that the country is
not dialable directly and must be handled through the International Overseas
Completion Centre (IOCC). For an IOCC routing, pad the country code to the
RIGHT with zeros until it is 3 digits. Then KP+160 is dialed, plus the padded
country code, plus ST.  Examples:

The U.S.S.R. (7) ...... KP+160+700+ST
Japan (81) ............ KP+160+810+ST
Uraguay (598) ......... KP+160+598+ST

  You will then be routed to the IOCC in Pittsburg, PA, who will ask for
country, city, and number being dialed.  Many times they will ask for a
ringback [thanks to Telenet Bob] so have a loop ready. They will then place the
call and call you back (or sometimes put you through directly). Some calls,
such as to Moscow, take several hours.

The Rate Quote System (RQS).

  The RQS is the operator's rate/quote system. It is a computer used by TSPS

                                    Page 142




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

(0+) operators to get rate and route information without having to dial the
rate and route operator. In Part ii, I discussed getting an inward routing for
dialing-assistance and emergency interrupts from the rate and route operators
(KP+800+141+1212+ST). The same information is available from RQS. Say you want
the inward routing for 305-994. You would seize a trunk and dial KP+009+ST (to
access the RQS).  Sometimes, if you seize a trunk in an NPA not equipped with
RQS, you need to dial an NPA that is equipped with RQS first, such as 303.
Anyway, after you dial KP+009+ST or KP+303+009+ST, you will receive a wink
(<beep><kerchink>) and then RQS dial tone. At RQS dial tone, for an inward
routing for 305-994 you would dial KP+06+305+994+ST. That is,
KP+06+NPA+exchange+ST. RQS will respond with "305 plus 033 plus". This means
you would dial KP+305+033+121+ST for an inward that services 305-994.  If no
special routing were required, RQS would have responded with "305 plus" and you
would simply dial: KP+305+121+ST for an inward.

  Another RQS feature is the echo feature. You can use it to test your blue
box. Dial RQS (KP+009+ST) and then key KP+07+1234567890+ST. RQS will respond
with voice identification of the digits it recognized, between the KP+07 and
ST.

  RQS can also be used for rates and directory routings, but those are seldom
needed, so they have been omitted here.

Simple Scanning.

  If you're interested in scanning, try dialing on a trunk, routings in the
format of KP+11XX1+ST. Begin with 11001 and scan to 11991. There are lots of
interesting things to be found there, as Doctor Who (413 area) can tell you.
Those 11XX1 routings can also be prefixed with an NPA, so if you want to scan
area code 212, dial KP+212+ 11XX1+ST.

  There, now you know as much about blue boxing as most phreaks. If you read
and understand the material, and put aside preconceived ideas of what blue
boxing is that you may have acquired from inexperienced people or other
bulletin boards, you should be well on you way to an enlightening career in
blue boxing. If you follow the guidelines in Part I to box, you should have no
problem with the fone company. Comments made by "phreaks" on bulletin boards
that proclaim "tracing" of blue boxers are nonsense and should be ignored
(except for a passing chuckle).

NOTE 1: CCIS and the downfall of blue boxing.

CCIS stands for Common Channel Inter-office Signalling. It is a signalling
method used between electronic switching systems that eminiates the use of
2600Hz and 3700Hz supervisory signals, and MF pulsing. This is why many places
cannot be boxed off of; they employ CCIS, or out-of-band signalling, which will
not respond to any tones that you generate on the line. Eventually, all
existing toll equipment will be upgraded or replaced with CCIS or T-carrier. In
this case, we'll all be boxing with microwave dishes. Until then (about 1995 by
current BOC/AT&T estimates), have fun!

                          BY FRED STEINBECK (TAP #88)

        IT SEEMS THAT FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BLUE BOXES THESE DAYS, AND
THAT IS REALLY TOO BAD.  BLUE BOXES, WHILE NOT ALL THAT GREAT FOR MAKING FREE
CALLS (SINCE THE TPC CAN TELL WHEN THE CALL WAS MADE, AS WELL AS WHERE IT WAS
TOO AND FROM), ARE REALLY A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY WITH.  SHORT OF BECOMING A REAL
LIVE TSPS OPERATOR, THEY ARE ABOUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY PLAY WITH THE
NETWORK.
        FOR THE FEW OF YOU WITH BLUE BOXES, HERE ARE SOME PHRASES WHICH MAY
MAKE LIFE EASIER WHEN DEALING WITH THE RATE & ROUTE (R&R) OPERATORS.  TO GET
THE R&R OP, YOU SEND A KP + 141 + ST.  IN SOME AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO PUT
ANOTHER NPA BEFORE THE 141 (I.E., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), IF YOU HAVE NO LOCAL
R&R OPS.
        THE R&R OPERATOR HAS A MYRIAD OF INFORMATION, AND ALL IT TAKES TO GET
THIS DATA IS MUMBLING CRYPTIC PHRASES.  THERE ARE BASICALLY FOUR SPECIAL
PHRASES TO GIVE THE R&R OPS.  THEY ARE NUMBERS ROUTE, DIRECTORY ROUTE, OPERATOR
ROUTE, AND PLACE NAME.
        YOU GET AN R&R AN AREA CODE FOR A CITY, ONE CAN CALL THE R&R OPERATOR
AND ASK FOR THE NUMBERS ROUTE.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIND THE AREA CODE FOR CARSON
CITY, NEVADA, WE'D ASK THE R&R OP FOR "CARSON CITY, NEVADA, NUMBERS ROUTE,
PLEASE." AND GET THE ANSWER, "RIGHT... 702 PLUS." MEANING THAT 702 PLUS 7
DIGITS GETS US THERE.
        SOMETIMES DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE ISN'T JUST NPA + 131.  THE WAY TO GET
THESE ROUTINGS IS TO CALL R&R AND ASK FOR "ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA, DIRECTORY
ROUTE, PLEASE." OF COURSE, SHE'D TELL US IT WAS 714 PLUS, WHICH MEANS 714 + 131
GETS US THE D.A. OP THERE.  THIS IS SORT OF POINTLESS EXAMPLE, BUT I COULDN'T
COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE ON SHORT NOTICE.
        LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET TO THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.  THE FIRST SIX DIGITS OF A NUMBER IN THAT CITY WILL BE
REQUIRED (THE NPA AND AN NXX).  FOR EXAMPLE, LET US USEM 916 756. WE WOULD CALL
R&R, AND WHEN THE OPERATOR ANSWERED, SAY, "916 756, OPERATOR ROUTE, PLEASE."
THE OPERATOR WOULD SAY, "916 PLUS 001 PLUS."  THIS MEANS THAT 916 + 001 + 121
WILL GET YOU THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR SACRAMENTO.
      DO YOU KNOW THE CITY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO 503-640?  THE R&R OPERATOR
DOES, AND WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS HILLSBORO, OREGON, IF YOU SWEETLY ASK FOR
"PLACE NAME, 503 640, PLEASE."
        FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU NEED THE DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR SVEG, SWEDEN.
SIMPLY CALL R&R, AND ASK FOR, "INTERNATIONAL, BADEN, SWITZERLAND.  TSPS
DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE."  IN RESPONSE TO THIS, YOU'D GET, "RIGHT... DIRECTORY
TO SVEG, SWEDEN.  COUNTRY CODE 46 PLUS 1170."  SO YOU'D ROUTE YOURSELF TO AN
INTERNATIONAL SENDER, AND SEND 46 + 1170 TO GET THE D.A. OPERATOR IN SWEDEN.
        INWARD OPERATOR ROUTINGS TO VARIOUS COUNTRIES ARE OBTAINED THE SAME WAY
"INTERNATIONAL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TSPS INWARD ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET "COUNTRY
CODE 44 PLUS 121."  THEREFORE, 44 PLUS 121 GETS YOU INWARD FOR LONDON.
        INWARDS CAN GET YOU LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK THE
LANGUAGE. TELL THE FOREIGN INWARD, "UNITED STATES CALLING.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE
IN COMPLETING A CALL TO (CALLED PARTY) AT (CALLED NUMBER)."
        R&R OPERATORS ARE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE TOO, Y'KNOW.  SO ALWAYS BE POLITE,
MAKE SURE USE OF 'EM, AND DIAL WITH CARE.

NOTE:  AS A RESULT OF THE BREAK-UP, R&R IS NOW KP+800+141+1212+ST

                                 Verification
                               By Fred Steinbeck

From TAP issue # 88  10-83

   There has been a great deal of controversy in the realm of phreakdom over a
mysterious subject known under a number of different names, including
"Verification", "Autoverification", "Verify", "Autoverify", "Verify Busy", and
even "VFY BY".  All of these names basically mean the same thing: the ability
to listen to another person's telephone line from any telephone in the
direct-dialable world.
   Needless to say, Bell System is very tight lipped about knowledge regarding
verification.  Indeed, the infamous book 'Notes on long distance dialing' ('68
edition) says, "Care must be taken to insure that the customer never gains
verification capabilities."  With a printed policy like that, you can imagine
what their real-world policy is like!  Even their own rate and route operators
will not give verification on routing codes (at least in my experience), one
even responding, "What?! You must be crazy! We don't give those out!" Before
you get too far into this article, I will state simply: I don't know how to
verify. However, I have been fooling with various things related to it, and
collecting information on it for some time now. Therefore, while I can't do it
(yet), I may be able to point some other bright TAPer on the right track, and
perhaps he or she will show us all how.  If you have knowledge not covered in
this article, but don't want to write an article on your own, please send your
ideas, comments, or information to Project Verify, C/O TAP   Verify has also
been called "Autoverify", and I have no idea why.  This is not, to my
knowledge, a Bell System term (at least I've never seen it in any manuals)  As
far as I know, there is verify, which means being able to listen to speech
(kind of; see below) on a line, and there is the "Emergency Interrupt which
allows you to take part in the conversation taking place on the line in
question.  It has been suggested that "Autoverify" is the same as an emergency
interrupt , but I tend to disagree with this idea.  It should be noted that the
verification circuitry does not actually let an operator listen to a
conversation without making a beep on the line every so often.  Instead, she
will hear encrypted speech.  However, I believe with the proper methods, verify
can be converted to an emergency interrupt.
   Verification is normally done either by your normal "0" (TSPS) operator, if
the call is in your home NPA (HNPA), or by an inward operator (IO).  If the
call is outside your HNPA, your normal operator will call the IO for the
NPA,and say, "Verify Busy" or "Emergency Interrupt" please, 555 1212."  The IO
will perform whatever magic he or she must, and then report back.  If the call
is in your HNPA, though, the "0" operator can do the verification herself by
using the "VFY BY" key on her keyshelf.  However, in some areas, the operator
uses a routing code to accomplish verification, and this the is loop hole we
shall attack.
  It follows that if a IO or "0" operator can do it, so can we, with a blue box
Now, courtesy of Robert Allen (who brought it to my attention) and Susan
Thunder (who apparently discovered it), here is what used to work for getting
operators to hook you into conversations with other people (i.e.,let you listen
to them till you hung up): You'd call the operator and say "Operator, TSPS
Maintenance Engineer Calling.  Ring forward to 001 + NPA + 7d, ring back to my
number, hit ring forward, no AMA, and then position release.
   This creates some problems, and you must be familiar with the TSPS
console(by dialing "0"), you are on the "back", or incoming part of a loop.
When she places a call for you, the call goes out on the "forward", or outgoing
part of the loop.  If an operator wants to make a call, she punches KP FWD
(keypulse forward), the number, and ST. Ring FWD puts a 90 volt ringing signal
across the forward part of the line (and may dial the number as well).  The

                                    Page 146




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

problem arises from the fact that I don't know if Ring FWD will actually dial a
call, and if there is some other subtle difference between it an KP FWD.
   Let us assume ringing forward makes a call from the TSPS console to whatever
number is given.  Ring back causes your phone to ring (it is assumed you hung
up after giving her your instructions; if you didn't you'd hear an annoying 90
volts across the earpiece...) "No AMA" means "no automatic message accounting",
so nobody gets billed for the call, although it will show up on a tape
somewhere.  "Position Release" removes the operator from the circuit, and
allows her to receive other calls.  This leaves an unaccounted-for ring
forward.
   The verification circuit, as you know, likes to encrypt conversation, which
is something we don't want.  Well, the second Ring FWD sends another  90 volts
crashing against the verify circuitry, which Juda Gerad thinks removes the
voice encryption from the line, puts the operator (and you) in circuit, and
puts a beep tone on the line every five seconds.  This seems to make sense, and
I am inclined to agree with him.
   The bit about "....001 + NPA + 7D" causes the thought "MF routing code" to
spring immediately to mind.  Now, the above trick was supposed to work in the
213 NPA.  I have tried both "KP+001+213+7D+ST", and some other area codes.  I
generally get nothing, a reorder signal, or a tandem recording.
   Here's some food for thought: On an official Telco sheet I have, labeled "
213 NPA MF Routing Codes", 001 is listed as "VFY BY", or verify busy for the
213 NPA.  002 is listed for the 805 NPA.  Ma Bell likes to have standardized
routing codes, such logical, then, that 001 would be a sort of "standard"
verify code, and other prefixes would be tacked on at 002,003, etc. However, I
have heard from a retired operator that verification codes are different from
area to area, and are not always nice numbers like 001, 002.  Ah, well, a guy
can hope, can't he?
   Some suggestions for future attacks on this dilemma: Everyone call your
operators and subtly ask questions.  I have found the tend to give information
out easier if you ask for something that you would ordinarily have to be a
company employee to know about, such as rate steps, operator routings, etc.
    Casually let slip that you used to be (or still are) an operator, or that
you work for company security.  Also, you might want to blue box some codes
like 001 followed by your NPA and the last 7D of a busy number.  If you get a
sort of "whispery noise", try blasting the line with a ringing signal (you
might piggyback another line onto yours and call the piggyback to generate the
90 volts) and see if that does anything.

                      EQUAL ACCESS AND THE AMERICAN DREAM
                      ===================================


by

Mark Tabas
P.O. Box 620401
Littleton, CO 80162

July 7, 1985



  The American Dream means many things to many people.  To the small, typical
businessman, it means building a good, strong business based on hard work and
perseverance; indeed, with nothing limiting his potential but he amount of work
he is willing to put into his business.  To a large businessman, the American
Dream means living and working in a country where a single corporation can have
a profit exceeding the gross national product of an entire third world nation.
    To the individual, the American Dream is the right to choose -- everything
from one's breakfast cereal to a long-distance service, as well as the formal
right outlined by our founding fathers: those of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness.
  To the phone phreak, I think the American Dream is, in a sort of twisted way,
the uninhibited pursuit of knowledge.  This quest could scarcely remain
unchecked in many other countries.  Analogous to this quest is the thriving of
the Bell System, which until January 1, 1984 consisted of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company, the largest corporation in the history of the
world.  Did the American Dream die on January first or did the divestiture of
AT&T cause a giant step forward for competition and free enterprise in the
United States?  I do not know.  I do know that the other nations of the world
were amazed that the United States would dissolve the entity that brought the
finest and most universal telephone system in the world, and did so at a time
when the majority of the rest of the world was still using two dixie cups and a
string.
  The unfairness of the situation is that AT&T built the telephone system of
this nation and is now being bound and gagged and having its possessions
distributed to others, whom AT&T also wrought.  All in the name of fairness,
free competition, and "equal access".  Where was was MCI during the century
that AT&T built he communications system of this nation?  Well, I believe in
Equal Access, Wholly.  And, since I believe in equal access and its
implications for equality for all so strongly, I feel that MCI, Sprint, and
others should take the same amount of time to build their respective toll
networks: 100 years. Therefore, if the United States Justice Department were
truly the fair and just administrator that it portrays itself to be, MCI would
not have a hand in the long-distance cache until about 2080.  That's only
fair.
  There is no doubt that MCI is a sub-standard organization.  They consist of
incompetent employees, inferior equipment, and an inferior marketing strategy.
They are mockingly imitative of AT&T, except in the quality of their service,
which is practically unusable.  It is also interesting that with less than 2%
market share, MCI calls itself "the nation's long-distance company."  The point
to this diatribe is this.  It's time for these long-distance companies such as
MCI and Sprint to grow up.  With Equal Access, they are going to become real
long-distance companies, not the joke organizations they are now, and I think
it may just take them one hundred years to do so.

                        The Official Phreaker's Manual


                                 ============
                                 Equal Access
                                 ============

  Equal Access, as it applies to the telecommunications industry, is "the
requirement that each Bell Operating Company provide exchange access to all
long-distance carriers that is equal in type and quality to that provided AT&T
communications."  This is the official provision set forth by the United States
Justice Department in the Modification of the Final Judgment, August 24, 1982.
All this means is that each long-distance-distance company will have "equal
access" to all of the same types of services that AT&T currently enjoys.  There
are four types of long-distance carrier services, divided into "feature
groups."  They follow.

FG A:   "line side access."  This is the standard 7-digit dialup+code (for
billing purposes) +destination telephone number.  It is currently in use by
most long-distance carriers.

FG B:   "trunk side access."  These are the 950 exchange numbers. They also
utilize an authorization code for billing.  As with FG A, automatic     number
identification (ANI) (i.e. calling number) is not provided to the carrier, but
will be in the future.

FG C:   "1+ dialing."  Currently, only AT&T is able to get this type of
service. It is 1/0+7 of 10 digit direct long distance dialing.  ANI (for
billing) is provided.

FG D:    "equal access."  This will allow for 1/0+7 or 10 digit direct
long-distance dialing (presubscription carrier) and 10xxx+1/0+7 or 10 digit
long-distance dialing (alternate carrier).  ANI for billing is provided at the
long-distance carrier's option.  Billing may also be handled by the individual
long distance company or the local Bell Operating Company.

  Feature groups C and D are mutually exclusive (i.e. both cannot exist in a
particular area at the same time).  Areas which have Feature Group C (AT&T
long-distance only) are non-Equal Access, and areas which have Feature Group D
(multiple long distance carriers) are Equal Access regions.
  Feature Group B, the 950 exchange numbers will be used in areas in which it
is not feasible to provide with Equal Access, such as step-by-step offices
(yes, they CAN have 950 numbers), some crossbar offices, and some independent
telcos, which are not bound by the provisions of Equal Access and may provide
to their customers any type of long-distance service(s) they wish.  The 950
exchange is now active in many areas.  It is mainly used as a universal
"roaming" access port for many long-distance carriers, but when an office is
converted to Equal Access, the 950 capability is removed.  Thus, in an Equal
Access region, one cannot complete a call to a 950 telephone number.
  I personally am looking very forward to Equal Access.  My area is not
scheduled for full implementation of it until late 1985 or early 1986, and by
this time many of the alternate long distance carriers' networks will be in
place (or well under way).  Think about what Equal Access means.  Equality for
all long distance carriers.  Access to common facilities, such as: busy-line
verification lines, Bell System information, signalling specifications. etc.
After full implementation of Equal Access, one will be able to take advantage
of and manipulate the services of more than just one carrier.  It will no
longer be phreaks vs. AT&T.
  When your area is ready to initiate Equal Access, you will receive a notice
in the mail informing you of some of the details of Equal Access, and will ask

                                    Page 149




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

you to specify your choice of "primary carrier." In some cases you will need to
specify both inter-LATA carrier (IC), which handles calls out of your LATA
(Local Access and Transport Area), and an international carrier (INC), which
will handle calls destined for other countries.  Recent market studies have
shown that between 80 and 90 per cent of residential customers will continue to
be served by AT&T for their long-distance service after Equal Access.  So much
for competition.
  You will probably be faced with many long-distance companies to choose from,
including but not limited to: AT&T, MCI, Sprint, ITT, Western Union, Dial U.S.,
Call America, TMC, and U.S. Telephone. Whichever you choose will become your
"primary carrier."  Your primary carrier will handle your call each time you
pick up you fone and dial 1+7 or 10 digits or 0+7 or 10 digits, inter-LATA
only. That is, if you dial a toll call that is within your LATA, it will be
handled by your local telephone company (Bell), not by your primary carrier,
even though it is a toll call.  Let's use an example.  The state of Colorado
consists of two LATAs.  For this example, I will use three cities in Colorado:
Denver (in LATA1), Sterling (LATA1 also), and Colorado Springs (in LATA2).
Note here that even though Denver ad Sterling are in the same LATA, and Denver
and Colorado Springs are not, Sterling is actually much farther away from
Denver than Colorado Springs.  This is because LATA boundaries were designed
giving consideration to high toll-traffic regions, to bring in revenue.  Toll
traffic between Denver and Colorado Springs is very high, so the two cities
were placed in separate LATAs (or, more correctly, they were separated by a
LATA boundary).  Toll traffic between Denver and Sterling is very low, of the
two cities were allowed to remain in the same LATA.  Now, if everyone in
Colorado Springs were to pack up and move to Sterling (though who knows what
the hell for), the LATA boundaries in Colorado would be changed so that Denver
and Sterling were in different LATAs.  The primary factor in determining LATAs
is money.
  If I made a call to Sterling from my home in Denver, the call would be routed
entirely via Mountain Bell long-distance facilities.  No long distance carrier
would be involved because Denver and Sterling are in LATA1.  If I made a call
to Kelley, the blonde babe in Colorado Springs, the call would be handled by a
long distance carrier (in this case, AT&T) because Denver is in LATA1 and
Colorado Springs is in LATA2.  Here is a table to simplify this:

Customer dials          LATA          Carrier
-----------------------------------------------------------------
7 digits                same          Bell
1+7 digits              same          Bell
1+7 digits              diff          LD carrier (currently AT&T)
1+10 digits             diff          LD carrier (currently AT&T)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  Note several things here.  First, not all areas need to dial a 1 when dialing
any number, local or long distance, but the central offices will still discern
whether the call is in the same LATA as the customer or a different one and
handle the call appropriately. Secondly, some step-by-step offices require a
1+NPA to be dialed for calls within the same LATA and, in fact, all numbers
outside of the office itself.  But, for the most part, the above table is
standard for common switching networks.

                              Alternate Carriers
                              ==================

  Your normal long distance carrier will handle all your toll calls which cross
over LATA boundaries when you dial directly, 1+.  If you wish to place your

                                    Page 150

call via another carrier's network, whether for cost, quality, or circuit
availability reasons, you may do so in Equal Access regions.  To access an
alternate long distance carrier after Equal Access, a customer dials
10xxx+1/0+7 or 10 digit telefone number.  Note that xxx is the "carrier access
code (CAC)."  A few CACs currently in use are listed below.

220 ........ Western Union   666 ........ Lexitel
222 ........ MCI             777 ........ Sprint
333 ........ US Telefone     888 ........ SBS
444 ........ Allnet

  Thus, in an Equal Access region, to dial Fred in Orlando, a customer would
dial 1+305+994+9966 to place his call on his primary carrier, or to place it on
another network, he could dial: 10222+1+305+994+9966, and the call would go
over MCI facilities (in this case).  Eventually, after many more long distance
services get into the act, there will be a directory of the various long
distance companies and their CACs, and deciding which carrier to use for any
particular call to get the bet rate will be beyond the ability of everyone
except phone phreaks.

                               ================
                               The 950 Exchange
                               ================

  As discussed, the 950 central office exchange is currently a "roaming" access
port for various long distance carriers.  In areas that have 950, the access to
carriers is standardized.  Thus, someone travelling to several different areas
need only know the 950 number of the carrier he uses to access it from any area
(provided that it have 950 active).  Originally, the 950 exchange was designed
to correspond with the 10xx carrier access code used for Equal Access.  For
example, 950-1022 would be the same carrier as 1022 (+telephone number).
However, it was later found that the 100 codes available for use as 10xx CACs
would be insufficient to handle he number of long distance carriers.  So, the
common carrier access code was increased by one digit, to 10xxx, thus
increasing the number of possible CACs to 1000. To keep the 950 exchange
consistent with the non CAC, the Bell Operating Companies have opted to change
the 950-10xx to 950-0xxx. The xxx in the 950-0xxx remains the same as the xxx
in the 10xxx carrier access code.  The new modified 950 numbering pan is now
active in Philadelphia (Bell Atlantic) among other areas.
  After Equal Access is well under way, the 950 exchange will be used in
certain areas that cannot be equipped for the standard Equal Access dialing
plans.  This includes step-by-step, #1 crossbar, #5 crossbar, #2ESS, and #3ESS
offices.  Customers in areas served by these types of switching equipment will
dial 950-0xxx, wait for acknowledgement tone from the carrier, and then dial a
"personal identification number" and destination telefone number,and the call
will be completed on the selected carrier's facilities.  Initially, billing
will be handled by the carrier itself, and supervisory information and ANI will
not be provided by the local Bell Operating Company.
  There are three main advantages to the 950 central office exchange and
protocol.  They are: a) universal access for all areas, b) 950-exchange numbers
are "trunk side access."  This means that the long distance carrier has direct
trunks going to it from a Bell toll office or local central office.  These
trunks are interoffice lines, not customer type (POTS) lines, and supposedly
insure higher quality of connection.  And, c) 950-exchange numbers are toll and
message unit free.  On metered-usage (i.e., not "flat rate") customer lines,
they cost nothing.  In most areas they are free from coin stations, with
Colorado as one notable exception.

  Each long-distance carrier must choose the type(s) of service it wishes to
provide to its customers.  These different types of service were outlined
earlier as "Feature Groups."  The costs of these Feature Groups vary directly
with the complexity and quality of the service itself.  The following table
outlines the cost to the carrier of each available Feature Group.  It is based
on the monthly rate per line for 9000 minutes of circuit use, and assumes the
carrier and Bell switch are 15 miles apart.

FG              non-Equal Access            Equal Access
--------------------------------------------------------
A                  $329.94                    $709.20
B                   329.94                     721.80
C                   752.40                    ** N/A **
D                  ** N/A **                   752.40
--------------------------------------------------------

  These figures are a lot more significant than they might appear. They
indicate that after Equal Access, in order to compete with the giants such as
AT&T, MCI, etc., smaller long distance companies will use Feature Group A or B
type service in order to provide significantly lower rates to their customers
than companies subscribing to Feature Group D service (like AT&T, MCI, etc).
This will cause a unique type of equilibrium to form.  Customers willing to
dial an access number, authorization code, and destination number and put up
with lower quality service will be able to save a lot of money. This seems
faintly reminiscent of pre-Equal Access times....

                             ====================
                             Directory Assistance
                             ====================

  Each Bell Operating Company will be responsible for providing intra-LATA
operator services.  When a customer dials (1)+411 or (1)+555+1212 for local
directory assistance, he will reach a Bell operator who will service requests
for listed numbers within the customer's LATA.  Requests for numbers in LATAs
other than the calling customer's may be handled at the discretion of the local
operating company.  Initially, the Bell Operating Companies will meet the
responsibility for providing directory assistance services by contracting it to
a long distance carrier or carriers (currently AT&T).  All inter-LATA directory
assistance services will be provided by the inter-LATA carrier (IC).  ICs may
also provide 800 Enterprise service or other toll free type directory
assistance services.  See table.

  At first glance, the above table appears somewhat complex.  But, if you
understand the concept of LATAs and carriers, it is easily understood.
Essentially, all local Bell Operating Companies will maintain their own
directory assistance services.  When a customer dials 411 or 555-1212, he will
reach a BOC directory assistant. Additionally, each long distance carrier that
wishes to provide directory assistance to its customers will also have DA
facilities. And, when a customer dials a directory assistant (NPA+555-1212) on
a carrier, he will reach an operator of that particular long distance carrier.
The key here is LATAs.  If a customer wants to find a number that is within his
LATA, no long distance carrier is involved.  It is handled strictly by the
Local Bell Operating Company.  If a customer is seeking a number that is not
within his LATA, he must use the services of an inter-LATA (long-distance)
carrier.

                            ======================
                            TSPS Operator Services
                            ======================

  Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) operator services will be handled much
in the same fashion as directory assistance services, with a few differences.
As with DAs, each Bell Operating Company and each inter-LATA carrier will
maintain its own TSPS operator facilities (or cordboard I suppose, if they
cannot afford TSPS).  When a customer dials simply 0 (operator), he will reach
a BOC TSPS operator.  The BOC TSPS will be able to handle all types of
intra-LATA operator-assisted traffic including (but not limited to): collect,
third party billing, Bell credit card, coin, verification and emergency
interrupt, and requests for emergency aid.  BOC TSPS will be unable to complete
calls for customers outside of the customer's LATA.  Thus, inter-LATA operator
assistance will be handled by an inter-LATA carrier TSPS (IC TSPS).  An IC TSPS
will handle all previously mentioned types of calls that require inter-LATA
transport (i.e., the call originates and terminates in different LATAs).  When
a customer dials 0+NXX-XXXXX or 0+NPA+NXX-XXXX, the central office will
determine if the call is destined for another LATA.  If it is not, the call
will be sent to the Bell TSPS for appropriate handling.  If the call is bound
for another LATA (and his determination is made based on the NXX or NPA+NXX),
then the call will be sent off to the customer's primary long-distance carrier
(since only 0+ was dialed).  If the customer wishes to use a different
carrier's operator services, he would dial 10xxx+0+number, and the carrier
specified by the 10xxx carrier access code would receive the call.  Note: if a
customer dials 10xxx+0+number, and the call is an intra-LATA call, he will get
a recording, "We're sorry, the number you dialed cannot be reached with the
carrier access code you dialed.  Please check the code and try again or call
your carrier for assistance."  (Western Electric KS-22550 central office tape
list no. 46.)  Until the Bell Operating Companies can install their own TSPS
facilities and networks, they will (continue to) lease capacity from AT&T TSPS.
That is, AT&T will handle the intra-LATA traffic for the BOCs on a contract
basis.  In the meantime, AT&T will continue to handle its own long-distance
operator services while the other inter-LATA carriers will have to implement
their own operator networks from scratch.  My estimation is that you won't be
able to dial 10222+0 for an MCI TSPS operator until sometime around the year
2590.  And even then they will probably be cordboard.
  In addition to the changes in TSPS described above, there will be certain

                                    Page 153




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

modifications to the software and hardware involved in the TSPS operator
system.  Most critical, and of paramount importance to the telecommunications
enthusiast is changes in circuit associated signalling (CAS).  This is
signalling to and from the TSPS facility. When a customer dials 0 (operator) or
10xxx+0 (IC operator), a succession of events occurs.  First, the end office
seizes a trunk to the appropriate operator facility (this assumes that no
access tandem is involved).  The operator service facility responds with a wink
(proceed signal) and the end office outpulses the CALLED number (or KP+ST if 0
only dialed).  The operator service (OS) facility will then come off-hook to
signal that it is ready to receive ANI information. The end office outpulses
the ANI information in the format of KP+II+7 digits+ST (or ST').  If there is
ANI failure, a KP+02+ST (or ST') will be sent.  "ST'" stands for STart "prime",
and is indicative of a coin call (i.e., dial 0 from a coin station).  A normal
ST terminating the ANI sequence means that the call is originating from a
noncoin station.  See table for ultimate description.

Note: ST=Start, ST'=STart prime, ST''=Start double prime, ST'''=STart triple
prime.

  Once again, the above table appears somewhat intimidating in its complexity.
All these STs, ST primes, etc.  Actually, the only purpose of the starts is to
distinguish to the TSPS machine exactly what type of call the customer is
placing and from what type of telefone he is calling.  "Special toll" calls are
collect, credit card, and third-party billing type calls.  Here is an example
of a complete dialing and outpulsing sequence for an operator service call:

                                    Page 154




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

from a coin fone, a customer dials 0+ (or 10xxx+) 303+979-9997.  The central
office would seize a trunk to the operator service facility and outpulse:
KP+303+979-9997+ST'.  This indicates to the operator service facility that the
call is a special toll call originating from a coin telephone.  The OS facility
comes off-hook and the central office would then outpulse KP+00+232+9969+ST.
This is he ANI information, and the ST indicates that the call is inter-LATA
(if it were intra-LATA, the sequence would be terminated with ST' instead).
  Perhaps now I should explain screening.  Certain telefones are "screened"
against placing certain types of calls.  A screening code is a two digit
information carrier.  For instance, 00 is "identified line" (no special
treatment), 01 is multiparty ONI (operator number identification), 02 is ANI
failure, 06 is hotel/motel, 07 is coinless (hospital/inmate fone), 08 is
inter-LATA restricted, 68 is hotel inter-LATA restricted, 78 is coinless
(hospital inmate) inter-LATA restricted, etc.  A 98 is an AT&T Charge-A-Call
fone (those blue fuckers).  More screening codes are allocated as they are
needed. Note that the original TSPS screening design only allowed for single
digit information digits.  They were later found to be insufficient.
  I believe that the operator services have been adequately covered, so I will
now move on to other aspects of Equal Access.

                                 =============
                                 Routing Codes
                                 =============

  The TTC (terminating toll centre) and special routing codes will continue to
be used in inter-LATA networks.  These 0xx and 1xx type codes, which sometimes
precede operator routing codes, will be assigned to various ICs on an
individual basis.  When 0xx and 1xx codes serve as pseudo-central office code,
they will be coordinated such that it will avoid IC conflicts.  The
Numbering/Dialing Planning Group of the Central Services Organization (sounds
like some sort of Communist governing body) will provide assistance where the
assignment of coordinated codes is necessary.

                              ==================
                              Special Area Codes
                              ==================

  Special area codes, also called Service Area Codes (SACs) presented the
designers of Equal Access with an interesting problem.  SACs are N00 type area
codes, such as 700, 800, and 900.  They are used for special services and
unlike normal area codes, are not associated with a particular state or region.
Each long distance carrier will be allocated its own exchanges in each service
area code.  Thus, when a customer places a call to a number in a service area
code, the central office will examine the exchange of the telefone number and
route the call over the proper carrier's facilities.  The customer will be
totally oblivious to this process. Current SACs include 700 (teleconferencing),
800 (toll free services), and 900 (dial-it services).  There are currently
plans under way to implement the 600 area code, although its exact uses are not
yet clear.

                               Signalling to IC
                               ================

  Each long distance carrier that wishes to serve a particular LATA must
establish a point of presence (POP) in that LATA.  A carrier's POP is a toll
office that receives toll traffic destined for another LATA.  A POP is a centre
for inter-LATA transport of toll traffic. This traffic will be directed to it

                                    Page 155




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

from a Bell central office, either an end office or an access tandem (AT).  An
access tandem is simply a Bell office which directs long distance traffic from
a number of local end offices to a number of different inter-LATA carriers.  To
pass call details (such as called and calling numbers) from the Bell local
office to the inter-LATA carrier, a signalling system was designed that employs
current multifrequency (MF) signalling protocol.  When a customer dials
10xxx+(1/0)+(NPA)+NXX+, the end office will seize a trunk to the appropriate IC
as determined by the 10xxx CAC (or primary carrier if no CAC is dialed).  Note:
this happens as soon as the customer finishes dialing the exchange, even though
he may still be dialing the last four digits of he telefone number.  After the
end office has seized a trunk to the IC, the IC will return a wink, which is
the signal to proceed.  Then, the end office will send ANI information, in the
format of: KP+II+10 digit ANI+ST.  If the carrier is not to receive ANI
information from the Bell Operating Company (i.e., they are not paying for it),
then only KP+ST is sent. Presumably, by now the customer has completed dialing
the last four digits of the destination telefone number, so the end office will
send: KP+7 or 10 digit CALLED number+ST.  Note several things here: 1) The IC
does not send a wink when it is ready to receive CALLED number information.  2)
ANI information is ten digits, plus a two-digit screening code, and 3) The
central office's outpulsing to the IC overlaps the customer's dialing.
  Some ANI screening codes include: 00 (identified POTS), 01 (ONI multiparty),
02 (ANI failure), 06 (hotel without room identification), 07 (coinless,
hospital, inmate, etc.), 08 (inter-LATA restriction), 10 (test call), 20 (AIOD
calls, listed DN sent), 27 (coin call), and 95 (test call).  These are the same
or similar as the screening codes used in operator service signalling.
  In addition to the domestic signalling design outlined above, a new
international signalling system has been designed for use with Equal Access.
It also uses two-stage, overlapping outpulsing.  After a customer has completed
dialing (10xxx)+011+CC (CC is country code), the Bell end office will seize a
trunk to he appropriate IC (or international carrier, if direct routing is
available).  The IC/INC will respond with a wink, and the end office will
outpulse: KP+1NX+YXX+CCC+ST.  Each of these three groups of routing information
indicate something different abut the international call being placed. The 1NX
is the "international system routing code, one for each type of call routing."
I have absolutely no idea what that means, and no one I have talked to at Bell,
AT&T, MCI, CCITT, ITT, the CSO and FCC have any idea either.  Next, the YXX is
the carrier routing code.  It is actually XXX, Which is the three digits of the
10xxx CAC for the particular carrier being accessed.  Finally, CCC is the
country code, padded with a zero if necessary.
  One may wonder why the CAC is signalled forward when a trunk is seized
directly to the carrier itself.  The reason for this is that in some cases a
direct trunk to the carrier is not available and the call must be routed
through an access tandem, which is responsible for routing calls to a variety
of different long distance carriers.

                             ====================
                             Switch Compatibility
                             ====================

  Full-feature Equal Access will become available first for Western Electric
#1ESS switching systems.  It will be available first in generic 1E8 (1AE8 for
#1A ESS).  Later, generic 5E2 for #5ESS, generic 2B4 for #2B ESS, generic
BCS-16 for Northern Telecom DMS-100, and generics 209 and 302 for DMS-10 will
provide full-feature Equal Access capabilities in those types of end office
switching equipment.  The Western Electric #4ESS, #1 and 1A ESS, #5ESS, and the
Northern Telecom DMS-200 machines which serve as toll offices or access tandems

                                     =====

  LATAs, Local Access and Transport Areas, are the entire key to the
administration of Equal Access.  They can be thought of as miniature area
codes.  A telefone call can never cross a LATA boundary except on an inter-LATA
carrier.  However, there are certain exceptions to this. For example, in the
state of Colorado, which consists of two LATAs, the local Bell Operating
Company (Mountain Bell), which serves as the intra-LATA (i.e., calls to/from
the same LATA) carrier, may also serve as inter-LATA (to/from different LATAs)
carrier within Colorado.
  There are also exceptions in the corridor region of the New York/New
Jersey/Pennsylvania area.
  The forty-eight continental United States consist of 161 LATAs. Some states,
such as Deleware, consist of only one LATA, while others, such as Illinois, can
have up to 14 or more.  Each LATA is given a name.  For instance, Pennsylvania
consists of six LATAs: Philadelphia, Capital, Northeast, Altoona, Pittsburgh,
and Erie (independent telco).

                                ==============

  In 1973, Chrysler, A&P, RCA, Phillips Petroleum, S.S. Kresge, Boeing
Aircraft, International Harvester, Woolworth's, Greyhound, Firestone, Litton,
and General Foods, among others, each reported annual profits of less than $150
million.  In that same year, the Telephone Company wrote off, as being
uncollectable, debts of $150 million.
  In 1974, the Bell System had direct interests in at least 276 organizations,
many of them not related to the telefone industry. Bell also had interlocking
financial arrangements with such corporations as the Chase Manhattan Bank, IBM,
Prudential Insurance, Sears Roebuck, General Motors, U.S. Steel, and Lever
Brothers.  Should the need have arisen, the Bell System in 1974 could have
exercised control of 400 billion dollars, fully one-third of that year's gross
national product.

  There are many viewpoints as to the future course of the telefone industry.
The general consensus among most Telco employees is that the children of AT&T
(i.e., the seven regional holding companies into which the Bell System was
divided) will someday be reassembled into the original Bell System, and all
will be well and good in the world of telecommunications again.  I tend to
disagree with this.  I think that within three decades the entire telefone
industry will be consolidated and nationalized.  It will be owned and operated
entirely by the United States Federal Government.  This will accomplish several
goals of the government.  First, the immense revenue from telefone services
will provide great financial resources for the federal government.  Rates for
telefone services will skyrocket far out of the range of affordability, quality
of service will deteriorate to a point of unusability, and meanwhile
politicians will get rich.
  Second, once the government controls the telefone system, monitoring the
general public will become infinitely easier.  Big Brother will be able to keep
and eye, or rather, an ear on the general population, and giant step forward in

ultimate government control of peoples' lives will be achieved.  Most people
won't know anything about this, and even if they do, they won't give a shit
because by then the fucking government will have already invaded every
remaining private aspect of the individual's life.
  To those who find it utterly unthinkable that the federal government would
ever assume control of the telefone industry, I would call attention to the
situation that existed between 1917 and 1919.  During this time the government
controlled the phone system of the United States.  J. Edward Hyde sums it up
beautifully:

     Between 1917 and 1919, the Federal Government did control the phone
industry.  Since then, the most charitable historians have blamed the
subsequent mess on the First World War.  Others blame it on the democrats.  But
the fact is that it was a fiasco of the bureaucracy's own making, combined with
intracompany sabotage.
     Today, in those countries where the phone service is nationally owned, the
service runs from poor to nonexistent.  Would you want the government that gave
you the Russian wheat deals, Defense Department     overruns, Amtrak, and the
Postal Service handling your phone problems?

               Equal Access and Modem Autodialers by Shadow 2600

    Now that AT&T is being divested of its local telephone companies, phone
customers across the nation have to choose their long distance carrier as equal
access is phased in.  Advertising campaigns emphasize such aspects as low rates
and operator assistance, but no one mentions a factor that will affect modem
users who use auto dialers for long distance calls.  Not all of the alternate
long distance carriers provide called party answering supervision on all calls.
Called party answering supervision basically has the telephone company start
billing only when the called party answers the telephone.  However, many of the
alternate long distance companies still operate with the "fixed timeout" basis
for charging.  That is, if a call is held for a fixed length of time (usually
30 seconds) the charging starts, whether or not the call was answered.  This
could cause modem owners large bills if they use autodialers to make long
distance calls.  Modems are usually set up to wait up to one minute when
attempting to make a call, and thus have to timeout through busy signals, long
call setup sequences, extender waits, and similar problems.  This could result
in many billed but never answered calls.

    Some of the other carriers provide it on calls to some cities, and others
not support it at all.  Only AT&T Communications provides called party
answering supervision on all calls to all points at this time.  It is almost
impossible to get information on how a long distance company charges its calls
as as they don't want to reveal how their billing is handled.  The alternate
carriers get called party supervision when the destination location goes equal
access.  However, there has been no quick action on the part of the alternate
long distance companies to make use of the supervision data as they would have
to get equipment for passing the information back to the billing computer at
the originating point.  Thus called party answering supervision information
often ends up being ignored by these carriers even when available.  Another
point to remember is that called party answering supervision's availability
depends on whether the destination has equal access, not the originating
location.  The lower long distance rates of alternate long distance rates must
be weighed against the time out problem as it affects autodialing modems.  One
way to circumvent this is merely to set your modem to a shorter
waiting-for-connect time, but this may not provide enough time for the call to
go through.  [For more information on this and other telecommunications topics

                Toward Universal Information Services Via ISDN
                ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~
                                 by Taran King

                From PROTO newsletter of AT&T Bell Laboratories
         ------------------------------------------------------------
Phase one, the Present.
~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~
  The local network of today, although still largely voice-oriented, is already
on the path to Universal Information Services.  Lightguide fiber is
dramatically expanding the capacity of local networks, helping to lower the
costs and increase the demand for high-band width, Information Age services.
And public networks are increasingly digital and geared for data and special
 services.  For example:

o   The AT&T Network Systems 5ESS (TM <riiiight>) switch, designed by Bell
Laboratories, can serve as the hub of a local deployment of remote modules at
locations up to 100 miles from a host central office.

o   The Integrated Special Services Network (ISSN) is a channel network that
provides special services, customer control options and digital private lines
rearrangeable under software control. The ISSN incorporates digital carrier
terminating equipment such as the D4 Channel Bank, D5 Digital Terminal System
and Digital Access and Cross-connect System (DACS).

o   The New Centrex is bringing greater levels of customer control, improved
services and a broad range of data capabilities to the business customer.

   Today's public networks consist of multiple or overlay networks. The public
switched network, or circuit network, mainly for voice, is the base network.
Two kinds of overlay networks provide special services.  Channel networks carry
private lines leased by large customers and transmit much of today's data and
image traffic; they also handle traffic for network operations support.  Packet
networks carry data communications, while packet switching is used internally
to public networks for common channel signaling to set up, route and take down
calls, or to give customers information. "Overlay networks help
telecommunications companies efficiently meet growing demand for digital
transmission and special services," says Stan Johnston, Market Planning
Manager, Network Systems Evolution, in AT&T Network Systems. "Their integration
into a single network, however, would be still more effective."

Phase two, the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
  The ISDN is a concept to which AT&T is committed - and it's the foundation
for Universal Information Services.  The central idea of ISDN, as AT&T Network
Systems sees it, is to provide an individual user a link to the local central
office of generous band-width - a digital subscriber line that can carry
144,000 bits per second (sure beats 2400 baud!).  The band-width is subdivided
into two 64,000-bit channels, which may carry voice or data or both, and one
16,000-bit channel for packetized signaling information or data transport.
Such a link provides convenient "integrated" network access by accommodating
voice, data and signaling over a single line.
  The ISDN will make it easier for a customer to get varied services from
public and private networks.  More bandwidth for big customers will be
available through another ISDN access standard, the extended digital subscriber

                                    Page 161




                        The Official Phreaker's Manual

line, which provides 1.5 billion bits per second as 24 channels of 64,000 bits
each.
   In 1986, new software from Bell Labs will enable the 5ESS switch to
accommodate ISDN-sized 144,000-bit channels that standardize and simplify
subscribers' use of local networks.  AT&T is committed to future products that
will also be ISDN-compatible.  Other vendors, too, some of whom already plan to
build premises, terminal, and other equipment to ISDN standards, will make ISDN
a cooperative effort.
   By providing integrated digital access to networks, ISDN will make important
progress toward the goal of Universal Information Services. But overlay
networks will continue to divvy up the transport job.  And messages needing
less than 144,000 bits per second will not fill their allotted bandwidth,
leaving capacity under utilized.

Phase three, Universal Information Services.
~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
   Rooted in the fertile ground of 5ESS switches, ISDN equipment and
technologies such as wideband packet transport, Universal Information Services
will bear fruit during the 1990s.  From a single kind of network will hang
services as different as apples, oranges and pears. Just as network access was
integrated in ISDN, transport functions will increasingly be integrated by
powerful new network equipment evolved from equipment developed for the ISDN.
Where customers once got standard-sized ISDN channels, they'll get big
bandwidth for large jobs, little bandwidth for small jobs.

MCI Communications Corporation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., provides a
full range of domestic and international telecommunications services, including
voice and data, telex and cable, paging and mobile telephone, and time
sensitive message delivery.

Since its founding in 1968, MCI has grown to more than $1.6 billion in annual
sales and serves more than 1.9 million business, residential and government
customers through its four major business units:

MCI Telecommunications

MCI Airsignal

MCI International

MCI Digital Information Services


MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS

   MCI Telecommunications provides domestic interstate long distance service
throughout all 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and major
calling areas of Canada.  It is also authorized to provide varying degrees of
intrastate long distance service in some states.

MCI also is the first long distance carrier other than AT&T to offer direct
dial service overseas.  International telephone service is available to all
residential and commercial customers (with the exception of Private Line
customers).  In October, 1984 the first international service agreements were
announced with the following countries:  Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, East
Germany, Greece, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Total capital investment in MCI's long distance network is approximately $2
billion.  MCI's network, the second largest in the U.S., employs microwave
optical fiber, satellite and various digital transmission technologies.

figures, coded messages).  Memory and recall capability.  Alerts customer to
message with a silent visual alert or a soft tone.

TONE MESSAGE SERVICE

Notifies customer of a message with a soft tone.

VOICE MESSAGE SERVICE

Receives message in actual voice of caller.

EXPRESS MESSAGE SERVICE

Receives and stores messages.  Instantly alerts subscriber via pager when a
message is received.

Car Telephone Service

Enables customers to place calls to or receive calls from anywhere in the

MCI INTERNATIONAL

MCI International provides private-line voice service to several overseas
countries, and data and message services, including telex, cablegram, leased
channel, and packet switching communications, to more than 200 overseas points.
MCI has moved into two new areas of service:  International direct-dial
telephone service and international electronic mail and hard-copy delivery
services.

International Record Services

TELEX SERVICE   (domestic and international) permits instantaneous, two-way,
written communications with other subscribers worldwide.  Customers can send
messages at any time, even though the receiving terminal may be unattended. MCI
International offers access to its telex service from a variety of terminals
and networks; not only subscribers with telex terminals but also those with
communicating word processors, data terminals or computers that communicate
over telephone lines can take advantage of MCI International telex service.  To
subscribers connected to its own telex network, MCI International offers World
Message Services--a package of communications offerings including telex,
cablegram and MCI Mail services.  Various service enhancements are available to
save time, improve operating efficiency and simplify records keeping for telex
users.

CABLEGRAM SERVICE, the traditional means of international written
communications, offers flexibility in delivery and economical rates for shorter
messages.  Cablegrams can be delivered to virtually any overseas
point.Subscribers with telex terminals or various other types of equipment can
access and TELUS cablegram switch and take advantage of such service

enhancements as abbreviated addressing and departmental billing.

LEASED
CHANNEL SERVICE  provides an exclusive line between a U.S. firm and it's
overseas office for private communications 24 hours a day.  Each MCI
International leased channel is tailored to meet the needs of a specific
customer for teleprinter, facsimile, voice and/or data traffic. For subscribers
with several offices requiring private communications with each other, MCI
International offers a versatile message-switching service. Voice/data leases
can be configured to meet a whole array of communicating needs; for example,
one channel might carry data traffic from a computer at night, voice
communications during office hours, and simultaneous teleprinter messages at
any time.  Data channels can handle requirements for traffic at any speed from
1200 bits per second to 1.544 megabits per second.

IMPACS SERVICE   uses packet-switching technology to provide international
communications service between data terminals and computers.  Impacs offers
on-line, real-time connections and enables many types of incompatible systems
to communicate.  Impacs service offers virtually error-free transmission
because of the error-detection and retransmission capability of the network.

INSTALINK SERVICE allows businesses overseas to use regular telex equipment to
access remote computing systems and databases in the U.S.  Subscribers can
retrieve data from a computer-based information service or use a computing
system connecting to a packet-switching network in the U.S.

INTERNATIONAL
FACSIMILE SERVICE enables subscribers to send duplicates of original documents
overseas quickly and efficiently, even when neither the sender or the receiver
has facsimile transmission equipment, or when the sender and receiver have
incompatible equipment.

DATEL SERVICE  provides automatic or voice-coordinated data transmission at
speeds up to 2400 bits per second. Either digital or analog facsimile traffic
can be transmitted via Datel.  Datel facilities are conditioned to ensure
high-quality transmission.  The MCI International switching center allows
communications between incompatible terminals.

MARITIME SERVICES   provide instant, high--quality contact between ships at sea
or offshore rigs, and between these vessels and land-based subscribers
worldwide.

International Voice Services

PRIVATE
LINE SERVICE   provides, fast, easy access to a single overseas location at an
economical monthly rate.  This technically efficient system maximizes the use
of line capacity by recognizing idle time and assigning a speaker to a
transmission path only when the path is needed.  Users can dial a four-digit
extension from a regular business phone to reach a key overseas location.

International Mail Services

WORLD
MESSAGE SERVICE   subscribers can access the domestic electronic mail and
hard-copy delivery offerings of MCI Mail.  In addition, MCI International is
developing fast, low-cost services that will deliver electronic messages and
high-quality printed documents worldwide.

                           THE INFINITY TRANSMITTER

                            TYPED BY THE GHOST WIND

                         FROM THE BOOK BUILD YOUR OWN
         LASER, PHASER, ION RAY GUN & OTHER WORKING SPACE-AGE PROJECTS
                       BY ROBERT IANNINI (TAB BOOKS INC)

Description:  Briefly, the Infinity Transmitter is a device which activates a
microphone via a phone call.  It is plugged into the phone line, and when the
phone rings, it  will immediately intercept the ring and broadcast into the
phone any sound that is in the room. This device was originally made by
Information Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did not
know the code from being able to use the phone in its normal way.  This
version, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it is
in operation.
NOTE:  It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is also
pretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.
Parts List:
Pretend that uF means micro Farad, cap= capacitor

Circuit Operation: Not being the most technical guy in the world, and not being
very good at electronics (yet),  I'm just repeating what Mr. Iannini's said
about the circuit operation.  The Transmitter consists of a high grain
amplifier fed into the telephone lines via transformer.  The circuit is
initiated by the action  of  a voltage transient pulse occurring across  the
phone line  at the instant the telephone circuit is made (the ring,  in other
words).  This transient immediately triggers a timer  whose output  pin  3 goes
positive, turning on transistors Q2 and  Q3. Timer TM1 now remains in this
state for a period depending on the values  of R17 and C13 (usually about 10
seconds for  the  values shown). When Q3 is turned on by the timer, a simulated
"off hook" condition is created by the switching action of Q3 connecting the
500  ohm  winding  of the transformer directly across  the  phone lines.
Simultaneously, Q2 clamps the ground of A1, amplifier, and Q1, output
transistor, to the negative return of B1,B2, therefore enabling this amplifier
section.  Note that B2 is always required by  supplying  quiescent power to TM1
during  normal conditions. System is off/on controlled by S1 (switch).
  A  crystal mike picks up the sounds that are fed to  the  first two
transistors of the A1 array connected as an emitter follower driving the
remaining  two  transistors  as  cascaded   common emitters. Output of the
array now drives Q1 capacitively coupled to  the  1500 ohm  winding of  T1.
R7  controls  the  pick  up sensitivity of the system.
  Diode  D1  is  forward biased at the instant of  connection  and essentially
applies a negative pulse at pin 2 of TM1,  initiating the cycle.   D2 clamps
any high positive pulses.   C9 dc-isolates and desensitizes the circuit. The
system described should operate when any incoming call is made without ringing
the phone.

Schematic Diagram:  Because this is text,  this doesn't look  too hot. Please
use  a little imagination!  I will hopefully get  a graphics drawing  of  this
out as soon as I  can  on  a  Fontrix graffile.

To be able to see what everything is, this character: | should appear as a
horizontal bar. I did this on a ][e using a ][e 80 column card, so I'm sorry if
it looks kinda weird to you.

Construction notes: Because the damned book just gave a picture instead of step
by step instructions, and I'll try to give you as much help as possible. Note
that all the parts that you will be using are clearly labeled in the schematic.
The perfboard, knobs, 'gator clips, etc are optional. I do strongly suggest
that you do use the board!!! It will make wiring the components up much much
easier than if you don't use it.
 The knob you can use to control the pot (R7). R7 is used to tune the IT so
that is sounds ok over the phone. (You get to determine what sounds good) By
changing the value of C13, you can change the amount of time that the circuit
will stay open (it cannot detect a hang up, so it works on a timer.) A value of
100 micro Farads will increase the time by about 10 times.
 The switch (S1) determines whether or not the unit is operational. Closed is
on. Open is off. The negative return is the negative terminals of the battery!!
The batteries will look something like this when hooked up:

 To hook this up to the phone line, there are three ways, depending upon what
type of jack you have. If it is the old type (non modular) then you can just
open up the wall plate and connect the wires from the transmitter directly to
the terminals of the phone.
 If you have a modular jack with four prongs, attach the red to the negative
prong (don't ask me which is which! I don't have that type of jack... I've only
seen them in stores), and the green to the positive prong, and plug in. Try not
to shock yourself...
 If you have the clip-in type jack, get double male extension cord (one with a
clip on each end), and chop off one clip. Get a sharp knife and splice off the
grey protective material. You should see four wires, including one green and
one red. You attach the appropriate wires from the IT to these two, and plug
the other end into the wall.

Getting the IT to work: If you happen to have a problem, you should attempt to
do the following (these are common sense rules!!) Make sure that you have the
polarity of all the capacitors right (if you used polarized capacitors, that
is). Make sure that all the soldering is done well and has not short circuited
something accidently (like if you have a glob touching two wires which should
not be touching.) Check for other short circuits. Check to see if the battery
is in right. Check to make sure the switch is closed.
 If it still doesn't work, drop me a line on one of the Maryland or Virginia
BBSs and I'll try to help you out.

The sense output: Somehow or other, it is possible to hook something else up to
this and activate it by phone (like an alarm, flashing lights, etc.)

As of this writing, I have not tried to make one of these, but I will. If you
actually get it working, leave me a note somewhere.

I sure hope all you people appreciate this.

PARTS & EQUIPMENT:
(1) POCKET TONE DIALER  (RADIO SHACK CAT. NO. 43-138)
(2) SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW SWITCH  (TOGGLE, THE SMALLER THE BETTER)
(3) SOLDERING IRON

     THIS MODIFICATION WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF A,B,C,&D TONES. WHEN YOU
FLIP THE SWITCH THE 3,6,9,&# KEYS WILL BECOME A,B,C,&D RESPECTIVELY.  THE IC
INSIDE THE DIALER IS CAPABLE OF MAKING THESE TONES ALREADY, ALL WE MUST DO IS
CONNECT IT FULLY.  THIS MOD CAN ALSO BE MADE TO MANY ELECTRONIC FONES THAT
CONTAIN A DTMF TONE ENCODING IC. THIS CHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE NUMBER 5089
OR S2559 OR MK5380 OR TCM5087N.  PIN 9 OF THESE CHIPS IS THE FOURTH COLUMN
KEYPAD INPUT WHILE PIN 5 IS THE THIRD COLUMN.  NOW ON WITH THE CONSTRUCTION.

1)    REMOVE THE BATTERY COVER, BATTERIES, AND THE SMALL SCREW. THE CASE SHOULD
NOW POP OPEN WITH A LITTLE PRESSURE.
2)    OPEN THE CASE SO THAT THE HALF CONTAINING THE SPEAKER AND THE BATTERIES
IS ON YOUR LEFT WITH THE BATTERIES ON THE BOTTOM. YOU SHOULD NOW BE LOOKING AT
THE BACK OF 2 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS.
3)  FIND THE TWO ROWS OF SOLDER BEADS WHERE THE IC IS CONNECTED.  THE UPPER
LEFT PIN OF THE 2 ROWS SHOULD HAVE NO SOLDER ON IT. THIS IS PIN 9 OF THE IC.
4)  ATTACH A SHORT WIRE TO PIN 9.
5)  SEE THE 8 GOLD WIRES GOING TO THE KEY PAD?  UNSOLDER THE ONE 4TH FROM THE
LEFT AND CONNECT IT TO A SHORT WIRE.
6)  SOLDER A SHORT WIRE INTO THE NOW VACANT HOLE IN THE KEYPAD PCB.
7)  MELT OR DRILL A ROUND HOLE IN THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THE SWITCH. THE BEST
PLACE FOR THIS IS OPPOSITE THE SMALL PCB CONTAINING THE L.E.D.
8)  INSERT THE SWITCH AND SCREW IT IN PLACE.
9)  ATTACH THE WIRE FROM THE KEYPAD PCB TO THE CENTER OF THE SWITCH. ATTACH THE
OTHER TWO WIRES TO THE OTHER TWO POLES OF THE SWITCH. JUST CLOSE THE CASE, PUT
BACK IN THE SCREW AND BATTERIES.

THE SWITCH WILL NOW ALLOW THE  3RD COLUMN KEYS TO PRODUCE BOTH 3RD AND FOURTH
COLUMN TONES.  HAVE PHUN
