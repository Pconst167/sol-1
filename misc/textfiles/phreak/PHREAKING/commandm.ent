  THE PHONE PHREAK'S TEN COMMANDMENTS
 
   I.  BOX THOU NOT OVER THINE HOME
       TELEPHONE WIRES, FOR THOSE  WHO
       DOEST MUST SURELY BRING THE
       WRATH OF THE CHIEF SPECIAL 
       AGENT DOWN UPON THY HEADS.
 
  II.  SPEAKEST THOU NOT OF IMPORTANT
       MATTERS OVER THINE HOME TEL-
       EPHONE WIRES, FOR TO DO SO IS TO
       RISK THINE RIGHT OF FREEDOM.
 
 III.  USE NOT THINE OWN NAME WHEN 
       SPEAKING TO OTHER PHREAKS, FOR
       THAT EVERY THIRD PHREAK IS AN
       FBI AGENT IS WELL KNOWN.
 
  IV.  LET NOT OVERLY MANY PEOPLE KNOW
       THAT THY BE A PHREAK, AS TO DO
       SO IS TO USE THINE OWN SELF AS
       A SACRIFICIAL LAMB.
 
   V.  IF THOU BE IN SCHOOL, STRIVE TO
       GET THINE SELF GOOD GRADES, FOR
       THE AUTHORITIES WELL KNOW THAT
       SCHOLARS NEVER BREAK THE LAW.
 
  VI.  IF THOU WORKEST, TRY TO BE A 
       EMPLOYEE, AND IMPRESSEST THINE
       BOSS WITH THINE ENTHUSIASM, FOR
       IMPORTANT EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN
       SAVED BY THEIR OWN BOSSES.
 
 VII.  STOREST THOU NOT THINE STOLEN
       GOODES IN THINE OWN HOME, FOR
       THOSE WHO DO ARE SURELY NON-
       BELIEVERS IN THE BELL SYSTEM
       SECURITY FORCES, AND ARE NOT
       LONG FOR THIS WORLD.
 
VIII.  ATTRACTEST THOU NOT THE ATT-
       ENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES, AS
       THE LESS NOTICABLE THOU ART, THE
       BETTER.
 
  IX.  MAKEST SURE THINE FRIENDS ARE 
       INSTANT AMNESIACS AND WILL NOT
       REMEMBER THAT THOU HAVE CALLED
       ILLEGALLY, FOR THEIR COOPERATION
       WITH THE AUTHORITIES WILL SURELY
       LESSEN THINE TIME FOR FREEDOM ON
       THIS EARTH.
 
   X.  SUPPORTEST THOU TAP, AS IT IS
       THINE NEWSLETTER, AND WITHOUT
       IT, THY WORK WILL BE FAR MORE
       LIMITED.
