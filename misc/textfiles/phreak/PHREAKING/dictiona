    THE LONG AWAITED PREQUIL TO PHREAKER'S GUIDE HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.
CONCEIVED FROM THE BOREDOM AND LONELINESS THAT COULD ONLY BE DERIVED FROM:
THE TRAVELER!  BUT NOW, HE HAS RETURNED IN FULL STRENGTH (AFTER A SMALL
VACATION) AND IS HERE TO 'WORLD PREMIERE' THE NEW FILES EVERYWHERE. STAY
COOL. THIS IS THE PREQUIL TO THE FIRST ONE, SO JUST RELAX. THIS IS NOT MADE
TO BE AN EXCLUSIVE ULTRA ELITE FILE, SO KINDA CALM DOWN AND WATCH IN THE
BACKGROUND IF YOU ARE TOO COOL FOR IT.

/-/   PHREAK DICTIONARY   /-/

     HERE YOU WILL FIND SOME OF THE BASIC BUT NECESSARY TERMS THAT SHOULD BE

KNOWN BY ANY PHREAK WHO WANTS TO BE RESPECTED AT ALL.

    PHREAK  : 1. THE ACTION OF USING MISCHEVIOUS AND MOSTLY ILLEGAL
                 WAYS IN ORDER TO NOT PAY FOR SOME SORT OF TELE-
                 COMMUNICATIONS BILL, ORDER, TRANSFER, OR OTHER SERVICE.
                 IT OFTEN INVOLVES USAGE OF HIGHLY ILLEGAL BOXES AND
                 MACHINES IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE SECURITY THAT IS SET
                 UP TO AVOID THIS SORT OF HAPPENING. [FR'EAKING]. V.

              2. A PERSON WHO USES THE ABOVE METHODS OF DESTRUCTION AND
                 CHAOS IN ORDER TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL.  A TRUE
                 PHREAKER WILL NOT NOT GO AGAINST HIS FELLOWS OR NARC
                 ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE RAGGED ON HIM OR DO ANYTHING
                 TERMED TO BE DISHONORABLE TO PHREAKS. [FR'EEK]. N.

              3. A CERTAIN CODE OR DIALUP USEFUL IN THE ACTION OF
                 BEING A PHREAK. (EXAMPLE: "I HACKED A NEW METRO
                 PHREAK LAST NIGHT.")

 SWITCHING SYSTEM: 1. THERE ARE 3 MAIN SWITCHING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED
                      IN THE US, AND A FEW OTHER SYSTEMS WILL BE MENTIONED
                      AS BACKGROUND.

               A) SXS: THIS SYSTEM WAS INVENTED IN 1918 AND WAS
                  EMPLOYED IN OVER HALF OF THE COUNTRY UNTIL 1978. IT
                  IS A VERY BASIC SYSTEM THAT IS A GENERAL WASTE OF
                  ENERGY AND HARD WORK ON THE LINESMAN. A GOOD WAY TO
                  IDENTIFY THIS IS THAT IT REQUIRES A COIN IN THE PHONE
                  BOOTH BEFORE IT WILL GIVE YOU A DIAL TONE, OR THAT NO
                  CALL WAITING, CALL FORWARDING, OR ANY OTHER SUCH
                  SERVICE IS AVAILABLE.  STANDS FOR: STEP BY STEP

               B) XB: THIS SWITCHING SYSTEM WAS FIRST EMPLOYED IN 1978
                  IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF MOST OF THE FAULTS OF SXS
                  SWITCHING.  NOT ONLY IS IT MORE EFFICIENT, BUT IT
                  ALSO CAN SUPPORT DIFFERENT SERVICES IN VARIOUS FORMS.
                  XB1 IS CROSSBAR VERSION 1. THAT IS VERY LIMITED AND
                  IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH FROM SXS EXCEPT BY DIRECT VIEW
                  OF THE WIRING INVOLVED. NEXT UP WAS XB4, CROSSBAR
                  VERSION 4. WITH THIS SYSTEM, SOME OF THE BASIC THINGS
                  LIKE DTMF THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE WITH SXS CAN BE
                  ACCOMPLISHED. FOR THE FINAL STROKE OF XB, XB5 WAS
                  CREATED. THIS IS A SERVICE THAT CAN ALLOW DTMF PLUS
                  MOST 800 TYPE SERVICES (WHICH WERE NOT ALWAYS
                  AVAILABLE.) STANDS FOR: CROSSBAR.

               C) ESS: A NIGHTMARE IN TELECOM. IN VIVID COLOR, ESS IS
                  A PRETTY BAD THING TO HAVE TO STAND UP TO. IT IS
                  QUITE SIMPLE TO IDENTIFY. DIALING 911 FOR EMERGENCIES,
                  AND ANI [SEE ANI BELOW] ARE THE MOST COMMON FACETS OF
                  THE DREAD SYSTEM. ESS HAS THE CAPABILITY TO LIST IN A
                  PERSON'S CALLER LOG WHAT NUMBER WAS CALLED, HOW LONG
                  THE CALL TOOK, AND EVEN THE STATUS OF THE CONVERSATION
                  (MODEM OR OTHERWISE.) SINCE ESS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED,
                  WHICH HAS BEEN VERY RECENTLY, IT HAS GONE THROUGH
                  MANY KINDS OF REVISIONS. THE LATEST SYSTEM TO DATE IS
                  ESS 11A, THAT IS EMPLOYED IN WASHINGTON D.C. FOR
                  SECURITY REASONS. ESS IS TRULY TROUBLE FOR ANY
                  PHREAK, BECAUSE IT IS 'SMARTER' THAN THE OTHER
                  SYSTEMS. FOR INSTANCE, IF ON YOUR CALLER LOG THEY SAW
                  50 CALLS TO 1-800-421-9438, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO
                  A CN/A [SEE LOOPHOLES BELOW] ON YOUR NUMBER AND
                  DETERMINE WHETHER YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED TO THAT SERVICE
                  OR NOT. THIS MAKES MOST CALLS A HAZARD, BECAUSE
                  ALTHOUGH 800 NUMBERS APPEAR TO BE FREE, THEY ARE
                  RECORDED ON YOUR CALLER LOG AND THEN RIGHT BEFORE YOU
                  RECEIVE YOUR BILL IT DELETES THE BILLINGS FOR THEM.
                  BUT BEFORE THAT THE ARE OPEN TO INSPECTION, WHICH IS
                  ONE REASON WHY EXTENDED USE OF ANY CODE IS DANGEROUS
                  UNDER ESS. SOME OF THE BOXES [SEE BOXING BELOW] ARE
                  UNABLE TO FUNCTION IN ESS.  IT IS GENERALLY A MENACE
                  TO THE TRUE PHREAK. STANDS FOR: ELECTRONIC SWITCHING
                  SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY COULD APPEAR ON A FILTER
                  SOMEWHERE OR MAYBE IT IS JUST NICE TO KNOW THEM
                  ANYWAYS.

                  A) SSS: STROWGER SWITCHING SYSTEM. FIRST
                     NON-OPERATOR SYSTEM AVAILABLE.

                  B) WES: WESTERN ELECTRONICS SWITCHING. USED ABOUT 40
                     YEARS AGO WITH SOME MINOR PLACES OUT WEST.

       BOXING:  1) THE USE OF PERSONALLY DESIGNED BOXES THAT EMIT OR
                   CANCEL ELECTRONICAL IMPULSES THAT ALLOW SIMPLER
                   ACTING WHILE PHREAKING. THROUGH THE USE OF SEPARATE
                   BOXES, YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH MOST FEATS POSSIBLE WITH
                   OR WITHOUT THE CONTROL OF AN OPERATOR.

                2) SOME BOXES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE LISTED BELOW.
                   ONES MARKED WITH '*' INDICATE THAT THEY ARE NOT
                   OPERATABLE IN ESS.

                 *BLACK BOX: MAKES IT SEEM TO THE PHONE COMPANY THAT
                             THE PHONE WAS NEVER PICKED UP.

                 BLUE BOX  : EMITS A 2600HZ TONE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO
                             SUCH THINGS AS STACK A TRUNK LINE, KICK
                             THE OPERATOR OFF LINE, AND OTHERS.

                 RED BOX : SIMULATES THE NOISE OF A QUARTER, NICKEL,
                           OR DIME BEING DROPPED INTO A PAYPHONE.

                 CHEESE BOX : TURNS YOUR HOME PHONE INTO A PAY PHONE TO
                              THROW OFF TRACES (A RED BOX IS USUALLY
                              NEEDED IN ORDER TO CALL OUT.)

                *CLEAR BOX : GIVES YOU A DIAL TONE ON SOME OF THE OLD
                             SXS PAYPHONES WITHOUT PUTTING IN A COIN.

                 BEIGE BOX : A SIMPLER PRODUCED LINESMAN'S HANDSET THAT
                             ALLOWS YOU TO TAP INTO PHONE LINES AND
                             EXTRACT BY EAVESDROPPING, OR CROSSING
                             WIRES, ETC.

                 PURPLE BOX : MAKES ALL CALLS MADE OUT FROM YOUR HOUSE
                              SEEM TO BE LOCAL CALLS.

     ANI [ANI]: 1) AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION. A SERVICE
                   AVAILABLE ON ESS THAT ALLOWS A PHONE SERVICE [SEE
                   DIALUPS BELOW] TO RECORD THE NUMBER THAT ANY CERTAIN
                   CODE WAS DIALED FROM ALONG WITH THE NUMBER THAT WAS
                   CALLED AND PRINT BOTH OF THESE ON THE CUSTOMER BILL.
                   950 DIALUPS [SEE DIALUPS BELOW] ARE ALL DESIGNED
                   JUST TO USE ANI. SOME OF THE SERVICES DO NOT HAVE
                   THE PROPER EQUIPMENT TO READ THE ANI IMPULSES YET,
                   BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHICH IS WHICH WITHOUT
                   BEING BUSTED OR NOT BUSTED FIRST.

 DIALUPS [DY'L'UPS]: 1) ANY LOCAL OR 800 EXTENDED OUTLET THAT ALLOWS INSTANT
                        ACCESS TO ANY SERVICE SUCH AS MCI, SPRINT, OR AT&T
                        THAT FROM THERE CAN BE USED BY HANDPICKING OR USING
                        A PROGRAM TO REVEAL OTHER PEOPLES CODES WHICH CAN
                        THEN BE USED MODERATELY UNTIL THEY FIND OUT ABOUT
                        IT AND YOU MUST SWITCH TO ANOTHER CODE (PREFERRABLY
                        BEFORE THEY FIND OUT ABOUT IT.)

                2) DIALUPS ARE EXTREMELY COMMON ON BOTH SENSES. SOME
                   DIALUPS REVEAL THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THEM AS
                   SOON AS YOU HEAR THE TONE. OTHERS ARE MUCH HARDER
                   AND SOME YOU MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY.  A SMALL
                   LIST OF DIALUPS:

                      1-800-421-9438 (5 DIGIT CODES)
                      1-800-547-6754 (6 DIGIT CODES)
                      1-800-345-0008 (6 DIGIT CODES)
                      1-800-734-3478 (6 DIGIT CODES)
                      1-800-222-2255 (5 DIGIT CODES)

                3) CODES: CODES ARE VERY EASILY ACCESSED PROCEDURES
                   WHEN YOU CALL A DIALUP. THEY WILL GIVE YOU SOME SORT
                   OF TONE.  IF THE TONE DOES NOT END IN 3 SECONDS,
                   THEN PUNCH IN THE CODE AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE
                   CODE, THE NUMBER YOU ARE DIALING BUT STRIKE THE
                   '1' IN THE BEGINNING OUT FIRST. IF THE TONE DOES
                   END, THEN PUNCH IN THE CODE WHEN THE TONE ENDS.
                   THEN, IT WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER TONE.  PUNCH IN THE
                   NUMBER YOU ARE DIALING, OR A '9'. IF YOU PUNCH IN
                   A '9' AND THE TONE STOPS, THEN YOU MESSED UP A
                   LITTLE. IF YOU PUNCH IN A TONE AND THE TONE
                   CONTINUES, THEN SIMPLY DIAL THEN NUMBER YOU ARE
                   CALLING WITHOUT THE  '1'.

                4) ALL CODES ARE NOT UNIVERSAL. THE ONLY TYPE THAT I
                   KNOW OF THAT IS TRULY UNIVERSAL IS METROPHONE.
                   ALMOST EVERY MAJOR CITY HAS A LOCAL METRO DIALUP
                   (FOR PHILADELPHIA, (215)351-0100/0126) AND SINCE THE
                   CODES ARE UNIVERSAL, ALMOST EVERY PHREAK HAS USED
                   THEM ONCE OR TWICE. THEY DO NOT EMPLOY ANI IN ANY
                   OUTLETS THAT I KNOW OF, SO FEEL FREE TO CHECK
                   THROUGH YOUR BOOKS AND CALL 555-1212 OR, AS A MORE
                   DEVIOUS MANOR, SUBSCRIBE YOURSELF. THEN, NEVER USE
                   YOUR OWN CODE. THAT WAY, IF THEY CHECK UP ON YOU DUE
                   TO YOUR CALLER LOG, THEY CAN USUALLY FIND OUT THAT
                   YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED.  NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU COULD SET
                   A PHREAK HACKER AROUND THAT AREA AND JUST LET IT
                   HACK AWAY, SINCE THEY USUALLY GROUP THEM, AND, AS A
                   BONUS, YOU WILL HAVE THEIR LOCAL DIALUP.

                5) 950'S. THEY SEEM LIKE A PERFECTLY COOL PHREAKERS
                   DREAM. THEY ARE FREE FROM YOUR HOUSE, FROM PAYPHONES,
                   FROM EVERYWHERE, AND THEY HOST ALL OF THE MAJOR LONG
                   DISTANCE COMPANIES (950-1044 <MCI>, 950-1077
                   <SPRINT>, 950-1088 <SKYLINES>, 950-1033 <US
                   TELECOM>.) WELL, THEY AREN'T. THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR
                   ANI. THAT IS THE POINT, END OF DISCUSSION.

     A PHREAK DICTIONARY. IF YOU REMEMBER ALL OF THE THINGS CONTAINED ON THAT
FILEUP THERE, YOU MAY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF DOING WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO. THIS
NEXT SECTION IS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING...

BLUE BOX PLANS:
---------------

     THESE ARE SOME BLUE BOX PLANS, BUT FIRST, BE WARNED, THERE HAVE BEEN 2600HZ
TONE DETECTORS OUT ON OPERATOR TRUNK LINES SINCE XB4. THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS TO
USE A 2600HZ TONE FOR A FEW VERY NAUGHTY FUNCTIONS THAT CAN REALLY MAKE YOUR DAY
LIGHTEN UP. BUT FIRST, HERE ARE THE PLANS, OR THE HEART OF THE FILE:

700  :   1   :   2   :   4   :   7   :  11   :
900  :   +   :   3   :   5   :   8   :  12   :
1100 :   +   :   +   :   6   :   9   :  KP   :
1300 :   +   :   +   :   +   :  10   :  KP2  :
1500 :   +   :   +   :   +   :   +   :  ST   :
     : 700   : 900   :1100   :1300   :1500   :

     STOP! BEFORE YOU DIEHARD USERS START PIECING THOSE LITTLE TONE TIDBITS
TOGETHER, THERE IS A SIMPLER METHOD. IF YOU HAVE AN APPLE-CAT WITH A PROGRAM
LIKE CAT'S MEOW IV, THEN YOU CAN GENERATE THE NECESSARY TONES, THE 2600HZ TONE,
THE KP TONE, THE KP2 TONE, AND THE ST TONE THROUGH THE DIAL SECTION. SO IF YOU
HAVE THAT I WILL ASSUME YOU CAN BOOT IT UP AND IT WORKS, AND I'LL DO YOU THE
FAVOR OF TELLING YOU AND THE OTHER USERS WHAT TO DO WITH THE BLUE BOX NOW THAT
YOU HAVE SOMEHOW CONSTRUCTED IT. THE CONNECTION TO AN OPERATOR IS ONE OF THE
MOST WELL KNOWN AND USED WAYS OF HAVING FUN WITH YOUR BLUE BOX. YOU SIMPLY DIAL
A TSPS (TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITIONING STATION, OR THE OPERATOR YOU GET WHEN YOU
DIAL '0') AND BLOW A 2600HZ TONE THROUGH THE LINE. WATCH OUT! DO NOT DIAL THIS
DIRECT! AFTER YOU HAVE DONE THAT, IT IS QUITE SIMPLE TO HAVE FUN WITH IT. BLOW A
KP TONE TO START A CALL, A ST TONE TO STOP IT, AND A 2600HZ TONE TO HANG UP.
ONCE YOU HAVE CONNECTED TO IT, HERE ARE SOME FUN NUMBERS TO CALL WITH IT:

      0-700-456-1000  TELECONFERENCE (FREE, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE OPERATOR!)
      (AREA CODE)-101 TOLL SWITCHING
      (AREA CODE)-121 LOCAL OPERATOR (HEHE)
      (AREA CODE)-131 INFORMATION
      (AREA CODE)-141 RATE & ROUTE
      (AREA CODE)-181 COIN REFUND OPERATOR
      (AREA CODE)-11511 CONFERENCE OPERATOR (WHEN YOU DIAL 800-544-6363)

     WELL, THOSE WERE THE TONE MATRIX CONTROLLERS FOR THE BLUE BOX AND SOME
OTHER HELPFUL STUFF TO HELP YOU TO START OUT WITH. BUT THOSE ARE ONLY THE
FUNCTIONS WITH THE OPERATOR. THERE ARE OTHER K-FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH IT.

     MORE ADVANCED BLUE BOX STUFF:

     OOPS. SMALL MISTAKE UP THERE. I FORGOT TONE LENGTHS. UM, YOU BLOW A TONE
PAIR OUT FOR UP TO 1/10 OF A SECOND WITH ANOTHER 1/10 SECOND FOR SILENCE BETWEEN
THE DIGITS. KP TONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR 2/10 OF A SECOND. ONE WAY TO CONFUSE THE
2600HZ TRAPS IS TO SEND PINK NOISE OVER THE CHANNEL (FOR ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE
DECENT BSR EQUALIZERS, THERE IS MAJOR PINK NOISE IN THERE.) USING THE OPERATOR
FUNCTIONS IS THE USE OF THE 'INWARD' TRUNK LINE. THAT IS WORKING IT FROM THE
INSIDE. FROM THE 'OUTWARD' TRUNK, YOU CAN DO SUCH THINGS AS MAKE EMERGENCY
BREAKTHROUGH CALLS, TAP INTO LINES, BUSY ALL OF THE LINES IN ANY TRUNK (CALLED
'STACKING'), ENABLE OR DISABLE THE TSPS'S, AND FOR SOME 4A SYSTEMS YOU CAN EVEN
RE-ROUTE CALLS TO ANYWHERE.

     ALL RIGHT. THE ONE THING THAT EVERY COMPLETE PHREAK GUIDE SHOULD BE WITHOUT
IS BLUE BOX PLANS, SINCE THEY WERE ONCE A VITAL PART OF PHREAKING. ANOTHER THING
THAT EVERY COMPLETE FILE NEEDS IS A COMPLETE LISTING OF ALL OF THE 800 NUMBERS
AROUND SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME MORE FUN.

 /-/   800 DIALUP LISTINGS  /-/

1-800-345-0008 (6)   1-800-547-6754 (6)
1-800-245-4890 (4)   1-800-327-9136 (4)
1-800-526-5305 (8)   1-800-858-9000 (3)
1-800-437-9895 (7)   1-800-245-7508 (5)
1-800-343-1844 (4)   1-800-322-1415 (6)
1-800-437-3478 (6)   1-800-325-7222 (6)

     ALL RIGHT, SET CAT HACKER 1.0 ON THOSE NUMBERS AND HAVE A FUCK OF A DAY.
THAT IS ENOUGH WITH 800 CODES, BY THE TIME THIS GETS AROUND TO YOU I DUNNO WHAT
STATE THOSE CODES WILL BE IN, BUT TRY THEM ALL OUT ANYWAYS AND SEE WHAT YOU GET.
ON SOME 800 SERVICES NOW, THEY HAVE AN OPERATOR WHO WILL ANSWER AND ASK YOU FOR
YOUR CODE, AND THEN YOUR NAME. SOME WILL SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN VOICE AND
TONE VERIFICATION, YOU CAN NEVER BE QUITE SURE WHICH YOU WILL BE UP AGAINST.

     ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE YOU SHOULD BE HAVING A PRETTY GOOD TIME PHREAKING
NOW. BUT CLASS ISN'T OVER YET, THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE IMPORTANT RULES THAT YOU
SHOULD KNOW. IF YOU HEAR CONTINUAL CLICKING ON THE LINE, THEN YOU SHOULD ASSUME
THAT AN OPERATOR IS MESSING WITH SOMETHING, MAYBE EVEN LISTENING IN ON YOU. IT
IS A GOOD IDEA TO CALL SOMEONE BACK WHEN THE PHONE STARTS DOING THAT. IF YOU
WERE USING A CODE, USE A DIFFERENT CODE AND/OR SERVICE TO CALL HIM BACK.

     A GOOD WAY TO DETECT IF A CODE HAS GONE BAD OR NOT IS TO LISTEN WHEN THE
NUMBER HAS BEEN DIALED. IF THE CODE IS BAD YOU WILL PROBABLY HEAR THE PHONE
RINGING MORE CLEARLY AND MORE QUICKLY THAN IF YOU WERE USING A DIFFERENT CODE.
IF SOMEONE ANSWERS VOICE TO IT THEN YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY ASSUME THAT IT IS AN
OPERATIVE FOR WHATEVER COMPANY YOU ARE USING. THE FAMED '311311' CODE FOR METRO
IS ONE OF THOSE. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE STUPID TO ACTUALLY RESPOND, BECAUSE
WHOEVER YOU ASK FOR THE OPERATOR WILL ALWAYS SAY 'HE'S NOT IN RIGHT NOW, CAN I
HAVE HIM CALL YOU BACK?' AND THEN THEY WILL ASK FOR YOUR NAME AND PHONE NUMBER.
SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPANIES WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A CARRIER ON A
LINE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU A CARRIER AND THEN JUST HAVE GARBAGE FLOW
ACROSS THE SCREEN LIKE IT WOULD WITH A BAD CONNECTION. THAT IS A FEEBLE EFFORT
TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT THE CODE IS STILL WORKING AND MAYBE GET YOU TO DIAL
SOMEONE'S VOICE, A GOOD TEST FOR THE CARRIER TRICK IS TO DIAL A NUMBER THAT WILL
GIVE YOU A CARRIER THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DIALED WITH THAT CODE BEFORE, THAT WILL
ALLOW YOU TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CODE IS GOOD OR NOT. FOR OUR NEXT SECTION, A
LIGHTER LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT A PHREAK SHOULD NOT BE WITHOUT. A
VOCABULARY. A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT WAS A QUITE STRANGE WORLD FOR THE MODEM PEOPLE
OUT THERE. BUT NOW, A PHREAKER'S VOCABULARY IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU WANNA MAKE A
GOOD IMPRESSION ON PEOPLE WHEN YOU POST WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN SUBJECTS.

 /-/    VOCABULARY    /-/

 - DO NOT MISSPELL EXCEPT CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS:

             PHONE -> FONE
             FREAK -> PHREAK

 - NEVER SUBSTITUTE 'Z'S FOR 'S'S. (I.E. CODEZ -> CODES)

 - NEVER LEAVE MANY CHARACTERS AFTER A POST (I.E. HEY DUDES!#!@#@!#!@)

 - NEVER USE THE 'K' PREFIX (K-KOOL, K-RAD, K-WHATEVER)

 - DO NOT ABBREVIATE. (I GOT LOTSA WARES W/ DOCS)

 - NEVER SUBSTITUTE '0' FOR 'O' (R0DENT, L0ZER).

 - FORGET ABOUT YE OLD UPPER CASE, IT LOOKS RUGGYISH.

     ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS TO RELIEVE THE TENSION OF WHAT IS BEING DRILLED INTO
YOUR MINDS AT THE MOMENT.  NOW, HOWEVER, BACK TO THE TEACHING COURSE. HERE ARE
SOMETHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PHONES AND BILLINGS FOR PHONES, ETC.

     LATA: LOCAL ACCESS TRANSFERENCE AREA. SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN LARGE CITIES
OR AREAS MAY BE PLAGUED BY THIS PROBLEM. FOR INSTANCE, LET'S SAY YOU LIVE IN THE
215 AREA CODE UNDER THE 542 PREFIX (AMBLER, FORT WASHINGTON). IF YOU WENT TO
DIAL IN A BASIC METRO CODE FROM THAT AREA, FOR INSTANCE, 351-0100, THAT MIGHT
NOT BE COUNTED UNDER UNLIMITED LOCAL CALLING BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF YOUR LATA.
FOR SOME LATA'S, YOU HAVE TO DIAL A '1' WITHOUT THE AREA CODE BEFORE YOU CAN
DIAL THE PHONE NUMBER. THAT COULD PROVE A HASSLE FOR US ALL IF YOU DIDN'T
REALIZE YOU WOULD BE BILLED FOR THAT SORT OF CALL. IN THAT WAY, SOMETIMES, IT IS
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY AND PHREAK.

     THE CALLER LOG: IN ESS REGIONS, FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD AROUND, THE PHONE
COMPANY HAS SOMETHING ON YOU CALLED A CALLER LOG. THIS SHOWS EVERY SINGLE NUMBER
THAT YOU DIALED, AND THINGS CAN BE ARRANGED SO IT SHOWED EVERY NUMBER THAT WAS
CALLING TO YOU. THAT'S ONE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF ESS, IT IS MOSTLY COMPUTERIZED
SO A NUMBER SCAN COULD BE DONE LIKE THAT QUITE EASILY. USING A DIALUP IS AN EASY
WAY TO SCREW THAT, AND IS SOMETHING WORTH REMEMBERING. ANYWAYS, WITH THE CALLER
LOG, THEY CHECK UP AND SEE WHAT YOU DIALED. HMM... YOU DIALED 15 DIFFERENT 800
NUMBERS THAT MONTH. SOON THEY FIND THAT YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED TO NONE OF THOSE
COMPANIES. BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY THING. MOST PEOPLE WOULD IMAGINE "BUT WAIT!
800 NUMBERS DON'T SHOW UP ON MY PHONE BILL!". TO THOSE PEOPLE, IT IS A NICE
THOUGHT, BUT 800 NUMBERS ARE PICKED UP ON THE CALLER LOG UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THEY
ARE SENT OFF TO YOU. SO THEY CAN CHECK RIGHT UP ON YOU BEFORE THEY SEND IT AWAY
AND CAN NOTE THE FACT THAT YOU FUCKED UP SLIGHTLY AND CALLED ONE TOO MANY 800
LINES.

     RIGHT NOW, AFTER ALL OF THAT, YOU SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW TO
GROW UP AS A GOOD PHREAK. FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES, DON'T SHOW OFF, AND DON'T
TAKE UNNECESSARY RISKS WHEN PHREAKING OR HACKING.
