Well, welcome to the sequel!  Actually, originally Tap2 was just the second
half, you may remember after the interviews I started with "The Elite File",
well this is part II!  Now lets formally introduce this file:

%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%The Elite File II%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%
Written, Produced and Directed by Dead Lord.  Starring The Doc and the whole
t0tally Elite crowd from SpecElitePosers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
Now that that's settled I can get right into the writing.  As you know I wrote
Tap.Interviews II also, and before I get into this I'd like to excuse myself
for it.  Actually I found out that Taran King is actually a pretty cool and
together frood.  There were also a lot of rumors going around about a 
conflict between myself and Tap, don't believe it, right now I'm on good terms
with many of them.  Now, let me make apparent the general gist the rest of the
file will take.  I am throughly pissed at piracy, The Doc, and his whole
SpecElite Nonsense, so I will be devoting the rest of this file to rewording
that concept as many different ways as possible, without you actually noticing
the redundancy.  It will be quite a task, but I think I can do it. <WISH ME
LUCK!>.

The kind of main body of the file type of secton:
Well, here we are in the main body kinda bit, so I guess I'd better start
talking so I can get in everything I have to say before it gets to be the
conclusion already.  You see, I read that Elite's Anyonymous thing a few
monthes ago and it really pissed me.  I reread it a few days ago and it sparked
renewed intrest on my part to write a response.  This is a bit late, but
the 'ware' never got much distribution anyway so most people didn't see it(I
hope).  From talking to people who have been on the Spectrum, talking to The
Doc himself, and reading his little files, I've come to throughly deplore him.
Why?  Well The Doc is a firm believer that he is elite and a firm believer in
the theory of "Eliteness by Association".  He believes himself to be "Elite"
even though he's never done shit that matters.  Lets look at how k-radical
his history of SpecElite is, take special note of The Docs writing style,
I'd estimate it to be around the 2nd grade level...

HISTORY OF THE SPECTRUM BBS
---------------------------

        It all started back in 1980 when I put up:  'The Doc's Domain'.  It was
a Networks based bbs.  Well, in fact, it was Pirate's Mountain.  I modified to
my own likes and put it up.  Road Runner (the creator of Pirate's Mountain)
obviously got upset, and told me to take it down.  I gradually learned more
and more about bulletin board systems..  Doc's Domain was somewhat popular. 
It was public, and all the losers were on.  I thought it was kool at the time;
however, I soon learned what the 'pirate world' was all about.  The people
back then who I associated with were, Micro Ghoul, Tim Tam, the Saint, Green
Manalishi, Snack Attack, the Hoopty, the Swami, Road Runner, and the I.C.  Tim
Tam was the one I respected the most.  But the biggest influences of my 'road
to eliteness' was Snack Attack and unfortunately, Green Manalishi.  I soon got
in my first club which I think was I/N/T/E/N/S/E.. Chief Okoboji and Midway
Hawker were the ones who put me in.  Midway Hawker was really cool, and was
the biggest influence in getting me in.  Soon after I/N/T/E/N/S/E, Green
Manalishi and I became good friends.  He formed a group called the
Incorrigibles and put me in, under one condition...only if I put up an
incorrigible based system with other cool users.  This was the beginning of
the Spectrum ELITE.  I was very happy to get accepted to a group of elites
such as Ali Baba, the Saint, the I.C., the Cog, etc..etc.  Now to make a long
story short..         After Doc's Domain went down I put up a gbbs system for
the first time.  I started from original gbbs dos 3.3 and modified that sucker
as best as I could.  I got the name, the Spectrum from Philadelphia 76'ers
arena.. then my friend pushed me to use that for a bbs.  I did, and it turned
out to be very successful.  The public spectrum went okay..  I do not remember
all of it.  Soon, I got in Incorrigibles and changed it to SPECELITE.  This
was gbbs based (No Modules back then).  Pretty wierd.  I then learned more
aboud 'm0dz' and soon the SpecElite became one of the most modified gbbs's in
the country.  I then got the idea for basketball and this is what really made
the specelite genuine.  I soon had many, many cool users and of course all
this time it was private.  At one point (the Peak of the SpecElite).. I was
getting 63 new messages a day (63 was the average!)  I think the highest was
75 or something.  One Eye, and the Cog were my most active users at the time. 
My best poster was the Camel Jockey (I'm almost sure).  My computer then
burned out, and I had to take the board down for a month or so..  Soon the
Black Market elite was formed and that bbs became somewhat popular.  (Of
course Black market started public also - Contact Night Owl for the history of
BME).  I then went on a long summer vacation to Hawaii and the board was down
for quite  long time.  Black Market Elite became very popular and SpecElite
was falling.  I then came back, and put the board back up.  It went pretty
good.  For a long time, it was SpecElite and Black Market Elite...and during
all this, the Tavern Elite had always been up.  I guess SpecElite was the 2nd
elite board ever up.  When the SpecElite had 63 new messages a day, I believe
at that time, it was the best board in the country.  Well, I soon put  cat-fur
in my bbs, an became somewhat of a 'pirate'.  Then the elites were dying all
of a sudden.  And I took down the board..put up a pubic system called the Dark
Realm and made some money and also thought it was a pretty cool bbs.  I soon
got really sick and tired of the local losers so I put the SpecElite back up. 
When it did go back up.. it was some-what semi-elite.  And soon it was crashed
for the first time.  I also was getting sick of computers anyways, so I put up
my retirement notice on the Tavern, and there seemed to be the END of the
SpecElite, and me!         What happened then?  Well I had a better life
without all the computer crap.  Well, tragedy struck.. My girlfriend broke up
with me, my boss fired me, and tennis season was over.  What was I to do?  I
was bored off my ass.   I then figured.. I want to call some board see what's
going on with the 'pirate world'.  However, my modem was not working, so I
immediately borrowed a modem from a friend (which I have now).  He never uses
it, so therefore I think I will have it for awhile.  I then started calling
around..  I decided, 'what the hell?' and put the SPECELITE back up.. Calling
it SpecElite //, the Next Dynasty.  This is where I am today.  I figure the
SpecElite // should be up for quite a long time, since it's going pretty
well... Even if I get a job, girlfriend, and play some sport.. I believe I can
handle running a board.  This new board is ProDOS based, and really is easy to
run.  I guess that's just a brief summary of the Spec history and me.  Hope
you liked
it..

the Doc/Elites Anonymous/SpeCrue
author of the Spectrum Bulletin
board systems.  (Dos 3.3, ProDOS).

Wow!  Talk about going around in circles.  The Doc must have taken his board
up and down more times than anyone.  A basic analysis of the above is that
The Doc is outlining everything he's every done with his modem, and we are
supposed to somehow think of him as a model.  He then has the gall to proclaim
his board to be the greatest at certain times and to be the second elite board
ever.  Wow!  But wait, there's still more!  The Doc also tells us about how
he 'learned about the pirate world' and got into his local bunch of 13-year
old kids who had modems group.  What we are looking at here is a prime
example of someone who holds the 'pirate world' in respect.  Let me tell you
what the 'pirate world' is then, just so we can get our definitions straight.
You see, the pirate world is a bunch of kids who can't program(The Doc), can't
hack(The Doc) and don't know the first thing about Telecom(The Doc).  So what
is it that these kids do with their modems?  How do they live out their
wargames fantasies when they have no skill, talent or motivation?  Easy!  They
can get the latest wares and be a pirate!  Some of them even go on to read
the much revered 'Kracowitz krakfiles' and become what they worship most, a
kraker!  Everyone loves krakers, thanks to these highest of the high in our
little 'pirate world' all the elites can get the latest wares!  Oh what a
blessing they are!  Its a shame that though a few krakers have gone on to show
actually proficiency in programming, to krak a game 95% of the time's a snap.
5% of the time you are even required to know some assembly language!!!  Now,
I can understand, despite its simplicity, holding those who krak games as
"Elite", but most of the denziens of the 'pirate world' can't(The Doc), most
are just new wares kids who run around bragging about their association with 
XYZ Kraking group.  Most of the discussion has become "Well the Bunnymen are
having a war with DG over who will release Ultima XVII.  Since I distribute
for LSD, I blah, blah, blah...".  Lets look at this next bit of text, oh, and
by the way if you're wondering how I got these files off the disk, after five
minutes of poking around, I realized the the VTOC had been moved to track $11
from track $0B.  Real tough protection as you can see, just move it back.
The Doc is extremely proud of his koolness, and says so, lets take a look at
some of the choice bits from the next part, which is The Doc's biography of

'The Untouchables'.  I've left out all the nonsense about the different
members, I'm going to analyze each of the paragraphs as we go along:
                 
     The Untouchables was formed by 
Damien the Dreaded and Zero Page. They
met on Pirates Inn which was the third
pirate board in existance! (The first
and second were: Pirates Harbor, and
Pirates Cove).
[ Ok, so he starts out with a little bit about his heroes, Damien and Zero Page
and how they met on the third pirate board in existance.  Ok stop point.
WHAT?  What is a pirate board first of all?  A board that allows discussion of
software piracy?  Couldn't be, Pirates Inn (and incidentally Pirates Harbor
and Pirates Cove) weren't the first with that.  Hmm, I guess he must mean
they were the third board to use 'pirate' in the name.  Yes, thats a definite
possibility, I'll concede that Pirates Inn was a major groundbreaker for 
bulletin boards because it was the third to use 'pirate' in the name.  What
a distinction!<SIGH!>
    Ok, lets scan down to the next line: ]

     When the club died out, the 1200
Club was just starting up. Many quit
and went into phreaking.

[STOP!  What now?  "Many quit and went into phreaking."  Hmm, lets look at that
again, "Many quit and went into phreaking."  What are these little kiddies
talking about?  Do they know?  I think that what they may be trying to get
across is that after they dropped kraking, many of the ex-members took up an
interest in telecommunications.  Hmm, I don't think that authors know what they
are talking about, and it rather seems that they are as I suspected ignorant
pirates.  "Many quit and went into phreaking."  Hmm, like they just said,
"Hey!  I don't think I'm going to get my power trip from pirating any more!
I'll be a kool phone phreak and everybody will love me even more!  yah! I can
start confrences and learn about awl the koolest ma bell info!  Hmph!  Next
paragraph: ]

     At that time, everyone was cool,
there were no losers. Everone gave each
other wares and everyone was respected.

[ No losers?  You were around weren't you?  "Everyone gave each other wares and
everyone was respected."  What the hell is that?  To me this means a bunch of
pre-teens calling each other great and trading games, this is nonsense!
Next Line: ]

     Damien said "If everything was the
way it used to be, I would get back 
into it."  Who wouldn't blame him!

[ Now that's the worst, This Damien misses the old days even though the 'old
days' were just like the new days only then didn't realize what losers you all
were.  None of these elite people have accomplished anything, including this
Damien fellow, so why does he miss the old days? grrrr! ]

And the end I thought was especially interesting as it shows you exactly how
much of a pudnick The Doc and his buddies are.  Well I can understand how
he misses the old days, lets take a look at some of his own examples of what
the old days were like:

        The following messages are from the board, 'Pirates Mountain'.  These we
re some of the pirates of way back then (1981-1983).

Yes, what a golden time that was.  Well, at least everyone respected everyone
else and gave them wares... right? Hmm, if that's an example of what The Doc
considers the 'golden era' then he IS a loser.  I mean how many of out there
can see that these messages were written by stupid suburbanite kids who were
bored?  C'mon, raise your hands, lets take a headcount.  Hmmm, that's most
of ya, what I expected.  Let's take another case of little kids taking modems
and boards too seriously.  Here we have a small essay by The Reaper on what he
thinks the modem world should be.  I'd like to note that he is a good friend
of The Doc and they share a lot of views in common:

  It seems that most of you users have come to realize that the word "Elite" no
 longer holds the same aura that it once had in the past.  Partly true, you
 have stumbled across one of the major issues regarding the world of computer
 pirating today. 
[ Ok, we will soon see what exactly this idiot thinks elite means, here we see
him apply 'elite' directly to pirating even though there is nothing worthy
of it in pirating, or anything else for that matter ]
  I can remember the days of two years past, the days when pirating was
 thriving and when I was just entering this realm of silicon sorcery.  I wanted
 so badly to have the label "Elite".  Why?  I guess it was partly due to the
 obvious ensuing ego trip and partly just for the hell of it.  It turned out
 that my mentor, Chief Okoboji, had taken an interest in me - at a friend's
 request.  One thing led to another and I was started on my way in the pirating
 world.  A few months later and a number of connections afterwards, I began to
 be labeled as "Cool", "Elite", etc.  It was great.  An ever aging veteran now,
 I am considered to be an "elite" by those worthy to ajudge a person as such. ]
  When I was working towards "elite", the system in effect was one of
 seniority, one where the elites were the teachers and the losers were the
 students.  In the past, loser meant a novitiate or tyro user and elite meant
 one who knew the wires.  To become elite, you were first a loser, you got a
 chance and you worked for what you wanted out of your hobby.  Today, this
 system has failed - partly because of the vast number of "trendy" losers.
 These new users are here to gather fame and an ego trip (as all of us are),
 but some are legitimate in their desire for knowledge (as the elites are).
 The system has failed because there are so many people.  We need to get an
 organized system to handle all the new applicants - one which screens very
 well.  I say cut the losers, teach the disciples who really wish to learn and
 keep the elders alive; for in the end, our quality and quantity will damage
 us.  The losers get busted and the elites suffer.  Make it not easy for new
 "trendies" to attain levels previously available only to those who deserved
 them, the problem will be solvd, and we will remain intact.  You do not see a
 fresh employee of IBM become Vice President overnight!  Consider that.
[ The Reaper : The Chosen/Ware Lords ]
Ok now that was idiotic.  He mentions elite a number of times, but fails to
give any definitons.  His seniority example is a poor one, does he consider
the fact that someone has hung around for four years a virtue?  And what's
this teach the disciples who want to learn?  Learn WHAT for God's sake!!!
What do people like The Reaper have to teach!  Nothing!  Absolutely Nothing!
What he considors an Elite is someone who's been around long enough to be
let on elite pirate boards and gets new wares.  Where's the skill?  An ever
aging veteran?  of fucking WHAT?  What did you ever do Reaper?  What do you
know that makes you an elite pirate?  And I haven't the foggiest idea of these
'worthy to judge the elites', who the hell are you talking about?  Do you mean
people who are still playing with their pirate-toys after a few years of it?
An infantile bunch if you want my opinion.
And about the days when piracy was thriving, if I may step into your little
'pirate world' for a moment and compare it, in the 'old days' it follows logic
that you would have been much unhappier, since the way your precious wares
wares were distributed was through individual trades.  Today 10 times the
number of people get new wares, and faster because there are huge cat-furs
all over the country for quick distribution.  If the ultimate goal of piracy is
quick distribution of wares then you should be happier now, no?  But of course
the ultimate goal of piracy is for a bunch of kids to put on their superhero
outfits and for a bit be the high, mighty and powerful people they wish they
were.  Its just a power trip for people who have no inherent talent for 
Computers, and no motivation to learn.  Why don't you get a life and
not just vegatate on boards and involve  yourself in petty things like
wares.  According to The Reaper the critera for being 'cool' and 'elite' is
just a lesson in making a good impression to other bored little kids on 
bulletin boards.
    Another subject I'd like to touch upon, is that in The Doc's little file,
he included info about many of his users on his board.  The list of users to
choose from is impressive, the only problem is that about 1/5 of the total are
actually available, if you pick someone from the list who is not on the disk,
you are shown the message:

No information available at the present moment.  Information will be available o
n future data disks..
This gets extremely annoying as you may imagine.  For many of the people
who ARE included on the disk, the content is "Joe Pirate is from the 123 area
code (gongeyland, RV) and was one of my best users."  This would then be
followed by one or two of Joe Pirate's posts on SpecElite which would be
something like Joe's latest sector edit, and would tell us nothing about the
elite(and I use the term 'elite' facetiously) in question.  One of the more
interesting of out friend The Doc's little pieces in on 'Incognito',
Basically the Incognito's data consisted of his 60+ sector rag file on
'leeches' [ another one of those silly pirate-words ]  The file is stupid, and
so Incog.  The asshole posts he'll never get busted 3 weeks before he gets
busted!  Real smart guy there Doc...

===---

Well that's all for this file.  This file was written in September, '86.
Everything after the "===---" was written on 16th Dec, '86.  Files to look for:
The Direct Connect Story:Chronicles of Mischief(Tentative title)
and my Rebuttal to Fall of The Modem World, which is as of yet untitled and
will be about 150-300 sectors, all about Tap, facts about elites, and buffers
of them.  It will be my personal Version of Tap.Interviews I&II, Elite File
I&II, National Enlightener, and Fall of the Modem World all tied together.
