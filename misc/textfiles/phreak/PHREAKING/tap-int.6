     Hi dudez!

<Audience is swept off their feet, roars applause, screams compliments, hurls
 money at the stage.  I like it...  I like it... I could live with this too!>

     Tap.Interviews FOREVER!

<Audience roars approval!>

     Since Infiltrator#5

<Boo> <Boo>

                         saw fit to kill the entire series.  The least I can
do is bring it back!  I don't think Tap.Interviews is up to one person to kill
off...  Unless that one person is the REAL Infiltrator who started it.  In
which case I would have enough class to get off his vehicle, if so asked.  He
would of course have to PROVE to me that he is the ORIGINAL Infiltrator.  Like
by playing me some of those funky tapes over the phone.

     I have my doubts that he is around at this point.  If he is, I have my
doubts that he cares.  If he does, he's welcome to come forward and I will be
only too happy to start my own file format for this.

     It could be debated that this isn't Tap.Interviews at all, or rather that
HIS Tap.Interviews is the one that doesn't "fit in" (being the ONLY real one).
But I could handle it.  Really!

<Some Changes:>

(I REALLY like this onscreen center stuff.  If there are any WordPerfect reps
out there reading this, I appreciate the free use of your program.  Its worth
the price of admission.)
