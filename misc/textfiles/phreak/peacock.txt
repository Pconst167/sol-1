   It all started on a Wednesday afternoonon June 28th 1986.  I had just arrivedhome from school, that is another boring day at school,  I sat down at my IBM-PCand called a new mainframe number that I had discovered on the Vield Society
BBS.  No one at the present time knew what computer the number belonged so I
decided to call it and look at it.  It turned out to be a RSTS/E- system by
DEC, I had some experience with it because that was one of the first computers
my dad had introduced me to.  I messed with it about 30 minutes when I was just
about to give up and go on my merry little way when I hit upon my last guess
SYSLIB.  I turned out to be a High Security account.  And from there I'd like tointroduce another person who helped me to get the Password Program to work
his handle is Sir Garlon.  A friend yes, but nevertheless, he helped me when
I needed it and together me and him explorered the facinating world of RSTS/E-
systems, We found out how to Kick off all the high security users and to per-
vent any log-on's (This back fired on us several times especially when I had 
to hang up and couldnt get back on because I forgot to allow log-in's!).
We played with the Mac Tape programs (These let you [When you load one] get 
more programs that have been previously been backed-up).  We messed around
with the back-up programs, We did everything we could to learn about this
system so that one day IF by possible we run across another one again we
will know just what the hell to do.  And now since I have told you my little
story I have decided to compile a text file on some of the commands hints
and fun things to do while on one of these types of system.

   First off if you are one of the lucky ones such as I who got a Priviledged
Account then the first thing you want to do is to get a complete listing on
all the accounts,Passwords,CPU Times, and number of programs on the system.
To do this you need to get on the Master Directory (On most systems this is
in the accounts starting with 1, such as 1,2 or 1,3) on the Peacock Timeshare
it is the 1,2 account.  Then you need to run the program called MONEY (either
MONEY.BAS or MONEY.BAC, usually it is MONEY.BAC) To do this you type from the
main BASIC prompt:

RUN $MONEY <- This means to search all the accounts for this program, But since
              you are in the Master Directory you can, as an alternative, type
RUN MONEY  <- Which means to search in THIS account for the program and then
              run it.

From there it askes you several questions such as:

Output Device: KB: <- This means the screen or the terminal that you are at you
           can also on some systems type in TI:
Print Passwords: Y <- Yes type the passwords
Reset: N <- No you dont want to reset the accounts unless you are the CRASHER
        ype hacker and get your kicks out of doing things like tat.
Disk: N <- I am not quite sure what this means I think it means something
           like print to disk.
Selective: N <- This means 'Do you wish to select the account to print?'

If I have left out a question then I am sorry,  But I can say that you answer
'N' to all the questions except the Print Passwords question.  After you answer
the last question it should pause for a while and then print something like

   Accounting dump of <System Name> as of <Todays Date>

And then it will print out all the passwords, Number of files, CPU time, and
the account number. So ends the subject on printing out all the Passwords.
<Thanks to Sir Garlon who found a file that gave a BRIEF telling on how to
 do it, It was up to us to figure it out> Well then lets get onto the very
system itself!

First off when you log-on to the system you want to hit a ^C (Control C) becausesometimes one high-level (And sometimes on low-level) there will be a program
running that won't drop you all the way into BASIC, The SYSTEMS Operating systemso it is imporatant to hit ^C and stop any program that may be running and
then get into BASIC.  The RSTS/E- BASIC is that same as say the IBM or APPLE
basic except that it will tell you after you type in the BASIC line if there
is an error in it. For Example:

Ready

10 PRINT "Is there anybody out there?     <- This is what you typed, Notice the
         Missing Quote.
$Syntax Error <- This is what the System would type AFTER you hit the Return
         Key.

BASIC is also where you do most of your commands, Such as:

COMPILE,SYSTAT,DECOMPILE,TIME,DATE,RUN,LOAD,SAVE,BYE,HELP,HELLO,LOG,Etc..,Etc..

But the RSTS/E- System is not made up of just BASIC it also has a seperate 
system called PIP (Perpherial Interchange Program).  PIP is a little hard
to explain because it is a VERY big system, This is where you can get
directories on the accounts, type programs, load Mac tapes, and quite
possible things that even I havent figured out yet, I will probably explain
something that I didnt list here so consider that and EXTRA thing!  Ok Lets
get started!

First off to get into PIP is very simple, From the 'Ready' Basic prompt
just type 'PIP' it will pause a while and then it will give you a '*'
prompt which means that you are now in PIP and it is ready for your 
first command.

To get a DIRECTORY of the Account/Accounts type in one of the following:
(We will assume that the account you are in is 1,2)

[1,2]/LI <- This give you the file listing in your account
[1,2]*.*/LI <- This does the same thing, Gives the file listing of your account
[*,*]/LI <- This gives you the file listing of all the accounts

There is also a variation on the '/' command besides '/LI' which means give
you the whole account listing including the program security,the date it was
last edited, and the amount of bytes in YModem Blocks.  I found that you can
get a brief directory that just gives you the Filename by putting in a
'/BR' Which means give me a brief listing of the programs.  Also there are TONS
of other ways to get a directory, But since this is really just a tutorial
I am giving you the Basics on how to do it, or in other words to get you
started.

Now then to type out a file is a VERY simple thing to do, BUT it can also
be rather helpful in doing other things to help do different things,  Such
as I'm sure that most system have documents somewhere about how to backup
the system, and if you can figure out how to do that then you can quite 
possibly learn how to back up the RSTS/E- system onto your computer then
you will have a backed-up copy of the computers files. So here's how you
do it.

Filenm.ext <- Thats it for example with a real file name. On most Priv accounts
         There is a .Hlp file called Utilty.Hlp(More on this latr) To type
            This out just simply say:
Utilty.hlp 

Then the system will type out the help file and further your knowledge on the
program called Utilty.Bac (LOTS more on this in a sec!), one of the most 
helpful files on the whole system. 

I told you there would be more on UTILTY.BAC in a sec and the second is up!
Utilty.Bac is one of the best programs on the system to change passwords,
diable log ins, Hangup lines and much, much more. So I'll get started on 
explaining on how to use this program to your advantage.

The first thing you want to do is run in BASIC like this:

RUN $UTILTY <- It'll wait for a while then it'll load it up and print the
            Header and etc. Now then I am not sure of what type of command
             prompt that it will give you. It may not give you one at all so
        it's up to you to figure it out.  But here are some of the more
        useful commands that you can use with this program.

Command         ing

Logins          e Logins
No Logins       able Logins
Force KBn: TEXT         forces TEXT to be written on a KBn:, Butif the 
        : is omitted for the word ALL (Ex. Force ALL Text)
        will write the TEXT on all the availible keyboards
        = Keyboard Number)
Send KBn: TEXT          s above
Kill n          nate job number n
Hangup KBn:     isconnect the remote line KBn:
Change [PPN] Passwd     ange the [PPN] password to "Passwd"

Well there are about 20-25 more but they are useless to the learning hacker
(I consider hacker as a person already inside a system.) Now then I will 
go into the shader side of my time on this particular system, While I was
on the system I ran across the file called Mactap.Hlp I read it but I really
didnt understand it so. If anyone can make anything out of this go ahead.

Now then I am almost POSITIVE you do this from BASIC, ALSO, there may not
always me a Mac Tape mounted. So some times it may give you a IO ERROR meaning
that there isnt one mounted.  So that means you can mess with it until there
is one mounted. So, here are the docs/help on some of the commands used with 
the Mac Tape.

Here are some of the Function Codes:

I%=MAGTAPE(1%,0%,U%) -> Rewind and set to Off-Line
I%=MAGTAPE(2%,0%,U%) -> Write End-Of-Tape
I%=MAGTAPE(3%,0%,U%) -> Rewind
I%=MAGTAPE(4%,P%,U%) -> Skip Forward P% Records
I%=MAGTAPE(5%,P%,U%) -> Backspace P% Records
I%=MAGTAPE(6%,P%,U%) -> Set density/Parity of tape to P%
I%=MAGTAPE(7%,0%,U%) -> Get Mag Tape Status
I%=MAGTAPE(8%,0%,U%) -> Return file characteristics
I%=MAGTAPE(9%,0%,U%) -> Rewind on close

Ok this may explain a little of what that means up there:

P% = is the integer parameter
U% = The channel on which the MagTape is open

Although I know that I% is equal to a number but I cannot find or figure
out what it is equal to.  Another important thing I want to add is that
the file names are made up of 6 characters and that the .ext (Or the 
extension) can be mad up of either of the following.

.CMD -> This is a command file a file that isnt RUN'ed in BASIC but is
        ran just like a execute file in that you just type in the 6 character
        ame, For example, PIP is a .CMD file and to execute it from
         you just type PIP.

.BAS -> This is just a simple basic program that has to be RUN'ed or loaded
        UN'ed.

.BAC -> Now then this is a completed BASIC program, This type of program CANNOT
        ST'ed out but must be uncompiled. To do this I *THINK* you must
        LOAD the program and then re-SAVE it as another file.  For example:

Load "Login.BAC"
Save "Login.BAS"

        saves the program as ASCII and then can be re-modified. For those
        ant to know what LOGIN.BAC is, it is the program that handles the
         in prcedures.)

.HLP -> This can be simply termed as a Tutorial or a Help file.

There are also some other extensions that cannot be labeled as Major but as
Semi-Major, these are the ones that usually hold information for another file
or is just a small document.  These extesions are:

        T
        T
        V


Well, That about sums it up on the system I got into, and how me and Sir Garlon
worked with it and figured out some of the system function, How ever... There 
are many other functions that I havent included in this file because I am still a little shady about how they work and what the programs function is.. But IF 
I do I will make a part 2 to this file and explain them, But if some one finds
something wrong or doesnt understand a certain function they found that you 
want me to include in my next file or a function in this file then you can
ALWAYS find me on 'The Scarlet Brotherhood (713) 729-6840' The home of
The Greater Ring so sums this one up. Have fun and keep hackin!
