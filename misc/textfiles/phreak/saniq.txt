                              IQ Calling Cards
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   An activity that most phreaks and hackers will eventually come across in
one form or another is carding.  Phreaks in particular will often get
involved in a sub-division of carding where they use things such as AT&T
Calling Cards and whatnot to call where ever it is in the world their
little hearts might desire.  But AT&T and the other calling card makers
have made it a little more difficult as time has worn on for people to
exploit such cards, not impossible, but it is not as easy as it once was.
But JUST when ya think that the phone companies may have finally started
using their brains, finally started using that really bizarre thing you and
I like to call - Common Sense, up pops a scheme that makes you wonder
whether the same yutzes who run our country are the same people who run the
phone companies.  In this case the award for "Gee, You Sure Are A Fucking
Stupid Bunch of Schmendricks" goes to Atlantic Bell for their brilliant
invention, The IQ Card (Stangely enough, it is CALLED IQ, as in "We here at
Atlantic Bell have an IQ of 11").  You may have heard their advertisement
on the radio, "The ONLY card you need."  Well, they sure got that part
right.

   Often the hardest thing to do when playing around with calling cards is
to get a valid calling card number.  Well with these beauties you MAKE UP
your own valid card number right over the phone when you order it.  Here,
lemme give you an example of what a conversation might be like when
attempting to get your grubby little hands on one of these suckers.  Or at
least I'll give you something close to what mine was.  Read the convo and
I'll explain everything afterwards.

          ----  Sample Phone Conversation Asking for an IQ Card  ----

R I N G ! !    R I N G ! !

Operator:  Hello, Dumb Fucks Are Us - Atlantic Bell, can I help you?
Moi:       Ah, hi.  I'd like to order an IQ Card.
Operator:  Alrighty, can I have your name?
Moi:       Yea, it's Dick Hertz.
                           ---- Interlude ----
(Hey, do you know someone named Dick Hertz???  No, whose Dick Hertz? <Ha!
Get it?  Write that on your sign-in sheet next time you have a substitute
in class and watch her shout that out over the class.  "HEY, WHOSE DICK
HERTZ??">  Sorry, **I** though it was funny..  Nevermind)
                           ---- Extralude ----
Operator:  Okay, can I have your address?
Moi:       Yea, it's 69 Or Up Her Tush Lane.  That's O-R, space, U-P,
           space, H-E-R, space, T-U-S-H, space, L-A-N-E.
Operator:  City?
Moi:       My-Little-Mohican (What my girlfriend calls my penis) City, NJ,
           66677.
Operator:  Okay.  What is the name on the billing address?
Moi:       The name is Butt Hertz.
Operator:  And can I have your business (day) and home phone number?
Moi:       My home number is 908-777-6666 and my day number is the same.
Operator:  Okay.  Now your card number is going to be made up of your ten
           digit phone number and a four digit pin.  Would you like Bell to
           chose the pin for you?
Moi:       Nah.  I'll do it, 2600.
Operator:  Would you like the number printed on the card?
Moi:       Umm.  Yep, in case silly me forgets it.
Operator:  And how many calling cards would you like (actually, they'll
           probably ask you that a little sooner, but who cares)?
Moi:       One will be fine, thanks.
Operator:  Are you interested in Caller ID?
Moi:       Umm.  Just send me some information on it.
Operator:  Alright then sir.  You should recieve your IQ Card in about
           three weeks.
Moi:       After when will the card be active?
Operator:  After three working days.
Moi:       Yippie!  Um, I mean, okay.  Thanks, bye.

C L I C K
                      ----  End Conversation  ----

   Now first off I would recommend calling for the card from a payphone.
The phone I used did not have the characteristic "9" in the number so that
an operator would KNOW that I was calling from a payphone though, so it may
have worked for me on a fluke.  But it should work anyhow, just use a
little social engineering, or you might be able to just go use a COCOT.  Oh
yeah, the number to call is:

Atlantic Bell - 800.352.ONLY  (Wow, they are clever.  "The ONLY card you
                               need."  Wow, I'm so impressed.)

Since it is an 800 number it REALLY doesn't matter WHERE you call from
(remeber that all 800 numbers appear on your phone bill but are deleted
just before it is mailed to you though).  But just in case Bell records a
Caller ID number, I would greatly discourage you to do it from home, unless
you like fines and jail of course (and also pissing-off all the other
people who read this file because they won't be able to use it anymore
cause you screwed things up).  Maybe your mom's office could be a
possibility if it is big enough, or whatever.  Just use your head; the more
public the better.
   Second.  If you are thirteen, or at least, if you SOUND like you are
thirteen, please get someone else who you trust to do this.  Don't ruin it
for the rest of us.  If a twelve year old calls a couple of times, Bell
will think it a prank.  A lot of times and they might start getting
suspicious.
   Your main piece of equipment here is going to be a phone book.  (By the
way, while I'm thinking of it, there is no start-up fee for the card.  It
is free.  All "you" pay for are the calls made on it.)  While the name you
give to have the card under could be anyone living in the household (and
they don't know who lives there.  They could find out, but really won't go
through all the trouble), they will ask you for the name on the billing
address.  Basically, that is just to whom the phone bill is mailed to.
Example:

     There is this kid who you really despise.  You call Bell and
     ask to get a card.  You give them the name, Dave Smalldick
     when they ask for your name (it is really his).  When they
     ask for the billing name, you say John SmallDick because that
     is his father's name and HE is the one the bill is mailed to
     every month.  John SmallDick is the name on the billing address.

TRY to get that part right, for I think they check on it.  It is usually a
good guess that the father pays the bills, but if you know the kid has a
single parent, well then you eliminate all confusion.  You'll need the
phonebook to check addresses and names of the people who are heads of the
household.  And you could probably even do without the book if you are
going to do it to someone you know.  If you choose a random name, the
phonebook is simple and available.
   Soon they'll ask you if you want to pick your pin number.  For God's
sake say YES.  But, DON'T PICK SOMETHING CUTE!!  If we have about 100 kids
calling up and saying they want their pin to be 2600, people might start
getting suspicious.  Especially if there are phreaks using this file that
are all concentrated in an area, which chances are there ARE going to be.
Pick a number that you WOULD probably pick as a pin if you had to.  Like
the first four digits of an OLD phone number. Remeber, you ARE going to
have to remeber the pin, cause you WON'T be getting the card.  And try not
to pick the same pin everytime.  It may not mean much, but why get lazy and
open up yourself to getting caught.  And go easy on the number of cards you
order.  You aren't really gonna get them, so don't be cute and say twenty.
Unless you really do WANT them for some reason of course by ordering them
to a vacationer's house (make sure the mail isn't being held at the post
office).  But they can't easily arrest you for what you have in your memory
while they can for what's in your wallet.
   As for the length of time to use the number...  The card will reach the
victim in about 21 days after you ordered it, after which they can call
Bell and say "Hey, I never asked for this".  And in the beginning you won't
be able to use the card for the first 3 days after you place the order;
until the card becomes active.  So you are left with 18 days.  I would
round down to two weeks for saftey's sake.  So basically, to make it
simple, 17 days after you make the initial call asking for the card, STOP
using the number.  Actually, that is just a recommended number.  If you
understood my math, figure on a good time for yourself.  If you wanted to
lengthen the time, have the cards sent to someone's house who you know will
not be home.  They won't be able to call Bell and say "I didn't order these
cards" until they get back and sift through their mail.  Even then they
might think its just a publicity stunt by the phone company (Last year AT&T
sent out like 13 million calling cards of which only about 3% were actually
requested), but why take the risk.  If you can, check to make sure the
people in the house don't get back early.
   The time you have to use the card CAN BE CUT SHORT depending upon when
you order it.  The best time, at least in my area, is like the last day of
the month.  After the three working days, I can call all over and the
person won't get the calls on their bill until next month.  I think you can
understand the dangers of starting your calling on like the 23rd of a month
and continuing its use for the full 17 days?  Halfway through your time,
the REAL owner of the card, the victim who gets it and the phonebill in his
mailbox, says "WHAT THE FUCK?  15 CALLS TO BULGARIA, AND 2 TO NAPAL?!?!?"
They call the phone company while you continue using the card in ignorant
bliss.  The phone company may allow you to place a nice little call during
which they send some cops over to the payphone you are using.
   And just as with beige boxing, be sure to tell your callees that they
MIGHT get a call from the phone company checking up on who called them,
because of course the numbers you dialed will appear on the bill so your
victim can complain about unmade calls.  Here is a little article I picked
by The Bootlegger about how to get around this...

STRIKE THE WAR MACHINE

NUFF SAID-
BOOTLEG

It is good to have some excuses ready just in case you get the call like
one day later in which you can't easily say, "I forgot who called me".
Lord Thunder wrote an article for 2600 in which he suggested that you say
you have an answering machine that doesn't hang up until the caller does,
and you got a long obscene message and you'd like to know who did it too.
But try to be original because SEVERAL other people have read that article
too (as the telco may by now know).  In general, keep the calls relatively
low since only excessive billing is generally checked into, and only call
people who know how to handle telco calls like the Bootlegger here.  Sorry,
your dear grandmother is probably out.
   Some final thoughts..

     o  You might wanna try ordering one for your house first, you aren't
        going to use it, but just so you know what you are going to be
        asked.

     o  I really don't know if companies other than Atlantic Bell offer
        these services, but I think if you wanted to you could social
        engineer youself a card even if you don't live on the Atlantic
        Coast.  Maybe if you said something like you are going to want a
        card to use once you get home from your vacation in Chicago (if
        that is where you are calling from).

     o  Try to make up your own excuses when you have to, and have
        them prepared. This goes for all aspects of phreaking.  I happen to
        be very good at on-the-spot lying, but some people aren't.  If you
        use the same excuses that are in this file or any others that you
        have read about for that matter, remeber other people may have seen
        it too.  In the case of what is printed in 2600, THOUSANDS of
        people have read that, so if you say the same thing that the
        companies have heard many times over, they'll get suspicious.  They
        won't have any proof, but why cause them to have any suspicion at
        all.
