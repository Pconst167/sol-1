   Look for my next file; How to Raid Your Local Central Office.

 The first step in making a raid on any Bell office is finding its location.
Generally, the bigger the metropolitan area, the more repair stations available
for the picking.  Repair stations are usually situated within or near
residentia

l areas.  If you don't know where any are, here are two ways to find out.

 1st: Call your Bell service representative and tell them that you are late
      paying your bill, and you would like to know where to go to pay it
      in person.  Take down the address.

 2nd: Drive around in neighborhoods until you find one.
      (Surprisingly, this works, I know of at least 5 I have found this way.)

 Once you have a location or address, you must determine if it is a CO or
 repair station.  This is fairly simple.  The following are the symptoms
 for each.

 Attributes for a CO (Central Office)

 1. Is usually 2 stories in heighth.
 2. Generally has a weird shape, resembling an inverted L atop another.
 3. If you peer within the windows you will see rows of switching equipment.
 4. Near the door entrance is a security keypad and doorbell.

    (If you feel you have found a CO you will just have to wait for my next
    file.)

 Attributes for a Repair Station

 1. Small one story building.
 2. Generally has a rectangular shape. (Longer than is wide.)
 3. Extended behind it is some form of fence enclosing a parking area.
 4. Often a large car port behind the building.
 5. 15-30 Bell Vans, Cars, and Trucks.

Once you have found a suitable repair station you must prepare yourself.
The following is a list of equipment I have found to be quite useful.

Equipment:

 Pair of gloves.                     (This is a must.)
 Snug, dark clothing.                (Be sure your clothes are well
                                     fitted, loose garments tend
                                     to get snagged on barbed-wire
                                     fences.)
 Book Bag.
 Small flashlight.
 Crowbar or tire tool.
 Walkie-Talkies                      (Optional, but nice to have.)
 Bolt Cutters                        (O                (Optional)

The gloves are obvious, you do not want your prints spread all over the nation.

Be sure to wear well fitting clothes, blue jeans and a dark t-shirt. Most of
the time you will be jumping a barbed wire fence, and it makes it a LOT easier.

The book bag is useful to put things in.  Once inside you will find all sorts
of manuals and paper-stuff that can get quite awkward to carry. Put it in here.
One nice thing to go for are roll-a-dex and other phone-pads, they usually
just leave these on their desks and they contain lots of good info.

A flashlight is useful for seeing in the dark.  Be sure not to point it at
any windows.

Crowbar or tire tools.  Sometimes the doors to the building are locked.
That's real easy to defeat with a crowbar.  Either jimmy the lock or smash
the window.  Use your discretion.

Walkie-talkies are useful if you and your partner are going to be in seperate
parts of the office, letting each know whats going on is quite important.

Bolt cutters are good for cutting the lock on the gates, if you do this,
you can walk or drive your car right in, then shut the gate and no one
will know.  Also, if you are going to be carrying heavy equipment out
(such as FAX machines, or Computers) it is much easier to cut the lock
on the gate than it is to drop the equipment over it.

Wire cutters are good because a lot of the time the fence surrounding the
place is chain link, just cut a hole near a bush.  Sometimes however
the fence is made of brick.  So that won't work all the time.


How to Get In:

Wait until 1am some night, (by then all the employees have gone home and
most of the neighbors have gone to sleep) and either walk or drive to
the station.  I suggest you drive.  When you get there park the car down the
street and walk the rest of the way.  There are 4 ways you can actually get
into the station, here they are.

 1. Throw the stuff over the fence and then climb it.
 2. Hide in a bush and cut a hole in the fence and then go through.
 3. Cut the lock on the gate, open it, go in, and close it.
 4. Throw the stuff over the fence and crawl in under the gate.
    (A lot of the time the clearence between the bottom of the fence and
    the ground is enough to let even the fattest of criminals get in this
    way.)

Once you are inside the fenced area, here is what to do.

What to do once inside:

1st: If the primary purpose for your visit is to get into the trucks,
     do this.  Obviously, check all the doors and windows.  Be sure
     to make sure the vehicles do not have alarms,  I have seen this
     rarely, but I have seen it.  On the trucks all the doors are locked
     by a single lock, merely cut it off with the bolt cutters and turn
     the lever, and all the doors will unlock.  The lock is located on
     the upper back, left or right side.

     Inside you can usually find handsets (beige boxes), phones, test sets.
     (And I mean the NICE kind) and other assorted odds and eds.  The
     GOOD stuff is inside the building.

2nd: If you are going for the o.
     You will be facing the back of the office, and will see anywhere
     from 3 to 5 doors.  Most of these are unlocked, but I'm sure some
     stations do lock them.
     Each room in the station has an exiting door, so that is why there
     are so many.  Check each door and if you find one unlocked open it and
     go in.  Once you get in look at the door and decide if you think it
     had an alarm on it, if it does, get out.  However, a  have NEVER
     scene an alarm in a bell station.  If the door happens to be locked
     try prying it with the crowbar, if that doesn't work you can either
     smash the glass (which you will have to do in most cases if you can't
     jimmy it, OR, if you are lucky, the room you want to get in to
     MIGHT be the one that is interconnected with another, which I will
     explain in a moment.)  Here is what you might find behind the
     respective doors:

         1. Store Room
             In this room is contained extra equipment.
             I have found manuals, mini-tv's, radio's, first-aid kits,
             gloves, helmets, jumpsuits, phone lines, etc, just about
             any Bell odd and end, in the store rooms.

         2. Break Room
             This is the break room, they ALWAYS have a coke-machine
             and a coffee-machine in there.  I usually have worked
             up a sewat by then, so what I do is this:  They have a coffee
             can with change in it, they are supposed to put a dime in
             everytime they get coffee.  I just take the change and put
             50 cents in the coke machine and take it easy for a few
             minutes.  There is almost always nothing of interest
             in this room.

         3. TTY & Printer Room
             This is a small room that contains a TTY and Printer (a larger
             version of the TTY) these were both made in about the 1800's
             and are too outdated for any phreaker/hacker use, however
             sometimes the printer is connected to a damn-nice modem.

         4. Work Office
             This is where they come for assignment, there are desks
             in here, get the roll-a-dexes! There arew DOZENS of manuals
             explaining everythings from COSMOS to USOC. (Universal
             Service Order Code).  They also have portable metal
             lockers here, they are easy to bust into and can contain
             anything.

         5. Bathroom
             You can usually get into here from the break room. However
             there is ANOTHER door at the other end, somY{times the put
             an easily movable locker in front of it.  The other door
             goes to the MAIN office (the one that is usually ALWAYS
             locked)

         6. MAIN Office.
             This is the playroom.  Here is what you can get from here.
               FAX Machines (If you can carr1.x it, TAKE IT, I did.)
               VCR's - TV's
               IBM Computers
               Printers (The normal kind)
               PASSWORDS!!!              
               And, best of all, and what I am using to create this file;
               Zenith supersPORT Laptop computer.
               (Check this out)
               Fully portable, 640k. Backlit LCD, 2 3.5 drives, ram disk,
               CGA, internal HAYES 2400 baud modem, FULL size screen,
               I hate those piece of shit with 10 columns and 4 lines
               (Radio Shit, you SUCK)
               Anyway, they are damn nice, fully IBM compatible, and
               I *love* mine.  They usually have 2 or 3 of these, too.
               So you and your friend dont have to fight over it.

             Take any of this stuff you want. A word about the passwords.
             The passwords are contained  in A. manuals sitting next
             to the computers, B. on the system software.
             So, grab the manuals sitting near the computers, grab the
             computer (hope the software is in it), or just grab the
             software (check in the computer)
             If it is on disk, it is contained within a script file
             (sorry commodore, IBM) load it up on an IBM, (disconnect)
             the phone, (so it wont dial out), and copy down everything
             it dodes for later user.  It will dial the particular
             computers access number, (COSMOS or LMOS) and then enter
             the passwords.  Usually via MICROLINK II.

Once you've got your goodies, how to get out.

   If you cut the lock on the gate, go out through the gate.
   If you cut a hole in the fence, go through it.
   If you jumped over, let a friend go over first, then hand it over.


Well, I hope this has been an informative tutorial, those Zenith
Laptops are the ULTIMATE hacking machines, believe me.  These are
tried and true methods here, I use them, I know they work.

Raiding a station is merely common sense and the lack of Bell ingenuity.
You would not believe how simple it is.  One place was down the road
from a Police Station, I was in it for 3 hours, did I get caught? Hell no.

Look for my next file, Raiding your Local CO, and how you can gain
new computers, phone lines, and other phun phone stuff for free.
