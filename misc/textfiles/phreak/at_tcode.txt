  INTRODUCTION:
 
     IN THIS SESSION, I WILL BRING FOURTH BELL'S IDENTIFICATION LETTER
CODES AND THE MEANING A LONG WITH EACH LETTER CODE.  THESE CODES ARE USED
IN ADDRESSING, BASIC LETTERS, FORMS, ORDER SHEETS, AND A LOT OF OTHER
ASSORTED DOCUMENTS.  THE CODES ARE USUALLY NO MORE THAN '4' LETTERS LONG,
THIS IS THE REASON THAT IF THEY WERE MUCH LONGER, A PERSON COULD'NT REALLY
CALL THEM CODES.
 
  ASSORTED INFORMATION:
 
     BELL'S LETTER CODES WILL BE USEFUL IN MANY WAYS.  FOR ONE, IF A PERSON
WOULD HAPPEN TO GET YOU HANDS OF SOME GOOD INFORMATION, WITH THE SOME PARTS
ENCODED WITH BELL'S IDENTIFICATION CODES, IT WOULD BE EASILY INDENTIFIED.
BUT MOST OF ALL AS I STATED BEFORE, THE CODES ARE USED IN LETTERS, FORMS,
AND ORDER SHEETS, FOR USE OF MAINLY BELL EMPLOYEES.  THIS IS REALLY FOR FASTER
READING, AND PROCESSING.  ALSO SAVES TIME, SPACE, AND MONEY, AND WE ALL KNOW
THESE FACTORS COME FIRST IN ANY BUSINESS.  FINALLY HERE ARE THE CODES...
