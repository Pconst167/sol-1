Well our mail boxes having been filling up with questions regarding this
series.  We will answer them all in future files.

Ok, now you have your payphone home.  What do you do with it.  Well, if
you want to make it work, you need to run up a five prong cable from
the phone line in your basement.  The outlet in the wall won't work.
Now, a two inch hole at the left front of it.  Remove the back panel
(as described in part 1)  and disconnect the wires coming out of it.
You will see them coming from silver screws.  Disconnect them all.  Now
make sure you know which screws they came from.

Now for some explaining.  You could just wire it up with the existing
wires, but then it will make tones, so we are going to rewire it.

You will need 10 heavy duty 7 inch wires for the next part.

If you don't want it to accept money, skip this part.

Take the 12 O'clock screw and connect it to the screw at the bottom of
the totalizer. You will have to push it through, then take the top
off, and connect it. Connect the 2 O'clock screw to the green wire on
the silver box. Just cut the green wire from the box and connect them.

Ok, now this is the part that makes them work. Take the silver box
which is hanging loose now (make sure the wires attached already don't
come loose), and attach your 10 wires to the screws on the phone. Now
starting at the left top of the silver box, hook the wires on counter
clockwise starting with 3 O'clock, excluding 12, 2, 2:30, and 4.

Now run the cable up through the bottom, and hook it to the front of the
silver box.  It should now work.

Ok, now to answer a question.  A MAD! reader wants to know if you could
trip the totalizer using a wire stuck up the coin slot.

MR. C0SMOS answers that it would be very hard because of the bends
involved, and metal in the way.  You might be able to if you used a
non-magnetic, very small, bendable rod.   Just keep going up, until you
encounter a small lever, then move it. It would take alot of patience.

Watch for part 4 soon.
