Section 1:how to open a payphone

An Atlantic Bell payphone is a heavily armored device.  It is designed
to withstand attempted theft and damage.  But as we found out in part 1,
we don't need to get through all the armor to phreak it.  All we need to
do is get to the wiring which is all located behind 3 easy to remove
panels. All that holds the front panel on is 3 or 4 bolts.  Just apply
sulfuric acid and in ten minutes or less they will come right out.
While you are waiting remove the other panels.  The top panel is held on
by two tight nuts.  A good pair of pliers will remove them.  Now the
back panel is the hardest to remove.  It is held together by a semi-
permanent solution.  On the newer AT&T credit and pay phones, an alarm
goes off when the back panel is removed.  The circuitry for it is
located in the top panel.  Look for a round box with 4 wires coming out.
Cut the first and second ones.  Now use sulfuric acid, wait ten minutes
and lift it off.

  Section 2:How to steal a payphone

Ever wanted to have your own payphone?  It's not very hard to steal one.
As a matter of fact, it is easy to rip one out of the wall, but I want
to show you how to take one home intact.  Anyone traveling to Toronto
should stop by to see MR. C0SMOS' collection of payphones.  He has them
set up and working.  Stealing payphones is very dangerous.  Much more
than phone boxing.  Do not steal more than one from an area.  They
sometimes know immediately when it's gone, so get the hell out of there.
The inside of it is heavily armored.  If you are taking it for the
money, you will need a full set of philips & flathead screwdrivers,
sulfuric acid, a crowbar, a sledgehammer, bolt cutters, and probably
more.  Now you can take it home and pound on it, or you can use the easy
way we showed you in part one.

In part 3 we will show you how to wire it up when you get it home and
alot of other stuff.
