  To all people who don't believe in giving the phone company 25 cents for a
call, or even a dime, this is for you.
 
  I don't know about the rest of the country but here in N.Y.C.  they have
armoured the pay-phones with steel plates surrounding the bottom half of the
phone.  This sheild will withstand any attack by M-80's, block-busters,
super-blockbusters, ash-cans, pineapples, etc......  (Except Dynamite) to
destroy this plating and most of the bottom half of the phone, use the
following device.
 
  First you must blow out the hing on the coin return slot.  This can be done
with most conventional weapons such as a block-buster.  Then, take a 6 inch
section of the same type of bendable metal tubing that surrounds the wire to
the reciever, but it must be at least 1 inch in diameter.
 
  Then, solder a piece of sheet metal on to one side of the tube to seal that
side.  Then fill the tube with the same flash-powder used in block-busters and
fill that end with strong epoxy to seal it.
 
  One thing I forgot to mention, before soldering the round peice of sheet
metal to the tube, drill a small hole in it just big enough to fit a peice of
demolition fuse through.  Then put the peice through before filling it.Seal the
edges of the fuse with the same epoxy used to seal the opposite end of the
tube.
 
  Then, when complete, shove the thing up into the coin slot with the epoxy end
going in first.
 
  Next thing you know you've got dimes, nickels, and quarters falling all
around you.
