THANKS TO MR. X OF A BELL COMPANY WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO DEFEAT MOST SURVEILLANCE
DEVICES USING BLUE/OMEGA BOXES.  THE BLUES RANGE IS VERY LIMITED, BUT THE OMEGA BOXES
COVERS MOST OF THEM.  SEE MAD!'S NEW OMEGA BOX HANDBOOK FOR MORE INFO.

  THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. 
 
ADS MONITORING TEST. 
 
ADS IS THE NEW TRACE/MONITORING TEST BEING USED BY AT&T, MCI, SOON SPRINT,  AND MORE. 
IT IS VERY FAST AND  ACCURATE, BUT IT HAS MANY MANY FAULTS. 
 
AFTER MUCH TESTING WE FOUND THAT IF YOU  DO A 7200 AND ADS IS ON THE LINE, A  VOLT METER
WILL GO GO CRAZY.  A SIMPLE  GOLD WILL MAKE A POP IF ADS IS ON THE  LINE.  FOR A LOT
MORE ON ADS SEE  MAD!'S UPCOMING DETECTING LINE TRACES. 
 
TAP TEST NUMBERS 
 
LATELY MAD! HAS AS BEEN SEEING ALOT OF  THOSE TAP TEST #'S.  OUR FRIENDS AT  THE PHONECOMPANY SAID THERE ARE SUCH  #'S, BUT THEY WILL ONLY DETECT CERTAIN  THINGS.  HERES A
SMALL LIST.  MAD! IS  NOT SURE IF THEY WORK, AND DIDN'T HAVE  TIME TO TEST THEM.  WE
WILL PRINT THE  RESULTS IN AN UPCOMING FILE.  IF THEY  DO, WE WILL PRINT ABOUT 25 OF
THEM. 
 
THIS CAME FROM SOMEONE NAMED HACKER  SMITH, BUT WERE NOT SURE WHAT SYSTEM. HERE IT IS...

 
I GOT A # TO SEE IF YOUR BEING TRACED.  WHEN YOU CALL IT USING YOUR PHREAKING 
SERVICE,YOU SHOULD HEAR A TONE THAT  GOES UP IN FREQUENCY,THAT MEANS YOUR  NOT BEING
TRACED. IF YOU HEAR A STEADY TONE, THEN YOUR BEING TRACED AN YOU'D  BETTER HANG UP IN
LESS THAN 30 SECONDS OR YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING  TRACED...THE # IS 617-890-9900. 
               ENJOY, 
                    HACKER SMITH 
 
ALSO YOU SEE THE NUMBER POSTED AROUND 200-XXX-XXXX.  THIS IS A ADS SYSTEM  USED BY BELL
LINEMEN FROM PHONE BOXES  (SEE THE MAD! FILE ON TEST PHONES FOR  INFO ON PHONE BOXING.). 
IT IS NOT A  TRACE TEST AT ALL. 
 
THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A DETECTING TAPS 3, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MORE  INFO WE GET. 
WATCH FOR DETECTING LINE  TRACES COMING SOON TO A BBS NEAR YOU.
