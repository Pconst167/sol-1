A C-NET COMPATABLE MAD! FILE. 
 
DETECTING LINE TAPS 
PART #1 
 
THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING FILE IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. 
IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN OR THE MENTALLY UNBALANCED.  THE AUTHORS OF THIS FILE TAKE NO
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF ITS CONTENTS. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION BY THE COMMODORE KID. 
 
WITH THE FBI WATCHING US ALL THE TIME, YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE IF ITS SAFE TO SAY
SOMETHING.  EVEN IF YOUR NOT INTO GOOD STUFF, ITS STILL NICE TO KNOW THAT YOUR THE ONLY
ONE ON THE PHONE.  YOU DON'T WANT YOUR SISTER LISTENING IN ON YOU.  IT IS ALSO WELL
KNOWN THAT ALOT OF THE MAJOR BBS'S ARE BEING  MONITORED BY THE FEDS.  WELL, WE HOPE 
THAT THE INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE  WILL ALLOW YOU TO FEEL SAFER ON YOUR  TELEPHONE. 
 
 
 
MOST TELEPHONE SURVEILLANCE DEVICES USED ON HACKERS NUMBERS ARE VERY SIMPLE.  THEY
USUALLY SAVE THE GOOD STUFF FOR SPYS AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
IF THE GOOD STUFF IS ON, BUT WE HAVE LISTED WAYS TO DETECT SOME OF THE CHEAPER MACHINES,
AND IN SOME CASES HOW TO SHUT THEM OFF OR SCREW THEM UP. 
 
THE MLT-2.  THIS DEVICE IS ONE OF THE MAINSTAYS OF BS (BELL SECURITY).  ITS MAIN
WEAKNESS IS IN THAT GIVE TONES TO DO ITS OPERATION.  A FRIEND OF MAD!'S IS CURRENTLY
WORKING ON A DEVICE HE PLANS TO CALL A PURPLE BOX THAT WILL DETECT THESE TONES.  YOU
WILL JUST BE ABLE TO KEEP IT ON, AND IT WILL REPORT ON ANY SUCH TONES.  WE WILL KEEP
YOU UPDATED IN FUTURE FILES.  OK, IF THE MLT-2 IS IN MON (MONITOR) MODE, YOU CAN DO THE
FOLLOWING: A GOOD OLD LOUD 2600HZ WILL USUALLY SWITCH IT TO LOOP MODE.  SOME TIMES A
7200 WILL EXECUTE A TT (DIAL MODE).  THESE WILL GET THEM OFF YOUR BACK FOR A WHILE. 
IF YOU OWN A MLT-2 ALSO, YOU CAN DAMAGE THE OTHER MLT-2.  FIRST GET THE OTHER MLT-2 INTO
LOOP MODE.  NOW WAIT TILL IT GETS TO LIN (TEST THE INSIDE PART OF THE LOOP).  NOW DO
A K2.  THIS WILL PUT THE MLT-2 INTO A STATE OF LIMBO.  NOW TO FINISH UP, DO A MLT SOAK
TEST.  THIS WILL PUT THE OFFENDING MACHINE OUT OF COMMISSION FOR A LITTLE WHILE.  IF
YOU HAVE AN OMEGA BOX (NICE LITTLE  THINGS), A FLAT TONE WILL PUT THE MLT-2 INTO A LRM
(FAST LOOP MEASUREMENT), THUS GETTING IT OFF YOUR LINE). 
 
 
CONDUCTER TAGGER AND ANALYZER TEST. 
 
THIS WILL SHOW YOU APPROXAMATLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON A LINE. FIRST YOU NEED TO HOOK
A VOLT/OHMS METER UP TO THE PHONE BOX IN YOUR WALL.  HOOK THE LINE AND THE GROUND UP
TO THE RED AND GREEN WIRES.  YOU CAN USE ONE MADE FOR IT, OR YOU CAN MODITY THE KIND
YOU USE TO CHECK BATTERYS BY PUTTING ALIGATOR CLIPS ON IT. NOW THE VOLT METER WILL RISE
AN FALL DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE PICK UP THE PHONE, AND HOW GOOD THE CONNECTION IS. 
IF YOUR SISTER PICKS UP THE PHONE, IT WILL FALL.  IT PICKS UP OPERATORS, AND WHATEVER. 
MOST OF THE CHEAPER TAPPING MACHINES WILL BE DETECTABLE.  TAPE RECORDERS CAN ALSO BE
DETECTED.  EVEN A PERSON ON A TEST PHONE WILL SHOW UP.  ITS A GREAT TOOL.  TRY USINGIT ON CONFERENCES SOME TIME. 
 
IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS (OR ENEMYS) THAT LIKE TO LISTEN TO THEIR PHONE  CONVERSATION OUT
A PHONE BOXES WITH  TEST PHONE THERES SOMETHING YOU CAN DO  ABOUT IT.  THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION COMES FROM ABBIE HOFFMAN AND GEORGE HAYDUKE IN THE CLASSIC BOOK 'GETTING
EVEN' THE COMPLETE BOOK OF DIRTY TRICKS. 
 
CUT THE FEMALE END OFF AN ORDINARY EXTENSION CORD.  UNSCREW THE MOUTHPIECE ON THE
TELEPHONE.  YOU WILL SEE A TERMINAL FOR A RED WIRE AND ONE FOR A BLACK.  ATTACH ONE OF
THE WIRES FROM THE EXTENSION CORD TO THE RED, AND ONE TO THE BLACK.  NOW PLUG THE
EXTENSION CORD INTO A POWER SOCKET. ACCORDING TO HOFFMAN YOU ARE SENDING 20 VOLTS OF
ELECTRICITY BACK THROUGH EQUIPMENT MADE FOR 6 VOLTS.  FIZZ. 
 
 
NOTE! MAD! SUGGESTS YOU DO NOT TRY THIS.  IT IS NOT RESPONSIBLY FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO
PHONE EQUIPMENT, OR TO YOU.  ACTUALLY YOU WOULD BE SENDING 110 VOLTS THROUGH EQUIPMENT
MADE FOR 48.  IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THIS, WE SUGGEST YOU GET A
TRANSFORMER TO STEP THE VOLTAGE LEVEL DOWN. 
 
 
 
ANY INFOMATION THAT IS PASSED OVER PHONE LINE CAN BE INTERCEPTED BY THE PHONE COMPANY. 
THIS INCLUDES MODEM SIGNALS.  REMEMBER, THEY INVENTED ALL THAT STUFF.  IN PART TWO WE
WILL EXAMINE WAYS TO STOP THEM FROM MONITORING BBS'S AND EXAMINE OTHER EQUIPMENT.
