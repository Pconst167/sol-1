     HERE IS SOME INFO ON PHONE TAPS.
I HAVE ENCLOSED A SCHEMATIC FOR A SIMPLE
WIRETAP & INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOOKING UP
A TAPE RECORDER CONTROL RELAY TO THE
PHONE LINE.
     FIRST I'LL DISCUSS TAPS A LITTLE.
     THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF
TAPS.  THERE ARE TRANMITTERS, WIRED TAPS
AND INDUCTION TAPS TO NAME A FEW.  
WIRED AND WIRELESS TRANSMITTERS MUST 
BE PHYSICALLY CONNECTED TO THE LINE
BEFORE THEY'LL DO ANY GOOD.  
     ONCE A WIRELESS TAP IS CONNECTED 
TO THE LINE, IT CAN TRANSMIT ALL 
CONVERSATIONS OVER A LIMITED RANGE.
THE PHONES IN THE HOUSE CAN EVEN BE
MODIFIED TO PICK UP CONVERSATIONS IN
THE ROOM & TRANSMIT THEM TOO!  THESE
TAPS ARE USUALLY POWERED OFF THE PHONE
LINE, BUT CAN HAVE AN EXTERNAL POWER
SOURCE.
     WIRED TAPS, ON THE OTHER HAND,
NEED NO POWER SOURCE, BUT A WIRE MUST
BE RUN FROM THE LINE TO THE LISTENER
OR TO A TRANSMITTER.  THERE ARE 
OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF WIRELESS TAPS
OVER WIRED ONES.  THERE IS ONE TYPE
OF WIRELESS TAP THAT LOOKS LIKE A
NORMAL TELEPHONE MIKE.  ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MIKE
WITH THIS & IT'LL TRANSMIT ALL 
CONVERSATIONS!
    THERE IS AN EXOTIC TYPE OF WIRED
TAP KNOWN AS THE 'INFINITY TRANSMITTER'
OR 'HARMONICA BUG'.  IN ORDER TO HOOK
UP ONE OF THESE, YOU NEED ACCESS TO THE
TARGET TELEPHONE.  IT HAS A TONE 
DECODER & SWITCH INSIDE.  WHEN IT IS 
INSTALLED, SOMEONE CALLS THE TAPPED
PHONE & *BEFORE* IT RINGS, BLOWS A
WHISTLE OVER THE LINE.  THE X-MITTER
RECEIVES THE TONE & PICKS UP THE PHONE
VIA A RELAY.  THE MIKE ON THE PHONE IS
ACTIVATED SO THE CALLER CAN HEAR ALL
CONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM.
     THERE IS A SWEEP TONE TEST AT
415/BUG-1111 WHICH CAN BE USED TO 
DETECT ON OF THESE TAPS.  IF ONE OG
THESE IS ON YOUR LINE & THE TEST #
SENDS THE CORRECT TONE, YOU'LL HEAR A
CLICK.
     INDUCTION TAPS HAVE ONE BIG 
ADVANTAGE OVER TAPS THAT MUST BE
PHYSICALLY WIRED TO THE PHONE.  THEY
DON'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE PHONE
IN ORDER TO PICK UP THE CONVERSATION.
THEY WORK ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS
THE LITTLE SUCTION-CUP TAPE RECORDER
MIKES YOU CAN GET AT RADIO SHACK.
INDUCTION MIKES CAN BE HOOKED UP TO
A TRANSMITTER OR BE WIRED.
     HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF INDUSTRIAL
ESPIONAGE USING THE PHONE:
     A SALESMAN WALKS INTO AN OFFICE
& MAKES A FONE CALL.  HE FAKES THE
CONVERSATION, BUT WHEN HE HANGS UP
HE SLIPS SOME FOAM-RUBBER CUBES UNDER
THE HANDSET, SO THE FONE IS STILL OFF
THE HOOK.  THE CALLED PARTY CAN STILL
HEAR ALL CONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM.
WHEN SOMEONE PICKS UP THE FONE, THE
CUBES FALL AWAY UNNOTICED.
     I USE A TAP ON MY LINE TO 
MONITOR WHAT AE-PRO IS DOING WHEN IT
AUTO-DIALS, SINCE IT DOESN'T TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE HANDSET ON THE APPLE
CAT II.  I CAN ALSO HOOK UP THE TAP
TO A CASSETTE RECORDER OR AMPLIFIER.
HERE IS THE SCHEMATIC:
-------)!----)!(------------->
             )!(
 CAP ^       )!(
             )!(
             )!(
             )!(
     ^^^^^---)!(------------->
       ^  100K
       !
       !<INPUT
THE 100K POT IS USED FOR VOLUME. 
IT SHOULD BE ON ITS HIGHEST (LEAST
RESISTANCE) SETTING IF YOU HOOK A
SPEAKER ACROSS THE OUTPUT, BUT IT
SHOULD BE SET ON ITS HIGHEST RESISTANCE
FOR A TAPE RECORDER OR AMPLIFIER.  YOU
MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO ADD ANOTHER
10-40K.  THE CAPACITOR SHOULD BE 
AROUND .47 MFD.  IT'S ONLY PURPOSE IS
TO PREVENT THE RELAY IN THE CO
FROM TRIPPING & THINKING YOU HAVE THE
FONE OFF THE HOOK.  THE AUDIO OUTPUT
TRANSFORMER AVAILABLE AT RADIO SHACK
(273-1380) IS FINE FOR THE X-FORMER.
THE BLACK & GREEN ARE FINE FOR INPUT
& THE RED & WHITE GO TO THE OUTPUT
DEVICE.  YOU MAY WANT TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THE X-FORMER FOR THE BEST OUTPUT.
     HOOKING UP A TAPE RECORDER 
CONTROL RELAY IS EAST.  JUST ONE
OF THE FONE WIRES (USU. RED) BEFORE
THE TELEPHONES & HOOK ONE END TO ONE
WIRE OF THE RELAY & THE OTHER END TO
THE OTHER RELAY WIRE.  LIKE THIS:
------^^^^^^^^^------------
      ---------
      RELAY^^
275-004 FROM RADIO SHACK WORKS FINE.

     IF YOU THINK YOUR LINE IS TAPPED,
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO PHYSICALLY
INSPECT THE LINE YOURSELF ESP. THE
PHONES.  YOU CAN GET MIKE REPLACEMENTS
WITH 'BUG DETECTORS' BUILT IN, BUT I
WOULDN'T TRUST THEM TOO MUCH.  IT'S
TOO EASY TO GET A PHONY READING.
