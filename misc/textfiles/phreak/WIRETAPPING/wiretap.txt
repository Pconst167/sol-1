And here are the references, which I have also sent to Denning as mail:


      Following are the citations for the 1976 study.  Any depository
library should have these materials on microfiche.  Check fiche
Y 3.W 74/2:2 H 35/v.1-2.  

      You can find further materials on this subject by using the 
CD-ROM database available at all depository libraries.  Just try
"WIRETAPPING" as a keyword.  Ten minutes should give you the references
here plus others. 

      There is an Office of Technology Assessment study dated 1985 which
you might find of interest, since you have been complaining that the 
1976 study is too old.  This is "Surveilance - historical policy review
(Technical proposal US 84-10/12)" by Herman Schwartz, U.S. Congress, 
Office of Technology Assessment, 1985.  Again, this can be found in any
depository library, at fiche Y 3.T 22/2:2 Su 7/3.  Pages 89-90 cite
illegal wiretapping by law enforcement organizations including the NYPD,
the Houston police (testimony by Carrol Lynn, Chief of Police, Houston TX,
hearings on wiretapping, before Subcommitee on Courts, Civil Liberties,
of House Judiciary Committee, 94th Cong., 1st sess., at 406 (1975))
the Chicago police, the Pensylvania State Police, the New Haven police, 
(NYT, Jan 25, 1977, p. 37) and the Williamsport (PA) police.  More detailed
citations are available in the report.  And these are only the ones that 
surfaced in press reports or Congressional testimony.

      Bear in mind that criminal activity by law enforcement tends not to
be talked about.  Yet we do see considerable evidence that such illegal 
wiretapping does go on.
