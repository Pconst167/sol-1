               AUTOMATICE LINE TESTERS - S.A.L.T.

GENERAL
-------

The S.A.L.T. (Subscriber Automatic Line Tester) is installed in exchanges to 
provide automatic testing facilities for telephones and line conditions on 
exchange services.
After clearing the fault it is neccessary to test the complete telephone 
service including the insulation resistance on the line to earth and between 
the pair, the bell and dial operation.
Access to the  S.A.L.T. testing equipment is obtained by dialing the special 
number allotted to the particualr exchange. It is only neccessary to obtain 
access to the S.A.L.T. tester once. All subsequent tests may be made by 
dialing the code digit for that test. The following tests may be preformed in 
any order or independantly of each other without the need to release the 
tester.

TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO S.A.L.T. TESTER
-----------------------------------

Dial the access code number for the particular exchange.

* If the tester is free ring tone will be heard.
* If no tone is heard wait for busy tone, hang up and try again.
* If the tester becomes free while waiting, ring tone will be heard.

Hang up and wait for telephone bell to ring ( About 4 seconds ).

Lift receiver on ring back. If dial tone is heard the circuit is ready for 
testing to proceed.

The S.A.L.T. is released when the handset is replaced after a test.

INSULATION RESISTANCE TESTS  A> A TO B  B> A AND B TO EARTH
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a combination test which tests both the insulation resistance between 
the pair and the insulation resisitance to earth.

Dial 5 and listen for ring tone.
Hang up and wait for telephone bell to ring.
Lift receiver on ring back.
Listen to tone :

* 900 Hz    = Line OK (I * R Over 1Mê)
* Busy Tone = Line Faulty (I * R between 0.5Mê and 1Mê)
* NU Tone   = Line Faulty (I * R below 0.5Mê)

If the service fails this test, use code digits 6 and/or 7 to isolate the 
problem.

INSULATION RESISTANCE, A TO EARTH AND B TO EARTH
------------------------------------------------

Dial 6 and LIsten for ring tone.
Continue as for Insulation resistance tests. (Code digit 5)

INSULATION RESISTANCE, A TO B
-----------------------------

Dial 7 and LIsten for ring tone.
Continue as for Insulation resistance tests. (Code digit 5)

LINE LOOP RESISTANCE TEST
-------------------------

Dial 8.
Listen to tone :

* 900 Hz    = Line OK
* Busy Tone = Loop resistance too high
* NU Tone   = Loop resistance 200ê or less.  

DIAL TEST
---------

Dial 1 and listen for ring tone, then dial "0".
Listen to tone :

* 0.5 seconds 900 Hz tone then ring tone = Dial OK.
* NU Tone = Pulse Faulty (Replace)

BELL TEST (FULL VOLTAGE)
------------------------

Dial 4 and Listen for ring tone.
Hang up and ring back in 4 to 5 seconds.
Lift receiver to trip ring.

BELL TEST (HALF VOLTAGE)
------------------------

Dial 4 and Listen for ring tone.
Continue as for full voltage test.

TEST CONTROL FOR S.A.L.T.

Dial 9 and listen for dial tone, which indicates that the testing equipment is 
functioning correctly. This test may be done at anytime time after access to 
the S.A.L.T. has been obtained. Hang up to release the testing equipment.
