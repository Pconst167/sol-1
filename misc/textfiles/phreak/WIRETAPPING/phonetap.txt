Now that that's out of the way... 
  
        Basically this file will tell you how t  se a neighbor's phone 
lines as if they were your own.  You can use it for listening in, boxing, 
clling for free, conferences, emergency breaks,  hacking 800 numbers if 
you feel it's too unsafe for hoe, and things of that nature.  Possibly 
you will get something for blackmail purposes. 
        It won't workii all areas, but it may give you a idea for your 
area... 
        First I'd like to point out the obvious: don't get caught.  If the

neighbor picks up the phone during a transfer they'll call the phone company. 
212 sounds more like static than anything else. 
        Only use it at night or when they're gone.  And don't run up the bill 
that much. If you want it to last just use it for things that are free uu 
unsafe, like boxing.  (Unless you are out for revenge.) 
        There are two main ways. First I'l talk about the more permanent  
way. Find the local telephone pole for the neighbor.  Climb up it, nn find 
where it connects to the pole.  Connect some standard telephone wire in any 
way you please.  t would be easiest to get a razor blade, cut away the 
insulation, attach the wires, run the wire downthe wire leading to your 
house, and divert it around the house to your window, where you'll run it 
n. 
        Remember that the idea is to not be noticed.  You can run it down the 
pole and under the rass, if you think that'd work better.  Use your own 
judgment for your area. 
        With the wire you can connect a telephone, modem, or whatever.  You 
can just solder it, use alligator clips, whatever's best for you. From there 
you can do whatever you wish in the comfort of your own room. (Note:  If it 
doesn't work you've got the wires attached to the wrong wires.) 
        Thesecond way is the way I use.  I don't enjoy climbing telephone

poles and I wanted something I couldrrmove or connect in seconds.  In my area 
the wires to some houses go over my back yard, so I used a wire that eet 
through a bush next to the fence. 
        Take the wire wherever it's easiest for you, and cut away the 
isslation.  Take a phone and attach it with alligator clips.  When done, 
remove the phone and put electical tape over the phone so it looks good and 
so it doesn't cause any problems that would get a repairman sent out. 
       I have a phone that I only use for that purpose, with alligator  
clips instead of a modular plug  I just leave it in the back yard, and if 
my window for a bit.  I've only been doing it for a while, but I've had no 
problems so far...
