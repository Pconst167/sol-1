If you decide to anyway, and get caught, it could cost youup to 5 years of your life and $10,000. This, you are allassuming means that if you tap someone eles's line, you will bepunished....wrong! You can't tap your own line either. Thepunishment for this is probably no more than a slap on the hand,that is if they actually catch you, but it's a good thing toknow..............now on to the fun.....                       PART II: TAPPINGverone has at sometime wanted to hear what a friend, theprincipal, the prom queen, or a nighbor has to say on the phone.There are several easy ways to tap into a phone line. None of themethods that I present will involve actully entering the house.You can do everything from the backyard. I will discuss fourmethods of tapping a line. They go in order of increasingdifficulty.1. The " beige box ": a beige box (or bud box) is actually betterknown as a "lineman" phone. They are terribly simple toconstruct, and are basically the easiest method to use. Theyconsist of nothing more than a phone with the modualr plug thatgoes into the wall cut off, and two alligator clips attached tothe red and green wires. The way to use this box, is to ventureinto the yard of the person you want to tap, and put it onto hisline. This is best done at the bell phone box that is usuallynext to the gas meter. It should only have one screw holding itshut, and is very easily opened. Once you are in, you should see4 screws with wires attached to them. If the house has one line,then clip the red lead to the first screw, and the green to thesecond. you are then on  the "tappie's" phone. You will hear anyconversation going on. I strongly recomend that you remove thespeaker from the phone that your using so the "tappie" can'thear evcery sound you make. If the house has two lines, then thesecond line is on screws three and four. If you connecteverything right, but you dont get on the line, then you probablyhave the wire's backward. Swich the red to the second screw andthe green to the first. If no conversation is going on, you mayrealize that you cant tap the phone very well because you don'twant to sit there all night, and if you are on the phone, thenthe poor tappie can't dial out, and that could be bad...so.......method two.2. The recorer: This method is probably the most widespread, andyou still don't have to be a genius to do it. There are LOTS ofways to tape conversations. The two easiest are either to put a"telephone induction pickup" (radio shack $1.99) on the biege boxyou were using, then pluging it into the microphone jack of asmall tape recoder, and leaving it on record. Or pluging therecorder right into the line. This can be done by taking awalkman plug, and cutting off the earphones, then pick one of thetwo earphone wires, and strip it. There should be another wireinside the one you just stripped. Strip that one too, and attachaligators to them. Then follow the biege box instructions to tapethe conversation. In order to save tape, you may want to use avoice activated recorder (Radio shack $59), or if your recorderhas a "remote" jack, you can get a "telephone recorder control"at Radio shack shack for $19 that turns the recorder on when thephone is on, and off when the phone is off. This little box plugsright into the wall (modularly of course), so it is best NOT toremove the modular plug for it. Work around it if you can. Ifnot, then just do you best to get a good connection. Whenrecording, it is good to keep your recorder hidden from sight (inthe bell box if possible), but in a place easy enough to changetapes from. The wireless microphone: this is the BUG. It transmitts asignal from the phone to the radio (Fm band). You may remember Mrmicrophone (from kaytel fame), these wireless mirophones areavailible from radio shack for $19. They are easy to build andeasy to hook up. There are so many differant models, that is isalmost imposible to tell you exactly what to do. The most commonthing to do, is to cut off the microphone element, and attachthese two wires to screws one and two. the line MIGHT, dependingon the brand, be "permenently off hook" this is bad, but byphucking around with it for a while, you should get it working.There are two drawbacks to using this method. One, is that thepoor asshole who is getting his phone tapped might hear himselfon "FM 88, the principal connnection". The second problem is therange. The store bought transmitters have a VERY short range. Isuggest that you build the costomized version I will present inpart four (it's cheaper too). Now on to the best of all themethods....4. The "easy-talks": This method combines all the best aspects ofall the the other methods. It only has one drawback... You need aset of "Easy-tylk" walkie talkies. They are voice activated, andcost about $59. You can find em at toystores, and "hi-tech"catalogs. I think that any voice activated walkie talkies willwork, but I have only tried the easy-talks. First, you have todecide on one for the "tramsmitter" and one for the "reciever".It is best to use the one with the strongest transmition totrasmitt, even though it may recieve better also. Desolder thespeaker of the "transmitter", and the microphone of the"reciever". now, go to the box. put the walkie talkie on "VOX"and hook the microphone leads (as in method three) to the firstand second screws in the box. Now go home, and listen on yourwalkie talkie. if nothing happens, then the phone signal wasn'tstrong enough to "activate" the transmission. If this happensthere are two things you can do. One, add some ground lines tothe  microphone plugs. This is the most inconspicuous, but if itdesn't work then you need an amplifier, like a walkman with twoearphone plugs. Put the first plug on the line, and then into oneof the jacks. Then turn the voulume all the way up (w/outpressing play). Next connect the second earphone plug to the micewires, and into the second earphone outlet on the walkman. nowput the whole mess in the box, and lock it up. This should do thetrick. It gives you a private radio station to listen to them on,you can turn it off when something boring comes on, and you cantape off the walkie talkie speaker that you have!               PART IV: WIRELESS TRANSMITTER PLANZis is a tiny transmitter that consists on a one colpittsoscillator that derives it's power from the phone line. Since theit puts on the line is less than 100 ohms, it has noeffect on the telephone performance, and can not be detected bythe phone company, or the tappie. Since it is a low-powereddevice using no antenna for radiation, it is legal to the FCC.(That is it complies with part 15 of the FCC rules andregulations). It, however is still illeagal to do, it's just thatwhat your using to do it is legal. This is explained later inpart 15... "no person shall use such a device for evesdroppingunless authorized by all parties of the conversation" (then it'snot evesdropping is it?). What this thing does,is use four diodesto form a "bridge rectifier". It produces a varying dc voltagevarieng with the auto-signals on the line. That voltage is usedto supply the the voltage for the oscillator transistor. Which isconected to a radio circuit. From there, you can tune it to anyzhannel you want. The rest will all be explianed in a minute....PARTS LISTem                |              description-----------------------------------------------------------------C1                  | 47-Pf ceramic disk capaciterC2,C3               | 27-Pf mica capaciterCR1,CR2,CR3,CR4     | germanium diode 1n90 or equivalentR1                  | 100 ohm, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistorR2                  | 10k, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistorR3                  | .7k, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistorL1                  | 2 uH radio frequency choke (see text)L2                  | 5 turns No.20 wire (see text)Q1                  | Npn rf transistor 2N5179 or equivalent-----------------------------------------------------------------1 may be constructed by winding approximately 40 turns of No. 36enamal wire on a megohm, 1/2 watt resistor. The value of L1 isnot critical. L2 can be made by wrapping 5 turns of No. 20 wirearound a 1/4 inch form. After the wire is wrapped, the form canbe removed. Just solder it into place on the circuit board. Itshould hold quite nicely. Also be sure to position Q1 so that theEmmiter, Base, and collector are in the proper holes. Theschmatic should be pretty easy to follow.

You can change the frequency at will, and you caneasily record off your radio.                  PART FIVE: HELPFULL HINTSFirst of all, With method one, the beige box, you may notice thatyou can also dial out on the phone you use. I don't recomend thatyou do this. If you decide to anyway, and do somethingconspicuous like set up a 30 person conferance for three hours,then I suggest that you make sure the people are either out oftown or dead. In general when you tap a line, you must becarefull. I test everything I make on my line first, then installit late at night. I would not recoment that you leave a recorderon all day. Put it on when you want it going, and take it offwhen your done. As far as recording goes, I think that if thereis a recorder on the line it sends a sporatic beep back to thephone co. I know that if you don't record directly off the line(i.e off your radio) then even the most sophisticated equipmentcan't ell that your recording. Also, make sure that when youinstall something the people are NOT on the line. Installationtends to make lots of scrachy sounds, clics and static. It isgenerally a good thing to avoid. It doesn't take too muchintelligence to just make a call to the house before you go toinstall the thing. If it's busy then wait a while. (This ofcourse does not apply if you are making a "midnight run").All in all, if you use common sense, and are *VERY* Carefull,chances are you wont get cought. Never think that yourunstopable, and don't braodcast what your doing. Keep it toyourself, and you can have a great time.                      -[ OVERLORD ]-The CircleLordTARAN KINGight Lightninghe Forest Ranger-80 systemswatch for more advanced tapping, how they catch you, andverification in the near future.DOWNLOADED FROM P-80 SYSTEMS                                                                                    
