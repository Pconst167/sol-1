                     AUTOMATIC LINE TESTERS - A.P.R.

GENERAL
-------

The A.P.R. is installed in exchanges to provide automatic testing facilities 
for telephones and line conditioners on exchange services. After clearing a 
fault it is necessary to test the complete telephone service including the 
insulation resistance of the line to earth and between the pair, the bell and 
dial operation. Access to the A.P.R. testing equipment is obtained by dialing 
the special number allotted to the particular exchange. It is only necessary 
to gain access to the A.P.R. tester once. All subsequent tests may be made by 
dialing the code digit for that test. Tests listed below may be preformed in 
any order or independantly of each other without the need to release the 
tester.

OBTAIN ACCESS TO A.P.R. TESTER
------------------------------

Dial access code number for the particular exchange.

* If tester is free ring tone will be heard immediately.
* If no tone is heard then WAIT for busy tone, hang up and try again.
* If while waiting the tester becomes free, ring tone will be heard.

Hang up and wait for the telephone bell to ring (about 4 seconds).
Lift reciever on ring back. If A.P.R. tone (900hz) is heard, the circuit is 
ready to proceed with testing.
The A.P.R. is released when the handset is replaced after a test.

INSULATION TEST (A TO EARTH)
----------------------------

Obtain access to A.P.R. tester.
Dial 5 , Listen for Busy Tone.
Hang up and wait for telephone bell to ring.
Lift receiver on ring back.
listen for tone :

* Dial tone = Line OK (I * R over 1 Mê [ohm]).
* NU tone   = Line faulty (I * R 0.5Mê to 1Mê).
* Ring tone = Line faulty (I * R under 0.5Mê).

INSULATION TEST (B TO EARTH)
----------------------------

Dial 6 and listen for busy tone.
Continue as for Insulation test A to Earth.

INSULATION RESISTANCE (A TO B)
------------------------------

Dial 7 and Listen for busy tone.
Continue as for Insulation test A to Earth.

LINE LOOP RESISTANCE
--------------------

Dial 8.
Listen to tones :

* NU tone   = line OK.
* Dial tone = Loop resistance too high.
* Ring tone = Loop resistance 200ê or less.

DIAL TEST (SPEED)
-----------------

Dial 1 then 0.
Listen to tone :

* NU tone   = Dial speed OK.
* Dial tone = Dial fast (Replace).
* Ring tone = Dial slow (Replace).

DIAL TEST (RATIO)
-----------------

* NU tone   = Dial Ratio OK.
* Dial tone = Ratio high (Replace).
* Ring tone = ratio low (Replace).

BELL OPERATION (FULL VOLTAGE)
-----------------------------

Dial 3 and listen for busy tone.
Hang up and ringing commences in 4 to 5 seconds.
Lift receiver to trip ring.

BELL OPERATION (HALF VOLTAGE)
-----------------------------

Dial 4 and listen for busy tone.
Continue as for Full voltage test.

TESTING CONTROL OF A.P.R.
-------------------------

Dial 0 and listen for A.P.R. tone (900Hz), which indicates that the testing 
equipment is functioning correctly. This test may be done at any time after 
access to A.P.R. tester.

Hang up to release testing equipment.
