 THIS FILE IS TO SHOW ALL YOU BORED LOSERS HOW TO LISTEN TO PEOPLES PHONE
CONVERSATIONS.  BASICLY YOU NEED A CORDLESS TELEPHONE AND A T.V. PERFERABLE A
TV WITH A CHANNEL DIAL INSTEAD OF AN ELECTRIC.  ANYWAYS, BE SURE THE PHONE IS
CHARGED ECT.;  YOU'LL NEED TO PUT YOUR CHANNEL TO 81-83 ON YOUR T.V. THEN GRAB
YOUR PORTO AND GET IT NEAR THE T.V.  YOU SHOULD START TO HEAR SOME FEEDBACK AND
THEN VOILA!  PEOPLE TALKING THROUGH YOUR T.V. LOUD AND CLEAR..  FOOL AROUND
WITH THE T.V. A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET LIKE A GUY CALLING SOME PORNO
LINE OR TALKING ABOUT A ROBBERY THEY MADE.  BASICLY YOU SHOULD AT LEAST GET CAR
PHONES AND CB.. AND RESIDENT LINES TOO.  I HAVEN'T TRIED IT ON ANYTHING BUT A
CHANNEL DIAL WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE OLD DIALS THAT YOU TURN TO CHANGE THE
CHANNEL INSTEAD OF THE MODERN T.V. WITH THE ELECTRIC SELECTOR.  APPARENTLY IT
SEEMS THAT YOUR T.V. IS PICKING UP PHONE WAVES FROM YOUR WIRE OR PHONE COMPANY;
ANTENNA.  BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK AS LONG AS IT WORKS.  ONCE A FRIEND AND I PICKED
UP A CONVERSATION WITH THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE INTO PACIFIC BELL WHICH WAS NEWS IN
THIS AREA.  IT WAS GETTING INTERESTING EXCEPT THE LINE KEPT DRIFTING AWAY.
HAVE PHUN!

     SO, YOU HAVE AN ENEMY WHO TALKS BEHIND YOUR BACK, EH? OR, MAYBE YOU JUST
WOULD LIKE TO "LISTEN" IN ON YOUR FRIEND'S CONVERSATIONS? WELL, IF YOU HAVE 2
PHONE LINES AND CALL WAITING ON ONE OF THEM, YOU ARE IN LUCK. (ONLY ONE
PROBLEM: YOUR FRIEND MUST ALSO HAVE CALL WAITING!)

PROCEDURE:

[1]  CALL UP YOUR FRIEND WITH THE PHONE YOU WANT TO LISTEN WITH.  WHEN HE
ANSWERS CALL WAITING (HE'S ALREADY ON THE PHONE, AND YOU ARE THE 2ND CALLER),
THEN YOU EITHER SIT THERE OR SAY: SORRY, I HAVE THE WRONG #.

[2]  NEXT, YOU WAIT UNTIL HE GOES BACK TO THE OTHER LINE (PUTS YOU ON HOLD).

[3]  THEN, PICK UP YOUR OTHER LINE AND CALL ->YOUR<- CALL WAITING.

[4]  ANSWER CALL WAITING

[5]  THEN GO BACK TO HIM. (ANSWER, AND THEN CLICK BACK.. CLICK ->2<- TIMES
ANSWER, AND GO BACK..)

[6]  HANG UP YOUR SECOND LINE

[7]  YOU ARE NOW ON THE LINE!

[8]  LISTEN AND BE Q U I E T ! HE CAN HEAR YOU!

TECHNIQUES I USE TO PREVENT NOISE OR CONFUSION:

IF YOU HAVE CALL FORWARDING, TURN IT ON AND FORWARD CALLS SOMEWHERE BEFORE YOU
START LISTENING. IF A CALL COMES THROUGH ON YOUR CALL WAITING CIRCUIT, THE
PEOPLE TALKING (YOUR BUDDIE AND HIS PAL) WILL NOT HEAR ANYTHING, BUT AFTER YOU
ANSWER CALL WAITING AND COME BACK, THEY WILL HEAR THE OTHER CALL HANG UP (TWO
CLICKS). IF YOU DON'T HAVE CALL FORWARDING, I SUGGEST YOU GET IT IF YOU ARE
GOING TO MAKE A HABIT OF THIS, BECAUSE IT WILL BECOME A MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS.
WHEN YOUR CALL WAITING RINGS, YOU ARE REMOVED FROM THE "LISTENING" CONVERSATION
AND PLACED BACK ON HIS HOLD CIRCUIT. IN ORDER TO GET BACK ON, YOU MUST ANSWER
THE PHONE AND WAIT FOR YOUR PARTY WHEN YOU ANSWER THE PHONE, TELL THE GUY YOU
ARE IN A HURRY AND YOU HAVE TO GO OR YOU'LL CALL HIM BACK LATER OR SOMETHING) TO
HANG UP. WHEN HE OR SHE HANGS UP, YOU WILL BE BACK ON THE CONVERSATION. THEN,
ONE OF YOUR PALS WILL SAY: WHAT WAS THAT? (BECAUSE OF THE CLICKS).. SO, TRY TO
USE CALL FORWARDING IF YOU CAN. REMEMBER: HAVE FUN, AND DON'T ABUSE IT. I AM NOT
SURE ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I JUST DISCOVERED IT. IT IS ILLEGAL (WHAT ISN'T THESE
DAYS) BECAUSE IT IS INVADING PRIVACY". I DON'T KNOW IF THE PHONE COMPANY JUST
DID NOT REALIZE THERE WAS A FLAW IN IT, OR THAT WAS PLANNED FOR LINE TESTING, I
AM NOT SURE. HAVE FUN!
