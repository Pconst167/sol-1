                    ANI-AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION
         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>


    THIS HAS A FEW USES.  FIRST, WERE YOU EVER SOMEWHERE AND THE FONE DIDN'T
HAVE A # PRINTED ON IT?  OR PERHAPS YOU WERE FOOLING AROUND IN SOME CANS
(LARGE BOXES ON FONE POLES THAT CONTAIN TERMINALS FOR LINEMAN USE)
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE LINE # IS.
IN NPA 914, THE ANI IS 990.  IN NPA'S 212 & 516, ANI IS 958.  THIS VARIES FROM
AREA TO AREA.

HERE ARE SOME OTHER ANI'S THAT I HAVE SEEN:

- 830-xxxx (916 AREA CODE)
- 211 (FOR 817 AREA CODE)
- 511 (FOR 716)
- 116 (604)
- 61056, 114 OR 1223 (213-LOS ANGELES)
- 290 OR 200-XXX-XXXX (ILLINOIS BELL)
- 760 (408-SAN JOSE CA)
- 711 (919 AREA CODE)
- 970-XXXX (TEXAS AREAS SERVED BY GTE)
- 997-555-1212 (502 AREA CODE)
- 200-222-2222 (AREA CODES 313, 616, 906, 517)
- 990 (914)
- 958 (NEW YORK CITY)
- 560,THEN HIT 1 TILL THE VOICE APPEARS
- 593-5010 (602 AREA CODE)
- 890-751-5191
- 300-XXX-XXXX
- 202-222-2222
- 1-XXX-1111    (IN SOME 914 AREAS, ESP. UNDER STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING, YOU HAVE
  TO DIAL 1-990-1111)

    TO FIND ANI FOR OTHER AREAS, CHECK 3 DIGITS #'S FIRST, USUALLY IN THE 9XX
SERIES (EXCLUDING 911).  IN AREAS UNDER STEP-BY-STEP TRY 1-9XX-1111.
    ANI MAY ALSO BE IN 99XX.  LAST RESORT, TRY TO GET FRIENDLY WITH YOUR
NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS FOR THE FONE COMPANY.

                                   RING BACK
         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

    RINGBACK, AS ITS NAME IMPLIES, CALLS BACK THE # YOU ARE AT WHEN YOU DIAL
THE RINGBACK #. RINGBACK, IN NPA 914, IS 660. YOU DIAL 660+THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF
THE FONE.  YOU WILL THEN GET A TONE, HANG-UP QUICKLY AND PICK-UP IN ABOUT 2
SECONDS. YOU WILL THEN GET A SECOND TONE, HANG-UP AGAIN AND THE FONE WILL
RING.
    IN NYC, IT IS ALSO 660, BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO PRESS 6 OR 7 BEFORE YOU HANG UP
FOR THE FIRST TIME (IE, AT THE FIRST  TONE).

    OTHER RINGBACK #'S THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE:

26011                - THIS 5 DIGIT FORMAT IS USED PRIMARILY ON STEP-BY-STEP.
THE LAST 2 DIGITS (11) ARE DUMMY DIGITS.

890-897-XXXX         - XXXX ARE THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF THE FONE #.

119911/11911/1199911 - GTE

NNX-9906/9907        - NPA 301, NNX IS THE EXCHANGE


    THE REASON YOU GET THE TONE WHEN YOU PICK-UP AFTER IT RINGS IS BECAUSE IN
SOME AREAS, PEOPLE WERE USING RINGBACK AS AN IN-HOUSE INTERCOM.  THEY WOULD
DIAL RINGBACK, AND WHEN IT STOPPED RINGING, THEY WOULD PICK-UP & TALK WITH THE
PERSON WHO PICKED UP THE OTHER EXTENSION.  BELL DIDN'T LIKE THIS SINCE THERE IS
USUALLY ONLY 1 PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN EACH EXCHANGE THAT DOES THE RINGBACK. WHEN
PEOPLE USED THIS AS AN INTERCOM, LINEMEN & REPAIRMEN COULDN'T GET THROUGH!  IN
SOME AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER STEP-BY-STEP, RINGBACK CAN STILL BE USED AS
AN INTERCOM.  ALSO, UNDER STEP-BY-STEP, THE RINGBACK PROCEDURE IT USUALLY
SIMPLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN ONE AREA YOU WOULD DIAL 26011 AND HANG-UP; IT WOULD
THEN RINGBACK.

                               TOUCH-TONE TEST:
         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

    IN AREAS THAT HAVE A TOUCH-TONE TEST, YOU DIAL THE RINGBACK #.  AT THE
FIRST TONE, YOU TOUCH-TONE DIGITS 1-0.  IF THEY ARE CORRECT IT WILL BEEP
TWICE.
I HAVE ALSO SEEN A TT TEST IN SOME AREAS AT: 890-751-5191
