        This File will Contain basic methods of finding, hacking, and
      using PBX's. I will not assume any liability written in this text
         file, in other words, it is for INFORMATION purposes only.






              Ok, as phreaking continues to become more of a hazard,
          Safer ways of obtaining 'free' calls are highly sought after.
         A While back, a friend of mine gave me a PBX, and it has lasted
          ever since. But the more I used it, the more I wanted others,
           "Just in case" <the other went down>, therefore, I created
           My own method of finding, hacking, and using various other
                       PBX's (Private Branch eXchange)

            A PBX quite simply, is a company owned 'Service' that allows
         Employee's or anyone with the correct code, to call Long Distance
         and speak with others as far away as China. These PBX's generally
         do not contain anything like ANI, or tracing methods, so they are
                 more the likely safer then hacking codes.

            PBX's serve other purposes such as to allow intra-building
         paging and PA system use.  Finding the codes to access the PA
         system can be fun/useful too.  Some owner's pay a flat fee for
         the PBX because of the sheer number of legitimate calls made
         on the services by employees.  This is great for the PBX hacker,
         because this means they are less likely to be caught or have any
         CLID or ANI services on the line.




       The Set-Up - You're gonna need for this -

                (1) Phone Book
                (1) CPU
                (1) Scanner Program (FHacker)
                (1) Hacking Program (Code Thief)
                (1) Telefone - for Information (411)




       The Approach -
                    Larger Companies (such as IBM, NEC, USR) are more
                Then likely the targets which you will want to hit.
                Open your phone book places like 'IBM' and 'NEC' etc,
                until you find a listing of their different services,
                such as Billing Information, Repair, Support, etc.
                Once finding these, list them, and find which Digits
                are occuring the most (like is repair was 777-2345, and
                information was 777-8375). In that example, their PBX
                Would probably be on the '777' Number.

        Scanning -
                    The Next thing you wanna do, is load up your scanner
                and when it asks you for the random `Template' Put something
                to the effect of '777-XXXX'. Start scanning, and keep a record
                of 'Tones' you get (That's right, they don't produce carriers,
                therefore you must MANUALLY listen, and record them). After
                Acquiring a sufficient number of tones, go to you code hacker.

         Hacking -
                    This takes about 10 minutes to perfect. Enter the number
                 in the set-up, when it asks for time between dialing, and
                 inputting the code, experiment with 1, then 2, etc. once you
                 get that right, it'll ask you for the 'code length'. When you
                 get to this part, it is easiest to try 4 first, then 5, etc.
                 Companies will generally only have 6 digit codes on their PBX.
                 After putting in the code, PBX's will usually have a digit to
                 get an outgoing line on. Most use '9', but I'm sure it can
                 differ. After finding which one produces a '2nd tone' that's
                 all you need <bear in mind that when looking for the 2nd tone,
                 you MUST have already hacked out a code in which to call out
                 with>. Next set your hacking time, attempts, etc.


          Using the PBX -
                     This is the most tedious part of using a PBX. You're
                  Going to need a macro, in the macro, put something to
                  the effect of 'ATDT PBXHERE,,,,CODE,9, . After doing
                  this, you can look LEGIT to your parents, by entering
                  the Board numbers as such 1(XXX)XXX-XXXX. No need in
                  having those little +'s, or !'s. Now, you MUST have a
                  telephone hooked up with your Modem. Hit the macro, the
                  modem will dial, and the code will go, etc. While it is
                  doing this, Pick up the phone, when it is done spewing out
                  the last digit (the 9), Hit return (to disconnect it) and
                  immmediately dial your destination. The PBX I use gives you
                  roughly 4 seconds to dial after pressing 9.

                  (Look for a PBX scanner from Chaos Inc in the near future)



             Closing -
                        Enjoy the file, it is easy to understand, easy
                    to do, and was VERY fun to write.
