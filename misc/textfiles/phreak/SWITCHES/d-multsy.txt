This file is of course about DMS 100. Expect full length files about the other
variations of DMS (DMS 200 & 250) coming a later date. Much of the information
in this file was obtained from manuals acquired from Jester Sluggo.  Note: IBN
stands for Integrated Business Network.

DMS-100
-------
The DMS-100/IBN consists of electronic business sets and standard telephones,
data units, and attendant consoles, all located on the customer's premises; and
DMS-100 digital switching, and support hardware/software, located at the
telephone company's premises.  Together they create an integrated business
communications network that provides an unparalleled combination of features
and benefits.

o  DMS-100/IBN integrates voice and data in a total business communications
   system.

o  Effectively serves all sizes of organizations, from small businesses using
   only a few lines, to the most complex network systems with up to 30,000
   lines.

o  The IBN system monitors and controls its own operations automatically;
   diagnoses problems; and in some cases, does its own repairs.

o  Fully modular, to meet present needs, and accommodate new features as they
   are needed.

o  Cost effective: Helps control communications costs through more efficient
   use of facilities; centralization of attendant service where needed; Call
   Dial Rerouting (CDR) to control and restrict long-distance calling; and
   network management.

o  Worry free operation-Northern Telecom's DMS-100 digital switches are backed
   up by highly trained telephone company personal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the other features that DMS 100 has include:

o  Automatic Route Selection - automatically routes long distance calls over
   the most economical route available.

o  Station Message Detail Recording - provides a detailed record of long
   distance charges, including the originating number, time, and duration,
   authorization code, etc.

o  Direct Inward System Access (DISA) - enables company personnel to use
   cost-saving company facilities for long distance calling, even from outside
   the company.
