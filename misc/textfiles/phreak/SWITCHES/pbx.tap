PBX -  Public Branch eXchange

     For all you new phreakers that are vocabularized real well that's the
formal definations......and for those that know what their doing it's
your best phriend.....

     A PBX is no more than a phone line leading into a little box with about
10 lines coming out of it.....Most PBX's are located inside big businesses
such as doctor's office, banks, and other type of important places that
have large masses of people calling in....

     You will realize when you dial a PBX 'cause you will get a ring or a beep
then drop directly into a dial tone....DO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR IT HANGING UP.
Most PBX'S are usually easy to scan for and use....The normal PBX's just
requires a 9 before you can outdial....But then you hit a wierd one that
requires you to enter anywhere from 4-6 code before allowing you access....


     First of all the easiest way to scan for PBX's would be to set up a
scanner that will dial something like this 'atdt yyy-yyyy,,,9,xxx-xxxx' where
'yyy-yyyy' is the number you're scanning and 'xxx-xxxx' is a local nuber
that you ALWAYS recieve a carrier.....this way when you wake up just see
what you connected to and dial and check them out.....there is no other
way of scanning for PBX's unless you just sit there and listen to each number
that you dial out....

     I hope this gives you new phreakers something to do next time you're
wondering where you're going to leech wareZ from.....Ok this covers what
you should need to know about PBX's......HAVE PHUN....
