Call Control Options offer customers a new tool to deal with the hectic
pace of modern life.  Following is a brieg description of the services.

* Call Return: By pressing *69, (1169 on rotary dials), customers can
return the last local incoming call.  This service means fewer mad
dashes from the shower to answer a ringing phone before the caller
hangs up.

* Call Cue: By pressing *66, (1166 on rotary dials), customers can
avoid getting repeated busy signals.  Busy local numbers are redialed
as many times at it takes to get an answer, for as long as 30 minutes.
A special ring is the cue when the line is free.  Call Cue allows
customers to perform other activities while their phone monitors their
line for them.

* Priority Call: By pressing *61, (1161 on rotary dials), customers
can confidently answer--or ignore--their ringing phones.  A special
ring tells them when a call they want is coming through.  (Three local
numbers can be designated as priority.)  Less important calls can wait
for a better time.

* Call Blocker: By pressing *60, (1160 on rotary dials), customers can
avoid inconvenient--and even unwelcome--calls.  As many as three local
numbers can be blocked at any given time (except in Missouri, where
six numbers are blocked).

* Call Trace: By pressing *57, (1157 on rotary dials), customers can
gain a new defense against harassing calls.  That step initiates a trace
of most local calls and customers may request that the calling number,
date and time be given to law enforcement officials for further
investigation.

* Selective Call Forwarding: (Only available in selected Oklahoma
exchanges.)  By pressing *63, (1163 on rotary dials), up to three numbers
can be selected for forwarding to another telephone number.  Only these
calls will get through to the designated number.
