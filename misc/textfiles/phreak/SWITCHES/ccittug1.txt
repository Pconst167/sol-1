    - CCITT: HOW YOU MUST DIAL ? -

---------------------------------------
also, to dial your friend in the USA,
Canada or any other american country
you must type:

      t/a-0-202-456-1414-c

to reach a cool UNIX-SYSTEM or a
friend in Europe, you must type:

    t/b-49-0-511-211-0635-c

If you don't like a busy-signal so
you have to dial for america:

    t/a-2-703-121-c
          \--> this should be the
               area-code, in which
                   you got the
                  busy-signal !

    t/a-2-703-131-c
              /
             /--> this operator is
                  for directory
                  assistance....!

for more 1XX operators look in other
available files for us-dudes.....

important: don't use an operator,
---------- if you don't know how to
           use him !

btw: we found no way to reach the
----> 115xx - operators in the USA!!

If you need directory assistance for
anonther country worldwide, type:

   t/b-43-2-d-c  or  t/b-43-2-e-c

The lines above should give ya the
directory assistance for Austria !
I don't, at the moment, know if you can
do other things with the operators,
but you can change the area code.
(France (33) use a nice music for
the hold position if all lines are
busy!) and you can change the "2"
between "0","1" to "9" sometimes
you get other operators... and
you can always switch between
"d" and "e" (code 11/12) for operators
we're sure, you'll find some really
funny operators, and if you find
something out, leave us a message!

the number for "directory assistance"
are normally the numbers dialed by the
operators (in Germany: 0118 or 00118)

Don't forget you're another operator!
Also, try to be really an operator, or
you'll possibly get trouble....

btw: Please, send the frequencies
---> before or after the number you
---> dialed answer!
---> ----------------------------------
---> also before anything pick-up
---> the phone, or after that thing
---> dropped the phone...
---------------------------------------

    - which coutries can bluebox ? -

---------------------------------------
About the question above, normally all
countries can use the bluebox but some
got a device (against bboxing!) that
mean you can't seize a trunk,or gettin
caught after you seize a trunk with
the correct frequencies...
---------------------------------------

     - How Safe Is Blueboxing ? -

---------------------------------------
This should be the important question.
How safe is blueboxing, really ?!?
Also, in countries with a new
phone-system (with digital dialing!)
like (for example) in the USA & since
a few weeks ago in some citys in
Switzerland (and some other countries)
you're busted, faster than you
can get a orgasm in own-work!
In countries with special devices,
sometimes simple called: filter
(like in spain and great britain!)
you can't use a bluebox, bcoz. your
frequence(s) to seize a trunk, are
simple filtered by the devices...
Normally, you are safe while
blueboxing, if you
use a non-digital phone-system!
For example: In most citys
in United-Germany [West] !  But to be
100% sure, that you don't use digital
lines, simply test everyday before you
use the bluebox!, If you can dial with
"frequence tones", also sometimes
simple called: "touch-tones"
bcoz. If you can dial with it, you
are easy to bust for German-Telecom!
or any other phone-company!
Also, be careful by using the bluebox
or/and cards after you got a digital
line - system...

- Story, how I heard about BlueBoxing -
---------------------------------------
some months ago, a friend from spain
called me in the evening and told me
something about a working bluebox
and he said: I call for free now....
after, I asked this dude,
if he could explain: how does it works?
he told me, "I use a programm on a
Atari-ST (haha) and I enter the number
in a special format and when I complete
the number, I must call a friend or
another number here in Spain, and then
I send some tones (frequencies) !
after that, I can call worldwide for
free...."

This info was given by my friend: Paco
in Spain (thanxx for it!) - I got this
info in the last days of 1990 and
I tried now, something to call here
in Europe for free, bcoz. A few days
after the call from my friend, the
bluebox died in spain, and I lost the
contact, but some days later another
friend, now in Germany told me, that
a friend from him, called any
toll-free number, via satellite and
he can call worldwide for free with
a really good line... Now, I knew
100 % it's possible to call for free
around the globe, simple by using a
few
frequencies and so, I tried to find
out, which frquencies are needed...
I visited some hacker's local in my
city, and ask something about the
phone-systems and I heard something
about trunks, and beep / kerchunks
but I knew nothing about it, only
that it worked years ago in the USA!
But I got no info, that it's
possible to use in Europe too.
I talked also, with a friend of mine
in belgium and he told me something
about the phone-systems (thanxx!)
I heard about CCITT Vx-5, R1-2 etc
so I got more and more info and at
the end of january, 1991! I heard in
the line the first: beep, kerchunk!
some days later, I heard: two
beep/kerchunks, but I got no info on
how to dial after you have seized a
trunk ?
Then, I asked again some friends about
how to dial in the international
(operator) system (?)
A guy in south of Germany! told me
some weeks later something about
dialing with a bluebox...

Today, I wrote allready a bluebox
for different countries on three
computers.... - also, on amiga,
Atari-ST and my best bluebox on
the old commodore 64! - it works 100%!
I must never dial two times the same
number, to reach anybody... - and I
can dial much faster than all the other
blueboxes already published in the
computer-scene!

At the moment I work on a portable
bluebox including some other systems!
And all needed frequencies to use the
bluebox worldwide...
Coming soon.....

      Better Homes and Blue Boxing

               Part I

        Theory of Operation

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has
always been the most noble form of
phreaking. As opposed to such things
as using an MCI code to make a free
fone call, which is merely mindless
pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing is
actual interaction with the Bell
System toll network. It is likewise
advisable to be more cautious when
blue boxing, but the careful phreak
will not be caught, regardless of what
type of switching system he is under.
  In this part, I will explain how and
why blue boxing works, as well as
where. In later parts, I will give
more practical information for blue
boxing and routing information.
  To begin with, blue boxing is simply
communicating with trunks. Trunks must
not be confused with subscriber lines
(or "customer loops") which are
standard telefone lines. Trunks are
those lines that connect central
offices. Now, when trunks are not in
use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state)
they have 2600Hz applied to them. If
they are two-way trunks, there is
2600Hz in both directions. When a
trunk IS in use (busy or "off-hook"
state"), the 2600Hz is removed from
the side that is off-hook. The 2600Hz
is therefore known as a supervisory
signal, because it indicates the
status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or
off-hook (no tone). Note also that
2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency)
signalling and is "in-band." This is
very important. "In-band" means that
is is within the band of frequencies
that may be transmitted over normal
telefone lines. Other SF signals, such
as 3700Hz are used also. However, they
cannot be carried over the telefone
network normally (they are "out-of-
band") and are therefore not able to
be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is.
  Back to trunks. Let's take a
hypothetical phone call. You pick up
your fone and dial 1+806-258-1234
(your good friend in Armarillo,
Texas). For ease, we'll assume that
you are on #5 Crossbar switching and
not in the 806 area. Your central
office (CO) would recognize that
806 is a foreign NPA, so it would
route the call to the toll centre
that serves you. [For the sake of
accuracy here, and for the more
experienced readers, note that the
CO in question is a class 5 with
LAMA that uses out-of-band SF
supervisory signalling]. Depending
on where you are in the country, the
call would leave your toll centre
(on more trunks) to another toll
centre, or office of higher "rank".
Then it would be routed to central
office 806-258 eventually and the
call would be completed. Illustration:

A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----B

A=you  CO1=your central office
TC1=your toll office. 
TC2=toll office in Amarillo.
CO2=806-258 central office. 
B=your friend (806-258-1234)

  In this situation it would be
realistic to say that CO2 uses SF
in-band (2600Hz) signalling, while
all the others use out-of-band
signalling (3700Hz). If you don't
understand this, don't worry too much.
I am pointing this out merely for the
sake of accuracy. The point is that
while you are connected to 806-258-
1234, all those trunks from YOUR
central office (CO1) to the 806-258
central office (CO2) do *NOT* have
2600Hz on them, indicating to the
Bell equipment that a call is in
progress and the trunks are in use.
  Now let's say you're tired of
talking to your friend in Amarillo
(806-258-1234) so you send a 2600Hz
down the line. This tone travels down
the line to your friend's central
office (CO2) where it is detected.
However, that CO thinks that the
2600Hz is originating from Bell
equipment, indicating to it that
you've hung up, and thus the trunks
are once again idle (with 2600Hz
present on them). But actually, you
have not hung up, you have fooled the
equipment at your friend's CO into
thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects
him and resets the equipment to
prepare for the next call. All this
happens very quickly (300-800ms for
step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms
for other equipment).
When you stop sending 2600Hz (after
about a second), the equipment thinks
that another call is coming towards
it (e.g. it thinks the far end has
come "off-hook" since the tone has
stopped. It could be thought of as a
toggle switch: tone --> on hook, no
tone -->off hook. Now that you've
stopped sending 2600Hz, several things
happen:
1) A trunk is seized.

2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end
from the CALLED end indicating that
the CALLED end (trunk) is not ready to
receive digits yet.

3) A register is found and attached
to the CALLED end of the trunk within
about two seconds (max).

4) A start-dial signal is sent to the
CALLING end from the CALLED end
indicating that the CALLED end is
ready to receive digits.

Now, all of this is pretty much
transparent to the blue boxer. All he
really hears when these four things
happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So,
seizure of a trunk would go something
like this:

  1> Send a 2600Hz
  2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
  3> [beep][kerchunk]

  Once this happens, you are connected
to a tandem that is ready to obey your
every command. The next step is to
send signalling information in order
to place your call. For this you must
simulate the signalling used by
operators and automatic toll-dialing
equipment for use on trunks. There
are mainly two systems, DP and MF.
However, DP went out with the dinosaur
, so I'll only discuss MF signalling.
MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the
signalling used by the majority of the
inter- and intra-lata network. It is
also used in international dialing
known as the CCITT no.5 system.
  MF signalling consists of 7 frequen-
cies, beginning with 700Hz and
separated by 200Hz. A different set of
two of the 7 frequencies represent the
digits 0 thru 9, plus an additional 5
special keys. The frequencies and uses
are as follows:

Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l
--------------------------------------
 700+900             1          1
 700+1100            2          2
 900+1100            3          3
 700+1300            4          4
 900+1300            5          5
1100+1300            6          6
 700+1500            7          7
 900+1500            8          8
1100+1500            9          9
1300+1500            0          0

 700+1700           ST3p       Code 11
 900+1700           STp        Code 12
1100+1700           KP         KP1
1300+1700           ST2p       KP2
1500+1700           ST         ST

  The timing of all the MF signals is
a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which
should have a duration of 100ms. There
should also be a 60ms silent period
between digits. This is very flexible,
however, and most Bell equipment will
accept outrageous timings.
  In addition to the standard uses
listed above, MF pulsing also has
expanded usages known as "expanded
inband signalling" that include such
things as coin collect, coin return,
ringback, operator attached, and
operator released. KP2, code 11, and
code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes")
all have special uses which will be
mentioned only briefly here.
  To complete a call using a blue box,
once seizure of a trunk has been
accomplished by sending 2600Hz and
pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one
must first send a KP. This readies the
register for the digits that follow.
For a standard domestic call, the KP
would be followed by either 7 digits
(if the call were in the same NPA as
the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the
call were not in the same NPA as the
seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing a
normal fone call]. Following either
the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is
sent to signify that no more digits
follow. Example of a complete call:

  1> Dial 1-806-258-1234
  2> wait for a call-progress
     indication (such as ring, busy,
     recording, etc.)
  3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
  4> Wait for about 2 seconds while a
     trunk is seized.
  5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST

  The call will then connect if every-
thing was done properly. Note that if
a call to an 806 number were being
placed in the same situation, the area
code would be omitted and only KP+
seven digits+ST would be sent.
  Code 11 and code 12 are used in
international calling to request
certain types of operators. KP2 is
used in international calling to route
a call other than by way of the normal
route, whether for economic or 
equipment reasons.
  STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two
prime, and three prime) are used in
TSPS signalling to indicate calling
type of call (such as coin-direct
dialed).

happen), please let me know and
perhaps a correction will be in order.
Part II will deal mainly with more
advanced principles of blue boxing,
as well as routings and operators.

      Better Homes and Blue Boxing
                Part ii
          Practical Applications
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

(It is assumed that the reader has read
and understood Part i of this series).

  The essential purpose of blue boxing
in the beginning was merely to receive
toll services free of charge. Though
this can still be done, blue boxing has
essentially outlived its usefulness in
this area. Modern day "extenders" and
long distance services provide a safer
and easier way to make free fone calls.
However, you can do things with a blue
box that just can't be done with any-
thing else. For ordinary toll-fraud, a
blue box is impractical for the 
following reasons:

  1. Clumsy equipment required (blue
     box or equivalent)
  2. Most boxed calls must be made
     through an extender. Not for
     safety reasons, but for reasons
     I'll explain later.
  3. Connections are often sacrificed
     because considerable distances
     must be dialed to cross a
     seizable trunk, in addition to
     awkward routing.

  As stated in reason #2, boxed calls
are usually made through an extender.
This is for billing reasons. If you
recall from Part i, 2600Hz is used as a
"supervisory" signal. That is, it
signals the status of a trunk--
"on-hook" or "off-hook." When you
seize a trunk (by briefly sending
2600Hz), your end (the CALLING end)
goes on hook for the duration of the
2600Hz and then goes off-hook once
again when the 2600Hz is terminated.
The CALLED end recognizes that a call
is on the way and attaches a register,
which inerprets the digits which are
to be sent. Now, understand that even
though your end has come off-hook
(no 2600Hz present), the other end is
still on-hook. You may wonder then,
why, if the other end (the CALLED end)
is still on-hook, there is no 2600Hz
coming the other way on the trunk,
when there should be. This is correct.
2600Hz *IS* present on the trunk when
you seize it and afterwards, but you
cannot hear it because of a Band
Elimination Filter (BEF) at your
central office.
  Back to the problem. Remember that
when you seize a trunk, 2600Hz is
indeed coming the other way on the
trunk because the CALLED end is still
on-hook, but you don't actually hear
it because of a filter. However, the
Bell equipment knows it's there (they
can "hear" it). The presence of the
2600Hz is telling the billing equip-
ment that your call has not yet been
completed (i.e., the CALLED end is
still on-hook). When finally you do
connect with your boxed call, the
2600Hz from the called end terminates.
This tells the billing equipment that
someone picked up the fone at the
CALLED end and you should begin to be
billed. So you do start to get billed,
but for the call to the trunk, NOT the
boxed call. Your billing equipment
thinks that you've connected with the
number you used to seize the trunk.

Illustration:

  1. You call 1+806-258-2222
     (directly)
  2. Status of trunks:

<----------------------------------->
(You)                    806-258-2222
No 2600Hz-------> <------------2600Hz

  When you seize a trunk (before the
number you called answers) there is
no affect on your billing equipment.
It simply thinks that you're still
waiting for the call to complete
(the CALLED end is still on-hook; it
is ringing, busy, going to recorder
or intercept operator.
  Now, let's say that you've sezied
a trunk (806-258-2222) and for example,
KP+314+949+1705+ST. The call is routed
from the tandem you seized to:
314-949-1705.

Illustration:

<------------------>O<--------------->
(You)              806         314-949
                 tandem  
No 2600Hz----------> <----------2600Hz

  Note that the entire path towards
the right (the CALLED end) has no
2600Hz present and is therefore "off-
hook." The entire path towards the left
(the CALLING end) does have 2600Hz
present on it, indicating that the
CALLED end has not picked up (or come
"off-hook"). When 314-949-1705 answers,
"answer supervision" is given and the
2600Hz towards the left (the CALLING
end) terminates. This tells your
billing equipment, which thinks that
you're still waiting to be connected
with 806-258-2222, that you've
finally connected. Billing then begins
to 806-258-2222. Not exactly an
auspicious beginning for an aspiring
young phone phreak.
  To avoid this, several actions may
be taken. As previously mentioned,
one may avoid being charged for the
number called to seize a trunk by
using an extender (in which case the
extender will get billed). In some
areas, boxing may be accomplished
using an 800 number, generally in the
format of 800-858-xxxx (many Amarillo
numbers) or 800-NN2-xxxx (special
intra-state class in-WATS numbers).
However, boxing off of 800 numbers is
impossible in many areas. In my area,
Denver, I am served by #1A ESS and it
is impossible for me to box off of
any 800 number.
  Years ago, in the early days of blue
boxing (before my time), phreaks often
used directory assistance to box off
of because they were "free" long
distance calls. However, because of
competetive long distance companies,
directory assistance surcharges are
now $0.50 in many areas. It is
additionally advised that directory
assistance numbers not be used to box
from because of the following:
  Average DA calls last under 2
minutes. When you box a call, chances
are that it will last considerably
longer. Thus, the Bell billing equip-
ment will make a note of calls to
directory assistance that last a long
time. A call to a directory assistant
lasting for 4 hours and 17 minutes
may appear somewhat suspicious.
  Although the date, time, and length
of a DA call do not appear on the bill,
it is recorded on AMA tape and will
trip a trouble report if it were to
last too long. This is how most
phreaks were discovered in the old
days. Also, sometimes too many calls
lasting too long to one 800 number
may raise a few eyebrows at the local
security office.
  Assuming you can complete a blue box
call, the following are listed routings
for various Bell internal operators.
These are in the format of KP+NPA+
special routing+1X1+ST, which I will
explain later. The 1X1 is the actual
operator routing, and NPA and NPA+
special routing are used for out-of-
area code calls and out-of-area code
calls requiring special routing,
respectively.

KP+101+ST ...... toll test board
KP+121+ST ...... inward op
KP+131+ST ...... directory assistance
KP+141+ST ...... was rate & route. Now
          only works in 312, 815, 717,
          and a few others. It has
          been replaced with a univer-
          sal rate & route number,
          800+141+1212.
KP+151+ST ...... overseas completion
          operator (inbound). Works
          only in certain NPAs, such as
          303.
KP+181+ST ...... in some areas, toll
          station for small towns

  Thus, if you seize a trunk in 806 NPA
and wanted an inward (in 806), then you
would dial KP+121+ST. If you wanted a
312 inward and were dialing on an 806
trunk, an area code would be required.
Thus, you would dial KP+312+121+ST.
Finally, some places in the network
require special routing, in addition to
an area code. An example is Franklin
Park, Ill. It requires a special
routing of 032. For this, you would
dial KP+312+032+121+ST for a Franklin
Park inward operator.
  Special routings are in the format
of 0XX. They are used primarily for
load balance, so that traffic flow
may be evenly distributed. About half
of the exchanges in the network
require special routing. Note that
special routings are NEVER EVER EVER
used to dial normal telephone numbers,
only operators.

  Operator functions:

TOLL TEST BOARD- Generally a cordboard
position that assists in trunk testing.
They are not used by operators, only
switchmen.

INWARD- Assists the normal TSPS (0+)
operator in completing calls out of
the TSPS's area. Also, inwards perform
emergency inerrupts when the number to
be interrupted is out of the area code
of the original (TSPS) operator. For
example, a 303 operator has a customer
that needs an emergency interrupt on
215-647-6969. The 303 operator gets
the routing for the inward that covers
215-647, since she cannot do the
interrupt herself. The routing is
found to be only 215+ (no special
routing required). So, the 303 operator
keys KP+215+121+ST. An inward answers
and the 303 says to her, "Inward, this
is Denver. I need an emergency
interrupt on 215-647-6969. My
customer's name is Mark Tabas." The
inward will then do the interrupt (off
the line, of course). If the number to
be interrupted had required special
routing, such as, say, 312-456-1234
(spec routing 032), then the 303
operator would dial KP+312+032+121+ST
for the inward to do that interrupt.

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE- These are the
normal NPA+555+1212 operators that
assist customers with obtaining
telefone directory listings. Not much
toll-fraud potential here, except
maybe $0.50.

RATE AND ROUTE- These operators are
reached by dialing KP+800+141+1212+ST.
They assist normal (TSPS) operators
with rates and routings (thus the
name). The only uses I typically have
for them are the following:

1. Routing information. In the above
example, when the 303 operator needed
to dial an inward that served 215-647,
she needed to know if any special
routing was required and, if so, what
it was. Assuming she would use rate
and route, she would dial them and say
nicely, "Operator's route, please, for
215-647." Rate & route would respond
with "215 plus." This means that the
operator would dial KP+215+121+ST to
reach the inward that serves 215-647.
If there were special routing required,
such as in 312-456, rate & route would
respond with "312 plus 032 plus." In
that case, the operator would dial
KP+312+032+ST for the inward that
serves 312-456.
  It is good practice to ask for
"operator's route" specifically, as
there are also "numbers route" and
"directory routes." If you do not
specifically ask for operator's route,
rate & route will generally assume
that is what you want anyway.
  "Numbers" route refers to overseas
calls. Example, you want to know how to
reach a number in Geneva, Switzerland
(and you already have the number). You
would call routing and say "Numbers
route, please, Geneva, Switzerland."
The operator would respond with:
"Mark 41+22. 011+041+ST (plus) 041+22"
The "Mark 41+22" has to do with
billing, so disregard it. The 011+041
is access to the overseas gateway (to
be discussed in Part iii) and the 041+
22+ is the routing for Geneva from the
overseas sender.
"Directory" routings are for directory
assistance overseas. Example:
you want a DA in Rome, Italy. You would
call rate & route and say, "Directory
routing please, for Rome, Italy." They
would respond with "011+039+ST (plus)
039+1108 STart." As in the previous
example, the 011+039 is access to the
overseas gateway. The 039+1108 is a
directory assistant in Rome.

2. Nameplace information. Rate & Route
will give you the location of an NPA+
exchange. Example: "Nameplace please,
for 215-648." The operator would
respond with "Paoli, Pennsylvania."
This isn't especially useful, since you
can get the same information (legally)
by dialing 0, but using rate & route is
often much faster and it avoids having
to hang up when you are already on a
trunk.

*NOTE on Rate & Route: As a blue boxer,
always ask for "IOTC" routings. (e.g.,
"IOTC operator's route", "IOTC numbers
route", etc.) This tells them that you
want cordboard-type routings, not TSPS,
because a blue boxer is actually just a
cordboard position (that Bell doesn't
know about).

OVERSEAS COMPLETION OPERATOR (inbound)-
These operators (KP+151+ST) assist in
the completion of calls coming in to
the United States from overseas. There
are KP+151+ST operators only in a few
NPAs in the country (namely 303). To
use one, you would seize a trunk and
dial KP+303+151+ST. Then you would
tell the operator, for example, "This
is Bangladesh calling. I need U.S.
number 215-561-0562 please." [in a
broken Indian accent]. She would
connect you, and the bill would be
sent to Bangladesh (where I've been
billing my KP+151+ST calls for two
years).

Other internal Bell Operators.

KP+11501+ST ...... universal operator
KP+11511+ST ...... conference op
KP+11521+ST ...... mobile op
KP+11531+ST ...... marine op
KP+11541+ST ...... long distance
                   terminal
KP+11551+ST ...... time & charges op
KP+11561+ST ...... hotel/motel op
KP+11571+ST ...... overseas (outbound)
                   op

  These 115X1 operators are identical
in routing to the 1X1 operators listed
previously, with one exception. If
special routing is required (0XX),
then the trailing 1 is left off.

Examples:

A 312 universal op ... KP+312+11501+ST
A Franklin Park (312-456) universal
op (special routing 032 required)....
................... KP+312+032+1150+ST
[The trailing 1 of 11501 is left off].

Purposes of 115X1 operators.

UNIVERSAL- Used for collect/callback
calls to coin stations.

CONFERENCE- This is a cordboard
conference operator who will set up a
conference for a customer on a manual
operation basis.

MOBILE- Assists in completion of calls
to mobile (IMTS) type telefones

MARINE- Assists in completion of calls
to ocean going vessels.

LONG DISTANCE TERMINAL- Now obsolete.
Was used for completion of long
distance calls.

TIME & CHARGES- Will give exact costs
of calls. Used to time calls and
inform customer of exactly how much
it cost.

HOTEL/MOTEL- Handles calls to/from
hotels and motels.

OVERSEAS COMPLETION (outbound)- assists
in completion of calls to overseas
points. Only works in some, if any
NPAs, because overseas assistance has
been centraized to IOCC (covered in
Part iii).

  Note that all KP+1X1+ST and
KP+115X1+ST operators automatically
assume that you are a TSPS or cordboard
operator assisting a customer with a
call. DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE
THIS! If you do not know what to do,
don't call these operators! Find out
what to do first.

  This concludes Part iii. There is
one final part in which I will explain
overseas dialing, IOCC (International
Overseas Completion Centre), RQS
(Rate/Quote System), and some basic
scanning.

(It is assumed that the reader has read
and$understood parts i & ii before
proceeding to this part).

  In parts i & ii, I covered basic
theory and domestic singalling and
operators. In this part I will explain
overseas direct boxing, the IOCC, the
RQS, and some basic scanning methods.

Overseas Dipect Boxing.

  Calling outside of the United States
and Canada is accomplished by using an
"overseas gateway." There are 7 over-
seas gateways in the Bell System,
and each one is designated to serve a
certain region of the world. To
initiate an overseas call, one must
first access the gateway that the call
is to be sent on. To do this auto-
matically, decide which country you are
calling and find its country code.
Then, pad it to the left with zeros as
required so it is three digits. [Add
1, 2, or 3 zeros as required].

Examples:

Luxembourg (352) is 352 (stays the
                         same)
Spain (34)   becomes 034 (1 zero added)
U.S.S.R. (7) becomes 007 (2 zeros
                           added)
Next, seize a trunk and dial KP+011+
CC+ST. Note that CC is the three digit
padded country code that you just
determined by the above method. [For
Luxembourg, dial KP+011+352+ST, Spain
KP+011+034+ST, and the U.S.S.R. KP+011+
007+ST]. This is done to route you to
the appropriate overseas gateway that
handles the country you are dialing.
Even though every gateway will allow
you to dial every dialable country, it
is good practice to use the gateway
that is designated for the country you
are calling.
  After dialing KP+011+CC+ST (as CC is
defined above) you should"be connected
to an overseas gateway. It will
acknowledge by sending a wink (which
is audible as a <beep><kerchink> and a
dial tone. Once you receive internat-
ional dial tone, you may route your
call one of two ways: a) as an
operator-originated call, or b) as a
customer-originated call. To go as a
operator-originated call, key KP+
country code (NOT padded with zeros)+
city code+number+ST. You will then be
connected, providing the country you
are calling can receive direct-dialed
calls. The U.S.S.R. is an example of
a country that cannot.

Example of a boxed int'l call:

To make a call to the Pope (Rome,
Italy), first obtain the country code,
which is 39. Pad it with zeros so that
it is 039. Seize a trunk and dial
KP+011+039+ST. Wait for sender dial
tone anf then dial KP+39+6+6982+ST.
39 is the country code, 6 is the city
code, and 6982 is the Pope's number in
Rome. To go as an operator-originated
call, simply place a zero in front of
the country code when dialing on the
gateway. Thus, KP+0+39+6+6982+ST woulf
be dialed at sender dial tone. Routing
your call as operator-originated does
not affect much unless you are dialing
an operator in a foreign country
  To dial an operator in a foreign
country, you must first obtain the
operator routing from rate & route for
that country. Dial rate & route and if
you're trying to get an operator in
Yugoslavia, say nicely, "IOTC
Operator's route, please, for
Yugoslavia." [In larger countries it
may be necessary to specify a city].
Rate & route will respond with,
"38 plus 11229". So, dial your over-
seas gateway, KP+011+038+ST, wait for
sender dial tone, and key KP+0+38+
11029+ST. You should then get an
operator in Yugoslavia. Note that you
must prefix the country code on the
sender with a 0 because presumably
only an operator here can dial an
operator in a foreign country.
  When you dial KP+011+CC+ST for an
overseas gateway, it is translated to
a 3-digit sender code of the format
18X, depending on which sender is
designated to handle the country you
are dialing. The overseas$gateways and
their 3-digit codes are listed below.

  182 ..... White Plains, NY
  183 ..... New York, NY
  184 ..... Pittsburg, PA
  185 ..... Orlando, FL
  186 ..... Oakland, CA
  187 ..... Denver, CO
  188 ..... New York, NY

  Dialing KP+182+ST would get you the
sender in White Plains, and KP+183+ST
would get the sender in NYC, etc., but
the KP+011+CC+ST is highly suggested
(as previously mentioned). To find out
what sender you were routed to after
dialing KP+011+CC+ST, dial (at int'l
dial tone): KP+0020000+ST.
  If you have difficulty in reaching
a sender, call rate and route and ask
for a numbers route for the country
you're dialing. Sometimes, KP+011+
padded country code+ST will not work.
I have found this in many 3-digit
country codes. Lexembourg, country
code 352, for example, should be
KP+011+352+ST theoretically. But it
is not. In this case, dial KP+011+
003+ST for the overseas gateway. If
you have trouble, try dialing KP+00+
first digit of country code+ST, or
call rate The IOCC.

  Sometimes when"you call rate and
route and ask for an "IOTC numbers
route" or "IOTC operators route" for
a foreign country, you will get
something like "160+700" (as in the
case of the Soviet Union). This means
that the country is not dialable
directly and must be handled through
the International Overseas Completion
Centre (IOCC). For an IOCC routing,
pad the country code to the RIGHT with
zeros until it is 3 digits. Then KP+160
is dialed, plus the padded country
code, plus ST.

Examples:

The U.S.S.R. (7) ...... KP+160+700+ST
Japan (81) ............ KP+160+810+ST
Uraguay (598) ......... KP+160+598+ST

  You will then be routed to the IOCC
in Pittsburg, PA, who will ask for
country, city, and number being dialed.
Many times they will ask for a ringback
[thanks to Telenet"Bob] so have a loop
ready. They will then place the call
and call you back (or sometimes put
you through directly). Some calls, such
as to Moscow, take several hours.

The Rate Quote System (RQS).

  The RQS is the operator's rate/quote
system. It is a computer used by TSPS
(0+) operators to get rate and route
information without having to dial the
rate and route operator. In Part ii,
I discussed getting an inward routing
for dialing-assistance and emergency
interrupts from the rate and route
operators (KP+800+141+1212+ST). The
same information is available from
RQS. Say you want the inward routing
for 305-994. You would sieze a trunk
and dial KP+009+ST (to access the RQS).
Sometimes, if you seize a trunk in an
NPA not equipped with RQS, you need to
dial an NPA that is equipped with RQS
first, such as 303. Anyway, after you
dial KP+009+ST or KP+303+009+ST, you
will receive a wink (<beep><kerchink>)
and then RQS dial tone. At RQS dial
tone, for an inward routing for 305-994
you would dial KP+06+305+994+ST. That
is, KP+06+NPA+exchange+ST. RQS will
respond with "305 plus 033 plus". This
means you would dial KP+305+033+121+ST
for an inward that services 305-994.
If no special routing were required,
RQS would have responded with "305
plus" and you would simply dian:
KP+305+121+ST for an inward.
  Another RQS feature is the echo
feature. You can use it to test your
blue box. Dial RQS (KP+009+ST) and
then key KP+07+1234567890+ST. RQS will
respond with voice identification of
the digits it recognized, between the
KP+07 and ST.
  RQS can also be used for rates and
directory routings, but those are
seldom needed, so they have been
omitted here.

Simple Scanning.

  If you're interested in scanning,
try dialing on a trunk, routings in the
format of KP+11XX1+ST. Begin with"11001
and scan to 11991. There are lots of
interesting things to be found there,
as Doctor Who (413 area) can tell you.
Those 11XX1 routings can also be
prefixed with an NPA, so if you want
to scan area code 212, dial KP+212+
11XX1+ST.

  There, now you know as much about
blue boxing as most phreaks. If you
read and understand the material, and
put aside preconceived ideas of what
blue boxing is that you may have
aquired from inexperienced people or
other bulletin boards, you should be
well on you way to an enlightening
career in blue boxing. If you follow
the guidelines in Part i to box, you
should have no problem with the fone
company. Comments made by "phreaks" on
bulletin boards that proclaim "tracing"
of blue boxers are nonsense and should
be ignored (except for a passing
chuckle).

NOTE 1: CCIS and the downfall of blue
         boxing.

CCIS stands for Common Channel Inter-
office Signalling. It is a signalling
method used between electronic
switching systems that eminiates the
use of 2600Hz and 3700Hz"supervisory
signals, and MF pulsing. This is why
many places cannot be boxed off of;
they employ CCIS, or out-of-band
signalling, which will not respond to
any tones that you generate on the
line. Eventually, all existing toll
equipment will be upgraded or replaced
with CCIS or T-carrier. In this case,
we'll all be boxing with microwave
dishes. Until then (about 1995 by
current BOC/AT&T estimates), have fun!

If you have ANY questions about this
text, please feel free to drop me a

welcomed. And if you discover anything
interesting scanning, be sure to let
me know.

    HOW TO 'BLUE BOX' INTO 'RUSSIA'
 
    BY: MARK TABAS

---------------------------------------

HELLO,
  LATELY, I HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED  ABOUT
THE SUBJECT OF BOXING  INTO  THE SOVIET
UNION. WHILE I AM BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT
ON THIS, I HAVE PICKED UP A FEW THINGS.
 
  STANDARD  DIALING   TO  RUSSIA  WOULD
BEGIN SOMETING LIKE THIS:
 
KP+011+007+ST   (FOR INT'L SENDER)
KP+0+95+295+9051+ST   (FOR NUMBER)
 
  IF ALL WENT WELL, YOU WOULD BE ROUTED
INTO  RUSSIA  AS  AN  OPERATOR-ASSISTED
CALL. (BY  THE WAY, THE NUMBER ABOVE IS
THE KREMLIN). HOWEVER, SINCE ALL IS NOT
WELL BETWEEN  US  AND  THE SOVIETS, YOU
WILL  PROBABLY  GET  A  RECORDING. THIS
WILL GO  SOMETHING LIKE, "INTERNATIONAL
DIRECT-DIAL  SERVICE   IS   NO   LONGER
AVAILABLE TO THE  SOVIET  UNION..."  OR
"DUE  TO   CIRCUT   CONGESTION  IN  THE 
COUNTRY YOU DIALED, YOUR  CALL  DID NOT
COMPLETE..."
  THESE RECORDINGS, HOWEVER,  LIE. THEY
ARE MERELY  PLACED THERE  TO DETER  THE
BLUE BOXER.  HE  HEARS  THEM  AND THEN,
BELIEVING THEM, GIVES UP.
  SEE, THE LAST THING THAT AT&T AND THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT  IN GENERAL  NEED  IS A
BUNCH   OF  11-YEAR-OLD   BLUE   BOXERS 
CALLING  RUSSIA  AND  SAYING  SOMETHING 
LIKE: "HA  HA,  YOU  FORNICATING  COMMY 
PINKOS,WE'RE GONNA BOMB THE HELL OUT OF
YOU!"
  SO, THEY MAKE IT *VERY*  DIFFICULT TO
BOX THE  CALL. AS  I SAID  BEFORE,  THE
RECORDINGS  THAT  YOU  GET  ARE  FAKES.
WHEN NORMAL TSPS PLACE A CALL TO RUSSIA
(LEGALLY), THEY  MUST CONTEND WITH  THE
SAME RECORDING,  ONLY INTERNATIONAL HAS
THIS NEAT EQUIPMENT  THAT KEEPS DIALING
THE NUMBER OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL
THE CALL GOES  THROUGH.  THIS  NORMALLY 
TAKES A FEW HOURS. IT  WOULD  TAKE  YOU
A YEAR ON A BLUE BOX. THIS IS WHY  WHEN
YOU ATTEMPT TO  PLACE A  LEGAL  CALL TO
THE U.S.S.R., IOCC (TSPS) WILL TELL YOU
THAT THERE IS A 2-3 HOUR  DELAY.  OFTEN
IT IS MORE THAN  THAT, IF  THEY  HAVE A
LINE OF CALLS.
  TO HAVE IOCC PLACE A CALL,  ONE WOULD
BOX KP+160+700+ST FOR RUSSIA. THIS WILL
GIVE YOU AN IOCC OPERATOR WHO  ASKS FOR
COUNTRY, CITY AND NUMBER, AND A BILLING
NUMBER  (THINKING  THAT  YOU  ARE  TSPS
YOURSELF).  THEN  THEY  WANT A CUSTOMER
RINGBACK NUMBER (LOOP  OR  PAYFONE,  IF
YOU PLAN TO HANG AROUND FOR A FEW HOURS
OR SO).  HOWEVER,  ON  CALLS  TO  OTHER
COUNTRIES,   THEY  WILL   CONNECT   YOU
DIRECTLY AND DO  NOT REQUIRE  RINGBACK.
  IOCC COUNTRY ROUTINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
KP+011+XXX+ST, WHERE XXX IS THE COUNTRY
CODE PADDED TO THE *RIGHT* WITH  ZEROS.
  TO CONTINUE ABOUT IOCC ROUTINGS,  THE
COUNTRY  CODE  IS PADDED  TO THE  RIGHT 
WITH ZEROS.  THUS,  AUSTRALIA  (COUNTRY
CODE OF 61) WOULD  BECOME 610,  AND THE
ROUTING WOULD BE KP+160+610+ST.
  THIS MESSAGE HASN'T  SAID MUCH  SINCE
I HAVEN'T TOLD  HOW TO  BOX A  CALL  TO
RUSSIA, I'VE JUST  TALKED ABOUT ALL THE
PROBLEMS  WITH  CALLING  THERE.  THAT'S
BECAUSE IT  IS  EXTREMELY  DIFFICULT TO
DO. UNLESS YOU  ARE  VERY  PATIENT  AND
FEEL  LIKE TRYING  TO BOX IT ABOUT 5000
TIMES  BEFORE  YOU  FINALLY GET THROUGH 
(IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE BUSY ANYWAY)
THEN YOU  NEED THE  HELP  OF  THE  BELL
SYSTEM   OR   POSSIBLY  SOME  INFERIORS
LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE IRON CURTAIN.
  TO PLACE A CALL TO RUSSIA, OTHER THAN
GOING THROUGH  IOCC, ONE  MIGHT TRY  TO
CONTACT SOME  SORT OF INWARD SOMEWHERE,
LIKE YUOGSLAVIA (KARL MARX'S SUGGESTION
), OR  MAYBE  EAST   GERMANY. TO  BEGIN
WITH, CALL  RATE  &  ROUTE FOR THE IOTC
ROUTING (SAY  YOU ARE ON CORDBOARD) FOR
INWARD IN YUGOSLAVIA.  SHE'LL SAY SOME-
THING  LIKE "038  PLUS  BLAH-BLAH-BLAH"
SO YOU WOULD  BOX  KP+011+038+ST,  WAIT
FOR INT'L TONE, THEN  DIAL KP+0+38+BLAH
BLAH  BLAH+121+ST.  THAT SHOULD GET YOU
INWARD,  YUGOSLAVIA, WHO  SPEAKS LITTLE 
OR NO ENGLISH AND IS AT BEST UNPLEASANT
TO DEAL WITH.
  THAT'S ALL  I  KNOW. IF  YOU  HAVE  A
BETTER WAY (OR ANY WAY AT ALL) TO  CALL
MOTHER RUSSIA, LET ME KNOW.

   The Myth of the 2600Hz Detector
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
    Just about everyone I talk to
these days about ESS seems to be
scared witless about the 2600Hz
detector.  I don't know who thought
this one up, but it simply does not
exist.  So many of you people whine
about this so-called phreak catching
device for no reason.  Someone with
AT&T said they had it to catch phrea-
kers.  This was just to scare the
Blue-Boxers enough to make them quit
boxing free calls.
    I'm not saying ESS is without its
hang-ups, either.  One thing that ESS
can detect readily is the kick-back
that the trunk circuitry sends back
to the ESS machine when your little
2600Hz tone resets the toll trunk.
After an ESS detects a kick-back it
turns an M-F detector on and recordes
any M-F tones X-mitted.
---------------------------------------
   DEFEATING THE KICK-BACK DETECTOR
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
As mentioned in my previous
note, kick-back detection can be a
serious nuisance to anyone interested
in gaining control of a trunk line.
The easiest way to by-pass this
detection circuitry is not really by-
passing it at all, it is just letting
the kick-back get detected on some
other line.
This other line is your local
MCI, SPRINT, or other long distance
carrier (except AT&T).  The only
catch is that the service you use
must not disconnect the line when
you hit the 2600Hz tone.
This is how you do it:  Call
up your local extender, put in the
code, and dial a number in the 601
area code and the 644 exchange.
Lots of other exchanges work across
the country, I'm sure, but this is
the only one that I have found so
far.  Anyway, when it starts ringing,
simply hit 2600Hz and you'll hear the
kick-back, (ka-chirp, or whatever).
Then you are ready to dial whoever
you want (conferences, inward, route
 and rate, overseas, etc.) from the
trunk line in operator tones!
Since blowing 2600Hz doesn't make you
you a phreaker until the toll equip-
ment resets the line, kickback
detection is the method AT&T chooses
(for now).
This information comes as a
result of my experiments & experience
and has been verified by local AT&T
employees I have as acquaintances.
They could only say that this is
true for my area, but were pretty
sure that the same idea is imple-
mented across the country.

=======================================

Now that you know how to access a trunk
line or as operators say a loop, I will
tell you the many things you can do
with it.

Here is a list of AT&T services acces-
sible to you by using a Blue Box.

        A/C+101    Toll Switching
        A/C+121    Inward operator
        A/C+131    Information
        A/C+141    Route & Rate op.
        A/C+11501  Mobile operator
        A/C+11521  Mobile operator



Starting Conferances:
---------------------

This is one the most useful attributes
of blue boxing. Now the confs. are up
24 hours/day and 7 days/week and the
billing lines are being billed. 
Since I beleive the above is true
(about the billing lines being billed)
I would recommend that you never let
your # show up on the conf. if you 
started it, put it on a loop and then
call the loop. ENOUGH BULLSHIT!!!!!
To start the conf. dial one of these
three numbers in M-F while you are on
the trunk.

213+080+XXXX
XXXX=1050,3050
special XXXX=1000,1100,1200,1500,2200,
2500.
     These #s are in L.A. and are the
most watched, I do not advise using 
this NPA.

312+001+1050 or 3050

914+042+1050 or 1100,1200 ect..


***************************************
UPDATE, I BELEIVE ONLY 914 WORKS AT THE
MOMENT
***************************************

Once connected with one of these you
will either hear a re-order, busy, or
cherp. When you hear the cherp enter
the billing line in M-F. I use the
conf. dial- up.
  A billing line example:
       kp312+001+1050st
You will then hear two tutes and a re-
cording asking you for the # of confer-
rees including yourself.  Enter a #
between 20 and 30. If you ever get over
30 people on a conferance all you will
hear is jumbled voices.  After the it
says "Your conferance size is XX" then
hit # sign.  Add Your favorite loop on
and hit 6 to transfer control to it.
After it says control will be transfer-
ed hang up and call the other side of
the loop, hit #sign and follow the in-
structions. A bonus for conf. is to add
an international # dial 1+011+CC+NUMBER
pretty cool ehhh.
A few extra notes.
    Do not add #s that you will want to
    hang up, add these through MCI or
    Sprint. 

    You cannot blow anyone off w/2600hz
    unless they are in an old X-bar or
    older system.

    Many D.A. operators will stay on 
    after you abuse them; you may have
    to start another or at least don't
    say any numbers.

    Never add the tone side of a loop
    onto a conf.

    Never add more than one MCI node on
    your conf.


Route & Rate:
-------------


Note Route & Rate and RQS perform the 
same service.

R&R simply tells you route and
rate info which is very valuble, ex.
such as the inward routing for an ex-
change in an area code.  An inward 
routing will let you call her and she
can do an emergency interupt for you.
She can tell you how to get interna-
tional operators, ect.

Here are the terms you are required to
use:

     International,
        -operator route
           for [country, city].
           *Gives you inward op.
        -directory route
           for [country, city].
           *Gives you Directory Ass.
        -city route
           for [country, city].
           *Gives you country and city
            code.

     Operator route for [A/C]+
        [EXCHANGE]
        *Gives you inward op. route
         ex. [A/C]+ or [A/C]+0XX+
         when she says plus she means
         plus 121.
     Numbers route for [state, city]
        *Gives you A/C.

     Place name [A/C]+[EXCHANGE]
        *Gives you city/state for that
        A/C and exchange.



International calls:
--------------------


To call international over cable simply
access a trunk and dial kp011XXXst
 wait for sender tone, kpXXXCC-NUMBERst

XXX - A 3 digit country code, it may 
not be 3 digits so just put 1 or 2 0's
in front of it.
CC - is the city code

To go by satellite:
     dial kp18Xst    X - numbers 2-8
     wait for sender tone then
     kpXXXCCNUMBERst


---------------------------------------

Fedex will put out a file on RQS soon.

International Operator System or
     "life as a operator"
---------------------------------------

It all began on a beautiful sunday
morning. I just called as usual a few
American boards and downloaded the
"news". A little bored i saws a text
file in a board. Usually i dont care
much about text files but this
one had the title "International
Operator System". It sounded cool so
i decided to downloaded that file.
But the only information i got was that
you can reach opeators with the
"Blue Box". Ok, i thought, whats so
special about it ??
The next day i asked a bit in some
other German boards and got a few more
informations about that. 
"You have to dial a131313c to get a
MCI operator in the states"
Thats how my quest through the american
operators just begann...

Monday afternoon, just after school.
I load my Blue Box PRG called
"Unlimited Access". Just called
Red Sector A West and meet Splicer of
Possessed...
(ok, that were the commercials, smile)

I thought wy not playing a bit with
the operators. I was a bit nervous and
frightened. "What if they get me" ?
No, they wouldnt ! They are to stupid !
Without knowing what i really do a
called a american MCI toll free number,
send the break and called a131313c.
That should give me a operator. I heard
a tone, i waited, and then
"MCI What could i do for you".
I WAS frightened.
I didnt know what to do, so i simply
gave him a number. The number from
"Warez for Mazzes". I wanted to say
"call collect", but before i could do
anything the operator said "Thank you
for using MCI". I couldnt hardly
believe it ! They didnt asked me
for a calling card or something like
that! That was neat !
I heard the carrier.
I sended "atx1d" on my NComm
terminal. But then from my modem
speaker i heard i voice crying
"Operator ! Operator !". I was shocked,
hang up and cut the line! The voice was
calling for me ! I realized it !
They REALLY believed me to be an
operator! The next day. I was calling
the "Skeleton Crue" in the states.
Small chat with the sysop. He said
"ask Billsf for the operator system".
I did. He told me that i can reach
different operators with Blue Box.
I have to dial 131 for directory
assistance and 121 for emergency
interruption. example:


            directory assistance
           /
a 2 201 131 c
  :  :
line area code

Ok, i thought. Just wanted to check it.
Why not trying an emergeny
interuption on the Warez board ?
 I died. Gave the number to the
operator. he asked me from which land
i am calling. I said Spain (Really, i
was calling from Germany). I thought,
i dont want to help you tracing me man!
I heard a the operator hacking his
computer. Then he asked me if I want to
make a point check. Without knowing
what it is I said yes. "Please wait a
moment" I heard in the line. Again
this hacking. I became nervous. Droped
the Phone....


Ok, that should be enough folks !
I have added a txt file of the
operator ya can reach with Blue Box.

Notes:

(1) The Rate Quote System is a voice
response system used by operators
to obtain routing information.
The system, now being phased out, was
used as an alternative to calling the
Rate and Route operator.
Operators would key-in required routing
information and a synthesized
voice would respond. Though the RQS is
still operational, operators
now obtain routing information from
COMPIS (See note 10).

KP+DD+ONPA+NXX+TNPA+NXX+ST to get the
"rate step" for:

   DD = 00 Now
   DD = 01 Day Call     (08:00-17:00)
   DD = 02 Evening Call (17:00-23:00)
   DD = 03 Night Call   (23:00-08:00)

KP+04+?  Something with Mexico,
         unclear.

KP+05+NPA+NXX+ST Gives the routing for
          a BOC inward (See note 9)

KP+06+NPA+NXX+ST gives the routing for
an AT&T inward operator
(See note 9)

KP+07+XXXXXXX+ST  Reads back the
numbers you just typed

KP+08+?  Something with Enterprise and
Zenith numbers, unclear.

KP+09+NPA+NXX+ST Gives you the current
time for the area and exchange
just dialed.

(2) When a code is marked spare, that
means that there is no current
or planned networkwide usage. It still
may be utilized as a
non-standard POTS exchange for WATS
service by local companies.

(3) When a code is marked reserved,
it means that there may be planned
networkwide usage.

(4) This code is used by an AT&T
custom service. It may be thought of
as acting like a special area code and
takes the following dialing
format: KP+XXX+YYY+YYYY+ST where XXX
is the code in question and Y can
be any number 0-9.

(5) All "points not on an NPA" and
"Cable Control" function as pseudo
area codes and are followed by a
telephone number.

(6) Calls to the IOC are dialled
as follows: KP+160+CCC+ST CCC=Country
Code (i.e. 044 or 144 for the UK).

(7) These are special codes used with
Equal Access. They are as
follows:

KP+138+PIC+ST then KP+CC+cc+xxxxx+ST
KP+158+PIC+ST

Where PIC is the primary carrier code,
CC is the country code and cc
is city code. xxxxx is subscriber
number. We are not sure exactly when
and where these are used.

(8) All four and five digit codes are
dialed as follows:
KP+NPA+XXXX+ST or KP+NPA+XXXXX+ST.
Keep in mind that not every code is
in use in every NPA.

(9) The format for an AT&T inward is
usually KP+NPA+121+ST -- In some
small cities there is an extra code
used called a Terminating Toll
Centre (TTC) or sometimes just a
city code. If a TTC is used, the
format is KP+NPA+TTC+121+ST. To get
an inward with most BOCs you dial
KP+NPA+11591+ST but there are some
which use a format of
KP+NPA+TTC+121+ST. To get the inward
routing for a particular
exchange, use the Rate Quote System
(RQS).

(10) The number for Rate and Route
was 800+141+1212 but this was
discontinued sometime last year
(1987) when the TSPS operators got a
computer terminal called COMPIS. In
each there is an inward which acts
like a Rate and Route operator.
In New York it is 716+121.

(11) With the advent of Alliance
Teleconferencing, use of the
conference operator dwindled.
There are currently four operator
handling conferences. They are as
follows: Atlanta 404+11511,
Minneapolis 507+11511, New York
212+11511 and Oakland 415+11511.
800-225-0233 translates to the
conference operator closest to you.

(12) The Marine Operator is used in
calling ships that are close to
the United States. There is an
operator called the "High Seas"
operator who can be reached by dialing
800-SEA-CALL (800-732-2255).
The High Seas operator is a service of
AT&T, while Marisat is an
independent company. A High Seas call
can go to any ocean for $14.98
for the first 3 minutes and $4.98 for
each additional minute. A
Marisat only to three oceans and costs
$10 a minute.

(13) 116X and 116XX are used to verify
an AT&T Calling Card number.
You dial KP+NPA+116XX+ST when you hear
a "bong" you dial the calling
card number. If you use 11611 you enter
the number in Touch Tone and
if you use 11621 you enter the card
number in MF using KP and ST.

(14) These ISC codes are used to
provide alternate routing for
electro-mechanical switches. Some older
electro-mechanical switches,
for example #5 Crossbar (5XB) cannot
outpulse 011+CCC (CCC=Country
Code) for international dialing.
AT&T has set up these special codes
to handle international calls. A 5XB
can dial KP+18X+ST. They would
then receive a wink (short blast of
2600 Hz) and would proceed to dial
the country code and number. If you
want to make an international call
you dial KP+(NPA)+18X+ST where the
NPA is optional. After the wink
dial the country code, city code
and number. The "," after the city
name is the switch number if there
is more then one 4-ESS in that
city.

(15) The 187 code was assigned to
Atlanta until up to the end of
February 1988. AT&T is in the process
in routing the calls to the
Sherman Oaks Office in California.

(16) To make international calls dial
KP+011+CCC+ST where CCC is the
country code; and then dial
KP+CC+XXXXXXX+ST where CC is the city
code and XXXXXXXX is the telephone
number.
