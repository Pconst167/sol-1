    First off, I do hope you're a Plague member, as I don't want this file
distributed to non-members.  Thanks (sorta like the Thanks for not smoking
shit.)  Anyway, a little introduction is in order.  Since I don't like to
do a set up a lot of 'rules' for a group, I won't.  I just want to make this
file something you can read so you can know what you're getting into.

  About Plague
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    Plague (Phreak's League and the Great Underground Empire) concentrates
mainly on learning about the phone system, through legal experimentation
(heh)..  Later, when I myself learn more about hacking, or until I let
someone in that knows a lot about hacking, there is really no hacking
specific sub-branch of the group.  However, I am interested in hacking,
and I'm still learning the skill myself.  Anyway, that's enough.  Plague
was formed a while back, and is still mainly dormant, until something
actually comes up.

    Plague will attempt to write a periodical, similar in content to Phrack,
or etc.  If enough outside submissions are received, then it should get under
way, but until then, any informational submissions should be in text file
format, which can be edited and released with the Plague Elder's approval..

    Enuff about Plague.

    On to the point of this g-phile..

  Rules & Regs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    This section will discuss the rules and regulations of being a Plague
member, node SysOp, or whatever.  Mainly there are no rules, but they are
mainly regulations or whatever you want to call them.

   1) If you are a member, please don't disclose any information if another
      Plague member has asked you not to.

   2) Be cool.

   3) Share your info with other Plague members.

   4) Be an active Plague member.  Strive to learn and share your learnings.

    That's basically all, but use common sense..  Also, a MAJOR rule is you
must call Plague Hq BBS as often as you can.  I'd like to see all the
members call at least once a week to upload your latest g-files, share
your new info, etc..


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  Node SysOp Rules & Regs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    Again, these aren't really rules, but merely regulations that you should
try to follow as much as possible..

   1) Keep the content of your board Phreak/Hack related.

   2) Be (*~VERY~*) restrictive on new user applicants.  Perhaps out of 10
      users who apply, try to turn accept the 1 that is exceptional of the
      10, and delete the others.  This is more of a ~RULE~..

   3) Don't allow a base for Plague members available to the general calling
      public.

   4) Be paranoid.. If a user makes you think the SLIGHTEST that he/she is
      suspicious at ALL, delete him/her.  I don't want any Plague members
      being busted for being lenient on the new user app's..

   5) Keep the messages in your bases intelligent.  Same with files.

   6) Identify ~CLEARLY~ (in large letters, or other) that your BBS is a
      Plague Node.  Also make sure it's clear which Plague node it is.

   7) Be cool, again.  By this I mean, don't develop an ego larger than
      you can support.  I don't want anyone with a big ego in Plague.. I
      loathe that type of person.  If I get any complaints about you,
      you're out.

   8) Tell them they can complain at my BBS if they have any trouble.  I
      want to hear everything that has been screwed or whatever problems..

    That's a little more, but hell those are pretty easy to follow.  If you
can't follow them, you don't belong in Plague.  Go find a /<-rad r0dent BBS
somewhere and form your own group.  This group does not accept anyone under
15, so screw you if you are.

    Also, a global rule... If you know someone who is seriously interested
in learning how to phreak and hack, teach them.  It's a dying art form,
and one that requires ~much~ more expertise than it did a few years ago,
when LOD was formed, and around in there..  Also, if you've learned all
your knowledge from a text file, tell me so I can blacklist you..
Knowledge is learned from practice, experimentation and actually TRYING to
do something.  A text file can only teach you the general idea.  Your
expertise comes from experimentation.

  Text File Policy
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If you think you have enough original knowledge to write a text file,
write it.  It doesn't have to pertain to anything in particular, although
story files, phreak/hack, how-to's, etc. are cool, along with other things.
I have no idea what all I would consider.. just write it up and let me see
it.  And no, a text file written under Plague doesn't have to be written
by a member, so if you know someone that isn't a member but has something
interesting to write about, let me know.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  Phreak/Hack Utilities Policy
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If you are a programmer, and you have something to offer OVER Codethief
or any similar programs, like a ~complete~ All-In-One Scanner (Sprintnet,
Prefix, etc.), then write it up and make sure it looks good.  A standard
will be decided upon soon for all forthcoming programs and utilities.
A completely configurable hacker is also a good concept.  For example,
the ability to only try the accounts and passwords you tell it to, or you
could go ahead and randomly pick accounts and/or passwords.  Limitless
applications are what we're looking for.  Totally Configurable programs,
possibly with AI..  A Hacking program with AI would be interesting,
although only an adept programmer could tackle such a job.  Also, data
encryption would be a handy feature.  For example, all data files could be
encrypted with something the government knows nothing about (not DES), with
a very complex algorithm for encryption.  These are just some ideas off
the top of my head, so I'm sure everyone else has ~many~ more.  All programs
phreak/hack related will be considered.  When more programs are released,
the rest of the details could be worked out then.  Enuff..

  In Closing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    In closing, I'd like to give special thanks to a new friend, Xerxes.
He is helping to run my board right now, due to a little investigation, and
he can take charge if and when it's necessary.  Special fuck-off's go out
to Caramon Majere, who is the stupidest idiot who ever crossed my path.

    Hello's to P/H/A, Syndicate, and whoever else calls my board and helps.
    Greets to Shawn-Da-Lay-Boy Productions and Falstaff (where the hell did
    you go off to??).

    Hint: Something really has to be done to get more good users for my
          board.. It's in the worst location in the US, and that can't be
          helped until later on.  I want everyone who is reading this to
          help... heh.
