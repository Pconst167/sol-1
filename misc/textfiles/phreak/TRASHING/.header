<H1>Phone Phreaking : Dumpster Diving</H1>
<P>
In retrospect, it seems pretty simple: to find out more about the telephone system,
just go through the garbage of a telephone company office, to see what they throw out.
Among the coffee rinds and the stale donuts you'll more than likely find old manuals,
papers, instructions and whatever else they thought was useless but which you considered
gold. These files explain this simple process.
