  The Phone Co.  will go to extreams on occasions.  In fact, unless you really
know what to expect from them, they will suprise the heck out of you with their
"unpublished tarriffs".  Recently, a situation was brought to my attention that
up till then I had been totaly unaware of, least to mention, had any concern
about.	It involved gar- bage!	The phone co.  will go as far as to prosecute
anyone who rumages through their garbage and helps himself to some.

  Of course, they have their reasons for this, and no doubt benefit from such
action.  But, why should they be so picky about garbage?  The answer soon
became clear to me:  those huge metal bins are filled up with more than waste
old food and refuse...	Although it is Pacific Tele.  policy to recycle paper
waste pro ducts, sometimes employees do overlook this sacred operation when sor
ting the garbage.  Thus top-secret confidential Phone Co.  records go to the
garbage bins instead of the paper shredders.  Since it is constantly being
updated with "company memorandums, and supplied with extensive reference
material, the Phone co.  must continualy dispose of the outdated materials.
Some phone companies are supplied each year with the complete "System
Practices" guide.  This publication is an over 40 foot long library of
reference material about everything to do with telephones.  As the new edition
arrives each year, the old version of "System Practices" must also be thrown
out.

  I very quickly figured out where some local phone phreaks were getting their
material.  They crawl into the garbage bins and remove selected items that are
of particular i nterest to them and their fellow phreaks.  One phone phreak in
the Los Angeles area has salvaged the complete 1972 edition of "Bell System
Practices".  It is so large and was out of order (the binders had been removed)
that it took him over a year to sort it out and create enough shelving for it
in his garage.

  Much of this "Top Secret" information is so secret that most phone companies
have no idea what is in their files.  They have their hands full simply
replacing everything each time a change in wording requires a new revision.  It
seems they waste more paper than they can read!

  It took quite a while for Hollywood Cal traffic manager to figure out how all
of the local phone phreaks constantly discovered the switchroom test numbers.

  Whenever someone wanted to use the testboard, they found the local phone
phreaks on the lines talking to all points all over the world.	It got to the
point where the local garbage buffs knew more about the office operations than
the employees themselves.  One phreak went so far as to call in and tell a
switchman what his next daily assignment would be.  This, however, proved to be
too much.  The switchman traced the call and one phone phreak was denied the
tool of his trade.

  In another rather humorous incident, a fellow phreak was rumaging through the
trash bin when he heard someone approaching.  He pressed up against the side of
the bin and silently waited for the goodies to come.  You can imagine his
surprise when the garbage from the lunchroom landed on his head.  Most people
find evenings best for checking out their local telco trash piles.  The only
thing necessary is a flashlight and, in the case mentioned above, possibly a
rain coat.  A word of warning though, before you rush out and dive into the
trash heap.  It is probably illegal, but no matter where you live, you
certainly won't get the local policeman to hold your flashlight for you.
