Due to my own impatience waiting for other H/P magazines to be released I 
decided to release this file in solo form.  I am going to call it BUTLER#1
because there will be updates and additions to follow.


The Computer Underground consists of mainly two forms of media, printed
and electronic, both will be discussed in this file.  I use the word underground
because the contents of this file are not the types of titles you would run 
across at your local bookstore or newsstand.  The kind of information that
makes up underground publications is mainly technical in nature, but, 
definitley not limited to that.  One can also find tidbits about off-the-wall
polical views, drugs, weapons, and other topics that are not normally in 
the mainstream of our society.  


The Computer Underground...

Com-put-er Un-der-ground   \kem-`pyÅt-er\  \`en-der-`graÅnd\ (1970's)

  A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind aliases, to promote the free
  exchange of information regarding anything and everything including but
  not limited to: Computers, Telephones, Radios, Chemicals, and ideas.


The CU is made up of men and women all over the globe and of all ages.  Most
of those involved in the CU consider it a hobby, but, there are those that 
are involved strictly for illegal purposes, i.e. Selling Pirated Software.  I,
like most people involved enjoy the information that can be obtained through
all of the different avenues in the CU, i.e. Bulletin Boards, Underground 
Periodicals, Network Digests, and General Discussions between members.

The most common way members communicate is through Bulletin Boards.  If you are
reading this you know what a BBS is because this will not be released in 
printed form.  There are thousands of BBSes around the world run by people for
many reasons including: legitmate businesses, Software Technical Support, Hobby
related, Pirated Software, Message Centers, etc...Some of the more common ones
are RIPCO, Face-2-Face, Exec-PC, The Well, etc...

Currently there are many regular electronic magazines that are being published
and there have been many that have discontinued for one reason or another.  
Some current ones include: PHRACK, NIA, PHANTASY, CUD, etc...Some discontinued
ones include: PIRATE, PHUN, NARC, etc... 

There is a current debate about wether or not an electronic media has the same 
constitutional rights as the printed one.  That is for our congressmen to 
decide, but, you could voice your opinion.  I personally can't see the differ-
-ence.  Now, don't get me wrong I do not support the publishing of Long-
distance codes or anything of that nature, but, I do support the exchange of
other information, i.e. how to unprotect a game, how to make a smoke bomb, etc...

There are also "Underground Publications" like TAP, 2600, Cybertech, etc.  
These magazines are published in hard copy and deal with every considerable 
topic regarding the CU.  Most of these magazines publish completely legal 
information that is obtained from public sources and is available to anyone
and everyone.

I doubt that any of the following sources of information would mind if you use
an alias to order any of their material, so I would reccommend that you do
just in case!  You might even want to get yourself a private mail box for all
of this "underground" information.  I would also advise you to use a money
order when purchasing anything also.  They usually cost an extra 50 cents at the
post office.  And don't worry about using money orders with these people because
I have personally made purchases from many of them without trouble.

The following information is provided to enable you to become more familiar
with the CU and unusual information in general.  Have fun and try not to
get yourself in trouble.

Now for the meat of this Article!!!!

Welcome to the Privacy Catalog, Over 300 publications explore every aspect of
privacy in ways that are not only unique, but also provocative.  Some books may

many different views of the same subject.  We endeavor to offer views that will
prove both helpful and thoughtful in the many areas where privacy may be a 
concern.

to know that their catalogs cost anything.
