   An effective modem weapon, especially on crossbar phone systems.  (Will 
 still operate on ESS but you will kill phone service to your prefix for a 
 few hours, and everyone talking will be cut off on your prefix and the one
 you called).
 
 What is this device?
 -------------------
   It's a Tesla Coil!  Concentrated static electricity.  The Tesla coil when
 properly used will generate litrally thousands of volts at very low 
 amperage.  (Just the right current to bake silicon chip cookies!)
 
 Construction:
 ------------
 1.  Disconnect all phones from your line.  Disconnect answering devices and
     any data-transmission devices.
 
 2.  Run a preliminary test on the coil and disconnect nearby grounded
     objects.  (Lamps, stereos, TV's, etc...)
 
 3.  Connect one phone that you see fit to subject.  (It usually does not 
     destroy phones, but I have seen them melt off walls.)
     
 4.  Connect iron or steel balls to the green and red wires of your
     connected phone (these are the line wires that go into the wall.)  It 
     and 12 terminals of your phone.
     
 5.  Put on a pair of thick rubber gloves (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!)
 
 6.  Charge coil to at least 10,000 volts.  An ideal setting is around 18 to
     19 thousand, but 10 will jump Ma-Bells line surge protectors.
     
 7.  Hold metal balls in your left hand.  (Make sure they don't touch each
     other) When the coil is fully charged, clip the steel ball connected to
     the red wire to the base of the Tesla coil and hold the other metal
     ball as far away from the coil as you can.
     
 8.  Dial the offending modems number.
 
 9.  When connected, move the metal object connected to the green wire
     within 2 feet of the coils top.  (Note: Don't be afraid of the little
     bolts of electricity shooting from the top of the coil...)
     
 10. Within 3 seconds a huge bolt of lightning will shoot forth at the phone 
     from the hand you are holding the balls in.  (Hold on tight cause it'll
     feel like loads of ants!) You will immediatly hear many strange 
     occilations to the carrier on the phone.  The last noise you will hear 
     from the phone is a pop!  (That is the last cry of agony as it shuts
     down.)
     
 Crossbar just disconnects.
