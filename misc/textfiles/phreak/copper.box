Disclaimer (I know...):
  This file is for informational purposes only.  No use of this technique
is recommended for one of many reasons: 1) It makes other Phreaks & hacks
very upset, 2) It makes the Telco VERY upset, and you could be put away for
a LONG time if you dont know what youre doing.  Telco employees could learn
something from the Copper Box. Well, anyway, off we go....

Purpose:
  This box can destroy a phone company, no matter how big.  You could bring
AT&T down to their knees!  Only to be used by the most irate of Phracks,
it is intended for informational purposes only.

History:
  This is really not a Box, but if you consider a Cheese Box a Box, then it
is.  It was first concieved back in 1986 when a Phriend and I came up with
the idea while using a Copper-coloured fone, hence, a Copper Box.

Instructions:
  You must obtain [1] extender, or phone company port, like an MCI or SPRINT
access number.  [2] A hell of a lot of nerve, and vendetta towards the phone
company (phriend gets busted, rates increase, etc.) [3] a computer & modem
capable of autodialing [tone.]

  Dial the number of the L/D service, then enter the code.  Dial the number of
the service again, through the outdial number you are still on, enter code,
then dial again and again.  You should hear, after a while (it will take a
long time for BIG companies) a slight high-pitched, unstable tone, that grows
louder and louder w/every dial.  Once it gets so loud that it refuses to let
in any more sounds, you have just completed the first cycle of the Copper Box.
  Leave line off-hook for about 10 minutes or until the tone seems to calm
down, or stop completely.  Then, dial again and repeat over and over again
until when you dial a last time, it [the port] doesnt answer.  You have just
killed a telephone company, extender, etc.

Theory of Operation:
  What happens is that when the tone begins to rise, it is a result of cross-
talk feedback.  The more you dial,  the more it grows.  In systems like these,
the small, sensitive equipment such as amplifiers, etc. begin to burn out as
a result of the feedback, damaging the equipment, and possibly starting a fire
at the location of the equipment.
