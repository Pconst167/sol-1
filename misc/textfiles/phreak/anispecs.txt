         1.0  INTRODUCTION
 
         This document addresses the technical requirements for PBX/ACD
         vendors who wish to interface with MCI switches to receive ANI.
         Delivery of this ANI between the MCI terminating switch and the
         Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) will be inband, and will be
         supported on dedicated/hard-wired terminations only.
 
         2.0  OVERVIEW
 
         Automatic Number Identification (ANI) relates to the identification
         of the telephone number of the calling party at the premise of the
         called party.  This document specifies the technical requirements
         necessary for the interface between the MCI terminating switch and
         the CPE.
 
         Initially, MCI will deliver real time ANI for 800 and 900 service
         calls to the CPE of the called party over dedicated trunks.  The
         terminating switch will outpulse this ANI to the CPE using a
         single-stage signaling sequence.  See Section 4.0 for details.
 
         It should also be noted that:
 
         (1)  If a call originates in a foreign country, no ANI or
         originating country code will be delivered to the PBX/ACD.
 
         (2)  If a 800/900 call overflows to an LEC network for call
         completion, no ANI will be delivered to the terminating LEC and
         PBX/ACD.
 
         (3)  If the MCI switch does not receive the full 10-digit ANI from
         the LEC, i.e. if the call originates from a non-conforming end
         office, then the Originating NPA + 555 - 5555  will be outpulsed to
         the CPE.
 
         If a specific customer subscribes for the real time ANI feature,
         ANI will be delivered to the actual termination of that call.  In
         order to receive the ANI, customers need to ensure that all
         possible dedicated trunks and terminating PBX/ACDs, as specified in
         the routing control, are equipped with ANI receiving and processing
         capabilities.
 
         2.1  ANI Applications
 
         Some of the current and potential applications are:
 
         (1)  Telemarketing:  This generic term includes locating dealer,
         customer service and order taking.
 
         (2)  Financial services:  This is a particularly large application
         including customer service, automated balance/credit inquiry,
         financial information retrieval and funds transfer.
 
         (3)  Home Shopping:  ANI could be used as an identifier to recover
         the called party profile and appropriately route the call.  Payment
         records could be checked.
 
         However, a few important limitations must be noted at this point.
 
         (1)  As pointed out earlier, ANI cannot be delivered for calls
         originating from non-conforming end offices.
 
         (2)  A customer could originate a call from a telephone with a
         number different from that customer's home or office telephone
         number.  Hence no check of the customer's record can be performed
         in this case.

         4.0  SIGNALING SEQUENCE
 
         This section describes the signaling sequence for the interface
         between the terminating MCI switch and the CPE.  Real time ANI will
         be delivered to the 800/900 Service customer during the call setup
         process.
 
 
         4.1  ANI Delivery Using MF Signaling
 
         If the MCI switch determines that ANI is to be delivered for a
         particular call, the switch will perform single-stage signaling as
         specified below.  Refer to Fig. 4-1 on page 4-2.
 
         A.   The MCI terminating switch will seize a trunk to the CPE.
 
         B.   The CPE shall respond to the trunk seizure with a wink start
              signal when ready to receive pulsing.
 
         C.   On receipt of the wink start signal from the CPE, the MCI
              switch will outpulse the 10 digit ANI (KP + 10D ANI + ST).
 
         D.   If ANI is not received, the switch will outpulse
              KP + NPA + 555 - 5555 + ST.
 
         E.   When the telephone/terminal answers, an answer off hook signal
              shall be sent from the CPE to the MCI terminating switch.
 
         F.   The MCI switch will cut through the voice path when it
              receives an answer off hook from the CPE.
 
         G.   If the CPE transmits an on-hook towards MCI for at least 350
              ms, the call will be disconnected.  Similarly, the MCI switch
              may disconnect the call by transmitting an on-hook for at
              least 350 ms.
 
         *Note: If the MCI switch does not receive the ANI digits from the
                LEC, the switch will outpulse KP + Originating NPA + 555 -
                5555 + ST to the CPE using MF Signaling.

                           ANI DELIVERY USING MF SIGNALING
 
 
         4.2  ANI Delivery Using DTMF Signaling
 
         If the MCI switch determines that ANI is to be delivered for a
         particular call, the switch will perform single-stage signaling as
         specified below.  Refer to Fig. 4-2 on page 4-X.
 
         A.   The MCI terminating switch will seize a trunk to the CPE.
 
         B.   The CPE shall respond to the trunk seizure with a wink start
              signal when ready to receive pulsing.
 
         C.   On receipt of the wink start signal from the CPE, the MCI
              switch will outpulse the 10 digit ANI.
 
         D.   If ANI is not received, the switch will outpulse NPA + 555 -
              5555.
 
         E.   When the telephone/terminal answers, an answer off hook signal
              shall be sent from the CPE to the MCI terminating switch.
 
         F.   The MCI switch will cut through the voice path when it
              receives an answer off hook from the CPE.
 
         G.   If the CPE transmits an on-hook towards MCI for at least 350
              ms, the call shall be disconnected.  Similarly, the MCI switch
              may disconnect the call by transmitting an on-hook for at
              least 350 ms.
 
         *Note: If the MCI switch does not receive the ANI digits from the
                LEC, the switch will outpulse the Originating NPA + 555 -
                5555 to the CPE using DTMF Signaling.

                          ANI DELIVERY USING DTMF SIGNALING
 
         5.0  TIMING, TOLERANCES AND RESTRICTIONS
 
         This sections describes the timing, tolerances and restrictions
         that are applicable to the MCI switch/CPE interface.
 
 
         5.1  Hook Flash
 
         Hook flashes shall not be passed to the MCI switch.  All hook flash
         timing shall be handled internally by the CPE.
 
 
         5.2  Hits
 
         A short change in the received supervisory state is called a hit.
         All hits shall be ignored.  A hit may be on hook or off hook and is
         dependant on conditions as specified below:
 
         A.   The CPE shall interpret an off hook of less than 150 ms as a
              hit and not a seizure signal.
 
         B.   The MCI switch will interpret an off hook of less than 70 ms
              as a hit and not a wink start signal.
 
         C.   An on hook duration of less than 200 ms shall be interpreted
              as a hit.
 
 
         5.3  Wink Start Operation
 
         The off hook wink (wink start) shall be sent as soon as the CPE
         detects a seizure signal.  The CPE shall return the wink start
         signal within 3.5 seconds of the trunk seizure.  However, it shall
         not be provided earlier than 100 ms after receiving the seizure
         signal.  The off-hook period shall be a minimum of 140 ms and
         maximum of 290 ms.  The MCI switch will interpret an off hook
         signal in the range of 100 ms to 350 ms as a wink signal.  If the
         MCI switch receives an off hook signal lasting over 350 ms on a two
         way trunk, a glare condition will be interpreted.  Glare resolution
         is discussed in Section 5.6.
 
 
         5.3.1  Wink Start Guard
 
         The CPE must be prepared to receive Multi Frequency (MF) or Dual
         Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) digits 35 ms after the end of the wink-
         start signal.  The MCI switch will wait for 50 ms after the end of
         the wink-start signal before initiating the MF or DTMF pulsing.
         Characteristics of these signals are defined in Section 5.7.
 
 
         5.4  Answer
 
         The CPE shall provide a steady off-hook state indicating called
         party answer.
 
 
         5.5  Incomplete Calls
 
         If a time out occurs while waiting for a response from the CPE, the
         MCI switch shall treat the call as follows.  If the CPE responds to
         seizure on a trunk with an off-hook longer than 350 ms instead of a
         wink-start signal, a false answer condition is indicated.  The MCI
         switch shall try to set up another call using a different circuit
         within the same trunk group.  If an idle circuit is not available,
         the switch will try to set up the call on a different trunk group,
         failing which all other routes shall be tried.  If all of the above
         fail, the MCI switch shall disconnect the call and return a reorder
         towards the calling party.
 
 
         5.6  Glare Resolution
 
         Glare is a condition resulting from seizure attempts for the same
         two way access line at about the same time by both the MCI switch
         and the CPE.  If the returned off hook lasts longer than 350 ms
         instead of a wink start signal, a glare condition will be
         interpreted.
 
         The MCI switch will always be the controlling end when a glare is
         detected.  The CPE shall maintain the outgoing off hook state while
         preparing for reception of address signals from the MCI switch.
         When ready to receive digits, the outgoing off hook signal shall be
         changed to on hook.  The outgoing call initiated by the CPE shall
         be re-tried on another trunk.
 
 
         5.7  Register Signaling
 
         The MCI switch supports the following two types of address
         signalling to deliver ANI.
 
         A.   Multi Frequency (MF); and
         B.   Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF).
 
         5.7.1  MF Characteristics
 
         One of the two types of address signaling that the MCI switch will
         support is the Multi Frequency (MF) type.  Conformity with the
         criteria indicated in this subsection will ensure compatibility of
         the signals between the MCI switch and the CPE.
 
         The MF pulsing system consists of transmitting and receiving
         various combinations of two, and only two, out of five frequencies
         in the voice band.  Each combination of two frequencies represents
         a pulse and each pulse represents a digit.  This system provides
         sufficient unique combinations to encode 10 digits.  A sixth
         frequency is provided for additional control signals.  Table 5-1
         identifies the signaling codes.

         5.7.2  DTMF Characteristics
 
         The second type of address signaling that the MCI switch will
         support is the Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) type.  Conformity
         with the criteria indicated in this subsection will ensure
         compatibility of the signals between the MCI switch and the CPE.
 
         The DTMF provides for 16 unique signals.  Each signal is composed
         of two voice band frequencies, one from each of two mutually
         exclusive frequency groups consisting of four frequencies each.
         Table 5-2 identifies the signaling codes.

         The audible call progress tones provided by MCI will have the
         following characteristics:
 
         A.  Busy Tone:           480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 60 IPM
                                  at a level of -24 dBmO per frequency.
 
         B.  Reorder Tone (Fast Busy): 480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 120
                                  IPM at a level of -24 dBmO per frequency.
 
         C.  Ringback Tone:       440 Hz plus 480 Hz (two seconds on, four

         5.9  Disconnect
 
         To disconnect a call the MCI switch will transmit an on hook
         towards the CPE for at least 350 ms.  Conversely, the CPE may
         disconnect a call by transmitting an on hook towards the switch for
         at least 350 ms.
