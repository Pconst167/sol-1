INTRODUCTION:
------------
THIS PHILE WILL DEAL WITH ACCESSING, UNDERSTANDING AND USING THE
ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING SYSTEMS.... IT HAS MANY SECTIONS AND FOR BEST
USE SHOULD BE PRINTED OUT...ENJOY...

ALLIANCE:
--------
ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING IS AN INDEPENDANT COMPANY WHICH ALLOWS THE
GMNERAL PUBLIC TO ACCESS AND USE IT'S CONFERENCING EQUIPMENT.  MANY
RUMORS  HAVE BEEN FLOATING AROUND THAT ALLIANCE IS A SUBSIDARY OF AT&T.
WELL, THEY ARE WRONG.  AS STATED ABOVE, ALLIANCE IS AN ENTIRELY
INDEPENDANT COMPANY.  THEY USE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW USERS TO
TALK TO MANY PEOPLE AT ONCE.

THE NUMBER:
--- ------
ALLIANCE IS IN THE 700 EXCHANGE, THUS IT IS NOT LOCALIZED, WELL, NOT IN
A WAY.  ALLIANCE IS ONLY IN CERTAIN STATES, AND ONLY RESIDENTS OF THESE
CERTAIN STATES CAN ACCESS BY DIALING DIRECT.  THIS, HOWEVER, WILL BE
DISCUSSED IN A LATER CHAPTER.  THE NUMBERS FOR ALLIANCE ARE AS FOLLOWS:

        0-700-456-1000 (CHICAGO)
                 -1001 (LOS ANGELES)
                 -1002 (CHICAGO)
                 -1003 (HOUSTON+
                 -2000 (?)
                 -2001 (?)
                 -2002 (?)
                 -2003 (?)
                 -3000 (?)
                 -3001 (?)
                 -3002 (?)
                 -3003 (?)

THE LOCATIONS OF THE FIRST 4 NUMBERS ARE KNOWN AND I HAVE STATED THEM.
HOWEVER, THE NUMBERS IN THE 200X AND 300X ARE NOT DEFINATELY KNOWN.
RUMOR HAS IT THAT THE PATTERN REPEATS ITSELF FUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN
PROVEN.

DIALING:
-------
AS STATED BEFORE, ALLIANCE IS ONLY IN CERTAIN STATED AND ONLY THESE
STATES CAN ACCESS THEM VIA DIALING DIRECT.  HOWEVER, DIALING DIRECT
CAUSES YOUR RESIDENCE TO BE CHARGED FOR THE CONFERENCE AND CONFERENCE
BILLS ARE NOT LOW!!! THEREFORE, MANY WAYS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED TO START
A CONFERENCE WITHOUT HAVING IT BILLED TO ONES HOUSE.  THEY ARE AS
FOLLOWS:

     1) DIALING THROUGH A PBX
     2) INCORPORATING A BLUE BOX
     3) BILLING TO A LOOP
     4) BILLING TO A FORWARDED CALL

I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE BUT THESE ARE THE FOUR I WILL DEAL WITH.

DIALING THROUGH A PBX:
------- ------- - ---

     PROBABLY THE EASIEST METHOD OF CREATING A FREE CONFERENCE IS
     THROUGH A PBX.  SIMPLY CALL ONE IN A STATE THAT HAS ALLIANCE, INPUT
     THE PBX'S CODE, DIAL 9 FOR AN OUTSIDE LINE AND THEN DIAL ALLIANCE.

     AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD FE:

PBX: 800-241-4911

WHEN IT ANSWERS IT WILL GIVE YOU A TONE.  AT THIS TONE INPUT YOUR CODE.

CODE: 1234

AFTER THIS YOU WILL RECEIVE ANOTHER TONE, NOW DIAL 9 FOR AN OUTSIDE
LINE.  YOU WILL NOW HEAR A DIAL TONE.  SIMPLY DIAL ALLIANCE FROM THIS
POINT AND THE CONFERENCE WILL BE BILLED TO THE PBX.

USING A BLUE BOX:
----- - ---- ---

     ANOTHER RATHER SIMPLE WAY OF STARTING A CONFERENCE IS WITH A BLUE
     BOX.  THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE IS HOW TO FOX A CONFERENCE:

DIAL A NUMBER TO BOX OFF OF.  IN THIS EXAMPLE WE WILL USM 609-609-6099

WHEN THE PARTY ANSWERS HIT 2600HZ.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE FONE COMPANY'S
EQUIPMENT TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE HUNG UP.  YOU WILL HEAR A
<BEEP><KERCHUNK> YOU HAVM NOW 'SEIZED' A TRUNK.  AFTER THIS, SWITCH TO
MULTI-FREQUENCY AND DIAL:

KP-0-700-456-X00XZSt

KP=KP TONE ON BLUE BOX
X=VARIABLE BETWEEN 1 AND 3
ST=ST TONE ON BLUE BOX

THE EQUIPMENT NW THINKS THAT THE OPERAP<R HAS DIALED ALLIANCE FROM HER
SWITCHBOARD AND THE CONFERENCE SHALL BE BILLED THERE.  SINCE BLUE BOXING
IS SUCH A LAVGE TOPIC, THIS IS AS FAR AS I WILL GO INTO IT'S USES.

BILLING TO A LOOP:
------- -- - ----

     A THIRD METHOD OF RECEIVING A FREE CONFERENCE IS BY BILLING IT TO A
LOOP.  A LOOP IS 2 NUMBERS THAT WHEN TWO PEOPLE CALL, THEY CAN TALK TO
EACH OTHER.  YOU'RE SAYING WOOP-TEE-DO RIGHT? WRONG! LOOPS CAN BE <VERY>
USEFULL TO PHREAKS.  FIRST, DIAL ALLIANCE DIRECT.  AFTER GOING THROUGH
THE BEGINNING PROCEDURE, WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS TUTORIAL,
DIAL 0 AND WAIT FOR AN ALLIANCE OPERATOR.  WHEN SHE ANSWERS TELL HER YOU
WOULD LIKE TO BILL THE CONFERENCE TO SUCH AND SUCH A NUMBER. (A LOOP
WHERE YOU R PHRIEND IS ON THE OTHER SIDE) SHE WILL THEN CALL THAT NUMBER
TO RECEIVE VOICE VERIFICATION.  OFCOURSE YOUR PHRIEND WILL BE WAITING
AND WILL ACCEPT THE CHARGES.  THUS, THE CONFERENCE IS BILLED TO THE
LOOP.

BILLING TO CALL FORWARDING:
------- -- ---- ----------

     WHEN YOU DIAL A NUMBER THAT IS CALL FORWARDED, IT IS FIRST ANSWERED
BY THE ORIGINAL LOCATION, THEN FORWARDED.  THE ORIGINAL LOCATION WILL
HANG UP IF 2600HZ IS RECEIVED FROM ONLY ONE END OF THE LINE.  THEREFORE,
IF YOU WERE TO WAIT AFTER THE FORWARDED RESIDENCE ANSWERED, YOU WOULD
RECEIVE THE ORIGINAL LOCAT ION'S DIAL TONE.

EXAMPLE: DIAL 800-325-4067.  THE ORIGINAL RESIDENCE WOULD ANSWER, THEN
FORWARD THE CALL, A SECOND TYPE OF RINGING WOULD BE HEARD.  WHEN THIS
SECOND RESIDENCE ANSWERS SIMPLY WAIT UNTIL THEY HANG UP.  AFTER ABOUT
TWENTY SECONDS YOU WILL THEN RECEIVE THE ORIGINAL RESIDENCE'S DIAL TONE
SINCE IT HEARD 2600HZ FROM ONE END OF THE LINE.  SIMPLY DIAL ALLIANCE
FROM THIS POINT AND THE CONFERENCE WILL BE BILLED TO THE ORIGINAL
RESIDENCE.

     THESE ARE THE FOUR MAIN WAYS TO RECEIVE A FREE CONFERENCE.  I AM
SURE MANY MORE EXIST, BUT THESE FOUR ARE QUITE HANDY THEMSELVES.

LOGON PROCEDURE:
----- ---------
ONCE ALLIANCE ANSWERS YOU WILL HEAR A TWO-TONE COMBINATION.  THIS IS
THEIR WAY OF SAYING 'HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU WANT ON THE CONFERENCE
DUDE?' SIMPLY TYPE IN A 2-DIGIT COMBINATION, DEPENDING ON WHAT BRIDGE OF
ALLIANCE YOU ARE ON, BETWEEN 10 AND 59.  AFTER THIS EITHER HIT '*' TO
CANCEL THE CONFERENCE SIZE AND INOUT ANOTHER OR HIT '#' TO CONTINUE.

YOU ARE NOW IN ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING AND ARE ONLY SECONDS AWAY FROM
HAVING YOUR OWN ROARING CONFERENCE GOING STRONG!!!

DIALING IN CONFEREES:
------- -- ---------
TO DIAL YOUR FIRST CONF
EREE, DIAL 1+NPA+PRE+SUFF AND AWAIT HIS/HER ANSWER.

NPA=AREA CODE
PRE=PREFIX
SUFF=SUFFIX

     IF THE NUMBER IS BUSY, OR IF NO ONE ANSWERS SIMPLY HIT '*' AND YOUR
CALL WILL BE ABORTED.  BUT, IF THEY DO ANSWER, HIT THE '#' KEY.  THIS
WILL ADD THEM TO THE CONFERENCE. NOW COMMENCE DIALING OTHER CONFEREES.

JOINING YOUR CONFERENCE:
------- ---- ----------
TO JOIN YOUR CONFERENCE FROM CONTROL MODE SIMPLY HIT THE '#' KEY.
WITHIN A SECOND OR TWO YOU WILL BE CHATTING WITH ALL YOUR BUDDIES.  TO
GO BACK INTO CONTROL MODE, SIMPLY HIT THE '#' KEY AGAIN.

TRANSFERRING CONTROL:
------------ -------
TO TRANSFER CONTROL TO AN OTHER CONFEREE, GO INTO CONTROL MODE, IT THE #
6+1+NPA+PRE+SUFF OF THE CONFEREE YOU WISH TO GIVE CONTROL TO. IF AFTER,
YOU WISH TO ABORT THIS TRANSFER HIT THE '*' KEY.

<NOTE>:TRANSFER OF CONTROL IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE.  WHEN YOU RECEIVE A
MESSAGE STATING THIS, YOU SIMPLY CANNOT TRANSFER CONTROL.

MUTED CONFERENCES:
----- -----------
TO REQUEST A MUTED CONFERENCE SIMPLY HIT THE 9 KEY.  I AM NOT EXACTLY
SURE WHAT A MUTED CONFERENCE IS BUT IT IS PROBABLY A WAY TO KEEP
UNWANTED EAVESDROPPERS FROM LISTENING IN.

DIALING ALLIANCE OPERATORS:
------- -------- ---------
SIMPLY DIAL 0 AS YOU WOULD FROM ANY FONE AND WAIT FOR THE OPERATOR TO
ANSWER.

ENDING YOUR CONFERENCE:
------ ---- ---------
TO END YOUR CONFERENCE ALL TOGETHER, THAT IS KICK EVERYONE INCLUDING
YOURSELF OFF, GO INTO CONTROL MODE AND HIT '*'...AFTER A FEW SECONDS
SIMPLY HANG UP.  YOUR CONFERENCE IS OVER.

ARE ALLIANCE OPERATORS DANGEROUS?
--- -------- --------- ---------
NO.  NOT IN THE LEAST.  THE WORST THEY CAN DO TO YOU WHILE YOU ARE
HAVING A CONFERENCE IS DROP ALL CONFEREES INCLUDING YOURSELF.  THIS IS
IN NO WAY HARMFUL, JUST A LITTLE AGGRAVATING.

ALLIANCE AND TRACING:
-------- --- -------
ALLIANCE CAN TRACE, AS ALL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES CAN.  BUT THIS
HAS TO ALL BE PRE-MEDITATED AND AT&T HAS TO BE CALLED AND IT'S REALLY A
LARGE HASTLE, THEREFORE, IT IS ALMOST NEVER DONE.  ALLIANCE SIMPLY DOES
NOT WANT IT KNOWN THAT TEENAGERS ARE PHUCKING THEM OVER.  THE ONLY SORT
OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT ALLIANCE HAS ON-LINE IS A SIMPLE PEN REGISTER.  THIS
LITTLE DEVICE SIMPLY RECORDS ALL THE NUMBERS OF THE CONFEREES DIALED.
NO BIG DEAL.  ALL ALLIANCE CAN DO IS CALL UP THAT PERSONS NUMBER,
THREATEN AND Q UESTION.  HOWEVER, LEGALLY, THEY CAN DO NOTHING BECAUSE
ALL YOU DID WAS ANSWER YOUR FONE.


<NOTE>:ALMOST ALL INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOLD TO THE PERSON IN COMMAND BY
ALLIANCE RECORDINGS.  A LOT OF THIS TUTORIAL IS JUST A LISTING OF THOSE
COMMANDS PLUS INFORMATION GATHERED BY EITHER MYSELF OR THE PHELLOW
PHREAKS OF THE WORLD!!!
