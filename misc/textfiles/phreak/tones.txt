        Touch tone fones:

        As most of you know a touch tone fone produces a sound
        when a key is pressed. What some people don't know, however,
        is that this tone is actually 2 sounds. This system is
        referred to as DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency). Here is a
        list of both tones' frequencies :
        KEY     FREQ. #1     FREQ. #2
        ---     --------     --------
        1         697          1209
        2         697          1336
        3         697          1477

        4         770          1209
        5         770          1336
        6         770          1477

        7         852          1209
        8         852          1336
        9         852          1477

        *         941          1209
        0         941          1336
        #         941          1477

        These freq. are measured in Hertz.

        Red Boxes:

        Here are some money frequencies to use with the red box.
        Although 1 piece of real $ is needs to be sent first the
        red box duplicates the rest. ms=millisecond 1700hz & 2200hz mixed together

        nickel-66ms on (1 beep)
        dime-66ms on, 66ms off, 66ms on (2 beeps)
        quarter-33ms on, 33ms off (repeat 5 times)

        Silver Boxes:

        Sliver boxes change the 3,6,9,# keys on a touch tone
        fone to A,B,C,D  As with a regular key these use DTMF.
        KEY     FREQ. #1     FREQ. #2
        ---     --------     --------
        A         697          1633
        B         770          1633
        C         852          1633
        D         941          1633

        These freq. are in Hertz.

        Green Boxes:

        A disadvantage of these is that they must be used by the called party.
        The freq. here should be used only after a signal is sent to alert
        the MF detectors at the CO. This is done by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or
        a single 2600 Hz (90 ms) tone followed by 60ms of silence and then
        the tone you want for at least 900ms. Here are the freq. in Hertz :

        Coin Collect     700 + 1100
        Coin Return     1100 + 1700
        Ringback         700 + 1700


        That concludes this little journey into the world of
        fone phreaking...hope this helped someone out there.
