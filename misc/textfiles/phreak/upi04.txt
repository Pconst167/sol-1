          Teen Hacker Taps Into Network Send Teachers `Rude' Messages
                               By Caroline Byrne
                                 TORONTO STAR

        A teenage hacker infiltrated a computer network at least 20 times in
the past two months with obscene messages to teachers across the United States
and Canada, the Peel Board of Education says.
        "The kid broke into this around Dec. 15 and what he was doing, which
less than amusing, was ... sending out really rude messages," board chairman
Carolyn Parrish said yesterday.
        The main computer for international network, called CHIMO, is at the
board's Mississauga office.
        "It was a little embarrassing.  Obvisously we had to shut it down for a
while," she said.
        About 900 teachers from Vancouver to Newfoundland and south to Texas
were using the computer network when messages started appearing.
        Using his home computer, the youth discovered the passwords of several
teachers and left "alarming" notes in their electronic mailboxes.  Peel police
Sergeant John rennie said yesterday.
        Police would not say how they caught the suspect because that would
be submitted in court as evidence.
        A 17 year old Morningstar Secondary School in Mississauga has been
charged with 10 counts of unlawful use of a computer.  He cannot be named under
the Young Offenders Act.
