_0.1_Introduction_

        Most of america has a police scanner to keep track of Big Brother.
But when they give out those police codes such as 10-40 you never know what
exactly is happening. So now for your enjoyment and personal security S.O.B.
presents.. The Police Radio Codes.

_0.2_S.O.B._

        S.O.B. or Servants of Babuska is a small local group that has been
together for about 2 years. We are pleased to bring you the knowledge we have
and maybe get on the good side of some SysOps out there.
