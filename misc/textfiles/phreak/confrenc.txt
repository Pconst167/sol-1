
OK, HERE'S A LITTLE TRICK TO LET YOU CALL A FUE PHRIENDS ONE NIGHT AND HAVE A
LITTLE TRADE OF SOME SORT!!!

FIRST, YOU CALL YOUR LOCAL "0" OPERATOR (VIA EXTENDER OR FORTRESS BUT NEVER
FROM YOUR HOUSE SINCE THEY AUTOMATICALLY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE CALLING FROM).

SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF, "YES, OPERATOR, TSPS MAINTENANCE CALLING. I
AM HAVING SOME PROBLEMS ON MY END. CAN YOU PLEASE KEYPULSE FORWARD TO
TO 121, START, POSITION RELEASE."

WHAT THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF DOING IS CONNECTING YOU TO AN INWARD OPERATOR
WHO WILL CONNECT YOU TO ANY NUMBER IN HER AREA CODE ONLY. IF YOU WANT TO
GET CONNECTED TO THE 213 CONFERENCE, YOU HAVE TO CALL A 213 INWARD--SO SAY
"KEYPULSE FORWARD TO 213-121..." FIRST. THEN SAY TO THE INWARD, "YES PLEASE
CONNECT ME TO 080-1050." OF COURSE USING THE 213 CONFERENCE SYSTEM IS VERY
STUPID!

IF THE TSPS OPERATOR GIVES YOU PROBLEMS, SOUND INDIGNANT AND IMMEDIATELY ASK
TO SPEAK TO HER GROUP CHIEF. IF SHE PUTS YOU THROUGH, HANG-UP SINCE THE G.C.
KNOWS ABOUT SUCH THINGS. IF YOU GET A REGULAR SUPERVISOR AT HER INSISTANCE
ASK THE SUPERVISOR THE SAME LINE, AND YOU'LL PROBABLY GET THROUGH.
IN SOME AREAS WHERE THIS METHOD IS ABUSED BY CERTAIN PEOPLE, THE OPERATOR
WILL BE TOLD TO SAY, "I'M CURRENTLY UNAWARE OF ANY TSPS TESTING TAKING
PLACE, I'LL CONNECT YOU TO MY SUPERVISOR."

FINNALY, REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH OPERATORS...BE ESPECIALLY
CAREFUL. IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY BECAME SUSPICIOUS IN
PUTTING THROUGH THE CALL (ESPECIALLY WITH A SUPERVISOR), HANG-UP!!! IF THEY
DON'T PRESS POSITION RELEASE, THEY CAN LISTEN TO YOUR LITTLE HIGHLY ILLEGAL
CONVO! AND GET AN ANI (AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION) ON EVERYONE IN THE
CONFERENCE!!! BUT LIFE IS FULL OF DANGERS ISN'T IT. TAKE A CHANCE! IT IS
WORTH IT! SOMETIMES.
