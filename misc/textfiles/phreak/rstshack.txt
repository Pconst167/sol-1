                           ------- -- ---- ------
                           ======================

 So, you've decided that you'd like to try to down an RSTS system?
 Well, here's a beginner's guide:

The RSTS system has two parts, the Privileged accounts and the User accounts.
The Privileged accounts start with a 1 (In the format [1,1], [1,10], etc.
To show the Privileged accounts we'll just use the wildcard [1, *].)

The privileged accounts are what every RSTS user would love to have, because
if you have a privileged account you have COMPLETE control of the whole
system.  How can I get a [1,*] account?  you may ask.... Well, it takes A LOT
of hard work.  Guessing is the general rule.  For instance, when you first
log in there will be a # sign:

# (You type a [1,*] account, like 1,2) It will then say Password:
(You then type anything up to 6 letters/numbers - Upper Case only)
ABCDEF - If it says ?Invalid Password, try again' then you've not done
it YET...Keep trying.

Ok, we'll assume you've succeeded.  You are now in the privileged account of
an RSTS system.  The first thing you should do is kick everyone else off the
system (Well, maybe just the other Privileged users).  You do this with the
Utility Program.

PUT KILL (here you type the Job # of the user you'd like to get out of
your way).  If the system won't let you, you'll have to look for the
UTILTY program.  Search for it by typing DIR [1,*]UTILTY.*  Now, you've
found it and kicked off all the important people (If you want, you can
leave the other people on, but it's important to remove all other [1,*]
users, even the Detached ones).  To find out who's who on the system type
SYS/P-(That will print out all the privileged users).  Or type SYS to see
Everyone.  Next on your agenda is to get all the passwords (Of course).  Do
this by running $MONEY (If it isn't there, search for it with DIR[1,*]MONEY.*
and run it using the account where you found it instead of the $) There will
be a few questions, like Reset? and Disk? Here's the Important answers.
Disk? SY (You want the system password) Reset? No (You want to leave
everything as it is) Passwords? YES (You want the passwords Printed) There
are others, but they aren't important, just hit a C/R.  There is ONE more,
it will say something like Output status to? KB: (This is important, you
want to see it, not send it elsewhere).  Ok, now you've got all the passwords
in your hands.  Your next step is to make sure the next time you come you
can get in again.  This is the hard part.  First, in order to make sure that
no one will disturb you, you use the UTILTY program to make it so no one
can login.  Type UT SET NO LOGINS (also you can type UT HELP if you need
help on the program).  Next you have to Change the LOGIN program.  I'm sorry,
but this part is fuzzy - Personally, I've never gotten this far.
Theoretically here's what you do: Find out where the program is, type:

DIR [1,*]LOGIN.*  If there is LOGIN.BAS anyplace, get into that account
(Using your password list, and typing HELLO and the account you'd like to
enter).  On the DIR of the program there is a date (Like 01-Jan-80).  To
make it look good you type UT DATE (and the date of
the program). Next, you make it easy for yourself to access the program.
You type PIP (And the account and name of the program you are changing)
<60>=(again the name of the program).  Now what you do is OLD the program.
Type OLD (Name of the program) Now that is all theoretical.  If anyone runs
into problems, tell me about it and I'll see if I can either figure it out
or get someone else to.

Next thing you want to do is LIST the program and find out where the input
of the Account # is.  To get this far you have to know a lot about
programming and what to look for...

Here is generally the idea, an idea is all it is, because I have not been
able to field test it yet: Add a conditional so that if you type in a code
word and an account # it will respond with the password.

This will take a while to look for, and a few minutes to change, but you
can do it, you've got that RSTS system in your back pocket.

Let's say you've (Somehow) been able to change the program.  The next thing
you want to do is replace it, so put it back where you got it (SAVE
Prog-name), an$ then put it back to the Prot Level (The # in the <## #>
signs) by typing PIP (Prog name)<232>=Progname (Note, in all of this, don't
use the ()'s - they are just used by me to show you what goes where).

Now you've gotten this far, what do you do?  I say, experiment!  Look at all
the programs - since you have Privileged status you can analyze every
program.  Look around for the LOG program, and find out what you can do to
that.

The last thing to do before you leave is to set the date back to what it was
using the UTILTY program again UT DATE (and the current date).
