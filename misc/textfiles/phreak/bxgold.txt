
GOLD BOX PLANS: COURTESY OF SIR WILLIAM

HOW TO BUILD IT
_______________


YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING:

TWO 10K OHM AND THREE 1.4K OHM RESISTORES, TWO 2N3904 TRANSISTORS, TWO
PHOTOCELLS, TWO RED LED'S (THE MORE LIGHT PRODUCED THE BETTER), A BOX THAT
WILL NOT LET LIGHT IN, AND RED AND GREEN WIRE.

LIGHT FROM THE #1 LED MUST SHING DIRECTLY ON THE PHOTOCELL #1. THE GOLD
BOX I MAID NEEDED THE TOP OF THE LED'S TO TOUCH THE PHOTOCELL FOR IT TO
WORK. THE SAME APPLIES TO THE #2 PHOTOCELL AND LED.

      1.4K

THE 1.4K RESISTOR IS VERIABLE AND IF THE SECCOND PART OF THE GOLD BOX IS
SKIPPED IT WILL STILL WORK BUT WHEN SOMEONE PICKS THE PHONE UP THEY WILL
HEAR A FAINT DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT REPORT IT TO THE
GESTOPO ER...(AT&T).  1.4K WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH LITTLE RISK OF
A GESTOPO AGENT AT YOUR DOOR.


NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT IT TAKE TWO GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENTH STRIP
THE ENDS, TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONNECT THEM TO GREENND PLACE A
PEICE OF TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 WRITING ON IT. CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH
RED1 ONLY US E RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH RED2 AND GREEN2 BUT CHANGE TO LINE #2.


HOW TO INSTALL
______________

YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINES THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL ONE
OF THE PHONES LINES LINE #1. CUT THE PHONE LINES AND TAKE THE OUTER COATING
OFF IT. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES. CUT THE YELLOW AND BLACK WIRES OFF AND
STRIP THE RED AND GREEN WIRES FOR BOTH LINES.

LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PEICES TAKE THE GREEN WIRE OF ONE END AND CONNECT
IT TO THE ONE OF THE GREEN WIRES ON THE GOLD BOX. TAKE THE OTHER HALF OF
LINE # 1 AND HOOK THE FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE GREEN WIRE ON THE PHONE LINE.
REPEAT THE PROCESS WITH RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RIGHT DOWN THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PLACE YOU
HOOKED IT UP AT AND GO HOME AND CALL IT. YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE!!! IF
NOT LEAVE ME A MESSAGE ON THE MODEM MADNESS BBS xxx-xxx-xxxx OR TRY
CHANGING THE EMITTER WITH COLLECTOR. OH, AND HOOKING IT UP TO A PAYPHONE
IS A FEDERAL OFFENCE AND IT IS ILLEAGAL TO PUT ON ANY PHONE.  I RECOMMEND
YOU SEE YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING SAID IN THIS
ARTICLE. (HAHAHAHA!!!!!!)
