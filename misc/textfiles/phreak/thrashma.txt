|   This file will explain a few dif- |
| ferent ways to get past Ma Bell's   |
| operators, and other flaws...       |
|*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*|
| THRASH #1:                          |
|   Go to a payfone and raise as much |
| hell as you can conjure...Call the  |
| operator and say you paid a quarter |
| and called a number, but heard a    |
| bunch of clicks, and weren't con-   |
| nected, but instead recieved a dial |
| tone...Say that you didn't recieve  |
| either the call, or the quarter...  |
| Act like you're pissed off, and in  |
| a hurry...Say you haven't got any   |
| more money, and it's mandatory that |
| your call gets through...If they    |
| ask if the other party will accept  |
| a collect call, say no because they |
| don't know you, but the call still  |
| must get through...Bitch about the  |
| hassle you're having to go through  |
| to get a God damn call through...   |
| The operator will then do either of |
| the following things...She will ask |
| you where you are trying to call,   |
| or if she's a real bitch will put   |
| you through to a refund operator... |
| The coin refund operator can't for- |
| ward a call, all she can do is give |
| you a check for your quarter in the |
| mail...The fone company sends SLOW  |
| mail, but if you want to wait, take |
| the quarter too...If you don't want |
| to be bullshitted around by some    |
| brainless refund operator, say you  |
| need a call now, and tell her to    |
| connect you with the operator who   |
| can make a call for you (TSPS)...   |
| Now, it's up to you to feed the     |
| same shit to her, say that you've   |
| already been sent to the refund op- |
| erator 2 times, and it's wasted 10  |
| minutes of valuable time...One out  |
| of about every 2-3 will fall for    |
| this shit...Good luck...            |
|*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*|
| THRASH #2:                          |
|   You're bored and pissed off, you  |
| want to call up a cool rag board    |
| and bitch someone out, but ALL the  |
| boards are busy...You know some     |
| blood-sucking-parasite who uses an  |
| Atari and his real name is on the   |
| board, sucking every message on it  |
| dry...Here's a 50 -- 50 chance to   |
| cut the asshole off, and put your-  |
| self on...Use an emergency inter-   |
| rupt on the line, it won't cost     |
| anything, since the operator will   |
| report back to you, "I'm sorry,     |
| there seems to be trouble on the    |
| line, I'll have to report it."...   |
| You now hang-up, and call the board |
| hoping the asshole wasn't in trans- |
| fer mode (it doesn't work in trans- |
| fer mode)...                        |
|*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*|
| THRASH #3:                          |
|   You're bored again, and want to   |
| trip out on some operators...Call   |
| your long distance operator and say |
| you want to get the over-seas DAO   |
| for (somewhere you make up) lets    |
| say West Germany...She will ask for |
| the persons name, use something     |
| reasonable like "Heinz Kreitz"...   |
| She sometimes asks for a city there |
| too, so know that...Finally, you    |
| will be connected with some nazi-   |
| sounding dude, your operator will   |
| look like a bigger dumb-shit than   |
| she really is by giving the other   |
| operator false info...Well, not the |
| greatest, but what the hell...      |
|*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*|
| THRASH #4:                          |
|   Go to a payfone, a fone center    |
| store, or a large department store  |
| (one where no clerks are around     |
| listening to you)...Bitch out the   |
| operator for anything...Good topics |
| for me have been all the different  |
| LDC's, the break-up between fone    |
| companies, fone bills, shitty ser-  |
| vice, shitty lines, etc...Ask who   |
| you're talking to "just in case you |
| need to call back"...Argue with her |
| aiming to get the bitch to say the  |
| wrong thing to you (like "you're an |
| asshole!"...If so, try to bribe her |
| for something (like calls)...Say    |
| you want to talk to her supervisor, |
| threatening to take her job away,   |
| she just might give in...I've been  |
| working for this goal in the past,  |
| but unfortunately have been unsuc-  |
| cessful...If you are, let me know   |
| by calling Rock 'N' Roll Hell, or   |
| any other board listed above...     |
