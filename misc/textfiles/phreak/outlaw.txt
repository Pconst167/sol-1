FOREWORD:

     This is the first file I've written under the xORGanization
     and under the handle Yardley Flouride.  Maybe you've read
     some of my files under the name Dial Tone with Black September
     and cDc communications.  From now own I will write under
     the new handle and for xORG and cDc.  The xORG is the newest
     hack/fraud/thieve group around and most of my fraud ideas
     will be directed to that group.  My more fun files (i.e.
     "Fun With Traffic Lights") will be with cDc.  Just to clear
     that up.

     this file is part 1 of 2.  part 1 is the basic breaking into
     cars or being devious to gain access to the car.  part 2 will
     be the hot wiring of a car if you're in it already.  i know
     there's already been files like that but this will go beyond
     the others.  i don't feel like typing all that right now though.

                       No transportation!

I know, I know.  Looking for a great time and what?  No wheels!  
I hate when that happens.  Well, if you've read the file on casing
by Elijah Bonecrusher and L.E. Pirate you're one step ahead.  With 
the art of casing comes the art of getting the rest of the car.  
Ok, you need a car to get you to where you have to go and for no 
other reasons.


7-11's are convenient for more than slurpees you know!
I was hanging out in front of 7-11 and it smacked me right in the 
face how many people leave their car on when running into 7-11.  
In a half hour I counted over 7 cars that people left unattended 
to run in.  In this one incident, myself and Elijah were out front 
of one and this dude went in and left his piece of shit Duster 
waiting for us to take.  Just hide around the sides of the stores 
and get the ones near the sides of the building.  Elijah during the 
summer at the shore got a government vehicle.  Pretty cool, eh?

Don't dress like a god damn thief.  Most fake "anarchist"
faggot asswipe computer nerds would wear all black and a ski mask.  
No no no. Dress like a prep or some way you never dress.  Beat up 
someone for their rags and wear them.  And act like you're having 
fun hanging out at 7-11, drink a slurpee or something.  Don't just 
sit there sticking your head around the corner of the building going, 
"how's that car!?", "let's get the porsche!", etc.  Of course when 
all the people went into the store and left their cars on it was in 
the winter, it was cold as balls out.  Who knows, if you find a good 
car take it to some remote spot and dump it.  Rip everything out of 
it and take anything that looks over $5.  This is all I have to say 
for "Stealing Cars Part I".  Support the scene.  Amen.

Introduction
============

You ever wonder where that unemployed guy down the street got
enough cash to start a 1200 baud board with 60 megs?  Well, the
answer, most likely, is Credit Fraud.

Credit fraud involves getting a credit card number (a CC #), and
then ordering things by phone.  All you need is the card number
and the experation date.  And a few other nasties...

Well, forget this basic stuff!  Let's get into the good parts....

Getting Your Card
===================

Always been meticulous about your appearence?  Don't like to be
dirty?  Then the primary method of getting credit cards is not
going to appeal to you.

When a customer buys something at a store or restaurant (with a
credit card, of course), several carbons are made.  The store
puts these into their files, and throws them away a week or so
later.

What's that?  You say, "Why don't I go to the trash, and get
these carbons?", do you? Well, you're correct; this is exactly
what you do.  Here are some tips:

1) Go on the First of the month.  (In a lot of stores, this is
   the 'clear the files day'.

2) Go to the mall.  That way, if one trash can is empty, you
   have a hundred or so more.

3) Stay away from food stores.  Sticking you're hand into last
   week's fried chicken is a price too high for a lousy credit
   card.

4) For convienence, look for florists, video stores and the like.
   Video stores especially, since >every< transaction they make
   involves a credit card.

Ok, that is just one of the ways which you can get you're card
here are the other primary methods:

CBI/TRW
=======

CBI and TRW are Credit services which have Credit Cards,
Addresses, names, and driver's licenses for most of the
population of the United States.  You can also use this system to
find out the credit card mend calling through a PBX, then XXXXX (insert you're
favorite phone service here).

Leeching
========

You could also get them off the credit fraud board on you're
local elite BBS.  Not a good idea, since most cards up there have
about 1,000 dollars worth of porno tapes on them.

Better yet, you can ask a friend.  This will probaly work, but
sometimes people give a card that they have used, or used but
messed up with.  Oh, the death of friendship!

Ok, you've got your card?  Good.

Ordering
========

You've got to order your merchandise.  To do this, call the
orderline for the company, and talk to these people.  If you're
known as "The Human Carrier" by you're friends, or modems connect
when you say "Hello", then forget it.  These days they are
getting mighty suspicous.

They will ask you what card you want to use.  Master Cards have a
5 as the first digit of the first cluster, Visas have a 4.

If ice--very
softly.  Just say, "I'm sorry...  I have this awful sore
throat..."

The first rule is be polite.  Don't sound nervous.  If the lady
asks you for the driver's license, and you don't have it, make
one up, then before you hang up, say "I'm sorry, I'm going to
have to cancel this order...my husband told me that he had
already gotten the XXXXX (the item you were trying to order)"
Try to order from a pay phone, and when they ask for a phone
number, give them the pay phone's number.  Or scan for a number
that will ring, and ring...  A board that is down is a good bet.

Now, you may ask, what address do I give the salesman?

The Address
===========

The pick up is one of the most crucial part of the entire part.
Here is what I think the ultimate address should be:

1) Abandoned.

2) Isolated (No little old ladies calling the police or spraying
   you with hoses).

3) About a mile or so away from your house.

Number one could also have a friend of yours who will sign for
the package, then when the feds come deny it ever arrived.  This
is unlikely.

Number two is obvious.  I have been yelled at by numerous old
people, and people that don't speak English.  Not fun.

The mile away from you're house is obvious.  Don't want people
that know you to be witnesses.

Also, you can order to an occupied house.  Send them a note by
mail, telling them about a "computer glitch that sent some of
our mechandise to you're address, and we will send a sales
representative (or his son) to come pick it up."  Spice this up,
by apologizing for any hassles, and giving a fake name for the
"sales represenative".  Then, when you go, just give them a
little note authorizing you to be there with an impressive
signature.

When you pick up the package, be calm.  Talk to the people no
longer than necessary, but don't run away or anything.  Wear a
hat, but don't wear a ski mask and sunglasses.  Look normal, yet
try and conceal as much of you're looks as possible.

If you do this right,  you will look like a normal person, and
the people will forget about  you in the month or so it takes the
credit agency to do anything about the fraud.

Advanced Fraud
==============

To order more advanced, (ie: from Northwestern, or things that
cost alot of money), you will need the following (usually):

      The Driver's License Number
      The Bank or Interbank Number (For MasterCard)
      The Billing Addresss

Sometimes this will be written on the carbon.  But the best way
is just to use TRW...if you have a password for it.

Miscellanous
============

Reading an issue of U.S News and World Report (June 3, 1985)
yesterday, I found an article on Phreaking, Fraud, and BBS's.
Very interesting.

Said something about mailboxing, which is going through a company
mailbox looking for let's say bills and the like which would
have a credit number on it.  Sounds interesting.  Go on a
Saturday, and look in the mailboxes.  The last few days of a
month would be a good idea, since maybe you could get lucky and
snipe their Visa statement.  That just goes to show that reading >some<
value.

Look for cards like this one:

     5024 0000 6184 3847

The second cluster means it's a "preferred" card, and you can
order more stuff with it.  Some cards only have 13 digits (i.e:
5024 000 618 787).

If you think you have ordered the limit of you're card, verify
it.  You do this by calling a dial up (usually  800), giving them
a merchant number, the card number, the name on the card, the
expiration date, and the amount to be spent.   They will tell you
it the card has enough money for the purchase.  Get a dial up and
merchant number by going to the Department Store.  They are
usually written on the phones.

For MasterCard, the Interbank number isRyight below the na}~sn
the carbon.  Nisa cards contain a bank number in one of the
clusters.

Don't order from Northwestern.  There prices are not worth all of
the questions you have to answer.

Order from Conroy-LaPointe at 800/547-1289, they are quite
easy.

Conclusion
==========

There are no old carders.  You quit, or you get caught.  Plan
what you want to get, and don't try and rush your frauds.

The first rule of fraud is, "Greed Kills."  I think being
arrested by the feds and having to face my parents and lose my
computer about the same as death.  But what is life without a
little risk?

Try to sell most of the things you card.  If there is no stolen
(carded) stuff in you're house, they might go easier on you.

the information in this file.  It is for informational purposes
only.  And if you believe that, please leave me mail on Smog
City about a business opportunity.  I have this bridge...

         Common Rocket Fuel
         ------------------
  Materials:

1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) or
 "Saltpeter". This can be obtained
 from a drugstore, or ordered from
  a chemical supply house.

2.) Sugar (Powdered is the best)

   Procedure:

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 Nitrate
    and 1/2 Sugar.

2.) Take an old cooking pan, and
    melt the two together. There
    is NO way for it to ignite.

3.) It should turn into a fudgey
    looking compound. Pour this
    compound into a rocket engine
    such as a cardboard tube, and
    set a fuse into the compound
    and let the compound harden.

         Chlorate Mixtures
         -----------------

NOTE: The main ingredient for this
      experiment is potassium or
      sodium chlorate.  Both of these
      will do equally well.  However,
      both may prove difficult to
      find.  Probably the only way to
      get it would be to order it
      through a chemical supply house.

Materials:
----------

1) Potassium chlorate or sodium
   chlorate.

2) Powdered charcoal

3) Powdered aluminum

4) Sulfur

Procedure:
----------

NOTE:  There is no set procedure for
       making chlorate mixtures.
       The only special thing ABOUT
       chlorate mixtures is that
       they have a chlorate in them.
       Experiment with diffiernt
       proportions of each of the
       ingredients. All of the
       chlorate mixtures I made had
       no set procedure and I just
       experimented with the
       proportions of each of the
       ingredients. Most of your
       mixture, however, should be
       potassium chlorate or sodium
       chlorate.

1)  Make sure that you mix the
    sulfur and charcoal and aluminum
    first.  You may grind  these in
    a mortar and pestal to get a good
    mix of these ingredients.

2)  Add potassium chlorate or sodium
   chlorate.  Mix them VERY CAREFULLY
    in the mortar and pestal.  DO NOT
    GRIND the mixture once the
    chlorate has been added or it will
    ignite and burn the shit out of
    you.

3)  You now may use the mixture for
    whatever you want to.  Chlorate
    mixtures are some of the best
    compositions there are and, in
    my experiences, they are the best
    except for model  rocket
    propellant (procedure for making
    this is given later).

        > Green Goddess <
          -------------
Materials
---------

1.) Zinc (Zn) <---NOTE: This is not the
                        same as Zinc
                        Oxide!
2.) Sulfur (S)

Procedure
---------

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 and 1/2.

2.) MAKE SURE that you mix them very
    well. The best way to do so, is to
    put the mixture in a jar with a lid
    and shake it up for 15-60 seconds,
    until it is all a greyish color.

3.) To ignite, use a fuse, or throw a
    match into the powder. WARNING,
    this burns very very quickly, and
    produces smoke. Also it burns at
    a fairly high temperature. It will
    surprise you when you throw a match
    into it. There will be a delay, and
    then all of a sudden, it will flash
    up, and is capable of burning the
    hell out of you.
=======================================
Common Uses
-----------
1.) Rocket Fuel
2.) Bombs <--- NOTE: The best way to do
                     this is to take
                     it and compress
                     it into cardboard
                     tubing.
3.) Smoke bombs (Cardboard tube w/ big
                 hole.)
4.) Flare bombs.
5.) The rest is up to your imagination

          GOOD LUCK!

Once both ends are nice and snug, it is ready.  You now have a small 
grenade. They can be made in various sizes.  Easily stored in the 
clove box of your car, or in a school locker.  The possibile uses 
are endless.             

It can be thrown or dropped onto any hard surface to ignite the 
phosphorus.  The gases formed from the combustion will force one 
or both of the bolts out of the nut.  The distace the bolt(s) travel, 
and its volocity, depend on the amount of phosphorus used.  

Of course the larger the nut and bolt, the more explosive needed to 
force them out effectivly.  It works on the same principal as the 
bullet being forced out of the gun barrel, except that the direction 
in which the bolts fly is never known, so watch yourself.

I haven't expiramented, but I'm sure that just about any, dry, shock 
sensitive chemical can be used in place of the phosphorus.  The head 
of each bolt can be sharpened to a point for more effectiveness as 
well.  Of course there are many variations to this design, I have 
seen special nuts that are quite wide, allowing the use of more 
explosive.  Look in the section of your hardware store where small 
(or large) plumbing pipe is sold.  There are pieces that have threads 
on each end to screw somthing on, but now we are talking about 
something that more resembles a pipe bomb than a devise which only 
causes a tiny disturbance (but is still dangerous).

                       WATS EXTENDERS

Many people think of phone phreaks as slime, out to rip off Bell 
for all she is worth.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  

Granted, there are some who get there kicks just by making free calls, 
however they are not true phone phreaks.  Real phone phreaks are 
"telecommunications hobbyists" who experiment, play with and learn 
from the phone system.  Occasionally this experimenting, and a need 
to communicate with other phreaks (without going broke), leads to 
free calls.  The free calls are but a small subset of a TRUE phone 
phreaks activities.
        
Until several years ago, the phreaks main tool for free calls was the
Blue Box.  In recent years however, Bell has made GREAT strides in 
their security and detection of Blue Box's.  While box's still work, 
their use is becoming EXTREMELY dangerous.  With the advent of CCIS, 
the places where a Blue Box will work are rapidly decreasing, and 
within several years the Box will be totallt obsolete.

Thus for their communications needs, phreaks have turned to other
methods, one being: WATS EXTENDERS.

Many companies throughout the United States have a salesman in the
field that must contact a large amount of customers long distance 
by phone. To pay for these calls, generally the salesman use the 
companies Bell credit card (Now called a "Calling Card") this is 
quite expensive to the company. Several years ago, someone came up 
with a neat money saving idea. Since the company already had an an 
INWATS (800) number for salesmen to call in orders to the main plant, 
and since the company had a flat rate OUTWATS line to call customers 
during the day.
  
Why not couple them together after hours so that the salesman calls 
the companies INWATS 800 number, then gets connected up to OUTWATS.  
This would mean he could call anywhere in the United States. from
anywhere at no charge to him!  This arrangement would save the company
tremendous amounts of long distance charges since they had the WATS 
lines anyway, and the WATS was a lot more cost efficient than Credit 
Cards.
        
This arrangement was exactly how early "WATS EXTENDERS" worked.
During WATS (800) scanning (For how to do this, read "Napolean 
Solo's" EXCELLENT article in issue 55) phreaks discovered these 
WATS EXTENDERS, and found they could call anywhere in the country 
just by calling the extenders 800 number, then (Using Touch Tone of 
course) dial the number they wanted. The companies soon realized 
that their extenders were being messed with and decided to add some 
security to prevent tampering. It was set up so that when a salesman 
dialed the WATS EXTENDER, he would hear what sounds like a dial tone.  
The salesman then keyed in a four digit Touch Tone secret access 
code.  If the code was incorrect a high-low tone would result, and 
the extender would have to be re-dialed.  If the code was correct, 
and second internal PBX dial tone would result.  The salesman would
then access the companies OUTWATS line by hitting 8 or 9 (usually)
and dial wherever he wanted.
        
The four digit access code posed a problem to phreaks since only 1 
out of 9999 possible codes worked, and the 800 number had to be 
re-dialed each timeand try another.
        

Many a phone phreak spent long nights breaking the four digit codes 
and then using the extenders themselves!  Most companies change 
the code every few months so the phreaks would have to start over 
again.  (Also company employees that were not authorized to know, 
but found out from "leaks"). Many of you have probably heard of the 
infamous computer "Charlie". For those who haven't, several years 
ago Charlie was brought to life by Capn Crunce (Now retired from 
the communications service) Charlie was an Apple ][ computer with a 
special board which allowed it to Touch Tone dial numbers extremely 
rapidly (D/A) then "listen" to the results (A/D).
        
Charlie was put to use calling a given WATS EXTENDER, trying an access
code, if the high-low tone was heard (meaning an incorrect code), 
Charlie hung up and dialed again, trying the next sequential code.  
Charlie would sit working for hours, and when it found the code, 
it would print it on it's display screen.  VERY effective!

Unfortunately the only problem with Charlie was the he was very
noticeable to Bell.  Every time an 800 number is dialed, and 
AMA record is punched at the C.O. thus it looks real phunny to Bell 
to see that you have called Dry Dock orange shippers 800 number 
in Florida 3,750 times at 2:00 AM with each call lasting 1 second!  
Since Charlie was not very easily portable to pay phones this was 
a real problem. There are many WATS EXTENDERS reportedly presently 
in service.  Most working as described, with some taking more than 
a four digit code, and some even responding to voice input!

It should be pointed out however, that should any of you crack any 
WATS EXTENDER access codes and attempt to use them, you are gulity 
of Theft of communications services from the company who owns it, 
and Bell is very willing and able to help nail you!  WATS EXTENDERS 
can get you in every bit as much trouble as a Blue Box should you 
be caught.
        
Most WATS EXTENDERS also record all numbers call from them on OUTWATS.
If the company detects the extender being mis-used, they will usually 
first try to change the access code.  If the abuse continues and the 
get mad enough they will contact Bell who will help them investigate 
all the numbers you called!

Thus, as in most things those of you who are determined to play with
WATS EXTENDERS, do so from a pay phone and only to institutional 
switchboards, or people with short memories.  By the way, on some 
"Money First" payphones (as as opposed to "Dial Tone First") the 
Touch Tone pad is cut off after the WATS call is complete. (Because 
of polarity reversal)  It can be re-activated by depositing a dime 
after the connection is made, which you will get back after
you hang up.

Also please remember the opening of this article.  DO NOT use WATS
EXTENDERS just to make free calls all the time!  Experiment with them 
and learn what they can do and how they work.  I think you will 
learn a lot!!

Welcome to basics of hacking i: dec's in this article you will learn 
how to log in to dec's, logging out, and all the fun stuff to do 
in-between. All of this information is based on a standard dec system.  
Since there are dec systems 10 and 20, and we favor, the dec 20,
there will be more info on them in this article. It just so happens 
that the dec 20 is also the more common of the two, and is used by 
much more interesting people (if you know what we mean...) Ok, the 
first thing you want to do when you are receiving carrier from a dec 
system is to find out the format of login names.  

You can do this by  looking at who is on the system. Dec=> `   (the
'exec' level prompt) you=> sy sy is short for sy(stat) and shows you 
the system status.  You should see the format of login names... A systat 
usually comes up in this form: job  line  program  user job:  the job 
number (not important unless you want to log them off later) line:  
what line they are on (used to talk to them...) These are both two or 
three digit  numbers. Program:  whatprogram are they running under?  
If it says 'exec' they aren't doing anything at all... User:  
ahhhahhhh!  This is the user name they are logged in under...
Copy the format, and hack yourself out a working code... 
Login format is as such: dec=> ` you=> login username password 
username is the username in the format you saw above in the systat.  
After you hit the space after your username, it will stop echoing 
characters back to your screen.  This is the password you are typing 
in...  Remember, people  usually use their name, their dog's name, 
the name of a favorite character in a book, or something like this.
 A few clever people have it set to a key cluster (qwerty or asdfg).  
Pw's can be from 1 to 8 characters long, anything after that is 
ignored. You are finally in... It would be nice to have a little help, 
wouldn't it? 

Just type a ? Or the word help, and it will give you a whole list 
of topics... Some handy characters for you to know would be the 
control keys, wouldn't it? Backspace on a dec 20 is rub which is 255 
on your ascii chart.  On the dec 10 it is cntrl-h. To abort a long 
listing or a program, cntrl-c works fine.  Use cntrl-o to stop long 
output to the terminal.  This is handy when playing a game, but you 
don't want to cntrl-c out.  Cntrl-t for the time.  Cntrl-u will kill 
the whole line you are typing at the moment.  You may accidently run 
a program where the only way out is a cntrl-x, so keep that in reserve. 
Cntrl-s to stop listing, cntrl-q to continue on both systems.  
Is your terminal having trouble??  Like, it pauses for no reason, or 
it doesn't backspace right? 

This is because both systems support many terminals, and you haven't 
told it what yours is yet...  You are using a vt05 (isn't  that funny?  
I thought I had an apple) so you need to tell it you are one. 
Dec=> ` you=> information terminal or...   You=> info ter this shows you 
what your terminal is set up as... Dec=>  all sorts of shit, then the 
` you=>  set ter vt05 this sets your terminal type to vt05. Now let's
see what is in the account (here after abbreviated acct.) That you 
have hacked onto... Say => dir short for directory, it shows you what 
the user of the code has save to the disk.  

There should be a format like this:    xxxxx.Ooo xxxxx is the file 
name, from 1 to 20 characters long.  Ooo is the file type, one of: 
exe, txt, dat, bas, cmd   and a few others that are system dependant. 
Exe is a compiled program that can be run (just by typing its name 
at the `). Txt is a text file, which you can see by typing=> type 
xxxxx.Txt do not try to=> type xxxxx.Exe this is very bad for your 
terminal and will tell you absolutly nothing. 

Dat is data they have saved. Bas is a basic program, you can have it
typed out for you. Cmd is a command type file, a little too 
complicated to go into here. Try => take xxxxx.Cmd by the way, there 
are other users out there who may have files you can use (gee, why 
else am I here?). Type => dir <*.*>  (Dec 20)      => dir [*,*]   
(dec 10) * is a wildcard, and will allow you to access the files on 
other accounts if the user has it set for public access. If it isn't 
set for public access, then you won't see it. To run that program:
dec=> ` you=> username program-name username is the directory you saw 
the file listed under, and file name was what else but the file name? 
**  You are not alone  ** remember, you said (at the very start) sy  
short for systat, and how we said this showed the other users on the 
system?  Well, you can talk to them, or at least send a message to 
anyone you see listed in a systat.  You can do this by: dec=> the 
user list (from your systat) you=> talk username     (dec20) send 
username     (dec 10) talk allows you and them immediate transmission 
of whatever you/they type to be sent to the other.  

Send only
allow you one message to be sent, and only after you hit <return>. 
With send, they will send back to you, with talk you can just keep 
going. By the way, you may be noticing with the talk command that 
what you type is still acted upon by the parser (control program).  
To avoid the constant error messages type either: you=>  ;your 
message you=>  rem        your message the semi-colon tells the parser 
that what follows is just a comment.  Rem is short for 'remark' and 
ignores you from then on until you type a cntrl-z or cntrl-c, at which 
point it puts you back in the exec mode.

To break the connection from a talk command type: you=>  break priv's: 
if you happen to have privs, you can do all sorts of things.  First 
of all, you have to activate those privs. You=> enable this gives you 
a $ prompt, and allows you to do this:  whatever you can do to your 
own directory you can now do to  any other directory.   To create a 
new acct. Using your privs, just type =>  build username if username 
is old, you can edit it, if it is new, you can define it to be whatever 
you wish. Privacy means nothing to a user with privs.  By the way, 
there are various levels of privs:  operator, wheel, cia wheel is 
the most powerful, being that he can log in from anywhere and have 
his powers.  Operators have their power because they are at a special 
terminal allowing them the privs.  Cia is short for 'confidential 
information access', which allows you a low level amount of privs. 
Not to worry though, since you can read the system log file, which also
has the passwords to all the other accounts. To de-activate your privs, 
type you=> disable

when you have played your greedy heart out, you can finally leave 
the system with the command=>  logout this logs the job you are using 
off the system (there may be varients of this such as kjob, or killjob). 
By the way, you can say (if you have privs)  => logout username afl

               *           Unix               *
               ******************************** 
 
Welcome to the basics of hacking II:

Unix is a trademark of bell labs ** **  (and you know what *that* 
means).  In this article, we discuss the unix system that runs 
on the various vax systems.  If you are on another unix-type system, 
some commands may differ, but since it is licenced to bell, they can't 
make many changes.   Hacking onto a unix system is very difficult, 
and in this case, we advise having an inside source, if possible. The 
reason it is difficult to hack a vax is this:  many vax, after you get 
a carrier from them, respond=> login: they give you no chance to see 
what the login name format is.  Most commonly used are single words, 
under 8 digits, usually the person's name.  

There is a way around this: most vax have an acct. Called 'suggest' 
for people to use to make a suggestion to the system root terminal.  
This is usually watched by the system operator, but at late  he is 
probably at home sleeping or screwing someone's brains out. So we can
write a program to send at the vax this type of a message: a screen
freeze (cntrl-s), screen clear (system dependant), about 255 garbage
characters, and then a command to create a login acct., After which
you clear the screen again, then un- freeze the terminal.  

What this does: when the terminal is frozen, it keeps a buffer of 
what is sent.  Well, the buffer is about 127 characters long. So you 
overflow it with trash, and then you send a command line to create 
an acct. (System dependant).  After this you clear the buffer and 
screen again, then unfreeze the terminal.  This is a bad way to do
it, and it is much nicer if you just send a command to the terminal 
to shut the system down, or whatever you are after... There is always,
*always* an acct. Called root, the most powerful acct. To be on, 
since  it has all of the system files on it.  If you hack your way 
onto this one, then everything is easy from here on... 

On the unix system, the abort key is the cntrl-d key.  Watch how
many times you hit this, since it is also a way to log off the 
system! A little about unix architechture: the root directory, 
called root, is where the system resides.  After this come a few 
'sub' root directories, usually to group things (stats here, priv 
stuff here, the user log here...). Under this comes the superuser 
(the operator of the system), and then finally the normal users. In
the unix 'shell' everything is treated the same. By this we mean:  
you can access a  program the same way you access a user directory, 
and so on.  The way the unix system was written, everything, users 
included, are just programs belonging to the root directory.  Those 
of you who hacked onto the root, smile, since you can screw 
everything... 

The main level (exec level) prompt on the unix system is the $, 
and if you are on the root, you have a # (super- user prompt). Ok, 
a few basics for the system... To see where you are, and what paths 
are act; G i] reguards to your user account, then type => pwd this 
shows your acct. Seperated by a slash with another pathname (acct.), 
Possibly manytimes.

             ** The basics of hacking III: Data   **
             ***************************************


Welcome to the basics of hacking III: data general computers.  
Data general is favored by large corporations who need to have a lot 
of data on-line. The data general aos, which stands for advanced 
operating system, is a version of bastardized unix.  All the commands
which were in the unix article, will work on a data general.
Once again, we have tb^"|yoblem of not knowing the format for the login 
name on the data general you want to hack. As seems to be standard, 
try names from one to 8 digits long.  Data general designed the computer 
to be for busi- nessmen, and is thus very simplistic, and basically 
fool proof (but not damn fool proof).  It follows the same login 
format as the unix system: dg=> login: you=> username dg=> password: 
you=> password passwords can be a maximum of 8 characters, and they 
are almost always set to a default of 'aos' or 'dg'. (Any you know 
about businessmen...) A word about control characters: cntrl-o 
stops massive print-outs to the screen, but leaves you in whatever 
mode you were.  

(A technical word on what this actually does:  it tells the cpu to 
ignore the terminal, and prints everything out to the cpu! This is  
about 19200 baud, and so it seems like it just cancels.)  Cntrl-u
kills the line you are typing at the time.  Now for the weird one:  
cntrl-c tells the cpu to stop, and wait for another cntrl character.  
To stop a program, you actually need to type cntrl-c and then a 
cntrl-b. Once you get on, type 'help'.  Many dg (data general) 
computers are sold in a package deal, which also gets the company 
free customizing.  So you never know what commands there might be.  

So we will follow what is known as the 'eclipse standard', or
what it comes  out of the factory like. To find out the files 
on the directory you are using, type => dir to run a program, 
just like on a dec, just type its name.  Other than this, and 
running other people's programs, there really isn't a standard... 
***  Hark, yon other system users  *** to see who is on, type =>
who (and a lot of the other unix commands, remember?).  This shows 
the other users, what they are doing, and what paths they are 
connected across.  This is handy, so try a few of those paths 
yourself.  To send a message, say => send username this is a one 
time message, just like send on the dec 10.  From here on, try 
commands from the other previous files and from the 'help' listing.
Superuser: if you can get privs, just say: => superuser on and you 
turn those privs on! By the way, you remember that computers keep 
a log of what people do? Type: => syslog /stop and it no longer 
records anything you do on the system, or any of the other users.  

It screams to high heaven that it was you who turned it off, 
but it keeps no track of any accounts created or whatever else 
you may do.  You can say=>  syslog /start   to turn it back on 
(now why would you want to do something like that?????) To exit from
the system, type=> bye and the system will hang up on you. Most 
of the systems around, including decs, vax's, and dg's, have games. 
These are usually located in a path or directory of the name  games 
or <games> or games:  try looking in them, and you may find some 
trek games, adventure, zork, wumpus (with bent arrows in hand) or 
a multitude of others.  There may  also be games called 'cb' or 
'forum'. These are a sort of computer conference call. Use them on
w-Wsnds, and you  can meet all sorts of interesting  people.

If you would like to see more articles on hacking (this time far 
more than  just the basics), or maybe articles on networks and such, 
then leave us mail if we are on the system, or have the sysop search 
us down.  We call a lot of places, and you may just find us. This 
completes the series of articles on hacking...  These articles were: 
the basics of hacking: introduction the basics of hacking i: dec's the 
basics of hacking ii: vax's (unix) the basics of hacking iii: dg's
