========================================
 
           Ever get an operator who gave
you a hard time, and you didn't know
what to do? Well if the operator hears
you use a little Bell jargon, she might
wise up. Here is a little diagram
(excuse the artwork) of the structure of
operators
/--------\     /------\     /-----
!Operator!-- > ! S.A. ! --->! BOS !
\--------/     \------/     \-----/
   !
   !
   V
/-------------\
! Group Chief !
\-------------/
 
           Now most of the operators are
not bugged, so they can curse at you, if
they do ask INSTANTALY for the "S.A." or
the Service Assistant. The operator does
not report to her (95% of them are hers)
but they will solve most of your
problems. She MUST give you her name as
she connects & all of these calls are
bugged. If the SA gives you a rough time
get her BOS (Business Office Superviser)
on the line. S/He will almost always
back her girls up, but sometimes the SA
will get tarred and feathered. The
operator reports to the Group Chief, and
S/He will solve 100% of your problems,
but thte chances of getting S/He on the
line are nill.
           If a lineman (the guy who
works out on the poles) or an
installation man gives you the works ask
to speak to the Installation Foreman,
that works wonders.

           Here is some other bell
jargon, that might come in handy if you
are having trouble with the line. Or
they can be used to lie your way out of
situations....
 
           An Erling is a line busy for
1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies A
Permanent Signal is that terrible
howling you get if you disconnect, but
don't hang up.
           Everyone knows what a busy
signal is, but some idiots think that is
the *Actual* ringing of the phone, when
it just is a tone "beeps" when the phone
is ringing, wouldn't bet on this though,
it can (and does) get out of sync.
            When you get a busy signal
that is 2 times as fast as the normal
one, the person you are tring to reach
isn't really on the phone, (he might
be), it is accutally the signal that a
trunk line somewhere is busy and they
haven't or can't reroute your call.
Sometimes you will get a Recording, or
if you get nothing at all (Left High &
Dry in fone terms) all the recordings
are being used and the system is really
overused, will probably go down in
alittle while. This happend when Kennedy
was shot, the system just couldn't
handle the calls. By the way this is
called the "reorder signal" and the
trunk line is "blocked".
           One more thing, if an
overseas call isn't completed and
doesn't generate any money for AT&T, is
is called an "Air & Water Call".
