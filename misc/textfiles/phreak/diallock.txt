	       DIAL LOCKS

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN AN OFFICE OR SOMEWHERE AND WANTED TO MAKE A FREE
FONE CALL BUT SOME ASSHOLE PUT A LOCK ON THE FONE TO PREVENT OUT-GOING CALLS?

FRET NO MORE PHELLOW PHREAKS, FOR EVERY SYSTEM CAN BE BEATEN WITH A LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE!

THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO BEAT THIS OBSTACLE, FIRST PICK THE LOCK, I DON'T HAVE THE
TIME TO TEACH LOCKSMITHING SO WE GO TO THE SECOND METHOD WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.

TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE, WHEN YOU PICK UP THE FONE YOU COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
KNOW AS A LOCAL LOOP.  WHEN YOU HANG-UP YOU BREAK THE CIRCUIT.	WHEN YOU DIAL
(PULSE) IT ALSO BREAKS THE CIRCUT BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH TO HANG UP!  SO YOU CAN
"PUSH-DIAL." TO DO THIS YOU >RAPIDLY< DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO
DIAL AN OPERATOR (AND THEN GIVE HER THE NUMBER YOU WANT CALLED) >RAPIDLY< &
>EVENLY< DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK 10 TIMES.  TO DIAL 634-1268, DEPRESS 6 X'S
PAUSE, THEN 3 X'S, PAUSE, THEN 4 X'S, ETC.  IT TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE BUT
YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.  TRY PRACTICING WITH YOUR OWN # SO YOU'LL GET A BUSY
TONE WHEN RIGHT.  IT'LL ALSO WORK ON TOUCH-TONE(TM) SINCE A DTMF LINE WILL ALSO
ACCEPT PULSE.  ALSO, NEVER DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK FOR MORE THAN A SECOND OR
IT'LL HANG-UP!

FINALLY, REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO THAT FONE AS THE ASSHOLE
WHO PUT THE LOCK ON IT!
