     Well  friends,  Sprint has declared war on the phone phreaks 
and  is  starting to set traps,  trace lines,  and  question  the 
SYSOPs  of  BBS  systems.   I thank that this has  gone  on  long 
enough!

     It  time we start to fight back.   What I would  suggest  is 
that  everybody find five or ten access codes and put these on  a 
flyer  with a local access number and instructions on how to  use 
the system and how to find more codes.  Next, make a LARGE number 
of  copies  of  this  flyer  and distribute  them  as  widely  as 
possible.   Put  them on cars in the school parking lot,  in  the 
local phone booths, on bulletin boards around colleges, etc.

     If Sprint starts experiencing a VERY large number of ripoffs 
then a number of things could happen.  The bright boy in security 
who decided to start the crack-down may get fired,  paying custo-
mers may get fed up with the huge  bills,  SPC may make the codes 
longer  and thus lose customers because of the  inconvenience  of 
the  longer  codes.   In any case,  SPC will have so many  people 
using the system for free that the chances of them getting anyone 
of us is so small as to be insignificant.
