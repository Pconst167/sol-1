Some phones in shops, firms and other places have had it's keyboards removed.


BUT BUT BUT... This doesn't matter.. You can call from them anyway...
With a little practise:

In stead of using the keyboard you can use the off-hook/on-hook switch.
In stead of typing a number, press this switch very fast the number of
time that matches with the number you want to dial.

In stead of 5 - Press the switch fast 5 times

NOTE: Press the switch 10 times in stead of 0

Practise a while - And call FREE
