 features and how to use them.

 Call your phreak service number (in Germany this would be a 0130 #).
 Hit down [R] (this will break the line) and dial the number you wanna reach.

 [Q] -> This will send a 2600/2400 Hz tone (HangUp)
        Timing : 150ms
        Delay  :  30ms

 [W] -> This will send a 2400/2400 Hz tone
        Timing : 100ms
        Delay  :  30ms

 [R] -> This will send both tones with the same timings and delays.

        only 10 numbers.
