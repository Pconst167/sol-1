Subject: Third Party Billing


- New Terms and Old Ones-

  NPA - Area Code

  AOS - Automatic Operator Services

  LD  - Long Distance

Prefix - The first three digits of your local number.

Suffix - The Last four digits of your number.


- Introduction -


  Well, want to phreak but you do not like use codes? Well, this is for you.
This is a simple procedure to do and it works to get your warze from the good
ol' LD boards.  Ok, I will start out with some simple ideas to get yea
thinking in these terms. It is real simple !!



- The Principle -


  I am sure you all have maid a collect call before. It use to be that a
operator would ask the line you are calling weather or not to accept the
call. This has changed ! It is all done by computer now (which i will call
AOS), by way of asking you to state you name, AOS plays it back on a answer
of the second party. Tones are then used, by the second party, to accept the
collect call or not to accept the call. Ok, on local calls, AOS also runs
third party billing (charging to another persons line). The local third
party billing can be operator free if it is done right.



- Third Line Billing -

I will explain it as we go down the steps.


   Steps          :           Explanation


0-Prefix-Suffix      Zer0 and the number you want to call. For LD calls dial
                     0-NPA-Prefix-Suffix.

12                   Ok, when the bell bitch says, "enter your card
                     number."  Either enter your card number or type one-one
                     for a collect call, one-two for party billing,
                     and one-six to be  instructed in Spanish. Type
                     "one-two". NOTE this is for 619 NPA other area may be
                     different in different areas, but the same idea.


NPA-Prefix-Suffix    You have to type in the NPA of the number you want to
                     bill to even if the call is local.
                     NOTE: Here is the challenge, you have to find a number
                     that you can bill to (i have heard that sometimes
                     billing is voice verification, but i have never run into
                     that problem before, the billing process is done by
                     AOS by seeing if the number is registered for billing.
                     NOTE: all numbers are already registered for third
                     parity billing (i mean they will accept the billing),
                     but there are a few lines that have a block against
                     someone doing that (like the ones on my home lines).
                     NOTE: On LD calls this must be told to the AT&T operator
                     YES TOLD! But only for a sec. It is well worth it.


#                    Good ol' pound symbol. It acts like a enter key. Press
                     after you have typed in the number you want to bill to.
                     NOTE: Not used on LD calls!



  So, you have found a few numbers that accept billing and you want to call
LD. Now you are going through AT&T. This method will still work real well,
but you have to talk to a operator. Some times their is voice verification, SO
I HAVE HEARD but i have not come across it as yet! Just tell the AT&T
operator what number you want to have your call billed to and you have a
direct connection. Yes, it is that easy !!!


- Conclusion -


 This is a fairly safe way of getting free phone calls. Bell maid the mistake
by putting in AOS! WELL PHREAK IT UP ! & while you are at it be sure and
call...
