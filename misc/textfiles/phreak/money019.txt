Well, to clear things up....I am not in jail, and haven't been in quite a 
while.  I don't think I am going to jail, and for those of you who know what
happened, I am none too happy with certain parties responsible for my recent
run-in with the law.  Before too long, however even though I don't even know 
one of the guys involved, I _WILL_ get my revenge.  For those of you who don't
know what happened, you don't need to know, it's none of your fucking business.

Anyways, back to brighter subjects....for those of you European guys who can
still box, I got some new routings for yahz.

Some of these have been published before...if so, who gives a fuck.

AT&T/BOC ROUTING CODES                                                     
                                                                           
The following is a list of routing codes used by AT&T and Bell             
Operating Companies (BOC) that you can blue box to. Most codes are         
used by dialing KP+NPA+XXX+ST where XXX= the code, except where noted.     
There are notes attached after this list. Codes marked with a ? are        
unfamiliar to us.

Notes:                                                                
                                                                      
(1) The Rate Quote System is a voice response system used by operators
to obtain routing information. The system, now being phased out, was  
used as an alternative to calling the Rate and Route operator.        
Operators would key-in required routing information and a synthesized 
voice would respond. Though the RQS is still operational, operators   
now obtain routing information from COMPIS (See note 10).
                                                                     
KP+DD+ONPA+NXX+TNPA+NXX+ST to get the "rate step" for:               
                                                                     
   DD = 00 Now                                                       
   DD = 01 Day Call     (08:00-17:00)                                
   DD = 02 Evening Call (17:00-23:00)                                
   DD = 03 Night Call   (23:00-08:00)                                
                                                                     
KP+04+?  Something with Mexico, unclear.                             
                                                                     
KP+05+NPA+NXX+ST Gives the routing for a BOC inward (See note 9)     
                                                                     
KP+06+NPA+NXX+ST gives the routing for for an AT&T inward operator   
(See note 9)                                                         
                                                                     
KP+07+XXXXXXX+ST  Reads back the numbers you just typed              
                                                                     
KP+08+?  Something with Enterprise and Zenith numbers, unclear.      
                                                                     
KP+09+NPA+NXX+ST Gives you the current time for the area and exchange
just dialed.
                                                                      
(2) When a code is marked spare, that means that there is no current  
or planned networkwide usage. It still may be utilized as a           
non-standard POTS exchange for WATS service by local companies.       
                                                                      
(3) When a code is marked reserved, it means that there may be planned
networkwide usage.                                                    
                                                                      
(4) This code is used by an AT&T custom service. It may be thought of 
as acting like a special area code and takes the following dialing    
format: KP+XXX+YYY+YYYY+ST where XXX is the code in question and Y can
be any number 0-9.                                                    
                                                                      
(5) All "points not on an NPA" and "Cable Control" function as pseudo 
area codes and are followed by a telephone number.                    
                                                                      
(6) Calls to the IOC are dialled as follows: KP+160+CCC+ST CCC=Country
Code (i.e. 044 or 144 for the UK).                                    
                                                                      
(7) These are special codes used with Equal Access. They are as       
follows:                                              

KP+138+PIC+ST then KP+CC+cc+xxxxx+ST                                  
KP+158+PIC+ST                                                         
                                                                      
Where PIC is the primary carrier code, CC is the country code and cc  
is city code. xxxxx is subscriber number. We are not sure exactly when
and where these are used.                                             
                                                                      
(8) All four and five digit codes are dialed as follows:              
KP+NPA+XXXX+ST or KP+NPA+XXXXX+ST. Keep in mind that not every code is
in use in every NPA.                                                  
                                                                      
(9) The format for an AT&T inward is usually KP+NPA+121+ST -- In some 
small cities there is an extra code used called a Terminating Toll    
Centre (TTC) or sometimes just a city code. If a TTC is used, the     
format is KP+NPA+TTC+121+ST. To get an inward with most BOCs you dial 
KP+NPA+11591+ST but there are some which use a format of              
KP+NPA+TTC+121+ST. To get the inward routing for a particular         
exchange, use the Rate Quote System (RQS).                            
                                                                      
(10) The number for Rate and Route was 800+141+1212 but this was      
discontinued sometime last year (1987) when the TSPS operators got a
computer terminal called COMPIS. In each there is an inward which acts
like a Rate and Route operator. In New York it is 716+121.            
                                                                      
(11) With the advent of Alliance Teleconferencing, use of the         
conference operator dwindled. There are currently four operator       
handling conferences. They are as follows: Atlanta 404+11511,         
Minneapolis 507+11511, New York 212+11511 and Oakland 415+11511.      
800-225-0233 translates to the conference operator closest to you.    
                                                                      
(12) The Marine Operator is used in calling ships that are close to   
the United States. There is an operator called the "High Seas"        
operator who can be reached by dialing 800-SEA-CALL (800-732-2255).   
The High Seas operator is a service of AT&T, while Marisat is an      
independent company. A High Seas call can go to any ocean for $14.98  
for the first 3 minutes and $4.98 for each additional minute. A       
Marisat only to three oceans and costs $10 a minute.                  
                                                                      
(13) 116X and 116XX are used to verify an AT&T Calling Card number.   
You dial KP+NPA+116XX+ST when you hear a "bong" you dial the calling  
card number. If you use 11611 you enter the number in Touch Tone and  
if you use 11621 you enter the card number in MF using KP and ST.

(14) These ISC codes are used to provide alternate routing for        
electro-mechanical switches. Some older electro-mechanical switches,  
for example #5 Crossbar (5XB) cannot outpulse 011+CCC (CCC=Country    
Code) for international dialing. AT&T has set up these special codes  
to handle international calls. A 5XB can dial KP+18X+ST. They would   
then receive a wink (short blast of 2600 Hz) and would proceed to dial
the country code and number. If you want to make an international call
you dial KP+(NPA)+18X+ST where the NPA is optional. After the wink    
dial the country code, city code and number. The "," after the city   
name is the switch number if there is more then one 4-ESS in that     
city.                                                                 
                                                                      
(15) The 187 code was assigned to Atlanta until up to the end of      
February 1988. AT&T is in the process in routing the calls to the     
Sherman Oaks Office in California.                                    
                                                                      
(16) To make international calls dial KP+011+CCC+ST where CCC is the  
country code; and then dial KP+CC+XXXXXXX+ST where CC is the city code
and XXXXXXXX is the telephone number.                                 
                                                                      
Since boxing is impossible here in the states, I have to trust my sources
when I give out these codes.  However, there is no reason to doubt them
for a minute.

Now for my gripe session.

Ok, first to the narc(s):  You know who you  are.  When this blows over
you will pay.  No one fucks with Money Incorporated without getting
fucked back.

Lord Helmet:  You don't like the Money Inc Texts.  Don't waste your credits
downloading em.  Oh yeah, you're probably a paying lamer on the board.  Well
don't waste my time.  I don't write these for lame fucks like you.  As far 
as kicking my ass goes, it should be too hard to find where I live.  That is
if you wanna get your ass served with my fuckin shotgun.

Pennsylvania State Police and Tpr. Mowrey:  You can all suck a fat dick.

Anyone who disagrees with me or doesn't like me can fuck off.

Now for the greetz (cool people):

CCRider, Sonic Fury and MethodMan (Red Alert):  The Money Inc crew.  If we
stick together, we will overcome the lamer narc threat.

Subhumanz, Dr. V., and the rest of LSD:  True class in this shitty world
of lamers and narcs.

Dr. Shrinker, Knight Rider and the rest of the Diabolical folks.

Nighthawk and Radiance:  You're the only person who gets my requests!

Shockwave, Tunk and the rest of TAO.

Anyone else I forgot, I don't apologize, cuz I didn't forget you.


COPYWRONG 1994, MONEY INCORPORATED PRODUCTIONS
ALL RIGHTS LOST IN DOUBLE OVERTIME.

DISCLAIMER:  You suck, it's not my fault.

"YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE US VERY MUCH.  THAT'S OK CUZ WE KNOW YOU SUCK!"
























If you are reading this you went too far.
