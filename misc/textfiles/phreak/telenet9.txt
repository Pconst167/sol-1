TeleNet Description, Phone #'s for connection with TeleNet accross the nation,
100+ connect codes listing, and the first listing of commands for TeleNet
ever to be published except in their own guide, explanation of errors, and
instruction on how to hack your own TeleNet codes.                              
Section One:   TeleNet description and explanation.

 TeleNet is a service provided by GTE (the makers of that wonderful
phreaker service: Sprint) for connecting to computers accross the United
States.  It was created so that people in New York could connect with their
business computers in California for the price of a local call.  Interestingly,
GTE seemed to ignore the idea that people would use it for illegal purposes
(remember Sprint again...) so they made it pretty much open to everyone.
I feel that it is my duty to warn you of one or two things:
1)   It's a federal offense to use TeleNet to do what you will be doing.
2)   A number of people in California have had their houses broken into, and
  their computer hardware confiscated by FBI agents for doing this.

And, a standard disclaimer (if it'll help me any...):
   I, Cosmo Hacker, assume no responsibility for whatever uses the following
information is put to.  I further state, that any consequences that may occur
due to the use of the following information are the fault of the user, and not
of me.

    Now on to the good stuff...

Section Two:   How to hack your own.

   Actually it is very easy.  You call your local TeleNet phone number
(given later) and press return three times (once, a semicolon, and again for
half duplex) and it will respond with an '' symbol.  At this prompt you simply
type an area code, and a two to twelve digit connection number.  If the number
you typed is invalid then it will give you an error.  Sometimes it will take
a large amount of time before it responds.  This can be alleviated by using a
Modem Break, or Modem Pause (sometimes call True Break).  This is a specific
tone which is different than a regular tone.  On TRS-80 Model IV the COMM
program has it built in, and also on the Color Computer (TRS-80).  I believe
that certain Apple programs have it also.  The Commodore 64 doesn't have it
unless you program it yourself.  And the Atari's don't have it at all.
IBM's I don't know about.  Anyhow, you send this Modem Break, and TeleNet
responds by reprinting it's opening line and displays the prompt.  You then
type 'D' and press return.  It will then disconnect you from the attempt and
you can try another number.

Example Session:

TELENET
516 8A

TERMINAL=

51698

TELENET

D
ATTEMPT ABORTED

21264

212 64 CONNECTED

Etc.   (21264 is CitiBank)

Section Three:    Explanation of Errors.

    When you begin hacking TeleNet, you will find some WEIRD error messages.
This section explains a lot of them.

REJECTING       -       A password is needed to connect.  Check out the ID
                      command in section four.

XXX NN CONNECTED-       This is no error!  You have just connected to a
                      computer in area code XXX.

REMOTE PROCEDURE ERROR
                -       This error means that there is a computer at that
                      connect number, but it's parity or baud is wrong.

NOT OPERATING   -       There is SUPPOSED to be a computer there, but it's
                      not up right now.  This is sometimes because various
                      computers get brought down over the weekend.

There are others, but these are the main ones.

Section Four:   Commands

    This section deals with the command structure of TeleNet, and what commands
are important, and which are non-useful.

MAIL    -       Nice little command allowing access to the TeleMail system
              which is something like MCI Mail, or Western Union.  Here are
              two accounts that will ALWAYS be there:
              PHONES, password=PHONES   and INTL/ASSOCIATES, password=INTL
              Both accounts give you all the instruction you need.  Press
              '' and a carriage return and 'D' and a carriage return at any
              time to exit.

C       -       This is a command which really doesn't have much use.  It is
              the regular way to connect with a computer.  You type C <SPACE>
              an area code, and a two to twelve digit number.  However, it can
              be done without the C<SPACE>.

ID      -       This command is used to give yourself an ID on TeleNet, certain
              computers don't allow themselves to be accessed with the ID.  The
              ID is the connection number of the computer (21264 for example)
              and then it asks you for password.  Example:
                ID 21264
                PASSWORD? 
                 Invalid ID or Password.

TEST ECHO-      This just allows you to type a line, a <CR> and it'll repeat
                it back to you.

TEST TRIANGLE   This attempts to draw a triangle.  It generally doesn't succeed
                in doing so.

TEST CHARACTER  This is a standard printer test sent to your screen.  It's used
                on printers to check if every character will print.

ENABLE or
DISABLE ECHO    This switches between full and half duplex.
