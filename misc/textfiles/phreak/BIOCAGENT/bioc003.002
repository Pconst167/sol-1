 [PREFACE]:
    In Part III, we will discuss the dialing procedures for domestic as well as
international  dialing.   We  will  also take a look at the telephone numbering
plan.

 NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING PLAN

    In North America, the telephone numbering plan is as follows:

   A)  A 3 digit Numbering Plan Area (NPA) Code (Area Code [A/C])
   B)  A 7 digit telephone number consisting of a 3 digit Central Office (CO)
       code plus a 4 digit station number.

    These 10 digits are called the network address or destination code.  It  is
--More--(7%)in the format of:

                    AREA CODE      TELEPHONE NUMBER
                       nyx            nxx-xxxx

    Where: n= a digit from 2-9, y= 0 or 1, and x= a digit 0-9

 AREA CODES:

    Check your telephone book or the seperate listing of area  codes  found  on
many BBS's.  Here are the Special Area Codes (SAC's):

                        510:   TWX  (USA)
                        610:   TWX  (Canada)
                        700:   New service
                        710:   TWX  (USA)
                        800:   Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS)
                        810:   TWX  (USA)
                        900:   Dial-it services
                        910:   TWX  (USA)

    The other area codes never cross state lines,  therefore  each  state  must
--More--(14%)have  at  least  one  exclusive NPA code.  When a community is split by a state
line, the CO #'s are often interchangable (i.e., you can dial the same # from 2
different area codes).

  TWX:
    TWX (Telex II) consists of 5 teletypewriter area codes.  They are owned  by
Western  Union.   These  SAC's may only be reached via other TWX machines.  Be-
sides the TWX #'s, these machines are routed  to  normal  telephone  #'s.   TWX
machines  always  respond  with  an answerback.  For example, WU's FYI TWX # is
(910) 988-5956, the corresponding real number to this is (201)  279-5956.   The
answerback for this service is "WU FYI MAWA."
    If you don't want to buy a TWX machine, you can still send TWX messages us-
ing  Easylink  [(800)  325-4112:   see  TUC's  and my article entitled "Hacking
Western Union's Easylink"].

  700:
    At the time of this writing, the 700 exchange does  not  yet  exist.   AT&T
plans  to  use it soon, though.  They plan to make it a kind of fancy call for-
warding service.  It will be targetted towards salesmen on the run.
    To understand how it works, I'll explain it with an example.  Let's say Joe
Q.  Salespig  works  for  AT&T  Security  and he is on the run chasing a phreak
around the country that royally screwed up an important COSMOS  system.   Let's
--More--(27%)say that Joe's 700 # is (700) 382-5968.  Every time Joe goes to a new hotel, he
dials a special 700 #, enters a code, and the # where he is  staying.   Now, if
his  boss  decided  that he needed to get in touch with Joe, FAST, all he would
have to do is dial (700) 382-5968, and it would ring whatever number  Joe  last
programmed it to.  Neat, huh?

  800:  Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS)
    This SAC is one of my favorites since it allows for toll-free calls.
  Inward WATS (INWATS):  Inward Wide Area Telecommunications Service is the 800
#'s  that  we  are  all  familiar with.  800 #'s are set up in service areas or
bands.  There are 6 of these.  Band 6 is the largest and you can call a band  6
#  from  anywhere  in  the  US except in the state where the call is terminated
(this is why most companies have 1 800 # for the country and then  another  for
just  one  state).  Band 5 includes the 48 contiguous states.  All the way down
to band 1 which includes only the states contiguous to  that  one.   Therefore,
less people can reach a band 1 INWATS # than a band 6 #.
    Intrastate INWATS #'s (ie, you can call it from only one state) always have
a  2  as the last digit in the exchange (ie, 800-nx2-xxxx).  The nxx on 800 #'s
represents the area where the business is located.  For example, an 800 #  800-
431-xxxx would terminate at a New York CO.
    800 #'s always end up in a hunt series in a CO.  This means that  it  tries
the  first  #  allocated to the company for their 800 lines; if this is busy it
--More--(43%)will then try the next #, etc.  You must have a minimum of 2 lines per each 800
#.   For example, Travelnet uses a hunt series.  If you dial (800) 521-8400, it
will first try the # associated with 8400; if it is busy it will  go  the  next
available  port,  etc.   INWATS customers are billed by the # of hours of calls
that are made to their number.
  Outward WATS (OUTWATS):  OUTWATS are for making outgoing calls  only.   Large
companies  use  OUTWATS  since they receive bulk-rate discounts.  Since OUTWATS
#'s cannot have incoming calls, they are in the format of (800) *xx-xxxx  where
*  is the digit 0 or 1 which cannot be dialed unless you box the call.  The *xx
identifies the type of service and the areas that the company can call.
    Remember: INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS Extender   (see part I)

  900:
    This dial-it SAC is a nationwide dial-it service.  It is  used  for  taking
television  polls  and other stuff.  The first minute currently costs an outra-
geous 50 cents and each additional minute costs 35 cents.  Bell takes in a  lot
of revenue this way.
    Dial (900) 555-1212 to find out what is currently on the service.

 CO CODES:

    These identify the switching office where the call is to be routed.
--More--(55%)             
    The following CO codes are reserved nationwide:
                 555 -  Directory Assistance
                 844 -  Time             ]  These are now both in
                 936 -  Weather          ]  the 976 exchange...

                 970 -  Plant Test (temporary)
                 976 -  Dial-it services

    Also, the 3 digit ANI and ringback #'s are regarded as a Plant Test and are
thus  reserved.   These  numbers  vary from area to area.  [See pt. II for more
info on ANI and Ringback.]

  950:
    [Also see pt. I]  Here are the services that are currently on the  950  ex-
change:
                      1000 -  SPC  (SPRINT)
                      1022 -  MCI Execunet
                      1033 -  US Telephone
                      1044 -  AllNet
--More--(64%)                      1066 -  LexiTel
                      1088 -  SBS Skyline

    These SCC's (Specialised Common Carriers) are free from fortresses!

  Plant Tests:
    These include ANI, Ringback, and other various tests.

  976:
    Dial 976-1000 to see what is currently on the service.   Also,  many  BBS's
have a listing of these #'s.

  N11 CODES:

    Bell is trying to phase some of these out, but they  still  exist  in  many
areas:
             011 -  International Dialing Prefix
             211 -  Coin Refund Operator
             411 -  Directory Assistance
             611 -  Repair Service
             811 -  Business Office
             911 -  Emergency!

INTERNATIONAL DIALING

    With international dialing, the world has been  divided  into  9  numbering
codes.
    To make an international call, you must dial:
            International Prefix + Country Code + National #

    In North America, the international dialing prefix is 011  for  station-to-
station calls and 01 for operator-serviced calls.  IDDD stands for Internation-
al Direct Distance Dialing.
    The country code, which varies from 1 to 3  digis,  always  has  the  world
numbering zone as the first digit.  For example, the country code for the Unit-
ed Kingdom is 44, thus it is in world numbering zone 4.
    Some boards may contain a complete listing of other  country  codes  (check
your local white pages), but here are a few:
         1 -  North America (U.S.A., Canada, etc.)
        20 -  Egypt
       258 -  Mozambique
        34 -  Spain
        49 -  Germany
        52 -  Mexico (Southern portion)
--More--(80%)        61 -  Australia
         7 -  USSR
        81 -  Japan
        98 -  Iran

    If you call from an area other than North America, the format is  generally
the  same.   For  example,  let's  say  you  want  to call the White House from
Switzerland.  First you would dial 00  (Swiss  international  dialing  prefix),
then  1  (United States country code), followed by 202-456-1414 (the national #
for the White House).
    Also, country code 87 is reserved for Maritime Mobile Service,  ie  calling
ships:
                       871 -  Marisat (Atlantic)
                       872 -  Marisat (Pacific)
                       873 -  Marisat (Indian)

  International Switching:
    In North America, there are currently 7 #4 ESS's that perform the  duty  of
ISC  (International  Switching  Centers).   All international calls dialed from
numbering zone 1 will be routed through one of these  "gateway  cities."   They
are:
                      182 -  White Plains, New York
--More--(90%)                      183 -  New York, New York
                      184 -  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
                      185 -  Orlando, Florida
                      186 -  Oakland, California
                      187 -  Denver, Colorado
                      188 -  New York, New York
  The 18X series are operator routing codes for overseas access (to be  further
discussed  with  Blue  Boxes).   All international calls use a signaling system
called CCITT.  It is an international standard for signaling.

  COMING SOON:
    In Part IV, we will discuss  switching  equipment,  various  operators,  CO
types, et cetera.
