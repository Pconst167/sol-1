        how to be a real phreak

in the phone phreak society there are certain values that exist in order to
be a true phreak, these are best  summed up by the magician: "many people
think of phone phreaks as slime, out to rip off bell for all she is worth.
nothing could be further from the truth! granted, there are some who get
their kicks by making free calls; however, they are not true phone phreaks.
real phone phreaks are 'telecommunications hobbyists' who  experiment, play
with and learn from  the phone system. occasionaly this experimenting, and
a need to  communicate with other phreaks ( with- out going broke), leads
to free calls.  the free calls are but a small subset of a >true< phone
phreaks activities.

         the ten commandments

reprinted from tap issue #86. (tap, room 603, 147 w 42 street, new york, ny
10036. send a sase for their info sheet "what the hell is tap?" and tell
them that bioc agent 003 told you about it.)
 
  the phone phreak's ten commandments
 
   i. box thou not over thine home
       telephone wires, for those  who
       doest must surely bring the  
       wrath of the chief special 
       agent down upon thy heads.
 
  ii. speakest thou not of important
       matters over thine home tel-
       ephone wires, for to do so is to
       risk thine right of freedom.
 
 iii. use not thine own name when 
       speaking to other phreaks, for
       that every third phreak is an 
       fbi agent is well known.
 
  iv. let not overly many people know
       that thy be a phreak, as to do 
       so is to use thine own self as
       a sacrificial lamb.
 
   v. if thou be in school, strive to 
       get thin self good grades, for
       the authorities well know that
       scholars never break the law.
 
  vi. if thou workest, try to be a 
       employee, and impressest thine
       boss with thine enthusiasm, for
       important employees are often
       saved by their own bosses.
 
 vii. storest thou not thine stolen 
       goodes in thine own home, for
       those who do are surely non-
       believers in the bell system
       security forces, and are not 
       long for this world.
 
viii. attractest thou not the att-
       ention of the authorities, as 
       the less noticable thou art, the
       better.
 
  ix. makest sure thine friends are 
       instant amnesiacs and will not
       remember that thou have called
       illegally, for their cooperation
       with the authorities will surely
       lessen thine time for freedom on
       this earth.
 
   x. supportest thou tap, as it is 
       thine newsletter, and without 
       it, thy work will be far more 
       limited.
 
             cn/a numbers
 
customer name & address bureaus exist so that authorized bell employees may
obtain the name & address of any customer in the bell system by giving the
cn/a operator the customer's tel. # all customers are maintained on file
including unlisted #'s. these bureaus have many uses for phreaks.
 
here is how an employee might go about calling cn/a: "hi, this is john doe
from the miami residental service center, can i have the customers name at
(123) 555-1212." the employees usually use these for checking who belongs
to a # that someone claimed they didn't call.
 
if you sound cheery and natural the operator will never ask any questions.
if you don't sound like a mature adult, don't use it! always practice first
& so you don't screw up and make the operator suspicious. use  name that
sounds real, not your pirate name either! also say that you are fro a city
that is far away from the one that you are calling.
 
the cn/a number for the ny area & vicinity (212, 315, 516, 518, 607, 716, &
914) is>>>>>>>>>(518) 471-8111<<<<<< and is open during business hours.
don't abuse it!
