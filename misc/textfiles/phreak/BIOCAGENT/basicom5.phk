Revised:  08-AUG-84

PREFACE:

Previous installments of this series here focused on telephony from a Network
point-of-view.  Part V will deal with telephone electronics focusing primarily
on the subscriber's telephone.  Hereinafter simply referred to as "fone."

Wiring:
-------

Assuming a standard one-line fone, there are usually 4 wires that lead out of
the fone set.  These are standardly colored red, green, yellow, & black.  The
red & green wires are the two that are actually hooked up to your CO.  The
yellow wire is sometimes used to ring different fones on a party line (ie, one
#, several families--found primarily in rural areas where they pay less for the
service and they don't use the fone as much); otherwise, the yellow is usually
just ignored. On some two-line fones, the red & green wires are used for the
first fone # and the yellow & black are used for the second line.  In this case
there must be an internal or external device that switches between the two
lines and provides a hold function. (Such as Radio Shack's outrageously priced
2 line & hold module).

In telephony, the green & red wires are often referred to as tip (T) & ring
(R), respectively.  The tip is the more positive of the two wires.  This naming
goes back to the old operator cord boards where one of the wires was the tip of
the plug and the other was the ring (of the barrel).

A rotary fone (aka dial or pulse) will work fine regardless of whether the red
(or green) wire is connected the tip(+) or ring(-).  A touch-tone (TM) fone is
a different story, though.  It will not work except if the tip(+) is the green
wire. [Although, some of the more expensive DTMF fones do have a bridge
rectifier which compensates for polarity reversal.]  This is why under certain
(non-digital) switching equipment you can reverse the red & green wires on a
touch-tone fone and receive free DTMF service.  Even though it won't break dial
tone, reversing the wires on a rotary line on a digital switch will cause the
tones to be generarted.

Voltages, Etc.
--------------

When your telephone is on-hook (ie, hung up) there is approximately 48 volts of
DC potential across the tip & ring.  When the handset of a fone is lifted a few
switches close which cause a loop to be connected (known as the "local loop")
between your fone & the CO.  Once this happens DC current is able to flow
through the fone with less resistance. This causes a relay to energize which
causes other CO equipment to realize that you want service.  Eventually, you
should end up with a dial tone.  This also causes the 48 VDC to drop down into
the vicinity of 12 volts.  The resistance of the loop also drops below the 2500
ohm level, though FCC licensed telephone equipment must have an off-hook
impedance of 600 ohms. As of now, you ahands of our "friends" at  D&B. To  say
the  least, they  weren't exactly thrilled about  it. In  fact,  they did  not
even believe   that  they   had  a   security  problem! (Well, that just  goes
to  prove that  if you  are good, no one knows that you are there!)

 In  a big  effort to  defeat us,  they called in  an  outside   service  to
spruce  up   their "security."  Well,  fortunately  for  us,  we were able to
find out  about  the new  system!  (Which wasn't  really a problem. First,
they had the new dial-ups when you  logged on, and  as always  they have  a
nice little place on Telenet! (Where we do most of our work: C 20188).

     Now, they  have  set  up a  new  system  they like  to  call DunsNet.
They  are trying  to pass it off as a ectionately call this mute a black box.

the following are instructions on how to build a simple black box.  Of course,
anything that prevents the voltage from dropping would work.

You only need two parts:  A SPST toggle switch and a 10,000 ohm (10 K), 1/2
watt resistor.  Any electronics store should stock these parts.

Now, cut 2 pieces of wire (about 6 inches long) and attach one end of each wire
to one of the terminals on the switch.  Now turn your K500 (standard desk fone)
upside down and take off the cover. Locate wire (disconnect it from its
terminal).  Now bring the switch out the rear of the fone and replace the
cover.

Put the switch in a position where you receive a dial tone.  Mark this position
NORMAL.  Mark the other side FREE.

When your phriends call (at a prearranged time), quickly lift & drop the
receiver as fast a possible.  This will stop the ringing (do it again if it
doesn't) with out starting the billing.  It is important that you do
it quickly (less than 1 second). Then put the switch in the FREE position and
pick up the fone.  Keep all calls short and preferrably under 15 minutes.

NOTE:  If someone picks up an extension in the called parties house and
       that fone is not set for FREE then billing will start.

NOTE:  An old way of signalling a phriend that you are about to call is making
       a collect call to a non-existant person in the house.  Since your friend
       will not accept the charges, he will know that you are about to call
       and thus prepare the black box (or visa versa).

WARNING:  The Telco can detect black boxes if they suspect one on your line.
          This is done due to the presence of AC voice signal at the wrong DC
          level!

NOTE:  The Black Box will not work under ESS or other similar digital switches
       since ESS does not connect the voice circuits until the fone is picked
       up (& billing starts).  Instead, ESS uses an "artificial" computer
       generated ring.

Ringing:
--------

To inform a subscriber of an incoming call, the Telco sends 90 volts (PK) of
pulsing DC down the line (at around 15 to 60 Hz; usually 20 Hz).  In most fones
this causes a metal armature to be attracted alternately between two
electro-magnets thus striking 2 bells. of course, the standard bell (patented
in 1878 by Tom A. Watson) can be replaced by a more modern electronic bell or
signaling device.

Also, you can have lights and other similar devices in lieu of (or in
conjunction with) the bell.  A simple neon light (with its corresponding
resistor) can simply be connected between the red & green wires (usually L1 &
L2 on the network box) so that it lights up on incoming calls.

WARNING:  90 VDC can give quite a shock. Exercise extreme caution if you wish
          to further persue these topics.

Also included in the ringing circuit is a capacitor tbig  savings of time since
the  hassle of  using a a time  shared public network does not exist. We're
sure that Mr. J.W.P. of DUNSPRINT had more  on his mind when he wrote the
letter (on the system)! DunsNet  is  accessible  from  a  regular dial-up.  We
have  not been  able to  get a number yet for  this system,  but  once on  it
allegedly works  just like Telenet! Two carriage returns and you will see
"DunsNet"  then  the  familiar  "@" symbol. To use the system like we showed
you, type "RPTS" at  thiup to drop a trouble card for long periods of ringing
then a "no-no" detection device may be placed on the line.

Incidentally, the term "ring trip" refers to the CO process involved to stop
the AC ringing signal when the calling fone goes off hook.

NOTE:  It is suggested that you actually dissect fones to help you better
       understand them. It will also help you to better understand the concepts
       here if you actually prove them to yourself.  For example, actually
       take the voltage readings on your fone line [any simple
       multi-tester (a must) will do.] Phreaking is an interactive
       process not a passive one!

Dialing:
--------

On a standard fone, there are two common types of dialing:  pulse & DTMF.  Of
course, some people insist upon being different and don't use the DT thus
leaving them with MF (Multi Frequncy, aka operator, blue box) tones.  This is
another "no-no" and the Telco Security gentelmen have a special knack for
dealing with such "phreaks" on the network.

When you dial rotary, you are actually rapidly breaking & reconnecting
(breaking & making) the local loop once for each digit dialed. Since the
physical connection must be broken, you cannot dial if another extension (of
that #) is off-hook.  Neither of the fones will be able to dial pulse unless
the other hangs up.

Another term often referred to in telephone electronics is the break ratio.  In
the US, the standard is 10 pulses per second.  When the circuit is opened it is
called the break interval. When it is closed it is called the make interval.
In the US, there is a 60 millisecond (ms) make period and a 40 ms break period.
(60+40=100 ms = 1/10 second).  This is referred to as a 60% make interval.
Some of the more sophisticated electronic fones can switch between a 60% & a
67% make interval.  This is due to the fact that many foreign nations use a 67%
break interval.

Have you ever been in an office or a similar facility and saw a fone waiting
to be used for a free call but some asshole put a lock on it to prevent
outgoing calls?

Well, don't fret phellow phreaks, you can simulate pulse dialing by rapidly
depressing the switchook.  (If you depress it for longer than a second it will
be construed as a disconnect.)  By rapidly switchooking you are causing the
local loop to be broken & made similar to rotary dialing!  Thus if you can
manage to switchook rapidly 10 times you can reach an operator to place any
call you want!  This takes alot of practice, though.  You might want to
practice on your own fone dialing a friend's # or something else. Incidentally,
this method will also work with DTMF fones since all DTMF lines can also handle
rotary.

Another problem with pulse dialing is that it produces high-voltage spikes that
make loud clicks in the earpiece and cause the bell to "tinkle."  If you never
noticed this then your fone has a special "anti-tinkle" & earpiece shorting
circuit (most do).  If you have ever dissected a rotary fone (a must for any
serious phreak) you would have noticed that there are 2 sets of contact that
open and close during pulsing (on the back of the rotary dial under the plastic
cover).  One of these actually opens and closes the loop while the other mutes
the earpiece by shorting it out.  The second contacts also activates a special
anti-tinkle circuit that puts a 340 ohm resistor across the ringing circuit
which prevents the high voltage spikes from interferring with the bell.

Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) is a modern day improvement on pulse dialing
in several ways.  First of all, it is more convenient for the user since it
is faster and can be used for signaling after the call is completed (ie, SCC's,
computers, etc.).  Also, it is more up to par with modern day switching
equipment (such as ESS) since pulse dialing was designed to actually move
relays by the number of digits dialed (in SxS offices).

Each key on a DTMF keypad produces 2 frequencies simultaneously (one from the
high group and another from the low group).

             (High Group--in Hz)

A portable DTMF keypad is known as a white box.

The fourth column (1633 Hz) is not normally found on regular fones but it
does have several special uses.  For one, it is used to designate the priority
of calls on AUTOVON, the military fone network.  These key are called:  Flash,
Immediate, Priority, & Routine (with variations) instead of ABCD.  Secondly,
these keys are used for testing purposes by the Telco.  In some area you can
find loops as well as other neat tests (see Part II) on the 555-1212 directory
assistance exchange. For this, you would call up an DA in certain areas [that
have an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD)] and hold down the "D" key which
should blow the operator off.  You will then hear a pulsing dial tone which
indicates that you are in the ACD internal testing mode.  You can get on one
side of a loop by dialing a 6.  The other side is 7.  Some phreaks claim that
if the person on side 6 hangs up, occasionally the equipment will screw up and
start directing directory assistance calls to the other side of the loop.
Another alleged test is called REMOB which allows you to tap into lines by
entering a special code followed by the 7 digit number you want to monitor.
Then there is the possibility of mass conferencing.

ACD's are become rare though.  You will probably have to make several NPA-555-
1212 calls before you find one.

You can modify regular fones quite readily so that they have a switch to change
between the 3rd and 4th columns. This is called a silver box (aka grey box) and
plans can be found in Tap as well as on many BBS's.

Transmitter/Receiver:
---------------------

When you talk into the transmitter, the sound waves from your voice cause a
diaphragm to vibrate and press against the carbon granules (or another similar
substance).  This causes the carbon granules to compress and contract thus
changing the resistance of the DC coupled path through it.  Therefore, your AC
voice signal is superimposed over the DC current of the local loop. The
receiver works in a similar fashion where the simple types utilize a
magnet, armature, & diaphragm.

Hybrid/Induction Coil:
----------------------

As you may have noticed, there are two wires for the receiver and two for the
transmitter in the fone, yet the local loop consists of 2 wires instead of 4.
This 4-wire to 2-wire conversion is done inside the fone by a device known as
an induction coil which uses coupling transformers.  All of the internal Telco
trunks also use 4 wires. It is only the local loop that uses 2 since it is
cheaper.  A device in the CO known as a hybrid converts between 4 and 2 wire
set-ups similar to the induction coil inside the fone. Special data
transmission lines require extremely low signal to noise ratios, they require
the full four wires--two for transmission and two for receiving (even on the
local loop).

Miscellaneous:
--------------

In the telephone, there is also a balancing network consisting of a few
capacitors & resistors which provide sidetone.  Sidetone allows the caller to
hear his own volume in the receiver. He can then adjust his voice accordingly.
This prevents people from shouting or speaking too softly without noticing it.

Hold:

When a telephone goes off hook, the resistance drops below 2500 ohms.  At this
point, the Telco will send a dial tone.  To put someone on hold you must put a
1000 ohm resistor (1 watt) across the Tip & Ring before it reaches the
switchook.  In this way, when the fone is hung up (for hold) the resistance
remains below 2500 ohms which causes the CO to believe that you are still
off-hook.  You can build a simple hold device using the following pictoral
diagram:

                      --> To Rest of
                             Fone

This hold device is only effective if you also hang up the fone.  To make a
hold/mute switch, simple connect a wire in place of the 1K resistor to effect a
short circuit (who cares if you damage CO equipment?).

Conclusion:
-----------

NOTE:  Many of the electronics components of normal fones (K500) are enclosed
       in the network box (which shouldn't be opened).

I have assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of electronics.  Also,
I have assumed that you have read the 4 previous installments of this series
(and hopefully enjoyed them).

In part VI, we will take a look at fortress fones.
