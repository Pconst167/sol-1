PREFACE:

IN PART III, WE WILL DISCUSS THE DIALING PROCEDURES FOR DOMESTIC AS WELL AS
INTERNATIONAL DIALING.  WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE TELEPHONE NUMBERING
PLAN.

===============================
=NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING PLAN=
===============================

IN NORTH AMERICA, THE TELEPHONE NUMBERING PLAN IS AS FOLLOWS:

     A) A 3 DIGIT NUMBERING PLAN AREA (NPA) CODE, [IE, AREA CODE]
     B) A 7 DIGIT TELEPHONE # CONSISTING OF A 3 DIGIT CENTRAL OFFICE
        (CO) CODE PLUS A 4 DIGIT STATION #.

THESE 10 DIGITS ARE CALLED THE NETWORK ADDRESS OR DESTINATION CODE.  IT IS IN
THE FORMAT OF:

        AREA CODE   TELEPHONE #
        ---------   -----------

           N*X        NXX-XXX
   WHERE:  N = A DIGIT FROM 2-9
           * = THE DIGIT 0 OR 1
           X = A DIGIT 0-9

AREA CODES:
-----------

CHECK YOUR TELEPHONE BOOK OR THE SEPARATE LISTING OF AREA CODES FOUND ON MANY
BBS'S.  HERE ARE THE SPECIAL AREA CODES (SAC'S):

     510 - TWX (USA)
     610 - TWX (CANADA)
     700 - NEW SERVICE
     710 - TWX (USA)
     800 - WATS
     810 - TWX (USA)
     900 - DIAL-IT SERVICES
     910 - TWX (USA)

THE OTHER AREA CODES NEVER CROSS STATE LINES, THEREFORE EACH STATE MUST HAVE
ATLEAST ONE EXCLUSIVE NPA CODE.  WHEN A COMMUNITY IS SPLIT BY A STATE LINE,
THE CO #'S ARE OFTEN INTERCHANGABLE (IE, YOU CAN DIAL THE SAME # FROM 2
DIFFERENT AREA CODES)


TWX:

TWX (TELEX II) CONSISTS OF 5 TELETYPE-WRITER AREA CODES.  THEY ARE OWNED BY
WESTERN UNION.  THESE SAC'S MAY ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER TWX MACHINES. 
THESE RUN AT 110 BAUD.  BESIDES THE TWX #'S, THESE MACHINES ARE ROUTED TO
NORMAL TELEPHONE #'S.  TWX MACHINES ALWAYS RESPOND WITH AN ANSWERBACK. FOR
EXAMPLE, WU'S FYI TWX # IS (910) 988-5956, THE CORRESPONDING REAL NUMBER TO
THIS IS (201) 279-5956.  THE ANSWERBACK FOR THIS SERVICE IS "WU FYI MAWA."

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY A TWX MACHINE, YOU CAN STILL SEND TWX MESSAGES USING
EASYLINK [800/325-4112 - SEE TUC'S AND MY ARTICLE ENTITLED "HACKING WESTERN
UNION'S EASYLINK]

700:

AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, THE 700 EXCHANGE DOES NOT YET EXIST.  AT&T PLANS
TO USE IT SOON THOUGH.  THEY PLAN TO MAKE IT A TYPE OF FANCY CALL FORWARDING
SERVICE.  IT WILL BE TARGETED TOWARDS SALESMEN ON THE RUN.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, I'LL EXPLAIN IT WITH AN EXAMPLE.  LET'S SAY JOE Q
. SALESPIG WORKS FOR AT&T SECURITY AND HE IS ON THE RUN CHASING A PHREAK
AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ROYALLY SCREWED UP AN IMPORTANT COSMOS SYSTEM.  LET'S
SAY THAT JOE'S 700 # IS (700) 382-5968.  EVERYTIME JOE GOES TO A NEW HOTEL,
HE DIALS A SPECIAL 700 #, ENTERS A CODE, AND THE # WHERE HE IS STAYING.  NOW,
IF HIS BOSS RECEIVED SOME IMPORTANT INFO, ALL HE WOULD DO IS DIAL (700) 382
-5968 AND IT WOULD RING WHEREVER JOE LAST PROGRAMMED IT TO.  NEAT, HUH?

800:

THIS SAC IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SINCE IT ALLOWS FOR TOLL-FREE CALLS.

INWARD WATS (INWATS):  INWARD WIDE AREA TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE 800
#'S THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.  800 #'S ARE SET UP IN SERVICE AREAS OR
BANDS.  THERE ARE 6 OF THESE.  BAND 6 IS THE LARGEST AND YOU CAN CALL A BAND
6 # FROM ANYWHERE IN THE US EXCEPT THE STATE WHERE THE CALL IS TERMINATED 
(THIS IS WHY MOST COMPANIES HAVE ONE 800 # FOR THE COUNTRY AND THEN ANOTHER
FOR JUST ONE STATE).  BAND 5 INCLUDES THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES.  ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO BAND 1 WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THE STATES CONTIGUOUS TO THAT ONE. 
THEREFORE, LESS PEOPLE CAN REACH A BAND 1 INWATS # THAT A BAND 6 #.

INTRASTATE INWATS #'S (IE, YOU CAN CALL IT FROM ONLY 1 STATE) ALWAYS HAVE A 2
AS THE LAST DIGIT IN THE EXCHANGE (IE, 800-NX2-XXXX).  THE NXX ON 800 #'S
REPRESENT THE AREA WHERE THE BUSINESS IS LOCATED.  FOR EXAMPLE, A # BEGINNING
WITH 800-431 WOULD TERMINATE AT A NY CO

800 #'S ALWAYS END UP IN A HUNT SERIES IN A CO.  THIS MEANS THAT IT TRIES THE
FIRST # ALLOCATED TO THE COMPANY FOR THEIR 8P0 LINES; IF THIS IS BUSY IT WILL
THEN TRY THE NEXT #, ETC).  YOU MUST HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWO LINES PER EACH 800
#.  FOR EXAMPLE. TRAVELNET USES A HUNT SERIES.  IF YOU DIAL (800) 521-8400,
IT WILL FIRST TRY THE # ASSOCIATED WITH 8400; IF IT IS BUSY IT WILL GO TO THE
NEXT AVAILABLE PORT, ETC.  INWATS CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED BY THE # OF HOURS OF
CALLS THAT ARE MADE TO THEIR #.

OUTWATS (OUTWARD WATS):  OUTWATS ARE FOR MAKING OUTGOING CALLS ONLY.  LARGE
COMPANIES USE OUTWATS SINCE THEY RECEIVE BULK-RATE DISCOUNTS.  SINCE OUTWATS 
# CANNOT HAVE INCOMING CALLS, THEY ARE IN THE FORMAT OF:
     (800) *XX-XXXX

WHERE * IS THE DIGIT 0 OR 1 WHICH CANNOT BE DIALED UNLESS YOU BOX THE CALL. 
THE *XX IDENTIFIES THE TYPE OF SERVICE AND THE AREAS THAT THE COMPANY CAN
CALL.

REMEMBER: INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS EXTENDER (SEE PART I)

=======================
=INTERNATIONAL DIALING=
=======================

WITH INTERNATIONAL DIALING, THE WORLD HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO 9 NUMBERING ZONES.

TO MAKE AN INTERNATION CALL, YOU MUST DIAL:
     INT. PREFIX + COUNTRY CODE + NAT. #

IN NORTH AMERICA, THE INTERNATIONAL DIALING PREFIX IS 011 FOR STATION-TO
-STATION CALLS AND 01 FOR OPERATOR-SERVICED CALLS.  IDDD STANDS FOR
INTERNATIONAL DIRECT DISTANCE DIALING.

THE COUNTRY CODE, WHICH VARIES FROM 1 TO 3 DIGITS, ALWAYS HAS THE WORLD
NUMBERING ZONE AS THE FIRST DIGIT.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE COUNTRY CODE FOR THE
UNITED KINGDOM IS 44, THUS IT IS IN WORLD NUMBERING ZONE 4.  SOME BOARDS MAY
CONTAIN A COMPLETE LISTING OF OTHER COUNTRY CODES, BUT HERE ARE A FEW:

     1 - NORTH AMERICA (US, CANADA,ETC)
    20 - EGYPT
   258 - MOZAMBIQUE
    34 - SPAIN
    49 - GERMANY
    52 - MEXICO (SOUTHERN PORTION)
    61 - AUSTRALIA
     7 - USSR
    81 - JAPAN
    98 - IRAN

IF YOU CALL FROM AN AREA OTHER THAN NORTH AMERICA, THE FORMAT IS GENERALLY
THE SAME.  FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO CALL THE WHITE HOUSE FROM
SWITZERLAND.  FIRST YOU WOULD DIAL 00 (THE SWISS INTERNATIONAL DIALING PREFIX
), THEN 1 (THE US COUNTRY CODE), FOLLOWED BY 202-456-1414 (THE NATIONAL # FOR
THE WHITE HOUSE).

ALSO, COUNTRY CODE 87 IS RESERVED FOR MARITIME MOBILE SERVICE, IE CALLING
SHIPS:

     871 - MARISAT (ATLANTIC)
     872 - MARISAT (PACIFIC)
     873 - MARISAT (INDIAN)

INTERNATIONAL SWITCHING:

IN NORTH AMERICA, THERE ARE CURRENTLY 7 NO. 4 ESS'S THAT PERFORM THE DUTY OF
ISC (INTERNATION SWITCHING CENTERS).  ALL INTERNATIONAL CALLSDIALED FROM
NUMBERING ZONE 1 WILL BE ROUTED THROUGH ONE OF THESE "GATEWAY CITIES."  THEY
ARE:

     182 -  WHITE PLAINS, NY
     183 -  NEW YORK, NY
     184 -  PITTSBURGH, PA
     185 -  ORLANDO, FL
     186 -  OAKLAND, CA
     187 -  DENVER, CO
     188 -  NEW YORK, NY

THE 18X SERIES ARE OPERATOR ROUTING CODES FOR OVERSEAS ACCESS (TO BE FURTHER
DISCUSSED WITH BLUE BOXES).  ALL INTERNATIONAL CALLS USE A SIGNALING SYSTEM
CALLED CCITT.  IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR SIGNALING.



COMING SOON:

IN PART IV, WE WILL DISCUSS SWITCHING EQUIPMENT, VARIOUS OPERATORS, CO TYPES,
ETC.
