PREFACE:

     AFTER MOST NEOPHYTE PHREAKS OVERCOME THEIR FASCINATION WITH METRO CODES
AND WATS EXTENDERS, THEY WILL USUALLY SEEK TO EXPLORE OTHER AVENUES IN THE
VAST PHONE NETWORK.  OFTEN THEY WILL COME ACROSS REFERENCES SUCH AS "SIMPLY
DIAL KP + 2130801050 + ST FOR THE ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING SYSTEM IN LA."
NUMBERS SUCH AS THE ONE ABOVE WERE INTENDED TO BE USED WITH A BLUE BOX; THIS
ARTICLE WILL EXPLAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE FINE ART
OF BLUE BOXING.

GENESIS:
--------

     IN THE BEGINNING, ALL LONG DISTANCE CALLS WERE CONNECTED MANUALLY BY
OPERATORS WHO PASSED ON THE CALLED NUMBER VERBALLY TO OTHER OPERATORS IN
SERIES.  THIS IS BECAUSE PULSE (AKA ROTARY) DIGITS ARE CREATED BY CAUSING
BREAKS IN THE DC CURRENT (SEE BASIC TELCOM V).  SINCE LONG DISTANCE CALLS
REQUIRE ROUTING THROUGH VARIOUS SWITCHING EQUIPMENT AND AC VOICE AMPLIFIERS,
PULSE DIALING CANNOT BE USED TO SEND THE DESTINATION NUMBER TO THE END LOCAL
OFFICE (CO).

     EVENTUALLY, THE DEMAND FOR FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT LONG DISTANCE (LD)
SERVICE CAUSED BELL TO MAKE A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR DECISION.  THEY  HAD TO
CREATE A SIGNALING SYSTEM THAT COULD BE USED ON THE LD NETWORK.  BASICALLY,
THEY HAD TWO OPTIONS:

[1] TO SEND ALL THE SIGNALING AND SUPERVISORY INFORMATION (IE, ON & OFF HOOK)
OVER SEPARATE DATA LINKS.  THIS TYPE OF SIGNALING IS REFERRED TO AS OUT-OF
-BAND SIGNALING.
                 -OR-
[2] TO SEND ALL THE SIGNALING INFORMATION ALONG WITH THE CONVERSATION USING
TONES TO REPRESENT DIGITS.  THIS TYPE OF SIGNALING IS REFERRED TO AS IN-BAND
SIGNALING.

     BEING THE CHEAP BASTARD THAT THEY NATURALLY ARE, BELL CHOSE THE LATTER 
(AND CHEAPER) METHOD -- IN-BAND SIGNALING.  THEY EVENTUALLY REGRETTED THIS,
THOUGH (HEH, HEH)...

IN-BAND SIGNALING PRINCIPLES:
-----------------------------

     WHEN A SUBSCRIBER DIALS A TELEPHONE NUMBER, WHETHER IN ROTARY OR TOUCH
-TONE (AKA DTMF), THE EQUIPMENT IN THE CO INTERPRETS THE DIGITS AND LOOKS FOR
A CONVENIENT TRUNK LINE TO SEND THE CALL ON ITS WAY.  IN THE CASE OF A LOCAL
CALL, IT WILL PROBABLY BE SENT VIA AN INTER-OFFICE TRUNK; OTHERWISE, IT WILL
BE SENT TO A TOLL OFFICE (CLASS 4 OR HIGHER -- SEE TELCOM IV) TO BE PROCESSED.

     WHEN TRUNKS ARE NOT BEING USED THERE IS A 2600 HZ TONE ON THE LINE; THUS
, TO FIND A FREE TRUNK, THE CO EQUIPMENT SIMPLY CHECKS FOR THE PRESENCE OF
2600 HZ. IF IT DOESN'T FIND A FREE TRUNK THE CUSTOMER WILL RECEIVE A RE-ORDER
SIGNAL (120 IPM BUSY SIGNAL) OR THE "ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY..." MESSAGE.   IF
IT DOES FIND A FREE TRUNK IT "SEIZES" IT -- REMOVING THE 2600 HZ.  IT THEN
SENDS THE CALLED NUMBER OR A SPECIAL ROUTING CODE TO THE OTHER END OR TOLL
OFFICE.

     THE TONES IT USES TO SEND THIS INFORMATION ARE CALLED MULTI-FREQUENCY 
(MF) TONES.  AN MF TONE CONSISTS OF TWO TONES FROM A SET OF SIX MASTER TONES
WHICH ARE COMBINED TO PRODUCE 12 SEPARATE TONES.  YOU CAN SOMETIMES HEAR
THESE TONES IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN YOU MAKE A CALL BUT THEY ARE USUALLY
FILTERED OUT SO YOUR DELICATE EARS CANNOT HEAR THEM. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME
AS TOUCH-TONES.

     TO NOTIFY THE EQUIPMENT AT THE FAR END OF THE TRUNK THAT IT IS ABOUT TO
RECEIVE ROUTING INFORMATION, THE ORIGINATING END FIRST SENDS A KEY PULSE (KP)
TONE.  AT THE END OF SENDING THE DIGITS, THE ORIGINATING END THEN SENDS A
START (ST) TONE. THUS TO CALL 914-359-1517, THE EQUIPMENT WOULD SEND KP +
9143591517 + ST IN MF TONES.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER HANGS UP, 2600 HZ IS ONCE
AGAIN SENT TO SIGNIFY A DISCONNECT TO THE DISTANT END.

HISTORY:
--------

     IN THE NOVEMBER 1960 ISSUE OF THE BELL SYSTEM TECHNICAL JOURNAL, AN
ARTICLE ENTITLED "SIGNALING SYSTEMS FOR CONTROL OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING" WAS
PUBLISHED.  THIS JOURNAL, WHICH WAS SENT TO MOST UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES,
HAPPENED TO CONTAIN THE ACTUAL MF TONES USED IN SIGNALING.  THEY APPEARED AS
FOLLOWS:

   DIGIT                TONES
   -----                -----
     1              700 +  900 HZ
     2              700 + 1100 HZ
     3              900 + 1100 HZ
     4              700 + 1300 HZ
     5              900 + 1300 HZ
     6             1100 + 1300 HZ
     7              700 + 1500 HZ
     8              900 + 1500 HZ
     9             1100 + 1500 HZ
     0             1300 + 1500 HZ
     KP            1100 + 1700 HZ
     ST            1500 + 1700 HZ
     11  (*)        700 + 1700 HZ
     12  (*)        900 + 1700 HZ
     KP2 (*)       1300 + 1700 HZ

(*)  USED ONLY ON CCITT SYSTEM 5 FOR SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL CALLING.

BELL CAUGHT WIND OF BLUE BOXING IN 1961 WHEN IT CAUGHT A WASHINGTON STATE
COLLEGE STUDENT USING ONE.  THEY ORIGINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT BLUE BOXES
THROUGH POLICE RAIDS AND INFORMANTS.  IN 1964, BELL LABS CAME UP WITH
SCANNING EQUIPMENT, WHICH RECORDED ALL SUSPICIOUS CALLS, TO DETECT BLUE BOX
USAGE.  THESE UNITS WERE INSTALLED IN CO'S WHERE MAJOR TOLL FRAUD EXISTED. 
AT&T SECURITY WOULD THEN LISTEN TO THE APES TO SEE IF ANY TOLL FRAUD WAS
ACTUALLY COMMITTED.  OVER 200 CONVICTIONS RESULTED FROM THE PROJECT. 
SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, BLUE BOXING IS NOT SOLELY LIMITED TO THE ELECTRONICS
ENTHUSIAST; AT&T HAS CAUGHT BUSINESSMEN, FILM STARS, DOCTORS, LAWYERS,
COLLEGE STUDENTS, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND EVEN A MILLIONAIRE FINANCIER 
(BERNARD CORNFELD) USING THE DEVICE.  AT&T ALSO SAID THAT NEARLY HALF OF
THOSE THAT THEY CATCH ARE BUSINESSMEN.

OF COURSE, PHONE PHREAKS HAVE ACHIEVED AN ALMOST CULT STATUS.  THEY HAVE ALSO
HAD THEIR FAIR SHARE OF MEDIA.  IN OCTOBER 1971, ESQUIRE PUBLISHED THE
INFAMOUS "SECRETS OF THE LITTLE BLUE BOX" ARTICLE WHICH FEATURED PHREAKS SUCH
AS CAPTAIN CRUNCH, WHO TOOK HIS NAME FROM THE CEREAL WHICH ONE GAVE AWAY
WHISTLES THAT PRODUCED A PERFECT 2600 HZ PITCH; JOE ENGRESSIA, THE BLIND
PHREAK; AND MARK BERNAY, ONE OF THE NATION'S FIRST AND OLDEST PHREAKS. 
OTHERS SUCH AS APPLE COMPUTER CO-FOUNDERS STEVE WOZNIAK & STEVE JOBHAVE ALSO
HAD BLUE BOP BACKGROUNDS.  1971 ALSO SAW THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST ISSUE
OF YIPL, THE PHONE PHREAK NEWSLETTER, (NOW TAP) UNDER THE EDITORSHIP OF
SUPREME YIPPIE ABBIE HOFFMAN.

USAGE:
------

     TO USE A BLUE BOX, ONE WOULD USUALLY MAKE A FREE CALL TO ANY 800 NUMBER
OR DISTANT DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (NPA-555-1212).  THIS, OF COURSE, IS
LEGITIMATE.  WHEN THE CALL IS ANSWERED, ONE WOULD THEN SWIFTLY PRESS THE
BUTTON THAT WOULD SEND 2600 HZ DOWN THE LINE.  THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF MAKING
THE DISTANT CO EQUIPMENT THINK THAT THE CALL WAS TERMINATED AND IT LEAVES THE
TRUNK HANGING.  NOW, THE USER HAS ABOUT 10 SECONDS TO ENTER IN THE TELEPHONE
NUMBER HE WISHED TO DIAL -- IN MF, THAT IS.  THE CO EQUIPMENT MERELY ASSUMES
THAT THIS CAME FROM ANOTHER OFFICE AND IT WILL HAPPILY PROCESS THE CALL. 
SINCE THERE ARE NO RECORDS (EXCEPT ON TOLL FRAUD DETECTION DEVICES!) OF THESE
MF TONES, THE USER IS NOT BILLED FOR THE CALL.  WHEN THE USER HANGS UP, THE
CO EQUIPMENT SIMPLY RECORDS THAT HE HUNG UP ON A FREE CALL.

DETECTION:
----------

     BELL HAS HAD 20 YEARS TO WORK ON DETECTION DEVICES; THEREFORE, IN THIS
DAY AND AGE, THEY ARE RATHER WELL REFINED.  BASICALLY, THE DETECTION DEVICE
WILL LOOK FOR THE PRESENCE OF 2600 HZ WHERE IT DOES NOT BELONG.  IT THEN
RECORDS THE CALLING NUMBER AND ALL ACTIVITY AFTER THE 2600 HZ.  IF YOU HAPPEN
TO BE AT A FORTRESS FONE, THOUGH, AND YOU MAKE THE CALL SHORT, YOUR CHANCES
OF GETTING CAUGHT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (SEE TELCOM VI).  INCIDENTALLY,
THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS OF CERTAIN TEST NUMBERS (SEE TELCOM II) THAT HOOK
DIRECTLY INTO TRUNKS THUS AVOIDING THE NEED FOR 2600 HZ AND DETECTION!

     ANOTHER WAY THAT BELL CATCHES BOXERS IS TO EXAMINE THE CAMA (CENTRALIZED
AUTOMATIC MESSAGE ACCOUNTING) TAPES.  WHEN YOU MAKE A CALL, YOUR NUMBER, THE
CALLED NUMBER, AND TIME OF DAY ARE ALL RECORDED.  THE SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN
YOU HANG UP.  THIS TAPE IS THEN PROCESSED FOR BILLING PURPOSES.  NORMALLY,
ALL FREE CALLS ARE IGNORED.  BUT BELL CAN PROGRAM THE BILLING EQUIPMENT TO
MAKE NOTE OF LENGTHY CALLS TO DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE.  THEY CAN THEN PUT A PEN
REGISTER (AKA DNR) ON THE LINE OR AN ACTUAL FULL-BLOWN TAP.  THIS DETECTION
CAN BE AVOIDED BY MAKING SHORT-HAUL (AKA LOCAL) CALLS TO BOX OFF OF.

     IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NPA+555-1212 ORIGINALLY DID NOT RETURN
ANSWER SUPERVISION.  THUS THE CALLS WERE NOT RECORDED ON THE AMA/CAMA TAPES. 
AT&T CHANGED THIS THOUGH FOR "TRAFFIC STUDIES!"

CCIS:
-----

     BESIDES DETECTION DEVICES, BELL HAS BEGUN TO GRADUALLY REDESIGN THE
NETWORK USING OUT-OF-BAND SIGNALING.  THIS IS KNOWN AS COMMON CHANNEL INTER
-OFFICE SIGNALING (CCIS).  SINCE THIS SIGNALING METHOD SENDS ALL THE
SIGNALING INFORMATION OVER SEPARATE DATA LINES, BLUE BOXING IS IMPOSSIBLE
UNDER IT.

     WHILE BEING IMPLEMENTED GRADUALLY, THIS MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT IS
STILL STRANGLING THE FINE ART OF BLUE BOXING.  OF COURSE UNTIL THE PROJECT IS
TOTALLY COMPLETE, BOXING WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE.  IT WILL BECOME
PROGRESSIVELY HARDER TO FIND PLACES TO BOX OFF OF, THOUGH.  IN AREAS WITH
CCIS, ONE MUST FIND A DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OFFICE THAT DOESN'T HAVE CCIS YET.
 AREA CODES IN CANADA AND PREDOMINATELY RURAL STATES ARE THE BEST BETS.  WATS
NUMBERS TERMINATING IN NON-CCIS CITIES ARE ALSO GOOD PROSPECTS.

PINK NOISE:
-----------

     ANOTHER WAY THAT MAY HELP TO AVOID DETECTION IS TOO ADD SOME "PINK NOISE
" TO THE 2600 HZ TONE.

     SINCE 2600 HZ TONES CAN BE SIMULATED IN SPEECH, THE DETECTION EQUIPMENT
MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO MISINTERPRET SPEECH AS A DISCONNECT SIGNAL.  THUS A
VIRTUALLY PURE 2600 HZ TONE IS REQUIRED FOR DISCONNECT.

KEEPING THIS IN MIND, THE 2600 HZ DETECTION EQUIPMENT IS ALSO PROBABLY
LOOKING FOR PURE 2600 HZ OR ELSE IS WOULD BE TRIGGERED EVERY TIME SOMEONE HIT
THAT NOTE (HIGHEST E ON A PIANO = 2637 HZ).  THIS IS ALSO THE REASON THAT THE
2600 HZ TONE MUST BE SENT RAPIDLY; SOMETIMES, IT WON'T WORK WHEN THE OPERATOR
IS SAYING "HELLO, HELLO."  IT IS FEASIBLE TO SEND SOME "PINK NOISE" ALONG
WITH THE 2600 HZ.  MOST OF THIS ENERGY SHOULD BE ABOVE 3000 HZ.  THE PINK
NOISE WON'T MAKE IT INTO THE TOLL NETWORK (WHERE WE WANT OUR PURE 2600 HZ TO
HIT) BUT IT SHOULD MAKE IT PAST THE LOCAL CO AND THUS THE FRAUD DETECTORS.

CONSTRUCTION:
-------------

     WHILE STEP-BY-STEP DETAILS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BLUE BOX IS BEYOND 
THE SCOPE OF THIS TUTORIAL, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO MENTION SOME OF THE DETAILS.

     FIRST THERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES BUT THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL
BLUE BOX.  MANY COMPUTERS ARE CAPABLE OF GENERATING MF TONES.  THUS, YOUR
LOCAL PHRIENDLY SOFTWARE PIRATE SHOULD HAVE A PROGRAM COMPATIBLE FOR YOUR
COMPUTER.

     HOWEVER, IT IS HIGHLY ADVISABLE NOT TO BOX FROM HOME AS STATED IN THE
TEN COMMANDMENTS (AS INTERPRETED FOR PHREAKS BY FRED STEINBECK -- TAP #86).

I.  BOX THOU NOT OVER THINE HOME
    TELEPHONE WIRES, FOR THOSE WHO
    DOEST MUST SURELY BRING THE FULL
    WRATH OF THE CHIEF SPECIAL AGENT
    DOWN UPON THY HEADS.

     ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE THAT HAS A MODERATE SUCCESS RATE INVOLVES RECORDING
THE TONES FROM A PHRIEND WITH A BOX OR COMPUTER ONTO A CASSETTE TAPE.  THEY
CAN THEN BE USED AT A FORTRESS.

     AS FOR ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES, TAP HAS DEVOTED MANY ISSUES TO
BLUE BOXING.  BASICALLY, A BLUE BOX IS MERELY A DEVICE CAPABLE OF GENERATING
TWO DIFFERENT TONES SIMULTANEOUSLY.  THERE ARE TWO BASIC CONSTRUCTION METHODS
THAT I WILL OUTLINE BELOW FOR THE ELECTRONICS HOBBYIST.

     THE FIRST INVOLVES THE USE OF TWO 555 TIMER CHIPS (OR A 556 -- I.E., TWO
555'S IN ONE CHIP).  IT OFFERS EXCELLENT FREQUENCY AND VOLTAGE STABILITY. 
ALSO, IT DOES NOT NEED A DIODE MATRIX KEYPAD BUT USED DOUBLE-POLE SWITCHES
INSTEAD.  SCHEMATICS FOR THIS TYPE OF BOX CAN BE FOUND IN TAP ISSUE #29.

     THE OTHER COMMON BOX MAKES USE OF TWO INTERSIL 8038CC FUNCTION
GENERATORS.  IT ALSO REQUIRES A DIODE MATRIX KEYPAD, POTENTIOMETERS, AN LM
-100 VOLTAGE REGULATOR, A 741 OP-AMP, AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER PARTS.  THE
SCHEMATICS FOR THIS TYPE OF BLUE BOX CAN BE FOUND IN TAP #26.

     BOTH DESIGNS DRAW ABOUT 20 MA OF CURRENT.

     ALSO, MOST BLUE BOXES USE TELEPHONE EARPIECES (WITH THE VARISTOR REMOVED
) FOR SPEAKERS.  THESE CAN BE EASILY LIBERATED FROM FORTRESS FONES WITH A
SMALL COPING SAW.

     USUALLY, THE HARDEST PART ABOUT BUILDING A BLUE BOX IS THE CALIBRATION.
A FREQUENCY COUNTER IS A MUST AND AN OSCILLOSCOPE WON'T HURT.

     SOME BOXES ALSO TAKE TIMING INTO ACCOUNT.  IT IS FEASIBLE ON THE ESS
SYSTEMS THAT THEY CHECK TO SEE IF THE DIGITS ARE OF UNIFORM LENGTH.  IF THEY
AREN'T, THEY ARE PROBABLY FROM A BLUE BOX AND A TROUBLE CARD MAY BE DROPPED. 
WITH THIS IN MIND, THE BELL STANDARD FOR MF PULSES AND INTERDIGIT INTERVALS
IS AROUND 75 MS.  IT VARIES WITH THE EQUIPMENT USED SINCE ESS CAN HANDLE
HIGHER SPEEDS AND DOESN'T NEED INTERDIGIT INTERVALS.

APPLICATIONS:
-------------

     BESIDES DIALING NORMAL CALLS FREE, I.E., KP+NPA+NNX+XXXX+ST, BLUE BOXES
OFFER THE ENTIRE NETWORK FOR EXPLORATION.  EMERGENCY BREAK-INS, SERVICE
MONITORING (AKA TAPS), STACKING TANDEMS (THE ART OF BUSYING OUT ALL TRUNKS
BETWEEN TWO POINTS), RE-ROUTING CALLS, CONFERENCE CALLS, AND MUCH, MUCH MORE
ARE ALL FEASIBLE.  ALTHOUGH, BELL FREQUENTLY CHANGES THESE CODES DUE TO
PHREAKS.

     HERE ARE SOME STANDARD ONES, THOUGH:


OPERATOR & OTHER CODES:
-----------------------

     (AN OPTIONAL NPA MAY PROCEED ALL OF THE NUMBERS; OTHERWISE, YOU WILL
REACH THE ONE LOCAL FOR THE AREA WHERE THE CALL IS ORIGINATED)

001      --  TRUNK ACCESS SYSTEM

009      --  RATE QUOTE SYSTEM

101      --  TOLL OFFICE TEST BOARD

121      --  INWARD OPERATOR

     THIS OPERATOR ASSISTS THE LOCAL "0" OPERATOR IN COMPLETING CALLS.  (S)HE
WILL DO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING FOR YOU PROVIDING IT IS WITHIN HER NPA.

131      --  OPERATOR DIRECTORY
             ASSISTANCE

141      --  ROUT & RATE

     (141 DEFUNCT -- USE KP + 800 + 141 + 1212 + ST)

     THESE OPERATORS ARE VERY USEFUL IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MUMBLE A FEW CRYPTIC
PHRASES AS COMPILED BELOW (WITH THANKS TO FRED STEINBECK):

TO FIND OUT...

...AREA CODES

     FOR EXAMPLE SAY , "MIAMI, FLORIDA, NUMBERS ROUTE, PLEASE."  THE R&R
OPERATOR WILL TELL YOU "305 PLUS," MEANING THAT 305 PLUS THE SEVEN DIGIT
NUMBER WILL GET YOU MIAMI.

... INWARD OPERATOR CITY CODES

     USUALLY, THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR AN AREA IS SIMPLY KP + NPA + 121 + ST. 
IN SOME AREA CODES, THOUGH, THERE ARE SEVERAL LARGE CITIES AND THUS SEVERAL
INWARDS.  TO FIND THE INWARD FOR A SPECIFIC CITY, YOU WOULD SAY "916 756,
OPERATOR ROUTE, PLEASE" TO THE R&R OPERATOR WHO WILL THEN TELL YOU "916 PLUS
001 PLUS."  THIS MEANS THAT KP + 916 + 001 + 121 + ST WILL GET YOU AN INWARD
FOR SACRAMENTO, CA (916-756).

... CITY NAMES

     IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE CITY THAT CORRESPONDS TO AN AREA CODE AND
EXCHANGE, YOU SIMPLY TELL THE R&R, "PLACE NAME, 914 390, PLEASE."  IN THIS
EXAMPLE, THE R&R OPERATOR WILL RESPOND WITH "WHITE PLAINS, NY."

... INTERNATIONAL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE

     IF YOU NEED A DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR LONDON, YOU COULD SAY "INTERNATIONAL,
LONDON, ENGLAND.  TSPS DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE."  THE R&R OPERATOR WILL
RESPOND WITH "DIRECTORY TO LONDON, ENGLAND.  COUNTRY CODE 44 PLUS 1 PLUS 986
PLUS 3611." THEREFORE TO GET A DA OPERATOR IN LONDON, YOU WOULD ROUTE
YOURSELF TO AN INTERNATIONAL SENDER AND KP + 04419863611 + ST.

... COUNTRY & CITY CODES

     IF YOU NEED TO KNOW THE COUNTRY AND CITY CODE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL
NUMBER YOU CAN SAY "INTERNATIONAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, TSPS NUMBERS ROUTE,
PLEASE" AND GET "COUNTRY CODE 61 PLUS 2."

... INTERNATIONAL INWARDS ROUTES

     TO GET ROUTING CODES FOR INTERNATIONAL INWARDS SAY "INTERNATIONAL,
LONDON, ENGLAND, TSPS INWARD ROUTE, PLEASE."  THE R&R OPERATOR WILL RESPOND
WITH "COUNTRY CODE 44 PLUS 121."

     FINALLY, TO GET LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE FOR COMPLETING A FOREIGN CALL YOU
CAN TELL THE FOREIGN INWARD, "UNITED STATES CALLING.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE IN
COMPLETING A CALL TO (CALLED PARTY) AT (CALLED NUMBER)."


151      --  OVERSEAS INCOMING (212 + & 914+)

160-XX0  --  VARIOUS OVERSEAS OPERATORS

161      --  TROUBLE REPORTING OPERATOR (DEFUNCT)

181      -- COIN REFUND OPERATOR

18X      -- OVERSEAS SENDERS

     TO MAKE AN INTERNATIONAL CALL, ONE WOULD KP + 011 + 0CC + ST WHERE CC IS
THE COUNTRY CODE.  THIS WILL ROUTE YOU TO THE APPROPRIATE OVERSEAS SENDER. 
YOU WILL THEN RECEIVE A 480 HZ DIAL TONE.  HERE YOU ENTER KP + 0CC + CITY
CODE + LOCAL NUMBER + ST AND THE CALL IS ON ITS WAY.

     COUNTRY CODES CAN BE EITHER 1, 2, OR 3 DIGITS BUT THEY MUST BE PADDED
FOR THREE DIGITS TO CREATE A PSEUDO-COUNTRY CODE WITH EXTRA ZERO'S IF
NECESSARY.  FOR EXAMPLE, ENGLAND, COUNTRY CODE 44, BECOMES 044.

     TO SEE WHICH INTERNATIONAL SENDER A CERTAIN COUNTRY (LETS USE FRENCH
GUIANA, COUNTRY CODE 594, FOR EXAMPLE) GOES THROUGH, YOU CAN DIAL KP + 011 +
594 + ST, WAIT FOR THE PROCEED TO SEND TONE THEN KP + 000 + 0000 + ST AND YOU
WILL RECEIVE A RECORDING SAYING WHICH ISC (INTERNATIONAL SWITCHING CENTER) IT
IS.  FOR THE EXAMPLE IT WILL SAY, "THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL SWITCHING CENTER
IN PITTSBURG, PA -- THIS IS A RECORDING - 4121."  YOU CAN ACTUALLY ROUTE
CALLS TO CERTAIN SENDERS YOURSELF (KP + NPA + 18X + ST) BUT IT IS BETTER OFF
NOT TO SINCE IT MAY LOOK SUSPICIOUS IF A CALL IS SENT THROUGH A SENDER THAT
IT SHOULDN'T GO THROUGH.  HERE ARE THE SENDERS:

182  -- WHITE PLAINS, NY
183  -- NEW YORK, NY
184  -- PITTSBURG, PA
185  -- ORLANDO, FL
186  -- OAKLAND, CA
187  -- DENVER, CO
188  -- NEW YORK, NY

     ALSO, THERE TENDS TO BE ALOT OF TALK ABOUT THE CODE 11, CODE 12, KP2,
STP, ST3P, & ST2P KEYS.  WHILE THEY DO EXIST THE BLUE BOXER NEED NOT CONCERN
HIMSELF WITH THEM.  THE FIRST THREE ARE USED ON CCITT SYSTEM 5.  THIS IS THE
SIGNALING SYSTEM THAT THE INTERNATIONAL SENDERS USE TO SEND INFORMATION TO
OTHER COUNTRIES.  THESE CODES ARE USUALLY ADDED AUTOMATICALLY JUST LIKE THE
LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE DIGIT [WHICH DISTINGUISHES OPERATOR (OR BLUE BOX) DIALED
CALLS FROM CUSTOMER DIALED CALLS].  THE STP, ST3P, & ST2P TONES  ARE USED
WHEN EQUIPMENT IS COMMUNICATING WITH THE TSPS.  THESE ALSO ARE AUTOMATICALLY
ADDED WHEN NEEDED IN MOST CASES.

[SEE TELCOM III FOR MORE ON INTERNATIONAL SWITCHING CENTERS (ISC)]


11XXX    -- MISCELLANEOUS OPERATORS

11501    -- UNIVERSAL CORDBOARD OPERATOR
11511    -- CONFERENCE OPERATOR
11521    -- MOBILE OPERATOR
11531    -- MARINE OPERATOR
11541    -- LD INCOMING SWITCHBOARD
11551    -- LEAVE WORD FOR TIME & CHARGES (NEAT STUFF)
11561    -- SAME AS 11551 BUT FOR HOTEL/MOTELS
11571    -- OVERSEAS OPERATORS -- LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE

     THE 11XXX SERIES IS INTERESTING SCANNING MATERIAL.

MISCELLANEOUS ROUTING CODES :
-----------------------------

     ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING HAS SEVERAL NUMBERS, A FEW OF WHICH ARE LISTED
BELOW:

KP + 213 047 XXXX + ST
KP + 305 025 XXXX + ST
KP + 312 001 XXXX + ST

XXXX = 1050, 1100, OR A FEW OTHERS

     ALSO, AT KP + 317 009 + ST THERE IS A MF TONE CHECKER.  AFTER THE BEEP
-KERCLUNK, DIAL IN KP + 999 1234567 890 + ST AND IT WILL REPEAT THE DIGITS
THAT YOU PULSED IF THEY ARE OF THE RIGHT FREQUENCY.

TANDEM SCANNING:
----------------

     TO FIND ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING THINGS, YOU MUST LOOK.  BEGIN SCANNING
THREE DIGIT CODES IN YOUR AREA (I.E., KP + 000 + ST, KP + 001 + ST, ETC.). 
KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF YOUR RESULTS.  SOMETIMES YOU MUST PROBE THINGS, SEND
ADDITIONAL DIGITS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, SEND TOUCH-TONE, SEND IT 2600 HZ, RIP
IT APART.  YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU MAY RUN INTO SOMETHING PHUN, LIKE A COMPUTER
THAT CHECKS CC NUMBERS.

     INCIDENTALLY, IN SOME EXCHANGE YOU CAN DIAL INWARDS AND OTHER BOX CODES
DIRECTLY!  FOR EXAMPLE, 914-121-1111 WILL GET YOU A NY INWARD.  THE ONLY
PROBLEM IS THAT A 0 OR 1 AS THE FIRST DIGIT OF THE EXCHANGE IS USUALLY 
*PROHIBITED IN CUSTOMER DIALING.  SOMEBODY MAY HAVE "ACCIDENTALLY" CHANGED
THIS SCREENING CODE ON YOUR ESS'S COMPUTER, THOUGH -- YOU NEVER KNOW AND IT
CAN'T HURT TO TRY.  WATS TRANSLATION NUMBERS ALSO TAKE UP SOME OF THE 0XX &
1XX CODES.

     FINALLY, CERTAIN TONES ON THE BLUE BOX CAN ALSO BE USED FOR OTHER
PURPOSES.  AN MF "2" CORRESPONDS TO COIN COLLECT WHILE "KP" CORRESPONDS TO
COIN RETURN.  THUS EVERY BLUE BOX IS ALSO A GREEN BOX (SEE TELCOM VI).

COMING SOON:
------------

     TELCOM VIII WILL DEAL WITH CORDLESS PHONES, MOBILE PHONES, AND OTHER
NEAT THINGS.


BE CAREFUL AND HAVE PHUN,
