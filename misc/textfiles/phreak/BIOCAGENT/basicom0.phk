Re:    BIOC's Basic Telecommunications
       Series

As of date, there are 4 parts to my Basic Telecommunications series available 
on this board.

If you already have some of the files, you should re-download them again since
all of my files, parts 1-4, have recently been revised in the light of the 
break-up and other changes (ie, #'s, new info, etc.).

Part 5 is in its rough draft stage and it should be out soon.  It will deal 
with telephone electronics.
