        HOW TO BE A REAL PHREAK

In the phone phreak society there are certain values that exist in order to be 
a true phreak, these are best summed up by The Magician: "Many people think of 
phone phreaks as slime, out to rip off bell for all she is worth.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth!  Granted, there are some who get their kicks 
by making free calls; However, they are not true phone phreaks.  Real phone 
phreaks are 'telecommunications hobbyists' who experiment, play with and learn 
from the phone system.  Occasionally this experimenting, and a need to 
communicate with other phreaks (with-out going broke), leads to free calls.  
The free calls are but a small subset of a >true< phone phreaks activities.

         THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

Reprinted from tap issue #86.  (Tap, room 603, 147 W 42 street, New York, NY

that BIOC agent 003 told you about it.)

  THE PHONE PHREAK'S TEN COMMANDMENTS

   I.  BOX THOU NOT OVER THINE HOME
       TELEPHONE WIRES, FOR THOSE WHO
       DOEST MUST SURELY BRING THE
       WRATH OF THE CHIEF SPECIAL
       AGENT DOWN UPON THY HEADS.

  II.  SPEAKEST THOU NOT OF IMPORTANT
       MATTERS OVER THINE HOME TEL-
       EPHONE WIRES, FOR TO DO SO IS TO
       RISK THINE RIGHT OF FREEDOM.

 III.  USE NOT THINE OWN NAME WHEN
       SPEAKING TO OTHER PHREAKS, FOR
       THAT EVERY THIRD PHREAK IS AN
       FBI AGENT IS WELL KNOWN.

  IV.  LET NOT OVERLY MANY PEOPLE KNOW
       THAT THY BE A PHREAK, AS TO DO
       SO IS TO USE THINE OWN SELF AS
       A SACRIFICIAL LAMB.

   V.  IF THOU BE IN SCHOOL, STRIVE TO
       GET THIN SELF GOOD GRADES, FOR
       THE AUTHORITIES WELL KNOW THAT
       SCHOLARS NEVER BREAK THE LAW.

  VI.  IF THOU WORKEST, TRY TO BE A
       EMPLOYEE, AND IMPRESSEST THINE
       BOSS WITH THINE ENTHUSIASM, FOR
       IMPORTANT EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN
       SAVED BY THEIR OWN BOSSES.

 VII.  STOREST THOU NOT THINE STOLEN
       GOODES IN THINE OWN HOME, FOR
       THOSE WHO DO ARE SURELY NON-
       BELIEVERS IN THE BELL SYSTEM
       SECURITY FORCES, AND ARE NOT
       LONG FOR THIS WORLD.

VIII.  ATTRACTEST THOU NOT THE ATT-
       ENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES, AS
       THE LESS NOTICABLE THOU ART, THE
       BETTER.

  IX.  MAKEST SURE THINE FRIENDS ARE
       INSTANT AMNESIACS AND WILL NOT
       REMEMBER THAT THOU HAVE CALLED
       ILLEGALLY, FOR THEIR COOPERATION
       WITH THE AUTHORITIES WILL SURELY
       LESSEN THINE TIME FOR FREEDOM ON
       THIS EARTH.

   X.  SUPPORTEST THOU TAP, AS IT IS
       THINE NEWSLETTER, AND WITHOUT
       IT, THY WORK WILL BE FAR MORE
       LIMITED.

             CN/A NUMBERS

Customer name & address bureaus exist so that authorized bell employees may 
obtain the name & address of any customer in the bell system by giving the CN/A 
operator the customer's tel. #.  All customers are maintained on file including 
unlisted #'s.  These bureaus have many uses for phreaks.

Here is how an employee might go about calling CN/A:

"HI, this is john doe from the Miami residental service center, can I have the 
customer's name at (123) 555-1212." The employees usually use these for 
checking who belongs to a # that someone claimed they didn't call.

If you sound cheery and natural the operator will never ask any questions.  If 
you don't sound like a mature adult, don't use it!  Always practice first & so 
you don't screw up and make the operator suspicious.  Use name that sounds 
real, not your pirate name either!  Also say that you are from a city that is 
far away from the one that you are calling.

The CN/A number for the NY area & vicinity (212, 315, 516, 518, 607, 716,
& 914) is (518) 471-8111 and is open during business hours.  Don't abuse it!

            AT&T NEWSLINES

AT&T newslines are numbers at area phone offices that telco employees call to 
find out the latest info on new technology, stocks, etc.  The recorded reports 
range from very boring to very interesting.

HERE ARE A FEW OF THE NUMBERS:

 *(201) 483-3800 NJ  (518) 471-2272 NY
  (203) 771-4920 CN  (717) 255-5555 PA
  (212) 393-2151 NY  (717) 787-1031 PA
  (516) 234-9941 NY *(914) 948-8100 NY

Some of these numbers are toll-free, but you can't always count on it.

* These numbers are not always up!

Numbers from other areas are available by request from F)BIOC  L)AGENT 003.

             ANI NUMBERS

ANI numbers identify the phone number that you are calling from.  It is useful 
when playing in cans (those big silver boxes on telephone poles) to find out 
the # of the line.  It is also good to find out the # of a phone that doesn't 
have it printed on it.  In the 914 area code the ani # is 990.  if you just 
have to dial the last 4 digits for a local #, ie. congers (268), dial 
1-990-1111, where 1111 are dummy digits there is also a less useful type of ANI 
# which will identify the area code & exchange.  It is NXX-9901, where NXX is 
the exchange.  In the 212 & 516 area codes the ANI # is 958.  Sysop Note: (In 
an ESS Network, try 114.  In a non-ESS Network, try 1958, or 1-990-1111.)

          PHREAK NEWSLETTER

TAP is the "official" phone phreak newsletter, and has existed since 1971. Each 
4 page issue is crammed full of information on phone phreaking, computer 
phreaking, free gas, free electricity, free postage, breaking & entering info, 
etc.  It is largely phone phreak oriented, however.

A 10 issue subscription costs $8.00, if you get a bulk rate sealed envelope 
subscription.  I would recommend the first class subscription, which is $10.

As of this writing (7-16-83), the  current issue is #86, and issue #50 is 8 
pages instead of the usual 4.  Back issues are $0.75 each, and issue #50 is 
$1.50.  A brief index to the first 80 issues is available for an SASE, or free 
with a subscription order.  TAP is non-profit, and in desperate need of 
material (articles), money, and volunteers.

BELIEVE ME:  IT WILL BE THE BEST $10
             YOU WILL EVER SPEND.

              BLACK BOX

The black box is a device that attached to a called parties phone that allows 
him/her to receive free long distance calls from friends who call.

You only need  2 parts:  a spst toggle switch and a 10,000 ohm (10  k), 1/2 
watt, 10% resistor.  any electronics place should have these.

Now, cut two pieces of wire, about 6 inches, and attach these to the two screws 
on the switch. turn your normal ddside down and unscrew the 2 screws.  Locate 
the "F" and "RR" screws on the network box.  Wrap the resistor between these 2  
screws and make sure that the wires touch only the proper terminals!  Now 
connect one wire from the switch to the RR terminal.  Finally, attach the 
remaining wire to the green wire (disconnect it from its terminal).  Now bring 
the switch out the rear of the phone and close it up.  Put the switch in a 
position where you get a dial tone, mark this normal.  Mark the other side 
free.

When your friends call (at a prearranged time), quickly lift & drop the 
receiver as fast as possible.  This will stop the ringing, if not try again.  
It is very important that you do it fast!  now put the switch in the free 
position and pick up the phone.  Keep all calls short & under 15 minutes.

When someone calls you long-distance, they are billed from the moment you 
answer.  The telco knows when you answer due to a certain amount of voltage 
that flows when you pick up the phone.  However, the resistor cuts down on the 
voltage so it is below the billing range but sufficient enough to operate the 
mouthpiece.  Answering the phone for a fraction of a second stops the ring but 
it is not enough for billing to start.  If the phone is answered for even one 
full second, billing will start and you will be cut off when you hang up and 
switch to free.

WARNING:  BELL CAN RANDOMLY LOOK FOR
          BLACK BOXES SO BE CAREFUL!

              DIAL LOCKS

Have you ever been in an office or somewhere and wanted to make a free fone 
call but some asshole put a lock on the fone to prevent out-going calls?

Fret no more phellow phreaks, for every system can be beaten with a little 
knowledge!

There are two ways to beat this obstacle, first pick the lock, I don't  have 
the time to teach locksmithing so we go to the second method which takes 
advantage of telephone electronics.

To be as simple as possible, when you  pick up the fone you complete a circuit 
know as a local loop.  When you hang-up you break the circuit.  When you dial 
(pulse) it also breaks the circuit but not long enough to hang up!  So you can 
"push-dial."  To do this you >rapidly< depress the switchhook.  For example, to 
dial an operator (and then give her the number you want called) >rapidly< & 
>evenly< depress the switchhook 10 times.  To dial 634-1268, depress 6 x's 
pause, then 3 x's, pause, then 4 x's, etc.  It takes a little practice but 
you'll get the hang of it.  Try practicing with your own # so you'll get a busy 
tone when right.  It'll also work on TOUCH-TONE(TM) since a DTMF line will also 
accept pulse.  Also, never depress the switchhook for more than a second or 
it'll hang-up!

Finally, remember that you have just as much right to that fone as the asshole 
who put the lock on it!

           EXCHANGE SCANNING

Almost every exchange in the bell system has test #'s and other "goodies" such 
as loops with dial-ups.

These "goodies" are usually found between 9900 and 9999 in your local exchange. 
If you have the time and initiative, scan your exchange and you may become 
lucky!

HERE ARE MY FINDINGS IN THE 914-268 EXCHANGE:


9900 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9901 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF
       A LOOP)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL
       OFFICE
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL
       OFFICE
9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE
       TRANSMISSION?)
9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) --
       MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME
       EXCHANGES
9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS
       TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS

MOST OF THE NUMBERS BETWEEN 9900 & 9999 WILL RING OR GO TO A "WHAT #, PLEASE?"
OPERATOR.

HAVE PHUN AND REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A LOCAL CALL!

      TOUCH-TONE & FREE CALLS

THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE FREE CALLS (SPRINT, MCI, ETC.) USING A
ROTARY PHONE.  THEY ARE:

 1. USE A NUMBER THAT ACCEPTS VOICE AS
    WELL AS DTMF.  SUCH A # IS (800)
    521-8400.  AS OF WRITING THIS, A
    CODE WAS 00717865.

     A) IF USING VOICE, WAIT FOR THE
        COMPUTER TO SAY, "AUTHORIZATION
        #, PLEASE."  THEN SAY EACH
        DIGIT SLOWLY, IT WILL BEEP
        AFTER EACH DIGIT IS SAID.
        AFTER EVERY GROUP OF DIGITS, IT
        WILL REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
        THEN SAY YES IF IT IS CORRECT,
        OTHERWISE SAY NO.  IF THE
        ACCESS CODE IS CORRECT, IT WILL
        THANK YOU AND ASK FOR THE
        DESTINATION #, THEN SAY THE
        AREA CODE + NUMBER AS ABOVE.
        ANOTHER SUCH # IS (800) 245-
        8173, WHICH HAS A 6 DIGIT
        ACCESS CODE. (NOTE:  IF USING
        TOUCH-TONE ON THIS #, ENTER THE
        CODE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TONE
        STOPS.)

 2.  HOOK UP A TOUCH-TONE FONE INTO
     YOUR ROTARY FONE.  ATTACH THE RED
     WIRE FROM THE TOUCH-TONE FONE TO
     THE "R" TERMINAL INSIDE THE FONE
     ON THE NETWORK BOX.  THEN HOOK THE
     GREEN WIRE TO THE "B" TERMINAL.
     TO USE THIS DIAL THE # USING
     ROTARY & THEN USE THE TOUCH-TONE
     FOR THE CODES. (DON'T HANG UP THE
     ROTARY FONE WHILE DOING THIS
     THOUGH!)  IF THIS DOESN'T WORK
     THEN REVERSE THE 2 WIRES.  (NOTE:
     IF YOUR LINE CAN ACCEPT TOUCH-TONE
     BUT YOU HAVE A ROTARY FONE THEN
     YOU CAN HOOK UP A TONE FONE
     DIRECTLY FOR ALL CALLS BUT THIS
     USUALLY ISN'T THE CASE.)
     SUCH AS RADIO SHACK'S 43-138.

OTHER ALTERNATIVES

 4.  USE A CHARGE-A-CALL FONE.  (THESE
     ALSO MAKE GREAT EXTENTIONS IF YOU
     REMOVE IT USING A HEX WRENCH WITH
     A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE ON THE CENTER
     SCREW!)--(THESE FONES FOR THE
     BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW
     ARE BLUE WITH NO COIN SLOTS)

 5.  USE A PAY FONE THAT WANTS YOUR
     MONEY BEFORE THE DIAL TONE.  PUT
     IN YOUR DIME, DIAL THE #; IF IT'S
     AN 800 # THEN YOUR DIME WILL COME
     BACK, IMMEDIATELY PUT A DIME BACK
     IN (IT'LL COME BACK WHEN YOU HANG
     UP!)  IF IT IS A TONE FIRST FONE
     AND IT DISCONNECTS THE KEYPAD
     (SOME DON'T) THEN FIND ANOTHER
     FONE.

             TELCO TRACING

THE GOOD 'OL DAYS:
------------------

Way back before I was a phreak, ma bell would have to manually trace a call if 
they thought something was fucked up.  First they would send a 2000 HZ tracing 
tone, it would be followed by alot of noise and clicks.  It took about 2-3 
minutes to trace a call and alot of people were involved in the process.  So at 
1 in the morning they would have to wake up people for the tracees (phreak 
jargon for a pay fone).  But never use the same one more than once or twice 
because the Gestapo (er..excuse me mean bell security) has been know for 
staking out troubled fortresses.  It's also possible for TRAVELNET or SP to ask 
for a trouble # but the telco is slow in processing stuff--especially for the 
competition--so don't fret phellow phreaks.

MODERN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------

this can be attributed to ESS + CCIS which can be traced in 1 second.

         MISCELLANEOUS STUFF

Here are a phew (pushing it on that word) bits of info on telephone 
electronics.  If you don't appreciate it then I say "PHUCK U."

VOLTAGES:

When your fone is on-hook (ie-hung up) there is a 48 volt DC current flowing
through the line (I have a great idea about hooking a battery charger up to my 
fone ).  When the fone is off-hook the voltage drops down to around 15VDC. The 
black box (see separate articles) exploits this for free calls since bell uses 
this voltage drop when the called party picks up to start billing.  Bell may 
also reverse the polarity of the line to start billing--if you have a tone fone 
the keypad won't work if the polarity is reversed.  Usually, the red wire is 
called the tip since it is the more (+) of the 2 wires + the green wire is 
called the ring (-).

RING TRIP:

When someone calls you bell has to send 90 volts AC down your line at about 60 
HZ to activate your bell (this is why deaf people can have light bulbs & fans 
go off instead of a bell).  The device that does the ringing is called a 
ringing generator and the process of ringing is called a ring trip.  This costs 
bell money and they don't like using all that electricity from the local 
rip-off power company - so let it ring.  This is also, how bell can check for 
extra fones from their central office by seeing how much voltage the line takes 
while ringing and they can tell how many fones you're not suppose to have. 
Solution:  disconnect the bell.

MODERN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------

The 2 worst enemies to the phreak besides the FBI + bell security, are: ESS + 
CCIS.  ESS stands for Electronic Switching System and it can trace a call in 
seconds, it also records all calls and can even tap into lines (er..I mean 
check for line quality) and record calls.  CCIS stands for common channel 
inter-office signaling and it allows for control signals to be sent via 
separate data links instead of tones over the voice channel--start kissing your 
blue box goodbye.
