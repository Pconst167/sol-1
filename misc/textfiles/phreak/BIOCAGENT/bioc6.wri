PREFACE:

THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE STANDARD WESTERN ELECTRIC SINGLE-
SLOT COIN TELEPHONE (AKA FORTRESS FONE) WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 3 TYPES:

- DIAL-TONE FIRST (DTF)

- COIN-FIRST (CF):  (IE, IT WANTS YOUR $ BEFORE YOU RECEIVE A DIAL TONE)

- DIAL POST-PAY SERVICE (PP): (YOU PAY AFTER THE PARTY ANSWERS)


DEPOSITING COINS (SLUGS):
-------------------------

ONCE YOU HAVE DEPOSITED YOUR SLUG INTO A FORTRESS, IT IS SUBJECTED TO A GAMUT
OF TESTS.

THE FIRST OBSTACAL FOR A SLUG IS THE MAGNETIC TRAP.  THIS WILL STOP ANY LIGHT
-WEIGHT MAGNETIC SLUGS AND COINS.  IF IT PASSES THIS, THE SLUG IS THEN
CLASSIFIED AS A NICKEL, DIME, OR QUARTER.  EACH SLUG IS THEN CHECKED FOR
APPROPRIATE SIZE AND WEIGHT.  IF THESE TESTS ARE PASSED, IT WILL THEN TRAVEL
THROUGH A NICKEL, DIME, OR QUARTER MAGNET AS APPROPRIATE.  THESE MAGNETS SET
UP AN EDDY CURRENT EFFECT WHICH CAUSES COINS OF THE APPROPRIATE
CHARACTERISTICS TO SLOW DOWN SO THEY WILL FOLLOW THE CORRECT TRAJECTORY.  IF
ALL GOES WELL, THE COIN WILL FOLLOW THE CORRECT PATH (SUCH AS BOUNCING OFF OF
THE NICKEL ANVIL) WHERE IT WILL HOPEFULLY FALL INTO THE NARROW ACCEPTED COIN
CHANNEL.

THE RATHER ELABORATE TESTS THAT ARE PERFORMED AS THE COIN TRAVELS DOWN THE
COIN CHUTE WILL STOP MOST SLUGS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE COINS, SUCH AS PENNIES,
WHICH MUST THEN BE RETRIEVED USING THE COIN RELEASE LEVER.

IF THE SLUG MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVES THE GAMUT, IT WILL THEN STRIKE THE
APPROPRIATE TOTALIZER ARM CAUSING A RATCHET WHEEL TO ROTATE ONCE FOR EVERY 5
-CENT INCREMENT (EG, A QUARTER WILL CAUSE IT TO ROTATE 5 TIMES).

THE TOTALIZER THEN CAUSES THE COIN SIGNAL OSCILLATOR TO READOUT A DUAL
-FREQUENCY SIGNAL INDICATING THE VALUE DEPOSITED TO ACTS (A COMPUTER) OR THE
TSPS OPERATOR.  THESE ARE THE SAME TONES USED BY PHREAKS IN THE INFAMOUS RED
BOXES.

FOR A QUARTER, 5 BEEP TONES ARE OUTPULSED AT 12-17 PULSES PER SECOND (PPS). 
A DIME CAUSES 2 BEEP TONES AT 5 - 8.5 PPS WHILE A NICKEL CAUSES ONE BEEP TONE
AT 5 - 8.5 PPS.  A BEEP CONSISTS OF 2 TONES:  2200 + 1700 HZ.

A RELAY IN THE FORTRESS CALLED THE "B RELAY" (YES, THERE IS ALSO AN 'A RELAY'
) PLACES A CAPACITOR ACROSS THE SPEECH CIRCUIT DURING TOTALIZER READ- OUT TO
PREVENT THE "CUSTOMER" FROM HEARING THE RED BOX TONES.

IN OLDER 3 SLOT PHONES:  ONE BELL (1050 -1100 HZ) FOR A NICKEL, TWO BELLS FOR
A DIME, AND ONE GONG (800 HZ) FOR A QUARTER ARE USED INSTEAD OF THE MODERN
DUAL-FREQUENCY TONES.

=============
=TSPS & ACTS=
=============

WHILE FORTRESSES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CO OF THE AREA, ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE
HANDLED VIA THE TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITION SYSTEM (TSPS).  IN AREAS THAT DO NOT
HAVE ACTS, ALL CALLS THAT REQUIRE OPERATOR ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS CALLING CARD
AND COLLECT, ARE AUTOMATICALLY ROUTED TO A TSPS OPERATOR POSITION.

IN AN EFFORT TO AUTOMATE FORTRESS SERVICE, A COMPUTER SYSTEM KNOWN AS
AUTOMATED COIN TOLL SERVICE (ACTS) HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MANY AREAS.  ACTS
LISTENS TO THE RED BOX SIGNALS FROM THE FONES AND TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTION. 
IT IS ACTS WHICH SAYS, "TWO DOLLARS PLEASE (PAUSE) PLEASE DEPOSIT TWO DOLLARS
FOR THE NEXT TEN SECONDS" (AND OTHER VARIATIONS).  ALSO, IF YOU TALK FOR MORE
THAN THREE MINUTES AND THEN HANG-UP, ACTS WILL CALL BACK AND DEMAND YOUR
MONEY.  ACTS IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR AUTOMATED CALLING CARD SERVICE.

ACTS ALSO PROVIDE TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS FOR CRAFTSPEOPLE (REPAIRMEN SPECIALIZING
IN FORTRESSES).  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A COIN TEST WHICH IS GREAT FOR TUNING
UP RED BOXES.  IN MANY AREAS THIS TEST CAN BE ACTIVATED BY DIALING 09591230
AT A FORTRESS (THANKS TO KARL MARX FOR THIS INFORMATION).  ONCE ACTIVATED IT
WILL REQUEST THAT YOU DEPOSIT VARIOUS COINS.  IT WILL THEN IDENTIFY THE COIN
AND OUTPULSE THE APPROPRIATE RED BOX SIGNAL.  THE COINS ARE USUALLY RETURNED
WHEN YOU HANG UP.

TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY MONEY IN THE FONE, THE CO INITIATES A 
"GROUND TEST" AT VARIOUS TIMES TO DETERMINE IF A COIN IS ACTUALLY IN THE FONE
.  THIS IS WHY YOU MUST DEPOSIT AT LEAST A NICKEL IN ORDER TO USE A RED BOX!

GREEN BOXES:
------------

PAYING THE INITIAL RATE IN ORDER TO USE A RED BOX (ON CERTAIN FORTRESSES)
LEFT A SOUR TASTE IN MANY RED BOXER'S MOUTHS THUS THE GREEN BOX WAS INVENTED.
 THE GREEN BOX GENERATES USEFUL TONES SUCH AS COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND
RINGBACK.  THESE ARE THE TONES THAT ACTS OR THE TSPS OPERATOR WOULD SEND TO
THE CO WHEN APPROPRIATE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE GREEN BOX CANNOT BE USED AT A
FORTRESS STATION BUT IT MUST BE USED BY THE CALLED PARTY.

HERE ARE THE TONES:

     COIN COLLECT       700 + 1100 HZ
     COIN RETURN       1100 + 1700 HZ
     RINGBACK           700 + 1700 HZ

BEFORE THE CALLED PARTY SENDS ANY OF THESE TONES, AN OPERATOR RELEASED SIGNAL
SHOULD BE SENT TO ALERT THE MF DETECTORS AT THE CO.  THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
BY SENDING 900 + 1500 HZ OR A SINGLE 2600 HZ WINK (90 MS) FOLLOWED BY A 60 MS
GAP AND THEN THE APPROPRIATE SIGNAL FOR AT LEAST 900 MS.

ALSO, DO NOT FORGET THAT THE INITIAL RATE IS COLLECTED SHORTLY BEFORE THE 3
MINUTE PERIOD IS UP.

INCIDENTALLY, ONCE THE ABOVE MF TONES FOR COLLECTING AND RETURNING COINS
REACH THE CO, THEY ARE CONVERTED INTO AN APPROPRIATE DC PULSE (-130 VOLTS FOR
RETURN & +130 VOLTS FOR COLLECT).  THIS PULSE IS THEN SENT DOWN THE TIP TO
THE FORTRESS.  THIS CAUSES THE COIN RELAY TO EITHER RETURN OR COLLECT THE
COINS.

THE ALLEGED "T-NETWORK" TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THIS INFORMATION.  WHEN A PULSE
FOR COIN COLLECT (+130 VDC) IS SENT DOWN THE LINE, IT MUST BE GROUNDED
SOMEWHERE.  THIS IS USUALLY EITHER THE YELLOW OR BLACK WIRE.  THUS, IF THE
WIRES ARE EXPOSED, THESE WIRES CAN BE CUT TO PREVENT THE PULSE FROM BEING
GROUNDED.  WHEN THE THREE MINUTE INITIAL PERIOD IS ALMOST UP, MAKE SURE THAT
THE BLACK & YELLOW WIRES ARE SEVERED; THEN HANG UP, WAIT ABOUT 15 SECONDS IN
CASE OF A SECOND PULSE, RECONNECT THE WIRES, PICK UP THE FONE, HANG UP AGAIN,
AND IF ALL GOES WELL IT SHOULD BE "JACKPOT" TIME.

PHYSICAL ATTACK:
----------------

A TYPICAL FORTRESS WEIGHS ROUGHLY 50 LBS. WITH AN EMPTY COIN BOX.  MOST OF
THIS IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE ARMOR PLATING.  WHY ALL THE SECURITY?  WELL,
BELL CONTRIBUTES IT TO THE FOLLOWING:

  "SOCIAL CHANGES DURING THE 1960'S MADE THE MULTISLOT COIN STATION A PRIME
TARGET FOR:  VANDALISM, STRONG ARM ROBBERY, FRAUD, AND THEFT OF SERVICE. 
THIS BROUGHT ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MORE RUGGED SINGLE SLOT COIN
STATION AND A NEW ENVIRONMENT FOR COIN SERVICE."

AS FOR PICKING THE LOCK, I WILL QUOTE MR. PHELPS:  "WE OFTEN FANTASIZE ABOUT 
'PICKING THE LOCK' OR 'GETTING A MASTER KEY.'  WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT.
 I DON'T LIKE TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE, BUT IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM WASTING ALOT OF
YOUR TIME--TIME WHICH CAN BE PUT TO BETTER USE (HEH, HEH)."

AS FOR PHYSICAL ATTACK, THE COIN PLATE IS SECURED ON ALL FOUR SIDE BY
HARDENED STEEL BOLTS WHICH PASS THROUGH TWO SLOTS EACH.  THESE BOLTS ARE IN
TURN INTERLOCKED BY THE MAIN LOCK.

ONE PHREAK I KNOW DID MANAGE TO TAKE ONE OF THE 'MOTHERS' HOME (WHICH WAS
ATTACHED TO A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE; OTHERWISE, THE
PERMANENT ONES ARE A BITCH TO DETACH FROM THE WALL!).  IT TOOK HIM ALMOST TEN
HOURS TO OPEN THE COIN BOX USING A POWER DRILL, SLEDGE HAMMERS, AND CROW BARS
(WHICH WAS EMPTY -- PERHAPS NEXT TIME, HE WILL DEPOSIT A COIN FIRST TO HEAR
IF IT SLUSHES DOWN NICELY OR HITS THE EMPTY BOTTOM WITH A CLUNK.)

TAKING THE FONE OFFERS A HIGHER MARGIN OF SUCCESS.  ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE
DIFFICULT OFTEN REQUIRING BRUTE FORCE AND THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF
BACK AXLES BEING LOST TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A FONE!  A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO
OPEN THE COIN BOX IS BY USING A SHOTGUN.  IN DETROIT, AFTER ECOLOGISTS
CLEANED OUT A MUNICIPAL POND, THEY FOUND 168 COIN PHONE RIFLED.

IN COLDER AREAS, SUCH AS CANADA, SOME SHREWD PEOPLE TAPE UP THE FONES USING
DUCT TAPE, POUR IN WATER, AND COME BACK THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE WATER WILL HAVE
FROZE THUS EXPANDING AND CRACKING THE FONE OPEN.

IN ONE CASE, "UNAUTHORIZED COIN COLLECTORS" WHERE CAUGHT WHEN THEY BROUGHT $6
,000 IN CHANGE TO A BANK AND THE BANK BECAME SUSPICIOUS...

AT ANY RATE, THE MAIN LOCK IS AN EIGHT LEVEL TUMBLER LOCATED ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF THE COIN BOX.  THIS LOCK HAS 390, 625 POSSIBLE POSITIONS (5 ^ 8,
SINCE THERE ARE 8 TUMBLERS EACH WITH 5 POSSIBLE POSITIONS) THUS IT IS HIGHLY
PICK RESISTANT!  THE LOCK IS HELD IN PLACE BY 4 SCREWS.  IF THERE IS
SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE FONE, IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO PUNCTURE
IT.

HAVE MUCH PHUN,
 THERE IS MORE TO COME... IN CHAPTER #7...
