			   "Loops I've Known and Loved"

  No self-respecting Phone Phreak can go through life without knowing what a
loop is, how to use one, and the types that are available.  The loop is a great
alternate communication medium that has many potential uses that haven't even
been tapped yet.  In order to explain what a loop is, it would be helpful if
you would visualize two phone numbers (lines) just floating around in the Telco
central office.  Now, if you ( and a friend perhaps) were to call these two
numbers at the same time, POOOOFFFF!!!, you are now connected together.  I hear
what you're saying out there ..., "Big deal" or "Why should mother bell collect
two MSU's (message units) for one lousy phone call!?" Well ...  think again.
Haven't you ever wanted someone to call you back, but were reluctant to give
out your home phone number (like the last time you tried to get your friends'
unlisted number from the business office)?  Or how about a collect call to your
friend waiting on a loop, who will gladly accept the charges?  Or better yet,
stumbling a loop that you discover has multi-user capability (for those
late-night conference).  Best of all is finding a non- supervised loop that
doesn't charge any MSU's or tolls to one or both parties.  Example:  many moons
ago, a loop affectionately known as 'The 332 Loop' was non-sup on one 'side'.
I had my friend in California dial the free (non-sup) side, (212) 332 - 9906
and I dialed the side that charged, 332-9900.  As you can see, I was charged
one MSU, and my friend was charged zilch, for as long as we wished to talk!!!

  Ahhhh ....  have I perked your intrest yet?  If so, here is how to find a
loop of your very own.	First, do all of your loop searching at NIGHT!	This is
because the loops serve a genuine test function which Telco uses during the
day.  (We don't want to run into an irate lineman now, do we?) To find a loop,
having two phone numbers is a definite plus.  If not, get a friend to dial
numbers at his location.  Last resort, try dialing from two adjacent pay
phones.  Now, get your trusty white pages, and turn to the page where it lists
Metro NY exchanges and the number of MSU's from your exchange.  The idea is to
get a loop that is only one MSU from your calling area so you don't go bankrupt
trying to find a working one.  So write down in a list all of these exchanges.
The following are common loop endings (EXC stands for the exchange):

Manhatten and The Bronx ---------- EXC - 9977 & EXC - 9979
Brooklyn and Queens -------------- EXC - 9900 & EXC - 9906

  Armed with the preceding info, dial the tone side of a loop.	This would be
the 9906 or 9979 side.	The best thing that could happen now is that you will
be able to hear yourself, or friend through the loop connection.  Eureka,
you've found a loop!!!  Unfortunately, this doesn't happen too often.  Here are
the more common possibilites:

  1.  You can hear through the loop (not muted) but there is a 1/2 second click
every 10 seconds that interrupts the audio.  Good for backup use, but the
%&%$%%!  click is super annoying.

  2.  One side of the loop is busy; try it again later.

  3.  The tone disappears, but you cannot hear through it (the loop is muted,
try again in a month or so) .

  4.  You get "The number you have reached" recording.  No more loop in that
exchange, go on to next.

  Most loops fall into catagory #3, but they do become unmuted from time to
time.  Once you have found a loop, its uses are only limited to your
imagination.  If you discover any novel uses for loop lines, I am always
willing to learn, so leave them for me here on *MOM*.

				   Happy Looping,

  The preceding article was duplicated from one posted on Modem Over Manhatten
(MOM).	MOM is no longer in operation, however was one of the first bulletin
boards (after 8BBS) to support phreeking.  The original author of this article
was the one and only Phred Phreek.  Note that the comments at the end of the
article no longer apply, as this article was written in 1981, and Phred Phreek
has not been heard of since MOM went down.

  HERE ARE SOME NEW LOOPS.  ALL ARE IN THE 212 AREA.  ON ANY GIVEN DAY OR NITE
SEVERAL MAY BE BUSY,(MORE OFTEN CASUAL USERS THAN TELCO PERSONNEL.) AND ON ANY
GIVEN DAY OR NITE SEVERAL MAY BE INOPERATIVE.  IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER TELCO
MAINTENANCE PERSONELL REMEMBER TO 'THROW THE KEY' WHEN THEYRE DONE LINE
TESTING.  IF THEY REMEMBER TO TO TURN A LINE 'OFF', THEN IT'LL REMAIN OFF TILL
THE NEXT MAINTENANCE TECH.  FORGETS TO TURN IT OFF AFTER USING IT.  DO NOT
ASSUME THESE ARE FREE CALLS.  UNLESS THE #'S ARE IN YOUR UNLESS THE #'S ARE IN
YOUR PRIMARY CALLING AREA,YOU ARE BILLED EITHER MSU'S OR TOLL UNITS DEPENDING
UPON DISTANCE.	NEVERTHELESS LOOPS ARE LOTS OF FUN,AND YOU CAN OFTEN MEET NEW
PEOPLE ON THEM.  ESPECIALLY LATE ON WEEKEND NITES.  ALSO, LATE ON WEEKEND NITES
YOU WILL FIND SEVERAL OF THE LOOPS BEING USED BY AM, FM OR SHORTWAVE PIRATE
RADIO STATIONS FOR CALL IN LINES.  MOST OF THESE STATIONS ARE IN THE N.Y.
AREA, BUT THE REMAINDER ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  212 LOOPS REMAIN THE BEST
KNOWN IN THE PIRATE RADIO WORLD,AND SO ARE USED BY PIRATES EVERYWHERE.	NOW.
..HERE GOES WITH THE LOOPS:

212-529-9900/9906   212-283-9977/9979	212-352-9900-9906   212-220-9977/9979
212-365-9977/9979   212-562-9977/9979	212-982-9977/9979   212-986-9977/9979
---------------------*

  THE LOWER NUMBER IS THE ONE WITH THE SQUEAL.	IT SQUEALS (SINGING SWITCH)
TILL SOMEONE DIALS THE OTHER NUMBER IN THE PAIR.  THEN THE SQUEAL DIES AND
YOURE CONNECTED.  NONE THE HIGHER NUMBER NEVER DOES SQUEAL, EVEN IF THE OTHER
PART OF THE PAIR IS UNUSED.  SO YOU HAVE TO KINDA GUESS AT WHEN SOMEONE IS
SWITCHED IN AFTER DIALING.  LISTEN FOR THE CLICKS,THATLL TELL YOU.  THE 982 AND
986 #'S ARE KINDA WIERD.  NORMALLY IF YOU PARK ON A LOOP, YOU WILL HEAR WHOEVER
CALLS THE OTHER HALF,AND WHEN THEYRE DONE,THE NEXT CALLER(IF ANY) WILL BE
QUEUED IN, ONE AFTER THE OTHER.  NOW ON THE 982 AND 986, YOU SOMETIMES CANT GET
ANY MORE CALLERS AFTER THE FIRST.  FURTHERMORE, IF YOU PARK ON THESE TWO LOOPS
AND THE OTHER END REMAINS UNCALLED FOR 4 MINUTES, YOU MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY
DISCONNECTED.  YET THESE LOOPS ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING--ESP.  ON WEEKENDS WHEN
ALL OTHER LOOPS ARE BUSY.......  IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LOOPS IN OTHER AREA CODES,
PLEASE LEAVE THEM, EITHER IN BULL.  OR LV.  A MESSAGE FOR DARK PRIEST.
THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE, AND ENJOY YOUR LOOPS.

		 How to fight Sprint Security

Well friends, Sprint has declared war on the phone phreaks and is starting to
set traps, trace lines, and question the SYSOPs of BBS systems.  I thank that
this has gone on long enough!!

It time we start to fight back.  What I would suggest is that everybody find
five or ten access codes and put these on a flyer with a local access number
and instructions on how to use the system and how to find more codes.  Next,
make a LARGE number of copies of this flyer and distribute them as widely as
possible.  Put them on cars in the school parking lot, in the local phone
booths, on bulletin boards a round colleges, etc.

If Sprint starts experiencing a VERY large number of ripoffs then a number of
things could happen.  The bright boy in security who decided to start the
crack-down may get fired, paying customers may get fed up with the huge bills,
SPC may make the codes longer and thus lose customers because of the
inconvenience of the longer codes.  In any case, SPC will have so many people
using the system for free that the chances of them getting anyone of us is so
small as to be insignificant.
