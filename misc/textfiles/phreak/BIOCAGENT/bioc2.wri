PREFACE:

IN PART II, WE WILL EXPLORE THE VARIOUS SPECIAL BELL #'S, SUCH AS:

CN/A, AT&T NEWSLINES, LOOPS, 99XX #'S, ANI, RINGBACK, AND A FEW OTHERS.

CN/A: -----

CN/A, WHICH STANDS FOR CUSTOMER NAME AND ADDRESS, ARE BUREAUS THAT EXIST SO
THAT AUTHORIZED BELL EMPLOYEES CAN FIND OUT THE NAME AND ADRESS OF ANY
CUSTOMER IN THE BELL SYSTEM.  ALL #'S ARE MAINTAINED ON IE INCLUDING UNLISTED
#'S.  HRE'S HOW IT WORKS:

 1) YOU HAVE A # AND YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO OWNS IT, E.G. (914) 555-1234.

 2) YOU LOOK UP THE CN/A # FOR THAT NPA IN THE LIST BELOW.  IN THE EXAMPLE,
THE NPA IS 914 AND THE CN/A # IS 518-471-8111.

 3) YOU THEN CALL UP THE CN/A # (DURING BUSINESS HOURS) AND SAY SOMETHING
LIKE, "HI, THIS IS JOHN JONES FROM THE RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CENTER IN MIAMI. 
CAN I HAVE THE CUSTOMER'S NAME AT 914-555-1234.  THAT # IS 914-555-1234."
MAKE UP YOUR OWN REAL SOUNDING NAME, THOUGH.

 4) IF YOU SOUND NATURAL & CHEERY, THE OPERATOR WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS.


HERE'S THE LIST:

BELL USES THESE #'S MAINLY TO FIND OUT WHO OWNS A # THAT A CUSTOMER CLAIMS HE
NEVER CALLED.

NOTE:  THIS IS THE MOST COMPLETE LIST OF CN/A #'S IN MY POSSESSION (WITH ONLY
5 #'S NOT AVAILABLE) THIS LIST WAS COPYRIGHTED IN 1982 BY "JUDAS GERARD" AS
IT ORIGINALLY APPEARED IN TAP ISSUE #78.  (TAP, ROOM 603, 147 W 42ND ST, NEW
YORK, NY 10036--SUBSCRIPTIONS $10/YR.)

AT&T NEWSLINES: ---------------

NEWSLINES ARE RECORDINGS THAT BELL EMPLOYEES CALL UP TO FIND OUT THE LATEST
INFO ON STOCK, TECHNOLOGY, ETC.  CONCERNING THE BELL SYSTEM.

HERE ARE THE #'S THAT ARE CURRENTLY KNOWN TO PHREAKS (AT LEAST ME, ANYWAY):

======= =LOOPS= =======

FIRST OF ALL, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF LOOPS.  I THINK THAT THE
BEST WAY THAT THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IS THE WAY THAT PHRED PHREEK EXPLAINED IT...

"NO SELF-RESPECTING PHONE PHREAK CAN GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT A
LOOP IS, HOW TO USE ONE, AND THE TYPES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.  THE LOOP IS A
GREAT ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION MEDIUM THAT HAS MANY POTENTIAL USES THAT
HAVENT'T EVEN BEEN TAPPED YET.  IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN WHAT A LOOP IS, IT WOULD
BE HELPFUL TO VISUALIZE TWO PHONE NUMBERS (LINES) JUST FLOATING AROUND IN THE
TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE (CO).  NOW, IF YOU (AND A FRIEND PERHAPS) WERE TO CALL
THESE TWO NUMBERS AT THE SAME TIME, POOOOPFFF!!!, YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED
TOGETHER.  I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OUT THERE..., "BIG DEAL" OR "WHY SHOULD
MA BELL COLLECT HERE TWO MSU'S (MESSAGE UNITS) FOR ONE LOUSY PHONE CALL!?"
WELL... THINK AGAIN.  HAVEN'T YOU EVER WANTED SOMEONE TO CALL YOU BACK BUT,
WERE RELUCTANT TO GIVE OUT YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER (LIKE THE LAST TIME YOU
TRIED TO GET YOUR  FRIEND'S UNLISTED # FROM THE BUSINESS OFFFICE)?  OR HOW
ABOUT A COLLECT CALL TO YOUR FRIEND WAITING ON A LOOP, WHO WILL GLADLY ACCEPT
THE CHARGES?  OR BETTER YET, STUMBLING UPON A LOOP THAT YOU DISCOVER THAT HAS
MULTI-USER CAPABILITY (FOR THOSE LATE-NIGHT CONFERENCES).  BEST OF ALL IS
FINDING A NON-SUPERVISED LOOP THAT DOESN'T CHARGE ANY MSU'S OR TOLLS TO ONE
OR BOTH PARTIES.  EXAMPLE:  MANY MOONS AGO, A LOOP AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS
'THE 332 LOOP' WAS NON-SUP (IE, NONSUPERVISED) ON THE TONE SIDE.  I HAD MY
FRIEND IN CALIFORNIA DIAL THE FREE (NON-SUP) SIDE, (212) 332-9906 AND I
DIALED THE SIDE THAT CHARGED, 332-9900.  AS YOU CAN SEE, I WAS CHARGED ONE
MSU, AND MY FRIEND WAS CHARGED ZILCH, FOR AS LONG AS WE WISHED TO TALK!!!"

*****

AHHH...HAVE I PERKED YOUR INTEREST YET?  IF SO, HERE IS HOW TO FIND A LOOP OF
YOU VERY OWN.  FIRST, DO ALL OF YOU LOOP SEARCHING AT NIGHT!  THIS IS BECAUSE
THE LOOPS SERVE A GENUINE TEST FUNCTION WHICH TELCO USES DURING THE DAY.  (WE
DON'T WANT TO RUN INTO AN IRATE LINEMAN NOW, DO WE?)  TO FIND A LOOP, HAVING
2 #'S IS A DEFINITE PLUS.  IF NOT, HAVE A FRIEND TO DIAL #'S AT HIS LOCATION.
 LAST RESORT, TRY DIALING FROM TWO ADJACENT PAY PHONES.  NOW GET YOUR TRUSTY
WHITE PAGES (*), AND TURN TO THE PAGE WHERE IT LISTS THE # OF MSU'S FROM YOUR
EXCHANGE (OR EXCHANGES IN YOUR PRIMARY CALLING AREA) THE IDEA IS TO FIND A
LOOP THAT IS WITHIN YOUR PRIMARY CALLING AREA OR IS ONLY 1 MSU IN YOUR AREA 
(CALL AREA A).  THIS IS SO YOU DON'T GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO FIND A LOOP. 
WRITE DOWN ALL OF THESE EXCHANGES AND DO A 99XX SCAN OF THOSE EXCHANGES (99XX
SCANNING WILL BE DISCUSSED SHORTLY).

BEFORE WE GET UP TO 99XX SCANNING, WE WILL LOOK AT SOME OTHER LOOP INFO:
LOOPS ARE FOUND PAIRS WHICH ARE USUALLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN
NPA 212, WHERE THE INFAMOUS LOOPS ARE FOUND, THERE IS A STANDARD LOOP FORMAT:

MANHATTAN & BRONX-------NNX-9977/9979 BROOKLYN & QUEENS-------NNX-9900/9906

NNX IS THE EXCHANGE TO BE SCANNED. HERE ARE SOME LOOPS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND
IN NYC.  THESE ARE USED MOSTLY BY PHREAKS AND CALL-IN LINES FOR PIRATE RADIO
STATIONS:
212-220-9900/9906
212-283-9977/9979
212-352-9900/9906
212-365-9977/9979
212-529-9900/9906
212-562-9977/9979
212-982-9977/9979
212-986-9977/9979

THE LOWER # IS THE TONE SIDE (SINGING SWITCH).  THE HIGHER # IS ALWAYS SILENT
.  THE TONE DISAPPEARS ON THE LOWER # WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS IN THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE LOOP.  IF YOU ARE ON THE HIGHER #, YOU'LL HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE CLICKS
TO SEE IF SOMEBODY DIALED-IN.  THE NYC 982 & 986 LOOPS ARE DIFFERENT FROM
OTHERS. USUALLY WHEN YOU PARK ON A LOOP, YOU WILL HEAR WHO EVER CALLS IN ON
THE OTHER HALF.  WHEN THEY'RE DONE, THE NEXT CALLER (IF ANY) WILL BE QUEUED
IN, ONE AFTER ANOTHER.  ON THE NYC 982 & 986, YOU SOMETIMES CAN'T GET ANY
MORE CALLERS IN AFTER THE FIRST.  FURTHERMORE, IF YOU PARK ONE OF THESE LOOPS
AND THERE IS NOBODY ON THE OTHER END FOR MORE THAN 4 MINUTES, YOU MAY BE
AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTED.  THESE LOOPS ARE GOOD FOR BACK-UP PURPOSES WHEN
ALL OTHER LOOPS ARE BUSY.


99XX SCANNING: --------------
MOST EVERY EXCHANGE IN THE BELL SYSTEM HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF TEST #'S AND
OTHER "GOODIES," SUCH AS LOOPS.

THESE "GOODIES" ARE USUALLY FOUND BETWEEN 9900 AND 9999 IN YOUR LOCAL
EXCHANGE.  IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND INITIATIVE, SCAN YOUR EXCHANGE AND YOU
MAY BECOME LUCKY!

HERE ARE MY FINDINGS IN THE 914-268:
9901 - VERIFICATION (RECORDING OF A/C AND EXCHANGE)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CO
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CO
9941 - CARRIER
9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP)
9963 - TONE (STOPS:  MUTED)
9966 - CARRIER
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN
       TOUCH-TONE KEYS

MOST OF THE #'S BETWEEN 9900 & 9999 WILL RING, BE BUSY, GO TO A SPECIAL
INTERCEPT OPERATOR ("WHAT #, PLEASE?") , OR WILL GO TO A "THE # YOU HAVE
REACHED..." RECORDING.  WHAT YOU FIND DEPENDS UPON THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT IN
THE EXCHANGE AND THE TELCO OPERATING COMPANY.

WHEN SEARCHING FOR LOOPS, YOU MAY FIND ONE OF THE FOLLOWING POSSIBILITIES
WHEN YOU FIND ONE:

1.  YOU CAN HEAR THROUGH THE LOOP (NOT MUTED), BUT THERE
    IS A 1/2 SECOND CLICK EVERY 10 SECONDS THAT INTERRUPTS
    THE AUDIO.  THIS TYPE IS GOOD FOR BACK-UP USE BUT THE
    %$#'&" CLICK IS SUPER ANNOYING.

2.  ONE SIDE OF THE LOOP IS BUSY; TRY IT AGAIN LATER.

3.  THE TONE DISAPPEARS, BUT YOU CANNOT HEAR THROUGH IT
    (THE LOOP IS MUTED, TRY AGAIN IN A MONTH OR SO)

4.  YOU GET "THE # YOU HAVE REACHED RECORDING."  NO LOOP THERE!

MOST LOOPS ARE MUTED (#3), BUT THEIR STATUS DOES CHANGES FROM TIME-TO-TIME. 
IT ALL DEPENDS IF THE TELCO MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL REMEMBER TO "THROW THE
SWITCH", IE, TURN OFF THE LOOP.

SINCE I HAVE DONE THE ABOVE 914-268 99XX SCAN, CONGERS (268) HAS INSTALLED
NEW SWITCHING EQUIPMENT (DMS100).  SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE THE SAME, BUT I
HAVE NOTICED THAT ON THE DMS100, THE RECORDINGS ARE ALSO STORED IN THIS AREA.
 268-9903, 9906, 9909, & 9912 ARE ALL DIFFERENT RECORDINGS.  ALSO, THERE ARE
2 FORTRESS FONE RECORDINGS AT 268-9911 (DEPOSIT 5 CENTS OR ELSE) AND 268-9913
(DEPOSIT 10 CENTS).  NONE OF THESE RECORDINGS SUPE AND ALOT OF OTHER 99XX #'S
DON'T SUPE EITHER.

IN SOME AREAS (LIKE MD), 9906-7 IS RINGBACK.  IN WASHINGTON, THERE IS A SWEEP
TONE TEST AT (202) 560-9944.  IN NYC (212), YOU'LL FIND THE INFAMOUS LOOP
LINES (AS MENTIONED ABOVE).

IT WILL BE EASIER TO SCAN YOUR EXCHANGE IF YOU MAKE UP A CHART LIKE THE ONE
BELOW:

--------------------------------------

THIS LEAVES YOU WITH 100 BOXES (1 FOR EACH # BETWEEN 9900 & 9999).  YOU
SHOULD MAKE YOUR BOXES BIG ENOUGH SO YOU CAN WRITE SOME SORT OF SHORTHAND IN
THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE:

B - BUSY   (TRY AGAIN AT ANOTHER TIME)
R - RINGS  (TRY AGAIN AT ANOTHER TIME)
O - INTERCEPT OPERATOR ("WHAT # YOU CALLING?)
R1- RECORDING 1 (MAKE A MARGIN NOTE OF THE TYPES OF REORDINGS 
    YOU GET)
T - TONE   ] TONE AT A LOWER # + IGNORE
I - IGNORE ] AT A HIGHER # = LOOP
V - VOICE # TO TELCO CO - THEY USUALLY ANSWER WITH THE
    CITY NAME OR AREA.
C - CARRIER

THERE WILL BE OTHERS AND YOU SHOULD USE OTHER CHARACTERS THAT YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND.  NOW, BACK TO LOOPS!  AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IN MY 914-268 SCAN,
I FOUND A MUTED LOOP AND A TONE SIDE.  914-268 FAILED TO COME UP WITH THE
SILENT SIDE OF A LOOP!  THEREFORE, THERE IS NO LOOP IN THAT EXCHANGE.  I THEN
SCANNED ANOTHER EXCHANGE IN MY PRIMARY CALLING AREA (914-634) AND I FOUND A
LOOP!!

    (914) 634-9923/9924

SO, IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, MOVE ONTO ANOTHER EXCHANGE.

IF YOU USE THE BOX METHOD THAT I HAVE OUTLINED ABOVE, YOU WILL SEE A T & I
NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR A LOOP.

SOME EXCHANGES ARE SPECIAL.  FOR EXAMPLE, 914-623 IS A TESTING BUREAU.  IN
THIS EXCHANGE, NOT ONLY DID I FIND A LOOP, BUT I ALSO FOUND SEVERAL
INTERESTING TONES, NOISES, AND OTHER TEST FUNCTIONS.  ALSO, THE MORE
IMPORTANT THE EXCHANGE IS, THE MORE YOU WILL FIND.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 914-623,
I FOUND WELL OVER 10 VOICE #'S!

ALSO, LOOPS ARE USUALLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, FOUND IN THE 99XX SERIES.
FOR EXAMPLE:

    (713) 324-1799/1499

IS A LOOP.

THE PERFECT LOOP?  HERE IS WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR:

 1.  NON-SUP ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES.  TO CHECK FOR A NON-SUP LOOP, GO TO A TONE
-FIRST FORTRESS FONE AND DIAL THE #.  IF IT ASKS FOR A DIME, IT IS SUPERVISED
.  IF THE CALL GOES THROUGH, THEN IT IS NON-SUPED!

 2.  800 LOOPS WOULD BE A PLUS.  THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY FOUND BETWEEN 9900 
& 9999 THOUGH.  I WOULD CHECK THE 1XXX SERIES FIRST.

 3.  MULTI-USER LOOPS ARE ALSO A PLUS FOR THOSE LATE NIGHT CONFERENCES.

FINALLY, REMEMBER IT IS ONLY A LOCAL CALL TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU CO HAS IN
STORE FOR YOU.  IF YOU FIND ANYTHING INTERESTING, BE SURE TO DROP ME A LINE.


NOTE:  YOUR LOCAL WHITE PAGES CAN BE A VALUABLE ASSET.  YOU CAN ALSO ORDER
OTHER FONE BOOKS FROM YOUR BUSINESS OFFICE (USUALLY FREE FOR BOOKS WITHIN
YOUR OPERATING COMPANY'S DISTRICT).  A LARGE FONE BOOK, SUCH AS MANHATTAN,
CONTAINS MUCH MORE INFO IN THE FIRST FEW PAGES THAN OTHER BOOKS.

=====
=ANI=
=====

AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION (ANI), IS A NUMBER THAT YOU CALL UP THAT WILL
TELL YOU WHAT # YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  THIS HAS A FEW USES.  FIRST, WERE YOU
EVER SOMEWHERE AND THE FONE DIDN'T HAVE A # PRINTED ON IT?  OR PERHAPS YOU
WERE FOOLING AROUND IN SOME CANS (THOSE LARGE BOXES ON FONE POLES THAT
CONTAIN TERMINALS FOR LINEMAN USE--TO BE DISCUSSES IN A FUTURE CHAPTER.) AND
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE LINE # IS.

IN NPA 914, THE ANI IS 990.  IN NPA'S 212 & 516, ANI IS 958.  THIS VARIES
FROM AREA TO AREA.  HERE ARE SOME OTHER ANI'S THAT I HAVE SEEN:

890-751-5191 2022222222 1-XXX-1111  (IN SOME 914 AREAS, ESP.
             UNDER STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING EQUIPMENT, YOU
             WILL HAVE TO DIAL 1-990-1111)
                   TO FIND ANI FOR OTHER AREAS, CHECK 3 DIGITS #'S FIRST,
USUALLY IN THE 9XX SERIES (EXCLUDING 911).  IN AREAS UNDER STEP-BY-STEP (TO
BE DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT PART), TRY 1-9XX-1111.  ANI MAY ALSO BE IN 99XX. 
LAST RESORT, TRY TO GET FRIENDLY WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS FOR THE FONE
COMPANY.


RINGBACK: ---------

RINGBACK, AS ITS NAME IMPLIES, CALLS BACK THE # YOU ARE AT WHEN YOU DIAL THE
RINGBACK #.

RINGBACK, IN NPA 914, IS 660.  YOU DIAL 660+THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF THE FONE. 
YOU WILL THEN GET A TONE, HANG-UP QUICKLY AND PICK-UP IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS. 
YOU WILL THEN GET A SECOND TONE, HANG-UP AGAIN AND THE FONE WILL RING.  IN
NYC, IT IS ALSO 660, BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO PRESS 6 OR 7 BEFORE YOU HANG UP FOR
THE FIRST TIME (IE, AT THE FIRST TONE).

OTHER RINGBACK #'S THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE:

26011 - THIS 5 DIGIT FORMAT IS USED PRIMARILY ON STEP-BY-STEP.
        THE LAST 2 DIGITS (11) ARE DUMMY DIGITS.
890-897-XXXX - XXXX ARE THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF THE FONE #.

119911/11911/1199911 - GTE

NNX-9906/9907 - NPA 301, NNX IS THE EXCHANGE


THE REASON YOU GET THE TONE WHEN YOU PICK-UP AFTER IT RINGS IS BECAUSE IN
SOME AREAS, PEOPLE WERE USING RINGBACK AS AN IN-HOUSE INTERCOM.  THEY WOULD
DIAL RINGBACK, AND WHEN IT STOPPED RINGING, THEY WOULD PICK-UP & TALK WITH
THE PERSON WHO PICKED UP THE OTHER EXTENSION.  BELL DIDN'T LIKE THIS SINCE
THERE IS USUALLY ONLY 1 PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN EACH EXCHANGE THAT DOES THE
RINGBACK.  WHEN PEOPLE USED THIS AS AN INTERCOM, LINEMEN & REPAIRMEN COULN'T
GET THROUGH!  IN SOME AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER STEP-BY-STEP, RINGBACK
CAN STILL BE USED AS AN INTERCOM.  ALSO, UNDER STEP-BY-STEP, THE RINGBACK
PROCEDURE IT USUALLY SIMPLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN ONE AREA YOU WOULD DIAL 26011
AND HANG-UP; IT WOULD THEN RINGBACK.

TOUCH-TONE TEST:
----------------

IN AREAS THAT HAVE A TOUCH-TONE TEST, YOU DIAL THE RINGBACK #.  AT THE FIRST
TONE, YOU TOUCH-TONE DIGITS 1-0.  IF THEY ARE CORRECT IT WILL BEEP TWICE.

I HAVE ALSO SEEN A TT TEST IN SOME AREAS AT:  890-751-5191

COMING SOON: ------------

IN THE NEXT PART, WE WILL LOOK AT VARIOUS SWITCHING EQUIPMENT AND THE NETWORK.


BREAK UP OF BELL: -----------------

THE OPERATING COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE ALL THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT
AROUND.  WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES, MOST OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED
HERE WILL REMAIN PERTINENT AFTER JANUARY 1, 1984.
JUST SUBSTITUTE THE WORD "FONE NETWORK" FOR BELL SYSTEM.
