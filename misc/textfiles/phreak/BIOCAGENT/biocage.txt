Slipped,
 
If you continue to have problems uploading [^] those songs, you may want to try
one of the following:
 
     [1] Send them via MCI Mail to username:  BIOC
 
     [2] It is possible that a transfer could be arranged using AE Pro or Disk-
         fer with the Apple.  A Christensen protocol may also be possible on
         machines other than the Apple.
 
As for "the age of BIOC," then non-phreaking related subversive group that I 
belong to called "BIOC" has been around for 5 years.  I am one of the few 
active "computer people" in the group.  If you are referring to my age, well,
I'd rather not say but it's somewhere between 16 & 18...
