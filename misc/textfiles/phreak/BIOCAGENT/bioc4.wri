PREFACE:
--------

   PART IV WILL DEAL WITH THE VARIOUS TYPES OF OPERATORS, OFFICE HIERARCHY, &
SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.

OPERATORS:
----------

   THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF OPERATORS IN THE NETWORK AND THE MORE COMMON ONES
WILL BE DISCUSSED. 
TSPS OPERATOR:
--------------
   THE TSPS (TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITION SYSTEM) OPERATOR IS PROBABLY THE BITCH 
(OR BASTARD FOR THE PHEMALE LIBASTARD EQUIPEMENT FAILURES OR IF THE OFFICE IS
NOT EQUIPPED FOR CAMA (MOST ARE).

<I ONCE HAD AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE HAPPEN TO ME & THE TSPS OPERATOR CAME ON AND
SAID, "WHAT # ARE YOU CALLING FROM?"  OUT OF CURIOSITY, I GAVE HER THE # TO
MY CO, SHE THANKED ME & THEN I WAS CONNECTED TO A CONVERSION THAT APPEARED TO
BE BETWEEN A FRAMEMAN & HIS WIFE.  THEN IT STARTED RINGING THE PARTY I
ORIGINALLY WANTED TO CALL & EVERYONE PHREAKED OUT (EXCUSE THE PUN).  I
IMMEDIATELY DROPPED THIS DUAL LINE CONFERENCE!> YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH THE
TSPS OPERATOR SINCE SHE KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  SHE ALSO KNOWS
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE AT A FORTRESS FONE & SHE CAN TRACE CALLS QUITE READILY
.  OUT OF ALL THE OPERATORS, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS.

INWARD OPERATOR:
----------------

   THIS OPERATOR ASSISTS YOUR LOCAL TSPS ("O") OPERATOR IN CONNECTING CALLS. 
SHE WILL NEVER QUESTION A CALL AS LONG AS THE CALL IS WITHIN HER SERVICE AREA
.  SHE CAN ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER OPERATORS OR BY A BLUE BOX.  FROM A BB,
YOU WOULD DIAL KP+NPA+121+ST FOR THE INWARD OPERATOR THAT WILL HELP YOU
CONNECT ANY CALLS WITHIN THAT NPA AREA ONLY.  (BLUE BOXING WILL BE DISCUSSED
IN A FUTURE PART OF BASIC TELCOM)

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OPERATOR:
------------------------------

   THIS IS THE OPERATOR THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WHEN YOU DIAL:  411 OR NPA
-555-1212.  SHE DOES NOT READILY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  SHE DOES
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO UNLISTED #'S, BUT SHE DOES KNOW IF AN UNLISTED # EXISTS
FOR A CERTAIN LISTING.

   THERE IS ALSO A DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR DEAF PEOPLE WHO USE
TELETYPEWRITERS IF YOU MODEM CAN TRANSFER BAUDOT (THE APPLE CAT CAN), THEN
YOU CAN CALL HER UP AND HAVE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH HER.  THE # IS:
 800- 855-1155.  SHE USES THE STANDARD TELEX ABBREVIATIONS SUCH AS GA FOR GO
AHEAD.  THEY TEND TO BE NICER & WILL TALK LONGER THAN YOUR REGULAR OPERATORS.
 ALSO, THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE INTO BEING TALKED OUT OF INFORMATION THROUGH
THE PROCESS OF "SOCIAL ENGINEERING" AS CHESHIRE CATALYST WOULD PUT IT.

   OTHER OPERATORS HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR OWN DA BY DIALING KP+NPA+131+ST (MF).

   THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THIS TUTORIAL, BUT MANY TELCO'S ARE
NOW CHARGING FOR CALLS TO DIR. ASST.  YOU CAN BEAT THIS BY:

(1) COUNT HOW MANY CALLS YOU MAKE TO DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE IN A BILLING PERIOD
.  GO TO A FORTRESS FONE & DIAL DA.  WHEN THE OPERATOR COMES ON, GIVE HER A
NAME THAT YOU KNOW HAS AN UNLISTED # OR ASK FOR A TOWN THAT ISN'T IN THE NPA.
 SHE WILL THEN ASK FOR YOUR # SO SHE CAN CREDIT THE CALL TO YOU.  GIVE HER
YOUR HOME #; SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE MAKING A FREE CALL FROM THE
FORTRESS.  JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T CREDIT YOURSELF FOR MORE CALLS THAN
YOU ACTUALLY MADE OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS!

(2) IF YOU HAVE A BAUDOT TERMINAL, USE THE 800 #; IT'S FREE & THERE IS ONE #
FOR ALL REQUESTS.

C/NA OPERATORS:
---------------

   C/NA OPERATORS ARE OPERATORS THAT DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT
DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OPERATORS ARE FOR.  SEE PART II, FOR MORE INFO ON C/NA &
#'S.  IN MY EXPERIENCES, THESE OPERATORS KNOW MORE THAN THE DA OP'S DO & THEY
ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO "SOCIAL ENGINEERING." IT IS POSSIBLE TO BULLSHIT A C
/NA OPERATOR FOR THE NON-PUB DA # (IE, YOU GIVE THEM THE NAME & THEY GIVE YOU
THE UNLISTED #).  THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ASSUME YOUR ARE A PHELLOW
COMPANY EMPLOYEE.

INTERCEPT OPERATOR:
-------------------

   THE INTERCEPT OPERATOR IS THE ONE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WHEN THERE ARE
NOT ENOUGH RECORDINGS AVAILABLE TO TELL YOU THAT THE # HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED
OR CHANGED.  SHE USUALLY SAYS, "WHAT # YOU CALLIN'?" WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT. 
THIS IS THE LOWEST OPERATOR LIFEFORM.  EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
ARE CALLING FROM, IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME TO TRY TO VERBALLY ABUSE THEM
SINCE THEY USUALLY UNDERSTAND VERY LITTLE ENGLISH.

OTHER OPERATORS:
----------------

   AND THEN THERE ARE THE:  MOBILE, SHIP-TO-SHORE, CONFERENCE, MARINE VERIFY,
"LEAVE WORD & CALL BACK," ROUT & RATE (KP+NPA+141+ST), & OTHER SPECIAL
OPERATORS WHO HAVE ONE PURPOSE OR ANOTHER IN THE NETWORK.

   PROBLEMS WITH AN OPERATOR?  ASK TO SPEAK TO THEIR SUPERVISOR... WHICH IS
THE EQUIVALENT OF THE MADAME IN A WHOREHOUSE (IF YOU WILL EXCUSE THE ANALOGY).

   BY THE WAY, SOME CO'S THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DIAL A 1 OR 0 AS THE 4TH
DIGIT, WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO CALL SPECIAL OPERATORS WITHOUT A BLUE BOX. 
THIS IS VERY RARE THOUGH!  FOR EXAMPLE, 212-121-1111 WILL GET YOU A NY INWARD
OPERATOR.


==================
=OFFICE HIERARCHY=
==================


   EVERY SWITCHING OFFICE OFFICE IN NORTH AMERICA (THE NPA SYSTEM), IS
ASSIGNED AN OFFICE NAME & CLASS.  THERE ARE FIVE CLASSES OF OFFICES NUMBERED
1 THROUGH 5.  YOUR CO IS MOST LIKELY A CLASS 5 OR END OFFICE.  ALL LONG
-DISTANCE (TOLL) CALLS ARE SWITCHED BY A TOLL OFFICE WHICH CAN BE A CLASS 4,
3, 2, OR 1 OFFICE.  THERE IS ALSO A 4X OFFICE CALLED AN INTERMEDIATE POINT. 
THE 4X OFFICE IS A DIGITAL ONE THAT CAN HAVE AN UNATTENDED EXCHANGE ATTACHED
TO IT (KNOWN AS A REMOTE SWITCHING UNIT-RSU).

   THE FOLLOWING CHART WILL LIST THE OFFICE #, NAME, & HOW MANY OF THOSE
OFFICES EXISTED IN NORTH AMERICA IN 1981.

CLASS       NAME       ABB  # EXISTING
----- ---------------- --- ------------
  1   REGIONAL CENTER  RC         12
  2   SECTIONAL CENTER SC         67
  3   PRIMARY CENTER   PC        230
  4   TOLL CENTER      TC      1,300
  4P  TOLL POINT       TP
  4X  INTERMEDIATE PT  IP
  5   END OFFICE       EO     19,000
  R   RSU              RSU

   WHEN CONNECTING A CALL FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER, THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT
USUALLY TRIES TO FIND THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF
THE CALLER & THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF THE CALLED PARTY.  IF NO INTER-OFFICE
TRUNKS EXIST BETWEEN THE 2 PARTIES, IT WILL THEN MOVE UPTO THE NEXT HIGHEST
OFFICE FOR SERVICING (CLASS 4).  IF THE CLASS 4 OFFICE CANNOT HANDLE THE CALL
BY SENDING IT TO ANOTHER CLASS 4 OR 5 OFFICE, IT WILL BE SENT TO THE NEXT
OFFICE IN THE HIERARCHY (3).  THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT FIRST USES THE HIGH
-USAGE INTEROFFICE TRUNK GROUPS, IF THEY ARE BUSY IT THEN GOES TO THE FINAL
TRUNK GROUPS ON THE NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL.  IF THE CALL CANNOT BE CONNECTED THEN
, YOU WILL PROBABLY GET A RE-ORDER (120IPM BUSY SIGNAL) SIGNAL.  AT THIS TIME
, THE GUYS AT NETWORK OPERATIONS ARE PROBABLY SHITTING IN THEIR PANTS AND
TRYING TO AVOID THE DREADED NETWORK DREADLOCK (AS SEEN ON TV!).

   IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT 9 CONNECTIONS IN TANDEM IS CALLED RING
-AROUND-THE ROSY AND IT HAS NEVER OCCURRED IN TELEPHONE HISTORY.  THIS WOULD
CASE AN ENDLESS LOOP CONNECTION.

[ A NEAT WAY TO REALLY SCREW-UP THE NETWORK]

   THE 10 REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE US & THE 2 IN CANADA ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED
.  THEY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE ENTIRE TELEPHONE NETWORK.  SINCE THERE ARE
ONLY 12 OF THEM, THEY ARE LISTED BELOW:

CLASS 1 REGIONAL OFFICE LOCATION    NPA

NOT BE VIEWED AS I INTENDED THEM IF YOU ARE NOT USING AS LOWER CASE TERMINAL.


=====================
=SWITCHING EQUIPMENT=
=====================


   IN THE NETWORK, THERE ARE 3 MAJOR TYPES OF SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.  THEY ARE
KNOWN AS:  STEP, CROSSBAR, & ESS.

STEP-BY-STEP (SXS)

   THE STEP-BY-STEP, A/K/A THE STROWGER SWITCH OR TWO-MOTION SWITCH, WAS
INVENTED IN 1889 BY AN UNDERTAKER NAMED ALMON STROWGER.  HE INVENTED THIS
MECHANICAL SWITCHING EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THE FELT THAT THE BIASED OPERATOR WAS
ROUTING ALL REQUESTS FOR AN 'UNDERTAKER' TO HER HUSBAND'S BUSINESS.

   BELL STARTED USING THIS SYSTEM IN 1918 & AS OF 1978, OVER 53% OF THE BELL
EXCHANGES USED THIS METHOD OF SWITCHING.

   STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING IS CONTROLLED DIRECTLY BY THE DIAL PULSES WHICH
MOVE A SERIES OF SWITCHES (CALLED THE SWITCH TRAIN) IN ORDER.  WHEN YOU FIRST
PICK UP THE FONE UNDER SXS, A LINEFINDER
ACKNOWLEDGES THE REQUEST (SOONER OR LATER) BY SENDING A DIAL TONE.  IF YOU
THEN DIALED 1234, THE ESUIPMENT WOULD FIRST FIND AN IDLE SELECTOR SWITCH.  IT
WOULD THEN MOVE VERTICALLY 1 PULSE, IT WOULD THEN MOVE HORIZONTALLY TO FIND A
FREE SECOND SELECTOR, IT WOULD THEN MOVE 2 VERTICAL PULSES, STEP HORIZONTALLY
TO FIND THE NEXT SELECTOR, ETC.  THUS THE FIRST SWITCH IN THE TRAIN TAKES NO
DIGITS, THE SECOND SWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, THE THIRD SWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, &
THE LAST SWITCH IN THE TRAIN (CALLED THE CONNECTOR) TAKES THE LAST 2 DIGITS &
CONNECTS YOUR CALLS.  A NORMAL (10,000 LINE) EXCHANGE REQUIRES 4 DIGITS (0000
-9999) TO CONNECT A LOCAL CALL & THUS IT TAKES 4 SWITCHES TO CONNECT EVERY
CALL (LINEFINDER, 1ST & 2ND SELECTORS, & THE CONNECTOR) .

   WHILE IT WAS THE FIRST, SXS SUCKS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

[1] THE SWITCHED OFTEN BECOME JAMMED THUS THE CALLS OFTEN BECOME BLOCKED.

[2] YOU CAN'T USE DTMF (DUAL-TONE MULTI-FREQUENCY A/K/A TOUCH-TONE) DIRECTLY.
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TELCO MAY HAVE INSTALLED A CONVERSION KIT BUT THEN
THE CALLS WILL GO THROUGH JUST AS SLOW AS PULSE, ANYWAY!

[3] THEY USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY & MECHANICAL MAINTENANCE. (BAD FROM TELCO
POINT OF VIEW)

[4] EVERYTHING IS HARDWIRED.  THEY CAN STILL HOOK UP PEN REGISTERS & OTHER
SHIT ON THE LINE SO IT IS NOT EXACTLY A PHREAK HAVEN.  YOU CAN IDENTIFY SXS
OFFICES BY:

(A) LACK OF DTMF OR PULSING DIGITS AFTER DIALING DTMF.

(B) IF YOU GO NEAR THE CO, IT WILL SOUND LIKE A TYPEWRITER TESTING FACTORY.

(C) LACK OF SPEED CALLING, CALL FORWARDING, & OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICES.

(D) FORTRESS FONES THAT WANT YOUR MONEY FIRST (AS OPPOSED TO DIAL TONE FIRST
ONES).

   THE PRECEDING DON'T NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT YOU HAVE SXS BUT THEY SURELY
GIVE EVIDENCE THAT IT MIGHT BE.  ALSO, IF ANY OF THE ABOVE CHARACTERISTICS
EXIST, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T ESS!  ALSO, SXS HAVE PRETTY MUCH BEEN ERADICATED
FROM LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS NYC (212).

CROSSBAR:
---------

   THERE ARE 3 MAJOR TYPES OF CROSSBAR SYSTEMS CALLED:  NO. 1 CROSSBAR (1XB)
,NO. 4 CROSSBAR (4XB), & NO. 5 CROSSBAR (5XB).  5XB HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY END
OFFICE SWITCH OF BELL SINCE THE 60'S AND THUS IT IS IN WIDE-USE.

   CROSSBAR USES A COMMON CONTROL SWITCHING METHOD.  WHEN THERE IS AN
INCOMING CALL, A STORED PROGRAM DETERMINES ITS ROUTE THROUGH THE SWITCHING
MATRIX.

   IN CROSSBAR, THE BASIC OPERATION PRINCIPLE IS THAT A HORIZONTAL & A
VERTICAL LINE ARE ENERGIZED IN A MATRIX KNOWN AS THE CROSSPOINT MATRIX.  THE
POINT WHERE THESE 2 LINES MEET IN THE MATRIX IS THE CONNECTION.


+===+
=ESS=
+===+

   ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM (ESS) THE PHREAK'S NIGHTMARE COME TRUE (OR
ORWELL'S PROPHECY AS 2600 PUTS IT)

   ESS IS BELL'S MOVE TOWARDS THE AIRSTRIP ONE SOCIETY DEPICTED IN ORWELL'S
1984.  WITH ESS, EVERY SINGLE DIGIT THAT YOU DIAL IS RECORDED--EVEN IF IT IS
A MISTAKE.  THEY KNOW WHO YOU CALL, WHEN YOU CALL, HOW LONG YOU TALKED FOR, &
PROBABLY WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT (IN SOME CASES).  ESS CAN (AND IS) ALSO
PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT #'S OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO 800 #'S OR
DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE.  THIS IS CALLED THE "800 EXCEPTIONAL CALLING REPORT." 
ESS COULD ALSO BE PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT LOGS OF WHO CALLS CERTAIN #'S--LIKE
A BOOKIE, A KNOWN COMMUNIST, A BBS, ETC THE THING TO REMEMBER WITH ESS IS
THAT IT IS A SERIES OF PROGRAMS WORKING TOGETHER.  THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE VERY
EASILY CHANGED TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO DO.  ONE PHREAK WHOM I KNOW HAS
SOOE ESS SOURCE CODE LISTING WHICH IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX (AS WELL AS
DOCUMENTED--GRACIAS DIOS).  THIS SYSTEM MAKES THE JOB OF BELL SECURITY, THE
FBI, NSA, & OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT LIKE TO INVADE PRIVACY INCREDIBLY EASY.

   WITH ESS, TRACING IS DONE IN MICROSECONDS (EINE AUGENBLICK) & THE RESULTS
ARE PRINTED AT THE CONSOLE OF A BELL GESTAPO OFFICER.  ESS WILL ALSO PICK UP
ANY "FOREIGN" TONES ON THE LINE SUCH AS 2600 HZ!

   BELL PREDICTS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL BECOME TOTALLY ESS BY THE 1990'S.

   YOU CAN IDENTIFY ESS BY THE FOLLOWING WHICH ARE USUALLY ESS FUNCTIONS:

[1] DIALING 911 FOR HELP.

[2] DIAL-TONE-FIRST FORTRESSES.

[3] CUSTOM CALLING SERVICES SUCH AS:  CALL FORWARDING, SPEED DIALING, & CALL
WAITING.  (ASK YOUR BUSINESS OFFICE IF YOU CAN GET THESE.)

[4] ANI (AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION) ON LD CALLS.

   PHREAKING DOES NOT COME TO A COMPLETE HALT UNDER ESS THOUGH--JUST BE VERY
CAREFUL, THOUGH!!!

   DUE TO THE FACT THAT ESS SENDS A COMPUTER GENERATED "ARTIFICIAL RING,"
WHERE THE VOICE IS NOT CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE CALLED PARTIES LINE UNTIL HE
PICKS UP, BLACK BOXES & INFINITY TRANSMITTERS WILL NOT WORK!

*** NOTE:  ANOTHER INTERESTING WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT YOU ARE
ON IS TO RAID THE TRASH CAN OF YOU LOCAL CO--THIS ART WILL DISCUSSED IN A
SEPARATE ARTICLE SOON.

COMING SOON:
------------

   IN THE PART V, WE WILL START TO TAKE A LOOK AT TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.
