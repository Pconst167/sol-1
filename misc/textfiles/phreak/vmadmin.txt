SDX? MessageBase? No, the term you're all looking for is: Voice Manager
System

Most people in the uk scene have been talking about PBX`s for a long time
now. Perhaps the most talked about is the SDX or the Messagebase (same
thing). Until now, some sceners have used them, some lamers have abused
them but no one (in my knowledge) has actually mastered the administration
of the system. BUT, that all changed in the last two hours or so. After
installing a phone from the nextdoor neighbours line, and after many
frustrating times with an accoustic coupler and a 1-2-1, i decided to start
randomly scanning 0800`s for pbx`s. After 3 tries, i stumbled on a nice
little system begging to be hacked. While scanning for the 3 digit box
numbers and passwords for about a half hour, i got into a mailbox. Thebox
seemed normal at first with all the primary functions you would find inany
other system of the same kind. This all changed when i started using the
automatic call handling function. Instead of getting the droning female
voice, i was prompted to enter my password. I did so and was then
confronted with list of functions. i dictated all the options to psyclone
and we then tried them all one by one. In short, we had hacked an admin
box!
