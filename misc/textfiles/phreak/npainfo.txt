From Mod.telecom on the USENET


New England Telephone has announced that NPA617 (Eastern Mass.) is 
being split, with the area outside (inner) Metro Boston and some of
the South Shore being moved into the new NPA508.  Joy of joys for
the affected!  Worcester, Lowell, Maynard and New Bedford all get
a new area code, along with suburbs like Framingham and Concord.
Yet the Western Mass. NPA413 is practically empty.  (Who drew the
original lines?!?)

In the meantime, the ISDN Standards Committee T1D1 (which I'm on)
has faced the question of how to set up a numbering plan for North
America, based on extending the present plan to include non-local
exchange ISDNs?  For example, Telenet wants their own NXX codes.
Bellcore has offered them an area code, but from the "interchangeable" 
range (like  "552"), so it won't be dialable from telephones until
we prepare to run out of current-style area codes.

If we give the other carriers NXX codes, some area codes may exhaust
earlier.  That will, of course, force the rest of the network to
catch up and go to universal 1+ dialing before the presently-estimated
1995 date.

This got me thinking:  How close to full up are the NPAs?  So I hacked
the following together based upon the V&H tape used for billing.
Sorry I couldn't make it multi-column or get states listed.  This
may be a clue as to which codes split next.  (I've added my own comments.)
