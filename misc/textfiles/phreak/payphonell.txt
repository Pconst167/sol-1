     Most of you have seen WarGames, right? Remember the part where David
was stranded in Colorado and needed to call his girlfriend in Seattle? We
knew you did.  If you didn't, what David done was unscrew the  mouthpiece
on  the payphone and make some connection between the mouthpiece and  the
phone.  Well... that was pretty close to reality except for two things...
1> Nowadays,  mouthpieces are un-unscrewable, and 2> You cannot make long
distance  or toll calls using that method.  Maybe that DID work on  older
phones, but you know Ma Bell.  She always has a damn cure for every thing
us Phreaks do.  She glued on the mouthpiece!

     Now to make free local calls, you need a  finishing nail.  We highly
recommend "6D E.G. FINISH C/H, 2 INCH" nails.  These are about 3/32 of an
inch  in diameter and 2 inches long (of course).  You also need  a  large
size  paper  clip.  By  large  we  mean they  are  about  2  inches  long
(FOLDED).  Then  you  unfold the paper clip.  Unfold it  by  taking  each
piece  and  moving  it out 90 degrees.  When it is done  it  should  look
somewhat like this:
                             /----------\
                             :          :
                             :          :
                             :          :
                             :          :
                             \-----

     Now,  on to the neat stuff.  What you do,  instead of unscrewing the
glued-on  mouthpiece,  is  insert the nail into the center  hole  of  the
mouthpiece  (where you talk) and push it in with pressure or just  hammer
it in by hitting the nail on something.  Just DON'T KILL THE  MOUTHPIECE!
You  could  damage  it if you insert the nail too far or  at  some  weird
angle.  If  this happens then the other party won't be able to hear  what
you say.
     You now have a hole in the mouthpiece in which you can easily insert
the  paper clip.  So, take out the nail and put in the paper  clip.  Then
take  the other end of the paper clip and shove it under the rubber  cord
protector at the bottom of the handset (you know, the blue guy...).  This
should end up looking remotely like...like this:

                             /----------\      Mouthpiece
                             :          :      /
             Paper clip -->  :          :     /
                             :      /---:---\
                             :      :   :   :------------>
         ====================\---))):       :  To earpiece ->
                   ^              ^ \-------------------->
                   :              :
                   :              :
                 Cord          Blue guy

(The  paper clip is shoved under the blue guy to make a  good  connection
between the inside of the mouthpiece and the metal cord.)

     Now,  dial  the number of a local number you wish to  call,  sayyyy,
MCI.  If  everything  goes okay, it should ring and not answer  with  the
"The Call You Have Made Requires a 20 Cent Deposit" recording.  After the
other  end  answers  the phone, remove the  paper  clip.  It's  all  that
simple, see?

     There  are  a couple problems,  however.  One  is,  as  we mentioned
earlier, the mouthpiece not working after you punch it.  If this  happens
to you,  simply move on to the next payphone.  The one you are now on  is
lost.  Another problem is that the touch tones won't work when the  paper
clip is in the mouthpiece. There are two ways around this..
     A> Dial the first 6 numbers.  This should be done without the  paper
clip making the connection, i.e., one side should not be connected.  Then
connect  the paper clip,  hold down the last digit,  and slowly pull  the
paper clip out at the mouthpiece's end.
     B> Don't  use  the paper clip at all.  Keep the nail  in  after  you
punch it.  Dial the first 6 digits.  Before dialing the last digit, touch
the nail head to the plate on the main body of the phone,  the money safe
thingy..then press the last number.

     The  reason  that this method is sometimes called  clear  boxing  is
because  there is another type of phone which lets you actually make  the
call  and  listen  to  them say "Hello,  hello?"  but  it  cuts  off  the
mouthpiece  so  they can't hear you.  The Clear Box is used  on  that  to
amplify your voice signals and send it through the earpiece.  If you  see
how  this  is even slightly similar to the method we  just  described  up
there, kindly explain it to US!! Cause WE don't GET IT!

     Anyways,  this DOES work on almost all single slot,  Dial Tone First
payphones (Pacific Bell for sure).  We do it all the time.  This  is  the
least,  WE STRESS *LEAST*, risky form of Phreaking.  And remember.  There
are other Phreaks like you out there who have read this article and punch
payphones, so look before you punch, and save time.

your quarter back from the 0perator,  tell us!!  Post it on Looney!!  Oh,
