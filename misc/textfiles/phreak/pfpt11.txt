                   PHREAK TOOLS VERSION 1.1 RELEASED 5/15/89

     This is release 1.1 of Professor Falken's Phreak Tools.  This program
contains five vital programs to an inspiring phreak.  I will attempt to
explain how they each one of them work now.  If you get lost I suggest you
consult your local bulletin board/sysop.  This program takes 110k of memory
or so if you have 256k I suggest you scrap the idea of running this.


When you load up the program you will get a screen with 6 options. Those
options are 1>800 Exchange Directory, 2>900 Exchange Directory, 3>Automated
CNA/CNL & Authorization Code Finder, 4>Areacode -TO- State Finder, 5> State
-TO- Areacode Finder, and 6>Quit.


------------------ [800] Exchange Series Reverse Directory -------------------

     The 800 exchange is composed of many exchanges ranging from 202 up to
999.   There are a total of 409 operational exchanges at this moment in the
800 WATS directory.  To use my program what you do is tell the program what
exchange is in question, then the program will tell you who owns the exchange,
and from that you should be able to tell if they have a higher lifeform of
tracing computers.  An example would be: You have a PBX you just scanned out
and your not sure if its a safe exchange. The PBX number is [800] 877-4646.
So you enter 877 into the programs prompt and it will output: U.S. Telecom
(SPRINT).  This is real easy if you have a brain.


------------------ [900] Exchange Series Reverse Directory -------------------

     The 900 exchange is basically the same as the 800 area. Except most of
the 900 numbers are used for revenue gathering purposes.  Example- [900]
976-TITS.  The exchanges in the 900 area are owned by specific companies and
these companies sell their time to other FUCK/SUCK companies.  However, not
all 900 numbers are FUCK/SUCKS, there are a few real companies out there.
To use this program it is basically like the 800 directory.  You input the
exchange and it will output the owner.


---------------- Automated CNA/CNL & Authorization Code Finder ---------------

     This version of Automated CNA/CNL & Authorization Code is 1.2, and it
does have many DATA changes.  So if you are using CNA version 1.1 or lower,
I suggest you trash them and upgrade to this version- 1.2 If you have version
1.0 of Phreak Tools, you are running CNA/CNL version 1.1, so UPGRADE! The
Automated CNA/CNL Finder is quite easy to use if you know anything about
CNA/CNL's.  Just pick '3' from the main menu, then the program will
prompt you for the NPA you need found.  The program will then search its
massive database, then spit out the listing and authorization code needed to
access whomevers listing.  The authorization codes are courtesy of Doc
Telecom.  The authorization codes put out by the program are "CENTEL" billing
codes.  So in order to use them, you would call the CNA office, and identify
yourself as someone from CENTEL billing and my ID code is blah,blah.  A few
NPA's were left out of the previous 1.1 version.  In this version a few new
NPA's have been added, so those of you who have complained to me try again.


--------------------------- Areacode -TO- State ------------------------------

     I have found that this utility is very helpful when looking at the
location of someone quickly, while on a conference or something.  Hit '4'
at the main menu, and you will get a prompt asking you for the areacode to
be defined.  Once entered the program will tell what city area and what state
that areacode defines.

--------------------------- State -TO- Areacode ------------------------------

     This program does just the opposite of the Areacode -TO- State program.
At the main menu hit '5' and at the prompt either in ALL CAPS or ALL LOWERCASE
type in the state you need defined. At that time the program will tell the
arecodes that are included in that state and the cities they cover.

------------------------------------- Quit -----------------------------------

     Hitting '6' quits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
