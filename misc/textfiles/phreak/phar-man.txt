                             The True Story
                               BY: DOPEY
Background:

  I am sure all of you have heard the myths about Pac*Bell manholes, and
  what lies under the round cover.  There are files circulating
  suggesting that there are many treasures to be found down inside these
  manholes such as: Linemans Handsets, Laptops, Electronic Equiqment,
  Field Manuals, and the list goes on.  Well, P/HARM did a little invest-
  igating of our own, and found some interesting info.

Every couple of weeks P/HARM gets together to raise some hell.  One
weekend we were staying at Termanator's house.  We decided to go open a
manhole and see if the rumors were true.  Black Box knew someone at his
school named Ware Jerk (Rest In Peace after a motorcycle accident) who
said he had been down inside, and told us what we would need.  We had a
flashlight, a crowbar, and a car for quick getaway. After a while of
scanning for a good manhole (you can tell which ones are good because
there are big, heavy, and have a little Bell symbol on them), we located
one and proceded to open it.

Open opening it, we were very surprised. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.  First
we thought it was a fluke, so we opened another.  Same thing.  All that
was in there were a couple of big shielded cables, and some water from
the last bit of rain we received.  There were no field manuals.  There
were no handsets, nothing for the talking of P/HARM.  Being extremely
pissed off, we went to another manhole, and still found nothing.

So far, approximately ten manholes later, we still haven't found
anything interesting.  We would like you all to realize the shape the
p/h world is in today.  Everyone is in it for themselves, and that is
not how it should be.  Don't just write a file to be a dick, write
something that is true, and will help others with the cause.

Greetz to:

   Termanator (my one one and only), Master, Black Box, Masked
   Mercenary (where is that 660??), Valaraukar, Sir Joust, Ice Cube, Con
   Artist..and anyone i left out.

This file has been wirtten by P/HARM, a group of inncoent bystanders in
a world of hate.  Dont fight wars, fight war.  Be excellent to each
other. And remember, send us some money every chance you get.

P/HARM - A group with ethics and no morals (Except Termanator, hes got
         some).
