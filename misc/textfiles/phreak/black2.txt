          The following info comes from a leaflet entitled 'FREEFONE':

        "British Telecoms recent record profits and continuing appalling
        service have prompted the circulation of  this  information.  It
        comprises a method of making telephone calls free of charge."

        OPERATION:
        This circuit inhibits charging for incoming calls only.  When  a
        phone is answered, there is normally approximately 100ma DC loop
        current, but only 8ma or so is nessecary to polarise the mic  in
        the handset. Drawing  only  this  small  amount  of  current  is
        sufficient to fool BT's ancient 'Electronic Meccano'.

        Its extremely simple. When ringing, the  polarity  of  the  line
        reverses so D1 effectively answers the call when the handset  is
        lifted. When the call is established, the line polarity  reverts
        and R1 limits the loop current while D2 acts as an indicator  to
        show when the circuit is in  use.  C1  ensures  that  speech  is
        unaffected. S1 returns the telephone to normal when closed.

        With the phone on the hook this circuit is undetectable  at  the
        exchange and/or on the line. The switch should be closed to make
        outgoing calls and when receiving calls from the operator.

        The method illustrated here uses the same technology that BT use
        on their 0800 exchange to obtain free incoming calls. (Try  this
        number as a demo: 0800 800 800.)
