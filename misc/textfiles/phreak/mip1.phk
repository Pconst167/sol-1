                     Local Area Networks
                            (LAN)
                              by
                         Ansi-Christ

      [This is the only file formatted for even printing.]

A local area network connects devices that are within a short range.  Most LANs
are unable to connect to public communications services.  LANs were developed
because most communications within a business either occur in the very same
building or within a short distance of each other.  This allows for the sharing
of information and equipment and thus a large savings for the company.

This files is the first in a series of files.  It is not meant to be a complete
systems manual for all LANs, but a basic reference manual on the terminology
and general set up.  In later files there will be more specific information.

This file can be distributed freely as long as none of the information is
changed.  If I have made a mistake, please remember that we are all human and
this does happen.  Contact me on one of the two boards listed at the end to
point out an error.


Topologies:

Ring -

A ring type set up goes in one direction around a group of devices until it
reaches the device that is meant as the destination.  The ring will be
connected by a cable to form the ring.  The ring topology uses a method known
as token passing.  A token is like a bucket in which information can be dumped.
If a certain device does not contain this "bucket" then it can not send out the
data until it gets it.  This will prevent data collision from occurring.

A LAN will usually transmit data in packets (buckets = packets) and add the
necessary routing information to the packet.  (this tells the packet where it's
destination is) Because a ring system has a circular shape the information is
routed in one direction and it will still reach its destination.

One note - I have altered the description of a token slightly to avoid
confusion.  A token is usually sent before a packet and will tell the next
device if the following packet is full or is capable of receiving data.

     \            |
      \           |
       O-----O----O


Tree -

The tree set up links components to the network via connectors.  The network
can be tapped at any available point.  Data can pass from one device to another
and does not have to route through a centralized point.  Just the way a tree
network is set up should make it much faster than a ring type network with the
same computers and devices connected to it.  This type of network is also very
useful because you could add any additional devices as they were need via a
connector without having to go through major modifications to the network
itself.

A tree network does occasionally, just because of the nature of it's set up,
have certain problems with controlling the passing of data.  There is a safety
factor involved with a tree network though.  If one of the systems along the
network go down it will not adversely affect the network as a whole, just that
certain part.

again I apologize for the shitty diagram.

Star -

The star network is connected through a central processing device.  This device
usually takes the form of a PBX or a host computer system.  All lines in this
network are connected to this central unit.  When information must go to
another node on this network it must first pass through the center.  The star
topology is very common and is probably the most common set up for a network.

There is a problem with the star though.  If the central unit goes down then
the whole network is useless.

Transmission media -

Twisted pair wire is commonly used to connect all kinds of equipment.  This is
used in older buildings where it may be very expensive to convert to newer
types of cable.  Problems with this include distortion of signals especially at
higher transmission speeds.

Coaxial cable consists of a single conductor surrounded by a flexible metallic
shielding to minimize signal loss and interference.  Coaxial permits a high
transmission speed.

Twin - Axial cable uses two Coaxial cables, one receiving and one transmitting.
These cables are better than twisted pair cable because of the higher
transmission speed and longer distance.


Baseband and Broadband Systems -

A baseband LAN assigns its entire capacity to a single user for a brief time.
Only one device can use its pathway.  These networks usually use 3/8 inch
coaxial cable.  Advantages are low cost, easy installation, and considerable
capacity.  Baseband does, though, not lend itself to voice quality
communication.

A broadband LAN is sophisticated and uses common television cable and a modem.
Although it is expensive it will allow the network to handle voice, video,
teleconferencing, and graphics transmission.  It does this by using different
bandwidths so one signal does not interfere with another signal.  It is good
for high volume office communication.

Fiber Optics are the next step although very expensive it will eventually
replace the other cables.  Fiber Optics use light to transmit large amounts of
information in a very short time.  A single cable can carry 240 thousand calls
at once.


Interconnecting LANs -

Bridges are one way of connecting similar networks.

Gateways are a way of connecting dissimilar networks.  It acts as a translator
between these networks.  It understands different file structures, data types,
and access methods.


Vendors -

Ungermann-Bass is a large independent vendor.  Offering both base and broadband
services and coaxial cable and fiber optic LANs.

Systek is the OEM supplier of IBM's broadband network.

3Com is a major supplier of PC LANs.

Corvus sells Omninet. They offer a system based on twisted
pair wiring.

Interlan Inc. provides Ethernet based products.

Wangnet by Wang laboratories.

Codex 4000 series by Codex corp.

Information systems network by none other than AT&T
information systems. (commonly abbreviated ISN)

Novell network


LAN terms and what they mean - (note - originally printed in LAN magazine)

Access method:  a way to determine which workstation or PC will be next to use
the LAN.  A set of rules by network hardware and software that direct the
traffic over the network.  Examples include Token passing and Carrier Sense
Multiple Access for Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

Collision:  The result of two workstations trying to use a shared transmission
medium (cable) at the same time.  The electronic signals collide and ruin both
signals.  The whole process takes seconds.

Collision detection:  The process of detecting when a collision has occurred.
Workstations know a collision has occurred if the other station sends no reply
that the signal was received.

Disk Server:  a device equipped with disks and a program that allows users to
make and store files on the disks.  Allows each user to have an increase in
storage space normally not accessible at their PC.

Drop cable:  The cable which allows connection and access to the trunk cables
of a network.

Locking:  prevents people from changing the same data at the same time.

Polling:  used in star networks.  allows the central "hub" system to know when
a node wants to transmit.

On Payphones - By The Surge

A payphone is a payphone is a payphone, I think that Shakespeare said that
once.  At anyrate, the payphone I will be dealing mostly with, due to my
familiarity with this model, is the Western Electric Rotary fone.This should
hold true to most models of payphones as I will not go into vivid detail on the
aspects of this model alone.  This is basically my notes on the findings that I
have come up with upon opening payphones that I deem noteworthy to myself and
others who have not opened payphones or have not studied payphones that they
have opened in depth.  Opening the phone.

One of the most important concepts to realize when opening a payphone is that a
payphone is basically a wall-mounted safe containing a phone (with dtmf
pad/rotary dial exposed) and a cashbox (and related mechanisms).  When opening
a safe, you must realize that the easiest way to open a safe is through the
opening method provided.  In the case of the payphone, this consists of a lock
and a turn-key insert.  This lock is in the middle of the right hand side of
the phone.  This contains many tumblers similar to a safe and can be
manipulated by drilling a hole around the key insert with a hole-saw drill.
The turn-key is on the left side at the same level as the cradle for the hand-
set.  Drill a similar hole around this mechanism also.  In removing the
tumblers of the right side, you will expose the slide that should be pressed
downward by a screwdriver or similar probing type tool.  Then the same should
be done to the turn-key side.  Use of a mallet may assist the pushing of the
probe to get the slide into the down position.  At this time the top-front of
the phone should be lifted upward and outward and the insides will be exposed.
The black metal is only a shell that covers the inner metal and removal of this
metal will accomplish nothing.

Payphones were meant to withstand the attact of a vandal who does not have
power tools.  No matter what gamma rays may turn you into the Incredible Hulk,
you will not be able to open the phone without power tools.  To elaborate on
how strong the metal is, in opening a dented phone, I broke 1 hole-saw drill
bit, 2 screwdrivers and a mallet.  All physical manhandling will do to a phone
is to bind the lock and wreck the electrical devices inside.  Once the lock is
bound, it is next to impossible to open the phone without a blow-torch.  Also,
if you know a locksmith well enough and the lock is still in working condition
you may be able to have a key made up for it (with the right connections, this
is not impossible as I have found out).

Tone Oscilator-

AKA the redbox holds, on the Western Electric models at least, a 2 way switch
which you may find interesting.  It is labled CF DTF for Coin First and
Dial-tone First as you may have read in BIOC 003's course VI on payphones.  It
is very interesting and annoying to realize that it is a switch you will find
every time that you walk up to a phone that is set to CF.  "Jeeze, all I have
to do is throw one stupid leetle (Mexican for little) switch and I could use a
Blue Box, code, 3rd party billing, collect-call, 800-diverter ect....  The tone
oscilator is connected to a central unit via 11 pin connector.

Dialing Unit-

The dialing unit is also connected into the central unit via an 11 pin
connector.  The dialing unit holds the dtmf pad/rotary dialing wheel and the
cradle and the cord to the hand-set.  The cord to the hand-set is protected
with an armoured outside shell and a very strong cable inside which the red,
yellow, black and green wires braid themselves around.

Coin Mechanism-

The coin mechanism starts in the upper left hand side of the phone and goes
back to the back of the phone, through the totalizer (red-box mechanism) and
and back out to the bottom-front of the phone.  It will hold a maximum of 17
quarters before the load has to be dropped into the cashbox (that is why you
should never try to red-box more than $4.25 into a phone at any one interval.)
At that point as one noted friend of mine found out (Dr.  Killdeath) something
like this will happen:

"Hello?"

"Hello sir, this is the operator.  Just what exactly are you trying to pull
here?"

"Your leg baby!"

-click!

Conclusion-

Maybe I will find out even more with my next payphone and as allways, I will be
willing to share my findings with all that are willing to take interest and
read.  Dr.  Killdeath, if you read this, contact me at one of the boards I have
mentioned bellow as I haven't heard from you since Red Square.  Any comments
(especially additions) please contact me at any of the boards I call.

On pedestals - By The Surge & Bellcon

First off, by far, phreaking entails much much more than codes.  The true
phreak is into the "hands-on" aspect of phreaking more than the bluebox
programs or the codes.  This experience is using actual blueboxes, trashing and
the now ever so popular and still growing field of 'pedestal hacking.'
Pedestals are the 'cans', or grey-green boxes that are owned by Bell on the
side of the road.  These appear only in rural or suburban areas.  In cities,
you must use the same methods but these ports may be found in manholes instead.
Basically, a pedestal is an interface, are bridging gap, between two stretches
of telephone cables.  The first stretch being from your Central Office to your
street, and the second from there to your house.  In every-day use, it is
mainly used as an access port for line testing and installation by lineman.
They are no longer needed in the use of manual eavesdropping by Bell since all
modern eavesdropping is done in your Central Office, and will be undetected
because there is no voltage drop.  This is not to say that you cannot eavesdrop
from these points though.  Radio Schlock sells a $20.00 recorder that will only
record when there is a drop in voltage on the line (someone picks up a phone)
which can be attached at the terminal set of the person you wish to eavesdrop
on.  Other than this device, Radio Schlock also sells the new CPA-1000 pen
register.  This will keep acurate tabs on any phoneline you wish to keep these
records on and runs about $100.00.  (See May '87 of 2600 Magazine.) Keep in
mind that to hook these devices up to someones phone lines is not only an
invasion of privacy but is also in many ways against the law.  If you are in
the pedestal to begin with you obviously have no regard for either so I guess
it is no big deal.  Of course you all have the files on how to build "beige"
boxes aka linesman's handsets so I won't bother with that.  This is of course
an effective tool to monitor conversations.  I personally use an actual test
set which has the built in monitor on it so it goes virtually un-noticed.  If
you wish to modify your own phone to do the same, just disconnect the grey (or
blue or white) wire on the F1-Post and the same effect will be accomplished in
a cruder way.  The big drawback is that you will wind up bringing the entire
base of the phone along with you to have this feature.

Next order of business is some annoying things that you can do to someone from
the pedestal.  Basically, when you are at the pedestal you have much more power
than at any of their phones.  If they detect you on the line and go to call the
"proper" authorities, just disconnect the wires from the terminal blocks and
they can not complete the call because their phone will be dead.  Then run like
hell.  Elsewhere in this issue of MIP are the plans for the 'ring-busy' device.
This may also be hooked to the terminal blocks easily.  I do recommend printing
out that file or at least saving it to disk as it could come in very handy.  It
makes the line ring once, then give busy status.  The owner of the line can
make outgoing calls but will not even hear the first ring.  One thing to
remember when using the monitor/disconnect or the ring-busy device is that if
the owner of the line has 2 lines, be sure to disconnect/busy both of them.

Experimentation is something that is the best about pedestal hacking.  It is
pretty much wide open.  [No pun intended.] One interesting thing that you can
do is to run wires from one set of terminal blocks to the other.  Both lines
will be connected to each other and this provides quite a humourous effect to
listen in on a test set with.  Another good way of phucking around is to take
the wires running from one set of terminal blocks and change them with wires
from another set of terminal blocks.  This will cause all line A's calls to go
to house B and vice-versa.  Another interesting device to hook up (neither of
us have tried this but in theory it could work) is to take a battery that will
produce a large (but not too large) amount of voltage (like a car battery) and
hook this up to an alternater which will cause the voltage to run in pulses.
This will cause the line to constantly ring [or at least make the bell ringer
lock up] until the phone is picked up.  When the phone is put back down, this
will continue.  This will disallow outgoing and incoming calls and be a general
annoyance.

Opening the pedestal can be acheived simply.  If it is the type of a case that
has 2 doors on the front and opens like a closet (quiet front or QF) just
insert a 7/16" socket wrench (key word-socket since there are washers around
the nut that make it impossible to use anything but a socket wrench or
nut-driver) and just follow the directions printed above the handle.  For the
'can' type boxes, just undo the nuts with a 7/16" socket wrench (again, only
socket) and lift the front cover off by pulling on the 'handle' at the bottom
and pulling down and off.  (This also makes a great seat on those wet nights!).

Now all you have to do is find out what line you are accessing (be sure it's
not yours!) by using ANI.  If you are not from the 518 area I would suggest
subscribing to 2600 and writing in for your ANI (if you don't allready know it)
If you are from 518, 998 (or in some weird places 997) is what you want to dial
to find the number of the line that you are on.  Once you are sure that it is
not yours, you can call anywhere for free since you are using the phone of
someone else.

One thing that I have noticed in looking around at a lot of pedestals is what
we call a 'node'.  It is protected by a black rubber cap.  The nodes are easy
to see, as they are usally two or three feet up the pole, and have black wires
running either from the ground, or the top of the pole.  The caps can be very
easily removed to expose a set of terminal posts.  Since these nodes are
mounted on the telephone pole they provide easy access to the lines since you
don't have to open a pedestal at all to get at them.  They are, other than the
access-ability factor, the same as the terminal blocks inside of a pedestal.

One thing that should be mentioned is a reminder.  If you happen to cut any of
the wires inside, intentionally or not, you have committed a serious crime.
Not only is this theft and vandalism, it may be deemed by officials as
something more organized.  Many things are carried over phone lines besides
just voices.  Lines such as bank or lottery data, medical systems, and alarm
systems are a few of the things that when cut, could lead to some serious
trouble.  In one such case similar to this, the local division of the FBI
showed up for some thorough investigating (along with TelCo and State Police.)

Well, that is just about all that I have to say 'on pedestals'.

One final note, a pedestal is not yet in use, there is still current running
through it although you will not get a dialtone from any of the terminals or
wires themselves.  They are basically useless although the cases make great end
tables for your room.  Look in the future for a follow up file dealing with
test probes and other lineman paraphenalia as well as with anything else that
we learn from Ma Bell (knock on wood).

Have you ever been on vacation and while staying in a hotel you realized that
they are ripping you off?  If so, read on.  I will list some various ways to
save money and possibly have a good time screwing them over.

While staying in a hotel room you may realize that it is not very easy to
phreak from the room due to the fact that they monitor every outgoing call.  If
there is no charge for outgoing calls, feel 'free' to phreak as you normally
would from home.  If there is a charge, you may be able to phreak using
alternative methods.  On your hotel phone it may say 'dial 8+1+(area code) +
number.' This is of course is just designating that you want an outside line,
and to record billing for hotel records purposes.  Try dialing other numbers
first other than an 8 first.  If you get a dial tone then use that line to dial
out.  You may still get billed for it, but then again, you may not.  It sure as
hell can't hurt.  For some reason hotels are now all going to modular
jacks...this is a direct invitation to take what (what could be easier?) When
most maids are done cleaning they will leave the doors to rooms open.  Walk
right in and take a phone from that room.  I would not advise that you take
your own phone (for obvious reasons.)

There is of course the tried and true method of walking over to a hotel pay
phone to carry out your business.  This also brings up an interesting point.
Most hotel phones are indoors on hotel walls.  The strongest support they have
to the wall is some plaster and a few wood screws.  It would be a bit risky to
take one from this location, but it's always an option.

Upon looking around many hotels, you may notice that the power switches for
ENTIRE hallways are left in the open, unlocked.  This could bring about a quite
chaotic situation, making it quite easy for you to enter someone's room and
take what you please.  Be weary of the emergency power lights that are ALWAYS
in hotels.  I would not suggest you do this, it is only proving that hotel
management is not always the smartest class of people in the world.

If the hotel is of any good quality, it will have a restaurant somewhere on the
premisis.  Walk in and eat until you burst, upon paying your bill politely ask
if you can bill it to your hotel room.  Be sure to ask if these arrangements
can be made before-hand.  All they will want is a name and room number.  Make
any room and name up as they will not usually verify it.  (What hotel would
want to harrass and 'honest' customer?)

Finally, when checking in and out, keep your eyes on the computer.  As stated
earlier, hotel management is not too smart.  Not smart enough to remember logon
procedures and passwords that is.  It is not unlikely that the whole procedure
will be written stamped on the terminal.  Keep this for future reference!

If you are not impressed with this file, stop complaining.  Request something
next issue, or take whatever you get.  You're not PAYING for this!

This is the best list that I could get a hold of.  Hacking Merit is very
interesting as you can reach telenet via merit as well as all these adresses
that are listed above.  If you know telenet, you know that this makes Merit
practically unlimited.  I hear from Bellcon that there is a UNIX out there with
the uucp account and password uucp but it needs a core dump to get to the
prompt.  If you are into that sort of thing, go for it!  If not, there are
still quite a few other destinations that you may wish to hack.  I am sure that
that UNIX is wide open seeing that uucp's pw was uucp.  Try the other default
accounts.  Merit is down at this time due to extensive hacking and a friend of
mine got a little note on his MTS account about this so be carefull not to do
this from MTS or anywhere where it can be tied to you.  To get to MERIT just

type:
%call 999900009999

when you are connected to the 266-8989 dialup or any dialup of ISNET.  I hear
that the 266 prefix will be soon changed to 276 but the last 4 digits of ISNET
will remain the same 8989.  I hope you enjoyed this file.  It took no great
intelligence to write but can be used as a reference for serious hackers who
have not tried MERIT yet.  This is a way for you to get started and I wish you
the best of luck on getting accounts in all your travels and hope you never
choose to destroy any data or system anywhere.  Remember, the greatest sence of
power comes from holding the power to destroy a system, and choosing not to..

Introduction
------------
Well this is the How To file on The Ring-Busy Device.  This is very simple to
construct and is also very simple to connect on someones fone line.  It is
probably the easiest thing you will ever do what is actually worth what little
effort you put in.  Now your probably saying to yourslef:


What The Hell Is A Ring-Busy Device?
------------------------------------
A Ring-Busy Device is of course a device that when connected on to you enemys
fone line will make it so that when you call this persons fone you will get a
Ring-Busy.  A ring-busy is exactly what it says, A ring and then a busy, That
is One ring and from then on busy.  Also the pathetic person who has the fone
that this device is being used on will not have his fone ring.  This means he
will not even know that anyone is calling.  Your probably saying BIG DEAL, why
not just cut his line!  Well this is better because he can still use his fone,
thats right, if he wanted to he could pick up his fone and he would get a dial
tone, he could then dial out not knowing of this device.  This is especially
useful for those r0dent BBS's that are pissing you off.  If someone has a BBS
and this device is on the line then they wont get any calls for their BBS
(hehe), and they wont know why either!


How the Ring-Busy Device Was Conceived
--------------------------------------
It all started one morning at 4am when I went out special to steal this
emergency police/fire fone.  Once I got it home I hooked it up to my line and
noticed that whenever someone called me they would get a ring-busy, this was
extremely odd, so I tried to figure out why the hell that was happening, and I
did, and now we have the Ring-Busy device.  It is also useful if dont want to
talk to someone but you dont want to put the fone off the hook, just put this
little device on and those leeches that keep bothering you for games wont be a
problem anymore.


Ring-Busy Device Plans
----------------------
 As I said before this is very very simple to construct.

Parts Needed:
 (1) 7k resistor (7000 OHMS)
 (1) Fone line
 (1/2) a brain (at least)

Procedure:
Now all you have to do is connect up this 7k resistor to the fone line on the
red and green terminals, Here is an easy diagram of how to add it onto someones
fone line.  The diagram represents the nice little box that the fone line comes
through on the side of your house.

NOTE:  This is for a 1 fone line configuration.  If they have two I think you'd
figure it out?  If not too Bad...

Diagram:
          #########
          #       #
          # G-7-R #
          #       #
          #########
                                         G - Green terminal
 R - Red Terminal
 7 - 7k resistor

Now if they have 2 fone lines then connect another 7k resistor to the
black and yellow terminals.

 Its That Simple....

7k resistors might be a some-what hard to get, try your local electronics store
and dont bother with Rat Shack, I already checked, they dont sell them.

If you must, a 6.5k or maybe 7.5k resistor will work, but Ma Bell uses 7k so I
do the same.


Suggestions
-----------
 Here are a few ways to use or misuse this device.

1) Connect it on to your fone:  Simple just cut off the modular end of your
fone cord and connect it to the red and green wires, then connect the modular
plug you cut off to the resistor too, and then just plug the fone in and you
have a permanent Ring-Busy Device, Another way of doing it would be to put a
SPST switch in there so you can turn it on or off, thats what I do and it works
great (Especially when r0dents start bothering me)

2) Connect it to your favorite enemys fone line, and enjoy while watching him
try to figure out why he isn't getting any fone calls, BUT if the luser has 2
fone lines I suggest that you connect one Ring-Busy Device onto each fone so he
doesn't get calls on the other fone from people telling him that his fone is
phucked.


Conclusion
----------
Well as this file comes to an end, I would like to tell you to call some of the
best boards around:

Introduction:
-------------
In this file on Crahing a C-Net I will discuss methods of making, using, and
getting backdoors on C-Net, I will also show some C-Net programming and how to
make your very own backdoor!

First I will discuss ways to get SysOp access on a cnet...There are a few ways
and most are effective.


Method 1
--------
Now this method is quite simple BUT a certain access level is needed.  This
works like this:

First:  you must try and convince the SysOp to give you SubOp access of one of
the UD sections, this is the only thing stopping you from complete control of
his board.  If you dont have a commie then try to convince him to have maybe a
g-philes section or a UD section of your computer type and for him to make you
a subop, this won't be too hard if you are an expert in the art of
bullshitting.

Second:  (This is the easy part) Log on the board real late at night (somewhere
between 2-4am) and go into your sub in the UD section, then hit Z for subop
maintenance and once in there hit 2, once you are at this menu change the name
of the UD section to:  name/e (where the name is the name of the UD).  Then
leave the subop maintenance and leave the UD section, then go back into the UD
section and you will see that your UD section is now a ENTIRE DISK EXCHANGE
MODE which means you can kill/upload/download anything on the disk.

Third:  Now you must make for yourself backdoor, and then upload it to the
board in place of the a prg.  file already on the disk (making a backdoor for
yourself will be discussed later)

Fourth:  Now just execute the prg.  file you replaced with your backdoor and
your set!!


Method 2
--------
Now this method is simple and you dont need subop access BUT the sysop of the
BBS you want to install this backdoor on has to be either:

1) a Lazy bum
 or
2) a completely stupid asshole

   This is how it works...

First:  You must go into the p-files section and see if there are any games in
there, if not then funs over, this method wont work.  Dont get your hopes up
just because there are online games, now what you have to do is execute each
one and make sure that each one is there and make sure you dont see:  'Error
reading "name of game"', if you dont get any errors and all the games are there
then your out of luck.

Sorry, but the reason why it would say error reading the game is because that
game isn't on the disk (or maybe it is just that the sysop misspelled the name
, in any case...If there is an error than you now have the ability to install a
backdoor.

Second:  This is easy from now on, now all you have to do is go into the UD
section and upload a game with the name prg.name of game missing.  Example:
game missing is wrestling, so you upload a game called prg.wrestling.

Get it?  Well anyways this prg.  that you upload must be you very own backdoor
(this will be discussed later) Third:  Just execute that game after you have
uploaded it and you in control.


Method 3
--------
This is probably the most worthless method and the hardest to do, but what the
hell.  In this method you must:

First:  Get ahold of an online game that the sysop does not have and is
somewhat a good game, then install a backdoor (discussed later) and then upload
it to the UD section, if the sysop is an idiot he will add it to the p-files
section without even checking it, if he is smart he will check it for backdoors
and if he is a complete idiot or you are good at hiding back doors than he'll
add it to the p-files section.

Second:  Once it's in the p-files section just execute it and go with your
backdoor.  That simple!


Method 4
--------
Do the same as method 3 BUT do not install a backdoor in the game, and wait
till he puts it in the p-files section, once he does go into the UD section you
uploded it to and check if its still there, if so then since you uploaded it,
just kill it and then upload your backdoor, then execute the game and Ta Da!


Making A Backdoor For Yourself
------------------------------
NOTE:  It always helps to have a commie at hand when editing or making games or
backdoors for CNET but I'm sure any computer will do.

Here I will discuss some of the variables needed and some sub-routuines need to
make a backdoor or game.

Well first of all to start out all CNET games MUST be between the lines of
512-580, and you can not skip lines.

---------------------
 Important Variables:
---------------------
a$ - used to print out things on the BBS, goes with a gosub 40, for example if you wanted to print out 'axeman is
an asshole' you could do that by doing:
a$="axeman is an asshole":gosub40
ac% - this is your access level, the access levels of cnet go from 0-9 (9
being sysop, and 0 being new user) I will discuss access levels in detail
in a later file.
 NOTE: one easy way to make a backdoor would be to but somewhere in the game
a line like this:
ac%=9, that would give you sysop access an$ - the response of an input, (in
other words what the luser typed in)
b$  - current board # your in.
cm$ - prompt (example=MAIN:)
id  - your id
d1$ - last call date
d2$ - current time and date
pw$ - your password
------------------------
 Important Sub-Routines:
------------------------
gosub 2100 - like input.(an$=the inputs response)
gosub 40   - to print something out to the modem,(Example: a$="hello":gosub40
will print out 'hello')
goto 6000  - logoff the user
goto 1300  - the main menu
goto 512   - execute a p-file(game)
goto 16000 - read a file
gosub61000 - do this 1st before going
to 512 for loading in a game example:
to load 'dumb game' do this:
a$="dumb game":goto61000:goto512
  Well those are some of the real neccesities.

NOTE: When printing something out to the modem a ctrl-k will act as a
carriage return. Example:
a$="<ctrl-k>hello<ctrl-k>":gosub40 that will print a return then hello and
then another return.


Backdoor Example:
-----------------
Here is a very simple example of a backdoor file for cnet, if you want you can
use this, or your very own backdoor.

Here goes:

512 a$=" a stupid backdoor ":gosub40
513 ac%=9:goto1300

As you probably know the example i've given will print out' a stupid backdoor '
and will then give you sysop access, and then return you to the main menu.  The
above is ofcourse a lame example, I dont have time for a complicated one.  But
I think you got the idea...If not then leave me mail on any board I'm on.  Also
try contacting your local commie user, he might be able to supply you with some
nice ones, If you need one real bad, let me know and I'll make a few for you.


C-Net Trick
-----------
This isn't much but it is a simple way to find out who posted a anonymous msg
on a CNET, this only works with the main message not the responses.  What you
do is read the message and then privately reply to the idiot who posted the
message(Ooops I forgot to tell ya that you have to have a good idea of who the
hell posted it...) then once you have done that go into the e-mail section by
hitting M at the main menu and then type V to verify someones mail then all you
do is enter that persons name and if it says that guy has a msg from you that
you know it's him...  Not so great a trick eh?

So, you are walking through your local Caldor, you see a phone sitting there,
there are no clerks around, and nobody is watching you, it is now time to use
the phone.  Yes, you too can make calls to lots of different and strange places
in your Caldor!  In this first issue of Caldor Phone Numbers, I will give you
some neat numbers to mess around with.  To use these numbers, pick up the
phone, dial a 7, then wait for a louder dial tone, then you can put in the
number of your choice.  Here are the numbers you could use:

customer assistance to hardware or some other department, it might be
interesting...remember, these numbers are for informational purposes only, I do
not approve of you using them.  Be sure to look for the next file on Caldor
