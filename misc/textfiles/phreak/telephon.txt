                                 THE PHONE BOMB 
                                ----------------  
 
	The phone bomb, is an excellent single target anihalatory weapon.  
With results being either SERIOUS injury or death. The basic principle that 
this works on is simple, the person answers the phone, the bomb explodes! A 
small but powerful, high explosive material is placed in the reciever. A 
squib (detonator) is then placed in the center of the material. Next take  
the hot leads from the earpiece speaker (phone MUST be DISCONNECTED from the 
wall), and connect them to the leads on the squib. Next, place a high 
explosive compound, such as "C-1", standard black powder may be used if it 
is compressed and compacted into the phone compartment. The latter being used 
primarily for injury. now place the reciever "on the hook", plug the phone 
back into the wall. Now when someone picks up the phone, current will flow 
from the phone to the squib, igniting the explosive and bang!!! 
 
	An alternate and somewhat more "cruel" variation. The process is the 
same for placement and detonation, however a piece of tape is used to hold 
the reviever switch down. Plug the phone in. When an individual pics up the 
phone, he/she will then remove the tape. When the tape is removed the 
explosive will detonate, and the bomb will most likely be by the persons 
ear...
