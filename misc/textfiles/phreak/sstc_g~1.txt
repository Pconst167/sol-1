This is what I found one day when I went trashing with my phreinds and thought
it would be it would be nice to type up so everyone can know what procedures
the SSTC (Special Service Test Center) follows :                           

Heres what it says (to the testers offcourse):

1) Keep all trouble entry codes and narrative complete and accurate to avoid 
   input error.
 
2) Testers are not to Exclude or RST any trouble. RSA's to exclude or FST only
   with Magnagement approval.

3) Be aware of measured duration on all trouble. Measurement of duration is
   everyones job.

4) Use work performed  codes 1,2,3,5 & 6 ONLY ONCE on each trouble.

5) Testers are to leave employee code blank in closeout box. This box is for 
   RSA use only. Testers are responsible for completing the type, disposition,
   cause , FL1 (if required) and ATH narrative in closeout section of BOR 

6) All Testers are required to verify unit#, route code, class off service
   /service code, category of report and FL1 (sub code) on all troubles.

7) All New York Telephone troubles MUST HAVE
           
     a. Responsibility code of user
     b. Job Function code of user
     c. User Reach number
 
8) Use narrative on EST mask when possiblle. Indicate test, who refered, 
   TN (Telephone Number), etc.

9) Re:  Escalations - Enter date/time one minute after last entry and in
   narrative indicate correct date/time, who escalated to level and TN

10) Front Ends Used:

        2B - All suffolk
        2A - All Nassau (except below)  
        3A - Hicsville, Levittown and Farmingdale

11) Unit Numbers Used:

        962 - All TTY, DATA, FAA, LOB & WATTS
        963 - ALL OCC
        964 - SCC
        961 - SUFFOLK SPECIALS
        441 - BAYSHORE S.S.T.C (Testing Unit of Suffolk Spec.)


        011 = 2A         038 = 2A
        022 = 2B         048 = 2B  These Unit numbers "RED FLAG" Top 200
        033 = 3A         058 = 3A  Customers.

12) ALL Switched Data Troubles are to be MLT  Tested and  indicated in LMOS
    (and on BOR) with  work performed code 2.

13) Re: STOP/START CLOCK

    Stop clock is to be used on all trouble which we intend to Dispatch
    to the customer but cannot do so because access is not available to 
    customer premises - this applies not only on Nassau and Suffolk troubles
    but on referred out troubles (Bklyn, Qns, Bronx, etc.) as well. The  
    narrative must provide information to justify the use of Stop clock.
    The work performance code Zero is THE ONLY code to be used after an eight
    (stop) and before a nice (start). Any other code will cancel the stop 
    clock. Stop and Start clock codes can be used a maximum of three times on
    one trouble report.

        The following Codes indicate a Stop/Start Clock.

        8 - STO - 121 = Stop Clock
        9 - STA - 122 = Start Clock

14) Re: Delayed Maintenance

    Delayed Maintenance is to be used when the customer has a Ckt out of
    service but still has communication with same location by use of an   
    alternate service. Alternate service can be Dial back up or another
    Ckt. going to the same location. Delayed Maintenance can be used  from 
    5:00PM friday through 8:00AM Monday. The codes used in LMOSare the same
    as for Stop/Start Clock. The difference is the narrative must indicate
    the alternate service the customer has.

                 Example #1 - Customer has D.B.H
                 Example #2 - Customer Has Ckt # _________ to same location.

    We must ask the customer if he has alternate service on all troubles
    "carried" overnight. The customer is entitled to a rebate for the entire
    duration of his trouble if it is over 24 hrs  on Data troubles and all
    occ orders specify (CCA) Customer Credit Allowance. We are responsible
    to give the customer the proper credit to which they are entitled.

15) Re: Message Reports

    When sending a message report to another Bureau for Dispatch/Test, make
    sure the following information is included :
 
    Circuit Number
    Customer Name
    Customer Address
    Customer Reach Number
    Our Reach Number 
    U.G Cable/Pair
    Test
    Access Hours
    Vendor Reach number for ok/serial
   
    On the original trouble BOR, Enter line of status putting Circuit on hold
    and the M.R T.T.N
