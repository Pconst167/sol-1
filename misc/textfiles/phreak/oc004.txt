     Before I start this phile I want to clear up the difference between
"Remote Call Forwarding" and "Remote Access to Call Forwarding".  To clear
it up, here's some legitimate uses.  Remote Call Forwarding would be for a
person or business who wanted to have a local access number somewhere else.
For example, if you lived in SF, and wanted a local number in LA, you would
subscribe to that service.  Remote Access to Call Forwarding, however has
many more uses.  It's a service a frequent traveler who leaves on the spur
of the moment would subscribe to.  It requires you also subscribe to basic
Call Forwarding.  When the traveler (you) calls into the remote access
number it can be forwarded to ANY number...need I say more?  Just dial it as
you would direct!  Can't think of any uses?  How about 900 numbers?  Or
forward the line to your friend and call collect!  The other number will be
billed, TWICE!  Theoretically, it would be possible to saturate an entire
long-distance company with this.  If you could get a map of the long-distance
backbone and forward a number at every location.  Well, anyways, on with the
phile...

Ok, the first thing you need to order this service is a valid name & address
in an area that's served by PacBell (I don't know about this service in other
areas).  It's prefreiable if you have the social security number and driver's
license number, since they ask for one of them 75% of the time.  Now you can
start the phun.  Here's what to do (from a payphone, cellphone, or PBX only):
1. If you live in California, "0" opeartor-divert a call to 800-773-2355.  If
you live out of state make a collect call through "0" to 408-339-6222.  They
should just ask for your name (make one up) and connect you, however I have
not verified this.  If you can phreak the call, just phreak it.  Here's what
ya do:
1. Get connected to one of the above numbers (duh!)
2. Follow the instructions.  When it asks for your phone number, enter the
   phone number of the person who's info you got.
3. Speak to a repersentitive, don't use the quickservice automated system.
   It dosen't allow you to order the services you want.
4. Tell the ignorent repersentetive that you'd like to order "Call Forward-
   ing and Remote Access to Call Forwarding".  Be sure they're clear on the
   fact that you'd like remote access, and not remote call forwarding.
5. Some repersentetives know how to do this, but most will put you on hold.
   They will tell you the pricing information.  Just say "ok", like you knew
   it before, but not like you're not paying for it.
6. Go through the necessary to order standard Call Forwarding (if the person
   dosen't already have it).
7. They MAY verify the SS number or driver's license.  If you don't have it,
   simply tell them that you're on vacation and you'll have to call home and
   check on that.  Then just call back using a different name.  They always
   buy this.
8. Now order the Remote service.
9. They will ask you what you want your PIN to be.  Make one up and write it
   down.  Next, they will give you the access number of the exchange the
   person's line was in.  This is what you use to change their line's for-
   warding.
Congradulations!  You can now call 900's free!
Ok, you're done!  Drink a beer and say "This is for you, Phucking Phreak!".
Now that you've done that, you will have that number for up to a week!  The
good thing about this is that it's good to abuse as much as possible, because
it lasts until it's found out, but it dosen't matter how much it's used
before then.  To forward their number, simply dial the access number they
gave you and follow the instructions.  The feature codes are 72# to activate
forwarding and 73# to deactivate it.  The trick is to always deactivate it 
as soon as possible, because the longer it's on, the more chance of you
being figured out and it being canceled.  The best thing is to is find an
area with two payphones right next to each other and deactivate it while
you're on the phone.  After you've activated it it should say something like
"This is your remote access call forwarding service, please enter the number
you want your line forwarded to now."  Enter it EXACTLY like it would be
directly dialed from their house (for example 1-900-HOT-4-SEX, 1-213-931-1111,
or 424-1234).  Remember, if they have a different area code than you, you
need to punch in 1 and your area code.  The beauty of this is you can for-
ward to ANY number!  You can forward it to CALL-ATT, or even the "0" oper-
ator.  This can be fun as hell, because imagine what you could do with the
opearator.  You could basically do anything you wanted, and it would be ANIed
to the number forwarding it.
