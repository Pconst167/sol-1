Preface:

" In the beginning there were many carrier scanners on my hard drive, but as
time wore on there became few until there was only one.   One carrier scanner
standing alone as the champion and newest in  carrier scanning  technology.
Here's the story of how this great tool came about.

  Have  you  ever  had  the  sudden need to find all the carriers in a certain
prefix?    A motive might be to find all the modem numbers for your respective
Board of Education or perhaps a string of VAX machines or something. Well such
a  need  overcame  me  one  day  last  year  and  like anyone with a modem and
connections I went in search of a program to  aid  in  my scanning.  The first
couple programs I ran into were written in GWBASIC and didn't work on anything
other than  com  1  or  2.   Anyways that was unexceptable so I searched out a
few  more  but  with  the  same result, either they didn't work on com4 like I
needed or just didn't work at all. Finally I posted a message on a popular net
with  my  situation  and was told about a program in beta test that was surely
what I needed. This program was ToneLoc. Now I when I used (wasted) major file
points  to download this baby I ran it without reading any docs.  Big mistake.
I  was  greeted  with  a huge title screen with all kinds of commands I had to
type  in  from  the  command line.   There was no menu or anything to guide me
through.  Worse yet, it used a skeleton configuration file which ment I had to
load  the  file  into an editor and then change everything to suit my needs as
well as type in about a 30 character command line.  When all was said and done
I  was  finally  ready  to start scanning.   I tried to run it again and I was
aburbtly denied access to it.   This time it informed that I required a fossil
driver to run the program now.  This was getting ridculous, but I went and got
one from a friendly Public Domain board and installed it.  As some of you know,
fossil drivers are not the easiest thing to install and they don't always work
with your modem.  Eventually with MUCH rebooting of my computer, I finally got
everything to work (so I thought) well.   I  was  amazed at all the charts and
options I had to choose from when the program came to life and it began to dial.
Thing is, that's all it did.  Yes it's true it DID preform it's task and  told
me when it found a carrier BUT the thing didn't want to hangup at all.   So  I
decided to write the authors of the program via internet to ask them what  the
hell kinda beta test this is because it wasn't even working properly. I  got a
message back saying that the mail address was unrecognized so I trashed Toneloc
and vowed that I'd make my own and thus Carrier Find was born. "

    ToneLoc would not have have happened without the help of our beta
testers on the net.  We received hundreds of letters telling us about
bugs and suggesting new features.  We've implemented your suggestions
wherever possible.  There are too many people to thank individually,
but a few people do stand out for their most helpful, detailed and
frequent feedback: The Public, Voodoo Ray, and Damiano.  These guys are
el1te.

    Thanks must also go to everyone who bought a t-shirt.  We sold out.
Sorry for the shipping delays; Minor Threat is to blame.  If we ever do
more, they will not be sold by mail, but rather at the major conferences
(hoho, summer, defcon, hope, etc).

    Thanks also to Kim Clancy, who was kind enough to mention us on the
front page of the Washington Post.

    Thanks to everyone who sent us a .DAT file.  Check out the sample
.DAT files to see what people have found.

    We are pleased to be able to include a few third party utilities.
Textmap, by The Public, produces a ToneMap in ASCII.  Prescan, by Arthur
P. Dent and SubEthan, lets you use CD-ROM white pages to disinclude
residential numbers from your DAT files.  We'd love to see more utilities
for ToneLoc; the TL.H header file is included if you wish to write one.

    Please take the time to read the docs! *Back up* your .DAT files,
then convert them with TConvert before you get started.

We've had a few problems with fake versions in the past, so to make sure
this doesn't happen again, all of our EXE files also have corresponding
PGP signature (.SIG) files, zipped up as a group in SIGS.ZIP.  All future
releases will include these signatures from one or both of us.  Check
them like this:

PGP toneloc.sig toneloc.exe

In addition, the latest public release version (and any planned releases)
will always be posted on the WWW page.  Check this if you think you
have a hacked version.
