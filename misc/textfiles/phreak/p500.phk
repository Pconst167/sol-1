     For those in Phortune 500, you may know of the perils that we have faced
as of late.  Shortly after the startup of Phortune, YYZ Private, Brew 
Associate's board, was taken down by a number of forces, including calls 
during non BBS times by authorities of various long distance companies.  In 
better news, under the direction of Brew Associates and The Mad Hacker, YYZ 
Private is taking form as a logon option from the LOGON MATRIX of The Private 
Connection (Mad Hacker's board).  Chances are, that by new years, the "old" 
YYZ Private will return, messages and all, as a sub-let of The Private 
Connection.  *NOTE* Access to both YYZ Private and The Private Connection is 
on an invitation - limited access basis.  In other Phortune news, Striker is 
back after a hiatus, and is welcomed by all.  Quinton J. Miranda set up his 
limited access semi-private board, but is waiting for news from other Phortune 
memebers for modifications and improvements.


     "The Code Thief Project"  Brew Associates, since the demise of YYZ
Private, has been working on a Code Hacker/Exchange Scanner.  As of today 
(12/28/86) version 1.95 has been released to the public, and is well worth the 
download time (3.5 minutes/2400 baud).  Due to new I/O routines, it will work 
with ANY TRUE HAYES compatible or close relation.  Work is being done on 
Brew's part to make this hacker work with other modems and at higher baud 
rates (currently CodeThief 1.95 only supports 300 and 1200 baud).  Code Thief 
can be downloaded from the Official Phortune BBS, The Private Connection.  
Brew Associates can also be reached there.


     "The curse of Blue Beard and PC-Pirate"  As of approx. 12/18, PC-Pirate
and Blue Beard had been removed from The Private Connection.  By 12/20, they 
had been removed from The Fringe and Gallifrey.  No later than Christmas, they 
had been removed from all seven of the operational Holovision Network BBSs at 
the request of THE RENAGADE CHEMIST.  On the date of 12/26, their names 
entered the TRASHCAN.TXT file of The Undergraduate Lounge.  It is suspected 
that several other BBSs have followed in this removal.  BB and PCP (as I will 
refer to them) have not only made threats of "turning in BBSs" to government 
authorities, but have also crank called the YYZ number out of BBS hours where 
it was once a house line.  (The YYZ number is now disconnected.)  In adition to 
trading PWs and LOGONS, they are leeches in the purest sense.  They are 
affiliated with Conrad Seven and Sam Brown.  Sam Brown, aka Mr. Wonderful is 
running a board where they all "hang out."  We have full files on BB. PCP, 
Conrad Seven and Sam Brown.  Sysops.  Remove these people from your boards.  
This is not a joking matter.  They are dangerous, as well as security leaks.


     In non/Phortune news, Major Havoc has returned with yet another great
BBS program for your enjoyment.  The Free World ][ Elite is up and running 
with 40 megabytes and online adventures at your disposal.  (All BBS numbers 
will be listed at the end of this file.)  He will also be running a PG and The 
Private Connection ][ from his LOGON MATRIX.  Several other telecommunication
oriented boards have arisen in Major Havoc's NPA.  Please consult his board 
for the exact numbers bauds and hours (This isn't a goddamned BBS list).


     By Christmas, The Undergraduate Lounge was up and running.  Due to rather
limited space, the board is running in a "TRIAL" state.  Perhaps programs may 
change and the board will become an AE with help from others.


     Some of you may be wondering what the Phortune 500 is.  Formally, we are 
the Phortune 500 Board of Directors.  We are a group of telecommunicationists 
(Pirates/Hackers/Phreakers) that have several goals.  We wish not only to try 
and enlighten ourselves by having open message forums, providing simple, easy 
to follow, guides to concepts (ie: titles like "Alliance from Step One," and 
"The IBM Pirate Primer"), but we are also attempt to spead this information 
(and software) about the country.  For information about joining the Phortune 
500 group, please leave a message to The Mad Hacker, Brew Associates, Quinton 
J. Miranda, Striker, or any other member you may find.  They will gladly relay 
your request to a Phortune message base.  


     Conference.  Because of the demise of YYZ, the Christmas break
teleconference may be abandoned.  Please post times when you can be contacted 
voice on TPC.
