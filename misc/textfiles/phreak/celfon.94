CELLULAR PHONES 
 
     Last year we hypothesized about the "Dick Tracy wrist radio", and why with 
today's technology we haven't seen it yet.  Well, here in 1994 we still don't 
have one for sale, but the good news is that at least there are prototype wrist 
cell phones materializing from one or two manufacturers.  Don't hold your 
breath though -- they're still prototypes. More good news, shirt-pocket sized 
phones are everywhere, and their larger, vehicle-bound cousins contain more 
features than ever before. 
 
     A cellular phone works via an FM transmitter/receiver in the telephone 
itself, and a network of closely spaced cells (or individual transmitters) in a 
pre-set geographical area.  The phone talks to its local cell transmitter, 
which is in turn connected to the nearest standard telephone system.  As you 
move away from the cell that is currently handling your call, the cell "hands 
off" the call to the next nearest cell to you, so there is no interruption in 
service.   
 
     Your local coverage area can cover as much as a 70 to 250 mile radius, 
however, a technology called roaming can extend your cellular service well 
beyond your local area. Roaming enables you to make and receive calls from your 
cellular phone in another city, or anywhere in the U.S., Canada and the 
Bahamas.  All you have to do is transmit a roaming activation code when you get 
to your new destination, and callers can reach you easily. In some cases 
roaming is automatically switched for you, depending on your local cellular 
provider. 
 
     Prices for cellular service vary from place to place, and you can expect 
to pay anywhere between $15 and $60 per month for basic service.  Each local 
call will cost you an additional 20-80 cents per minute, and if you make a long 
distance call you will be charged extra for that as well.  You are also charged 
when someone calls you, so, unless you watch your talk time, cellular phone 
service can get pretty expensive.  Fortunately, you are not charged if you 
reach a busy number (as long as you hang up within 60 seconds), or for callers 
trying to reach you if you don't pick up your phone. 
 
     The digital cellular revolution has recently emerged in some areas.  This 
new service can handle many more calls per cell, affords a higher quality 
transmission, and features complete privacy.  Current cellular phone calls can 
be eavesdropped by persons with multi-band scanners. However, you will need to 
buy a digital cellular phone to realize all the digital benefits.  These new 
phones are completely compatible with all current analog cellular systems, but 
there are only a few models currently available.  
 
MOBILE PHONES 
 
     The mobile phone ($99-$1200) consists of three parts: the electronics, a 
box usually mounted in the truck or under the dash; the antenna, which can be 
glass-mounted to the back window, or roof-mounted for the best performance; and 
the handset itself, which is often located between the front driver and front 
passenger. 
 
     There are a few basic features found in almost all mobile phones. An LCD 
or LED display indicates the number you're dialing, the transmission signal 
strength, the elapsed time of the call in progress, and other pertinent 
information.  Like the backlit dialing keypad, the display is also illuminated 
for night operation.  A volume control is provided for the earpiece volume, so 
you can hear clearly in varying sound environments.  Mute, multiple call 
timers, redial and a scratch-pad memory (for quickly storing information, such 
as a telephone number) are cellular staples, as is an electronic lock with 
password protection, so that parking attendants can't make calls to Japan using 
your phone.  
 
     In addition, don't forget about hands-free conversation -- an essential 
for all mobile phones these days. Using a tiny microphone placed near your 
visor, coupled with a speaker built into the phone cradle, you can converse 
without taking your hand off the wheel.  These systems are smart enough to know 
when you want private conversation, and will cut off whenever the handset is 
picked up. 
 
     Convenience features as listed below are found on mid to high-priced 
cellular fare. In some cases these features are available as options that you 
can add later on. 
 
     Call restriction takes the concept of electronic lock a step further. 
     Although passengers may use the phone for local calls, more expensive long 
     distance calls can be prohibited.  
 
     Memory dialing works very much the same as in a conventional phone.  You 
     press a two-digit code, and the phone will dial the appropriate phone 
     number.  Depending upon the model you can store anywhere from 20-150 
     phones numbers in memory. Some phones include one-touch speed dialing of 
     1-9 numbers, and many offer Alphanumeric memory, which makes it much 
     easier to recall stored numbers.  Instead of having to memorize a two- 
     digit code for each person, with alphanumeric memory, you can key in the 
     person's name by using the alpha-coded keys on the dial pad.  
 
     With Voice Activated Dialing, you only have to hit a single key, and then 
     speak out loud to tell the phone who to dial. This feature can be found on 
     the more expensive phones, or as an option on mid-priced phones.   
 
     Radio mute is extremely convenient.  Whenever you receive or make a call, 
     your car stereo or radio volume will automatically be turned down.   
 
     In addition, some models have Auto-Answer capability, whereby the phone 
     will automatically pick up on the second ring.   
 
     A call-in absence indicator will tell you that a call came in while you 
     were away from the phone, a few models will tell you how many calls were 
     received, and still others will allow the caller to leave his or her phone 
     number. Some newer models even operate like answering machines whereby a 
     personalized outgoing message greets callers and the system allows them to 
     leave voice messages.   
     A number of manufacturers provide a horn alert feature that beeps your 
     horn when an incoming call is detected.  
 
     An auxiliary telephone port comes in very handy for those times you wish 
     to quickly connect a notebook computer, or portable FAX machine to your 
     cellular phone. Some phones have this RJ-11 jack built in, and for others 
     it's available as an option.   
 
     Multiple-NAM allows you to have numerous telephone numbers assigned to one 
     phone.  This feature is convenient if you frequently travel between two or 
     more cities for business, and you don't want to pay long distance roaming 
     charges.  So Multiple-NAM allows you to have a cellular telephone number 
     assigned to each city. Some phones have dual NAMs, others come with four 
     or six. 
 
     Transportable Conversion is a unique feature that enables the car phone to 
     be transformed into a transportable phone via the addition of an optional 
     kit. Transportable phones have many of the features found in mobile 
     phones, the only difference is that this type of cellular phone can be 
     moved from place to place because the 3-watt transceiver, rechargeable 
     batteries, and antenna are contained in a single hardcover book-sized 
     package.  
 
PORTABLE PHONES 
 
     Just like the miniaturization of a notebook computer results in a costlier 
package, the portable cellular phone is more expensive than mobile fare.  This 
year's crop of portables range in weight from 11 ounces to a mere 3.8 ounces of 
electronic circuits and plastic.  Speaking of plastic, expect to pay anywhere 
from $99 to $1500 for a portable phone. 
 
     Because you can only cram so much transceiving power into such a small 
size there is one drawback to portable use.  The transceiver power is cut from 
3 watts down to only .6 watts or 1.2 watts in one or two models.  What this 
means in real life is that you won't have the range or performance of a full 3 
watt mobile phone -- this translates into dropped calls or static from time to 
time.  It all depends on the area in which you live.  Flat surroundings, and 
markets with closely-spaced cells will offer the best performance for portable 
use. 
 
     Interestingly, due to its low wattage, a portable's battery power often 
lasts longer than the older transportable type.  Portable standby time will 
range from about six hours to as much as 30 hours depending upon the model and 
battery used.  Similarly, continuous talk time can range from 30 minutes to 
three hours.  
 
     Many of the same features found in mobile cellular phones are available in 
the portable, albeit some mobile features such as radio mute, and horn alert 
are not likely to be found.  Memory dialing will range from 30-100 stored 
numbers, and conveniences such as electronic lock, call restriction, signal 
strength metering, call timers, automatic answer, one-touch dialing, 
alphanumeric memory, lighted display, and dial-pad, Multiple NAMs and a 
scratchpad memory are all available on the portable. There is a unique new 
feature on some models that consists of a vibrating system that signals you 
when a call is received. This is an ideal way to be alerted to a call so that 
you don't disturb others or when a noisy environment prevents you from hearing 
the phone ring. 
 
     Although portables are convenient, a more permanent approach is often 
needed.  Fortunately many manufacturers offer the convenience of portability 
with the flexibility and range of permanent-mount installations.  All you have 
to do is pop your portable into a car-mounted cradle, and it's quickly 
transformed into a cellular car phone.  Optional car-mount kits contain a 
special cradle-mount that can accept the portable phone via the use of handset 
cord, or alternatively, an extra handset is provided along with a cradle in 
which the portable is plugged into.  Either way, the kit includes a cable for 
connection to a permanent cellular antenna, and direct connection to the car's 
battery power.  Most manufacturers have hands-free speakerphone options, and 
many offer booster kits to upgrade the portable from .6 to a full 3 watts of 
transmitting and receiving power. Amenities such as voice activated dialing and 
RJ-11 data jacks are also available in kit form on some models. 
 
     When buying a portable make sure it's well-balanced in features, and 
comfortable to hold.  The lightest and smallest models cost the most money, and 
you can pay as much as a $500 premium to save a few ounces and inches in size.  
 
SHOPPING AROUND 
 
     Unlike, other types of electronics, you may notice that the suggested list 
prices of cellular phones are much, much higher than the actual street prices.  
This is because in return for signing up business, many cellular franchises 
will offer retailers a rebate from $200-$400 for each customer sold a phone.  
However, in most cases you will have to sign a service contract with the 
cellular phone service providing the rebate, and that will lock you into a 60 
day to three year term.  While it's true that there are only two cellular 
service franchises assigned to a single cellular market, each provider may 
offer different services, or cover a different number of cities or towns, so 
you may not wish to be locked into any one particular company.  Generally, 
though prices are fairly competitive between the two providers. 
 
     Cellular phones may also be purchased directly from the franchise itself.  
This is sometimes a good deal as a free antenna and installation are sometimes 
included -- a nice buy when you consider that retailers can charge anywhere 
from $50 to over $150 to install a car system. 
 
     It can't hurt to shop around.  All types of discount stores, car audio 
shops, telephone stores and mail order companies sell cellular phones these 
days.  Make sure that whoever you buy from has a good return policy, and is an 
authorized sales and service center for the products they sell.  If you aren't 
sure whether the retailer is authorized just call the manufacturer of the brand 
you're interested in, the folks in customer support will be happy to guide you 
in the right direction.
