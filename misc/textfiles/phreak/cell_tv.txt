Subject: Cellular Phone via T.V.

1.  Background--Cellular phones occupy 824-848 Mhz (mobile) and 869-894 Mhz
(base).  FM is used and channel spacing is 30 Khz.  Mobile/Base spacing is 45
Mhz.  These frequency bands were formerly occupied by UHF-TV Channels 72-76 and
80-83+.  Shouldn't a TV be able to pick up these signals?????

2.  Connect an antenna to the UHF terminals of a TV.  If a UHF antenna is not
available, just use a piece of wire about a foot long with the ends connected
to the two UHF terminals.

3.  Turn on the TV and turn up the audio gain (TV's use much wider deviation).
Slowly tune around channels 80 and 83.  Occasional audio should be heard, but
because the TV audio section requires a 4.5 Mhz signal, audio will be heard
only when two cellular channels about 4.5 Mhz apart are active.

4.  A second TV (assuming higher local oscillator and about 45 Mhz IF) could
provide the necessary hetrodyne so that the first TV can detect a single
incoming signal.

     a.  Tune the first TV (with UHF antenna) to channel 82 (80-83).

     b.  Bring the second TV as close as possible to the first and slowly tune
         it around channel 75 (72-76), until audio is heard...or

     c.  Retune by small increments...set the first TV, then sweep the second
         etc.

5.  DISCLAIMER!!!!! Try this at your own risk......don't know the
legalities/illegalities of listening to cellular phones......
