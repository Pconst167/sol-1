Anything you connect to the phone lines is *supposed* to be FCC registered, to
make sure it won't injure repairmen or damage equipment.  The gadgets des-
cribed in this file do NOT apply any extra voltage to the line, and should
be safe.  If in doubt, check with the phone company before connecting any 
stuff to your line.  (These gadgets do not put any extra "ringer equivalence"
on your line, either.)

          CONFERENCE CALLER

If you have two phone lines, you can this simple attachment to set up your 
own conference calls. You'll never pay to have an operator set them up for
you again.  Once you've called the two other people on your two lines, you 
just throw the switch. All three of you can now talk to each other.

Phone lines carry voices as audio frequencies superimposed on DC control 
voltages (around 40-50 volts when not in use, with higher pulses when 
ringing; around 10 volts when a phone is being used -- I forget the exact 
numbers, but those are close.)

The two lines can be connected through capacitors, so the audio passes between
the two, but the DC voltages don't interfere with each other.  (If you 
simply short the lines together, the phone company may not like it!)

Use this simple circuit:

             ! !    
 red --------! !---o: o------ red
             ! !    :
(line 1)            :      (line 2)
             ! !    
green--------! !---o  o------green
             ! !
              ^     ^
       capacitors  DPST
       .1 to 1 uf  switch
    (not critical)
(do *not* use polarized electrolytics!)

(This circuit is similar to the other conference caller mentioned on the
Roman Forum, which doesn't have the capacitors.)

             HOLD BUTTON

This gadget also is a variation on one posted on the Roman Forum.

Shorting the line is not a good idea.  A resistance of 1-2K is enough to hold 
the line, without making the line look screwed up to the phone company.

           
red ------o  o----\\\\------ green

          SPST    1-2K
         switch

(It doesn't matter which direction you connect this circuit in -- red-to-green
and green-to-red both work.)

If you like, you can add an LED that will light whenever you have someone on
hold.  Just connect the LED in series with the switch and resistor (now about
500 ohms to 1.5k, depending on your LED -- experiment!).  Like this:

                           ^^
                          !\ !
red -----o  o----\\\\-----! >!--- green
                          !  !

       SPST sw. .5-1.5K    LED

This circuit (with the LED) only works if it's connected in the right direc-
tion.  Phone wiring isn't always done right; before you wire this one in 
permanently, try switching the red and green wires, and leave it in the 
direction that works.


                ENJOY!

*      How to build a BLACK BOX       *
*                                     *
***************************************
 
  To all who dare --
 
     What is a BLACK BOX?   A BLACK BOX is  a device that is hooked up to  your
fone  that fixes your fone so that when you get a call,  the caller doesn't get
charged for the call.  This is good for calls  up to 1/2 hour,  after 1/2  hour
the Fone Co.  gets suspicious, and then you can guess what happens.
 
The way it works:
 
     What  this little beauty  does  is keep the line voltage from dropping  to
10v  when  you answer your  fone.   The line is insted kept at 36v and it  will
make  the  fone think that it is  still ringing while your talking.  The reason
for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the Fone CO. thinks that something is wrong
after 1/2 an hour of ringing.
 
     All  parts  are  available   Radio Shack.   Using the least possible parts
and arangement,  the cost is $0.98 !!!! And  that  is  parts for two  of  them!
Talk  about  a deal!   If you  want  to splurge  then  you can get a  small  PC
board,  and  a switch.   There are  two schematics  for this box,  one  is  for
most  normal fones.   The second one is for  fones  that don't  work  with  the
first.  It was made for use with a Bell Trimline touch tone fone.

Parts:  1 1.8k 1/2 watt resistor

You  may just have two wires which  you connect together for the switch.

very easy to hook up.

     Once you have hooked up all  the parts,  you must figure out what set of
wires  go to the line and which  go  to the fone.   This is because of the fact
that LED's must be put in, in a certain direction.  Depending  on which way you
put the LED is what controls what wires are for the line & fone.
 
How to find out:
 
     Hook  up the box in one  direction using one set of wires for line and the
other for fone.
 
*NOTE*  For Model I switch should be OFF.
*NOTE*  For Model ][ switch  should  be set to side connecting the led.
 
     Once  you have hooked it up,  then pick up the fone and see if the LED  is
on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If is  doesn't light then switch the wires
and try again.  Once you know which are which  then label  them.   *NOTE*  - If
neither  directions  worked  then  your switch was in the wrong position.   Now
lable   the   switch  in  its   current position as BOX ON.
 
How to use it:
 
     The purpose of this box is not  to poeple  who  call you so it would  make
sence  that  it  can only  be  used  to receive! calls.   When the box is  *ON*
then you may only recieve calls.   Your fone will ring like normal and the  LED
on  the box will flash.   If you answer the fone now, then the LED will
light and the caller will not be charged. Hang up  the fone after you  are done
talking like normal.   You will not  be able  to  get a dial-tone or call  when
the  box is on,  so turn the box  *OFF* for  normal calls.   I don't  recommend
that you leave it on all the  time,  as you don't want it to answer when Ma
Bell calls!
 

               Silver Boxing
 
 
How to build a SILVER box:
 
 
Tools and materials :  Soldering Iron, Solder,
Some 22 ga. wire, a SPDT switch, and a screwdriver.
 
 
1) Unscrew your phone (must be a touch tone, desk type)
2) Remove the mounted pad and take the clear plastic cover from the bottom.
3) Hold the pad with the numbers 0, *, # facing you, and turn it upside down,
   so you can see the yellow pc board.
4) You should see 2 black round doughnuts.
5) Position the board so the solder points for the left doughnut face you.
6) Count over four points from the left, and attach a (green) wire to that
   point.
7) Between you and the doughnuts, there should be 2 long yellow capacitors.
   To the right of these, and on the edge of the board there should be 3 gold
   contacts. We will use the one on the left.
8) The bontact originally is spot welded, so snip it open.
9) To the one nearest you, attach a (red) wire to the other one, a (yellow)
   wire.
10) Run the wires out of the phone, and solder the switch.
11) The orientation should be (red) to center.

The switch will now alternate between normal and 1633hz fourth column tones.
 

    HOW TO BUILD A HOLD BUTTON
 
I WILL DO THIS STEP BY STEP:
 
  1. YOU CAN EITHER DO THIS FROM THE
     OUTSIDE OR FROM THE INSIDE OF
     YOUR PHONE. FIRST TAKE THE RED
     AND GREEN WIRES AND STRIP DOWN
     A PIECE OF WIRE SO YOU CAN ADD
     ANOTHER PIECE OF WIRE TO IT.
 
 2.  ONCE YOU HAVE THE OTHER PIECE'S
     OF WIRE ADDED TO THEM GET A
     A TWO WAY TOGGLE SWITCH SO THAT
     YOU CAN SWITCH THEM FROM HOLD TO
     TALK POSITION
 
 3.  TAKE THE TWO EXTRA PIECES OF
     WIRE AND HOOK THE ONE THAT IS
     HOOKED TO THE GREEN TO ONE OF
     THE TERMINALS ON ONE SIDE AND
     THE RED WIRE TO THE OTHER SIDE
     OF THE TERMINAL
 
DIAGRAM:
 
  RED   GREEN
 
  BLACK  YELLOW
 
LEAVE THE RED AND GREEN HOOKED TO THERE TERMINALS IN THE BOX BUT JUST
RUN A WIRE FROM EACH OF THOSE TERMINALS AND HOOK ONE WIRE TO ONE
SIDE OF THE SWITCH AND THE OTHER WIRE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH
