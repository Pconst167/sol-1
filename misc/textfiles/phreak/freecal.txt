   The title is not so clear as one can think, beacouse it isn't free you
   have to pay your local tax for local call.
   This principe that i'm to describe is to call a telephone who is trnas-
   mitting further your call.
   Ok let's say that you have a company who's telephone box is in the out-
   side of the company.

 Then open the box and examine the connection paper, look for a line who
   is not used at the moment (Tex Office telephone in the middle of the
   night.) and connect your telephone to the cables and order:
   Futher Connection (- # 2 -) (Note this will only run with AXE system or
   system that uses futher connection).

   When you've done this, fix everything so it looks like untouched and go
   to your neighbour and open your street telephone box and connect your
   home line to your neghbour and put his telephone line to you.

   Now it's all set, it's only to dial the number to the telephone that you
   have fixed (You will see the number on the connection paper).
   When you've have called ready, go back and reorder Futher Connection.

   The telephone maybe not using AXE then you only order AXE.
   But beware you must look when the company have got their latest phone
   bill, so you don't get caught.
   Do not forget to Disconnect your neighbour from your phone !!!
   The phoning on the neighbour's phone line is a minor sequrity margin, if
   the telephone company should try to track you.
