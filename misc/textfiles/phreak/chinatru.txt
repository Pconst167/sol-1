        We are not sure how useful this will be anyone, since the majority of
these users do not possess blue boxes.  Oh well, c'est la vie, and on with the
fun.  Essentially, the blue box generates tones which are important to
telephone companies.  The most important tone being the 2600 Hz.  This is used
for seizing and giving up trunks.  Well, an interesting concept came up one day
when a few of the guys were screwing around at a local fortress phone.  We
decided to call 911 and blow a 2600.  The results were very bizarre.  The
effects of trunking a 911 can be tremendously damaging!  See, the 2600 blew 911
off its assigned trunk position.  Although we could not seize this for outdial,
we could play operator.  We played with the inwards for a time...then we hung
up and called back 911...a recording came up saying that 911 was not available
in this area and to call the police/ambulance/firehouse...(like the one
Richmond residents get)...that was very funny since only minutes ago, the 911
was functioning fine.  Well, we cruzed from this local and hit another phone.
DTMF'd 911 and got the same recording.  It seems that the area's 911 was
disabled for nearly 3 days.  They reassigned the trunk position I guess 2 days
after, then they had to resetup the equipment.  Oh well, that's the end.  We'll
upload some blue box plans soon.
