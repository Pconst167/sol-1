.
. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER CALLED A 976 DIALUP AND WERE FRUSTRATED DUE TO THE 2
1/2 - 3 MINUTE CUT-OFF, WELL NOW THERE IS A SOLUTION.  ON THE OPERATORS KEYPAD
THETE IS A BLACK KEY (ISOLATION KEY) AND A RED KEY (DISCONNECT KEY). HERE ARE
THE STEPS TO TELL THE OPERATOR TO DO.
. 1. ISOLATE ME. 2. AFTER I HANG UP PUSH THE ISOLATION KEY AGAIN (B-KEY)  3.
AFTER I CALL BACK PUSH THE RED BUTTON (DISCONNECT KEY)
. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU ARE CALLING BACK A AN EMPTY ISOLATED LINE AND THE
COMPUTER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE YOU AS A CALLER.
.
.
. HERE ARE SOME FRESH QUANTUM-LINK ACCOUNTS (THE FIRST PERSON TO THEM WILL HAVE
TO SET UP A BILLING ADDRESS ETC....)
. 64-5685-5082 20-3578-5690
. GENGHIS KHAN HERE IS THE CNA YOU HAVE WANTED FOR A WHILE, DIAL 201-621-1333
(YOU WILL REACH SECURITY) THEN OFF COURSE GIVE HER THE NUMBER THAT YOU WANT THE
NAME & ADDRES TO, TELL HER THAT YOU ARE CALLING FROM THE REPAIR CENTER, SHE
WILL ASK YOU FOR A NUMBER TO CALL YOU BACK (OFF COURSE GIVE HER A LOOP WHICH
YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE A CNA ON SO YOU KNOW WHAT COMPANY OR WHOEVER IT IS
REGISTERED ON), SHE MIGHT TRY TO SCREEN THE NUMBER AND IF YOU GIVE HER A FALSE
NAME SHE WILL KNOW AND SHE WILL GIVE YOU THE SHAFT. IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN THE CUSTOMARY CNA AND IT ISN'T CALLED CNA IT IS REFERED TO AS SECURITY (IT
GETS THE JOB DONE...), IF YOU NEED HELP LOGGING ON TO Q-LINK DIAL THERE 800
HELP LINE.
