This idea was originally done by Virus, A close friend of mine. All credit of
this idea goes to him. I was simply the tester and inhancer of this idea, I
found ways to make it better and work easier. I'll make this text an easy
format for all to follow and use. Here we go.

                              -= Needed: =-

 UHF/VHF T.V <with seperate knobs>
 Large antenna <or make one>
 Cordless phone

                            -= What it does =-

 What this thing will do, Is with the cordless phone, being ON, It will
attract the frequency that cordless/cellular phones use. The T.V transmits
this frequency throught its speaker,and allows you to RANDOMLY hear cordless/
cellular phone conversations. You cannot talk to the people you hear, and
they can't hear you either. This is a good way of scanning. If you can't
afford a BearCat Scanner ,and the like, This will work perfectly.

                           -= How to build it =-

 Take the T.V, Hook any type of wire, just regular wire to the UHF part of
 the T.V,in the back. Make sure the Cordless phone is ON, Just have it call
 a number that is always busy,Just make sure it's on. Next, Lean the cordless
 phone antenna to the T.V antenna <better reception>. Turn the T.V to channel
 83,82,or 81. It should be very static like,Turn the fine tuning dial until
 you reach very low static, Tune it in as clear as possible,Listen, Normally
 if it's really low, or no static in all, People will be talking. Every now
 and then it will just go blank and then static again, keep scanning.
 You'll find something.

                                -= Hints! =-

 #1 Use at night,like at 7-9pm. It's clearer,more people are on.
 #2 Also, If you got an old Antenna, Use it.
 #3 Longer antennas and wires help reception.
