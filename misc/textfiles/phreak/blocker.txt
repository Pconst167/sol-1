Hi Phreakers & Hackers out there,

I want to explain sum most important things to make BB for ya
easier..

At the moment most Telephone Companies around the globe are trying
more or less together to solve the C5 Problem..

Germany
-------
The German Telekom installed Blockers which are working with
the "Fast Forje Transformation" Principe. That means that the
2600/2400 Hertz FRQ's have a defined Energy when u send them
throw the line. The Blocker recogneize this and Blocks the
Tone. If you send additional "Irritating FRQ's" like for
Example 3000 Hertz, 400 Hertz.. the Energy of the 2600/2400
Hertz will go down and the Blocker doesnt recogneize that this
is a C5 Break Tone.

At the moment the Telekom is trieing to modify the Blocker System
also many Countries (Phillipines..) are installing new Blocker
Systems.

The German Telekom founded sum time ago and Special Department
for many Telephone Fraud Sections like: C5, PBX, Networks..
Right now they are analysing the Hacker Scene in Germany..

Because of the Fact, that the German Telekom is now a Private
Company, its going more flexibler and faster like an Government
Company.

The Future will show if they can block 100 % BB..

Sum Tips which u can check out (also in orther Countries):

1. The Volume is very important
2. Most Blockers around the Globe are working equal, only the
   Result when u send an Break Tone is different. That means
   if u send an Break Tone in Germany and the Blocker recogneizes
   that this is an Break Tone nothing will happen, if ya send in
   Chile this Tone you get a "Klick" from the Blocker and the Line
   is dead. At the first Time its irritating bud with sum practice
   u get a feeling for the different Situations..
3. Not every Line which looks like C7 is C7..
4. GOOD FRQ Scanners can help alot!
5. BE PATIENT!
6. DO NOT CALL IN DIGITAL TELEPHONESYSTEMS WITH MORE THEN 10 LINES
   (FOR BUSSINESS REASONS), u get 99% BUSTED!

I heard that Japan installed an "LOOP BLOCKER"(?) an that this
Blocker is unhackable, so if u are an JAPAN Phreaker and u get
it, leave me a message. I am very interested to know something
about that System. If you had any success in using Pink Noise
(TLO) leave me also a messy..

I dont want to give too exact Infos, bud I think that this little
Info text can help u a little..

DONT FORGET: N E V E R  COOPERATE WITH COPS OR TELECOMS !!!


L8r!
