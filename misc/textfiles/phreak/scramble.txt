                              Telephone Scrambler

                              -------------------

      \Protect your confidential telephone calls against intrusion with/
      \this easy-to-build scrambler.                                   /
Scrambling is the most effective method for eliminating unwanted evesdropping
on your confidential calls.  It should be considered if you have reason to
believe that unauthorized persons are or could be listening in.  A system
consisting of two compatible telephone scramblers will permit normal
conversation between you and your intended listener, while making all speech
unintelligible to anyone listening in at either end of the line.  Only persons
with a compatible unscrambler will be able to understand what is being said.

(Fig.1)

Complete telehpone security is obtained with a TVS250 at both ends of the
phone line forming a duplex scrambler/descrambler system.

:Circuit Design:
The COM9046 voice scrambler/descrambler IC contains a crystal oscillator that
that controls system timing.  The onchip oscillator requires an external 3.58-
MHz crystal that is commonly used in TV color-burst applications.  The chip
also contains switched-capacitor filters, so input speech must be filtered by
an anti-aliasing single-pole, low-pass filter before it is applied to the
audio input.

I recomend that you call and purchase a better diagram for the TVS250 from the
company listed above.  Remember, to make the scrambler work you must have two
TVS250's, one on the callers phone and another on the receivers phone.  I
haven't purchased a set yet, but this DOES work, information was gathered from
radio electronics.  So, it is a reliable source, not just another dumb text
file.  Good luck! ->BB<-
