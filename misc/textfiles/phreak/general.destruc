    About this file: This tfile, originally written by The Unknown Witness, 
has been re-edited, re-phrased, and re-styled, so that it appears to you in 80
columns, in lowercase, and in the "traditional" DOA format.  The file is being
restyled because we felt that it should be rereleased upon the instatement of
the Unknown Witness into DeadMan Operations and Activities.  So, we proudly
present to you a retyped issue of his infamous "General Destruction" series -
the issue that started it all - Volume One.

    J.L. Hudsons!  Bring a good, strong magnet with you, and head for the
clothing section... Look at the clothes on the rack, look at the tag...

     See that row of colons ^^ I drew?  Well, that represents the magnetic
strip which they use for invnetory purposes.  If you erase this strip with the
magnet, the cash register won't be able to read the tag and the lady will have
to enter the whole number... this gets very nasty if you erase the tags on 
almost every shirt, blouse, ect. in the store... most of the stuff has more
than one tag, be sure to erase both...

     Anywhere:  Bring a small screwdriver with you, find one of those
drinking fountains that has a cooling system, (it makes a humming sound every
so often, and there is a fan).. Reach underneath, behind it and find the 
coolant line that is the largest.  Next, find the little valve on it, it will
have a cap on it.  Remove the cap and you will see what looks like a bicycle-
type valve.  Poke it with the screwdriver until soem air is sucked into the 
system.. Then get out of there, the compressor will make some strange noises,
then will quit.  In a few minutes, it will cool off, and try to start again.
This cycle will destroy the compressor...ha.

     Restrooms:  Take the toilet paper and pull off a section about 4 feet
in length.  Stick it in the toilet the flush it down.. If you still have your
screwdriver, turn the water inlet valve to full - this is that valve on a 
normal toilet...

                      -------

     It's a little hard to understand, but it is usually capped, take off the
cap.  If you do it right, the whole roll of toilet paper will be gone in no
time - keep doing it 'til it floods...!

     Any Store!  Some stores have a security system that employs the use
of little plastic buttons, slips, or disks that are fastened to articles of
cloting.  Inside these articles are a piece of copperish-looking foil coated
with some green plastic marked, "Inventory Control - Property of the Store."
(In some cases, this piece of plastic is placed on a string all by itself..)

     Take this piece of plastic and do any of the following - drop it into a
bag or the pocket of another piece of clothing, (they won't be able to find it
but it will trigger the alarm all the time!).. Find a little kid standing all
by himself, and tell him it's a special magic card, and to keep it!  (Once he
leaves, the alarm will go off, and his parents will get busted..)  Or, of
course, you can drop it into the bag of another customer, that's always phun..

     Any Large Department Store:  Sometimes there are phones laying around
in unsupervised checkout booths, (like in hudson's or something), pick up the
phone, and dial a three digit number - this usually connects you with another
part of the store - after some real pranking around the whole store, you might
want to walk around and see what you've done; (usually, there will be a small
store directory taped into the handset, it always comes in handy.)

     The HardWare Department:  Find a small cylinder of methyl acetalyne
propeniene, (or the tradename "mapp"), and jam a small nail into the top, not 
allowing too much gas to escape at one time... The smell of the gas you will
soon find out is -->terrible<--  and if left around slowly releasing the gas,
it might cause an explosion, (if it is near the electrical and lighting dept),
or most likely it will cause some really pissed customers who smell the stuff;
it really smells bad!!

     Elevators:  Remember when your parents got pissed when you messed with
the buttons on an elevator?  Well, forget that - find the switch, usually a
pushtype, and turn it off when you are at a floor.  Most people don't know how
the hell to work it, and will get quite pissed...

     Also, push and stick one of the buttons down, (lets say the highest floor
so it is in a non-traffic area), with some gum or tape or a nail; the elevator
will always seek that floor when it's not being called by other floors - over
time, it becomes slower and slower...

     At A Large Department Store:  Find one of those brass disks on the
floor.. Stand on it and turn your whole body counter-clockwise to unscrew it.
Take a look inside, and you'll see a pair of wires that look very thin, there
is a good chance that those are serial register bus wires.  Strip them, (with
your handy-dandy swiss), and touch them together, if there is a small spark,
you're in luck.  If there is a large spark forget where you read this - this
will effectively knock out all the data transmissions from each register to
the master computer, depending on the setup, each register might go dead..
(What a mess...)
