4. Overview

        Bell systems has to keep up maintance of all phone lines and test them
too.. this means they had to make a point where the line man could easily
go and enter the customer's phone line. Though we have always seen this on 
a telephone poll, or a bell employee cutting open a large cord containg 
thousands of lines. There is an easier way. Bell also has metal boxes on the
ground that the bell employee's use to fix or monitor your line, and we use
to make calls from it.

5. How To Find The Bell Phone Box

        When many people think about box's they think of aqua boxes or blue
or any other color in existance.. I am simply talking about a metal or plastic
box that bell uses to hide and protect their equipment from the weather and
vandals. It is not really a box more a cylinder. In our part of the nation
it is plastic, about 3 feet high and has a large bell sticker on it 
explaining that it is against the law to use blah blah blah. It is usually
protected by a bolt on the bottom.. It can be unlocked with a 7/16 hex or 
cresent <your choice on the word> wrench.

6. Materials Needed

        1 7/16 Hex Wrench
        1 Pair Of Alligator Clips
        1 Phone Cord
        1 Roll Of Electrical Tape
        1 Phone

        Ok, Now Cut the phone cord and the cord running from the alligator
clips. Connect the Green and Yellow cord to one wire and connect the black
and red wires to the other. Make sure that the green and yellow and the
red and black wires are seperated and use some electrical tape to seal the
splice. Congratulations you know have the equipment needed to patch into a 
phone line.

7. How To Do It

        Ok, We have come to the point of the document when I tell the final
step. Go to the cylinder like phone box you have found. Use the 7/16 hex 
wrench to unbolt the bolt and slide the plastic cover off. In front of you
should be a long row of prongs on a stick. A close up would look somewhat
like this
                     _______________
                    /______________/|
                    |              ||
                    | -----------  ||
                    || /()\ /()\ | ||
                    ||           | ||
                    | -----------  ||
                    |              ||


        That is just one of the many prongs you should see.. Now look for a
a set of prongs that has wires running to it, that is a operating phone line.
Hook up the two alligator clips there.. One clip per prong. Hook the cord
to the phone <or laptop> you brought with you and check for a dial tone..
If you got one.. congratulations you have complete control over their phone
line. 

8. Some Suggestions On What To Do With It

        1: Call all the board or LD friends you may have.. Remember a simple
           102881(area code)(Number) will over ride any long distance 
           blocking.
        2: Call all those 1900 lines you see on television
        3: Call the AT&T Teleconfrencing Operater and set up a confrence for
           you and your friends around the US to talk on .. for free.. the
           number to call is 18005446363.. You will need to call an ANI first
           to find out the number you are calling from.
        4: Prank Call The Police.. tell them what you really think about them
           and watch the owners of the line get a visit by mama's little 
           piggie
