STUFF YOU'LL NEED:
------------------

A soldering iron
A spool of low resistance wire
2 female fone jacks
2 SPST toggle switches
4 gold plated alligator clips
A box to put it all in
Some solder
A brain

Here's a simple diagram of how it's put together

Assemble it as above, and put it in the box, with the toggle switches parallel,
and the female jacks mounted on either side of the box.  Or, if you don't want
to go to the trouble of making it by yourself, you can get one for $7.50 from
DLOC.  Ours are encased in a sturdy plastic box, with our logo stenciled on the
side, and are very well made.  If you want to buy one, contact a DLOC member on
one of the boards listed below in this file.


DLOC BOX FUNCTIONS:
-------------------

Hookup: To hook up the box, plug your fones into the jacks on the box.  On
_______ mine, the wires are labeled every foot so that I know which trunk I'm
        on.  Clip the appropriate set of clips on the terminals you wish to
invade, and then listen/dial through whichever phone is connected.  This box
has two lines going through it, with an option to conference the two.  I added
this so if while on Alliance Tele-conferencing, you want to dial an 800,900,
700, or 976 number, you can simply dial it with the other trunk and then
conference the two.


Conferencing the two lines: To join the two lines, turn both of the toggle
___________________________ switches to the on position.



Note: Make sure that no phone is connected to the box when you hook up the
_____ clips, and also make sure that both switches are turned off.
