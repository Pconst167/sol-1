This Box is quite similar to a Beige Box, except this is a portable unit.  It
is extremely handy for free voice calls and tapping a nearby house's line.
It's really easy to make so don't worry about it (unlike a Blue Box!).

 MATERIALS:     >-:->>  Two alligator clips
 __________    >-:->>   One-piece fone or normal fone (one piece is easier!)
                >-:->>  Soldering iron and some solder
               >-:->>   Some good wire

 PROCEDURE:
 __________


[1>  Cut the wire that connects the fone to the wall.  Inside there should be
    4 colored wires.  Yellow, red, green, and black.  If the wires are not
    colored, no need to get worried.  The two in the middle are red & green.
    Those are the 2 you need.

[2>  Make sure to keep about 1-2 feet of this wire connected to the fone unless
    you want to use the other wire listed above.  Now solder one alligator
    clip to the green wire, and one the red.

[3>  If you're using the other wire, strip the ends and solder one end to of
    each to the red and green on the fone, and one end to an alligator clip.

[4>  Go to a nearby house and locate the little gray box.  It's simple to
    find, look by the gas meter.  It should have the BELL logo on it.

[5>  To open this thing, put your hand underneath it and hit upward.  You
    should get contact with the bottom edge of it.

[6>  Now it should come open nice and easy.  Look inside and you will see five
    screws in this pattern:

                *     *

                   *

                *     *

[7>  The screw in the middle and the two on the left do nothing.  (Actually,
    you may want to check the two on the left, as some people have a second
    line hooked up to these two).  All you need to worry about are the two on
    the right.  The one in the top right-hand corner is usually the green, and
    the one in the bottom right-hand corner is usually the red.

[8>  Clip an alligator clip to the corresponding terminals (red to red, green
    to green.)  You should get a dial tone.  If you don't, switch the alligator
    clips around.  If you still don't get a dial tone (or someone's
    conversation!) then the line has probably been disconnected or the fone is
    off the hook.


 IDEAS OF USE FOR THE BUD BOX
 ____________________________


   Get a lot of wire and run it into your house.  Then you'll be an extension
   of that line.  The fone will ring and you can listen to everything that's
   going on the that line.

   You can call direct to any place using normal BELL service (gasp!). i.e.:
   1-702-831-4263.  The bill will be not be charged to you.  It will be charged
   to your neighbors (or whoever.)
