*  HOW TO BUILD AND USE A CHEESEBOX  *
**************************************

    A CHEESE BOX MAKES YOUR HOME TELEPHONE INTO A PAYPHONE.  THE METHOD SHOWN
BE
LOW IS AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT.

SUPPLIES NEEDED
-------- ------

ONE LINE THAT HAS CALL FORWARDING.

ONE RED BOX OR RECORDING OF RED BOX TONES.


   FIRST YOU NEED TO FIND OUT THE NUMBER TO THE INTERCEPT OPERATOR IN YOUR
PREFI
X.  WHEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER TO THE INTERCEPT OPERATOR THEN FORWARD ALL YOUR
CAL
LS TO HER.  THIS MAKES YOUR PHONE INOPERABLE UNTIL A QUARTER IS DEPOSITED i.e.
Y
OUR PHONE IS NOW A PAYPHONE.  AND TO MAKE CALLS OFF THIS LINE JUST GET YOUR RED
BOX OR BOOT UP THE CAT'S MEOW AND INSERT YOUR COINS THEN CALL.  ALSO YOU MUST
BE
WARE, AND NOT PHREAK OFF THIS LINE OR THEY WILL ASSUME IT IS A TROUBLED
FORTRESS
.  THEN THEY WILL SEND SOMEONE OUT TO STAKE OUT THE FORTRESS, AND THEN WELL
I'LL
 JUST SAY IT'LL BE PRETTY HAIRY!
