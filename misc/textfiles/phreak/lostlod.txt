    Did I get your attention? Good, everyone should read this. With the time 
effort and balls it has taken me compile this knowledge it is certainly worth 
your time. I hope you appreciate me taken the time to write this.     
    I should point out that the information in this file is correct to the   
best of my knowledge. I'm sure there are going to be people that disagree   
with me on some of it, particularly the references to tracing. However, I
have been involved in telecommunications and computers for 12+ years.   
    I'm basing this file around the 1AESS since it is the most common switch 
in use.    
 
     
     ** OUTSIDE PLANT **     
     
    This is the wiring between your telephone and the central office. That is 
another file in itself so if you are interested read Phucked Agent 04's file 
on outside loop in LOD tech. journal. The file explains those green boxes you 
see on street corners, aerial cables, manholes etc. So where that file stops, 
this file starts.     
     
     ** CABLE VAULT **     
     
     All of the cables from other offices and from subscribers enter the     
central office underground. They enter into a room called the cable vault.   
This is a room generally in the basement located at one end or another of the 
building. The width of the room varies but runs the entire length of the 
building. Outside cables appear though holes in the wall. The cables then run
up through holes in the ceiling to the frame room.     
     Understand that these cables consist of an average of 3600 pairs of    
wires. That's 3600 telephone line. The amount of cables obviously depends on 
the size of the office. All cables, interoffice, local lines, fiber optic,   
coaxial enter through the cable vault.     
     
     ** FRAME ROOM **     
     
     The frame is where the cable separates to individual pairs and attach to 
connectors. The frame runs the length of the building, from floor to ceiling. 
There are two sides to the frame, the horizontal side and the vertical side. 
The vertical side is where the outside wiring attaches and the protector
fuses reside. The horizontal side is where the connectors to the switching
system reside. Multi-conductor cables run from the connectors to actual
switching equipment. So what we have is a large frame called the Main
distribution frame (MDF) running the entire length of the building, floor to
ceiling 5 feet thick. The MDF consists of two sides, the VDF and the HDF.
Cables from outside connect on one side and cables from the switching
equipment connect to the other. Now, jumper wires connect the two. This way
any piece of equipment can be connected to any incoming "cable pair" These
jumper wires are simply 2 conductor twisted pair running between the VDF and
HDF.     
     What does all this mean? Well if you had access to COSMOS you would see 
information regarding cable and pair and "OE" or origanating equipment. With
this you could find your line on the frame and on the switch. The VDF side is     
clearly marked by cable and pair at the top of the frame, however the HDF    
side is a little more complicated and varies in format from frame to frame   
and from one switch to another. Since I am writing this file around the    
1AESS, I will describe the OE format used for that switch.     
     
    OE  ABB-CDD-EFF     
     
   Where..     
     
      A = Control group (when more than one switch exists in that C.O.)     
     
      B = LN  Line Link Network  
     
      C = LS  Line Switching Frame   
      
      D = CONC or concentrator     
     
      E = Switch (individual not the big one)     
     
      F = Level     
     
   There is one more frame designation called LOC or location. This gives the 
location of the connector block on the HDF side. Very simply, looking at the 
frame.

the MDF, being up to 100 feet long, and 20 feet high. Each "-" represents a  
connector block containing connections for 4X24 or 96 pairs.     
    So far I've covered how the wires get from you to the switching    
equipment. Now we get to the switching system itself.

    How much does a switch cost? A fully equipped 5ESS for a 40,000    
subscriber end office can cost well over 3 million dollars. Now you know why 
your phone bill is so much. Well...maybe you parents bill.     
    And now on to.....     
     
    ** The 1ESS and 1AESS **     
     
   This was the first switch of it's type placed into widespread use by Bell. 
Primarily an analog switch under digital control, the switch is no longer    
being manufactured. The 1ESS has been replaced by the 5ESS and other full
scale digital switches, however, it is still by far the most common switch
used in todays class 5 end offices.      
   The #1 and 1A use a crosspoint switching matrix similar to the X-bar.  
The primary switch used in the matrix is the fereed ( remreed in the 1A ).  
It is a two state magnetic alloy switch. It is basically a magnetic switch 
that does not require voltage to stay in it's present position. A voltage is 
only required to change the state of the switch.
   The No. 1 utilized a computer style common control and memory. Memory    
used by the #1 changed with technology, but most have been upgraded to RAM.  
Line scanners monitor the status of customer lines, crosspoint switches,
and all internal, outgoing, and incoming trunks, reporting their status to
the central control. The central control then either calls upon program or
call store memories to chose which crosspoints to activate for processing the 
call. The crosspoint matrixes are controlled via central pulse distributors 
which in turn are controlled by the central control via data buses. All of  
the scanners, AMA tape controllers, pulse distro, x-point matrix, etc., listen 
to data buses for their address and command or report their information on   
the buses. The buses are merely cables connecting the different units to the 
central control.      
   The 1E was quickly replaced by the 1A due to advances in technology. So   
1A's are more common, also many of the 1E's have been upgraded to a 1A.     
This meant changing the fereed to the remreed relay, adding additional      
peripheral component controllers (to free up central controller load) and    
implementation of the 1A processor. The 1A processor replaced older style   
electronics with integrated circuits. Both switches operate similarly.     
The primary differences were speed and capacity. The #1ESS could process    
110,000 calls per hour and serve 128,000.00 lines.     
    Most of the major common control elements are either fully or partially  
duplicated to ensure reliability. Systems run simultaneously and are checked 
against each other for errors. When a problem occurs the system will double  
check, reroute or switch over to auxiliary to continue system operation.     
Alarms are also reported to the maintenance console and are in turn printed  
out on a printer near the control console.     
    Operation of the switch is done through the Master Control Center (MCC)  
panel and or a terminal. Remote operation is also done through input/output  
channels. These channels have different functions and therefore receive     
different types of output messages and have different abilities as far what  
type of commands they are allowed to issue. Here is a list of the commonly   
used TTY channels.     
     
   Maintenance    Primary chan. for testing, enable, disable etc.     
   Recent Change  Changes in class of service, calling features etc.     
   Administrative Traffic information and control     
   Supplementary  Traffic information supplied to automatic network control 
   SCC Maint.     Switching control centers interface     
   Plant Serv.Cent. Reports testing information to test facilities     
     
    At the end of this file you will find a list of the most frequently seen 
Maintenance channel output messages and a brief description of it's meaning. 
You will also find a list of frequently used input messages.     
    There are other channels as well as back ups but the only ones to be     
concerned with are Recent Change and SCC maint. These are the two channels   
you will most likely want to get access to. The Maintenance chan. doesn't    
leave the C.O. and is used by switch engineers as the primary way of    
controlling the switch. During off hours and weekends the control of the    
switch is transferred to the SCC.     
    The SCC is a centrally located bureau that has up to 16 switches    
reporting to it via their SCC maint. channel. The SCC has a mini computer    
running SCCS that watches the output of all these switches for trouble    
conditions that require immediate attention. The SCC personnel then has the  
ability to input messages to that particular switch to try and correct the   
problem. If necessary, someone will be dispatched to the C.O. to correct the 
problem. I should also mention that the SCC mini, SCCS has dialups and access 
to SCCS means access to all the switches connected to it.     
    The Recent Change channels also connect to a centrally located bureau    
referred to as RCMAC. These bureaus are responsible for activating lines,    
changing class of service etc. RCMAC has been automated to a large degree by 
computer systems that log into COSMOS and look for pending orders. COSMOS is 
basically a order placement and record keeping system for central office   
equipment, but you should know that already, right? So this system, called   
MIZAR logs into COSMOS, pulls orders requiring recent change work, then in
one batch several times a day, transmits the orders to the appropriate switch
via it's Recent Change Channel.    
    Testing of the switch is done by many different methods. Bell Labs has   
developed a number of systems, many accomplishing the same functions. I will 
only attempt to cover the ones I know fairly well.     
    The primary testing system is the trunk test panels located at the switch 
itself. There are three and they all pretty much do the same thing, test     
trunk and line paths through the switch.     
     
         Trunk and Line Test Panel     
         Supplementary Trunk Test Panel     
         Manual Trunk Test Panel       
     
    MLT Mechanized Loop Testing is another popular one. This system often    
available through the LMOS data base can give very specific measurements of  
line levels and loses. The "TV Mask" is also popular giving the user the     
ability to monitor lines via a call back number.     
    DAMT Direct Access Mechanized Testing is used by line repairman to put   
tone on numbers to help them find lines. This was previously done by Frame   
personnel, so this automated that task. DAMT can also monitor lines, however 
the audio is scrambled in a manor that allows one only to tell what type of  
signal is present on the line, or whether it is busy or not.     
    All of these testing systems have one thing in common, they access the   
line through a "No Test Trunk". This is a relay (in the 1ESS) which can drop
in on a specific path or line and connect it to the testing device. 
The test trunks are part of the switch itself and act like a telephone line 
into the switch. The function of this line is strictly for access and testing
of subscriber lines.It depends on the device connected to the trunk, but 
there is usually a noticeable click heard on the tested line when the No Test
Trunk drops in. Also the testing devices I have mentioned here will seize the
line, busying it out. This will present problems when trying to monitor 
calls, you would need to drop in on calls during the call. The No Test Trunk 
is also the method in which operator consoles due verifications and 
interrupts.    
     
     
    ** INTEROFFICE SIGNALLING     
    
    Calls coming into and leaving the switch are routed via trunks. The     
switches selects which trunk will route the call most effectively and then   
retransmits the dialed number to the distant switch. There are several     
different ways this is done. The two most common are Loop Signaling and CCIS, 
Common Channel Interoffice signaling. The predecessor to both of these is the 
famous and almost extinct "SF Signaling". This utilized the presence of     
2600hz to indicate trunk in use. If one winks 2600hz down one of these
trunks, the distant switch would think you hung up. Remove the 2600, and you
have control of the trunk and you could then MF your own number. This worked
great for years. Assuming you had dialed a toll free number to begin with,
there was no billing generated at all. The 1AESS does have a program called
SIGI that looks for any 2600 winks after the original connection of a toll
call. It then proceeds to record on AMA and output any MF digits received.
However due to many long distant carriers using signaling that can generate
these messages it is often overlooked and "SIG IRR" output messages are quite 
common.     
    Loop signaling still uses MF to transmit the called number to distant    
switch, however, the polarity of the voltage on the trunk is reversed to     
indicate trunk use.     
    CCIS sometimes referred to CCS#6 uses a separate data link sending    
packets of data containing information regarding outgoing calls. The distant 
switch monitors the information and connects the correct trunk to correct   
path. This is a faster and more efficient way of call processing and is being 
implemented all over. The protocol that AT+T uses is CCS7 and is currently   
being accepted as the industry standard. CCS6 and CCS7 are somewhat similar. 
    Interoffice trunks are multiplexed together onto one pair. The standard  
is 24 channels per pair. This is called T-1 in it's analog format and D-1    
in its digital format. This is often referred to as carrier or CXR. The terms 
frame error and phase jitter are part of this technology which is often a    
world in itself. This type of transmission is effective for only a few miles 
on twisted pair. It is often common to see interoffice repeaters in manholes 
or special huts. Repeaters can also be found within C.O.s, amplifying trunks 
between offices. This equipment is usually handled by the "carrier" room.   
Often on another floor. Carrier also handles special circuits, private lines 
and foreign exchange circuits.    
     After a call reaches a Toll Switch, the transmit and receive paths of
the calling and called party are separated and transmitted on separate
channels. This allows better transmission results and allows more calls to be
placed on any given trunk. This is referred to as 4 wire switching. This
also explains why during a call, one person can hear crosstalk and the other
can't. Crosstalk is bleed over from other channels on the multiplexed
T-Carrier transmission lines used between switches.   
    
    ** CALL TRACING    
    
    So with Loop signaling standard format there is no information being    
transmitted regarding the calling number between switches. This therefore    
causes the call tracing routine to be at least a two step method. This is    
assuming you are trying to trace an anticipated call, not one in progress.   
When call trace "CLID" is placed on a number, a message is output every time 
someone calls that number. The message shows up on most of the ESS output    
channels and gives information regarding the time and the number of the    
incoming trunk group. If the call came from within that office, then the    
calling number is printed in the message. Once the trunk group is known, it  
can usually be determined what C.O. the calls are coming from. This is also  
assuming that the calls are coming from within that Bell company and not    
through a long distance carrier (IEC). So if Bell knows what C.O. the calls  
are coming from, they simply put the called number on the C.I. list of that  
C.O. Anytime anyone in that C.O. calls the number in question another message 
is generated showing all the pertinent information.    
    Now if this where a real time trace, it would only require the assistance 
of the SCC and a few commands sent to the appropriate switches (i.e.    
NET-LINE). This would give them the path and trunk group numbers of the call 
in progress. Naturally the more things the call is going through, the more   
people that will need to be involved in the trace. There seems to be a common 
misconception about the ability to trace a call through some of the larger   
packet networks i.e. Telenet. Well I can assure you, Telenet can track a call 
through there network in seconds and all that is needed is the cooperation of 
the Bell companies. Call tracing in itself it not that difficult these days. 
What is difficult is getting the different organizations together to    
cooperate. You have to be doing something relatively serious to warrant    
tracing in most cases, however, not always. So if tracing is a concern, I    
would recommend using as many different companies at one time as you think is 
necessary, especially US sprint, they can't even bill people on time much    
less trace a call. But..it is not recommended to call sprint direct, more in 
the equal access section.    
     
    ** EQUAL ACCESS     
      
    The first thing you need to understand is that every IEC Inter Exchange  
Carrier (long distance company) needs to have an agreement with every LEC   
Local Exchange Carrier (your local phone company) that they want to have
access to and from. They have to pay the LEC for the type of service they
receive and the amount of trunks, and trunk use. The cost is high and the
market is a zoo. The LECs have the following options.  
  
     - Feature Group A -   
    This was the first access form offered to the IECs by the LECs. Basically 
whenever you access a IEC by dialing a regular 7 digit number (POTS line)
this is FGA. The IECs' equipment would answer the line interpret your digits
and route your call over their own network. Then they would pick up an
outgoing telephone line in the city you were calling and dial your number
locally. Basically a dial in, dial out situation similar to PC pursuit.   
   
     - Feature Group B -   
     FGB is 950-xxxx. This is a very different setup from FGA. When you dial 
950, your local switch routes the call to the closest Access Tandem (Toll   
Switch) in your area. There the IECs have direct trunks connected between the 
AT and their equipment. These trunks usually use a form of multiplexing like 
T-1 carrier with wink start (2600hz). On the incoming side, calls coming in
from the IEC are basically connected the same way. The IEC MFs into the AT
and the AT then connects the calls. There are alot of deferent ways FGB is
technically setup, but this is the most common.     
     Tracing on 950 calls has been an area of controversy and I would like to 
clear it up. The answer is yes, it is possible. But like I mentioned earlier, 
it would take considerable manpower which equals expensive to do this. It
also really depends on how the IEC interface is set up. Many IECs have
trunks going directly to class 5 end offices. So, if you are using a small
IEC, and they figure out what C.O. you are calling from, it wouldn't be out
of the question to put CLID on the 950 number. This is highly unlikely and I
have not heard from reliable sources of it ever being done. Remember, CLID
generates a message every time a call is placed to that number. Excessive
call trace messages can crash a switch. However, I should mention that brut
force hacking of 950s is easily detected and relatively easy to trace. If the
IEC is really have a problem in a particular area they will pursue it.    

     - Feature Group C -   
     FGC is reserved for and used exclusively by AT+T.   
   
     - Feature Group D -   
     FGD is similar to FGB with the exception that ANI is MFed to the IEC.   
The end office switch must have Equal Access capability in order to transmit 
the ANI. Anything above a X-bar can have it. I guess I should mention that 
it is possible for a X-bar to have it with modifications.FGD can only be 
implemented on 800 numbers and if an IEC wants it, they have to buy the whole
prefix. For a list of FGD prefixes see LOD tech journal. You should also be 
aware that MCI, Sprint and AT+T are offering a service where they will 
transmit the ANI to the customer as well. You will find this being used as a 
security or marketing tool by an increasing amount of companies. A good 
example would be 800-999-CHAT.

    There are many things I didn't cover in this file and many of the
things I covered, I did so very briefly. My intention was to write a file
that explains the big picture, how everything fits together. I hope I helped. 

    
    Special thanks to all the stupid people, for without them some of us  
wouldn't be so smart and might have to work for a living. Also special thanks 
to John and Dave. For without their guidance, this file would have never been
written. Yes people their are great hackers out their that no one has ever 
heard of. You just have to know where to find them.And all the usual Bell 
Labs, AT+T bla bla bla etc. etc.   
  
   
    I can usually be reached on any respectable board, ha!
