***PLAID BOX PLANS***


INTRODUCTION

     HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A TOUCH TONE CHARGE ON YOUR PHONE BILL AND WONDER WHY THE PHONE COMPANY IS CHARGING YOU FOR TOUCH TONE WHEN THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE IN YOUR PREFIX?  IF YOU'VE EVER CONNECTED UP A TOUCH TONE PHONE, YOU'LL NOTICE IT DOESN'T WORK ON THE LINE,  BUT A PULSE PHONE DOES.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE RING AND TIP LINES ARE REVERSED!  SO ALL MA BELL DOES IS SWITCH THE TWO LINES AROUND AND--PRESTO--YOU NOW HAVE A TOUCH TONE-CAPABLE LINE, AND A MONTHLY CHARGE TO GO WITH IT.
  TO GET AROUND THIS, YOU JUST SIMPLY SWITCH THE LINES AT YOUR PHONE JACK, AND THEN YOUR LINE IS TOUCH TONE READY.

GETTING STARTED

     FIRST OFF, GATHER THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS:

1 - MODULAR TELEPHONE CABLE
1FT RED WIRE
1FT GREEN WIRE
SOLDERING IRON OR TAPE

TAKE THE CABLE AND CUT IT IN HALF.  STRIP OFF THE INSULATION FROM BOTH SIDES OF
THE CABLE, REVEALING FOUR WIRES COLORED BROWN, GREEN, RED, AND YELLOW (YOU MAY JUST HAVE THE RED AND GREEN WIRES).  STRIP THE RED AND GREEN WIRES AND CONNECT THE RED WIRE FROM ONE CORD HALF TO THE GREEN WIRE USING THE RED WIRE.  THEN CONNECT THE GREEN WIRE TO THE RED WIRE ON THE OTHER CORD HALF USING THE GREEN WIRE.  IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION ON THE LINE, RECONNECT THE BROWN AND YELLOW WIRES.

                         RED       RED   GREEN   RED
                   !====!-------------\ /-----------!====!
                   !JACK!              X            !JACK!
                   !====!-------------/ \-----------!====!
                         GREEN   GREEN   RED   GREEN

CONCLUSION

     THE PLAID BOX IS NOW COMPLETE.  IT IT DOES NOT WORK, CHECK THE WIRING AND MAKE SURE THE WIRES ARE TAPED OR SOLDERED TOGETHER SO THEY ARE CONNECTING.  TO USE IT, JUST PLUG IT IN BETWEEN YOUR PHONE AND THE WALL SOCKET.
