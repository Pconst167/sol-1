 HOW TO BUILD A SILVER BOX

 MATERIALS :  Soldering iron and solder
              22 ga. wire
              SPDT switch
              screwdriver

 PROCEDURE

1) Unscrew your phone (must be a touch tone, desk type)

2) Remove the mounted pad and take the clear plastic cover from the bottom.

3) Hold the pad with the numbers 0, *, # facing you, and turn it upside down,
   so you can see the yellow pc board.

4) You should see 2 black round doughnuts.

5) Position the board so the solder points for the left doughnut face you.

6) Count over four points from the left, and attach a (green) wire to that
   point.

7) Between you and the doughnuts, there should be 2 long yellow capacitors.
   To the right of these, and on the edge of the board there should be 3 gold
   contacts.  We will use the one on the left.

8) The contact originally is spot welded, so snip it open.

9) To the one nearest you, attach a (red) wire; to the other one, a (yellow)
   wire.

10) Run the wires out of the phone, and solder the switch.

11) The orientation should be (red) to center.  The switch will now alternate
    between normal and 1633hz fourth column tones.
