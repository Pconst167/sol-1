  In answer to all those who don't know what an infinity transmitter is, here
is A little history:

   A guy by the name Manny Mittleman ran a company called the wireless guitar
company located on Liberty St. In NY. Aside from wireless guitars, Manny also
built all sorts of electronic wireless bugs".  One item, The infinity
transmitter was a device that was place inside an unsuspecting persons
telephone.

  When the phone number of that telephone was dialed and a certain note was
blown into the phone from a hohner, key of-c, harmonica, the bugged phone did
not ring, and what's more, enabled the caller to then hear everything said in
he room that the phone was located in. As long as the caller wanted to stay
on the phone, all was open to him or her.  If the phone was lifted off the
hook, the transmitter was disconected and the "bugged" party received a dial
tone as if nothing was wrong with the line.

  Remember, all this was constructed in the 1960x's when ic's were not as
commonplace as they are today.  Also bear in mind that during that period in
time, even the telephone company was not quite sure on how well or how
portable tone decoding was.

Ps.  Many government agency's were some of manny's best customers.
