This article will tell you how to change a normal touch tone
keypad and convert it to a portable unit. In addition, we
give the touch-tone frequencies.
 
First of all, the tones made by a touch tone telephone are not
single tones, they are a combination of two tones, making "DTMF"
(dual tone multi-frequency). The normal tone telephone dials 12
different signals, but is capable of dialing 16 different signals
(see bulletin on silver boxes).
 
The power required by a keypad is about 25 volts, but they will
work with as little as 15, thereby allowing the use of two 9-
volt radio batteries.  As you may have guessed, they are also
designed to operate with a telephone type speaker (and phone
line), and not the standard 8-ohm speaker which needs to be used
for adequate volume.  To accompolish this, we use a matching
transformer, this is one of those miniature ones available at
Radio Shack.  Enough of the theory, now for the circuit.
 
You will need:
 
A touch tone keypad
A miniature 1000 to 8 ohm transformer (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
A standard 8-ohm speaker
Two 9-volt radio batteries
Two 9-volt battery clips
A case to put it all in (optional)
 
A few construction notes, I suggest that you solder and tape all
connections.  It is also important to read this entire bulletin
before attempting to construct this.
 
First, connect the RED wire of the transformer to either
terminal on the speaker.  Now connect the WHITE wire from the
transformer to the other terminal on the speaker.  Next, connect
the RED (positive) wire of one battery clip to the black wire of
the other battery clip.  Now connect the the remaining RED wire
on the second battery clip to the GREEN wire from the touch tone
pad.  Connect the BLUE wire from the touch tone pad to the
ORANGE-and-BLACK striped wire from the touch tone pad.  To these
two wires, now connect the remaining black lead from first
battery clip.  You have now finished the power connection to the
keypad.  Connect the BLACK wire from the keypad to the BLUE wire
on the transformer.  Next connect the RED-and-GREEN striped wire
from the keypad to the GREEN wire on the transformer.  The BLACK
wire on the transformer should not be connected to anything,
along with quite a few wires from the keypad.  The connection of
the keypad is now complete.  All you have to do is connect two
nine volt batteries to the battery clips, and you'll be ready to
go. You may want to mount it in a case for easy portability.
Note that the silver box modification CAN be made to this unit,
allowing complete remote phreaking.  When none of the buttons
are pressed, this unit uses NO power, thereby eliminating the
need for a power switch, and extending the life of the
batteries.
 
The following are the frequency combinations generated by each
button on the keypad.
