 Okay, sometimes when you are fone phreaking, inside a building or house you can use something to connect your phone cable to another phone cable. I KNOW this is not the most useful tool in the world but if you can't get to the phone jack, and the cable is like 2 inches, you're screwed.

 Okay, this isn't as easy as the busy box, or the budbox, but it can be pretty usefull if you've got a puter you want to hook up to the fone. (a palmtop or laptop) The point of hooking a puter up to it is to a: keep yourself from getting traced, and B: if its over a state line =, you don't get the fone charge :) So doing this cuts your chances of getting caught by a whole lot.
 
           ****************

 Step one:  Parts.
 
 Generally you need two fones with the little part where the fone cord goes into the fone, every fone has one. You take them out and you've got two parts that look like this:

        ****
           =*
           =*
        ****
Or something similar. But the important thing is you've got two of those off the phone and ready for your use. 
 
 Now you need a fone cord. Stri it so you've got about an inch or two of the Red, Green (not so important but here it is..) Black, and Yellow wires. With these, attach them to teh red, green, yellow, and black wires or metal exerts coming out of your two fone jacks. (diagram above)

 Once attached to BOTH of the jacks, your done, you just need to fasten the two so the wire doesn't snap or break, just use some electrical or duck tape, no big deal. It might look crappy but in the end you've got this: (without the tape)

       ****     ****
          =*===*=     
          =*===*=
       ****  \  ****
         \    \
          \    \
           Jack \
                 Yellow, Black, Green + Red 
 
 Now if you did this right, you should be able to connect the two together. Merry christmas. You've made the X-Box. 

  Happy Phreaking you freaks.
