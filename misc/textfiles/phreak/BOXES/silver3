		HOW TO
	BUILD AND USE SILVER BOX
=======================================

ATTENTION:
  BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLDER!  THIS COULD PERMENANTLY DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!!!
READ EVERYTHING BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
INGREADIENTS:
     1    BLUE WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT.
     1    GRAY WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT.
     1    BROWN WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT. (BETTER TO OVERKILL....)
     1    SINGLE POLE/DOUBLE THROW (SPDT) SWITCH. (SMALLEST YOU CAN FIND.)
     1    STANDARD BELL PHONE.

TOOLS:
     1    SOLDERING IRON AND SOLDER.
     1    FLAT-TIP SCREWDRIVER.
     1    VERY PATCIENT PERSON.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1:   TAKE THE CASING OFF YOUR PHONE BY LOOSENING THE TWO SCREWS UNDERNEATH IT.
     (DON'T TAKE THE SCREWS ALL THE WAY OFF!)
2:   LOOSEN (BUT DON'T REMOVE) THE SCREWS ON THE SIDE OF THE TOUCH- TONE
     KEYPAD. (THE ONES THAT ATTACH IT TO THE MOUNTING BRACKET.) AND CAREFULLY
     REMOVE THE KEYPAD FROM THE MOUNTING BRACKET.
3:   YOU WILL NOTICE A PLASTIC COVER ON THE KEYPAD; SEPERATE THE TWO HALVES AND
     GET THE OUT OF YOUR WAY. (DON'T DESTROY THEM, YOU WILL NEED THEM LATER.)
4:   NOW, LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE PAD (SO THE 123 ROW IS FACING AWAY, AND THE
     *0# ROW IS TOWARD YOU. TURN OVER THE KEYPAD. YOU SHOULD SEE A MASS OF
     WIRES, GOLD PLATED CONTACTS, DISCRETE COMPONENTS, AND TWO LARGE DOUGHNUT
     SHAPED BLACK THINGIES. (THESE ARE THE COILS HAT MAKE THE TOUCH-TONE
     FREQUENCIES. ALL YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS CONNECT THE WIRES THAT MA BELL
     "FORGOT" TO.)
5:   LOOK AT THE COIL ON THE LEFT (WITH 5 SOLDER CONTACTS FACING YOU, RATHER
     THAN BEING PERPENDICULAR TO YOU.) COUNT OVER 4 CONTACTS FROM THE LEFT (OR
     2 CONACTS FROM THE RIGHT) AND SOLDER THE GRAY WIRE TO THE FOURTH POST FROM
     THE LEFT.
6:   SOLDER THE OTHER END OF THE GRAY WIRE TO THE LEFT POLE OF THE SPDT SWITCH.
7:   (THE POINT OF NO RETURN)... TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE KEYPAD.
     YOU SHOULD SEE A ROW OF THREE GOLD PLATED CONTACTS (TO THE RIGHT OF TWO
     VERY LARGE CAPASITORS) LOOK AT THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND GENTELY SEPERATE
     THE TWO TOUCHING CONNECTORS (THEY ARE SOLDERED TOGETHER WITH A DROP OF
     SOLDER) AND SPREAD THEM APART.
8:   SOLDER THE BROWN WIRE TO THE TOP CONTACT (THE ONE FUTHEST FROM YOU), AND
     SOLDER IT TO THE RIGHT POLE OF SPDT SWITCH.
9:   NOW, TAKE THE BLUE WIRE AND SOLDER IT TO THE BOTTOM (CLOSEST) CONTACT.
     SOLDER THE OTHER END OF THIS WIRE TO THE CENTER POLE OF SPDT SWITCH.
10:  NOW PUT YOU PHONE BACK TOGETHER. (TO MAKE IT LOOK PROFESSONAL, MAKE A HOLE
     IN THE PLASTIC TOP OF YOUR PHONE AND STICK THE SPDT SWITCH THROUGH IT.

  NOW, (HOPEFULLY) WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN ON POSITION YOU WILL HAVE A NORMAL
PHONE AND WHEN IT IS IN THE OTHER POSITION THE 3, 6, 9, AND # KEYS (WHICH ARE
NOW THE A, B, C, AND D KEYS) WILL MAGICALLY PRODUCE THE SILVER BOX TONES!

    -=%>USAGE OF A SILVER BOX<%=-

  FIRST OFF, A SILVER BOX ADDS THE FOUR EXTRA TONES TO YOUR PHONE THAT MA BELL
NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT. THEY GO LIKE THIS:

	       1  2  3  A
	       4  5  6  B
	       7  8  9  C
	       *  0  #  D

  THERE USED TO BE MANY PLACES WERE YOU COULD USE SILVER BOX TONES, BUT NOW YOU
CAN ONLY USE IT IN PLACES WERE MA BELL HASN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO REPLACING HERE
OLD SWITCHBOXES, (4A), OR ON AUTOVAN. AUTOVAN IS A SPECIAL MILITARY PHONE LINE,
LIKE A MASS OF PRIVATE LINES HOOKED TOGETHER (I THINK, BUT I'M NOT SURE).
  TO SEE IF A SPECIFIC AREA HAS THE OLD 4A SWITCHBOXES TRY THIS TEST:
  CALL UP THERE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE BY USING XXX-555-1212, (WHERE XXX IS THE
AREA CODE YOU ARE CHECK OUT. NOW HOLD DOWN THE "D" KEY AS SOON AS YOU FINISH
DIALING. (IF YOU ARE USING THE SILVER BOX THAT I SHOWED YOU HOW TO MAKE; SWITCH
TO SILVER BOX TONES AND HOLD DOWN THE "#" KEY.) THE PHONE SHOULD START RINGING
AND THE OPERATOR WILL ANSWER.
  IF THE OPERATOR SCREAMS AT YOU TO STOP PRESSING YOUR KEYPAD, THEN HANG UP AND
TRY A DIFFRENT AREACODE. (THIS ONE DOES NOT WORK.)
  IF YOU GET A PULSING TONE THE YOU GOT A GOOD LINE! NOW TRY OUT DIFFERENT
NUMBERS. 6 AND 7 USUALLY FORM A LOOP LINE AND TWO PEOPLE WITH SILVER BOXES CAN
TALK. BUT SOME OF THESE ARE WHATCHED, SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING YOU WOULDN'T WANT
YOUR MOTHER TO HEAR!
  I HAVE HEARD THE 213 WORKS BUT IS BEING WATCHED. TRY OUT OF THE WAY STATES
LIKE IOWA, MONATANA, WYOMING, ECT...
