
How To Build a Silver Box
-------------------------

tools and materials :  soldering iron, solder, some 22 ga. wire, a spdt
switch, and a screwdriver.

(1) unscrew your phone (must be a touch
tone, desk type)
(2) remove the mounted pad and take the
clear plastic cover from the bottom.
(3) hold the pad with the numbers 0, *,
# facing you, and turn it upside down,
so you can see the yellow pc board.
(4) you should see 2 black round
doughnuts.
(5) position the board so the solder
points for the left doughnut face you.
(6) count over four points from the
left, and attach a (green) wire to that
point.
(7) between you and the doughnuts,
there should be 2 long yellow
capacitors.  to the right of these, and
on the edge of the board there should
be 3 gold contacts. we will use the one
on the left.
(8) the contact originally is spot
welded, so snip it open.
(9) to the one nearest you, attach a
wires out of the phone,
and solder the switch.
(11) the orientation should be (red) to
center. the switch will now alternate
between normal and 1633hz fourth
column tones.

         Silver Box Documentation
       (contributed by lex luthor)
the silver box transforms keys 3,6,9,# to a,b,c,d. those tones stand for:

"a"-flash
"b"-flash override (priority)
"c"-priority communication
"d"-priority overide (top military)

those keys only work on certain networks. Now what do you do with those
extra tones???

call any long distance directory by dialing (area code) 555-1212 and while
it rings press the # key then as the operator answers you will disconnect
them instantly and hear a pulsing tone, press 6(normal tone) and it will
stop.then if another person does the same thing on another line and then
presses 7 you should have a voice link, area code 414 is good for one that
you can screw around with the tones and see what you get.
