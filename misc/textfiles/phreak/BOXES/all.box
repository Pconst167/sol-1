  Ok the purpose of this box is to get Three-Way-Calling, Call Waiting,
  programmable Call Forwarding, and an easier way of extended Bud Boxing ALL for
  FREE.


  Materials:

  1) Wire stripers
  2) Couple Feet Wire
  3) AT&T/BELL Can
  4) Hex Wrench


  Idea: Ok the idea of this box is to get all of the above features by stealing
  them from the fortunate ones on your block.

  Procedure:

  Step 1) Find AT&T/BELL Can that is being used to service you surrounding area.

  Step 2) Open can with Hex wrench.

  Step 3) Find your line and another persons line who has 3-way, Call
  (waiting/forwarding), if the # of all the lines are not listed in the box you
  will have to use your local ANI to find them.

  Step 4) Once you have found the lines then wire the (Black & Yellow) wires on
  the victims line to the (Black & Yellow) wires on you line (Be sure your phone
  at home uses all 4 wire as some of the cheap phones don't).

  Step 5) Then disconnect the victims (Black & Yellow) Wires, resulting the the
  loss of these features to their line ( you mat want to leave these wires
  connected, this may or may not cause problems I haven't tried it that may yet)
.


  Well That Sums It Up!


  Procedure for easier extended Bud Box.

  If if for some reason your line is disconnected, or you just want to use hook
  someone's line to your line for fearless phreaking follow the procedure below.

  Ok Go to the local can and find a line that is used by weekend visitors or a
  summer/winter home, and hook their (Red & Green) Wires to your (Red & Green)
  Wires, and your off into the fearless world of phreaking ( i recommend you
  phreak from these line, so that the owners don't get uptight and look into the
  matter), unless of course you are doing it for revenge!


  Some Suggestions:

  Take a Bud box Along to do a ANI just to make sure you have the right line,
  also in some cases you will have to switch between the (Red/Green)
  (Black/Yellow) or any other combination  if your area has changed the standard
  format which id very unlikely.

  Have Fun


                          And Call /\/\aharaja's Hi-Times

  /-/   Building The Aqua Box   /-/
  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

     Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreaded F.B.I. 'Lock in Trace.'
  For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the lock in trace.
  This box does offer an escape route with simple directions to it.This
  box is quite a simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic
  electronics knowledge can construct and use it.

  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
  /-/    The Lock     /-/
  /-/    in Trace     /-/
  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

      A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone
  users location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress.
  For those of you who are not familiar with the concept of 'locking in',
   then here's a brief description.


       The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation, sort of like a three-way call
  connection. Then, when they get there, they can plug electricity into the
  phone line. All phone connections are held open by a certain voltage of
  electricity, that is why kou sometimes get static and faint connections
  when you are calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping
  the lineup. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate
  that same voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang
  up, voltage is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was
  calling you even after you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should
  understand better about that, for call waiting intercepts the electricity
  and makes a tone that means someone is going through your line. Then, it
  is a matter of which voltage is higher. When you push down the receiver,
  then it see-saws the electricity to the other side. When you have a person
  on each line it is impossible to hang up unless one or both of them will
  hang up. If you try to hang up, voltage is retained, and your phone will
  ring. That should give you an understanding of how calling works, also.
  When electricity passes through a certain point on your phone, the
  electricity causes a bell to ring or on some newer phones an electronic
  ring to sound.)

     So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the voltage
  level on your phone line. You should know that every time someone else
  picks up the phone line, then the voltage does decrease a little. In the
  first steps of planning this out, Xerox suggested getting about a hundred
  phones all hooked into the same line that could all be taken off the hook
  at the same time.That would greatly decrease the voltage level. That is
  also why most three-way connections that are using the bell service three
  way calling (which is only $3 a month) become quite faint after a while.

     By now, you should understand the basic idea. You have to drain
  all of the power out of the line so the voltage can not be kept up. A
  rather sudden draining of power could quickly short out the F.B.I. voltage
  machine, because it was only built to sustain the exact voltage necessary
  to keep the voltage out.

     For now, image this. One of the normal radio shack generators that you
  can go pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box
  has a phone jack on it and the other an electrical plug. This way, you can
  "flash" voltage THROUGH the line, but cannot drain it. So, some
  modifications have to be done.

  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
  /-/   The Aqua Box  /-/
  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

   Materials needed-

  - A BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp type
    connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire that would plug
    into a light bulb.
  - One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then construct your
    own... same voltage connection, but the restrain or must be the central
    box)
  - TWO phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are being traced to
    plug the aqua box into)
  - Some cdeativity and easy work.

   NOTICE: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so
  don't go out and buy a new phone for it!

     All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it
  could drain into anything, a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having
  that is you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into the
  electrical appliance so there would be no voltage left to lock you in with.

  1) Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have
     only two prongs, if it has three, still, do not fear. MAKE SURE THE
     ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF unless you wanna become a cdispy
     cditter while making this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic
     design on the top of them to prevent you from getting in at the
     electrical wires inside. Well, get a knife and remove it. If you
     want to keep the plug (I don't see why...) then just cut the top off.

     When you look inside, lo and behold, you will see that at the base of
     the prongs there are a few wires connecting in. Those wires conduct the
     power into the appliance. So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides
     and pull them out until they are about an inch ahead of the prongs. If
     you don't wanna keep the jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you
     cover the prongs with insulation tape so they will not connect with the
     wires when the power is being drained from the line.

  2) Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the
     wires evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each
     other.
     If you happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the
     phonephonep 1 reading now, you're too fucking stupid to continue.

     After you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole
     thing with the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own
     control box or if you bought one, then cdam all the wires into the and
     re-close it. That box is your ticket out of this.

  3) Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty
     flimsy connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at
     it then you can solder away at it and form the whole device into one big
     box, with some kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be the
     power connector.

     In order to use itl ofuld pkeep this box handy. Plug it into the jack if
     you want, but it will slightly lower the voltage so it isn't connected.
     When you plug it in, if you see sparks, un-plug it and restart the
     WHOLE thing. But if it just seems fine then leave it.

  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
  /-/ Using it !! /-/
  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

       Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... DO NOT USE
  THIS UNLESS THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! When the trace has gone on, don't
  panic, un plug your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked
  to. It will need energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source...
  the voltage to keep a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light
  bulb should drain it all in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at the
  same time.

   Happy boxing and stay free!

   EVERY TRUE PHREAKER LIVES IN FEAR OF THE DREDDED F.B.I. 'LOCK IN TRACE.' FOR
  A LONG TIME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOCK IN TRACE. THIS BOX DOES
  OFFER AND ESCAPE ROUTE WITH SIMPLE DIRECTIONS TO IT. THIS BOX IS QUITE A
  SIMPLE CONCEPT, AND ALMOST ANY PHREAKER WITH BASIC ELECTRONICS KNOWLEDGE CAN
  CONSTRUCT AND USE IT.

  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
   A LOCK IN TRACE IS A DEVICE USED BY THE F.B.I. TO LOCK INTO THE PHONE USERS
  LOCATION SO THAT HE CAN NOT HANG UP WHILE A TRACE IS IN PROGRESS. FOR THOSE OF
  YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CONECPT OF 'LOCKING IN', THEN HERE'S A BREIF
  DESCIPTION.
   THE F.B.I. CAN TAP INTO A CONVERSATION, SORT OF LIKE A THREE-WAY CALL
  CONNECTION. THEN, WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY CAN PLUG ELECTRICITY INTO THE
  PHONE LINE. ALL PHONE CONNECTIONS ARE HELD OPEN BY A CERTAIN VOLTAGE OF
  ELECTRICITY, THAT IS WHY YOU SOMETIMES GET STATIC AND FAINT CONNECTIONS WHEN
  YOU ARE CALLING FAR AWAY, BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TROUBLE KEEPING THE LINE
  UP. WHAT THE LOCK IN TRACE DOES IS CUT INTO THE LINE AND GENERATE THAT SAME
  VOLTAGE STRAIGHT INTO THE LINES. THAT WAY, WHEN YOU TRY AND HANG UP, VOLTAGE
  IS RETAINED. YOUR PHONE WILL RING JUST LIKE SOMEONE WAS CALLING YOU EVEN AFTER
  YOU HANG UP. (IF YOU HAVE CALL WAITING, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND BETTER ABOUT
  THAT, FOR CALL WAITING INTERSEPTS THE ELECTRICITY AND MAKES A TONE THAT MEANS
  SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH YOUR LINE. THEN, IT IS A MATTER OF WHICH VOLTAGE IS
  HIGHER. WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE RECEIVER, THEN IT SEE-SAWS THE ELECTRICITY TO
  THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSON ON EACH LINE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HANG
  UP UNLESS ONE OR BOTH OF THEM WILL HANG UP. IF YOU TRY TO HANG UP, VOLTAGE IS
  RETAINED, AND YOUR PHONE WILL RING. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF
  HOW CALLING WORKS, ALSO. WHEN ELECTRICITY PASSES THROUGH A CERTAIN POINT ON
  YOUR PHONE, THE ELECTRICITY CAUSES A BELL TO RING OR ON SOME NEWER PHONES AN
  ELECTRONIC RING TO SOUND.)
   SO, IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE TRACE, YOU SOMEHOW MUST LOWER THE VOLTAGE LEVEL
  ON YOUR PHONE LINE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERY TIME SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE
  PHONE LINE, THEN THE VOLTAGE DOES DECREASE A LITTLE. IN THE FIRST STEPS OF
  PLANNING THIS OUT, XEROX SUGGESTED GETTING ABOUT A HUNDRED PHONES ALL HOOKED
  INTO THE SAME LINE THAT COULD ALL BE TAKEN OFF THE HOOK AT THE SAME TIME.
  THAT WOULD GREATLY DECREASE THE VOLTAGE LEVEL. THAT IS ALSO WHY MOST THREE-
  WAY CONNECTIONS THAT ARE USING THE BELL SERVICE THREE WAY CALLING (WHICH IS
  ONLY $3 A MONTH) BECOME QUITE FAINT AFTER A WHILE.
   BY NOW, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BASIC IDEA. YOU HAVE TO DRAIN ALL OF THE
  POWER OUT OF THE LINE SO THE VOLTAGE CAN NOT BE KEPT UP. I RATHER SUDDEN
  DRAINING OF POWER COULD QUICKLY SHORT OUT THE F.B.I. VOLTAGE MACHINE, BECAUSE
  IT WAS ONLY BUILT TO SUSTAIN THE EXACT VOLTAGE NESSECARY TO KEEP THE VOLTAGE
  OUT.
   FOR NOW, IMAGE THIS. ONE OF THE NORMAL RADIO SHACK GENERATORS THAT YOU CAN GO
  PICK UP THAT ONE END OF THE CORD THAT HOOKS INTO THE CENTRAL BOX HAS A PHONE
  JACK ON IT AND THE OTHER HAS AN ELECTRICAL PLUG. THIS WAY, YOU CAN "FLASH"
  VOLTAGE THROUGH THE LINE, BUT CANNOT DRAIN IT. SO, SOME MODIFICATIONS HAVE
  TO BE DONE.

                     THAT WOULD PLUG INTO A LIGHT BULB.
                   - ONE OF CORDS MENTIONED ABOVE, IF YOU CAN'T FIND ONE THEN
                     CONSTRUCT YOUR OWN... SAME VOLTAGE CONNECTION, BUT THE
                     RESTRAINOR MUST BE BUILT IN (I.E. THE CENTRAL BOX)
                   - TWO PHONE JACKS (ONE FOR THE MODEM, ONE FOR IF YOU ARE
                     BEING TRACED TO PLUG THE AQUA BOX INTO)
                   - SOME CREATIVITY AND EASY WORK.

   NOTICE: NO PHONES HAVE TO BE DESTROYED/MODIFIED TO MAKE THIS BOX, SO DON'T GO
           OUT AND BUY A NEW PHONE FOR IT!

   ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE. IF YOU HAVE THE BEOC, IT COULD
  DRAIN INTO ANYTHING, A RADIO, OR WHATEVER. THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THAT IS
  YOU ARE GOING TO SUCK THE VOLTAGE OUT FROM THE PHONE LINE INTO THE ELECTRICAL
  APPLICENCE SO THERE WOULD BE NO VOLTAGE LEFT TO LOCK YOU IN WITH.
   1)TAKE THE CONNECTION CORD. EXAMINE THE PLUG AT THE END. IT SHOULD HAVE ONLY
  TWO PRONGS, IF IT HAS THREE, STILL, DO NOT FEAR. MAKE SURE THE ELECTRICAL
  APPLIENCE IS TURNED OFF UNLESS YOU WANNA BECOME A CRISPY CRITTER WHILE MAKING
  THIS THING. MOST PLUG WILL HAVE A HARD PLASTIC DESIGN ON THE TOP OF THEM TO
  PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING IN AT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES INSIDE. WELL, GET A NICE
  AND REMOVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PLUG (I DON'T SEE WHY...) THEN JUST CUT
  THE TOP OFF.
   WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE, LOW AND BEHOLD, YOU WILL SEE THAT AT THE BASE OF THE
  PRONGS THERE ARE A FEW WIRES CONNECTING IN. THOSE WIRES CONDUCT THE POWER INTO
  THE APPLIANCE. SO, YOU CAREFULLY UNWRAP THOSE FROM THE SIDES AND PULL THEM OUT
  UNTIL THEY ARE ABOUT AND INCH AHEAD OF THE PRONGS. IF YOU WDON'T WANNA KEEP
  THE JACK, THEN JUST RIP THE PRONGS OUT. IF YOU ARE, COVER THE PRONGS WITH
  INSULTATION TAPE SO THEY WILL NOT CONNECT WITH THE WIRES WHEN THE POWER IS
  BEING DRAINED FROM THE LINE.
   2)DO THE SAME THING WITH THE PRONGS ON THE OTHER PLUG, SO YOU HAVE THE WIRES
  EVENLY CONNECTED. NOW, WRAP THE END OF THE WIRES AROUND EACH OTHER. IF YOU
  HAPPEN TO HAVE THE OTHER END OF THE VOLTAGE CORD HOOKED INTO THE PHONE, STOP
  READING NOW, YOUR TOO FUCKING STUPID TO CONTINUE.
   AFTER YOU'VE WRAPPED THE WIRES AROUND EAHC OTHER, THEN COVER THE WHOLE THING
  WITH THE PLUGS WITH INSULATING TAPE. THEN, IF YOU BUILT YOUR OWN CONTROL BOX
  OR IF YOU BOUGHT ONE, THEN CRAM ALL THE WIRES INTO THE AND RECLOSE IT. THAT
  BOX IS YOUR TICKET OUT OF THIS.
   3)RE-CHECK EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL IN PLACE. THIS IS A PRETTY FLIMSY
  CONNECTION, BUT ON LATER MODELS WHEN YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCED AT IT THEN YOU
  CAN SAUDER AWAY AT IT AND FORM THE WHOLE DEVICE INTO ONE BIG BOX, WITH SOME
  KIND OF CHEAP MATTEL HAND-HELD GAME INSUkjsoida.

   IN ORDER TO USE IT, JUST KEEP THIS BOX HANDY. PLUG IT INTO THE JACK IF YOU
  WANT, BUT IT WILL SLIGHTLY LOWER THE VOLTAGE SO IT ISN'T CONNECTED. WHEN YOU
  PLUG IT IN, IF YOU SEE SPARKS, UNPLUG IT AND RESTART THE WHOLE THING. BUT IF
  IT JUST SEEMS FINE THEN LEAVE IT.

  (>Introduction

          Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset?  Surely every phreak
  has at least once considered the phun that he could have with one.
  After searching unlocked phone company trucks for one for months, we
  had an idea.  We could build one.  We did, and named it the "Beige Box,"
  simply because that is the color of ours.  In the following file we
  will give complete instructions for the construction and use of a
  Beige Box.

  (>Construction

          The construction is very simple.  First, you must understand
  the concept of the device.  In a modular jack, there are four wires.
  These are red, green, yellow, and black.  For a single line telephone,
  however, only two matter: the red (ring) and green (tip).  The yellow
  and black are not necessary for this project.  A lineman's handset
  only has two clips on it: the ring and the tip.

          You will need a phone (we reccommend a touch-tone) with a
  modular plug, a modular jack, and two large alligator clips
  (preferably red and green, respectively).  Take the modular jack and
  look at the bottom of its casing.  There should be a grey jack with
  four wires (red, green, yellow, and black) leading out of it.  To the
  end of the red wire attach a red alligator clip.  To the end of the
  green wire attach a green alligator clip.  The yellow and black wires
  can be removed, although I would only set them aside so that you can
  use the modular jack in future projects.  Now insert your telephone's
  modular plug into the modular jack.  That's it.

          This particular model is nice because it can be easily made,
  is inexpensive, uses common parts that are readily available, is
  small, is lightweight, and does not require the destruction of a
  phone.

  (>Uses

          There are many uses for the Beige Box.  However, before you
  can use it, you must know how to attach it to its output device.  This
  device can be any of several Bell switching apparatus that include
  terminal sets (i.e., remote switching centers, bridging heads, cans,
  etc.).  To open most Bell Telephone switching apparatus, you must
  have a 7/16 inch hex driver.  This piece of equipment can be picked
  up at your local hardware store.  With your 7/16 hex driver, turn the
  security bolt(s) approximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and
  open.  If your output device is locked, then you must have some
  knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.  However, we have never
  encountered a locked output device.  Once you have opened your output
  device, you should see a mass of wires connected to terminals.  On
  most of your output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip
  -- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not
  labeled, it is usually on the right).  Remember: Ring - red -  right.
  The "Three R's" -- a simple way to remember which is which.

          Now you must attach the red alligator clip (ring) to the
  "R" (ring) terminal.  Attach the green alliagtor clip (tip) to the
  "T" (tip) terminal.  NOTE: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing,
  re-adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each other
  or other terminals.  Also make sure that they are firmly attached.
  By this time you should hear a dial tone.  Dial ANI and find out the
  number that you are using (you wouldn't want to use your own).

          Here are some practical applications:
                  o  Eavesdropping
                  o  Long distance, static-free phone calls to phriends
                  o  Dialing direct to Alliance Conferencing (also static-
                     free)
                  o  Phucking people over
                  o  Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
                  o  Blue Boxing with a greatly reduced chance of getting
                     caught
                  o  Anything at all that you want, since you are an
                     extension on that line


     <>Eavesdropping:

          To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box and then your
  phone.  This eliminates static caused by connecting the box, therefore
  reducing the potential suspicion of your victim.  When eavesdropping,
  it is always best to be neither seen nor heard.  If you hear someone
  dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the
  receiver again.  The person will either have hung up or tried to
  complete their call again.  If the latter is true, then listen in, and
  perhaps you will find information worthy of blackmail!  If you would
  like to know who you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A
  on the number.


       <>Dialing Long Distance:

          This section is self-explanatory, but don't forget to dial a
  "1" before the NPA.


        <>Dialing Direct to Alliance Conferencing:

          Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from
  there.  I prefer this method over PBXs, since PBXs often have poor
  reception and are more difficult to come by.


         <>Phucking People Over:

          This is a very large topic for discussion.  Just by using the
  other functions described, you can create a large phone bill for the
  person (they will not have to pay it, but it is a hassle for them).
  In addition, since you are an extension of the person's line, leave
  your phone off hook, and they will not be able to make or recieve
  calls.  This can be extremely nasty because no one would suspect the
  cause of the problem.


           <>Bothering the Operator:

          This is also self-explanatory and can provide hours of
  entertainment.  Simply ask or say things to her that are offensive and
  you would not like traced to your line.  This also corresponds with the
  previous described section, Phucking People Over.  After all, guess
  who's line it gets traced to? He he he...


             <>Blue Boxing:

          See a file on Blue Boxing for more details.  This is an
  especially nice feature if you live in an ESS-equipped prefix, since
  the calls are, once again, not traced to your line.

  (>Potential Risks

          Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicions within the Gestapo,
  and result in legal problems.  Therefore, I would recommend that you:

          o  Use more than one output device
          o  Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing
          o  Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real name
             on a public BBS concerning your accomplishments)
          o  In order to make sure that the enemy has not been inside your
             ouput device, I reccomend that you place a piece of
             transparent tape over the opening of your output device.
             Therefore, if it is opened in your absence, the tape will be
             displaced and you will be aware of the fact that someone has
             been intruding upon your territory.

                               BLACK BOX PLANS

  HERE IS HOW YOU CONSTRUCT A BLACK BOX.

    WHEN YOUR PHONE IS JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING THE
  VOLTAGE THROUGH THE PHONE LINE IS ZERO. THEN IF SOMEONE CALLS
  YOU (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) AND THE PHONE IS RINGING. THE
  VOLTAGE JUMPS TO 48 VOLTS WHICH TELLS MA BELL TO STAND BY IF YOU
  SHOULD PICK UP SO SHE CAN BILL YOU. WHEN YOU EVENTUALLY PICK UP
  THE PHONE, THE VOLTAGE DROPS TO 10 VOLTS AND THE BILLING STARTS.
  WHAT A BLACK BOX DOES IS KEEPS THE THE VOLTAGE AS 36 VOLTS,
  THEREFORE THE INCOMING CALLER NEVER GETS BILLED (INGEINIOUS)

    THE ORIGINAL BLACK BOX WAS CREATED BY AN EX-BELL EMPLOYEE WHO
  WENT BY THE NAME "CAPTAIN CRUNCH". HE GOT HIS NAME FROM THOSE
  LITTLE WHISLES YOU GOT IN BOXES OF CAPTAIN CRUNCH BECAUSE THEY
  EMITED A TONE THAT WAS EQUAL TO A COIN.CAPTAIN CRUNCH JUST
  ANNOUNCED  HIS RETIREMENT FROM PHREAKING WHEN HE WAS RELEASED
  FROM A CALIFORNIA JAIL. HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A BLUE BOX.

   CONSTRUCTION OF A
    BLACK BOX

    1] A 36 VOLT ZENER DIODE.
    2] A CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD.
    3] A ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF 1.0 MICROFARAD.

   YOU CAN GET THESE AT YOUR LOCAL RADIO SHACK DEALER.

  FIRST YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR PHONE.YOU SHOULD NOTICE THREE
  WIRES COMING IN FROM THE BACK OF THE PHONE, A GREEN, RED, AND
  YELLOW. MOST OF THE TIME THEY CAN DIFFER.DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE
  YELLOW WIRE, WE WILL NOT BE USING THIS.YOU WILL NEED TO FIND THE
  MOST POSITIVE OF THE REMAINING TWO WIRES.(ALMOST ALWAYS THE
  GREEN WIRE). NOW CONNECT THE BANDED END OF THE ZENER DIODE TO
  THE MORE POSITIVE OF THESE TWO WIRES. "IN SERIES". YOU HAVE JUST
  COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP.  FOR THE SECOND STEP YOU NEED A
  CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD. YOU CONNECT THIS
  "IN PARRALLEL" ACROSS THE DIODE. THIS IS NEEDED TO ALLOW THE
  DIODE TO PASS VOICE SIGNALS.  NOW FOR THE FINAL STEP TAKE YOUR
  ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF UP TO ONE MICROFARAD WITH ITS '+' END
  CONNECTED TO THE BANDED END OF THE DIODE AND THE OTHER END
  SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE ANODE END OF THE DIODE. MA BELL IS
  NOT TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO THIS.IF THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT A
  HALF-HOUR THEY WILL THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG AND BILL YOU
  ANYWAY.  WHEN USING A BLACK BOX,YOUR PHONE WILL CONTINUE RING
  EVEN THOUGH YOU PICKED IT UP. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SWITCH TO
  CONNECT ONE OF THE RINGER WIRES.THAT WILL SHUT IT OFF. THAT'S
  IT! HAVE PHUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  (>Introduction<)

             What is a BLACK BOX? A BLACK BOX is a device that is hooked up
  to your phone that fixes your phone so that when you get a call, the
  caller doesn't get charged for the call. This is good for calls up to 1/2
  hour, after 1/2  hour the Gestapo (the you can guess what happens.

             What this little beauty does is keep the line voltage from
  dropping  to 10v when you answer your phone. The line is insted kept at
  36v and it will make the phone think that it is still ringing while your
  talking. The reason for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the Gestapo thinks
  that something is wrong after 1/2 an hour of ringing. (I mean, come on)

       All parts are available  Radio Shack. Using the least possible parts
  and arrangement, the cost is $0.98; and that is parts for two  of them!

  Ever want to really make yourself be heard? Ever talk to someone on the phone
  who just doesn't shut up? Or just call the operator and pop her eardrum? Well,
  Up until recently it has been impossible for you to do theese things. That is,
  unless of course you've got a blast box. All a blast box is, is a really cheap
  amplifier, (around 5 watts or so) connected in place of the microphone on your
  telephone. It works best on model 500 AT&T Phones, and if constructed small
  enough, can be placed inside the phone.

  Construction:
   Construction is not really important. Well it is, but since I'm letting you
  make your own amp, I really don't have to include this.

  Usage:
  Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use the
  microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and presto. There it
  is.  Now, believe it or not, this device actually works. (At least on
  crossbar.) It seems that illinois bell switching systems allow quite alot of
  current to pass right through the switching office, and out to whoever you're
  calling. When you talk in the phone, it comes out of the other phone (again it
  works best if the phone that you're calling has the standard western electric
  earpiece) incredibly loud. This device is espicially good for PBS Subscription
  drives.

  Have Phun, and don't get caught!

   Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the inncoent
  phreakers around America has finally been concieved by the one phreak who is
  the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
  include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
  All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you!

   Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box, here is a
  brief summery of a legend.

  --*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

     For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
  made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
  of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Master, it is
  possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
  finally available to the public.

     NOTE: The Traveler can not be responcable for the information disclosed in
  the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
  actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
  the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecution!

     All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
  it's function.
     The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
  knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
  lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
  code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
  matter. As long as the switchhing system stays the same, this box will not
  stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
  that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
  and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/ generator is
  stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
  line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electricuted if
  they pick up the phone.

     But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
  generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
  a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
  aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
  Blotto Box will continue as long as thee is electricity to continue with.

     OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
  do with it...

  --*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--

     Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
  following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
  read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
  construct this box.

     Materials:
               - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
                 stadium or some such place.
               - A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
                 plug into a phone line jack.
               - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
               - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
                 you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
                 boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
                 or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
                     code!
               - A soudering iron and much souder.
               - A remote control or long wooden pole.

     Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
  I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
  other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
  one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
  the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convienent, if you are
  two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
  for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
  cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
  good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
  meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
  the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
  off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
  wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
  correct order, you will be a crispy critter. Keep the generator off until you
  plan to start it up. Now, sauder those lines together carefully. Wrap duck
  tape or insultation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
  control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
  make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
  the pole over. NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading
  the file first, you sill realize now tHat your area code is about to become
  null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
  damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating so much
  electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
  will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
  because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
  you in every direction.

     Have a nice day!

  THIS IS THE TONE MATRIX FOR A BOX WHICH GENERATES TONES THAT
  OPERATORS USE TO DIAL.ROTARY WORKS AS WELL, ON OPERATOR LINES,
  BUT THIS IS TECHNOLOGICAL(!).  NOW I AGREE WITH THE OPINION OF A
  WELL KNOWN PHREAK THAT 'BOXING' IS/WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART
  DEAD, BUT THIS IS TRADITION... FIRST,YOU DIAL DIR.ASST, OR AN
  OPER. ETC, THEN YOU BLAST TE LINE WITH A 2600HZ TONE. THIS GIVES
  YOU THE LINE, THIS IS ALSO HOW MA BELL TRACKS DOWN BLUE
  BOXERS...  THERE  ARE 2600HZ DETECTORS SYSTEMS, AND EVEN ON OLD
  #4 CROSSBARS... ONCE ON A OPER.TRUNK LINE, YOU USE YOUR BLUE
  BOX/ROTARY TO DIAL...  SO,  IF YOU USE2600HZ, WHICH IS
  NECESSARY, UNLESS YOU ARE *VERY* CAREFUL, YOU WILL BE SNAGGED.
  FINALLY, THIS IS WHAT YOU READ!SO LONG AND HARD FOR:

  USE KP TO START A CALL, AND ST TO STOP, WITH THE BELOVED 2600HZ
  TONE TO DISCONNECT.  I ALSO HEAR THAT 2600HZ RESETS SPRINT NODES

                        Blue Boxes, Part II


       While  reading  the fine article on the blue box I saw  that
  there a lot of data left out of the document.   I hope this adds,
  in some small way, to the information.
       First the tones.   While all the informatio is correct, the
  timing specs were not included.   The tone pairs are to remain on
  for 1/10 sec. with 1/10 sec. of slience between digits.  The 'KP'
  tones  should be sent for 2/10 sec.   A way to defeat the  2600hz
  traps  is to send along with the 2600z some pink  noise(most  of
  the  energy  in this signal should be above 3000hz,  this  signal
  won't make it over the toll network,  but should carry as far  as
  your  local  toll  center) so that the traps  won't  find  'pure'
  2600hz  on the trunk.   Ths is not a perfectly safe way to  box,
  but it should slow down the discovery.
       As  to use,  the first thing you need to understand is  that
  there  are  two(2)  types of toll completing  trunk,  inward  and
  outward.  The names are reference to the ofice that is switching
  the  call(The toll center that serves the WATS line  you  called)
  and each type of trunk has a different class of service.  From an
  inward toll completing trunk, you can reach the different service
  operators,  the toll test board  and the Inward Operator.   Some
  offices also allow remote testing and it is in these offices that
  you  can access the outward toll completing trunks.   The Outward
  trunks  allow  you  to  make  Verification(emergency)  calls,  do
  service  monitoring(tapping),  stack trunks(busy out  all  trunks
  between  LA and NYC),  enable and disable TSPS positions,  and in
  some cases(on some 4A's) issue temporary rerouting instructions(
  send  all calls from LA to NYC via Miami,  Boston,  or any  other
  class  5  office or offices).   Both type of trunk allow  you  to
  place a 'standard' call with a box.
       In  some  offices,  mostly the small ones with a  toll  test
  board that is unattended at night and on weekends, you can get an
  outward  toll completing tUh oh...

  (>tward  toll completing tUh oh...

  TIMES. (MS= MILLISECOND). FOR  THOSE OF  YOU  WHO   DONT  KNOW,
  A  RED  BOX SIMULATES MONEY  BEING  PUT  INTO A PAY PHONE. YOU
  MUST PUT IN SOME MONEY FIRST THOUGH (THE OPERATOR  CAN TELL IF
  MONEY WAS PUT IN BUT AS TO HOW MUCH, SHE LETS THE COMPUTER
  ANSWER THAT)

           TASI LOCKING FREQ:

    TASI   (  TIME    ASSIGNMENT   SPEECH INTERPOLATION )  IS
  USED  ON  SATELITE TRUNKS, AND BASICALLY  ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE
  PERSON TO USE A  TRUNK  BY  PUTTING THEM ON  WHILE  THE OTHER
  PERSON  ISNT TALKING. OF  COURSE,  YOU'D  NEVER HEAR THE OTHER
  PERSON TALKING ON YOUR TRUNK.

    WHEN YOU START TO  TALK, HOWEVER, THE TASI CONTROLLER  HAS TO
  FIND  AN  OPEN TRUNK FOR YOU. BECAUSE  OF  THIS,  SOME OF YOUR
  SPEECH  IS LOST( BECAUSE OF THE DELAY  IN  FINDING  A  TRUNK)
  THIS  IS CALLED CLIPPING.

    WELL,  IF YOU WERE  TRANSMITTING DATA OVER  A  TRUNK,
  CLIPPING  WOULD REALLY FUCK UP THE DATA. SO THERE IS SOMETHING
  CALLED A TASI  LOCKING FREQUENCY  WHICH KEEPS THE TASI FROM
  PUTTING ANYONE ELSE ON YOUR TRUNK OR  YOU  ON  ANYONE ELSES
  TRUNK. IN ANY CASE  THE FREQ.  IS  1850 HZ. SENT BEFORE THE
  TRANSMISSION).

            This is a fairly simple modification that can be made
  to any phone. All it does is allow you to take any 2 lines in
  your house and create a party line. So far I have not heard of
  any problems with it from my friends that have set one up and I
  ha

  I think that the convenience of having two people on line at any
  one time will make up for the minor volume loss.

             In some houses the black and yellow are already wired
  in others you will have to go out to your box and rewire it. A
  good way to figure out which line is which is to take the phone
  you are looking for off the hook.  Then you only need to take
  the red and green wires entering your phone and hook them to the
  different pairs of red and green going into the house.  You
  can't hurt anything in the phone or telephone by probeing.  When
  you find the pair that you want take the black from your line
  and attach it to the red of the other line then take the yellow
  and attach it to the green line.  Now you are all set to go.
  For people with rotary phones you can have one person call you
  then place the second call out to the other person. Though not
  phreakers tool, the brown box can be phun.

  Necessary Materials
  -------------------
  Four alligator clips
  One Telephone
  Some telephone wire

  Instructions
  ------------

  1) Find a neighbor's house that has a little gray box on the side.  This box
  should have a Bell logo on it (the gay little bell in a circle).


  2) Apply pressure underneath the box and the front should come right off.
  Pull the end off of the length of the telephone wire. Then strip the ends of
  all the different colored wires inside. These should be green, red, yellow and
  black. Attach an alligator clip to each of the wires. Then clip the clips to
  the same colors in the box. Yellow to yellow, red to red and so on.

  3) Then run the wire across the street back to your house and then plug a
  phone into the other end of the wire.
  4) Now you can dial out and receive the neighbors calls. Great for tapping the
  phones and then blackmailing them. You can also stop phreaking because any
  outgoing calls will be charged to the neighbors!   Great eh?

  All sysops may use these plans if they do not change them in any way at all.

       Intro
       -----

            The Chartreuse Box, so named because this is an obnoxious box
       and  chartreuse  is  an  obnoxious  color,  is  designed  to  take
       advantage of the thousands of dollars Ma Bell pays to the electric
       company each day.   As you know, your telephone line is a constant
       power source.   The chart box is designed to allow you to tap that
       power source for whatever sicko purposes you might have in mind.

       Parts
       -----

       [1]- 1 four prong to modular phone adapter (the rectangular beige
            boxes with phone line jacks at one end and four prongs out
            the other.)
       [2]- 1 low power broad range rheostate.
       [3]- some wire
       [4]- a soldering iron
       [5]- some electric tape
       [6]- a 70 vlt. DC fuse (optional)
       [7]- 1 SPST switch

       Assembly
       --------

            Plug the adapter into a phone line,  and use a multitester to
       note  which  posts are charged.   Use a magic marker to  mark  the
       positive and negative poles.  Do this first.
            Take  the  adapter,  and turn it  upside  down.   You  should
       observe  that the bottom fits into the top.   Use  a  pocketknife,
       small  screwdriver,  battle axe etc. to remove the bottom.   Don't
       break it.
            Detach  the  two wires not connected to  charged  poles,  and
       scrap  em.   Detach  the  other two  wires  as  well.   Take  your
       rheostat, and mount it on the outside of the box, drilling a small
       hole in the box, to run wires through.
            Run  wire  from the charged connections from the  line  jack,
       through the rheostat, to the charged poles.  (see diagram).

          positive line
                  \/        +---------+
       ---------.....       :         :
       linejack+    :......#:rheostat :#........(fuse)....[=====]
       ---------..          :         :
                 :...       +---------+
                    :............#.........................[=====]
                                        negative line

       Key:  # - Rheostate poles
             . - Wiring path
            [=]- Outside posts

            Attach  the fuse somewhere in the line if you feel  like  it.
       When  the phone rings 90 volts of pulsing DC power get  shot  down
       your line,  and can really fuck up whatever you have the chart box
       hooked up to.  Therefore, the fuse is a good idea.
            You can also hook a switch up to the wiring, to give you more
       control  over when power starts to flow.   Once all the wiring  is
       complete, push the wires and the fuse into the casing, and reclose
       it.   Then tape around the side of the box, to hold the wires that
       come  out to the rheostat down.  I highly recommend that you  mark
       the charged posts with a marker, so you can easily identify them.


       Use
       ---

            To use the chart box, hook it up to a phone line, and grab a
       multitester or voltmeter.  Use the voltmeter to read off the
       voltage from your chart box.  You can get up to 12 volts (more if
       you use a transformer) from the box, but you can use the rheostat
       to calibrate the box for whatever voltage you need.  Once the
       voltage is set, remove the box from the line, hook your device up
       to the charged poles, and plug the box back in.  If you're really
       in a constructive mood, build a switch into the box.  Now leech Ma
       Bell's precious energy to your hearts content.

       Footnote
       --------

            This device has other potential uses.  One of the most
       obvious, and least useful (at least to my view) is as a volume
       control for your phone.  Maybe you have an aunt that talks REAL
       LOUD!!!!!   Also, you can use this device to set up a feedback
       loop to mess up someone else's phone line.  Finally, it may be
       possible to use the chart box to tone down your connection, and
       provide a little background noise, so that ESS doesn't pick up on
       your blue boxing.  This is not a guaranteed method, but if you do
       it just right, you can make the 2600 blast sneak by the ESS
       detection code.
            Naturally, the main purpose of the chart box is to leech Ma
       Bell just like she leeches you.

       Hail Discordia!

         A Cheesebox(named for the type ofbox the first one was
  found in)is a type of box which will, in effect, make your telephone a
  Pay-Phone.....This is a simple,modernized, and easy way of doing it....

        Inside Info:These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way of
  making calls to people without being called by the cops or having their
  numbers traced and/or tapped......

       How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

       Ingredients:
       ------------

       1 Call Forwarding service on the
         line

       1 Set of Red Box Tones

       The number to your prefix's Inter-
       cept operator(do some scanning for
       this one)

       How To:
       -------

         After you find the number to the intercept operator in your prefix, use
  your call-forwarding and forward all calls to her...this will make your phone
  stay off the hook(actually, now it waits for a quarter to be dropped
  in)...you now have a cheese box... In Order To Call Out On This Line:You must
  use your Red Box tones and gener- ate the quarter dropping in...then,you can
  make phone calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly safe, and they
  do not check much...Although I am not sure, I think you can even make
  credit-card calls from a cheesebox phoneand not get
  traced...

    Emergency vehicles in many cities are now using devices called OptoComs.
  OptoComs are a system of sensors on traffic lights that detect a pattern
  of flashes from vehicle-mounted strobe lights.

    This flash pattern varies from city to city depending on the manufacturer
  of the equipment used.  Often the sensors are installed only at major
  intersections.  Nevertheless, the Chrome Box, which simulates these strobe
  patterns can often be used to give your car the same priority as an
  ambulance, paramedic van, firetruck or police car.

    Because of the varying patterns on different systems this phile will
  outline a general procedure for making the Chrome Box.

  Decoding Flash Patterns:

   First, you need to observe an emergency vehicle in action.  You can wait
  until you encounter one by chance, running out to see when you hear a siren,
  or when you pull over in your car to let one pass by. You might wait near a
  fire station for the next emergency to occur.  Or, if you are very
  impatient, you can summon one by calling in a false alarm (not recommended
  in areas with limited services - that could divert attention from a real
  emergency).  If the OptoComs in your area are the kind with a pattern of
  single flashes at a steady rhythm, you have merely to buy a strobe light at
  Radio Shack & adjust the flash rate until you can induce a traffic light to
  change.

   If the flash pattern is more complex, you can videotape the emergency
  vehicle & then play back the tape in single-frame mode, counting the number
  of frames between each flash. Each video frame is 1/30 of a second, using
  this you can calculate the time between flashes in the pattern.  Another way
  is to count the number of flashes (or flash-groups) in one minute and use
  that to compute the rate. Counting video frames will give you a good idea of
  the spacing of the flashes in a complex pattern.  For really accurate
  information, call the fire station & ask them, or write to the manufacturer
  for a service manual, which will include a schematic diagram that you can
  use to build one. A good cover story for this is that you are a consultant &
  one of your clients asked you to evaluate Optocom systems, or you could pose
  as a free-lance journalist writing an article.

  Modifying the Strobe Light:

   You may not have to modify the strobe at all. But if you need a faster
  flash rate than your strobe allows, open it up & find the large capacitor
  inside. Capacitors are marked in microfarads, abbreviated as mf,mfd or ufd.
  By replacing the capacitor with one of the same voltage-rating (usually
  250 volts or more) and a SMALLER value in microfarads, you can increase the
  flash rate. Halving the microfarads doubles the rate.
   The other component that can be changed is the potentiometer (the speed
  control device with the knob on it). Using a smaller value (measured in
  ohms or Kilohms, abbrevaited with the greek letter 'omega' or the letter K)
  will speed up the strobe. There may also be a resistor (small cylinder with
  several colored stripes on it, and wires coming out of each end). Replacing
  this resistor with one of smaller value will also speed up the strobe.

   To generate a complex pattern, you will either have to design and build a
  triggering circuit using IC chips, or rig up a mechanical device with a
  multiple-contact rotary switch and a motor.  It HAS been done.

   To modify the strobe for mobile operation the simplest thing is to get a
  110-volt inverter that will run off of a car battery by plugging into the
  cigarette lighter & run the strobe from that.  Or, you can figure out (or find
  in a hobby electronics magazine) a strobe circuit that will run from batteries
.
  Battery-powered strobes may also be availble, either assembled or as kits.

  Stealth Technology:

   Most light sensors and photocells are more sensitive in the infrared area of
  the light spectrum. Infrared (IR) is invisible to the human eye. Putting an
  infrared filter over the strobe light may allow the Chrome Box to operate in
  traffic undetected by police or other observers. IR filters can be obtained
  from military surplus sniperscope illuminators, or from optical supply
  houses like Dow-Corning or Edmunds Scientific Co.

  Using the Chrome Box:

   Mounted on your car, the Chrome Box can guarantee you green lights at major
  intersections in cities that have OptoComs. Handheld Chrome Boxes may be
  used to create gridlock by interfering with the normal flow of traffic.  If
  you have access to a window overlooking a traffic light, you can play pranks
  by switching the signals at inappropriate moments, or you can plug the
  strobe into an exposed outlet at a laundromat or gas station.

  Some Decoded Patterns:

  Torrance, California
      Standard large Radio Shack strobe lights are used. Moderately fast rate.
      *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

  Manhattan Beach,CA
     Flash-pairs in a 4:1 ratio, at a rate of 2 flash-pairs per second.

                              Clear Box Plans


     The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used
  throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on "PostPay"
  payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont require payment
  until after the connection is established. You pick up the fone, get
  a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after the person
  answers.If you dont deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
  the other end- because your mouth peice is cut off, but, not the ear piece.
  (obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
  other such recordings).All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or
  electronics store,and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
  telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
  hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except that it
  ould be plugged into the out-
  put of the amplifier and a microphone would be hooked to the input. So when
  the party that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the
  little microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
  the induction coil, and into the back of the reciever where it would then be
  broadcast through the phone lines and the other party would be able to hear
  the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard.
  Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because
  it will wait forever for the coins to be put in.The biggest advantage for all
  of us about this new clear box is the
  fact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
  Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first
  service, 2nd, it doesnt require any special equipment, (for the phone
  company)This payphone will work on any phone line. Ususally a payphone line is
  different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone
  does all the charging, not the company.

  (>es all the charging, not the company.

  Disclaimer (I know...):
    This file is for informational purposes only.  No use of this technique
  is recommended for one of many reasons: 1) It makes other Phreaks & hacks
  very upset, 2) It makes the Telco VERY upset, and you could be put away for
  a LONG time if you dont know what youre doing.  Telco employees could learn
  something from the Copper Box. Well, anyway, off we go....

  Purpose:
    This box can destroy a phone company, no matter how big.  You could bring
  AT&T down to their knees!  Only to be used by the most irate of Phracks,
  it is intended for informational purposes only.

  History:
    This is really not a Box, but if you consider a Cheese Box a Box, then it
  is.  It was first concieved back in 1986 when a Phriend and I came up with
  the idea while using a Copper-coloured fone, hence, a Copper Box.

  Instructions:
    You must obtain [1] extender, or phone company port, like an MCI or SPRINT
  access number.  [2] A hell of a lot of nerve, and vendetta towards the phone
  company (phriend gets busted, rates increase, etc.) [3] a computer & modem
  capable of autodialing [tone.]

    Dial the number of the L/D service, then enter the code.  Dial the number of
  the service again, through the outdial number you are still on, enter code,
  then dial again and again.  You should hear, after a while (it will take a
  long time for BIG companies) a slight high-pitched, unstable tone, that grows
  louder and louder w/every dial.  Once it gets so loud that it refuses to let
  in any more sounds, you have just completed the first cycle of the Copper Box.
    Leave line off-hook for about 10 minutes or until the tone seems to calm
  down, or stop completely.  Then, dial again and repeat over and over again
  until when you dial a last time, it [the port] doesnt answer.  You have just
  killed a telephone company, extender, etc.

  Theory of Operation:
    What happens is that when the tone begins to rise, it is a result of cross-
  talk feedback.  The more you dial,  the more it grows.  In systems like these,
  the small, sensitive equipment such as amplifiers, etc. begin to burn out as
  a result of the feedback, damaging the equipment, and possibly starting a fire
  at the location of the equipment.

  Disclaimer (I know...):
    This file is for informational purposes only.  No use of this technique
  is recommended for one of many reasons: 1) It makes other Phreaks & hacks
  very upset, 2) It makes the Telco VERY upset, and you could be put away for
  a LONG time if you dont know what youre doing.  Telco employees could learn
  something from the Copper Box. Well, anyway, off we go....

  Purpose:
    This box can destroy a phone company, no matter how big.  You could bring
  AT&T down to their knees!  Only to be used by the most irate of Phracks,
  it is intended for informational purposes only.

  History:
    This is really not a Box, but if you consider a Cheese Box a Box, then it
  is.  It was first concieved back in 1986 when a Phriend and I came up with
  the idea while using a Copper-coloured fone, hence, a Copper Box.

  Instructions:
    You must obtain [1] extender, or phone company port, like an MCI or SPRINT
  access number.  [2] A hell of a lot of nerve, and vendetta towards the phone
  company (phriend gets busted, rates increase, etc.) [3] a computer & modem
  capable of autodialing [tone.]

    Dial the number of the L/D service, then enter the code.  Dial the number of
  the service again, through the outdial number you are still on, enter code,
  then dial again and again.  You should hear, after a while (it will take a
  long time for BIG companies) a slight high-pitched, unstable tone, that grows
  louder and louder w/every dial.  Once it gets so loud that it refuses to let
  in any more sounds, you have just completed the first cycle of the Copper Box.
    Leave line off-hook for about 10 minutes or until the tone seems to calm
  down, or stop completely.  Then, dial again and repeat over and over again
  until when you dial a last time, it [the port] doesnt answer.  You have just
  killed a telephone company, extender, etc.

  Theory of Operation:
    What happens is that when the tone begins to rise, it is a result of cross-
  talk feedback.  The more you dial,  the more it grows.  In systems like these,
  the small, sensitive equipment such as amplifiers, etc. begin to burn out as
  a result of the feedback, damaging the equipment, and possibly starting a fire
  at the location of the equipment.

  The Crimson Box is very simple device that will allow you to put
  someone on hold or make your fone busy with a large amount of
  ease. You flip a switch and the person can't hear you talking.
  Flip it back and everything is peechy.

  (*)   Needed Materials  (*)
  (*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)

  (1) 100 ohm or less resistor
  (1) SPDT toggle switch, On-On
  (3) feet of good wire
  Wire cutters
  Solder and soldering iron

  (*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)
  (*)   Construction & Schemtaic  (*)
  (*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)

  First I will give you the schematic and then I will explain what
  the hell is going on.

  -----------black wire on line---------
  --------+   red wire on line   +------
  --------!--+/\/\/-green wire---!------
  --------!--! yellow wire-------!------
          !  !                   !
          +--!------+            !

                  ! ! !
                  1 2 3

  Ok. The '/\/\/' is the resistor. And '1 2 3' is the switch where
  the numbers are the poles on the switch. Notice you leave the
  black and yellow wires alone.  You DO NOT cut them!

  Strip the red and green wires so you've got about an inch of
  bare wire. Solder some of the extra wire and follow the
  schematic. You should have the resistor on the green wire with
  an extra piece of wire coming from one leg of it. The other leg
  goes to the other end of the green wire. You should solder the
  green wire to the left pole of the switch and the red to the
  middle and the other end of the red to the right pole.

  Now, lift up the phone. If all you get is an annoying buzz then
  throw the [switch and you should get a dial tone.  If not, don't
  worry and just follow the instructions and schematic again.

  -> Author's note:

     Yes, yes, I know that this box is similar to several other boxes,
  including the so-called "Bud box," and the "beige box." Well, my reason for
  writing this version is because of the fact that once finished constructing
  the box, the file does not contain very much information on usage. It is
  beacuse of that reason that this file was written. By the way, call
  Ground 0 at 988-4426. Thank you.

  -> What is the function of a Day-Glo box?

     Well, a Day-glo box will let you place calls for free with no time limit,
  no possibility of a wiretap, and the calls can be placed from anywhere in the
  world. Too good to be true, you say? Well, read on.

  -> How does a Day-glo box work?

     A day-glo box is very easy to make, and very inexpensive to build. It
  works like this: On the outside of every home that has a phone, there is
  something called "the outside connection box," which is where the house is
  connected to Ma Bell's network. This ingenious device connects to a) your
  phone, b) the victim's outside box. You should be starting to get the idea.

  -> How do I construct a day-glo box?

     Materials necessary: 1. Radio Shack modular conversion jack
                          2. A small experimenter's box (optional)
                          3. 1 foot of red wire. (better to overkill)
                          4. 1 foot of green wire. (same as above)
                          5. 2 medium alligator clips

     Well, in order to construct this box, you will need all of the above
  materials. Note that your wire does not necessarily have to be red or green,
  but it is necessary that you be able to tell them apart. Also, you might want
  to use thick, easily bent wire (audio hookup wire works best) instead of bell
  wire. Now, on to the construction.

     1. Remove the actual modular jack from the conversion box. This can be
        done by pushing inward and then up, or you can just cut the plastic.

     2. Remove the black and yellow wires from the jack. You can either clip
        these or rip them out.

     3. To your newly isolated jack, add the 1 foot wire extensions to the
        respective wires. Soldering and then wrapping the connections with
        electrical tape works best.

     4. Next, solder the alligator clips to the extended wires. If you do not
        wish to solder them, then just wrap the clips with the wire.

     5. Now, place this newly made contraption into a box (optional). You may
        need to drill a few holes, and possibly remove the alligator clips,
        but you should have read this file first, anyway.

  -> Wiring Diagram

    Modular--------------Red-----+----Extension wire---------< Alligator
     Jack  --------------Green---+----Extension wire---------< Clips

     Pretty easy, eh?

  -> Usage of the day-glo box

     The day-glo box will work with any phone. First, you need to locate a
  house that has a phone. Next, (it's preferable to do this at night) go up
  to the and locate the outside connection box. Pop the cover off. Locate
  prong 3 and prong 4. You will attach the green wire clip to prong 3. The
  red wire clip will go to prong 4. Now, plug your phone (preferably a
  trimline or ranger) into your modular plug. You may now either listen in on
  the call (wire tap) OR you may call out to anywhere in the world. If you
  are really daring, you can bring your computer with you. Note: This box
  may also be used in conjunction with the lunch box in order to make a
  perfect phone bug.

  -> Other neat things you can do with your new box:

     1: Call 976 numbers. This should be done very frequently. Also, I find
        that after finding the victim's outside box, several calls to the
        gay hotlin will have interesting after-effects; namely, his parents
        wondering about him.

     2: Alliance teleconferencing can be accomplished quite easily. Try it!
        Call 0-700-456-1000. Or, tell the operator you'd like to initiate a
        conference.

     3: Of course, you should place several calls to other countries. This can
        be accomplished by looking in the front of your white pages for the
        various country and city codes. You should be able to follow the
        directions provided in there.

  -> Using your box at apartments/community connection boxes:

     Have you ever wondered what those 6ft tall cabinets with the bell logo on
  them were for? Well, if you've never seen them, here's a quick description:
  They are 6ft tall by 3ft wide, and painted the dull phone company green.
  They can be opened quite easily with a 7/16ths inch socket wrench. After
  turning the bold over the handle, turn the handle to the right and pull. It
  should open, displaying over 100 different lines. Occasionally, you can find
  tech. manuals and test kits inside. They are usually located near phone
  lines.

     Okay, now, once you have opened one of these calling cabinets, locate the
  line of your choice. You will have to take out both the orange and the white
  insulated screws. The purple and white wires should come off along with the
  screws. The lines go out to the house, and the screw posts are the actual
  line. Now, you should clip the alligators to the posts, with one part of
  the clip on the insulation, and one inside the screw hole to insure the
  best connection. Oh, if you want the home to remain connected, clip the
  wires inside the hole using the alligator clips. By the way, the red
  terminal on your box goes to the orange post, and the green one to the
  white post... if that doesn't work, reverse the connection. Now, to find
  out the number you have taken over, dial 380-55555555. Yes, that's eight
  fives. A computer voice should tell you what number you are on. heh.

     I hope you can take it from here. Oh, in apartments, you can find the
  calling cabinet in the basement... remember, this is not your line, so do
  anything you want. Call the President or something.

  OF THE BOX. OR, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF MAKING
  IT BY YOURSELF, YOU CAN GET ONE FOR $7.50 FROM DLOC. OURS ARE
  ENCASED IN A STURDY PLASTIC BOX, WITH OUR LOGO STENCILED ON THE
  SIDE, AND ARE VERY WELL MADE. IF YOU WANT TO BUY ONE, CONTACT A
  DLOC MEMBER ON ONE OF THE BOARDS LISTED BELOW IN THIS FILE.

  DLOC BOX FUNCTIONS:
  -------------------

  HOOKUP: TO HOOK UP THE BOX, PLUG YOUR FONES INTO THE JACKS ON
  THE BOX. ON MINE, THE WIRES ARE LABELED EVERY FOOT SO THAT I
  KNOW WHICH TRUNK I'M ON. CLIP THE APPROPRIATE SET OF CLIPS ON
  THE TERMINALS YOU WISH TO INVADE, AND THEN LISTEN/DIAL THROUGH
  WHICHEVER PHONE IS CONNECTED. THIS BOX HAS TWO LINES GOING
  THROUGH IT, WITH AN OPTION TO CONFER- ENCE THE TWO. I ADDED THIS
  SO IF WHILE ON ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING, YOU WANT TO DIAL AN
  800,900,700, OR 976 NUMBER, YOU CAN SIMPLY DIAL IT WITH THE
  OTHER TRUNK AND THEN CONFERENCE THE TWO.

  CONFERENCING THE TWO LINES: TO JOIN THE TWO LINES, TURN BOTH OF
  THE TOGGLE SWITCHES TO THE ON POSITION.

  NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT NO PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE BOX WHEN YOU
  HOOK UP THE CLIPS, AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH SWITCHES ARE
  TURNED OFF.

  GOLD BOX PLANS: COURTESY OF SIR WILLIAM

  HOW TO BUILD IT
  _______________


       YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING:

  TWO 10K OHM AND THREE 1.4K OHM RESISTOR ES, TWO 2N3904 TRANSISTORS, TWO
  PHOTOCE LLS, TWO RED LED'S (THE MORE LIGHT PROD UCED THE BETTER), A BOX
  THAT WILL NOT L ET LIGHT IN, AND RED AND GREEN WIRE.

   LIGHT FROM THE #1 LED MUST SHING DIREC TLY ON THE PHOTOCELL #1. THE GOLD
  BOX I MAID NEEDED THE TOP OF THE LED'S TO TOU CH THE PHOTOCELL FOR IT TO
  WORK.  THE SAME APPLIES TO THE #2 PHOTOCELL AND LED 1

      :-PHOTOCELL--:

                   RESISTORES

              2
         -PHOTOCELL-----------------
         :                         :
         :BASE                     :
       TTTTT                       :

       :   :
       /+/+/
        1.4K

  THE 1.4K RESISTOR IS VERIABLE AND IF TH E SECCOND PART OF THE GOLD BOX IS
  SKIPPE D IT WILL STILL WORK BUT WHEN SOMEONE P ICKS THE PHONE UP THEY WILL
  HEAR A FAIN T DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT REPORT IT TO THE
  GESTOPO ER...(AT&T).  1.4K WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH LITTLE RISK
  OF A GESTOPO AGENT AT YOUR DOOR.


     NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT IT TAKE TWO GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENTH STRIP
  THE ENDS, TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONN ECT THEM TO GREEN1 AND PLACE A
  PEICE OF TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 WRITING ON IT.  CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH
  RED1 ONLY US E RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH RED2 AND GREEN2 BUT CHANGE TO LINE
  #2.


  HOW TO INSTALL
  ______________

     YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINES THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL
  ONE OF THE PHONES LINES LINE #1.CUT THE PHONE LINES AND TAKE THE OUTER
  COUTING OFF I T. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES CUT THE YELL OW AND BLACK WIRES
  OFF AND STRIP THE RE D AND GREEN WIRES FOR BOTH LINES.

     LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PEICES TAKE THE GREEN WIRE OF ONE END AND
  CONNECT IT TO THE ONE OF THE GREEN WIRES ON THE GOLD BOX. TAKE THE OTHER
  HALF OF LINE # 1 AND HOOK THE FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE G REEN WIRE ON THE
  PHONE LINE. REPEAT THE PROCESS WITH RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

     ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RIGHT D OWN THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PLACE
  YOU HOOKED IT UP AT AND GO HOME AND CALL IT. YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE!!!
  IF NOT LEAVE ME A MESSAGE ON THE MODEM MADNESS BBS 516-569-0589 OR TRY
  CHANGING THE EMITTER WITH COLLECTOR.  OH AND HOOKING IT UP TO A PAYPHONE
  IS A FEDERAL OFFENCE AND IS ILLEAGAL TO PUT ON ANY PHONE.  I RECOMMEND YOU

     The Green Box generates useful tonessuch as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
  RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to
  the CO when appropriate.  Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a
  fortress station, but must be used by the CALLED party.  The tones (hz) are:

     COIN COLLECT      700  +  1100
     COIN RETURN      1100  +  1700
     RINGBACK          700  +  1700

     Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
  signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.  This can be done
  by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed by a 60 ms
  gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.  Also, do not forget
  that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute period is up.

  MA BELL IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH STANDARDS! JUST ABOUT EVERY MANUFACTURER OF
  IC'S THAT GENERATE TOUCH TONES HAS ALSO GONE BY THE 16 KEY (8 TONE) STANDARD
  FOR TOUCH TONE PADS. AND IT IS EVEN EASIER TO CONVERT A TONE PAD THAT USES AN
  INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TO GENERATE THE TONES THAN CONVERTING A MA BELL PAD!

  IT WILL HELP IMMENSELY IF YOU HAVE THE SCHEMATIC FOR THE PAD IN QUESTION, OR
  AT LEAST THE PIN-OUT DIAGRAM OF THE CHIP BEING USED. PIN-OUTS CAN USUALLY BE
  OBTAINED FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR FROM AN ECG, SK, GE OR SIMILIAR
  SEMICONDUCTER HANDBOOK (PROVIDED THAT MANUFACTURER MAKES AN EQUIVALENT FOR
  THE CHIP IN YOUR PAD). I'LL USE THE RADIO SHACK CEX-4000 TONE PAD MODULE FOR
  AN EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS PROBABLY ALMOST THE LOUSIEST ONE YOU CAN BUY,
  IT IS FAIRLY TYPICAL ASILY AVAILABLE.

  TAKE A LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM OR THE PIN-OUT OF THE CHIP. YOU SHOULD SEE TWO
  GROUPS OF PINS, THE ROWS TONE PINS AND THE COLUMN TONE PINS. THESE WILL BE
  MARKED AS R1,R2,R3,R4 AND C1,C2,C3 (RADIO SHACK) OR OR X1,X2,X3 AND Y1,Y2,Y3
  ETC. ON OTHERS. AT ANY RATEU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WHICH THREE
  PINS CONTROL THE COLUMNS AND WHICH FOUR CONTROL THE ROWS. IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
  EACH GROUP OF ROWS AND COLUMNS WILL BE CONTIGUOUS. NOW LOOK AT THE COLUMN
  PINS, AND YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE AN EMPTY PIN RIGHT NEXT TO THEM. THIS IS THE
  COLUMN PIN FTHE 1633 HZ TONES. THESE CHIPS USUALLY ACHIEVE THEIR SWITCHING BY
  CONNECTING A ROW PIN WITH A COLUMN PIN (THAT WAY TQAN USE A0VERY SIMPLE
  KEYBOARD PAD, UNLIKE MA BELL'S COMPLICATED ONE). SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE
  A SPDT SWITCH AND A FEW PIECES OF WIRE, CUT THE TRACE GOING TO THE COLUMN 3
  PIN OF THE CHIP, ATTACH A WIRE FROM THE CHIP SIDEOF THAT CUT TO ONE END OF THE
  SPDT SWITCH, A WIRE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CUT TO THE CENTER OF THE SPDT
  SWITCH, AND FINALLY, FROM THE REMAINING CONTACT ON THE SPDT SWITCH, HOOK A
  WIRE TO THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED PIN C4 (COLUMN 4). NOW YOU HAVE A "BANK
  SWITCHING ARRANGEMENT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS BULLETIN
  FOR MODIFYING A MA BELL PAD.

  IF YOU CAN'T GET THE SCHEMATICS OR THE PIN OUTS FOR YOUR CHIP, DON'T DESPAIR.
  THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR YOU! YOU JUST HAVE TO TRACK THE CONNECTIONS GOING FROM
  THE PAD'S KEYS TO THE CHIP. CHANCES ARE YOU'LL FIND THAT EACH ROW HAS A COMMON
  TRACE, AND SO DOES EACH COLUMN (FOR THOSE NON-TECHNICAL FOLKS, A TRACE IS A
  CONNECTION ETCHED OUT ON A CIRCUIT BOARD). JUST FOLLOW THESE TO THE CHIP, AND
  MAKE YOUR OWN SCHEMATIC UP. NOW TAKE A LOOK FOR THAT EXTRA PIN--THERE SHOULD
  BE ONE FLOATING AROUND RIGHT NEXT TO THE COLUMN PINS. IT WILL BE NOT BE HOOKED
  UP TO ANYTHING ELSE, THAT IS, "HANGING FREE". DRILL A HOLE IN THE SIDE OF
  TONEPAD'S CASE, AND MOUNT YOUR SWITCH. RADIO SHACK SELLS A NICE MICROMINIATURE
  SWITCH THAT WORKS EXCELLENTLY! (ALMOST THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY ABOUT
  RADIO SHACK IN THIS ARTICLE)

                HAPPY PHREAKING.....

                           How To Make An In-Use Light
                              From The Night Owl AE


    This file describes the operation and construction of a device that will
  signal whether or not an extension of a particular phone line is off-hook.  It
  does NOT indicate whether or not a phone is being tapped, and will light
  whenever any extension is picked up.

    The principle under which this device operates is that there is a voltage
  across the red and green wires of the phone line (the other wires are rarely
  used) that drops significantly when an extension is lifted.  Though this
  voltage can be used to power a light on its own, the light would have to be of
  a very low power consumption in order not to keep the phone off-hook, and it
  would only light when the phone is on-hook.

    A simple way to get around the above problem is to use a low current relay.
  Radio Shack sells some nice 12VDC SPDT relays that work well for this purpose.
  Don't buy the red relays or the subminis; though you want a low current
  coil, you also want the contacts to be able to handle a decent current.
  DPDT (double pole, double throw) will also work, you just won't use the
  other contacts.

    For a 12 volt coil, the voltage will have to be dropped so that the relay
  will function properly.  The proper resistance is around 10K ohms, but it is
  best to use a 5K ohm fixed resistor and a 10K ohm variable (standard values,
  any combination that can cover the 10K range will work fine).  Adjust it to
  approximately 10K, or halfway for the combination above.  Connect the
  resistors in series with the coil, and we'll adjust it later.

    Due to the nature of this device (or rather, its simplicity) it will
  operate without having to be plugged into a phone, or vice versa.  In other
  words, you can plug it directly into a jack anywhere, and it'll work.
  You'll want to get a modular plug that terminates in spade lugs for this
  purpose.  Connect the green wire to one side of the coil, and the red to the
  resistors (so that it's all in series).  If you don't have an extra phone
  jack, then you will want to a) buy a Y connector so that two phones can be
  plugged into the same jack, or b) get another phone jack and install it in
  the same box with the in-use light, so that you can plug a phone into it.
  Just connect the spade lugs to their respective colors.

    For the light itself, you can use almost anything.  Even a tiny light bulb
  and a battery will work fine, but after about 5 hours of phone use, you'll
  have to replace the battery.  The best thing to use is a neon bulb powered
  by the 110V power available most places.  Buy ones with dropping resistors,
  or use a 220K resistor for dropping.  You should also get a panel lamp
  assembly to keep it steady and make it look pretty.  Since the current is
  relatively low, you can use almost any power cord, or sacrifice an old
  extension cord.  Connect it in series with the NC (normally closed) contacts
  of the relay (in series with the dropping resistor, of course).

    Your circuits should now look like this:
                        /
   --------RED----!---- 5k --- 10k -------O     O-------------------!-----110V
                      /          |     |
                            coil    NC /
                           |     |
   -------GREEN---!-----------------------O     O-- bulb --- 220k --!-----110V

    Make sure that the phone circuit (left) and the lamp circuit (right) are
  totally 100% separate, and in no danger of touching.  Use wire nuts for all
  connections in 110V that are not to a terminal post, and tape them.  For all
  wires that are exposed, use electrical tape or shrink-wrap tubing to insulate
  them.  Glue the relay to the box or mount it on a stable PC board.

    If all looks well, hook it up.  It should work immediately, but there are
  three things that can go wrong:

  1) The relay keeps the phone off the hook. To remedy this, lower the
     resistance until it doesn't.  If you can't lower the resistance enough,
     then you are using a resistor with a high current coil and you'll have to
     get one with a
     lower rating.

  2) The relay won't close.  The solution for this is the same as number 1.

  3) The relay stays closed.  Raise the resistance with the phone on hook until
     the light goes off.

    When all is working, the lamp should be on when one or more extensions are
  off-hook, and will be off when all extensions are on-hook.  It will blink when
  the phone rings.

                  This is a parts list:

        1 box.  Make it a nice one, preferably one with feet.
        1 phone cord with a modular plug at one end and spade lugs at the other.
        1 phone jack or Y adapter (optional).
        1 power cord or old extension cord.
        1 low current coil relay, double throw.
        1 5K fixed resistor.
        1 10K variable resistor.
        1 neon bulb with dropping resistor.
        1 panel lamp assembly.  Some come with bulbs.

           That's it.  You may trade this file however you wish.

  Introduction
  ============

  The Lunch Box is a VERY simple transmitter which can be handy for all sorts of
  things. It is quite small and can easily be put in a number of places. I have
  successfully used it for tapping fones, getting inside info, blackmail and
  other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the
  plans for an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just
  about anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in
  one box and use it as a walkie talkie.

                      from 2meg pot.


  Notes about the schematic
  =========================

  1.  GND means ground
  2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
      connected.
  3.  Where you see:  )(
                      ()
                      )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                         regular hook-up wire around it.
  4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run
      a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
      capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
  5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
  6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast
      approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
      broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an
      antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
      line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

  Operation of the Lunch Box
  ==========================

  This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
  variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
  freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to
  adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch on
  the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted,
  turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a friend
  say some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The
  plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

  The Lunch Box receiver

  Closing statement
  =================

  This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad. Using
  these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept NO
  responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used correctly.
  Hook it up to the red wire (I think) on the fone line and it will send the
  conversation over the air waves. If you have any problems or are confused,
  leave me mail on:Hi-Times=702/832/7469  Warez House=702/827/9273

        HOW TO BUILD AND USE A MAGENTA BOX.

        Designed and Written by Street Fighter.

  First of all I named this the Magenta Box because all of the
  fags that made boxes, whose only purpose is adding a hold
  button to your phone, used all of the fucking colors.  I can
  afford a fucking piece of shit Radio Shack 2-line phone with
  hold.  A box's purpose is to mess with the Telco., not to add
  a fucking hold button to your phone.  Anyway I will get on with
  this.

  PARTS LIST:
               SPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 9v, 500 ohm)
               DPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 6v, 500 ohms, 12 mA)
               2000 or so uF electrolytic capacitor
               1 meg resistor
               .01 uF capacitor

               some kind of a box (small)
               some 20 or 22 gauge wire to work with.

  If you don't know how to put together a project by looking at a
  schematic, then isn't the project to start with.  I would ask someone
  with some electronics knowledge to give you a helping hand.  This
  has to be put together on a pc-board.
  Enough talk, now the schematic:

  Whew!  Well, the schematic explains almost everything.  It would be
  helpful to you if you used one color for the line #1 clips and another
  for the line #2 clips.  It will work even if you get the ring and tip
  mixed up, but you must get all of the clips on the right line.  But,
  to be safe, you could put tags on each clip labeling it RING #1, TIP #2,
  ect.

  Installation.  Find one of those green posts that are about 3 feet high.
  They are everywhere.  Get a socket wrench to open it up.  There will
  be (a) row(s) of paired up posts.  Each pair of posts represents a line.
  YOU *MUST* KNOW THE NUMBER OF LINE #1.  Sometimes the number is tagged
  on to the pair of wires leading up to the posts, if so pick these posts
  as your line #1.  Then you can pick any other set of posts for line #2.

  Now to the good part.  Use of the the final product.  When you call up
  line one from your house you will get a dial tone almost immediately.
  Using DTMF you can dial anywhere that the person who owns line 2 has
  service to.  Which means you can direct dial alliance, Australia, and
  your favorite BBS for FREE.

  The Telco. will undoubtably discover the device after 2 days, so post
  the number on your favorite boards so you can abuse it while it is in
  service.  With a 2000 uF capacitor and a 1 meg resistor you will
  get a 50 minute call before it disconnects you.  By lowering the value
  of the resistor and capacitor you can change the time to your taste.
  So don't dial a wrong number, because you will have to wait 50 minutes
  until it resets again.  The formula for the time is the following:

  2*R1    C1              C1 is in microfarads
  ---- * ----             R1 is in Kohms
  100     10              See schematic for location of R1 and C1.
  -----------  = Minutes
      60

  The time produced by this formula is only approximate.

  Well, that is one of the more complicated boxes to build.  But it
  is very useful and will pay for itself with its first use.   It
  would be wise to remove it before the Telco. finds it so you won't
  have to make another, or install it on a line that belongs to a
  family that is on vacation (GOOD IDEA)

  Well, there it is.  I hope it saves you a lot of cash.


  If you wish to have one built for you.  Leave me E-mail on the Iron Curtain
  or the CornerStone or any other board I frequent.  It won't be more than $15,
  hopefully it will only be about $8.

       Please bear with me, as the construction of this box will seem rather
       silly.  This box was found in a construction site.  Or rather, it found
       us at a construction site.  We were using a $5 Radio Shack phone out of
       a semi-completed office building.  One afternoon during a holiday, and
       immediately following a storm, we found our bus in shambles.  To our
       suprise, we also found that one of the phone connections we were tapping
       had been draped through a murky puddle.  The fact that suprised us even
       more was that this line still worked and now posessed some great
       capibilities.


  Materials:

  2 tupperware or similar 8oz contianers
  1 small bag earth (dirt) (12oz)
  1 pint water
  2 lantern batteries
  1 nine volt battery
  1 battery clip
  2 SPST switches
  4 ounces of iron shavings
  2 polar magnets
  5 feet wire
  1 set soldering equipment


       This is the part you won't believe.  Take the tupperware containers, and
       fill them with a mixture of the earth and the iron shavings.  Make sure
       that the mixture is well done.  (*NOTE* for best results, use the sand in
       fine ash trays.)  Cut the cut the red and green wires and splice the
       switches into them.  From the switches, solder wire to the magnets.
       Connect the red to the + (positive) side of one magnet, and the green to
       the - (negative) side of the second magnet.  From the other poles of the
       magnet, solder wires the battery & clip.  Make sure the + (positive) and
       - (negative) are correct.  Set the nine-volt battery between the two
       tupperware containers and place the battery end of the two magnets into
       the tupperware.  Now connect wire to the two poles of the lantern
       battery, and place them in the same containers as the poles of the
       magnets/9-volt battery.  You are almost done.  Finally, add just enough
       water to the two pots, and let them sit in the sun and bake like bricks.
       at this point, you have a MAUVE BOX.



  Explaning and Using What You Have:

       The red and green wires have been places into a magnetic field which is
       being charged continually be a lantern battery.  (It is necessary to
       change this battery every one to one and a half months.)  This will
       literaly pull in the nearest phone conversatiion.  (Don't try this in a
       big apartment or dorm.)  When the 9-volt battery is connected, this will
       now create enough current for the poles of the magnets to reverse
       themselves (perhaps you're seen Mr. Wizard do this.  It's just like with
       the soap).  At this point, you have a phone transmitting to one (if not
       more) of the nearest phones.  (Again, if you're in a dorm, don't try
       this.)  I suppose this just accomplishes what a tap would do, but with a
       MAUVE BOX, your fingerprints never will show on a terminal or on
       someones telephone lines.


  Notes and Addendum:

       This will only work with a touch-tone phone connected to a phone line.
       When the switches are pulled, it's off your line and into the air.  This
       is named a MAUVE BOX, becuase this is the most disgusting box, and I find
       mauve to be the single most disgusting colour I know of.  Also, this file
       is for information purposes only.  This is not to be used in an illegal
       manner. Perhaps one of these by the pool, sending to your seth co-author,
       accept no responsibility for your actions with the MAUVE BOX. Thank you..
.

               THE NEON BOX
  --------------------------------------

  A NEON BOX IS A VERY SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR FONE, THAT WILL ALLOW A VERY
  CLEAR PASSAGE FROM YOUR COMPUTER TONES TO YOUR FONE.  IT ALSO WORKS GREAT FOR
  RECORDING TONES, SEX FONE, OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO RECORD OFF OF YOUR
  FONE.

               TOOLS:
               ------
  THIS MODIFICATION IS VERY SIMPLE, AND CAN BE USED ON MOST FONES, THOUGH IT IS
  MORE DIFFICULT ON ONE-PIECE UNITS.  ALL YOU NEED IS AN OLD PAIR OF HEADFONES,
  OR SIMILAR, A FILIPS SCREW- DRIVER, A SOLDERING IRON AND SOME SOLDER.

              INSTRUCTIONS
              ------------
  OPEN YOUR FONE WITH THE SCREWDRIVER.  WHEN OPENED, LOOK FOR THE RED AND BLACK
  WIRES THAT LEAD TO THE MOUTH- PIECE. (IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHICH WIRES LEAD TO
  THE MOUTHPIECE, OPEN UP THE MOUTHPIECE AND FIND THE SAME COLOR WIRES ON THE
  BASE. FOR ONE-PIECE UNITS, JUST LOCATE THE MOUTHPIECE).

  WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THE MOUTHPIECE, OR WIRES, CUT THE EARD OF THE HEAD- FONES
  OFF, AND ONE WIRE (THE ONE THAT LEADS TO THE RIGHT EAR). STRIP THE LEFT WIRE
  SO ABOUT AN EIGHTH INCH IS SHOWING. KEEP THE OTHER SIDE IN TACT.

  THEN ON THE RED WIRE, SOLDER THE WIRE THAT IS SEPARATLY SEALED FROM THE OTHER
  ONE. ON THE BLACK WIRE (THESE ARE THE ENDS OF THE WIRE ON THE CIR- CUIT BOARD)
  SOLDER THE WAIRE WRAPPED AROUND THE OTHER WIRE.  THEN SOLDER A HOLE FOR THE
  WIRE. YOU HAVE NOW MADE A NEON BOX.

      This is a relatively new box,  and all it basically does
  is  serve  as a  phone ringer.    You have  two choices  for
  ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),  or a standard
  8 ohm speaker.   The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it,
  but either will do fine.    This circuit can also be used in
  conjunction with a rust box to control an external something
  or other  when the  phone  rings.   Just  connect  the 8 ohm
  speaker output to the  inputs on  the rust box,  and control
  the pot to tune it to light the light (which can be replaced
  by a relay for external controlling) when the phone rings.

  The Pearl Box:Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes
  which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated correctly can pro-
  duce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other crucial
  tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.

  Materials you will need in order to build The Pearl Box:
  ========================================================
  C1, C2::::::::.5mf or .5uf ceramic disk capacitors
  Q1::::::::::::NPN transistor (2N2222 works best)
  S1::::::::::::Normally open momentary SPST switch
  S2::::::::::::SPST toggle switch
  B1::::::::::::Standard 9-Volt battery
  R1::::::::::::Single turn, 50k potentiometer
  R2::::::::::::  "     "    100k potentiometer
  R3::::::::::::  "     "    500k potentiometer
  R4::::::::::::  "     "    1meg potentiometer
  SPKR::::::::::Standard 8-ohm speaker
  T1::::::::::::Mini transformer (8-ohm works best)
  Misc.:::::::::Wire, solder, soldering iron, PC board or perfboard, box to
                contain the completed unit, battery clip

  Instructions for building The Pearl Box:
  ========================================

  Since the instruction are EXTREMELY difficult to explain in words, you will be
  given a schematic instead. It will be quite difficult to follow but try it any
  way. There is also a Hi-Res picture you can get that shows the schematic in
  great detail.

  Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few minor de-
  tails. The potentiometer area is rigged so that the left pole is connected to
  the center pole of the potentiometer next to it. The middle terminal of T1 is
  connected to the piece of wire that runs down to the end of the battery.

  Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
  ===================================
  You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this job a
  lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the potentiometers may be useful
  too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs.
  R1 is the knob for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the
  hundreds place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all
  the tones and S2 is for power.
  Step 1: Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
         (Example: For 2600 hz- R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
  Step 2: Hit the pushbutton switch and VWALA! You have the tone. If you don't
    have a tone recheck all connections and schematic. If you still don't have
    a tone call Brainstorm BBS:612-345-2815, The Bay:415-775-2384 or Pirate's
    Harbor:617-720-3600 and leave me e-mail stating what the scene is.

    Pink box allows you to hook two separate phone lines together to have
  three way calling with hold on either line, and well as bringing a dial tone
  into the conversation woth someone and allowing them to dial the number
  touch tone, and it will connect three way, and when they hang up, it will
  disconnect three way calling, no more playing with the hook for 3 way!!!

      Hook the RED and GREEN wires up to the appropriate terminals and hook the
  RCA jack to the output on your stereo.  Turn on your stereo at a good volume.
  Now call a friend.  To test the Box, hold down the switcn and hang up the
  phone.  The LED should go on and your friend should hear music.  If nothing
  happens, start over.  The hold is shut off if you pick up a phone on that line
  or your end hangs up.

    This will tell you how to make a
  portable silver box out of:

         A Radio Shack touch tone pad
         Some wire
         A Soldering iron
         And a SPDT switch

  NOTE: You should have an I.Q. above room tempature before
  attempting this.  Also, read all of this article before
  starting.

  WARNING: This may be hazardous to your freedom.

  1} Take off the plastic cover that stores the batteries and
  remove the screw that is in the center of the batteries. Now use
  a screw driver to pry open the box.
  2} Now you should have the two halves in your hands. On the side
  that has the circuit board, it should be held by two clips.
  Remove the circuit board now.

  3} You should now be able to see the back side of the keypad.
  Connecting the the key pad and the circuit board is a ribben
  cable. With the ribben ends connected to the keypad away from
  you, count from the left over four wires.  On the fourth wire,
  take and cut the plastic on either side on the wire.  Then
  desolder it.

  4} Now stare at the circuit board. Look at the connections of
  the chip.  (SEE FIG.) There should be four pins not connected to
  anything. On the ninth pin (first row, first pin) solder a 3
  inch wire to it. The other end goes to the left side of the spdt
  switch.

  5} Go back to the cable. Solder a 2 inch to the ribben cable you
  just took out. This is because it won't reach the switch. The
  other end goes to right side of the switch.

  6} Now take a two inch wire and solder it to the hole that the
  cable came out of. Becareful not to get solder on the other
  wires. Now take the other end and solder it to the middle of the
  switch.

  7} Make a hole in the top of the case to put the switch through.
  And put it back together.

  THE PIN >9< 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

           1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

  (Pretty cool eh?)

  _______________________________________

  Switch the switch left according to the way you soldered it to
  make silver box tones on the 3,6,9, and # keys.  Switch it to
  the right for a normal key pad.  Switching it to the middle does
  NOTHING!!!!

  This silver is small enough to fit in your pocket for phreaking
  at your nearest pay phone or where ever.

                          How to Construct a Purple Box.
                          ------------------------------


       The Purple Box is very simple to construct.  It takes only six components
  and a PC board if you want.  The Purple Box is a telephone hold button.  It
  will allow you to switch phones very easily.

       A red LED indicates when a party is on hold and is automatically
  extinguished when either party releases the line.

       To install your Purple Box, remove the telephone case and locate the red
  and green wires.  From the green wire, make a connection to L1 and from the
  red
  wire a connection to L2.

       To test the circuit, call a friend and then while pressing the push
  button, hang up the phone.  As soon as the phone is on the hook, you may let
  go
  of the push button.

  Introduction:

          So you want to be James Bond eh? So you want to be a private eye eh.
  Well here's your chance to pick up some very important clues or ideas using
  your neighbors telephone line. Forget about climbing a telephone pole this
  sort of boxing can be done on the ground.

  Purpose:

          To tap your neighbors line without your neighbor knowing it. You can
  also make FREE (let me repeat that) FREE!! Phone calls to your favorite
  K-RAD-GNEW-WAREZ boards.

  Materials:

  1. Line Man's headset (no you can't buy one that's why we're making one you
     IDIOT)
  2. Alligator clips (clips is Plural so you need Two)
  3. A phone (preferbly one of those one peice kind that like the ones with the
     numbers and the thing the hangs up on the ONE phone piece)
  4. A Telephone wall jack box or whatever they're called
  5. Some green and some red wire
  6. Some intelligence (very Much needed)

  Plans:

          First hook up your one piece phone to the wall jack box. Then take
  the alligator clips and attach red wire to one and green wire to the other
  one. You should have 2 alligator clips with wire attached. Now strip the
  wire and open the Wall jack box you have and attach the red wire with the
  red screw on the box and the green wire with the green screw on the box.
  Your stuff should look like this.

  Hints:
  \/\/\/- Green wire Alligator clip
  /\/\/\- Red   Wire Alligator Clip

  Using Your newly made device:

          Now that you have made or created your little Razz Box then you are
  ready to go outside and do your stuff. First go to a neighbor's house and
  find the black telephone wires. They should look like Example #1. Then cut
  off a bit of the plastic covering so the alligator clips go in easier and
  you now stick the alligator clips one on the right and one on the left side
  of the plastic wire as shown on the diagram. The Black plastic wire should
  look like the diagram. You should get a dialtone. If you do not then switch
  the alligator clips around till you do. Remember your neighbors can hear you
  as well so get one of the phones with the MUTE option so you can plug into
  theres quietly.

                          Red Boxing With Whistles
                             by THE RESEARCHER

  This article is presented as a news item only. It is not to be taken as an
  encouragement to make fraudulent telephone calls.

  Red boxing consists of simulating the tones produced when coins are
  deposited in a pay phone. Coin tones are beeps of 2200 Hz + 1700 Hz as
  follows:

  5 cents - 1 beep, 66 milliseconds duration.

  10 cents - 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds duration with 66 millisecond
  pause between beeps.

  25 cents - 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds duration with a 33 millisecond
  pause between beeps.

  Two methods have commonly been used by phone phreaks to produce these
  tones and make free calls.

  1. The traditional Red Box consisting of a pair of Wien-bridge oscillators
  with the timing controlled by 555 timer chips.

  2. Producing the signals with a computer which are recorded and then
  played back into the mouth piece of a pay phone.

  A third method has recently appeared which is a real mind blower. A phreak
  in the Midwest has extensively tested a method of red boxing which uses
  nothing more than a pair of brass or aluminum whistles. The whistles are
  1/4 inch in diameter by 4 inches long and are tuned by means of a wooden
  dowel rod which fits snugly inside. The whistles can be brought precisely
  on frequency by tuning them against a known signal source such as a
  computer capable of producing the tones. Once tuned, the whistles are
  glued or taped together so they can be blown together to produce the dual
  tone used in coin signaling.  It has been tested and proven that with a
  little practice these whistles can be used to make free calls. Now you can
  blow your money without spending a cent.

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------

    And now for all you basement engineers... Here's the ROCK BOX!  Basicly what
  the Rock Box does is channel the music from the stereo out to the phone line
  via the headphone output.  There are two models to this Box, the Basic Box
  and Advanced Box.  I would recommend the Advanced Box for better sound
  quality, although the Basic one get's the job done.  Well... Enough for the
  formalities, now for the Advanced Box!

    Now some of the Benifits of this wonderful little device is that you can
  record conversations, at whatever volume you want, without those bothersome
  beeps the answering machines make.  Or another fun thing is call up a Rodent
  Bridge and blast this thing with your stereo at full... Wala!  The bridge
  will most likely be clear, even they won't sit through that shit.  It is a
  good idea to hit Radio Shack for a project box and soderless curcuit board,
  because this can be messy and a project box can easily make you look like a
  pro.  One more use for it is if your computer can generate tones to match a
  Box of some sort, this makes a GREAT amplifier for it, with almost no loss in
  clearity.  If you have any problems with a humm or it intercepting radio
  transmittions, then call up good-old Bell and get a line static clearer dealy
  and splice that into the box via the outgoing line, which SHOULD clear it up.
  If that does not seem to help, try putting a 9v battery (you know, the square
  ones) on the red and green phone lines, because this will make up for the
  power the box drains from the line.  Hope you enjoy the plans and Be watching
  for more from me!  L8r...

     The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad
  conection, it can be used to crash a BBS or just make life
  miserable for those you seek to avenge.


  materials: 2 aligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister

  (plan wire will create greatest amount of static)

  (Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to
  the resister you are useing)


  Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover off.

  Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to
            box are connected too.

  Step (3): Hook your aligator clips to your (wire/resister).

  Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires
  connected to it, i think this disables the gound and call
  waiting and shit like that.

  Step (5): Now take one of the aligator clips and attach it to
  the upper most prong, and take the other and attach it to the
  lower middle prong.

  Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!

  How to build a SILVER box:


  Tools and materials :  Soldering Iron, Solder, Some 22 ga.wire, a SPDT switch,
  and a screwdriver.


  1) Unscrew your phone (must be a touch tone, desk type)
  2) Remove the mounted pad and take the clear plastic cover from the bottom.
  3) Hold the pad with the numbers 0, *, # facing you, and turn
  it upside down, so you can see the yellow pc board.
  4) You should see 2 black round doughnuts.
  5) Position the board so the solder points for the left doughnut face you.
  6) Count over four points from the left, and attach a (green) wire to that
     point.
  7) Between you and the doughnuts, there should be 2 long yellow
  capacitors.  To the right of these, and on the edge of the
  board there should be 3 gold contacts. We will use the one on the left.
  8) The contact originally is spot welded, so snip it open.
  9) To the one nearest you, attach a (red) wire to the other one, a (yellow)
     wire.
  10) Run the wires out of the phone, and solder the switch.
  11) The orientation should be (red) to center. The switch will
  now alternate between normal and 1633hz fourth column tones.
           SILVER BOX DOCUMENTATION

         (CONTRIBUTED BY LEX LUTHOR)

  THE SILVER BOX TRANSFORMS KEYS 3,6,9,# TO A,B,C,D.
  THOSE TONES STAND FOR:
  "A"- FLASH
  "B"-FLASH OVERRIDE (PRIORITY
  "C"-PRIORITY COMMUNICATION
  "D"-PRIORITY OVERIDE (TOP MILITARY)
  THOSE KEYS ONLY WORK ON CERTAIN NETWORKS. NOW WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE EXTRA
  TONES??? CALL ANY LONG DISTANCE DIRECTORY BY DIALING (AREA CODE) 555-1212
  AND WHILE IT RINGS PRESS THE # KEY THEN AS THE OPERATOR ANSWERS YOU WILL
  DISCONNECT THEM INSTANTLY AND HEAR A PULSING TONE, PRESS 6(NORMAL TON
  E) AND IT WILL STOP.THEN IF ANOTHER  PERSON DOES THE SAME THING ON ANOTHER
  LINE AND THEN PRESSES 7 YOU SHOULD HAVE A VOICE LINK, 414 A/C IS GOOD FOR ONE
  THAT YOU CAN SCREW AROUND WITH THE TONES AND SEE WHAT YOU GET.

                  How to
            Build a SILVER BOX
  =======================================
  ATTENTION:
    BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLDER!  THIS
  COULD PERMENANTLY DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!!!
  READ EVERYTHING BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Ingreadients:
       1    Blue wire about 1 foot.
       1    Gray wire about 1 foot.
       1    Brown wire about 1 foot.
            (Better to overkill....)
       1    Single pole/Double throw
            (SPDT) switch. (Smallest
            you can find.)
       1    Standard bell phone.

  Tools:
       1    Soldering Iron and Solder.
       1    flat-tip screwdriver.
       1    Very patcient person.
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  1:   Take the casing off your phone by loosening the two screws
  underneath it.  (Don't take the screws all the way off!)

  2:   Loosen (But don't remove) the screws on the side of the
  touch- tone keypad. (The ones that attach it to the mounting
  bracket.) and CAREFULLY remove the keypad from the mounting
  bracket.

  3:   You will notice a plastic cover on the keypad; seperate the
  two halves and get the out of your way. (Don't destroy them, you
  will need them later.)

  4:   Now, look at the top of the pad (so the 123 row is facing
  away, and the *0# row is toward you.  Turn over the keypad. You
  should see a mass of wires, gold plated contacts, discrete
  components, and two large doughnut shaped black thingies. (These
  are the coils hat make the touch-tone frequencies.  All you are
  going to do is connect the wires that Ma Bell "Forgot" to.)

  5:   Look at the coil on the left (with 5 solder contacts facing
  you, rather than being perpendicular to you.) Count over 4
  contacts FROM the left (or 2 conacts FROM the right) and solder
  the GRAY wire to the fourth post FROM the left.

  6:   Solder the other end of the GRAY wire to the LEFT pole of
  the SPDT switch.

  7:   (The point of no return)..........  Take a look at the
  bottom edge of the keypad. You should see a row of three gold
  plated contacts (to the right of two very large capasitors) look
  at the one on the left and GENTELY seperate the two touching
  connectors (They are soldered together with a drop of solder)
  and spread them apart.

  8:   Solder the brown wire to the top contact (The one futhest
  from you), and solder it to the RIGHT pole of SPDT switch.

  9:   Now, take the blue wire and solder it to the bottom
  (Closest) contact.  Solder the other end of this wire to the
  CENTER pole of SPDT switch.

  ***************************************
                   DONE
  ***************************************

  10:  Now put you phone back together.  (To make it look
  professonal, make a hole in the plastic top of your phone and
  stick the SPDT switch through it.

    Now, (Hopefully) when the switch is in on position you will
  have a normal phone and when it is in the other position the 3,
  6, 9, and # keys (Which are now the A, B, C, and D keys) will
  magically produce the SILVER BOX TONES!

               USING A
             SILVER  BOX
  -----------------------------------
    First off, a silver box adds the four extra tones to your
  phone that Ma Bell never told you about. They go like this:

                 1  2  3  A
                 4  5  6  B
                 7  8  9  C
                 *  0  #  D

    There used to be many places were you could use SILVER BOX
  tones, but now you can only use it in places were Ma Bell hasn't
  gotten around to replacing here old switchboxes, (4A), or on
  Autovan.

    Autovan is a special military phone line, like a mass of
  private lines hooked together (I think, but I'm not sure).

    To see if a specific area has the old 4A switchboxes try this
  test:

    Call up there directory assistance by using XXX-555-1212,
  (Where XXX is the area code you are check out. Now hold down the
  "D" key as soon as you finish dialing. (If you are using the
  SILVER BOX that I showed you how to make; Switch to SILVER BOX
  tones and hold down the "#" key.) The phone should start ringing
  and the operator will answer.
    If the operator screams at you to stop pressing your keypad,
  then hang up and try a diffrent areacode. (This one does not
  work.)

    If you get a pulsing tone the you got a good line! Now try out
  different numbers. 6 and 7 usually form a loop line and two
  people with SILVER BOXES can talk. But some of these are
  whatched, so DON'T say anything you wouldn't want your mother to
  hear!

    I have heard the 213 works but is being watched. Try out of
  the way states like Iowa, Monatana, Wyoming, ect...  Have Phun,

  Agrajag

  The Static Box
Created and Brought to You by: The Usurper and The Raver
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

  We were looming at the Aqua Box plans and we saw something about static on
  long-distance calls in the file.  It said that you get static because the
  voltage is not getting regulated very well.  So why not have a box that keeps
  the voltage regulated so that you can avoid static?  This would be very useful
  when calling a BBS with an extender that flakes-out and gives you garbage on
  the screen.  So here it is...

  * Note: These are our first box plans with schematics, and electronics that I
          made, so bear with me.  And yes, this has been tested.


                                   EQUIPMENT

  1. (2) Size 'AA' Batteries, and holder (You could use a adapter, so you won't
         have to buy batteries...ex. A 3,6,9,12 volt adapter in one!)
  2. (1) Two fone line connector (Has two plugs from one)
  3. (1) Modular plug w/6 inches of colored wire connected.
  4.     2 feet of telephone wire
  5. (1) 100k Resistor
  6.     Soldering Iron
  7.     Solder.....get all of this at Radio Shack of course!


                                    SCHEMATIC
                                                            __________  Two-way

                                   INSTRUCTIONS

  Have your phone connected to one of the plugs, then if you want to use the
  Static box plug it into the other one and put the batteries in the case.  That
  will remove static.  This will be useful in using 2400 baud on an extender
  (because of shitty lines).  You may want to make the voltage 9 volts, with a 9
  volt battery holder.  What the hell, make two, one for 3 volts (Normal stuff),
  and one for 9 volts (Special connections like 2400 baud on a extender).  Be
  sure not to leave it hooked up, because it may make your phone act funny, and
  people may not get calls through!  You could use even a bigger voltage, an use
  it as "Lock 'n Trace", and make some asshole squirm!

  NOTE: This is the second release of this file.  A few slight modifications to
        the file structure had to be made.  Originally released on 11/21/86.
        The new release date is 12/27/87.  Merry Christmas, have a nice day, and
        don't forget to fuck your sister for us, eh?  This has been a Lords of
        Twilight release... big fuckin' deal, eh?

  If you open the back of a TV, there's the neck of the picture tube sticking
  out the back. It has a 'yoke' around it that is made of two large
  saddle-shaped coils, usually of lacquered copper wire. Sometimes the coils are
  wrapped in tape or plastic or an insulation of some kind, but they're usually
  just copper.

    _____
   |     \   Yoke (wraps around tube neck)
   |      \  =====
   |       \-----------\-|
   | Picture Tube      |-| (plug on END of tube neck remains connected)
   |       /-----------/-|
   |      /  =====\
   |_____/   Yoke  \ Wires from YOKE to CHASSIS
                    \ (cut these and connect YOKE to STEREO)
                     \
                      \ (leave the CHASSIS end of the wires UNCONNECTED)
   -------------------------
  | TV Chassis              |
   -------------------------


  OK. Sometimes there is a bundle of wires or a multi-wire cable that goes from
  the yoke coil to the chassis. (the yoke coil defects the light spot back and
  forth so that it scans out the TV picture. Check an encyclopedia or TV repair
  book at a library for illustrations or block diagrams etc. if this isn't
  clear) anyway, the yoke coil will be connected to the main chassis/circuitry
  of the TV set by several wires, sometimes there's a cable connector or
  multi-pin plug/socket arrangement on the end. What you have to do is
  disconnect ALL wires that lead from the chassis to the yoke coils (do this
  with the TV _OFF_ : HIGH VOLTAGE!!!). If the yoke wires have a connector,
  just unplug it from the chassis. If the yoke wires are soldered on to the
  chassis you will have to cut them. There will also be wires running from a
  plug/socket on the very end of the neck of the picture tube. Leave these
  connected - they are needed to warm up the picture tube so you get an image
  on the screen.

  Now,  turn the tv on and carefully touch a pair of speaker wires connected to
  a playing stereo, (or just run a 9 volt battery over to the yoke wires) try
  out various pairs of wires until you see the spot of light that will be in
  the center of the TV picture (you have disabled scanning and should only see
  one dot on the face of the picture tube) uh, try connecting voltage or
  speaker audio into pairs of yoke wires until you have determined which two
  pair of wires move the dot vertically and which pair move it horizontally.
  You can use a mirror to watch the TV while fiddling about in back with the
  yoke wires. Once you have determined the vertical and horizontal pairs, just
  run a set of speaker wires from your stereo over to the yoke pairs and turn
  up the volume, and adjust the left-right balance until the music or radio you
  are listening to makes the screen scribble around and pulsate to the music.

  If you have an oscilloscope, it's even easier - just put the oscilloscope in
  X/Y mode and feed one channel of a walkman into the horizontal probe and the
  other channel (left/right channels here) into the vertical sweep probe. The
  oscilloscope will display a scribble of the music coming from the walkman.

  Old black and white TVs work better than color TVs for making scribble
  visions. The only requirement is that light appears on the screen when you
  turn on the TV set (that is, you can see the scanning pattern). You may have
  to adjust contrast and brightness to get the best scribble trace on the
  screen.

  If you are using a 'good' TV you might want to install DPDT switches to switch
  back and forth between scribble and normal TV modes. Make sure the DPDT
  switches isolate the chassis scanning signals from your stereo completely or
  you can blow things out.


       This is a diagram of the contacts on the bottom of a DPDT switch.
       Make two of these, one for the Left/Horizontal Yoke-to-Stereo
       connections and one for the Right/Vertical Yoke-to-Stereo connections.
       You only need to do this if you want to switch back and forth
       between TV and Scribblevision modes. Make SURE the Chassis wires
       will get connected to their original corresponding Yoke wires when
       the switch is flipped.

                                 |wire to Yoke Coil
                                 |
                       ------o   o   o-----
     wires from chassis                   wires from stereo
                       ------o   o   o-----
                                 |
                                 |wire to Yoke Coil


  You can also reverse the leads from the chassis to the yoke to make the TV
  display a mirror image or upside-down picture. Mirror reversal is convenient
  if you don't want to be forced to read adversizement graphics when they
  appear on the screen.

  Oh, if you watch a mono audio source in scribble-vision mode, you will just
  see a diagonal line instead of a full scribble pattern. You might have to
  adjust the tone controls on the stereo in a wierd way because bass sounds
  make larger patterns than treble sounds, but treble sounds produce more
  complex textures. Experiment around.

  Now at last, Underground_Elite brings you these ultrasophisticated box plans
  for, well, uh, I guess we just kind of bring them for you. After many months
  of keeping this puppy secret, we here at Underground_Elite have finally come
  to the consensus that the public oughtn't be kept in the dark from the wrath
  of Ma Bell, that great telephone company in the sky.

  The Urine Box (tm) basically creates a capacitative disturbance between the
  ring and tip wires in another's telephone headset. I have utilized this to the
  distinct advantage of the operator of the Urine box and to the disadvantage
  of the other party involved, hopefully you won't get caught.

  Without further a doo, wire this schematic together. Copper wire (or gold)
  will work best due to its lessened resistance. It might be a good idea to
  keep the wiring cooled, to further reduce current loss.

  note1 - VR1 is a three position variable resistor, enabling settings
  equivalent to 100k ohms, 210k ohms, and 320k ohms (all 110k apart).

  note2 - The diodes are silicon-germanium based bipolar RF reducers to limit
  current polarity reversal. If these are placed backwards the box will not
  work as intended.

  note3 - The speaker will emit low tones when the SPST is closed (ie the box
  is "ON") and when the settings of VR1 are moved to higher resistance the tone
  level will increase.

  note4 - Place setting evaluation symbols to represet the lowest resistance
  setting for VR1 to be "STEAM", the second (210) to be "MELT", the third (320)
  to be "VAPORIZE".

  Usage of box.

  Use in place of your normal telephone receiver. Do not attempt usage as a
  regular phone. Call victim by sending tones through speaker with tape recorded
  noise. Use touch tone sounds as pulse requires electric disruption of line,
  not just audio. After answer (listen in on SPKR 1) set VR1 to desired strength
  and let her go. Victim will feel unpleasant sensations in his/her head and
  will undergo a series of high intensity seizures, not unlike epilepsy, and
  jointly proportional to VR-1 setting and time induced.

  Settings. (The Fun Part)

  STEAM. A short -poof- of water vapor condenses within the victim's earpiece,
         rendering the telephone short circuited and the victim quite dazed.
  MELT.  Causes structural phase change of receiver (usually reinforced
         ureaformaldehyde plastic material - high tech). This has the unpleasant
         bonus of removing the victim's hand.
  VAPORIZE. If the victim is particularly nasty, this setting will remove his
         upper anatomy (if box is enabled properly, that is!). Continued usage
         of this setting is generally not recommended, as death or other serious
         injury will accompany.

  Disclaimer.

  Yes, I will refuse to take responsibility for your incompetence in electrical
  doings. This includes my reluctance to give court testimony, etc. etc.

  This article will tell you how to change a normal touch tone
  keypad and convert it to a portable unit. In addition, we
  give the touch-tone frequencies.

  First of all, the tones made by a touch tone telephone are not
  single tones, they are a combination of two tones, making "DTMF"
  (dual tone multi-frequency). The normal tone telephone dials 12
  different signals, but is capable of dialing 16 different signals
  (see bulletin on silver boxes).

  The power required by a keypad is about 25 volts, but they will
  work with as little as 15, thereby allowing the use of two 9-
  volt radio batteries.  As you may have guessed, they are also
  designed to operate with a telephone type speaker (and phone
  line), and not the standard 8-ohm speaker which needs to be used
  for adequate volume.  To accompolish this, we use a matching
  transformer, this is one of those miniature ones available at
  Radio Shack.  Enough of the theory, now for the circuit.

  You will need:

  A touch tone keypad
  A miniature 1000 to 8 ohm transformer (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
  A standard 8-ohm speaker
  Two 9-volt radio batteries
  Two 9-volt battery clips
  A case to put it all in (optional)

  A few construction notes, I suggest that you solder and tape all
  connections.  It is also important to read this entire bulletin
  before attempting to construct this.

  First, connect the RED wire of the transformer to either
  terminal on the speaker.  Now connect the WHITE wire from the
  transformer to the other terminal on the speaker.  Next, connect
  the RED (positive) wire of one battery clip to the black wire of
  the other battery clip.  Now connect the the remaining RED wire
  on the second battery clip to the GREEN wire from the touch tone
  pad.  Connect the BLUE wire from the touch tone pad to the
  ORANGE-and-BLACK striped wire from the touch tone pad.  To these
  two wires, now connect the remaining black lead from first
  battery clip.  You have now finished the power connection to the
  keypad.  Connect the BLACK wire from the keypad to the BLUE wire
  on the transformer.  Next connect the RED-and-GREEN striped wire
  from the keypad to the GREEN wire on the transformer.  The BLACK
  wire on the transformer should not be connected to anything,
  along with quite a few wires from the keypad.  The connection of
  the keypad is now complete.  All you have to do is connect two
  nine volt batteries to the battery clips, and you'll be ready to
  go. You may want to mount it in a case for easy portability.
  Note that the silver box modification CAN be made to this unit,
  allowing complete remote phreaking.  When none of the buttons
  are pressed, this unit uses NO power, thereby eliminating the
  need for a power switch, and extending the life of the
  batteries.

  The following are the frequency combinations generated by each
  button on the keypad.

  D       941             1633

  All frequencies are measured in Hertz
  Note that A,B,C and D are not normally present (except for silver boxes)

   Now to begin with you need the following:


  1) A telephone line showing up in the wall.You can find the
     opening behind all those round plates AT&T puts in when they
     disconnect or begin to put a phone in.

  2) 1 Modular jack

  3) 1 Screwdriver

  4) 1 Human being who knows what the hell their doing!!!!  (in
     other words an IQ of 3 or so will do)

  PREPARATION:

  1) Open the plate to expose the wire running through the wall or
     you can remove an old jack to find the wire.(Note: it must be a
     complete wire not an end as is used for the setup of a normal
     phone)

  2) Cut the wire in half.Now check your other phones (Note: i had
     2 other phones so one works the other won't)

  3) Now splice up the 2 ends of the wire you just cut.You will
     find 4 or 6 color coded wires on each end.

  4) Splice up each smaller wire so as the metal is exposed.
  5) Next now this is the hard part look at the jack at match the
     colors Note: if you cant do this:

               a) get a very sharp razor blade
               b) now put to the wrists and slice that.
               c) wait about an hour and your dead KINDA FINAL ISNT IT!!!!!

  6) Each screw will now have 2 of each colore wire on it.

  7) Plug in the phone. YOUR DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  NOTE:THIS PROCESS IS IRREVERSABLE!!!!
