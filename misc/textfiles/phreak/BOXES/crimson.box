The Crimson Box is very simple device
that will allow you to put someone on
hold or make your fone busy with a
large amount of ease. You flip a switch
and the person can't hear you talking.
Flip it back and everything is peechy.

(*)   Needed Materials  (*)
(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)

(1) 100 ohm or less resistor
(1) SPDT toggle switch, On-On
(3) feet of good wire

Wire cutters

Solder and soldering iron

First I will give you the schematic and
then I will explain what the hell is
going on.

[-----------black wire on line---------
--------+   red wire on line   +------
--------!--+/\/\/-green wire---!------
--------!--! yellow wire-------!------
        !  !                   !
        +--!------+            !
           +----+ ! +----------+
                ! ! !
                1 2 3

Ok. The '/\/\/' is the resistor. And
'1 2 3' is the switch where the numbers
are the poles on the switch. Notice you
leave the black and yellow wires alone.
You DO NOT cut them!

Strip the red and green wires so you've
got about an inch of bare wire. Solder
some of the extra wire and follow the
schematic. You should have the resistor
on the green wire with an extra piece
of wire coming from one leg of it. The
other leg goes to the other end of the
green wire. You should solder the green
wire to the left pole of the switch and
the red to the middle and the other
end of the red to the right pole.

Now, lift up the phone. If all you get
is an annoying buzz then throw the
[switch and you should get a dial tone.

If not, don't worry and just follow the
instructions and schematic again.
