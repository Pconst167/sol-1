        BLUE BOX FREQUENCIES:

2600 HZ - USED TO GET ON/OFF TRUNK

TONE MATRIX TO USE AFTER 2600 HZ.

USE KP (1700+1100) TO START A CALL AND
ST (1500+1700) TO STOP. USE 2600 HZ TO
DISCONNECT.

            RED BOX FREQS:

   1700 HZ AND 2200 HZ MIXED TOGETHER

  A NICKEL IS 66 MS ON (1 BEEP). A DIME
IS 66MS ON, 66MS OFF, 66MS ON (2 BEEPS)
A QUARTER IS 33MS ON, 33MS OFF REPEATED
5  TIMES. (MS= MILLISECOND). FOR  THOSE
OF  YOU  WHO   DONT  KNOW,  A  RED  BOX
SIMULATES MONEY  BEING  PUT  INTO A PAY
PHONE. YOU MUST PUT IN SOME MONEY FIRST
THOUGH (THE OPERATOR  CAN TELL IF MONEY
WAS PUT IN BUT AS TO HOW MUCH, SHE LETS
THE COMPUTER ANSWER THAT)

         TASI LOCKING FREQ:

  TASI   (  TIME    ASSIGNMENT   SPEECH
INTERPOLATION )  IS  USED  ON  SATELITE
TRUNKS, AND BASICALLY  ALLOWS MORE THAN
ONE PERSON TO USE A  TRUNK  BY  PUTTING
THEM ON  WHILE  THE OTHER  PERSON  ISNT
TALKING. OF  COURSE,  YOU'D  NEVER HEAR
THE OTHER PERSON TALKING ON YOUR TRUNK.

  WHEN YOU START TO  TALK, HOWEVER, THE
TASI CONTROLLER  HAS TO  FIND  AN  OPEN
TRUNK FOR YOU. BECAUSE  OF  THIS,  SOME
OF YOUR SPEECH  IS LOST( BECAUSE OF THE
DELAY  IN  FINDING  A  TRUNK)  THIS  IS
CALLED CLIPPING.

  WELL,  IF YOU WERE  TRANSMITTING DATA
OVER  A  TRUNK,  CLIPPING  WOULD REALLY
FUCK UP THE DATA. SO THERE IS SOMETHING
CALLED A TASI  LOCKING FREQUENCY  WHICH
KEEPS THE TASI FROM PUTTING ANYONE ELSE
ON YOUR TRUNK OR  YOU  ON  ANYONE ELSES
TRUNK. IN ANY CASE  THE FREQ.  IS  1850
HZ. SENT BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION).
