 Now to begin with you need the 
   following:


1) A telephone line showing up in the
    wall.You can find the opening
   behind all those round plates
  AT&T puts in when they disconnect
  or begin to put a phone in.
2) 1 Modular jack

3) 1 Screwdriver

4) 1 Human being who knows what
   the hell their doing!!!!
   (in other words an IQ of 3 or so
    will do)

PREPARATION:

1)  open the plate to expose the wire
    running through the wall or you ca
   n remove an old jack to find the 
   wire.(Note: it must be a complete 
    wire not an end as is used for the
    setup of a normal phone)
2) Cut the wire in half.Now check your
   other phones (Note: i had 2 other
   phones so one works the other wont
   )
3) Now splice up the 2 ends of the
   wire you just cut.You will find
    4 or 6 color coded wires on each
    end.
4) Splice up each smaller wire so as
   the metal is exposed.
5) Next now this is the hard part
   look at the jack at match the color
   s(Note:if you cant do this:
   a) get a very sharp razor blade
   b) now put to the wrists and slice
     that.
   c) wait about an hour and your dead
    KINDA FINAL ISNT IT!!!!!
6) each screw will now have 2 of each
    colore wire on it.
7) Plug in the phone.

YOUR DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE:THIS PROCESS IS IRREVERSABLE!!!!
