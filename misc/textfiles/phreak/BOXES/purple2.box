       How to construct a Purple Box.
       ------------------------------

      Written 03 Mar 1986 by The Flash
      ================================

     The Purple Box is very simple to construct.  I takes only six components
and a PC board if you want.  The Purple Box is a telephone hold button.  It
will allow you to switch phones very easily.

     A red LED indicates when a party is on hold and is automatically
extinguished when either party releases the line.

     To install your Purple Box, remove the telephone case and locate the red
and green wires.  From the green wire make A CONNECTION TO L2 and from the
red wire a connection to L1.

     To test the circuit, call a friend and then while pressing the push
button, hang-up the phone.  As soon as the phone is on the hook, you may let
go of the push button.

Parts:

     D1 = Light Emitting Diode (LED)
     D2 = 1N4003 Diode
     R1 = 820 ohm 1/2 Watt
     R2 = 1K ohm  1/2 Watt
     S1 = N.O. Push Button    S1
   SCR1 = C106B1  __|__

  To Red  To Green


  The SCR is a three prong PNPN.  The a,g, and c tell you what pins to use.
The "g" pin is the one closest to the notch.
