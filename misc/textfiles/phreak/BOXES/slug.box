        Hack Week Feature Box-    Slug Box

        A slug box is basic recording box. Unit does not require power
        from phone line so no need to worry about tap detectors.
        The slug box stops and starts the tape recorder when a connection
        is made. You can you this to record phone or modem conversations.
        I think this box is perfect for recording data because it
        doesn't cause line noise etc.

        To make a slug box you need the following:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        (1) 220 ohm 1/4 watt resistor   r3
        (1) 39 k 1/4 watt resistor      r2
        (2) 100k 1/4 watt resistor      r1
        (2) .01 uF/50 V disk cap        c4
        (1) PN2222 npn silicon          q6
        (1) PN2907 pnp silicon          q5
        (1) 15 V zener diode            z1
        (1) Sub mini plug molded daimond tip connector 2.5mm    p7
        (2) alligator clips             cl1,2
        (1) mini plug molded daimond tip connector 3.5mm        p8
        (1) plastic cap or suitable enclosure                   ca1
        (1) 1 1/4 x 1 1/6 perfboard .1 x .1                     pb1
        (18") #24 hookup black wire                             wr4
        (18") #24 hookup red wire                               wr3

        @p1 is a plug wired for a radio shack recorder
        @p2 is to auxiliary
      Note: Connect to any phone line, connect via aligator clips


        Constuction
        -----------
        1) Layout perfboard as shown and assemble using standerd
        wire and soldering.
        2) attach P1 and P2 to their respective points. P1 is usaully a
        2.5 mm while P2 are 3.5mm, for remote and aux ports on most
        recorders
        3) verify proper soldering
        4) get a decent recorder and a tape
        5) plug in P1 and P2. In some recorders P1 and P2 might have
        to be reversed.
        6) connect leads to phone line
        7) set recorder to record mode

        This should be all correct. If you have problems just
        leave me mail on Fourth Dimension #2 or just leave feedback.
