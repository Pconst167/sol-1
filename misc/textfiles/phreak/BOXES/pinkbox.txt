   The function of a Pink Box is to add a hold button that allows music or
anything else to be played into the telephone while the person is on hold.
This box can either be built right in the telephone or as a seperate box.

    some Bell wire or phone wire
    a SPST momemtary switch       RS # 275-1547
    one resistor, 470 ohms        RS # 271-019
    one LED, 5 volts              RS # 276-041
    one SCR, number 2N5061
    audio transformer (Ratio 10K:600)
(Pause)...More(y/n/ns)? ns
    RCA phono jack                RS # 274-346
    screwdrivers, soldering iron, solder, etc.
 
/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=> Construction <=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=\=/=
 
 1. Open the wall box and locate the RED and GREEN wires.
 2. Take a piece of RED wire, strip the end, and attach it to the red lead on
    the wall box.  Do the same for the GREEN.
 3. Connect the GREEN wire to the ANODE end of the LED.
 4. Connect the CATHODE end of the LED to the UPPER pin of the primary side of
    the transformer (See diagram below).
                           _____
   To one phono pole   ---! Top !--- To CATHODE of LED
                         -!View !- Primary side
 To other phono pole   ---!_____!--- To pole or trans. & one pole of switch
 
 5. Connect the pin directly across to one pole of the phono jack.
 6. Connect the RED wire to one side of resistor and to the C pole of the
    transistor.
 7. Connect the open pin of the switch the other side of the resistor and to
    the G pole of the transistor.

    Hook the RED and GREEN wires up to the appropriate terminals and hook the
RCA jack to the output on your stereo.  Turn on your stereo at a good volume.
Now call a friend.  To test the Box, hold down the switcn and hang up the
phone.  The LED should go on and your friend should hear music.  If nothing
happens, start over.  The hold is shut off if you pick up a phone on that line
