A Cheesebox(named for the type of box the first one was found in)is a type of
box which will, in effect, make your telephone a Pay-Phone.....This is a
simple,modernized, and easy way of doing it....

Inside Info:These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way of making
calls to people without being called by the cops or having their numbers traced
and/or tapped......

     How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

     Ingredients:
     ------------

1 Call Forwarding service on the line

1 Set of Red Box Tones

The number to your prefix's Inter- cept operator(do some scanning for this one)

     How To:
     -------

After you find the number to the intercept operator in your prefix, use your
call-forwarding and forward all calls to her...this will make your phone stay
off the hook(actually, now it waits for a quarter to be dropped in)...you now
have a cheese box...  In Order To Call Out On This Line:You must use your Red
Box tones and gener- ate the quarter dropping in...then,you can make phone
calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly safe, and they do not check
much...Although I am not sure, I think you can even make credit-card calls from
a cheesebox phoneand not get traced...
