      HOW TO BUILD AND USE A MAGENTA BOX.


First of all I named this the Magenta Box because all of the
fags that made boxes, whose only purpose is adding a hold
button to your phone, used all of the fucking colors.  I can
afford a fucking piece of shit Radio Shack 2-line phone with
hold.  A box's purpose is to fuck with the Telco., not to add
a fucking hold button to your phone.  Anyway I will get on with
this.

PARTS LIST:
             SPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 9v, 500 ohm)
DPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 6v, 500 ohms, 12 mA)
             2000 or so uF electrolytic capacitor
             1 meg resistor
             .01 uF capacitor
             555 timer chip
           2 diodes (1N914)
             10 K resistor
             1 K resistor
             9 volt battery -w- clip
             Pc Board
             4 alligator clips
             some kind of a box (small)
             some 20 or 22 gauge wire to work with.

If you don't know how to put together a project by looking at a
schematic, then isn't the project to start with.  I would ask someone
with some electronics knowledge to give you a helping hand.  This
has to be put together on a pc-board.  Enough talk, now the schematic:

Whew!  Well, the schematic explains almost everything.  It would be
helpful to you if you used one color for the line #1 clips and another
for the line #2 clips.  It will work even if you get the ring and tip
mixed up, but you must get all of the clips on the right line.  But,
to be safe, you could put tags on each clip labeling it RING #1, TIP #2,
ect.

Installation.  Find one of those green posts that are about 3 feet high.
They are everywhere.  Get a socket wrench to open it up.  There will
be (a) row(s) of paired up posts.  Each pair of posts represents a line.
YOU *MUST* KNOW THE NUMBER OF LINE #1.  Sometimes the number is tagged
on to the pair of wires leading up to the posts, if so pick these posts
as your line #1.  Then you can pick any other set of posts for line #2.

Now to the good part.  Use of the the final product.  When you call up
line one from your house you will get a dial tone almost immediately.
Using DTMF you can dial anywhere that the person who owns line 2 has
service to.  Which means you can direct dial alliance, Australia, and
your favorite BBS for FREE.

The Telco. will undoubtably discover the device after 2 days, so post
the number on your favorite boards so you can abuse it while it is in
service.  With a 2000 uF capacitor and a 1 meg resistor you will
get a 50 minute call before it disconnects you.  By lowering the value
of the resistor and capacitor you can change the time to your taste.
So don't dial a wrong number, because you will have to wait 50 minutes
until it resets again.  The formula for the time is the following:

2*R1    C1              C1 is in microfarads
---- * ----             R1 is in Kohms
100     10              See schematic for location of R1 and C1.
-----------  = Minutes
    60

The time produced by this formula is only approximate.

Well, that is one of the more complicated boxes to build.  But it
is very useful and will pay for itself with its first use.   It
would be wise to remove it before the Telco. finds it so you won't
have to make another, or install it on a line that belongs to a
family that is on vacation (GOOD IDEA)

Well, there it is.  I hope it saves you a lot of cash.


I, Street Fighter, designed this box
for the sole purpose of fucking over
Ma Bell.  It is not for imformational
purposes, but to be used to cost the
TelCo. thousands of dollars.
