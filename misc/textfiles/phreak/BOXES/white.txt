THIS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU HOW TO CHANGE A NORMAL TOUCH TONE KEYPAD AND
CONVERT IT TO A PORTABLE UNIT. IN ADDITION, WE GIVE THE TOUCH-TONE
FREQUENCIES.

FIRST OF ALL, THE TONES MADE BY A TOUCH TONE TELEPHONE ARE NOT SINGLE TONES,
THEY ARE A COMBINATION OF TWO TONES, MAKING "DTMF" (DUAL TONE MULTI-
FREQUENCY). THE NORMAL TONE TELEPHONE DIALS 12 DIFFERENT SIGNALS, BUT IS
CAPABLE OF DIALING 16 DIFFERENT SIGNALS (SILVER BOX).

THE POWER REQUIRED BY A KEYPAD IS ABOUT 25 VOLTS, BUT THEY WILL WORK WITH AS
LITTLE AS 15, THEREBY ALLOWING THE USE OF TWO 9-VOLT RADIO BATTERIES. AS YOU
MAY HAVE GUESSED, THEY ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO OPERATE WITH A TELEPHONE TYPE
SPEAKER (AND PHONE LINE), AND NOT THE STANDARD 8-OHM SPEAKER WHICH NEEDS TO BE
USED FOR ADEQUATE VOLUME. TO ACCOMPOLISH THIS, WE USE A MATCHING TRANSFORMER;
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MINIATURE ONES AVAILABLE AT RADIO SHACK ENOUGH OF THE
THEORY, NOW FOR THE CIRCUIT.


YOU WILL NEED:

A TOUCH TONE KEYPAD
A MINIATURE 1000 TO 8 OHM TRANSFORMER
   (RADIO SHACK # 273-1380)
A STANDARD 8-OHM SPEAKER
TWO 9-VOLT RADIO BATTERIES
TWO 9-VOLT BATTERY CLIPS
A CASE TO PUT IT ALL IN (OPTIONAL)

A FEW CONSTRUCTION NOTES; I SUGGEST THAT YOU SOLDER AND TAPE ALL CONNECTIONS.
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO READ THIS ENTIRE BULLETIN BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO
CONSTRUCT THIS.

FIRST, CONNECT THE RED WIRE OF THE TRANSFORMER TO EITHER TERMINAL ON THE
SPEAKER. NOW CONNECT THE WHITE WIRE FROM THE TRANSFORMER TO THE OTHER TERMINAL
ON THE SPEAKER. NEXT, CONNECT THE RED (POSITIVE) WIRE OF ONE BATTERY CLIP TO
THE BLACK WIRE OF THE OTHER BATTERY CLIP. NOW CONNECT THE REMAINING RED WIRE
ON THE SECOND BATTERY CLIP TO THE GREEN WIRE FROM THE TOUCH TONE PAD. CONNECT
THE BLUE WIRE FROM THE TOUCH TONE PAD TO THE ORANGE-AND-BLACK STRIPED WIRE
FROM THE TOUCH TONE PAD. TO THESE TWO WIRES, NOW CONNECT THE REMAINING BLACK
LEAD FROM THE FIRST BATTERY CLIP. YOU HAVE NOW FINISHED THE POWER CONNECTION
TO THE KEYPAD. CONNECT THE BLACK WIRE FROM THE KEYPAD TO THE BLUE WIRE ON THE
TRANSFORMER. NEXT CONNECT THE RED-AND-GREEN STRIPED WIRE FROM THE KEYPAD TO
THE GREEN WIRE ON THE TRANSFORMER. THE BLACK WIRE ON THE TRANSFORMER SHOULD
NOT BE CONNECTED TO ANYTHING, ALONG WITH QUITE A FEW WIRES FROM THE KEYPAD.
THE CONNECTION OF THE KEYPAD IS NOW COMPLETE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CONNECT
TWO NINE VOLT BATTERIES TO THE BATTERY CLIPS, AND YOU'LL BE READY TO GO. YOU
MAY WANT TO MOUNT IT IN A CASE FOR EASY PORTABILITY.

NOTE THAT THE SILVER BOX MODIFICATION CAN BE MADE TO THIS UNIT, ALLOWING
COMPLETE REMOTE PHREAKING. WHEN NONE OF THE BUTTONS ARE PRESSED, THIS UNIT
USES NO POWER, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR A POWER SWITCH, AND EXTENDING
THE LIFE OF THE BATTERIES.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE FREQUENCY COMBINATIONS GENERATED BY EACH BUTTON ON THE
KEYPAD.
