  WELL, WHAT YE OLDE FUCK.  HERE ARE THE SCHEMATICS.  I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
GET BUSTED JUST FOR KNOWING HOW TO MAKE COMPARATERS, SO I WILL JUST SAY NOT
TO USE THEM ON ANYBODY ELSE'S PHONE.  IF YOU DO, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
WHAT GOES DOWN.  I REALLY DON'T CARE BUT THAT'S HOW IT GOES...
 
SCHEMATICS...
  OK... NOW THAT THINGS ARE COOL, I WILL GIVE YOU THE SCHEMATICS...
  BUT FIRST...  AS EVERYONE KNOWS, TEXT-SCHEMATICS SUCK SHIT.  THAT BEITH WHY
I HAVE DEEMED IT NECESSARY FOR SOMEONE TO CREATE A STANDARD ELECTRONIC
CHARACTER SET.  MAYBE I'LL WORK ON IT BUT IF SOMEONE COMES UP WITH ONE, ALL
HAIL THE MIGHTY CHARACER SET!  MY IDEAS FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION ARE LIKE HAVING
STANDARD CHARACERS REPRESENT ELECTRONIC SYMBOLS LIKE THIS...
         'Q' = LEFT SIDE OF HORIZONTAL RESISTOR
         'E' = RIGHT SIDE OF HORIZONTAL RESISTOR
         'R' = HORIZONTILE CONNECTION         'T' = VERTICLE CONNECTION
         'Y' = HORIZONTAL CAPACITOR, NON-POLARIZED
         ETC, ETC, ETC...  ANYWAY, TIS BUT A THOUGHT.  IT COULD 
BE DONE USING HRCG WITH DOS TOOLKIT AS EVERYBODY HAS THAT, OR WHATEVER, BUT
THE THING IS TO KEEP IT STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY!  IF THIS CATCHES ON, MAYBE 
PEOPLE WILL PASS ESS DIGITAL DESIGN SPECS OVER THE MODULATOR...
  SO, HERE BIETH THE CIRCUIT...  AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID,
    "FORMATTED FOR 80 COLUMNS...  USE YOUR DAMN PRINTER!"...

DATE POSTED: 
 
  YEAH, SO THE ABOVE BULLETIN WAS THE S
CHEMATIC.  NOW FOR AN EXPLANATION.  AS
THE THEORY OF THIS THING WAS MENTIONED 
IN A PREVIOUS BULLETIN, I WON'T
CONCERN MYSELF WITH THAT.  FIRST A PART
S LIST...
RESISTORS...       47K OHM, 10K OHM, 1K
 OHM.
POTENTIOMETERS...  50K OHM TRIM POT
CAPACITORS...      0.1 UF
SEMICONDUCTORS...  PNP - 2N3906 TRANSIS
TOR, NPN - 2N3904 TRANSISTOR,
                   1N4005 DIODE.
BATTERY...         ONE 6 VOLT OR FOUR 1
.5 VOLT, A SWITCH WOULD BE NICE...
RELAY...           I'M USING A LITTLE B
LUE 4.5 VOLT (I THINK) RELAY WITH
                   DOUBLE POLE, DOUBLE 
THROW CONTACTS.  IT'S IN A DIP
                   ARRANGEMENT AND I CA
N'T REMEMBER THE RADIO SHACK NUMBER...
MISC...            VARIOUS SIZES OF JAC
KS FOR INTERFACING THE TAPE RECORDER,
                   BATTERY, TELEPHONE L
INE, ETC.
  I BUILT THIS THING FOUR TIMES ON A BR
EAD BOARD AND TWICE ON A PC BOARD
BEFORE I GOT IT TO WORK TO MY SATISFACT
ION.  I SUGGEST YOU BUILD IT
** BE ON A BREAD BOARD.  LAST MINUTE
CHANGES ALWAYS KILL ME...
  WELL, ASSEMBLE THE PARTS AS SHOWN IN 
THE SCHEMATIC BULLETIN.  A WORD ABOUT
THE CRYPTIC CODES...
 
         --\(--    IS A POLARIZED CAPAC
ITOR WITH THE NEGATIVE END POINTING
                   RIGHT...
 
         -->\--    IS THE DIODE WITH TH
E CATHODE POINTING RIGHT...
 
            \B     IS A TRANSISTOR WHIC
H IS SPECIFIED EITHER PNP OR NPN.
           -+-     ON NPN, THE ARROW ON
 THE EMITOR POINTS OUT.  ON PNP
          C/ \E    IT POINTS IN.  THE L
EADS ARE DESIGNATED, 'B' FOR BASE,
                   'E' FOR EMITOR AND '
C' FOR COLLECTOR
 
  2N3904 AND 2N3906'S ARE EASY TO COME 
BY.  RADIO SHACK SELLS BOXES OF 15 FOR
UNDER 5 BUCKS.  THEY'RE FUN TO PLAY WIT
H AS THEY ARE GOOD GENERAL PURPOSE
TRANSISTORS. I CAN'T GUARANTEE GOOD RES
ULTS IF YOU USE OTHER TRANSISTORS, BUT
IT WOULD PROBABLY WORK.
  1N4005 IS THE DIODE AND CAN BE CHANGE
D FOR ANY DIODE THAT HAS APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME RATINGS, 100 PRV MINIMUM, 1 AM
P, ETC...
  I RECOMMENT DURACEL BATTERYS FOR THE 
SOLE REASON THAT THEY LAST LONGER THAN
REGULAR CARBON BATTERYS (UP TO 35% LONG
ER!) BUT IF YOU HAVE A 115 AC OUTLET
NEARBY (YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND ONE IN 
A PEDISTAL) YOU COULD USE A 6 VOLT
POWER PACK.
 
  STAY TUNED FOR HOW TO USE IT...   [ T

                           HOW TO USE A
 (COLOR$) BOX...
                          AS UNSTUPIFYI
NGLY ITERATED BY:
                                 THE [6
04] GERBIL
                                 (SO TO
 SPEAK...)
 
  OK.  NOW THAT YOU'VE MADE THE (COLOR$
) BOX AS MENTIONED ABOVE, YOU MAY WANT
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  MANY GOOD 
PHREAKS MAY NOT WANT TO BOTHER READING
THIS MESSAGE, AS THE USES ARE QUITE OBV
IOUS.  BUT THIS IS WHAT I THINK IT
COULD BE USED FOR...
 
  WELL, SAY YOU SUSPECT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
 OF CHEATING ON YOU...  HMMM, THAT
ACTUALLY IS QUITE A FRIVILOUS USE, BUT 
IT IS A POSSIBILITY...
 
  OK.  THE SCENARIO IS AS THUS:  YOU'VE
 BEEN DIALING NUMBERS IN YOUR LOCAL
EXCHANGE AND YOU'VE FOUND A COUPLE COMP
UTERS BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ANY PASS-
WORDS...  WHAT YOU'D DO IS CALL UP CN/A
 AND GET THE LOCATION OF THE NUMBER
YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT.  THEN, YOU'D GO 
TO WHEREVER THE PLACE IS AND CHECK
OUT WHERE THE SERVICE ENTERS THE BUILDI
NG.  NOW HERE IS WHERE THE SHEEP GET
SEPARATED FROM THE GOATS OR THE PIRATES
 FROM THE PHREAKS, OR WHATEVER...
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS SOMEHOW GET AT T
HE TWO WIRES MAKING UP THE LINE.  YOU
COULD BREAK IN, OR YOU COULD STRIP THE 
WIRES ON THE POLE, OR IF THERE IS A
PPIT THERE.  ANYWAY, YOU GET SOME BARE
WIRE AND ATTACH THE BOX ACROSS THESE WI
RES.  THEN, YOU PUT YOUR TAPE IN AND
PRESS PLAY & RECORD, TURN YOUR BOX ON A
ND FORGET ABOUT FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
NOW, SEVERAL THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE
 NEXT FEW DAYS.  ONE - SOMEONE MIGHT
FIND THE BOX AND CALL THE PHONE COPS.  
TWO - THE DUDE MIGHT CALL OUT ON THE
LINE IN WHICH CASE, THE NUMBERS WILL BE
 RECORDED ON THE TAPE.  THREE - THE
GUY MIGHT GET INCOMMING CALLS WHICH WIL
L BE RECORDED.  FOUR - THE BATTERYS
MIGHT WEAR OUT.  FIVE - THE WORLD MIGHT
 BLOW UP...
  SO, YOU GET YOUR BOX BACK AND YOU SEE
 WHAT'S ON THE TAPE.  IF IT'S A
COMPUTER, THEN YOU PLAY THE TONES BACK 
INTO YOUR DEMODULATOR AND SEE WHAT
IS GOING ON.  YOU WILL GET ALL THE PASS
WORDS, ACCESS PARAMETERS AND
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON THE LINE.  SOUN
D INTERRESTING?  BUT YES, IT IS!
 
  HMMM, DID I REMEMBER TO SAY WHAT THE 
FOUR PAIRS OF WIRES COMING OUT OF MY
BOX ARE?  ANYWAY, ONE IS THE BATTERY, O
NE IS FOR THE LINE, WHICH YOU ARE
TAPING INTO, ONE GOES TO THE MICROPHONE
 OF THE TAPE RECORDER AND THE LAST
PAIR GOES TO THE TAPE RECORDER'S REMOTE
 JACK.
 
  WELL, THAT BEITH ABOUT ALL FOR YOUR L
ESSON ON HOW TO (COLOR$) BOX YOUR
WAY INTO PASSWORDS AND SUCH...  IF YOU'
VE GOT QUESTIONS, JUST POST THEM AND
THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN IS THAT I W
ON'T BOTHER ANSWERING THEM AND YOU'LL
LOOK STUPID, BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE NICE.
  FEAR NOT, I SHALL NOT FORSAKE THEE!
PLEASE EXPECT MORE WONDROUS CIRCUIT DES
IGNS IN THE FUTURE FOR OTHER FUN
TTBYIST...
