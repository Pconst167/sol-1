HELLO,
   LATELY, I HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE SUBJECT OF BOXING INTO THE SOVIET
UNION.  WHILE I AM BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT ON THIS, I HAVE PICKED UP A FEW
THINGS.

   STANDARD DIALING TO RUSSIA WOULD BEGIN SOMETING LIKE THIS:

KP+011+007+ST   (FOR INT'L SENDER)
KP+0+95+295+9051+ST   (FOR NUMBER)

   IF ALL WENT WELL, YOU WOULD BE ROUTED INTO RUSSIA AS AN OPERATOR-ASSISTED
CALL.  (BY THE WAY, THE NUMBER ABOVE IS THE KREMLIN).  HOWEVER, SINCE ALL IS
NOT WELL BETWEEN US AND THE SOVIETS, YOU WILL PROBABLY GET A RECORDING.  THIS
WILL GO SOMETHING LIKE, "INTERNATIONAL DIRECT-DIAL SERVICE IS NO LONGER
AVAILABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION..." OR "DUE TO CIRCUT CONGESTION IN THE COUNTRY
YOU DIALED, YOUR CALL DID NOT COMPLETE..." THESE RECORDINGS, HOWEVER, LIE.
THEY ARE MERELY PLACED THERE TO DETER THE BLUE BOXER.  HE HEARS THEM AND THEN,
BELIEVING THEM, GIVES UP.  SEE, THE LAST THING THAT AT&T AND THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL NEED IS A BUNCH OF 11-YEAR-OLD BLUE BOXERS CALL- ING
RUSSIA AND SAYING SOMETHING LIKE:  "HA HA, YOU FORNICATING COMMY PINKOS, WE'RE
GONNA BOMB THE HELL OUT OF YOU!" SO, THEY MAKE IT *VERY* DIFFICULT TO BOX THE
CALL.  AS I SAID BEFORE, THE RECORDINGS THAT YOU GET ARE FAKES.  WHEN NORMAL
TSPS PLACE A CALL TO RUSSIA (LEGALLY), THEY MUST CONTEND WITH THE SAME
RECORDING, ONLY INTERNATIONAL HAS THIS NEAT EQUIPMENT THAT KEEPS DIALING THE
NUMBER OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL THE CALL GOES THROUGH.  THIS NORMALLY TAKES
A FEW HOURS.  IT WOULD TAKE YOU A YEAR ON A BLUE BOX.  THIS IS WHY WHEN YOU
ATTEMPT TO PLACE A LEGAL CALL TO THE U.S.S.R., IOCC (TSPS) WILL TELL YOU THAT
THERE IS A 2-3 HOUR DELAY.  OFTEN IT IS MORE THAN THAT, IF THEY HAVE A LINE OF
CALLS.  TO HAVE IOCC PLACE A CALL, ONE WOULD BOX KP+160+700+ST FOR RUSSIA.
THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN IOCC OPERATOR WHO ASKS FOR COUNTRY, CITY AND NUMBER, AND
A BILLING NUMBER (THINKING THAT YOU ARE TSPS YOURSELF).  THEN THEY WANT A
CUSTOMER RINGBACK NUMBER (LOOP OR PAYFONE, IF YOU PLAN TO HANG AROUND FOR A FEW
HOURS OR SO).  HOWEVER, ON CALLS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY WILL CONNECT YOU
DIRECTLY AND DO NOT REQUIRE RINGBACK.  IOCC COUNTRY ROUTINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
KP+011+XXX+ST, WHERE XXX IS THE COUNTRY CODE PADDED TO THE *RIGHT* WITH ZEROS.
TO CONTINUE ABOUT IOCC ROUTINGS, THE COUNTRY CODE IS PADDED TO THE RIGHT WITH
ZEROS.  THUS, AUSTRALIA (COUNTRY CODE OF 61) WOULD BECOME 610, AND THE ROUTING
WOULD BE KP+160+610+ST.  THIS MESSAGE HASN'T SAID MUCH SINCE I HAVEN'T TOLD HOW
TO BOX A CALL TO RUSSIA, I'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH CALLING
THERE.  THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO.  UNLESS YOU ARE VERY
PATIENT AND FEEL LIKE TRYING TO BOX IT ABOUT 5000 TIMES BEFORE YOU FINALLY GET
THROUGH (IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE BUSY ANYWAY) THEN YOU NEED THE HELP OF THE
BELL SYSTEM OR POSSIBLY SOME INFERIORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE IRON CURTAIN.  TO
PLACE A CALL TO RUSSIA, OTHER THAN GOING THROUGH IOCC, ONE MIGHT TRY TO CONTACT
SOME SORT OF INWARD SOMEWHERE, LIKE YUOGSLAVIA (KARL MARX'S SUGGES- TION), OR
MAYBE EAST GERMANY.  TO BEGIN WITH, CALL RATE & ROUTE FOR THE IOTC ROUTING (SAY
YOU ARE ON CORDBOARD) FOR INWARD IN YUGOSLAVIA.  SHE'LL SAY SOME- THING LIKE
"038 PLUS BLAH-BLAH-BLAH" SO YOU WOULD BOX KP+011+038+ST, WAIT FOR INT'L TONE,
THEN DIAL KP+0+38+BLAH BLAH BLAH+121+ST.  THAT SHOULD GET YOU INWARD,
YUGOSLAVIA, WHO SPEAKS LITTLE OR NO ENGLISH AND IS AT BEST UNPLEASANT TO DEAL
WITH.  THAT'S ALL I KNOW.  IF YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY (OR ANY WAY AT ALL) TO CALL
MOTHER RUSSIA, LET ME KNOW.

	  RUSSIA CORRECTIONS!


   THERE ARE TWO MINOR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN MY THREE MESSAGE SERIES ON BLUE
BOXING INTO RUSSIA ABOVE.  THE FIRST ONE IS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE WHEN I MENTION
ROUTING INTO RUSSIA FROM THE OVERSEAS SENDER (KP+011+007+ ST).  I WROTE
"KP+0+95+295+9051+ST", BUT I LEFT OUT THE COUNTRY CODE.  SO, THE ACTUAL ROUTING
IS KP+07+95+295+9051+ST.  THIS IS NO BIG DEAL BECAUSE ANYONE WOULD FIGURE THIS
OUT.  NEXT, AT THE END OF THE SECOND MESSAGE, I GIVE THE ROUTING FOR IOCC AS
KP+011+XXX+ST.  THIS IS SENDER ROUTING, NOT IOCC ROUTING.  THE CORRECT ROUTING
FOR IOCC IS KP+160+XXX+ST (XXX=COUNTRY CODE PADDED TO RIGHT WITH ZEROS).  THIS
IS NO BIG DEAL EITHER, BECAUSE I GAVE THE CORRECT ROUTING IN MY EXAMPLE.
