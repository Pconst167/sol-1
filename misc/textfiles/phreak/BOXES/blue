                       BLUE BOXES, PART  II[37m
[37m
  WHILE READING THE FINE ARTICLE ON THE BLUE BOX I SAW THAT HERE A LOT OF DATA[37m
LEFT OUT OF THE DOCUMENT.  I HOPE THIS ADDS, IN SOME SMALL WAY, TO THE[37m
INFORMATION.[37m
[37m
  FIRST THE TONES.  WHILE ALL THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT, THE TIMING SPECS WERE[37m
NOT INCLUDED.  THE TONE PAIRS ARE TO REMAIN ON FOR 1/10 SEC.  WITH 1/10 SEC.  OF[37m
SLIENCE BETWEEN DIGITS.  THE 'KP' TONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR 2/10 SEC.  A WAY TO[37m
DEFEAT THE 2600HZ TRAPS IS TO SEND ALONG WITH THE 2600HZ SOME PINK NOISE (MOST[37m
OF THE ENERGY IN THIS SIGNAL SHOULD BE ABOVE 3000HZ, THIS SIGNAL WON'T MAKE IT[37m
OVER THE TOLL NETWORK, BUT SHOULD CARRY AS FAR AS YOUR LOCAL TOLL CENTER) SO[37m
THAT THE TRAPS WON'T FIND 'PURE' 2600HZ ON THE TRUNK.  THIS IS NOT A PERFECTLY[37m
SAFE WAY TO BOX, BUT IT SHOULD SLOW DOWN THE DISCOVERY.  AS TO USE, THE FIRST[37m
THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE ARE TWO(2) TYPES OF TOLL COMPLETING[37m
TRUNK, INWARD AND OUTWARD.  THE NAMES ARE REFERENCE TO THE OFFICE THAT IS[37m
SWITCHING THE CALL (THE TOLL CENTER THAT SERVES THE WATS LINE YOU CALLED) AND[37m
EACH TYPE OF TRUNK HAS A DIFFERENT CLASS OF SERVICE.  FROM AN INWARD TOLL[37m
COMPLETING TRUNK, YOU CAN REACH THE DIFFERENT SERVICE OPERATORS, THE TOLL TEST[37m
BOARD, AND THE INWARD OPERATOR.  SOME OFFICES ALSO ALLOW REMOTE TESTING AND IT[37m
[35;5;1m** PAUSE **[11D           [11D[0;37mIS IN THESE OFFICES THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THE OUTWARD TOLL COMPLETING TRUNKS.  THE[37m
OUTWARD TRUNKS ALLOW YOU TO MAKE VERIFICATION (EMERGENCY) CALLS, DO SERVICE[37m
MONITORING (TAPPING), STACK TRUNKS (BUSY OUT ALL TRUNKS BETWEEN LA AND NYC),[37m
ENABLE AND DISABLE TSPS POSITIONS, AND IN SOME CASES (ON SOME 4A'S) ISSUE[37m
TEMPORARY REROUTING INSTRUCTIONS (SEND ALL CALLS FROM LA TO NYC VIA MIAMI,[37m
BOSTON, OR ANY OTHERCLASS 5 OFFICE OR OFFICES).  BOTH TYPE OF TRUNK ALLOW YOU TO[37m
PLACE A 'STANDARD' CALL WITH A BOX.[37m
[37m
  IN SOME OFFICES, MOSTLY THE SMALL ONES WITH A TOLL TEST BOARD THAT IS[37m
UNATTENDED AT NIGHT AND ON WEEKENDS, YOU CAN GET AN OUTWARD TOLL COMPLETING[37m
TRUNK AS WELL AS PERFORMING OTHER TEST AND ROUTING FUNCTIONS.  YOU DO THIS BY[37m
USING THREE DIGIT CDES THAT ARE INVALID EXCHANGES (NOT OF THE PATTERN NNX [SEE[37m
NOTE 1]).  DURING THE SIXITES THE CODES USED WERE FAIRLY STANDARD AND[37m
CONSISTENT, HOWEVER WHEN THE BOXES BECAME POPULAR AND THE PHREAKS STARTED DOING[37m
THINGS LIKE ROUTING ALL CALLS FROM DALLAS TO FT.  WORTH VIA WASHINGTON D.C.[37m
MOTHER STARTED CHANGING THE TEST CODES ON A RANDOM (AS FAR AS I KNOW) BASIS.[37m
WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT EVERYBODY INTERESTED IN DOING THIS SORT OF THING[37m
PICK OUT A NICE QUIET LITTLE OFFICE SOMEWHERE AND WORK ON DISCOVERING THE CODES[37m
ACCEPTABLE TO THAT OFFICE.  EACH NUMBERING PLAN AREA (NPA, ALSO KNOWN AS AREA[37m
CODE) HAS AN OFFICE DESIIGNATED AS ITS MASTER OFFICE.  THIS OFFICE CONTROLS ALL[37m
OF THE OTHER TOLL OFFICES IN THE AREA AS WELL AS SERVING AS A CONCENTRATION[37m
POINT FOR MOST OUT OF AREA CALLS.  TO ACCESS THE SERVICES OF A NON-MASTER OFFICE[37m
YOU NEED IT'S 'CITY CODE', THIS IS A THREE(3) DIGIT CODE THAT IS OF THE FORM[37m
0XX, AND IS SENT AFTER THE AREA CODE [SEE NOTE 2].  AS AN EXAMPLE, THE 'CITY[37m
[35;5;1m** PAUSE **[11D           [11D[0;37mCODE' FOR CANTON, OHIO IS 042; THUS TO REACH THE INWARD OPERATOR IN CANTON, YOU[37m
WOULD SEND 'KP-216-042-121-ST' WHERE AS IF YOU WANTED THE INWARD OPERATOR IN[37m
CLEVELAND, YOU WOULD SEND 'KP-216-121-ST'.  THE REASON THIS IS NECESSARY IS THAT[37m
THE OPERATOR IN CLEVELAND CAN'T VERIFY A NUMBER IN CANTON, SO IF YOU WANT TO[37m
VERIFY SOMEONE IN CANTON YOU NEED THE CITY CODE.  ALSO, MOST AREA MASTER OFFICES[37m
HAVE DEDICATED DATA TRUNKS TO THE NETWORK CONTROL CENTER AND THUS DON'T ACCEPT[37m
TEST AND REROUTING COMMANDS OVER THE SWITCHED NET-WORK.  IN CONCLUSION, THE[37m
SWITCHING NETWORK WILL DO A LOT MORE FOR YOU THEN CONNECT YOU TO PEOPLE AND THE[37m
SMALL OFFICES THAT REQUIRE A 'CITY CODE' ARE THE TYPE OF OFFICE TO TRY TO BREAK.[37m

  NOTE 1:  THE NORMAL FORMAT FOR TELEPHONE NUMBERS IS AS FOLLOWS:  NYN/NNX-XXXX.[37m
WHERE N=ANY DIGIT EXCEPT 1 AND 0; Y=0 OR 1, AND X=ANY DIGIT.  YES I KNOW THAT IN[37m
SOME AREA CODES THE NNX FORMAT HAS CHANGED TO NXX.  THIS IS A NEW OCCURRENCE AND[37m
ONLY OCCUR WHERE THERE HAS BE AN OUTRAGEOUS POPULATION INCREASE IN THE LAST FEW[37m
YEARS AND ALL OF THE FUNNY EXCHANGES ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO MASTER OFFICES[37m

[37m
  NOTE 2:  YOU CAN OBTAIN THE 'CITY CODE' FOR A NUMBER BY CALLING RATE AND ROUTE[37m

  WE ALL KNOW THAT THE TOUCH TONES FREQUENCIES ARE COMPOSED OF TWO TONES (TWO[37m
DIFFERENT FREQS.) SO THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE 2 VCO'S ( VOLTAGE CONTROLLED[37m
OSCILATORS).  WE WILL CALL THESE VCO#1 AND VCO#2.  IF YOU HAVE NOTICED VCO#1 ANS[37m
VCO#2 ARE EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF CIRCUITS.  THAT IS WHY ONLY ONE WAS DRAWN.[37m
BUT REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER GOES FOR VCO#1 ALSO GOES FOR VCO#2.        BOTH VCO'S[37m
ARE[37m
COMPOSED OF A HANDFULL OF PARTS.  ONE CHIP TWO CAPACITORS 2 RESISTORS AND FIVE[37m
