           WHITE BOX PLANS
  (UPLOADED BY AGRAJAG THE PROLONGED)

THIS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU HOW TO CHANG
E A NORMAL TOUCH TONE
KEYPAD AND CONVERT IT TO A PORTABLE UNI
T. IN ADDITION, WE
GIVE THE TOUCH-TONE FREQUENCIES.

FIRST OF ALL, THE TONES MADE BY A TOUCH
 TONE TELEPHONE ARE NOT
SINGLE TONES, THEY ARE A COMBINATION OF
 TWO TONES, MAKING "DTMF"
(DUAL TONE MULTI-FREQUENCY). THE NORMAL
 TONE TELEPHONE DIALS 12
DIFFERENT SIGNALS, BUT IS CAPABLE OF DI
ALING 16 DIFFERENT SIGNALS
(SEE BULLETIN ON SILVER BOXES).

THE POWER REQUIRED BY A KEYPAD IS ABOUT
 25 VOLTS, BUT THEY WILL
WORK WITH AS LITTLE AS 15, THEREBY ALLO
WING THE USE OF TWO 9-
VOLT RADIO BATTERIES.  AS YOU MAY HAVE 
GUESSED, THEY ARE ALSO
DESIGNED TO OPERATE WITH A TELEPHONE TY
PE SPEAKER (AND PHONE
LINE), AND NOT THE STANDARD 8-OHM SPEAK
ER WHICH NEEDS TO BE USED
FOR ADEQUATE VOLUME.  TO ACCOMPOLISH TH
IS, WE USE A MATCHING
TRANSFORMER, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MINIA
TURE ONES AVAILABLE AT
RADIO SHACK.  ENOUGH OF THE THEORY, NOW
 FOR THE CIRCUIT.

YOU WILL NEED:

A TOUCH TONE KEYPAD
A MINIATURE 1000 TO 8 OHM TRANSFORMER (
RADIO SHACK # 273-1380)
A STANDARD 8-OHM SPEAKER
TWO 9-VOLT RADIO BATTERIES
TWO 9-VOLT BATTERY CLIPS
A CASE TO PUT IT ALL IN (OPTIONAL)

A FEW CONSTRUCTION NOTES, I SUGGEST THA
T YOU SOLDER AND TAPE ALL
CONNECTIONS.  IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO R
EAD THIS ENTIRE BULLETIN
BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUCT THIS.

FIRST, CONNECT THE RED WIRE OF THE TRAN
SFORMER TO EITHER
TERMINAL ON THE SPEAKER.  NOW CONNECT T
HE WHITE WIRE FROM THE
TRANSFORMER TO THE OTHER TERMINAL ON TH
E SPEAKER.  NEXT, CONNECT
THE RED (POSITIVE) WIRE OF ONE BATTERY 
CLIP TO THE BLACK WIRE OF
THE OTHER BATTERY CLIP.  NOW CONNECT TH
E THE REMAINING RED WIRE
ON THE SECOND BATTERY CLIP TO THE GREEN
 WIRE FROM THE TOUCH TONE
PAD.  CONNECT THE BLUE WIRE FROM THE TO
UCH TONE PAD TO THE
ORANGE-AND-BLACK STRIPED WIRE FROM THE 
TOUCH TONE PAD.  TO THESE
TWO WIRES, NOW CONNECT THE REMAINING BL
ACK LEAD FROM FIRST
BATTERY CLIP.  YOU HAVE NOW FINISHED TH
E POWER CONNECTION TO THE
KEYPAD.  CONNECT THE BLACK WIRE FROM TH
E KEYPAD TO THE BLUE WIRE
ON THE TRANSFORMER.  NEXT CONNECT THE R
ED-AND-GREEN STRIPED WIRE
FROM THE KEYPAD TO THE GREEN WIRE ON TH
E TRANSFORMER.  THE BLACK
WIRE ON THE TRANSFORMER SHOULD NOT BE C
ONNECTED TO ANYTHING,
ALONG WITH QUITE A FEW WIRES FROM THE K
EYPAD.  THE CONNECTION OF
THE KEYPAD IS NOW COMPLETE.  ALL YOU HA
VE TO DO IS CONNECT TWO
NINE VOLT BATTERIES TO THE BATTERY CLIP
S, AND YOU'LL BE READY TO
GO. YOU MAY WANT TO MOUNT IT IN A CASE 
FOR EASY PORTABILITY.
NOTE THAT THE SILVER BOX MODIFICATION C
AN BE MADE TO THIS UNIT,
ALLOWING COMPLETE REMOTE PHREAKING.  WH
EN NONE OF THE BUTTONS
ARE PRESSED, THIS UNIT USES NO POWER, T
HEREBY ELIMINATING THE
NEED FOR A POWER SWITCH, AND EXTENDING 
THE LIFE OF THE
BATTERIES.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE FREQUENCY COMBINA
TIONS GENERATED BY EACH
BUTTON ON THE KEYPAD.

KEY     FREQ. #1        FREQ. #2

 SILVER BOXES: HISTORY, CONSTRUCTION
 -----------------------------------

WELL, NOW THAT I HAVE YOU HERE, I MAY A
S
 WELL
BORE YOU WITH A LITTLE HISTORY OF SILVE
R
 BOXES.
ONE DAY, SOME ENGINEER OVER AT BELL LAB
S
 GOT
THE BRIGHT IDEA TO SING TO HIS COMPUTER
.
..
AND FOUND THAT THE COMPUTER RESPONDED B
Y
 DIALING
A PHONE NUMBER.  WELL, SORT OF.  ANYWAY
,
 THE
10 DIGIT (OLD STYLE, WITH THE # AND * B
L
OCKED
OUT) TOUCH TONE PAD WAS BORN.  LO AND B
E
HOLD,
THOUGH, 2 SETS OF PEOPLE DECIDED THAT 1
0
 (NOW 12)
BUTTONS JUST WASN'T ENOUGH...THEY NEEDE
D
MORE.  THE TWO PEOPLE OF WHOM I AM SPEA
K
ING ARE
OF COURSE MA BELL AND PA AUTOVON (THE M
I
LITARY
PHONE NETWORK).  SO, MA DECIDED TO ADD 
A
N EXTRA
COLUMN TO HER PHONES, THIS ONE MERGING 
T
HE
STANDARD ROW TONES WITH A 1633 HZ TONE 
(
TO 
PROVIDE THE MYSTICAL DTMF).  BELL NAMED
 
THESE
BUTTONS A,B,C, AND D (AREN'T YOU GLAD W
E
 HAVE
SUCH IMAGINATIVE PEOPLE AT THE BELL SYS
T
EM?),
WHILE THE ARMY NAMED THEM FLASH, FLASH 
O
VERRIDE, 
PRIORITY, AND PRIORITY INTERRUPT (OR IS
 
IT
FLASH INTERRUPT AND PRIORITY OVERRIDE..
.
)
ANYWAY...THESE ARE USED AS VARYING DEGR
E
ES OF
PRIORITY DURING WARTIME (AND WARGAME) A
C
TIVITIES
SO GENERALS CAN CALL THEIR SECRETARIES 
V
ERY
QUICKLY.  BELL'S USE OF ABC AND D IS NO
T
 SO CLEAR.
HOWEVER, THE LAST BUTTON (D) HAS AN INT
E
RESTING
PROPERTY...ON ABOUT 50% OF THE INFORMAT
I
ON
LINES IN THE COUNTRY, IT WILL GIVE YOU 
A
 PULSING
DIAL TONE.  YOU CAN THEN ENTER COMMANDS
 
TO
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A TEST SYSTEM FOR 4A
 
BOXES.
ANYWAY...THE MODIFICATION...
WARNING...TURN ON YOUR PRINTER NOW, AND
 
READ
THESE INSTRUCTIONS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE
 
YOU
ACTUALLY TRY THEM.  MAKE SURE YOU KNOW 
H
OW
TO SOLDER...THIS COULD PERMENANTLY DAMA
G
E YOUR PHONE!!!
STEP ONE: UNSCREW THE TWO LARGE SCREWS 
O
N THE BASE OF YOUR PHONE.
TAKE THE COVER OFF AND PLACE IT AND THE
 
SCREWS
IN A SAFE PLACE.  NOW, LOOSEN (BUT DON'
T
 REMOVE)
THE SCREWS ON THE SIDES OF THE TOUCH TO
N
E KEY PAD.
(THESE ARE ON THE SIDES, AND ATTACH IT 
T
O
ITS MOUNTING BRACKETS). NOW CAREFULLY R
E
MOVE
THE PAD FROM ITS BRACKETS (DON'T RIP AN
Y
 WIRES!)
YOU WILL NOTICE A PLASTIC COVER ON THE 
P
AD. 
SEPARATE THE TWO HALVES, AND GET THEM O
U
T OF YOUR
WAY (DON'T DESTROY THEM, THEY'LL BE NEE
D
ED...JUST
MOVE THEM DOWN THE WIRE HARNESS THAT GO
E
S THROUGH
THEM.  NOW LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE PAD (
S
O THE 123 ROW IS FACING AWAY, AND THE 
*0# ROW TOWARD YOU.  TURN OVER THE PAD.
YOU SHOULD SEE A MASS OF WIRES, GOLD PL
A
TED
CONTACTS (YES, IT'S REAL GOLD), DISCRET
E
 
COMPONENTS, AND TWO LARGE DOUGNUT SHAPE
D
 BLACK
THINGS.  THESE ARE COILS THAT GENERATE 
T
HE FREQUENCIES.
MA BELL WAS ALWAYS ONE FOR STANDARDS, S
O
 ALL
THE COILS SHE MANUFACTURES ARE CAPABLE 
O
F GENERATING
ALL 4 PRIMARY TONES (SHE ONLY GIVES YOU
 
CONNECTIONS TO THREE OF THEM, THOUGH). 
 
YOU ARE ABOUT TO 
MAKE YOUR OWN CONNECTION TO THE FOURTH,
 
AND MAKE
THE THIRD COLUMN OF KEYS "BANK SWITCHED
"
 BETWEEN 
NORMAL AND FOURTH ROW.  CUT THREE LENGT
H
S OF WIRE
OF DIFFERENT COLORS ABOUT 2 FEET 
LONG (BETTER OVERKILL THAN UNDERKILL...
)
I USED BLUE, GRAY AND BROWN, BUT THESE
COLORS ARE ARBITRARY...BUT I WILL BE RE
F
ERRING TO 
THESE COLORS IN THE BULLETIN.
  LOOK AT THE COIL ON THE LEFT (WITH TH
E
 
5 SOLDER CONTACTS FACING YOU, RATHER TH
A
N BEING PERPENDICULAR TO YOU.
COUNT OVER 4 CONTACTS FROM THE LEFT (OR
 
2 FROM THE RIGHT)
AND SOLDER A WIRE TO THE 4TH POST FROM 
T
HE LEFT.  THIS IS THE
1633 HZ OUTPUT.  SOLDER THE OTHER END O
F
 THIS WIRE TO 
THE LEFT POLE OF THE SMALLEST SPDT SWIT
C
H YOU CAN FIND
THIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN NOW...TA
K
E A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM
EDGE OF THE KEYPAD.  YOU SHOULD
SEE A ROW OF THREE GOLD PLATED CONTACTS
 
(TO THE RIGHT OF 
2 VERY LARGE CAPACITORS).  LOOK AT THE 
O
NE ON THE LEFT.  THIS ONE CONTROLS THE 
RI
GHTMOST BANK OF KEYS
ON THE PHONE.  GENTLY SEPARATE THE
TWO TOUCHING CONNECTORS (THEY ARE SOLDE
R
ED TOGETHER WITH
A DROP OF SOLDER) AND SPREAD THEM APART
.
SOLDER THE BROWN WIRE TO THE TOP CONTAC
T
 (THE ONE
FUTHEST FROM YOU), AND SOLDER IT TO THE
 
RIGHT POLE OF THE SPDT.
NOW, TAKE THE BLUE WIRE AND SOLDER IT T
O
 THE BOTTOM (CLOSEST)
CONTACT.  SOLDER THE OTHER END OF
THIS WIRE TO THE CENTER POLE OF THE SPD
T
.
  YOU HAVE NOW COMPLETED YOUR MODIFICAT
I
ONS.  WHEN THE SWITCH IS
IN ONE POSITION, YOU WILL GET NORMAL TO
N
ES, IN THE OTHER YOU'LL GET 1633 TONES.
  SOME FINESS CAN BE ADDED BY PASSING T
H
E THREE WIRES THROUGH
THE PLASTIC COVER, AND IN THROUGH THE G
A
P IN THE
CASE OF YOUR PHONE UNDER VHE PLACE WHER
E
 YOU HANG IT UP.
THEN SOLDER THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH IN 
T
HE PROPER PLACES, 
AND YOU CAN GLUE THE SWITCH TO THE WALL
 
ON THE 
INSIFE OF THAT SMALL ALCOVE IN THE PHON
E
 AFTER TAKING THE SLACK 
WIRE BACK INTO THE PHONE.
(THIS JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU READ THE WH
O
LE THING BEFORE TRYING IT...)
   NOW, CALL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE USING
 
NORMAL TONES (OUT OF STATE, THAT IS)
XXX-555-1212,  NOW SWITCH QUICKLY TO 16
3
3, AND PRESS
DOWN ON THE # KEY (NOW THE D KEY).  IF 
Y
OU ARE
ON AN OLD SWITCHBOX (4A), YOU WILL GET 
A
 PULSING
DIAL TONE.  YOU CAN THEN SWITCH BACK TO
 
NORMAL, AND TRY DIALING DIFFERENT 
NUMBERS.  TWO OF THE MOST INTERESTING A
R
E 6 AND 7.  THESE
OFTEN FORM A LOOP-AROUND TYPE 
CONNECTION, AND TWO PEOPLE CAN CALL IN,
 
ONE USING 6
AND THE OTHER 7, AND TALK IN THIS MANNE
R
.  IF ENOUGH
PEOPLE PERFORM THIS MOD, I WILL KEEP "O
F
FICE HOURS" ON 
ONE OF THESE...
   HAPPY PHREAKING...
      CAIN
NOTE: YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE A PULSING TO
N
E UNTIL THE OPERATOR
ACTUALLY PICKS UP ON THE LINE.  IF YOU 
H
EAR RINGING, KEEP PRESSING.  
THE TONE MUST BE ON AT THE SAME TIME TH
E
 OPERATOR GIVES HER "BEEP".
IF YOU HEAR HER CURSING AT STUPID PEOPL
E
 WITH STUCK BUTTONS, 
CHANCES ARE THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK...TRY
 
OUT
OF THE WAY STATES LIKE MONTANA, WYOMING
,
 ETC.
