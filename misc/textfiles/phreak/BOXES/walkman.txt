1.1  Trial and error.................


      1.Materials

        1.)Portable Cassette Recorder (Walk-man type perferred)
        2.)Blank Chrome/metal cassette tape
        3.)QUARTER.VOC {INCLUDED}
        4.)Sound Blaster or compatable.
        5.)Hi-Fi speakers {Computer speakers for SB}
        6.).VOC Player
        7.)A Human with a I.Q of a Rock or higher

      2.Procedure
        
        1.)First load up .VOC in either DOS or WIN
             :We used Wave Studio for WIN.
        2.)load up the Cassette Recorder with the Chrome Cassette tape
             :MAKE SURE THERE ARE BATTERIES IN THE DEVICE.
        3.)Cue up tape to beginning.
        4.)Hold Microphone input close to Speaker.
             :IF YOU CANNOT DO THIS THEN GO BACK TO PLAYING W/ BLUE BOXES
        5.)Hit Record and play .VOC for a couple of times. make sure that  
           there is about a 1 0r 2 second space between tones
        6.)Check to make sure that the tone is audible
        7.)Go out and have fun

      3.Problems
        
        When using our recording, we found out that on some calls you may 
        need to deposit a nickel. Also for phone calls that require you to
        deposit a quarter before dialing it does not work. I think that it is
        the dial tone distorting the tones. We will update after more testing
