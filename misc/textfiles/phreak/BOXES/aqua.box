 Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreaded F.B.I. 'Lock in Trace.' For 
a long time, it was impossible to escape from the lock in trace. This box does 
offer and escape route with simple directions to it. This box is quite a 
simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic electronics knowledge can 
construct and use it.

 A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone users 
location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress. For those of 
you who are not familiar with the concept of 'locking in', then here's a brief 
description. 

 The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation, sort of like a three-way call 
connection. Then, when they get there, they can plug electricity into the 
phone line. All phone connections are held open by a certain voltage of 
electricity, that is why you sometimes get static and faint connections when 
you are calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping the line 
up. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate that same 
voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang up, voltage 
is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was calling you even after 
you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should understand better about 
that, for call waiting intercepts the electricity and makes a tone that means 
someone is going through your line. Then, it is a matter of which voltage is 
higher. When you push down the receiver, then it see-saws the electricity to 
the other side. When you have a person on each line it is impossible to hang 
up unless one or both of them will hang up. If you try to hang up, voltage is 
retained, and your phone will ring. That should give you an understanding of 
how calling works, also. When electricity passes through a certain point on 
your phone, the electricity causes a bell to ring or on some newer phones an 
electronic ring to sound.) 

 So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the voltage level 
on your phone line. You should know that every time someone else picks up the 
phone line, then the voltage does decrease a little. In the first steps of 
planning this out, Xerox suggested getting about a hundred phones all hooked 
into the same line that could all be taken off the hook at the same time. 
That would greatly decrease the voltage level. That is also why most three- 
way connections that are using the bell service three way calling (which is 
only $3 a month) become quite faint after a while. 

 By now, you should understand the basic idea. You have to drain all of the 
power out of the line so the voltage can not be kept up. I suddenly thought 
draining of power could quickly short out the F.B.I. voltage machine, because 
it was only built to sustain the exact voltage necessary to keep the voltage 
out. 

 For now, imagine this. One of the normal Radio Shack generators that you can 
go pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box has a phone 
jack on it and the other has an electrical plug. This way, you can "flash" 
voltage THROUGH the line, but cannot drain it. So, some modifications have 
to be done.

 Materials needed- a BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp 
                   type connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire 
                   that would plug into a light bulb. 

                 - One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then 
                   construct your own... same voltage connection, but the 
                   restrainer must be built in (i.e. the central box) 

                 - TWO phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are 
                   being traced to plug the aqua box into) 

                 - Some creativity and easy work. 
 
 NOTICE: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so don't go 
         out and buy a new phone for it! 
 
 All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it could 
drain into anything, a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having that is 
you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into the electrical 
applicence so there would be no voltage left to lock you in with. 

 1)Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have only 
two prongs, if it has three, still, do not fear. MAKE SURE THE ELECTRICAL 
APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF unless you wanna become a crispy critter while making 
this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic design on the top of them to 
prevent you from getting in at the electrical wires inside. Well, get a nice 
one and remove it. If you want to keep the plug (I don't see why...) then just 
cut the top off. 

 When you look inside, low and behold, you will see that at the base of the 
prongs there are a few wires connecting in. Those wires conduct the power into 
the appliance. So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides and pull them out 
until they are about and inch ahead of the prongs. If you don't wanna keep 
the jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you are, cover the prongs with 
insultation tape so they will not connect with the wires when the power is 
being dvained from the line. 

 2)Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the wires 
evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each other. If you 
happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the phone, stop 
reading now, your too fucking stupid to continue. 

 After you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole thing 
with the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own control box 
or if you bought one, then cram all the wires into the box and reclose it. That 
box is your ticket out of this. 

 3)Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty flimsy 
connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at it then you 
can sauder away at it and form the whole device into one big box, with some 
kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be the power connector. 

 

 In order to use it, just keep this box handy. Plug it into the jack if you 
want, but it will slightly lower the voltage so it isn't connected. When you 
plug it in, if you see sparks, unplug it and restart the WHOLE thing. But if 
it just seems fine then leave it.

 Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS 
THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! When the trace has gone on, don't panic, unplug 
your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked to. It will need 
energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source... the voltage to keep 
a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light bulb should drain it all 
in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at the same time. 
 
 Happy boxing and stay free!
