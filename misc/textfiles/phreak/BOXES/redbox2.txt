Introduction
---------------
   Radio Shack's DTMF Dialer (cat # 43-141) can be easily modified
to produce the same frequencies that Pay Phones use for
quarter/nickel/dime signaling back to Ma Bell. This is done by
switching the crystal in the unit from 3.579Mhz To 6.5535 MHz. This
information is completely covered in another file (See 2600
Magazine for details) and will not be covered here.
   What I will attempt to cover in this article is 1) A simple way of
modifiying the dialer to switch between DTMF and Red Box Tones,
and 2) A low-cost idea for building the red box from scratch.
Parts Needed
----------------
   Ohm Meter
   Solder
   Soldering Iron
   Epoxy or Duco Cement
   XT1     6.5535 Mhz Crystal <You should know this by now!>
   M1,M2   2 Sub-Micro-Mini Mercury switches
             Don't get the ones that radio shack sells. They're WAY
             too big. They'll never fit inside the case.
   Our goal here is to fit _everything_ inside the case. This box
will function exactly like Count Zero's "Combo Box" <I perfer to
call it a Pink Box, seeing as it combines both the features of
White and Red boxing>

Step-By-Step Construction Details
------------------------------------
 ** REMOVE ALL BATTERIES BEFORE CONTINUING! **
 1> Disassemble the dialer. Remove the 4 screws holding the case
    together, and save them. Some prying is necessary to split the
    case open, and should be done with the utmost caution. You
    _MAY_ desolder the two yellow wires holding the speaker to the
    circuit board if you want more room to work in, so long as you
    remember where you removed them from. Placement of these two
    wires is not crucial. You don't have to remember which wire goes
    to what pad, just where you removed them from. (Which will
    probably be near the top of the unit)
 2> Carefully remove the original crystal from the circuit board.
    This will be a small silver cylindrical object, roughly 4 cm long and
    .25 cm wide, Soldered horizontally above the battery case, on the
    circuit board. Save it!
 3> Using an OhmMeter, find out the orientation of the two mecury
    switches. Hold the leads to each side of the switch, turning
    the switch upside down and right side up until you get a
    reading of ZERO on the ohmmeter. This means that you've got a
    connection through the switch. Mark an arrow or something on
    the switch so that you can remember the orientation.
 4) Using Expoy or Duco Cement, Attach the mercury switches, to the
    circuit board , so that one's orientation is UP, and the other,
    DOWN. When I speak of UP And DOWN, I'm talking about UP and DOWN
    in relation to the entire unit. UP means pointing towards the
    top, where the three buttons are. Down means pointing towards the
    battery case.
    This is exteremly important. If you make a mistake, and
    have them both in the same direction , the switching action of
    the mercury switches will be meaningless.
 5) Solder one wire to each leg of the switches. Solder the
    other end of these two wires to the bottom pad that you removed
    the original crystal from.
 6) Solder a wire from the top pad to a leg on the 3.5535MHz Crystal.
 7) Solder a wire from the top pad to a leg on the 6.5535MHz Crystal.
 8) Solder the remaining leg on the 3.5535 MHz Crystal to the
    remaining leg on one of the mercury switches.
 9) Solder the remaining leg on the 6.5535 MHz Crystal to the
    remaining leg on the other mercury switch.
 **   ALWAYS REFER TO THE ABOVE SCHEMATIC IF YOU GET CONFUSED!  **
      TAKE CARE WHEN SOLDERING! THE CIRCUIT BOARD IS WIMPY,
      AND COPPER PADS WILL JUST MELT OFF THE BOARD IF GIVEN EXTREME
      HEAT!
 Reassembly
 -----------
 10) If necessary, remove the Piezo Speaker (the smaller one) to
     make room for the new parts. This speaker is only used during
     the programming of the dialer, and you can probably live
     without it. Clever people can move this to a different location
     within the dialer.
 11) Cement the two crystals inside the dialer. Make sure of a few
     things: The bodies of the crystals are metal. If you want to
     place them in an area with lots of surrounding chips and parts,
     place cement down first, then the crystal to prevent shorting.
     The expoy can act as a wonderful insulator, and give you much
     more freedom as far as parts placement goes.
 12) Place the back on the dialer, push it together, and insert the 4
     screws again. Tighten.
 Testing/Troubleshooting
 ---------------------------
 Turn the dialer on. Insert batteries. Toggle the STORE/DIAL switch
 to STORE. Store 1 * in P1, 2 *'s in P2, and 5 *'s to P3.
 Return the switch to DIAL.
 Press P3. If you hear quarter tones, then you're halfway there.
 Turn the unit upside down. Press P3 again. If you're hearing DTMF
 tones, You're set.
 Depending on how you wired the mercury switches, You may have to
 flip the unit around to hear the different tones. I've got the
 Red Box tones active when I turn my unit upside down, which I
 think is perferred. (It tends to be a bit more discret)...
                             ************
                               Part Two
                             ************
 So, now that you've got a decently looking/functioning Pink Box,
 go off and try it. Bone AT&T a few times.
 If you're intrested in building a Red Box from scratch, I'll offer
 a simple block diagram, and some ideas. I'm not in the mood to
 type out a complete schematic for it, but If I recieve enough
 requests, then I'll provide complete details.
 Insane techincal discussion follows. Ask me questions if you can't
 understand me. Don't sit there being confused.
                                  ****
 A red box can be created with 4-5 chips. You'd need 2 XR2207 VCO's
 (Voltage Controlled Oscillator), an LM386 Audio Amplifier, a 556
 Timer to do your timings for you, and a 74191 counter chip.
 In theory: The duty cycle of the 556 would control the Make/Break
 ratio of the tones, acting as a clock. You'd have to adjust this
 ratio with either a scope or freq counter, taking a bit of time,
 but it'd be worth it. A scope would be preferable, because you
 could SEE the timings and adjust accordingly.
 The 74191 would be given the output of the 556. Some arrangement of
 gates would tell the 74191 when to stop, and you'd switch these
 gates, on and off with three switches. It may even be easier to
 have three switches controlling the 74191's SET inputs in binary.
 (You'd have to hold swithes 3 and 1 to get 5 quarter 'clicks'. Not
 too elegant, but functional.)
 You'd have to set the two VCO's to the approiate frequency using
 potentionmeters. Simple if you've got a freq counter. Also, you'd
 have to set the VCO's to function with a sine wave.
 This is only a thought. I wouldn't want to go through the trouble of
 building this, seeing for $30 you can toss one together via radio
 shack...
