      ----------------------

THE RED BOX BASICALLY SIMULATES THE SOUND OF COINS BEING DROPPED INTO THE
COIN SLOT OF A PAY TELEPHONE. A PAY TELEPHONE GENERATES A BURST OF TWO
MIXED FREQUENC IES, 1700 HZ AND 2200 HZ, FOR A SPECIFIC TIME INTERVAL TO
DENOTE A NICKLR, DIME, OR QUARTER. A NICKLE IS 1700 HZ +2200 HZ FOR 66
MILLISECONDS. A DIME IS 1700 HZ + 2200 HZ FOR 66 MILLI. SECS. ON, 66 MS.
OFF , THEN 66 MS ON AGAIN. FINALLY, A QUARTER IS 1700 HZ+2200 HZ FOR 33,MS
ON, 33 MS, OFF, CONTINUOSLY REPEATING FOR 5 TIMES.

WHEN USING A RED BOX ON A PAY PHONE, FIRST DEPOSIT A REAL NICKLE (BECAUSE
T HEY CAN TELL IF THE FIRST ONE IS A REAL ONE OR JUST A TONE), THEN USE
THE TONE B URST. YOU CAN BUILD THE CIRCUIT TO GENERATE A NICKLE TONE, THEN
RECORD IT AND PL AY IT INTO THE PAY PHONE WITH A WALKMAN CASETTE PLAYER.
