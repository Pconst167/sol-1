%HOW TO BUILD A BLOTTO BOX+
%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%+%

Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the innocent
phreakers around America has finally been conceived by the one phreak who is
the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you! Well, for
you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box,here is a brief
summery of a legend.

--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

   For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Master,it is
possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
finally available to the public.

   NOTE: The Traveler can not be responsible for the information disclosed in
the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecution!
Again, The Traveler TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY!

   All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
it's function.

   The Blotto Box is every phreak dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone \fe
allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
matter. As long as the switching system stays the same, this box will not
stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/generator is
stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electrocuted if
they pick up the phone.

    But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
after effect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
Blotto Box will continue as long as there is electricity to continue with.
OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
do with it...

--*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--

   Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
construct this box.

   Materials:
- A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
stadium or some such place.
- A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
plug into a phone line jack.
- A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
- A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3'by 4' that
\dod. They are the main switch
boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
code!
- A soldering iron and much solder.
- A remote control or long wooden pole.

Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
other listed equipment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convenient, if you are
two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
wires.

   NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
correct order, you will be a crispy critter. Keep the generator off until you
plan to start it up. Now, solder those lines together carefully. Wrap duct
tape or insulation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
the pole over.

   NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading\disabout to
become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating so much
electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
you in every direction.
   Have a nice day!


--*-=> The Blotto Box: Aftermath <=-*--

Well, that is the plans for the most devastating and ultimately deadly
box ever created. My hat goes off to: King Blotto (for the original idea),
Captain Xerox (for the suggestion about stadiums), and Moderns}}x (for
the fact I was on his BBS when I thought of it.
