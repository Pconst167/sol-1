Schematic for The Lunch Box

This may get a tad confusing but just print it out and pay attention.

Notes about the schematic
=========================

1.  GND means ground
2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
3.  Where you see:  )(
                    ()
                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                       regular hook-up wire around it.
4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run
    a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
    capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast
    approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
    broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an
    antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
    line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

Operation of the Lunch Box
==========================

This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to
adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch on
the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted,
turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a friend
lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The
plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

(1) 1N38B diode
(1) Transistor antenna coil
(1) 2N366 transistor
(1) SPST toggle switch
