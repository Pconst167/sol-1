<B><I>A Word about the Rampant Duplication in this Section:</B></I>
<P>
There's a lot of similar files in this section: The reason being that
Box Plans were a de-facto requirement for you to have even a semi-decent
Phreaking/Hacking BBS in the 1980's. You started your BBS, you went out
and grabbed Boxing textfiles from AE Lines or long-distance BBSes, and you
put them all up, under a special phreaking files section. With this amount
of intensity came people who would modify the files to look like they wrote
them, or reformatted the files and took credit for the reformatting. There's
many, many different variations and I believe the variations represent a bit
of history in themselves.
