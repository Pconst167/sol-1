A Cheesebox (named for the type of box the first one was found in) is a
type of box which will, in effect, make your telephone a Pay-Phone. This
is a simple, modernized, and easy way of doing it.

      Inside Info: These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way
of making calls to people without being called by the cops or having their
numbers traced and/or tapped.

                    How To Make A Modern Cheese Box


You will need:

     1 Call Forwarding service on the line

     1 Set of Red Box Tones

     The number to your prefix's Intercept operator(do some scanning for
     this one)

     How To:
     -------

       After you find the number to the intercept operator in your prefix,
use your call-forwarding and forward all calls to her.  This will make your
phone stay off the hook (actually it now waits for a quarter to be dropped
in).  You now have a cheese box.

In Order To Call Out On This Line: You must use your Red Box tones and gener-
ate the quarter dropping in.  Then you can make phone calls to people.  As far
as I know, this is fairly safe, and they do not check much.
