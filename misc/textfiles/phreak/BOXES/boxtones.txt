In this short section I will attempt to list some tones that Ma Bell uses and 
what they are. Well, here it goes (I hope!) 
 
Blue Box Frequencies: 
 
2600 HZ - Used to get on/off trunk 
 
 
Tone Matrix to use after 2600 HZ. 
 
 700:  1  :  2  :  4  :  7  :  11  : 
 
 900:  +  :  3  :  5  :  8  :  12  : 
 
1100:  +  :  +  :  6  :  9  :  KP  : 
 
1300:  +  :  +  :  +  :  10 :  KP2 : 
 
1500:  +  :  +  :  +  :  +  :  ST  : 
 
 
     900  :1100 :1300 :1500 : 1700 : 
 
 
Use KP (1700+1100) to start a call and ST (1500+1700) to stop. 
Use 2600 HZ to disconnect. 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
Red Box Freqs: 
 
1700 HZ and 2200 HZ mixed together. 
 
A nickel is 66 MS on (1 BEEP). A dime is 66MS on, 66MS off, 66MS on (2 BEEPS) 
A quarter is 33MS on, 33MS off repeated 5 times. 
 
(MS = MILLISECOND). 
 
For those of you who don't know, a red box simulates money being put into a 
pay phone. You must put in some money first though (the operator can tell if
money was put in but as to how much, she lets the computer answer that. (Yeah
for the computer!))

TASI locking Freq: 
 
TASI (Time Assignment Speech Interpolation) is used on satelite trunks, and 
basically allows more than one person to use a trunk by putting them on while 
the other person isn't talking. Of course, you'd never hear the other person 
talking on your trunk. 
 
When you start to talk, however, the TASI controller has to find an open trunk 
for you. Because of this, some of your speech is lost (because of the delay in 
finding a trunk) this is called Clipping. 
 
Well, if you were transmitting data over a trunk, clipping would really fuck 
up the data. So there is something called a TASI Locking Frequency which keeps 
the TASI from putting anyone else on your trunk or you on anyone elses trunk.
In  any case the Freq. is 1850HZ. Send before the transmission.
