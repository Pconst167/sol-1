       A Cheesebox (named for the type of box the first one was found in) is
a type of box which will, in effect, make your telephone a Pay-Phone.
This is a simple,modernized, and easy way of doing it....
  
      Inside Info:These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way
of making calls to people without being called by the cops or having their
numbers traced and/or tapped...... 
  
     How To Make A Modern Cheese Box 
  
     Ingredients: 
     ------------ 
  
     1 Call Forwarding service on the line
  
     1 Set of Red Box Tones 
  
     The number to your prefix's Inter-cept operator (do some scanning for
this one)
  
     How To: 
     ------- 
  
      After you find the number to theintercept operator in your prefix, use
your call-forwarding and forward all calls to her...this will make your
phone stay off the hook (actually, now it waits for a quarter to be dropped
in) you now have a cheese box. In Order To Call Out On This Line you must
use your Red Box tones and generate the quarter droppingin...then,you can
make phone calls to people...as far as I know, this isfairly safe, and they
do not check much...Although I am not sure, I think you can even make
credit card calls from a cheesebox phone and not get traced.
