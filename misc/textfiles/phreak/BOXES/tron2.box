  THE THING WORKS WHEN THE LOAD IN YOUR HOUSE IS LOW LIKE AT NIGHT TIME.  IT
WILL PUT A REVERSE PHASE SIGNAL ON THE LINE AND CANCEL OUT THE OTHER PHASE AND
PUT A REVERSE PHASE RUNNING EVERY THING IN THE HOUSE.  WELL IF YOU HAVE EVER
SWITCHED THE POWER LEADS ON A D.C.  (BATTERY POWERED) MOTOR YOU WILL SEE THAT IT
RUNS BACKWARDS WELL YOUR ELECTRIC METER SORT OF WORKS THIS WAY...SO REVERSE
PHASE MAKES THE METER SLOW DOWN AND IF YOUR LUCKY IT WILL GO BACKWARDS.  ANYWAY
IT MEANS A CHEAPER ELECTRIC BILL
