               ------ ---

  Tools:

        1 Soldering Iron
        1 Standard Bell Telephone
        1 Foot Of 22 Gauge Wire
        1 Single Pole Doub. Throw Switch
        1 Flat Headed Screw Driver


  Uses:

The  Purpose Of A Silver Box Is To Blow The Information Operators Off The  Line
Through  Fourth  Column Tones.   You And A Friend Can Call Up The Operator  And
Blow Her Off The Line With A D Tone.  One Of You Dial 6 And The Other 7 And You
Connect.

      You Can Fuck Up The International
      Timers With The C Tone.


  Directions:

  1: Unscrew Your Phone.  Remove The
     Telephone Case.

  2: Remove The Mounted Pad By Loosening
     The Screws On The Mount Of This Pad
     Now Remove The Plastice Cover On
     The Pad.

  3: Turn The Pads So That The 0,*,#
     Is Facing You.  Now Turn It Upside
     Down So You Can See The Pc Board.

  4: Now You Should Be Looking At 2
    Black Donuts.

  5: Position The Board So That The
     Solder Points From Left And Attach
     A Green Wire To That Point.

  6: Go Over 4 Points From The Left And
     Attach A Green Wire To That Point.

  7: Between You And The Donuts, There
     Should Be 2 Long Yellow Capacitors
     To The Right Of These, And On The
     Edge Of The Board Should Be 3
     Soldering Contacts We Will Use The
     One On The Left.

  8: The Contact Is Origionally Spot
     Welded, So Snip It Open.  The One
     Nearest You Attach A Red Wire.
     To The Other One, A Yellow Wire.

  9: Now Cut A Small Hole In The Top Of
     Your Telephone And Insert The
     Single Pole Double Throw Switch In
     That Hole.

 10: Run The Wires To The Switch And
     Solder The Switch.  The Orientation
     Should Be Red To The Center, The
     Switch Will Now Alternate Between
     Normal And 1633 Hx Fourth Column
     Tones.

 Notes About The Schematic
 =========================

 1.  Gnd Means Ground
 2.  The Gnd Near The Switch And The Gnd
 By The 2Meg Potentiometer Should Be
 Connected
 3.  Where You See:  )(
                     ()
                     )( It Is The
 Transistor Antenna Coil With 15 Turns Of Regular Hook-Up Wire Around It.
 4.  The Middle Of The Loop On The Left
 Side (The Left Of "()") You Should Run
 A Wire Down To The "+" Which Has
 Nothing Attached To It. There Is A
 .0047 Capacitor On The Correct Piece Of
 Wire.
 5.  For The Microphone Use A Magnetic
 Earphone (1K To 2K).
 6.  Where You See "[!]" Is The Antenna.
 Use About 8 Feet Of Wire To Broadcast
 Approx 300Ft. Part 15 Of The Fcc Rules
 And Regulation Says You Can'T Broadcast
 Over 300 Feet Without A License.
 (Hahaha). Use More Wire For An Antenna
 For Longer Distances. (Attach It To The
 Black Wire On The Fone Line For About A
 250 Foot Antenna!)

 Operation Of The Lunch Box
 ==========================

This  Transmitter  Will Send The Signals Over The Am Radio Band.   You Use  The
Variable Capacitor To Adjust What Freq.   You Want To Use.   Find A Good Unused
Freq.  Down At The Lower End Of The Scale And You'Re Set.  Use The 2 Meg Pot.

To Adjust Gain.  Just Screw With It Until You Get What Sounds Good.  The Switch
On  The  2Meg  Is For Turning The Lunch Box On And Off.    When  Everything  Is
Adjusted, Turn On An Am Radio Adjust It To Where You Think The Signal Is.  Have
[A Friend Say Some Shit Thru The Box And Tune In To It.  That'S All There Is To
It.  The Plans For A Simple Receiver Are Shown Below:

 Closeing Statement
 ==================

This Two Devices Can Be Built For Under Total Of $10.00.   Not Too Bad.   Using
[These Devices In Illegal Ways Is Your Option.   If You Get Caught, I Accept No
Responsibility  For Your Actions.   This Can Be Alot Of Fun If Used  Correctly.
Hook  It  Up To The Red Wire (I Think)  On The Fone Line And It Will  Send  The
Conversation  Over  The Air Waves.   If You Have Any Problems Or Are  Confused,
Leave Me Mail On:Hi-Times=702/832/7469


This  Is A Most Unusual Project;  We Are Going To Mount A Sensitive  Microphone
Behind A Series Of Acoustic Wave Guides And Hope For The Best.   Actually,  Our
Wave  Guides  Are Aluminum Tubes Cut To Resonate At Frequencies Near The  Human
Voice Range.   This Arrangement Also Serves To Make The Unit Highly Directional
As  Sound Other Than That Arriving At The Mouth Of The Tubes Arrives At The Mic
In An Out-Of-Phase Condition And Cancels Itself Out.

With This Easily Constructed Device It Is Possible (Under Ideal Conditions)  To
Pick Up Conversations Several Hundred Feet Away,  In Fact, Reports Of Recording
Conversations Up To 30 Yards Away Through A Closed Window Have Been Made...

The  Device  Is  Quite  Easy To Construct:  First Get  Together  The  Following
Materials:

 [1]  56' Of 3/8" Outside Diameter
      Aluminum Tubing (Hardware Stores)
 [2]  1 Sensitive Amplifier With
      Operating Paraphenalia
 [3]  1 Sensitive Microphone Element -
      Use Either A Good Condenser Or A
      Crystal, As Their Outputs Tend To
      Be A Bit Higher Than Their Dynamic
      Counterparts.
 [4]  1 Funnel
 [5]  Assorted Small Hardware

Cut  The  Tubing  Into  37 Pieces Ranging From 1"  Through  36"   In  One  Inch
Divisions.    Now  Bundle  Them Together Symmetrically With One End  Flush  (As
Shown).   As You Assemble Them,  Blue Them Together In Several Places To Assure
They  Remain  In  The  State You Have Put Them In (Were It Only  So  Easy  With
People...).

                  Ooo
                 Ooooo
                Ooooooo
               Ooooooooo
               Ooooooooo
               Ooooooooo
                Ooooooo
                 Ooooo
                  Ooo

          Flush Ends Of Tubes

Take  The  Funnel And Fit It Around The Flush End Of The Tube  Bundle.    Being
Astute Enough To Read This,  I Am Sure You Will Notice The Tubes Do Not Exactly
Fit  Into The Funnel.   At This Realization,  Take A Small Hammer And Beat  The
Funnel To Nearly As Possible.  Now Fill The Remaining Spaces With A Good Rubber
Based Caulking Compound.

The  Microphone  Element  Is Placed In The Neck Of The Funnel  (With  A  Rubber
Grommet  If It Is Small Enough To Fit Up Into The Neck - Otherwise Set It  Into
The  Other End Of The Neck Before Caulking The Tubing In Place).   Glue The Mic
Into Place And Caulk Any Air Space Around It.

Run  The Microphone Wires Out The Neck Of The Funnel,  Glue In Place,  And Also
Caulk  To Give It A Closed,  Fairly Air Invincible Seal Around The Entire Unti.
If  You Really Feel Up To It,  Fiberglass Resin Can Be Used Instead Of Caulking
Compound.

Run  The Output Wires To Your Amplifier And Place The Entire Unit On Some  Sort
Of Support, A Camera Tripod Being Ideal.   (Need I Remind You To Check Matching
Impedances?).    The Unit Should Be Aimed At The Subject And Then Panned  About
For Maximum Volume (Sound Does Not Travel In A Straight Line, But May Vary With
Wind, Etc).

If  Wind Noise Overrides Your Target Noise You Can Place A Piece Of Cheesecloth
Across The End Of The Unit.   If A Particularly Difficult Noise Interferes With
Your Pick-Up You Can Often Plug Up The Tube(S) Carrying This Noise With A Cork.

            The Clear Box


The  Clear  Box Is A New Device Which Has Just Been Invented That Can  Be  Used
Throughout  Canada And Rural U.S.   The Clear Box Works On "Post Pay"  Payphone
(Fortress  Phones).    Those Are The Payphone That Don'T Require Payment  Until
After The Connection Is Established.   You Pick Up The Phone,  Get A Dial Tone,
Dial Your Number, And Then Insert Your Money After The Person Answers.   If You
Don'T  Deposit The Money Then You Can Not Speak To The Person On The Other End-
Because Your Mouth Piece Is Cut Off, But, Not The Ear Piece.   (Obviously These
Phones  Are  Good  For  Free  Calls To Weather Or  Time  Or  Other  Other  Such
Recordings)

All You Must Do Is Go To Your Nearby Radio Shack, Or Electronics Store, And Get
A Four-Transistor Amplifier And A Telephone Suction Cup Induction Pick-Up.  The
Induction  Pick-Up  Would  Be  Hooked  Up As It  Normally  Would  To  Record  A
Conversation,  Except That It Would Be Plugged Into The Output Of The Amplifier
And A Microphone Would Be Hooked To The Input.  So When The Party That Is Being
Called  Answers,  The Caller Could Speak Through The Little Microphone Instead.
His Voice Then Goes Through The Amplifier And Out The Induction Coil,  And Into
The  Back  Of The Reciever Where It Would Then Be Broadcast Through The  Phone!
Lines And The Other Party Would Be Able To Hear The Caller.  The Clear Box Thsu
'Clears  Up'  The Problem Of Not Being Heard.   Luckily,  The Line Will Not  Be
Cut-Off  After  A Certain Amount Of Time Because It Will Wait Forever  For  The
Coins To Be Put In.

The  Biggest Advantage For All Of Us About This New Clear Box Is The Fact  That
This Type Of Payphone Willl Most Likely Become Very Common Due To A Few Things:

  1: It Is A Cheap Way Of Getting The
     Dtf, Dial-Tone-Service

  2: It Doesn'T Require Any Special
     Equipment,(For The Phone Company)

  3: This Payphone Will Work On Any
      Phone Line.  Usually A Payphone
     Line Is Different, But This Is A
     Regular Phone Line And It Is Set
     Up So The Phone Does All The
     Charging, Not The Company.

  File: Detecting Phone Bugs

       Bug Detection On Home Phones

First  Of  All To Test For Bugs,  You Need A Vom (Multimeter)  The  Higher  The
Impedance  The Better (A Digital With Fet Circuitry Or A Vacuum Tube Volt Meter
Is The Best).

First Disconnect The Phone Line(S) At Both Ends.  Undo The Phone Instrument And
Hook It Up To The Entry Point Of The Phone Line From The Outside World (Ma Bell
Does  Not  Like You Cut Her Off Completely.)   The Scheme Is The  Physi-  Cally
Isolate Your House,  Apartment, Etc From The Outside World.   But Before You Do
This Measure The Line Voltage (It Should Be Approximately 48 Volts).

Now  With  The  Wires Disconnected At Both Set Your Resistance Scal To  A  High
Reading And Measure The Resistance Of The Phone Line, It Should Be Very High On
The Order Of Million Ohms Or More,  This Is The Normal Condition, Since You Are
Measuring  The  Resistance  Of  An Open Circuit.   If It  Is  Much  Less,   Say
50-100Kohms Then You A Device On The Line That Does Not Belong There,  Probably
A Parallel Bug.

Now  Twist The End Of The Disconnected Wire And Go To The Other End And Measure
The Resistance Of This.   This Resistance Should Be About One Ohm Or Two At The
Most  In A Big House With A Lot Of Phones.   If It Is More,  Then You  Probably
Have A Series Bug.

If In The First Case, Taking Parallel Measurements Using A Meter (Not Led/ Lcd)
And You Notice A "Kick" In The Needle, You Probably Have A Line Tap

Now  If You Also Make A Measurement With The Wire End Twisted Together And  You
Notice The Resistance Reads About 1-2Kohms, Then You May Have A Drop-Out Relay.
A  Drop-Out Relay Is A Relay That Senses A Phone Going Off Hook,  And Signals A
Tape Recorder To Start Recording.

Another  Test  To Do With The Phones Still Hooked Up To The Outside World,   On
Hook  Voltage  Is About 48 Volts And Off Hook Is About 6-10 Volts.   Any  Other
Con- Ditions May Mean Telephone Surveillance.

If  You  Use  A  Wide  Range Audio Frequency  Generator  And  Call  You  House,
Apartment, Etc.  From Another Phone And Sweep Up And Down The Spectrum, And You
Notice  The  Phone Answers Itself Somewhere In The Sweep You Probably  Have  An
Infinity Transmitter On Your Line.

The Above Information Tells Nothing About Telco Taps At The Central Office,  Or
Anywhere Else Along The Line, But This Information May Tell You That Your Wife,
Girlfriend(Boyfriend),   Or  Business  Associate May Be Monitoring  Your  Phone
Activities.

An Infinity Transmitter Is A Neat Device It Allows You To Call The Bugged Place
And  It Shuts Off The Ringer And Defeats The Switchhook,  So The Mouthpiece Now
Becomes A Room Bug.   It Was Orginally Sold From The Travelling Business Man To
Make  Sure  His  Wife  Was  Safe At Home Not Being  Attacked  (Or  Fucking  Her
Boyfriend Behind His Back).

The  Red Bos Basically Simulates The Sound Of Coins Being Dropped Into The Coin
Slot  Of  A  Pay Telephone.   A Pay Telephone Generates A Burst  Of  Two  Mixed
Frequencies,   1700  Hz And 2200 Hz,  For A Specfic Time Interval To  Denote  A
Nickle,  Dime, Or Quarter.   A Nickle Is 7700 Hz + 2200 Hz For 66 Milliseconds.
A  Dime  Is 1700 Hz + 2200 Hz For 66 Ms On,  66 Ms Off,  Then 66 Ms  On  Again.
Finally,  A Quarter Is 1700 Hz + 2200 Hz For 33 Ms On,  33 Ms Off,  Continuosly
Repeating For 5 Times.

When Using A Red Box On A Pay Phone,  First Deposit A Real Nickle (Becuase They
Can Tell If The First One Is A Real One Or Just A Tone

Diagram  #2 Should Connect To The Right Of Diagram #1,  My 40 Character Display
Requires  I Cut It Off Here.   If You Cut A Printout Of #2 Out And Place It  To
The  Right Of #1 They Should Match Up Perfectly.   Diagram #3 Is The  Schematic
For The Power Supply.  1 And 2 Of Course Are The Box Itself.

The Spot On The Diagram That Has 700, 900, Etc.  Should Be Filled In With A 25K
Multi-Turn Potentiometer (Variable Resistor).  The 15-Turn Pot From Radio Shack
(#271-340) Will Work If A 1/4 Watt, 5%, 5K Resistor Is Put In Series.

The  Easiest  Way To Tune The Box Is To Play Both It And A Sample Of  The  True
Sound  Together,   Then  Adjust The Box Until Only 1 Note Can  Be  Heard.    As
Inaccurate  As  This  Sounds,  This Is More Than Accurate Enough For  The  Fone
Company.   The Apple With An Apple Cat Modem, The Atari, The Commodore, And The
Texas Instruments Can All Generate The Needed Tones.

These  Plans  Are Based On A Set Of Plans I (Ford Prefect)  Received Two  Years
Ago.   They Were Almost Illegible And The Power Supply Included Outdated Parts.
The  Total Cost Is Slightly Above $50 But When Properly Assembled It Will  Work
Perfectly.  (These Plans Have Been Field Tested!)
