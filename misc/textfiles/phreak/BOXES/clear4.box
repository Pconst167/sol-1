The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be
used throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on
"PostPay" payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont
require payment until after the connection is established. You pick up the
fone, get a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after
the person answers. If you dont deposit the money then you can not speak
to the person on the other end- because your mouth peice is cut off, but,
not the ear piece. (obviously these phones are nice for free calls to
weather or time or other such recordings). All you must do is to go to
your nearby Radio Shack, or electronics store, and get a four-transistor
amplifier and a telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction
pick-up would be hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation,
except that it would be plugged into the out put of the amplifier and a
microphone would be hooked to the input. So when the party that is being
called answers, the caller could speak through the little microphone
instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out the induction
coil, and into the back of the reciever where it would then be broadcast
through the phone lines and the other party would be able to hear the
caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard.
Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time
because it will wait forever for the coins to be put in. The biggest
advantage for all of us about this new clear box is the fact that this
type of payphone will most likely become very common. Due to a few things:
1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first service, 2nd, it
doesnt require any special equipment, (for the phone company) This
payphone will work on any phone line. Ususally a payphone line is
different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone
does all the charging, not the company.
