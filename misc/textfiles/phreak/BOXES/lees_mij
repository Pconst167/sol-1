OK WELL THIS ARTICLE WILL DEAL WITH  SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL,
INCLUDING EVEN THE MOST DIE HARD  PHREAKERS,DONT KNOW.THE FIRST PART  WILL DEAL
WITH THE BACKGROUND KNOW-HOW ,THE SECOND PART WILL DEAL WITH THE  TONES
NEEDED.THE THIRD WILL DEAL WITH WHAT TO DO WITH THEM WHEN YOU HAVE  THEM.THE
FOURTH PART WILL BE THE  THE CONCLUDING PART,ON THE AMERICAN PORTION.

.           FIRST LESSON
THE WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT PART.

WELL THE WORD PHREAKING REALLY MEANS GETTING A CALL TO GO THROUGH AND NOT
HAVING TO PAY FOR IT.THE REST OF THIS ARTICLE WILL USE THE TERM PHREAKER OR
PHREAKING. WELL PHREAKING REALLY STARTED IN 1960 WHEN TWO MEN FOUND,IN THE
BOTTOM OF THIER TELEPHONE COMPANY,A OLD,OLD,OLD TEC-MANUAL.IT HAD ALL THE INFO
ON  TELCO TERMINOLGY OF THAT DAY,AND THE  SUCH,BUT THE BEST PART OF THE OLD
MANUAL WAS,----THE TRUNCK TONES. THEY TOLD HOW TO,WHEN TO,WHAT SHOULD
HAPPEN,AND THE SUCH.THAT FAITHFULL DAY BACK IN 1968,WAS THE DAWNING OF THE
PHREAKER.

.          SECOND LESSON
.               OR
.   OK THAT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO WHAT ABOUT NOW,AND HOW CAN I PUT THAT OLD
STUFF TO WORK FOR ME??

WELL YOU NEED ONE OF TWO THINGS 1-A COMPUTER CAPABLE OF PLAYING MUSIC. 2-A HOME
MADE MEMORY REDIAL BLUE BOX.

AND WELL SINCE,I GUESS,YOU ARE READING THIS OFF OF A BBS YOU ALREADY HAVE 1
SOOOOO PUT IT TO USE BUB!!

THE TONES THAT MAKE UP A KEY.

AND LEAST BUT NOT LAST THE MAGICICAL TONE,THAT DOES IT ALL,2600HZ.


.            THIRD LESSON
.                 OR
.WELL HELL DUDE KEEP GOING,CAUSE I'M
.          READY AND WILLING.

OK SO YOUR JUST SITTING THERE LOOKING AT THIS DUMB PGM YOU MADE,WELL ENOUGH OF
THE TECH INFO,NOW FOR THE HANDS ON. YOU MUST ALWAYS BEFORE A CALL GET INTO A
TRUNK THIS TODAY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CALLING A STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING SYSTEM,AS
OPPOSED TO CROSSBAR,ESS,OR DMS.FOR SAKE OF SIMPLICITY I WILL USE MONTREAL
DIRECTORY ASSICTANCE. CALL ON YOU PHONE,(DTMF),TOUCH-TONES. 1-514-555-1212,WHEN
YOU HEAR IT RING PLAY INTO THE PHONE 2600HZ.IF ALL GOES WELL YOU WILL HEAR
KERCHINK KERCHUNK SLINCE.NOW AFTER YOU DO THIS NO MORE TOUCH TONES WILL BE
USED. FOR YOUR FIRST TIME TRY 2600HZ WAIT 1 SEC AND KEY IN KP,ALL CALLS MUST
START WITH KP AND END IN ST,YOUR  FRIENDS AREA CODE AND # AND ST.NOW  WAIT.IF
ALL GOES WELL IT WILL RING AND YOUR FRIEND WILL ANSWER.BUT DON'T STAY ON TOO
LONG.

.           FOURTH LESSON
.                OR
.  YEA BUT WHATS ALL THE HIDDEN STUFF
.           I HEAR ABOUT.

OK SO YOU GOT THIS FAR AND ARE HUNGRY FOR MORE,WELL IF YOU ARE NOT THEN YOU
WILL NEVER BE CLASSIFIED AS A PHREAKER BUT A LOSER. THIS SYSTEM HAS A GREAT
MANY FILES ON JUST THAT SUBJECT SO LOOK  THEM OVER.IF YOU READ SOMETHING ON
ANOTHER GREAT FILE,AND DON'T  UNDERSTAND IT,THEN YOU ARE MESSING  WITH
SOMETHING OUT OF YOU LEAGUE. GRADUALLY BUILD UP TO IT THEN YOU WILL NOT BE
CONSIDERED A LOSER BUT A GREAT PHREAKER. YOU KNOW I STARTED 6-7 YEARS AGO AND I
TOO HAD TO GRADUALLY BUILD UP TO IT, BUT NOT UNTILL A YEAR AGO THIS MONTH  DID
I HAVE AS MUCH FUN IN IT,AS YOU  WILL.AS I AM WRITING THIS ARTICLE I  STILL
HAVE VISIONS OF ALL THE GOOD  BBS'S THAT USED TO BE UP TO HELP  NEW PHREAKS AND
EXPERT PHREAKS,AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL KINDA SORROWED THAT THEY ARE JUST A
HANDFULL OF GOOD BBS'S AROUND FOR ALL THE FUTURE PHREAKS OF  THE WORLD TO LEARN
ON.

--------------------------------------

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FOR ADVANCE TO EXPERT PHREAKERS ONLY!!!

--------------------------------------
OK ENOUGH OF THAT OLD HAT HERE IS WHAT I MEANT ABOUT 'EVEN THE DIE HARD PHREAKS
DON'T KNOW'. THIS WAS FOUND OUT ON OCT 10 1984 STRAIGHT FROM TELECOM AUSTRALIA.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE TONES ARE FOR THE CCITT #5 IS,WHICH BY THE WAY IS
USED BY THE REST OF THE WORLD!!


.           FIFTH LESSON
.                OR
HOW TO GET ON ANOTHER COUNTRIES TRUNK.


OK FIRST HERE ARE THE FREQUENCIES

--------------------------------------

--------------------------------------


OK SO NOW YOU HAVE THE FREQUENCIES LETS GET ON A AUSTRALIAN TRUNK.

YOU MUST FIRST CALL AN AUSTRALIAN # AND SINCE SOMETHING MAY GO WRONG FOR  YOU
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,I SUGGEST STRONGLY CALLING THROUGH AN EXTENDER THAT WILL
ALLOW AN OVERSEAS CALL TO GO THROUGH. IF YOU HAVE ONE PUT IT TO USE NOW!!

OK LETS ASSUME YOU DO.WELL CALL AN AUSTRALIAN # AND WHEN YOU HEAR IT RING PLAY
THE MAGICAL TONES FOR THE CCITT EQUIPMENT,ITS 2400HZ+2600HZ,WHEN YOU DO THIS
YOU WILL HEAR A SOUND WHICH WILL MAKE YOU THINK THAT THE  CONNECTION WAS
LOST,BUT IT WASN'T,IN FACT YOU ARE NOW ON AN AUSTRALIAN  TRUNK!! AND BY THE
WAY,THERE IS NOT A 10SEC TRUNK TIME OUT.


.           SIXTH LESSON
.                OR
.      THE KEY DEFINITONS PART.


NOW YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PROPER PROCEDURE FOR THE CCITT LINE,AND WHAT KEYS DO
WHAT. KEYS 0-12 ARE EXACTLY LIKE OURS!!


KEY DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------
13 IS LIKE OUR KP.
14 IS LIKE OUR KP2.
15 IS LIKE OUR ST.
--------------------------------------


.           SEVENTH LESSON
.                OR
. THE PROPER PROCEDURE AND KEY USAGE
.               PART.

OK NOW YOU KNOW ALL THE KEYS AND TONES SO NOW IT IS TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE
THEM. LETS ASSUME YOU WERE GOING TO CALL A # IN AUSTRALIA,THE PROCEDURE WOULD
BE-> 13+5+15+0+AC+# WAIT ABOUT 2OR3 SECS  AND ENTER 1(OPER) OR 2(SUBSCRIBER) OR
3(TEST CALL). AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SOUNDS YOU HEAR AFTER YOU KEY IN THE
TONES, BECAUSE ALL CCITT#5 TRUNKS ARE SUPPOSE TO ECHO BACK EACH CHAR YOU KEY
IN!! NOW LETS CALL THE UNITED STATES. PROCEDURE WOULD BE-->13+2(A LIVE OPER)
OR0(SUBSCRIBER)+AC+#+15. NOW IF IT COULDN'T BE PUT THROUGH, REORDER OR AN
INTERNATIONAL RECORDING TRY THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL SENDER AUSTRALIA HAS,IT'S
MONTREAL CANADA. YOU WOULD ENTER 14+COUNTRY CODE+2OR0+ AC+#+15. NOW THAT SHOULD
BE ABOUT ALL THAT YOU NEED KNOW TO HAVE FUN ON ANOTHER COUNTRIES TRUNK.

.           EIGHTH LESSON
.                OR
.        THE CONCLUDING PART.

WELL IF YOU ACCTUALLY LIVED IN  AUSTRALIA YOU WOULD HAVE A BITCH OF A TIME
BOXING,DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY USE DC PHONES UNLIKE OUR AC PHONES. YOU SEE
WHEN WE HANG-UP OUR PHONES THE PHONE SHOOTS A 2600HZ TONE TO TELL THE PHONE
COMPANY THAT THE PARTY HAS  HUNG-UP,BUT OVER THERE THEY JUST  REMOVE THE
GROUND,OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LINE,SO THERE ARE NO TONES LIKE OURS.IF YOU
ARE SAYING HEY YOU MUST BE WRONG I KNOW SUCH AND SUCH WHO LIVES THERE AND BOXES
ALL THE TIME,WELL YOUR PARTIALLY RIGHT.THEY DO,OR AT LEAST  THEY DID.IN THE
PAST FEW YEARS A CALL TO THE STATES COST THEM ABOUT 20-30 A MIN.WHICH EQUALS
ABOUT 25-40$ OUR  MONEY.BUT THEY DID ONE UP ON THIER TELECOMM,THIER LIKE THE
OLD A.T.T. MA-BELL,YOU SEE THEY WOULD SHORT HAUL THIER CALLS TO THE STATES.WHAT
THEY WOULD DO IS CALL NEW ZEALAND AND THEN BLAST THE 2400+2600HZ SIGNAL AND
BOOM THEY WOULD BE PAYING FOR A CALL TO NEW ZEALAND,THE COST IS LIKE CALLING
FROM NY TO LA HERE,A SUBSTANIAL DIFFERENCE BUT YOU SEE THAT IS NOT SO ANYMORE.
THE COST IS ABOUT THE SAME,$1.00  DIFFERENCE A MIN,SO AUSTRALIANS DON'T REALLY
NEED TO BOX ANYMORE,AND THEY  DON'T!!WELL I HAVE TRIED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE
NEW THIS FIELD AND THE OLD  TIMERS IN IT TOO,WITH THIS ARTICLE. I HOPE THAT AT
LEAST ONE LESSON HELPS SOME OF YOU OUT THERE!!

I WISH TO THANK THE FOLLOWING.

TELECOM AUSTRALIA

A.T.T. WHICH WITHOUT THIER LINES I  COULD NEVER HAVE HAD AS MUCH FUN IN THIS
FIELD,OR LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE WORLD!!
(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)
(*) Crimson Box (*)
(*)    Plans    (*)
(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)

The Crimson Box is very simple device
that will allow you to put someone on
hold or make your fone busy with a
large amount of ease. You flip a switch
and the person can't hear you talking.
Flip it back and everything is peechy.

(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)
(*)   Needed Materials  (*)
(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)
[
(1) 100 ohm or less resistor
(1) SPDT toggle switch, On-On
(3) feet of good wire
Wire cutters
Solder and soldering iron

(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)
(*)   Construction & Schemtaic  (*)
(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)*(*)

First I will give you the schematic and
then I will explain what the hell is
going on.

[-----------black wire on line---------
--------+   red wire on line   +------
--------!--+/\/\/-green wire---!------
--------!--! yellow wire-------!------
        !  !                   !
        +--!------+            !
           +----+ ! +----------+
                ! ! !
                1 2 3

Ok. The '/\/\/' is the resistor. And
'1 2 3' is the switch where the numbers
are the poles on the switch. Notice you
leave the black and yellow wires alone.
You DO NOT cut them!

Strip the red and green wires so you've
got about an inch of bare wire. Solder
some of the extra wire and follow the
schematic. You should have the resistor
on the green wire with an extra piece
of wire coming from one leg of it. The
other leg goes to the other end of the
green wire. You should solder the green
wire to the left pole of the switch and
the red to the middle and the other
end of the red to the right pole.

Now, lift up the phone. If all you get
is an annoying buzz then throw the
[switch and you should get a dial tone.
If not, don't worry and just follow the
instructions and schematic again.
