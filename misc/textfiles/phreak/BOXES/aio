 Basicly, this should be common sense.. All You have to do is by a small
 box (Preferable a rated box that will keep it from interfering with
 that nice Raidio you carded last week <grin>)

  If you want to be real cheap about it you can go with just a plywoord
  box... But I highly suggest you use a PC case.. or something that will
  not burn (Overloads?)

 Then simply assemble that boxes discussed in this file.. Now after you
 do that.. You're gonna have alot of boxes cluttering the old room. What
 to do? Simple.. Getcha a powersupply.. And some switches (on/off) from
 Raidio Shack (Yes pay for them.. They're not that expensive) Now.. if
 you buy you a bread board. (Cards kits can be picked up anywhere. And
 this is the type you should use) Then simply install the box on one of
 these. And incase them in the PC case. Now.. You can drill a hole in
 the case and run the line in there.. and likewise have another hole
 drilled for the line to run back out (Phone that have a hook up for
 more than one regular line can give you some of the parts)

 Next install the cards.. You *MUST* Use a low voltage power supply
 (These boxes don't need much if any.. And make sure that you check the
 voltage in the circuit.. You can run it to a light bulb if you need
 someplace to disperse some of it!

 No the simple task.. Where the Disk Drives normaly go simply Hook you
 up some on off switches.. So that you can easily switch between the
 boxes.. This will make life SOOOOOO much easier... I promise..

 Also if you want to make it easier with the phone lines you can aphro engineer
 a line in. IE run the phone line in to box along the back with them being fully
 exposed.. IE

 This allows for a sort of switching system as it were. After this is done..
 Simple solder wires where need and run them to the appropriate box.. you may
 then hook a lever (Like you see in those old Frakenstein movies) to the box to
 allow box priorty over the line..

 All in all this is pretty simple shit. But just some ideas for you to play
 with....
