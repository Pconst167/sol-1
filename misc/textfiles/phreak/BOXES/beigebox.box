--------------------------------Introduction-------------------------------
    Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset? Surely every phreak has at
least once considered the phun that he could have with one. After searching
unlocked phone company trucks for months, we had an idea. We could build one.
We did, and named it the "Beige Box" simply because that is the color of ours.
In the following file we will give the construction and use  of a Beige Box.
----------------------------Construction and Use---------------------------
    The construction is very simple. First you must understand the concept of
the device. In a modular jack, there are four wires. These are red, green,
yellow, and black. For a single line telephone, however, only two matter: the
red (ring) and green (tip). The yellow and the black are not neccessary for
this project. A lineman's handset has two clips on it: the ring and the tip.
Take a modular jack and look at the bottom of it's casing. There should be a
grey jack with four wires  (red, green, yellow & black) leading out of it. To
the end of the red wire attar plug into the modular
jack. That's it. This particular model is nice because it is can be easily
made, is inexpensive, usues common parts that are readily available, is small,
is lightweight, and does not require the destruction of a phone.
--------------------------------Beige Box Uses----------------------------
    There are many uses for a Beige Box. However, before you can use it, you
must know how to attach it to the output device. This device can be of any of
Bell switching apparatus that include germinal sets (i.e. remote switching
centers, bridgin heads, cans, etc.). To open most Bell Telephone switching
apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex driver (or a good pair of needle nose
pliers work also). This piece of equipment can be picked up at your local
hardware store. With your hex driver (or pliers), turn the security bolt(s)
aproximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and open. If your output device
is locked, then you must have some knowledge of destroying and/or picking
picking locks. However, we have never encountered a locked output device. Once
you have opened your output device, you should see a mass of wires connected
to terminals. On most output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip
-- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not labeled,
usually on the right). Remember: Ring - red - right. The "Three R's" -- a
simple way to remember which is which. Now you must attach all the red
alligator clip (Ring) to the "R" (Ring) terminal. Attach the green alligator
clip (Tip) to the "T" (Tip) terminal. Note: If instead of a dial tone you hear
nothing, adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each other
terminals. Also make sure they are firmly attached. By this time you should
hear a dial tone. Dial ANI to find out the number you are using (you wouldn't
want to use your own). Here are some practicle aplications:
       o Eavesdropping
       o Long distance, static free free fone calls to phriends
       o Dialing direct to Alliance Telec  Code scan:  to 999999
