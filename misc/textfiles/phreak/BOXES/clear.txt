CLEAR BOX PLANS

   THE CLEAR BOX IS A NEW DEVICE WHICH HAS JUST BEEN INVENTED THAT CAN BE USED
THROUGHOUT CANADA AND RURAL UNITED STATES. THE CLEAR BOX WORKS ON "POSTPAY"
PAYPHONES (FORTRESS FONES). THOSE ARE THE PAYPHONES THAT DONT REQUIRE PAYMENT
UNTIL AFTER THE CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED. YOU PICK UP THE FONE, GET A DIAL
TONE, DIAL YOUR NUMBER, AND THEN INSERT YOUR MONEY AFTER THE PERSON ANSWERS.
IF YOU DONT DEPOSIT THE MONEY THEN YOU CAN NOT SPEAK TO THE PERSON ON THE
OTHER END- BECAUSE YOUR MOUTH PEICE IS CUT OFF, BUT, NOT THE EAR PIECE.
(OBVIOUSLY THESE PHONES ARE NICE FOR FREE CALLS TO WEATHER OR TIME OR
OTHER SUCH RECORDINGS).
ALL YOU MUST DO IS TO GO TO YOUR NEARBY RADIO SHACK, OR ELECTRONICS
STORE, AND GET A FOUR-TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER AND A TELEPHONE SUCTION CUP
INDUCTION PICK-UP. THE INDUCTION PICK-UP WOULD BE HOOKED UP AS IT NORMALLY
WOULD TO RECORD A CONVERSATION, EXCEPT THAT IT WOULD BE PLUGGED INTO THE OUT-
PUT OF THE AMPLIFIER AND A MICROPHONE WOULD BE HOOKED TO THE INPUT. SO WHEN
THE PARTY THAT IS BEING CALLED ANSWERS, THE CALLER COULD SPEAK THROUGH THE
LITTLE MICROPHONE INSTEAD. HIS VOICE THEN GOES THROUGH THE AMPLIFIER AND OUT
THE INDUCTION COIL, AND INTO THE BACK OF THE RECIEVER WHERE IT WOULD THEN BE
BROADCAST THROUGH THE PHONE LINES AND THE OTHER PARTY WOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR
THE CALLER. THE CLEAR BOX THUS 'CLEARS UP' THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING HEARD.
LUCKILY, THE LINE WILL NOT BE CUT-OFF AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE
IT WILL WAIT FOREVER FOR THE COINS TO BE PUT IN.
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE FOR ALL OF US ABOUT THIS NEW CLEAR BOX IS THE
FACT THAT THIS TYPE OF PAYPHONE WILL MOST LIKELY BECOME VERY COMMON.
DUE TO A FEW THINGS: 1ST, IT IS A CHEAP WAY OF GETTING THE ÄÔÆ,DIAL-TONE-FIRST
SERVICE, 2ND, IT DOESNT REQUIRE ANY SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, (FOR THE PHONE COMPANY)
THIS PAYPHONE WILL WORK ON ANY PHONE LINE. USUSALLY A PAYPHONE LINE IS
DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS A REGULAR PHONE LINE AND IT IS SET UP SO THE PHONE
DOES ALL THE CHARGING, NOT THE COMPANY.

   The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used
throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on "PostPay"
payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont require payment
until after the c
onnec
tion is established. You pick up the fone, get a dial tone, dial your number,
and then insert your money after the person answers.  If you dont deposit the
money then you can not speak to the person on the other end- because your
mouth peice is cut o
ff, b
ut, not the ear piece.  (obviously these phones are nice for free calls to
weather or time or other such recordings).
All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or electronics
store, and get a four-transistor amplifier and a telephone suction cup
induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be hooked up as it normally
would to record a conversatio
n, ex
cept that it would be plugged into the output of the amplifier and a
microphone would be hooked to the input. So when the party that is being
called answers, the caller could speak through the little microphone instead.
His voice then goes through th
e amp
lifier and out the induction coil, and into the back of the reciever where it
would then be broadcast through the phone lines and the other party would be
able to hear the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not
being heard. Luckily
, the
 line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because it will wait
forever for the coins to be put in.
The biggest advantage for all of us about this new clear box is the
fact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common. Due to a
few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first service,
2nd, it doesnt req
uire
any special equipment, (for the phone company) This payphone will work on any
phone line. Ususally a payphone line is different, but this is a regular phone
line and it is set up so the phone does all the charging, not the company.
