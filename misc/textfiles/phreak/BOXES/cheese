    A Cheese Box (named for the type of Box the first one was found in) is a
type of Box which will, in effect, make your telephone a Pay-Phone.....This is
a simple, modernized, and easy way of doing it....

Inside Info: These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way of making
calls to people without being called by the cops or having their numbers traced
and/or tapped......

 How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

 MATERIALS:  >-:->>   Call Forwarding service on the line
              >-:->>  Set of Red Box Tones
             >-:->>   The number to your prefix's Intercept operator (do some 
                      scanning for this one)

 PROCEDURE

    After you find the number to the intercept operator in your prefix, use
your call-forwarding and forward all calls to her... this will make your phone
stay off the hook (actually, now it waits for a quarter to be dropped in)...
you now have a Cheese Box... In order to call out on this line: you must use
your Red Box tones and generate the quarter dropping in...then, you can make
phone calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly safe, and they do not
check much...
