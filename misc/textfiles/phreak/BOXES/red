  Okay.  First, the basics, for the people who don't know what Red Box tones
  are.  A Red Box is a device that generates Quarter, Dime and Nickle tones,
  so the operator thinks that coins have been dropped in the slots.  For a 
  Quarter there are 5 beeps that are outpulsed at 12-17 pulses, for the dime 
  there are 2 beeps that are outpulsed at 5-8.5 PPS and for a nickle one beep 
  outpulsed the same as a dime.  Now each beep consists of 2 tones which are 
  2200hz and 1700hz.  Below is a way to get these tones without having to
  actually build a Red Box.

                              _______________________

 Materials needed:
 ________ ________    )-:->>   Trusted friend (HA HA HA....AHHHH.......)
	 |             )-:->>  Micro cassette recorder (preferably)
                      )-:->>   Telefone pickup from your local Radio Shack


  Now go down to the fortress fones.  Do it at night, as it's not advisable 
  to do in the day-time when people can see you.

  Look for two fortress fone booths connected together.  This will make the
  job a lot easier if you are alone.  Now, connect the telefone pickup to the 
  receiver of the handset of one of the telefones.  (And don't forget to 
  connect it to your cassette recorder).  You might have to tape the telefone 
  pick-up to the receiver.
 
  Now put the fone on hook and go to the neighbouring fone booth.  From here 
  make a telefone call to the first booth.  

                  // ------------------------------------- \\
                 <<    NOW FROM HERE ON IS THE HARD PART    >>
                  \\ ------------------------------------- //

  Leave your handset hanging and quickly go to the other fone booth where the
  telefone pickup is hooked up.  Press the recording button.  Then pick up the
  handset and LEAVE IT OFF HOOK (remember the recording is still going on).
  Now go to the second telefone booth where you made the call, drop a couple of
  quarters, dimes and nickles.

  You are done!!!!!!!  When you play back the cassette you will hear the tones
  of the coins you put in.

  This procedures may also work from home, whereby you'll have the telefone 
  pick-up connected at home, and someone calls you and drops in the coins.
