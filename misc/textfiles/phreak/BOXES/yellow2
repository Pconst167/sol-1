"YELLOW BOX PLANS"

Now to begin with you need the following:

1) A telephone line showing up in the wall.  You can find the opening
   behind all thorg round plates AT&T puts in when they disconnect
   or begin to put a phone in.

2) 1 Modular jack

3) 1 Screwdriver

4) 1 Human being who knows what the hell their doing!!!!(in other words an 
   IQ of 3 or so will do)

PREPARATION:

1) Open the plate to expose the wire running through the wall or you can 
   remove an old jack to find the wire.  (Note: it must be a complete 
   wire not an end as is used for the setup of a normal phone)

2) Cut the wire in half.  Now check your other phones (Note: I had 2 other
   phones so one works the other won't)

3) Now splice up the 2 ends of the wire you just cut.  You will find
   4 or 6 color coded wires on each end.

4) Splice up each smaller wire so as the metal is exposed.

5) Next now this is the hard part look at the jack at match the colors
   (Note:if you can't do this: a) get a very sharp razor blade b) now put 
   to the wrists and slice that. c) wait about an hour and your dead
   KINDA FINAL ISNT IT!!!!!

6) Each screw will now have 2 of each color wire on it.

7) Plug in the phone.
