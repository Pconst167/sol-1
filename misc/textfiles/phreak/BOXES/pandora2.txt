                 The New & Improved Pandora's Box
                         By Gravedigger
                   Plans orginally by Dr. Rat

This is a prank box, but is lots of fun to use. this box was invented in 1986
and has not been used too much. I decided to make one, and after about have an
hour, the damn thing blew out. I thought about ways to fix this problem and I
finally came up with a solution...attach a voltage regulator.

STUFF YOU NEED:
        - A TLC555 CMOS timer
        - A .01 MFD Capacitor
        - A 100k variable Resistor
        - A Tweeter
        - 2 9v batteries (The orginal plans call for one, but I cannot get to
          work on one 9v battery)
        - Wire
        - An adjustible voltage regulator (any kind will do, just make sure it
          has a range of 9-18v

NOTE: Pin one of the TLC555 chip has a small black dot on the top of the chip
      Variable resistors have 3 leads--the cirult requires only two so connect
      one wire to the middle lead and the other to one of the others.

USES:There seems to be no real H/P/A uses of the pandora's box, but is great to
use on operators that fucked up something you were trying to do. works best on
Girls, animals, and small children.

P.S. Adjust the box so so that you just can't hear it. and let it run, your ears
and everyone else's ears in audio range will buzz. (Great for classes you want
to get out of soon. if you do this, make sure you have earplugs). If you wait
longer, they will start feeling pains in their neck & head that just creates
more pain. Be creative, figure out uses for it, Shit, theres millions,
