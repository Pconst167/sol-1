Well most of you always wanted to be able to connect your voice to either
phone line or the computer to either line, so you can voice on line 1 and
compute on line 2 or visa versa, well here is how to do it. Also contained
in the directions is how to connect both lines togeather so a hacker friend
can view all you are doing either by useing both lines or via 3 way calling.
As a bonus you also get a Power Drain circut (aka Aqua Box), for those times
that you may find the Feds are 'Lock in Traceing' your line. You will also be
able to monitor your line too, as to when there is a ring, between rings,
when the lines clears, and the Dreaded 'Lock in Trace' is on!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Materials needed:

Switches 1, 2, 3 = 3 position, 6 post, DPDT switch, 2 positions on, 1 off.

Switches 4, 5, 6, 7 = 2 position, 2 post, DPDT switch, 1 position on, 1 off.

Connecting wire = Any copper wire comprabale to that of the phone line
                  copper wire.

Small lite = 2 120 VAC lites. (preferably 2 different colors, I use green
             on line #1 and Amber on line #2)

RJ-11 Jack = 4 jacks with connections for all 4 wires.

Lite bulb = 100 watt lite bulb

Lite base = A screw in base for the lite, with the 2 connecting wires.

A Box = Some sort of box or Cabinet like you get at Radio Shack.

Phone line = 2 Modem type, Male both ends RJ-11 jack

The Yellow Wire from each phone line must be grounded outside!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Male ended Phone wire, both ends from the box to the Wall. Same kind you
use from modem to wall jack. This makes for fast removal fo the box if nessary.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mount your switches, jacks, 120 Vac lites the Cabinet front first, except
mount the litebulb base on the side or top, not inside the cabinet, unless
you want the heat of the bulb (if you need to use it) to melt your wireing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(before connecting wires to switches, make sure all switches are in the)
(center 'OFF' position! Or just 'OFF' position!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connect wires in the following order:

1aw -> 1a1, 1a1 -> 1a2, 1a2 -> 1a3

1bw -> 1b1, 1b1 -> 1b2, 1b2 -> 1b3

2aw -> 2a1, 2a1 -> 2a2, 2a2 -> 2a3

2bw -> 2b1, 2b1 -> 2b2, 2b2 -> 2b3

1a2 -> 1c,  1c  -> 1cw

1a3 -> 2c,  2c  -> 2cw

3a  -> 3c1, 3c2 -> 5a,  3b  -> 5b

4a  -> 4c1, 4c1 -> 6a,  4b  -> 6b

4a1 -> 7a,  4b1 -> 7b

5a1 -> 5a,  5b1 -> 5b

6a1 -> 6a,  6b1 -> 6b

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tape off the end of 9aw and 9bw (black wire) you dont need them yet, unless
you are interested in getting vidio picture phones.

[ The Lock in Trace ]
(switch #1 explained)
---------------------

Every true Hacker & Phreak lives in fear of the dredded F.B.I. 'Lock in Trace.'
For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the lock in trace.  Switch #1
does offer an escape route with simple directions to it. 

A 'Lock in Trace' is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone users
location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress. For those of
you who are not familiar with the conecpt of 'locking in', then here's a breif
desciption.

 The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation, sort of like a three-way call 
connection. Then, when they get there, they can plug electricity into the 
phone line. All phone connections are held open by a certain voltage of 
electricity, that is why you sometimes get static and faint connections when
you are calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping the line
up. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate that same
voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang up, voltage
is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was calling you even after
you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should understand better about 
that, for call waiting intersepts the electricity and makes a tone that means
someone is going through your line. Then, it is a matter of which voltage is
higher. When you push down the receiver, then it see-saws the electricity to
the other side. When you have a person on each line it is impossible to hang 
up unless one or both of them will hang up. If you try to hang up, voltage is
retained, and your phone will ring. That should give you an understanding of
how calling works, also. When electricity passes through a certain point on
your phone, the electricity causes a bell to ring or on some newer phones an
electronic ring to sound.)

 So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the voltage level
on your phone line. You should know that every time someone else picks up the
phone line, then the voltage does decrease a little. In the first steps of
planning this out. Once suggested getting about a hundred phones all hooked
into the same line that could all be taken off the hook at the same time.
That would greatly decrease the voltage level. That is also why most three-
way connections that are using the bell service three way calling (which is
only $3 a month) become quite faint after a while.

 By now, you should understand the basic idea. You have to drain all of the
power out of the line so the voltage can not be kept up. I rather sudden
draining of power could quickly short out the F.B.I. voltage machine, because
it was only built to sustain the exact voltage nessecary to keep the voltage
out.


NOTICE: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so don't go
        out and buy a new phone for it!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------
Using Switch #1
---------------

Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all...

DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! You will know this by,
the Phone rining and your 120 VAC lite syaying on and intermitingly flashing,
or your 120 VAC lite stays dimmly lit for more than 15 seconds. When the trace
has gone on, don't panic, switch #2 and #3 switch into the center off position
and switch #1 to the on position for the line that is being traced. The 100
watt lite bulb energy to turn itself on, and here's the source voltage,
and this will probably short the F.B.I. computer at the same time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------
Switch #2 and #3 explained.
---------------------------

Very simple. By switching the Switches you can change lines for either voice
or computer, or be on the same line with voice and computer, and still be
able to see if the other line is ringing or not.

Play with these yourself to see which is which line, and label with the
corrasponding phone number.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------
Switch #4 and #5 explained
--------------------------

Ok this is the switch that will shut off your carrier send, so that your
modem will 'hear' the carrier but not send one out. The reason for this?
well by useing 3 way calling, you cam hook up your hacker friend from his
house, to a computer/bbs and be able to turn you modem on and view all
of the data going across. Your modem will pick up both sides of the carriers,
and you can see all, but can not type yourself. This is what you use the other
phone line for, you can be on voice with your friend on one line and data
3 way on the other.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------
Switch #6 and #7 explained
--------------------------

Thes pair are great for you to set up a 'Mini Conference'. If you dont have
3 way calling, you can make your own by useing both lines. If you have 3 way
calling, you can put 2 persons on each line, and then connect them via a flip
of a switch (both #6 & #7).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------
About the 120 VAC lites
-----------------------

If you dont have a ringer hooked in to the line, you still can see a ring via
the lite. Also this lite will tell you when the line has cleared.

Durring a call comming in, the lite will flash brightly, then dim untill the
till the phone rings again. When you pick up the phone the lite will go off,
as soon as you hang up the lite will come on, then will go off when the line
clears, which is about 2 seconds. If you lite goes on when you hang up, then
you see it go off, then it flashes once, that means that the line was checked
durring your call, not nessarily a Tap, although it could have been, but
Quality monitored. If your lite does this flash each time you use the phone
then keep your dealings on the line clean, because your line is being
monitored (tapped). If so you have 2 Choices, either hide all your bad stuff
and keep you talks clean and you bbsing normal, but keep in mind that the
carrier can be viewed as I mentioned in Switch #4 & #5, by the Feds, Phone
Co. and your passes may be found out, so limit your bbsing too.
Or/and call your Phone Co. and complain, but make sure you hide this box,
because you dont want any extra questions, even though all the parts,
except Switch #1's set up is leagal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One last note. We have found that Bell's - Call Forwarding, 3-Way Calling,
and Speed Calling are the best 3 of the package.
With bridgeing Call Forwarding. Chaining 3-Way calling. Dialing you favorite
BBS in one touch or tone, etc....
