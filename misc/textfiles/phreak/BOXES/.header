<H1>Phone Phreaking : Boxes and Box Plans</H1>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most dominant trends in the area of Phone Phreaking was the
constant creation of "Boxes": Devices of all types and complexity that would do
a specific activity, usually illegal or potentially illegal. The first and
most famous of these was the Blue Box, which would simulate the tones generated
by an Operator from any phone, allowing the user to do an amazing variety of 
tricks and, occasionally, fraud.<P>

However, this box was quickly surrounded by every box color in the visible 
spectrum (and some beyond) as phreaks and phone hackers across the country
came up with odd new ideas of what to do with phones, and created electronic
plans to demonstrate to others how to build them. 
<P>
No doubt a major contributor to this unique situation was the romance of
creating an all-in-one, solid box that would do a magic trick on a phone
or phone line, giving the phone phreak a leg up against the phone company. 
As time went on, this idea of a magic box spread to other arenas, and there
are plans for television transmitters and traffic light hacks as well.

<P>To speed browsing, the supposed function of the box is included in italics
after the first set of plans for that color. This has nothing to do with
the plan's actual success at its goal or whether it even comes close.
In the case of multiple plans, no favoritism is being played as to which
plans are the first, second, etc. It's just how they came.
