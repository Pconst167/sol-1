Here is a list of all boxes that I have on file.  I only keep the most popular
boxes out because of storage limitations plus I must keep room for other
downloads.

On file as of 8/20/87 :
-----------------------
Blue Box      :: Uses trunk lines, 2600 tones (Bell is cracking down on it).  
Black Box     :: People can call long distance free to you
Red Box       :: Make coin tones for payphones.
Gold Box      :: Call other people's lines and receive their dial tone. 
Green Box     :: Hold Button (Best one I know of).
Blast Box I   :: Amplify your voice to blow eardrums of listeners.
Blast Box II  :: Blow up other people computers (Not on ESS, only x-bar).
Crystal Box   :: Hook up headphones for good recording of red box tones.
Record 'O Box :: Record tones and conversations directly from phone.
Light Box     :: Make LED's for on hook/off hook/ring/etc.
V-Box         :: Detect voltage changes in phone lines (used for taps, not
                 sure if it works on ESS).

Others not on download section, but can be requested:

White Box     :: Another hold button.
Clear Box     :: Free calls on pay-after-call payphones.
Music Box     :: Plays radio while person is on hold.    
Orange Box    :: Another hold button.
Dial Box      :: Box for making touch tones. 
Gray Box      :: Hook up neighbors line as your second line (good, but I only
                 have 3/4 of it. Someone find it and put the rest up).
Pink Box      :: Hold button with LED.
Opaque Box    :: Three way phone.
Power Box     :: Make your power meter run slower.
Busy Box      :: Make your phone busy, but you are able to call out.
Servo Box     :: Uses R/C car servos to change lines in poles outside of house. This is cool idea, but very expensive and hard to do.
Grey Box      :: A monitor.  You can hear them, but they can't hear you. Why
                 Grey and not Gray? Not really sure.
Yellow Box    :: Hold button/no LED.
Hold Box      :: Another hold button.
Hold On Box   :: Another hold button.
Three Box     :: Use 1 line, another line, or both...like a conference, but
                 better because it uses LEDS for which line you are on.
*Chrome Box   :: Make the traffic lights work for you.
*Neon Box     :: It's like a blast box II.
*Blotto Box   :: Blow up an area code (Doubt it works).
*Pandora's Box:: Make high pitched annoying tones.
*Tron Box     :: It's like power box.
*Magenta Box  :: Like a gold box but a lot better.
*Snow Box     :: Run a pirate TV station.
*Purple Box   :: A hold button w/LED.
*Ring/Busy Box:: Rings once, then emits a busy signal.
*Cheese Box   :: Make your phone a payphone.
*Lunch Box    :: AM transmittor.
*DayGlo Box   :: How to Beige Box, not really good. 

That is all I have as of 8/20/88.  For all you dorks that make hold buttons,
you are wasting your time plus all the colors for the boxes.  Oh yeah, there
is a beige box, but it's not really a box, you simply make a linesman handphone
and connect it up to other peoples lines.

Thanks to Master Assassin, Dead Monk, and Big Riot for getting these files
for me.  A good idea would now be to make up your own box and u/l it here...
but no hold buttons!

Addendum by Grave Digger 1/25/91:
I added a few boxes (they have *'s) that have come around since then, or I
never got a hold of. As the file mentions, don't make some stupid hold button,
make a new box.  Now that the phreaking scene is dying, we need new boxes to
revitalize interest!  Oh yeah, The Underground went down a while back, so
don't call the number.
