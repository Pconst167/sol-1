$   This file will explain the        $
$ construction, troubleshooting, and  $
$ adjustment of a Blue Box.           $
$                                     $
$                                     $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$                                     $
$   We all know that the touch tone   $
$ frequencies are composed of 2 tones $
$ (2 different freqs.) so that is the $
$ reason why we have 2 VCO's (Voltage $
$ Controlled Oscilators). We'll call  $
$ them VCO#1 and VCO#2. If you have   $
$ noticed VCO#1 and VCO#2 are exactly $
$ the same type of circuits. That is  $
$ why only 1 was drawn. But remember  $
$ that whatever goes for VCO#1 also   $
$ goes for VCO#2. Both VCO'S are      $
$ composed of a handfull of part. One $
$ chip, two capacitors, 2 resistors   $
$ and five potentiometers. All of     $
$ this will give you (when properly   $
$ calibrated) one of the freqencies   $
$ necessary (the other one will come  $
$ from VCO#2) for the operation of    $
$ the Blue Box. Both of these freqs.  $
$ will be mixed in the speaker to     $
$ form the required tone.             $
$                                     $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$                                     $
$   This is one of the most           $
$ sophisticated designs I have ever   $
$ made. Why?. Because other designs   $
$ will drain the battery after 10     $
$ calls. This design will make them   $
$ last 10 months!!!!!!. But never the $
$ less, don't forget to put in a      $
$ switch for on and off. Ok let's     $
$ build the two VCO'S and calibrate   $
$ the unit before we get to the       $
$ keyboard construction.              $
$                                     $

%         ! TROUBLE SHOOTING !        %
%         --------------------        %
%                                     %
%   By now you should have constructed%
% the two VCO'S on a bread board or   %
% anything that pleases you.          %
% Check for cold solder joints, broken%
% wires, polarity of the battery, etc.%
% Before we apply power to the VCO'S  %
% we have to adjust the pots for their%
% half way travel point. This is done %
% by turning them 21 turns to the     %
% right and then 10 turns to the left.%
% Do the same for all ten of them.    %
%                                     %
%-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-%
%                                     %
%   Now apply power to the unit check %
%  to see thaty you have power in the %
% chips by putting the positive lead  %
% of your volt meter on pin 7 and the %
% negative lead on pin 12. If you do  %
% not have anything there turn off    %
% the unit and RECHECK THE WIRING.    %
%                                     %
%-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-%
%                                     %
%   When you get the right voltages   %
% on the chips, connect a diode to a  %
% piece of wire (look at fig. 2 for   %
% the orientation of the diode) from  %
% ground to any pot at point T (look  %
% carefully at the schematic for      %
% point T it is labeled T1-T10 for    %
% all pots). You should be able to    %
% hear a tone, if not disconnect the  %
% lead and place the speaker close to %
% your ear and if you hear a          %
% chirp-like sound, this means that   %
% the two VCO'S are working if you    %
% don't, it means that either one or  %
% both of the VCO'S are dead. So in   %
% this case it is always good to have %
% an ocilloscope on hand.             %
% Disconnect the speaker from the     %
% circuit and hook the ocilliscope to %
% 1 of the leads of the speaker & the %
% ground from the scope to the ground %
% of the battery. Connect again the   %
% ground lead with the diode connected%
% to it from ground to any pot on the %
% VCO that you are checking and you   %
% should see a triangle wave if not   %
% turn the pot in which you are       %
% applying the ground to until you see%
% it. When you do see it do the the   %
% same for the other VCO to make sure %
% it is working. (amplitude is about  %
% 2VAC). When you get the two VCO's   %
% working you are set for the         %
% adjustment of the individuals pots. %
%                                     %
