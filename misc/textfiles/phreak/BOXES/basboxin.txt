  So you want to make free call without using codes eh?  In
this file I will explain a method used that does this.  It uses
the same tones basically as a blue box..and a similiar
technique.  There has been many other files like this but what
the hell...

US phone phreaking is done with a 2 out of 5 code.  The tones
must be with 30 Hz, and have less than 1 % distortion.

Master Tone Frequency = 2600 Hz >1 = 700 & 900 Hz
>2 = 700 & 1100 Hz
>3 = 900 & 1100 Hz
>4 = 700 & 1300 Hz
>5 = 900 & 1300 Hz
>6 = 1100 & 1300 Hz
>7 = 700 & 1500 Hz
>8 = 900 & 1500 Hz
>9 = 1100 & 1500 Hz
>0 = 1300 & 1500 Hz
>Start Key Signal = 1100 & 1700 >End Key Signal = 1300 & 1700

>Military Priority Keys
   11 = 700 & 1700 Hz
   12 = 1300 & 1700 Hz


The technique...
Make a long distance call to a number wich doesn't answer.
Send down the master tone. (2600 Hz)..This will clear the
line back, but you'll still be in the system.  Now send the
start Key Pulse followed by the Routing Codea and Subscriber
Code (No.)  Finish with the End Key Pulse.  The system sees
you as being a distant exchange requesting a route for a call.
Meanwhile..your local exchange will be logging you in as still
ringing te first call.

Warning:  Newer exchanges use filters and alarms..I don't
reccomend this on ESS..try it on a pay phone first.

e.g.-to call from US to the UK
>Fing toll free 800 number
>Send 2600 Hz Key Pulse
>When line goes dead your in trunk level..(yah)
>Start Pulse
>Number
>End Pulse



Newer systems are begging to make this method obselete..but
in some exchanges it may still work.  If not...there is always
LD codes....
