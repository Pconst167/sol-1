     FIRST OF ALL, I GIVE GREAT THANX TO THE WOLF FOR HIS HELP ON THIS FILE,
AND OF COURSE TO MAD MAX, FOR HIS DICTATION. OTHER THANX GOES TO:

NOW HERE ARE ALOT OF BOXES TO BE BUILT TO PHREAK OVER THE PHONE LINE AND
OTHER HANDY "RIP-OFF-THE-PHONE-COMPANY" BOXES.

BLACK BOX
=-------=

A BLACK BOX LETS A PERSON CALL YOU AND THEY DON'T GET CHARGED FOR IT. THIS IS
GREAT FOR CALLS THAT DON'T GO PAST A HALF AN HOUR. AFTER A HALF AN HOUR, THE 
PHONE COMPANY GETS SUSPICIOUS, AND THEN YOU CAN GUESS WHAT HAPPENS!

WHAT THIS BOX DOES IS KEEP THE LINE VOLTAGE FROM DROPPING BELOW 10 VOLTS WHEN
YOU ANSWER YOUR PHONE. THE LINE IS INSTEAD KEPT AT 36 VOLTS, AND SO THE PHONE
STILL THINKS IT IS RINGING WHILE YOU ARE TALKING. THE REASON THAT YOU SHOULD 
KEEP YOUR CALLS UNDER A HALF AN HOUR IS BECAUSE THE PHONE COMPANY WILL THINK
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR LINE, AND THEN THEY WILL INVESTIGATE.

ALL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE AT RADIO SHACK. THE MOST THAT THIS BOX WILL COST YOU 
IS $2.00 AT THE MOST. THERE ARE TWO SCHEMATICS FOR THIS BOX, ONE IS FOR
NORMAL PHONES, AND THE OTHER IS FOR PHONES THAT DON'T WORK WITH THE FIRST.

## SCHEMATIC 1 FOR MOST PHONES ##

PARTS:    1  1.8K 1/2 WATT RESISTOR
          1  1.5V LED
          1  SPST SWITCH

YOU MAY JUST HAVE TWO WIRES WHICH YOU CONNECT TOGETHER FOR THE SWITCH.

## SCHEMATIC 2 FOR ALL PHONES ##

PARTS: 1  1.8K 1/2 WATT RESISTOR
       1  1.5V LED
       1  DPST SWITCH

HERE IS THE PC BOARD THAT IS RECOMMENDED USING. IT IS EASY AND NEAT TO HOOK
UP.

*            *  N   E  *              *
**************  E      ****************

ONCE YOU HAVE HOOKED UP ALL THE PARTS, YOU MUST FIGURE OUT WHAT SET OF WIRES
GOTO THE LINE AND WHICH GOTO THE PHONE. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE
LEDS MUST BE PUT IN, IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOU PUT
THE LED IS WHAT CONTROLS WHAT WIRES FOR THE PHONE AND THE LINE.

HOOK UP THE BOX IN ONE DIRECTION USING ONE SET OF WIRES FOR LINE AND THE
OTHER FOR PHONE.

* NOTE *  FOR SCHEMATIC #1, THE SWITCH SHOULD BE OFF.

* NOTE *  FOR SCHEMATIC #2, THE SWITCH SHOULD BE SET TO THE SIDE CONNECTING
THE LED.

ONCE YOU HAVE HOOKED IT UP, THEN PICK UP THE PHONE AND SEE IF THE LED IS ON.
IF IT IS, THE LED WILL BE LIT. IF IT ISN'T THEN SWITCH THE WIRES AND TRY
AGAIN. ONCE YOU KNOW WHICH ARE WHICH THEN LABEL THEM. NOW LABEL THE SWITCH IN
ITS CURRENT POSITION AS BOX ON.

NOW, WHEN THE BOX IS ON, YOU CAN ONLY RECIEVE CALLS. THE PHONE WILL RING LIKE
NORMAL, AND THE LED WILL FLICKER ON AND OFF. WHEN YOU PICK UP THE PHONE THE
LED WILL STAY ON, AND YOU MAY TALK TO THE PERSON, EXCEPT THE PERSON WILL NOT
BE CHARGED FOR THE CALL. WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH THE CALL, HANG UP THE PHONE
AND TURN THE SWITCH TO THE OFF POSITION. IF IT IS ON, YOU WILL NOT GET A DIAL
TONE, AND YOU CAN NOT CALL OUT. ALSO, YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT ON IF MA BELL
CALLED!


BUD BOX
=-----=

THIS BOX IS RELATED TO THE BEIGE BOX, EXCEPT THIS IS A PORTABLE UNIT. IT IS
GREAT FOR MAKING FREE PHONE CALLS AND TAPPING A NEAR BY HOUSE'S LINE. IT'S
EASY TO MAKE, SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT (LIKE THE BLUE BOX!).

MATERIALS NEEDED:

2 ALLIGATOR CLIPS
1 PIECE PHONE OR NORMAL PHONE (ONE PIECE IS EASIER).
1 SOLDERING IRON
SOME SOLDER

CUT THE WIRE THAT CONNECTS THE PHONE TO THE WALL. INSIDE THERE SHOULD BE
COLORED WIRES: YELLOW, RED, GREEN, AND BLACK. IF THE WIRES AREN'T COLORED, NO
NEED TO GET HYPER, THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE ARE RED AND GREEN. THOSE ARE THE TWO
YOU NEED. MAKE SURE TO KEEP ABOUT 1-2 FEET OF THIS WIRE CONNECTED TO THE
PHONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE TXE OTHER WIRES LISTED ABOVE. NOW SOLDER ONE
ALLIGATOR CLIP TO THE GREEN WIRE, AND ONE TO THE RED. GO TO A NEAR BY HOUSE
AND LOCATE THE LITTLE GRAY BOX. IT'S SIMPLE TO FIND, LOOK BY THE GAS METER.
IT SHOULD HAVE THE BELL LOGO ON IT. TO OPEN IT, PUT YOUR HAND UNDERNEATH IT
AND PUSH UPWARDS. YOU SHOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF IT. NOW IT
SHOULD COME OFF NICE AND EASY. LOOK INSIDE AND YOU WILL SEE FIVE SCREWS IN
THIS PATTERN:

             *     *
                *

             *     *

THE SCREW IN THE MIDDLE AND THE TWO ON THE LEFT DO NOTHING (YOU MAY WANT TO
CHECK THE TWO ON THE LEFT, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A SECOND LINE HOOKED UP TO
THESE TWO). ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WORRY ABOUT THE TWO ON THE RIGHT. THE ONE
IN THE TOP RIGHT-HAND CORNER IS THE GREEN, AND THE ONE IN THE BOTTOM
RIGHT-HAND CORNER IS THE RED. CLIP AND ALLIGATOR CLIP TO THE RESPONDING
TERMINALS (RED TO RED AND GREEN TO GREEN). YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE. IF YOU
DON'T, SWITCH THE ALLIGATOR CLIPS AROUND. IF YOU STILL DON'T GET A DIAL TONE
(OR SOMEONES CONVERSATION!), THE LINE IS DISCONNECTED OR THE PHONE IS OFF THE
HOOK.

TO USE THE BUD BOX, JUST MAKE YOUR CALL, OR LISTEN TO THE LINE AND SCREW
AROUND. THE BILL WILL BE CHARGED TO THE PEOPLE WHOS LINE YOU ARE USING.


SCARLET BOX
=---------=

THE PURPOSE OF THE SCARLET BOX IS TO CREATE A VERY BAD CONNECTION. IT CAN BE
USED TO CRASH A BBS, OR TO MAKE LIFE MISERABLE FOR THOSE YOU AVENGE.

MATERIALS:

2 ALLIGATOR CLIPS
3 INCH WIRE OR A RESISTOR

1. FIND THE PHONE BOX AT YOUR VICTIM'S HOUSE, AND POP THE COVER OFF.

2. FIND THE TWO PRONGS THAT THE PHONE LINE YOU WISH TO "STATICIZE" ARE
CONNECTED TO.

3. HOOK THE ALIGATOR CLIPS TO YOUR RESISTOR/WIRE.

4. FIND THE LOWER MIDDLE PRONG AND TAKE OFF ALL WIRES CONNECTED TO IT.

5. NOW TAKE ONE OF THE ALLIGATOR CLIPS AND ATTACH IT TO THE UPPER MOST PRONG,
AND TAKE THE OTHER AND ATTACH IT TO THE LOWER MIDDLE PRONG.

6. NOW PUT THE COVER BACK ON THE BOX, AND RUN LIKE HELL (OR TO HELL IF YOU
WANT)!

HERE IS WHAT THE PHONE BOX SHOULD LOOK LIKE AFTER YOU ARE THROUGH:

          ##               ##
          ##               ##

                          /

IN THE LAST FILE, YOU WERE SHOWN HOW TO MAKE THE BLACK BOX, BUD BOX, AND THE
SCARLET BOX. HERE ARE SOME MORE BOXES YOU CAN MAKE TO RIP OF THE FONE CO.

GOLD BOX
=------=

YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS: (2) 10K OHM AND (3) 1.4K OHM RESISTORS,
(2) 2N3904 TRANSISTORS, (2) PHOTOCELLS, (2) RED LEDS, A BOX THAT WILL NOT LET
LIGHT IN, AND RED AND GREEN WIRE.

LIGHT FROM THE #1 LED MUST SHINE DIRECTLY ON THE PHOTOCELL #1. HERE IS THE
SCHEMATIC FOR THE GOLD BOX:

            1
       :-PHOTOCELL--:
       :            :

          LED     10K    10K   1.4K 1.4K
                    RESISTORS

               2
          -PHOTOCELL-----------------
          :                         :
          :BASE                     :
        TTTTT                       :
        TRANSISTOR                  :
        TTTTT                       :
         : :EMITTER                 :
   GREEN1- --------------------------RED2
        :   :
        /+/+/
         1.4K

THE 1.4K RESISTOR IS VARIABLE AND IF THE SECOND PART OF THE GOLD BOX IS
SKIPPED IT WILL STILL WORK, BUT WHEN SOMEONE PICKS UP THE PHONE THEY WILL HEAR
A FAINT DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT REPORT IT TO THE FONE CO. 1.4K
WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH LITTLE RISK OF A BELL AGENT AT YOUR DOOR.

NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT THE GOLD BOX, TAKE TWO GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENGTH,
AND STRIP THE ENDS. TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONNECT THEM TO GREEN1 AND
PLACE A PIECE OF TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 RIDING ON IT. CONTINUE THE PROCESS 
WITH THE RED1, ONLY USE RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH GREEN2 AND RED2, BUT CONNECT
IT TO LINE #2.

TO INSTALL YOUR NEW FOUND FRIEND, YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINES THAT
ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL ONE OF THE PHONE LINES LINE #1. CUT THE PHONE LINES
AND TAKE OUT THE OUTER COUTING OFF IT. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES. CUT THE YELLOW
AND BLACK WIRES OFF AND STRIP THE RED AND GREEN WIRES FOR BOTH FONE LINES.

LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PIECES. TAKE THE GREEN WIRE OFF ONE END AND CONNECT
IT TO THE ONE ONE THE GOLD BOX. TAKE THE OTHER HALF OF LINE #1 AND HOOK THE
FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE GREEN WIRE ON THE FONE LINE. REPEAT THE PROCESS WITH
RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS GO HOME AND PHONE THE HOUSE YOU PUT THE GOLD BOX ON.
YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE! YOU HAVE SEIZED THEIR LINE FROM A REMOTE LOCATION.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR BELL TO TRACE YOU. THEY WILL TRACE THE PEOPLE WHO'S FONE
YOU ARE USING!

SILVER BOX
=--------=

YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS:

(1) BLUE WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT
(1) GRAY WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT
(1) BROWN WIRE ABOUT 1 FOOT
(1) SPDT SWITCH (SMALLER THE BETTER)
(1) STANDARD BELL FONE (YUCK!)
(1) SOLDERING IRON AND SOLDER
(1) FLAT TIP SCREWDRIVER

HERE IS WHAT TO DO...

1 - TAKE THE CASING OFF YOUR PHONE BY LOOSENING THE TWO SCREWS UNDER IT. DON'T
REMOVE THEM FULLY.

2 - LOOSEN THE SCREWS ON THE SIDE OF THE TOUCH TONE KEYPAD. CAREFULLY REMOVE
THE TOUCH TONE PAD FROM THE MOUNTING BRACKET.

3 - YOU WILL NOTICE A PLASTIC COVER ON THE PAD. SEPERATE THE TWO HALVES AND
GET THEM OUT OF YOUR WAY, BUT DON'T DESTROY THEM, YOU WILL NEED THEM LATER.

4 - NOW LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE PAD SO THE 123 ROW IS FACING AWAY AND THE *0#
ROW IS TOWARD YOU. TURN OVER THE KEYPAD. YOU SHOULD SEE A MASS OF WIRES, GOLD
PLATED CONTACTS, DISCRETE COMPONENTS, AND TWO LARGE DOUGHNUT SHAPED BLACK
THINGIES. THESE ARE THE COILS THAT MAKE THE TOUCH TONE FREQUENCIES. ALL YOU
ARE GOING TO DO IS CONNECT WIRES THAT MA BELL "FORGOT" TO DO. (HEH HEH).

5 - LOOK AT THE COIL ON THE LEFT (WITH FIVE SOLDER CONTACTS FACING YOU, RATHER
THEN BEING PERPENDICULAR TO YOU). COUNT OVER 4 CONTACTS FROM THE LEFT (OR TWO
CONTACTS FROM THE RIGHT) AND SOLDER THE GRAY WIRE TO THE FOURTH POST ON THE
LEFT.

6 - SOLDER THE OTHER END OF THE GRAY WIRE TO THE LEFT POLE OF THE SPDT SWITCH.

7 - TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE PAD. YOU SHOULD SEE A ROW OF THREE
GOLD PLATED CONTACTS. LOOK AT THE ONE ON THE LEF4AND GENTLY SEPDRATE THE TWO
TOUAHINE CNNNECTORS ADD STTHEM APART.

8 - SOLDER THE BROWN WIRE TO THE TOP CONTACT, AND SOLDER IT TO THE RIGHT POLE
OF THE SPDT SWITCH.

9 - NOW TAKE THE BLUE WIRE AND SOLDER IT TO THE BOTTOM CONTACT. SOLDER THE
OTHER END OF THIS WIRE TO THE CENTER POLE OF THE SPDT SWITCH.

10 - NOW PUT THE PHONE BACK TOGETHER, TIGHTENING THE SCREWS THAT YOU LOOSENED.

NOW (FINALLY) WHEN YOU HAVE THE SWITCH IN THE ON POSITION YOU WILL HAVE A 
NORMAL FONE, AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN THE OFF POSITION, THE 3, 6, 9, AND # KEYS
, WHICH ARE NOW A, B, C, AND D KEYS, WILL PRODUCE THE SILVER BOX TONES!

PURPLE BOX
=--------=

MATERIALS YOU WILL NEED:

(1) SPDT SWITCH
(1) BLUE WIRE
(1) SOLDERING IRON

THIS IS AN EASY BOX. THIS MAKES A FAKE CALL FORWARDING SERVICE WITHOUT PAYING
FOR IT. 

1 - TAKE YOUR FONE APART.

2 - LOOK FOR THE RED WIRE LEADING FROM THE CIRCUIT BOARD.


3 - SOLDER THE BLUE WIRE TO THE CENTER POLE OF THE SPDT SWITCH.

4 - NOW CONNECT THE SWITCH (WITH THE WIRE) TO THE RED WIRE (AFTER YOU HAVE
SPLICED IT!).

NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THE SWITCH IN THE ON POSITION AND YOU ARE TALKING TO SOMEONE
BUT YOU ARE EXPECTING AN IMPORTANT CALL, YOU CAN STILL TALK BECAUSE IF YOU
GET A CALL WHILE YOU ARE TALKING, THE LINE WILL GO FUZZY. FLICK THE SWITCH AND
YOU CAN TALK TO THE OTHER PERSON, BUT YOU WILL HANG UP ON THE OTHER PERSON.

OH WELL, LIFE IS A BITCH!

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

WELL, THAT IS IT FOR THIS FILE. MAYBE I WILL WORK ON #3 SOMETIME. ANYWAYS, I
HOPE THIS HELPS YOU FUCK A FEW PEOPLE AND HELP YOURSELF.
