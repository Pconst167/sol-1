List of Bits
============

S1 - SPST (Toggle Switch !!) 
D1 - 50-200 volt diode (IN400x range)
D2 - Standard LED  (Red is nice !!)
R1 - 6.1K Resistor
C1 - 1uf Non polar capcitor

Notes
=====

(The diodes are positioned as follows)

D1    ------->!-------
D2    -------!<-------

Theory
======

When a phone is answered there is normally approx 100MA DC 
loop current but only 80MA or so is necessary to polarise the 
mic element.

R1 Limits the Loop Current
C1 Ensures speech is unaffected
S1 Is used to turn the circiut off/on
   for outgoing calls or for Operator     
   Calls etc
D1 Tells you its working

Practice
========
Leave switch off till you hear it ringing, then switch the 
circuit on.
Basically it just fools the Telephone system into thinking that 
you have put the phone down. Also if you leave it on all the 
time incoming calls are not charged.

Snags
=====
Have fun,but remember it works for local calls only. Long distance 
calls will be disconnected after 3 mins..

Q. What have Flamingo's and BT got in
   common ?
A. They can both stuff there Bills up
