                                 The Blast Box



      Ever want to really make yourself be heard?  Ever talk to someone on the
      phone who just doesn't shut up?  Or just call the operator and pop her
      eardrum?  Well, up until recently it has been impossible for you to do
      these things.  That is, unless of course you've got a blast box.  All a
      blast box is, is a really cheap amplifier, (around 5 watts or so)
      connected in place of the microphone on your telephone.  It works best
      on model 500 AT&T Phones, and if constructed small enough, can be placed
      inside the phone.

                                     Usage

      Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use
      the microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and
      presto.  There it is.  Now, believe it or not, this device actually
      works.  (At least on crossbar.)  It seems that illinois bell switching
      systems allow quite a lot of current to pass right through the switching
      office, and out to whoever you're calling.  When you talk in the phone,
      it comes out of the other phone (again it works best if the phone that
      you're calling has the standard western electric earpiece) incredibly
      loud.  This device is especially good for PBS Subscription drives.
