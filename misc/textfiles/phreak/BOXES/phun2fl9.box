                    WRITTEN FOR THE P/HUN ONLINE MAGAZINE
                    :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BASIC ELECTRONIC KNOWLEDGE IS ASSUMED:
WHY SPEND 200$ DOLLARS ON A ANSWERING MACHINE WHILE YOU CAN SPEND JUST A DOLLAR
ON PARTS TO MAKE YOUR OWN .HAVE I CAUGHT YOUR INTREST YET?
THIS SMALL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WILL CONVERT YOUR TAPE RECORDER INTO A FULLY
AUTOMATIC RECORDING MACHINE.THIS HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A SUCH A WAY THAT
NO EXTERNAL POWER WILL BE NEEDED.LETS SAY SOMEONE PICKS UP THE PHONE TO DIAL
OR WHEN THERES INCOMING CALLS.THIS GADJET WILL ALLOW AUTOMATIC RECORDING TO
START BOTH WAYS AND WHEN YOU HANG UP IT STOPS.NO MODIFICATION OF THE PHONE OR
THE TAPE RECORDER IS NECCESSARY.SIMPLY CONNECT TWO WIRES TO A TELEPHONE JACK
OR ANYWHERE ELSE ACROSS YOUR TWO TELEPHONE WIRES.
THIS GADJET PLUGS IN TO THE TAPE RECORDER WHERE THE MICROPHONE USUALLY GOES.

                          HOW IT WORKS
                          ::::::::::::

                   REFER TO THE SCHEMATIC BELOW

WITH THE SWITCH TERNINALS OF YOUR TAPE RECORDER "OPEN",YOU CAN MEASURE A
VOLTAGE ACROSS THEM THAT IS EQUAL TO THE DC VOL. USED TO OPERATE THE MACHINE.
THIS IS USUALLY AROUD 6V.IF WE APPLY THIS READILY AVAILABLEVOL. TO A PAIR OF
DARLINGTON-CONNECTED TRASISTORS,Q1 AND Q2,THEY WILL TURN ON AND START THE
TAPE RECORDER. TO TURN THE TRANSISTORS OFF,AND THEREBY STOP THE MACHINE,WE
HAVE TO APPLY A NEAGATIVE VOL. TO THE BASE TO THE Q1 TRANSITOR.THIS IS DONE BY
THE VOL. FROM THE TELEPHONE LINE.
WHEN THE TELEPHONE LINE IS ON HOOK THERES 48 VOL DC.THIS WVOLTAGE IS DIVIDED
ACROSS R1,R2 AND R4 RESISTORS IN WAY THAT ALLOWS THE BASE TO Q1 TO BE NEGATIVLY
BASED THEREFORE KEEPING THE RECORDER OFF.ALSO WHEN THE PHONE IS PICKED UP
THE VOLTAGE IS ABOUT 12 VOLTS WHICH LEAVES ENOUGH WONT KEEP THE Q1 BASE
NEGATIVE TO KEEP IT CUT OFF, SO THE TAPE RECORDER STARTS.SIMPLE HUH?

                          CONSTRUCTION
                          ::::::::::::

WHAT WORKS THE BEST AS A CASING FOR THIS EQIPMENT IS A FLORECENT STARTER
HOUSING.THIS WILL FIT THE 2 TRANSISTORS,THE DIODE,4 RESISTORS AND THE COUPLING
CAPACITOR BUT THE CONTAINMENT IS UP TO YOU.
REMOVE AND DISCARD TEH STARTER ELEMENT,BUT SAVE THE BAKELITE BASE FOR USE AS
A CONVENIENT TERMINAL BOARD FOR ALL COMPONENTS.THIS BEST WAY TO DO BUILD THIS
(IF BUILDING IN A FLORECENT STARTER) IS TO USE POINT TO POINT WIRING BECAUSE
IT WILL REDUCE THE SIZE.INVERT THE BASE SO THAT THE BRASS TERMINALS ARE INSIDE
WHICH WILL MAKE WIRING EASY.THE RUBBERY MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM WILL PROTECT THE
THE WIRES TO THE TAPRE RECORDER.THE WIRES TO THE PHONE JACK CAN DIRECTLY BE
SOLDERED TO THE TERMINAL OR WHAT I PREFER TO DO IS WHICH IS VERY CONVENIENT
IS JUST DRILL 2 HOLES IN THE COVER AND INSERT THEM.

      INSTALLATION AND USE
      ::::::::::::::::::::

PLUG THIS GADJET INTOT HE PROPER TAPE RECORDER JACKS AND SET THE MACHINE
TO PLAYBACK.WITHOUT THE GADJET NOT CONNECTED TO THE PHONE LINE,THE TAPE
RECORDER SHOULD START.IF IT DOESNT THEN THE WIRES THAT GOTO THE TAPE R. REMOTE
ARE REVERSED.
NOW THAT THE MACHINE IS PLAYING WITH THE GADJET PLUGGED IN,CONNECT THE 2 WIRES
TO THE PHONE LINE.WITH THE PHONE ON HOOK,TAPE RECORDER SHOULD STOP.IF IT DOESNT
REVERSE 2 WIRES WHICH GO TO TEL.(TELEPHONE). O.K THE TAPE RECODER HAS STOPPED,
NOW CHECK TO SEE WEATHER THE RECODER STARTS BY LIFITING UP THE HANDSET.
TO SET UP FOR RECORDING JUST PRESS THE FOWARD AND RECORD BUTTON ON THE TAPE
RECORDER.

OTHER THINGS CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH THIS . I WILL LEAVE THAT TO YOUR IMAGINATION

I WILL WRITE AN ARTICLE ON HOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE BUG IN P/HUN #3.
