   The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad conection, it
can be used to crash a BBS or just make life miserable for those you
seek to avenge.
 
 
materials: 2 aligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister
(plane wire will create greatest amount of static)
 
(Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to the
resister you are useing)
 
 
Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover 
off.
 
Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to box are 
connected too.
 
Step (3): Hook your aligator clips to your (wire/resister).
 
Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires connected 
to it, i think this disables the gound and call waiting and shit like 
that.
 
Step (5): Now take one of the aligator clips and attach it to the upper 
most prong, and take the other and attach it to the lower middle prong.
 
Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!
