              COMPUTER SYSTEM ID AND PASSWORD SECURITY ALERT
***************************************************************************
 
     Unidentified individuals representing themselves to be from a
number of US Sprint departments (corporate security, a technical support
group, a systems engineer abd others) are calling Sprint and Sprint
International employees in an attempt to obtain employees' individual IDs
and passwords.  These unidentified individuals state that they are
troubleshooting a problem with a system and need the employee's ID and
password to verify proper operation of the system.  According to Cliff
Hall, senior vice president of information management, an ID and password
for a Sprint International system was obtained in this manner, and the
system was penetrated.
     Under no circumstances should an employee give his or her ID or
password to any individual, including another employee.  If anyone contacts
you and asks for your ID or password, ask for the name and phone number of
the person requesting the information, then notify your director of the
request.  If you have inadvertently given out your ID or password,
immediately notify your director and contact the administrator for the
system in question so your access parameters can be changed.  All requests
and inadvertent disclosures should also be reported to corporate security,
1-800-xxx-xxxx
     The protection of IDs and passwords is in accordance with US Sprint's
Executive Policy No. 9.9 and Addenda thereto.  IDs and passwords are
considered proprietary information and must be protected at all times.
