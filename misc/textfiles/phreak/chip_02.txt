Hi-?!
   Issue two already! I just finised #-01 about a week ago, and already I feel
I have enough text & information of interest to warrant a quick follow-up to
#-01!  ....so here it is, #-02! I hope #-01 has provided those who have read it,
something to think about and/or "work on". If not, well then perhaps this one
will. If not, then perhaps a monastery or convent would be a better place for
the likes of you!!

Intro:

Below are as many BIN's as I could round up. Each one is listed according to
the Banks ID No. (BIN) - which are the first 6 nos. of a CC. (Credit Card).
Of course, the first no. indicates a Visa (4) or a Mastercard (5). Bin's aren't
all that important to know, but can be if you NEED to know the name of a bank
that issued the CC no. you have.

So FYI and bemusement, here's that information-

B> - Authorization Centers - ("AC")

Intro:  Authorization Centers are located throughout the country and are in just
about every financial institution that is involved in the distribution and/or
issuance of credit cards. Of course, Visa and M/C have some as well.

   Citibank, First Interstate Bank and Bank of America all have their own AC's
available to their merchants. There are however many other AC's that provide the
same types of services to their merchants. It is the merchant who is 'really'
providing the services though. It is the merchants responsibility in most cases
to determine that a credit card is valid. On top of that they are also even
offered a whole $50 if they assist in the conviction of anyone suspected of
using a stolen/forged card. $50!! Hardly worth it, so most don't even try....

   One of the quickest ways a card is checked is by accessing an AC through a
card reader. Verifone is perhaps the largest mfg. of these devices, which are
used by most retail stores or restaurants for CC verifications.

   The telephone no. that is called using one of these card readers is the
first one in which I've listed below. You can also log onto this "carrier" via a
a modem, but I've yet to figure out what the necessary input is to utilize this
service on my computer. A touch tone phone suffices however, and the required
input is listed below for using this particular AC (Authorization Center).

   One other thing to note here is that whenever you are at a store/merchant
and using a shady (at best) card, be especially alert to the merchant and/or
cashier when they are getting verification of the transaction. If they use
the telephone and voice in the request for the authorization, then listen
for "Code-10", and if you hear them say this at any time- GET THE HECK OUT!!

   If they use a card reader for the transaction and get something like "CALL
CENTER" on the read out, then remain calm and ask what the problem is, and if
at anytime they are out of sight or on the phone with the center for
any prolonged amount of time, then again- GET OUT OF THERE!!

   A "code-10" is a merchant's signal to an authorization center that they are
suspicious of the card user. If you are using an AMEX, then run out of there
twice as fast, because AMEX calls the police from their authorization center.
V/MC don't usually call the police, but AMEX will use stall tactics while the
police are on the way. (One way is to ask to speak with you and then ask you
some rather lengthy detailed questions, like primary cardholders name, SSN &
Mother's Maiden). You can always just look out the window and exclaim, "Hey!
someone's stealing/towing my car!" and then leave pronto!....

** Use the following telephone nos. before going into ANY store to use a card.
They are worth the extra minute or so to be sure that the card is still valid!

    just above the merchants name.)

 2>.
    800/228-2211 = This is the voice authorization number of the same group
    who operate the one above. I am fairly sure that these two are operated by
    M/C and Visa, and I do know that the merchant nos. that work on one, also
    work on the other.  This AC, is also useful for obtaining a BIN no., and/or
    the issuing bank of a particular credit card. Just ask the verification op.
    for merchant services and she will connect you to their information dept.

   Glossary of terms used in the preceding text file.

 - Authorization Center <AC> = Voice and/or Data terminal which gives merchants
   varying "approval codes" on purchase requests. Some also provide info such as
   BIN No. and Bank Name of a particular card.

 - Bank Identification Number <BIN> = Issuing bank's identifier. This number is
   assigned by the FDIC, I think. The No. can be found on Visa's (unraised)
   just above the CC number. Some larger banks will have several BIN's, because
   they own several smaller financial institutions that issue credit.
   Choice Visa is one example. They are owned by Citibank, but have there own
   seperate BIN. Another example is First Card, which handles Home Fed Savings
   credit accounts.

 - International Bank Number <IBN> = Bank Identifier on a national level. The
   number is used by various merchants to verify/approve a cardholder when they
   have placed a telephone or mailorder request. It is the 4 digit no. just
   above the persons name, and is only found on M/C's (raised, 'usually' starts
   with a 1,6,7 or 8) & on Amex cards (unraised, usually starting with a 6).
   Though not an absolute, experience has shown that IBN's starting with 6,7 or
   an 8, are usually preferred accounts. IBN's that begin with a 1 or 2 are
   usually found on classic accounts.  (see list above)

 - CV = Classic Account; -these two letters can be found on most Visa cards
   that are "Classic Accounts". They usually have a credit limit of some-
   where between $500 to $5000+, though some can go up to $10,000 for long term
   customers.

 - PV = Preferred Acct. or "Gold Card"; -usually limits of 5,000-10,000+. These
   cards are 'usually' found on Gold or 'preferred Visa Cards, and are worth
   their weight in 'gold' as well.... Some can go up to $40,000 or more!!

  ++Any additional articles or noteworthy texts to be submitted for inclusion
in the future issues of *CHIP*, should include a handle &/or method of contact
for the author. Though not required, this will help in verifying the info &
assure a timely publish date.

  Our method of contact is simple. Call 800-755-3493, press 9657 before end of
greeting and give us some idea of what you know or have access to and we will
consider your request. The only other method we feel safe with is via a typed
letter sent to: *JC/CA* 15445 Ventura Blvd. #128; Sherman Oaks, CA 91403. We
need more up to date H/P info since this is not our best subject and since
there are many others more knowledgable in this field than we are... So let us
know!  ...Otherwise we may change *CHIP* to CIA! & become Anarchist!... then
again, it's probably too late for that, since we do as we want anywayz..-JC/CA>.

I - IDENTITIES


Intro:

DMVRULES.TXT

What the DMV would rather you DIDN'T know:
<from the Standard Operating Procedures - SOP of the DMV/CA.> 10-01-90

13.301a:
    "...If the applicant is unable to provide a signature within the margin, the
application should nevertheless be accepted, and there is NO need to prepare
another application..."

13.301b:
   ..."Usual signature" means the signature the applicant uses when signing
letters, "checks", etc. It need not correspond exactly to the full name as shown
at the top of the application or photo document & and in fact, seldom will. If
the signature includes a nickname not shown in the full name, or if it differs a
lot from the full name, the employee should indicate "usual signature" in the
space at the top of application.

13.301c: ***important***
   If the applicant's, "usual signature" is "printed", it should be ACCEPTED on
the application.

13.307:  Birth Date Verification

    Any Driver license showing birth date is acceptable in lieu of a birth
certificate (bc). If the bc is unobtainable, certain other documents may be
accepted in lieu of the bc. The acceptability of other documents should "NOT BE
DESCRIBED TO THE APPLICANT" until it is reasonably ascertained that their birth
record is unobtainable.

The following ARE accepted forms of identification as listed in the
DMV Employees Driver License Tech. Manual:
<<< in order of preference.... their preference, of course! >>>

1>.  Birth Certificate or any "certified Birth Record/Registration".
2>.  Driver License, from CA. or an ID card issued by the State of CA.
3>.  All other state Drivers licenses, Id cards, to include Military too
4>.  Any foreign governments D/L and/or ID. Must have DOB listed on it.
5>.  Passports, Visas, immigration/alien docs or reg. cards. w/ DOB.
6>.  Dept.  of Corrections or Youth Authority docs, signed by PA/CS/CAS.
7>.  Driver Education driving permits & training certificates, w/ DOB's.
8>.  Out of State ID cards -NOT necessarily issued by the state's DMV.
9>.  US Census Records.  Auth. by 13007.5 VC; ** contact Census Bureau **
10>. School Cerification (form dl-48); used ONLY when all other forms of Proof
     of ID have been exausted; *contact any local school to get rcrds*. This
     is also an accepted form of ID for SSA (Social Security Administration).

** Note:
   Tax forms are not accepted with any degree of certainty by the DMV.  It's
always best to use what they see "thousands of time a day", since these docs
are usually less scrutinized.

   If you have trouble getting the above docs, then just go to Nevada.  In NV
they take almost every Type of ID known in the US. Included in what they will
accept are W-2 tax forms & 1099 gift-tax forms. Armed with one of these and a
baptismal certificate you can get a NV ID/DL with no problem, and on the same
day as well. NV is one of the few states that accept Baptismal Certificates.
.... and Just'in Case you ddidn't know that, Bap. Certs. can be found at most
at most religious bookstores & supply stores, especially Catholic.

   An added bonus is that they DO NOT fingerprint in NV. You also have the
option of having your ssn imprinted on the ID card, which is helpful for back-
up ID. You just tell them your ssn and they'll include it. One bad thing is
that there is no Exp. date on their ID cards, however there Driver Lic's. do
have exp. date's and are worth the extra "drive" around the city to get. The
best days to go are on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.
  ***Now here are a few additional points of interest to note for the heck of
it, so here goes....

     *= THE =*
**- APPLICATION -**

II.> Driver Information and the Application.

   Quickly, there are 5 types of forms used by the DMV in processing such re-
quests as DL, ID, Replacement (of either), Computer paper & the renewal appli-
cation form (DL-1RN). BTW, according to this doc that I am sorta copying, it
says that the renewal process will and is being phased out with "the new system
now being installed". *CA has seen perhaps the very first of this 'new' system.*

13.011
   Every applicant for an original, or renewal, driver license whose form DL-44
indicates previous driving experience, but who does not indicate or produce a
previous license, should be asked whether he/she holds a regular license from
California or any other state or country. The reason for the inquiry (Sec-12511
& 12518vc) should be "politely" explained. Instruction or learner's permit &
"International Drivers Licenses" are not considered to be regular licenses. If
an applicant over the age of 18 cannot produce a valid or recently (within one
year) expired foreign license, a check by H-6 inquiry <?> to the automated sys.
or Wats Line must be made prior to processing of the application.

+++H-6 inquiry to automated sys OR WATS line sounds like a hacking adventure!..
Anyone with info on this possibility please fill us in at 800/755-3493 x-9657.

Intro:

 950XXXX.LST
    Here is a current list of operating L/D Co's, which provide access to
telco. lines across our fine country (ha!)... Of course what makes it so fine
is that with each of these L/D carriers, there is a code that is entered to be
able to access the fine features of each of these fine L/D service providers.

    So someday with nothing better to do, give 'em a try and try out different
access code numbers (randomly), and hopefully you'll be able to make FREE phone
calls in no time. Don't abuse it however, because they do tend to monitor any
high usage on these numbers.

*** also worth noting here is that AT&T has a rather interesting 950 number.
It is 950-1288 (1ATT)! It is a carrier (modem) and runs up to 9600 baud, and
is 8N1. Try it out- it ain't easy neither!...

This concludes this segment of the usually unusual ramblings of JC's CHIP
series. As always it has been real cool, sorta fun and never boring. I hope
this file, like no. 01 will help you in the future and provide a bit of pre-
ventive info to keep your asses out of jail... and on that note I say goodbye
until #03, due out sometime around Jan. 01, 1992.- Goodbye,   JC.- JC/CA>.
