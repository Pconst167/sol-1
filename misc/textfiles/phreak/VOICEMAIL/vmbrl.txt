VMB (Voice Mail Box) Hacking
----------------------------

Written By:  The Knight



Ok, Here's the deal. VMB Hacking Is not a HUGE deal and there really isn't
a great deal of 'hidden info' that isn't common sense. But, If you are out
there trying to hack a box and can't, follow through the VERY logical and
simple steps and make sure they are matching up.


Step 1:

Finding a VMB System

There are many ways you can find a VMB system, for instance, on a BBS when
someone says 'Here are some systems' usually thats what they're referring
to. Also, Try setting up your scanner and listening for 'Welcome to XX
company, Enter extension #' or something similar to that. Then you have
found a VMB system.


Step 2:

Finding a Box

This is the part where most IDIOTS fuck up. You can NOT just take ANY box.
You must make sure that no one is using it. There are several ways to do
this. One EASY way is when you hack it, check the date on the latest
messages, if they are OVER a month old, then I'd say your safe to use them.
Also, watch in case there is just like _2_ messages in there from the last
4 months that those messages could be messages sent to ALL the boxes, see if
they sound personal. If they DON'T, then grab the box.

Let's say there's a box you REALLY want bad and someone's using it regularly,
try doing this: Go in twice a day (make SURE you DON'T change the greeting
etc.) and erase all the messages. He will complain and will eventually move
out of the box. Then there is a good chance of you having that box. It's
happned to me.


Step 3:
                       
Hacking the VMB

This is the most SIMPLE part of all. MY general method is as follows:

Find a box, let's say box 260. It's empty and I want it (obviously).
First, try passcode '000', if that doesn't work, try passcode '260',
just make very general guesses that's ALL. Some of the MOST Common passcodes
are:

3 digit boxes:
000
123
111
222
333
444
555
666
777
888
999
box # (say it's box 260, passcode: 260)
321
                       
4 digit boxes:

1234
0000
1111
2222
3333
4444
5555
6666
7777
8888
9999
box # (Say its box 1200, try passcode: 1200)


The Key: REALLY try ALL of those. I knew one system with a passcode of
         '5555' and NO ONE could hack it. And I did. So don't give up.
         UNLESS you've exhausted all of those possibilities. Then forget
         it.

That's it really. The most simple thing to do. Just remember not to
give up before you should and also try 3 digit passcodes on 4 digit
boxes. Also, once you get in for added security, a lot of these boxes
allow more digits for passcodes, so make a 5 digit passcode. Or if you
think it's worth it, try like '00000' so that's really about all.

Have fun and don't stop.
