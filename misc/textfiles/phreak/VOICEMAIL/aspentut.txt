Intro:
	Well you may be thinking that, Oh! yes I've read tutorials
	before and they are about as helpful as a dead parrot.....
	I thought it was about time to write a little series of
	textfiles on how to use (and abuse) Mailbox systems.
	This series will NOT just cover Hacking and scanning of mail
	systems but also the facilities used on each................

Start:
	O.K. After recently coming across an ASPEN system which I
	successfully managed to hack a couple of mailboxes for my
	personal use, I didn't realise all the many facilities 
	available to the (Ab)user. I have collated the following
	information myself I hope it will be of some help to U.

	Assuming that you already have a mailbox on the system:
	
	When Entering your mailbox number and passcode the system
	will tell you if you have any new (or saved) messages.
	Let's assume you have ONE new message.

	You may select the following options:

	Push:
	-----	1 - Recieve Messages
		2 - Send a message
		3 - Check Reciept
		4 - Personal Options

Option chosen:
--------------

1:
""	Whilst message is playing you have a sub-menu of options.

	 1: Rewind Message Ten Seconds
	11: Rewind To Start Of Message
	 2: Pause Message (Press Again To Unpause)
	 3: Fast Forward Message Ten seconds
	33: Fast Forward To End Of Message
	 
	 4: Decrease Playing Speed (Slow Down)
	 6: Increase Playing Speed (Speed Up)

	 8: Decrease Volume
	 9: Increase Volume

	After listening to the message you may select one of these.

	 4: Replay Message
	 5: Envelope Message (Find Source Mailbox+Time+Date+Length)
	 6: Send On Message To Another Subscriber - Record Intro Msg.
	 7: ERASE Message
	 8: Reply To Message
	 9: Save Message In Archives (For Later Listening)

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

2:
""	Send a Message will ask you to speak whilst it records you.

	Press # to stop recording then enter Destination Mailbox.

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

3:
""	Check reciept of messages sent.

	This will allowyou to check if a message has been read and
	also if a message has been saved. 
	There are other uses for this function (See L8ter)

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

4:
""	Personal Options. Good fun can be had by all !!

	1: Change Your Passwords
        ------------------------

	This Section Refers To Guest Box Control.
	If you are Strapped for boxes then you can assign
	Guest Boxes so you can send messages to each other even
	if One person doesn't have a mailbox.

	2: Change Your Greetings
        ------------------------

		 you mail will hear.

		 people leaving messages will be alerted that
		 you may not be back for some time.

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

	3: Distribution Lists
        ---------------------

	Distribution lists are so you can record a message and have
	it automatically sent to all users on your list.

	i.e. Your list could contain EVERYONE'S number
	     Or All Your M8s On the system.

		1: Create Distribution Lists

		2: Edit Distribution Lists

		3: Delete Distribution Lists

		4: Find Names Of People On Lists
