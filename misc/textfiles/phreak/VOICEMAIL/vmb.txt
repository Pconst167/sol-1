          Voice Mail Made Easy

Voice Mail Boxes, yes, VMB's.  They seem so trivial to the advanced phreak yet
most beginners find them very fascinating.  They often make a habit of begging
other people for them.  A real pain in the ass.
 
I am not a studly VMB hacker.  VMB's should not encompass your entire phreak
activities, as they really can be a waste of time.  This article is just the
basiic guidelines for attaining a VMB.
 
[1]             Find a system.  The easiest way to do this is to just find
                a codeline.
 
[2]             Get in good with the codeline operator.  If you continuously
                post shit he will get to like you..
 
[3]             Ask him where you can find empty boxes on the system.  If he
                readily complies ask if he might know the system default (more
                on this later)
 
[4]             Scan for an empty box.  You will know that you have hit
                an empty when it says "Box XXXX, Please leave your message
                after the tone.."  You now have your empty box.
 
[5]             Hack the box.  In order to do this you will need to find the
                point where it says "Enter your password". On some systems you
                will have to enter pound (#) as soon as you log in.  It will
                then ask for your box number (the empty one you just scanned)
                and then your password.  Try defaults (again, see below).  Some
                systems will require you to enter the box by calling up the
                box in a regular manner, and during the greeting hit star (*).
                You will then be asked for your password.
 
 
[Defaults]
 
Some systems have a certain password that is used for all empty boxes.  Many
times this password will be "1234" or the box number.  Here is where you get
creative.  The password COULD be up to 14 digits, but will usually only be
four.  Once you find a password that works it will probably be applicable to
every empty box on the system..
 
Here is also some good news.. on some systems empty boxes will have NO
password.
 
 
This is just a basic overrview... a crash course.  For more information check
out the Phrack World News article on this subject, you will get a bit of a
background on how these damn things work.
