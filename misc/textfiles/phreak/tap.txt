     TAP is the "official" phone phreak newsletter, and has existed since 1971.
Each 4 page issue is crammed full of information on phone phreaking, hacking,
free gas, free electricity, free postage, breaking & entering info, alarms,
various scams, lock picking info, etc.	It is largely phone phreak oriented,
however.

     A 10 issue subscription via first class mail costs $10.

     As of this writing (6/23/84), the current issue is #80, and issue #50 is
is 8 pages instead of the usual 4.  Back issues are $1 each, and issue #50 is
$1.50.	A brief index to the first 80 or so issues is available for a SASE, or
free with a subscription order.  TAP is non-profit, and is in desperate need of
material (articles), money, and volunteers.
