With the FBI watching us all the time,
 you can never be sure if its safe to
 say something.  Even if your not into
 good stuff, its still nice to know
 that your the only one on the phone.
  You don't want your sister listening
 in on you.  It is also well known that
 alot of the major BBS's are being
 monitored by the feds.  Well, we hope
 that the information presented here
 will allow you to feel safer on your
 telephone.

Most telephone surveillance devices
 used on hackers numbers are very
 simple.  They usually save the good
 stuff for spys and people like that.
  It is impossible to tell if the good
 stuff is on, but we have listed ways
 to detect some of the cheaper
 machines, and in some cases how to
 shut them off or screw them up.

The MLT-2.  This device is one of the
 mainstays of BS (BELL security).  Its
 main weakness is in that give tones to
 do its operation.  A friend of MAD!'s
 is currently working on a device he
 plans to call a purple box that will
 detect these tones.  You will just be
 able to keep it on, and it will report
 on any such tones.  We will keep you
 updated in future files.  Ok, if the
 MLT-2 is in MON (monitor) mode, you
 can do the following: A good old loud
 2600hz will usually switch it to LOOP
 mode.  Some times a 7200 will execute
 a TT (dial mode).  These will get them
 off your back for a while.  If you own
 a MLT-2 also, you can damage the other
 MLT-2.  First get the other MLT-2 into
 loop mode.  Now wait till it gets to
 LIN (test the inside part of the
 loop).  Now do a K2.  This will put
 the MLT-2 into a state of limbo.  Now
 to finish up, do a MLT SOAK test.
  This will put the offending machine
 out of commission for a little while.
  If you have an OMEGA BOX (nice little
 things), a flat tone will put the
 MLT-2 into a LRM (fast loop
 measurement), thus getting it off your
 line).


CONDUCTER TAGGER and ANALYZER test.

This will show you approxamatly how
 many people are on a line.
First you need to hook a volt/ohms
 meter up to the phone box in your
 wall.  Hook the line and the ground up
 to the red and green wires.  You can
 use one made for it, or you can modity
 the kind you use to check batterys by
 putting aligator clips on it.
 Now the volt meter will rise an fall
 depending on how many people pick up
 the phone, and how good the connection
 is.  If your sister picks up the
 phone, it will fall.  It picks up
 operators, and whatever.  Most of the
 cheaper tapping machines will be
 detectable.  Tape recorders can also
 be detected.  Even a person on a test
 phone will show up.  Its a great tool.
  Try using it on conferences some
 time.

If you have friends (or enemys) that
 like to listen to their phone
 conversation out a phone boxes with
 test phone theres something you can do
 about it.  The following information
 comes from Abbie Hoffman and George
 Hayduke in the classic book 'Getting
 Even' the complete book of dirty
 tricks.

Cut the female end off an ordinary
 extension cord.  Unscrew the
 mouthpiece on the telephone.  You will
 see a terminal for a red wire and one
 for a black.  Attach one of the wires
 from the extension cord to the red,
 and one to the black.  Now plug the
 extension cord into a power socket.
 According to Hoffman you are sending
 20 volts of electricity back through
 equipment made for 6 volts.  Fizz.


Note! The Lunatic Phringe Suggests 
that you do not try
 this.  It is not responsibly for any
 damage done to phone equipment, or to
 you.  Actually you would be sending
 110 volts through equipment made for
 48.  If you are really serious about
 doing this, we suggest you get a
 transformer to step the voltage level
 down.



Any infomation that is passed over
 phone line can be intercepted by the
 phone company.

Thanks to MR. X of a bell company we
 have learned how to defeat most
 surveillance devices using Blue/Omega
 boxes.  The blues range is very
 limited, but the omega boxes covers
 most of them.  See MAD!'s new OMEGA
 BOX handbook for more info.

ADS monitoring test.

ADS is the new trace/monitoring test
 being used by AT&T, MCI, soon SPRINT,
 and more.  It is very fast and
 accurate, but it has many many faults.

After much testing we found that if you
 do a 7200 and ADS is on the line, a
 volt meter will go go crazy.  A simple
 gold will make a pop if ADS is on the
 line.  For a lot more on ADS see
 MAD!'s upcoming DETECTING LINE TRACES.

TAP TEST NUMBERS

Lately MAD! has as been seeing alot of
 those tap test #'s.  Our friends at
 the phone company said there are such
 #'s, but they will only detect certain
 things. Here is a small list. We are
 not sure if they work, and didn't have
 time to test them.  We will print the
 results in an upcoming file.  If they
 do, we will print about 25 of them.

This came from someone named HACKER
 SMITH, but were not sure what system.
Here it is...

I GOT A # TO SEE IF YOUR BEING TRACED.
 WHEN YOU CALL IT USING YOUR PHREAKING
 SERVICE,YOU SHOULD HEAR A TONE THAT
 GOES UP IN FREQUENCY,THAT MEANS YOUR
 NOT BEING TRACED. IF YOU HEAR A STEADY
 TONE, THEN YOUR BEING TRACED AN YOU'D
 BETTER HANG UP IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS
 OR YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING
 TRACED...THE # IS 617-890-9900.
               ENJOY,
                    HACKER SMITH

Also you see the number posted around
 200-xxx-xxxx.  This is a ADS system
 used by bell linemen from phone boxes
 (see the MAD! file on TEST PHONES for
 info on phone boxing.).  It is not a
 trace test at all.
