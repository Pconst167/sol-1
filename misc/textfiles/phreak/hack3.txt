            Ever heard (actually, seen) people on various hacking boards
around the country telling you how you are going to get caught for sure if
you use the in state-WATS (950) telephone numbers to make your phreaks off of?
This file is to tell you what the story is with 950's and how to SAFELY use
them.
            The 950 prefix was created by the old Bell System for all the
SSC's (Specialized Common Carrier), or Extenders as they are called, to
place their services upon.  This was done for the long distance company's
benefit so they could have the same dialup in all cities across the USA.
For some reason, the Long Distance companies rejected the 950 prefix in favor
of local lines and 1-800 numbers.
            Disadvantages to 950's are that they are run on a special ESS of
their own that can trace you call before you can say 'shit!'.  But tracing
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   only occurs on special occasions.  The companies on 950's will only trace when
the computer controlling the calls sees that there is an unusually high number
of calls to the extender on that particular day.  The computer then will auto-
trace every 100th call or so.  Which means that, if used in moderation, 950's
are fantastic!
            Advantages:  By having the same dialup in all cities, you can go
on vacation and just hack codez to use for while you are there on your
favorite 950 extender.  Being a free call (in most cases, some phones not)
from a pay phone, this is very advantageous.   Also, and anyone who has used
a 950 knows this, the connections on 950 extenders are VERY clear usually,
making for excellent error-free data transfer on AE lines, etc.
            With the breakup of the Bell System in January of 1984, the 950
prefix was supposed to be dragged down with it and the companies were sup-
posed to have switched over to either local or 1-800 numbers, but as is
very typical of the phone company, they never got around to it.
            Here is the list of the 950's that are currently in use in the
U.S.  :
            950-1000..........Southern Pacific Communications
            950-1022..........MCI Exec-U-Net
            950-1033..........U.S. Telephone
            950-1044..........AllNet
            950-1066..........Lexitel
            950-1088..........SBS Skyline
 
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                               Personally, I favor the use of 950-1088, because it has many
users and the codez (which, by the way are 6 digits, but they are switching
over to 8 digits) are easy to hack out from a pay phone.  You may want to try
the other services so you can have a few codez from each available for use.
 
Stay Phree!
