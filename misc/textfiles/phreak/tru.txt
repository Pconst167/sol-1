The Tru system is a telemanagement system which provides the user 

with complete call recording information. 
Some of the features offered by this system are;

Recording capability of up to 50,000 call records per hour

Abuse and exception reporting

Cost allocation and traffic statistics reports

Ability to use the TRU system for other microcomputer 

applications at the same time

The heart of any TRU system is an IBM Pc or Compatible which 

becomes capable of;

Capturing call detail from up to 15 PBX's simultaneously

The overall purpose of the TRU system is to control and direct 

Inter-agency telephone calls for large corporations as well as 

long distance services. The private customer owns the equipment. 

Most TRU system microcomputers have an internal modem so that 

remote access can be established and all functions available at 

the remote site. ALL Tru systems use a:

         RACAL-VADIC VA212PA modem
or
         RACAL-VADIC 1200PA modem
or
         RACAL-VADIC 2400PA Mod. 1 or 2
      or   
  Hayes Smartmodem 1200
or 
 Hayes Smartmodem 2400

It is also interesting to note that ALL tru system have two 

master PW's that are found on ALL tru systems and cannot be 

destroyed or changed.
