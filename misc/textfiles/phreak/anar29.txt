Introduction:

     Here we are, in yet another episode of Anarchist Phone Pranks.  This
Volume will be substantially shorter than the last, but will still present
some
(hopefully new) useful little skits for your phone pranks.

     I'm sure that most of you have no idea what the title of this article
means.  In German, it means 'Radio Games' and relates to something the Germans
did over the radio and the wires during WWII.  However, that's really not
important here.  What is important is that you will soon become a Radio DJ and
pull off your own "RadioFunkSpiel"...

The Scam:

     As many others before me have pointed out, people are the most gullable,
and ignorant creatures to walk the face of this earth.  So, why not take
advantage of it!

     A simple scam we pulled off was to call up people, and pretend to be a DJ
at a local (or not so local) radio station.  Then, tell them they've been
picked at random from the phone book (which, most had been) and that they had
20 seconds to answer a single question and if they answered it correctly, they
would receive $50.  The question needn't be related to the radio, or songs, or
singers.  Infact, it makes it more interesting if it's something simple, so
simple, people never think about the answer.  Some typical phone pranks went
this way:

Dialing...<RING> <RING> <RING>
[An incoherent woman answers; sounds as if she's just woken up.]

Rebel: [Speaking quickly, like a DJ:] Hi!  This is <insert your favorite DJ>
       from <insert your favorite radio station>!  For $50 can you name the
       Capital of Alaska?
Woman: Uh...
Rebel: 20 seconds...
Woman: Uh...
Rebel: [More urgent:] 15 seconds...
Woman: Uh...Fairbanks?
Rebel: I'm sorry.  That is incorrect. [It's Juneau].  Better luck next time.
Woman: [A bit sad:] Yah.
Rebel: What's your favorite Radio Station?

99% of the time they'll say their favorite radio station is the one you
represent.  But sometimes, the sore lozers will say it's something else.  Then
you just say, "Well, fuck you then!" and hang up.

Dialing...<RING>
[Wow, some guy answers on the first ring. What does he do, live by the
phone or something, waiting for people like us to call?]

Rebel: Hi!  This is <so and so> from <such and such>.  We have randomly
       selected you to participate in our <radio station> Questionaire!
       [Heh, Heh].  For $50 can you name the capital of Hawaii?
Man:   Um...
Rebel: 20 seconds...
Man:   [He blurts out confidently:] Honolulu! Yah, it's Honolulu!
Rebel: [It really is Honolulu, but...] I'm sorry, that is incorrect.
Man:   [Angered:] No it isn't!  It's Honolulu!!
Rebel: I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't Honolulu.
Man:   Oh.  It isn't?
Rebel: No, sir.  Sorry.  Better luck next time.  What's your favorite
       Radio Station?  [You always gotta ask that question to sound legit.]

Dialing...<RING> <RING>
[This guy sounds like a real loze.  Probably because it's
{Bob Retard's phone no.  Yes, Bob returns once more in Vol. II!]

Bob:   Hello?
Rebel: Hi!  This is <so and so> from <such and such> radio station.
Bob:   Uh, who?
Rebel: For $50 can you name the Capital of Nebraska?
Rebel: 20 seconds...
Bob:   Uh...Hold on...Lemme get my Atlas...[The bastard goes and gets
       his Atlas!  Can you believe it?]
Rebel: 15 seconds...
Bob:   [You can hear pages turning:] It's Lincoln.  Lincoln, Nebraska.
Rebel: [Stunned:] Uh, Correct!  You win the $50!
       Ok, What's your name?
       What's your address?

Bob gives us his name and address.

Rebel: Ok, it's in the mail.  Thanks.  What's your favorite radio station?
Bob:   Thanks [Real happy] What radio station did you say you were from?
Rebel: <CLICK>

Later that day, we sent him his $50 allright.  $50 in Monopoly Money, that is.

     What's good is to ask questions like "Who's the Secretary of State," and
"Who's our state Assemblyman," and "Is our radio station AM or FM," and "Is
God
black or white?"  A real good one is to say, "Hi, this is so-and-so from
such-and-such radio station.  For $50, who am I?"  I swear, 90% of the people
will not know who you are, even after you've just told them (especially if you
say it all fast)! Another good one is, "...do you have a
such-and-such-radio-station bumper sticker?"  If they say yes, you send 'em
the
$50 or whatever.  If they say no, you could say, "Well, just for being honest,
we'll send you a $10 gift certificate..." or something.  I used that one one
night to find someone's address (I knew the phone number).


There's no end to the fun you can have as a radio DJ!  Some of those Rick Dees
stunts leap to mind.  If you come up with some new material, let us know, or
let us know about some of the success you have had.

This has been a Krackartists' Presentation.
