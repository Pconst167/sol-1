Welcome To The World Of WarGames Dialers!  If you are a past user 
of  the ULTRA-DIAL series or a new one,  you will find ULTRA-DIAL 
version 5.1 to be an utterly different and amazing program.

1.0 MINIMUM CONFIGURATION
-------------------------

     To  operate ULTRA-DIAL v5.1 with  optimum  performance,  the 
following equipment is required:

     o IBM PC or XT with 256k
     o One disk drive (floppy or hard/fixed)
     o Hayes 1200 External Modem (internal is questionable)
     o Any brand 80-column line printer
      
     THE  HAYES MODEM REQUIRES the following switch settings  for 
this program to detect and process carriers correctly.

           SWITCH .................... 12345678
           SETTING ................... UUDUDUUD

     If these settings are not maintained during the operation of 
ULTRA-DIAL v5.1, errors may occur in all aspects of the program.
     ULTRA-DIAL  v5.1 will now has the possibility of  supporting 
other   than  Hayes  modes,   such  as  compatibles  like  Anchor 
Automations's  various  models which require  a  special  hang-up 
method.

2.0 ULTRA.CNF CONFIGURATION
---------------------------

     Version  5.1 offers the versatility of a configuration  file 
for  your convenience.    When you first boot ULTRA51,   you will 
be asked  to  create  the  file  ULTRA.CNF,    the  following  is   
a description of the questions that are asked.

Communications Port.......... Select COM1: or COM2: with 1 or 2
Baud Rate.................... Open and operate the modem at 300 
                              baud or 1200 baud.  I suggest you
                              open the modem at 300 for safety.
Wait Time During Call........ How long to wait per call for a
                              carrier tone to be transmitted.
Modem speaker................ Select Y to have the Hayes modem's
                              internal speaker on, otherwise it
                              will default to your modems normal
                              speaker setting (if any).
Tone or Pulse Dialing........ Select if ULTRA-DIAL should use
                              TONE for dialing or PULSE.
Communications mode.......... Select mode 1 for the normally used
                              ULTRA-DIAL method of hang-up.  Or,
                              if you are using a modem such as
                              Anchor Automation's modems, select
                              2  for an alternate method of hang- 
                              up (escape, then ATZ).

      To create a new ULTRA.CNF, simply delete the old one.

*IMPORTANT*  If  you  tell ULTRA-DIAL to open the modem  at  1200 
baud, it will only be able to detect 1200 BAUD NUMBERS!  I highly 
suggest that you set the baud rate at 300 for the best detection.


3.0 START A DIALING ROUTINE
---------------------------

     This is the primary part of the program.  The following is a 
description of the prompts.

Enter prefix............. If you would like a prefix to be placed 
                          before EVERY number (i.e. for MCI), you
                          may place that data here otherwise you
                          hit <ENTER> for none.
Enter LOW number......... This is where you enter the low (also
                          called starting) number in the dialing
                          sequence. (i.e. 9861673)
Enter HIGH number........ This where you enter the high (also
                          called ending) number in the dialing
                          sequence.

DO  NOT  USE  HYPHENS IN THE LOW AND  HIGH  NUMBERS!!   You  may, 
though,  use  commas is the PREFIX only!   Be careful of what you 
enter yet this program is free for experimenting.

There  is a final option for a printer.   If you want all CARRIER 
FOUND   numbers  to  be  sent  to  the  printer   for   recording 
immdeiately, answer Y to this prompt, else enter N here.
-------------------------------***-------------------------------
The dialing sequence will start now.   You will see at the top of 
the  screen  the  numbers  being dialed,  the  bottom  shows  two 
function keys:

[F1] - QUIT  - Will exit dialing routine after number in progress 
is  completed.   Only  press this key once and then  wait  for  a 
reaction.  It takes a few seconds to respond.

[F2]  - PAUSE  - Will pause the dialing routine AFTER  NUMBER  IN 
PROGRESS  IS COMPLETED.   Again,  wait a few moments for this  to 
respond.

     AT  THE  END  of the dialing routine,  an alarm  will  sound 
momentarily  and then it will go into a "wait  mode"...the  first 
sixty  seconds  of this wait mode will contain 10 chirps every  6 
seconds...after  that the screen will clear to prevent  burn  in.  
Hit Any Key during this wait mode to get the main menu.
-------------------------------***-------------------------------


4.0 VIEW AND DIAL A SELECTED NUMBER
-----------------------------------

     ULTRA-DIAL also incorporates a very simple terminal mode for 
use  in  quick  testing  of the numbers you  have  found  without 
exiting ULTRA-DIAL itself.
     When you select the V)iew and Dial option you will be  shown 
the numbers that are in the ULTRA.NBR file.   Only 40 numbers can 
be  displayed  so deletion of this file is  recommended  whenever 
possible to make room for new numbers. 
     Use  <SPACE BAR> to go through the numbers with the pointer. 
When  you have the pointer on the number you wish  to  dial,  hit 
<RETURN>.  (the <ESC> key will exit this)
     Here,  the  ULTRA-DIAL  terminal  takes over and  dials  the 
number for you!

*NOTE*   DUE  TO  THE  SIMPLICITY  OF  THIS   TERMINAL,   CERTAIN 
CONNECTIONS  MAY OVERFLOW THE TERMINAL.   IT IS  NOT  RECOMMENDED 
THAT YOU USE THIS TERMINAL FOR SERIOUS COMMUNICATIONS.


5.0 ENTER TERMINAL MODE
-----------------------

     This  command  will  simply  put  you  into  the  ULTRA-DIAL 
terminal  mode  as described above.   All input goes directly  to 
your modem during operation of the terminal.   Use the <ESC>  key 
to exit back to the main menu.


6.0 PRINT A COPY OF THE NUMBERS FOUND
-------------------------------------

     This  command  will simply print  out,  in  "ULTRA-official" 
form, all of the numbers is the ULTRA.NBR file.  


7.0 DELETE ALL NUMBERS FOUND
----------------------------
     
     This command will delete and set-up the ULTRA.NBR file.   It 
is  recommended that you do this often so as to make room for new 
numbers to be recorded.

 
8.0 SOUND MODE TOGGLE
---------------------

     As per a reques by a user,  I have added a "SILENT" mode  to 
ULTRA-DIAL.   It  basicly quiets down the dialing routine.   This 
can be helpful in coordination with the speaker toggle for night-
time  operation.   The  simples BEEPS that are  heard  when,  for 
example,  you  go to dial a number,  are heard regardless of  the 
mode.   Simply  press T at the main menu and you can  toggle  the 
sound mode you are in.


9.0 RESET DATE AND TIME
-----------------------

     This  one is pretty self-explanatory...It will allow you  to 
change  the date and time appropriately just as the DOS DATE  and 
TIME prompt would.   


10.0 QUIT TO DOS
----------------

     This command is self-explanatory.   You will be placed  back 
into DOS where you left off.


11.0 COMMAND LINE ENTRIES
-------------------------

     The  feature  presentation  of  ULTRA-DIAL's  command   line 
system!  Now you can run ULTRA-DIAL quickly and efficiently.  The 
format for the command reads as follows:

A>ULTRA5 (prefix),<low #>,<high #>,(printer)

     In other words, if you were to enter:

A>ULTRA5 9,9861673,9861690,N

     Ultra-Dial  would take 9 as the prefix,  9861673 as the  low 
number,  9861690 as the high number, and that you did not want to 
use  a  printer and use it all in a dialing  routine.   In  other 
words,  you  can  start  dialing  routines by  entering  all  the 
information on your boot line.
     THERE  MUST  BE *THREE* COMMAS IN  THE  COMMAND  LINE!   The 
prefix is optional, for example:

A>ULTRA5 ,9861673,9861690,N

     Would  do the same as above except without a  prefix.  Also, 
the printer is optional and if it is left out, it will be assumed 
as no printer, for example:

A>ULTRA5 ,9861673,9861690,

     Would  also  do  the  same  thing  without  a  prefix.   You 
experiment with this feature you you can just boot ULTRA5 without 
a  command line.   The feature was added for convience.   It also 
justifies the requirement for this program to use an IBM only.
