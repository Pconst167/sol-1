        HOW TO BE A REAL PHREAK

IN THE PHONE PHREAK SOCIETY THERE ARE
CERTAIN VALUES THAT EXIST IN ORDER TO
BE A TRUE PHREAK, THESE ARE BEST 
SUMMED UP BY THE MAGICIAN:
"MANY PEOPLE THINK OF PHONE PHREAKS AS
SLIME, OUT TO RIP OFF BELL FOR ALL SHE
IS WORTH.  NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH!  GRANTED, THERE ARE
SOME WHO GET THEIR KICKS BY MAKING
FREE CALLS; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT TRUE
PHONE PHREAKS.  REAL PHONE PHREAKS ARE
'TELECOMMUNICATIONS HOBBYISTS' WHO 
EXPERIMENT, PLAY WITH AND LEARN FROM 
THE PHONE SYSTEM.  OCCASIONALY THIS
EXPERIMENTING, AND A NEED TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PHREAKS ( WITH-
OUT GOING BROKE), LEADS TO FREE CALLS. 
THE FREE CALLS ARE BUT A SMALL SUBSET
OF A >TRUE< PHONE PHREAKS ACTIVITIES.

         THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

REPRINTED FROM TAP ISSUE #86.  (TAP,
ROOM 603, 147 W 42 STREET, NEW YORK, NY
10036.  SEND A SASE FOR THEIR INFO
SHEET "WHAT THE HELL IS TAP?" AND
TELL THEM THAT BIOC AGENT 003 TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT.)
 
  THE PHONE PHREAK'S TEN COMMANDMENTS
 
   I.  BOX THOU NOT OVER THINE HOME
       TELEPHONE WIRES, FOR THOSE  WHO
       DOEST MUST SURELY BRING THE  
       WRATH OF THE CHIEF SPECIAL 
       AGENT DOWN UPON THY HEADS.
 
  II.  SPEAKEST THOU NOT OF IMPORTANT
       MATTERS OVER THINE HOME TEL-
       EPHONE WIRES, FOR TO DO SO IS TO
       RISK THINE RIGHT OF FREEDOM.
 
 III.  USE NOT THINE OWN NAME WHEN 
       SPEAKING TO OTHER PHREAKS, FOR
       THAT EVERY THIRD PHREAK IS AN 
       FBI AGENT IS WELL KNOWN.
 
  IV.  LET NOT OVERLY MANY PEOPLE KNOW
       THAT THY BE A PHREAK, AS TO DO 
       SO IS TO USE THINE OWN SELF AS
       A SACRIFICIAL LAMB.
 
   V.  IF THOU BE IN SCHOOL, STRIVE TO 
       GET THIN SELF GOOD GRADES, FOR
       THE AUTHORITIES WELL KNOW THAT
       SCHOLARS NEVER BREAK THE LAW.
 
  VI.  IF THOU WORKEST, TRY TO BE A 
0      EMPLOYEE, AND IMPRESSEST THINE
       BOSS WITH THINE ENTHUSIASM, FOR
       IMPORTANT EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN
       SAVED BY THEIR OWN BOSSES.
 
 VII.  STOREST THOU NOT THINE STOLEN 
       GOODES IN THINE OWN HOME, FOR
       THOSE WHO DO ARE SURELY NON-
       BELIEVERS IN THE BELL SYSTEM
       SECURITY FORCES, AND ARE NOT 
       LONG FOR THIS WORLD.
 
VIII.  ATTRACTEST THOU NOT THE ATT-
       ENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES, AS 
       THE LESS NOTICABLE THOU ART, THE
       BETTER.
 
  IX.  MAKEST SURE THINE FRIENDS ARE 
       INSTANT AMNESIACS AND WILL NOT
       REMEMBER THAT THOU HAVE CALLED
       ILLEGALLY, FOR THEIR COOPERATION
       WITH THE AUTHORITIES WILL SURELY
       LESSEN THINE TIME FOR FREEDOM ON
       THIS EARTH.
 
   X.  SUPPORTEST THOU TAP, AS IT IS 
       THINE NEWSLETTER, AND WITHOUT 
       IT, THY WORK WILL BE FAR MORE 
       LIMITED.
 
             CN/A NU
 
HERE IS HOW AN EMPLOYEE MIGHT GO ABOUT
CALLING CN/A:
"HI, THIS IS JOHN DOE FROM THE MIAMI
RESIDENTAL SERVICE CENTER, CAN I HAVE
THE CUSTOMERS NAME AT (123) 555-1212."
THE EMPLOYEES USUALLY USE THESE FOR
CHECKING WHO BELONGS TO A # THAT
SOMEONE CLAIMED THEY DIDN'T CALL.
 
IF YOU SOUND CHEERY AND NATURAL THE
OPERATOR WILL NEVER ASK ANY QUESTIONS.
IF YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE A MATURE ADULT,
DON'T USE IT!  ALWAYS PRACTICE FIRST &
SO YOU DON'T SCREW UP
AND MAKE THE OPERATOR SUSPICIOUS.  USE 
NAME THAT SOUNDS REAL, NOT YOUR PIRATE
NAME EITHER!  ALSO SAY THAT YOU ARE FRO
A CITY THAT IS FAR AWAY FROM THE ONE
THAT YOU ARE CALLING.
 
THE CN/A NUMBER FOR THE NY AREA &
VICINITY (212, 315, 516, 518, 607, 716,
& 914) IS>>>>>>>>>(518) 471-8111<<<<<<
AND IS OPEN DURING BUSINESS HOURS.
DON'T ABUSE IT!
 
            AT&T NEWSLINES

AT&T NEWSLINES ARE NUMBERS AT AREA
PHONE OFFICES THAT TELCO EMPLOYEES CALL
TO FIND OUT THE LATEST INFO ON NEW
TECHNOLOGY, STOCKS, ETC.  THE RECORDED
REPORTS RANGE FROM VERY BORING TO VERY
INTERESTING.

HERE ARE A FEW OF THE NUMBERS:
 *(201) 483-3800 NJ  (518) 471-2272 NY
  (203) 771-4920 CN  (717) 255-5555 PA
  (212) 393-2151 NY  (717) 787-1031 PA
  (516) 234-9941 NY *(914) 948-8100 NY
 
SOME OF THESE NUMBERS ARE TOLL-FREE,
BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS COUNT ON IT.
 
* THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT ALWAYS UP!
 
NUMBERS FROM OTHER AREAS ARE AVAILABLE
BY REQUEST FROM F)BIOC  L)AGENT 003.
 
             ANI NUMBERS

ANI NUMBERS IDENTIFY THE PHONE NUMBER
THAT YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  IT IS 
USEFUL WHEN PLAYING IN CANS (THOSE
BIG SILVER BOXES ON TELEPHONE POLES)
TO FIND OUT THE # OF THE LINE.  IT IS
ALSO GOOD TO FIND OUT THE # OF A PHONE
THAT DOESN'T HAVE IT PRINTED ON IT.  IN
THE 914 AREA CODE THE ANI # IS 990.  IF
YOU JUST HAVE TO DIAL THE LAST 4 DIGITS
FOR A LOCAL #, IE CONGERS (268), DIAL
1-990-1111, WHERE 1111 ARE DUMMY DIGITS
THERE IS ALSO A LESS USEFUL TYPE OF ANI
# WHICH WILL IDENTIFY THE AREA CODE &
EXCHANGE.  IT IS NXX-9901, WHERE NXX IS
THE EXCHANGE.  IN THE 212 & 516 AREA
CODES THE ANI # IS 958.
 
          PHREAK NEWSLETTER

                  TAP
                  ROOM 603
                  147 WEST 42ND STREET
                  NEW YORK, NY 10036
 
BELIEVE ME:  IT WILL BE THE BEST $10 
             YOU WILL EVER SPEND...
 
              BLATT,  10%  RESISTOR.  ANY  ELECTRONICS
PLACE SHOULD HAVE THESE.
 
NOW,  CUT TWO  PIECES OF  WIRE, ABOUT 6
INCHES, AND  ATTACH  THESE TO  THE  TWO
SCREWS ON THE SWITCH.  TURN YOUR NORMAL
DDSIDE DOWN AND UNSCREW  THE
2  SCREWS.  LOCATE  THE  "F"  AND  "RR"
SCREWS ON  THE  NETWORK BOX.  WRAP  THE
RESISTOR  BETWEEN  THESE  2  SCREWS AND
MAKE SURE THAT THE WIRES TOUCH ONLY THE
PROPER TERMINALS!  NOW CONNECT ONE WIRE
FROM THE  SWITCH  TO THE  RR  TERMINAL.
FINALLY,  ATTACH THE  REMAINING WIRE TO
THE GREEN WIRE (DISCONNECT IT FROM  ITS
TERMINAL).  NOW  BRING  THE  SWITCH OUT
THE REAR OF THE PHONE AND CLOSE IT  UP.
PUT  THE SWITCH IN A POSITION WHERE YOU
GET A  DIAL  TONE, MARK  THIS  NORMAL.
MARK THE OTHER SIDE FREE.
 
WHEN    YOUR   FRIENDS   CALL   (AT   A
PREARRANGED TIME), QUICKLY LIFT &  DROP
THE RECEIVER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  THIS
WILL STOP THE RINGING, IF NOT TRY
AGAIN.  IT IS  VERY IMPORTANT  THAT YOU
DO IT FAST! NOW  PUT THE SWITCH IN  THE
FREE  POSITION AND  PICK UP  THE PHONE.
KEEP  ALL  CALLS   SHORT  &  UNDER   15
MINUTES.
 
WHEN  SOMEONE CALLS  YOU LONG-DISTANCE,
THEY ARE  BILLED  FROM THE  MOMENT  YOU
ANSWER.   THE  TELCO   KNOWS  WHEN  YOU
ANSWER DUE TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
VOLTAGE THAT FLOWS WHEN YOU PICK UP THE
PHONE.  HOWEVER, THE RESISToR CUTS DOWN
ON  THE  VOLTAGE  SO  IT  IS  BELOW THE
BILLING RANGE BUT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH  TO
OPERATE THE MOUTHPIECE.  ANSWERING THE
PHONE FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND  STOPS
THE  RING  BUT  IT  IS  NOT  ENOUGH FOR
BILLING  TO  START.  IF  THE  PHONE  IS
ANSWERED  FOR  EVEN  ONE  FULL  SECOND,
BILLING WILL START AND YOU WILL BE CUT
OFF  WHEN  YOU  HANG UP  AND  SWITCH TO
FREE.
 
WARNING:  BELL CAN RANDOMLY LOOK FOR
          BLACK BOXES SO BE CAREFUL!

              DIAL LOCKS

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN AN OFFICE OR 
SOMEWHERE AND WANTED TO MAKE A FREE
FONE CALL BUT SOME ASSHOLE PUT A LOCK
ON THE FONE TO PREVENT OUT-GOING CALLS?
 
FRET NO MORE PHELLOW PHREAKS, FOR EVERY
SYSTEM CAN BE BEATEN WITH A LITTLE 
KNOWLEDGE!
 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO BEAT THIS 
OBSTACLE, FIRST PICK THE LOCK, I DON'T 
HAVE THE TIME TO TEACH LOCKSMITHING SO
WE GO TO THE SECOND METHOD WHICH TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.
 
TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE, WHEN YOU 
PICK UP THE FONE YOU COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
KNOW AS A LOCAL LOOP.  WHEN YOU HANG-UP
YOU BREAK THE CIRCUIT.  WHEN YOU DIAL
(PULSE) IT ALSO BREAKS THE CIRCUT BUT 
NOT LONG ENOUGH TO HANG UP!  SO YOU CAN
"PUSH-DIAL."  TO DO THIS YOU >RAPIDLY<
DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
TO DIAL AN OPERATO WITH YOUR OWN # SO YOU'LL 
GET A BUSY TONE WHEN RIGHT.  IT'LL ALSO
WORK ON TOUCH-TONE(TM) SINCE A DTMF 
LINE WILL ALSO ACCEPT PULSE.  ALSO, 
NEVER DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK FOR MORE
THAN A SECOND OR IT'LL HANG-UP!
 
FINALLY, REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE JUST AS
MUCH RIGHT TO THAT FONE AS THE ASSHOLE
WHO PUT THE LOCK ON IT!
 
           EXCHANGE SCANNING

ALMOST EVERY EXCHANGE IN THE BELL
SYSTEM HAS TEST #'S AND OTHER "GOODIES"
SUCH AS LOOPS WITH DIAL-UPS.
 
THESE "GOODIES" NNCOME LUCKY!
 
HERE ARE MY FINDINGS IN THE 914-268
EXCHANGE:
 
 
9900 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9901 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF
       A LOOP)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL
       OFFICE
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL
       OFFICE
9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE
       TRANSMISSION?)
9960 -0OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) --
       MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME
       EXCHANGES
9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS
       TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS
 
MOST OF THE NUMBERS BETWEEN 9900 & 9999
WILL RING OR GO TO A "WHAT #, PLEASE?"
OPERATOR.
 
HAVE PHUN AND REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A
LOCAL CALL!
 
      TOUCH-TONE & FREE CALLS

THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE FREE
CALLS (SPRINT, MCI, ETC.) USING A
ROTARY PHONE.  THEY ARE:
 
 1. USE A NUMBER THAT ACCEPTS VOICE AS
    WELL AS DTMF.  SUCH A # IS (800)
    521-8400.  AS OF WRITING THIS, A
    CODE WAS 00717865.
     A) IF USING VOICE, WAIT FOR THE
        COMPUTER TO SAY, "AUTHORIZATION
        #, PLEASE."  THEN SAY EACH
        DIGIT SLOWLY, IT WILL BEEP
        AFTER EACH DIGIT IS SAID.
        AFTER EVERY GROUP OF DIGITS, IT
        WILL REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
        THEN SAY YES IF IT IS CORRECT,
        OTHERWISE SAY NO.  IF THE
        ACCESS CODE IS CORRECT, IT WILL
        THANK YOU AND ASK FOR THE
        DESTINATION #, THEN SAY THE
        AREA CODE + NUMBER AS ABOVE.
        ANOTHER SUCH # IS (800) 245-
        8173, WHICH HAS A 6 DIGIT
        ACCESS CODE. (NOTE:  IF USING
        TOUCH-TONE ON THIS #, ENTER THE
        CODE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TONE
        STOPS.)

 2.  HOOK UP A TOUCH-TONE FONE INTO
     YOUR ROTARY FONE.  ATTACH THE RED
     WIRE FROM THE TOUCH-TONE FONE TO
     THE "R" TERMINAL INSIDE THE FONE
     ON THE NETWORK BOX.  THEN HOOK THE
     GREEN WIRE TO THE0"B" TERMINAL.
     TO USE THIS DIAL THE # USING
     ROTARY & THEN USE THE TOUCH-TONE
     FOR THE CODES. (DON'T HANG UP THE
     ROTARY FONE WHILE DOING THIS
     THOUGH!)  IF THIS DOESN'T WORK
     THEN REVERSE THE 2 WIRES.  (NOTE:
     IF YOUR LINE CAN ACCEPT TOUCH-TONE
     BUT YOU HAVE A ROTARY FONE THEN
     YOU CAN HOOK UP A TONE FONE
     DIRECTLY FOR ALL CALLS BUT THIS
     USUALLY ISN'T THE CASE.)
     SUCH AS RADIO SHACK'S 43-138.
 
OTHER ALTERNATIVES
 
 4.  USE A CHARGE-A-CALL FONE.  (THESE
     ALSO MAKE GREAT EXTENTIONS IF YOU
     REMOVE IT USING A HEX WRENCH WITH
     A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE ON THE CENTER
     SCREW!)--YOUR DIME WILL COME
     BACK, IMMEDIATELY PUT A DIME BACK
     IN (IT'LL COME BACK WHEN YOU HANG
     UP!)  IF IT IS A TONE FIRST FONE
     AND IT DISCONNECTS THE KEYPAD
     (SOME DON'T) THEN FIND ANOTHER
     FONE.
 
             TELCO TRACING

THE GOOD 'OL DAYS:
------------------
 
WAY BACK BEFORE I WAS A PHREAK, MA BELL
WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY TRACE A CALL IF
THEY THOUGH SOMETHING WAS FUCKED UP.
FIRST THEY WOULD SEND A 2000 HZ
TRACING TONE, THE WOULD BE FOLLOWED B
ALOT OF NOISE AND CLICKS.  IT TOOK
ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES TO TRACE A CALL AND
ALOT OF PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
PROCESS.  SO AT 1 IN THE MORNING THEY
WOULD HAVE TO WAKE UP PEOPLE FOT THE
TRACEES (PHREAK
JARGON FOR A PAY FONE).  BUT NEVER USE
THE SAME ONE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE
BECAUSE THE GESTAPO(ER..EXCUSE ME 
MEAN BELL SECURITY) HAS BEEN KNOW FOR
STAKING OUT TROUBLED FORTRESSES.  IT'S
ALSO POSSIBLE FOR TRAVELNET OR SP
TO ASK FOR A TROUBLE # BUT THE TELCO
IS SLOW IN PROCESSING STUFF--ESPECIALLY
FOR THE COMPETITION--SO DON'T FRET
PHELLOW PHREAKS.
 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------
THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ESS + CCIS
WHICH CAN BE TRACED IN 1 SECOND.
