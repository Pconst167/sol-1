THE NEON BOX
--------------------------------------

A NEON BOX IS A VERY SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR FONE THAT WILL ALLOW A
VERYCLEAR PASSAGE FROM YOUR COMPUTER TONESTO YOUR FONE.  IT ALSO WORKS
GREAT FOR RECORDING TONES, SEX FONE, OR ANYTHINGELSE YOU WANT TO RECORD
OFF OF YOUR FONE.

TOOLS:
------
THIS MODIFICATION IS VERY SIMPLE, AND CAN BE USED ON MOST FONES,
THOUGH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT ON ONE-PIECE UNITS.ALL YOU NEED IS AN OLD
PAIR OFHEADFONES, OR SIMILAR, A PHILIPS SCREWDRIVER, A SOLDERING IRON,
AND SOME SOLDER.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
OPEN YOUR FONE WITH THE SCREWDRIVER.WHEN OPENED, LOOK FOR THE RED
ANDBLACK WIRES THAT LEAD TO THE MOUTHPIECE (IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHICH
WIRES LEAD TO THE MOUTHPIECE, OPEN UPTHE MOUTHPIECE AND FIND THE SAME
COLOR WIRES ON THE BASE.  FOR ONE-PIECEUNITS, JUST LOCATE THE MOUTHPIECE).

WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THE MOUTHPIECE,OR WIRES, CUT THE EARD OF THE
HEADFONES OFF, AND ONE WIRE (THE ONE THATLEADS TO THE RIGHT EAR).  STRIP
THE LEFT WIRE SO ABOUT AN EIGHTH INCH ISSHOWING.  KEEP THE OTHER SIDE
INTACT.

THEN ON THE RED WIRE, SOLDER THE WIRE THAT IS SEPARATELY SEALED FROM
THE OTHER ONE.  ON THE BLACK WIRE (THESEARE THE ENDS OF THE WIRE ON THE
CIRCUIT BOARD) SOLDER THE WIRE WRAPPEDAROUND THE OTHER WIRE.  THEN SOLDER
A HOLE FOR THE WIRE.  YOU HAVE NOW MADEA NEON BOX.
