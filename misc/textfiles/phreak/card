                             -----------
Don't throw that used phone card away coz heres how to get unlimited phonecalls
all you need is a piece of unused videotape (which you glue ( pritstik works
well ) across the magnetic strip ( indicated by the parallel lines) the tape
section is then rubbed with a 2B pencil LIGHTLY to leave a fine coating on the
strip. When the card is inserted the tape and carbon from the pencil causes
reverse magnetism which nine times out of ten the magnetic detector in the card
slot cannot handle, so it allows you unlimited free time on the phone.Of course
this is for information only and I know you wouldn't do this coz its breaking
the law!!
