                                   Introduction

     This is the sequel to The Cat's Meow---it contains every recipe that was
     in the first volume (February 1991), plus almost every recipe posted  to
     the  Homebrew  Digest since the first volume. Yet it's smaller  in  disk
     space  and  in printed form, due to the omission  of  appendixes.

     In  this  edition  we decided to branch out a  little.   We  brought  in
     recipes from other public domain sources.  Namely, rec.crafts.brewing, a
     few  from  the  Cider Digest and even a few donated  recipes  that  came
     direct from the authors that have never been previously posted.

     Many  thanks to all of the fine folks on the homebrew digest and  others
     who  posted these recipes and who answered questions about them.  Thanks
     also to Ed Meeks for reviewing and proofreading the document.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds    light, unhopped syrup
                     1 pound     Cara-pils malt, cracked
                     1 pound     light crystal malt, cracked
                     1-1/2 ounces  Hallertauer hops pellets
                     1 teaspoon   salt
                     1 teaspoon   citric acid
                     2-1/2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                     2 tablespoons  Irish moss
                     2 packs     Munton & Fison yeast

     Procedure:

     Put cara-pils and crystal malt in 2 gallon pot with 170-180 degree water
     for  one  hour, stir occasionally. Sparge into boiling pot  with  enough
     water  to bring volume to 3-1/2 gallons. Add syrup and 1 ounce of  hops.
     Boil one hour, adding Irish moss in last 1/2 hour and 1/2 ounce hops  in
     last  10  minutes. Add salt, citric acid, and nutrient. Put  in  primary
     with enough water to bring volume to 5 gallons. Pitch yeast at about  75
     degrees.

     Comments:

     This is simple, yet a little different from any of my previous  batches.
     Ingredients were ordered from Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa---great
     company...good stuff and two-day delivery.

     Digest: Issue #203, 7/18/89

     Ingredients:

                      3 pounds   light Scottish malt extract
                      3 pounds   2-row pale malt
                      9 AAU      Kent Goldings hops
                                 Edme ale yeast
                      1 teaspoon gelatin
                      1 ounce    PolyClar-AT
                      1 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This beer was made using the small-scale mash procedure described by
     Miller in The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing.

     Comments:

     This  beer  had an unpleasant "dry" feeling to it and left  me  thirsty.
     Possibly my sparging procedure could be at fault with too much hot water
     being passed over the grains. It is also possible that the yeast was too
     attenuative or that the fermentation temperatures were too high (ambient
     temperature fluctuated between 70 and 90 degrees).

     Digest: Issue #512, 10/8/90

     Ingredients (for 7 gallons):

                    6.6 pounds M&F light unhopped malt extract
                    3/4 pounds M&F light unhopped spray
                    3/4 pound  crystal malt
                    1 teaspoon gypsum
                    2 ounces   clusters hops (boil)
                    1/2 ounce  cascades hops (finish)
                               ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 7-gallon recipe. Steep crystal malt while bringing water to  a
     boil. Remove crystal malt and add extract. Boil.

     Comments:

     This  is a 7-gallon recipe that was divided into 7  1-gallon  fermenters
     for  the purpose of testing different yeasts. Fermentation  was  carried
     out  at  75-85 degrees. Best results were obtained with Edme  ale  yeast
     which  was  well-rounded  and slightly sweet. Some  diacetyl,  but  nice
     balance.  Whitbread ale yeast was lighter and crisper, but had a  poorer
     head and some esters. CWE ale yeast was very dry but had a good head
     and no esters---fermentation was frighteningly fast.

     Digest: Issue #504, 9/26/90

     Ingredients:

                       7-8 pounds  English 2-row malt
                       1/2-1 pound crystal malt
                       3 ounces    Fuggles hops (boil)
                       3/4 ounce   Hallertauer hops (finish)
                                   ale yeast

     Procedure:

     You'll get good yield and lots of flavor from English malt and a 1-stage
     150 degree mash. In the boil, I added the finishing hops in  increments:
     1/4  ounce  in last 30 minutes, 1/4 ounce in last 15  minutes,  and  1/4
     ounce at the end (steep 15 minutes) don't have to be Fuggles; almost any
     boiling  hops  will do, I usually mix Northern Brewer  with  Fuggles  or
     Goldings  (just make sure you get .12-.15 alpha). Conversion  will  pro-
     bably  only take 60 minutes rather than 90. Depending on when  you  stop
     the mash your gravity may vary as high as 1.050. That's a lot of body!

     Comments:

     This  is  a simple all-grain recipe for a good pale ale  that  lets  the
     beginner  concentrate  on the mashing process. Hallertauer  may  not  be
     traditional for ales, but neither is a modern piano for sonatas.  But  I
     think Beethoven himself would have used one if he had one.

     Specifics:

     Original Gravity: up to 1.050
     Final Gravity: up to 1.020

     Digest: Issue #57, 1/24/89

     Ingredients:

                         5 pounds     pale malt
                         1 pound      crystal malt
                         1 teaspoon   gypsum
                         3-1/2 pounds pale dry extract
                         1-1/3 pounds light brown sugar
                         1 ounce      Willamette hops (boil)
                         1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer hops
                         1 teaspoon   Irish moss
                         1 ounce      Clusters hops pellets
                                      Red Star ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash pale malt, crystal malt, and gypsum in 2-3/4 gallons of 170  degree
     water;  this should give initial heat of 155 degrees (pH 5.0).  Maintain
     temperature at 140-155 degrees for 2 hours. Sparge. To wort, add extract
     and  brown  sugar.  Boil  with Willamette hops.  After  15  minutes  add
     Hallertauer and Irish moss. Dry hop with clusters and steep. When  cool,
     add wort to carboy and pitch yeast.

     The  posted  recipe called for 4 pounds of dry extract with 2  cups  re-
     served for priming. This seemed excessive and a good way to get  explod-
     ing  bottles,  so we reduced the amount of extract to 3-1/2  pounds  and
     assumed that standard priming techniques would be used, maybe  replacing
     corn sugar with 3/4 to 1 cup of malt extract. --- Ed.

     Comments:

     Notice  that  I  screwed up the hops: Clusters are  for  bittering,  and
     Willamette (or Fuggles) for aromatic.

     Ingredients:

                    1/2 pound    crystal malt
                    3.3 pounds   unhopped amber extract
                    3.3 pounds   unhopped light extract

                                 Whitbread ale yeast

     Comments:

     This produced a wonderful beer, except that it was just too sweet for my
     likings.  I shouldn't complain too much, all my friends thought  it  was
     great!  I tried several variations of this, and all worked out well, but
     were  too  sweet for me. Several people suggested cutting  back  on  the
     crystal  and I may try that.  I have also tried using a lager  yeast  to
     create a steam beer.

     Ingredients:

              1 can        Alexanders Sun Country pale malt extract
              3.3 pounds   Northwestern Amber malt extract
              1/2 pound    dark crystal malt
              3 ounces     CFJ-90 Fresh hops
              1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
                           ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Put  all grains in brewpot with cool water. Remove when boil  commences.
     Add malt extract and 1-1/2 ounce of hops. Boil 1 hour. Strain out  boil-
     ing  hops  and add 1/2 ounce more hops and Irish moss. Boil  5  minutes.
     Remove from heat and add another 1/2 ounce of hops. Steep 10 minutes and
     cool.  Strain  wort  into primary fermenter with cold water  to  make  5
     gallons. Add final 1/2 ounce of hops.

     Comments:

     Water was filtered with a simple activated carbon system. This seems  to
     make a big difference. Amateur judge commented, "Beautiful color.  A bit
     under  carbonated. Great hop nose and finishes very clean. Good  balance
     with  malt  and hops, but lighten up on finishing hops a  bit  and  it's
     perfect. Very marketable."

                 2 cups      corn sugar
                 3/4 cup     medium crystal malt
                 1/4 cup     black patent malt
                 3-3/4 ounce Cascade hops pellets (4.4 alpha)
                 1-1/5 ounce Willamette hops pellets (4.0 alpha)
                             Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 10-gallon recipe; cut ingredients in half for 5 gallons. Steep
     grains in a mesh bag until water reaches boiling. Remove grains.  Follow
     standard  extract  brewing process, adding extract and Cascade  hops.  I
     boiled  the wort in an 8-gallon pot and added 4 gallons of  cold  water.
     Pitch  yeast at about 80 degrees. I fermented this in a  20-gallon  open
     container for 4 days, then racked to glass carboys for 24 days.

     Comments:

     This  is a pale ale recipe I used for my class. I used M&F pale  extract
     and  grains were for demonstration more than flavor. I suggest  doubling
     grain quantities if you want to get something out of them.

     Ingredients:

                  2 cans   Pilsner/Lager or American light malt
                  15 cups  corn sugar
                  2 jars   Lyle's golden syrup (22 oz.)
                  2-1/2    ounces Hallertauer hops
                  2 pounds flaked maize
                  1 pack   BrewMagic yeast

     Procedure:

     In  1 gallon water, boil malt, golden syrup, sugar and 1-1/2 ounce  hops
     for 8 minutes. Add remaining hops and boil another 2 minutes. Pour  into
     primary fermenter with 2 gallons water. Bring another gallon of water to
     a  boil and add flaked maize. Turn off heat and 1/3 pack  of  BrewMagic.
     Let  sit 10 minutes. Add another 1/3 pack of BrewMagic. Let sit 10  more
     minutes. Strain maize into primary fermenter, and rinse with cold water.
     Discard maize. Fill primary to 5 gallon mark.

     Comments:

     This  recipe comes from Craig McTyre at Wine & Brew By You.  The  Lyle's
     syrup  is  available in many grocery stores, usually  located  near  the
     pancake syrup. BrewMagic is some sort of yeast nutrient/additive. It  is
     available from Wine & Brew By You.

     Ingredients:

                      8 pounds   2-row pale malt
                      1 pound    Munich malt
                      1/2 cup    dextrin malt
                      1 teaspoon gypsum
                      20 grams   Nugget leaf hops (14 alpha)
                      15 grams   Brambling leaf hops
                      pinch      Irish moss
                      1 pack     Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Use  the  standard temperature-controlled mash  procedure  described  in
     Papazian. Use a 30 minute protein rest at 122 degrees, 20 minutes at 152
     degrees,  and  20 minutes at 158 degrees. Sparge with 4 gallons  of  180
     degree  water. Boil 1 hour with Nugget hops. Add Irish moss in  last  10
     minutes. Remove from heat and steep Brambling hops for 15 minutes.  Cool
     wort and pitch.

     Comments:

     This ale is light in color, but full-bodied. If you want an amber color,
     add a cup of caramel malt. I get a strong banana odor in most of my ales
     (from the Edme I believe) which subsides after 2-3 weeks in the  bottle.
     If  you don't have the capacity for 9 pounds of malt, you could  substi-
     tute  some extract for the pale malt. Just thinking about this makes  me
     want to speed home and have a cool one.

     Ingredients:

                   8 pounds     Klages malt
                   1 pound      flaked barley
                   1/2 pound    toasted Klages malt
                   1/2 pound    Cara-pils malt
                   1-1/2 ounces (12.4 AAUs) Perle hops (boil)
                   1/2 ounce    Willamette hops (finish)
                   1 teaspoon   gypsum
                   1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                   14 grams     Muntona ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  1/2  pound of Klages malt was toasted in a 350 degree oven  for  10
     minutes.  The  mash  was done  using  Papazian's  temperature-controlled
     method.  The  Willamette hops are added after the boil,  while  chilling
     with  an  immersion chiller. The yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup  of  100
     degree water.

     Comments:

     Perle pale was a beautiful light-golden ale, crisp yet full-bodied.

                    4 pounds  mild malt
                    2 pounds  crystal malt (80L)
                    1/2 pound English pale malt
                    1/2 pound flaked barley
                    1/5 pound chocolate malt
                    1 ounce   Willamette leaf hops (5.9% alpha)
                    1/8 ounce Cascade leaf hops (6.7% alpha)

                              yeast

     Procedure:

     Water  was  treated with 2 gm each MgSO4, CaSO4, KCl,  and  CaCO3.  Mash
     grains in 3 gallons of water at 134 degrees. Hold 120-125 degrees for 55
     minutes,  raise to 157 degrees for 55 minutes. Raise to 172 degrees  for
     15  minutes. Sparge with 5-3/4 gallons water. Boil 15 minutes. Add  bit-
     tering  hops. Boil 55 minutes. Add finishing hops and boil 5  more  min-
     utes. Chill and pitch with Sierra Nevada or Wyeast Northern  Whiteshield
     yeast. Ferment and bottle or keg.

     Comments:

     This  is the only beer I can make 10 gallons of on my stove. I mash  and
     boil 5 gallons and then add 5 gallons of cooling water. The Wyeast makes
     this a beer a bit sweet and rich beyond its gravity. Emphasis is on  the
     malt, with crystal and chocolate bringing up the rear; hops were notice-
     able, but not in the foreground.

     Digest: Issue #402, 4/19/90

     Ingredients (for 2 gallons):

             2-1/2 pounds pale malt
             5 ounces     crystal malt (80L)
             5.5 AAUs     bittering hops (1 ounce of 5.5% Willamette)
             1/2 ounce    finishing hops (Willamette)
                          Wyeast #1028: London ale

     Procedure:

     This  is  a  2-gallon batch. Mash in 5 quarts 132  degrees  (140  degree
     strike  heat). Adjust mash pH to 5.3. Boost temperature to 150  degrees.
     Mash  2  hours, maintaining temperature at 146-152 degrees. Mash  out  5
     minutes at 168 degrees. Sparge with 2 gallons of 165 degree water.  Boil
     90  minutes,  adding  hops in last hour. Add finishing  hops  5  minutes
     before end of boil. Ferment at 70 degrees, 6 days in primary, 4 days  in
     secondary.

     Comments:

     If you haven't tried mashing yet, you really should. You can start small
     and  grow  as equipment and funds permit. Also, by starting  small,  you
     don't have a large sum invested in equipment if you decide mashing isn't
     for you.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds  Steinbart's amber ale extract
                     1 pound   cracked crystal malt
                     1/8 pound cracked roasted malt
                     2 ounces  Cascade or other strong hops

                               yeast

     Procedure:

     Comments:

     This  brew results in a chill haze, which I don't pay any  attention  to
     since I don't care (I don't wash my windshield very often either). I  am
     so impressed with this ale that I can't seem to make enough of it.  This
     is  a good pale ale, but not an excellent pale ale. It  lacks  sweetness
     and aroma.

                        1 cup     corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash  the  3 pounds of plain malted barley  using  the  temperature-step
     process for partial grain recipes described in Papazian's book. Boil  30
     minutes,  then add the Blue Ribbon extract (the cheap stuff you  get  at

     Ingredients:

                   5 to 6 pounds Alexander's pale malt extract
                   1/2 pound     crystal malt, crushed
                   10 ounces     dextrose (optional)
                   1-1/4 ounces  Cascade hops (boil)
                   1/4 ounce     Cascade hops (finish)
                                 Munton & Fison ale yeast
                                 corn sugar for priming

     Procedure:

     Steep crystal malt and sparge twice. Add extract and dextrose and  bring
     to  boil. Add Cascade hops and boil 60 minutes. In last few minutes  add
     remaining 1/4 ounce of Cascade (or dry hop, if desired). Chill and pitch
     yeast.

     Comments:

     This really shouldn't be too highly carbonated. This is a  well-balanced
     brew with good maltiness and bitterness. It was good when fresh,  albeit
     cloudy, but this is okay in a pale ale. After 2 months of refrigeration,
     it  is  crystal clear and still delicious!  (And there's only  1  bottle
     left.)  By the way, Munton & Fison yeast is very  aggressive---fermenta-
     tion can be done in 24-72 hours. I hope you like this as much as I do.

     Ingredients (for 10 gallons):

                  10 pounds   English pale malt (DME) extract
                  4 ounces    Cascade hops pellets (boil)
                  2 ounces    Hallertauer hops pellets (finish)
                  4 teaspoons gypsum
                  2 packs     Edme ale yeast
                  1-1/2 cups  corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 10 gallons. Bring 3 gallons of water to a boil. Add  4
     teaspoons  of  gypsum,  four ounces of hops, and 10 pounds  of  the  DME
     extract.  Bring  to boil. Boil 45 minutes. Add 2 ounces  of  Hallertauer
     hops in last 1 minute of boil. Strain wort into large vessel  containing
     additional  7  gallons of water (we used a 55 gallon trash  can).  Allow
     wort to cool and siphon into 5-gallon carboys. Add yeast.

     Caveat  Brewor: Trash cans are generally not food-grade plastic,  digest
     wisdom  calls for avoiding non-food-grade plastic. Brewer discretion  is
     advised. -Ed.

     Comments:

     This  is more hoppy than most of the Old Style/Schaefer persuasion  seem
     to prefer. If you think it's too much, cut back.

     Ingredients:

                     6-7 pounds pale malt (2-row)
                     1 pound    crystal malt
                     1 pound    demarara or dark brown sugar
                     1 ounce    Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                     1 ounce    Fuggles hops (boil 30 min.)
                     1/2 ounce  Fuggles hops (finish)
                                ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This  is an all-grain recipe---follow the instructions for  an  infusion
     mash  in Papazian, or another text. The Northern Brewer hops are  boiled
     for  a  full hour, the Fuggles for 1/2 hour, and the  Fuggles  finishing
     hops  after  the wort is removed from the heat, it is  then  steeped  15
     minutes.

     Comments:

     I'm  a  hophead (as you may have guessed). Purists may object  to  brown
     sugar  in  beer, but a careful tasting of Bass reveals  brown  sugar  or
     molasses  in  the finish---not as strong as in Newcastle,  but  present.
     British malt, in particular, can easily stand up to a bit of sugar, both
     in flavor and in gravity.

     Ingredients:

               3 pounds   Munton & Fison light DME
               3 pounds   M&F amber DME
               1 pound    crystal malt
               2.6 ounces Fuggles hops (4.7% alpha= 12.22 AAU)
               1 ounce    Kent Goldings hops (5.9% alpha = 5.9 AAU)
               pinch      Irish moss
               1 pack     Brewer's Choice #1098 (British ale yeast)

     Procedure:

     Break  seal of yeast ahead of time and prepare a starter solution  about
     10 hours before brewing.

     Bring 2 gallons water to boil with crushed crystal malt. Remove  crystal
     when  boil  starts.  Fill to 6 gallons and add  DME.  After  boiling  10
     minutes,  add Fuggles. At 55 minutes, add a pinch of Irish moss.  At  58
     minutes, add Kent Goldings. Cool (I used an immersion chiller) to  about
     80 degrees. Pitch yeast and ferment for about a week. Rack to  secondary
     for 5 days. Keg.

     Comments:

     This is based on Russ Schehrer's Carp Ale from the 1986 Zymurgy  special
     issue.  The beer has a light hops flavor and could use some work on  the
     mouth feel. It is also a bit cloudy.

     Ingredients (for 4 gallons):

                          3.75 pounds Cooper's Ale kit
                          1 pound     Crystal malt
                          3/4 pound   Saaz hops (boil)
                          3/4 ounce   Saaz hops (finish)
                                      Yeast from ale kit

     Procedure:

     Steep  one  pound of crystal malt for 30 minutes in 2  quarts  of  water
     heated  to 170 degrees. Strain out grains. Add the syrup from  the  kit,
     water,  3/4 ounce of Saaz hops and boil for 60 minutes, then remove  the
     heat  and  added 3/4 ounce of Saaz hops for finishing. Although I  am  a
     fanatic  for liquid yeast, I (grimaced and) added the dry Coopers  yeast
     supplied  with the kit to the cooled wort in the primary. I  transferred
     to  secondary after two days.  All fermentation was at approximately  60
     degrees. I primed with 5/8 cup of corn sugar.

     Very similar in taste, body, and color (where did the red come from?) to
     Samuel Adams, but just a hint of the flavor of Anchor Steam Beer.

                4 pounds     Geordie amber DME
                1 pound      crushed Crystal Malt
                1-1/2 ounces Cascade leaf hops (boil 60 minutes)
                1-1/2 ounces Cascade leaf hops (finishing)
                1 teaspoon   Irish Moss
                             Wyeast #1056 Chico Ale Yeast
                             (1 quart starter made 2 days prior)

     Procedure:

     Add the crystal malt to cold water and apply heat. Simmer for 15 minutes
     or so then sparge into boiling kettle. Add DME, top up kettle and  bring
     to boil. When boil starts, add boiling hops and boil for 60 minutes.  10
     minutes  before end of boil add 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss. When  boil  is
     complete, remove heat, add finishing hops and immediately begin chilling
     wort.  Strain wort into fermenter and pitch yeast starter. Primary  fer-
     mentation took about 4 days. Let the beer settle for another 2 days  and
     then  rack to a sanitized, primed (1/3 cup boiled corn  sugar  solution)
     and oxygen purged keg and apply some CO2 blanket pressure.

     Comments:

     After  one  week  in the keg the beer was clear,  carbonated,  and  very
     drinkable  although  it had a very noticeable alcoholic  nose.  After  2
     weeks the beer was incredibly smooth, bitter, and wonderfully  aromatic.
     Several friends raved about this beer including one who lived in England
     for  a while said that this was one of the best IPAs he's ever  had  and
     definitely the best homebrew he's ever had. After 2-1/2 weeks it was all
     gone because we drank the whole thing.

                 3/4 cup    Corn sugar (bottling)

     Procedure:

     About a week before, make a starter from 2 bottles of Sierra Nevada Pale
     Ale.  Use  about 4 tablespoons of plain light malt extract syrup  and  a
     couple of hop pellets.

     Boil  major ingredients, ala Complete Joy of Home Brewing, in 2  gallons
     of water. (60 minute boil). Add 1/3 ounce Chinook hops at start of boil,
     1/3  ounce Chinnook at 30 minutes and 1/3 ounce of Cascade hops  in  the
     last  two minutes of the boil. Then combine with 3 gallons of  ice  cold
     tap  water  (which  was boiled the previous night,  and  cooled  in  the
     freezer)  in a 7 gallon carboy. Ferment in primary for a week.  Put  1/2
     ounce  of  Cascade  pellets in bottom of secondary and  rack  beer  into
     secondary. Bottle three weeks later.

     Comments:

     This a report on my second use of "maltose" (a cheap rice malt available
     from  most Oriental Markets). In the previous attempt ("Number 17",  see
     HBD #541 or The Cat's Meow: p 36) there were a few problems. It was also
     my first attempt at culturing yeast (from a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale), and
     for  various reasons, it didn't work very well. The other problem was  I
     used  to  much maltose, about 40%, which made the result  a  little  too
     light. This time I decided to use about 20% maltose, which IMHO, is just
     about right. I've also since perfected yeast culturing.  The result is a
     nice  thirst  quenching, summer ale, which, with my favorite  pizza,  is
     heaven*2. Taste: Excellent!

     Ingredients (for 11 gallons):

              19 pounds    2 row Klages
              3 pounds     Munich malt
              2 pounds     40L crystal malt
              1-1/2 pounds 2 row Klages, toasted (see below)
              2 pounds     wheat malt
              2 ounces     Northern Brewer hops (AA 6.9)
              6 ounces     Cascade hops (AA 5.1)
              1 teaspoon   Gypsum
              2 teaspoon   Irish moss Chico Ale yeast (wyeast 1056)
              1-1/2 cups   corn sugar to prime

     Procedure:

     Toast  1-1/2 pounds of 2 row Klages malt in oven at 350 degrees  for  40
     minutes.  Allow  to age a couple of weeks before use. Treat  mash  water
     with  1 teaspoon of gypsum. Mash grains in a single temperture  infusion
     for  90 minutes at 155 degrees. Mash out for 10 minutes at 170  degrees.
     Sparge with 11 gallons of 168 degree water. Bring to a boil and boil for
     90 minutes.  Add 2 ounces of Northern Brewer hops at 10 minutes into the
     boil. Add Irish Moss in last 30 minutes of boil. Turn off heat and add 2
     ounces of Cascade hops for a 10 minute steep. Chill. Pitch yeast.  After
     one week, rack to secondary and add 4 ounces of Cascade hops. Bottle  or
     keg when ferment is complete.

     Comments:

     This  is a big, hoppy brew, loaded with aromatic cascade hop  fragrance.
     It has that front of the mouth bitterness that can only be achieved with
     dry hoping, so don't skip it if you really want to duplicate this flavor
     profile.

     Ingredients:

                   9 pounds  Pale ale malt
                   1 pound   crystal malt
                   3/4 pound Brown sugar
                   1/2 pound malto-dextrins (or 3/4# cara pils)
                   2 ounces  Williamette (60m)
                   1/2 ounce Williamette Whitbred dry yeast

     Procedure:

     This  is an infusion mash at 156 degrees.  Sparge, and add brown  sugar,
     and  malto-dextrins.  Bring to boil and add 2 ounces  Williamette  hops.
     After 60 minutes, turn off heat and steep 1/2 ounce Williamette hops for
     10-15 minutes.

     Comments:

     My notes say that it was close in flavour but a bit light in both colour
     and body compared to the real thing.

     Ingredients:

                   7 pounds  Steinbart's American Light Extract
                   1 pound   Crystal malt 40L
                   1 pound   Dark brown sugar
                             Be damned German purity law!
                   1 ounce   Northern Brewer (60 minute boil)
                   1 ounce   Fuggle (30 minute boil)
                   1/2 ounce Fuggle (10 minute boil)
                   1/2 ounce Fuggle (15 minute seep)
                             yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  malt  and remove grains before  boil  begins.  Add  malt
     extract and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and boil for 60 minutes. Add  1
     ounce  Northern  Brewer at beginning of boil, 1 ounce of  Fuggle  at  30
     minutes  and 1/2 ounce of Fuggle for the last 10 minutes. Turn off  heat
     and  add final 1/2 ounce Fuggle. Let steep for 15 minutes.  Cool.  Pitch
     yeast.

     Comments:

     I  did a side by side comparison last night. The real Bass  is  slightly
     darker, more malty and more bitter with less hop flavor than I remember.
     I suspect that my sample bottle of Bass was not freshest (but that's one
     of  the reasons we homebrew!). The homebrew Bass has significantly  more
     fuggle  hop  aroma and flavor. I'd like to think that my  version  is  a
     "Northwest style" Bass. To better approach the real Bass, eliminate  the
     1/2  ounce of fuggles for the 10 minute boil, and steep the finish  hops
     for 5 minutes. I would also try 80L crystal.

                  3/4 pound   Crystal Malt
                  1/2 pound   Carapils Malt
                  1-1/2 ounce (4.9%) Kent Goldings (60 Minutes)
                  1-1/2 ounce (4.9%) Kent Goldings (15 Minutes)
                  1/4 ounce   Kent Goldings (dry)
                  1 teaspoon  Irish Moss (15 Minutes)
                  2 teaspoons Gypsum

                              Wyeast 1059 American Ale

     Procedure:

     Mash  pale malt at 153 F for 30-60 minutes. Test after 30  minutes.  Add
     Crystal and Carapils and mash-out at 168 F for 10 minutes. Sparge. Bring
     to  boil. In a saucepan, boil the oak for no more than 10 minutes,  then
     strain the liquid into your boiling kettle. Boil the wort, adding  boil-
     ing  hops after 30 minutes and the flavor hops and Irish Moss  after  75
     minutes. Chill and pitch a quart of 1059 starter.

     Dry hop in the secondary fermenter. The beer will clear in the bottle.

     Comments:

     I've fallen head over heels in love with 1059 American Ale Yeast. I find
     it  gives wonderful pear and rasberry aromatics, and if I have a  carboy
     filled to the shoulder, I *don't* need a blow-off tube. It gives a  very
     gentle fermentation with a relatively short thick kraeusen. Worts in the
     1.050's  take 5-6 days. I get the same type of fermentations at 60 F  or
     72 F.

     It does take this yeast a little while to clear. I find it clears faster
     in the bottle than in the secondary, so I only use a secondary for a few
     days as my "dry hop tun".

     Specifics:

     Primary Ferment: 7 days
     Secondary Ferment: 5 days

     Chinook  at  24  BU, Cascade at 12 BU, Cascade at 9  dry  hopped  (total
     45BU). OG=1.062. Later, he wins first place in the Pale Ale catagory  in
     the  1991 AHA Nationals with a recipe that uses 14 pounds Klages,  4  oz
     40L  crystal, 4 oz 90L crystal (and of course different hops  :-).  This
     had  a  OG=1.062 and TG=1.010. He mashed all grains for  90  minutes  at

     Comments:

     About  four years ago I ordered a bottle of Full Sail Ale  while  having
     lunch in Portland, Oregon. Full Sail was the most expensive beer on  the
     menu,  and I figured that at $2.75 a bottle I didn't have much to  lose.
     Several  others  who  were with me did the  same,  and  were  pleasantly
     surprized---Full  Sail offers a reasonably complex (a hint of  sweetness
     along  with medium strong hops and a rich malty flavor) taste and  aroma
     in a medium-bodied ale.

     Since  I first tasted this ale, I had to rely on others making trips  to
     the  Northwest to bring back six packs of this ale. A few months ago,  I
     visited the Hood River Brewing Company in Hood River, Oregon. I was able
     to get enough information to experiment with a homebrew recipe for  Full
     Sail Ale. My first experiment turned out remarkably similar to the  real
     thing in body, aroma, and flavor.

                       3.3 pounds plain light malt extract
                       2 ounces   roast barley

                                  gypsum and Irish moss, if necessary

     Procedure:

     This is a 5 gallon batch. Boil up a couple of gallons of water, add  DME
     and LME, fuggles, and 1 ounce of goldings. Make tea out of roast barley,
     and  strain  into main boiler. Make tea out of crystal malt  and  strain
     into main boiler. (Half way through boil add local water ingredients and
     Irish  moss if required). After boil, add 1/2 ounce of  Goldings,  cover
     and  let stand for 15 minutes. Pour into primary, make up to  5  gallons
     and  pitch  yeast.  Rack  and  add  1/4  ounce  Goldings  and   complete
     fermentation.

     Comments:

     This was a little hoppy for my taste. I'd probably cut out the 1/4 ounce
     of  Goldings  at  the  end... Other than that,  it  made  an  incredible

            1/2 pound    toasted malt (see below)
            1/2 teaspoon gypsum (to harden water)
                         Lactic Acid
                         (enough to bring mash water to pH 5.2)
            2 ounces     Northern Brewer hops (7.1% alpha - boil)
            1 ounce      Cascade hops (6.0% alpha - finish)
            1/4 ounce    Fuggle or Styrian Golding hop pellets (dry hop)
            1 ounce      Oak Chips (optional)

            1 teaspoon   Irish Moss
            3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Spread  2-row  Klages  on cookie sheet and toast at  350  degrees  until
     reddish brown in color.

     Mash grain in 12 quarts mash water (treated with gypsum and lactic acid)
     at  154  degrees until conversion is complete. Sparge  with  170  degree
     water  to collect 6 gallons. Bring wort to boil and boil for 15  minutes
     before adding hops. Add 1/2 of boiling hops. Boil for 30 minutes and add
     remaining boiling hops. Boil for another 45 minutes and add Irish  moss.
     Boil  for a final 30 minutes. Total boiling time is 2 hours.  Cut  heat,
     add  aromatic  hops,  and let rest for 15 minutes,  or  until  trub  has
     settled.  Force  cool wort to yeast pitching  temperature.  Transfer  to
     primary  fermenter and pitch yeast. Add dry hops at end of primary  fer-
     mentation.  Transfer  to  clean, sterile  carboy  when  fermentation  is
     complete.  Boil oak chips for one minute to sterilize and add chips  and
     gelatin  to  carboy.  Age until desired oak flavor  is  achieved.  Allow
     bottled beer to age two weeks before consuming.

              3 imperial gallons water for bitter brewing (hardened)
              2 ounces   Fuggles
              1 ounce    Goldings for 30 minutes
              1/2 ounce  Goldings for 15 minutes
              1/4 ounce  Goldings for 10 minutes
              1 teaspoon Irish moss
              1 pound    invert sugar
              2 ounces   yeast
              1/2 ounce  gelatin
              2 ounces   soft dark brown sugar

     Procedure:

     Raise the temperature of the water to 60C and stir in the crushed malts.
     Stirring continuously, raise the mash temperature up to 66C.  Leave  for
     1 1/2 hours, occasionally returning the temperature back to this  value.
     Contain the mashed wort in a large grain bag to retrieve the sweet wort.
     Using slightly hotter water than the mash, rinse the grains to collect 4
     gallons  (UK) (20 litres) of extract. Boil the extract with the  fuggles
     hops and the first batch of goldings for 1 1/2 hours. Dissolve the  main
     batch of sugar in a little hot water and add this during the boil.  Also
     pitch in the Irish moss as directed on the instructions. Switch off  the
     heat, stir in the second batch of goldings and allow them to soak for 20
     mins. Strain off the clear wort into a fermenting bin and top up to  the
     final  quantity with cold water. When cool to room temperature  add  the
     yeast.  Ferment  4-5 days until the specific gravity falls to  1012  and
     rack  into gallon jars or a 25 litre polythene cube. Apportion  gelatine
     finings and the rest of the dry hops before fitting airlocks. Leave  for
     7 days before racking the beer from the sediment into a primed  pressure
     barrel or polythene cube. Allow 7 days before sampling.

     Comments:

     Gallons  are  British Imperial gallons, which equal  1.2  U.S.  gallons.
     Quantities will need to be adjusted if you use U.S. gallons. The  recipe
     comes  from  Dave  Line's Brewing Beers Like Those You  Buy.  Water  for
     bitter  brewing means hard water. If you're on soft water  (your  kettle
     doesn't fur up) then add some water treatment salts or even a couple  of
     spoonfulls of plaster of paris.

     Invert sugar is sugar that has been cooked for a couple of minutes  over


                                       40.

     a low flame. I just use the sugar (normally a soft brown suger, not that
     'orrible white granulated.)

     I  use isinglass finings instead of Gelatine, it's less messy  and  does
     the  same  job (slightly more expensive  though).  Isinglass  apparently
     comes from the sexual organs of certain fish. Makes you wonder what else
     the ancient brewers tried!

                      2 pounds     Cara-pils malt
                      2 pounds     light crystal malt
                      1 pound      extra rich crystal malt
                      1/2 ounce    Hallertauer (5.0% alpha)
                      1 ounce      Willamette (4.5 alpha)
                      1 teaspoon   salt

                      1 teaspoon   yeast nutrient
                      1 tablespoon Irish moss
                                   Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash cara-pils and crystal malt for 2 hours in 140 degree water.  Sparge
     to  make  4 gallons. Add syrup and Hallertauer hops. Boil  60   minutes,
     adding Irish moss in last 30 minutes. Decant to primary,  adding  enough
     water to make 5 gallons. Add salt, citric acid, yeast  nutrient, and dry
     hop with Willamette hops.

     Comments:

     A year or so ago I went to a party where the host had about 20 different
     types  of good beer. One was a German malz bier that was  delicious!  It
     has  a  wonderful  sweet, malty, full-bodied flavor.   Working   on  the
     assumption  that its body is achieved with dextrin and crystal  malt,  I
     cooked up this recipe. The intent is to have all or most of  the dextrin
     and  caramelized maltose remain after fermentation for the   malz  taste
     and body.

     Ingredients:

                       7 pounds     Klages malt
                       3 pounds     Vienna malt
                       6 ounces     pearl barley
                       1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer leaf hops

                                    Wyeast #2206

     Procedure:

     Soak  the  pearl  barley overnight in the refrigerator, mix  it  into  a
     starchy  glue  using a blender. Mash the pearl barley with  the  grains.
     Boil 1-1/2 ounces of Hallertauer with the wort. Add 1/4 ounce of finish-
     ing hops in last 10 minutes and steep 1/4 ounce after boil is  complete.
     Pitch yeast at about 76 degrees.

     I put the fermenter in fridge for 23 days, then racked to secondary  for
     another 49 days before bottling.

     This is a wonderful Munich-style lager that I would like to think rivals
     Andechs (I aim high).

     Ingredients:

                       3.3 pounds Northwest malt extract
                       1 pound    light dry malt
                       1/2 pound  Munich malt
                       2 pounds   Klages malt
                       1 ounce    Hallertauer hops (5.1 alpha)
                       1/4 ounce  Nugget hops (11.0 alpha)

                                  Wyeast #2042: Danish

     Procedure:

     Start  yeast  ahead  of time. Mash Munich  and  Klages  malts  together.
     Sparge.  Add  extract  and boiling hops. Boil one  hour.  Add  finishing
     hops. Chill to 75-80 degrees. Pitch yeast. When airlock shows signs   of
     activity  (about  6  hours)  put fermenter in  the  refrigerator  at  42
     degrees.  After one  week, rack to secondary and ferment at  38  degrees
     for two more weeks.  Bottle or keg.

     Comments:

     This beer tastes great and is very clean. There are, however, two things
     I  will  do next time: add more bitterness (perhaps  10-11  HBUs),   and
     second, add more malt.

                       2.2 pounds maltose

                                  cultured Sierra Nevada yeast

     Procedure:

     The  maltose is a cheap rice-malt mix obtainable from oriental  markets.
     Boil malt, hops, and maltose in 2-1/2 gallons of cold water. In last   2
     minutes,  add the finishing hops. The yeast was cultured from a   bottle
     of  Sierra Nevada pale ale. By the next day, the yeast did not  seem  to
     start,  so I added a packet of Vierrka lager yeast. Rack  to   secondary
     after  one week. After another week, prime with 3/4 cup corn  sugar  and
     bottle.

     Comments:

     Color  similar to any American lager. Tastes much better,  very  mellow.
     The  goal  was to brew 5 gallons of beer while only spending  $10.  This
     came  to about $11. I'm not sure what drives me to such frugalness,  but
     having  grown up with American beer, sometimes I would rather  have   it
     with certain foods, like pizza.

     Rack  off trub.  Pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 degrees for 3 days. Rack  to
     secondary  and lager 18 days at 42 degrees. After 18 days keg and  lager
     an additional 17 days.

     Comments:

     This  brew was dark brown-red with a distinct nutty flavor  coming  from
     the toasted malt barley. A good head, little chill haze.

     Ingredients:

                 4 pound can  Alexander's Pale malt extract syrup
                 2-1/3 pounds light dry malt extract
                 15 AAU's     Saaz hops
                              Wyeast 2007 Bohemian Pilsner yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring extracts and 2 gallons of water to boil. Add 5 AAU's of Saaz  hops
     at beginning of boil. Add 5 AAU's again at 30 minutes and at 10 minutes.
     Pitch yeast when cool.

     Comments:

     The yeast I used produced a very clean, clear beer and I'd recommend  it
     highly. It you haven't gotten into liquid yeast cultures yet, do it  for
     this batch. The difference is tremendous. Also I feel the key to success
     here are:

          The lightest extract you can find.

          Fresh hops or pellets packed in Nitrogen (only Saaz will do).

          Liquid yeast fermented at a steady low temp.

     Ingredients:

             6.6 pounds  John Bull light malt extract
             3 pounds    Klages malt
             1/2 pound   chocolate malt
             2-3/4 ounce 4.7% AAU Willamette flowers (60 minute boil)
             1/2 ounce   4.7% Willamette flowers (2 minute steep)
                         lager yeast (I used MeV)
                         10 grams Burton salts

     Procedure:

     Bring  3  qt + 2 cups of water to 130 degrees. Add  cracked  Klages  and
     chocolate  malts  (temp = 122 degrees). Rest 30 min. Add 7 cups  of  200
     degrees water to bring temp up to 150 degrees. Rest 30 min. Bring up  to
     158  degrees  with  burner. Rest 20 minutes. Mash out  at  170  degrees.
     Sparge  with 7 quarts of 170 degrees water, recycling the first  runoff.
     Add  malt extract and boil as normal. Chill the wort and  pitch.  Aerate
     vigorously  with  a hollow plastic tube...there's no need to  get  fancy
     equipment here. With the hollow tube I can whip up a 3" head of froth on
     the chilled wort. Bubbling activity is almost always evident within 8-10
     hours  of pitching a 12-18 oz starter solution.  Ferment as you would  a
     lager.

     Comments:

     Don't  worry...give partial mashing a try. Before doing it,  my  biggest
     worry was how to keep the temperature constant. During each phase of the
     mash, I only had to add heat once to keep it within a degree or so.

     Digest: Issue #732, 9/26/91

     Ingredients:

                       3.3 pounds   M&F light extract
                       1 pound      Malted wheat
                       3/4 ounce    Hallertauer (boiling)
                       1/4 ounce    Hallertauer (finishing)
                       2 teaspoon   Gypsum
                       1/4 teaspoon Alpha Amylase
                       1 teaspoon   Irish Moss
                       3/4 cup      Dextrose (for priming)
                                    Wyeast Pilsner Culture

     Procedure:

     Mash  the  wheat with Alpha Amylase at 135 degrees for 1-3  hours  in  1
     quart of water. Test with Iodine. Sparge with 3 quarts of water and boil
     before adding the extract to avoid enzymatic changes to the barley malt.
     Irish  Moss for the last 10 minutes of the boil and the  finishing  hops
     for  the  last  2 minutes. Ferment at 40-45 degrees for  6  weeks  to  3
     months.  I found that all the starch completed conversion at the end  of
     one  hour. I held the mash temp at 130-135 in about 1 quart of water  by
     mashing  in  a microwave oven with a temperature  probe.  The  dissolved
     sugars were fairly low. SG was 1.027.

     Comments:

     My  thinking was that I wanted to extract as much fermentable sugars  as
     possible  from  the wheat I was using as an adjunct, as the wort  is  an
     extremely  light  one.  I made it lightly hopped  so  that  the  hopping
     wouldn't  overpower the tanginess of the small amount of wheat.  I  also
     lagered  to  hopefully get a smoother, less estery  quality.  You  might
     consider  mashing wheat with added enzymes. I did it because I  partial-
     mashed; you might wish to do so because of a high wheat to barley ratio.

                         1/2 pound    dextrin malt
                         1-1/2 pounds amber crystal malt

                                      Polyclar

     Procedure:

     Use standard mashing procedure. Sparge. Boil 90 minutes. Add Hallertauer
     at  beginning of boil. Add 1-1/2 ounces Cascades 30 minutes  into  boil.
     Add 1/4 oz Cascades at 60 minutes. Add final 1/4 ounces Cascades for the
     last 15 minutes. Cool. Pitch yeast. Ferment at 40 degrees for 2  months.
     Add  polyclar, rack to secondary and dry hop with 1/4 oz Hallertau  pel-
     lets  two days later. After a week move to room temperature and let  sit
     for another week. Bottle.

     Comments:

     The  wort really needed to to be dry hopped longer---the  pellets  never
     really completely dissolved, and kind of filtered themselves out in  the
     siphon. Serve very cold or very warm.

     Ingredients:

                         6 pounds  Williams wheat extract
                         1 pound   crystal malt
                         1/2 pound toasted barley
                         1 pound   honey
                         2 ounces  Cascades hops (boil)
                         1/2 ounce Cascades hops (finish)
                         1 package Wyeast wheat yeast

     Procedure:

     Make a 2-quart starter before brewing. Steep crystal and toasted  barley
     in 4 gallons water for 40 minutes (use grain bags to make this  easier).
     Add  extract,  honey and bittering hops. Boil wort for 1   hour.  Remove
     from  heat.  Add  finishing hops and steep 2 minutes.  Chill  and  pitch
     yeast. After 3 days, rack to secondary. Bottle after 8 days.

     Comments:

     This  beer  was a bit cloudy and should have some Irish  moss.  I'm  not
     really  sure what the honey added to this beer (more experimentation  is
     in  order). However, it turned out so well that I won't omit it  in  the
     future.  This  was  a  very good  extract-based  recipe  (it  well  nigh
     evaporated).

     Ingredients (for 15 gallons):

                      14 pounds wheat malt
                      8 pounds  Munich malt
                      6 pounds  2-row malt
                      90 grams  Hersbrucker hops (3.4% alpha)
                      10 grams  calcium carbonate
                                Sierra Nevada yeast

     Procedure:

     This  is a 15-gallon batch. Our beer was 50% malted wheat,  30%  Munich,
     and  20% 2-row malt. Medium soft water was used with the addition of  10
     grams CaCO4. Mash with 1-1/4 gallons water per pound of grain with rests
     at  120 degrees (1-1/2 hours), 135 degrees for 45 minutes,  148  degrees
     for  30  minutes, and 156 degrees until converted. 172  degrees  for  15
     minutes.  We took our time with the sparge: 20 minutes to settle in  the
     lauter tun, at least 30 minutes of recycling, and 1-1/2 hours to sparge.
     We  cut it off at a gravity of 1.015 because we weren't  getting  sweet-
     ness, just grainy notes.

     Comments:

     The  hot  break in the boil was the most unbelievable  thing  I've  ever
     seen. It looked like egg drop soup. We took out a sight glass and  grab-
     bed a bit and the flocks were huge---as much as 1/2 inch in diameter.

     Ingredients:

                  2 pounds     dark DME
                  2-3/4 pounds buckwheat honey
                  1 pound      crushed crystal malt
                  1/4 pound    crushed chocolate malt
                  2-1/2 ounces Cascade hops (boil)
                  1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer hops 3.6 alpha (boil)
                  3/4 ounce    Hallertauer hops (finish)
                  4 teaspoons  whole allspice
                  1 teaspoon   Irish moss
                               yeast
                  2/3 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Steep  grains in 2 gallons water while heating to boil.  Remove  grains.
     Add  extracts and honey. Boil 1 hour with boiling hops, add  1  teaspoon
     Irish moss at 30 minutes. Simmer allspice in water for 3 minutes, remove
     allspice  and  add water to primary. After fermenting, prime  with  corn
     sugar and bottle.

     Comments:

     This beer turned out very well. It has just a hint of the allspice, more
     in  the  aroma than the flavor, and is quite sweet tasting. There  is  a
     slight  bitter  hops aftertaste, but I think that if it were  any   less
     bitter, the sweetness would be overpowering. This beer will bring  color
     to your cheeks. The spice can be omitted with no great loss.

     Digest: Issue #191, 7/1/89

     Ingredients:

                  1 can     Kwoffit Bitter kit (hopped extract)
                  3 pounds  light dry malt extract
                  1 pound   crystal malt
                  1/2 pound wheat malt
                            Fuggles leaf hops
                            Kwoffit yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep the crystal and wheat malts. Boil the resulting mixture with   the
     Kwoffit kit and the light extract. Add a small amount (up to 1/2  ounce)
     of the Fuggles hops in the last minute of the boil.

     Comments:

     The result is extravagantly tasty---very rich and full-bodied,  strongly
     hopped but not tart. I am quickly becoming a believer in the value of  a
     little wheat malt for adding flavorful body. It seems to work very  well
     with crystal malt. Body, crispness, sweetness, hoppiness...heaven.

                 3.3 pounds   Northwestern amber extract
                 1/2 pound    crystal malt (crushed)
                 1/2 cup      black patent malt (lightly crushed)
                 1 teaspoon   gypsum
                 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                 2 ounces     Mt. Hood hops (8.6 AAU)
                              Wyeast Bavarian Wheat liquid yeast

     Procedure:

     The  black  patent was *VERY* lightly crushed because I  just  wanted  a
     light  brown beer---not a black beer.  The grains were steeped  to  just
     before  boil and strained out. Add extract and all of the hops. Boil  60
     minutes. Add to cold water in fermenter and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Came  out  excellent.  Not quite true to the German style,  but  a  very
     drinkable light-bodied beer, without an overwhelming wheat character.

     Ingredients (for 4 gallons):

                 1 can (3.75 pound) Telford's Wheat Beer extract
                             2 cups granulated sugar
                               3/4 ounce Saaz hops
                        1 package Wyeast London Ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  two gallows of water to a boil, then add extract. Add sugar.  Add
     1/2  oz. Saaz hops to the boil for 30 minutes. Remove heat. Add 1/4  oz.
     Saaz  hops  for  aroma.  Add cool water to bring  wort  volume  to  four
     gallons. Cool to 75 - 80 degrees. Transfer to primary and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Ridiculously simple, but very nice and light. Most people who don't like
     wheat beers like this one, and many people think that this is a  commer-
     cial  product, not homebrew! The Telfords extract is probably the  major
     factor  in the success of this recipe--done just right. You need to  put
     in  some sugar to bring up the level of fermentables, but don't  put  in
     too much, or you'll get a cidery taste. Don't follow Telford's  instruc-
     tions, which say that this kit can make five gallons---too watery.

     Ingredients:

                   3 pounds  Bavarian dry wheat extract
                   2 pounds  Clover honey
                   1/2 pound Buckwheat honey
                   1/2 pound light Crystal malt (20 lovibond?)
                   1 ounce   Centennial hops 11.1% AAU's
                             24 ounces Wyeast 1056 slurry
                             (from previous batch)

     Procedure:

     Bring  1 and a half quarts water to 170 degrees and turn off  heat.  Add
     crystal  malt  and steep for 40 min. Tempurature was 155  degrees  after
     adding malt and stirring. In another pot, start 3 gallons water boiling.
     When  it  cames to a boil, strain in liquid from crystal malt  and  also
     pour  another  quart  of hot water through the  grains.  Add  the  wheat
     extract and honey.  Bring to a boil. Skim the scum off and then add  3/4
     ounce  hops for 1 hour. Turn off heat and add the last 1/4  ounce  hops.
     Whirlpool and let stand to let the trub collect. Siphon into carboy  and
     top  to  5 gallons.  Add yeast and shake vigorously. Bottle with  4  oz.
     corn sugar.

     Comments:

     Has  a very nice floral honey/clove aroma. Nice clear golden  color.  My
     beers have been much clearer since using the whirlpool technique to  get
     rid of most of the trub before fermenting. Has a clove/wheat beer flavor
     not much honey flavor. I didn't want to use too much buckwheat honey  in
     order to let the wheat flavor come through.

     Make a yeast starter two days beforehand. Mash the three pounds of  malt
     a  la Miller. Boil for one hour, adding 1-1/2 ounces hops at the  start,
     1/2  ounce  at 30 minutes, and 1/2 ounce at 5 minutes.  Cool  and  pitch
     yeast. Ferment. Bottle.

     Comments:

     I  primed half the batch (5 gal) with 1/3 cup corn sugar and  the  other
     half  with  1/2 cup clover honey. After two weeks, the beer  was  great.
     The beer primed with honey, however, was way too carbonated. All you can
     taste  is bubbles. In direct taste tests, this beer has more  body  than
     WheatHook,  and  is  slightly  sweeter. Compared to  EKU,  the  beer  is
     similar, but EKU Wiezen is slightly sweeter.

              1/2 pound    wheat flakes

              2 ounces     Hallertauer hops (Alpha 4.2) for full boil
              1/2 ounce    Saaz hops (Alpha ??) for 20 minutes
              1/2 ounce    Saaz hops to finish
                           yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash the crystal malt, wheat malt and flaked wheat with 2 1/2 gallons of
     water  using your favorite mash method. I used a step mash, holding  for
     20  minutes  at 130 degress, 30 minutes at 150 degrees and  155  for  20
     minutes. Steep the specialty malts while bringing the rest of the  water
     to  a boil. Remove specialty grains and add extracts and wort  from  the
     mash  as boil begins. Add Hallertau hops at beginning of boil.  Add  1/2
     ounce  of  Saaz at 40 minutes. Turn off heat after 60 minutes,  and  add
     last 1/2 ounce of hops.

     Comments:

     After  2 weeks in the bottle, this was a VERY hoppy beer. In my  opinion
     it  was too hoppy for the style. The color was a beautiful amber and  it
     was very clear. After 2 months the hop bite subsided somewhat and it  is
     now  an excellent brew---crisp, clear and aggressive with a  very  white
     white head considering the color of the beer.

     This ones a little lighter, I was expecting a big difference in the  hop

     Ingredients:

                 6 pounds  light dry malt extract
                 1/2 pound toasted malt
                 3/4 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets (boil)
                 1/4 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets (finish)
                 1 pack    lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Toast  grains on cookie sheet in 350 degree oven for about  10  minutes.
     Crush  malt as you would grain. Put in 1-1/2 gallons water and bring  to
     boil. Strain out grain. Add extract and boiling hops. In last 2  minutes
     of  boil add finishing hops. Add to enough water to make 5  gallons  and
     pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     I've made many variations of steam beer, but simple ones like this  seem
     to turn out best, not to mention being easy to make. I usually use  more
     Northern Brewer than this, but then nobody will eat my chili either.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds        light dry extract
                     1-1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke
                     1-1/2 ounces    Tettnanger hops (boil)
                     1 ounce         Tettnanger hops (finish)
                     1/2 teaspoon    Irish moss
                     2 packs         Red Star lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil extract, liquid smoke, and boiling hops in 2-3 gallons of water for
     45  minutes. Add Irish moss and finishing hops and boil 5 more  minutes.
     Strain  into fermenter, add cold water to make 5 gallons,  pitch  yeast.
     After  3  days  rack to secondary. Allow to ferment  an  additional  3-4
     weeks.

     Comments:

     This  is basically a nice light beer, but with a definite  smoke  after-
     taste. Mainstream, but with a non-commercial twist.

     Ingredients:

               7 pounds      John Bull plain light malt extract
               1/4-1/2 pound crystal malt
               2 ounces      Northern Brewer hops (11 alpha) (boil)
               1 ounce       Cascade hops (5.6 alpha) (finish)
               2 packs       lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Pour  1  gallon water into brewpot.  Crush grains and  add  to  brewpot.
     Bring  to boil. Remove grains. Add malt extract. Add 1/3 of the  boiling
     hops.  After 20 minutes, add another 1/3 of hops. After another 20  min-
     utes  add  the last 1/3 of hops. After another 20 minutes,  remove  from
     heat and add finishing hops. Cover wort. Pour 3 gallons cold water  into
     fermenter.  Strain wort into fermenter along with enough water  to  make
     5-1/2 gallons. Pitch yeast and put in blowoff tube or airlock.

     Comments:

     This  recipe was offered in 1986 by the now-defunct Home Brewer shop  in
     San Jose, California, as the best approximation to Anchor Steam possible
     with home-brew-scale extract brewing.

     Ingredients:

                  9-1/2 pounds Klages malt
                  1-1/2 pounds Crystal malt 40L
                  1/2 pound    Cara Pils malt
                  2-1/2 ounces Northern Brewer whole hops, 6.9%
                               Wyeast #2007

     Procedure:

     Using  a  standard  mash procedure: Protein rest of 30  minutes  at  125
     degrees.  Raise  temperature to 155 degrees and hold for 90  minutes  or
     until  starch is converted. Sparge to collect enough that a 1 hour  boil
     will  still  leave you 5 gallons of beer (brewing -- art  or  science?).
     Bring wort to boil. Add 1-1/2 ounces of Norther Brewer at beginning, 1/2
     ounce at 30 minutes and 1/2 ounce for the last ten minutes.

     Comments:

     Side  by side with Anchor Steam, this beer was very close. The color  of
     this  beer was a bit darker, and the late hop additions gave mine a  bit
     more  hop flavor than Anchor. The bitterness was right on, but my  water
     has  pretty high sulfate content; if you have "better" water, you  might
     want to bitter it a bit more.

     Ingredients:

                  5 pounds     Klages lager malt
                  4 pounds     Pale Ale malt
                  1 pounds     crystal malt (40 or 60 deg Lovibond)
                  1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                  1-1/2 ounces Northern Brewer (alpha 8.0)
                  1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer (alpha 4.1)
                               MeV High Temp Lager liquid yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash grains for 25 minutes at 125 degrees and 90 minutes at 150 degrees.
     Mash-out  for 10 minutes at 168 degrees. Sparge. Bring to boil  and  add
     Northern  Brewer  hops.  Boil  60  minutes.  At  last  minute  toss   in
     Hallertauer. Cool. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Judges  said it was perhaps a tad thin compared to Anchor but  otherwise
     OK  and  it  took  2nd  out of 30  amber  beers  at  the  Hudson  Valley
     competition last March. With MeV kaput, I recommend using a sturdy lager
     yeast or even an ale yeast for this one.

     Ingredients:

                  6 pounds     light M&F dried malt extract
                  1 cup        English 2-row pale malt
                  1 cup        Crystal Malt 60L
                  1 cup        Crystal Malt 120L
                  1-1/2 ounces Northern Brewer hop pellets
                                 (alpha = 6.5; 50 min.)
                  1/2 teaspoon Irish Moss (15 min.)
                  1 ounce      Northern Brewer hop pellets (1 min.)

                  3/4 cup      corn sugar for priming

     Procedure:

     Toasted pale malt in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes. Cracked it  along
     with the crystal and steeped in 2 quarts of 150-175 degree water for  20
     minutes. Sparged with approx. 1 gallon of water. Dissolved DME in sparge
     water  plus  cold water to make 3 and 1/2 gallons. Boiled for  60  min.,
     adding hops and Irish Moss for indicated times. Chilled with a  2-gallon
     ice block and 20 degree outdoor temps. Racked off hot/cold break, topped
     up  to 5 gallons, pitching a 2-3 cup starter at about 90  degrees.  IBUs
     approximately  37. Single-stage fermentation for 14 days;  bottled  with
     3/4 cup priming sugar. F.G. = 1.022, a little high, but fermentation was
     definitely done.

     Comments:

     I  did  a  side-by-side comparison of this brew to a  bottle  of  Anchor
     Steam,  and here are the similarities/differences: This beer is  exactly
     the same color as Anchor Steam, but it's a bit cloudier due to a  little
     chill  haze.  The head is neither as big nor as long lasting  as  Anchor
     Steam's,  but it clings to the side of the glass better. This  beer  has
     more body than Anchor Steam, and it is a bit maltier and sweeter; Anchor
     Steam  is crisper with more hop bitterness. It is not as  carbonated  as
     Anchor  Steam, although it would not be considered undercarbonated.  All
     in all a very good beer.

     Specifics:

     Source: Micah Millspaw, through Bob Jones (bjones@nova.llnl.gov)
             1/10/92

     Ingredients (for 10 gallons):

            5 pounds 2-row Klages (mash @ 158 for 14 hours)
           10 pounds wheat malt
           10 pounds 2-row Klages (infusion mash @155 for 1-1/2 hours)
            2 pounds wheat malt
            2 ounces Centennial hops (12% alpha)
           1/2 ounce coriander (freshly crushed added to fermenter)

                                      yeast

     Procedure:

     Notes:  I  sour 1/2 (one half) of the mash, the high % wheat  half,  the
     other is straight infusion. I do how ever make a effort to minimize heat
     loss  by  using a ice chest and sealing the lid with duct  tape.  If  it
     smells  rotten,  it is OK. The bacteria at work are for  the  most  part
     aerobic. If it looks bad, it's OK. After 14 hours no matter how bad  you
     think you screwed up, its OK just see the thing thru, it isworth it.

     Combine  mashes for mash out @ 170F for 15 min. Sparge @ 170F. Boil  for
     75 minutes, then cool and split into two carboys. Pitch a Chimay culture
     into  one  and a Chico ale yeast into the other. Add 1/4  ounce  freshly
     crushed  coriander  to each. After 7 days fermentation,  blend  the  two
     batches together in a larger vessel. Ferment 7 days longer. Keg with 1/4
     cup corn sugar per 5 gallons. Counter pressure bottled after 2 weeks.

     Comments:

     Aluminum  foil  has  nothing to do with sour mashing  technique,  CP  is
     awfully vague about this and most other topics.

     Yes  it  is malted wheat. The 20% barley malt is  American  grown  2-row
     klages, it has an abundance of enzymes for starch conversion (plus there
     is a lot of time available). The wheat seems to present a more interest-
     ing flavour profile IMHO. As for the sour mash contaminating your  brew-
     ing environment, I've not had a problem with it.

                          1 pound   steel cut oats
                          1/2 pound black patent malt
                          1/2 pound roast barley
                          1/2 pound chocolate malt
                          2 ounces  Eroica hops (boil)
                          1 ounce   Fuggles hops (finish)
                                    Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Crack  all grains (except oats), add to 2 gallons cold water, add  oats,
     bring  to  boil. Remove grains with strainer when boil is  reached.  Add
     malt extract and boiling hops.  Boil 60 minutes. Add finishing hops  and
     boil  another minute or so. Remove from heat, let steep 15 minutes.  Put
     4-6  inches of ice in bottom of plastic fermenter and strain  wort  into
     fermenter.  Sparge. Bring volume to 5-1/4 gallons and mix. The  tempera-
     ture  should now be below 80 degrees. Rack to 6 gallon glass carboy  and
     pitch yeast. Bottle when fermentation is done (about 2-3 weeks).

     Comments:

     I really liked this beer! Dark and smooth with a creamy mouth feel.   No
     specific  oatmeal flavor, but lots of body. Light brown head.  The  only
     problem I had was that after about 3 months in the bottle it developed a
     distinct  off flavor. Could be from the ice, or maybe it got  oxygenated
     during bottling.

                           1-3/4 ounce Fuggles hops
                                       ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Treat the water with 1/4 ounce of magnesium sulfate and 1 ounce of  com-
     mon salt. Crush all grains and mash in 2 gallons of water at 165 degrees
     for 2 hours.  Sparge with 2 gallons of 170 degree water. A few drops  of
     caramel  may  be added at this stage if proper color has not  been  suf-
     ficiently  achieved.  Boil 1-1/2 hours with hops and sugar. Bring  to  5
     gallons,  pitch  yeast when at correct temperature. This recipe  can  be
     brewed at an O.G. of 1.045 by adding 1/4 pound of dark extract. May also
     add  1/4 pound of lactose in boil to provide a slightly  higher  gravity
     and a sweeter palate.

     Comments:

     This  recipe is based on one presented by Bob Pritchard in his book  All
     About  Beer. He also advocates adding saccharine. In digest  #245,  Doug
     Roberts  said  that he made this beer and did not like the  results.  He
     said, "I will never again make a batch with brown sugar as an ingredient
     (a  little  honey  or molasses, perhaps,  but  not  caramelized  refined
     sugar).  The  recipe  absolutely no resemblance to  thick,  rich,  sweet
     Mackeson. It was a thin, cidery sorry imitation."

     Boil hops in 20 pints of water for 1 hour. Strain and dissolve  extract,
     caramel and sugar. Boil for 15 minutes. Bring to 5 gallons, pitch  yeast
     at correct temperature.

     As in the previous recipe, this can be brought to a gravity of 1.045  by
     increasing  the extract by 1/4 pound, and lactose may also be  added.  A
     few drops of caramel may be added at this stage if sufficient color  has
     not  been  achieved.  Saccharine can be added at  bottling  to  increase
     apparent sweetness.

     Comments:

     I  haven't  tried  either  of these, and I'm  not  about  to  go  adding
     saccharin to my beer, so you're on your own from here.

     Ingredients:

                    6-8 pounds   dark malt extract
                    1/2-1 pound  roasted barley
                    1/2-1 pound  black patent malt
                    3-4 ounces   bittering hops (e.g., Bullion)
                    small amount aromatic hops (optional)
                                 ale yeast

     Procedure:

     To these skeleton ingredients I add other adjuncts, or remove things  if
     the  wind blows from the south. A nice beer is made by using  only  dark
     malt and black patent malt. A good strong bittering hops is key; Bullion
     is lovely, as are Nugget or Chinook.

     There  are  no appreciable differences between making stouts  and  other
     ales, save the larger quantities of grain. Beware of 9-pound batches  as
     these can blow the lids off fermenters.

     Comments:

     There are scads of other additives that can lobbed into a stout without
     damaging it. Almost anything works when making stout, but matching  your
     own taste preference is a matter of experimentation. Be prepared  though
     to give up drinking commercial bottled stouts, because  frankly, nothing
     can match the taste of homemade.

     Ingredients (for 15 gallons):

                           22 pounds  Klages 2-row malt
                           2 pounds   roasted barley
                           2 pounds   flaked barley
                           1/2 pound  chocolate malt
                           4-5 ounces high alpha hops
                                      (e.g., 4-1/4 ounce of 10% alpha Eroica)
                                      yeast

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 15 gallons. Give the beer a lot of temporary  hardness
     (e.g., lots of carbonate).

     Comments:

     I  would  not  leave flaked barley out of a stout. This  is  what  gives
     Guinness  its creamy white head and rounds out the body. This beer  will
     have a rich creamy body with a balanced bitterness. It is very dark, but
     not  opaque.  It makes a great substitute for your morning  coffee.  The
     name refers to a huge tragedy. I was filling carboys and rocking them to
     knock down the head. I must have rolled one over a pebble because  there
     came a distinct click noise and beer poured everywhere.

     Ingredients:

                   3.3 pounds John Bull dark extract
                   3.6 pounds light Australian dry malt
                   1 pound    black patent malt (coarsely crushed)
                   2 ounces   Cascade hops
                   1/2 ounce  Tettnanger hops
                   1 ounce    Tettnanger hops (finish)

                   3/4 cup    corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Add  crushed  black patent malt to 1-1/2 gallons cold water.   Bring  to
     boil.  (This  recipe was made by boiling malt for 10  minutes,  however,
     conventional wisdom is to avoid boiling whole grains). Strain out  malt.
     Add extract and dry malt and Cascade and 1/2 ounce Tettnanger hops. Boil
     60  minutes. Add finishing hops and boil 1 minute. Remove from heat  and
     steep 1-2 minutes.  Sparge into 3-1/2 gallons cold water. Cool and pitch
     yeast.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds        Australian light syrup
                     1 pound         chocolate malt, cracked
                     1-1/2 pounds    black patent malt
                     12 ounces       crystal malt, cracked
                     12 ounces       lactose
                     2 ounces        Kent Goldings leaf hops
                     1 teaspoon      salt
                     1 teaspoon      citric acid

                                     ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  extract  syrup and enough water to make 3 gallons  to  boil.  Add
     crystal malt. Boil 10 minutes. Add hops. Boil 5 minutes. Turn off  heat.
     Add  chocolate  and black patent malt in grain bag.  Steep  10  minutes.
     Sparge grain bag with 2 gallons boiling water. Add lactose. Pitch  yeast
     and ferment. When bottling, prime with malt extract.

     Comments:

     It took me three tries, but I finally got a batch that was closer to the
     original  Mackeson  sweet  stout than I could have  hoped  for.  It  was
     wonderful! After aging about three months, it was as wonderfully smooth,
     dark, and sweet as the real Mackeson. Maybe better.

     Ingredients:

                          8 pounds  British amber extract
                          1/2 pound black patent malt
                          1/2 pound roasted barley
                          1/2 pound chocolate malt
                          1 pound   steel cut oats
                          2 ounces  Eroica hops (boil)
                          1 ounce   Fuggles hops (finish)
                                    Whitbread ale yeast
                          1/2 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Crack  grains using a rolling pin. Add grain and oats to 2 gallons  cold
     water.  Bring to boil. Strain out grains. Add extract and  Eroica  hops.
     Boil  about 1 hour. Add Fuggles and boil an additional 2 minutes.  Steep
     15 minutes.  Sparge through sieve over ice. Mix. Rack to 7-gallon carboy
     and pitch yeast. Bottle when fermentation is complete (about 1 week).

     Comments:

     This was one of my best beers yet. Black, smooth and creamy. The oatmeal
     doesn't  add a very pronounced flavor; I think it rather contributes  to
     the creaminess and smoothness, which is becoming more pronounced as  the
     beer  ages.  It has a fairly dark brown head,  presumably  from  roasted
     barley---creamy with small bubbles.

     Procedure:

     Mash  in 3 quarts cold water. Raise temperature to 153 degrees and  hold
     until iodine test indicates complete conversion. Transfer to lauter  tun
     and  sparge  to yield 7 gallons. Boil 1 hour, adding boiling  hops.  Add

     yeast.

     Comments:

     Very  smooth, silky mouth feel. Great flavor, nice sweetness  with  mild
     roasted  malt flavors. Somewhat thin for style. Will use ale  malt  next
     time.  Could  also use more dextrin and pale malt and possibly  mash  at
     higher temperature. Overall, a very nice beer!

     Ingredients (for 3--1/2 gallons):

                       5-1/2 pounds 2-row pale malt
                       1 pound      caramel malt

                       2-1/2 ounces Fuggles hops
                       1/4 ounce    Chinook hops
                       1 teaspoon   Irish moss

                       1/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This  will yield about 3-1/2 gallons at a density of 1106.  Mash  grains
     using  infusion  method for about 1 hour. Boil two hours with  all  hops
     added---that's right, no finishing hops. Cool and pitch Williams  yeast.
     Ferment for 4 days then rack to glass jugs. Rack again on 24th day.  Add
     champagne yeast. Let ferment another 4 months. Bottle.

     Comments:

     After two years this beer showed a little oxidation, but by and large it
     was  till in excellent shape. Viscous and black with  light  carbonation
     and a fine-beaded medium-brown head, it still had good balance, although
     the hop bitterness had faded with time to give predominance to the  dark
     malts. It was bittersweet and almost unbelievably long in the finish.

                          ale yeast
             1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
             3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Steep  whole grains in 6 cups of water and bring to boil. Remove  grains
     at  boil. Add extract and boiling hops. Boil 1 hour. Add Irish  moss  in
     last 15 minutes. After boil add Cascade hops and steep 15 minutes.  Cool
     and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  recipe was developed by Doug Hinderks, president of  the  Northern
     Ale Stars Homebrewers Guild. The recipe was used as the basis for  "Ursa
     Stout,"  which follows. Ursa differs in the addition of  pale,  crystal,
     and dextrin malts in place of some of the dry extract.

     Ingredients:

                2 cans       Munton & Fison stout kit
                2 pounds     Munton & Fison light dry malt extract
                1 pound      crushed pale malt
                1 pound      crushed crystal malt
                1/2 pound    dextrin malt
                2 cups       chocolate malt
                2 cups       black patent malt
                2 cups       roast barley
                2 ounces     Fuggles hops pellets (boil)
                1-2 ounce    Willamette leaf hops (finish)
                2 packs      M&F stout yeast
                1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
                3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash  grains  in 1-2 gallons of water. Sparge with enough water  to  end
     with  2-3  gallons in pot. Bring to boil. Stir in extract and  bring  to
     boil. Add boiling hops. Boil 40 minutes. Add Irish moss in last 15  min-
     utes.  At  end of boil, add aromatic hops and steep 15  minutes.  Sparge
     into primary with enough water to make 6 gallons. Cool and pitch  yeast.
     Rack to secondary when initial blow off subsides. Prime and bottle about
     a month later.

     Comments:

     This brew is so dark I think the Irish moss may be superfluous. This was
     the  most  active brew I've had in a while. Expect to use some  sort  of
     blow off method for primary and then rack to secondary  with an airlock.
     Very black! Thick, but not as much as Guinness. Well rounded flavor  and
     smooth with almost no bite. Very dark head. Maybe using less roast  bar-
     ley and a bit more black patent would lighten the head and keep the body
     from  suffering.  Everybody who tasted it really like it. I  do  believe
     I've found my house stout.

     Ingredients:

                   1 can     Munton & Fison dark hopped extract
                   1/2 can   Edme bitters kit
                   1 stick   brewers licorice
                   1/2 pound toasted barley
                   1 pound   flaked barley
                   2 ounces  Cascade hops pellets
                   1 ounce   Northern Brewer hops pellets
                   Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Make  toasted  barley into a tea. Bring flaked barley to  boil.   Sparge
     with kitchen strainer and boiling water. Boil extracts and Cascade hops.
     Add Northern Brewer. Cool and Pitch.

     Comments:

     This  makes  what  I consider to be an  excellent  porter.  Fermentation
     seemed to take off and I bottled within 7 days of brewing.  Fermentation
     took place at 74 degrees.

     Ingredients:

                   8 pounds     Munton & Fison 2-row pale malt
                   1-1/2 pounds crystal malt
                   1/4 pound    chocolate malt
                   1/4 pound    black patent malt

                                yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash  grains.  Add boiling hops and boil 90 minutes. Dry  hop  with  1/2
     ounce Cascade.

     Comments:

     My mash temp was too high, as I misjudged the quantity of strike  liquor
     and  the mash spent a lot of time in the 160-170 degree range  before  I
     brought  it  down  to  154 degrees. Conversion was  good  (1.048  for  5
     gallons), but now after fermentation slowed to 1 bubble every 2 minutes,
     the  gravity is 1.024. I suspect there's nothing I can do to  turn  this
     sweet porter into the dry porter I intended so my question is, "Is there
     some  style I can claim to have intended in the first place?" I guess  I
     need some level of plausible brewability.

     Ingredients:

                1 pound      crushed crystal malt
                1 pound      crushed roasted barley
                1-1/2 pounds crushed black patent malt
                9 pounds     Munton & Fison dark dry malt extract
                1 can        John Bull dark hopped malt extract
                2 inches     brewers licorice
                2 ounces     Nugget leaf hops
                2 ounces     Galena leaf hops
                1 ounce      Cascade hops
                2 packs      Doric ale yeast
                1 ounce      amylase enzyme

     Procedure:

     Put  grains into two gallons water and boil. When pot reaches boil,  re-
     move grains. Add dry extract and stir. Add hopped extract and  licorice.
     Add  Nugget and Galena hops. Boil 70 minutes. This was a big thick  mess
     and needs a big pot---mine boiled over. Add Cascade for finishing.  Cool
     and pitch yeast and amylase. Put in a big fermenter with a blow  tube---
     my  batch  blew the cover creating a marvelous mess all over  the  wall.
     Eventually rack to secondary and ferment a long time (at least 3 weeks).

     Comments:

     An experiment in extravagance.

     Intimidating. Heavy, strong, thick. Not really drinkable after 4 months.
     Interesting,  but  not completely enjoyable. Too much of too  many  good
     things.

     Ingredients:

                     8 pounds     Klages 2-row malt
                     1 pound      Munich malt
                     1/2 pound    crystal malt (90L)
                     1/2 pound    chocolate malt

                     14 grams     Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The mash was done based on Papazian's temperature-controlled method. The
     boiling  hops used were Northern Brewer and Cascade, but other hops  can
     be used, this recipe uses 10.75 AAUs. The finishing hops are added after
     the  boil and steep while cooling with an immersion chiller.  The  Irish
     moss  is  added in the last 20 minutes of the boil. The yeast  is  rehy-
     drated in 1/2 cup of 100 degree water.

     Comments:

     This was a marvelous bitter-sweet velvet black porter.

     Ingredients:

                   1 pound    Munton & Fison dark dry extract
                   1/2 pound  black patent malt

                   3/4 ounce  Willamette hops (boil)
                   3/4 ounce  Cascade hops (boil)
                   1 teaspoon vanilla
                   1/2 cup    French roast coffee
                   2 packs    Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Brew a pot of coffee with 1/2 cup of French roast coffee. Steep special-
     ty  grains  in water as it boils. Remove grains. Boil malts,  hops,  and
     vanilla 60 minutes.  Strain wort into fermenter. Pour in pot of  coffee.
     Add ice water to make 5 gallons. Pitch yeast. Rack to secondary after  3
     days. Bottle 23 days later.

     Comments:

     This  stout turned out pretty tasty and the coffee flavor seems to  come
     through  more  in the aftertaste with the predominant flavor  being  the
     dark malts. I should probably have let it ferment in the secondary a bit
     longer  or  not used anything for priming because I got  a  few  gushers
     after a couple months---but by then, most of the beer was gone anyway.

                      1/2 stick  brewers licorice

                      Wyeast #1028: British ale

     Procedure:

     Steep grains in water while heating. Remove grains just before  boiling.
     During boil, add licorice and extract. Add 1 ounce of Brewer's Gold  for
     60  minutes, 1 ounce for 45 minutes, and 1 ounce of Fuggles for 30  min-
     utes. Cool wort and pitch yeast. Add unground coffee beans and remaining
     ounce of Fuggles. The next day skim off all crud, including coffee beans
     and  hops.  One day later, rack to secondary. Ferment  three  weeks  and
     bottle.

     Comments:

     Wyeast #1028 does not seem to have high attenuation, causing high  final
     gravity. After 1 month in bottles, the beer has low carbonation  levels.
     I  like it this way! The beer feels thick and sweet. If you want a  good
     sweet stout, like Mackeson, this recipe with Wyeast #1028 is a good  way
     to  go.  This stuff is black! When you pour a bottle, it sucks  all  the
     light  out  of the room...you have to drink it in the  dark.  Amazingly,
     there  isn't much hops aroma and taste, but with so many  other  flavors
     and aromas, you don't miss it.

     Ingredients:

                     3 pounds    2-row pale lager malt
                     10 ounces   black patent malt
                     8 ounces    wheat malt
                     4 pounds    Scottish light malt extract
                     12 AAUs     Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                     1 ounce     Fuggles hops (finish)
                     3 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                     Edme ale yeast
                     1 teaspoon  gelatin finings
                     1/2 cup     corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash-in  3 minutes in 6 quarts of water at 122 degree (strike  heat  126
     degree).  Adjust pH to 5.0-5.5. Protein rest 30 minutes at 131  degrees.
     Starch conversion 60 minutes at 150-141 degrees (longer is better). Mash
     out 5 minutes at 168 degrees. Sparge with 2 gallons of water at  168-160
     degrees. Boil 60 minutes. Add extract, yeast nutrient and bittering hops
     at start of boil. Add finishing hops 10 minutes before boil ends.  Force
     cool and bring volume to 5 gallons. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     If  this  beer  doesn't have enough body,  you  might  try  substituting
     unmalted barley for the wheat malt and extend starch conversion  rest to
     2  hours. Bitterness can be reduced by cutting back bittering hops to  8
     AAUs or so.

                       1/2 pound    crystal malt
                       1/4 pound    roasted barley
                       3.3 pounds   Mountmellick stout kit
                       1/2 pound    amber dry malt
                       1/2 teaspoon gypsum
                       1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                       1/4 ounce    Fuggles hops plug
                                    yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 2-1/2 gallon recipe. Steep the grains 30 minutes in 1 quart of
     150 degree water. Strain out grains and bring liquid up to 3 quarts. Add
     stout  kit, amber malt, gypsum and boil 45 minutes. After 15 minutes  of
     boiling,  add Irish moss.  After removing from heat, steep Fuggles  hops
     pellets for 4 minutes. Strain into ice water and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This recipe is based on the Double Stout recipe that appeared in Zymurgy
     magazine, but the quantities have been adjusted to make a half batch.

     Ingredients:

                        3 pounds  2-row pale lager malt
                        10 ounces black patent malt
                        6 ounces  crystal malt
                        4 pounds  Australian dark extract
                        11 AAUs   Northern Brewer hops
                                  Doric yeast
                        1/2 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash-in  (6 quarts water) at 131-122 degrees, stir 3 minutes. Adjust  pH
     to  5.0-5.5  (using calcium carbonate or gypsum). Protein  rest  131-120
     degrees  for 30 minutes. Starch conversion 155 degrees for  60  minutes.
     Mash out at 168 degrees for 5 minutes.  Sparge with 2 gallons of 168-160
     degree  water.  Bring liquid to boil and add extract and hops.  Boil  60
     minutes.

     Comments:

     The  result  is sweet, but very tasty. My next batch of porter  will  be
     somewhat drier, tending toward stout. Changes will include a less  sweet
     extract (Scottish light), dropping the crystal malt  altogether, bumping
     the  bittering  hops up a point, adding an ounce of Fuggles  10  minutes
     before the end of the boil for finish, and going to Edme yeast, which  I
     believe to be more attenuative. I'm also toying with the idea of  adding
     8  ounces  of  wheat malt to improve the head, which is  the  only  real
     defect this beer seems to have.

     Ingredients:

                      8.8 pounds unhopped dark malt extract
                      1 pound    roasted barley
                      1 pound    wheat malt
                      1/2 pound  black patent malt
                      1/2 pound  chocolate malt
                      4 ounces   Bullion hops (boil)
                      1 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                                 yeast

     Procedure:

     The  bullion hops are added 30 minutes into the boil. I used  pelletized
     hops  and  there was a huge amount of sediment when  I  racked  it---not
     sediment in the normal sense---it was mostly beer with  hops floating in
     it, but it was too thick to go through the siphon.

     Comments:

     This  is  better than any stout I have ever tasted. It is based  on  the
     stout recipe posted by Marc San Soucie in Digest #219.

     Ingredients:

                     8 pounds   American 6-row (Klages) malt
                     1 pound    Munich malt
                     1/2 pound  crystal malt (90L)

     Comments:

     This  recipes is based on Papazian's "Silver Dollar Porter."  I  suspect
     the  difference  in quality between this batch and an extract  batch  is
     going to be the difference between fresh-brewed coffee and instant.  The
     wort  had a much better hot and cold break than I've   ever  experienced
     using extracts, and it tasted better too.

     Ingredients:

                 7 pounds        Australian light syrup
                 1 pound         chocolate malt, cracked
                 1-1/2 pounds    black patent, uncracked
                 12 ounces       crystal malt, cracked
                 12 ounces       lactose
                 2 ounces        Kent Goldings hops (whole leaf)
                 1 teaspoon      salt
                 1 teaspoon      citric acid
                 2-1/2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                                 yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  the  wort to boil (water and syrup to make 3 gallons),  then  add
     crystal.  Boil 10 minutes, then add hops. Boil 5 minutes. Turn off  heat
     and  add chocolate and black patent malt in a grain bag. Steep about  10
     minutes.  Sparge  grain bag with about 2 gallons of boiling  water.  Add
     lactose.  Chill and pitch. When fermented, try priming with 3/4  cup  of
     light dry malt extract.

     Comments:

     This  is  based  on Doug Roberts' Mackeson Triple clone.  This  will  be
     lighter  than  the  real Mackeson's with a lighter  head.  Very  similar
     aromas  and  head retention. Overall a resounding success.  One  or  two
     things I'll do different next time: Reduce black patent malt to 1/2  cup
     (crushed), add a bit of dextrin to increase body, and maybe add a  touch
     of  roasted  barley. I recommend this to anyone who likes  their  coffee
     strong, with cream and sugar.

     Ingredients:

                       6 pounds  dry amber extract
                       1 pound   crystal malt
                       1/2 pound roasted barley
                       1 pound   Quaker oats
                       1 ounce   Eroica hops (boil)
                       1 ounce   Kent Goldings hops(finish)
                       2 packs   Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     In  two gallons of cold water, add crystal, barley, and  oatmeal.  Steep
     until water comes to boil. Sparge with about 1 gallon of hot water.  Add
     dry extract. Bring to boil. Add Eroica hops. Boil 45 minutes. In last  5
     minutes  of  boil,  add Kent Goldings hops. Cool to  about  75  degrees.
     Transfer to primary and pitch yeast. Have a homebrew and wait.

     Comments:

     This  is  very lightly carbonated, but that I can live with.  Could  use
     more hops. Smooth aftertaste. Overall, I give it a thumbs up.

     Ingredients:

                       6.6 pounds   John Bull dark extract
                       1-1/2 pounds plain dark extract
                       2 ounces     Bullion hops (boil)

     Procedure:

     This is the first of a series of experiments in brewing oatmeal  stouts.
     It is an extract brew, with any specialty grains (not in this particular
     recipe) being added in the standard stovetop method and removed at boil.
     When grains are used, they are cracked with a rolling pin and boiled for
     30 minutes before straining.

     Comments:

     These  recipes rank among my best beers. This one probably had the  most
     noticeable  oat flavor of all the variations due to the balance  between
     the amount of malt and oats. It had a nice deep dark head, opaque  color
     and smooth creamy flavor. I'd probably use an Irish liquid ale yeast  or
     Whitbread if I did this again.

     Comments:

     The  addition of grains made the oatmeal less noticeable. Color and  hop
     balance were good again. Irish ale yeast could yield some  nice  results
     and I think the steel cut oats need to be bumped up to 1 pound to  bring
     them to the fore.

     after 4 days in the primary.

     Comments:

     This  turned out real fruity, probably because of the  Alexander's.  Dry
     hopping also helped, again the amount of steel oats to other grains  was
     too  low. To get opaqueness it was necessary to use at least 1-2  pounds
     of dark malt extract; because I didn't do that, this was more of a brown
     ale in color and body.

     extract  brew, with specialty grains being added in the standard  stove-
     top  method and removed at boil. Grains are cracked with a  rolling  pin
     and  boiled for 30 minutes before straining. The Sticklbrackt are  added
     in 1/2 ounce batches at 20 minute intervals, the Bullion 1/2 ounce at  a
     time in between the Sticklbrackt. The finishing hops are added 5 minutes
     before the end of the boil. The dry hopping is done in the primary.

     Comments:

     Darker  and  more astringent than the other recipes,  also  more  boldly
     hopped but still well-balanced due to the higher gravity. A  little like
     Xingu or Mackesons with its residual sweetness.

     Specifics:

     Final Gravity: 1.030

     Ingredients:

                7 pounds  Glenbrew Irish Stout Kit
                1/4 pound (1 cup) Flaked Barley
                1/8 pound (1/2 cup) Black Patent Malt
                1/2 ounce Fuggles hop pellets (bittering - 60 min)
                1/2 ounce Fuggles hop pellets (flavoring - 10 min)
                4 ounces  Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate
                2 cups    Brewed Coffee (Monte Sano blend)
                1 package WYeast #1084 Irish Stout Yeast
                3/4 cup   Corn sugar (bottling)

     Procedure:

     Brew  coffee using 2 scoops coffee to 12 oz. cold water.   Steep  flaked
     barley and cracked black patent for 45 minutes. Bring 1.5 gallons  water
     to  a  boil in brewpot, sparge in grains, and add  extract  and  boiling
     hops. Boil for 50 minutes. Add chocolate and flavoring hops and boil for
     10 more minutes. Remove from heat and carefully stir in coffee. Cool and
     pour into fermenter containing 3 gallons cold (pre-boiled) water.  Pitch
     yeast.   Rack to secondary when vigorous fermentation  subsides.  Bottle
     with 3/4 cup corn sugar.

     Comments:

     The  "Monte Sano blend" coffee is a mild coffee (sorry I can't  remember
     exactly which coffees are blended to make this) that I buy locally in  a
     coffee store. I wanted something mild for the first attempt so as not to
     overdo it. This beer turned out wonderfully black and the chocolate  and
     coffee come out nicely in the aroma and flavor. In spite of the oils  in
     the  chocolate, it has a rich, creamy head that stays with it until  the
     bottom  of the glass. The low hopping rate is due to the fact that  both
     the  coffee and the chocolate add to the bitterness and I  wanted  their
     aromas to dominate this beer. It has been well received by all who  have
     tried it. I called it "Three Passions Stout" because three of my  favor-
     ite tastes (from the world of food and beverages anyway) are  chocolate,
     coffee, and stout---not necessarily in that order. I have set aside  two
     six-packs of this to see how well it ages (if I can leave it alone, that
     is).

     Ingredients (for 3 gallons):

                4-1/2 pounds barley (pale malt)
                4 ounces     wheat malt
                8 ounces     Munich malt
                9 ounces     Crystal/Chocolate mixture
                4 ounces     Black Patent
                1/4 cup      molasses
                1.6 ounces   Cascade Hops (5.8AAU) (Bittering)
                1/2 ounce    Mt. Hood Hops (3.8AAU??) (Bittering)
                0.4 oz       Cascade (finish)
                             Wyeast English Ale

     Procedure:

     Add  all grains, crushed, to 6qts water at 55C. Wait 30 min. Raise  temp
     to 62C (Added 2qts boiling water) Wait 75 min. Raise temp to 75C. Wait 5
     min.  Sparge with 75C water. Bring to boil, add molasses,  Cascade,  and
     Mt.  Hood  hops.  Boil one hour. Add finishing hops.  Boil 5  min.  Cool
     down in sink.  Add yeast from starter.

     Comments:

     I recently tasted my all-grain porter against Anchor's and the big thing
     I notice was Anchor Porter is thick, creamy. Mine is low carbonated, but
     it does not have that creamy feel. This was my first all-grain brew  and
     my  first porter. It has a good malt flavor. Next time I would cut  back
     on the hops some.

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds  Dark Australian malt extract
                     1/2 pound Dark Australian dry
                     1/3 pound Coffee, whole bean
                               (I  use  Peet's  Costa Rican,  a  fairly  dark
                               roast)
                     4 ounces  black patent malt
                     4 ounces  Flaked Barley
                     4 ounces  Medium Crystal malt
                     4 ounces  molasses
                     2 ounces  cascade (bittering) at 4.7 AAU
                     2/3 ounce northern brewers (aromatic)
                               Sierra Nevada yeast culture

     Procedure:

     Steep flaked barley and crystal malt for 50 minutes at 153 degrees. Boil
     for  90  minutes.  Add black patent malt and  molasses  at  45  minutes.
     Bittering  hops in thirds each 30 min. Fill a hops bag with  the  coffee
     and  aromatic hops and add to the hot wort just before chilling. If  you
     don't  have a wort chiller you'd better wait until pitching. Remove  the
     bag  after  about  24 hours or when the fermentation  is  going  strong,
     whichever  is  longer. Rack to secondary once initial  fermentation  has
     died down, about 5 to 6 days.

     Comments:

     The  last  couple of times I've left the bag of coffee  beans  and  hops
     until  racking without over doing the coffee flavor. This cuts  down  on
     the potential for contamination. We've been using a Sierra Nevada  yeast
     culture  for the last few batches and it's been a very nice  brew.  Pre-
     started  Wyeast  British Ale yeast has worked well also.  Sierra  Nevada
     yeast  culture is not terribly attenuative and the last batch was a  bit
     sweeter  than I'd prefer. Next time I'll use Wyeast's Irish Stout  Yeast
     that Florian and others have recommended.

     Ingredients:

               5 pounds  pale 2 row British malt
               1 pound   rolled barley
               1 pound   roasted barley
               2 pounds  light dry malt extract
               2 cups    corn sugar
               2 ounces  bullion Hops (1.5 boiling, 0.5 finishing)
                         (preferably whole)
               1 package Whitbread Ale Yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash 5 pounds 2-row, rolled barley and roasted barley in at 132 degrees.
     Protein  rest  30  minutes. Starch Conversion 2 hours  at  153  degrees.
     Mashed out 15 minutes at 168 degrees. Sparged with 4 gallons 172  degree
     water.  Add the 2 pounds dry ME and the 2 cups sugar. Bring to  a  boil.
     Add 1 1/2 ounces of hops.  Boil 1 hour. Add 1/2 ounce of hops, turn  off
     heat, and let stand for 15 minutes. Cool wort to 72 degrees, strain into
     fermenter, and pitch yeast.

     Bottling:  one to two days before bottling, sour two bottles of ale.  To
     do  this, pour two bottles of ale into a steril glass  container.  Cover
     with  a clean cloth secured with string or rubber band. Put in the  cup-
     board  (or somewhere relatively dark and warm) and let stand one to  two
     days.  It should sour, but not mold. Add 2/3 cup corn sugar to the  sour
     ale and boil for 10 minutes. Pour into bottling bucket. Add sour ale and
     bottle as usual.

     Comments:

     This stout is creamy, but not as heavey as some, with a head that  takes
     almost 30 seconds to form, lightly bitter, with that back of the  throat
     sourness from the soured ale.

                 3.3 pound    bag Northwestern Amber Malt extract
                 1-1/2 ounces Clusters 6.9% alpha (boil)
                 1 ounce      Cascades 5.6% alpha (finish)
                              Ale yeast (your choice)

     Procedure:

     Bring  2 gallons of water and malt to a boil. Add 1/2 ounce Clusters  at
     beginning  of boil, 20 minutes, and 40 minutes. After 60 min.  turn  off
     heat,  and  add Cascades. At this point it was late in  the  evening,  I
     poured the wort into my sanitized bottling bucket and brought the  quan-
     tity up to 5 gals. and stuck the whole thing in the beverage  refrigera-
     tor.  Next morning I siphoned off the wort into the  fermentor,  leaving
     all  those hop particles behind, pitched the yeast. Put on the blow  off
     tube, and put the fermenter back in the refrigerator. I had the tempera-
     ture  set at 50 degrees. After a week, I replaced the blow tube with  an
     airlock, and bottled after a month of fermenting.

     Comments:

     Very smooth, nice hop balance, but a bit heavy for a summer drink.  Will
     try to save the rest for this fall. This might be considered a lager due
     to  the refrigeration. It was only done because the ambient  temperature
     of my basement "brewing room" hits 75-80 Degrees during the summer heat.
     I  brewed  this  in early spring as an ale (65  degrees)  and  strangely
     enough,  they taste very similar. (Drink a bottle of one version,  wait,
     drink a bottle of the other, results: Who cares. Both are great.)

     priming sugar and bottle.

     Comments:

     My batch fermented in about a week (house temperature ranging between 60
     and  68). It was barely drinkable after 6 weeks, but delicious  after  3

                                  Wyeast German ale

     Procedure:

     The  flaked  barley  has no husk, so I saw no reason  not  to  grind  it
     finely.  Mash in at 130 degrees. Let rest 20 minutes or so. Mash at  150
     degrees  for 115 minutes. Sparge. Let the spargings settle. What  seemed
     to  be 3 or 4" of hot break settled out of the initial  spargings!  Boil
     for 2 hours. Add hops as follows: 14 grams bullion and 16 grams  cascade
     (very  fresh) for 1:45. 10 g bullion and 14 g cascade for 1:05. 4  grams
     hallertauer finish. Chill with an immersion chiller, and strain the wort
     through the hops. Makes about 5.5 gallons of 1.068 wort.

     Comments:

     I had 374 out of 450 pt * gals of possible extraction, so an  efficiency
     of about 85%.

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds   dark dry malt extract
                     2 pounds   amber dry malt extract
                     1 pound    crystal malt, cracked
                     3/4 pound  roasted barley, cracked
                     1/2 pound  black patent malt, cracked
                     2 ounces   Bullions hops (boiling)
                     1/2 ounce  Willammette hope (finishing)
                     2 cups     Quaker Oats
                     2 packages Whitbread Ale Yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep the Oats, and the cracked grains for 1/2 hour in cold water.  Heat
     mixture  and remove grains as boil is reached.  Throw in malts and  make
     your  wort. Boil Bullions for 45 minutes, Willammette for  5-7  minutes.
     Have fun.

     Comments:

     This  beer improves substantially after about 2 weeks in the bottle,  as
     hop  aroma subsides and the large amount of roasted barley assumes  it's
     place  in  the forefront. It's my favorite beer to date, but if  I  were
     going  to brew it again I might cut back on the roasted barley by  about
     or  1.5  ounce of some lower alpha hop). Whitbread ale  yeast  was  used
     because  of the low attenuation rate: this stout is NOT sweet,  but  has
     lots and lots of body.

                1-1/4 pounds Brown Sugar

                1/2 pound    Crystal (40 degree L)
                1/4 pound    Chocolate Malt
                22 AAU       (2 ounce Nugget) 60 minutes boil
                3 ounce      Fresh Grated Ginger; 10 minutes boil
                1 ounce      Cascade
                             Ale yeast (see comments)

     Procedure:

     Steep  grains  at 150 degrees for 40 minutes before boil. Add  malt  and
     brown  sugar. Boil for 60 minutes. Add Nugget hops at begining of  boil.
     Add ginger last 10 minutes of boil. Turn off heat and add Cascade  hops.
     Allow  to steep for 10 minutes. Cool wort with chiller. Rack  off  trub.
     Add water to make total about 5.3 gallons.  Pitch yeast. Bottle 3  weeks
     later.

     Comments:

     I used two types of yeast pitched simultaneously for this brew. One  was
     5 grams (rehydrated) Doric Ale yeast, and the other was a "large" sample
     taken from a previous (cherry ale) brew a few weeks earlier,  originally
     Whitbred  Ale yeast. Obviously, this is a very heavy ale, almost like  a
     stout.  I'd liken the flavor to Sierra Nevada's porter, but  heavier,  a
     little sweeter, and with (delicious) ginger. After about 3 weeks in  the
     bottle,  it was, uh, WOW!!! Delicious!! What a combination  of  flavors!
     I'd say that this is the correct amount of ginger for such a dark, heavy
     ale  (for my taste). I've had (lighter) ales with too much  ginger,  but
     this was just right.

     Ingredients (for 6 gallons):

           3.3 pounds   Munton & Fison dark malt extract syrup
           2.2 pounds   dark dried malt extract
           1.1 pounds   light dried malt extract
           8.5 ounces   malto-dextrin powder
           1.1 pounds   crystal malt (40 L)
           4-1/4 ounces chocolate malt
           4-1/4 ounces black patent malt
           1 cup        light clover honey
           1 cup        brown sugar
           1/3 cup      blackstrap molasses
           1 ounce      Clusters hop pellets (boil)
           1 ounce      Cascade hop pellets (boil)
           1/2 ounce    cascade hop pellets (finish)
           1 teaspoon   gypsum
           1/4 teaspoon Irish moss (15 minutes)
           3/4 cup      dextrose (to prime)
           1/2 quart    (500 ml) Irish ale yeast culture (WYeast #1084)

     Procedure:

     Crush grains and steep for 30 minutes in water at 158 deg.  Strain  into
     boiling  vessel  and sparge with 158 degrees water. Add  malt  extracts,
     dextrin,  honey, brown sugar, molasses and gypsum and bring to  a  boil.
     Add boiling hops 5 minutes into boil, Irish moss for the last 15 minutes
     and finishing hops in last 5 minutes. Total boil of 50 minutes.  Cool to
     at least 68 degrees before pitching yeast. Prime with dextrose as usual.

     Comments:

     Although I tend towards all grain brewing it seems I always come back to
     this one as my Porter. The rich body and residual sweetness of this beer
     is  something  which  I have found hard to replicate  in  an  all  grain
     recipe.  This  beer  finished  2nd  at  the  Canadian  Amateur   Brewers
     Association national competition in 1989 and a variation of this  recipe
     finished  3rd  in  1990. The yeast strain is critical  as  well  as  the
     molasses to get the most out of this beer.

     Comments:

     I've tried to duplicate Xingu, but reduce some of the roast barley bite.
     I think I've succeeded, though I haven't done a side by side comparison.
     I  believe  that Xingu is what's known in the UK as a milk stout,  as  I
     believe  that lactose is used to add body and to very  slightly  sweeten
     the flavor.

                        1 cup        DME for priming

     Procedure:

     Made a yeast starter 3 days before pitching. Used 2 tablespoons DME  and
     1 cup water. Next time use 2 cups water. Crack all grains and steep  for
     30 minutes at about 160 degrees along with the calcium carbonate. Strain
     out  grains and sparge into about 2-1/2 gallons pre-boiled water.  Total
     boil about 5 gallons. Add dry malt and dextrin and bring to a boil.  Add
     1/2  ounce  of  Eroica and 1/4 ounce of Chinook  when  boil  starts.  30
     minutes  later  add  3/4  ounce Nugget hops.  Chill  with  an  immersion
     chiller.  Rack to a carboy, fill to 5 gallons and let sit  overnight  to
     allow  the  trub to settle out. The next morning rack it  to  a  plastic
     primary, pitched the yeast starter, and add the 1 ounce of Cascades  and
     Eroica hops.

     Comments:

     I had originally planned for a single stage fermentation, with  bottling
     a  week  after pitching. However, there was no time to  bottle  after  a
     week, so I racked to a secondary glass carboy to get the beer out of the
     primary, which does not seal very well. The dry hopping should have been
     done  in the secondary, but at the time I had no plans for using one.  I
     suspect the hops did not spend much time in contact with the beer in the
     primary,  as they got pushed up by the krausen and stuck to  the  walls.
     When  I bottled 2 weeks after brewing, I tried what might be called  "wet
     hopping." On the suggestion of sometime brew partner Mike Fetzer, I made
     a hop tea by steeping 1 ounce N. Brewer in 2 cups water after the  water
     had just stopped boiling. This was kept covered for about 10 minutes.  I

     Chapter 5: Stout and Porter


     bottled  half the batch, then added the hop tea and bottled  the  second
     half. The bottles aged in my closet for two weeks before tasting.

     This turned out to be a very nice dry stout. It is dark and thick,  with
     a brown head that lasts to the end and sticks to the side of the  glass.
     The  "no tea" beer is not terribly aromatic, and has a noticable  bitter
     aftertase.  The  "hop  tea" beer is more aromatic, and  has  a  smoother
     finish, with what I think is a better blend of flavors. My fiancee likes
     the  "hop  tea" beer better as well, but a friend who  only  likes  dark
     beers likes the "no tea" beer better.

     whelmed  any oat flavor, but the oats may have added to the  smoothness.
     Reduce the hopping level by 1/2. Also, not enough roasted barley "bite".
     Increase  RB  from 1/3 oz. to 1/2 oz. at least, maybe 2/3 oz.  would  be
     best. There was also 1/2 oz. of crystal used.

     Ingredients:

                            3/4 pounds crystal
                            1 pound    roasted barley
                            1 pound    flaked barley
                            1/4 pound  chocolate malt
                            1/4 pound  wheat malt
                                       hops to 10-12 HBU
                                       Wyeast Irish yeast

     Procedure:

     Standard mashing procedure used.

     Comments:

     The  beer turned out very well, and I got lots of good comments. It's  a
     matter of taste, but if you prefer it a bit drier, you might reduce  the
     crystal malt or drop it entirely, or for this gravity of stout,  perhaps
     up the roasted barley to 1.25 pounds.

     Ingredients That I Found Laying Around:

                  1 can     Ironmaster Scottish Mild Ale extract
                  1 can     Bierkeller light lager extract
                  1 pound   crushed crystal malt
                  1 pound   Munton & Fison Light DME
                  1/2 cup   Lactose
                  1 ounce   Brewer's Gold hop pellets
                  1 ounce   Cascade hop pellets
                  1 package Whitbread dry ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Standard procedure---put crystal malt in cold water, heat to just shy of
     boil  and  sparge into brewpot. Add malt extracts and  water,  bring  to
     boil. Add Brewer's Gold hops, boil a little over 1 hour. Stop boil,  add
     Cascade hops and chill on the way into fermenter. I tossed the dry yeast
     directly into the fermenter atop the cooled wort.

     Comments:

     The  yeast started flocculating within an hour and by the  next  morning
     the  air  lock  was burping continuously. Today, 4  days  later,  it  is
     completely  fermented  out and I'm going to transfer it  into  secondary
     probably before I go to bed.

     Procedure:

     Roast pale malt in 325 degree oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
     Crack grains and add to 1-1/2 gallons cold water. Bring to boil.  Before
     serious  boil starts, remove grains. Add extract and Saaz hops. Boil  60
     minutes.  Add  Hallertauer hops and boil 5 more  minutes.   Remove  from
     heat.  Cover  and let hops steep 15 minutes. Strain into  3-1/2  gallons
     cold  water. (Be sure to strain out as much  stuff as  possible.)  Pitch
     yeast and ferment one week at about 65 degrees, then rack to  secondary.
     Secondary fermentation should last about 3 weeks at 45-50 degrees. Prime
     and bottle.  Refrigerate bottles for about 1 month.

     Comments:

     This  dopplebock was based on a recipe from Papazian's book.  In  making
     this  beer, I used hops plugs for the first time. Wonderful stuff.  They
     expand and give the appearance of fresh hops and they smell great!  This
     batch turned out really well. Very dark and smooth, lightly  carbonated,
     with a considerable alcoholic whammy. Great sippin' beer.

     Specifics:

     Primary Ferment: 1 week at 65 degrees
     Secondary Ferment: 3 weeks at 45-50 degrees

     Procedure:

     Start yeast 2 days ahead and add to quart of sterile wort 3 hours before
     brewing. Add gypsum to 2 gallons water, add crystal malt. Bring to boil.
     Strain out grain.  After 10 minutes add Northern Brewer hops. 30 minutes

                      1/2 - 1 pound Herbal hops substitute

     Procedure:

     This  recipe makes 5 gallons of full-strength barleywine plus 4  gallons
     half  strength. Follow normal procedures, but brew in a 7-gallon  kettle
     and  then  divide the wort into separate fermenters.  The  special  hops
     substitute  is a mix of hops repeatedly soaked and sparged  in  lukewarm
     water  for  at  least 4 hours to  eliminate  water-soluble  off-flavors.
     Special  hops are added to the secondary fermenter about 1  week  before
     kegging. Quantity used depends on quality of herbs/hops.

                      1-1/2 ounces Kent Goldings @5.2%
                      1/2 ounce    Hallertauer @2.8%
                      1/2 ounce    Cascade @5.2%
                                   Wyeast Vintner's Choice champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash in 18 quarts water @148 degrees (adjust pH to 5.3). Starch  conver-
     sion  2  hours at 150-141 degrees. Mash out 5 minutes  at  168  degrees.
     Sparge at 168 degrees. Boil wort 2-1/2 hours. 90 minutes after start  of
     boil,  add  extracts,  molasses, and Northern Brewer  hops.  30  minutes
     later,  add Kent Goldings hops. In last 15 minutes, add Hallertauer  and
     Cascade hops.

     Comments:

     This was not an easy batch. The yeast took off immediately and blew  out
     1-1/2  gallons through the blow tube. Once the yeast subsided, I let  it
     sit for a week and then bottled. I should have taken a sample and pitch-
     ed some Red Star Pasteur champagne yeast because it turns out the  grav-
     ity  was still 1.091! The flavor is impossibly syrupy, but I'll  put  in
     the  cellar and forget about it for a few months. This could be my  most
     expensive  failure yet, then again, maybe not. Maybe I can pour it  over
     ice cream...

     Procedure:

     Treat  10.5  gallons  of  medium hard water with  18  grams  of  Calcium
     Bicarbonate. Mash in grain. Follow a mash program of 50 minutes at  50C,
     20 minutes at 58C, 40 minutes at 65C, 90 minutes at 70C, and a mash  off
     for  15 minutes at 77C. Sparge for about an hour and a half.  This  will
     yield about 19 gallons at the end. (runoff gravity of about 1.010). Boil
     down  to a volume of 15 gallons (about 3 hours and 20 minutes.) Add  200
     grams of Hallertaur pellets about 2 hours into the boil. Cool and  pitch
     yeast.

     Digest:Issue #732, 9/26/91

     Ingredients (for 10 gallons):

                      20 pounds 2-row brewer's malt, crushed
                      4 pounds  80 L. crystal malt, crushed
                      5 ounces  Fuggles Leaf hops
                      2 ounces  Hallertauer leaf hops
                                Yeast

     Procedure:

     Add  crushed malt to 5 gallons water at 135 degrees, stir, add a bit  of
     near  boiling  water to get about 120 - 125 degree protein  rest.  After
     thirty  minutes of stir-well-every-10-minutes (by the way, I use a  pair
     of  40  quart  cooler chests for mashing) add  boiling  water  gradually
     (usually  takes 2 gallons) to raise temperature to 155 degrees. Do  this
     in  stages...add a quart or two, stir well, stick in  your  thermometer,
     give  it 5, read, add, repeat. It takes a while to equilibrate  tempera-
     tures in the porridge, and you can easily bring your mash to 170 degrees
     (a no no) if you add too fast. Let this sit with periodic stirring for a
     few  hours until converted. Sparge with 11 gallons of water. Collect  up
     all that good stuff (I sparge off between 11 and 13 gallons depending on
     how long I want to drink while boiling) and boil roil troil and trouble.
     About 30 minutes before you finally tire of boiling, add 5 ozs.  Fuggles
     leaf hops. Rejoice in the aroma! Turn off the boil. Caper briefly. Add 2
     oz.  Hallertauer  leaf hops. Cover. Cool. Pour into  fermenting  vessel,
     pitch yeast (the cake(s) from your last brew, recently stripped of their
     beery  covering.  Or  be conventional, and use Whitbread  Ale  from  the
     packet).

     Ingredients:

               7 pounds     Light Scottish Malt Extract
               1 pounds     Dry Dark Malt Extract
               1-1/2 pounds 80L Crystal Malt
               6 ounces     Chocolate Malt
               2 ounces     Black Patent Malt
               8 ounces     Dextrin Malt
               1/4 teaspoon brewing salts
               2 ounces     Perle Hops (bittering) alpha=7.6%
               1 ounces     Hallertauer Hops (aromatic) alpha=3.9%
               1/2 teaspoon Gypsum
               2 packets    Red Star Lager yeast
               2/3 cup      corn sugar for priming
                            water to 5 gallons

     Procedure:

     Mash  crushed Crystal and Dextrin Malts in a pan of water at 150F for  1
     hour.  Strain  through collander into main kettle and sparge  with  150F
     water  until  it  runs clear. Add enough water  to  kettle  to  dissolve
     extracts  (approx. 3 gallons). Dissolve extracts, salt and  gypsum  into
     kettle and bring to a ROLLING boil. Stir in 1/2 oz. Perle Hops and  boil
     15 min. Stir in 1 oz. Perle Hops and boil 15 min. Stir in Choco late and
     Black  Patent Malts (UNCRUSHED!) and boil 15 min. Stir in 1/2 oz.  Perle
     Hops  and  boil 15 min. Add Hallertaur Hops in the last  minute  of  the
     boil. Strain though a nylon meshed colander into Primary fer mentor. Top
     up to 5 gallons with cold water. Cool wort as fast as possible. (I cool-
     ed it to 80 degrees in 9 minutes.) At 80F add yeast. Ferment for 12 days
     at 40-48 degrees. Rack it into the secondary and let it sit and  ferment
     VERY slowly for 1 month at 32-40 degrees. Bottle and let age for a  full
     month at 34 degrees.

     Comments:

     This  brew is not quite as strong as a traditional Dopplebock.  However,
     the  resulting beer was none less than excellent. It had a good shot  of
     malt  flavor (esp. the chocolate!). The head quite creamy. The hop  ping
     was perfectly balanced. It is the smoothest homebrew I've ever had.

               2 pounds     Munton & Fison light dried malt extract
               1/4 pound    Domino light brown sugar
               3-1/2 ounces Fuggles hops
               1/2 ounce    Fuggles for finishing
               2 packs      Munton & Fison ale yeast

     Procedure:

     We  did  a single stage fermentation, so I can't  answer  your  question
     about how long to age in secondary.

     We gave the finishing hops 10 minutes.

     As far as conditioning in bottles---well, it's been 14 months now and it
     keeps  getting better. At 2 months it was OK, but cloudy enough that  we
     thought  we  should have used gypsum. It was also VERY sweet,  but  also
     very  hoppy and quite smooth. By 9 months it was clear, but quite  heavy
     and  we thought maybe less sugar. Last week it had  gotten  considerably
     drier  and  VERY clear. It's really good now, so I don't know  if  it'll
     last long enough for me to give you an update later.

     Ingredients:

                  6.6 pounds   Munton & Fison dark malt extract
                  3 pounds     dry dark extract

                  1 ounce      Cascade hops
                  1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                  1/2 ounce    spruce essence
                               Leigh & Williams Beer & Stout yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  malt  and boiling hops for 1 hour. In last 10 minutes  add  the  1
     ounce  of  Cascade  finishing hops and the Irish moss.  In  the  last  2
     minutes add the spruce essence. Chill and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     My tasting notes on this say that at 2-1/2 months after bottling it  was
     "fair." This tells me that it was unremarkable. My recollection is  that
     it  was drinkable but unexciting. Perhaps the dark  extract  overwhelmed
     the  spruce  and more spruce essence should have been  used.  Where  the
     bottle says "Sufficient for 8 gallons of spruce beer" they may mean  for
     a somewhat lighter beer.

                      1 teaspoon   cardamom
                      1 teaspoon   cinnamon
                      1 teaspoon   ginger
                                   grated rinds of 4 oranges
                      1-1/2 ounces Nugget hops (boil)
                      1 ounce      Willamette hops (finish)
                                   Whitbread ale yeast
                      1/2 cup      molasses (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash  grains.  Add dextrin (I was out of Cara-pils), 1/2  cup  molasses,
     spices, boiling hops, and orange peel. Boil 1 hour.  Add finishing  hops
     in last few minutes. Strain into fermenter.  Cool and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     During  the boil the spices combined with orange peel and malt made  the
     house smell really good---kind of like a beer fruit cake. After smelling
     and tasting the wort, I think I've identified one of the  secret  ingre-
     dients  in Anchor's Christmas Ale: cardamom. I'm guessing they use  1/4-
     1/2 teaspoon per five gallons.

     Digest: Issue #101, 3/15/89

     Ingredients:

                      4 pounds  honey
                      6 ounces  grated ginger
                      3 pounds  light malt extract
                      1 ounce   Brewers Gold leaf hops
                      1/2 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets
                      1/2 ounce Saaz hops pellets
                                yeast

     Procedure:

     Use  two  brew kettles. In the first, add 4 gallons  water,  honey,  and
     ginger. Maintain at 180 degrees for 45 minutes. While first pot is heat-
     ing,  add  malt extract to 3 gallons water in the second pot.  Bring  to
     boil. Add 1 ounce of Brewers Gold to boil for 45 minutes. Add 1/2  ounce
     of Northern Brewer at 30 minutes. When second pot is removed from  heat,
     add  1/2 ounce of Saaz hops and steep. Combine pots, cool, and pitch.  I
     also brewed a second batch with the same procedure, except that I used 8
     pounds of honey instead of 4, 1/2 ounce of  Northern Brewer hops replac-
     ed the 1 ounce of Brewers Gold, and 1/2 ounce of Galena replaced the 1/2
     ounce of Northern Brewer.

     Comments:

     Six  ounces of ginger seems about right to give a nice balanced  flavor.
     The  ginger was grated in food processor, but it had to struggle as  the
     ginger  tends to break up into strands that get stuck in the blades.  (I
     did  not peel the ginger). This beer had an amber color and all  flavors
     were  readily apparent---hops, malt, ginger, and light honey. The  color
     was a medium amber shade.

     Ingredients:

               3.3 pounds   Munton & Fison dark plain malt extract
               1-1/2 pounds Munton & Fison plain dark dry extract
               1 cup        corn sugar
               3/4 pound    crystal malt
               1/2 pound    chocolate malt
               hunk         ginger, grated
               2 ounces     Cascade hops (boil)
               1 ounce      Fuggles hops (finish)
                            ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Add crushed grains to 2 gallons cold water. When mixture begins to boil,
     remove grains. Boil 1 hour with malt extracts, ginger and Cascade  hops.
     Turn off heat, add Fuggles and steep five minutes. Strain into  primary,
     add  water to bring to 5 gallons and ferment 3 days. Rack to  secondary.
     Prime and bottle.

     Comments:

     My long-term taste bud memory says this was brown, bitter, and  slightly
     sweet with a great ginger flavor and tingle at the back of the throat as
     it  went  down. It was overcarbonated (7/8 cup of priming sugar  is  too
     much!) I wish I could tell you how much ginger I used, but I remember  I
     wished it were more. Go for it! I've found nothing better to drink  with
     Chinese food.

     Ingredients:

                   2 pounds     crystal malt
                   6 pounds     amber dry malt extract
                   2 ounces     Fuggles and Bullion hops (boil)
                   1-1/2 ounces Saaz hops (finish)

                   1 stick      cinnamon
                   1 pack       Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  malt  until boil is reached. Strain out  grain  and  add
     extract  and  boiling hops. Boil 60 minutes. Add Saaz hops,  ginger  and
     cinnamon  in last 15 minutes of boil. Cool, top off fermenter and  pitch
     yeast.

     Comments:

     This  batch  had a furious fermentation and blew the blow tube  off  the
     fermenter, losing about 1-1/2 quarts in the bargain.

     Source: Jim Kipps, reposted by Robert Nielsen (robertn%fml@sc.intel.com)
     Digest: Issue #320, 12/11/89

     Ingredients:

                    6 pounds     Australian dark extract syrup
                    1-1/2 ounces Bullion hops (boil)
                    12 ounces    maple syrup
                                 ale yeast
                    3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Add six ounces of the maple syrup during the boil and the other 6 in the
     last couple minutes of the boil (much like a finishing hops). Total boil
     time was 1 hour.

     Comments:

     This  is a very good beer. I don't typically drink stouts, but I  really
     like  this one. I absolutely don't like Guinness, but I do like  Young's
     Oatmeal Stout and Rubicon Stout. I think the maple stout is better  than
     any  of  these. It is very smooth going down, and has sweet  but  mellow
     maple flavored aftertaste. Thanks to Jim Kipps for posting this recipe.

     Ingredients:

                     3.3 pounds John Bull amber malt extract
                     1/2 pound  crystal malt

                                Munton & Fison ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Chop  up Jalapeno peppers and boil them with the wort for 30 minutes  or
     so.  Strain them out when pouring wort into primary. Rack  to  secondary
     about 4 hours after pitching yeast.

     Note: When handling jalapenos, be sure to wash hands thoroughly or  wear
     rubber gloves. You'll find out why if you are a contact lens wearer.  (I
     discovered this the hard way---making pickles, not beer.) --- Ed.

     Comments:

     The beer is amber, clear, has enough hops for me, and has a great  spicy
     (bordering on hot) aftertaste.

                 1 pound      Amber crystal

                 6 ounces     fresh orange peel (15 min)
                 1/2 teaspoon Irish Moss(15 min)
                 1 cup        American Lager yeast slurry

     Procedure:

     Upwards  infusion  mash,  low-temp  conversion.  Used  water  with  high
     carbonate hardness.

     Comments:

     So far, the young beer tastes great with an unusual taste that is diffi-
     cult  to  describe. I hadn't seen mention of using fennel before,  so  I
     thought I'd mention it. The beer has a dark orange color.

                     3/4 pound 40L crystal malt
                     1/4 pound roasted barley
                     2 ounces  Perle hops (7.5% alpha)
                     1 ounces  Willamette (4.6% alpha)
                     3 large   garlic cloves chopped fine

     Ingredients (for 6 gallons):

                  3.3 pounds Steel City Ale Kit
                  2.2 pounds John Bull plain light malt extract
                  1.1 pounds plain light dried malt extract
                  1/3 pound  crushed chocolate malt
                  1/4 pound  crushed crystal malt
                  6 ounces   fresh spring spruce sprigs (boil)
                  8 spruce   sprigs (finishing)
                  2 cups     culture of Munton & Fison Ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Place Crystal and chocolate malts in 1 gallon cold water and raise temp-
     erature  to 158 degrees and immediately strain into the brew kettle  and
     sparge  with 2 cups of 158 degree water. Add malt extracts and water  to
     bring volume to 6 gallons. Add boiling sprigs when boil begins and  boil
     for  60 minutes. Add finishing sprigs and boil for 3 minutes. Chill  via
     wort  chiller. Pitch yeast at 68 degrees. Single stage ferment in  glass
     for 14 days then bottle using 1 cup corn sugar to prime.

     Comments:

     I  didn't like this beer at first because I felt that a  spruce  essence
     was lacking in the flavour. However, two months in the bottle cured that
     problem  and  the  beer was exquisite and "sprucey"  and  improved  with
     further aging.

                   1/2 ounce Galena pellets (11.4%) (boil)
                   1 ounce   fresh ginger (finish)

                             Wyeast British Ale yeast (#1098?)

     Procedure:

     Crush  crystal  malt,  add to 2 gallons water and  bring  to  about  170
     degrees.  Remove grains, add dry extract, 3 ounces ginger, boiling  hops
     and  boil for 1 hour. During last ten minutes add finishing  ginger  and
     hops. Chill. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Wonderful color and smells delicious. Should be in the bottle next week-
     end and I'll report on how it turns out.

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds   light unhopped malt extract
                     1 pound    light crystal malt
                     1 ounce    Cascade hops, 5.5% alpha
                     1 ounce    whole Coriander Seed - 30 min
                     1 ounce    whole Coriander Seed - 10 min
                     1 teaspoon Irish Moss - 10 min
                                Chico Ale yeast (from a previous batch)

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  malt at 160 degrees for 1 hour.  Sparge  grain  and  add
     extract.  Bring to a boil and add Cascade hops. (boil for  60  minutes.)
     Add 1 ounce coriander at 30 minutes and the final ounce for the last  10
     minutes. Strain off the hops and coriander seed when transfering to  the
     primary.  Leave  in  the primary for 5 days, and in  the  secondary  for
     around 10 days.

     Comments:

     Each batch has been a bit different, but good. The coriander isn't  real
     strong,  but is noticable. Some people have a hard time identifying  it.
     For  some reason they all seem to lack much head, maybe the oils in  the
     coriander?  Lack  of head is not a problem any of my other  beers  have.
     Overall a nice slightly spicy light beer. Probably good for lawn  mowing
     if  I had a lawn. Good right away but seems to get better after 3  to  4
     weeks in the bottle. The flavors blend together a bit more with age.

     Ingredients:

         2 ounces Cascade leaf (boil)
         2 ounces Cascade leaf (finish)
         one      Big Thing of garlic (maybe half the size of your fist)
                  Whitbread dry ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  procedure is the same as for any simple extract beer. Chop  up  the
     garlic and throw it into the boil for the full 60 minutes. If you  don't
     want  quite  so much garlic flavor, strain the garlic  bits  out  before
     racking  (we didn't). Add 2 ounces of Cascade hops at begining  of  boil
     and again in the last ten minutes. Cool.  Pitch yeast.

     Ingredients:

             3.3 pound    can Munton & Fison Light Hopped Malt Syrup
             2-3/4 pounds (approx.) light dry malt extract
             2-1/2 pounds light clover honey
             1 pound      crystal malt
             2 teaspoons  gypsum (soft water treatment)
             2 ounces     Cascade hops (4.5% alpha)
             1 ounce      Cascade hops
             1/2 ounce    Cascade hops
             1/2 ounce    Cascade hops
             2 teaspoons  dried ground ginger
             2 teaspoons  dried ground nutmeg
             3 teaspoons  dried ground cinnamon
                          grated orange peel from 4 oranges

             3/4 cup      corn sugar for priming
             1 quart      starter M. eV. German Lager liquid culture

     Procedure:

     Steep crystal malt in brew pot. Remove grains before boil. Add  extracts
     and  honey  and bring to a boil.  Add 2 ounces Cascade at  beginning  of
     boil. Add ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, orange peel, and Irish moss in  last
     10 minutes. Add 1 ounce of Cascade hops two minutes later. Add 1/2 ounce
     Cascade in last 5 minutes and the last 1/2 ounce in the last 2 minutes.

     Comments:

     This  recipe makes a golden, rather than dark, Christmas beer. With  the
     proportions  of hops and spices used, you get a complex mix  of  aromas,
     with none of them being too dominant. Other than being a lager and using
     various  temperatures, this is a very easy brew to make. If anyone  else
     tries it out, I'd be curious to hear the results.

     Ingredients:

             7 pounds      amber liquid extract (Alexanders, I think)
             2 pounds      crystal malt, cracked
             1 pound       chocolate malt, cracked
             2 ounces      Hallertauer hops
             2 ounces      Saaz hops
             4 ounces      fresh ginger, grated
             2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
             1 pint        starter of Wyeast American Ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  and chocolate malt in hot, but not  boiling,  water  for
     about  1/2 hour. Strain out grains, sparge with hot water. Add  extract,
     stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil and add all the Hallertauer  hops,
     the  ginger and the cinnamon.  Boil 1 hour. Chill the wort, transfer  to
     primary,  and  add  Saaz hops. Pitch the yeast.  When  the  fermentation
     slows,  transfer to secondary fermentor. Prime with 3/4 cup  corn  sugar
     and bottle when fermentation appears complete.

     Comments:

     Really  nice  balance of flavors. The dry-hopped Saaz blended  with  the
     ginger and cinnamon aroma really well, and the ginger flavor is perfect.
     The  cinnamon didn't contribute much flavor, and seems to have led to  a
     muddier beer than I usually get. Probably would have been better to  use
     stick  cinnamon  instead of ground... The color is much lighter  than  I
     would have expected.

     Ingredients:

                 9 pounds        Pale dry malt extract (M&F)
                 3/4 pound       crystal malt, cracked
                 3 pounds        light clover honey

                 1/2 ounce       Hallertau hops (finish)
                 6 ounces        fresh ginger, peeled and grated
                                 grated peels of 4 oranges
                 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
                 1/2 teaspoon    nutmeg
                 1-1/2 teaspoons Irish moss
                                 Whitbread Ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Add cracked crystal malt. Remove as water comes to a boil. Add all  fer-
     mentable sugars.  Add 1 ounce of Hallertau. Add half (3 ounces I  think)
     of  the  ginger  and half of the orange peel. Add spices.  Boil  for  60
     minutes. In the last ten minutes of the boil, add the remaining  ginger,
     orange peel, and Irish moss. Cool. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  brew  is  just barely sweet, at the  threshold  of  perception.  A
     strong, heavy body follows, the ginger and orange blending together  and
     taking  you through from the middrink to the aftertaste. The  finish  is
     incredibly  long,  both the high alcohol content and  the  ginger-orange
     aftertaste lingering for a full 8 or 9 seconds after swallowing.

     Note:  In  retrospect, this could have used a  stronger  bittering  hop;
     after  aging the ginger asserted itself more and drowned out  what  hops
     there were. It was still great, though.

     Digest: rec.crafts.brewing, 10/4/91

     Ingredients:

             8 1/2 pounds pale malt extract (Williams bulk extract.)
             4 large      bulbs garlic peeled and cleaned
             1 ounce      Northern Brewer hops (AAU not available)
                          WYeast London Ale (pre-started)

     Procedure:

     Separate  and  peel  the cloves from four entire  bulbs  of  garlic  and
     lightly score the surface of the garlic cloves to increase surface  area
     during  the boil. Add the extract, half of the garlic, and 1/2 ounce  of
     hops. Total boil of 60 minutes The other half of the garlic goes in  for
     the  last 15 minutes along with the final 1/2 ounce of hops.  After  the
     boil,  chill  the wort and strain the cooled wort into a  6-1/2  gallon
     primary.  After three days of vigorous ferment in 6 1/2  gallon  primary
     (w/blowoff tube) I racked it to a 5 gallon secondary.

     Comments:

     The wort tasted very sweet and definitely *GARLIC*! Lethal stuff! I mean
     it  was  stomp-on-your-tongue  rip-the-back-of-your-head-off   _GARLIC_.
     Three weeks later my tongue still remembered the assault and was  braced
     for  a  similar  attack, but the attack was not  forthcoming.  There  is
     absolutely no pronounced garlic taste! There is only a hint of something
     reminiscent  of garlic. I purposely made the brew a little light on  the
     hops,  so  the hops don't shine through either. To me, it  is  a  fairly
     well-balanced, heavy beer and everyone who has tried it has really liked
     it.  Next time, I think I'll leave the garlic cloves in the  primary  to
     see if I can get a more pronounced garlic taste in the final product.

     the wort for the final twelve minutes of the boil. Cool. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     I  tasted the sample which I took to measure the SG. The pine taste  and
     smell were definitely present but not excessive; they added extra sharp-
     ness  to  the  brew on top of the hops. Hard to say more  from  a  flat,
     sweet, yeasty sample only halfway fermented.

     Ingredients:

                   2-1/2 pounds barley malt
                   1/2 pound    wheat malt
                   1/2 pound    40L Crystal malt
                   2 pounds     honey
                   1 pound      dried malt extract (pale)
                   2-1/4 ounces Mt. Hood hops (3.3%, bittering)
                   1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (5.9%)
                   1 ounce      Basil leaves
                                Whitbred dry yeast

     Procedure:

     I  did my partial mash, then boiled the wort with the honey and DME  and
     the  Mt Hood for 70 min. I then turned the heat off, added  the  Cascade
     and Basil, and covered and let sit for 30 min.

     Comments:

     The  basil I added may be a lot; it was about 1/3-1/2 of the  "bunch"  I
     bought at the grocery store. I talked to the brewmaster at the pub where
     I  had the original Honey Basil and he said they used four "bunches"  in
     800 gallons. So we'll see.

     Now it is fermenting, and is a pretty murky brown color. I didn't  think
     that  much  40L  Crystal would make it this dark;  much  darker  than  I
     wanted. We'll see what happens when it is done---looks like I'll need to
     add  the gelatin this time (I've had good luck with this in  the  past).
     I'll let you know what it tastes like.

     And I hope the hops are light enough to let the basil and honey through.
     I think I have a pretty heavy hand with hops usually.

     Comments:

     When  I tasted this during the bottling stage there was not  much  blue-
     berry flavor. More blueberries may be required to give a stronger taste.
     The beer came out remarkably clear with a nice reddish tint.

     Digest: Issue #521, 10/19/90

     Ingredients:

             6.6 pounds John Bull light malt extract (or other brand)
             1 pound    corn sugar
             2 ounces   Hallertauer hops (boil)
             1/2 ounce  Hallertauer hops (finish)
             12 pounds  apples (9 pounds Granny Smith, 3 # Macintosh)
                        water crystals
             2 packs    Edme ale yeast
             3/4 cup    corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Cut apples into 8-10 slices. Put 1-1/2 gallons water into pot, add boil-
     ing hops and bring to boil. Add extract and corn sugar. Boil 40 minutes.
     Add  finishing hops and apples.  Steep 15 minutes. Pour wort into  3-1/2
     gallons  cold water. Push apples to one side and pitch yeast. Ferment  3
     weeks.

     Comments:

     This is based on Papazian"s "Cherries in the Snow." We used Granny Smith
     and  Macintosh because we wanted high-fructose  varieties---besides,  we
     like  them. Perhaps the use of Saaz or a more delicate hops would be  in
     order  because  this was too hoppy. Beer seems to improve with  age  and
     after  a  few months the flavor was described as "immaculate"  but  with
     balance tipped more toward hops than apple.

     Ingredients:

                3.3 pounds    John Bull dark unhopped malt extract
                2 pounds      Munton & Fison light dry extract
                1/2 cup       black patent malt
                2 ounces      Cascades hops
                2 tablespoons gypsum
                1 teaspoon    salt
                3-5 pounds    pitted chopped cherries
                1/2 ounce     Hallertauer hops
                              yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  black patent malt in 2 gallons of water bringing to boil.  Strain
     out  grain.  Add extract and boil with Cascade hops, gypsum,  and  salt.
     Boil  60  minutes. Remove from heat. Add finishing  hops  and  cherries.
     Steep  30  minutes.   Strain into fermenter with cold water  to  make  5
     gallons. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This recipe came from Charlie Papazian many years ago. This is  supposed
     to  make  a lager, but I've never actually produced a  lager  with  this
     recipe,  only  an ale. The cherries add a sweetness, but are  not  over-
     powering  in  a  dark  beer. I also tried  another  cherry  beer  called
     "Sinfully  Red Cherry Ale" from the Spring 1984 issue of  Zymurgy.  This
     used 10 pounds of cherries and made a much lighter beer.

     Digest: Issue #312, 11/29/89

     Ingredients:

            6.6 pounds   John Bull dark unhopped malt extract
            8 cans       blueberries (or 10 pints fresh or 6# frozen)
            1/2 pound    roasted barley
            1/3 pound    black patent malt
            1 pound      crystal malt
            1-1/2 ounces Fuggles hops (boil)
            1/2 cup corn sugar (priming)
                         yeast

     Procedure:

     Crush  and  boil blueberries in 1-1/2 gallons of water for  10  minutes.
     Strain out berries. Add grains and steep. Add extract and hops and bring
     to boil. Strain into fermenter with enough cold water to make 5 gallons.
     Pitch  yeast.  Give this lots of time in the secondary fermenter or  add
     champagne yeast after initial fermentation.

     Comments:

     This  tastes  like a normal stout, but after 4 or 5 sips,  a  warm  glow
     begins to suffuse your throat and tummy; great for winter nights.  Don't
     worry about pectin haze, you definitely won't see it!

                    1/4 pound    crystal malt
                    1/4 pound    lactose
                    7-8 pounds   fresh sweet cherries

                                 Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This  recipe makes 5-1/2 gallons. Freeze cherries a couple  days  before
     brewing. Defrost in the fridge.  While wort is boiling, remove stems and
     crush cherries. After boiling, pour wort over cherries in fermenter. Add
     cold  water  and pitch yeast. After a couple days,  rack  to  secondary,
     straining out cherries.

     Ingredients:

               1 can        Mount Mellick Famous Irish Stout extract
               3 pounds     M&F dark dry malt extract
               4 pounds     frozen blackberries
               1 pound      dark crystal malt
               1/2 pound    black patent malt

                            corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Start grains in brewpot with cool water. Remove when boil commences. Add
     all malt and Hallertauer hops. Boil 1 hour. Add Fuggles and boil 5  more
     minutes. Remove from heat. Add thawed blackberries and steep 15 minutes.
     Cool.   Dump whole mess into primary. After a couple rack to  secondary,
     straining out berries.

     Comments:

     This  stout  reaches prime in 4-6 weeks and  rapidly  deteriorates  from
     there,  acquiring  a winey flavor as the residual  blackberry  sweetness
     erodes.  An amateur judge commented, "Good and black.  Good mouth  feel.
     Unbelievable finish---seems to last forever!  Fruit? I want the  recipe.
     Nice job."

     Comments:

     This  recipe was described in the Summer 1987 issue of Zymurgy. See  the
     issue for procedural details. When I brew with fruit I do not add  fruit
     to  the boil, this will set the pectins to creating a haze. Instead  add
     them after the boil and steep.  I generally use a wheat malt extract  to
     emulate a lambic frambozen. Try a Lindemann Framboise to see what you're
     shooting for. They use unmalted wheat in their beer.

     Ingredients:

             6-7 pounds light malt extract
             1/4 pound  crystal malt
             2-1/2 cups raspberry puree
             1 ounce    boiling hops (Hallertauer, Saaz, Tettnanger)
             10 cups    raspberry puree
                        yeast

     Procedure:

     Crack,  steep, and strain crystal malt before boiling. Add  extract  and
     hops.   Boil. Strain into primary. Add 2-1/2 cups raspberry  puree.  Add
     enough  cold  water  to make 5 gallons. Pitch  yeast.  When  racking  to

     Comments:

     I  figured  that I'll sterilize anything I use to add the  puree,  while
     taking  my chances with the puree itself (rather than heating it up  and
     risking setting the pectins).

     Ingredients:

                       5 pounds  pale malt extract syrup
                       1 pound   corn sugar
                       2 ounces  Hallertauer hops (boil)

                                 corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Crush cranberries. Boil wort. Add cranberries to wort at time  finishing
     hops  are added. Turn off heat and steep at least 15 minutes. Pour  wort
     into  fermenter with enough water to make 5 gallons. Pitch yeast.  After
     about 5 days, strain into secondary fermenter, avoiding sediment. Bottle
     after about 1 more week. Age bottles about 2 weeks.

     Comments:

     This isn't the best beer I've ever had, but the red color and mixture of
     cranberry,  champagne,  and beer tastes (in that  order)  together  make
     wonderful  conversation  pieces. A perfect treat for the  holidays.  The
     cranberry  taste is quite dominating: I might try just 2 or 3 pounds  of
     cranberries  in the future. This recipe is based on Papazian's  Cherries
     in the Snow.

     minutes add cinnamon. In last couple minutes, add finishing hops.   Pre-
     pare  pumpkin while wort is boiling: place pumpkin flesh in  blender  or
     food  processor  and  mush. Mix chopped cilantro and  1-2  ounces  fresh
     ginger  in with mush. Place pumpkin mush, wort, and water to make  6-1/2

                        ale yeast

     Procedure:

     In  cold water, place crushed dark crystal malt in a cheesecloth.  Bring
     water  to boil. When boiling commences, remove grain and add  Telford's.
     Boil  15-20  minutes. Add sugar and honey and boil another  10  minutes.

     Ingredients:

                15-1/4 pounds bulk, light extract
                3/4 pound     roasted barley
                3/4 pound     black patent malt
                3/4 pound     chocolate malt
                2 pounds      English crystal malt
                3-3/4 ounces  Bullion pellets (9.6 alpha)
                1-1/4 ounces  Northern Brewer pellets (6.7% alpha)
                2 ounces      Kent Goldings pellets
                13 pounds     fresh raspberries
                4 teaspoons   gypsum
                              Sierra Nevada yeast
                1 cup corn    sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This  makes 6-1/2 to 7 gallons. This is based on Papazian's recipe  from
     the  Summer  1990 issue of Zymurgy, except that I use  more  raspberries
     than  Charlie.  Follow  his directions, or  E-mail  me  for  directions.
     (Directions are pretty standard.)

     The  Bullion  hops and Northern Brewer are used for  bittering  and  are
     added to the boil. The Kent Goldings pellets are used for dry-hopping.

     Comments:

     This had a very strong raspberry taste with a slightly coffee/dark  malt
     and  hoppy/bitter  aftertaste. The raspberry taste is accompanied  by  a
     sort  of  astringency or acidity that will supposedly soften  with  age.
     It's still very young for an Imperial stout.

     Ingredients:

                  6.6 pounds  wheat malt extract
                  1/2 pound   crystal malt
                  1 ounce     Hallertauer hops
                  1 pack      Wyeast #3056, Bavarian wheat
                  5 or 6 bags frozen raspberries (12 ounce bags)

     Procedure:

     The  wheat malt should ideally be a 60-40 mix of wheat and  barley.  The
     crystal  malt is cracked and steeped in hot water for 20  minutes,  then
     strained. The hops are then added and the mixture is boiled for 45  min-
     utes. Chill and add yeast. Allow the beer to ferment for 7 days and then
     prepare  raspberry  mixture by defrosting berries and using  blender  to
     puree.  Pitch in fermenter and after 48 hours, bottle. Next time I  make
     this, I will modify the recipe to use 1 can (6.6#) of Ireks wheat  malt,
     3-4  pounds of light DME, 1 ounce of Hallertauer (35 minute  boil),  and
     again, Wyeast #3056. By using a 100% wheat extract, such as Ireks, I can
     control the amount of barley extract to assure 60% wheat to 40% barley.

     Comments:

     I've been getting a large head with good lace, and an enormous aroma  of
     raspberries.  The  brew is also crystal clear, with a  deep  ruby  color
     (which I consider to be just plain luck since wheat beers are character-
     istically  cloudy).  As aging continues, any hints  of  astringency  are
     disappearing. It will probably need 4--6 months aging time, quite possi-
     bly more.

     Specifics:

     Primary Ferment: 7 days
     Secondary Ferment: 48 hours

     Digest: Issue #607, 4/1/91

     Ingredients:

               4 pounds    Mountmellick Brown Ale Kit (Hopped)
               1 pounds    Light DME
               1 pound     Honey
               1/2 pound   Crystal Malt
               4 pounds    Sliced Winesap Apples
                           (from Purdue Hort. Farms---hence, the name)
               2 teaspoons cinnamon
               1 cup       Cinnamon Imperials (Red hots)
               10 grams    burton salts
               1 teaspoon  Irish Moss
               1 package   Brewer's Choice London Ale Yeast (#1028)
               2/3 cup     dextrose to prime

     Procedure:

     Bring 3 gallons water to boil and put in brew bucket to cool. Bring  1.5
     gallons  water  and  crystal malt to boil. Remove  grain.  Add  extract,
     honey, burton salts, and irish moss and boil for 15 minutes. Add red hot
     candies.  Turn heat to low after candies melt. Add apples  and  cinnamon
     and  steep 15 minutes. Dump into brew bucket, then transfer to  primary.
     (I made malted applesauce out of the apples by the way!)

     Comments:

     This  ale is a nice light beer with little bitterness. You can't  really
     taste  the  red hots too much, but the are definitely in the  aroma.  My
     husband had his doubts about this since the only hops were whatever  was
     in  the  extract, but he was pleasantly surprised. The red  hot  candies
     make  a  very nice addition to the brew. I think they might be  good  in
     some other styles, too.

     Digest: Issue #740, 10/8/91

     Ingredients:

                 6 pounds  Williams' English Light malt extract
                 1/2 pound crystal malt (unknown Lovibond)
                 2 ounces  Hallertau hops (4.0 AA%) (45 minutes)
                 1/2 ounce Hallertau hops (4.0 AA%) (5 minutes)
                 4 pounds  raspberries
                           Wyeast liquid yeast (London ale)

     Procedure:

     Prepare  1  quart starter two nights before. Purchase some  fresh  rasp-
     berries  (if  possible. Try local farmer's market).  Freeze  raspberries
     night  before  brewing to break down cell walls.  Pre-boil  some  water.
     Cooled  some and freeze some. Prepare wort as usual by steeping  crystal
     malt in 150-160F water while the brew pot water is heating up and  sparg
     into  the  brewpot. Boil about an hour.  Add 2 ounces  Hallertau  at  15
     minutes  and another 1/2 ounces at end of boil. At the end of the  boil,
     toss  all the raspberries into the brewpot and let sit for fifteen  min-
     utes.  Wort was pretty cool by then. Toss *everything* into the  fermen-
     ter.  (With the raspberries in there, I figured I couldn't get any  S.G.
     readings, so I didn't try.)

     Comments:

     In spite of everything, this came out very very well, with rave  reviews
     from everyone.

     Digest: Issue #659, 6/14/91

     Ingredients:

        3.3 pounds    M&F amber hopped syrup
        3-1/2 pounds  dry light malt
        1 pound       crushed crystal malt
        1 ounce       Northern Brewer leaf hops, (alpha=8.0%) 1 hour boil
        8 pints       fresh strawberries, washed, stemmed, pureed
        4 Tablespoons pectin enzyme
                      Ale yeast starter

     Procedure:

     Make  a  yeast starter by boiling 1 cup dry malt extract in a  quart  of
     water  and cool to below 90 degrees F.  Add four of Red Star  Ale  yeast
     and agitate. Let set for two hours.

     Steep  crystal  malt in 1 gallon of water for a while, then  "rinse"  in
     another 1--1/2 gallons. (I preboil.) Add malt and boiling hops and  boil
     liquid  for  1  hour. Turn down heat to very low flame  and  add  pureed
     strawberries,  heat for 15-20 minutes. Remove hops then cool wort.  Dump
     in  primary  fermenter and add cold bottled water. The  temp  should  be
     around  65-70.  Dump in the yeast starter. The next day or  sooner,  add
     about 4 tablespoons of pectic enzyme, right into the beer. Rack after 3-
     4 days. Bottle with 3/4 cup corn sugar.

     Comments:

     Crystal  malt adds sweetness, and helps to bring out the essence of  the
     fruit. One other important ingredient was pectic enzyme, as the pasteur-
     ization  sets the pectin very well. This results in a very nice  looking
     crystal clear beer with a pink-amber hue.

     Digest: Issue #743, 10/18/91

     Ingredients:

          4-1/2 pounds light dry malt extract
          1 pound      German pilsner malt (steeped at 150 F for 1 hour)
          1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
          1/2 teaspoon salt
          1 ounce      Chinook hops (12.2% alpha)
          1/2 ounce    Mt. Hood hops (5.3% alpha)
          2 1/2 pounds frozen, pitted, halved apricots
          1 packet     ale yeast
          3/4 cup      corn sugar for bottling

     Procedure:

     Steep pilsner malt at 150 degrees for 1 hour.  Strain and sparge  grain.
     Add  malt extract. Bring to boil and boile for 60 minutes. Add  1  ounce
     Chinook  hops  at 30 minutes. Add Mt. Hood in the last  2  minutes.  The
     apricots  were added at the end of the boil. The wort was  then  sparged
     into the primary fermentor, say about 10 minutes after the apricots were
     added.  The wort was cooled over night and the yeast was pitched in  the
     morning.  After  a week, the beer was racked to the secondary.  Here  it
     rested for one month (either I'm busy or patient; I wish I could say the
     latter) before bottling.

     Comments:

     How  did it turn out? It was a fine light ale. Nice golden  amber  color
     with a good hop bite. About half way through a mug, I start noticing the
     taste of cloves. But I didn't notice any apricot taste. I think it would
     be  worth trying it again only letting the apricots sit in  the  primary
     fermentor. At least that's what I'd try next.

     Source: Dave Bonar (eebonar@sn01.sncc.lsu.edu)
     Digest: rec.crafts.brewing, 8/14/91

     Ingredients:

                      6 pounds extra light dry malt extract
                      1 pound  Munich malt
                      1 ounce  Fuggles boiling
                      3 bags   frozen cranberries
                      1 ounce  Fuggles as finishing hops
                               yeast

     Procedure:

     I thawed the berries and blended with enough water to make a little over
     2  quarts  of  slush. Meanwhile I did a normal extract  brew  using  the
     Munich malt as a specialty grain (i.e., put in a double layered pair  of
     clean panty hose and stuck in the pot while I bring the cold water to  a
     boil). At the end of the hour of boiling I put in the finishing hops and
     poured  in the cranberry liquid for the final minute or two as I  turned
     off the heat. I bottled after a week.

     Comments:

     I  am finding it very tasty. After a month it is somewhat sweet  with  a
     distince fruit flavor. I'm not sure that you can identify the flavor  as
     cranberries  without knowing which fruit it is.. It turned out  somewhat
     cloudy but the color is a pretty rose.

     Digest: Issue #589, 3/5/91

     Ingredients:

         7 pounds Lager Malt
         7 pounds crushed raspberries
         3 pounds Wheat Flakes
         1 ounce  2 year old Cluster hops that had been baked for 20 min.
                  WYeast #1056 American Ale Yeast

     Procedure:

     We did a beta glucan rest at 120 degrees for 30 mins, a protein rest  at
     130 degrees for 30 mins, and a saccrafication rest at 155 for 1 hour. Be
     exta  careful  with the sparge because it has the potential to  be  very
     slow (although we managed to whip right through in 45 mins.). We  boiled
     the  wort for 2 hours, leaving the hops in for the entire  boil.  Cooled
     with  an  immersion chiller to 42 degrees and strained into  a  carbouy.
     After 8 hours we racked the wort off of the trub and pitched the  yeast.
     We left it in primary for 2 weeks and then racked it into a carbouy  and
     added the raspberries.

     Comments:

     We  had  a bit extra so we are doing a small fermentation  (without  the
     raspberies)  of  about 3/4 of a gallon. To this we added a  teaspoon  of
     yogurt to try to get a lacto bacillus infection and produce lactic acid.
     If  it  produces anything interesting I'll post the results.  Anyway,  I
     can't  comment on how this beer will taste as it is still  in  secondary
     and is fairly expeimental.

     Ingredients:

               10 pounds    Klages pale malt
               1/2 pound    amber crystal malt
               2 ounces     Cascade(4.9%)
               10           HBU's
               3 pounds     plums, depitted & sliced

                            (didn't remove pith)
               2            lemons; flesh sliced, and peels diced
                            (didn't remove pith)
               1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
               3 teaspoons  whole cloves 5 2" sticks cinammon
               1/2 cup      fresh grated ginger root

                            (from 12-ounce starter)

     Procedure:

     Mash  Klages  and crystal malt at 158 degrees for  90  minutes.  Sparge.
     Bring wort to a boil and add hops. Boil for 1 hour. Add fruit and spices
     during  final 10 minutes of boil. Cooled to 80 degrees in half-hour  and
     pitched.   Racked  after 5 days, and noted rocky head from  fruit  pulp.
     Added  2  tablespoon dissolved gelatin after 12 days. Bottled  after  15
     days.  NOTE: I forgot the Irish Moss.

     Comments:

     There was too much particulate (orange pits, plum halves, etc) to get an
     original  SG, so I didn't even bother with a FG. It tastes a  bit  tart,
     but  the  hops is a good balance for the sweetness. It is  quite  clear,
     considering all the stuff that went in it. A pale yellow color.  Probab-
     ly  not enough spice character, namely the cloves and cinammon.  All  in
     all, quite drinkable, but the taste does stay with you for awhile.

                  1 pound   Munich malt (10L)

                  4 ounces  black patent malt
                  1 cup     dark molasses
                  3/4 ounce East Kent Goldings hops (6.2 alpha)

                  2/3 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash  in 2 gallons water at 138 degrees, adjust pH to 5.2 using  Calcium
     Carbonate.  Protein rest 30 minutes at 158 degrees. Conversion  rest  30
     minutes at 158 degrees. Mash out 5 minutes at 168 degrees. Sparge with 5
     gallons  water at 165 degrees. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops in  last  30
     minutes. Chill wort, pitch yeast and ferment 1-2 days. Rack to secondary
     for 5 more days and bottle.

     Comments:

     This is the first try at formulating my own recipe. It turned out  quite
     nice, malty with just a touch of hops. You may not be able to drink just
     one!  This is one of the smoothest batches I ever brewed. It  is  really
     smooth  even after only 2 weeks in the bottle.  The rather intense  malt
     flavor and low hopping rate makes it a refreshing change of pace from my
     steady production of IPA.

     Digest: Issue #448, 6/27/90

     Ingredients (for 2 gallons):

                      2.4 pounds pale ale malt
                      0.4 pound  crystal malt (80L)
                      1/4 pound  pan roasted barley
                      1/2 cup    dark molasses
                      1/2 ounce  Willamette hops (5.5 alpha)
                                 Wyeast #1028

     Procedure:

     This  recipe makes 2 gallons. Raw unmalted barley was roasted in  a  pan
     over  medium  heat until the outside was quite dark but the  inside  was
     only  tan---stir  often to avoid scorching.  Mashin in  132  degrees  (5
     quarts of water) at pH of 5.2 Mash 2 hours at 152-153 degrees. Mash  out
     5 minutes at 168 degrees.  Sparge in 2-1/2 gallons of 165 degree  water.
     Boil  90  minutes adding hops 30 minutes before end of boil.  Chill  and
     strain and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     The  toasted  barley probably had a Lovibond rating around  80-100,  the
     unfermented  wort was delicious. This is similar to many  stout  recipes
     but the barley isn't roasted long enough to give it that much darkness.

     Ingredients:

                      6 pounds     dark Australian DME
                      1 pound      caramel crystal malt
                      1-1/2 ounces Willamette hops
                      1-1/2 ounces Fuggles hops
                      1 pack       Wyeast #1098: British Ale
                      3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Boil  2 gallons of water and turn off heat. Add crystal malt  and  steep
     about 15 minutes. Strain through muslin into kettle. Heat another gallon
     of  water to 170 degrees. Pour through grain into pot. Heat  to  boiling
     and  add DME and 1/3 of hops. After 45 minutes add another 1/3 of  hops.
     Turn  off  heat after 15 minutes and add last 1/3 of hops.  Steep.  Cool
     wort and add 2 gallons of cold water. Pour in wort and pitch yeast. Rack
     to  secondary after 4 days top off with enough water to make 5  gallons.
     After 4 weeks, prime and bottle.

     Comments:

     I  thought that the final gravity of this beer was a bit high,  but  the
     beer  came out tasting great and no bottles exploded. In order  to  call
     this a porter it needs more hops, therefore I think it is a  Scotch ale.

     Specifics:

     Original Gravity: 1.055
     Final Gravity: 1.017
     Primary Ferment: 4 days
     Secondary Ferment: 4 weeks

     Ingredients:

                      7 pounds     Klages malt
                      1/4 pound    chocolate malt
                      1/4 pound    black patent malt
                      1/2 pound    crystal malt (90L)
                      1 ounce      Willamette hops (boil)
                      4/5 ounce    Perle hops (boil)
                      1/2 ounce    Willamette hops (finish)
                      1 teaspoon   gypsum
                      1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                                   Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  mash  was done using Papazian's  temperature-controlled  mash.  The
     boiling hops (Willamette and Perle) equal 9.84 AAUs. The finishing  hops
     are added after the boil (while chilling with an immersion chiller). The
     ale yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup of 100 degree water.

     Comments:

     This  batch was what my fond memories of drinking London Brown  Ales  in
     Canterbury, UK were all about. A classic.

     Ingredients:

                      2 cans       Geordie Extra Strong ale
                      1 cup        dark brown sugar
                      2 cups       corn sugar
                      1/2 pound    crystal malt
                      1/2 cup      maltodextrin
                      1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                      1 ounce      Willamette leaf hops

     Procedure:

     Bring grain to boil in 1 gallon water; remove grain when water starts to
     boil.  Add another 1/2 gallon of water and bring to boil again. Add  ex-
     tract and sugars, boil for 15 minutes. Add Irish moss and hops for  last
     5  minutes  of  boil. Put it in fermenter with enough water  to  make  5
     gallons. Add ale yeast and wait.

     Comments:

     The beer is a brown ale with sweetness from the sugars and crystal malt;
     not  much  hop flavor. The maltodextrin contributes a  strange  slightly
     syrupy  quality  (I think)---I might leave it out next time.  Anyway,  I
     thought it was a nice, drinkable brown ale.

     Digest: Issue #324, 12/15/89

     Ingredients:

                    5 pounds   light dry extract
                    3 pounds   2-row pale malt
                    1/2 pound  crystal malt (40L)
                    2 ounces   roasted barley
                    4 ounces   wheat malt
                    2 ounces   dextrin malt
                    2 ounces   Cascade hops (5.2% alpha)
                    1/2 ounce  Tettnanger hops (4.9% alpha)
                    1/2 ounce  Perle hops (7.2% alpha)
                    1/2 ounce  Kent Goldings hops (5.2% alpha)
                    1 teaspoon Irish moss
                    1 pack     Wyeast Irish

     Procedure:

     I  used Papazian's partial mash method, except used 2 gallons of  sparge
     water.  I  got 18 pints of sparge and added two pints of  water  to  the
     boil, along with the dry extract. Boil 60 minutes. Add 1 ounce  Cascade,
     1/4  ounce Perle, and 1/4 ounce Tettnanger at 40 minutes. Add 1/2  ounce
     Cascade,  1/4 ounce Perle, and 1/4 ounce Tettnanger at 30  minutes.  Add
     1/2 ounce Cascade, and 1/2 ounce Kent Goldings in hop bag at 3  minutes.
     Strain into primary fermenter. Transfer hops bag to primary.

     Comments:

     Twelve  days  in the bottle was sufficient. I prefer  this  over  Widmer
     Festbier, after which it was patterned. It's also a lot cheaper.

     Ingredients:

                 6 pounds     Australian dark malt extract syrup
                 2/3 pounds   chocolate malt
                 1/3 pound    crystal malt
                 2 ounces     Perle hops
                 1-1/2 ounces Cascade hops
                              Burton liquid ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Soak malt in a pot of hot water for 1 hour. While soaking, begin boiling
     Australian dark malt with the Perle hops. After 1 hour, add Cascade hops
     and turn off heat. Steep about 30 minutes. Strain everything into  prim-
     ary  and add cold water to bring volume to 5 gallons. Pitch  yeast  when
     cool.

     Comments:

     Barrel  Bottom is a very dark, rich and bitter brew with a full head  of
     tan  foam.  It could pass as a stout. The only bad part is  that  my   5
     gallons  is  almost  gone, in less than  two  months.  Ingredients  were
     obtained from William's Brewing, the Australian extract is their  darker
     variety.

     Ingredients:

                           4 pounds  dark malt extract
                           1/2 pound roast barley
                           1/2 pound crystal malt
                           2 pounds  dark brown sugar
                           2 ounces  Fuggles hops
                           5 tablets saccharin
                                     yeast

     Procedure:

     This recipe uses saccharin, but I will not use this in my beer;  instead
     I  may  add brewer's licorice or lactose for sweetness.  The  amount  of
     fermentables also seems low; I would add a pound or two of light extract
     to  increase the gravity to the mid-fifties. The recipe  also calls  for
     priming  with 3 ounces of black treacle, which is molasses.  This  seems
     low,  and it also seems that different brands  would  contain  different
     amounts of fermentable sugar.

     Comments:

     This recipe is for one of my favorite old ales---Old Peculiar. It  comes
     from Dave Line's book Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy.

     Comments:

     My  last batch came out too light because I added only 1/2 pound of  the
     crystal  malt---I was convinced it was in the 90 Lovibond range. I  also
     used  6.6 pounds of canned extract. The resulting beer was about 1/3  as

                                    finings (follow directions)

     Procedure:

     In three gallons of brewing water, put Black Patent and Chocolate  malt.
     Bring to a boil. After boil just starts, strain out grains. Add  coffee,
     crystal malt, rice syrup, dry ME and 1.5 ounce willemette hops. Boil  45
     min.  Add Cooper Ale Kit, and continue to boil 3 to 5 min. (much  longer
     and  the finishing hops in the Coopers kit make the brew  bitter).  Cool
     and  pitch with Ale yeast from the Cooper Kit. Ferment 7 days. Rack  and
     add finings (or polychlar). When settled, bottle with corn sugar.

                  2           orange rinds
                  1 6" x 3/4" root of ginger
                              (pre-heat in microwave ~ 20 sec
                               - squeeze juice into wort)
                  1 teaspoon  whole cloves (slightly crushed)
                  5 3-inch    cinnamon sticks (slightly crushed)
                  1 teaspoon  Irish moss
                  1 1/2 quart jar new cuttings from Blue Spruce
                              Whitbread dried ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal and patent malts. Remove grain when boil begins. Add  ex-
     tract, honey, cascade hops and yeast nutrient. Boil for 40 minutes.  Add
     Irish Moss. Put fruit and spices in a hop bag and add to wort, squeezing
     bag  every  few minutes with tongs. Boil for addition  10  minutes.  Add
     tettnager  hops and spruce cuttings. Boil 2 minutes. Turn off  heat  and
     strain  hops, but leave the spruce cuttings during cool down. Cool  wort
     for  20 minutes and then remove spruce cuttings. Fill  primary  fementer
     and pitch yeast. Blow off tube is required! After a week, rack to two  5
     gallon carboys and dilute to 5 gallons each.

     Comments:

     After  only  3 weeks I sampled and it tasted great.  Orange  and  spruce
     flavor  very evident. Even my wife liked it until I told her  about  the
     spruce cuttings.

     Ingredients:

          4 pounds     Alexanders light unhopped malt extract
          1-1/2 pounds Light dried malt extract (DME)
          5 AAU's      your favourite bittering hops (e.g. 1/2 ounce. of
                       10% alpha chinook)
          1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer or Tetnanger hops for finishing
                       Ale yeast (Wyeast American Ale #1056,
                       aka Sierra Nevada *strongly* ecomended)

     Procedure:

     Dissolve  the  extracts in 5 gallons of brewing water.  Bring  to  boil.
     After  15 minutes, add bittering hops. Boil 60 minutes total.  Turn  off
     heat and add finishing hops. Cool as rapidly as possible to 60-70F. Rack
     to fermenter, fill to 5 gallons, pitch yeast, relax, etc.

     Comments:

     Ferment as cool as you can muster, to keep the esters down. If you  can,
     rack  the wort off the trub before the fermentation really gets  started
     (i.e.  let it settle out for 4-6 hours, then rack, but pitch  the  yeast
     *first*  to avoid nasty suprises). Use an ale yeast that is clean  (i.e.
     produces  few  esters).  Reportedly,  Wyeast  #1056  (American  Ale)  is
     supposed to be the best yeast in this regard. You can also culture  this
     strain (or one with a *very* similar flavour profile) from Sierra Nevada
     ales.  Boil  the full volume of your wort. The more  dilute  wort  gives
     better hop utilization, and helps avoid carmelization of the wort. After
     bottling  or kegging and subsequent carbonation, let the brew  lager  in
     the refrigerator for 4-6 weeks.

     Let sit for ten days then rack into bottling bucket with disolved  prim-
     ing sugar and bottled.

     Comments:

     Tasted quite smoky and bitter at bottling. Kind of like a Porter  rather
     than  the  brown  ale I had in mind. Four weeks  later...WOW!  Both  the
     smokyness  and  bitterness had mellowed. The beer was  very  dark,  very
     malty with a complex flavor from the molases and black patent malt.  The
     malt was balanced perfectly by the hops. My best beer yet. Had a  thick,
     rich, smooth and long lasting head. I'm not aware of any commercial brew
     with  which  this beer can be compared. It sits between the  brown  ales
     available and something like an imperial stout or Mackeson XXX. Finally,
     don't  Knock the use of a pound of sugar. It comes to only about 1/7  of
     fermentables, sugar is standard in British brewing and most  importantly
     IT WORKED!

                  7 pounds     domestic 2-row pale malted barley

     Procedure:

     Heat  14  quarts of mash water to 135 degrees. Mash-in  for  3  minutes.
     Adjust pH to about 5.3. Protein rest for 30 minutes for 131-128 degrees.
     Conversion  of about 2 hours at 150-141 degrees. Mash-out for 5  minutes
     at  168  degrees. Sparge with 5.5 gallons at 168-165  degrees.   Boil  2
     hours.  Add  boiling  hops at 60 mins and finish hops at  end  of  boil.
     Chill. Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     The only substantial change I'd make to the hopping is to dry-hop rather
     than  finish-hop,  using  the same quantities of the  same  varie  ties.
     After  three weeks of fascinating fermentation, a strong beer  was  pro-
     duced that was intriguingly complex and true to type. After a few months
     in  the bottle it acquired a strong banana-ester component in  the  nose
     that  priming  with corn sugar rather than DME might  have  ameliorated.
     Good stuff, IMHO.

     Comments:

     It's confession time. This was intended to be a Scottish Wee Heavy,  but
     works  much  better as an Old Ale. I just haven't  quite  captured  that
     uniquely  malty characteristic of Scotch ales, but I'm still  trying.  I
     tried  smoking  the crystal malt over a peat fire, which  really  wasn't
     terribly  successful in imparting peaty flavors to the malt.  Next  time
     I'll  get  the peat really soggy; perhaps that will  work  better.  It's
     rich,  vinous, with complex port-like ethers and not a hint  of  astrin-
     gency (a common hard-water problem) or off-flavors. Next time I brew it,
     though, I'll delete the wheat malt (plenty of head, for the style, with-
     out  it)  and the brown sugar (the vinousness is too much for  a  Scotch
     ale), substitute 2 pounds dextrine malt or flaked barley (still  mulling
     this  over) for an equal weight of pale malt, and smoke the cystal  more
     heavily.

     Procedure:

     Steep crystal malt for 30 minutes in 150 degree water. Sparge into  brew
     pot  of  hot water and add malt extract. Bring to boil and add  1  ounce
     Fuggles. 20 minutes later add another ounce. At the 40 minute mark, toss
     in  the final half ounce of fuggles. (Almost threw in a full ounce,  but
     after  tasting wort, decided against it---plenty bitter at this  point.)
     Turn off heat and add Cascades. Stirred down the hops slowly and let sit

               1-1/2 pounds English crystal malt (40 L.)
               1 ounce      chocolate malt

               14 grams     Whitbread dry ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Add  1 teaspoon gypsum (Nashua water is very soft) to 2 1/2  gal  water.
     Heat  to 165 degrees, add grains and dough in at 152 degrees.  Mash  for
     for  75  minutes (152 to 148 degrees). Mash out with  3  quarts  boiling
     water  (gives a temp of 160 degrees. Should be 165 degrees). Draw off  a
     quart  and recirclate for a total of 10 times. Sparge with five  gallons
     water  and 1 teaspoon gypsum at 168 degrees. (Gravity was only 1.055  so
     decided to include 1 pound light M&F DME.) Bring to a boil. Add the  DME
     and 1/2 pound dark brown sugar. At 15 minutes into the add 1 1/2  ounces
     of Kent Goldings. (At 62 minutes, gravity was 1.070 and volume was  low,
     so  added  a  gallon of boiling water.) At 73  minutes,  add  1/2  ounce
     Styrian  Goldings. At 90 minutes, start wort chilling.  After  chilling,
     rack  to  carboy, aerate by gently sloshing the fermenter.  Pitch  rehy-
     drated Whitbread ale yeast, slosh carboy again, install airlock.

     Comments:

     Looks nice, malty smell and taste, noticeably alcoholic, a little harsh.
     It's  been  in the bottle a little over a week now and  is  starting  to
     smooth out. I wish I had made more of this. I like the Scotch Ale style,
     especially now that cool weather is coming.

                      7 pounds     2-row Pale Malted Barley
                      3 1/2 pounds brewers' flaked wheat
                      1/2 pound    crystal malt
                      1 ounce      Chinook hops
                      1 ounce      Willamette hops
                      1 ounce      Northern Brewer leaf hops
                                   Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) yeast
                                   Pediococcus damnosus culture
                                   Brettanomyces bruxellensis culture
                      1 teaspoon   yeast nutrient
                      3/4 cup      dextrose (priming)

     Procedure:

     Baked  all  hops for 1 hour at 300 degrees and left 3 days in  the  open
     air. Mash grains and flaked wheat in 14 quarts of 130 degree water  with
     1  tsp gypsum added, for 5 minutes. Protein rest for 20 minutes  at  140
     degrees.  Starch conversion for 60 minutes at 158-155 degrees. Mash  out
     10  minutes at 170 degrees. Sparge with 170 degree water. Boil  2  hours
     with  hops added near the beginning. Cool. Pitch yeast After 12  days  I
     pitched  the  Pediococcus. I have to admit, I didn't much care  for  the
     taste of either the beer or the starter solution. It only took about  10
     days (and some premature hot weather) to produce decided ropiness, so  I
     pitched the Brettanomyces.

     Comments:

     Marvelous!  Crystal clear, with a pale amber color. A  marvelous  fruity
     aroma, with a distinctive Brettanomyces tang. Sour, but not  excessively
     so, nutty, fruity, with a sort of "old leather" note. Apple-like finish.

     Comments:

     Making a sour brown type beer is somewhat easier than a lambic. So  here
     is my recipe for an excellent sour brown kreik beer.

     The lambic's flavour/aroma is a result of a unique fermentation  process
     involving  a  host of yeasts and bacteria, I  recommend  J.X.  Guinard's
     Lambic  book for more info. It is unfortunate that articles  in  Zymurgy
     wriiten  by  CP lead people to beleive that sour mashing is  a  part  of
     lambic,  perhaps  he  could read Guinards book after all  isn't  he  the
     publisher!

     Digest: Issue #267, 9/30/89

     Ingredients:

                       2-3           cloves
                       2 sticks      cinnamon
                       2 thin slices ginger
                       2-4 teaspoons orange peel
                       2 pounds      honey
                                     yeast
                       1/4 cup       vodka or grain alcohol

     Procedure:

     In  a 1-gallon pot, simmer cloves (lightly cracked), cinnamon  (broken),
     and ginger. Add orange peel. The amount of orange peel will vary depend-
     ing  on  type of honey used. Use less orange peel  with  orange  blossom
     honey, for example. Simmer.

     Add  water  to bring volume to 3 quarts. Return to  simmer.  Add  honey,
     stirring  constantly. Do not boil! Skim off any white scum. If  scum  is
     yellow,  reduce heat. When no more scum forms, remove  from heat,  cover
     pot,  and leave overnight. The next day, strain to remove as much  spice
     particles as possible. Pitch yeast.  Replace pot cover.

     Twelve  hours later, rack mead to 1-gallon jug, leaving dregs of  yeast.
     Top  off  jug, bringing to base of neck. Take a piece  of  clean   paper
     towel,  fold into quarters, and put over mouth of jug. Seal with  rubber
     band.  Ferment for 36 hours, replacing paper towel whenever  it  becomes
     fouled.  Refrigerate  8-12  hours.  Rack to new  jug  and  put  back  in
     refrigerator  for  12 hours. Add 1/4 cup vodka to kill  yeast.  Rack  to
     fresh jug. Refrigerate 3-4 days. Bottle.

     Comments:

     This  is a quickie mead, drinkable in 2 weeks, however, it does  improve
     with  age. Aging at least a couple months is recommended. This  mead  is
     excellent chilled.

     Source: Jonathan Corbet (gaia!jon@handies.ucar.edu)
     Digest: 11/28/88

     Ingredients (for 6-1/2 gallons):

                       7-10 pounds fresh blueberries
                       1-2 pounds  corn sugar
                       1-2 ounces  hops (Cascades is fine)
                       10 pounds   honey
                                   yeast
                                   lemon grass tea (optional)

     Procedure:

     To  make 6-1/2 gallons of mead, Boil the honey, sugar, and hops  for  at
     least  an  hour (although boiling honey is not favored  by  most  digest
     subscribers,  it works fine and is the method used by  Papazian).  Clean
     berries  and mash well.  Put mashed berries, hot wort, and enough  water
     to  make  6-1/2 gallons into a fermenter. Pitch yeast. After  one  week,
     strain   out  berries and rack to secondary. Ferment at least  one  more
     month  and then bottle, priming with corn sugar and perhaps  some  lemon
     grass tea. Age 6 months to a year.

     Comments:

     This mead usually comes out quite dry. This recipe makes 6-1/2 gallons.

     Ingredients:

                            6 pounds     peaches
                            3/4 pint     elderflowers
                            2-1/2 pounds acacia honey
                            1/30 ounce   tannin
                                         Graves yeast
                            1/4 ounce    tartaric acid
                            1/4 ounce    malic acid

     Procedure:

     Press  peaches  (after removing pits).  Dissolve honey in 4  pints  warm
     water, blend in peach juice along with acid, tannin, and nutrients.  Add
     100 ppm sulfite (2 campden tablets). After 24 hours, add yeast  starter,
     allow  to ferment 7 days before adding elderflowers. Ferment on  flowers
     for  3  days then strain off flowers and top off to 1 gallon  with  cold
     water.   Ferment  until specific gravity drops to 10,  then  rack.  Rack
     again when gravity drops to 5, and add 1 tablet campden. Rack again when
     when  a heavy deposit forms, or after 3 months, whichever  comes  first.
     Add another campden tablet. Rack again every 3-4 months, adding a tablet
     after every second racking.

     Comments:

     This  recipe  is based on procedures outlined in Making Mead,  by  Bryan
     Acton  and  Peter Duncan. They advocate the use of campden  rather  than
     boiling because they feel that after boiling for a long time most of the
     essences  of the honey are gone. Read the "Basic Procedures" section  of
     Acton & Duncan for more info.

     Digest: Issue #184, 6/24/89

     Ingredients:

             4-1/2 pounds  wildflower honey
             5-1/2 pounds  partial blueberry honey
             2 tablespoons acid blend
             1 tablespoon  pectic enzyme
             4 pounds      Alexander's Johanissberg Riesling extract
             1 pack        Red Star champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  honey, acid, enzyme and Riesling extract for 1 hour (I have  since
     learned that honey is best not boiled; subsequent batches have been made
     by  holding  the  mixture for 2 hours). Cool and pitch  yeast.  Rack  to
     secondary after 8 days. Bottle after 4 months.

     Comments:

     This  is more winey than your straight mead, but very  pleasant.  Medium
     dry  and  spritzig---very nice as a table wine. Those of you set  up  to
     crush  your  own grapes might try a grape honey mix. A  drink  of  noble

     Procedure:

     Add honey, acid blend, and yeast nutrient to 2 gallons of water and boil
     for  1/2  hour. Add this to 1-1/2 gallons of cold water in  the  primary
     fermenter. Pitch yeast when the temperature reaches 70-75 degrees. Use a
     blow  off tube if you use a carboy. Allow fermentation to proceed for  3
     weeks  or  more  (up to several months). When the  mead  becomes  fairly
     clear,  rack  to secondary.  Attach air-lock. Leave the mead to  sit  at
     least 3 weeks. When yeast settles to bottom and is clear, it is ready to
     bottle.  Adding 3/4 cup of corn sugar at bottling will produce a sparkl-
     ing  mead. Sparkling meads should not be made with an  original  gravity

     Source: Kevin Karplus (karplus@ararat.ucsc.edu), Issue #538, 11/16/90

     Ingredients:

                           3 gallons    water
                           5 pounds     honey
                           1/3 cup      jasmine tea
                           1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
                           2 teaspoons  cinnamon
                           1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
                           1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
                           1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
                                        ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  water, adding tea and spices. Remove from heat and stir in  honey.
     (Some mead makers boil the honey, skimming the scum as it forms).  Cover
     boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes a long time,  so
     start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup
     of water and a tablespoon or two of honey. Add starter to cooled liquid.
     Cover  and  ferment using blow tube or fermentation lock.  Rack  two  or
     three times to get rid of sediment.

     The  less honey, the lighter the drink, and the quicker it can be  made.
     1  pound  per gallon is the minimum, 5 pounds per gallon  is  about  the
     maximum  for a sweet dessert wine. This mead is a metheglin  because  of
     the tea. The yeast is pitched one day after starting the batch, the crud
     skimmed  about 10 days later, then wait 3 days and rack to second-  ary.
     Wait 2 more weeks and bottle---about 4 weeks from start to finish.

     Comments:

     Yield  is  3.1 gallons. Excellent clarity, fairly sweet  flavor,  slight
     sediment, light gold color. An excellent batch.

     Ingredients:

                       3 gallons    water
                       16 pounds    honey
                       1/4 cup      keemun tea
                       1/4 cup      oolong tea
                       2 teaspoons  cinnamon
                       1/2 teaspoon whole anise seed
                       18 clusters  cardamom, crushed
                       20           allspice, crushed
                       1 inch       galingale root, crushed
                                    yeast
                                    unflavored gelatin (fining)

     Procedure:

     Boil  water, adding tea and spices. Remove from heat and stir in  honey.
     (Some mead makers boil the honey, skimming the scum as it forms).  Cover
     boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes a long time,  so
     start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup
     of water and a tablespoon or two of honey. Add starter to cooled liquid.
     Cover  and  ferment using blow tube or fermentation lock.  Rack  two  or
     three times to get rid of sediment.

     This recipe took about 6-1/2 months from brewing to bottling. First rack
     took  place 15 days after brewing. 2nd rack 3 weeks later.  3rd  rack  3
     months  later. Gelatin added 1 month later. Bottled about 2--1/2  months
     later. Yield 3.7 gallons.

     Comments:

     Sweet, smooth, potent. A dessert wine. This is perhaps the best of my 20
     or more batches of mead.

     Ingredients (for 1 gallon):

                      1 gallon     bottled water
                      2 pounds     generic honey
                      1 Medium     lemon zest and juice
                      1/4 teaspoon Red Star Champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Simmer these together and skim off the scum as it rises. If you wait for
     it  all to rise so you can skim just once and you miss the  moment,  the
     scum  sinks, never to rise again. Pitch yeast when cool and kept  it  at
     room  temp  (65-72)  for 5 weeks where it bubbled  about  once  every  5
     seconds for the whole time.

     Comments:

     It  was still bubbling when I bottled. Yes, I plan to begin drinking  it
     soon, before it becomes a grenade six-pack.

     Ingredients:

                            16 pounds wildflower honey
                            5 gallons water

                                      MeV liquid mead yeast culture

     Procedure:

     Pasteurized the honey and fruit at about 180 degrees for 10-15  minutes,
     ran  through a chiller, pitched with VERY vigorous aeration. Let it  sit
     with the fruit in for 7 days, then rack off.

     Comments:

     Now  for  the weirdness. I pitched at about 6 PM. No real  activity  the
     following  day  until  about 4 PM when all of the sudden,  there  was  a
     violent eruption of foam out of the airlock. No warning at all.

     Source: Jay Hersh (hersh@expo.lcs.mit.edu)
     Digest: Issue #643, 5/23/91

     Ingredients:

                  12 pounds    Wildflower Honey
                  2 pounds     blueberries
                  2 teaspoons  gypsum or water crystals
                  3 teaspoons  yeast nutrient
                  1 ounce      Hallertauer Leaf hops
                  1 tablespoon Irish Moss
                  2 packs      Red Star Pastuer Champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  hops, yeast nutrient and water crystals for 30 - 45  minutes.  Add
     Irish Moss in the last 15-30 minutes of the boil. Turn off the heat  and
     add the honey and the blueberries, steep at 180-190 degrees for 15  min-
     utes minimum (30 minutes is ok too).  Pour the whole mixture to a bucket
     or carboy and let cool (or use a wort chiller if you have one). Add  the
     yeast  at  the temperature recommended on the packet  (85-90  degrees  I
     think). Let it ferment. Rack the mead off the fruit after 6-7 days  (you
     can actually let it go longer if you like). Let ferment for 4 more weeks
     in  the secondary then bottle. Other people like to rack their meads  at
     3-4  week intervals and let it keep going in the carboy. I  don't  think
     too  much fermentation went on after the first 4 weeks (I made  this  in
     July  so it fermented fast), so if you keep racking you'll basically  be
     doing  some  of the aging in the carboy, otherwise it will  age  in  the
     bottles.

     Comments:

     This  mead  had a terrific rose color. It took over 8 months  to  really
     age,  and was fantastic after 2 years. It had a nice blueberry  nose  to
     it, and quite a kick.

     Digest: Issue #697, 8/8/91

     Ingredients (for 1 gallon):

                 1 gallon      Water
                 2 pounds      honey
                 1 Thumb size  piece of ginger
                 2 Tablespoons Orange peel (no white pith please)
                               Champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  the  honey and water to a boil skimming off the white  and  brown
     foam  as  you heat it.  Simmer/skim for about 5 minutes  per  gallon  (5
     gallons  = 20 min). When the boiling is almost done, add the ginger  and
     orange  peel. Cool (I usually let it cool "naturally"). Work with  yeast
     (Werka Mead Yeast is good, champagne or general purpose wine yeast  will
     do).  Bottle  after two weeks (while it's still sweet  and  still  quite
     active).  Refrigerate the bottles after another two weeks (to avoid  the
     glass grenade syndrome and to make the yeast settle out of the mead).

     Comments:

     To  quote the original source: "It will be quick and pleasant  from  the
     very start and will keep for a month or more." Other variations included:
     Add lots more honey and let it ferment till it stops. Bottle and wait  a
     month or more, you get champagne.

     Use some other citris fruit peel, such as lemon or grapefruit.

     Add some other fruit flavoring (crushed berries of some sort).

     Load  up on the ginger (my friend makes Death by Ginger by using  pounds
     of ginger per gallon!)

     Ingredients:

                         4 pounds   Buckwheat honey
                         4 ounces   Styrian Goldings hops
                         7 grams    Red Star Ale yeast
                         1 teaspoon acid blend
                         1 teaspoon yeast nutrient
                         1 cup      corn sugar

     Procedure:

     Boil honey and 3 gallons water with 3 ounces hops for 47 minutes, add  1
     ounce  last 7 minutes. Before adding hops, skim off the scum that  rises
     to the top. Cool and pour into fermenter and top to 5 gallons.  Add acid
     blend, nutrients and re-hydrated yeast. When fermentation completes, mix
     with 1 cup sugar, a little yeast and bottle.

     Comments:

     This  was the very first beer I ever made and 7 years ago most people  I
     knew  didn't worry about the bittering units of the hops. I would  guess
     that they were around 3% AAU's. Red star was the main yeast used at  the
     time.  Yeast  nutrient is necessary since the honey does  not  have  the
     required  food for the beasties. I used buckwheat honey because  I  like
     the  flavor. Do not drink this beer until at least 1 month after  bottl-
     ing.  Since  it is made from honey the ale improves with age.  A  bottle
     that  I  saved for 4 and a half years tasted so good that I wish  I  had
     saved  more! The beer had a very nice honey aroma and flavor.  The  hops
     were enough to balance the sweetness. I don't think that I would  change
     anything except try to make more and keep it a while before drinking.

     Ingredients (for 6 gallons):

                     15 pounds     clover honey
                     181 grams     grated ginger
                     2 tablespoons gypsum
                     3 teaspoons   yeast energizer
                     1 ounce       Hallertauer hops (boil)
                     1/2 ounce     Hallertauer hops (finish)
                     4-5 pounds    oranges
                                   juice from 1 orange
                     1/2 teaspoon  irish moss
                                   champagne yeast (Red Star)

     Procedure:

     Combine honey, ginger, orange juice, 1/2 ounce of hops, and yeast  ener-
     gizer and bring to a boil. Remove a small amount of wort to be used  for
     a yeast starter (Allow starter to cool, and add yeast). Boil the remain-
     ing wort 30 minutes. Add another 1/2 oz hops and boil for additional  30
     minutes. Turn off heat. Cut 4-5 lbs of oranges in half, and squeeze into
     the wort. Toss in orange halves after squeezing. Let sit 12 min.  Strain
     into fermenter sparged into cold water, while removing the orange halves
     and squeezing the last bit out (with clean hands---very hot---ouch!).

     Comments:

     After several months it's just getting drinkable now. If I let a  bottle
     sit in the fridge for about a week, and decant very carefully, it's very
     good, and gives one heck of a buzz.

                            3 pounds  brown sugar
                            3 pounds  honey
                            2 packs   champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Strain  3  gallons of cider into a 5-gallon carboy. Strain  1/2   gallon
     into  pot  and heat enough to allow sugar and honey to  thoroughly  dis-
     solve.  Pour  into carboy and finish filling to neck.  Pitch  yeast  and
     seal with airlock. When fermentation stops, bottle. Prime with sugar  to
     add carbonation.

     Comments:

     For this recipe to turn out well, do not use pasteurized apple juice. My
     last  batch  took 3 weeks to ferment. If you notice   unpleasant  smells
     during this time, you can ignore them. Boy, does this turn out great!

     stand for 24 hours to dissipate SO2 from sulfite. Hydrate yeast in 1 cup
     water at 95-104 degrees for 5-10 minutes and then pitch into cider  with
     vigorous  stirring  to  aerate. Primary ferment for  5  days.  Secondary
     ferment for 3 weeks. Prime and bottle as usual.

     Comments:

     This stuff is peaking after 3 months in the bottle, IMHO.

     Ingredients:

               2 to 2-1/2 gallons fresh cider
               1 gallon           water
               1 pound            M&F Light DME (unhopped)
               2 cups             Cane Sugar
               1/2 cup            Brown Sugar Dash of Cinnamon
               7-14 grams         Ale Yeast (Whitbread recomended)

     Procedure:

     Combine  all ingredients except yeast. Boil for about 30  minutes,  skim
     the top if you feel like it. After boiling take this off the stove,  and
     add  about 2 to 2-1/2 gallons of chilled fresh Cider. This  should  drop
     the  temperature  to  below  90 degrees, if not chill  it  to  below  90
     degrees,  then add an Ale Yeast, 7-14 grams of Whitbread or  some  other
     quality  Ale  Yeast as good. I let this ferment in the primary  for  3-5
     days,  then  rack to a secondary and let sit another 10-14  days  before
     kegging. I artifically carbonated this one, but amounts of priming sugar
     typical for Ales would work well too.

     Ingredients (for 3 gallons):

                            3 gallons Cider
                            4 cups    cane sugar
                                      wild yeast (ie. Don't add any yeast)

     Procedure:

     Toss 3 gallons of a good blend of Cider along with 4 cups of cane  sugar
     into  a  carbouy. Shake until the sugar dissolves. Put a blow  off  hose
     into the top of the carbouy and let stand at room temperature.  After  a
     few  days (or even weeks) the wild yeast will take off and  things  will
     start moving in the carbouy and blow off will rise up from the cider. Be
     sure  to empty the blowoff jar as needed. Eventually things will  settle
     down,  then put an airlock on and take the blow off hose off. Place  the
     carbouy  in a cool dark place (45-55 degrees). After 2-3 months you  can
     rack  this off to another carbouy. At this point you can rack onto  some
     unpreserved raisins which will add yeast nutrients and sugars and kick in
     a  secondary  ferment.  Let this go for a month or  two  more  and  then
     bottle.  You  can prime at bottling time if you want a  sprakling  cider
     (use  bottles  that  can handle some pressure  like  American  Champagne
     bottles), or unprimed for a still cider.

     Ingredients:

             5 gallons      Apple Juice (Gravenstein/Jonathan blend)
             6 cups         Maple Syrup
             7/3 tablespoon Whole Cloves
             1/2 tablespoon Whole nutmeg, grated
             10 4-inch      cinnamon sticks
             3              lemons (juice and zest)
             2 inches       ginger root, peeled and grated
             1 pack         Red Star Champagne Yeast

     Procedure:

     Simmer 3/4 gallon apple juice, spices and ginger (in spice bags), syrup,
     and lemon juice and zest for 45 mins. Add simmered mix to 4--1/4 gallon.
     Put  cider  in carboy. Pitch yeast and top off with  more  apple  juice.
     Ferment  for  34  days. Rack to secondary and top off  with  more  apple
     juice.  Prime  with 3/4 cup corn sugar and bottle. Age for 30  days  and
     consume.

     Comments:

     Good sparkle, mildly yeasty (not careful enough with my secondary  rack-
     ing), complex flavor, some spice in the nose, too much alcohol (my calcs
     say that the alcohol content is about 15%, but it tastes much stronger).
     In general, I'm pretty pleased; almost everybody who's tried it has been
     pleased as well.

     Source: David Herron (mailrus!ukma!davids.UUCP!david)
     Digest: Issue #48, 1/10/89

     Ingredients:

                        2-1/2 pounds rice (husked or raw)
                        1/2 pint     grape concentrate
                        7 pints      hot water
                        2-1/2 pounds corn sugar or honey
                        3 teaspoons  acid blend
                        3/4 teaspoon yeast energizer
                        1 tablet     Campden
                        1 pack       sherry yeast

     Procedure:

     Wash  and  crush rice. Place rice in nylon straining bag  and  place  in
     primary.  Pour  hot water over rice and stir in all  ingredients  except
     yeast  and engergizer. Wait 48 hours. Add yeast and energizer and  cover
     primary.  Stir daily, checking gravity and pressing pulp  lightly.  When
     gravity reaches 1.050 (2-3 days), add another 1/4 pound dissolved  sugar
     or  honey per gallon. When gravity drops to 1.030 (6-7 days) strain  any
     juice  from  bag.  Rack to secondary. Attach airlock. Rack  again  in  2
     months,  if  necessary. Bottle when ready. It is  possible  to  continue
     building  up  alcohol  by adding  additional  sugar  until  fermentation
     ceases. For a sweeter drink, add 1/2 teaspoon  stabilizer and 1/4  pound
     dissolved sugar.

     NOTE: Any additional sugar added should be corn sugar, not cane sugar.

     Comments:

     This recipe came from a collection of wine recipes by Raymond Massaccesi
     titled  Winemakers Recipe Handbook. Various digest subscribers  question
     the authenticity of this recipe. Sake should contain only rice---no corn
     sugar,  grape  concentrate,  or honey.  Authentic sake  should  also  be
     inoculated  with koji. There is a sake brewery in Berkeley,  California,
     that  will  conduct tours for those interested in  learning  more  about
     sake.  Sake  is discussed by Fred Eckhardt in Best of Beer  and  Brewing
     Vol.  1-5,  available  from  the  AHA.  Koji  is  available  from  Great
     Fermentations of Santa Rosa.

     Note  to 2nd Edition: Fred Eckhardt is now putting out a brief  newslet-
     ter,  on an infrequent periodic basis, geared strictly toward  the  sake
     brewer.  He lists various places to buy koji, sources of polished  rice,
     commercial sake brewers, etc.

     Digest: Issue #338, 1/9/90

     Ingredients:

                         2 ounces  birch beer extract
                         10 ounces root beer extract
                         1 pound   honey
                         1 cup     blackstrap molasses
                         1 cup     grade B maple syrup
                         1 gallon  sugar (about 8 pounds)

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 15 gallons. Mix all ingredients in a standard keg. Add
     water to fill keg. Carbonate. Drink.

     Comments:

     I  thought  the  molasses  taste was a bit harsh  and  will  try  either
     regular molasses, or use less. I will also try substituting 2 ounces  of
     sarsaparilla extract for 2 ounces of the rootbeer extract.   This recipe
     makes  a  strong  tasting  rootbeer with about  half  the  sweetness  of
     commercial rootbeers. This was made with artificial carbonation, but  it
     could be adapted to make alcoholic rootbeer by substituting malt extract
     for some of the sugar.

     Ingredients:

                  1/2 pound     fresh ginger, peeled and grated
                  1             lemon
                  5 teaspoons   cream of tarter

                  2-1/2 gallons water
                                lager yeast

     Procedure:

     This  stuff  is  dangerous---do not make it.  WARNINGS:  Use  only  real
     champagne bottles, beer bottles will explode. If left out of fridge more
     than  4 weeks, bottles will explode. Do not leave in fridge more than  4
     weeks after bottles start to scare you, otherwise, bottles will explode.
     Set  off  outside---corks go 60-70'. Do not let bottles sit  around  too
     long---I'm not kidding!

     Peel  and  grate ginger. Grate lemon, squeeze, and  cut  remainder  into
     slices. Boil all ingredients, mixing. Cool to 80 degrees or less and add
     lager  yeast. Ferment 3-7 days, then bottle in champagne  bottles.  Wire
     down plastic corks. Leave out 1 week, then move to  cool area. Chill and
     test open 1 bottle each week until they start to scare you, then put all
     bottles in fridge and drink within 2 weeks.

     Comments:

     I've  been making this for many years. It is very carbonated, and  quite
     refreshing.  Also, because it has a limited shelf life (after  which  it
     explodes),  it  prompts lots of impromptu ginger beer  parties.  I  call
     several  friends to say "I'm setting off a dozen ginger  beers  tomorrow
     afternoon. Wanna come?"

     liquer:teatea:liquerSteep  the tea in the rum for 24 hours, and  remove.
     Make  the sugar syrup by boiling 1 cup of sugar in 1/2 cup of water  (it
     will be VERY thick). When the syrup cools, add to the rum. It's ready to
     drink immediately.

     Comments:

     This is a very nice after dinner liqueur, but you may drink it any  time
     you want to. If the tea flavor is too strong, try steeping for a shorter
     time, cutting down on the amount, etc. Likewise, the amount of sugar may
     be a bit excessive for many tastes, so experiment.

     Ingredients (for 1 gallon):

                1 gallon   water
                3-4 ounces fresh ginger
                2          lemons
                2 cups     sugar (sucrose or brown sugar or both)
                           Yeast

     Procedure:

     Peel  the ginger and slice into 1/8 inch slices. Mix the water with  the
     sugar  and put in the ginger. Boil an hour or so. Slice the lemons,  add
     to the boil, and boil for about 15 minutes. Allow to cool to room  temp-
     erature. Add yeast. Let the yeast grow overnight. Bottle in very  strong
     bottles.  Let sit at room temperature for about 12 hours  to  carbonate.
     Put bottles in the fridge. Open very carefully.

     Comments:

     Every time I did not peel the ginger, the yeast did not multiply proper-
     ly.  There  may be a causal relationship. The more you  let  the  lemons
     boil, the more bitterness will be extracted from the peels. For a result
     a  lot like Canada Dry's Bitter Lemon, increase the number of lemons  to
     4, let the lemons boil for about 1/2 hour, and cut back on the ginger.

     Digest: Issue #709, 8/26/91

     Ingredients (for 1 gallon+):

                     1 Gallon     Water (for ale)
                     2 cups       water (for making extract)
                     2 ounces     Fresh Ginger root
                     2 cups       sugar
                     1 tablespoon vanilla extract
                     1/8 teaspoon yeast

     Procedure:

     Slice the ginger into thin sections and add them to two cups of  boiling
     water.  Simmer this on very low heat for 20 minutes. While this is  sim-
     mering,  boil the gallon of water and two cups of sugar for  one  minute
     and set aside. Pour the pan with the ginger into a blender and blend  on
     high  for  about one minute. Strain this extract into the  sugar  water.
     With  a soup ladle, pour a few cups of the hot brew through the pulp  to
     extract a bit more of the ginger flavor. Cool to room temperature.  When
     cool,  add  vanilla. Add yeast, stir and let sit for about  30  minutes.
     Then bottle and age.

     Comments:

     I  recommend  that you do not alter the recipe on the  first  batch.  On
     subsequent batches you can alter the amount of ginger, sugar and vanilla
     to suit your own taste.

     Ingredients:

                    1-2 pounds ginger (yes, pounds!)
                    5-7 pounds corn sugar
                    1-2 pounds sucrose (table sugar)
                               juice of several (3) citroids
                               (lemon, lime, grapefruit, combination of
                               high citric fruits like lime with oranges)
                               various additives (fruitoids, spice thangs,
                               herbs, hops, or whatever floats yer boat)
                    2 packages champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Chop ginger (leave that skin on!) in discs and blend with hot water. Use
     plenty  of water, then filter homogenized ginger through several  layers
     of cheesecloth. Squeeze dry, then add more water and squeeze again.  Add
     water  to make about 2 gallons, heat, and dissolve in sugars.  Bring  to
     boil, add citroid juices, and boil stirring frequently (to avoid  exces-
     sive  sugar  carmelization) for about 30 minutes.  Pour  into  fermenter
     containing 2 + gallons cold water carefully (to avoid hot stuff on  cold
     glass)  and  add more water to make about 5  gallons.  Pitch.   Ferment.
     Bottle. Drink.

     Comments:

     If  adding  fruit, do so 5 minutes after you stop boil and  give  it  10
     minutes  to  pastuerize a bit. Dump the whole bleeding  thing  into  the
     fermenter, and strain off the fruit when passing into secondary (or just
     fergit  the secondary and strain when bottling). I personally prefer  to
     make  a  fruit extract (blend fruit and strain off juice)  and  add  the
     juice  to the finished product. Remember to bottle  before  fermentation
     stops, and be careful about the priming (1/2 to a maximum of 3/4 cup).

     There  are a couple of considerations....this stuff is high octane  brew
     (10% alcohol and up) and it is very similar to champagne (high gas pres-
     sure)  so  I  would ask you to be very careful with  your  bottles  (use
     _only_  champagne  bottles) or avoid the danger of explosion and  use  a
     Cornelius  keg. Don't let this stuff ferment out completely so it has  a
     bit  of residual sweetness to mask any slight off flavours...being  made
     of sugar and ginger, it has no body to mask imperfections. Fruit is also
     a  nice  addition, either with the pre-fermented mass or  in  the  Dutch
     style as a final addition a few hours (1 day tops) before bottling.

     Digest: Issue #819, 2/7/92

     Ingredients:

             500 grams  Rye-bread
             8 litres   water
             25 grams   yeast (the book mentions yeast to make bread)
             225 grams  sugar
             4 spoons   luke warm water
             1          lemon
             2 spoons   raisins
             2 branches peppermint

     Procedure:

     Put the slices of rye-bread in the oven (200 degrees Celsius) for  about
     45  mins, until they're dried. Boil the 8 liters of water.  Crumble  the
     dried  rye-bread, put it in the boiling water for about 5 mins.  Let  it
     the  water,  and rye-bread rest for 4 hours, covered with  a  tea-cloth.
     Crumble the yeast, 15 mins before the 4 hours are over. Mix the crumbled
     yeast with some sugar and the luke warm water. Let it rest for 15  mins.
     Filter the water-rye-bread mix in a kitchen sieve. Carefully extract all
     water from the rye- bread. Wash, and peel the lemon. Add the lemon-peel,
     the  sugar, the yeast and the pepermint. Stir the solution, and  let  it
     rest  (covered) for 8 hours. Sieve the solution (tea-cloth). Bottle  it.
     Put some raisins, a bit of lemon-peel, and a fresh leaf of peppermint in
     every  bottle, close the bottles, and keep them in a cool place.   Ready
     when the raisins start floating. Sieve the stuff one more time in a tea-
     cloth. Put the Kvas in the fridge 4 hours before drinking.

     Comments:

     I  got  this recipe from a book called dinerparty a  la  perestrojka.  I
     tried it once, it tasted terrible, but that was probably due to the fact
     that the rye-bread was almost burned.

     This is more or less the description the book gives. Remember this is  a
     recipe for non-brewers. It is a cookbook after all.

     Digest: 2/11/92

     Ingredients (for 10 bottles):

                 1 pound      Dry Black Bread
                 24 cups      Boiling Water
                 1 1/2 pounds Sugar
                 2 ounces     Fresh Compressed Yeast
                 1/2 cup      Sultanas (yellow seedless raisins)

     Procedure:

     Put  the  bread into a large container and then add the  boiling  water.
     When  the  mixture is lukewarm squeeze the liquid from  the  bread  very
     thoroughly,  making  sure that the bread itself does  not  come  through
     because this clouds the drink.

     Add  the sugar and yeast, mix, cover and leave for ten hours.  Pour  the
     drink into clean bottles, and three sultanas to each, put the corks  and
     tie them down---then refrigerate immediately.

     Comments:

     This  recipe is from an old wine and spirits book I have at home.  Kvass
     is very refreshing on a hot summer's day and is quickly made from  black
     bread and yeast. It is quite like weak beer and is fermented and slight-
     ly  alcoholic, but must be stored in the refrigerator using  corks,  not
     screw-in stoppers or else it will go on fermenting and blow.

     This,  to  me, looks very similar to the Sumerian  recipe  which  Anchor
     Brewery of San Francisco recreated a couple of years ago.

     Digest: Issue #685, 7/23/91

     Ingredients (for 2--1/4 gallons):

          2 gallons            water
          1 1/2 cups           honey
          3 tablespoons        ground sarsaparilla
          1 tablespoon         sassafras
          1 heaping tablespoon hops
          1/4 teaspoon         ground coriander
          1/4 teaspoon         wintergreen extract (Almost all natural)
          1/4 teaspoon         yeast

     Procedure:

     Place the sarsaparilla, sassafras, hops, and coriander into an  enameled
     or  stainless  steel  pan. Cover them with water and bring  to  a  boil.
     Reduce  the  heat  and allow them to just barely simmer  for  12  hours,
     making sure the water does not all evaporate. Strain out the solids  and
     add the liquid to 2 gallons of water that has been boiled and cooled  to
     lukewarm.  Stir  in the honey, wintergreen extract, and the  yeast  dis-
     solved  in 2/3 cup warm water. Stir the mixture thoroughly and allow  it
     to mellow for several hours. You can then siphon off the root beer  into
     a  clean  container before bottling, or fill  the  bottles  immediately.
     Makes about two dozen 12-ounce bottles.

     Source:

     Ingredients (for 2-1/4 gallons):

                2 5/8 cups   honey
                5 cups       sugar
                2 gallons    water
                3            beaten egg whites
                1 tablespoon ginger moistened with a little water
                Juice of 4 lemons
                1/4 teaspoon yeast
                1 whole      lemon

     Procedure:

     Dissolve  the  honey  or sugar in 2 gallons water. Add  the  beaten  egg
     whites  and ginger. Bring to a boil and skim. Most of the flavor of  the
     ginger  will have been given out, so don't worry that you loose much  of
     it  in  the skimming. Add the whole lemon and set the mixture  aside  to
     cool.  When it is lukewarm, add the lemon juice and the yeast  dissolved
     in  1/4  cup  warm water. Stir well and let stand for a  while  for  the
     sediment  to settle to the bottom. Strain through a cloth into  a  clean
     container.  Give  it a few more minutes to settle and you are  ready  to
     bottle.

     water to within 3 inches of top. Add yeast solution and cover. After  6-
     10  hours remove foam with wire strainer. Let sit until hydrometer  says
     "bottle."  Fill bottles, adding 1/2 teaspoon sugar to each. Cap and  let
     stand 21 days.

     Comments:

     Back  when  I  first  started making beer  (about  20  years  ago  now)I
     actually made several batches using this recipe. The results varied from
     barely drinkable to snail bait. I especially like his comparison in  the
     last line of the original---"This should make 5 cases of pint bottles of
     beer equal to or superior to Millers High Life."

     Ingredients:

                                   rose petals
                                   water
                                   sugar
                                   dry yeast

     Procedure:

     Fill  a glass container with rose petals. Cover with water and let  set,
     covered  by a clean cloth, for 3 days. Strain water through a cloth  and
     measure.  Add to it, one quarter of its volume of white sugar. Set in  a
     glass  jar or crock, add a pinch of dry yeast and stir well. When it  is
     sparkling  (3  days to a week), put into beer or champagne  bottles  and
     cap. Age 1-6 months.

     Comments:

     This recipe comes from a booklet called The Delicious Rose by  Geraldine
     Duncann. It was called Rose Melemell, although it has no honey. This  is
     an effervescent brew with a hint of summer roses.

     Ingredients:

              1 can     hop-flavored malt syrup
              3/4 pound granulated sugar
              1 cake    compressed yeast (or Vierka dry lager yeast)

     Procedure:

     Dissolve syrup and sugar in boiling hot water---pour into cold water  to
     make  five gallons---allow to further cool for two hours, then  add  one
     cake  yeast.  Cover crock or other fermenting vessel with  clean  cloth.
     Keep  in  a cool, dark place. Watch carefully and when  bubbles  of  gas
     cease  coming  to  surface fermentation has been  completed  and  liquor
     should be quite clear (approximately four days).

     Now  siphon off clear liquid to another clean crock, leaving  the  thick
     sediment behind. To the liquor in the second crock add 1/4 pound  granu-
     lated  sugar and stir until dissolved. Fill into bottle by siphoning  or
     pouring.  Cap and immediately store in a cool dark place.  The  beverage
     will be ready for use when clear---requires one to two weeks.

     Comments:

     One crock can be eliminated if the liquid is siphoned directly into  the
     bottles from the fermented crock. In this case, place 1/2 teaspoon sugar
     in  each pint or one teaspoon in each quart bottle. Best consistent  re-
     sults can be obtained if a five gallon bottle is used instead of a crock
     for  the fermenting vessel, using a water seal. All vessels  and  tubing
     should be entirely clear and sanitary before use. A 2-3% warm lye  solu-
     tion is an excellent one for the purpose. Rinse with water after the use
     of lye solution. Use of Hydrometer is not necessary if the above  direc-
     tions  are followed. The specific gravity at the time of  bottling  will
     however, be 1.012 - 1.016.

     This  is  the third and final installment  of  traditional  "Prohibition
     Pilsner"  recipes  received anonymously, presumably from the  makers  of
     Blue  Ribbon  malt syrup, in the mid-1970's.  Previous  installments  of
     Historical Homebrew appeared in Homebrew Digest # 795 and # 800. This is
     posted  here  purely for historical interest, and not as  a  recommended
     recipe,  although the techniques called for here seem to be much  closer
     to currently recommended procedures for beginning brewers, than in the
     earlier  historical postings. The format of the original is retained  as
     much as possible.

     Digest: Issue #795, 1/6/92

     Ingredients:

                    1-3/4 pounds sugar
                    1 can        Blue Ribbon hop-flavored malt syrup
                                 yeast

     Procedure:

     Dissolve sugar and malt syrup in 6 quarts of hot water. Stir until  dis-
     solved. Pour 14 quarts of cold water into a crock that has been  scoured
     with Arm & Hammer baking soda and rinsed with clear water. Add hot solu-
     tion  of  malt, sugar, and water. The temperature should be  about  65F.
     Dissolve a cake of compressed or dehydrated yeast in a small quantity of
     luke  warm  water (about 8 ounces of 75F water) and add to  crock.  Stir
     thoroughly.  Cover  crock with clean cloth and allow to ferment 4  or  5
     days. Skim off foam after first and second days.

     Siphon  beer into 12 ounce bottles. Before siphoning, place a scant  1/2
     teaspoon  of sugar into each bottle. Cap and allow to remain  at  60-70F
     for 7-10 days. Cool and consume.

     Things  to remember: Cleanliness of utensils, including bottles,  siphon
     hose, crowns and crock is essential for good results. Wash everything in
     soda  solution or detergentbefore and after each batch. A 7 or 9  gallon
     crock can be used to prevent messy foam-over.

     Many consumer failures can be averted by using a starter consisting  of:
     1 package of yeast, 2 ounces of sugar, 1 pint of 72F water. Let  starter
     stand for 3-4 hours before mixing into crock with malt solution.

     Comments:

     Around 1975 or '76, the first time I got interested in brewing, I bought
     a can of the mysterious Blue Ribbon malt syrup. The label invited me  to
     write to Premier malt products for a recipe book, and I did. A few weeks
     later it arrived: a well-produced, four-color print job with recipes for
     using  malt  syrup in cakes, cookies, biscuits and the like, but  not  a
     word about making beer. A few weeks later a plain brown envelope with no
     return address appeared in the mail. Inside were two mimeographed sheets
     of beer recipes---including this recipe.

     Digest: Issue #795, 1/6/92

     Ingredients:

                    1 can         hop flavored malt syrup
                    3 or 4 pounds sugar
                    1 cake        yeast or Vierka lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Dissolve malt syrup and sugar in 2 quarts of hot water. Pour into  crock
     and  add 18-20 quarts of cold water. Mix yeast in lukewarm water  (70F).
     With wooden spoon, gently stir into malt and sugar mix. Cover with clean
     cloth and ferment at room temperature (68-70F). Skim off foam for  first
     3 days. Fermentation is complete when no more bubbles appear (about 4 or
     5  days). If tester or hydrometer is used, be sure red line is  at  sur-
     face. Gelatin may be used to settle yeast. Dissolve two small  envelopes
     of  Knox  gelatin in hot water. Pour gelatin over top of brew  in  crock
     about a day before you plan to bottle.

     Wash bottles and put scant 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in each, fill within an
     inch and a half and cap. Tip bottles upside down once and store  upright
     in warm place (70-75F).

     Things to watch: 1) If beer is cloudy or gritty, you disturbed the sedi-
     ment by shaking or pouring too fast, 2) If beer tastes flat, you  either
     bottled  too  late or did not allow it to age long enough,  3)  If  beer
     foams up or tastes airy, you bottled too soon.

     Comments:

     This  recipe also came from the mimeographed sheet of beer recipes  pro-
     vided by Premier Malt Products in the 1970's.

     Comments:

     I  made this after two Civil War beers (bay leaf/ginger and  the  spruce
     beer). I had molasses and the barm from the second Civil War beer, so  I
     brewed this. I used 2 ounces of hops. (It really doesn't make much  dif-
     ference  what  kind.  The water is pretty bitter after  boiling  for  an
     hour.)  I  let it ferment a week before bottling. It is  undrinkable  by
     modern  standards.  The only flavor is the bitterness of  the  molasses,
     followed by the hop bitterness. The flavors never melded; there is  just
     the distinct double bitterness. One pound of molasses is about one  pint
     in volume.

     Most of these historical beer recipes can be found in Brewed in America,
     by Stanley Baron.

     An  anonymous  recipe  for pumpkin ale appeared in  the  papers  of  the
     American Philosophical Society in February, 1771. The author notes  that
     he  obtained this recipe from someone who claimed this tasted like  malt
     ale,  with  only a slight "twang". After two years in the  bottle,  this
     twang had mellowed to an acceptable level.

     Digest: Issue #748, 10/25/91

     Directions for Brewing Malt Liquors:

     You are first to have ready the following Implements, a mash Vat, to put
     your  malt in; a Vessel under this to receive the Wort in; a  Copper  to
     boil  in;  a  Rudder to stir your malt with, and Vessels  to  cool  your
     Liquor  in; First then fill your Copper with water, take then 6  Bushels
     of  Malt  and put into your mash Vat, leaving about a Peck  to  sprinkle
     over  the  Liquor  when in, Let your water simper, and be  in  the  next
     degree of boiling but not boil; lay it on upon the Malt well ground, and
     when  you have laid on such a quantity as you can draw off a  Barrel  of
     Wort,  stir the malt well together with your Rudder; and  then  sprinkle
     the  remaining Peck of Malt over all covering it up with Cloths to  keep
     the  heat in; for three hours; only when it have stood an hour and  half
     draw off a pail full or two; and lay it on again to clear your tap hole.
     This done the next Business is to boil a Copper of Water, to scald  your
     other Vessels with; always taking care to have a Copper of Liquor hot to
     lay on, upon the malt when you draw off the first Wort, and this will be
     for  small  Beer. The three hours now expired; let go (as the  Term  is)
     which  is let the first wort run off, putting into the Vessel which  re-
     ceives it a pound of Hops; when all drawn off lay on the hot Liquor  for
     your  small Beer, clean out your Copper and put the wort, Hops  and  all
     into  the Copper and boil it for two hours; strain it then off  thro:  a
     Sieve into your Vessels to cool it; and put your small Beer into  Copper
     and  the same hops that come out of the first Beer and boil it an  hour.
     When both are almost cool add Yeast to them; to set it to work, breaking
     the head in every time it rises; till it works itself clear and tun  in;
     Bung it up with Clay and keep it in your Cellar, in three months you may
     bottle the strong Beer, the other in a weeks time will be fit to drink.

     Source: Thomas Manteufel (tomm@pet.med.ge.com)
     Digest: Issue #748, 10/25/91

     Procedure:

     The stalks, green as they were, as soon as pulled up, were carried to  a
     convenient  trough, then chopped and pounded so much, that, by  boiling,
     all the juice could be extracted out of them; which juice every  planter
     almost knows is of saccharine a quality almost as any thing can be,  and
     that  any thing of a luxuriant corn stalk is very full of it, ...  After
     this  pounding, the stalks and all were put into a large  copper,  there
     lowered  down  it its sweetness with water, to an equality  with  common
     observations  in malt wort, and then boiled, till the liquor in a  glass
     is  seen to break, as the breweres term it; after that it  is  strained,
     and boiled again with hops. The beer I drank had been made above  twenty
     days, and bottled off about four days.

     Canvass-bag,  viz.  Cloves,  Mace, of each half an Ounce,  and  as  much
     Cinnamon, of Nutmeg an Ounce, with two Ounces of Ginger, and a Gallon of
     Honey:  boil all these together half an hour longer, but do not skim  it
     at all: let it boil in, and set it a cooling after you have taken it off
     the  fire. When it is cold, put six spoonfuls of barm to it, and let  it
     work  twelve  hours at least; then Tun it, and put a  little  Limon-peel
     into it: and then you may bottle it, if you please.

     Ingredients:

              3 pounds  honey per gallon of water
              1/2 ounce ginger root, sliced, per gallon
              2 medium  oranges (meat & peel with all pith removed)
              3 whole   cloves

     Procedure:

     Combine the above ingredients with 1/2 gallon of water per total gallons
     desired,  boiling  and skimming until no more scum  appears.  Pour  into
     primary  fermenter,  add: 1 stick cinnamon and top off to  five  gallons
     with  cool  water. Upon the wort reaching 75 degrees F, pitch  Red  Star
     Chanpagne yeast and cap with a ferment- ation lock. Upon a visible  ces-
     sation of fermentation (around 3 weeks) rack into a secondary  fermenter
     with  fermentation lock and allow to age. Rack every month  after  until
     drunk.  May be drunk after 3 weeks. (he suggests also adding 2 tbsps  of
     lemon juice and a cup of strong black tea.)

     I've  never tried this recipe, so I can't vouch for how good it is,  but
     the  basic  elements  are there. Recipe is based on The  Closet  of  the
     Eminently  Learned Sir Kenelme Digby Kt. Opened: Whereby  is  Discovered
     Several ways for making of Metheglin, Sider, Cherry-Wine, &c..

     Procedure:

     Put in a six-quart pot one pint of honey and nine pints of water (spring
     water is suggested but not necessary). Stir well, dissolving the  honey.
     Boil  for  about 30 minutes, skimming off the foam as it  rises  to  the
     surface.  About  1 minute before you remove the liquid  from  the  heat,
     throw  in a teaspoon of rinsed, sliced, or broken ginger (powdered  will
     not  do  the right thing) and about the same amount of the  rind  of  an
     orange (eat the rest of the orange). Set the mead aside for a few  hours
     till it be lukewarm (5 hours is more than enough) and then add yeast  to
     the  mead, stirring well. Mead yeast is the real yeast to use,  but  any
     wine yeast will do. Do not use brewer's yeast or ale yeast. Let the mead
     stand  a day or two (you can wait as much as a week if you  want);  then
     bottle  it  in clean bottles. In a few days it is drinkable, I  like  to
     wait a week.

     Comments:

     This recipe was taken from the SCA's Known World Handbook in an  article
     written by Michael Tighe (Sir Michael of York).

     (My  notes on above recipe: play with the flavorings! If you don't  like
     giner, try using nutmeg instead. This produces a very low alcohol drink,
     yet  well-carbonated and sweet to the taste, though not cloying.) A  few
     other things: Metheglin is fun to make: what I did was used  honey/water
     ratios suggested for a generic mead, then went to the local  health-food
     store  and  browsed  in the spice section ("This smells good  -  grab  a
     handful")  Nothing  scientific about this---a little of this  and  that.
     DON'T  boil these herbs and spices in your wort! Instead, make  a  "tea"
     and add that to the wort as you pitch your yeast.

     For any spices or herbs you use, never use the powdered stuff out of the
     jar if you can avoid it. Powdered cloves just don't have the same  taste
     as  whole  cloves (by the way, for nutmegs: if you don't have  a  nutmeg
     grinder, use a hammer!)

     Finally: to boil or not to boil. A friend made an unboiled mead and when
     he bottled it wound up with a wax deposit on the bottom 1/2 inch in  his
     bottles. No harm, but esthetically icky.

     Ingredients:

                      1 3-pound can hop-flavored malt syrup
                      3 pounds  corn sugar
                      1 package settler
                      1 cake    Fleischmann's yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring one gallon water to boiling point using a pan large enough to hold
     water,  malt syrup and corn sugar. Add malt syrup and stir until  mixed.
     Stir  in corn sugar slowly until dissolved. Settler should be  mixed  in
     with sugar at this time for best results.history:prohibition

     Place  crock  on box or chair (not on floor), pour in three  gallons  of
     luke warm water, then add hot ingredients. Now add sufficient luke  warm
     water to make 5 and 1/2 gallons of liquid in the 6 gallon crock.

     Dissolve  yeast  in cup of luke warm water and 1 teaspoon  sugar.  Allow
     mixture  to stand until yeast starts working, usually within  1/2  hour.
     Add  the  working  yeast  to  mixture in  crock  and  stir  until  mixed
     throughly.

     Chill  before  serving. When pouring, slant bottle and  glass  and  pour
     slowly to prevent clouding.

     If  it  is cloudy or tastes gritty, you have disturbed the  sediment  by
     shaking it up or by pouring too fast.

     If it tastes "flat" you either bottled it too late, or did not allow  it
     to age long enough.

     If  it tends to foam up or tastes "airy", you bottled it too  soon.  The
     mixture had not completed.

     Use  of tester. Tester is accurate when it is kept at uniform 65 or  70.
     The  tester  will  settle the first day between 3 and  6.  This  is  the
     approximate alcohol content. When the tester settles to 1/2% or the  red
     line  "B" it is ready to bottle. If the test settles to "W" it means  it
     is too flat. Taste to determine if it has turned sour. If not, then  add
     one  teaspoon of sugar to the quart of 1/2 teaspoon to the  pint  before
     capping,  to  resotre  life to it. In the event it  has  soured,  it  is
     spoiled.

     Comments:

     My  sister-in-law's  mother gave this following recipe to me.  It  dates
     back  to  the  1930's. They grew up in a predominantly  Polish  part  of
     Chicago  where  it was traditional to make home-made  beer  for  festive
     occasions  (like Christmas!). The recipe is pretty rough by  our  modern
     homebrewing  standards,  but it shows that the  homebrewing  spirit  was
     alive and well several decades ago.
