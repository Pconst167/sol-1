The Atmospheric Test Site


Well, after calling 617/536-1180, I have figured out what the hell this
thing is, as well as the commands you can use to run it. Basically, it's 
an atmospheric pollutant monitoring device, and we are 99% sure it is 
operated out of that trailer in Kenmore Sq. Basically, this system is 
hooked up to a variety of monitoring devices, which measure the 
concentration (in parts per million; PPM) of various pollutants. Current 
temperature is also recorded (in Kelvin). The computer takes a 
measurement every minute and by using different commands, you can even go 
back in to stored records of measurements (as far back as 5 days ago) 
tests are made every minute of every day.

Commands consist of single letters and numbers. Commands function as 
hotkeys, and echoed as they are typed, and illegal commands are echoed as 
well with an accompanying question mark.

In this file I provide some captures of data when I played with the 
system, and a command summary to top things off.

I wonder if this is a proprietary system, or if there are others like it 
out there anyway, if anyone finds another, please let me know!

Here's an example of what you can do when you first call the system 
(8N1), it immediately responds to you by printing out the last minute's 
recorded data:

-------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECT 2400/NONE
17:10:00  0018  01  KENMORE SQ  01/18/92
=================================================
CHAN      NO    NO2    NOX   TEMP     CO    SO2
UNITS    PPM    PPM    PPM  DEG K    PPM    PPM
=================================================
17:00  0.044  0.029  0.073    269    1.2  0.013
-------------------------------------------------------------
I typed nothing in as soon as connection was made, the system spits out 
the time of the last measurement, and the readings in PPM...the 
pollutants measured are common NO, NO2 (nitrogen dioxide, NOT nitrous 
oxide), NOX (meaning all NO groups combined, like NO, NO2, NO3, etc.), 
the temperature in degrees Kelvin, CO (carbon monoxide) and SO2 (nasty 
sulfur pollutant...makes acid rain in the clouds).

Type "t" to get the current time and date.
-------------------------------------------------------------
TIME IS  17:14:07    0018  KENMORE SQ  01/18/92  07B2
-------------------------------------------------------------
Neat, eh?  Now type "1" to get the yesterday's readings in 1 hour
intervals.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Other numbers will get you previous day's test results. Hitting "a" will 
get you a raw HEX dump of the data for the current day. No nice tables 
with headings! Note the number "0018" which is the date of the test. 
These dumps cover the entire day at 1 hour intervals.  Probably intended 
for use with some environmental data interpreting program as opposed to a 
dumb terminal.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Hitting "o" will get you the past hour's worth of data in 1 minute 
intervals. Note the use of a 24hr clock.  No am/pm stuff.

And hitting "Z" will output the current test recorded.
-------------------------------------------------------------
17:10:00  0018  01  KENMORE SQ  01/18/92
=================================================
CHAN      NO    NO2    NOX   TEMP     CO    SO2
UNITS    PPM    PPM    PPM  DEG K    PPM    PPM
=================================================
17:00  0.044  0.029  0.073    269    1.2  0.013
-------------------------------------------------------------
The "U" command is the coolest.  It gives you updates of what's going on 
as it happens. Notice how the concentration values change.

------------------------------------------------------------
Enuough examples. Here's a command summary:
Remember, commands are case sensitive!
 ---------------------------------------------------------
            t,T   Current time and date.
            1     Yesterday's readings and calibration data in 1 hour 
intervals.
            2     Summary of yesterday.
            3     Data from 2 days ago.
            4     Data from 3 days ago.
            5     Summary from 3 days ago.
            6     Data from 4 days ago.
            7     Summary from 4 days ago.
            8     Data from 5 days ago.
            a     HEX-dump data, current day, 1 hour intervals.
            d     HEX-dump data, 2 days ago, 1 hour intervals.
            g     HEX-dump data, 4 days ago, 1 hour intervals.
            j     HEX-dump data, current hour, 5 min intervals.
            k     HEX-dump data, past hour, 5 min intervals.
            o     HEX-dump data, current hour, 1 min intervals.
            x     HEX-dump data, latest reading.
            Z     Data, latest reading.
            U     Gives IMMEDIATE data...changes every second!
            S     Funky binary output.
            P     Data, past hour, 5 min. intervals.
            L     Funky setup info.
            F     Funky playback info.
            G     Data, current hour, 5 min intervals.
            
Anyway, enjoy this great resource. Please don't try to crash it, or fuck 
with it. This is a great thing to have access to, and if I find anyone 
fucking things up on it, I'm gonna get pissed off.

"Hey, I wonder what the PPM concentration of carbon monoxide is in 
Kenmore tonite? Oooooo, too high for me. Better stay inside."
