                      ToneLoc v0.97 Reference Manual

                                   by

                        Minor Threat & Mucho Maas

     This is the reference manual.  You should read this AFTER reading
TL-USER.DOC unless:

     1. You are already familiar with Toneloc          -or-
     2. You want to get started quickly


 ------------------------
   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
 ------------------------

Here are the command line options for ToneLoc:

Toneloc  [DataFile] /M[Mask] /X[ExMask] /R[Range] /D[ExRange] /C[Config]
         /S[StartTime] /E[EndTime] /H[Hours] /Q /T[-] /K[-]

     ToneLoc must ALWAYS be run with at least one parameter, and if you
only use one parameter it MUST be the dialing mask to use.  If you only
give ToneLoc one parameter, the first 8 characters of the dialing mask
will also be the data file name.  So if you run "TONELOC 555-XXXX", the
mask will be 555-XXXX and the data file will be 555-XXXX.DAT.

     /M - Dial Mask.  Use this parameter if you want to use a data file-
          name other than your dialing mask.

     /X - Exclude dial mask.  This tells ToneLoc to -NOT- dial certain
          numbers.  For example, if your local Police department has
          phone numbers ranging from 555-5000 to 555-5099, and you were
          using the dial mask 555-5XXX, use the exclude mask 50XX. This
          mask applies to the active part of the dial mask (in this case
          5XXX) and therefore should be no more than 4 characters long.
          If an exclusion mask is longer than 4 characters, ToneLoc will
          ignore it. All exclusions must be sub-sets of the dialing mask.

     /C - Config File.  This tells toneloc to use an alternate config
          file.  The default is TONELOC.CFG, but you may change this for
          different types of scans.  You might want to set up different
          config files for different kinds of scanning or for different
          kinds of modems.

     /S - StartTime.  Tells ToneLoc to wait until a certain time to begin.
          You may either use military time or end the time with a "p" for
          P.M.  Example:  5:30p and 17:30 are the same.

     /E - EndTime.  Tells ToneLoc to STOP dialing at a certain time.  Use
          the same notation as the /S parameter above.

     /H - Hours.  Tells ToneLoc to dial for a certain number of hours
          after starting, and then exit.  "/H5:30" would mean 5 hours,
          30 minutes.

     /Q - Quiet.  Tells Toneloc to suppress all sound.  The speaker
          and all sounds will be turned off.

     /T - Sets the scan mode to look for tones, overriding whatever is
          specified in the config file. /T- will look for everything
          >except< tones.

     /K - Sets the scan mode to look for carriers, overriding whatever is
          specified in the config file. /K- will look for everything
          >except< carriers.

     These parameters may appear in any order, EXCEPT the first parameter
MUST always be the datafile, and if you do not specify a dial mask with
/M it MUST ALSO be the mask.

 -----------------
   WHILE DIALING
 -----------------

     While ToneLoc is scanning, there are several keys that do various
things.  Here they are:

     J - Pressing 'J' will Jump to a DOS shell.  Upon returning,
         ToneLoc will redial the last number.

     N - This will "Note" the current number by putting a special entry
         in the logfile.  It looks like this: "* Noted *".  Use this if
         you want to remember this number for later.

     R - This will redial the current number.

     S - This toggles the modem speaker ON or OFF while dialing.
         Toneloc will play a noise to indicate the status of the speaker
         if sound is enabled. Once the current dial is finished the speaker
         will be toggled.

     X - This will extend the current dial time by 5 seconds.  The
         meter will reflect the time addition.

     0-9 - These are the modem volume changing keys.  They will send
         the corresponding string in the config file to the modem.  They
         work like 'S'.

     ! - This will write the file SNAPSHOT.DAT to the current directory.
         Exclude ranges will NOT be cleared from this .DAT file, so it
         can used to debug exclude ranges with Tonemap or Tlog.

     [Escape] - Pressing Escape will abort the current number and
         exit ToneLoc.

 ----------------------
   CONFIGURATION FILE
 ----------------------

     ToneLoc uses a configuration file.  Before running ToneLoc, you
need to edit this config file for your setup.  The config file has
a little bit of help in it, so it should be self-explanatory.  But just
in case, here's an explanation of each keyword in the configuration file.

     Port - This is which COM port to use.  ToneLoc has been tested
            on COM1 - COM4 successfully.  It should, theoretically,
            work up to COM16.  See your FOSSIL documentation for details.

     Baud - This is the baud rate at which ToneLoc communicates with the
            modem.  For a USRobotics HST or Dual Standard, it should be
            38400.  (No commas allowed).  If you have problems with
            dropped characters, lower this to 19200 or 9600.

     Speaker - This tells if the modem speaker should start ON or OFF.
            The word "On" or "Off" should follow "Speaker".  You may
            toggle the speaker while dialing by pressing 'S'.

     FoundSound - ToneLoc can make a noise when it finds something -
            if you want this enabled set it to 1.

     Sound - ToneLoc can makes noises for speaker toggles and volume
            changes. If you want to hear these sounds, set this to 1.

     InitString - This is the string that is sent to the modem when
            ToneLoc is first run.  Usually this is ATZ.  You may need to
            send other parameters like X7, &N1, etc.  Use the characters
            | for [Enter] and ~ (tilde) for a 0.5 second delay.

     InitResponse - ToneLoc checks for this after initializing the modem.
            If the modem doesn't send this back, toneloc will try to
            initialize the modem up to 3 times.  If it doesn't work,
            ToneLoc exits.

     DialString - This is the string to dial the modem.  Usually "ATDT".
            If you need to dial *70 to disable call waiting, for example,
            add it here like "ATDT*70".  Or if you need to dial "9" first,
            put it here.

     SpeakOn - String to send to the modem that turns the speaker ON.
            Usually "ATM1" or "ATM3".

     SpeakOff - Same as above, but to turn the speaker off.  Usually "ATM0"

     Volume0-Volume7 - Strings that adjust the volume of the modem while
            dialing.  Press '0' - '7' while dialing to adjust the modem
            volume.  You could also use these as other macros besides
            volume.

     Hangup - String that tells the modem to hang up.  Usually "ATH0"

     LogFile - File that toneloc logs it's activity to.  Usually TONE.LOG

     CommandDelay - Delay between modem commands.  Usually 200 or so.

     BetweenDelay - Delay between dial attempts.  If you have 3-way
            calling, you'll need to set this to a higher number.

     BetweenWipe - How to 'wipe' the meter between calls.
            1 = Ends to Middle
            2 = Middle to Ends
            3 = Backwards
            4 = No wipe

     WaitDelay - How many milliseconds to allow each dial attempt before
            hanging up and trying the next number. Could be anywhere
            from 16000-45000; you'll have to experiment.

     NoDupes - This tells toneloc to never dial the same number twice
            within a dial mask.  This should usually be on.

     MaxRing - This tells ToneLoc to abort the current dial after a
            certain number of rings.  If set to 0 ToneLoc will not abort
            on rings.

     ScanType - Tells ToneLoc to scan for either Tones or Carriers, or
            everything except Tones or Carriers.
            0 = Tones
            1 = Carriers
            2 = Everything except tones
            3 = Everything except carriers

     IgnoreCD - If your modem always sets Carrier Detect (CD) as TRUE
            turn this on.  Otherwise, turn it off.

     AutoSave - This is the number of minutes ToneLoc should wait
            between automatic backups of the .dat file. If set to 0 it
            will only save on exit.

     FoundFile - This is the name of the file where ToneLoc should store
            the found numbers (tones or carriers.)

     Blacklist - This is a file containing numbers you don't want ToneLoc
            to dial.  You could put in your own numbers, your friend's
            numbers, the police department, etc.

     Random/Forward/Backward - ToneLoc's default mode is to dial numbers
            randomly without duplication, but it can also dial forwards
            and backwards sequentially. Set this to the keyword you want.

     Logging - This sets whether ToneLoc should keep a log file or not.

-----------------
  DESQview INFO
-----------------

     ToneLoc runs most excellently under DESQview.  It will detect
DESQview, and if DESQview is found, screen writes are directed to the
screen buffer so your screen isn't trashed.  ToneLoc also releases
unneeded timeslices to DESQview.  Because of this, ToneLoc uses VERY
LITTLE CPU time, so you can run it in background with minimal slowdown.
I tested ToneLoc with two windows open.  One was a DOS window sitting
at the prompt idle (doing nothing).  The other was ToneLoc scanning.
ToneLoc used about 10% of the CPU time, and the idle DOS window used
about 88% (with about 2% DESQview overhead).
     The file "TL-PIF.DVP" is included with ToneLoc.  To add ToneLoc
to your DESQview setup, do the following:

     1. Run DESQview
     2. Choose "Add a Program"
     3. Type 'O' for other
     4. Enter the path where ToneLoc is found
     5. Move the cursor bar to "ToneLoc" and hit [Space Bar]
     6. Press [Enter].

ToneLoc will be added to the list of applications on your DESQview menu.
To run ToneLoc, choose "TL" from the application menu.  You will be placed
at the DOS prompt with "ToneLoc " already typed.  Just finish the command
line and press enter.

---------------
  FOSSIL INFO
---------------

     ToneLoc also requires a FOSSIL driver.  The two most popular are
called X00 and BNU.  Just call your local PD board and search for
"FOSSIL", "BNU", and "X00".  We like BNU because it is 7K and can be
unloaded from memory.  New versions of X00 may also be unloaded, but
it requires more RAM.  Both may be loaded HIGH if you're using QEMM-386.
