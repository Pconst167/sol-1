
   THE MYTH OF THE 2600HZ DETECTOR
READ: 1 TIMES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 WRITEN BY: SCAR FACE & ZARDOZ
ANOTHER FEDEX FILE...FROM THE *ELITE*

    JUST ABOUT EVERYONE I TALK TO THESE DAYS ABOUT ESS SEEMS TO BE SCARED
WITLESS ABOUT THE 2600HZ DETECTOR.  I DON'T KNOW WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP, BUT
IT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST.  SO MANY OF YOU PEOPLE WHINE ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED
PHREAK CATCHING DEVICE FOR NO REASON.  SOMEONE WITH AT&T SAID THEY HAD IT TO
CATCH PHREA- KERS.  THIS WAS JUST TO SCARE THE BLUE-BOXERS ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM
QUIT BOXING FREE CALLS.
    I'M NOT SAYING ESS IS WITHOUT ITS HANG-UPS, EITHER.  ONE THING THAT ESS CAN
DETECT READILY IS THE KICK-BACK THAT THE TRUNK CIRCUITRY SENDS BACK TO THE ESS
MACHINE WHEN YOUR LITTLE 2600HZ TONE RESETS THE TOLL TRUNK. AFTER AN ESS
DETECTS A KICK-BACK IT TURNS AN M-F DETECTOR ON AND RECORDES ANY M-F TONES
X-MITTED.
---------------------------------------
   DEFEATING THE KICK-BACK DETECTOR
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     AS MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS NOTE, KICK-BACK DETECTION CAN BE A SERIOUS
NUISANCE TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN GAINING CONTROL OF A TRUNK LINE.
     THE EASIEST WAY TO BY-PASS THIS DETECTION CIRCUITRY IS NOT REALLY
BY-PASSING IT AT ALL, IT IS JUST LETTING THE KICK-BACK GET DETECTED ON SOME
OTHER LINE. THIS OTHER LINE IS YOUR LOCAL MCI, SPRINT, OR OTHER LONG DISTANCE
CARRIER (EXCEPT AT&T).  THE ONLY CATCH IS THAT THE SERVICE YOU USE MUST NOT
DISCONNECT THE LINE WHEN YOU HIT THE 2600HZ TONE.
     THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT:  CALL UP YOUR LOCAL EXTENDER, PUT IN THE CODE, AND
DIAL A NUMBER IN THE 601 AREA CODE AND THE 644 EXCHANGE. LOTS OF OTHER
EXCHANGES WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I'M SURE, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I
HAVE FOUND SO FAR.  ANYWAY, WHEN IT STARTS RINGING, SIMPLY HIT 2600HZ AND
YOU'LL HEAR THE KICK-BACK, (KA-CHIRP, OR WHATEVER). THEN YOU ARE READY TO DIAL
WHOEVER YOU WANT (CONFERENCES, INWARD, ROUTE AND RATE, OVERSEAS, ETC.) FROM THE
TRUNK LINE IN OPERATOR TONES! SINCE BLOWING 2600HZ DOESN'T MAKE YOU YOU A
PHREAKER UNTIL THE TOLL EQUIPMENT RESETS THE LINE, KICKBACK DETECTION IS THE
METHOD AT&T CHOOSES (FOR NOW).
     THIS INFORMATION COMES AS A RESULT OF MY EXPERIMENTS & EXPERIENCE AND HAS
BEEN VERIFIED BY LOCAL AT&T EMPLOYEES I HAVE AS ACQUAINTANCES. THEY COULD ONLY
SAY THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR MY AREA, BUT WERE PRETTY SURE THAT THE SAME IDEA IS
IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

=======================================

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO ACCESS A TRUNK LINE OR AS OPERATORS SAY A LOOP, I WILL
TELL YOU THE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH IT.

HERE IS A LIST OF AT&T SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO YOU BY USING A BLUE BOX.

        A/C+101    TOLL SWITCHING
        A/C+121    INWARD OPERATOR
        A/C+131    INFORMATION
        A/C+141    ROUTE & RATE OP.
        A/C+11501  MOBILE OPERATOR
        A/C+11521  MOBILE OPERATOR



STARTING CONFERANCES:
---------------------

THIS IS ONE THE MOST USEFUL ATTRIBUTES OF BLUE BOXING. NOW THE CONFS. ARE UP 24
HOURS/DAY AND 7 DAYS/WEEK AND THE BILLING LINES ARE BEING BILLED. SINCE I
BELEIVE THE ABOVE IS TRUE (ABOUT THE BILLING LINES BEING BILLED) I WOULD
RECOMMEND THAT YOU NEVER LET YOUR # SHOW UP ON THE CONF. IF YOU STARTED IT, PUT
IT ON A LOOP AND THEN CALL THE LOOP. ENOUGH BULLSHIT!!!!! TO START THE CONF.
DIAL ONE OF THESE THREE NUMBERS IN M-F WHILE YOU ARE ON THE TRUNK.

213+080+XXXX
XXXX=1050,3050
SPECIAL XXXX=1000,1100,1200,1500,2200,
2500.
     THESE #S ARE IN L.A. AND ARE THE MOST WATCHED, I DO NOT ADVISE USING THIS
NPA.

312+001+1050 OR 3050

914+042+1050 OR 1100,1200 ECT..


***************************************
UPDATE, I BELEIVE ONLY 914 WORKS AT THE MOMENT
***************************************

ONCE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THESE YOU WILL EITHER HEAR A RE-ORDER, BUSY, OR
CHERP. WHEN YOU HEAR THE CHERP ENTER THE BILLING LINE IN M-F. I USE THE CONF.
DIAL- UP.
  A BILLING LINE EXAMPLE: KP312+001+1050ST
YOU WILL THEN HEAR TWO TUTES AND A RE- CORDING ASKING YOU FOR THE # OF CONFER-
REES INCLUDING YOURSELF.  ENTER A # BETWEEN 20 AND 30. IF YOU EVER GET OVER 30
PEOPLE ON A CONFERANCE ALL YOU WILL HEAR IS JUMBLED VOICES.  AFTER THE IT SAYS
"YOUR CONFERANCE SIZE IS XX" THEN HIT # SIGN.  ADD YOUR FAVORITE LOOP ON AND
HIT 6 TO TRANSFER CONTROL TO IT. AFTER IT SAYS CONTROL WILL BE TRANSFERED
HANG UP AND CALL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOOP, HIT #SIGN AND FOLLOW THE IN-
STRUCTIONS. A BONUS FOR CONF. IS TO ADD AN INTERNATIONAL # DIAL 1+011+CC+NUMBER
PRETTY COOL EHHH.

A FEW EXTRA NOTES.
    DO NOT ADD #S THAT YOU WILL WANT TO HANG UP, ADD THESE THROUGH MCI OR
    SPRINT.

    YOU CANNOT BLOW ANYONE OFF W/2600HZ UNLESS THEY ARE IN AN OLD X-BAR OR
    OLDER SYSTEM.

    MANY D.A. OPERATORS WILL STAY ON AFTER YOU ABUSE THEM; YOU MAY HAVE TO
    START ANOTHER OR AT LEAST DON'T SAY ANY NUMBERS.

    NEVER ADD THE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP ONTO A CONF.

    NEVER ADD MORE THAN ONE MCI NODE ON YOUR CONF.


ROUTE & RATE:
-------------


NOTE ROUTE & RATE AND RQS PERFORM THE SAME SERVICE.

     R&R SIMPLY TELLS YOU ROUTE AND RATE INFO WHICH IS VERY VALUBLE, EX. SUCH
AS THE INWARD ROUTING FOR AN EXCHANGE IN AN AREA CODE.  AN INWARD ROUTING WILL
LET YOU CALL HER AND SHE CAN DO AN EMERGENCY INTERUPT FOR YOU. SHE CAN TELL YOU
HOW TO GET INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS, ECT.

 HERE ARE THE TERMS YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE:

     INTERNATIONAL,
        -OPERATOR ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU INWARD OP.
        -DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU DIRECTORY ASS.
        -CITY ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU COUNTRY AND CITY CODE.

     OPERATOR ROUTE FOR [A/C]+ [EXCHANGE] *GIVES YOU INWARD OP. ROUTE
      EX. [A/C]+ OR [A/C]+0XX+ WHEN SHE SAYS PLUS SHE MEANS PLUS 121.
     NUMBERS ROUTE FOR [STATE, CITY] *GIVES YOU A/C.

     PLACE NAME [A/C]+[EXCHANGE] *GIVES YOU CITY/STATE FOR THAT A/C AND
     EXCHANGE.


INTERNATIONAL CALLS:
