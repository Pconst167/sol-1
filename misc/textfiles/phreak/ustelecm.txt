A NAPPA Profile on USTelecom, written by Blind Justice.

Mci recently Purchased Us Telecom and its subsidary, Southern Net[1087]
                                
                             U.S. Telecom

  U.S. Telecom was known as the "Metro" of the 950's. Codes were easily hacked
and density varyed in direct proportion to the population of the area serviced.

U.S. Tel's 950-1033 dialup is already famous among phreaks. They've placed
qualifiers on the codes, even so the return rate runs around five per hundred
hacks. Five percent - not bad. The node uses the standard seven digit format.
Its a real dandy. They never die, unless they are REALLY abused. But the rate
of return is droping as people become wise to us phreaks. When you get more
then one code on them, use one and let the other sit, it WILL be good when
you come back, and now you get a good rest from hacking.

On their 800 numbers things seem to be set up quite uniquely:
The format is constructed of two sets of three digits followed by two sets
of four digits, XXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXX. We can assume the first sets of three are
area qualifiers, actually area codes. USTel doesn't use the actual area code
as do AT&T and MCI. Area codes 818 and 714 return as 527 and 662 respectively.
Additionally, the three digit prefix and suffix are also bastardized. Hackers
have deduced  this is the product of a mathematical formula indexed from the
users area code and phone number. The four digit "security code" is obtained
by the same formula.

The Dr's Note:
1033 happens to be my favorite of 950 extenders.  I've been using it for
about a year and a half.  Each code I get lasts for months.  I'd use it for a
week, move onto another one, and so on until the ring is complete.  I've never
heard of anyone getting busted by Us Telcom, but I have noticed the rate of
codes per attempts dropping.  Used to be pretty easy, almost as easy as 1087,
till now, its about 1 code for every 500 attempts.  Real low, unless you're
lucky.
