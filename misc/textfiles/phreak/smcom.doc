PURPOSE

This is a tiny communications program.  Have you have ever found
yourself at a computer site (like doing some consulting or repair
work) and wished you could use the modem to call someone, or to test
out a COM port?  I have, and I don't usually carry around Qmodem and
it's 700K of program and support files.

Along comes SMCOM.  It won't impress you with features or functions.
It open a COM port and allows you to talk to the port, clear the
screen (ALT-C) and exit the program back to DOS (ALT-X).  And it is
only about 10K.

It's not the greatest program in the world, but I hope it works for
you as it has for me.



DISCLAIMER

This program is released into the PUBLIC DOMAIN.  It is free!  I am
not trying to make a fast buck on this program.  I think that Sysops
spend enough money on their systems and don't need one more person
with their hand out.  These kinds of utilities can "nickle and dime"
a Sysop to death!

I MAKE NO CLAIM THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK AT ALL.  IF IT DOES
WORK, I DO NOT CLAIM THAT IT WILL NOT DAMAGE YOUR VALUED HARDWARE OR
SOFTWARE IN THE PROCESS.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
