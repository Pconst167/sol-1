| How the Magic is Done |
`-----------------------'
   I am warning you! if you are chicken shit and hate to speak to
   operators then you wont like this method!! 

   The first step is calling 1-800-265-5328 (800-COLLECT). You will
   probably want to divert if you are calling from home.

   Once you are connected to the 800 # it will say .. "Thank You
   for calling 1-800-COLLECT.. Please Enter the number you wish
   to call .. area code first" . You will hit "0". You will then
   be transfered to a MCI operator. She will come on and say "May I
   have the Area code and Number you are calling". This is when you 
   tell the Operator how PBXPhreak defrauds MCI everyday of his life 
   and tell the MCI fraud squad his info!! (just kidding). When she
   asks for the # you wish to call, tell her a # you want to call.
   You can tell her any number except some #'s it doesnt notice in
   its database. Like Defcon voice bridge (801-855-3326) and the rest
   of those silly 801 partylines (801-234-4444) (801-234-7448) . She
   will then ask you for your name. You will tell the operator "I would
   like to charge this call on my mastercard. (Use this dead card) 
   She will ask for the card number. (5371-5990-0600-2787) . Now she
   will ask for expiry date (01/98) . She will now ask for Zip code .. 
   Here is the trick. You must say its an overseas card. (she will enter
   00000 into the computer) .. (MCI only checks algorithm for overseas cards)
   if you told her a zipcode for the USA , the computer would check the 
   zipcode against the card and it would not be valid. The call should go
   through. She will say. "Thankyou for using 1-800-COLLECT".

   If you are using a payphone you can use the MCI Carrier Access K0DE
   and it will be AUTOMATED!!.. DIAL like so. 

     10222+0+718-123-4567 (Enter your Number you wish to kall!!)

     After you enter that you will hear a voice "MCI". Then the automated
     operator will say "For a Collect call press 11". When you hear that
     enter the Credit Card #. Then it will ask for expiry. Then is will ask
     for Mailing Zipcode. You will enter "00000" (5 if you cant count). then
     it will say "Thankyou for using MCI".

			 "Thankyou for ABUSiNG MCi" - PBXPhreak
