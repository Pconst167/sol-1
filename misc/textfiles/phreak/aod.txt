        You are all probably wonering  who this goddamn AOD is right?  
Let me tell You.  The AOD is one of the most elyte Hack/Phreak orginizations 
in the USA!!  

YOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCKYOUSUCK

What does it take to be elyte?  This question was asked to one of AOD's prime 
  movers and shakers, Akira.

        AK: Elyte is a state of mind ya'all.  It is not for everyone.
            Definitly not for buisness pigs or piece of shit cops.
            To be elyte you must belive in yourselve and have an elder god
            adopt your cause.  Oh ya, one more thing.  You gotta wear socks.

So Akira, what is you views on life, the universe, and everything?

        AK: It is all gone bad.  I beileve in total restucturing of the 
            government.  It should be built up so it can worship me.
            All taxes to me.  All cute girls to me.  All to me and
            nothin to you.  Life sucks.  The universe sucks.  Everything 
            sucks.  Everything but me that is.  AnArcHY RuLEz!@!1!

What do you feel has been the most benificial invention this century?

        AK: The A-bomb.  It is truly Amerikan.  Even if we stole all the
            ideas.  It was built in Amerika and tested in Japan!!  It, 
            beyond everything else, has furthered my cause. 

What vices do you have?
        
        AK: My biggest vice is my uncontrolablr urge to sacrifice small 
            animals and children tho BoB.  He is my cyber-god.  I also
            am mundanely addicted to oxygen and gyrliez.  Other than that, I would
            say that I am a normal all Amerikan kid.

Where are your roots in the computer underground?

        AK: They are under my trees.  HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA. Sorry.
            Seriously,  They started in the winter of '92.  I  
            started to read bout hackers and such and I started 
            to play around with the personal computers at my 
            school.  I also learned about the old 286 in my basement.
            I got my first modem, a cheepie 1200 baud that was at 
            least 10 years old, in the spring of 93.  I charged up 
            almost $300 calling boards in california.  I was a 
            stupid kid.  What can I say?  I learned about some 
            neet WWIV boards in a nearby city and I and some of 
            the AOD crashed every WWIV board in town.  Now, I am into  
            Writing Virii and Unix.

In reverence to the eternal Phrack Pro-philes, Are most of the 
phreaks and hackers you know geeks?

        AK: Only Necrovore.  And it doesn't matter if he is because 
            he is elyte AND AOD And maybye alot of the lamer sysops 
            that want to be elyte.  THey try too hard.  Not that it 
            does them any good.  They shall all be the first to hit 
            the fan When the Revolution Hits.  AOD FOREVER!!!!!
