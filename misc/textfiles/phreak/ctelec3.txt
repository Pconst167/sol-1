            *******************************************************
            The Real Truth About Scanning Cell Phones With a TV Set
                                 By Deprogram
            *******************************************************

We've all heard the rigamarole about cellular capable radio scanners. We all
know about the ridiculous steps the cellular industry has taken to try to
prevent their use. But really, there's no need to go to that much trouble. You
can do cellular monitoring pretty well with an ordinary and entirely legal TV
set! Of course, it's still a federal offense to monitor cellular, so this
information is only for your entertainment and is not to be used in any
illegal way, duh.

What you need first of all is anything that has a UHF TV tuner built into it.
This includes VCRs as well as TV sets. See, TV channels 14 to 83 are the UHF
TV band. Think about this: all of these channels could have been used by over
the air TV stations!  Actually, the top 12 or so channels in the UHF TV band
aren't available for tv anymore as far as I know. The frequencies have been
reassigned to Land Mobile use, or cellular telephones.

On old TV sets there is a second knob for UHF. You put yer VHF knob on "U" and
tweak your UHF knob up to the very end of the band. If you have a VCR or some
other sort of tuner, just make sure that you're on "TV" and not "CATV",
because the channel allocations are different. Once you get up to channel 14,
broadcast (UHF) channels and cable channels are NOT the same. If you can see
that you are tuning above channel 83, then you are on cable and you're not
going to pick up anything.

Look around on channels 80 through 83. When you don't hear people talking, you
will hear an obnoxious buzzing sound. I think this is the tower holding the
channel, but I'm not sure. In any case, conversations will come and go as they
are handed off to another tower. If you use common sense about when and where
more people are using their cellular phones, you should be able to determine
the best times for listening.

If you really, really have no luck pulling anything in, your tuner may be a
newer one which simply won't do it. Many new TV tuners have been manufactured
so as to not pick up this cellular "interference". Rumor has it that a
restoration is possible.

Anyway, if your TV is a new one, use an old junky one instead. In fact, the
best TVs for monitoring purposes are old, cheap, black-and-white models which
aren't good for much else.  The picture tube could be entirely broken and the
set could still be useful! (In fact, you might want to turn the brightness
down on the screen while monitoring.) In order to fish around for phone calls,
it's really best if you can fine tune. Even better, many old TV sets have a
UHF knob that does not click at all.

The next thing you need is an ANTENNA. (Novel idea, huh? An antenna to pick up
radio signals? But seriously, some of this may be obvious to a hacker, but I
am trying to cover all the bases here.)

Take a look at the back of your TV set, and you'll probably find two posts
marked UHF (to go along with the doohickey that says VHF). You'll want to plug
your cell-capable antenna into UHF. The easiest thing to do at this point is
go get a UHF tv loop. They cost about a dollar, many supermarkets have them,
and they will work quite well. The BEST thing to do is ...get a 800mHz
cellular antenna!  These are also getting pretty darn cheap, and they are
tuned to just the frequencies you are interested in. I think it's okay to just
run a wire from the 800 MHz antenna to one of the UHF posts. I'm sure there
are many other 819 to 890 MHz antenna setups you can think of if you are
creative.

You can even use a second TV set (or other tuner) to create an "RF well" and
hear even more. Put the second TV set right next to the first.  With the first
TV, tune something in. Then with the second TV, fish around channels 72-76.
Apparently you are tuning in the base frequency to go with the mobile, or
something like that. I think you will find that many of the signals you have
already been picking up will become more coherent. Single coverstions will
emerge from what was previously a mess. Anyhow, just experiment and you'll get
the idea.

I can certainly envision a cellular monitoring device consisting of a couple
of stripped down TV tuners built into a box. In fact I wonder if someone
hasn't done this. Of course, this would just be a way to make it all look
pretty and it isn't necessary at all. Well, cellular providers these days are
going digital and taking other steps to provide something resembling security.
So the time may come when all of this info is obsolete, if you believe some
people. But I myself think there will always be cell companies who are too
cheap or lazy to protect their signal.

                     Programming the Motorola Radius SP10
                                 by R.F. Burns

The SP10 is a 1 watt handheld radio transceiver designed to operate on one of
16 different frequencies assigned to low power/itinerant communications in the
VHF-hi business band (150.775-174 Mhz.). While this is one of Motorola's "low
end" radios, the quality is still up to Motorola's excellent standards. The
SP10 is commonly available; even being sold by Radio Shack, and a preliminary
inspection indicates that the unit should offer many opportunities to the RF
hacker. A full review of the SP10 appears in the February 1996 issue of
Popular Communications magazine.

To program the radio, remove the battery compartment cover, battery, and
plastic cover underneath the battery. On the bottom right hand side of the
radio you will see four dip switches. The position of the dip switches is what
determines the operating frequency. Use the table below to determine what dip
switch settings pertain to what frequency; where 0=ON and 1=OFF.

Frequency   Switches                   Frequency   Switches
---------   --------                   ---------   --------
151.625     0011                       151.655     1000
151.685     0101                       151.715     1010
151.775     1001                       151.805     0110
151.835     0010                       151.895     1101
151.925     0001                       151.955     1100
154.490     1011                       154.515     0111
154.540     1110                       154.570     1111
154.600     0000                       158.400     0100

If someone wanted an "on the fly" programmable radio, they could bring a four
bit dip switch up to the case of the radio, and be able to switch between the
16 different frequencies without having to dismantle the radio every time they
wanted to change frequencies. There's plenty of space inside the radio for an
aspiring RF hacker to do a little experimentation, and Motorola's gear has a
reputation of being very workable, hacker-wise.

                          Hackers Versus Politicians
                              by J. Orlin Grabbe

The December 1995 Media Bypass magazine article, "The Still Before the Storm,"
by James Norman, details how a group of "Fifth Column" hackers have initiated
a campaign to clean up political corruption, resulting so far in the announced
retirement of over thirty politicians (who have received packages of
information detailing their financial shenanigans). Norman calls this group
"CIA computer hackers", though in fact the group is * totally outside
government.* (One member is ex-NSA, an agency that member now despises, and
another member is ex-CIA.)  But, anyway, as Norman notes:

". . .  the Fifth Column has managed to penetrate Swiss and other foreign
banks to quietly withdraw what is now an astounding $2.5 billion in illicit
money from coded accounts they have identified as belonging to government
figures.

"Starting in 1991, this five-man Fifth Column team has been using its own Cray
supercomputer to break into foreign bank computers, download vast libraries of
data and trace this money to a wide range of illegal activities, from
kickbacks on drug and arms deals to insider trading profits, software piracy
and the sale of state secrets. Oh yes, don't forget tax evasion."

What I like about the Fifth Column campaign is that it simply asks politicians
to live by their own rules.  If they want to launder money themselves, then
they should get rid of the money-laundering statutes and let the rest of us
have the same privileges.  If they don't want to pay taxes, then let them
get rid of the tax laws.  If they want to continue the insane "war on drugs,"
then they shouldn't be taking payoffs from drug lords.  (It is amazing how
non-authoritarian people become if forced to practice what they preach.)

This article is an introduction to the political possibilities of hacking.  It
will present a brief how-to for the enterprising hacker to (legally) prepare
his or her own background report on any given politician (sorry, Senator Exon
has already received an envelope).  Let's face it: journalists are too
technically incompetent to do the job.

Politicians are those annoying people who--drink in hand--can stare at a
uuencoded file for hours, fall into a sexual reverie involving ASCII entities,
and then weave their way to the nearest TV camera to pontificate about
pornography on the Internet.

But, you ask, if they are so dumb, why are they so rich?  Sometimes the latter
*is* a mystery, reminiscent of the miracle of the loaves and the fishes.

Take the case of a man who can hardly pay his bills, but who gets elected to
national political office and goes off to Washington for a few years.  Then--
lo and behold!--on his simple politician's salary, he suddenly manages to
maintain two fine homes, one inside the beltway in Chevy Chase and another
in his home town community of Rat's Ass, to purchase new cars for his wife and
himself, to accumulate lakefront property in a neighboring county, and to
stash away a nice sum of cash in a foreign bank account.

If the "simple politician's salary" bit sounds improbable, it probably is.
Let's face it:  many politicians are on the take.  They may have hidden
sources of income involving illegal payoffs from corporations, lobbying
groups, or  individuals. Are you a student?  Then you will be proud to know
that educational commissions and associations are also a hot new conduit for
political bribes.

This article suggests a few basic procedures for finding out whether that
special politician you have in mind is getting more on the side than ASCII
sex.  Honest politicians, of course, will have nothing to fear from any of the
following.

Is what I am about to do legal?  you ask.  Of course it is.  To reassure
yourself, pull out your world-wide web browser and take a peak at one of the
many data service companies, say Insights, Inc. (located at
<http://isis.iah.com/insights/ background/>).  They promise, using only an
individual or business name and/or address,  to provide sufficient information
for:

*Preparing Due Diligence Reports
*Locating People or Businesses
*Exposing and Controlling Fraud
*Uncovering & Verifying Background Information
*Identifying and Verifying Assets

How do they get away with this?  Simple. They legally search public records.
Much of this public-record information is computerized, although some of it is
not.  In any event, I do not advocate illegal or questionable access methods,
or the breaking of any laws.  Checking up on the (possibly criminal)
politician of your choice doesn't have to be a crime.

Still not convinced?  Hop over to Infonet
<http://www.infi.net/~dgs.assc/locator/bgrndnfo.html>,
which for a fee will mine public records for nuggets like:

*Felony and Misdemeanor Criminal Filings--"Search any court in the nation for
a seven year history of criminal filings and possible convictions."  (Many
politicians wait until they reach office to work on this part of their resume,
but some are early starters.)

*Driving Histories--"Search a three to seven year history of an individuals
driving performance, including tickets and accidents."  (So you don't really
care if your politician speeds a little now and then.  But, on the other hand,
did that official who helped him get out of a DWI expect a quid pro quo?)

*Upper and Lower Court Civil Filings--"Obtain a civil litigation history of
any individual in any court in the United States."  (Is there some hidden
reason this guy is getting sued all the time?)

*Social Security Number Tracking--"Access all three credit bureaus to verify
the user of a social security number and the addresses being used."  (Having
your politician's social security number is the next best thing to having his
Swiss bank account number.)

*Professional Licensing--"Verify the existence and status of an entity's
license in a specific practice area, such as private investigation, medicine,
real estate and more."  (Was your politician really a world-renowned physicist
before returning home to run for mayor of Rat's Ass?)

*Consumer and Business Credit Reports--"Review account balances, credit terms
and payment histories for an individual or business." ("So, before he went to
Washington, he couldn't pay his bills . . .")

Well, if they can do it, so can you.

So where do you start?  Well, first see what the politician him/herself has to
say about the money flows. Federal law (5 USC app. 6, section 101 et seq.)
requires members of Congress to file *Financial Disclosure Statements* yearly.
The Financial Disclosure form has nine parts:

        Schedule I:    Earned Income
        Schedule II:   Payments in Lieu of Honoraria Made to
                        Charity
        Schedule III:  Assets and "Unearned Income"
        Schedule IV:  Transactions.
        Schedule V:   Liabilities
        Schedule VI:  Gifts
        Schedule VII: Fact-Finding, Substantial Participation,
                        and Other Travel
        Schedule VIII: Positions
        Schedule IX:  Agreements

web browser to <http://www.cais.com/ newtwatch/93sei.html>.

Many state, county, and city elections have similar requirements, either on a
personal or a campaign basis.  Want to see a copy of the *Candidate Campaign
Statement-Long Form-Form 490* for Joel Ventresca, candidate for Mayor of
San Francisco?  Visit Campaign Net at <http://tmx.com/sfvote>.

These statements represent what a politician says he or she has or gets.  But
the really interesting items--like those kickbacks from the Cali cartel--not
surprisingly go unreported. To get the good stuff, you will need your full
hacker armor.

The first thing to get is your politician's *social security number (SSN)*.
It's not difficult.  Your politician loves to be photographed doing his/her
civic duty of voting.  Which means he or she fills out a  *voter's
registration card* (public information) which will contain said politician's
name, address, date of birth, party affiliation, and--usually--social security
number. Voter files may be obtained at your politician's local county court
house, as well as on many on-line data bases.  A person's SSN is the common
key that links together many commercial and government data bases.

Can't find the SSN number on the voter's registration card? Then try *DMV*
records.  The insurance lobby has made sure that driver's records are easy to
get, along with the details of any accidents, and critical driver information
such as  height, color of eyes, address--and social security number, if the
latter was required information on the form. (California won't give out
addresses, if a request has been filed not to do so--the "movie star"
exemption.)  In about 20 states the individual's social security number is the
driver's license number.

Still searching?  Then go with the triple whammy of the major credit bureaus--
TRW, TransUnion, and CBI/Equifax.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act essentially
implies you must be contemplating a business relationship--such as selling a
car, renting an apartment, giving a loan, or attempting to collect on a
judgment--with a party to request his credit report.  But the *header*
information in the file--such as social security number, date of birth,
address, and spouse's name--is legally available to anyone, and your inquiry
(unlike an actual credit report) will leave no footprints.  The addresses and
phone numbers are:

TRW
660 N. Central Expressway, Exit 28
Allen, TX 75002
Automated phone: 800-392-1122
Phone: 800-422-4879

Are you a hacker-journalist?  Then take a peak at the National Institute for
Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR; located at <http://www.nicar.org/>).
Their bylaws prohibit them from selling data to nonjournalists (not that you
want to *buy* data anyway--we're just exploring *possibilities*).  But
data is "sold at or below costs to journalism organizations or individuals for
legitimate journalism uses only."  (Doing your civic duty to keep tabs on your
politician is, naturally, a legitimate journalistic use of the data.)  Their
data bases include these publicly-available information sets, among others:

Organization:  Government Services Agency
Databases:  Federal Procurement Contracts for 1992-1994.

Organization:  Federal Election Commission
Databases:  Campaign Contributions for the 1991-1994
        election cycle.

Organization: Federal Reserve Board
Databases:  home mortgage loans covered by Home Mortgage
        Disclosure Act (for 1992-1994)

Organization:  Federal Aviation Administration
Databases:   Service Difficulty Reports, Airman Directory,
        Aircraft Registry

Organization: Federal Bureau of Investigation
Databases:  Uniform Crime Reports

Organization:  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Databases:  Gun Dealer Licenses

The existence of such data immediately brings to mind a barrage of possibly
relevant questions:

Is there an incestuous relationship between the donors to your politician's
campaign and subsequent federal government contracts? (It always starts
somewhere . . .) To find out, compare federal procurement data with campaign
contributions.  Campaign contribution data from the Federal Election
Commission are supposed to include all contributions by individuals and
political action groups (PACs) to a politician's federal election campaign.
The Government Services Agency, meanwhile, keeps Individual Contract Action
Reports (ICARs), which has information about the federal agency granting a
government contract, the identity of the contractor, and the contract dollar
amount.

Has your politician recently purchased a new home? What is its value? What was
the down payment? Is he or she living suspiciously beyond his or her means?
What is your politician's race or gender (DNA sequence?)?  To start to answer
these questions, look at home mortgage data.  The Federal Reserve Board
started keeping data like this in order to check on "fair" lending practices.
So the Fed began tracking home and home-improvement loans, as well as bank-
purchased loans.  (And just to help the enterprising hacker, when your
politician is buying, or possibly refinancing,  a house, most banks will now
ask for his Social Security Number on the Deed of Trust, especially as the
Federal National Mortgage Association now requires it.)

Does your politician own an aircraft?  What's its value? Did he purchase it
with cash?   Check the FAA's aircraft records.

Does your politician own a gun even while advocating gun control?  If he
bought the gun from a dealer,  ATF records can help out here.

And so on.

Now let's get to the nitty-gritty: *city, county, and state records*.  The
*City Clerk* in your politician's home town will have a list of business
licenses (name, address, date) and building permits (name, address, cost of
construction).  The *County Clerk* or *County Recorder* should have liens on
file (lien holder, payment agreements), a Probate Index (estate settlements),
records of lawsuits and judgments, powers of attorney with respect to real
estate, records of mortgages on personal property, and bankruptcy papers. Here
you can find out not only the value of your politician's property, but also
the names, addresses, and property values of everyone who lives on his street.
*City and County Courts* will also maintain a Civil Index (civil actions,
plaintiffs and defendants, as well as civil files: description of any disputed
property or valuables), a Criminal Index (criminal cases in Superior Court,
as well as criminal files), and voter's registration files.

The *county tax collector* will have a description of any property owned, as
well as taxes paid on real estate and personal property.  The *county
assessor* may also have maps and photos, or even blueprints showing the
location of your politician's hot tub. The *Secretary of State* will have
corporation files and possibly annual reports of your politician's company.

Okay, let's go over it again, taking it slow.  With your politician's social
security number in hand, you can get header information from the major credit
bureaus.  This will give you a seven to ten year history of  addresses, as
well any spousal name or names.  The latter is very important, since your
average politician's instinct will be to keep questionable sums of money
and suspect personal assets in the name of his or her spouse, sibling,
business associate, or girlfriend.

Next you go to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, to find out your
politician's tastes in cars, trucks, motorcyles, boats, trailers, and
recreational vehicles.  Of course if your politician leases any of the above,
he or she will not show up as the vehicle owner.  So the next thing to do is
to run the license plate number of that Caddy parked out front, since this
will give you the name of both lessee and lessor.

Next you talk to someone who does business with your politician, and who thus
has a permissible reason under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to run a credit
check.  This will give you a listing of all your politician's credit accounts,
current balances, payment history, and payment terms.  Any bankruptcies in the
last ten years, or liens or judgments in the last seven years, will be listed.
Did your politician suddenly receive a huge campaign contribution from some
source, soon after your politician found himself stuck with a quarter million
dollar judgment against him?  If so, he won't be the first person who has sold
out his country to pay off a personal financial debt.

What property does your politician own?  The offices of County Recorder and
County Tax Assessor will give you the land value, improvement value, and total
assesssed values for any property.  They will frequently have also the amounts
received for any sales, the sale dates, as well as information on the
mortgage-holder or other lender.  Did your politician get a large loan from
Washoe International State Bank just about the time Washoe International State
Bank was having trouble with state banking regulators, who are overseen by a
legislative committee on which your politician sits?

Does your politician own a business of any consequential size?  Then run a
business credit check.  Who are (were) your politician's business associates?
Who are the company officers and principals?  Or--if as is commonly the
case--your plitician is a lawyer, who are the law partners?  Look also for
bankruptcies, tax liens, public records filings, judgments, and UCC (Uniform
Commercial Code) financing statements.  These documents may turn out to be
filled with all sorts of unexpected names, dates, and activities.

On what honorary commissions does your politician serve?  Do the commission's
audited financial statements show any payments for services not rendered?
This was apparently what  New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco was
wondering, when he noted, on January 9, 1996, in a letter to the National
Center on Education and the Economy:  "Statement 11 on your 1990 Federal 990
and Note 5 on your 1990 audited financial statements indicate that the Center
had retained the services of Hillary Rodham Clinton, a member of the Rose Law
firm, to direct your Workforce Skills Program while she also served as a
member of the Center's Board of Trustees. Statement 11 of the 1990 filing
indicates that Mrs. Clinton received $23,000 for unspecified services.  The
1990 filing also refers to a second contract, which was reported to be in the
amount of $150,000 covering the period February 1, 1991 through January 31,
1992, and a similar statement appears on Statement 11 attached to the 1991
Federal 990."

Moreover, did either Hillary Clinton or the Rose Law firm pay taxes on the
sums received?  (A little birdie tells me neither one did.)

The office of the Secretary of State in any of the 50 states can be a source
of UCC searches.  UCC Indices will show whether  your politician is listed as
either a debtor or secured party.  (Okay.  So your politician is up to his
neck in debt to Jackson Stephens.  That doesn't mean he listens to a word of
political advice Stephens gives him.  No way.)

Superior Courts, Federal Bankruptcy Courts,  Small Claims Courts, and city,
county, and state tax authorities keep records of tax liens, court judgments,
and bankruptcy filings. These reveal not only outstanding financial
obligations, but also personal and company affiliations, partners,
subsidiaries, and dependents.  (Is there a Don Lasater or Don Tyson in your
politician's background?)

Does your politician really have those degrees he claims?  Call the college
registrar.  Despite what you think, many politicians don't believe in their
own "self-made man" rhetoric, and will enhance their resumes with unearned
degrees. This in itself may only be a venal sin, but someone who records
falsehoods in this area will likely also lie in others.

Has your politician been in the news?  Check your library's newspaper file,
along with reader's guides, and other news indexes.  On the Internet, you can
quickly search for your politician's name among the 8 billion words on 16
million WWW pages, using the new Alta Vista search utility created by
Digital Equipment Corporation.  You can also do a name or keyword search
through all 13,000 Usenet groups.  Alta Vista is located at
<http://altavista.digital.com/>.

Be sure to read Lee Lapin's book The Whole Spy Catalog (Intelligence
Incorporated, 2228 S. El Camino Real, San Mateo, CA 94403; ISBN 1-880231-10-7)
for literally dozens of names, addresses, and phone numbers of data
information providers, along with an evaluation of their services.  You don't
need to patronize these services in order to steal ideas from them.

Basically none of these providers specializes in politicians, so after a
little self-education and set-up, you may be in a position to start your own
business in political investigations.  Bill yourself as a 21st Century
Sherlock Holmes.  (*Somebody* has to stop the nefarious influence of
DigiCrime, Inc., found at <http://www.digicrime.com/>.)

Oh. About those foreign bank accounts. Well, I'll leave that to your
imagination. But a little birdie told me if you call a military base computer,
find an out-dial number, call another military base, and so on, going through
a *minimum* of three military bases, any trace back will stop at the third
military base.

Whatever you do, don't do anything illegal.

                                     INTRO

Ok, here's the scenario: You're at someone's house. That someone pick's up the
phone, dials, and...

   "Hey Billy, how's the Missus?....Great glad to hear it. And How's
   Chelsea?...Oh really, thats fabulous. And how's Roger doin'?...Great, glad
   to hear it. I was just calling to see how you all were doin. Is Al or
   Tipper around?"

The phone call's over and you're sayin to yourself "man, I wish I had that
number." Well you could ask your friend point blank for it, but we both know
that as two-faced and shallow as your so-called friendship with this guy is,
theirs NO WAY he'd give you the number to information let alone to the White
House. But that's alright, cuz you're pretty good at...

                               CAPTURING REDIAL

The principle behind Redial Capturing is simple. You basically capture the
last number that was dialed from a TouchTone(c) phone and keep it for later
use. So now the question is, how do you do the capture. Well there's a number
of way you can do it, but after some consideration, I think I've come up with
a method thats both fairly inexpensive, VERY effective, and quite practical.
Heres what you need:

   * Radio Shack Pocket Dialer w/Memory
     Catalog Number: 43-146
     Price: $24.99

   * Any Brand Pager.

Alrght, here it is, plain, simple, and effective:

   1. Take your Radio Shack Dialer and program it with the number to your
      pager.

   2. Keep your dialer with you at all times. (Every good phreak should have
      one anyway.)

   3. When you need to make a Capture, wait for the person who has made the
      call to get off the phone (obviously.)

   4. Pick-up the same phone the person has made the call from.

   5. Hold the Pocket Dialer up to the Mouth Piece of the phone, and press the
      Memory button (assuming you did like I said and programmed the Dialer
      with your pager number. If not dial you're a bonehead and you have to
      dial your Pager number manually with the Pocket Dialer.)

   6. Once your Pager answers and requests you to "[E]nter the number you are
      dialing from at the tone," hit REDIAL on the phone. Once the phone has
      redialed, hang-up.

   7. Beep-beep. Check your pager. You have just captured the last number
      dialed from that phone.

Like I said, plain, simple, and cool enough to be in a James Cameron flick.

                                WHAT DUMBASS?!?

By the way, I've already been asked the Ingenious question: "how come you need
a Pocket Dialer to do this? Why can't you just call your Pager and then hit
Redial on the phone and Capture the Redial that way?" Well you can, but the
only Number you'll be capturing is your own pager number you just dialed.
(Duh!) If you wan't to Capture the redial you have to find away to dial a
source which will decode the DTMF tones, and you have to be able to preserve
the tones in the first place. The closest alternative to the method described
in this file, is to call your Pager on one phone in the house, and once your
page answers, pick-up the phone you want to Capture from and hit Redial.
This'll work fine, but you might have a little trouble remaining inconspicuous
about the whole thing--running back and forth and all.

                                     OUTRO

Anyway, that's it. Thanx to Hades (IIRG-Net) for pointing out the obvious to
me. Look for more oleBuzzard philez at kn0wledge phreak BBS or any UnionNET or

                    Hacking On the Highway: An Introduction
                    by Joshua Tower and The Men From Mongo

Caller ID, ANI, DNRs, AMA, data taps, and ignorantly conceived totalitarian
legislation has made the art of hacking much more dangerous than it was only a
few years ago. Back in the days of (the old YIPL originated) TAP magazine,
Fred Steinbeck wrote "The Ten Commandments of Phone Phreaking"; the first of
which was (paraphrased) "Do nothing over any phone traceable to you." This
should be common sense to anyone who hasn't just crawled out from under a
rock. Yet, we see so many dumb shits out there who continue to hack over their
home phone lines. If you are one of these people, you are an idiot and
probably deserve to get caught. While we call BBSes and occasionally get a
conference call into our lines from some LLs out on the Left Coast, We pay our
hefty phone bills on time every month and do nothing illegal on the line.
They can DNR it all year long. All they'll find out is that Josh only calls
his parents once a week and that we order a lot of Chinese take-out.

The idea is to hack on the highway (the pavement kind for those of you who've
read too much Wired). This isn't as difficult as you might think, and doesn't
require you to spend $2000 on a new laptop. Yes, you're going to have to spend
some money, but not that much. If you don't have a job we suggest you get off
your ass and find something to bring in some cash. Besides, the authorities
tend to look at you in a slightly better light if it looks like you're a
responsible member of society, especially if you're a "good responsible kid
who works after school." This we know from experience.

The main items that are required are a laptop or similar portable system and a
modem. A brand-new state-of-the-art laptop can cost upwards of $2000 depending
on what you buy, but you don't need state-of-the-art for porta-hacking. All
you really need is something that you can hook a modem to, run terminal
software, and do a little data storage. One can find older laptops for under
$100 in the classified ad sections of newspapers and in the Pennysaver,
Bargain News, or whatever the ad paper is called in your locale. Hamfests and
computer shows are also a good source. One of us saw an 8088 laptop at one for
$15.  Just make sure the unit either has an internal modem (even a 1200 will
do for most hacking purposes) or has an RS-232 or PCMCIA port to add an
external modem. If you're going the external RS-232 modem route, the modem
will need to able to run off batteries. Make sure that the power supply that
goes with the modem is a DC output supply.  Many modems use AC output
supplies, and the modem will be much more difficult to convert to battery
operation. For a while there were these "pocket modems" being sold which were
the size of a pack of cigarettes and ran off a 9 volt battery. We haven't seen
them offered lately, but they still should be available on the used and
surplus equipment market.

For complete connectivity, acquire an acoustic coupler for your modem. This
device attaches to the handset of any phone and plugs into your modem's RJ-11
jack. It is essential for modeming from payphones; where in most instances you
don't have access to a terminal block or phone jack. Two devices of interest
are available from Konexx/Unlimited Systems Corp. (http://www.konexx.com/ for
product information). The first is the Model 204 "Konexx Koupler" ($140). It
plugs into the RJ-11 jack of a modem and provides acoustic coupling between
the modem and a telephone handset.  According to company literature it
operates up to 14.4K baud on electronic phones, and up to 2400 baud on
payphones and other phones that use a carbon microphone. The second is the
Model 305 "Modem Koupler" ($300). This is a 2400 baud acoustically coupled RS-
232 modem. Both units are powered off a 9V battery. Our personal preference is
towards the Model 204. It is less expensive overall when bought with a modem
(14.4K PCMCIA modems are down to $130 new. RS-232 modems are even less.),
enables one to communicate at higher speeds than does the Model 305, and
offers greater overall versatility.

There are also a few other things that you should also throw into your porta-
hack kit:

- Can wrench or 7/16" nutdriver - The tool that is needed to open up bridging
  heads, pedestals, demarc points, and other places where you can hook in to
  receive a dialtone

- RJ-11 to alligator clip adaptor - a/k/a "Beige Box". Go the deluxe route and
  make one with piercer clips (what lineman test sets are equipped with) so
  you can also hook into a single pair drop wire if needed.

- Phone cords - You will probably run into many instances where you will be
  able to use one; so keep 'em handy. We keep a 12 foot modular line cord in
  our kits for when a conventional hook-up presents itself. Those retractable
  50 foot units is very handy for running a line from a phone can to a nearby
  place of concealment, and takes up little space.

- Leatherman Tool, Gerber Multi-Plier, et. al. - The standard hacker tool.
  Don't leave home without it.

- Lineman test set or one piece phone with "beige box" adaptor

- Wireless phone jack system - This system appears to have great potential. It
  costs about $100 and consists of a base unit and an extension unit. The base
  unit is plugged into any AC outlet near an existing phone line and connected
  to the line. The extension unit is plugged into any other outlet and gives
  you a phone line without the need to run cable. As long as both outlets are
  on the same transformer feed from the electric company, you should be able
  to hook this system up to a phone line and AC outlet in a utility room, and
  then go to another room with an AC outlet and have a phone connection. This
  could even be extended from one building to another provided both buildings
  were on the same transformer feed. With the electric company bridging
  transformers for remote meter reading, the range could be longer.

- Prepaid Calling Cards - Currently the safest and best way to make modem
  calls from a payphone. Since the calls are paid for, there's no toll fraud
  flag that can come up to trip you later. Most prepaid calling card services
  don't forward CID information as well; although you will still have to
  contend with the service's WATS line getting your ANI data if you call it
  direct.

- Proper attire and demeanor - In many places and instances it's a big help to
  look and act like you belong there. One should also have a plausible story
  set straight in advance in case they are questioned.

                         Some Notes on Payphone Usage

The problems with payphones (whether Bell or COCOT) are that they are
difficult to hook a modem up to and interrupt the connection every few minutes
in order to tell you that you have to put more money in. The solution is to
use your acoustic coupler and a calling card of some sort.

COCOTs usually have a modular jack at the demarc point (standard telco
arrangement since the COCOT's wiring is the responsibility of the customer,
just like with a residential line), and since they require external power
there is usually an AC outlet somewhere nearby as well. DTP a sticker that
says "Property of Dingleberry Telecom" (or whatever the name of the COCOT
company is) put it on the base unit of a wireless phone jack system, and hook
up the base unit to the COCOT's phone line and AC outlet. Find a nice secure
place somewhere nearby which has a handy AC outlet off of the same transformer
feed. Plug in the extension unit and have fun.  Anybody who might notice the
little adjunct you've added to the COCOT line will see the official-looking
sticker on it and think it was something the company installed.

                               Things To NOT Do
            (Taken from actual stories we've heard over the years.)

*   Don't drive up to a phone can, park next to it, and run a phone cable into
    your car to porta-hack.

*   Don't porta-hack from a hotel room after renting it under your real name.
    This applies doubly when the hotel is either currently a host to, or has
    previously hosted a hacker con.

*   Don't porta-hack off your neighbor's phone line(s). In particular, don't
    run a length of twisted pair from the neighbor's demarc point through your
    bedroom window to your box.

*   Don't try to hook into any pedestal box that has the local electric
    company's logo on it.

*   Don't fuck with any of the equipment at the connection points you leech
    service off of.

*   Don't go visiting manholes in order to porta-hack.

*   Don't porta-hack in public places wearing a "2600" t-shirt or wearing the
    same outfit you go to Marilyn Manson shows in. Clown make-up, however, is
    acceptable.

*   Don't tell the whole fucking world (or even non-implicated friends) about
    last night's porta-hacking session.

*   Don't porta-hack at the phone can in the front of your local gun range.

*   Don't bring your entire gang of friends and a keg while porta-hacking. A
    girlfriend and a bottle of Wild Turkey is acceptable. However, indulge in
    both in moderation.

*   Don't go porta-hacking on roller-blades. This is not the movies. Don't use
    skateboards, mountain bikes, or lame four-cylinder compact cars either.
    Real Cyberpunks go porta-hacking in Ford Crown Victorias, Chevy Caprices,
    Dodge Diplomats, and other big cars that have V8 engines under the hood.
    This also applies to hackers who are under 16, as we consider drivers'
    licenses optional.

*  Do not carry a flare gun while porta-hacking. Refer again to THAT fucking
   movie if you don't understand what we're talking about. Carry a .357
   instead.

                               How To Porta-Hack

What the hell do you think this is? The alt.2600 FAQ? Get a fucking clue.

                                                      Respectfully submitted,
                                                             Joshua Tower and
                                                           The Men From Mongo
                                            (Icky bo-bo to you too, asshole.)

"Fleeting Love"
--------
by Alan C. Dougall

Friendly concerning love
pleases and delights, with
responses intent on fun.

Warm affectionate love
comforts and listens, but
secretly expressed burns.

Selfish shameful love
impresses and flatters, but
considers only the moment.

Impatient passionate love
dreams and devours, yet
boiled fast cools quickly.

Shared longing love
creates and destroys with
the same words wheels turn.

Realistic practical love
challenges and defends; so
conscience deprives its end.

Final opportunistic love
seeks and sows desires, yet
knows time will steal it away.

Restrained parting love
lingers and grieves, yet
pretends life goes on.

Separated solitary love
wallows or diverts, to
feed or choke the past.

Patient considerate love
allows space and time, and
hopes pause in anguish.

Selfless undying love
surrenders and frees, and
dies to bring rebirth.

Responsible decisive love
cannot rest (forgive me)
until you are safe and found (in Him).

Deepest love (He knows)
requests (if you permit) to
hear from you and pray.


"Beauty Sleep"
--------
by Leilani Wright

I feel I ought to warn you about dreams.
They do not always mean
what you would like them to.
Take my advice;
lie on your right side,
furthest from your heart
and not on your back,
where the vitals are always too exposed.
If symbols reoccur,
like a train, gun, or snake at a station,
do not assume a sexual slant.
Roll over quietly. Stop snoring.
Do not identify with the murderer
who descends to the platform.
He is rarely you
and will only disturb the warm
body sleeping at your side.
Let the danger pass; you can always
use another form of transportation,
like your own legs
when you walk in your sleep
and wake up naked
in the neighbor's flowering plants.
This means fresh air and plenty of exercise.
And you will be fortunate
to remember so little by morning.


"Touch of Light"
--------
by Michael Morain

The whiteness of the dawn
Soft like a cloud against the dark
Moving like an ocean
Quietly, stealthily, carefully
With fingers of light caressing
Touching, holding, tasting
Tracing our outlines against the sand
Measuring our footprints
Against the shadows
Like a wind shining and sparkling
Cleansing the dust motes of our atoms
Warming us, holding us
And in a moment
Gone.

"Did They Wonder?"
--------
by Dominick Freda

What are we here for?
The question has been asked
Endless times,
Contemplated over and over
With never an answer.
As long as I can remember,
Reaching the height where
I could see myself reflected
In a mirror,
I have stared at that antithetical being,
Asking him, "Who are you?
"Why are you here?"
He doesn't know the answer.

Religion tells us just to serve.
Politicians tell us to lead or follow.
Dichotomies ramble and force division.
Economists say we should be rational.
Societies say we should be normal.
Why?

Do we exist just to give life,
Propagate, be fruitful and multiply?
Or are we here to hate, and kill;
Give off deadly fumes so that
One day we will end our wonders,
In search of that ideal, that eternal progression?

Millions of years ago a spark
Created all life
From some thoughtless phenom,
Some unfathomable chasm,
Of nothing and everything;
The Alpha and Omega,
Nameless and unconscious.
And Pop lost his tail.
And Mom stood and walked.
And they saw that IT WAS GOOD.

But did they wonder?
Did they dream of successes?
Or fear demons in the night?
Huddle in the cold,
Loving to embrace?

Did they wonder?

Did they ever think of their
Children's tomorrow?
And could they imagine a
Beautiful and terrible world
Of Darwinian technology,
Knowing that each step taken,
Each triumph, each fall,
Counted the dying
Of mankind?

Did they wonder?
