   From: THUMPER RABBIT

Yup, thats the number for U-Vic. Once
you are there select class 1 and then
try different user id's, preceaded by a
'L'

Eg. 'L S4295'

The S means student. While this gives
you less power, there are more of them,
so you have a greater chance of getting
one that is active.

Note: Class 1 is forr the VM370. I
haven't used the other classes and so
can't give any advice with those.

You need an account for the Uvic
number, but try entering a class no
(i.e class 1), or try help. NOTE-some
classes will only work with a VT100
emulator, such as that available for
the ATARIs.

First of all, Rambug, that number, is
like old!!!!, I thought that by now
everyone would have it, I posted it
about a year ago on the forbidden zone
, anyways it is the Datapac information
service and it is for public use,
that's why no password.  Instead of
cntrl-l, you can also type SET 2:1

Here is another datapac number (Ah
Safe!), please don't delete any files

Oh, forget it, I can't post it, cause
is a certain person sees it, he'll
kill me.  So leave me email and I'll
give it to you.

Here is another interesting Datapac
number

First of all, that 9210086 password was
posted about 5 message before
yours by someone, my password is not
for an email service, it is for
market scan,  a stock market service,
but i won't give that password
away, the one I asked people to leave
me email if they want it is
for IntelliGeneetics.

About Box plans, I don't think Capt
Blood is gonna appreciate it
very much if you're gonna give away the
files from the elite boad
on the grounds.

Anyways the datapac # for
Intelligenetics is 

                          1 3125
415007800

 The one for market scan is: 
39500032,i
                             
41100093,i;

It must be entered as shown or you'll
get the wrong service.

Phone datapac (388-9300), type set 2:1
                          type:    
39500032,i;

Here's one you may not have..... don't

Call CityLink at 222-2000 (Vancouver
Number)
 
   It's a multi-line bbs system, with
sub-bbs's for Atari, Commodore, Amiga,
IBM, Tandy, etc, as well as many other
things.  Very fast, easy to use.  Sort
of a mini-Compuserve.  It's still in
the development stages (went online
sometime in March I think....), but is
very nice to use.  If you call after
midnight, it's quite inexpensive (as
compared to CIS!)
 
You'll have to wait 24 hours to be
verified before you can store info on
it, but you have unlimited read access.
 Have fun!
