Introduction
------------
  Well this is the How To file on The Ring-Busy Device.  This is very
simple to construct and is also very simple to connect on someones fone
line.  It is probably the easiest thing you will ever do what is actually
worth what little effort you put in.  Now your probably saying to yourslef:


What The Hell Is A Ring-Busy Device?
------------------------------------
  A Ring-Busy Device is ofcourse a device that when connected on to you
enemys fone line will make it so that when you call this persons fone you
will get a Ring-Busy.  A ring-busy is exactly what it says, A ring and then
a busy, That is One ring and from then on busy.  Also the pathetic person
who has the fone that this device is being used on will not have his fone
ring.   This means he will not even know that anyone is calling.  Your
probably saying BIG DEAL, why not just cut his line!    Well this is
better because he can still use his fone, thats right, if he wanted to he
could pick up his fone and he would get a dial tone, he cnld then dial out
not knowing of this device.  This is especially useful for those r0dent
BBS's that are pissing you off.  If someone has a BBS and this device is on
the line then they wont get any calls for their BBS (hehe), and they wont
know why either!


How the Ring-Busy Device Was Conceived
--------------------------------------
  It all started one morning at 4am when I went out special to steal this
emergency police/fire fone.  Once I got it home I hooked it up to my line
and noticed that whenever someone called me they would get a ring-usy,
this was extremely odd, so I tried to figure out why the hell that was
happening, and I did, and now we have the Ring-Busy device.  It is also
useful if dont want to talk to someone but you dont want to put the fone
off the hook, just put this little device on and those leeches that keep
bothering you for games wont be a problem anymore.


Ring-Busy Device Plans
----------------------
  As I said before this is very very simple to construct.

Parts Needed:
 (1) 7k resistor (7000 OHMS)
 (1) Fone line
 (1/2) a brain (at least)

Procedure:
  Now all you have to do is connect up this 7k resistor to the fone line
on the red and green terminals, Here is an easy diagram of how to add it
onto someones fone line.  The diagram represents the nice little box that
the fone line comes through on the side of your house.

  NOTE:  This is for a 1 fone line configuration.  If they have two I think
you'd figure it out?  If not too Bad...

Diagram:
          #########
          #       #
          # G-7-R #
          #       #
          #########
                                         G - Green terminal
 R - Red Terminal
 7 - 7k resistor

  Now if they have 2 fone lines then connect another 7k resistor to the
black and yellow terminals.

  Its That Simple....  7k resistors might be a some-what hard to get, try
your local electronics store and dont bother with Rat Shack, I already
checked, they dont sell them.  If you must, a 6.5k or maybe 7.5k resistor
will work, but Ma Bell uses 7k so I do the same.


Suggestions
-----------
  Here are a few ways to use or misuse this device.

  1) Connect it on to your fone:  Simple just cut off the modular end of
your fone cord and connect it to the red and green wires, then connect the
modular plug you cut off to the resistor too, and then just plug the fone
in and you have a permanent Ring-Busy Device, Another way of doing it would
be to put a SPST switch in there so you can turn it on or off, thats what I
do and it works great (Especially when r0dents start bothering me)

  2) Connect it to your favorite enemys fone line, and enjoy while watching
him try to figure out why he isn't getting any fone calls, BUT if the luser
has 2 fone lines I suggest that you connect one Ring-Busy Device onto each
fone so he doesn't get calls on the other fone from people telling him that
his fone is phucked.
