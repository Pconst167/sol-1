Ok, nuff o that shit.

        Phreaking has been the most popular skill amoung beginning hackers
   since hacking first became the dark side of computer knowledge.  It is
   a proven fact (says me) that nearly all hackers are acceptable phreakers,
   yet not all phreakers are acceptable hackers.  I have met many phreaks,
   who knew everything I could ever want to know about phreaking, but then
   knew absolutely not enough about a Unix (by far the easiest system to hack
   other than a DEC server) to save his life.  Needless to say, this "expert"
   was busted quickly as I expected.  One major problem with "phreaks" is that
   they have been phreaking so long, that they begin to draw attention to
   themselves by 1) Bragging, 2) Using things from their house constantly,
   3) Connecting to and brute force hacking a dangerous system directly, due
   to lack of hacking knowlege.
        Well, If you aren't already wondering, the point of this file is
   to give the real hacker some technical knowlege of HARDWIRE phreaking,
   as most hackers already know the uses of a PBX, EXTENDER, DIVERTER,
   etc.  (And so does any code kid)
     Hardwire phreaking is very illegal, and if you are caught, it depends
   the cop and the excuse, but you may slide right off without ever seeing
   a judge, or you may end up in a lot of shit, depending on how you are
   percieved by the cop.  You may want to dress as NORMAL as possible, to
   avoid looking obvious if caught.  Dark clothes, but yet normal "clean"
   looking clothes are the best by far.
     Only bring tools that you can ditch easily, that way you don't look like
   you are planning on breaking into some guy's house, or rewire the
   entire phone box.  Either one is something you don't want someone to suspect
   you of.  You will not get off easily of either of the two.
     Ok, enough of the general shit, here is what you want to know!

      This is a brief guide of some of the techniques I have developed myself,
   have found them to work quite well, so keep in mind that everything I have
   done I will say that I have done it, and everything I haven't done, I will
   say so.  I am not a liar, and I want you to be safe, so i don't want you
   trying some bullshyt and getting yourself caught.

      THE LOOP TAP:
   """""""""""""

        This is a very easy way to bug someone, but be carefull, as the phone
   company may find it if you leave it too long, because the loops are used
   frequently by telco employees, not to mention some pissed off guy who has
   had is phone fuked up all night.

    Ingredients:
    """"""""""""
    1 1.5k resistor
    1 1k resistor
    4 alligator clips
    1 1ft piece of insulated wire
    1 beige box (yeah a phone w/aligator clips duh)

             O     O Tapped line  \
             |                     |
             /                     | Lines bridged with 1.5k
         1.5k\                     | resistor
             /                     |
             | 1k                   /
             O/\/\/O Looped line tied w/1k resistor


     Ok, what you are going to do here is basically cut the wire in half,
   and solder and aligator clip to one end of each of the wires.  Now solder
   the other two ends (that you havent done anything with) to the ends of the
   resistor.  This is one of the main ingredients for all types of field
   phreaking.  (remember that) Now solder the other two alligator clips to
   each end of the 1k resistor.
        Now I am assuming that you have already been inside a phone box,
   (if not you can find them alleys mounted to a telephone pole, or sometimes
   behind a bush, standing upright from the ground about 3ft tall) and know
   something about them.  When you open the box, and see the rows of terminals,
   you want to take your phone, and find the line you wish to tap.  If you
   aren't somewhere in the person's alley, you aren't at the right box, so
   quit reading this and go jump off a cliff.  Anyways, open the box (a flathead
   screwdriver jammed inbetween the guard ring and the flat side of the nut
   will open it quickly and quietly) and start running down the rows calling ANI
   numbers looking for your girlfriends er I mean victim's line.  When you
   find the right line, remember it!!  I usually just replace all the terminal
   covers as I go except the right one.  Now pick another line, (that you
   already went down looking for the last number) and call a loop on this line
   (not the line you want to tap) and connect the 1k resistor accross the
   terminals.  What this does is hold the line open, so that you can meet
   up with it on the other end of the loop.  Now connect the 1.5k resistor
   from the ring of the tied down line, to the ring og the line you wish
   to tap.  The ring (in case you are just a lame warez kid or something)
   is the red, which is usually the side that is NOT grounded to the chassis
   of the box.  I think it's the right, but I may be wrong.  All I know is
   it is the positive side, which if you have a good test phone, will light
   when you have it hooked right, therefore you know then which side is RING
   and which side is TIP by the color of the wires on your phone.
        Anyways, what you have now is a line which is on one side of the loop,
   preferably the QUIET side.  (I'll tell you why in a minute)  Now what you
   do is go home, call the other end of the loop, and you will be able to
   hear faintly the conversation (if any) over the loop.  If you dont hear
   anything, then that means there is not conversation (ie no connection,
   therefore the phone is still on hook, so you won't hear a dialtone (thanks
   to the 1.5k resistor)).  If you hear a LOUD tone (this is why we used the
   quiet end of the loop), then you did something wrong, and the line
   you connected to the loop isn't open anymore, so you may want to go back
   and try a different resistor. (smaller)  The best way to check is to call
   it from the box, using another line, just to be sure.  That way you don't
   have to wait until you get home.
        It is best not to leave this on for more than one full night, because
   in the morning, the telco guy is gonna come to fix it.  Nobody is gonna
   be able to do anything until morning, so your pretty safe for a night.
     Just make sure you put everything back the way it was when you are done,
   and don't forget the fucking plastic cover caps!!!!!

        If you feel like you want to have this gizmo hooked up longer, what
   could do is move the wires of the line you are calling the loop with to
   another set of terminals.  If you put a hmmm not sure, maybe 5k resistor
   across the terminals of the line that you moved him to, it MAY drop the
   voltage of the ring enough to disable a ring from incomming calls.  There-
   fore neither person gets calls, but they can both make calls.  So they
   never notice anything weird until they both pick up at the same time.
     Just an idea, sorry.

     This tap has worked for me many times.  I have never left it for more
   than one night, and I wouldn't advise doing so unless you are positive
   someone isn't going to use the loop-connected line for a few days.

  THE LINE THIEF:
  """""""""""""""

        This is really not usefull at all, but it can be if you decide
   to make it usefull.  However to choose to make it usefull is up to
   you.  What you will need for this is the following:

    4 alligator clips
    2 pieces of insulated wire (red and black)
    2 1k resistors (optional)
    1 Test Phone

   Solder the clips to the ends of the wires.  Now strip the middle of the
   wires, and solder each end of the resistor into the middle of each of the
   wires. It should look like an H. Now go to the person's alley (or main box)
   in which you want to do your damage, and find the box which contains
   their terminals.  Call a neat-o 1-900-sex-gang number or even better, an
   automated converence line such as the At&t conference.
        Connect you test phone to the person's line (I am assuming you already
   found the line using an ANI demo and a little time calling it on all the
   lines) and call the number you wanna call on his line.  Hopefully something
   something extremely expensive.  Once you connect to what you are calling
   connect the red and black wires to the terminals.  You should hear the
   volume drop, but the line should still be audible.  Hang up the phone, and
   then pick up again, and you should still hear the line conversation. If not,
   use a resistor of a little less value.  If you called a conference line,
   this is a the best time to call a few people and transfer control.  If you
   don't want to transfer control you can just leave it, and keep control from
   your loop you are about to wire in.  Now disconnect your test phone,
   leaving the wires clipped in place, and connect to another line.  Call a
   local loop, and connect the other two clips to the line.  What you should
   have now is two wires connecting the two lines directly with a 1k resistor
   in between them.  It should look like an H like this:

                  O    O  Target line
                  | 1k |
                  }\/\/{
                  |    |
                  O    O  Loop line

        Now what you have is a complete call from the victim line (target
   line) to wherever you wanted.  The loop line has now been connected with
   a loop.  Both lines are being held open by the resistor which is shared
   between the two.  Hopefully you called the quiet end of the loop so that
   you don't kill everyone in the conference, and so you can check it from
   home to make sure it's still there.  No guessing here, if you get the
   loud loop tone when you call, it's gone, so start being paranoid.
        It is best that you remove this thing when you are done.  Hopefully
   before daylight.

   THE WOW TOOL:
   """""""""""""

        The wow tool is something I thought up one day when bullshiting
   with Dr. Delam, and Trouble.  We were thinking of ways to take down
   lame ass warez boards, and were trying to fgure out how to get a high
   enough voltage.  One theory was to use a stun gun, and run directly
   down the terminals, hopefully frying the modem.
     The stun gun theory was a very good idea, but the problem was buying
   a $40 stun gun.  We had to find something that was well over 120v DC
   because this is the standard ring voltage of the phone line.
     The new idea struck my in the forehead, so here it is:

     An automobile ignition coil is only about $10, and it will easily
   supply the nessessary voltage to take out the modem, answering machines,
   and possibly te serial port of the computer!  Here's the schematics:

    ___________
   |           |+
   | ))))))))o-|
   | )COIL)))]---------< Alligator clip
   | ))))))))o  -                     ---< alligator clip
   |____     |                        |
       |     o-    SPST 12v switch    |
      +|     | -                      -< alligator clip
      12v car or small
    motorcycle battery

      Ok, what you have here is the coil, with positive connected to the
   positive of the car battery.  A few motorcycle batterys in parallel will
   work better since they are smaller, but they wont last as long.  I
   prefer motorcycle batteries.  Now run the negative to a SPST switch,
   and the other terminal of the switch to the negative of the battery.
   MAKE SURE IT'S OFF!!!
        Ok, now run one wire (this may be tricky) from the center lug, which
   is actually a hole with a metal cup inside, and connect an alligator clip
   to the other end.  Make it long enough to reach from possibly a backpack
   to the phone box.  You will now need another wire with an alligator clip
   on each end.

   USING THE WOW TOOL:
   """""""""""""""""""

       Open the box and connect the clip from the tool to the RING of the
   the phone line.  This is the positive, and it MUST be the positive.
   now connect the two clip wire, with on clip to the other terminal (TIP)
   and the other clip to ground (the frame of the box).
        Connect a test phone and call the number you are trying to kill,
   and hang up.  Disconnect your phone.  When you hear it stop ringing,
   this means the modem or person, or answering machine has answered.
   Flip the switch and laugh your ass off, cause there should be some smoke
   in there any minute!!!!  Heh...well, needless to say, run it for about
   15 seconds, and the get the fuck out of there.  Make sure nobody sees you,
   cause what you are doing is a federal offense.  (Funny as shit though :)


        Well, that's it for now, have phun, and don't do anything I
   wouldn't do ... Heh...um yeah...


   Quick greets going to (but of course)

    Dr. Delam (hurry back)
    Trouble   (Pussy whipped)
    Kaleidox  (whats up?)
    And all the other cool guys...like AJAX (not even)

     Don't brag, you get yourself in trouble. All the hackers I know that have
  been busted, had it happen due to bragging.  So watch it guys.
  Be safe.
