This file is for folks who want to get started using outdials.  I tried to
explain everything in detail, assuming no prior knowledge.   Have phun.
I have used a lot of information obtained from other g-files in putting
together this file.  So, let me give credit where it is due:
 
        Info on Pac*It came from Doc Savage - many thanks
          Telenet modem addresses courtesy of Sam Brown
                Other stuff I got from The Mentor
 
Of course, there is plenty of stuff that I don't know where it came
from.  Oh well, thanks to whoever I got other info from.  Special thanks
to Dart Catcher who created and runs my favorite local board (the only
cool board in the whole damn state):  The Dartboard  - call it!
 
 
Allright, here goes:
 
Introduction: Outdials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Outdials are extremely useful things which can be used to call long
 distance without paying and without using codes.  Essentially, an
 outdial is a modem which is connected to a network.  You call up the
 network, then connect to the outdial over the network, then use the modem
 to call whatever system (BBS) you want to connect to.  Sounds
 complicated, but it really isn't.
 
 You will be using modems which are connected to the Telenet network.  There
 are outdials connected to Telenet in every area code.  So, you can call
 just about anywhere you want.  The problem is that generally, these outdials
 don't take collect connections over Telenet.  So, we have to use a way of
 getting around that.  That way is called PAC*IT.  PAC*IT is a service
 which is connected to Telenet.
 
 
Part I - Connecting to the Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Ok, first you need to connect to the network.  The way to connect
to Telenet in order to use these outdials is through Pac*it, which is
some sort of gay PC pursuit deal.  Anyway, call Pac*it: 1-800-234-2796
at 2400/1200 7E1.  After connecting, log on:
 
           1200 baud:  just hit <cr> a couple of times
           2400 baud:  send an @ (shift-2) then a <cr>
 
It will now say
 
        PAC*IT Plus
 
        XXXXXXXXXXX111
 
The X's don't matter, what matters is the last three digits.  You can only
connect to U.S. modems if this number is between 100 and 300.  If the
three umbers on the end aren't between 100 and 300 then hang up and call
back.  Eventually, you will get one that is OK.
 
Under the numbers it will say: 'TERMINAL =' just hit return here.
You will now see the well known '@' prompt.  This means you are
connected to Telenet.
 
Part II - Connecting to the Outdial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Now, you need to know a bit about the way
systems on Telenet are addressed.  To connect to a system (i.e. outdial)
at the '@' prompt, you type the address of the system you want and hit
return.  You must use the Telenet International Address Format to
connect to outdials if you called in through PAC*IT.  It looks like
this:
 
      |------------------------  Data Network Ident. Code (DNIC)
      |
      |      |-----------------  Area code
      |      |
      |      |     |----------- DTE address (the specific system in the
      /\     |    / \                               area code)
     /  \   / \  /   \  /\----- Port Address
     IIII   AAA  NNNNN  PP
 
For example the Telenet address of 201 346  becomes 31102010034600
 
 
So, connect to the outdial in the area code you want by typing in the complete
address of the outdial.  I know, you are saying to yourself "Where the
hell do I get addresses of outdials?"  Well, at the end of this g-file,
of course.
 
After you have entered the address, you will get a 'CONNECTED' or else
some error message.  If you get an error, try again, or try another
outdial.
 
Part III - Using the Outdial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you connect, hit ctrl-E a few times, then hit return.  After a few
seconds you should get a message like '*Hello, I'm Ready*'  You are now
connected to a modem!   Help is available, just enter a ? or H.  The
command you are most concerned with is D (dial command).  So, enter D
and it should ask you for the number.  Just type in the phone number
you want to dial (no area code).  It should then say "Dialing..."  If
you connect, great, you should know what to do now.  If the number is
busy, or out-of-order or whatever, the outdial will return to command
mode.  You can then dial again.
 
You can generally disconnect from the outdial itself by entering an '@'
then hitting return in the command mode.  You should then get the '@'
prompt back.  Now you can connect to another outdial in a different area
code if you want to.  Just follow the procedure in Part II again.

Part V - Finishing Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As best I can tell, this is a very safe method if you don't abuse it,
over use it, etc.  Remember, this is a 1-800 number, so if you call it
200 times in a week or 30 times in a day, you may get a call yourself.
So, to keep this method alive for everyone to use, don't do this too
much.
 
I hope this file has been helpful to you.  There are plenty of people
who know a lot more about this stuff that I do.  But, I will definitely
try to help anyone out if I can.  I can be reached most easily at:
