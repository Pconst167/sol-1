         What is a diverter?
         A diverter is an device that the phone company hooks up to a phone
line to re-route calls from a telephone that's rings and doesn't answer to
another phone that should be answered.  It is similar to call forwarding.

         How Are Diverters Used?
         Let's say you have a number that you know has a diverter on it.
When you call the number, first you will hear three or four rings, and then
a click, and fainter ringing.  This is the diverter in action, re-routing
your call to the specified number.  When the dude who has the diverter
answers, just say you have the wrong number or something, and wait for him
to hang up the phone.  MAKE SURE YOU STAY ON THE LINE !!!  You should then
hear a pause for a little, and then a dial tone fainter than your own one.
This dial tone is the dial tone of the diverted phone, and any call you make
will be charged to his bill!

        How can I find Diverters?
        The easiest way to find diverters are to whip out the good old yellow
pages and let your fingers do the walking until you find numbers for '24 hour'
plumbers, lawyers, doctors, or whatever.  Most likely there is not someone on
call at the office, and all calls will be diverted to the person's home phone
number.  If the doctor/lawyer/plumber has more than one phone line, call all
of them until you get one with a diverter on it.

         What Can I Use A Diverter For?
         Diverters, if you find one with a local exchange, can be used like an
extender, except that you direct dial the call like you would on a normal
non-phreaked long distance phone call.   Diverters can also be used for con-
ference calls, either through an AT&T operator or Alliance (0-700) con-
ferencing.  If you really want to get malicious, use an AT&T Calling Card
on a diverter.
        To get you started:
        Yes, I am being a nice guy by giving you a few extenders to try out
and use so you can get the 'pheel' of how a diverter works.  These numbers
are most likely not local calls to you so I suggest you use an extender to
dial them with.  These were all working as of the date of the writing of this
file (July '85).  Remember:  Only call after business hours when the diverters
will be turned on, or else you will just get the office answering.

About Diverters - Appendum by The Blue Buccaneer

   The diverters file was a very good file.  It failed to inform you of one
simple fact:  That diverters are only still used in places which have not been
updated to the ESS (or some of the higher levels of X-BAR).  This is because
you are able to get Call Forwarding in these areas, thus there is no longer a
use for the less efficient diverters.  So, before you rip open your phone book
to the yellow pages in search of some poor 24 hour doctor or plumber, check to
see what area you're in.  (Check the front of the book to see if Call Forward-
ing is offered.  Or call your operator or local business office.)
   You should also be aware that a large number of doctors (etc) use the same
24 hour service (even if with different phone lines).  The poor soul on duty
may not understand why she is getting "Is Joe there?" on every one of her
lines.  Also, if people abuse them, the person on duty may report the large
number of "no one on the line"'s or "sorry, wrong number"'s.  Telco might then
start recording the numbers of people who call them.  As always, be careful!
