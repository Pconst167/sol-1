     First  and foremost, thanks are due to all of the subscribers  of  the
     Homebrew  Digest  who contribute their  collective  experience,  tips,
     techniques,  and of course, recipes.  Through this sharing we  improve
     our  homebrewing  skills  and our knowledge of beer  and  the  brewing
     industry.  The digest would not be possible without the dedicated work
     of  Rob  Gardner, the digest coordinator; we all  owe  Rob  tremendous
     praise  for diligently collecting articles, collating them,  and  dis-
     tributing  the daily digest to a list of well over 1,000  subscribers.
     Thank you Rob.  Special thanks are also due to A.E. Mossberg who main-
     tains the digest archives at Miami. Without these archives much of the
     collective wisdom of the Homebrew Digest would be lost---especially to
     future subscribers.

                                  Introduction



     The digest began back in 1988 with calls for a compiled book of  reci-
     pes first surfacing in Digest #77.  Since then, there have been sever-
     al pleas for a compiled source of recipes, and several offers to  cre-
     ate such a compilation.  None have yet surfaced.

     The  recipes in this book are ordered by general categories,  although
     these  are somewhat artificial and not always cohesive.  For  example,
     Chapter 3 covers styles that do not fit neatly into another  category,
     yet bear little relation to each other---steam beer bears little rela-
     tion to wheat beers.  These styles were grouped together because there
     were  not  enough of any one of these styles to  warrant  giving  them
     their  own chapter.  Chapters 7-10 are all made up of  loosely-related
     styles.

     This recipe compilation will hopefully be a useful source of  informa-
     tion  that serves you long and well. (If anybody wants to do volume  2
     of this compilation, we stopped compiling recipes at issue #572).

     In  several  of these recipes the authors did not  fully  explain  the
     process or did not mention steps and ingredients that theyassume home-
     brewers  know about---for example, several recipes do not tell you  to
     prime  with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of corn sugar, even though that  is  common
     practice among most homebrewers on the net.  Most recipes are 5-gallon
     batches  unless otherwise specified.  If you are unsure about how  any
     beer  is  produced, we suggest consulting a general  homebrewing  text
     such as Charlie Papazian's Complete Joy of Homebrewing (a brief bibli-
     ography  is  provided at the end of this book).  One aspect  of  these
     recipes  that   we did not make consistent is the authors'  choice  of
     hops  units.   Many homebrewers still prefer to measure  hops  by  the
     ounce, while others prefer to use more exact measurements such as  the
     AAU,  HBU, or IBU.  These are all related to the amount of alpha  acid
     in  the hops; basically, 1 ounce of hops with 1% alpha is 1  AAU.   If
     you use 2 ounces of Cascades hops with an alpha of 5.2%, then you  are
     adding  10.4  AAUs of hops.  (See Miller's Complete Handbook  of  Home
     Brewing for more information about hops units or the 1990 special hops
     issue of Zymurgy magazine).

     Cheers!

                              CHAPTER 1: PALE ALE



     Pale  ales are one of the most popularly brewed styles among  Homebrew
     Digest  subscribers.  This chapter includes the substyles  India  Pale
     Ale,   and Bitter.  The pale ale style is generally brewed with  2-row
     pale  malt for a full mash recipe, or with light extract for the  more
     basic recipes.  The beer is generally characterized by a light  yellow
     or  golden color, although some will range to a coppery  color  (espe-
     cially  among India Pale Ales) depending on the types and  amounts  of
     specialty  grains  added as an adjunct.  These  styles  are  typically
     well-hopped,  usually  with Fuggles, East Kent  Goldings,  or  perhaps
     Willamette  varieties. Fermentation is carried out at warmer  tempera-
     tures,  typically 60-70 degrees.  For more information about the  pale
     ale style, see Terry Foster's Pale Ale, Fred Eckhardt's The Essentials
     of Beer Style, (both available from the Association of Brewers) gener-
     al beer texts such as Michael Jackson's World Guide to Beer.

     Ingredients:

                    7 pounds        light, unhopped syrup
                    1 pound         Cara-pils malt, cracked
                    1 pound         light crystal malt, cracked
                    1-1/2 ounces    Hallertauer hops pellets
                    1 teaspoon      salt
                    1 teaspoon      citric acid
                    2-1/2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                    2 tablespoons   Irish moss
                    2 packs         Munton & Fison yeast

     Procedure:

     Put  cara-pils  and crystal malt in 2 gallon pot with  170-180  degree
     water  for one hour, stir occasionally.  Sparge into boiling pot  with
     enough water to bring volume to 3-1/2 gallons.  Add syrup and 1  ounce
     of  hops.  Boil one hour, adding Irish moss in last 1/2 hour  and  1/2
     ounce  hops in last 10 minutes.  Add salt, citric acid, and  nutrient.
     Put  in primary with enough water to bring volume to 5 gallons.  Pitch
     yeast at about 75 degrees.

     Comments:

     This is simple, yet a little different from any of my previous  batch-
     es. Ingredients were ordered from Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa---
     great company...good stuff and two-day delivery.

     Author: Martin Lodahl  (pacbell!pbmoss!mal@hplabs.HP.COM)
     Digest: July 18, 1989, Issue #203

     Ingredients:

                     3 pounds   light Scottish malt extract
                     3 pounds   2-row pale malt
                     9 AAU      Kent Goldings hops
                                Edme ale yeast
                     1 teaspoon gelatin
                     1 ounce    PolyClar-AT
                     1 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This  beer was made using the small-scale mash procedure described  by
     Miller in The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing.

     Comments:

     This  beer had an unpleasant "dry" feeling to it and left me  thirsty.
     Possibly  my  sparging procedure could be at fault with too  much  hot
     water  being  passed over the grains.  It is also  possible  that  the
     yeast  was too attenuative or that the fermentation temperatures  were
     too high (ambient temperature fluctuated between 70 and 90 degrees).

                               Yeast Test Recipe

     Author: Jeff Casey  (casey@alcvax.pfc.mit.edu)
     Digest: October 8, 1990, Issue #512

     Ingredients:
                   6.6 pounds M&F light unhopped malt extract
                   3/4 pound  M&F light unhopped spray
                   3/4 pound  crystal malt
                   1 teaspoon gypsum
                   2 ounces   clusters hops (boil)
                   1/2 ounce  cascades hops (finish)
                              ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 7-gallon recipe.  Steep crystal malt while bringing water to
     a boil.  Remove malt and add extract.  Boil.

     Comments:

     This is a 7-gallon recipe that was divided into 7 1-gallon  fermenters
     for the purpose of testing different yeasts.  Fermentation was carried
     out at 75-85 degrees.  Best results were obtained with Edme ale  yeast
     which  was well-rounded and slightly sweet.  Some diacetyl,  but  nice
     balance.  Whitbread ale yeast was lighter and crisper, but had a poor-
     er  head and some esters.  CWE ale yeast was very dry but had  a  good
     head and no esters---fermentation was frighteningly fast.

                                    Pale Ale

     Author: Rob Bradley (bradley@dehn.math.nwu.edu)
     Digest: September 26, 1990, Issue #504

     Ingredients:


                     7-8 pounds  English 2-row malt
                     1/2-1 pound crystal malt
                     3 ounces    Fuggles hops (boil)
                     3/4 ounce   Hallertauer hops (finish)
                                 ale yeast

     Procedure:

     You'll  get good yield and lots of flavor from English malt and  a  1-
     stage  150  degree mash. In the boil, I added the  finishing  hops  in
     increments:  1/4 ounce in last 30 minutes, 1/4 ounce in last  15  min-
     utes,  and  1/4 ounce at the end (steep 15 minutes) don't have  to  be
     Fuggles;  almost  any  boiling hops will do, I  usually  mix  Northern
     Brewer with Fuggles or Goldings (just make sure you get .12-.15 alpha)
     Conversion will probably only take 60 minutes rather than 90.  Depend-
     ing on when you stop the mash your gravity may vary as high as  1.050.
     That's a lot of body!

     Comments:

     This  is a simple all-grain recipe for a good pale ale that  lets  the
     beginner  concentrate on the mashing process.  Hallertauer may not  be
     traditional for ales, but neither is a modern piano for sonatas.   But
     I think Beethoven himself would have used one if he had one.

     Method:            Full mash (infusion)
     Original Gravity:  varies; up to 1.050
     Final Gravity:     varies; up to 1.020
     Primary Ferment:   N/A
     Secondary Ferment: N/A

     Author: Alex Jenkins   (atj@mirror.tmc.com)
     Digest: January 24, 1989, Issue #57

     Ingredients:

                      5 pounds     pale malt
                      1 pound      crystal malt
                      1 teaspoon   gypsum
                      3-1/2 pounds pale dry extract
                      1-1/3 pound  light brown sugar
                      1 ounce      Willamette hops (boil)
                      1-1/2 ounce  Hallertauer hops
                      1 teaspoon   Irish moss
                      1 ounce      Clusters hops pellets
                                   Red Star ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash  pale  malt,  crystal malt, and gypsum in 2-3/4  gallons  of  170
     degree  water; this should give initial heat of 155 degrees (pH  5.0).
     Maintain  temperature  at 140-155 degrees  for 2  hours.   Sparge.  To
     wort, add extract and brown sugar.  Boil with Willamette hops.   After
     15 minutes add Hallertauer and Irish moss.  Dry hop with clusters  and
     steep.  When cool, add wort to carboy and pitch yeast.


          The posted recipe called for 4 pounds of dry extract with  2
          cups reserved for priming.  This seemed excessive and a good
          way  to get exploding bottles, so we reduced the  amount  of
          extract  to 3-1/2 pounds and assumed that  standard  priming
          techniques  would be used, maybe replacing corn  sugar  with
          3/4 to 1 cup of malt extract.
          --- Ed.

     Comments:

     Notice  that  I screwed up the hops: Clusters are for  bittering,  and
     Willamette (or Fuggles) for aromatic.

     Method:            Partial mash
     Original Gravity:  1.048

                                 Too Sweet Ale

     Author: Bill Pemberton  (flash@virginia.edu)
     Digest: April 13, 1990, Issue #398

     Ingredients:

                    1/2 pound   crystal malt
                    3.3 pounds  unhopped amber extract
                    3.3 pounds  unhopped light extract
                    1-1/2 ounce Northern Brewers hops (boil)
                    1/4 ounce   Cascade hops (finish)
                                Whitbread ale yeast

     Comments:

     This produced a wonderful beer, except that it was just too sweet  for
     my likings.  I shouldn't complain too much, all my friends thought  it
     was  great!   I tried several variation of this, and  all  worked  out
     well,  but  were too sweet for me.  Several people  suggested  cutting
     back  on  the crystal and I may try that.  I have also  tried  sing  a
     lager yeast to create a steam beer.

     Ingredients:

             1 can        Alexanders Sun Country pale malt extract
             3.3 pounds   Northwestern Amber malt extract
             1/2 pound    dark crystal malt
             3 ounces     CFJ-90 Fresh hops
             1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
                          ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Start grains in brewpot with cool water.  Remove when boil  commences.
     Add  malt extract and 1-1/2 ounce of hops.  Boil 1 hour.   Strain  out
     boiling hops and add 1/2 ounce more hops and Irish moss.  Boil 5  min-
     utes.   Remove from heat and add another 1/2 ounce of hops.  Steep  10
     minutes and cool.  Strain wort into primary fermenter with cold  water
     to make 5 gallons.  Add final 1/2 ounce of hops.

     Comments:

     Water was filtered with a simple activated carbon system.  This  seems
     to  make a big difference. Amateur judge commented, "Beautiful  color.
     A bit under carbonated.  Great hop nose and finishes very clean.  Good
     balance with malt and hops, but lighten up on finishing hops a bit and
     it's perfect. Very marketable."

                               The Drive Pale Ale

     Author: Dave Baer (dsbaer@Sun.COM)
     Digest: February 13, 1989, Issue #73

     Ingredients:

                6.6 pounds  light, unhopped malt extract
                5 pounds    light dry malt extract
                2 cups      corn sugar
                3/4 cup     medium crystal malt
                1/4 cup     black patent malt
                3-3/4 ounce Cascade hops pellets (4.4 alpha)
                1-1/5 ounce Willamette hops pellets (4.0 alpha)
                            Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This  is  a 10-gallon recipe; cut ingredients in half for  5  gallons.
     Steep  grains  in  a mesh bag until  water  reaches  boiling.   Remove
     grains.  Follow standard extract brewing process, adding  extract  and
     Cascade  hops.  I boiled the wort in an 8-gallon pot and added 4  gal-
     lons  of  cold water.  Pitch yeast at about 80 degrees.   I  fermented
     this  in a 20-gallon open container for 4 days, then racked  to  glass
     carboys for 24 days.

     Comments:

     This  is a pale ale recipe I used for my class.  I used M&F  pale  ex-
     tract  and grains were for demonstration more than flavor.  I  suggest
     doubling grain quantities if you want to get something out of them.

                                Killer Party Ale

     Author: A.E. Mossberg (aem@mthvax.miami.edu)
     Digest: March 7, 1989, Issue #95

     Ingredients:

                2 cans      Pilsner/Lager or American light malt
                15 cups     corn sugar
                2 jars      Lyle's golden syrup (22 oz.)
                2-1/2 ounce Hallertauer hops
                2 pounds    flaked maize
                1 pack      BrewMagic
                            yeast

     Procedure:

     In 1 gallon water, boil malt, golden syrup, sugar and 1-1/2 ounce hops
     for  8 minutes.  Add remaining hops and boil another 2  minutes.  Pour
     into primary fermenter with 2 gallons water.  Bring another gallon  of
     water  to a boil and add flaked maize.  Turn off heat and 1/3 pack  of
     BrewMagic.   Let sit 10 minutes.  Add another 1/3 pack  of  BrewMagic.
     Let  sit  10 more minutes.  Strain maize into primary  fermenter,  and
     rinse with cold water.  Discard maize.  Fill primary to 5 gallon mark.

     Comments:

     This recipe comes from Craig McTyre at Wine & Brew By You.  The Lyle's
     syrup  is available in many grocery stores, usually located  near  the
     pancake syrup.  BrewMagic is some sort of yeast nutrient/additive.  It
     is available from Wine & Brew By You.

                                Summer Pale Ale


     Author: Jackie Brown  (Brown@MSUKBS.BITNET)
     Digest: April 24, 1989, Issue #134

     Ingredients:

                     8 pounds   2-row pale malt
                     1 pound    Munich malt
                     1/2 cup    dextrin malt
                     1 teaspoon gypsum
                     20 grams   Nugget leaf hops (14 alpha)
                     15 grams   Brambling leaf hops
                     pinch      Irish moss
                     1 pack     Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Use  the standard temperature-controlled mash procedure  described  in
     Papazian.  Use a 30 minute protein rest at 122 degrees, 20 minutes  at
     152 degrees, and 20 minutes at 158 degrees.  Sparge with 4 gallons  of
     180  degree water.  Boil 1 hour with Nugget hops.  Add Irish  moss  in
     last  10  minutes.  Remove from heat and steep Brambling hops  for  15
     minutes.  Cool wort and pitch.

     Comments:

     This  ale  is light in color, but full-bodied.  If you want  an  amber
     color, add a cup of caramel malt.  I get a strong banana odor in  most
     of my ales (from the Edme I believe) which subsides after 2-3 weeks in
     the bottle.  If you don't have the capacity for 9 pounds of malt,  you
     could substitute some extract for the pale malt.  Just thinking  about
     this makes me want to speed home and have a cool one.

     Author: Doug Roberts  (roberts%studguppy@lanl.gov)
     Digest: March 15, 1990, Issue #378

     Ingredients:
                      8 pounds     Klages malt
                      1 pound      flaked barley
                      1/2 pound    toasted Klages malt
                      1/2 pound    Cara-pils malt
                      1-1/2 ounce  Perle hops (boil)
                      1/2 ounce    Willamette hops (finish)
                      1 teaspoon   gypsum
                      1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                      14 grams     Muntona ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  1/2 pound of Klages malt was toasted in a 350 degree oven for  10
     minutes.   The mash was done using  Papazian's  temperature-controlled
     method.   The  Perle hops equal 12.4 AAUs.  The  Willamette  hops  are
     added  after the boil, while chilling with an immersion chiller.   The
     yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup of 100 degree water.

     Comments:

     Perle pale was a beautiful light-golden ale, crisp yet full-bodied.

                                    Mild Ale

     Author: Darryl Richman  (darryl@ism.isc.com)
     Digest: March 5, 1990, Issue #371

     Ingredients:

                  5 pounds  Klages 2-row malt
                  4 pounds  mild malt
                  2 pounds  crystal malt (80L)
                  1/2 pound English pale malt
                  1/2 pound flaked barley
                  1/5 pound chocolate malt
                  1 ounce   Willamette leaf hops (5.9% alpha)
                  1/8 ounce Cascade leaf hops (6.7% alpha)
                  1/8 ounce Eroica leaf hops (13.4% alpha)
                  1/2 ounce Willamette leaf hops (finish)
                            yeast

     Procedure:

     Water  was treated with 2 gm each MgSO4, CaSO4, KCl, and  CaCO3.  Mash
     grains in 3 gallons of water at 134 degrees. Hold 120-125 degrees  for
     55 minutes, raise to 157 degrees for 55 minutes.  Raise to 172 degrees
     for 15 minutes. Sparge with 5-3/4 gallons water. Boil 15 minutes.  Add
     bittering  hops. Boil 55 minutes. Add finishing hops and boil  5  more
     minutes. Chill and pitch with Sierra Nevada or Wyeast Northern  White-
     shield yeast. Ferment and bottle or keg.

     Comments:

     This is the only beer I can make 10 gallons of on my stove. I mash and
     boil  5  gallons and then add 5 gallons of cooling water.  The  Wyeast
     makes this a beer a bit sweet and rich beyond its gravity. Emphasis is
     on  the  malt, with crystal and chocolate bringing up the  rear;  hops
     were noticeable, but not in the foreground.

                                 India Pale Ale

     Author: Todd Enders  (enders@plains.nodak.edu)
     Digest: April 19, 1990, Issue #402

     Ingredients:

             2-1/2     pounds pale malt
             5 ounces  crystal malt (80L)
             5.5 AAUs  bittering hops (1 ounce of 5.5% Willamette)
             1/2 ounce finishing hops (Willamette)
                       Wyeast #1028: London ale

     Procedure:

     This  is  a 2-gallon batch. Mash in 5 quarts 132 degrees  (140  degree
     strike heat). Adjust mash pH to 5.3. Boost temperature to 150 degrees.
     Mash 2 hours, maintaining temperature at 146-152 degrees.  Mash out  5
     minutes  at  168 degrees. Sparge with 2 gallons of 165  degree  water.
     Boil  90 minutes, adding hops in last hour. Add finishing hops 5  min-
     utes  before end of boil. Ferment at 70 degrees, 6 days in primary,  4
     days in secondary.

     Comments:

     If  you haven't tried mashing yet, you really should.  You  can  start
     small  and  grow  as equipment and funds permit.   Also,  by  starting
     small, you don't have a large sum invested in equipment if you  decide
     mashing isn't for you.

                            Decent Extract Pale Ale

     Author: Florian Bell  (florianb%tekred.cna.tek.com)
     Digest: February 11, 1989, Issue #72

     Ingredients:

                    7 pounds  Steinbart's amber ale extract
                    1 pound   cracked crystal malt
                    1/8 pound cracked roasted malt
                    2 ounces  Cascade or other strong hops
                    1/2 ounce Kent Goldings hops
                              yeast

     Procedure:

     Add cracked grains to 2 gallons cold water.  Bring to boil and prompt-
     ly strain out grains.  Add extract and Cascade hops.  Boil 30 minutes.
     Add Kent Goldings hops in last five minutes.

     Comments:

     This brew results in a chill haze, which I don't pay any attention  to
     since I don't care (I don't wash my windshield very often either) I am
     so  impressed  with this ale that I can't seem to make enough  of  it.
     can't seem to make enough of it.  This is a good pale ale, but not  an
     excellent pale ale.  It lacks sweetness and aroma.

     Author: Florian Bell  (florianb%tekred.cna.tek.com)
     Digest: April 19, 1989, Issue #132

     Ingredients:

                       3 pounds  pale malted barley
                       3 pounds  Blue Ribbon malt extract
                       2 ounces  Willamette hops
                       1/2 ounce Kent Goldings hops
                       1 pack    Red Star ale yeast
                       1 cup     corn sugar (priming)


     Procedure:

     Mash  the 3 pounds of plain malted barley using  the  temperature-step
     process for partial grain recipes described in Papazian's book.   Boil
     30 minutes, then add the Blue Ribbon extract (the cheap stuff you  get
     at the grocery store) Add Willamette hops and boil another 30 minutes.
     Add Kent Goldings in last 5 minutes.  When at room temperature,  pitch
     yeast.  Ferment at about 68 degrees using a 2-stage process.

     Comments:

     This turned out refreshing, light in body and taste, with a  beautiful
     head (I used 1 cup corn sugar in priming) goodness of the outcome.

                             Really Incredible Ale

     Digest: T. Andrews  (ki4pv!tanner@bikini.cis.ufl.edu)
     Author: August 11, 1989, Issue #225

     Ingredients:

                        5-7 pounds pale malt
                        3 pounds   crystal malt
                        2 pounds   wheat
                        2 ounces   Northern Brewer hops
                        1 ounce    Hallertauer hops
                        1/2 ounce  Cascade hops
                                   yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash  all grains together.  Add Northern Brewer at beginning of  boil.
     Boil 90 minutes.  During last 1/2 hour, add the Hallertauer hops.   In
     last 15 minutes add the Cascade.

     Comments:

     The wheat helps make a beer very suitable to a warm climate.  This has
     been  a hot summer; it has topped 100 degrees (in the  shade)  several
     times.

     Author: Fred Condo  (fredc@pro-humanist.cts.com)
     Digest: October 31, 1990, Issue #528

     Ingredients:

                  5 to 6 pounds Alexander's pale malt extract
                  1/2 pound     crystal malt, crushed
                  10 ounces     dextrose (optional)
                  1-1/4 ounces  Cascade hops (boil)
                  1/4 ounce     Cascade hops (finish)
                                Munton & Fison ale yeast
                                corn sugar for priming

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  malt and sparge twice.  Add extract and  dextrose  and
     bring  to  boil.  Add Cascade hops and boil 60 minutes.  In  last  few
     minutes  add remaining 1/4 ounce of Cascade (or dry hop, if  desired).
     Chill and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  really  shouldn't  be too highly carbonated.  This  is  a  well-
     balanced  brew with good maltiness and bitterness.  It was  good  when
     fresh, albeit cloudy, but this is okay in a pale ale.  After 2  months
     of  refrigeration,  it  is crystal clear  and  still  delicious!  (And
     there's only 1 bottle left.)  By the way, Munton & Fison yeast is very
     aggressive---fermentation can be done in 24-72 hours.  I hope you like
     this as much as I do.

     Author: Jeffrey Blackman  (blackman@hpihouz.cup.hp.com)
     Digest: October 31, 1990, Issue #528

     Ingredients:

                  10 pounds   English pale malt (DME) extract
                  4 ounces    Cascade hops pellets (boil)
                  2 ounces    Hallertauer hops pellets (finish)
                  4 teaspoons gypsum
                  2 packs     Edme ale yeast
                  1-1/2 cups  corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 10 gallons.  Bring 3 gallons of water to a boil. Add
     4  teaspoons of gypsum, four ounces of hops, and 10 pounds of the  DME
     extract.   Bring to boil.  Boil 45 minutes.  Add 2 ounces  of  Haller-
     tauer  hops in last 1 minute of boil.  Strain wort into  large  vessel
     containing  additional 7 gallons of water (we used a 55  gallon  trash
     can).  Allow wort to cool and siphon into 5-gallon carboys. Add yeast.

          Caveat Brewor:
          Trash  cans  are generally not  food-grade  plastic,  digest
          wisdom  calls for avoiding non-food-grade  plastic.   Brewer
          discretion is advised.
          -Ed.

     Comments:

     This is more hoppy than most of the Old Style/Schaefer persuasion seem
     to prefer.  If you think its too much, cut back.

                                    Bass Ale

     Author: Rob Bradley  (bradley@math.nwu.edu)
     Digest: October 31, 1990, Issue #528

     Ingredients:

                     6-7 pounds pale malt (2-row)
                     1 pound    crystal malt
                     1 pound    demarara or dark brown sugar
                     1 ounce    Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                     1 ounce    Fuggles hops (boil 30 min.)
                     1/2 ounce  Fuggles hops (finish)
                                ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This is an all-grain recipe---follow the instructions for an  infusion
     mash in Papazian, or another text. The Northern Brewer hops are boiled
     for  a full hour, the Fuggles for 1/2 hour, and the Fuggles  finishing
     hops  after the wort is removed from the heat, it is then  steeped  15
     minutes.

     Comments:

     I'm a hophead (as you may have guessed).  Purists may object to  brown
     sugar  in beer, but a careful tasting of Bass reveals brown  sugar  or
     molasses  in the finish---not as strong as in Newcastle, but  present.
     British  malt, in particular, can easily stand up to a bit  of  sugar,
     both in flavor and in gravity.

     Author: Gary Mason  (mason@habs11.enet.dec.com)
     Digest: November 2, 1990, Issue #529

     Ingredients:
              3 pounds   Munton & Fison light DME
              3 pounds   M&F amber DME
              1 pound    crystal malt
              2.6 ounces Fuggles hops (4.7% alpha= 12.22 AAU)
              1 ounce    Kent Goldings hops (5.9% alpha = 5.9 AAU)
              pinch      Irish moss
              1 pack     Brewer's Choice #1098 (British ale yeast)

     Procedure:

     Break seal of yeast ahead of time and prepare a starter solution about
     10  hours before brewing.

     Bring 2 gallons water to boil with crushed crystal malt.  Remove crys-
     tal  when boil starts.  Fill to 6 gallons and add DME.  After  boiling
     10 minutes, add Fuggles. At 55 minutes, add a pinch of Irish moss.  At
     58 minutes, add Kent Goldings.  Cool (I used an immersion chiller)  to
     about 80 degrees.  Pitch yeast and ferment for about a week.  Rack  to
     secondary for 5 days.  Keg.

     Comments:

     This  is based on Russ Schehrer's Carp Ale from the 1986 Zymurgy  spe-
     cial issue.  The beer has a light hops flavor and could use some  work
     on the mouth feel.  It is also a bit cloudy.

                             CHAPTER 2: PALE LAGER



     Lagers do not seem to be brewed by Homebrew Digest subscribers as much
     as other styles, probably because adequate refrigeration is not avail-
     able,  it takes longer to ferment and age, and the techniques are  not
     as straightforward as ale brewing.  Still, lagers are the  predominant
     styles  in many countries, such as the United States and  Germany,  so
     homebrewers  who want to emulate commercial beers usually  find  them-
     selves brewing lagers.

     Chapter 2 includes the pilsner style, as well as any of the  continen-
     tal or American style pale lagers.  The beer is typically brewed  from
     a  6-row malt and hopped with some of the more delicate hops, such  as
     Hallertauer or Saaz. Fermentation typically takes place at lower temp-
     eratures, around 40 degrees.

     For  more  information about the pale ale style,  see  David  Miller's
     Continental  Pilsner,  Fred Eckhardt's The Essentials of  Beer  Style,
     (both  available from the Association of Brewers), or one of the  gen-
     eral beer texts such as Michael Jackson's World Guide to Beer.

     Author: Doug Roberts  (dzzr@lanl.gov)
     Digest: January 16, 1991, Issue #566

     Ingredients:

                      7 pounds     light unhopped syrup
                      2 pounds     Cara-pils malt
                      2 pounds     light crystal malt
                      1 pound      extra rich crystal malt
                      1/2 ounce    Hallertauer (5.0% alpha)
                      1 ounce      Willamette (4.5 alpha)
                      1 teaspoon   salt
                      1 teaspoon   citric acid
                      1 teaspoon   yeast nutrient
                      1 tablespoon Irish moss
                                   Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash  cara-pils  and  crystal malt for 2 hours in  140  degree  water.
     Sparge  to  make 4 gallons.  Add syrup and Hallertauer hops.  Boil  60
     minutes,  adding  Irish moss in last 30 minutes.  Decant  to  primary,
     adding  enough water to make 5 gallons.  Add salt, citric acid,  yeast
     nutrient, and dry hop with Willamette hops.

     Comments:

     A  year or so ago I went to a party where the host had about  20  dif-
     ferent types of good beer.  One was a German malz bier that was  deli-
     cious!  It has a wonderful sweet, malty, full-bodied flavor.   Working
     on  the assumption that its body is achieved with dextrin and  crystal
     malt,  I cooked up this recipe.  The intent is to have all or most  of
     the dextrin and caramelized maltose remain after fermentation for  the
     malz taste and body.

     Digest: October 11, 1990, Issue #515
     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds     Klages malt
                     3 pounds     Vienna malt
                     6 ounces     pearl barley
                     1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer leaf hops
                     1/2 ounce    Hallertauer hops (finish)
                                  Wyeast #2206

     Procedure:

     Soak  the  pearl barley overnight in the refrigerator, mix it  into  a
     starchy  glue using a blender. Mash the pearl barley with the  grains.
     Boil 1-1/2 ounces of Hallertauer with the wort. Add 1/4 ounce of  fin-
     ishing hops in last 10 minutes and steep 1/4 ounce after boil is  com-
     plete.   Pitch  yeast  at about 76 degrees.

     I  put the fermenter in fridge for 23 days, then racked  to  secondary
     for another 49 days before bottling.

     Comments:

     This  is  a wonderful Munich-style lager that I would  like  to  think
     rivals Andechs (I aim high).

     Ingredients:

                     3.3 pounds Northwest malt extract
                     1 pound    light dry malt
                     1/2 pound  Munich malt
                     2 pounds   Klages malt
                     1 ounce    Hallertauer hops (5.1 alpha)
                     1/4 ounce  Nugget hops (11.0 alpha)
                     1 ounce    Hallertauer hops (finish)
                                Wyeast #2042: Danish

     Procedure:

     Start  yeast  ahead of time.  Mash Munich and Klages  malts  together.
     Sparge.   Add extract and boiling hops.  Boil one hour. Add  finishing
     hops.  Chill to 75-80 degrees.  Pitch yeast.  When airlock shows signs
     of  activity  (about 6 hours) refrigerator at 42 degrees.   After  one
     week, rack to secondary and ferment at 38 degrees for two more  weeks.
     Bottle or keg.

     Comments:

     This  beer  tastes great and is very clean.  There are,  however,  two
     things I will do next time: add more bitterness (perhaps 10-11  HBUs),
     and second, add more malt.

     Ingredients:

                7 pounds    cracked lager malt
                1250 mg     ascorbic acid
                3.3 pounds  light unhopped John Bull malt extract
                1-1/2 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets
                1 ounce     Talisman leaf hops
                1 teaspoon  Irish moss
                1 ounce     Willamette hops pellets
                            Red Star lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Add grain to 2-1/2 gallons 170 degree water giving initial heat of 155
     degrees.   Maintain  temperature for two hours.  Sparge and  add  malt
     extract. Bring to boil.  Add Northern Brewer hops, Talisman hops,  and
     Irish  moss in last 20 minutes of boil.  Dry hop with Willamette  pel-
     lets and cool.  Add water to make 5 gallons and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Higher  gravity  than previous recipe (B.W. Lager) reflecting  a  more
     effective  mash. On day 2 of ferment the bubbler got clogged  and  was
     replace  with blow tube. The resulting beer was fairly amber, not  too
     sweet, with a certain dryness in the aftertaste.

     Digest: November 21, 1990, Issue #541

     Ingredients:
                      3.3 pounds plain light malt extract
                      2.2 pounds maltose
                      3/4 ounce  Cascade hops (boil)
                      3/4 ounce  Cascade hops (finish)
                                 yeast, cultured from a
                                 Sierra Nevada bottle

     Procedure:

     The maltose is a cheap rice-malt mix obtainable from oriental markets.
     Boil malt, hops, and maltose in 2-1/2 gallons of cold water.  In  last
     2  minutes,  add the finishing hops.  The yeast was  cultured  from  a
     bottle of Sierra Nevada pale ale.  By the next day, the yeast did  not
     seem  to start, so I added a packet of Vierrka  lager yeast.  Rack  to
     secondary after one week.  After another week, prime with 3/4 cup corn
     sugar and bottle.

     Comments:

     Color similar to any American lager.  Tastes much better, very mellow.
     The goal was to brew 5 gallons of beer while only spending $10.   This
     came  to about $11.  I'm not sure what drives me to  such  frugalness,
     but having grown up with American beer, sometimes I would rather  have
     it with certain foods, like pizza.

                   CHAPTER 3: WHEAT, STEAM AND RAUCHBIER



     Wheat  beers, steam beers, and rauchbier have no more in  common  than
     stout and lambic, yet they are grouped because each is specialty style
     of interest to digest subscribers, yet none is brewed so often that  a
     significant number of recipes exist in the digest archives.

     The  wheat beer style includes both the weisse, common in Berlin,  and
     the weizen, common in Munich.  Weisse is the lighter of the two,  with
     lower starting gravities and a lower wheat to barley ratio  (typically
     1 to 4).  Weizen is a fuller-bodied brew and will often contain  equal
     portions of wheat and barley malt.  Hallertauer is often the predomin-
     ant  hops choice for wheat beer, but homebrewers regularly  experiment
     with  traditionally English hops (such as Willamette) or some  of  the
     younger  U.S.  strains.  Steam beer is fermented with lager  yeast  at
     warmer temperatures, and rauchbier shows a hint of smoke, derived from
     either adjuncts such as Wright's Liquid Smoke, or from barbecuing  the
     malted barley.

     For  more  information  about these styles, see  Fred  Eckhardt's  The
     Essentials  of  Beer Style, (both available from  the  Association  of
     Brewers),  or one of the general beer texts such as Michael  Jackson's
     World Guide to Beer.

     Digest: February 16, 1990, Issue #359

     Ingredients:

                        6 pounds  Williams wheat extract
                        1 pound   crystal malt
                        1/2 pound toasted barley
                        1 pound   honey
                        2 ounces  Cascades hops (boil)
                        1/2 ounce Cascades hops (finish)
                        1 package Wyeast wheat yeast

     Procedure:

     Make  a  2-quart starter before brewing.  Steep  crystal  and  toasted
     barley in 4 gallons water for 40 minutes (use grain bags to make  this
     easier).   Add  extract, honey and bittering hops.  Boil  wort  for  1
     hour.   Remove  from heat.  Add finishing hops and  steep  2  minutes.
     Chill and pitch yeast.  After 3 days, rack to secondary.  Bottle after
     8 days.

     Comments:

     This  beer was a bit cloudy and should have some Irish moss.  I'm  not
     really sure what the honey added to this beer (more experimentation is
     in order).  However, it turned out so well that I won't omit it in the
     future. This was a very good extract-based recipe (it well nigh  evap-
     orated).

     Digest: January 31, 1990, Issue #348

     Ingredients:

                6 pounds  light dry malt extract
                1/2 pound toasted malt
                3/4 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets (boil)
                1/4 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets (finish)
                1 pack    lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Toast grains on cookie sheet in 350 degree oven for about 10  minutes.
     Crush  malt as you would grain.  Put in 1-1/2 gallons water and  bring
     to boil.  Strain out grain.  Add extract and boiling hops.  In last  2
     minutes  of  boil add finishing hops.  Add to enough water to  make  5
     gallons and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     I've  made  many variations of steam beer, but simple ones  like  this
     seem  to turn out best, not to mention being easy to make.  I  usually
     use more Northern Brewer than this, but then nobody will eat my  chili
     either.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds        light dry extract
                     1-1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke
                     1-1/2 ounce     Tettnanger hops (boil)
                     1 ounce         Tettnanger hops (finish)
                     1/2 teaspoon    Irish moss
                     2 packs         Red Star lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  extract, liquid smoke, and boiling hops in 2-3 gallons of  water
     for  45  minutes.  Add Irish moss and finishing hops and boil  5  more
     minutes.   Strain  into fermenter, add cold water to make  5  gallons,
     pitch  yeast.   After 3 days rack to secondary.  Allow to  ferment  an
     additional 3-4 weeks.

     Comments:

     This is basically a nice light beer, but with a definite smoke  after-
     taste. Mainstream, but with a non-commercial twist.

                            Anchor Steam-Style Amber

     Author: Clay Phipps  (hplabs!garth!phipps)
     Digest: June 21, 1990, Issue #444

     Ingredients:

                7 pounds John Bull plain light malt extract
                1/4-1/2  pound crystal malt
                2 ounces Northern Brewer hops (11 alpha) (boil)
                1 ounce  Cascade hops (5.6 alpha) (finish)
                2 packs  lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Pour  1 gallon water into brewpot.  Crush grains and add  to  brewpot.
     Bring  to  boil.  Remove grains.  Add malt extract.  Add  1/3  of  the
     boiling  hops.   After  20 minutes, add another 1/3  of  hops.   After
     another  20 minutes add the last 1/3 of hops.  After another  20  min-
     utes,  remove from heat and add finishing hops.  Cover wort.   Pour  3
     gallons  cold water into fermenter.  Strain wort into fermenter  along
     with enough water to make 5-1/2 gallons.  Pitch yeast and put in blow-
     off tube or airlock.

     Comments:

     This  recipe was offered in 1986 by the now-defunct Home Brewer   shop
     in  San  Jose, California, as the best approximation to  Anchor  Steam
     possible with home-brew-scale extract brewing.

     Author: Darryl Richman  (darryl@ism780c.isc.com)
     Digest: June 26, 1989, Issue #186


     Ingredients:

                     14 pounds wheat malt
                     8 pounds  Munich malt
                     6 pounds  2-row malt
                     90 grams  Hersbrucker hops (3.4% alpha)
                     10 grams  calcium carbonate
                               Sierra Nevada yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 15-gallon batch.  Our beer was 50% malted wheat, 30% Munich,
     and  20% 2-row malt.  Medium soft water was used with the addition  of
     10 grams CaCO4.  Mash with 1-1/4 gallons water per pound of grain with
     rests  at 120 degrees (1-1/2 hours), 135 degrees for 45  minutes,  148
     degrees for 30 minutes, and 156 degrees until converted.  172  degrees
     for 15 minutes.  We took our time with the sparge: 20 minutes to  set-
     tle  in  the lauter tun, at least 30 minutes of recycling,  and  1-1/2
     hours  to  sparge.   We cut it off at a gravity of  1.015  because  we
     weren't getting sweetness, just grainy notes.

     Comments:

     The  hot break in the boil was the most unbelievable thing  I've  ever
     seen.   It looked like egg drop soup.  We took out a sight  glass  and
     grabbed a bit and the flocks were huge---as much as 1/2 inch in  diam-
     eter.

     Author: Steve Conklin  (...!uunet!ingr!b11!conk!steve)
     Digest: December 8, 1989, Issue #319

     Ingredients:

                6 pounds     William's Weizenmalt syrup
                2 pounds     dark DME
                2-3/4 pounds buckwheat honey
                1 pound      crushed crystal malt
                1/4 pound    crushed chocolate malt
                2-1/2 ounces Cascade hops (boil)
                1-1/2 ounces Hallertauer hops 3.6 alpha (boil)
                3/4 ounce    Hallertauer hops (finish)
                4 teaspoons  whole allspice
                1 teaspoon   Irish moss
                             yeast
                2/3 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Steep grains in 2 gallons water while heating to boil.  Remove grains.
     Add extracts and honey.  Boil 1 hour with boiling hops, add 1 teaspoon
     Irish   moss at 30 minutes.  Simmer allspice in water for  3  minutes,
     remove  allspice  and add water to primary.  After  fermenting,  prime
     with corn sugar and bottle.

     This  beer turned out very well.  It has just a hint of  the  allspice,
     more  in the aroma than the flavor, and is quite sweet tasting.  There
     is  a slight bitter hops aftertaste, but I think that if it  were  any
     less bitter, the sweetness would be overpowering.  This beer will bring
     color to your cheeks.  The spice can be omitted with no great loss.

                                  Wheat Amber

     Author: Marc San Soucie  (wang!mds@uunet.UU.NET)
     Digest: July 1, 1989, Issue #191

     Ingredients:

                  1 can     Kwoffit Bitter kit (hopped extract)
                  3 pounds  light dry malt extract
                  1 pound   crystal malt
                  1/2 pound wheat malt
                            Fuggles leaf hops
                            Kwoffit yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  the crystal and wheat malts.  Boil the resulting  mixture  with
     the Kwoffit kit and the light extract.  Add a small amount (up to  1/2
     ounce) of the Fuggles hops in the last minute of the boil.

     Comments:

     The  result  is  extravagantly  tasty---very  rich  and   full-bodied,
     strongly hopped but not tart.  I am quickly becoming a believer in the
     value  of a little wheat malt for adding flavorful body.  It seems  to
     work very well with crystal malt.  Body, crispness, sweetness,  hoppi-
     ness...heaven.

     Procedure:

     Steep toasted and crystal malts.  Boil wort with hops for 45  minutes.

                          CHAPTER 4: STOUT AND PORTER



     Stout and porter are the most popular styles of beer brewed by  digest
     subscribers,  as evidenced by the number of recipes in  this  chapter.
     Porter  is the older of the two styles, dating back to the early  18th
     century.  It is a dark---almost black---brew characterized by a  roast
     barley  flavor and a fairly high hopping rate. It is typically  brewed
     to  a  starting gravity of about 1.050. Stout is a  thicker,  heartier
     version  of porter that is usually placed in either a dry or  a  sweet
     subcategory.  The sweet stout typically contains unfermentable sugars,
     such  as  lactose, added. Russian Imperial  stouts  are  significantly
     heavier and stronger than either of the other two substyles.   Typical
     stouts are brewed to a starting gravity of about 1.060 while  Imperial
     stouts are brewed to starting gravities in excess of 1.100.

     For  more  information  about these styles, see  Fred  Eckhardt's  The
     Essentials  of  Beer Style, (both available from  the  Association  of
     Brewers),  or one of the general beer texts such as Michael  Jackson's
     World Guide to Beer.

                                 Oatmeal Stout

     Author: Patrick Stirling  (pms@sfsun.West.Sun.COM)
     Digest: January 29, 1991, Issue #572

     Ingredients:

                         8 pounds  amber malt extract
                         1/2 pound black patent malt
                         1/2 pound roast barley
                         1/2 pound chocolate malt
                         1 pound   steel cut oats
                         2 ounces  Eroica hops (boil)
                         1 ounce   Fuggles hops (finish)
                                   Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Crack all grains (except oats), add to 2 gallons cold water, add oats,
     bring to boil.  Remove grains with strainer when boil is reached.  Add
     malt  extract and boiling hops.  Boil 60 minutes. Add  finishing  hops
     and  boil another minute or so.  Remove from heat, let steep  15  min-
     utes. Put 4-6 inches of ice in bottom of plastic fermenter and  strain
     wort into fermenter.  Sparge.  Bring volume to 5-1/4 gallons and  mix.
     The  temperature  should now be below 80 degrees.  Rack  to  6  gallon
     glass carboy and pitch yeast.  Bottle when fermentation is done (about
     2-3 weeks).

     Comments:

     I  really liked this beer!  Dark and smooth with a creamy mouth  feel.
     No specific oatmeal flavor, but lots of body.  Light brown head.   The
     only  problem  I had was that after about 3 months in  the  bottle  it
     developed  a distinct off flavor.  Could be from the ice, or maybe  it
     got oxygenated during bottling.

                                Mackeson's Stout

     Author: Marty Albini  (hplabs!hpsd139!martya)
     Digest: September 1, 1989; Issue #244

     Ingredients:

                          5 pounds    pale malt
                          1/2 pound   crystal malt
                          1/2 pound   roast black malt
                          1 pound     soft brown sugar
                          1-3/4 ounce Fuggles hops
                                      ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Treat  the  water with 1/4 ounce of magnesium sulfate and 1  ounce  of
     common  salt.  Crush all grains and mash in 2 gallons of water at  165
     degrees  for 2 hours.  Sparge with 2 gallons of 170 degree  water.   A
     few  drops of caramel may be added at this stage if proper  color  has
     not been sufficiently achieved.  Boil 1-1/2 hours with hops and sugar.
     Bring  to  5 gallons, pitch yeast when at correct  temperature.   This
     recipe can be brewed at an O.G. of 1.045 by  adding 1/4 pound of  dark
     extract.   May  also  add 1/4 pound of lactose in boil  to  provide  a
     slightly higher gravity and a sweeter palate.

     Comments:

     This recipe is based on one presented by Bob Pritchard in his book All
     About  Beer.   He also advocates adding saccharine.  In  digest  #245,
     Doug Roberts said that he made this beer and did not like the results.
     He  said, "I will never again make a batch with brown sugar as an  in-
     gredient  (a  little honey or molasses, perhaps, but  not  caramelized
     refined sugar).  The recipe absolutely no resemblance to thick,  rich,
     sweet Mackeson.  It was a thin, cidery sorry imitation."

     Method:            Full mash (infusion)

     Author: Marty Albini  (hplabs!hpsd139!martya)
     Digest: September 1, 1989, Issue #244

     Ingredients:

                     4 pounds     dark malt extract
                     2 pounds     soft brown sugar
                     8 ounces     gravy browning (caramel)
                     1-3/4 ounces Fuggles hops
                                  ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  hops in 20 pints of water for 1 hour.  Strain and  dissolve  ex-
     tract,  caramel and sugar.  Boil for 15 minutes.  Bring to 5  gallons,
     pitch yeast at correct temperature.

     As  in the previous recipe, this can be brought to a gravity of  1.045
     by increasing the extract by 1/4 pound, and lactose may also be added.
     A few drops of  caramel may be added at this stage if sufficient color
     has not been achieved. Saccharine can be added at bottling to increase
     apparent sweetness.

     Comments:

     I  haven't  tried  either of these, and I'm not  about  to  go  adding
     saccharin to my beer, so you're on your own from here.

                                  Basic Stout

     Author: Marc San Soucie  (mds@wang.wang.com)
     Digest: August 3, 1989, Issue #219

     Ingredients:

                   6-8 pounds   dark malt extract
                   1/2-1 pound  roasted barley
                   1/2-1 pound  black patent malt
                   3-4 ounces   bittering hops (e.g., Bullion)
                   small amount aromatic hops (optional)
                                ale yeast

     Procedure:

     To  these skeleton ingredients I add other adjuncts, or remove  things
     if  the wind blows from the south.  A nice beer is made by using  only
     dark malt and black patent malt.  A good strong bittering hops is key;
     Bullion is lovely, as are Nugget or Chinook.

     There  are no appreciable differences between making stouts and  other
     ales,  save the larger quantities of grain. Beware of 9-pound  batches
     as these can blow the lids off fermenters.

     Comments:

     There are scads of other additives that can lobbed into a stout  with-
     out damaging it.  Almost anything works when making stout, but  match-
     ing your own taste preference is a matter of experimentation.  Be pre-
     pared  though to give up drinking commercial bottled  stouts,  because
     frankly, nothing can match the taste of homemade.

                            Crying Over Spilt Stout

     Author: Darryl Richman  (darryl@ism.isc.com)
     Digest: August 4, 1989, Issue #220

     Ingredients:

                       22 pounds  Klages 2-row malt
                       2 pounds   roasted barley
                       2 pounds   flaked barley
                       1/2 pound  chocolate malt
                       4-5 ounces high alpha hops
                                  (e.g., 4-1/4 ounce of 10% alpha Eroica)
                                  yeast

     Procedure:

     This  recipe makes 15 gallons. Give the beer a lot of temporary  hard-
     ness (e.g., lots of
     carbonate).

     Comments:

     I  would not leave flaked barley out of a stout.  This is  what  gives
     Guinness  its  creamy white head and rounds out the body.   This  beer
     will  have a rich creamy body with a balanced bitterness.  It is  very
     dark,  but not opaque.  It makes a great substitute for  your  morning
     coffee. The name refers to a huge tragedy.  I was filling carboys  and
     rocking  them to knock down the head.  I must have rolled one  over  a
     pebble  because  there  came a distinct click noise  and  beer  poured
     everywhere.

     Digest: August 9, 1989, Issue #223

     Ingredients:

                 3.3 pounds John Bull dark extract
                 3.6 pounds light Australian dry malt
                 1 pound    black patent malt (coarsely crushed)
                 2 ounces   Cascade hops
                 1/2 ounce  Tettnanger hops
                 1 ounce    Tettnanger hops (finish)
                 1 pack     Edme ale yeast
                            3/4 cup corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Add  crushed black patent malt to 1-1/2 gallons cold water.  Bring  to
     boil.  (This recipe was made by boiling malt for 10 minutes,  however,
     conventional  wisdom  is to avoid boiling whole grains).   Strain  out
     malt.   Add extract and dry malt and Cascade and 1/2 ounce  Tettnanger
     hops.  Boil 60 minutes.  Add finishing hops and boil 1 minute.  Remove
     from  heat  and  steep 1-2 minutes.  Sparge into  3-1/2  gallons  cold
     water.  Cool and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This recipe was modified from Papazian's "Sparrow Hawk Porter" and won
     first place at the Santa Clara County Fair.

                          Mackeson Triple Stout Clone

     Author: Doug Roberts  (dzzr@lanl.gov)
     Digest: August 15, 1989, Issue #229

     Ingredients:

                    7 pounds        Australian light syrup
                    1 pound         chocolate malt, cracked
                    1-1/2 pound     black patent malt
                    12 ounces       crystal malt, cracked
                    12 ounces       lactose
                    2 ounces        Kent Goldings leaf hops
                    1 teaspoon      salt
                    1 teaspoon      citric acid
                    2-1/2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                                    ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  syrup and enough water to make 3 gallons to boil.  Add  crystal
     malt.   Boil 10 minutes.  Add hops.  Boil 5 minutes.  Turn  off  heat.
     Add  chocolate and black patent malt in grain bag.  Steep 10  minutes.
     Sparge  grain bag with 2 gallons boiling water.  Add  lactose.   Pitch
     yeast and ferment.  When bottling, prime with malt extract.

     Comments:

     It  took me three tries, but I finally got a batch that was closer  to
     the original Mackeson sweet stout than I could have hoped for.  It was
     wonderful!   After  aging about three months, it  was  as  wonderfully
     smooth, dark, and sweet as the real Mackeson.  Maybe better.

     Ingredients were obtained from Great Fermentations.

                                 Oatmeal Stout

     Author: Patrick Stirling  (pms@Corp.Sun.COM)
     Digest: September 11, 1990, Issue #493

     Ingredients:

                        8 pounds  British amber extract
                        1/2 pound black patent malt
                        1/2 pound roasted barley
                        1/2 pound chocolate malt
                        1 pound   steel cut oats
                        2 ounces  Eroica hops (boil)
                        1 ounce   Fuggles hops (finish)
                                  Whitbread ale yeast
                        1/2 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Crack  grains  using a rolling pin.  Add grain and oats to  2  gallons
     cold  water.   Bring  to boil.  Strain out grains.   Add  extract  and
     Eroica hops.  Boil about 1 hour.  Add Fuggles and boil an additional 2
     minutes.   Steep  15 minutes.  Sparge through sieve  over  ice.   Mix.
     Rack to 7-gallon carboy and pitch yeast.  Bottle when fermentation  is
     complete (about 1 week).

     Comments:

     This  was  one of my best beers yet.  Black, smooth and  creamy.   The
     oatmeal  doesn't add a very pronounced flavor; I think it rather  con-
     tributes  to  the creaminess and smoothness, which  is  becoming  more
     pronounced as the beer ages.  It has a fairly dark brown head, presum-
     ably from roasted barley---creamy with small bubbles.

     This recipe was derived from several posted by Jay H. in digest #459.

     Author: Glenn Colon-Bonet  (gcb@hpfigcb.hp.com)
     Digest: May 4, 1990, Issue #412

     Ingredients:

                   6 pounds     Klages 2-row pale malt
                   1/2 pound    Dextrin malt
                   1-1/8 pound  rolled oats
                   1/2 pound    crystal malt
                   1/2 pound    chocolate malt
                   1/4 pound    roasted barley
                   1 ounce      Clusters boiling hops (7.4 alpha)
                   1/2 ounce    Cascade hops
                   10 ounces    lactose
                   1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                                Wyeast #1007: German ale

     Procedure:

     Mash  in  3 quarts cold water.  Raise temperature to 153  degrees  and
     hold  until  iodine test indicates complete conversion.   Transfer  to
     lauter tun and sparge to yield 7 gallons.  Boil 1 hour, adding boiling
     hops.  Add finishing hops and Irish moss in last 10 minutes.   Sparge,
     cool and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     Very smooth, silky mouth feel.  Great flavor, nice sweetness with mild
     roasted  malt  flavors.  Somewhat thin for style.  Will use  ale  malt
     next  time.   Could also use more dextrin and pale malt  and  possibly
     mash at higher temperature.  Overall, a very nice beer!

     Author: Rob Bradley  (bradley@dehn.math.nwu.edu)
     Digest: May 15, 1990, Issue #417

     Ingredients:

                      5-1/2 pounds 2-row pale malt
                      1 pound      caramel malt
                      1/4 pound    chocolate malt
                      1/4 pound    black patent malt
                      4-1/2 pounds diastatic malt extract
                      2-1/2 ounces Fuggles hops
                      1/4 ounce    Chinook hops
                      1 teaspoon   Irish moss
                                   Leigh Williams Yeast
                                   Pasteur champagne yeast
                      1/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This will yield about 3-1/2 gallons at a density of 1106. Mash  grains
     using  infusion method for about 1 hour. Boil two hours with all  hops
     added---that's  right,  no finishing hops.  Cool  and  pitch  Williams
     yeast.   Ferment  for 4 days then rack to glass jugs.  Rack  again  on
     24th  day.   Add  champagne  yeast.  Let  ferment  another  4  months.
     Bottle.

     Comments:

     After two years this beer showed a little oxidation, but by and  large
     it was till in excellent shape.  Viscous and black with light carbona-
     tion  and a fine-beaded medium-brown head, it still had good  balance,
     although  the hop bitterness had faded with time to give  predominance
     to the dark malts.  It was bittersweet and almost unbelievably long in
     the finish.

     Ingredients:

              2 cans       Munton & Fison stout kit
              3 pounds     Munton & Fison extra dark dry malt extract
              2 cups       chocolate malt
              2 cups       black patent malt
              2 cups       roasted barley
              3 ounces     Fuggles hops (boil)

                           ale yeast
              1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
              3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Steep  whole  grains  in 6 cups of water and bring  to  boil.   Remove
     grains at boil.  Add extract and boiling hops. Boil 1 hour. Add  Irish
     moss  in  last 15 minutes. After boil, add Cascade hops and  steep  15

     Comments:

     This recipe was developed by Doug Hinderks, president of the  Northern
     Ale  Stars  Homebrewers Guild. The recipe was used as  the  basis  for
     "Ursa  Stout," which follows.  Ursa differs in the addition  of  pale,
     crystal, and dextrin malts in place of some of the dry extract.

     Author: rogerl@Think.COM
     Digest: March 15, 1989, Issue #101

     Ingredients:

               2 cans       Munton & Fison stout kit
               2 pounds     Munton & Fison light dry malt extract
               1 pound      crushed pale malt
               1 pound      crushed crystal malt
               1/2 pound    dextrin malt
               2 cups       chocolate malt
               2 cups       black patent malt
               2 cups       roast barley
               2 ounces     Fuggles hops pellets (boil)
               1-2 ounce    Willamette leaf hops (finish)
               2 packs      M&F stout yeast
               1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
               3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash grains in 1-2 gallons of water.  Sparge with enough water to  end
     with 2-3 gallons in pot.  Bring to boil.  Stir in extract and bring to
     boil.  Add boiling hops.  Boil 40 minutes.  Add Irish moss in last  15
     minutes.   At  end of boil, add aromatic hops and  steep  15  minutes.
     Sparge  into  primary with enough water to make 6 gallons.   Cool  and
     pitch yeast.  Rack to secondary when initial blow off subsides.  Prime
     and bottle about a month later.

     Comments:

     This brew is so dark I think the Irish moss may be superfluous.   This
     was the most active brew I've had in a while.  Expect to use some sort
     of  blow  off method for primary and then rack to  secondary  with  an
     airlock.   Very  black!   Thick, but not as much  as  Guinness.   Well
     rounded flavor and smooth with almost no bite.  Very dark head.  Maybe
     using less roast barley and a bit more black patent would lighten  the
     head and keep the body from suffering.  Everybody who tasted it really
     like it.  I do believe I've found my house stout.

     Ingredients:
                  1 can     Munton & Fison dark hopped extract
                  1/2 can   Edme bitters kit
                  1 stick   brewers licorice
                  1/2 pound toasted barley
                  1 pound   flaked barley
                  2 ounces  Cascade hops pellets
                  1 ounce   Northern Brewer hops pellets
                            Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Make toasted barley into a tea.  Bring flaked barley to boil.   Sparge
     with  kitchen strainer and boiling water.  Boil extracts  and  Cascade
     hops.  Add Northern Brewer.  Cool and Pitch.

     Comments:

     This  makes what I consider to be an excellent  porter.   Fermentation
     seemed to take off and I bottled within 7 days of brewing.   Fermenta-
     tion took place at 74 degrees.

     Ingredients:

                  8 pounds     Munton & Fison 2-row pale malt
                  1-1/2 pounds crystal malt
                  1/4 pound    chocolate malt
                  1/4 pound    black patent malt
                  1/2 pound    flaked barley
                  1 ounce      Willamette hops (boil)
                  1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (boil)
                  1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                               yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash  grains. Add boiling hops and boil 90 minutes. Dry hop  with  1/2
     ounce Cascade.

     Comments:

     My  mash  temp  was too high, as I misjudged the  quantity  of  strike
     liquor  and the mash spent a lot of time in the 160-170  degree  range
     before  I brought it down to 154 degrees. Conversion was  good  (1.048
     for 5 gallons), but now after fermentation slowed to 1 bubble every  2
     minutes,  the gravity is 1.024. I suspect there's nothing I can do  to
     turn  this sweet porter into the dry porter I intended so my  question
     is,  "Is  there some style I can claim to have intended in  the  first
     place?"  I guess I need some level of plausible brewability.

                 Crankcase Stout: An Experiment in Extravagance

     Marc San Soucie  (hplabs!decvax!wang!mds)
     June 16, 1989, Issue #178

     Ingredients:

                 1 pound  crushed crystal malt
                 1 pound  crushed roasted barley
                 1-1/2    pounds crushed black patent malt
                 9 pounds Munton & Fison dark dry malt extract
                 1 can    John Bull dark hopped malt extract
                 2 inches brewers licorice
                 2 ounces Nugget leaf hops
                 2 ounces Galena leaf hops
                 1 ounce  Cascade hops
                 2 packs  Doric ale yeast
                 1 ounce  amylase enzyme

     Procedure:

     Put  grains into two gallons water and boil.  When pot  reaches  boil,
     remove  grains.   Add dry extract and stir.  Add  hopped  extract  and
     licorice.   Add Nugget and Galena hops. Boil 70 minutes.  This  was  a
     big  thick mess and needs a big pot---mine boiled over.   Add  Cascade
     for  finishing.   Cool  and pitch yeast and amylase.   Put  in  a  big
     fermenter  with  a  blow tube---my batch blew  the  cover  creating  a
     marvelous  mess all over the wall.  Eventually rack to  secondary  and
     ferment a long time (at least 3 weeks).

     Comments:

     Intimidating.   Heavy,  strong, thick.  Not really drinkable  after  4
     months.   Interesting, but not completely enjoyable.  Too much of  too
     many good things.

     Ingredients:

                    8 pounds     Klages 2-row malt
                    1 pound      Munich malt
                    1/2 pound    crystal malt (90L)
                    1/2 pound    chocolate malt
                    1/2 pound    black patent malt
                    1/2 pound    roasted barley
                    1/2 ounce    Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                    1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (boil)
                    1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                    1 teaspoon   gypsum
                    1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                    14 grams     Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  mash was done based on Papazian's temperature-controlled  method.
     The boiling hops used were Northern Brewer and Cascade, but other hops
     can  be  used, this recipe uses 10.75 AAUs.  The  finishing  hops  are
     added  after the boil and steep while cooling with an immersion  chil-
     ler.  The Irish moss is added in the last 20 minutes of the boil.  The
     yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup of 100 degree water.

     Comments:

     This was a marvelous bitter-sweet velvet black porter.

                               Black Cat Stout #1

     Author: Mark Stevens  (stevens@stsci.edu)
     Digest: February 1, 1990, Issue #349

     Ingredients:

                  6.6 pounds Munton & Fison dark extract syrup
                  1 pound    Munton & Fison dark dry extract
                  1/2 pound  black patent malt
                  3/4 pound  crystal malt
                  1/2 pound  roasted barley
                  1/2 cup    dark molasses
                  3/4 ounce  Willamette hops (boil)
                  3/4 ounce  Cascade hops (boil)
                  1 teaspoon vanilla
                  1/2 cup    French roast coffee
                  2 packs    Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Brew  a  pot  of coffee with 1/2 cup of  French  roast  coffee.  Steep
     specialty  grains  in water as it boils. Remove  grains.  Boil  malts,
     hops, and vanilla 60 minutes.  Strain wort into fermenter. Pour in pot
     of  coffee.  Add ice water to make 5 gallons. Pitch  yeast.   Rack  to
     secondary after 3 days. Bottle 23 days later.

     Comments:

     This stout turned out pretty tasty and the coffee flavor seems to come
     through  more in the aftertaste with the predominant flavor being  the
     dark  malts. I should probably have let it ferment in the secondary  a
     bit longer or not used anything for priming because I got a few  gush-
     ers  after  a couple months---but by then, most of the beer  was  gone
     anyway.

     Tom Hotchkiss  (trh@hpestrh.hp.com)
     February 6, 1989, Issue #352

     Ingredients:

                     3.3 pounds Edme SFX dark malt extract
                     3.3 pounds John Bull dark malt extract
                     2 pounds   amber dry malt extract
                     1 pound    crystal malt
                     1 pound    roasted barley
                     1 pound    chocolate malt
                     3/4 pound  black patent malt
                     1/2 stick  brewers licorice
                     2 ounces   Brewers Gold hops
                     2 ounces   Fuggles hops
                     1/2 pound  French roast coffee beans
                                Wyeast #1028: British ale

     Procedure:

     Steep  grains in water while heating. Remove grains just before  boil-
     ing.  During boil, add licorice and extract. Add 1 ounce  of  Brewer's
     Gold  for 60 minutes, 1 ounce for 45 minutes, and 1 ounce  of  Fuggles
     for 30 minutes. Cool wort and pitch yeast.  Add unground coffee  beans
     and  remaining  ounce  of Fuggles. The next day  skim  off  all  crud,
     including  coffee  beans and hops. One day later, rack  to  secondary.
     Ferment three weeks and bottle.

     Comments:

     Wyeast  #1028  does not seem to have high  attenuation,  causing  high
     final gravity.  After 1 month in bottles, the beer has low carbonation
     levels.  I like it this way!  The beer feels thick and sweet.  If  you
     want a good sweet stout, like Mackeson, this recipe with Wyeast  #1028
     is a good way to go.  This stuff is black!  When you pour a bottle, it
     sucks  all  the light out of the room...you have to drink  it  in  the
     dark.   Amazingly, there isn't much hops aroma and taste, but with  so
     many other flavors and aromas, you don't miss it.

     Ingredients:

                      3 pounds    2-row pale lager malt
                      10 ounces   black patent malt
                      8 ounces    wheat malt
                      4 pounds    Scottish light malt extract
                      12 AAUs     Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                      1 ounce     Fuggles hops (finish)
                      3 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                                  Edme ale yeast
                      1 teaspoon  gelatin finings
                      1/2 cup     corn sugar (priming)

     Mash-in 3 minutes in 6 quarts of water at 122 degree (strike heat  126
     degree).   Adjust  pH  to 5.0-5.5.  Protein rest  30  minutes  at  131
     degrees.   Starch conversion 60 minutes at 150-141 degrees (longer  is
     better).  Mash out 5 minutes at 168 degrees.  sparge with 2 gallons of
     water at 168-160 degrees.  Boil 60 minutes.  Add extract, yeast nutri-
     ent  and bittering hops at start of boil.  Add finishing hops 10  min-
     utes  before  boil ends.  Force cool and bring volume  to  5  gallons.
     Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     If  this  beer doesn't have enough body, you  might  try  substituting
     unmalted  barley for the wheat malt and extend starch conversion  rest
     to 2 hours.  Bitterness can be reduced by cutting back bittering  hops
     to 8 AAUs or so.

                      1/2 pound    amber dry malt
                      1/2 teaspoon gypsum
                      1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                      1/4 ounce    Fuggles hops plug
                                   yeast

     Procedure:

     This is a 2-1/2 gallon recipe.  Steep the grains 30 minutes in 1 quart
     of  150  degree  water.  Strain out grains and bring liquid  up  to  3
     quarts.  Add stout kit, amber malt, gypsum and boil 45 minutes.  After

     steep  Fuggles hops pellets for 4 minutes.  Strain into ice water  and
     pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  recipe  is  based on the Double Stout recipe  that  appeared  in
     Zymurgy magazine, but the quantities have been adjusted to make a half
     batch.

                              Partial Mash Porter

     Author: Martin Lodahl  (mal@pbmoss.pacbell.com)
     Digest: October 10, 1989, Issue #274

     Ingredients:

                       3 pounds  2-row pale lager malt
                       10 ounces black patent malt
                       6 ounces  crystal malt
                       4 pounds  Australian dark extract
                       11 AAUs   Northern Brewer hops
                                 Doric yeast
                       1/2 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash-in (6 quarts water) at 131-122 degrees, stir 3 minutes. Adjust pH
     to 5.0-5.5 (using calcium carbonate or gypsum).  Protein rest  131-120
     degrees for 30 minutes.  Starch conversion 155 degrees for 60 minutes.
     Mash out at 168 degrees for 5 minutes.  Sparge with 2 gallons of  168-
     160 degree water.  Bring liquid to boil and add extract and hops. Boil
     60 minutes.

     Comments:

     The result is sweet, but very tasty.  My next batch of porter will  be
     somewhat  drier,  tending toward stout.  Changes will include  a  less
     sweet extract (Scottish light), dropping the crystal malt  altogether,
     bumping  the bittering hops up a point, adding an ounce of Fuggles  10
     minutes  before  the  end of the boil for finish, and  going  to  Edme
     yeast,  which I believe to be more attenuative.  I'm also toying  with
     the  idea of adding 8 ounces of wheat malt to improve the head,  which
     is the only real defect this beer seems to have.

                                     Stout

     Author: Allen Hainer  (ajhainer@violet.waterloo.edu)
     Digest: October 18, 1989, Issue #281

     Ingredients:

                     8.8 pounds unhopped dark malt extract
                     1 pound    roasted barley
                     1 pound    wheat malt
                     1/2 pound  black patent malt
                     1/2 pound  chocolate malt
                     4 ounces   Bullion hops (boil)
                     1 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                                yeast

     Procedure:

     The  bullion hops are added 30 minutes into the bullion.  I used  pel-
     letized hops and there was a huge amount of sediment when I racked it-
     --not  sediment in the  normal sense---it was mostly beer  with   hops
     floating in  it, but it was too thick to go through the siphon.

     Comments:

     This is better than any stout
     I  have ever tasted.  It is based on the stout recipe posted  by  Marc
     San Soucie in Digest #219.

     Digest: November 4, 1989, Issue #296

     Ingredients:

                    8 pounds   American 6-row (Klages) malt
                    1 pound    Munich malt
                    1/2 pound  crystal malt (90L)
                    1/2 pound  black patent malt
                    1/2 pound  chocolate malt
                    1/2 pound  roasted barley
                    1 teaspoon calcium carbonate
                    1 ounce    Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                    1/2 ounce  Cascade hops (boil)
                    1/2 ounce  Cascade hops (finish)
                               Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Use  Papazian's  temperature-controlled mash  procedure.   Sparge  and
     boil.

     Comments:

     This  recipes is based on Papazian's Silver Dollar Porter.  I  suspect
     the  difference in quality between this batch and an extract batch  is
     going  to be the difference between fresh-brewed coffee  and  instant.
     The  wort had a much better hot and cold break than I've  ever  exper-
     ienced using extracts, and it tasted better too.

     Author: Marty Albini  (martya@hp-sdd@hplabs.csnet)
     Digest: November 8, 1989, Issue #298

     Ingredients:

                7 pounds        Australian light syrup
                1 pound         chocolate malt, cracked
                1-1/2 pounds    black patent, uncracked
                12 ounces       crystal malt, cracked
                12 ounces       lactose
                2 ounces        Kent Goldings hops (whole leaf)
                1 teaspoon      salt
                1 teaspoon      citric acid
                2-1/2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
                                yeast

     Procedure:

     Bring  the wort to boil (water and syrup to make 3  gallons),then  add
     crystal.   Boil 10 minutes, then add hops.  Boil 5 minutes.  Turn  off
     heat  and  add chocolate and black patent malt in a grain  bag.  Steep
     about  10  minutes. Sparge grain bag with about 2 gallons  of  boiling
     water. Add lactose. Chill and pitch. When fermented, try priming  with
     3/4 cup of light dry malt extract.

     Comments:

     This  is based on Doug Roberts' Mackeson Triple clone.  This  will  be
     lighter  than the real Mackeson's with a lighter head.   Very  similar
     aromas and head retention.  Overall a resounding success.  One or  two
     things  I'll do different next time: Reduce black patent malt  to  1/2
     cup (crushed), add a bit of dextrin to increase body, and maybe add  a
     touch  of roasted barley.  I recommend this to anyone who likes  their
     coffee strong, with cream and sugar.

     Author: Jim Broglio  (microsoft!jamesb@uunet.uu.net)
     Digest: December 29, 1989, Issue #334

     Ingredients:

                      6 pounds  dry amber extract
                      1 pound   crystal malt
                      1/2 pound roasted barley
                      1 pound   Quaker oats
                      1 ounce   Eroica hops (boil)
                      1 ounce   Kent Goldings hops(finish)
                      2 packs   Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     In two gallons of cold water, add crystal, barley, and oatmeal.  Steep
     until  water comes to boil.  Sparge with about 1 gallon of hot  water.
     Add  dry extract.  Bring to boil.  Add Eroica hops.  Boil 45  minutes.
     In  last 5 minutes of boil, add Kent Goldings hops.  Cool to about  75
     degrees.   Transfer to primary and pitch yeast.  Have a  homebrew  and
     wait.

     Comments:

     This is very lightly carbonated, but that I can live with.  Could  use
     more hops.  Smooth aftertaste.  Overall, I give it a thumbs up.

                             Original Oatmeal Stout

     Author: Jay Hersch  (75140.350@compuserve.com)
     Digest: July 14, 1990, Issue #459

     Ingredients:

                      6.6 pounds   John Bull dark extract
                      1-1/2 pounds plain dark extract
                      2 ounces     Bullion hops (boil)
                      1/2 pound    steel cut oats
                      7 grams      Muntona ale yeast
                                   Irish moss
                                   water crystals

     Procedure:

     This  is  the  first of a series of  experiments  in  brewing  oatmeal
     stouts. It is an extract brew, with any specialty grains (not in  this
     particular  recipe)  being added in the standard stovetop  method  and
     removed at boil. When grains are used, they are cracked with a rolling
     pin and boiled for 30 minutes before straining.

     Comments:

     These  recipes  rank among my best beers.  This one probably  had  the
     most  noticeable oat flavor of all the variations due to  the  balance
     between  the amount of malt and oats.  It had a nice deep  dark  head,
     opaque  color  and smooth creamy flavor.  I'd probably  use  an  Irish
     liquid ale yeast or Whitbread if I did this again.

                   3/4 pound    black patent malt
                   1/4 pound    roasted barley
                   1/2 pound    chocolate malt
                   1/2 pound    steel cut oats
                   7 grams      Muntona ale yeast
                   1/2 ounce    Fuggles hops (boil)
                   1 ounce      Hallertauer hops (boil)
                   1-1/2 ounces Cascade hops (finish)

                                water crystals

     Procedure:

     This  is  the  second of a series of experiments  in  brewing  oatmeal
     stouts.  It  is an extract brew, with specialty  grains   being  added
     using  the standard stovetop method and removed at boil.  When  grains
     are  used, they are cracked with a rolling pin and boiled for 30  min-
     utes  before  straining. The finishing hops are added in  the  last  5
     minutes of the boil.

     Comments:

     The  addition of grains made the oatmeal less noticeable.   Color  and
     hop  balance were good again.  Irish ale yeast could yield  some  nice
     results and I think the steel cut oats need to be bumped up to 1 pound
     to bring them to the fore.

     Author: Jay Hersch  (75140.350@compuserve.com)

     Ingredients:

                 1/2 pound  crystal or cara-pils malt

                 1 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                 1/2 ounce  Cascade hops (dry)
                 14 grams   Muntona ale yeast

                            water crystals

     Procedure:

     This  is  the  third of a series of  experiments  in  brewing  oatmeal
     stouts.   It is an extract brew, with specialty grains being added  in
     the standard stovetop method and removed at boil.  Grains are  cracked
     with  a rolling pin and boiled for 30 minutes before  straining.   The
     finishing  hops are added 5 minutes before the end of the  boil.   The
     dry hopping is done after 4 days in the primary.

     Comments:

     This turned out real fruity, probably because of the Alexander's.  Dry
     hopping  also helped, again the amount of steel oats to  other  grains
     was  too low.  To get opaqueness it was necessary to use at least  1-2
     pounds of dark malt extract; because I didn't do that, this ware  more
     of a brown ale in color and body.

     Author: Jay Hersch  (75140.350@compuserve.com)
     Digest: July 14, 1990, Issue #459

     Ingredients:

                1/2 pound  malt-dextrin
                2 ounces   Sticklbrackt hops (boil)
                1 ounce    Bullion hops (boil)
                1 ounce    Cascade hops (finish)
                1 ounce    Cascade hops (dry)
                14 grams   Whitbread ale yeast
                           Irish moss/water crystals

     Procedure:

     Last in the series of experiments in brewing oatmeal stouts.  It is an
     extract brew, with specialty grains being added in the standard stove-
     top method and removed at boil.  Grains are cracked with a rolling pin
     and  boiled  for 30 minutes before straining.   The  Sticklbrackt  are
     added  in  1/2 ounce batches at 20 minute intervals, the  Bullion  1/2
     ounce  at a time in between the Sticklbrackt.  The finishing hops  are
     added  5 minutes before the end of the boil.  The dry hopping is  done
     in the primary.

     Comments:

     Darker  and more astringent than the other recipes, also  more  boldly
     hopped  but still well-balanced due to the higher gravity.   A  little
     like Xingu or Mackesons with its residual sweetness.

                    CHAPTER 5: BOCK, DARK, AND  AMBER LAGER



     Dark  lagers must be seldom brewed by Homebrew Digest  subscribers  if
     posted  recipes are any indication of brewing frequency.  Still,  dark
     lagers  and bocks are important styles with a long  brewing  heritage,
     especially in Germany.

     This  chapter includes not only bock, but the dark beers of  Dortmund,
     Munich,  and  even amber beers such as Vienna or  Maerzenbier.   Lager
     beer is typically brewed from a 6-row malt and hopped with some of the
     more  delicate hops, such as Hallertauer or Saaz.  Darker colors  come
     from  specialty  malts such as crystal, black  patent,  or  chocolate.
     Starting gravities are typically in the 1.050 range with bocks in  the
     1.060 range.  (Dopplebocks are covered in another chapter.)  Fermenta-
     tion typically takes place at lower temperatures, around 40 degrees.

     For more information about dark lagers, see Fred Eckhardt's The Essen-
     tials  of Beer Style, (available from the Association of Brewers),  or
     one of the general beer texts such as Michael Jackson's World Guide to
     Beer.

     Digest: May 24, 1990, Issue #424

     Ingredients:

                    4 pounds     pale malt
                    3 pounds     light dry extract
                    1/2 pound    crystal malt (40L)
                    2 ounces     chocolate malt
                    1/2 pound    toasted malt
                    1/2 pound    Munich malt
                    2 ounces     dextrin malt
                    2-1/2 ounces Tettnanger hops (4.2 alpha)
                    1/2 ounce    Cascade hops (5.0 alpha)
                    3 teaspoons  gypsum
                                 Vierka dry lager yeast

     Procedure:

     Make up yeast starter 2 days before brewing.  Grind all grains togeth-
     er,  dough-in with 5 cups warm water.  Use 3 quarts water at  130  de-
     grees to bring up to protein rest temperature of 122 degrees.  Set for
     30  minutes.   Add 8 pints of boiling water and heat to  154  degrees.
     Set  for at least 30 minutes.  Bring to 170 degrees for 5 minutes  for
     mash out.  Sparge with 2 gallons water.

     Add dry extract, bring to boil.  Boil 15 minutes and add one ounce  of
     Tettnanger.  Boil one hour.  Add 1 ounce of Tettnanger at 30  minutes.
     Add  1/2  ounce of Tettnanger and 1/2 ounce of Cascade  at  5  minutes
     (with  Irish  moss  if desired).  Strain and chill.   Rack  off  trub.
     Pitch yeast.

     Ferment at 68 degrees for 3 days.  Rack to secondary and lager 18 days
     at 42 degrees.  After 18 days keg and lager an additional 17 days.

     Comments:

     This brew was dark brown-red with a distinct nutty flavor coming  from
     the toasted malt barley.  A good head, little chill haze.

                      CHAPTER 6: DOPPLEBOCK AND BARLEYWINE



     Dopplebock and barleywine are among the strongest beers brewed.   Both
     are brewed to very high gravities, typically 1.100 or higher, and  age
     several months before drinking.  The difference between the two styles
     is  that dopplebock is a lager whereas barleywine is an ale  (although
     both  may sometimes need a wine or champagne yeast to  complete  their
     fermentation).

     For more information about these heavy beers, see Fred Eckhardt's  The
     Essentials of Beer Style, (available from the Association of Brewers),
     or one of the general beer texts such as Michael Jackson's World Guide
     to  Beer.   You may also want to look at the Russian  Imperial  stouts
     described in Chapter 4.

     Author: Jack Webb  (jack.l.webb@office.wang.com)
     Digest: February 4, 1991, Issue #575

     Ingredients:

                     1/2 pound    pale malt
                     1/2 pound    crystal malt
                     1/2 pound    chocolate malt
                     9.9 pounds   dark malt extract syrup
                     1 pound      dry amber malt extract
                     3-1/2 ounces Saaz hops (boil)
                     1/2 ounce    Hallertauer hops (finish)
                                  lager yeast
                     3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Roast  pale  malt in 325 degree oven for 15 minutes  or  until  golden
     brown.   Crack grains and add to 1-1/2 gallons cold water.   Bring  to
     boil.   Before  serious boil starts, remove grains.  Add  extract  and
     Saaz  hops.   Boil 60 minutes.  Add Hallertauer hops and boil  5  more
     minutes.   Remove  from heat.  Cover and let hops  steep  15  minutes.
     Strain into 3-1/2 gallons cold water.  (Be sure to strain out as  much
     stuff  as  possible.)  Pitch yeast and ferment one week  at  about  65
     degrees,  then rack to secondary.  Secondary fermentation should  last
     about  3  weeks  at 45-50 degrees.   Prime  and  bottle.   Refrigerate
     bottles for about 1 month.

     Comments:

     This dopplebock was based on a recipe from Papazian's book.  In making
     this  beer,  I used hops plugs for the first time.   Wonderful  stuff.
     They  expand  and  give the appearance of fresh hops  and  they  smell
     great!   This  batch turned out really well.  Very  dark  and  smooth,
     lightly carbonated, with a considerable alcoholic whammy.  Great  sip-
     pin' beer.

     about 1 hour.  In last 30 minutes add Irish moss, Fuggles, and  spark-
     eloid.  Add to 3-1/2 gallons cold water in fermenter.  Pitch yeast and
     ferment about 7 months.  Bottle and age.

     Comments:

     I  made a batch of this about a year ago and it was so good that  I've
     got  two  batches of it running in tandem.  This has a  nice  balanced
     flavor.

     Ingredients:

                10 pounds Munton & Fison light unhopped extract
                2 pounds  marigold honey
                4 ounces  Fuggles leaf hops (boil)
                1 ounce   Cascade pellets (finish)
                          Munton & Fison ale yeast
                          champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  malt, honey, Fuggles for 60 minutes.  Add Cascades in last  five
     minutes.  Pour in fermenter with 3-1/2 gallons cold water.  Pitch  ale
     yeast.   When  fermentation  subsides, pitch  champagne  yeast.   When
     clear,  rack to secondary.  Let sit a long time and then bottle.   Age
     at least one year.

     Comments:

     This  is  the best beer I've ever brewed (and getting  better  by  the
     year!)  The hops may not seem to be enough, but it is.  Watch out, you
     can get addicted to barleywine!

                 3.3 pounds  Coopers bitter ale kit
                 3.3 pounds  Coopers Draught ale kit
                 1 pound     amber malt extract

                 2 teaspoons gypsum
                 1 pack      MEV 031 high-temp ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Start  yeast  2 days ahead and add to quart of sterile  wort  3  hours
     before  brewing.   Add gypsum to 2 gallons water,  add  crystal  malt.
     Bring  to  boil.   Strain out grain.  After 10  minutes  add  Northern
     Brewer  hops.   30 minutes into boil add Willamette hops.  Boil a  few
     more  minutes.   Remove from heat.  Strain into  fermenter  with  cold
     water to make 5 gallons.  Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     What I want to know is, how does the wort know exactly when my back is
     turned  so it can instantly boil over? I never see it start  to  rise,
     but  I  turn to the sink for one second and when I  turn  around,  the
     stove is covered with molten wort!

                     1/2 - 1 pound Herbal hops substitute

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 5 gallons of full-strength barleywine plus 4 gallons
     half  strength.   Follow  normal procedures, but brew  in  a  7-gallon
     kettle and then divide the wort into separate fermenters.  The special
     hops  substitute  is a mix of hops repeatedly soaked  and  sparged  in
     lukewarm  water for at least 4 hours to eliminate  water-soluble  off-
     flavors.   Special hops are added to the secondary fermenter  about  1
     week before kegging.  Quantity used depends on quality of herbs/hops.

                                  champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Mash in 18 quarts water @148 degrees (adjust pH to 5.3).  Starch  con-
     version  2  hours at 150-141 degrees.  Mash out 5 minutes at  168  de-
     grees.   Sparge  at 168 degrees.  Boil wort 2-1/2 hours.   90  minutes
     after start of boil, add extracts, molasses, and Northern Brewer hops.
     30  minutes  later, add Kent Goldings hops.  In last 15  minutes,  add
     Hallertauer and Cascade hops.

     Comments:

     This  was not an easy batch.  The yeast took off immediately and  blew
     out  1-1/2 gallons through the blow tube.  Once the yeast subsided,  I
     let it sit for a week and then bottled.  I should have taken a  sample
     and pitched some Red Star Pasteur champagne yeast because it turns out
     the  gravity  was still 1.091!  The flavor is impossibly  syrupy,  but
     I'll  put  in the cellar and forget about it for a few  months.   This
     could be my most expensive failure yet, then again, maybe not.   Maybe
     I can pour it over ice cream...

                       CHAPTER 7: HERBAL AND SPICED BEER



     Homebrewers love to experiment with different flavors in their  beers,
     and over the past couple years there have been discussions about using
     everything  from  hot chili peppers to sweet maple syrup  in  homebrew
     recipes.   This chapter describes some of the recipes that  have  been
     shared.  Many  of these are Christmas wassails spiced  with  cinnamon,
     cloves, allspice, or similar spices.  These recipes can be either ales
     or lagers...firm rules do not apply.

     Digest: August 5, 1989, Issue #221

     Ingredients:

                6 pounds   light dry extract
                2-1/2 cups crystal malt
                4 ounces   grated ginger
                1 ounce    Northern Brewer leaf hops (14% alpha)
                3/4 ounce  Brambling leaf hops
                1 pack     Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  malt, ginger, and Northern Brewer hops in five gallons of  water
     for  60 minutes.  Remove from heat and add Brambling hops.   Allow  to
     steep 10 minutes.  Force cool, and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  batch turned out pretty good.  It's a light amber color, with  a
     light sweetness.  The ginger comes through nicely.  Light and  thirst-
     quenching for the summer months.

     Ingredients:

                   3.3 pounds Northwestern light malt extract
                   2 pounds   dark malt extract
                   2 pounds   wildflower honey
                   2 ounces   Hertsburger hops (boil)
                   1/2 ounce  Goldings hops (finish)
                   2 ounces   grated ginger (boil)
                   1 ounce    grated ginger (finish)
                   2 packs    Munton & Fison ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Start yeast.  Boil malt extract, honey, boiling hops and boiling  gin-
     ger  for about 1 hour.  Strain.  Add finishing hops and ginger.   Cool
     rapidly in tub.  Pitch started yeast.  Ferment.  Prime and bottle.

     Comments:

     This was based on  a ginger beer recipe from Papazian's book.  It  was
     tasty after just one week in the bottle.  This is a light beer with  a
     nice ginger aroma and flavor.

                                  Spruce Beer

     Author: Louis Clark  (hplabs!mage!lou)
     Digest: July 4, 1990, Issue #453

     Ingredients:

                 6.6 pounds   Munton & Fison dark malt extract
                 3 pounds     dry dark extract
                 3 ounces     Cascade hops (4.3 alpha)
                 3 teaspoons  gypsum
                 1 ounce      Cascade hops
                 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                 1/2 ounce    spruce essence
                              Leigh & Williams Beer & Stout yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  malt and boiling hops for 1 hour.  In last 10 minutes add the  1
     ounce  of  Cascade finishing hops and the Irish moss.  In the  last  2
     minutes add the spruce essence.  Chill and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     My  tasting notes on this say that at 2-1/2 months after  bottling  it
     was "fair."  This tells me that it was unremarkable.  My  recollection
     is  that  it was drinkable but unexciting.  Perhaps the  dark  extract
     overwhelmed the spruce and more spruce essence should have been  used.
     Where  the bottle says "Sufficient for 8 gallons of spruce beer"  they
     may mean for a somewhat lighter beer.

     Author: Doug Roberts  (dzzr@lanl.gov)
     Digest: December 6, 1989, Issue #317 (and #318)

     Ingredients:

                     7-1/2 pounds Klages malt
                     1-1/2 pounds crystal malt (90L)
                     1/4 pounds   chocolate malt
                     1/4 pound    black patent malt
                     1/2 pound    dextrin powder
                     1/2 cup      molasses
                     1 teaspoon   cardamom
                     1 teaspoon   cinnamon
                     1 teaspoon   ginger
                                  grated rind of 4 oranges
                     1-1/2 ounce  Nugget hops (boil)
                     1 ounce      Willamette hops (finish)
                                  Whitbread ale yeast
                     1/2 cup      molasses (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash grains.  Add dextrin (I was out of Cara-pils), 1/2 cup  molasses,
     spices,  boiling hops, and orange peel.  Boil 1 hour.   Add  finishing
     hops  in  last few minutes.  Strain into fermenter.   Cool  and  pitch
     yeast.

     Comments:

     During the boil the spices combined with orange peel and malt made the
     house smell really good---kind of like a beer fruit cake. After smell-
     ing  and tasting the wort, I think I've identified one of  the  secret
     ingredients  in Anchor's Christmas Ale: cardamom.  I'm  guessing  they
     use 1/4-1/2 teaspoon per five gallons.

     Author: Oliver Grillmeyer  (topramen@ernie.Berkeley.EDU)
     Digest: March 15, 1989, Issue #101

     Ingredients:

                     4 pounds  honey
                     6 ounces  grated ginger
                     3 pounds  light malt extract
                     1 ounce   Brewers Gold leaf hops
                     1/2 ounce Northern Brewer hops pellets
                     1/2 ounce Saaz hops pellets yeast

     Procedure:

     Use  two brew kettles. In the first, add 4 gallons water,  honey,  and
     ginger.   Maintain at 180 degrees for 45 minutes.  While first pot  is
     heating, add malt extract to 3 gallons water in the second pot.  Bring
     to boil.  Add 1 ounce of Brewers Gold to boil for 45 minutes.  Add 1/2
     ounce  of Northern Brewer at 30 minutes.  When second pot  is  removed
     from heat, add 1/2 ounce of Saaz hops and steep.  Combine pots,  cool,
     and  pitch.   I also brewed a second batch with  the  same  procedure,
     except  that  I  used 8 pounds of honey instead of  4,  1/2  ounce  of
     Northern  Brewer  hops replaced the 1 ounce of Brewers Gold,  and  1/2
     ounce of Galena replaced the 1/2 ounce of Northern Brewer.

     Comments:

     Six ounces of ginger seems about right to give a nice balanced flavor.
     The ginger was grated in food processor, but it had to struggle as the
     ginger  tends to break up into strands that get stuck in  the  blades.
     (I  did  not peel the ginger).  This beer had an amber color  and  all
     flavors  were readily apparent---hops, malt, ginger, and light  honey.
     The color was a medium amber shade.

     Ingredients:

              3.3 pounds   Munton & Fison dark plain malt extract
              1-1/2 pounds Munton & Fison plain dark dry extract
              1 cup        corn sugar
              3/4 pound    crystal malt
              1/2 pound    chocolate malt
              hunk         ginger, grated
              2 ounces     Cascade hops (boil)
              1 ounce      Fuggles hops (finish)
                           ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Add  crushed grains to 2 gallons cold water.  When mixture  begins  to
     boil,  remove  grains.   Boil 1 hour with malt  extracts,  ginger  and
     Cascade  hops.   Turn off heat, add Fuggles and  steep  five  minutes.
     Strain  into  primary, add water to bring to 5 gallons and  ferment  3
     days.  Rack to secondary.  Prime and bottle.

     Comments:

     My long-term taste bud memory says this was brown, bitter, and slight-
     ly  sweet  with a great ginger flavor and tingle at the  back  of  the
     throat  as  it went down.  It was overcarbonated (7/8 cup  of  priming
     sugar  is too much!) I wish I could tell you how much ginger  I  used,
     but I remember I wished it were more.  Go for it!  I've found  nothing
     better to drink with Chinese food.

                  6 pounds    amber dry malt extract
                  2 ounces    Fuggles and Bullion hops (boil)

                  1 stick     cinnamon
                  1 pack      Edme ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal malt until boil is reached.  Strain out grain  and  add
     extract and boiling hops.  Boil 60 minutes.  Add Saaz hops, ginger and
     cinnamon  in  last 15 minutes of boil.  Cool, top  off  fermenter  and
     pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  batch had a furious fermentation and blew the blow tube off  the
     fermenter, losing about 1-1/2 quarts in the bargain.

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds     Australian dark extract syrup
                     1-1/2 ounces Bullion hops (boil)
                     12 ounces    maple syrup
                                  ale yeast
                     3/4 cup      corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Add  six ounces of the maple syrup during the boil and the other 6  in
     the  last  couple minutes of the boil (much like  a  finishing  hops).
     Total boil time was 1 hour.

     Comments:

     This is a very good beer.  I don't typically drink stouts, but I real-
     ly  like  this one.  I absolutely don't like Guinness, but I  do  like
     Young's Oatmeal Stout and Rubicon  Stout.  I think the maple stout  is
     better than any of these.  It is very smooth going down, and has sweet
     but mellow maple flavored aftertaste.  Thanks to Jim Kipps for posting
     this recipe.

     Ingredients:

                    3.3 pounds John Bull amber malt extract
                    1/2 pound  crystal malt
                    1/2 pound  dark dry malt
                    1/2 pound  corn sugar
                    10         fresh Jalapeno peppers
                    2 ounces   Cascade hops
                               Munton & Fison ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Chop up Jalapeno peppers and boil them with the wort for 30 minutes or
     so.  Strain them out when pouring wort into primary.  Rack to  second-
     ary about 4 hours after pitching yeast.

          Note:  When handling jalapenos, be sure to wash hands  thor-
          oughly or wear rubber gloves. You'll find out why if you are
          a  contact lens wearer. (I discovered this the  hard  way---
          making pickles, not beer.)
          --- Ed.

     Comments:

     The  beer  is amber, clear, has enough hops for me, and  has  a  great
     spicy (bordering on hot) aftertaste.

                         CHAPTER 8: FRUIT FLAVORED BEER



     Fruit  is usually shunned by commercial brewers (with the notable  ex-
     ception of Belgian lambic ale brewers) but embraced by homebrewers  as
     a  distinctive adjunct. Some of these recipes are great, some  are  of
     questionable  taste---you be the judge!  These recipes can  be  either
     ales or lagers...firm rules do not apply.

                                 Blueberry Ale

     Author: Patrick Stirling  (pms@Corp.Sun.COM)

     Ingredients:

                    7 pounds    British amber extract
                    1-1/2 pound crystal malt
                    2 ounces    Northern Brewer hops (boil)
                    1 ounce     Fuggles hops (finish)
                                Whitbread ale yeast
                    2 pounds    fresh frozen blueberries

     Procedure:

     Steep  crystal  malt while bringing to boil.  Remove  grains  and  add
     extract  and boiling hops.  Boil 60 minutes.  Add finish hops and  let
     steep 15 minutes.  Sparge into ice, mix.  Rack to 7-gallon carboy.  At
     peak  of  fermentation add blueberries.  Ferment 1 week  and  rack  to
     secondary.  Prime with corn sugar.

     Comments:

     When I tasted this during the bottling stage there was not much  blue-
     berry  flavor.   More blueberries may be required to give  a  stronger
     taste.  The beer came out remarkably clear with a nice reddish tint.

                               Apples in the Snow

     Author: Shannon Posniewski imagesys!shannon@uu.psi.com
     Digest: October 19, 1990, Issue #521

     Ingredients

            6.6 pounds John Bull light malt extract (or other brand)
            1 pound    corn sugar
            2 ounces   Hallertauer hops (boil)
            1/2 ounce  Hallertauer hops (finish)
            12 pounds  apples (9 pounds Granny Smith, 3 # Macintosh)
                       water crystals
            2 packs    Edme ale yeast
            3/4 cup    corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Cut  apples into 8-10 slices.  Put 1-1/2 gallons water into  pot,  add
     boiling hops and bring to boil.  Add extract and corn sugar.  Boil  40
     minutes.  Add finishing hops and apples.  Steep 15 minutes.  Pour wort
     into  3-1/2  gallons cold water.  Push apples to one  side  and  pitch
     yeast.  Ferment 3 weeks.

     Comments:

     This  is based on Papazian"s "Cherries in the Snow."  We  used  Granny
     Smith  and Macintosh because we wanted  high-fructose  varieties---be-
     sides, we like them.  Perhaps the use of Saaz or a more delicate  hops
     would  be in order because this was too hoppy.  Beer seems to  improve
     with  age and after a few months the flavor was described as  "immacu-
     late" but with balance tipped more toward hops than apple.

     Author: Mike Herbert  (michaelh@homebrew.wv.tek.com)
     Digest: June 18, 1990, Issue #441

     Ingredients:

               3.3 pounds    John Bull dark unhopped malt extract
               2 pounds      Munton & Fison light dry extract
               1/2 cup       black patent malt
               2 ounces      Cascades hops
               2 tablespoons gypsum
               1 teaspoon    salt
               3-5 pounds    pitted chopped cherries
               1/2 ounce     Hallertauer hops
                             yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep  black  patent  malt in 2 gallons of  water  bringing  to  boil.
     Strain out grain.  Add extract and boil with Cascade hops, gypsum, and
     salt.   Boil  60 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add finishing  hops  and
     cherries.  Steep 30 minutes.  Strain into fermenter with cold water to
     make 5 gallons.  Pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     This  recipe came from Charlie Papazian many years ago.  This is  sup-
     posed  to make a lager, but I've never actually produced a lager  with
     this  recipe, only an ale.  The cherries add a sweetness, but are  not
     overpowering in a dark beer.  I also tried another cherry beer  called
     "Sinfully Red Cherry Ale" from the Spring 1984 issue of Zymurgy.  This
     used 10 pounds of cherries and made a much lighter beer.

                            Dark as the Night Stout

     Author: Wayne Allen  (wa@cadillac.cad.mcc.com)
     Digest: November 29, 1989, Issue #312

     Ingredients:
           8 cans      blueberries (or 10 pints fresh, or 6# frozen)
           1/2 pound   roasted barley
           1/3 pound   black patent malt
           1 pound     crystal malt
           6.6 pounds  John Bull dark unhopped malt extract
           1-1/2 ounce Fuggles hops (boil)
           1/2 cup     corn sugar (priming)
                       yeast

     Procedure:

     Crush  and boil blueberries in 1-1/2 gallons of water for 10  minutes.
     Strain  out berries.  Add grains and steep.  Add extract and hops  and
     bring to boil.  Strain into fermenter with enough cold water to make 5
     gallons.   Pitch yeast.  Give this lots of time in the secondary  fer-
     menter or add champagne yeast after initial fermentation.

     Comments:

     This  tastes like a normal stout, but after 4 or 5 sips, a  warm  glow
     begins  to  suffuse your throat and tummy; great  for  winter  nights.
     Don't worry about pectin haze, you definitely won't see it!

     Author: Chuck Coronella  (coronellrjds@che.utah.edu)
     Digest: June 26, 1990, Issue #447

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds     Laaglander light dry extract
                     1/4 pound    crystal malt
                     1/4 pound    lactose
                     7-8 pounds   fresh sweet cherries
                     1/2 ounce    Chinook hops (boil)
                     1/2 ounce    Chinook hops (finish)
                     1/2 ounce    Hallertauer hops (dry)
                     1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                                  Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 5-1/2 gallons.  Freeze cherries a couple days before
     brewing.  Defrost in the fridge.  While wort is boiling, remove  stems
     and crush cherries.  After boiling, pour wort over cherries in fermen-
     ter.   Add cold water and pitch yeast.  After a couple days,  rack  to
     secondary, straining out cherries.

     Comments:

     I  decided  to use lactose because several people  thought  Papazian's
     Cherries in the Snow was a bit dry.

     Author: Andy Wilcox  (andy@mosquito.cis.ufl.edu)
     Digest: May 9, 1990, Issue #415

     Ingredients:

              1 can       Mount Mellick Famous Irish Stout extract
              3 pounds    M&F dark dry malt extract
              4 pounds    frozen blackberries
              1 pound     dark crystal malt
              1/2 pound   black patent malt
              1/2 pound   roasted barley
              1-1/2 ounce Hallertauer hops
              1/2 ounce   Fuggles hops
                          ale yeast
                          corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Start grains in brewpot with cool water.  Remove when boil  commences.
     Add all malt and Hallertauer hops.  Boil 1 hour.  Add Fuggles and boil
     5 more minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add thawed blackberries and  steep
     15 minutes.  Cool.  Dump whole mess into primary.  After a couple rack
     to secondary, straining out berries.

     Comments:

     This  stout reaches prime in 4-6 weeks and rapidly  deteriorates  from
     there,  acquiring a winey flavor as the residual blackberry  sweetness
     erodes.   An  amateur judge commented, "Good and  black.   Good  mouth
     feel.   Unbelievable finish---seems to last forever!  Fruit?   I  want
     the recipe.  Nice job."

     Author: John Isenhour  (LLUG_JI%DENISON.BITNET)
     Digest: June 14, 1989, Issue #177

     Ingredients:

                    4-pound can  Alexanders pale malt extract
                    1/2 pound    light dry extract
                    10 HBU       hops
                    1/4 teaspoon Irish moss
                    2 gallons    fruit juice (such as apple,
                                 pineapple, cranberry, or raspberry)
                                 yeast

     Comments:

     This  recipe was described in the Summer 1987 issue of  Zymurgy.   See
     the issue for procedural details.  When I brew with fruit I do not add
     fruit  to  the  boil, this will set the pectins to  creating  a  haze.
     Instead  add them after the boil and steep.  I generally use  a  wheat
     malt extract to emulate a lambic frambozen.  Try a Lindemann Framboise
     to  see  what you're shooting for.  They use unmalted wheat  in  their
     beer.

     Author: Cher Feinstein  (crf@pine.circa.ufl.edu)
     Digest: April 19, 1990, Issue #402

     Ingredients:

                     6-7 pounds light malt extract
                     1/4 pound  crystal malt
                     2-1/2 cups raspberry puree
                     1 ounce    boiling hops (Hallertauer,
                                Saaz, Tettnanger)
                                yeast
                     10 cups    raspberry puree

     Procedure:

     Crack, steep, and strain crystal malt before boiling.  Add extract and
     hops.   Boil.  Strain into primary.  Add 2-1/2 cups  raspberry  puree.
     Add enough cold water to make 5 gallons.  Pitch yeast. When racking to
     secondary,  add another 10 cups raspberry puree.

     Comments:

     I  figured that I'll sterilize anything I use to add the puree,  while
     taking my chances with the puree itself (rather than heating it up and
     risking setting the pectins).

     yeast.  After about 5 days, strain into secondary fermenter,  avoiding
     sediment.  Bottle after about 1 more week.  Age bottles about 2 weeks.

     Comments:

     This isn't the best beer I've ever had, but the red color and  mixture
     of cranberry, champagne, and beer tastes (in that order) together make
     wonderful conversation pieces.  A perfect treat for the holidays.  The
     cranberry taste is quite dominating: I might try just 2 or 3 pounds of
     cranberries  in  the  future.   This recipe  is  based  on  Papazian's
     Cherries in the Snow.

                              Great Pumpkin Bitter


     Author: Barry Cunningham  (abvax!calvin.icd.ab.com!bwc)
     Digest: November 9, 1989, Issue #299

     Ingredients:

                 1 can       Cooper's bitter hopped malt syrup
                 1-1/2 pound M&F dry malt extract
                 1/4 pound   black patent malt
                 1 cup       Brer  Rabbit molasses
                 1/2 ounce   Tettnanger hop pellets
                             (boil 30 minutes)
                 1/2 ounce   Tettnanger hops pellets (finish)
                 2 sticks    cinnamon
                 2-3 ounces  fresh grated ginger
                 10 pounds   pumpkin mush
                 1/2 cup     chopped cilantro
                 1-2 ounces  fresh grated ginger
                 2 packs     Pasteur champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Steep black patent malt.  Remove grain and add extracts.  Boil wort 60
     minutes with 2-3 ounces ginger, add boiling hops at 30 minutes.  At 10
     minutes  add  cinnamon.  In last couple minutes, add  finishing  hops.
     Prepare pumpkin while wort is boiling: place pumpkin flesh in  blender
     or food processor and mush.  Mix chopped cilantro and 1-2 ounces fresh
     ginger in with mush.  Place pumpkin mush, wort,  and water to make  6-
     1/2 gallons in primary fermenter.  Let primary fermentation proceed  1
     week.   Remove pumpkin mush and strain remaining liquid into 5  gallon
     carboy.  Rack again after 3 weeks.  Bottle after another 2 months.

     Comments:

     This  is  quite aromatic and will make a good sipping  beer  for  next
     halloween.  It is definitely not for consuming in large quantity.

                              Washington Apple Ale

     Author: Joe Shirey  (jshirey@jarthur.Claremont.edu)
     Digest: March 2, 1990, Issue #370

     Ingredients:

           4 pounds    Telford's Yorkshire nut brown ale hopped malt
           1 pound     honey
           1/2 pound   corn sugar
           1/2 pound   dark crystal malt
           4 pounds    red apples
           2 teaspoons cinnamon
                       ale yeast

     Procedure:

     In  cold  water,  place crushed dark crystal malt  in  a  cheesecloth.
     Bring  water  to boil.  When boiling commences, remove grain  and  add
     Telford's.  Boil 15-20 minutes.  Add sugar and honey and boil  another
     10  minutes.   Reduce heat so that boiling stops.   Add  cinnamon  and
     sliced  apples and steep 15 minutes.  Remove apples with strainer  and
     transfer wort to primary.

     Comments:

     This  beer has a medium body with a hint of apple flavor.  It is  very
     smooth with little or no bitterness, but that can be changed by adding
     finishing hops.

                            Raspberry Imperial Stout

     Author: Dan Miles  (miles@cs.washington.edu)
     Digest: August 28, 1990, Issue #483

     Ingredients:

               15-1/4 pounds bulk light extract
               3/4 pound     roasted barley
               3/4 pound     black patent malt
               3/4 pound     chocolate malt
               2 pounds      English crystal malt
               3-3/4 ounces  Bullion pellets (9.6 alpha)
               1-1/4 ounces  Northern Brewer pellets (6.7% alpha)
               2 ounces      Kent Goldings pellets
               13 pounds     fresh raspberries
               4 teaspoons   gypsum
                             Sierra Nevada yeast
               1 cup         corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     This  makes  6-1/2 to 7 gallons.  This is based on  Papazian's  recipe
     from  the Summer 1990 issue of Zymurgy, except that I use  more  rasp-
     berries than Charlie.  Follow his directions, or E-mail me for  direc-
     tions. (Directions are pretty standard.)

     The  Bullion hops and Northern Brewer are used for bittering  and  are
     added  to  the  boil.  The Kent Goldings pellets  are  used  for  dry-
     hopping.

     Comments:

     This  had  a very strong raspberry taste with a  slightly  coffee/dark
     malt and hoppy/bitter aftertaste.  The raspberry taste is  accompanied
     by  a sort of astringency or acidity that will supposedly soften  with
     age.  It's still very young for an Imperial stout.

                              My Framboise Recipe

     Author: Cher Feinstein  (crf@pine.circa.ufl.edu)
     Digest: August 22, 1990, Issue #479

     Ingredients:

     6.6 pounds wheat malt extract
     1/2 pound crystal malt
     1 ounce Hallertauer hops
     1 pack Wyeast #3056, Bavarian wheat
     5 or 6 bags frozen raspberries (12 ounce bags)

     Procedure:

     The wheat malt should ideally be a 60-40 mix of wheat and barley.  The
     crystal malt is cracked and steeped in hot water for 20 minutes,  then
     strained.  The  hops are then added and the mixture is boiled  for  45
     minutes.  Chill and add yeast.  Allow the beer to ferment for  7  days
     and  then  prepare raspberry mixture by defrosting berries  and  using
     blender  to  puree.  Pitch in fermenter and after  48  hours,  bottle.
     Next time I make this, I will modify the recipe to use 1 can (6.6#) of
     Ireks wheat malt, 3-4 pounds of light DME, 1 ounce of Hallertauer  (35
     minute boil), and again, Wyeast #3056.  By using a 100% wheat extract,
     such  as Ireks, I can control the amount of barley extract  to  assure
     60% wheat to 40% barley.

     Comments:

     I've  been getting a large head with good lace, and an enormous  aroma
     of  raspberries.   The brew is also crystal clear, with  a  deep  ruby
     color  (which I consider to be just plain luck since wheat  beers  are
     characteristically cloudy).  As aging continues, any hints of  astrin-
     gency are disappearing.  It will probably need 4P6 months aging  time,
     quite possibly more.

                            CHAPTER 9: SPECIALTY ALE



     This  is a catch-all chapter for various types of ale that  don't  fit
     neatly  into a larger category,for example, Scotch ale, brown ale,  or
     Kolsch.  Scotch ales are typically dark brown strong beers brewed to a
     starting gravity of about 1.055.

     Brown  ales were historically brewed in the U.K. as  a  lightly-hopped
     medium-bodied  beer.   They  are usually brewed from  pale  malt  with
     additional crystal, caramel, or roasted malts for coloring.  These are
     not usually very heavy beers, and the English mild may be brewed to  a
     gravity  as  low  as 1.035 while other brown ales  will  hover  around
     1.050.

     For more information about brown ales, Scotch ales, or any other style
     in this chapter, see Fred Eckhardt's The Essentials of Beer Style,  or
     Michael Jackson's World Guide to Beer.

                               My Own Scotch Ale

     Author: Todd Enders  (enders@plains.NoDak.edu)
     Digest: January 16, 1991, Issue #566

     Ingredients:

                 6 pounds  Klages 2-row malt
                 1 pound   Munich malt (10L)
                 1 pound   Dextrin (Cara-pils) malt
                 1/2 pound crystal malt (80L)
                 4 ounces  black patent malt
                 1 cup     dark molasses
                 3/4 ounce East Kent Goldings hops (6.2 alpha)
                 1 pack    Wyeast #1028 London Ale
                 2/3 cup   corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Mash  in  2 gallons water at 138 degrees, adjust pH to 5.2 using  Cal-
     cium  Carbonate.  Protein rest 30 minutes at 158 degrees.   Conversion
     rest  30 minutes at 158 degrees.  Mash out 5 minutes at  168  degrees.
     Sparge  with 5 gallons water at 165 degrees.  Boil 90 minutes,  adding
     hops  in  last 30 minutes.  Chill wort, pitch yeast  and  ferment  1-2
     days.  Rack to secondary for 5 more days and bottle.

     Comments:

     This  is  the first try at formulating my own recipe.  It  turned  out
     quite  nice, malty with just a touch of hops.  You may not be able  to
     drink  just one!  This is one of the smoothest batches I ever  brewed.
     It is really smooth even after only 2 weeks in the bottle.  The rather
     intense malt flavor and low hopping rate makes it a refreshing  change
     of pace from my steady production of IPA.

                             Sort of Nut Brown Ale

     Author: Todd Enders  (enders@plains.NoDak.edu)
     Digest: June 27, 1990, Issue #448

     Ingredients:

                     2.4 pounds pale ale malt
                     0.4 pound  crystal malt (80L)
                     1/4 pound  pan roasted barley
                     1/2 cup    dark molasses
                     1/2 ounce  Willamette hops (5.5 alpha)
                                Wyeast #1028

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 2 gallons.  Raw unmalted barley was roasted in a pan
     over  medium heat until the outside was quite dark but the inside  was
     only  tan---stir often to avoid scorching.  Mashin in 132  degrees  (5
     quarts  of water) at pH of 5.2 Mash 2 hours at 152-153 degrees.   Mash
     out  5 minutes at 168 degrees.  Sparge in 2-1/2 gallons of 165  degree
     water.   Boil  90 minutes adding hops 30 minutes before end  of  boil.
     Chill and strain and pitch yeast.

     Comments:

     The  toasted barley probably had a Lovibond rating around 80-100,  the
     unfermented wort was delicious.  This is similar to many stout recipes
     but  the barley isn't roasted long enough to give it that  much  dark-
     ness.

     Author: David Haberman  (habermand@afal-edwards.af.mil)
     Digest:March 22, 1989, Issue #106

     Ingredients:

                     6 pounds    dark Australian DME
                     1 pound     caramel crystal malt
                     1-1/2 ounce Willamette hops
                     1-1/2 ounce Fuggles hops
                     1 pack      Wyeast #1098: British Ale
                     3/4 cup     corn sugar (priming)

     Procedure:

     Boil 2 gallons of water and turn off heat.  Add crystal malt and steep
     about  15 minutes.  Strain through muslin into kettle.   Heat  another
     gallon of water to 170 degrees.  Pour through grain into pot.  Heat to
     boiling and add DME and 1/3 of hops.  After 45 minutes add another 1/3
     of  hops.   Turn off heat after 15 minutes and add last 1/3  of  hops.
     Steep.   Cool wort and add 2 gallons of cold water.  Pour in wort  and
     pitch yeast.  Rack to secondary after 4 days top off with enough water
     to make 5 gallons.  After 4 weeks, prime and bottle.

     Comments:

     I thought that the final gravity of this beer was a bit high, but  the
     beer came out tasting great and no bottles exploded.  In order to call
     this  a  porter it needs more hops, therefore I think it is  a  Scotch
     ale.

     Ingredients:

                     7 pounds     Klages malt
                     1/4 pound    chocolate malt
                     1/4 pound    black patent malt
                     1/2 pound    crystal malt (90L)
                     1 ounce      Willamette hops (boil)
                     4/5 ounce    Perle hops (boil)
                     1/2 ounce    Willamette hops (finish)
                     1 teaspoon   gypsum
                     1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                                  Whitbread ale yeast

     Procedure:

     The  mash was done using Papazian's temperature-controlled mash.   The
     boiling  hops (Willamette and Perle) equal 9.84 AAUs.   The  finishing
     hops are added after the boil (while chilling with an immersion chill-
     er).  The ale yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup of 100 degree water.

     Comments:

     This batch was what my fond memories of drinking London Brown Ales  in
     Canterbury, UK were all about.  A classic.

                               Geordie Brown Ale

     Author: Elaine May  (elaine@hpmtlx.hp.com)
     Digest: February 21, 1990, Issue #362

     Ingredients:

                     2 cans       Geordie Extra Strong ale
                     1 cup        dark brown sugar
                     2 cups       corn sugar
                     1/2 pound    crystal malt
                     1/2 cup      maltodextrin
                     1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
                     1 ounce      Willamette leaf hops

     Procedure:

     Bring grain to boil in 1 gallon water; remove grain when water  starts
     to boil. Add another 1/2 gallon of water and bring to boil again.  Add
     extract and sugars, boil for 15 minutes.  Add Irish moss and hops  for
     last 5 minutes of boil. Put it in fermenter with enough water to  make
     5  gallons.   Add ale yeast and wait.

     Comments:

     The  beer  is a brown ale with sweetness from the sugars  and  crystal
     malt;  not  much hop flavor.  The maltodextrin contributes  a  strange
     slightly  syrupy quality (I think)---I might leave it out  next  time.
     Anyway, I thought it was a nice, drinkable brown ale.

     Author: Florian Bell  (florianb@tekred.cna.tek.com)
     Digest: December 15, 1989, Issue #324

     Ingredients:

                   5 pounds  light dry extract
                   3 pounds   2-row pale malt
                   1/2 pound  crystal malt (40L)
                   2 ounces   roasted barley
                   4 ounces   wheat malt
                   2 ounces   dextrin malt
                   2 ounces   Cascade hops (5.2% alpha)
                   1/2 ounce  Tettnanger hops (4.9% alpha)
                   1/2 ounce  Perle hops (7.2% alpha)
                   1/2 ounce  Kent Goldings hops (5.2% alpha)
                   1 teaspoon Irish moss
                   1 pack     Wyeast Irish

     Procedure:

     I used Papazian's partial mash method, except used 2 gallons of sparge
     water.   I got 18 pints of sparge and added two pints of water to  the
     boil, along with the dry extract.  Boil 60 minutes.  Add 1 ounce  Cas-
     cade,  1/4 ounce Perle, and 1/4 ounce Tettnanger at 40  minutes.   Add
     1/2  ounce  Cascade, 1/4 ounce Perle, and 1/4 ounce Tettnanger  at  30
     minutes.   Add 1/2 ounce Cascade, and 1/2 ounce Kent Goldings  in  hop
     bag  at 3 minutes.  Strain into primary fermenter.  Transfer hops  bag
     to primary.

     Comments:

     Twelve  days in the bottle was sufficient.  I prefer this over  Widmer
     Festbier, after which it was patterned.  It's also a lot cheaper.

                           Barrel Bottom Black Bitter

     Author: Ted Manahan  (tedm@hpldola.hp.com)
     Digest: November 23, 1989, Issue #309

     Ingredients:

                6 pounds     Australian dark malt extract syrup
                2/3 pounds   chocolate malt
                1/3 pound    crystal malt
                2 ounces     Perle hops
                1-1/2 ounces Cascade hops
                             Burton liquid ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Soak  malt  in a pot of hot water for 1 hour.   While  soaking,  begin
     boiling  Australian dark malt with the Perle hops.  After 1 hour,  add
     Cascade  hops  and  turn off heat.  Steep about  30  minutes.   Strain
     everything  into  primary  and add cold water to  bring  volume  to  5
     gallons.  Pitch yeast when cool.

     Comments:

     Barrel Bottom is a very dark, rich and bitter brew with a full head of
     tan  foam.  It could pass as a stout. The only bad part is that  my  5
     gallons  is  almost gone, in less than two  months.  Ingredients  were
     obtained from William's Brewing, the Australian extract is their dark-
     er variety.

     Author: Mike Fertsch  (FERTSCH@adcl.RAY.COM)
     Digest: August 11, 1989, Issue #225

     Ingredients:

                          4 pounds  dark malt extract
                          1/2 pound roast barley
                          1/2 pound crystal malt
                          2 pounds  dark brown sugar
                          2 ounces  Fuggles hops
                          5         saccharin tablets
                                    yeast

     Procedure:

     This  recipe uses saccharin, but I will not use this in my  beer;  in-
     stead  I  may  add brewer's licorice or lactose  for  sweetness.   The
     amount  of fermentables also seems low; I would add a pound or two  of
     light extract to increase the gravity to the mid-fifties.  The  recipe
     also calls for priming with 3 ounces of black treacle, which is molas-
     ses.   This seems low, and it also seems that different  brands  would
     contain different amounts of fermentable sugar.

     Comments:

     This  recipe  is for one of my favorite old ales---Old  Peculiar.   It
     comes from Dave Line's book Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy.

     Digest: November 9, 1989, Issue #299

     Ingredients:

                   6 pounds  M&F light dry extract
                   1 pound   Scottish crystal malt (40L)
                   1 ounce   Northern Brewer leaf hops (boil)
                   1/2 ounce Northern Brewer (finish)
                             Brewers Choice American ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Boiling  hops are put in kettle for a 55 minute boil.   The  finishing
     hops are put in for an additional 5 minutes.

     Comments:

     My last batch came out too light because I added only 1/2 pound of the
     crystal  malt---I  was convinced it was in the 90 Lovibond  range.   I
     also used 6.6 pounds of canned extract.  The resulting beer was  about
     1/3 as dark as the original.

                      CHAPTER 10: MEAD AND OTHER BEVERAGES

     Meadmakers will bend your ear for hours about the rich long  tradition
     surrounding their honey-based brew.  Mead is a sublime elixir, favored
     by  many  homebrewers for its variety and subtlety.  It  is,  however,
     much  stronger than typical beers, and also takes months or  years  to
     properly ferment and age.

     Mead  flavored  with apple juice is called a cyser; if  flavored  with
     grape juices, it's called pyment; if it uses other fruit juices,  it's
     called  melomel; it it draws it' s flavor from herbs and spices,  it's
     called metheglin.  There are several books available on mead, the  one
     used  by most digest subscribers seems to be Acton &  Duncan's  Making
     Mead.

     Other  beverages included in this chapter are easy recipes for  making
     hard cider and a couple recipes for making liqueurs.

                                Basic Small Mead

     Author: Cher Feinstein  (crf@pine.circa.ufl.edu)
     Digest: September 30, 1989, Issue #267

     Ingredients:

                      2-3           cloves
                      2 sticks      cinnamon
                      2 thin        slices ginger
                      2-4 teaspoons orange peel
                      2 pounds      honey yeast
                      1/4 cup       vodka or grain alcohol

     Procedure:

     In a 1-gallon pot, simmer cloves (lightly cracked), cinnamon (broken),
     and  ginger.   Add orange peel.  The amount of orange peel  will  vary
     depending  on  type of honey used.  Use less orange peel  with  orange
     blossom honey, for example.  Simmer.

     Add water to bring volume to 3 quarts.  Return to simmer.  Add  honey,
     stirring constantly.  Do not boil!  Skim off any white scum.  If  scum
     is  yellow, reduce heat.  When no more scum forms, remove  from  heat,
     cover  pot,  and leave overnight.  The next day, strain to  remove  as
     much spice particles as possible.  Pitch yeast.  Replace pot cover.

     Twelve hours later, rack mead to 1-gallon jug, leaving dregs of yeast.
     Top  off jug, bringing to base of neck.  Take a piece of  clean  paper
     towel, fold into quarters, and put over mouth of jug.  Seal with  rub-
     ber  band.  Ferment  for 36 hours, replacing paper towel  whenever  it
     becomes fouled.  Refrigerate 8-12 hours.  Rack to new jug and put back
     in refrigerator for 12 hours.  Add 1/4 cup vodka to kill yeast.   Rack
     to fresh jug.  Refrigerate 3-4 days.  Bottle.

     Comments:

     This is a quickie mead, drinkable in 2 weeks, however, it does improve
     with age.  Aging at least a couple months is recommended. This mead is
     excellent chilled.

     Author:  (jwhite@anovax.enet.dec.com)
     Digest: October 2, 1990, Issue #508

     Ingredients:

                           5 gallons sweet cider
                           3 pounds  brown sugar
                           3 pounds  honey
                           2 packs   champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Strain  3 gallons of cider into a 5-gallon carboy.  Strain 1/2  gallon
     into  pot and heat enough to allow sugar and honey to thoroughly  dis-
     solve.  Pour into carboy and finish filling to neck.  Pitch yeast  and
     seal with airlock.  When fermentation stops, bottle.  Prime with sugar
     to add carbonation.

     Comments:

     For this recipe to turn out well, do not use pasteurized apple  juice.
     My  last  batch  took 3 weeks to ferment.  If  you  notice  unpleasant
     smells during this time, you can ignore them.  Boy, does this turn out
     great!

                                 Blueberry Mead

     Author: Jonathan Corbet  (gaia!jon@handies.ucar.edu)
     Digest: November 28, 1988

     Ingredients:

                      7-10 pounds fresh blueberries
                      1-2 pounds  corn sugar
                      1-2 ounces  hops (Cascades is fine)
                      10 pounds   honey

     Procedure:

     To make 6-1/2 gallons of mead, Boil the honey, sugar, and hops for  at
     least  an hour (although boiling honey is not favored by  most  digest
     subscribers, it works fine and is the method used by Papazian).  Clean
     berries and mash well.  Put mashed berries, hot wort, and enough water
     to make 6-1/2 gallons into a fermenter.  Pitch yeast.  After one week,
     strain  out berries and rack to secondary.  Ferment at least one  more
     month and then bottle, priming with corn sugar and perhaps some  lemon
     grass tea.  Age 6 months to a year.

     Comments:

     This  mead  usually  comes out quite dry.   This  recipe  makes  6-1/2
     gallons.

     on  flowers for 3 days then strain off lowers and top off to 1  gallon
     with  cold  water.  Ferment until specific gravity drops to  10,  then
     rack.   Rack again when gravity drops to 5, and add 1 tablet  campden.
     Rack again when when a heavy deposit forms, or after 3 months,  which-
     ever  comes first.  Add another campden tablet.  Rack again every  3-4
     months, adding a tablet after every second racking.

     Comments:

     This  recipe is based on procedures outlined in Making Mead, by  Bryan
     Acton and Peter Duncan.  They advocate the use of campden rather  than
     boiling  because they feel that after boiling for a long time most  of
     the essences of the honey are gone.  Read the "Basic Procedures"  sec-
     tion of Acton & Duncan for more info.

                                Riesling Pyment

     Author: Jackie Brown  (BROWN@MSUKBS.BITNET)
     Digest: June 24, 1989, Issue #184

     Ingredients:

            4-1/2 pounds  wildflower honey
            5-1/2 pounds  partial blueberry honey
            2 tablespoons acid blend
            1 tablespoon  pectic enzyme
            4 pounds      Alexander's Johanissberg Riesling extract
            1 pack        Red Star champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil honey, acid, enzyme and Riesling extract for 1 hour (I have since
     learned  that honey is best not boiled; subsequent batches  have  been
     made by holding the mixture for 2 hours).  Cool and pitch yeast.  Rack
     to secondary after 8 days.  Bottle after 4 months.

     Comments:

     This is more winey than your straight mead, but very pleasant.  Medium
     dry and spritzig---very nice as a table wine.  Those of you set up  to
     crush  your own grapes might try a grape honey mix.  A drink of  noble
     history!

                                Rice Wine---Saki

     Author: David Herron  (mailrus!ukma!davids.UUCP!david)
     Digest: January 10, 1989, Issue #48

     Ingredients:

                       2-1/2 pounds rice (husked or raw)
                       1/2 pint     grape concentrate
                       7 pints      hot water
                       2-1/2 pounds corn sugar or honey
                       3 teaspoons  acid blend
                       3/4 teaspoon yeast energizer
                       1 tablet     Campden
                       1 pack       sherry yeast

     Procedure:

     Wash  and crush rice.  Place rice in nylon straining bag and place  in
     primary.  Pour hot water over rice and stir in all ingredients  except
     yeast  and  engergizer.  Wait 48 hours.  Add yeast and  energizer  and
     cover primary.  Stir daily, checking gravity and pressing pulp  light-
     ly.   When  gravity reaches 1.050 (2-3 days), add  another  1/4  pound
     dissolved sugar or honey per gallon.  When gravity drops to 1.030 (6-7
     days) strain any juice from bag.  Rack to secondary.  Attach  airlock.
     Rack  again  in  2 months, if necessary.  Bottle when  ready.   It  is
     possible  to continue building up alcohol by adding  additional  sugar
     until  fermentation  ceases.  For a sweeter drink,  add  1/2  teaspoon
     stabilizer and 1/4 pound dissolved sugar.

     NOTE: Any additional sugar added should be corn sugar, not cane sugar.

     Comments:

     This  recipe  came  from  a collection  of  wine  recipes  by  Raymond
     Massaccesi  titled  Winemakers Recipe Handbook.  Various  digest  sub-
     scribers  question the authenticity of this recipe.  Sake should  con-
     tain only rice---no corn sugar, grape concentrate, or honey.   Authen-
     tic sake should also be inoculated with koji.  There is a sake brewery
     in Berkeley, California, that will conduct tours for those  interested
     in  learning more about sake.  Sake is discussed by Fred  Eckhardt  in
     Best  of Beer and Brewing Vol. 1-5, available from the AHA.   Koji  is
     available from Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa.

     Digest: December 23, 1988

     Ingredients:

                        1 gallon unfiltered apple juice
                        1/3      packet yeast

     Procedure:

     Remove  1 pint of juice to allow room for yeast activity.  Add  yeast.
     Let sit 4-10 days.  Replace pint of juice.  Place in refrigerator  and
     enjoy.

     Comments:

     Sometimes  I  rack the cider before placing  in  refrigerator  because
     there  is a heavy build up of dead yeast and particulate  matter  from
     the apple juice.

                        Chuck's Homemade Ozark Rootbeer

     Author: Chuck Cox  (bose!chuck@uunet.UU.NET)
     Digest: January 9, 1990, Issue #338

     Ingredients:

                        2 ounces  birch beer extract
                        10 ounces root beer extract
                        1 pound   honey
                        1 cup     blackstrap molasses
                        1 cup     grade B maple syrup
                        1 gallon  sugar (about 8 pounds)

     Procedure:

     This recipe makes 15 gallons.  Mix all ingredients in a standard  keg.
     Add water to fill keg.  Carbonate.  Drink.

     Comments:

     I thought the molasses taste was a bit harsh and will try either  reg-
     ular molasses, or use less.  I will also try substituting 2 ounces  of
     sarsaparilla  extract  for  2 ounces of the  rootbeer  extract.   This
     recipe  makes a strong tasting rootbeer with about half the  sweetness
     of  commercial rootbeers.  This was made with artificial  carbonation,
     but  it  could be adapted to make alcoholic rootbeer  by  substituting
     malt extract for some of the sugar.

     Author: Bill Crick
     Digest: December 1, 1989, Issue #314

     Ingredients:

                 1/2 pound     fresh ginger, peeled and grated
                 1             lemon
                 5 teaspoons   cream of tarter
                 5 cups        white sugar
                 2-1/2 gallons water

     Procedure:

     This  stuff  is dangerous---do not make it.  WARNINGS: Use  only  real
     champagne  bottles, beer bottles will explode.  If left out of  fridge
     more than 4 weeks, bottles will explode.  Do not leave in fridge  more
     than 4 weeks after bottles start to scare you, otherwise, bottles will
     explode.   Set off outside---corks go 60-70'.  Do not let bottles  sit
     around too long---I'm not kidding!

     Peel  and grate ginger.  Grate lemon, squeeze, and cut remainder  into
     slices.  Boil all ingredients, mixing.  Cool to 80 degrees or less and
     add  lager yeast. Ferment 3-7 days, then bottle in champagne  bottles.
     Wire  down plastic corks.  Leave out 1 week, then move to  cool  area.
     Chill and test open 1 bottle each week until they start to scare  you,
     then put all bottles in fridge and drink within 2 weeks.

     Comments:

     I've  been  making this for many years.  It is  very  carbonated,  and
     quite  refreshing.  Also, because it has a limited shelf  life  (after
     which it explodes), it prompts lots of impromptu ginger beer  parties.
     I  call several friends to say "I'm setting off a dozen  ginger  beers
     tomorrow afternoon. Wanna come?"

     Author: Stephen Hansen  (hansen@gloworm.Stanford.edu)
     Digest: July 18, 1990, Issue #462

     Ingredients:

                        1 can        Blue Ribbon malt
                        1 pack       Fleishmann's yeast
                        1 cup        rice
                        1 tablespoon salt
                        5 pounds     powdered cane sugar

     Procedure:

     In  a large (3 gallon) porcelain pan, add 3 quarts water and bring  to
     boil.   Add sugar, stirring.  Bring back up to boil and add 1  can  of
     malt.  Return to boil again and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Fill large
     glass 1/2 full of luke warm water (not over 130 degrees) and add rice,
     yeast, and salt.

     Clean crock and fill 1/3 full of warm water.  Pour in wort.  Add  cold
     water to within 3 inches of top.  Add yeast solution and cover.  After
     6-10  hours remove foam with wire strainer.  Let sit until  hydrometer
     says "bottle."   Fill bottles, adding 1/2 teaspoon sugar to each.  Cap
     and let stand 21 days.

     Comments:

     Back  when I first started making beer (about 20 years ago now) I  ac-
     tually  made  several batches using this recipe.  The  results  varied
     from barely drinkable to snail bait.  I especially like his comparison
     in  the last line of the original---"This should make 5 cases of  pint
     bottles of beer equal to or superior to Millers High Life."

     Author: Arun Welch  (welch@cis.ohio-state.edu)
     Digest: November 14, 1990, Issue #537

     Ingredients:

                 4 gallons     fresh cider (no Pot.Sorb)
                 5 to 6 pounds honey
                 1 gallon      water
                 1 large stick cinnamon
                 5             cloves
                 2 pods        cardamom
                 2 packs       Red Star Pasteur champagne yeast

     Procedure:

     Simmer the spices in the water for 10 minutes.  Dissolve honey.   Sim-
     mer and strain crud until there isn't any more.  Transfer to  primary,
     along with cider (this should bring primary to a good pitching temper-
     ature).   Pitch yeast and wait 1 to 2 weeks for the foam to die  down.
     Transfer  to secondary.  Ferment in secondary 3-6 months.  Bottle  and
     age another 3 or more months.

     Ingredients:

                        12-1/2 pounds light clover honey
                        4 teaspoons   acid blend
                        5 teaspoons   yeast nutrient
                                      wine yeast

     Procedure:

     Add  honey, acid blend, and yeast nutrient to 2 gallons of  water  and
     boil  for  1/2 hour.  Add this to 1-1/2 gallons of cold water  in  the
     primary  fermenter.   Pitch yeast when the temperature  reaches  70-75
     degrees.  Use a blow off tube if you use a carboy.  Allow fermentation
     to proceed for 3 weeks or more (up to several months).  When the  mead
     becomes fairly clear, rack to secondary.  Attack air-lock.  Leave  the
     mead  to  sit at least 3 weeks.  When yeast settles to bottom  and  is
     clear,  it  is  ready  to bottle.  Adding 3/4 cup  of  corn  sugar  at
     bottling will produce a sparkling mead.  Sparkling meads should not be
     made with an original gravity higher than 1.090.

     Final Gravity:     1.000

     Author: Kevin Karplus  (karplus@ararat.ucsc.edu)
     Digest: November 16, 1990, Issue #538

     Ingredients:

                          3 gallons    water
                          5 pounds     honey
                          1/3 cup      jasmine tea
                          1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
                          2 teaspoons  cinnamon
                          1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
                          1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
                          1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
                                       ale yeast

     Procedure:

     Boil  water,  adding  tea and spices.  Remove from heat  and  stir  in
     honey.   (Some  mead makers boil the honey, skimming the  scum  as  it
     forms).  Cover boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes
     a  long time, so start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter  solu-
     tion by boiling a cup of water and a tablespoon or two of honey.   Add
     starter  to cooled liquid.  Cover and ferment using blow tube or  fer-
     mentation lock.  Rack two or three times to get rid of sediment.

     The less honey, the lighter the drink, and the quicker it can be made.
     1  pound per gallon is the minimum, 5 pounds per gallon is  about  the
     maximum for a sweet dessert wine.  This mead is a metheglin because of
     the  tea. The yeast is pitched one day after starting the  batch,  the
     crud skimmed about 10 days later, then wait 3 days and rack to second-
     ary.  Wait 2 more weeks and bottle---about 4 weeks from start to  fin-
     ish.

     Comments:

     Yield is 3.1 gallons.  Excellent clarity, fairly sweet flavor,  slight
     sediment, light gold color.  An excellent batch.

     Digest: November 16, 1990, Issue #538

     Ingredients:

                      3 gallons    water
                      16 pounds    honey
                      1/4 cup      keemun tea
                      1/4 cup      oolong tea
                      2 teaspoons  cinnamon
                      1/2 teaspoon whole anise seed
                      18 clusters  cardamom, crushed
                      20 allspice, crushed
                      1 inch       galingale root, crushed
                                   yeast
                                   unflavored gelatin (fining)

     Procedure:

     Boil  water,  adding  tea and spices.  Remove from heat  and  stir  in
     honey.   (Some  mead makers boil the honey, skimming the  scum  as  it
     forms).  Cover boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes
     a  long time, so start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter  solu-
     tion by boiling a cup of water and a tablespoon or two of honey.   Add
     starter  to cooled liquid.  Cover and ferment using blow tube or  fer-
     mentation lock.  Rack two or three times to get rid of sediment.

     This  recipe took about 6-1/2 months from brewing to bottling.   First
     rack  took place 15 days after brewing.  2nd rack 3 weeks  later.  3rd
     rack  3 months later.  Gelatin added 1 month later.  Bottled about  2-
     1/2 months later.  Yield 3.7 gallons.

     Comments:

     Sweet, smooth, potent. A dessert wine.  This is perhaps the best of my
     20 or more batches of mead.

     Author: Ye Olde Batte  (mhalley%mun.BITNET)
     Digest: November 31, 1988

     Ingredients:
                                  rose petals
                                  water
                                  sugar
                                  dry yeast

     Procedure:

     Fill  a  glass container with rose petals.  Cover with water  and  let
     set,  covered  by a clean cloth, for 3 days.  Strain water  through  a
     cloth  and  measure.  Add to it, one quarter of its  volume  of  white
     sugar.  Set in a glass jar or crock, add a pinch of dry yeast and stir
     well.  When it is sparkling (3 days to a week), put into beer or cham-
     pagne bottles and cap.  Age 1-6 months.

     Comments:

     This  recipe  comes  from  a booklet  called  The  Delicious  Rose  by
     Geraldine  Duncann.  It was called Rose Melemell, although it  has  no
     honey.  This is an effervescent brew with a hint of summer roses.

     Parts  of this book are rehash of material covered  better  elsewhere,
     such as the basic brewing process and how to serve beer, but the  sec-
     tions  that describe the characteristics that define beer styles  have
     more than enough value to justify buying this book.  If you have  ever
     wondered what exactly makes a porter a porter rather than a stout,  or
     what  the  difference is between a Vienna-style lager  and  a  Maerzen
     beer, then this book is for you.

     The  following  list  of  suppliers  was  compiled  by  Chris  Shenton
     (chris@asylum.gsfc.nasa.gov)  and originally appeared in the  Homebrew
     Digest  Feb 16, 1990.  We extend our heartiest thanks to Chris for the
     effort  he put into this list.  According to Chris, there was once  an
     updated  list, but one hungry tape later, and all his work  was  gone.
     Fortunately the following work has been saved in the archives for  all
     to enjoy.

     INTRODUCTION

     The following lists unit prices for a sample of supplies from a number
     of vendors.  These are only representative data points on some of  the
     more  common  items and should help in deciding where to  shop.   Some
     vendors  sell in small quantities, and some only in large  quantities,
     but  give bulk prices.  Consult the notes following the table for  ad-
     dresses  and information about quantities.  Please send me  any  other
     vendors  you have information about so I can keep this  list  current.
     Thanks for your support.---Chris Shenton

     SELECTION PHILOSOPHY

     I  didn't include most specialty grains (or specialty  items)  because
     they  are ordered in small quantities.   Prices selected are for  low-
     est-cost variety available; for example, if US and German Munich  malt
     is  available, I quote the cheaper US variety.  When price  or  amount
     depends  on quantity ordered, I've tried to select an amount  suitable
     for a couple of batches, because that's the way I would order by mail.
     For  example, if there are 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 Lb bags of grain,  I  used
     the 20 Lb price because that seems like a realistic purchase  quantity
     ---  enough for about two batches.  Likewise, if there's a 6-can  dis-
     count on a case of extract, I quote that price, rather than the higher
     per-can  price.   With hops, same deal: if there were 1, 2, 5,  10  oz
     packs, I'd quote the 5 oz pack price.

     OTHER SUPPLIERS

     There  are  a couple suppliers which do not fit in the  chart  because
     they  specialize  in only one item, or sell  somewhat  unusual  items.
     They  are  included  separately  from the  chart  and  its  addresses.
     (Freshops is force-fit into the chart below, however).

     PERUSAL

     My  guinea pig said he found the raw data too overwhelming  and  would
     prefer  a more iconic style.  Therefore, I've taken my numbers  (price
     per  quantity),  and broken things into intervals,  then  marked  them
     using the familiar $, $$, $$$, $$$$ notation.  Then, for each  suppli-
     er,  I averaged the interval-measure of each available  ingredient  to
     get  an average value for all that supplier's merchandise.   Presented
     in  an iconic form at the extreme right, this shows at a glance  which
     dealers  are expensive (e.g.: Wine & Brew By You) and which are  cheap


                                     152

.


     (e.g.: Green Acres and Brew For Less [I would hope so with a name like
     that!  :-]).   Note  that this ignores  unavailable  ingredients,  and
     therefore variety/selection; companies with only a couple  inexpensive
     items (e.g.: Freshops) come out looking good, too.  After the body  of
     the  chart,  I list the minimum, average, and maximum prices  for  the
     items,  in  dollars per the quantity-measure specified in  the  column
     heading.

     FEEDBACK

     I would be willing to maintain a list of user reports for each vendor.
     Send  me any comments on ones you have dealt with:  price,  knowledge,
     quality,  freshness, turn-around time, etc. I'll compile and send  out
     updates  every now and then.  If you have other vendors I  didn't  in-
     clude, send me a line or two with the prices calculated for the ingre-
     dients in this table. (I can't afford to keep current on all the deal-
     ers!)

     DISCLAIMER

     Some  suppliers  will  have inevitably been  omitted.   These  include
     places  with  no catalog (eg. Col. John's), places  which  charge  for
     catalogs  (eg: Brass Corkscrew / Brewer's Warehouse), and places I  am

     Sells  only  malt ("various strains blended to a  brewmaster  specs").
     His   prices  are  very  good,  and  one  user  (John   Freeman,   aka
     jlf@earth.cray.com) said it was of high quality.  Stew has an informa-
     tive  (lots of low-cost technique and speed-up tips) and somewhat  odd
     `catalog'.   Prices are 32# @ $0.55/Lb; discounts are 5% on 2-3 68  Lb
     parcels, 10% on 4+ 68 Lb parcels.  Postage extra.

                          APPENDIX C: BEGINNERS GUIDE



     I  hope  that the following guide can help some beginners  with  their
     first  batches.  I obviously can't cover every little detail of  home-
     brewing  here, but I have tried to give an easily followed outline  of
     the  process, along with most of the common pitfalls faced  by  begin-
     ners.   I would welcome any comments or criticism on this section,  as
     it will probably appear again, in hopefully better form.
     -Rob  Gardner, Digest Coordinator

     1.  The first thing I recommend to the new brewer is to find a  source
     of  brewing  supplies.  It may be a local brew shop or  a  mail  order
     store.  Check out books on homebrew either at a library or  bookstore.
     The  book I recommend getting is Charlie Papazian's "Complete  Joy  of
     Homebrewing." This is easily one of the best homebrewing books around,
     and  it  is very useful for both beginners  and  experienced  brewers.
     There are lots of other good books around, so don't worry if you can't
     find this one.  One caveat: stay away from books published in the  UK,
     as  these can be confusing and/or misleading for the  beginner.   They
     specify  ingredients that aren't found in the US, and  generally  give
     poor advice, like adding lots of sugar.

     2.   The  next thing to do is buy a kit.  Most brew stores  sell  kits
     that contain everything you need to make your first batch, except  for
     bottles.   They'll cost anywhere from $35-$60 depending on  how  fancy
     they are.  I'd recommend getting a kit that includes a 5 gallon  glass
     carboy  as  well as a plastic pail.  Other useful items that  the  kit
     might  not  include are thermometer and hydrometer.   The  kit  should
     include:  10  gallon plastic pail, siphon  equipment,  bottle  filler,
     bottle brush, bottle caps, bottle capper, fermentation lock,  chlorine
     cleaner,  and perhaps ingredients.  If the kit includes a  carboy,  it
     should also include a short length of plastic hose for the  "blow-by,"
     and a funnel.  There might be some other odd items, such as a stirring
     spoon.   The major difference between one kit and another will be  the
     presence of a glass carboy, so in this article I will indicate when  a
     difference  in technique is called for.  If the kit does  not  include
     ingredients, there are usually several kinds of malt extract to choose
     from.  Try to pick something not too heavy for the first time; a light
     or  amber  ale is a very good choice.  Also try to get a  hopped  malt
     extract the first time to keep it simple.  If none is available,  then
     get  2 ounces of fresh hops if available.  Failing that, get 2  ounces
     of hop pellets.

     3.  Relax, don't worry, and have a homebrew.  Now you are about  ready
     to start brewing.  If possible, it is extraordinarily helpful at  this
     point  to find somebody who's done it before, and have them help  you.
     Doing  this  will greatly improve your chances of  success  the  first
     time,  but don't worry if you can't swing it, your chances  are  still
     pretty good.  Remember to tell yourself, "Relax, don't worry, and have
     a  homebrew."  The first time, ordinary beer will have to do,  but  do
     try  to  drink homebrew whenever you brew---it will help  you  to  not
     worry.  (Worrying can ruin the taste of your homebrew.)

     4. To begin, you'll need a large pot to boil the malt extract in.  The
     pot  should be large enough to hold at least 2 gallons of  water---the
     bigger  the  better.  Fill the pot up about half  way  (whatever  that
     happens  to be) with water and boil it.  The idea is to boil  as  much
     water  as possible, but to have room in the pot for foam that will  be
     produced by boiling.  While the water is heating up, remove the  label
     from the can(s) of malt extract, and put the can(s) in some hot  water
     to  soften the extract.  When the water boils, put in the extract  and
     let  it boil again, stirring frequently so the extract  doesn't  burn.
     When  it comes to a second boil, watch out---it has a strong  tendency
     to  foam  up and make a legendary mess on your stove.  When  the  foam
     rises,  remove the pot from the fire and let it settle down a  minute.
     When  you put it back, it will have (slightly) less tendency  to  boil
     over, but it needs watching.

     5.   If you have hops or hop pellets, add them now, and boil the  wort
     (wort  == unfermented beer) for at least a half hour (an hour is  bet-
     ter.) If you're not using hops, but instead, hopped malt extract, then
     it is not necessary to boil very long---15 minutes is sufficient.

     6.   While  the wort is boiling, you should sanitize  everything  that
     will  come in contact with the beer.  This includes  the  fermentation
     container,  fermentation  lock, utensils, everything.   Sanitizing  is
     done  by  soaking in a solution of water and the  sanitizing  chemical
     that  came  with your kit.  A few teaspoons of household bleach  in  a
     gallon  of  water is quite effective also.  I generally fill  a  large
     bowl  with  bleach solution and throw in everything to  be  sanitized.
     After  sanitizing, rinse well with clean water at least 3 times.   No-
     tice I keep saying "sanitize" and not "sterilize."  Well, it would  be
     nice  if  you could sterilize, but you can't.  Sterilization  is  very
     difficult, i.e., boiling under pressure for an hour, so sanitizing  is
     the  best  we can do.  Needless to say, be careful not to  breath  the
     fumes  or get any sanitizing solution in your eyes.  Sanitizing  might
     sound like a pain, but that's only because it is.  However, it's abso-
     lutely  the most important thing you can do to make your beer  a  suc-
     cess.   You can screw up a dozen other things, but if you keep  every-
     thing  clean, you'll still liable to brew a good beer.  But if  you're
     not  sanitary,  the  finest ingredients and techniques  won't  help  -
     you'll brew quite undrinkable beer.

     7.  Now put about 2 gallons of cold water into your fermenter, and add
     the  boiled wort.  A funnel is handy at this point if you are using  a
     carboy.  If your boiling pot is very large, use less than 2 gallons---
     remember,  we're  eventually making 5 gallons.  (Do not pour  the  hot
     wort directly into a carboy without cold water in it---you are  likely
     to crack the glass!) If you added hops, you'll want to use a  strainer
     to  remove them, but don't worry if you don't get them all.  Now  fill
     your  fermenter up to 5 gallons with cold water.  If you're using  the
     plastic  pail,  it helps if you've previously marked where  5  gallons
     occurs---a magic marker works well.  If you're using a carboy, fill it
     up  to several inches from the top.  Depending on how much  water  you
     boiled,  the  temperature  of the wort might be too high  to  add  the
     yeast.  If so, let it cool until it is below 90 degrees F.




                                     170

.


     8.   Now the packet of yeast may be added to the wort.  If  you  like,
     you  can "start" the yeast.  I usually do this to give it  a  "running
     start"  and also simply to be sure that the yeast is good.   To  start
     the yeast, sanitize a bottle, and mix 2 teaspoons of corn sugar with a
     half cup of 80 degree water, and add the yeast.  Stick a  fermentation
     lock on top and let it sit while the wort cools.  By the time the wort
     is cooled, the yeast starter should be busy fermenting, and you should
     see bubbles percolating through the fermentation lock.  Now just  dump
     the yeast mixture into the wort.  If you're using a carboy, be careful
     when filling it with water to leave room in it for the yeast mixture.

     9.  After the yeast is added, put the lid on the plastic fermenter and
     attach  the fermentation lock.  Don't forget to put some water in  the
     lock.   If  you're using a carboy, force the short  piece  of  plastic
     tubing  through  the stopper a little bit, and put it on  the  carboy.
     Place  the other end of the tube in a bucket of water.  This  type  of
     fermentation  lock is known as a "blow-by," and is  necessary  because
     the  fermentation will produce lots of foam and sludge, and it has  no
     place to go except out.  If you used an ordinary lock, it would quick-
     ly fill up with garbage.  In a plastic pail, there is plenty of  space
     for the foam to grow.

     10.   Now put the whole thing into a cool, dark, place to let it  fer-
     ment.   Dark is important because sunlight can damage the beer.   Cool
     is  important because beer-fouling organisms don't thrive as  well  at
     lower  temperatures.  Room temperature is usually fine---about 70  de-
     grees F.  If you can get it to 65 or 60, that would be better.   Don't
     make  it  colder than 60, however, because then the yeast  won't  work
     very well.  (Most beginners will be using top fermenting yeast,  which
     works  best  at 60 degrees and above.  Bottom fermenting  yeast  works
     fine  all the way down to freezing.) If you can't get the  temperature
     below  80, then you should look for a better place to keep your  beer.
     If  you are using the carboy method, check the bucket daily for  over-
     flow.   Signs of fermentation should appear within a couple of  hours,
     and by the next morning, it should be fermenting madly.

     11.   After  a few days, it will start to slow down, and  will  finish
     sometime between 4 and 10 days after you began.  If you are using  the
     carboy and blow-by, replace the blow-by with a fermentation lock  when
     it  stops  blowing out garbage and starts blowing only  bubbles.   How
     will  you  know when it's done fermenting? If you like, you  can  take
     hydrometer  readings, and wait until it stabilizes (same reading on  3
     consecutive  days.) However, I've found it works just as well  to  ob-
     serve the frequency of the bubbles in the airlock.  When you watch it,
     but  don't see any bubbles for a few minutes, it's quite ready  to  be
     bottled.   When  it finishes fermenting, you don't have to  bottle  it
     immediately, but it's best to bottle it within 3-4 weeks of beginning.

     12.  The first step in bottling is to acquire bottles.  Go to a liquor
     store  or bar and pay $2.50 for 2 cases of empty deposit bottles.   Do
     not  use the throwaway kind with the screw-off tops, as these are  not
     strong enough.  Chances are the bottles will be pretty scummy, so pour
     an  inch or two of strong bleach solution into each, and let them  sit
     for an hour.  Then rinse them well, using your bottle brush if  neces-
     sary, and your bottle washer if you have one (see issue #1.)


                                     171

.



     A  simple time saver is to go to your favorite drinking  establishment
     and find out from the barkeep when the distributor picks up the  empty
     bottles  and then show up the day after to pick up the cases  of  emp-
     ties.  You will have less crud in the bottom of the bottles if you  do
     this.  Also ask for bottles with paper labels.  Soak the bottles in  a
     bleach  solution  and the labels will be floating in 12 to  24  hours.
     Load  your dishwasher up with your bottles, turn on the sanitize  set-
     ting (or `HEAT WATER'), and let run through two or three rinse cycles.
     PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY SOAP.  It clings to the glass.  ---Ed.

     13.   If you fermented your beer in a carboy, siphon(*) the beer  into
     the sanitized plastic pail, and add a boiled solution of 3/4 cup  corn
     sugar  and  water.   If you used the pail to ferment,  then  you  must
     "prime" the bottles with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of sugar each.  This  added
     sugar  is  what produces the carbonation in the bottles.  Do  not  use
     more  than 1 cup per 5 gallons or 1 teaspoon per bottle, or  you  risk
     the danger (and social embarrassment) of exploding bottles.

     14.   Now fill the bottles with the siphon and bottle filler, and  cap
     them.  Store at room temperature for at least a week, then try to move
     the  beer  someplace  a  little cooler.  (I  keep  mine  underneath  a
     window.) The beer should be drinkable 3 weeks after bottling,  depend-
     ing  on ingredients.  You might want to try a bottle every week  after
     bottling just to taste the changes that occur.

     *  siphoning: don't suck on the tube to start it, that will  introduce
     lots  of bacteria into the beer.  A good trick is to fill  the  siphon
     with  water  to start it.  Remember that the level of  liquid  in  the
     source  container  must be higher off the ground than the top  of  the
     destination container in order for the siphon to work.

     Now don't rush to brew the second batch quite yet.  Why not wait a few
     weeks  and see how the first turned out? That way, if you  really  did
     something  wrong,  you have a chance to find out what, and  avoid  the
     problem in the second batch.

     Good luck!
