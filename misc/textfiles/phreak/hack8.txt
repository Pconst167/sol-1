BELLCORE Information          by The Mad Phone-man
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, You've broken into the big phone box on the wall, and are looking at
a bunch of tags with numbers and letters on them. Which one is the modem
line? Which one is the 1-800 WATTS line? Which one is the Alarm Line?
Bell has a specific set of codes that enable you to identify what you're
looking at. These are the same codes the installer gets from the wire
center to enable him to setup the line, test it, and make sure it matches
the customers order. Here are some extracts from the Bellcore book.

First lets take a Hypothetical Line number I'm familiar with:
     64FDDV 123456
-------------------------------------------------------------
The serial number format:

        Prefix +  service code + modifier +   serial number +
digits:  1,2         3,4           5,6       7,8,9,10,11,12    continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Suffix    +   CO assigning circut number +   segmet
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   digits:  13,14,15            16,17,18,19              20,21,22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Important shit is in the 3d thru 6th digit.

----------------------------------------




So 64FDDV would be a private line data circut terminating at a radio common
carrier. Other examples can be decoded likewise.
