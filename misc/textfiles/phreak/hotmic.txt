******************************************************************************
Well, I guess that covers everything. I am serious about not being liable for
damages, too. You could screw a lot of things up with this stuff, so I sure as
hell hope you have enough intelligence to bullshit your way out of sticky
situations. But the best advice is don't get caught. This is primarily meant
for information on possible ways crooks can tap your line(or the government,
same thing!!), but if you use these techniques personally, I suggest having
escapes...
        Anyway, I guess I'll start with hot-mics. At least that's what I heard
they're called. They are made up of a few cheap components, and very easy to 
make, requiring little skill(Hell, I can do it!). There are many types, but I
will just cover the primary ones:

With a Resister only:
        Well this is by far the simplest method of bugging any phone. The basic
principle is that by placing a resister over the hookswitch, enough power will
be let through to power the microphone in the phone, but not enough to make the
phone go "off-hook" The best way to do this is probably with a 10k ohm 
resister, which are availible in 2-packs at radio shack for about 69›. Simply
attach the resister to each side of one of the hookswitches(I suggest soldering)
and you can pick up the signal at another point on the line via a mini-amp
(will be explained later). You can also try using different strength resisters,
the less powerful the resister, the stronger the sound. You will be able to hear
room noise with this one.

With a resister and a capacitor:
        Use a 10k ohm resister, and a .47 uf, or 1 uf capacitor. Place these in 
parallel across a hookswitch as in above. The capacitor should have a rating of
200 volts or more. The capacitor is also availible in radio shack, a pack of 2
being less than a dollar. room audio comes in stronger with this one.

Picking up the line:
        Okay, well to tell the truth, I haven't gotten either of the above scams
to work, but this one is easy and surely works. The above things may or may not
work, but they probably DO, so you should probably try them. I probably have
trouble because I've only done the first one, which is less powerful than the
second. So now, let's get down to this listening business. All you need is a
mini-amp, availible at, yes, radio shack, for about 11.95. I can'tgive you the
exact cat. number, but it is a little beige thing, usually on display somewhere
You will also need a .022 uf capacitor, a small length of phone cord, and either
a mono female to male adapter, or a mono cord with one male end. They can be
stereo too, but the amplifier is only mono. they can also be either 1/8" or 1/4"
but the input on the mini amp is 1/8", so get an adapter if you get a 1/4"...
alright, now to connect the phone line to the amp, cut off one end of the phone
line, and strip the red and green wires inside(there should also be a black wire
and a yellow wire). Connect the capacitor to the red wire and one of the
contacts on the adapter or cable(you should strip the cable, or remove the cover
to the adapter, dur!) Connect the green wire to the other contact on the adapter
I soldered them and ti works great, but you don't have to. Now, obviously, you
need to plug the adapter into the mini amp, and the phone line into a jack. You
should now be able to listen in on any phone conversations, and if you have one 
of the above hot-mics installed, you should be able to hear room conversations.

        I hope this file helps you to find any bugs, or to build anything you
might need. Have phun!!!
