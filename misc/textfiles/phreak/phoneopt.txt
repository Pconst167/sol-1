    Call Control Options..some things we will come to see here in St. Louis.
 
         Call Return: by pressing *69, (1169 on rotary dials), customers can
return the last local incoming call.  This service means fewer mad dashes
from the shower to answer a ringing phone before the caller hangs up.
 
         Call Cue:  By pressing *66, (1166 on rotary dials), customers can
avoid getting repeated busy signals.  Busy local numbers are redialed as many
times as it takes to get an answer, for as long as 30 minutes.  A special
ring is the cue when the line is free.  Call Cure allows customer to perform
other activities while their phone monitors their line for them.
 
         Priority Call: By pressing *61 (1161 on rotary dials), customers can
confidently answer--or ignore--their ringing phones.  A special ring tells
them when a call they want is coming through.  (Three local number can be
designated as priority.) Less importatn calls can wait for a better time.
 
         Call Blocker: By pressing *60 (1160 on rotary dials), customers can
avoid inconvenient--and even unwelcome--calls.  As many as three local
numbers can be blocked at any given time (except in Missouri, where six
numbers can be blocked).
 
         Call Trace: By pressing *57 (1157 on rotary dials), customers can
gain a new defense against harrassing calls.  That stepinitiates a race of
most local calls and customers may request that the calling number, date and
time be given to law enforcement officials for further investigation.
 
         Selective Call Forwarding: (Only available in selected Oklahoma
exchanges.) By pressing *63, (1163 on rotary dials), up to three numbers can
be selected for forwarding to another telephone number.  Only these calls
will get through to the designated number.
 
    These services where first offered in cities that had single central
offices.  Call Control Options are going to be introduced into Southwestern
Bell's 12 major metropoliatian areas as soon as possible.
    The technology that enables SWBT to offer CCOs is known as Signaling
System 7 (SS7).  Special SS7 software lets central offices "talk" to
each other.  The central offices become part of an intelligent network that
sets up a signaling path.
