                              Documentation
    
        Congratulations, you now own the best Fone-Code Hacker 
    around.  I have pulled ideas from several sources as well as 
    plenty of my own to devise this code scanner, most notably:
    Peter King for the Carrier Detect variable formula,
    Floppy Disk for part of the random selection sequence.

        This program is in general release as of 6/12/85, 
    versions prior to 4.0, were for friends etc for testing 
    purposes.  As of version 4.1 there are no known bugs, however 
    should you find one, I would appreciate feedback so that I 
    can correct them.   
                
        In the program itself, you will find 4 screens of help 
    and info, but this is to fill in the blanks that I had no 
    room to cover.
        
        Basically if you are confused about the three modes, here 
    is a quick rundown: 
    
    SEQENTIAL will start at a code you define like 205100 and try 
    every code to the ending try that you define like 206700.  
    You can set it to try every code in that range or every other 
    or every 3rd etc.

    RANDOM will pick random numbers of the length that you 
    define, length of 5. or 6 or 8 etc.  In this mode, you can 
    set the first digit to use.  If you were to set the first 
    digit to 8 then all codes tried would start with 8 as in:
    801245,836501 or to 43 as in 436735,431072. If you set the 
    first digit to a 2 digit number as in 43 above, when asked 
    for the length of the code, it is still 6....the program will 
    recognize that you really are setting the first 2 digits.
    
    SYSTEMATIC is quite esoteric,yet helpful and is almost 2 scanners 
    in one.  I have found it helpful quite often in scanning for a 
    group of numbers clustered "under" a specific first digit, or to 
    determine the actual code length.  
    
    Scanning First Digit: Here, you set a number of tries and a first 
    digit range as in 100 tries on digits 2 - 7.  What happens is that 
    the dialer will try 100 random tries as 2xxxxx, then 100 tries as 
    3xxxxx and 100 tries as 4xxxxx etc...Note that the 100 tries 
    becomes 600 tries!!!!
    Scanning for Code Length: In this fashion, you will set the code 
    length range to scan as in 4 - 7, which says that you want to scan 
    a set of 4, 5, 6 and 7 digit codes (as in 2386,45391,587420 and 
    4756312 respectively).  Next, the scanner will apply 50 or 100 or 
    whatever you specify as number of tries to each code length (100 4 
    digit tries then 100 5 digit tries etc).  Since the object is to 
    determine the actual code length, the scanning will terminate 
    after 3 codes are found (just enough to find and verify the 
    length).

    Note that since the number of tries is applied to EACH integer in 
    the range, the Code Length scanning would be prepared to actually 
    run 400 codes thru the Service Access Number.

        The program should run on any variety of modems as long 
    as they are 100% Hayes compatible as I utilize several AT 
    commands.  The timer is quite accurate and the scanning 
    results are accurate.  If you turn off the speaker, it remains 
    off until the end of the program, that is, if you break the 
    program, the Y/N modem speaker is not a toggle.  This is 
    doubly true with internal, board level modems.  On these, if 
    you break (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Brk) the program, the modem speaker 
    will remain off until you send the modem a ATZ.  Otherwise 
    the program will do this for you.
                                         
        The other thing is that if the screen gets filled with codes 
    (about 50), and they are cleared to make room for more, there is 
    no sequence to reprint them as yet.  They are therefore lost 
    unless the disk save or printer is on.  They ARE in memeory 
    (dimension of 250) but there is no recall to screen yet.  You 
    should have such problems.
                                         
        The scanner could also be used to find 800 extenders by 
    keying 1800 as the access number, and setting the code length to 
    7.  You would have to listen for probable tones, but it could 
    be done.  This would scan 1800xxxxxxx but could not record a 
    carrier since there is no target modem. 

        By the by, the Sequential mode is great for testing.  Set the  
    Access number, then set the first code to try as 1 before a known 
    code, and end 1 after the known code.  Running a known code thru 
    it will show you the screen,LOF, printer display and/or Disk file
    headers.

        Some helpful aspects of the dialer:  1) At the end of the 
    run, the clock will display the time that the the last code 
    was tried.  This is neat if you let it run all by itself, you 
    can come back to determine how long a given number of codes 
    take.  2) You can set the dialer to stop after X number of 
    contacts.  This is helpful if you really just want 5 codes 
    for the month, it will stop when it has that many rather than 
    dial the remaining tries that you had set.  This can help 
    prevent having a Trouble Card dropped on you for making 4000 
    800 calls when the last 3000 were not really needed.

        I do not yet know the program requirements, but this was 
    written on:

    IBM-PC, 2 drives, 512k, DOS 2.0, BASICA 
    Hayes Modem, Touch tone dialing.  It DOES utilize AT commands so 
    the modem must be Hayes compatible.
    
    Compiled with the BASIC Compiler and converted into .COM with 
    SPACEMKR.COM (saves about 13% of the space).
