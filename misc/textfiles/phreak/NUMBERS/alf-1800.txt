
	-* SPECIAL NEWS RELEASE FROM THE ANTI-BELL GROUP *-

   		  RELEASED ON AUGUST 6 1994

  The following 'special' 1-800 phone numbers are usable by any 
  Canadian/USA hacker/phreaker to directly contact the operators in
  the following 49 countries.  These 1-800 dial directly to the
  operator of the country of destination and bypass the Canadian
  phone system.  

  This means that in any of these countries where you can use TONES
  to break the line and seize the phone system from the OPERATOR you
  can become the operator and make world wide phone calls at the
  expense of the originating countries phone system.
 
  These numbers should only be used by those phreakers who have
  experience at TONES and seizing the phone lines from the 
  operator.  These numbers were all valid as of August 6 1994 !
 
  These phone numbers are also of interest to anyone who has phone
  access that will permit them to call into Canada and divert onto
  these numbers.   Americans take note that you must first get hold
  of a number originating in CANADA to use these 1 800's to dial out.
  They will not work directly from within the United States although
  I assume that there must be something like these 1 800's that can
  be dialed directly from within the United States.   So until you
  Yanks find the numbers that work from within the States, call up
  to a Canadian divertor and than use these to make the world your
  playground courtesy of Bell Stentnor Group.

  

  REMEMBER - these 1-800's only work if you are originating your
	     call from a phone in Canada or diverting from a phone
             in CANADA
           - these numbers bypass the Canadian phone system
             and put you through directly to the OPERATOR
             in the country you are calling
	   - many countries are hip to the old 2600 tone tricks
   	     but some are still pretty stupid - look at Denmark
	     and Spain as two primary examples of countries that
   	     still fall for the TONE tricks ahahahah

	Enjoy and have fun with these 1 800 numbers dudes...  and let
	Ma Bell know you appreciate this 'convenient' way of allowing
        Canadian hackers/phreakers to gain easy access to the phone
	systems of the countries listed above.  	

	And remember, only use and abuse these 1 800's if you know how
        to use tones to seize a phone line from an operator.  The last
        thing we need are some wienies phucking around on these 1 800's
        who don't know what they are doing...
