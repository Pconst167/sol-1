               "Loops I've Known and Loved"
 
     No self-respecting Phone Phreak can go through life without 
knowing what a loop is, how to use one, and the types that are 
available.  The loop is a great alternate communication medium 
that has many potential uses that haven't even been tapped yet. 
In order to explain what a loop is, it would be helpful if you 
would visualize two phone numbers (lines) just floating around in 
the Telco central office.  Now, if you (and a friend perhaps) 
were to call these two numbers at the same time, POOOOFFFF!!!, 
you are now connected together.  I hear what you're saying out 
there ..., "Big deal" or "Why should mother bell collect two 
MSU's (message units) for one lousy phone call!?"  Well ... think 
again.  Haven't you ever wanted someone to call you back, but 
were reluctant to give out your home phone number (like the last 
time you tried to get your friends' unlisted number from the 
business office)?  Or how about a collect call to your frie.d 
waiting on a loop, who will gladly accept the charges?  Or better 
yet, stumbling a loop that you discover has multi-user capability 
(for those late-night conference).  Best of all is finding a non- 
supervised loop that doesn't charge any MSU's or tolls to one or 
both parties.  Example: many moons ago, a loop affectionately 
known as 'The 332 Loop' was non-sup on one 'side'.  I had my 
friend in California dial the free (non-sup) side, (212) 332 - 
9906 and I dialed the side that charged, 332-9900.  As you can 
see, I was charged one MSU, and my friend was charged zilch, for 
as long as we wished to talk!!! 
     Ahhhh .... have I perked your intrest yet?  If so, here is 
how to find a loop of your very own.  First, do all of your loop 
searching at NIGHT!  This is because the loops serve a genuine 
test function which Telco uses during the day.  (We don't want to 
run into an irate lineman now, do we?)  To find a loop, having 
two phone numbers is a definite plus.  If not, get a friend to 
dial numbers at his location.  Last resort, try dialing from two 
adjacent pay phones.  Now, get your trusty white pages, and turn 
to the page where it lists Metro NY exchanges and the number of 
MSU's from your exchange.  The idea is to get a loop that is only 
one MSU from your calling area so you don't go bankrupt trying to 
find a working one.  So write down in a list all of these 
exchanges.  The following are common loop endings (EXC stands for 
the exchange): 
 
Manhatten and The Bronx ---------- EXC - 
 9977 & EXC - 9979 
Brooklyn and Queens -------------- EXC - 
 9900 & EXC - 9906 
 
     Armed with the preceding info, dial the tone side of a loop. 
This would be the 9906 or 9979 side.  The best thing that could 
happen now is that you will be able to hear yourself, or friend 
through the loop connection.  Eureka, you've found a loop!!! 
Unfortunately, this doesn't happen too often.  Here are the more 
common possibilites: 
 
1. You can hear through the loop (not muted) but there is a 1/2 
   second click every 10 seconds that interrupts the audio.  Good 
   for backup use, but the %&%$%%! click is super annoying. 
 
2. One side of the loop is busy; try it again later. 
 
3. The tone disappears, but you cannot hear through it (the loop 
   is muted, try again in a month or so). 
 
4. You get "The number you have reached" recording.  No more 
   loop in that exchange, go on to next. 
 
     Most loops fall into catagory #3, but they do become unmuted 
from time to time.  Once you have found a loop, its uses are 
only limited to your imagination.  If you discover any novel uses 
for loop lines, I am always willing to learn, so leave them for 
me here on *MOM*.

Official Phreddy Loop -------(212) 452 - 9900, 9906

The preceding article was duplicated from one posted on Modem 
Over Manhatten (MOM).  MOM is no longer in operation, however 
was one of the first bulletin boards (after 8BBS) to support 
phreeking.   The original author of this article was the one and 
only Phred Phreek.  Note that the comments at the end of the 
article no longer apply, as this article was written in 1981, and 
Phred Phreek has not been heard of since MOM went down. 
 
 
HERE ARE SOME NEW LOOPS. ALL ARE IN THE 212 AREA. ON ANY GIVEN 
DAY OR NITE SEVERAL MAY BE BUSY,(MORE OFTEN CASUAL USERS THAN  
TELCO PERSONNEL.) AND ON ANY GIVEN DAY OR NITE SEVERAL MAY BE  
INOPERATIVE. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER TELCO MAINTENANCE PERSONELL 
REMEMBER TO 'THROW THE KEY' WHEN THEYRE DONE LINE TESTING. IF THEY
REMEMBER TO TO TURN A LINE 'OFF', THEN IT'LL REMAIN OFF TILL THE
NEXT MAINTENANCE TECH. FORGETS TO TURN IT OFF AFTER USING IT.  DO
NOT ASSUME THESE ARE FRREE CALLS. UNLESS THE #'S ARE IN YOUR
PRIMARY CALLING AREA,YOU ARE BILLED EITHER MSU'S OR TOLL UNITS
DEPENDING UPON DISTANCE. NEVERTHELESS LOOPS ARE LOTS OF FUN,AND
YOU CAN OFTEN MEET NEW PEOPLE ON THEM. ESPECIALLY LATE ON WEEKEND
NITES. ALSO, LATE ON WEEKEND NITES YOU WILL FIND SEVERAL OF THE
LOOPS BEING USED BY AM, FM OR SHORTWAVE PIRATE RADIO STATIONS FOR
CALL IN LINES. MOST OF THESE STATIONS ARE IN THE N.Y. AREA, BUT THE
REMAINDER ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  212 LOOPS REMAIN THE BEST
KNOWN IN THE PIRATE RADIO WORLD,AND SO ARE USED BY PIRATES EVERYWHERE. 
NOW...HERE GOES WITH THE LOOPS: 
 
   212-529-9900/9906 
   212-283-9977/9979 
   212-352-9900-9906 
   212-220-9977/9979 
   212-365-9977/9979 
   212-562-9977/9979 
   212-982-9977/9979 
   212-986-9977/9979 
 
THE LOWER NUMBER IS THE ONE WITH THE SQUEAL. IT SQUEALS (SINGING 
SWITCH) TILL SOMEONE DIALS THE OTHER NUMBER IN THE PAIR. THEN  
THE SQUEAL DIES AND YOURE CONNECTED. NOE THE HIGHER NUMBER NEVER 
DOES SQUEAL, EVEN IF THE OTHER PART OF THE PAIR IS UNUSED. SO YOU 
HAVE TO KINDA GUESS AT WHEN SOMEONE IS SWITCHED IN AFTER DIALING. 
LISTEN FOR THE CLICKS,THATLL TELL YOU. THE 982 AND 986 #'S ARE KINDA 
WIERD. NORMALLY IF YOU PARK ON A LOOP, YOU WILL HEAR WHOEVERCALLS THE 
OTHER HALF,AND WHEN THEYRE DONE,THE NEXT CALLER(IF ANY) WILL BE QUEUED 
IN, ONE AFTER THE OTHER. NOW ON THE 982 AND 986, YOU SOMETIMES CANT 
GET ANY MORE CALLERS AFTER THE FIRST. FURTHERMORE, IF YOU PARK ON 
THESE TWO LOOPS AND THE OTHER END REMAINS UNCALLED FOR 4 MINUTES, 
YOU MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTED. YET THESE LOOPS ARE BETTER THAN
NOTHING NG-ESP. ON WEEKENDS WHEN ALL OTHER LOOPS ARE BUSY....... 
IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LOOPS IN OTHER AREA CODES, PLEASE LEAVE THEM, 
EITHER IN BULL. OR LV. A MESSAGE FOR DARK PRIEST. THANKING YOU  
IN ADVANCE, AND ENJOY YOUR LOOPS.
