Welcome to The Carrier Wave <TCW>.  Attached is Issue One in ASCII format.
TCW is primarily distributed in a printed hard-copy format.  This is a
mere beautified-ASCII rendition of it, so all frames, formats, effects,
tables, illustrations etc have been eliminated.

The Carrier Wave is published approximately quarterly.
Subscriptions are on a per-issue basis at $4.00 per issue.  TCW is
$4.00 per issue through subscription, newstand, or if you get it
directly from me.

For a subscription, mail $16.00 for four issues to our address.  For every
printed issue that you are sent, you will receive the electronic
version <this> emailed to you if you wish.

See the end of this document for further subscription information.

Keep in mind that the printed version looks much much much nicer than
this ASCII version.  It is printed on 11"x17" paper folded in half like
a book, so it's 8.5"x11" -- standard letter paper size.

|   From the Editor
|
|   (Light Ray Speaks)


Greetings everyone, and welcome to our zine.  This magazine has
existed for a long, long time, in the back of my brain where I
keep track of things I'd like to do someday.  Bucket Man and I
both wanted a zine.  Not a zine but a Magazine.  Well, Bucket
Man disappeared from the online world and now I have finally
gotten around to getting something started.

The ball actually started rolling at Boy Scout Camp as I sat on
a cot in a canvas tent and told stories of the exotic world of
artificial life and clipper chips, tales from the Digital
Frontier.  The audience was captivated! Well, at least
interested enough to stay and listen.  Ages ranged from 12 years
old to 17, but they were interested, and that's what counts.
They wanted to know more.  So I revived the magazine idea.  I
wanted to create a "Beginner's Guide to Everything."  Now, I'm
not sure what I have created.   I have here collected a mix of
material of interest to the newbie, to the hacker, to the
general computer user, and to the non-computer person.  I hope
you enjoy what you see here.  In any case, send your
complements, flames, and whatnot to me at
dr261@cleveland.freenet.edu.  (Note: Freenet does mean that it's
free, but please note that I'm not in Cleveland.)  I'm really
not sure what The Carrier Wave is or what it will become, for
that largely depends on the feedback that I receive.   It has
been my experience that diversity often means being mediocre in
all areas while specialization is to excel in one area.
However, for now, our credo remains the same: "Anything that's
neat."

Light Ray's Opinions on the State Of The Underground

The "underground" is in a sort of identity crisis it seems.
There is a flood of new, self-proclaimed "hackers" created when
the generic Jr. High kid gets a modem, an America Online
subscription, and a sees The Net or Hackers or a similar movie.
These new "hackers" clash with the old breed of true hackers,
they pollute the digital atmosphere and give Hackers a bad name.
 Hopefully this is a fad that will pass, although for now it is
a reality and is rather annoying.  The day after Hackers came
out, someone called me asking for "Passwords."  Hmph.  Perhaps
"God" and "Secret" didn't work for him.  Several days ago, an
acquaintance (not to be confused with friend) of mine stopped me
as I crusaded through the campus wielding a video camera for
Television & Video Productions.   Secretively, he drew a small
Radio Shack minicassette recorder from his pocket, presenting it
as if I should be struck with awe and wonder.  Slyly, he pressed
play, and five pulses of 1100hz+1700hz enshrouded in static
burst from the puny speaker, and I was supposed to be impressed.
Hmph. Just about everyone has a red box these days, and 90% of
them do not know how it works nor built it themselves.  Ever
wonder why America Online is doing so well?

Don't be a Lamer

If you don't know what a newbie is, then you are one.  A newbie
is someone who is new to something, specifically, in this case,
computers, digital networks, hacking, etc.  For you, read
onward. Read Pazuzu's beginner's introduction to the computer
underground, the Def Con stories, the STUPH Hotel San Remo hack
story, the Red Box story, and everything else.  Although it's
slightly dry and boring, you MUST read my introduction to number
bases if you don't know what 0x01AB34F means.  Start out on the
right foot.  If you have any questions, do some research on the
topic.  If you still don't have the answer, ask!  The address
for TCW is on the cover!  Just remember, hacking is not
destructive or malicious.  Hacking is exploration and pursuit of
knowledge, going where no one has gone before.  Hacking is
"pushing the edge of the envelope."

 Las Vegas, NV - August 4 to 6, 1995 - Tropicana Hilton


We partied, we hacked, we talked, we listened.  We explored the
hidden reaches of the hotel, displayed a "Hackers Rule"  banner
on 1000 TV's, operated a pirate radio station (KDNA 104.7), had
a scavenger hunt, made wacky slime, played Hacker Jeopardy; we
were at Def Con III, a hacker's conference put on by The Dark
Tangent.



The 1995 DefCon 3 Hotel San Remo Entertainment system Hack

Presented by StUpH!


"First, they cracked into the hotel television system,
reprogramming it to scroll message reading 'Hacker's Rule'
across screens in 1,000 rooms." -- The Associated Press

I (Serum), Nocturne, and Heckler of STUPH (Small Town
Underground Phreakers and Hackers) had been wardialing all of
the 739 #'s while staying at the Tropicana.  We had found
numerous UNIX systems, but had been unable to penetrate any of
them.  Then, one of the dial-ins gave this prompt:

        Lodgenet!login:

Of course, I tried 'lodgenet' as the login, and lo and behold it
worked... Great security, huh? :)

We found out that we were in the Hotel San Remo, which is a
couple hotels down from the Tropicana, really close by. We were
then confronted with a main menu of sorts, there were four
different places one could go:


        Front-Office Menu

        Administration Menu

        Systems Maintenance

        Installation Menu

Unfortunately, each one of these menus were also password
protected... but at the bottom of the screen a 1-800 number was
left for tech support I proceeded to call the number and was
greeted by a friendly female operator...

"Lodgenet Support, this is Nancy. (I don't remember the name,
but Nancy sounds good)"

"Hello Nancy, this is Bruce Jenkins of the Hotel San Remo, and
I'm having trouble with the lodgenet system here.  For some
reason the password isn't working, I got by the lodgenet part of
course, but for some reason it isn't letting me into the Front
Office Menu, is there something I'm doing wrong?"

"Hmmm...  did you try FOF?  Or are you using BOF instead?" <Not
only does she give me the front office password, but the one to
the other sections as well... :) >

"I  thought I typed in FOF, I dunno..."

"Well, let me give it a shot..." <I hear some keystrokes and a
modem in the background, dialing the number> "It looks like it's
working to me..."

"I musta just made a typo, sorry to bother you..."

"No problem, if you need any more assistance, just give us a
call..."

BINGO We proceeded to call it back up and got into the front
office menu and the administration menu, the other two were of
no real interest to us, especially after we started playing with
the movies... :)

All you had to do was know a room number.  I think we used 150,
and found out that some guy had censored his TV so that it only
showed G rated things, we just couldn't pass that up so we
ordered a nice movie to his room and took away all of his
restrictions...  'BreastMan 5' suddenly appeared on his screen
for the easily payable price of $7.95... :)

We then found an option to edit the scroll message, and we put
up an advertisement for our hacking group...  We wanted badly to
see what had popped up on their screens so we went over to the
Hotel San Remo and checked it out for ourselves...  Walking
through the casinos at night and being the only three minors in
that area we felt kinda sheepish... :) But, we found a TV screen
by the Sports area (I'm not sure how to describe this area) and
we waited for the scrolly to appear, but to our dismay it never
did.  So, we went back to the Tropicana disappointed, but not
disheartened...  We then found an option to 'Edit Information
Channel', and that sounded good to us...  But, it was also
password protected... So, Nocturne called the 1-800 service this
time and just asked for the password to the Information Channel
cuz we didn't want to waste time trying to brute force it when
the helpful people at lodgenet just give away their passwords...
 Simply enough, the password was: 'edit' :)  So, we got into the
information channel and found we had complete control over what
was aired on that channel...  So we made a big advertisement for
StUpH and for DefCon 3 at the Tropicana... Satisfied, Heckler
and I went back to the Hotel San Remo one last time, and I
looked like a fool changing the TV to the info channel,
especially when a security guard walked right in front of us...
We waited and, BINGO! up popped a glorious message:


        Meet Uber  haqerz!
        See Serum, Heckler and
        Nocturne of STUPH!
        DefCon 3 at Tropicana!
        Ph3aR StUpH!

Heckler snapped two photos, waited some, then when it popped up
again we got two more... There you have it...  the 1995 DefCon 3
Hotel San Remo Entertainment system hack presented by StUpH!

Heckler (heckler@iastate.edu) is 18 and is a Freshman in college
this year.  He is currently unemployed in hopes of keep his
grades up.  He specializes in coding small programs for the PC
and coming up with lame ideas that always get shot down by
Serum.  (Thanks grease!) He has been hacking since the age of 11
when his parents bought him his neat-o C64 with a 300 baud
modem.  He is known for being very facetious and having no
morals.  He also likes to listen to heavy metal music and other
funky stuff like KMFDM, Hole, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Nine Inch
Nails and White Zombie.  Right now he is working with Serum and
Nocturne on a program called MARCUS for IBM Compatibles. This
program uses a special scripting language to simulate any
text-based remote dialup and is capable of intercepting the
logins and passwords of the people who use that dialup. Serum
(bmeader@nyx10.cs.du.edu) is an 18 year old stud/Freshman in
college this year.  Currently, Serum is in transition from his
job at a local theatre to perhaps a job at a local Software Etc.
depending on the flexibility of the schedule.  He specializes in
the so called 'Field Activities' of hacking and phreaking and
has an uncanny knack of guessing passwords.  The motivator of
StUpH, he is always pushing Heckler and Nocturne to get them to
do very crazy and suicidal jobs.  His specialties include:
Social Engineering, organizing ideas for things for the group to
do, beige'topping', and helping develop MARCUS by creating
'BoxTrakker' a phone box tracking program.  He began to look for
people to hack and phreak with about three years ago, and was
fortunate enough to come across Heckler, who had already been on
the warez scene for a while, and Nocturne, an impressionable
classmate who learned quickly about the ways of Serum and
Heckler and has been an important member ever since.  He has
been hacking for about 3 years, but has been using computers
since the 2nd grade when he received his first Vic-20!   His
musical interests range from R.E.M to Nirvana, while his other
true love is the sport of basketball, where he will be competing
this year at the position of point guard. Nocturne, aka Cal
Ripkin, (nocturne@iastate.edu) is an 18 year old freshman in
college.  He began his road to complete corruption when he met
Serum in high school and was introduced to the world of warez
BBS's.  His interest in hacking bloomed almost immediately,
quickly consuming any thread of any social life he may have once
had.  Soon, he abandoned his human life for a life on the
Internet.  Now in college, he is trying to come out of the black
hole and become a respectable human being, but the outlook is
bleak.



Variation on a DefCon

By Bucket Man

My own personal DefCon story began two years ago. I had been
invited to DefCon I by a girl I met at the Continuation High
School I had ended up at through circumstances we won't go into.
A few days after the convention, she mentioned that we wouldn't
be going after all. When DefCon II came around I made
reservations at the Sahara and introduced some friends of mine
to hack/phreak in a big hurry so that I would have someone to
share the bill with. On our way out the door, our designated
driver's mother decided to commandeer the car, and as none of us
were 25, we were unable to rent one. Fortunately we only had to
pay for one of the two nights reserved. Then, along comes DefCon
III. I never thought I would get there, but owing many thanks to
my fellow party members, Light Ray and Squibb, as well as a wack
on the side of the head to the low life who canceled on us the
day before... I not only made it to Vegas, I even lived through
the experience.

Day One was mostly spent exploring the hotel and sharing
drive-up horror stories. We did manage to attach "Fred," our
laptop, to an outside line in the convention room. (An amusing
fact, since apparently Dark Tangent had requested that the hotel
disconnect the phones for that very reason.) We tore off a wall
plate and explored through the roofing above the hallway leading
to the convention room. Jarik talked the hotel staff into
bringing us water. It was shortly after this that we swore that
we would go the whole weekend without once paying for food,
alcohol, or women. We were partially successful: We paid for
food twice, I supplied free drinks, and didn't get any women.
After the first meal, however, I did discover the fastest way to
clear a path through a crowd. Wear a black trenchcoat in 100+
degree weather, and have someone behind you yell, "Look out!
He's got a gun!"

The midnight speech fell short of my expectations. Speaker: The
author of the Little Black Book of Computer Viruses. Topic:
Publishing. Summary: "Uh...hi. Write books. Yes. You must write
books. No, really! Write books! It is morally imperative that
you all write books. I wrote one and no one would publish it,
and, not considering the possibility that it might have been
because it wasn't any good assumed it was a vast anti-hacker
conspiracy and published it on my own and sold nearly 300
copies. So, you must write books. Write books and I will publish
them for you. I'll give you 1/10th of once percent of the
profit, so write books..." Sorry, but I had a hard time
believing that this guy's real motivation was to preserve our
moral integrity and establish cultural connections to the past
for future generations. Light Ray walked out in the middle, came
back an hour later and the guy was still droning on. Oh well, I
suppose I'll recover from the emotional scarring, but after that
didn't bother with any of the other speeches, and probably
missed some good things. Rumor has it that my raffle number was
the first number called for the 4x CD drive, on Sunday.

Around two AM, I figured that the best way to get free drinks
would be to walk behind the bar and grab bottles. It worked. An
hour later I talked an extremely attractive girl into letting
myself and two of my companions into joining her (and her
boyfriend) back in her hotel room. Now...according to Jarik I
massaged her feet for three hours, but I don't believe him. All
I know is that it was dark when I started, and it wasn't when I
stopped. Then I passed out under a table and the three of them
played strip poker. (Damn you, Jarik! You could have kicked me
harder!)

It was Saturday night that I was awakened from a daze by a call
from Arclight asking if it would be ok to use our room as
broadcast station for a pirate radio station. "Sure," I said, I
mean, it wasn't like I had anything better to do. So, shortly
thereafter, the KDNA crew shows up and starts setting up
equipment. Meanwhile, I put on an old Halloween costume of Ali
Abbabwa from Disney's Aladdin and started wandering around the
hotel. I wanted to go to the Aladdin hotel and pretend to be
staff, but couldn't find anyone with a camera. Hey, it worked at
Disneyland. Light Ray and I ended up running around the hotel
with, "Crazy GTE man," a guy who had stolen a GTE flag and was
using it as a cape telling everybody to tune in to Pirate Radio
104.7 KDNA. Light Ray changed into a ninja uniform and I donned
my infamous Chun Li outfit. (Yes...Chun Li from Street Fighter
II) I was surprised by how little I got harassed about it. Most
people just chuckled and waited to see what else we would do.
Security freaked out about the ninja uniform though, none of the
elevators would work for us and we had to use the stairs for a
good portion of the night. (Evidently a good thing, because
security was looking for the broadcast point and figured we were
a good place to start looking. If nothing else, I figure not

Hacking Postal Barcodes - Ever wondered what information was
hidden away in the mysterious bar-codes you find on the bottom
of envelopes?  The bar-code is your full eleven-digit ZIP-code
(Did you know you even had an eleven digit ZIP code?).  It is
composed of vertical bars which are either full-height (about
0.5 cm tall) or half-height.  The system is somewhat of a binary
derivative, as each bar has two possible states, tall or short,
or one and zero.   The first bar is always tall (1) and is known
as the "frame bar" because it lets the scanner determine the
beginning of the bar code.  After that, each five bars
corresponds to one digit of your ZIP code. To decode it, start
at zero.  If the first bar is tall, then add seven.  If the
second is tall, add 4.  The third, 2, the fourth add 1, and the
fifth bar is zero.  (I'm not sure exactly why the fifth bar is
necessary.)  Basically, it's binary, but the place values are 7,
4, 2, 1, 0 instead of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.  Thank you to Rat         from
DnA (ratphun@aol.com) for the information.


Electronic Shoplifting Counter- measures - You probably
encounter these devices daily. They are the panels you walk
between when exiting a retail store or library, etc.  If you
walk  through carrying an item not paid for, an alarm goes off.
Apparently, in the stickers placed on the items is a tiny r-c
circuit (resister/capacitor) tuned to resonate at a specific
frequency.  The "panels" emit radio signals at that frequency.
When the r-c circuit is exposed to signals of the specified
frequency, it reradiates a signal at the same frequency that is
not in phase with the signal emitted by the panels. If an
out-of-phase signal is detected, an alarm goes off.  How do they
desensitize the system once you pay for an item?  When placed in
a somewhat strong magnetic field, a small current is induced
into the r-c circuit.  Since the circuit is so small, it is
burnt by that current, rendering it unable to reradiate signals
at the same frequency.


Wacky Weird Slime Stuph- We made this at DefCon 1995..   I think
it was Q-Master's idea.  It's very difficult to describe, you'll
just have to make it yourself.  Rumor has it that it is
officially called "Ooblix" or something like that.  Anyways, get
a large vat and dump equal amounts (by volume) of lukewarm water
and powdered cornstarch into it.  Stir.  It should turn into a
soupy gray glop.  Okay, put your hands in and pull them out
slowly.  See, it's just a liquid.  Okay, put your hands in and
pull them out quickly.  The liquid glob will coagulate into a
solid and you will lift the container up.  Then, it will return
to its original state of liquidness.  It's wierd.


MUDs As a Possible Security Risk Part I

Preface

This article will not directly tell you step-by-step how to hack
an Internet machine through the MUD server. It will, however,
give you a good base of knowledge on how MUDs work and what
security holes have been discovered and exploited in the past.
You are then left to your own skill and devices to do what you
will. Newer versions of the mudlibs will probably patch up some
or all of these security holes, but I'm sure new ones will be
created and/or discovered. Hacking should always be a learning,
exploring, and discovering experience... If you find anything,
email me.

Part I: The Basics

One of the most popular things to do on the Internet these days
is to play MUDs. For those of you unfamiliar with them, MUDs are
"Multi-User Dungeons". Most of them are, of course, role-playing
games. A bunch of people (sometimes up to 50 or more) can be on
at once interacting with each other, the virtual environment,
and non-player characters or monsters created by the MUD's
creators. You connect to a MUD either with the standard telnet
utility or via a special program called a "MUD Client". MUD
clients will usually give you cool features like split screens
and colors, whereas telnet is very crude and simple.

Some players on every MUD (and in a lot of cases, most of the
players) will have access to code objects, which can be rooms,
areas, monsters, weapons, armor, anything in the game. This type
of access is referred to as "creator" access. Objects, on most
MUDs, are coded in a programming language called LPC, which is
very much like C, but with extensions designed to make it easy
to code MUD objects.

Now all these things sound well and good and fun, but under the
hood, MUDs can be a security risk waiting to be exploited.
Despite having great fun and wreaking havoc with the MUD itself,
a clever hacker could fairly easily gain access to an operating
system prompt running with the UID of the MUD daemon which, in a
lot of cases, would be ROOT! You see, MUDs are run by a "driver"
program which is simply a program written in C (usually) that
runs as a daemon task on a UNIX machine. The driver then
interprets the LPC code written by the MUDs creators. This
daemon is usually started with a UID of ROOT (since they're
usually run from /etc/rc.d/rc.local).

On most MUDs, there is also another layer between the driver and
the creator-written LPC code. This layer is the "mudlib".
Mudlibs (there are many of them) are simply libraries of LPC
code, usually written by a large team of LPC programmers, which
define the basic functionality of the MUD, such as user logins,
how to display information, how the player's and monster's
bodies work, etc. The creators then write code which calls the
mudlib and inherits (LPC is a totally object-oriented language,
with full inheritance, etc.) certain properties, and defines
objects such as rooms, monsters, etc.

Now, before we move on, let's make sure you've got the basic
terminology down. There are many things involved with a MUD (who
knew games could be such a pain in the ass?) and in order to
seize control of one, you must understand everything. So, here's
a quick MUD dictionary.

 creator: anyone on a MUD who has access to code objects

driver: the executable file, run as a system daemon, that reads
and interprets the game definition (LPC code)



LPC     stands for Lars Pensj C ... The programming language you
write in to create MUD objects

mudlib  the library of LPC code whichs defines the basic MUD
functionality

object  anything in the game -- players, monsters, rooms, the
weather daemon, weapons, etc


 If you get creator access on a MUD (usually this can be done by
gaining a certain level of experience, or completing some quest
in the game), there is a lot you can do to fuck with the MUD
itself. While this isn't real useful from a hacking standpoint
(you won't get into the O/S this way...), it *can* be a lot of
fun, and can serve as a way to learn LPC coding as well as the
internals of whatever mudlib the MUD is using.

The mudlib I'm familiar with is the TMI-2 mudlib, one of the
most popular ones around. So the stuff I'm going to mention may
not apply to the mud you're on, since they might not by using
TMI-2. The mudlib is usually mentioned somewhere in the login
text.

Everything in the MUD is an object that's defined in LPC code in
a file somewhere in the MUD's filesystem. MUDs have a filesystem
all their own, and it's made to look exactly like a normal UNIX
tree structure. It all starts from a root directory, which is
referred to as '/', just like in UNIX. This *is not* the host
system's real root directory, it's merely the *MUD's* root
directory. On most UNIXes, the actual physical directory will be
/usr/local/mud/lib/TMI2-1.2/ or something similar. Underneath
this root are all the MUD's directories which store various
configuration files and LPC code files, some of which are part
of the mudlib, and others which are creator-defined. Some
important directories are:

/adm - admin-only stuff like code for system daemons, etc...
/adm/daemon - system daemons /std - standard definitions (mostly
these will get inherited somewhere else) /cmd - LPC code for all
the user commands (some are in sub-dirs under this) /obj - where
most MUDs keep their LPC code for monsters, weapons, armor,
magic items, etc. /u/<1st-letter>/<name> - creator-access user's
home directories... home  directory for Pazuzu would be
/u/p/pazuzu, vandal  would be /u/v/vandal

In the MUD itself, you can use standard UNIX directory
management commands to manage files and directories (again, if
you have creator access). Here's a quick review:

cd      change directory, just like in DOS or UNIX

mkdir   make directory

rmdir   remove directory

pwd     show what directory you are in

rm      remove file





Interestingly, they mimicked UNiX's filesystem so completely,
you can refer to user's home directories on the MUD exactly how
you would under UNIX: ~<name>/ (pazuzu's home dir would be
~pazuzu/).

MUDs have mail and finger just like UNIX also. The finger
support is so complete, it allows for the standard .plan and/or
.projects files in your MUD home dir, just like under UNIX.

A lot of MUDs also have newsgroup support also.

The reason I mention all this is that they have tried to put the
full functionality of having a UNIX shell account under the MUD.
However, since you're really *NOT* using UNIX, just a UNIX
program (which is running as a daemon with UID = ROOT!),
security is dubious at best. For example, if they don't do path
checking (and sometimes they don't...), you could request (if
you were in the MUD's root dir) to edit, let's say,
../../../../../etc/passwd, and assuming the physical directory
/usr/local/mud/lib/TMI2-1.2/, get the system's password file.
Now keep in mind that this is all experimental... I'm just going
into what I have done in the past and letting you go from there
with (hopefully) a good base knowledge on how these buggers work.

One thing that can be a lot of fun is making sure that when you
kill someone, they stay dead for a while. Normally, on a MUD,
when you get "killed", what happens internally is that your
"player" body gets switched to a "ghost" body and gets moved
into the cemetery. There, you can usually type a "pray" or
similar command and get brought back from the dead. However, if
you kill someone and then IMMEDIATELY type trace -dv /std/ghost,
the ghost object will get destroyed, and the player's connection
will get dropped. "trace" is a standard creator access command
that lets you trace instances of objects, -dv means (d)estroy
and (v)iew, and /std/ghost is name name of the LPC file which
defines the standard ghost object. It would be an LPC file
called ghost.c in the /std directory. You can destroy any
object(s) with the trace -dv command. For example, to get rid of
everyone in the game's sword, type trace -dv /obj/sword. More
malicious things to do include killing the MUD's login daemon
(if you have the access: trace -dv /adm/daemon/login-- won't
work in most cases, unless you have high access or the MUD's
admin is a moron), killing the MUD's FTP server, if it has one
(trace -dv /adm/daemon/ftpd), or killing various other system
daemons. These include /adm/daemon/httpd, /adm/daemon/weatherd,
etc.

If you don't have the access you need, there are ways to get it
-- sometimes. In order to understand how this next trick works,
you need to understand how LPC MUD drivers look at objects.
Everything in the game is an object: weapons, armor, players,
ghosts, rooms, EVERYTHING. There is no difference between
objects -- only their properties vary. In order to carry a
weapon, the weapon object's location property is set to the
object ID of the player. The weapon is now "in" the player. It's
the same with rooms: the player object's location property is
set to the room's object ID. The player is now "in" the room. A
special case of this is when one body object is moved into
another body object. When this happens, the "moved" body
"becomes" the "moved to" body. The object that was moved takes
on all the properties (access level is a property, hint hint) of
the object it moved into. Now, keep in mind that most MUD
admins' characters are left in the game at all times, sitting
idle. What would happen if a player moved into one of the
admins' bodies? Hmmm... That player would now BE the admin,
effectively. He could then do practically anything he wanted to,
including destroy the entire MUD. How is this done? Well, try
typing (on a TMI-2 MUD) call me;move;/d/TMI/cemetery. You're now
in the cemetery. Keeping in mind that objects are objects, try
call me;move;/std/player#nnnn, where nnnn depends on the output
of a trace /std/player... Next to everyone's player object,
there'll be an instance number. So if one of the admins was
instance #1493, call me;move;/std/player#1493 would *probably*
move you into his body, allowing you free reign of destruction
over the MUD. Keep in mind that all this stuff will work or not
work based on how tight the MUD's security is. It will work in a
lot of cases, though.

Another way to wreak absolute havoc on some MUDs is to destroy
the VOID object. Objects in LPC *must* have a location, so when
something is really nowhere, it's in the VOID object. The best
way to see what will happen is to find a room that a whole bunch
of players are in. Then go to a different room and run a trace
/std/player to see what the filename of that room is. Then run a
trace -dv <file>, replacing <file> with the path/file name of
the room. All those players will now be in the VOID. So,
immediately type tracedv /std/void (or /d/TMI/void - run a trace
/std/player real quick to see which one your MUD is using), and
all the players will no longed be ANYWHERE, which will likely
cause the MUD to panic and possibly lock up. Note that this is
really a bug in the TMI-2 (and most other) mudlib, and it may
get fixed someday.

As a side note, there are some commands you should immediately
run once you get on a MUD. The first is call me;set;immortal;1 -
this will make you immortal (no one can kill you through normal
means). You should also run a call me;set;max_hp;666 (or some
other high number), since even though you're immortal, you can
still have your HP go to 0, which *does* fuck up the combat
routines, so you should make your HP very high.

Now all of this may seem very lame and silly, but it's all a
preliminary to the real fun... In order to do what you need or
want to do, you must understand how LPC and MUDs in general work.

I am including a copy of George Reese's (Borg's) basic &
intermediate LPC tutorials so that you may learn a little more
about LPC. Please read those before continuing this article,
else you'll get lost.

 On some of the more advanced MUDs (and this is becoming the
norm), there are FTP and HTTP servers running "in the mud". What
that means is that they're being run by the MUD, but of course,
they're listening on a different TCP/IP port. When you telnet to
a MUD, you specify the address (like rodent.mud.com), and also
the PORT that the MUD is running on... For example: telnet
rodent.mud.com 1000 ... Usually, if there's an FTP or HTTP
server running on the MUD, it'll be one port away from the MUD's
telnet port. So, if the MUD's telnet port is 1000, the FTP
server could be on 999 or 1001, or something totally different.
Same for the HTTP server. There will usually be a message about
the FTP/HTTP servers somewhere on the MUD itself, since they
want you to think they're really |<-|<(/)(/)1!@

These servers are actually written in LPC! Mind you, the
advanced LPC techniques used to create them are way beyond the
scope of this article (or any other that I've seen). I've read
through the source for both servers (at least under the TMI-2
mudlib anyhow), and believe me, the code is rather convoluted
and full of possible security holes.

In my next article, we'll discuss the TMI-2 FTP & HTTP servers.


THE RED BOX

The Red Box is a tool used by phreaks (Phone Hackers) to make
fraudulent free phone calls from payphones.  It looks like the
days of the Red Box are limited, and soon it may take it's place
with the Blue Box.  Using a red box is not true phreaking at
all, however, it's a good place to start.

Theory



When you put a quarter (or any other accepted coin) into a
payphone (see sidebar), it drops into a holding area (the
"hopper") in the center of the phone and the phone tells the
phone company that money was inserted and how much.  It does
this by sending a series of tones, one pulse of 1100+1700 Hertz
for every five cents.  If you make a call successfully, your
money drops down to the change holding box.  If you don't, it
drops down to the coin return.  This is why payphones cannot
give change.  The red box generates the 1100+1700 Hertz signal,
which is played into the mouthpiece of the phone.  The phone
company thinks that you put money in the phone, so you can make
calls.  Note the t you cannot get any money out of the phone
using a red box for two reasons. The first is that the payphone
doesn't listen for the red box tones, the phone company does.
The second is that payphones can only return the exact change
that you put in.  (i.e., the same quarter)   The phone company
can tell the payphone to release the coins in the holding
chamber to either the coin box or the coin return using green
box tones.  However, the green box tones must be sent from the
phone company to the phone, so it is fairly useless to the
phreaker.

Construction

There are two dominant methods of constructing a red box.  The
first is to  build something that will generate the tones, and
the second is to record the tones onto a recording device.

Software is readily available for DOS and other platforms to
create the necessary tones through your sound card.  These
include BlueBeep and BOX.EXE which was distributed with Phrack.
You may record these tones on a quality tape recorder, but that
is fairly clunky.  A better method is to get an $8.00 Hallmark
recordable greeting card at a Hallmark card.  Take the card
apart (be very careful, the tiny wires break easily) and
repackage the electronics.  Be creative! Red boxes have been
created in dolls, pager cases, gum packages, etc. Replace the
cheesy plastic button with a normally open push-button switch
(from Radio Shack or wherever) and record the tones on the card.
 You may get better results if you directly couple your sound
source to the microphone wires (after removing the microphone.)
It may also be necessary to install a small resister in series
with the speaker to achieve proper volume.

Another way to create a red box is by modifying a Radio Shack
memory tone dialer.  This method usually works the best, but it
is probably the most expensive.  Take a Radio Shack Memory Tone
Dialer and open it up.  Find the crystal and replace it with a
6.5536 megahertz crystal.  The existing crystal is the biggest
thing you'll see, and it should look similar to the 6.5536
replacement crystal, which you can mail order from any
electronics component vendor.  Program one of the memory keys to
be five asterisks (*'s).  That memory key will then be one
quarter.  You may want to install a switch so that you can still
use the tone dialer as a tone dialer in addition to a red box.
Mercury switches are neat: right side up it's a tone dialer,
upside down, it's a red box.

Use

Since this article is for educational purposes only, don't
actually make or use a red box.  However, here's how phreakers
use the red box.

Basically, just play the tones instead of inserting money.  It's
good practice (to avoid being caught) to insert some real money
before (i.e., a nickel, payphones don't accept pennies) playing
any tones.  Put a random delay between virtual coins.  Remember,
one pulse if five cents.

Note that you cannot make local calls directly using a red box.
To make a local call, dial the operator and ask him/her to dial
a number for you.  Give them the number, tell them you want to
pay by coin, play the tones when it asks for money.

That's just about all there is to red boxing.  I hope this
article has been interesting and educational.  If you're
interested in more fun things you can do with payphones,
download ABCPP.ZIP from the Digital Forest.  It's quite
interesting.  Remember, making, using, and owning telephone
fraud devices and such equipment is very illegal, so don't do
anything described in this article.  We're not responsible if
you do.




| Electronic Mail:
| The Real Killer App,
| Its Future And Impact
| By Light Ray

While Netscape Communications proclaims that Netscape/Mozilla is
the "Killer App" and others cite other www browsers as being the
"Killer App," many of them are losing touch with what is
actually useful.  Sure, the world wide web is fun, but it's
fairly useless right now.  More people use E-Mail than use any
other Internet function.  Today, our AFS exchange student used
E-Mail to send mail to his family back in the Slovak Republic,
instead of making an expensive $1.50 a minute telephone call.
On the radio, the DJ solicited Internet email for a contest to
win something.  With the world wide web, about all one can do at
this point is obtain information on a particular topic.  With
electronic mail, one can interactively converse with someone.
It's as fast as a phone call and much cheaper, and it doesn't
matter if the intended recipient is at home.

Unfortunately, there isn't really a 411 for electronic mail, so
it's difficult to find someone's address.  The easiest  way to
get someone's e-mail address is to call them on the telephone
and ask.

An emerging technology is voice technology over the Internet.
This allows you to talk to someone over the Internet, no matter
where they are physically located. (No long distance phone
bills!)  Unfortunately, this technology is still being
developed.  It's available now, but there are few standards.
Unlike electronic mail, you must be using the same software as
the person that you are talking to, on the same type of
computer, and often the conversation must be prearranged.
However, as standards emerge, voice over the Internet may become
as standard as electronic mail.

The next logical step in the evolution of digital communication
is video conferencing.  Again, this is here today to some
extent.  You can purchase a real video-phone that works over
normal phone lines at your local AT&T store.  However, almost no
one has these phones for three reasons: (1) they see no reason
to get one (2) they are very expensive and (3) no one else has
one.  A telephone's usefulness is dependent on how many people
have telephones.  If only one person has a telephone, it's
completely useless.   Video over the Internet requires several
things that aren't yet common.  While most computers now include
sound recording and playback hardware, few personal computers
include video recording and playback equipment.  In addition, a
video camera is much more expensive than a microphone.  Even if
you have all of the necessary hardware, you still need a high
speed Internet connection, which are fairly expensive right now.
 With ISDN becoming more popular, this may change.  An ISDN is
basically a digital phone line, which is very well suited to
high speed digital communications.  ISDN is available now in
many areas; you can get an ISDN line for $30 a month from
Pacific Bell. Also needed to make video-over-the-net work are
software, standards, and data compression technology.  With
companies such as US Robotics manufacturing ISDN equipment for
low prices, ISDN is bound to become much more popular in the
near future, bringing an era of mail, speech, and video over the
Internet.

What implications does this have?  Many, believe it or not.
First, Internet email is cheap (usually free or as much as $10
per month).  This should scare the phone company and the United
States Postal Service.  Email is the telegraph and the USPS is
the pony express.  Of course, you can't send an object through
email (yet), but the majority of correspondence is information
readily sent electronically. An organization must diversify and
evolve or perish.  Unlike most government




X-Files Fans Turn Out For The Convention in Pasadena

By Spooky

On a terribly hot Saturday afternoon, many thousands of people
gathered, crammed in what no longer seems the suitable space of
the Pasadena Convention Center, in Southern California.   But
throughout the day, not a word of complaint is heard. The
majority of the fans who gathered here traveled some distance to
bare witness to the "Second Official X-Files Convention",
playfully nicknamed "The Big-One" by Creation. Whom organize all
The X-Files Conventions. And whom organized the first event in
San Diego, which i attended about a month and a half before.   I
walk in and scan the large crowds of people, spending hundreds
of dollars buying all of the merchandise they can get their
hands on. By the end of the day all of it is all sold out.
Everything from X-Files T-shirts, to TV guides, costing anywhere
from $60-$5. And some other areas, where you can check out
The-Files home page on the world wide web, to one where you can
walk through a small museum of show props, from clothes worn by
David Duchovney (Agent Mulder) (who had roles in Twin Peaks, as
a Transvestite Government Agent, Beethoven, as a greedy
businessmen, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead, as an asshole
boyfriend, played a leading role in Kalifornia, and  has a head
role in Showtimes Red Shoe Diaries and has been in a few
commercials for AT&T) or Gillian Anderson (Agent Scully),  to
the sign used in one of the first seasons episodes with the
words  "Welcome Space Brothers" written on them in a
psyhicadellic 60's fashion.      I walked through isles of seats
trying to find a suitable place to  watch the guests on stage,
presenting slides of X-Files episodes,  Looking at the people
anxiously awaiting the monterage of highly adored actors, (Mitch
Pileggi -Assistant Director Skinner,  Steven Williams -Mr. X,
Dough Hutchinson -Tooms, Erica & Sabrina Kreivens  -Eve 9 & Eve
10) whom, mostly were unknowns before being casted into the
growing fledgling, science fiction, "cult", drama cozily placed
in a wonderful 9:00Pm, Friday slot on the Fox television
network. Providing an adequate, environment, and structure to
allow you to really get into the show.         Going into its
third season, The X-Files has passed the test, which most TV
series never make it through. The creator of the X-Files, Chris
Carter, former surfer magazine journalist, who spoke at the
convention, has planned its three-part season premiere,  which
will continue on September 22, -its usual time, and day.   A
little later, i noticed the now straggly, long haired, unshaven,
 Doug Hutchinson (Tooms) wandering through the crowds, wearing
the black leather jacket, he wore at the X-Files convention in
San Diego.  He jokingly calls this his "rocker" phase. I
approached him, and smiling,  ask for his autograph. I
immediately knew that it was really him, as soon  as he, in his
friendly manner, said, "Sure...how did you recognize me?"  with
a grin. I stood with him shortly as politely took his time and
had  a small conversation as doodled  "LIVERS!" and "Tooms" on
my program. I  thanked him, saying "Bring Back Tooms!" -a phrase
that was adopted by some X-Files fans at the first convention.
 I listened to some of the actors, speak, and answer questions
from the audience, about the show, and their characters. Mitch
Pileggi- who plays Skinner, was asked by some women in the
audience, if they could kiss his forehead, he respectfully
agreed, and walked down off stage. He remarkably, unlike his
character Walter Skinner -a very angry, unlikable, asshole of a
man, is polite, and easy to like.    Soon the time arrives,
after the charity auction, which things such as  Signed scripts
were sold for as much as $760. Chris Carter comes out wearing
casual dress, flashes from cameras and the talk of reporters
start to thrive in the auditorium.   Everyone rushes up to the
podium to ask him questions. By the time he's finished with them
all, the lines have already started to form at the table where
he's scheduled to sign autographs. Near the end of the close, he
begins, to re-describe the season finale, in which  the lead
actor, Mulder, is caught in a situation where he's trapped in a
train car, sunk 20 feet in the ground filled with strange bodies
stacked to the roof at one corner. An explosive goes off inside
the car, the credits  begin to go across the screen.  Carter
laughing, speaks into the microphone, "I have no idea how the
bring Mulder back". The audience laughs as he walks off stage.


An Introduction To
NUMBER BASES
By Light Ray


[This artical makes use of formulas, diagrams,
superscrips, and subscripts that may or may not
be present in the ASCII version.]

Notes

This is taken from the "lab notes" from Explorer Post 340, the
oldest  Boy Scout Explorer Post in the world, as far as I know.
Explorer Post  340 is wonderful. We meet at the Western Digital
Building in the  El Toro "Y", between the I-5 and 405 ("San
Diego") freeways every  Wednesday night from about 7:15pm to
around 9:30pm. This is the first file in a series of
articles/files. I know that most people know this already, but
for those that don't, here it is.

Introduction

When we write a number, we have ten symbols to work with. They
are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Since we have ten symbols,
we say that this is Base 10. However, there are times when it is
awkward or impossible to use base ten. For these situations, we
use alternate number bases. For instance, binary has two
symbols, 0 and 1.



A knowledge of alternate number bases (namely binary,
hexadecimal,  and sometimes octal) is necessary for advanced
programming, digital  logic design, impressing your friends,
winning the lottery, and  having a successful and fulfilling
life.. Well, almost all of  those.


In base X, there are X symbols. People currently use base ten
just  about everywhere, allegedly, this is because people have
ten fingers. That is,  most people, except for those of us who
take interest in machining  or pyrotechnics...


Bases other than the ever-present base-10 have more or fewer
symbols  making them more applicable for non-human applications,
those that  do not have ten fingers.

A Summary Of Base Ten

Base 10 (decimal) uses 10 symbols. These are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7,  8, and 9. This is why it is called base 10.

When writing a number in a specific base, the base is written in
 subscript after the number. For instance, 1310 represents 13 in
Base 10.

To count in base 10, we start at 0 and add one until we get to
9. At  this point, it is necessary to create an additional
column to the left,  containing a one. Every time the first
column reaches 9, it is set to  zero and the column to the left
is incremented. When 99 is reached a  third column containing a
one is created and the two nines are set to  zero, etc.

 In base 10, every column is 10 times greater than the column to
the  right:


Thousands       Hundreds        Tens    Ones

103      102    101     100
1,000   100     10      1

The value of the number 1234 in base 10 is computed by
multiplying  each digit by the value of its place and taking the
sum of the  individual
products.

123410=(1*103)+(2*102)+(3*101)+(4* 100)
123410=(1*1000)+(2*100)+(3*10)+(4*1)
123410=1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
123410=123410

The range of positive values that can be represented by n digits
in  base x is 0 to (xn - 1). For example, the range of positive
values  that may be expressed by a ten digit number in base four
is 0 to  9999. x = 10    n = 4

range = 0 to (xn - 1)
range = 0 to (10^4 - 1)
range = 0 to (10000 - 1)
range = 0 to 9999

 A Summary Of Base Two

Base Two, otherwise known as Binary, uses TWO symbols. These two
 symbols are ZERO (0) and ONE (1). In binary, the symbols 2,3,4
etc. simply do not exist.

Binary is often used in digital electronics and logic because a
digital  signal has two states, on (1) and off (0). On is
usually five volts and  off is usually ground or zero volts.

To count in base two, use the same system as base ten. However,
you only  have two symbols.

Start at Zero.

To find the next number, increment the first (right-most) digit.
If this  digit is already a ONE, then change it to a ZERO and
increment the value  to the left.

Binary (Base 2)         Decimal (Base 10)

0000    0
0001    1
0010    2
0011    3
0100    4
0101    5
0110    6
0111    7
1000    8
1001    9
1010    10
1011    11
1100    12
1101    13
1110    14
1111    15



In base two, every column has two times greater value than the
column immediately to the right.

Eights  Fours   Twos    Ones

23      22      21      20

The value of the number 1101 in base 2 is computed by
multiplying   each digit by the value of its column and summing
the individual   products, just as in decimal. 11012 = 1310

The range of positive values that can be expressed by n digits
in   base two is zero through (2^n - 1). For example, the
numbers 0   through (2^4 - 1) or 15 may be expressed in four
digits of binary.

A BIT is a single Binary digIT. A bit is either zero or one. A
NIBBLE is four bits. A BYTE is two nibbles or eight bits. A byte
has a value of zero to (28 - 1) or 255. A WORD is normally two
bytes. A word can express 0 to 65535. A LONG WORD is normally
two words.

An 80386 processor transfers digital data a word at a time. A
486 processor transfers data a long word at a time.

A Summary Of Base 16

Base 16 is known as hexadecimal. Hexadecimal uses sixteen
symbols,   which are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D,
E, and F.

Keep in mind that:

        A16 = 1010
        B16 = 1110
        etc.

The place values in hexadecimal are:

4096's  256's   16's    Ones
163     162     161     160

Sample Conversion:

1A3F16 = (1 * 163) + (A * 162) + (3 * 161) + (F * 160)
1A3F16 = (1 * 4906) + (10 * 256) + (3 * 16) + (15 * 1)
1A3F16 = 4906 + 2560 + 48 + 15
1A3F16 = 671910

Converting from Decimal to Binary

The best way to illustrate how to convert a decimal number to
binary  (or any other base for that matter) is to show an
example.

Say that we want to convert 19710 to binary.

First, write out the place values for the target base. Start
with a  place value that is greater than the number you wish to
convert.

256     128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
28      27      26      25      24      23      22      21      20

  The object is to come up with 197 by taking the sum of
selected place  values. Those place values that are selected
will be "1" and those that  aren't will be set to "0".

  For example, 197 is the sum of 128, 64, 4, and 1. We write 1's
under the 128, 64, 4, and 1 columns, and 0's under the  other
columns:

256     128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
0       1       1       0       0       0       1       0       1

  The answer is 110001012.

There is an easier way, but I don't remember it right now. (=
You could, of course, use your scientific calculator.

Converting from Hexadecimal to   Binary and back

We could, of course, convert the Hexadecimal number to Decimal,
and then convert it to Binary. However, there is an amazing
short cut!  (This is actually why we use hexadecimal)

The range that may be expressed by one binary nibble is 0 to 15.
Incidentally, one Hexadecimal digit has the same range, 0 to 15.
Thus, each four digits in binary is equivalent to one digit in
hexadecimal, and vice-versa.

Binary  Decimal         Hexidecimal

0000    0       0
0001    1       1
0010    2       2
0011    3       3
0101    5       5
0110    6       6
0111    7       7
1000    8       8
1001    9       9
1010    10      A
1011    11      B
1100    12      C
1101    13      D
1110    14      E
1111    15      F

To convert 01001001011101102 to hexadecimal, first split it   up
into nibbles:

        0100 1001 0111 0110

Then, convert each nibble to hex. Use the chart if necessary.

Binary  0100    1001    0111    0110
Hex     4       9       7       6

   Thus, 01001001011101102 = 497616

Since the base 16 version is so much shorter, we work with   hex
very often when programming and using digital logic.  Note that
in programming, hexadecimal numbers are often prefixed with
"0x0" to denote hex.  This is the C language method of doing it.
 Other times, you'll see hex numbers prefixed with a dollar sign
or appended with a lower case "h."

12AB16 = 0x012AB = $012AB = 12ABh

Now, lacking a better ending for this lesson, I will leave it at
that.


LINUX

Imagine: Your puny '386 turned into a powerful UNIX workstation,
for free.  It can be done with Linux...

What Is Linux?

Linux is a freely-distributable implementation of UNIX for
machines with 80386 or higher processors. Features include
X-Windows, TCP/IP, and everything else you would expect to find
in a 32-bit multi-user, multi-tasking, multi-threaded operating
system. Best of all, Linux is FREE. You can get Linux through a
variety of methods. The easiest way is to buy a CD with Linux on
it. You can also download Linux from many BBS's or FTP it over
the Internet. You may FTP Linux from 11.mit.edu or
sunsite.unc.edu.

My First Attempt

One night, while browsing files on a local BBS, I discovered
that "SoftLanding Systems" distribution of Linux was available
for download. Thus,  I began a 16mb batch download and went to
bed.

I woke up the next day to play with my new acquisition.
Instructions? Hm. The installation instructions were sketchy at
best. I figured out how to create a bootdisk and a root disk,
then I needed to repartition my hard disk and create a Minix
filesystem on it. This took several hours and I never did get
Linux installed correctly. I gave up, my hard disk in shambles,
and I had better things to do at the time.

A New Look

Last week, at the computer swap meet, something caught my eye.
"4-CD Set LINUX Developers Resource," it proclaimed, "QuickStart
Guide Inside" noted underneath. I decided to give Linux another
shot, so I painfully parted with a hard earned twenty dollar
bill and it was mine.

When I got home, I put in Disc One and began reading the cute
little "QUICKSTART version 2.0" booklet.

The first step in the Linux installation is to create a Boot
Floppy and a Root Floppy. To do this, you select a disk image
and write it to a 1.2mb or 1.44mb floppy disk. There are a
variety to chose from, depending on your setup. A handy file
helps you chose. Since I was installing from an Enhanced IDE
CD-ROM drive, I needed to use "idecd" for my boot image. Since
my boot drive is a 3.5", 1.44mb drive, I used the "idecd" file
in the "boot144" directory as my boot image. I chose the
"umsdos" file as my root image since I was installing to a FAT
partition. Creation of the root and boot disks was easy and went
smoothly, using a neat little utility called "rawrite" which was
provided. There is also a point-and-click windows-based
boot/root disk creator for those that (for some reason) wish to
have a more painless experience.

Incidentally, I was pleased to learn that Linux no longer needs
it's own partition. It works best with it's own ext2fs format
partition, but it will coexist on a FAT partition without
damaging anything. This means that I didn't have to repartition
my hard disk, which I was quite thankful for.

Ok, step two. I put the Boot Disk in drive A: and rebooted. Up
popped a "Welcome to the Slackware Linux 2.2.0 bootkernel disk!"
message and I was asked if I had any special parameters. I hit
enter and booting continued. It loaded the boot disk onto a RAM
Disk and then I inserted the Root Disk. The Boot Disk contains
the Linux operating system and the Root Disk holds the
filesystem. It's too big to fit on a single floppy.

Finally booted up, I log in as "root," the master superuser
account of UNIX. Then I get to a Linux prompt, where I type
"SETUP."  From then on, installation is a flawless breeze,
courtesy the user-friendly colorful menued setup program. Linux
installation requires from 10mb to 150mb, depending on what you
install.

Success!

Linux was installed. It was incredible. I began to browse my
newfound directory structure. I played Doom for Linux,
Asteroids, and read info files. It was Neat.

X

It was great. But I wanted more. The next step was to setup
X/Windows. X/Windows is the Graphical User Interface for UNIX.
It's available for just about any flavor of UNIX and there are
many varieties available from different vendors, ranging from
free (Xfree or X11) to very expensive.

X-Windows for Linux is notoriously difficult to coax into
working. However, it was pretty straight forward in my case. The
main stumbling block is getting it to like your monitor and
video card, but I was fortunate in that my Genoa WindowsVGA card
was supported. Most cards are, in fact, supported, with Diamond
cards being the major exception.

The newer distributions of Linux come with a neat configuration
program for X11 which made installation quite painless. Having
configured it, I typed "xinit" and up came X-Windows. It was
pretty cool, my PC transformed into a sleek X-terminal...

Look for an article on more neat things you can do with Linux in
the next  issue.  Also, read the UNIX column.

Notes

Another free UNIX operating system exists for the 80x86
platform, FreeBSD. Look for a review in a future issue. Linux
and FreeBSD distributions are available from Chestnut,
InfoMagic, Walnut Creek CD-ROM, and other companies.

UNIX

Welcome to the UNIX column of our Zine. In this column I will
conduct an ongoing UNIX tutorial over the next few issues of
this magazine. Knowledge of UNIX is very usefull for many
reasons. UNIX is the dominent operating system for powerful
computers and computers on the internet. If you ever plan on
installing Linux, being a successful Hacker, or getting a job in
the hi-tech computer industry, you will need to be familier with
UNIX.

UNIX is an incredibly powerful operating system however, with
it's mightly power, UNIX is a very complex and unfriendly
operating system. This brief article is to bestow upon the
average DOS-ite the basic navigation skills necessary to use
UNIX.  Future articles will delve into more advanced UNIX topics.

Like ice cream, UNIX comes in "flavors."  A UNIX flavor refers
to a brand of UNIX.  UNIX Flavors include Linux, BSD, Ultrix,
Irix, etc.



UNIX is, in many ways, similar to DOS.  It also has its
differences.  Like DOS, UNIX is text mode command-line based,
although it you may install a graphical user interface (GUI)
such as X-Windows.  Unlike DOS, UNIX was designed from ground
zero to be a multi-user, multi-tasking, multi-threading
networking and development platform.  Let's examine each of
these.

The multi-user capabilities allow one computer to be used by
multiple people.  The most obvious signature of the multi-user
system is that the first one must do when using a computer
runnning UNIX is to log in with a name and password.  Files and
directories may be owned by one person or a group of people.

Since UNIX is multi-tasking and multi-threading, multiple people
may be using the computer simultaneously and each person is able
to run more than one application simultaneously.
Multi-threading refers to the ability for a program to have
multiple parts which execute simultaneously.


UNIX is a development platform.  It is designed so that software
written for UNIX (including UNIX itself) is highly portable
between platforms (different computer types) and operating
systems.  It is also a networking operating system, that is,
UNIX is designed to help connect computers to other computers
and communicate between them.  Virtually the entire Internet is
run by computers using UNIX, although that is beginning to
change.

The UNIX File System

The UNIX directory structure is similar to DOS. That is, a
directory may have subdirectories, which may in turn have
subdirectories, etc. There are several anomalies, however, which
you must take into account.

First of all, UNIX uses the forward slant bar ("/") where DOS
uses the back slant bar ("\"). This is a general headache for
those that use DOS and UNIX.   For example, cd /usr/X386 is
correct.  cd\usr\X386 will not work.   In UNIX, the back slant
bar is used to denote case in situations where only upper-case
characters are available.  This is not as common as it once was,
but you will still run into times when you may only use upper
case characters.  Simply precede any character you wish to
remain in upper case with a back slant bar.  The remaining
characters will be converted to lower case.  This brings us to
an important point.  UNIX  is case sensitive.  Filenames may
have upper case and lower case letters in them, and you must use
the propper case when referencing them.

One feature of UNIX not found in DOS is the concept of a
"symbolic link."  (The new MacOS has something similar known as
"aliases.")  A Symbolic Link looks like an item in the directory
(a subdirectory, a file, etc) however, it points to an item in
another directory. This is usefull because you may want to have
one file in two different places; a symbolic link would let you
have one file appear in two different places, but physically
reside in only one directory, saving space.

In UNIX, many non-file items are mapped to the file system.
These include devices, found in the /dev directory, as well as
running tasks, found in the /proc direcory, to name a few. This
may be confusing, but it's actually quite handy. For example, on
my Linux system, /dev/modem is a symbolic link to /dev/ttyS01,
the second serial port.

The Shell

The Shell is the command interpreter for UNIX, the interface
between the operating system and the user. The shell is the
program that accepts your input and executes commands, etc.
There are several common shells, including the Bourne shell
(sh), the C shell (csh), the Korn shell (ksh), the restricted
Bourne shell (rsh), and the Bourne again shell (bash), as well
as ash. (command.com, 4dos.com, and ndos.com are shells for DOS.
The finder is the shell in MacOS).

You should now have a basic understanding of UNIX.  The best
thing to do now is to gain access to a UNIX system and play with
it.  The best way to do this is to either install Linux (an
excellent way to learn UNIX) or get a "shell account" somewhere.
 You can usually get a shell account if you attend college, or
sometimes high school.  Alternatively, you can get a shell
account for about $15 per month from an internet service
provider.  Shell accounts are available for the cost of a phone
call from free.org, which has an ad later in this magazine.
Ports (versions) of various UNIX shells are available for DOS,
OS/2, and Windows.  [Note: The Korn shell ported to OS/2 is
available as ksh.zip on The Digital Forest - Light Ray]

Below is a UNIX  Command Reference to get you started.  (It
continues on the next page.) Enjoy!

~

UNIX Command Reference

Command         Function

ls      List files - similar to DIR in DOS. Use the -a option to
list all files, including hidden files, -o option toggles color,
-l option toggles long (detailed) display.

cd <directory>  Change Directory - the same as in DOS except
forward slashes are used and their must be a space after cd.
Example:   cd /blort

pwd     Path Name - displays the name of the directory that you are
in

cat <filename>  Catalog - displays contents of <filename>

rm <filename>   Remove - same as DOS delete/del/erase command.
Erases <filename> from disk.

cp <src> <dst>  Copy - copies <src> to <dst>, just like the DOS
copy command.

whoami  Shows what account you are logged in as, in case you
forgot.

who     Shows what uses are logged in, with login date and time

ps      List System Processes - includes the Process ID (PID),
Terminal (TTY), time started, and the name of the command (CMD).
ps -u<user> will display only the processes owned by <user>.

kill    Kill Process - Use ps to get the process ID. Use either
the format kill -<strength> <pid> or kill <pid>. The process
with Process ID <pid> will be terminated. A Strength of 9 will

COMDEX:

A Cultural Experience

"This is comdex!" Yelled the Microsoft person, "We don't want
anything unless it's free!" he continued, then proceeding to
throw pins, pens and other paraphernalia into the mass throng of
important business people. This couldn't be anything but Comdex,
the largest annual information technology trade show and
convention in the world, where industry leaders bring the newest
technology to show it to the world, and get people to buy it.
Comdex is truly amazing, and is certainly a cultural experience
of another kind.

At about 11:30 PM on Wednesday, November 16, we arrived at our
hotel, on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Room rates jump up to 20
times the normal rates during the week of Comdex, that is if you
can even find a room. This is due to the hundreds of thousands
of comdex goers that flock in their annual mass migrations to
this gambling city.

In the morning of Thursday, we woke up and made the short trip
over to the Sands to eat breakfast. A strange thing about Las
Vegas is that people actually obey the speed limit. We were
driving through a 15 mph zone, and everyone was actually going
at exactly 15 mph. How strange, law abiding citizens?  After
wading through vast traffic, both human and automobile, we
arrived at the Sands. Upon entering the Sands and passing an
uncountable array of places to lose our money, we located a
place to eat. After our breakfast, we proceeded to Registration.

It was a large white tent, primarily deserted, but kept alive by
the trickle of people coming to "The Show" on the second to last
day. A trickle, that is, being a mere few hundred people per
hour. After waiting in the line, I came to one of about twenty
badge typists designated to that line. The badge typists looked
thoroughly fatigued and ready to go home, for what a monotonous
task they had. I handed my registration forms to the badge
typist that I had come to, which he entered into his terminal.
According to the forms, I was Tobin Fricke, CEO of TobinTech
Engineering. After he was done typing up the information, I
acquired my Comdex directory. The Comdex directory is a mere
index to the various booths at Comdex, yet it is 628 pages.
Naturally, it was alternatively available on CD-ROM. We walked
to the large Badge Printer, which was busy embossing the comdex
badges. We waited for our badges to be printed and borrowed
several unembossed cards from the machine in the process. When
mine finally came out of the machine, it read, "Tobin Frike, Big
Boss, TobinTech Engineering."  Well, the badge typist thought it
was funny...

At last, we were able to enter Comdex. We stood before the
convention hall, feeling a sort of awe. The building looked as
if it could be three stories tall. There was a large banner
across the entrance that said, "WELCOME TO COMDEX!"  The rest of
the building was plastered with ads, predominantly Intel's,
saying, "Come visit us at booth LN109!" We entered Comdex, and
left reality, through the line of glass doors. We were greeted
with a "No persons under 16 years of age permitted on the trade
show floor" sign and several security people. We just walked on
past, and then went up the escalators, pretending that we were a
few years older.

The inside of the convention hall was very much like an aircraft
hanger. It was huge. Vibrantly colorful signs and bold logos,
both those familiar and those alien, dangled from and filled the
skies of the comdexian universe. It was overwhelming. After the
initial euphoric shock was received, one notices the audio. From
one booth, you hear, "Come see our show and get a free
tee-shirt!!!" and from another you hear, "...has been the leader
in the industry for..." Voices from the hundreds of thousands of
people, voices from the exhibitors, all culminating in a
background comdexian roar that fills your ears. You are in the
Comdex.

Comdex is like most of the computer world, an equalizing
experience. In the real world, you are judged by what you look
like, how you talk, what you think. In contrast, cyberculture is
quite different. Everyone is judged by what they know and want
to know. For the most part, and innocent pion with sufficient
knowledge, such as myself, can strike up an interesting
conversation on an equal basis with the designers of the newest
technology in the computer world. You listen to them. They
listen to you. You understand. They understand.

The day passed quickly, and soon we were back at our car, with
several new tee-shirts, a couple CD's each, hundreds of
hand-outs, disks, pins, buttons, stickers, keychains, et hoc
genus omne. From this point, we explored the hotels and casinos,
ate a $4.95 Prime Rib dinner, and retired to our hotel.

Comdex is a unique experience. Comdex is a gathering of 195,000
people who share the same interests, a gathering of the newest
technology. The people that go to Comdex are not ordinary
people, for they have developed a culture of their own.

~Comdex occurs twice yearly, once in the Fall in Las Vegas,
Nevada, and once in Atlanta, Georgia. The Fall 1995 Comdex will
take place in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Hilton, and Sands
Expo and Convention Center, during the week of November 13 to
17, 1995. You may register online at http://www.comdex.com:8000.
An exposition pass may be obtained for free.



Spinning A Web Page



All of us have by now surfed the World Wide Web, or at least we
know someone who has or we have heard or read about it. After
about fifteen minutes of happy clicking, we dream of creating
our own cool spot on the web. We think about all the nifty
things we'd add to our homepage and how fellow surfers would
flock to it in awe.



Creating one's own homepage on the World Wide Web is not too
difficult, depending upon the aproach that you take. Two things
are needed to create a homepage. You need the page itself and a
place to put the page.



Constructing the Page

The first step is to design your page. Get out a few sheets of
paper and draw out what you want it to look like, or, for those
with photographic memories, do this in your head. Remember that
a homepage may consist of more than one pages. For example, you
can have something to click on that says "My Summer Vacation,"
which could go to another page about your summer vacation. Once
you figure out what your page is going to look like, you can
begin writing it.



A page consists of a file or a series of files in a format known
as "HTML," in addittion to files for all the graphical images
and sounds that you have on your page. HTML stands for
"HyperText Markup Language."  You can create an HTML format
document in any word processor that can output to straight text
or ASCII. The MicroSoft Windows Notepad, DOS Edit, and the OS/2
System Editor will all work. Also, most commercial word
processors can output ASCII files, such as Ami Pro. In
addittion, there are several specialized HTML editors which you
may use.



In HTML documents, markup "tags" define the start and end of
headings and titles, paragraphs, lists, character attributes
(such as bold, italic, etc) and links to other pages. Most
markups are identified in a document with a start tag, which
gives the element name and attributes, followed by text or other
information, then ended by the end tag. Start tags are delimited
by < and >, and end tags are delimited by </ and >. For example
"This is <b>bold</b>!" would appear as "This is bold!"



The first step in writing the HTML portion of your page is to
write the actual literal text in a text editor. Then, go back
and add HTML markup tags. It is completely possible to write it
all at once with HTML tags in the first place, but this is
rather confusing.



Once you have the text written, it is time to insert the HTML
markup tags. All HTML documents have the following basic
structure:



        <HTML>

        <HEAD>

        header elements

        <BODY>

        body text

        </HTML>



Since you have already written your body text, add "<HTML><HEAD>
<BODY>" to the top of your document and add "</HTML>" to the
end. Note that it does not matter what if there are line breaks
in HTML. The above is exactly the same as:



<HTML><HEAD>header elements<BODY>body text</HTML>



Now, go through the body text and add <p> to the beginning of
every paragraph and </p> to the end of every paragraph. Since
line breaks are ignored, this is necessay to have your document
formatted correctly. If you don't do this, your page will be
really messed up. You can assign a name to a paragraph by using
<p ID="blort"> instead of <p>, where "blort" is the title of the
paragraph. This name is invisible to anyone looking at your
page, and it's use will be explained later.



 The next step is to add  a header to your document. The header
consists of global information concerning the entire page, such
as the title. To title your document, add the following between
the <HEAD> and <BODY> tags:



        <TITLE>Insert the title of your page here</TITLE>



        Links

A link is something that, when clicked on, takes you to another
page or another location in the current document. A link is
inserted in the following manner:



        <A HREF="location">text</A>



"Location" is replaced with either a URL, a filename, or a pound
sign followed by the name of a named paragraph. "text" is the
text that will be displayed. When you click on that text, you
will be taken to the location specified by "location."   If you
have a named paragraph defined with <P ID="blort"> then you can
insert a link to it in the same document with <A
HREF="#blort">Go to Blort</A>. If you have another page that is
part of your homepage called splorg.html, then you can add a
link to it with "location" being "splorg.html". If you want to
add a link to IBM's homepage, then the following would work:

<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">Go to IBM's home page</A>.

Text Formatting

        HTML allows for many types of text formatting, such as bold and
italic. They all follow a basic format of start tags and stop
tags. To turn bold on, use <b>. To turn it off, use </b>. You
can use any other tags in between.



<b>test <i>test </b>test </i>test<p>

test test test test



Have fun with your HTML!

In the next issue, we will explore Images, Backgrounds, Color,
and other ways to spice up your home page!

A Beginner's Guide To The Computer Underground - Part I

Written By Pazuzu 24-Mar-1993 at 13:30 in Long Beach, CA



PREFACE

Pazuzu wrote this infamous BEGELITE.TXT file on the 24th of
March, 1993, when he lived in Long Beach, California.  Since
then, much has changed, however, this still remains the
definitive beginner's reference.  Comments enclosed inside
[square brackets] are my own (Light Ray.)

FOREWORD

I, nor any SysOp or User of ANY BBS on which this file appears
are in any way liable for any damages caused by use of
information or ideas contained in this file.  This file serves
only to describe  and introduce the Computer Underground as I
myself view it, not to encourage illegal activity of any kind.



INTRODUCTION

The intended audience of this file is someone who has been
modeming for a while, and who has through some means discovered
that there exists a Computer Underground, and who wishes to
learn more about said Underground, and perhaps become a member
of same. If this does not fit you, please     destroy all
on-disk (or tape) and hardcopies of this file and go about
your happy life as if you never heard of it. But, if this does
fit you,     read on!



UNDERGROUND DIVISIONS

The Computer Underground is basically (although quite loosely)
divided into five main branches and one minor branch. I say
loosely because there is much crossover between the branches.
The branches are (in no particular order):

Phreaks - May also be referred to as "phreakers", etc. These
people deal with the telephone grid. They want to learn all they
can about how it works, and how they can control it, which often
leads to making telephone calls for free (which is of course
illegal).  Often groups of Phreakers will band together and form
an organized group, and publish articles on the subject.

Hackers - These are the people who love computer systems (and
networks) and who love to find out how they work, how to get
into them, etc. A TRUE Hacker is not the malicious scum that the
Media and Hollywood  would have you believe, he is just someone
who loves computers and computer networks. There's nothing wrong
with logging into someone's computer, so long as you don't go
deleting files or stealing trade secrets. NOTE: Hackers and
Phreakers are very often combined into one group, referred to as
h/p or p/h (for "phreak/hack").

Carders - These people are admittedly criminals. They use credit
card numbers, checks, checking account numbers, whatever,
fraudulently to obtain whatever they want for free. However,
this isn't as bad as the media wants you to think: You are NOT
LIABLE for charges made on your CC [credit card] account that
you didn't authorize, so the bank has to eat it, and that's why
they have insurance...

Anarchists - In the sense it's used in the Computer Underground,
an Anarchist is someone who loves to play with fire, explosives,
etc. This is not all bad either... Who cares if someone makes an
explosion out in the desert just to see what will happen?
[There are two forms of anarchists.  There are those that really
are anarchists - that is, they beleive that there should be no
government - and there are those that call themselves anarchists
and like to blow things up.]

Warez - Although I have never been a real supporter of warez
people (in fact, I have fought bitter wars over BBSs with them
for years) they DO serve a needed function in the underground:
They distribute software. They are pirates. Most warez are
distributed by warez groups which exist for the sole purpose of
getting the software out to BBSs before the other group gets
that same program out.

Virus/Trojan Dudes (for lack of a better term): These people are
usually programmers (although not always) who are interested in
how viruses and trojan horses work and how to make them more
efficient. For those who don't know, a virus replicates itself
and waits around before doing anything harmful. The program
which simply formats your hard drive upon execution IS NOT A
VIRUS, it is a trojan horse. This is the "minor" branch I spoke
of  earlier.

With that out of the way, I must restate that these divisions
may not always be very clear or noticeable. It is very common to
see a BBS with stuff from all of them on it (mine is one such
system). I just wanted to detail all the various activities
which comprise the Underground.

I mentioned in several of the above descriptions that groups of
like minded modemers often get together and form an organized
Group and publish Magazines (electronically, as files on BBSs),
or distribute warez. Some of the most famous Groups (some are
LOOOONNNGGG gone) are: LOD (Legion of Doom), CHiNA (Communist
Hackers in North America), CuD (Computer Underground Digest),
Phrack, P/HUN (Phreakers/Hackers Underground Network) - p/h
groups; THG (The Humble Guys), INC (International Network of
Crackers), the FiRM (First in Releasing Most) - warez groups. Of
course, there are/were MANY more, these are just     the most
common ones you'll see being referred to.



 TERMINOLOGY



Many new Undergrounders have trouble figuring out all the
terminology used and are of course afraid to make a post asking
for help for fear of looking lame, so I'll help with a simple
list...  [Of course, the opposite is also true.  You don't want
to use terminology excessively when you don't know what it
means.]



[A] General Underground Terminology



Data: This is the handle of someone who used to be a modemer. He
is now a worm feast (corpse). He basically pissed off too many
people by being a lame [beep] [beep], and got KILLED.  His real
name was Stuart Tay, I'm sure you've heard of him.  This term is
really great, and has SO, SO many uses... "He's a Data" ... "He
pulled a Data" ... etc etc etc  [However, this is fairly
escoteric and very infrequently used.  It's important to also
note that "Data" is a term refering to any collection of
information.]

Lamer: This is someone who claims to be knowledgeable/active in
some area of the underground, but in fact knows/does nothing. An
example would be a 2400bps user claiming to be a great warez
courier.

Leech: This is someone who calls BBSs and just downloads
everything in sight without contributing anything (or uploads
garbage just to get credits).



[B] Phreaking/Hacking Terminology



Extender: This is an important phreaking term. It refers to the
number you call when accessing a Long Distance Carrier's
service. An example is 950-1493, which is ThriftyTel's Extender.

ANI: Stands for Automatic Number Identification. If you call a
telephone number that has ANI, your number (and sometimes
address) shows up on a console at their location (or is logged
to a printer, disk file, etc). This is bad, since most private
long distance carriers use it to see who is calling their
extenders.  [This is usually known as Caller Identification,
CallerID, or CID.  More often ANI refers to a system where you
dial a number and the phone number that you are dialing from is
read off using a synthesized voice.  This is usefull in
troubleshooting and beige boxing.  Try calling 1-800-MY-ANI-IS
for an example.  Also, almost all 1-800, 1-900, and x11
(411,611,911,etc) numbers have CallerID.  CallerID will
theoretically be available nationwide for residence by 1996.]

ESS: Stands for Electronic Switching System. It is the system
most Bell Organizations use to switch calls. It is what makes
horrors like ANI possible.  [Also, such wonders as the Blue Box
and Black Box don't work on ESS]

Gestapo: This is used to refer to any security/law enforcement
agency. Its meaning should be obvious...

SS: Stands for Secret Service. Any similarities between "SS"
being used to refer to the Secret Service and the "SS" of Nazi
Germany during World War II is by no means coincidental, believe
me.  [The Secret Service protects the president and other
important people and busts hackers.  Wierd combination.]

CNA: This acronym stands for Customer Name/Address (also could
be CNL - Customer Name/Location). Basically, if you have the CNA
dialup for an area code, and someone's fone number in that area
code, you can call the CNA dialup and give their fone number,
and get their name and address. This is not as easy as it sounds
since some CNA dialups require talking to an operator, which may
be suspicious of you, plus you need the code. Some CNAs are
automated where you call and enter the number on a fone keypad,
then the code.  Some you call with your modem.  [Rumor has it
that CNA has been abolished and replaced with something new.
Not sure about this]

COSMOS: The fone company's operating system.

NPA: Stands for Numeral Prefix Allocation. An area code in
layman's terms.

Code Hacker: A program which repeatedly dials an extender,
trying different codes, and logging which ones are valid. This
is the main method which most phreaks use to get their fone
calls.

Telenet: This is a large network of computers. You call a
Telenet dialup, then if you know a machine's NUA (its address),
you type it in, and connect. This is good because there are
Telenet dialups local to everywhere, and then you can connect to
computers on the network no matter where they are. Other
networks like Telenet include Tymnet and the Internet (the
largest network on earth, a network of networks, really).
[Telenet and Tymnet operate on the X.25 protocol while the
Internet operates primarily using TCP/IP.  This is not to say
that they are not interconnected, however.]



[C] Carding/Scamming/Etc Terminology



CBI: This is a multi-use acronym which stands for Credit Bureau
Information. It is used to refer to: [1] the information given
by a credit reporting agency [2] the concept itself [3] a code
used to access such a service [4] it is also used by one such
reporting agency (namely Equifax) to refer to itself.
Basically, if you have a CBI access code (normally just called
"a CBI"), you can call a CBI dialup, enter the code, someone's
name and address (or their Social Security Number), and you will
get all credit info on them, including account numbers.  This is
quite useful as I'm sure you can see.

Drop Site: This is where the carder would have the carded
merchandise         sent to, since only a Data would send the
shit to his own house.



[D] Warez Terminology



Cracker: This is the person who actually breaks the copy
protection on a piece of software. This often involves using hex
editors, etc., and is usually quite difficult.

Courier: This is a person whose sole job is to upload the
cracked warez to as many BBSs as possible so as to distribute
the software as widely as possible.



[Warez: Pirated Software.  Formerly pronounced "wares" but I've
heard a lot of people pronouncing it "wear-ez."]



This is most of the terminology you will see popping up in
message bases and text files. I haven't (by any means) covered
all of the terms out there, but these are some of the most
common, and should help.



[In part II, we will cover techniques!]



Australian Military Bans Windows 95


The Australian Navy has banned the use of MicroSoft Windows 95
on its computers based on reports that Windows 95 sends
information from a user's computer back to MicroSoft.  The
"Registration Wizard" software which is integrated into Windows
95 has been previously described as a "viral routine" by
MicroSoft.  Now MicroSoft is saying that  it examines "the first
six applications found" and reports the findings back to
MicroSoft.  (It's probably for market research, but it's scary
giving ol' Bill a window into your computer and private data.)



Russian Hackers Hack Citibank, Move Money, Get Caught.



Russian hackers transfered a total of over ten million dollars
through the Citibank electronic funds transfer system from June
to October 1994.  The group of hackers was led by Vladimir
Levin, a 24 year old Russian employed by AOSaturn, a software
company, who had broken the Citibank  security system.  He and
six other people are now under arrest in London.



Catholic Net!



The Catholic Church has become one of the first major world
religions to have an official web presence.  See for yourself at
http://www.catholic.net. Yes, soon you will be able to confess
your sins via email!



Double Big Mac for $60

Connectix recently released their new Speed Doubler for
PowerMacs.   This software, available for a street price of
$60-$70 replaces the inefficient 68000 emulator from Apple.
Since most Macintosh software consists mainly of 68000 code
instead of native PowerPC code, this software effectively
doubles, triples, or quadruples the speed of a PowerMac.



Hackers Hack Hackers

Hackers from the Internet Liberation Front (ILF) hacked the
computer at DigiPlanet which held the home page for the movie,
Hackers.  They edited the text and graphics to tell the world
what they thought of the movie.  Strangely, instead of just
putting the old page back, DigiPlanet put the old page back and
added a link to the hacked page.  There's more than a little
speculation that DigiPlanet intentionaly ran an insecure system
to facilitate a hack for media attention to the movie, Hackers,
which at the time, was not yet released.  The bug exploited in
the hack was a world exported network file system (NFS) mount.
The hacked page is at
http://www.digiplanet.com/hackers/hacked/index.html.



Burning Apples

The Apple Macintosh PowerBook 5300 series has been recalled due
to several cases of them "bursting into flames" while in use.
Apple will continue manufacturing these computers with an older
type of battery that does not self ignite.



London Underground Hacked

A newly-recruited employee of the London Underground (that is,
the subway company) managed to hack into the system controlling
the dot matrix displays throughout the "tubes" on August 16th,
displaying joking messages such as "All signalmen are weeners."
Needless to say, he's no longer an employee.



Euro-Clipper!

The European Council approved a measure on September 8 to take
steps to make strong encryption illegal unless the key(s) are
supplied to the government(s).



Fake Check Successfully Deposited

Patrick Combs successfully deposited a fake check that he
received in the mail for $95,093.35, although the check had the
words "not negotiable for cash" on it.  For the details of this
interesting story, see
http://www.dnai.com/g-think/$$tablecontents.html.



AOL Bust

A two year FBI investigation of AOL (America Online) and its

The Story Of DnA Systems



DnA Systems, Inc. II is a computer bulletin board system
operated by the husband and wife team of Pazuzu & Zevaluz
located in Klinton Township, Michigan.  It is a BBS like no
other, for it houses the most diverse collection of message
bases and files assembled anywhere.  And all of this information
is accessible by anyone, free of charges other than normal phone
rates.

The system began its long and illustrious life back in the Fall
of 1989 as  a closed access phreak/hack system in Anaheim,
California called  Motel 666. The system was first put up
running WWIV 4.11, but soon after switched to Revolution when
Pazuzu joined the Revolution programming team.  By the time
Summer 1990 rolled around, Motel 666 was the second biggest p/h
system in Southern California, and the number of illegal calls
logged to 714-229-8513 was, to quote U.S. Sprint, "obscene".
Sometime around December 1990 January 1991, financial troubles
forced the sale of the computer which ran the system and Motel
666 went down.

In late 1991, Pazuzu again put the system back up, again as a
closed  access underground system under various names (couldn't
decide on the perfect name). Now located  in Costa  Mesa,
California  at 714-646-9180,  the system was ran under various
BBS packages, finally ending up with LSD.  But soon after, more
financial problems arose  and again the  sale of the  computer
which ran the board was forced.

In the Spring  of 1993, the  system was again  put on-line at
the same phone number, this time running Renegade 04-16 and
named Minas Morgul.  Soon after, Pazuzu co-founded the
electronic magazine known as DnA, and the system's name was
changed to DnA Systems, Inc.   Around August, a user named
Zevaluz first logged onto DnA.  By the time November rolled
around, Pazuzu and Zevaluz were very much in love,  and Zevaluz
proposed (!!!!!)  to Pazuzu, and not  being a fool, he accepted.
  Soon afterwards,  the question  of who  moves where was posed.
  You see,  Pazuzu  still  lived  in California, while Zevaluz
lived (lives) in Michigan.   Given the high crime rate and
obscenely high cost of living if California, the choice was easy
and Pazuzu made plans to move to Michigan.  Now, moving out of
state is far from cheap, and the board would have to go down
anyway, so Pazuzu sold the computer which ran DnA.  DnA went
down around January 5, 1994.

 It's now  late August 1995, and we're happily married (as of
September 30, 1994).  We've been through a lot in the 18 months
we've been together, including having a totally unexpected baby
(born March 2, 1995).  We've finally, as of May 1995, got our
BBS back up under the name DnA Systems, Inc. II to denote the
second incarnation of DnA Systems, Inc.

There are several things which  make this incarnation of my
system different than all the rest.  The first and foremost is
that I am much older and  wiser now than I was in 1989.  I was
18 then, I'm 24 now.  I'm in a much different life  situation
now  --  I'm  married,  happily,  and have a very secure and
wonderful job as a programmer for a software company.  The
second is that the computer which runs DnA doesn't even belong
to me -- it's a fringe benefit on loan from my company --  this
means I can't sell it.  The system is finally "here to stay".

On the technical side, the system is composed of a carefully
selected, high performance mix of hardware and software.

On the hardware side, the system is composed  of: an SiS chipset
Pentium motherboard using the PCI bus standard with a built-in
high performance NCR 53c810 SCSI controller, an Intel 90  MHZ
Pentium CPU, 16MB of 72-pin  memory, an  ATI  mach32
accelerated  graphics  card, a Creative Labs Sound Blaster
AWE/32, a Micropolis 2110 (1GB) SCSI  hard disk, a Micropolis
2217 (1.7GB) SCSI hard disk, an NEC 4Xi Quad Speed SCSI CD-ROM
drive, a WangTek 1300 SCSI DAT drive, a USRobotics Sportster
v.34  modem, a Teac 1.44MB 3.5" disk  drive and a Samtron 15"
monitor.   All of  this (except  the monitor  & modem, of
course) is housed in a black mid-tower case.

On the software side,  the system runs on the best products
available.   Our operating system of choice is IBM's OS/2
Version 3 ("Warp").  This is set up following the hints given in
Tobin  Fricke's OS/2 Sysop's FAQ -- those hints give a 4-5X
speed increase over stock OS/2.   We are using Ray Gwinn's SIO
version 1.45A to handle our serial ports -- the only way to do
things under OS/2.  To handle our FTN network traffic, we use
Chris Irwin's D'Bridge, version 1.58.  This also packs &
unpacks our echomail.  For file echo (TIC) processing, we use
Allfix, version 4.31E, the standard TIC processor for 1995.
Our BBS  software is Windowed Modem  Environment  (WME), version
1.10-A7, written by  Jason Fesler, and  now being developed  by
Tom Ordelman. This software  is extremely  configurable, very
unique, and  has a very wide variety of message base standards
supported (JAM, Squish, Husdon, *.MSG).

We offer our  users the most  diverse collection of  message
bases and  files ever assembled.   We are, to  quote Reverend
Ivan  Stang, "plenty blasphemous enough to qualify for temple
[of the Church of the SubGenius] status".

We are a member  of no less than  10 FTN's (Fido Technology
Networks).  They are (in no particular order):

DnANet (we're the Eastern u.S. HQ - 66:810/0):  This is a net I
started  back in 1993 when DnA Magazine became popular.  It's
still going today. Topics discussed include phreaking, hacking,
viruses, bombs, taxation, personal Sovereignty, and Law.

CyberCrime International (66:2810/110):   This network started
quite a while ago (1992 I think), and I was one  of the first
nodes, back when I was still in California.  It's the best
underground network ever.  Topics include: wares (pirated
software), ANSi  & ASCII art, phreaking, hacking, explosives,
data encryption, and the Internet.

GODNet (143:1810/2000  - 810  hub):  This network exists mostly
as a file network, but has several message areas as well.
Topics include music, the occult, and sex.

PatriotNet (976:1776/1493):  This is a network catering to true
Patriots (which both operators are).  Topics include militias,
government massacres, Sovereignty, and firearms.

MasqueNet (235:2109/103):  This network is headquartered in
Australia and is geared towards those interested in the Gothic
culture.  Topics include: body modification such as tattooing
and piercing, murder, vampires, and Gothic music.

NuitNet (666:666/1493):  This network is geared towards the
serious occultist (again, which we both are).  Topics include:
tarot, rituals, voodoo, tantra, Thelemic orders, and thee Temple
ov Set.

50h-Net (101:220/200 - Eastern Michigan Hub):  This is a
programmer's network (I program professionally).  There are
areas for C, Pascal, BASIC,  assembly, communications
programming, etc.

NuKENet (111:810/0 - Michigan Hub):  This is the network run by
the infamous virus research and authoring group NuKE.  Topics
are all virus-related.

FidoNet (1:120/472):   The largest FTN (obviously) in the world.
 While we don't actually receive any echomail from Fido, we
maintain an address so we can receive and send mail to any Fido
node in the world.

 We also have a huge collection of files available for download.
 We are actually one of the few systems in the world that
constantly

generates new Occult and Political text files.

While our file collection is much to voluminous to list out
here,  our files include:  music lyrics; BBS software; network
utilities;  Chaos magick; voodoo;  astrology; Temple ov Set
files; hacking utilities; phreaking utilities; viruses; virus
creation kits; DnA Magazine; Phrack; P/HUN; Cult ov thee Dead
Cow; ATI;  UxU;  carding text files; info on: waco, weaver,
taxation, sovereignty, Law; complete text of the entire United
States code; Satanism; Linux; Holy Temple of Mass Consumption;
The Stark Fist of Removal Online; Church of Euthanasia; info on:
Marijuana, MDMA, LSD, Crack, Heroin, 'Shrooms... and the list
goes on.

And all of this Data is accessible by anyone with a modem
capable of speeds at or above 300 bits per second.   There are
no post-to-call ratios, upload-to-download ratios, fees, tests,
or anything to stop you from downloading every file on the
system if you so choose.  Posting is not required.  We would
rather have no messages than a bunch of bullshit "jack up the
ratio"  messages.   However, we've found that this arrangement
actually encourages posting.  The first time you call,  you'll
go through a standard new user logon procedure.   Feel free to
lie about your address, real name, phone number, gender, age, or
whatever.   You will then be logged off. However, within 8
hours, you WILL be granted access by the operators and may call
back and do whatever you wish.

We realize that no everyone will agree with everything on our
system and 90% of people will likely  find something on the
system which offends them.   If you find that something on the
system offends you, please behave as an adult and simply remove
the offending file area or message base from your newscan and
forget it exists.

 Well, the only remaining piece of information about the system
you need is the phone number.  It's (810)792-0032.

Hope to see you online soon!

  New York, __ -- People for the Ethical Treatment of Software
(PETS) announced today that seven more software companies have
been  added to the group's "watch list" of companies that
regularly  practice software testing.

  "There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so
that  companies like these can market new products," said Ken
Granola,  spokesperson for PETS.  "Alternative methods of
testing these  products are available."

  According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo
lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or
days at a  time.  Employees are assigned to "break" the software
 by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they
often joke about "torturing' the software.

  "It's no joke," said Granola.  "Innocent programs, from the
day they  are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and
'crashed' for hours on  end.  They spend their whole lives on
dirty, ill-maintained  computers, and are unceremoniously
deleted when they're not needed anymore."

  Granola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and
is  infested with bugs.

  We know alternatives to this horror exist," He said, citing
industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has
become  extremely successful without resorting to software
testing.

The following is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that
went out to all IBM Branch Offices.  The person who wrote it was
serious.

Abstract:  Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)
 Mouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse
fails to operate or  should  it  perform erratically,  it may
need a ball  replacement. Because  of the delicate nature of
this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be
attempted by properly trained personnel.

   Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse  balls by
examining the underside of the mouse.   Domestic balls will be
larger and harder than foreign  balls.    Ball removal
procedures   differ  depending  upon manufacturer of the mouse.
     Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method.
Domestic  balls   are replaced  using the  twist-off method.
Mouse  balls  are not   usually  static sensitive.  However,
excessive handling can result in  sudden discharge.  Upon
completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be  used
immediately.

  It  is  recommended  that  each replacer have a pair of spare
balls for maintaining  optimum  customer satisfaction,  and
that  any  customer missing his  balls should  suspect  local
personnel  of  removing  these necessary items.



To re-order, specify one of the following:

P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls

VIRUSES - OCTOBER UPDATE


BOBBET VIRUS: Removes a vital part of your hard disk then
re-attachs it. (But that part will never work again.)

OPRAH WINFREY VIRUS: Your 200MB hard drive suddenly shrinks to
80MB, and then slowly expands back to 200MB.

AT&T VIRUS: Every three minutes it tells you what great service
you are getting.

MCI VIRUS: Every three minutes it reminds you that you're paying
too much for the AT&T virus.

PAUL REVERE VIRUS: This revolutionary virus does not horse
around. It warns you of impending hard disk attack---once if by
LAN, twice if by C:>.

POLITICALLY CORRECT VIRUS: Never calls itself a "virus", but
instead refers to itself as an "electronic microorganism."

The Conscience of a Hacker
Written By  The Mentor on January 8, 1986

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.
"Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested
after Bank Tampering..."

Damn kids.  They're all alike.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's
technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?
Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him,
what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most
of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers
explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I
understand it.  "No Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it
in my head..."

Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second,
this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a
mistake, it's because I screwed up. ...Not because it doesn't
like me... ...Or feels threatened by me... ...Or thinks I'm a
smart ass... ...Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.



And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing
through the phone lines like heroin through an addict's veins,
an electric pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day
incometencies is sought... a board is found.

"This is it... this is where I belong..."

I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never
talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you
all...

Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the
switch, the beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service
already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if
it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us
criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without
skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and
you call us criminals.

You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat and lie
to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet
we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of
curiosity.  My crime is that of judging people by what they say
and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of
outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this
individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all
alike.
