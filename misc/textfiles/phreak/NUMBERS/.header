<H1>Phone Phreaking: Telephone Scans And General Numbers</H1>
<P>
By simply calling every telephone number in an exchange, you could find some
of the most amazing things (as well as hundreds of angry citizens you'd woken
up in the middle of the night). Test numbers, numbers that told you where you
were calling from, odd recordings, you name it. An easy way to make a name for
yourself was to simply choose a given telephone exchange, dial everything in
it, and casually report all the great stuff you'd found.
<P>
If time-consuming scanning wasn't your bag, you could just do a little side
research in government and public documents, and find out interesting phone
numbers as well.
<P>
Finally, you'll find some files that dealt specifically with the telephone
numbers themseves; how the Phone Company assigned them, what they consisted
of, what interesting issues were being raised by how the telephone system
itself was arranged.
