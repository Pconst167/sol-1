A word to the wise :

Originally I wrote a textfile called 800-BBS.TXT. wihch explained how to 
setup and 800 number to your BBS.  A warning, THIS IS NOT SAFE anylonger.
AT&T has caught on, and in addition to veryifing that you actually ordered
the service, now they call you in a week to verify again, if they get a
Modem or Fax machine they find out who owns the local number [the BBS] and
calls them up, and even if you deny it, they can still make you pay the 
fee.  It is very expensive and AT&T aint fucking around any longer.  They
are busting boards now left and right, so if you wanna take the risq and do
it, be my guest,just keep in mind, there is now a 80% chance of getting busted
Also AT&T logs every call coming into a BBS [8oo number] and even tho they
have never done it to me, they might call to ask if you know the person at
the 800.  There is alot of ppl who have read my textfile and have been 
enlightened into how to do it, but you really didnt expect that AT&T was
going to let this go on forever, did you?

        I really dont care if you read this and care or not, im just warning
you becuz a few friends of mine who have used this method have had to pay       
outstanding bills of 10,000 dollars, no joke..  So i warned you, do whatever
