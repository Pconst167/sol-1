                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All three lines, 651-6xxx, 652-7xxx, 651-0xxx are equipped with Caller ID.
* On all calls, the number came through as "-OUT OF AREA-".
* The date&time data in the xx/xx/1995 line are taken from the Caller ID at 
  the time of the call.
* Durations of calls were established with the use of a timer (on my watch).
* LD Carrier codes (10xxx) that allow 1-700-LOCAL-NO calls were obtained by 
  manual scanning (the only thorough way).
* All calls were made from areacode 305 -- "NORTH DADE    FL" to be exact.
* All calls were also made _to_ "NORTH DADE    FL" (same house).
* "NO MENTION OF THIS CALL" doesn't necessarily mean the call is free, but
  probably that its billing is slower than it should be (1 month).

Usefulness of 10xxx-1-700-LOCAL-NO, mainly:

a. Caller ID on receiving end gets "-OUT OF AREA-".
b. Call cannot be *69ed.
c. Supposed free local calling (in areas where get charged for local).
   (Turned out to be false for most carriers tested).
d. Supposed free 555-1212 in your areacode (AKA 411).
   (Turned out to be false for MCI for sure -- got billed for it, $0.40)

Notes:
* Budget call STARTED charged me for federal & local taxes on my July 4
  bill, yet on the June 4 bill I was NOT charged for any taxes.  Why?
* Some of the calls show up on the bill as a minute later (as compared with
  the time obtained from the Caller ID display).  Perhaps this is because
  I picked up the call after the second ring, meanwhile the minute has
  changed.  Does that mean if I call someone and let the phone ring for 4
  minutes the CID will show the time of the beginning of the call while
  the bill will show the CID time plus 4 minutes?  (Something to check...)
