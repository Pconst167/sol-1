                                800 Lookup!

    What this file does is simply allow you to check and see who owns a
particaular 800 Prefix.  It is not complex to use, but it may come in handy.
(Dont mess with Teleconnect Co. esp. 476-9696.)  It is real simple to use, run
it without any command line for instructions.  If you have any problems,
questions, nags, bug fixes, or money contact me on Landfill.  Keep phreaking
alive in the 90's!

    What the output means:

    1) AT&T (Frozen) - This simply means that it is one of the prefixes that
       Bellcore "froze", until AT&T shows that it has 70% of its capacity was
       being used.
    2) AT&T (Assignable) - One of the numbers AT&T can resell.
       Everything else seemed self explanatory to me, so if you have the IQ of
       an eggplant, you shouldnt have any problems.
    3) This is the most recent directory of prefixes available to my knoledge.
       It is dated for early 1992.
