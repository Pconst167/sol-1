Here are a few TELENET numbers to try fo
r some fun and games:
You will have to figure out password cod
es in most cases
yourself. Just dial your local TELENET s
witch, then try one of
the following:
C 21288  American Express Company -(type
 command "Information")
C 30155  Newsnet 75
C 201220  "D PVM"  I don't know what thi
s means.
C 31240  SLVAX 1   Ditto
C 31233  Credit Information Corporation 
Time Sharing
C 31250  American Hospital Supply Corp. 
Waukegan, IL
C 31243/44  TRAVENOL  Systems A/B
C 21220  IRVI  I don't know what this me
ans.
C 617138    (here's a goody for you!!)
C 31340  Alternate Network ** Acct # 130
0-7777 
         Password "AID" to read the help
 files. This
         is an international system alot
 like TELENET
         serving England, Australia, etc
 and the code
         shown here is the interchange b
etween them 
         and TELENET. Of course, the abo
ve account
         number and password is a "demo"
 for new clients
         of their system. In addition th
is people have
         local access numbers in most co
mmunities; see
         the section on "local access" i
n the above.
C 41527  Stanford University WYLBUR syst
em. Answer with
         "HX.GST" to account number, and
 NO password is
         needed. 
In future messages, I shall discuss more
 TELENET numbers
if anyone is interested, plus similar it
ems from DATAPAC,
the Canadian "cousin" to TELENET.

In reference to message 61, here are a f
ew local dial up TELENET
lines for those who may not know them:
In White Plains area  (914) 328-9199
Manhattan  (212) 736-0099  / 947-9600 / 
785 - 2540
Buffalo    (716) 847-0600
Rochester  (716) 454-3430  / 454-1020
Boston     (617) 338-1400
Detroit    (313) 964-5538 /  964-2989
Chicago    (312) 938-0500
Wash  DC   (202) 347-1400  / (703) 435-3
333 
Of course, there are literally THOUSANDS
 of them, far too many
to list all, but the above should serve 
most users of this BBS.
For Next ==> All searchers for TELENET n
umbers should be alert
to the TELENET numbering scheme, which i
s this: The letter C
as in "connect" is always the first thin
g to type. Then, the 
next three digits always indicate the TE
LEPHONE AREA CODE being
searched. Example: You want to find thin
gs in Chicago? You will
always type C 312xx. The final two (some
times 3 !!) digits is
the system being called. So for ease in 
searching, you can begin
for example with C 21201 and work your w
ay up to C 21299. You
will get one of the following replies in
 about 99 percent of the
cases: ==>  212xx connected  (or) 212xx 
not responding  (or)
212xx illegal address. Sometimes you wil
l also receive the
reply 212xx Does not accept collect call
s. Please establish
a paid caller account. In most cases, th
e computer systems on
TELENET take "collect" calls from whomev
er calls them, but a few
require you to establish a specific log 
on with TELENET first,
(in order to place a "paid call") to a g
iven computer. I
hope this discussion is useful to people
 who enjoy finding new
systems to experiment with, as I do.

I highly recommend the proceedure mentio
ned here earlier for
staying OUT OF TROUBLE with "the competi
tion". Look for your
own passwords. Don'u use the ones posted
 on BBS's except maybe
once, to "get a feel" of how the particu
lar switch works. If
possible, test the codes between 8 - 11 
AM to detirmine if they
are business codes or not. When possible
, use a local loop to
call into/out of to the switch you are u
sing. This simply adds
more frustration in the event anyone is 
tracing. When possible,
STAY AWAY completely from these OCC's, o
pting instead to use the
Wats lines from large companies, via the
ir remote call in ports.
You always want to stay away from system
s that individually 
account for each call, as MCI/Sprint do.
 WATS lines, on the
other hand, especially in older exchange
s, do not record every
number called - just the total time the 
line was in use, in
hours per month. In either case....have 
your phun now!! Cause
after the Final Judgement and Settlement
 is implemented next
year, you will place <<all>> long distan
ce calls by merely
dialing the number desired, and entering
 a two digit "choice
of carrier" code (for ATT, MCI, Sprint, 
Allnet, etc) and your
local central office will use ANI to sup
ervise your call! The
outfits like MCI will discontinue dealin
g with the public as
such, and will only deal <with other tel
ephone companies> who
in turn will act like billing/collection
 agents for MCI, etc.
Watch and see! The times are changing! N
o more phucking around!
