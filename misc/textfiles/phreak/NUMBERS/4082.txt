In the past years the 950 exchanges became very popular within many big cities 
and suburban areas of the nation.  This was about the time that all of the 
"other" long distance carriers came into the world of communications.  AT&T no lo
longer took the spotlight.  Now there was ITT, MCI, US Telecom (Sprint), 
Allnet, Lifeline, Skyline, and many others.  950s were a step towards the 
future bringing all the long distance companies into one dialup that could be 
accessed by all phones within the area. 
For one thing it brought all these companies into an available area that was 
mostly the same dialup for the entire nation.  So if you were talking to 
someone in New Jersey and you lived in California it meant that you might 
have to find the dialup for let's say Sprint in New Jersey or whatever.  
With 950's the Sprint dialup in most areas of the nation, a few exceptions, 
is 950-1033. This meant a new era for phreaks with the easibility to give 
codes to people across the nation with very easy dialups.  
There was one draw back, these 950s were found to be relatively unsafe as 
found by such people as The Fugitive (619) got fined several thousands of 
dollars when caught using the allnet 950.  Other people such as The Guy (213), 
Smart Ass (415), and many others have been caught using 950s for numbers of 
reasons.  950s are relatively safe though, especially when compared to Company 
owned 800s.
Unlike the AT&T 102880 long distance operators (which are not voice) the 950s 
are not insta-trace.  AT&T is almost completely phreak free in the recent days.
To use AT&T codes you must use fortress.  As soon as you connect with the 
operator at AT&T the little tramp has your phone number plus id code on her 
computer screen.  The computer then saves your phone number until the AT&T 
calling card bill has been paid with no complaints.  So it would be very 
unwise to even attempt to use AT&T codes from your own phone! 
I will tell you about some of the various 950 dialups within the 408 area. 
Some of these may vary within your area so do not rely on this as a dialup 
sheet.  Look for 408 Alliance 950 dialups.  It will list them all for all of 
the area codes.
Allnet has two dialups:  950-1044 or 950-1444.  950-1044 is a six digit code 
with a code about ever thousand tries.  950-1044s codes last only two weeks 
so by the time you scan them out and start using them they rarely lastd more 
than a half day or two days.  950-1444s codes last only one week so by the 
time you scan them out and start using them they do not last more than a half 
day or two days.  Allnet is a company designed on people who travel alot on 
business all over the nation and to get in touch with their companies fast. 
MCI codes are the hardest to phreak.  They are set up so you dial 950-1022 
then dial 0 + Number you want to dial+card number.  The card number is usually 
your phone number + four digit code.  So if you had a code it would look like 
408-371-0000-9933.  MCI requires a special scanner preferably The Code 
Infiltrator.  MCI is a personal company more than a business company.  Some 
people use them as a relatively business card but are mainly used for personal 
uses.
Sprint is set up as either a sprint FON card or as a regular code.  They are 
set up so you dial 950-1033 then dial 0 + Number you want to dial + card 
number.  The card number is usually your phone number + four digit code.  So 
if you had a code it would look like 408-371-0000-9933.  Sprint requires a 
special scanner preferably The Code Infiltrator.  950-1033 then dial code + 
number you want to dial. The code is a 8 digit code.  Sprint is a personal 
company more than a business company.  Some people use it for shopping even.
Skyline is a company like jointly owned by IBM/ITT.  It is a 6 digit code. 
950-1088 then dial code + number you want to dial.  Skyline is precautious 
of users so generally people stay away from it.  IBM is full of jews who 
like to protect there money and do not put up with scanners.  Be careful.  
Skyline is a option available only if you are a employee of ITT or IBM.  
Lexitel is set up as a 7 digit code.  950-1066 then dial code + number you 
want to dial.  Lexitel is a company that operates buy selling cheap codes to 
people to save money on long distance charges.  Lexitel does not work in the 
408 area.
Here is a list of the 950s for the 408 area code.  This may or may not work 
in your area:

                  950-1022 MCI (14)
                  950-1033 Sprint (8) (14)
                  950-1044 Allnet (6)
                  950-1087 Unknown (6)
                  950-1088 Skyline (6)
                  950-1099 Unknown (6)   
                  950-1444 Allnet (8)
                  950-1999 Unknown (6)
