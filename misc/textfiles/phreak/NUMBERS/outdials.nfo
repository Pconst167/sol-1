* believed to work, but untested or didn't respond when it was tested!

This list was obtained from chatsubo.nersc.gov where it was posted.
It was originally obtained by the poster from Hardcore Phreaks, whatever
the hell that is i'm not familiar with it.

i haven't tested any of these myself but will next week.  I will uload an
updated list as to what works and what doesn't.  Enjoy!
