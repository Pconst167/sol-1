The following is a listing of the current CHICAGO "976" 
phone numbers. For those of you who do not know what "976"
numbers are, it is a prefix used throughout the country for
users to dial and recieve recorded messages. These messages
vary, as the oncoming list will attest to! All 976 numbers
follow the format of :  "976-xxXX", where xx and XX are the
same. Therefore, in the list, phone# "12" would be dialed
as "976-1212". Got it? ............. Leo Langevin

Caveat: These messages are usually one minute in length, usually for a
local charge or a flat rate of 50c/min.  If any are encountered that are
in excess of 1 min., the additional minute charge may be exorbitant! - AAC
