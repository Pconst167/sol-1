     The PACT (Prefix Access Code Translator) feature provides preliminary
translation data for features using access codes that are prefixed by a special
code. A standard numbering and dialing plan requires that individual line and
small buisness customers(custom) calling use prefixed access code dialing for
feature access. PACTis offered on a per office basis. The PACT is NOT used for
the interpretation of centrex dialing customers.
     When a call is originated by the customer, a call register is used to
store the data about the call. The customer dials a prefix and a 2 digit access
code (table a). The PACT then looks at the digits to determine what action
should take place. Reorder or special service error messages will be heard if
you enter an unassigned code. If the code is accepted, the that particular
action will be performed. The PACT consists of the PACT head table and the
prefixed access code translator. The PACT feature allows the dialing of a
special code for a prefix. These are the '*' and '#'. If you have rotary, then
'11' and '12' are used respectively. To use PACT, the prefix must be followed
by a 2-digit code. This combination is then defined in terms of type and
subtype (table b).

    The subtranslator is always built 100 words long. A word is a binary code
which when sent as a whole, act as a command. One word is equal to a 2-digit
access code. This subtranslator contains the PTW (Primary Translation Word).
The PTW contains the feature type subtype and feature subtype index to
determine the function of the dialed code. The feature subtype allows four
subtype tables to exist for feature type 31 (LASS). Index 0 is for LASS. Index
1 is used for LASS on a pay per usage basis. Index 2 and 3 are currently not
used. If you have access to a recent change system, you can create PACTS by
using the following (This is for your CO only).

    1. Use the SUBTRAN message to seize program {tore for the PACT head table
       and initialize it at 0. Also seize program store for the subtranslator
       and initialize it at 0 also.

    2. Use the PSWD message to build the PACT subtranslator per table a using
       table b. Link the PACT subtranslator, head table, and master head
       table.
