Just one suggestion: if you're going to bother using coded names,
don't use collect calls, call person-to-person.  You usually expect a
collect call to succeed, and the telco may notice a lot of refused
calls to a certain place.  But you bother calling person-to-person
when you expect difficulty getting through (it's a *great* way to
bypass n layers of secretaries!), so the usage patterns aren't as
suspicious.

It's quite possible the telco will listen in and keep track of numbers
with lots of refused collect calls, although I don't know what they
can do about it after the fact.  Theoretically, they could intercept
those lines to human operators, but it's an awful lot of work, and
won't help if the problem becomes sufficiently widespread.

At least around here, "operator-assisted" is a flat fee, so if I'm
making a collect long-distance call, I often ask for a specific
person.
