Hey, Let's play the 700 Club game!

     By now you've probably heard of the great victory of the Amerikkkan people
over the bigoted, sexist forces of evil -- THE MORAL MAJORITY.  In less than 6
months, free-thinking people like yourself sent a clear message to the
meglomaniacal Jerry Falwell and his Right-Wing Stormtroopers.  Amerikkka does
not need to have it's morality and values dictated to it by a group of
narrow-minded, self-righteous, elitist pigs!  Thanks to the phone-in campaign -
THE FALWELL GAME - Rev. Jerry is many millions of dollars in debt and his
organization is in serious trouble.  We may have stopped Jerry, but his good
buddy Pat Robertson and his "700 Club" are now posing a greater threat to our
Liberty and Freedom than Jerry ever did.  Not only does Pat regularly deceive a
large number of TV viewers of his "Christian" Broadcasting Network by bilking
them out of millions of dollars anually, but he is also running for the
presidency of the United States (Can you believe it?).  In Michigan, Pat has
out-spent his right-wing rivals, Bush and Kemp, in preparation for the Primary
there and has a majority of the possible Republican delegates.  He has proven
to be a formidable candidate for the Republican nomination and may become an
influential power-broker in the 1988 elections.  Robertson's strength "lies" in
his ability to raise huge amounts of cash through TV appeals, free phone lines,
and direct mailings, not to mention generous support from rich Reactionary
Greed-Heads and Corporations (and Joe-Q Businesspig).  But, as has been shown
with THE FALWELL GAME, the power of the media can be turned against those who
seek to manipulate it. Once again, we turn to the phone as our weapon of
Anarchy.  Thus, again, a game:

                         THE 700 CLUB GAME

     It is simple to play.  You just pick up your phone and dial 1-800-446-0700
(anytime 7 days a week, so they claim).  When someone answers, just hang up.
>CLICK<!  There, *YOU* just cost Pat one dollar.  I feel better already, don't
you?  (I can just see Pat on the screen saying "I know someone out there has
been healed through the works of the Lord..."  Just think how therapeutic
auto-dialing can be!)  See how it all adds up?  But do not just hang up.  Talk
to the fanatic on the other end.  Aggravate them - CAT's MEOW can be nice for
this sort of thing.  Pledge money (Don't worry about paying it, though.)  Get
on their mailing list (or get someone else on their mailing list, while you're
at it.  Gotta spread some of that 'Good Word' around, you know!) - you receive
a monthly copy of "Touchpoint", plus you receive POSTAGE-PAID envelopes for
your donations.  Send it back empty, so it costs them money for that, too.  You
might even want to enclose pentagrams, charred ashes, passages from the Satanic
Bible, "The Book of Shadows", or lyrics - Pink Floyd lyrics from "The Wall" or
lyrics from Led Zep's "Stairway to Heaven" or Depeche Mode's "Blasphemous
Rumours" or something equally satanic to get your message across - that
'personal' touch.  Be creative.  Change your address while you're at it.  And
there's always my trademark of sending monopoly money...  And just think of the
trouble and expense it would cost them to send their monthly Blasphemer to
addresses that didn't exist or zip-codes yet to be assigned?  That big "Return
to Sender/Postage Cancelled" stamped all over it should be a big thrill to Pat
at G.O.D. headquarters.

     Remember, that number again is:

                     /%> 1-800/446-0700 <%\

'Pat Robertson - a step in the Reich direction.'  Makes a good add-campaign
slogan, don't you think?  So go ahead, let your conscience be your guide. Sound
the Fascist alert!  Dial that number!  Dial it at least a couple of times a
day; it doesn't cost *YOU* anything.  

     Call Infinity's Edge at 805/683-2725 and let us know about your progress
and scamming.  Mention our Articles and where you've seen them and gain higher
