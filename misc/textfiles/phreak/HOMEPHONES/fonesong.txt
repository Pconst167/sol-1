Important Notice: If you pick up your phone and start playing some hip 
  tunes to yourself via push buttons you may find yourself connected to
  and angry Libyan.  Before playing a tune be sure to do one of the following:
 
 1- Call a friend, and bother them with your push-button madness.
 2- (If using a modem) Disconnect the phone line, and turn the Modems speaker 
    on (Issue an ATM1 command, if Hayes compatible) and enjoy.
 3- Call the local 'Weather and Time' recording, or other similar Recording,
    and play away.. I hear these Taped Operators like music.
 4- Call a friends answering machine, and bother them silly.

 When experimenting with this 'fun stuff' read the buttons/lyrics as a sing 
 along 'Follow the bouncing ball' type deal, it's quite simple. Really.. 

 Thats about all I can think of that I have to get out of the way before 
 embarking on this joyous journey into Push-button phone song land..
 
             Enjoy....  Ron, of course.

  Well, thats about all I can come up with for now.. Maybe at a later date I
  will scrape up some more of this silliness, and bother to put it in a text
  file (don't hold your breath) or maybe (this is a stronger possibility) I
  will make some of these songs into Telix scripts, or dialing directories.
  That might prove to be interesting.. Hope you had as much fun as I did.
  
     ..Ron
