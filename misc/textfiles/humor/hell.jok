Subject: HELL


Can anyone please answer this one simple question?


Why are the only funny bits of the riddles the stupid answers that the 
sender gets when everyone is thouroughly p*ssed off with the riddle?

I couldn't think of a joke myself, so I stole this one off Rowan Atkinson:









Hello, nice to see you all again.

As the more perceptive of you have probably realised by now - this is
hell, and I am the Devil.  Goodevening. You can call me Toby, if you like -
we try and keep things  informal down here, as well as infernal.

Now,  you're all here for eternity,  which I hardly need tell you  is a sod
of a long time, so  you  get to know everyone pretty well  by the end, but
for now I'll have to split you  up into groups.

Are there any questions?

No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets, if you'd read your bible you would
have seen that it was damnation without relief. So, I'm afraid if you didn't
go before you came then you're not going to enjoy yourself very much, but 
then, I believe that's the general idea.

Right, let's split you up then.

Can you all hear me?
CAN YOU HEAR ME AT THE RACK?

Off we go...

Murderers, over here. Looters and pillagers - over there please, thieves if you
could join them, and BANKMANAGERS.

Fornicators, if you could step forward - My God there are a lot of you.
Could I split you up into adulterers and the rest? Adulterers if you could
just form a line in front of that small guillotine there.

AMERICANS, are you here?  I'm sorry about this, apparently God had some
fracas with your founding fathers and damned the entire race into perpetuity.
He sends particular condolences to the Mormans who He realises put in a lot
of work.  The Iranians, I'm afraid, couldn't be with us - someone's been
holding them in purgatory for the last nine months.

Sodomites, over there against the wall.

Atheists, over here please. You must be feeling a right bunch of charlies.

Christians, ah yes, I'm afraid the Jews were right.

Moonies, maniacs, marmite eaters, male models, masochists, mass murderers and
masseurs, if you could take a pew at the back - with the Methodists that is.

Now, you're the lot who used to kill whales, is that right? Ah, yes, I must
remember - I've got some strips to tear off you bastards later.

Everyone who saw Monty Pythons' "Life Of Brian", I'm afraid He can't take
a joke after all.

Alright now, one final thing - we're trying to implement some sort of exchange
scheme with the Lord God Almighty, or Cliff as we know him. Some of you
will spend a decade in heaven and we're having some angels down here.  Now,
I hardly need tell you that you will be expected to behave in an exemplary
manner, so, I hope you will do the exact opposite - tear off their wings, use
their holoes for frisbee practice, that sort of thing.

Well, I have to go now, but Beelzebub here will show you the ropes







chains,







and electrodes.

I'll just leave you with a favourite joke of mine  - 


          Knock, knock
          Who's there?
          Death.
          Death wh..........

I hope you enjoyed that little joke more than I enjoyed the pathetic riddles
that have been infecting the network recently
