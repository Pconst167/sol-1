'm as sick of riddles in this group as anyone, but since they won't go away
here is an attempt to stem the flow by out-riddling the riddlers.
What follows is a document that came into my possession some years ago.
Apologies if it's not new, but then it cant be any worse than some of the
ancient riddles recently observed here.
Apologies also to those readers whose native language is not English as some
of the colloquillisms may not be familiar.

This test does not measure your intelligence, your fluency with words and
certainly not your mathematical ability. It will, however, give you some
gauge of your mental flexibility. Few people will solve more than half the
25 answers at the first attempt. Many, however, report  getting answers long
after the test has been set aside, particularly at unexpected moments when
minds are relaxed. Some report solving questions over a period of several days.

2.  7 = D of the W                       15. 4 = Q in a G
3.  1001 = A N                           16. 24 = H in a D
4.  12 = S of the Z                      17. 1 = W on a U
5.  54 = C in a D (with Js)              18. 5 = D in a Z C
