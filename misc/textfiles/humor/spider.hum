I make a Tarantula bite the leg of a young, well-fledged Sparrow, readyto leave the nest. A drop of blood flows; the wounded spot issurrounded by a reddish circle, changing to purple. The bird almostimmediately loses the use of its leg, which drags, with the toesdoubled in; it hops upon the other. apart from this, the patient doesnot seem to trouble much about his hurt; his appetite is good. Mydaughters feed him on Flies, bread-crumb, apricot-pulp. He is sure toget well, he will recover his strength; the poor victim of the curiosityof science will be restored to liberty. This is the wish, the intentionof us all. Twelve hours later, the hope of a cure increases; theinvalid takes nourishment readily; he clamours for it, if we keep himwaiting. But the leg still drags. I set this down to a temporaryparalysis which will soon disappear. Two days after, he refusedhis food. Wrapping himself in his stoicism and rumpled feathers, theSparrow hunches into a ball, now motionless, now twitching, My girlstake him in the hollow of their hand and warm him with their breath.The spasms become more frequent. A gasp proclaims that all is over. Thebird is dead. There was a certain coolness among us at the evening-meal. I read mutereproaches, because of my experiments, in the eyes of my home-circle; Iread an unspoken accusation of cruelty all around me. The death of theunfortunate Sparrow had saddened the whole family. I myself was notwithout some remorse of conscience: the poor results achieved seemed toodearly bought.
