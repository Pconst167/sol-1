Lawyers: one is prime, three is prime, five is prime, seven is prime,
         although there appears to be prima facie evidence that nine
         is not prime, there exists substantial precedent to indicate
         that nine should be considered prime.  The following brief
         presents the case for nine's primeness ...

Liberals: The fact that nine is not prime indicates a deprived
          cultural environment which can only be remedied by
          a federally funded cultural enrichment program.

Computer programmers: one is prime, three is prime, five is prime,
                      five is prime, five is prime, five is prime
                      five is prime, five is prime, five is prime ....

Bush: What's nine got against being prime?  I'll bet it won't allow
      the pledge of allegiance to be said in our schools either.
                 
Richard Nixon: Put nine on the enemies list.  I'm gonna get that number.

Rec.humor poster: one is prime, one is prime, one is prime, one is prime

Professor: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, and the rest are left as
	an exercise for the student.

Computational linguist: 3 is an odd prime, 5 is an odd prime, 7 is an
	odd prime, 9 is a very odd prime, ...

Computer Scientist: 10 prime, 11 prime, 101 prime...

Chemist: 1 prime, 3 prime, 5 prime...hey, let's publish!

Measure nontheorist: there are exactly as many odd numbers as primes
	(Euclid, Cantor), and exactly one even prime (namely 2), so
	there must be exactly one odd nonprime (namely 1).

New Yorker: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is ... NONE OF YOUR
	DAMN BUSINESS!

Programmer: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 will be fixed in the
	next release, ...

C programmer: 03 is prime, 05 is prime, 07 is prime, 09 is really 011
	which everyone knows is prime, ...

BASIC programmer: What's a prime?

COBOL programmer: What's an odd number?
