-- Disclaimer.
 
        This file is intended to be read for entertainment purposes only.
No offense is intended towards anyone that happens to fall under the catagory
of "squid", as dictated by this file; neither is offense intended from those
quoted by said file. On with the show...
 
-- Introduction.
 
        Recently, there has been a large group of people calling one another
"squids". Mind you, this isn't a local problem; Squid-hood has spread across
the entire country. Since "squid" has become the hip & happening word to call
somebody you don't like, we take the time to present this file to help dist-
inguish a squid from whatever other riff-raff you have them confused with.
 
-- Definition of a Squid.
 
        "Squid (skwid) n. A marine mollusk with a long body and ten arms 
surrounding the mouth. [Origin unknown]". Picture included in the dictionary
was just what you expected: An ugly, elongated little sea-creature. If the 
folks who pubished the dictionary knew what they were talking about, the
illustration would most likely show a disheveled looking teenager, slumped over
a computer, frantically typing on a BBS. You might be thinking "Hmm, so a
squid is just a fancy name for a 'Modem Geek'.."; That's only half of the
story.
 
-- What's the Other Half of the Story?
 
        Squids are generally known as modem geeks, but there are exceptions.
No ordinary modem geek has what it takes to be a true squid, In person,
he may not be considered as pitiful as the average, run of the mill nerd
(sometimes, the two parallel rather closely, nevertheless..). It takes
a combination of odd personality and a lot of free time to merit the much
coveted title of "squid".
 
-- How Many Squids Really Exist?
 
        Squid-hood in it's TRUE form is very rare, so there is no need to
fear an epidemic. They rarely run their own boards, so new users won't be
tempted to mimic their "FAV0RITE SYS0P" on that "K-K00L B0ARD!1" that the squid
might otherwise run. If a squid does happen to influence a new user, another
true squid might be born. One might compare this phenomenon to that of a virus
contaminating whatever was healthy before, thereby turning it into mush which
breeds more viruses. So much for cute analogies.
 
        If you want to find %`½quid, the best places to look are on just about
any Apple-Net boards in your local area. Since John Pechacek was probably a
true squid during his pirating days (under the handle "Apple Bandit"), it
only seems natural that squids like such BBS's.
 
-- Some Helpful Hints on Squid Identification.
 
        The guidelines that the typical squid follows in his/her/it's day to
day life has been outlined in a "Real ---- guide" format. I know, the "real so
and so Guide" business is getting old, but it seems like the best way to 
classify all this information. Here we go...
 
Real squids ALWAYS have elite access on ANY and EVERY Apple-Net BBS
within a 30 milre radius of their modem.
 
Corollary: Real squids NEVER have elite access on any other type of
bulletin board.
 
Real squids have love/hate feelings about John Pechacek. They love him because
they think he is a God-like programmer, they hate him because he always seems
to crash their favorite board until the sysop send him $55 to pay for a
legitimate copy of Apple-Net.
 
Real squids, if they happen to have a 1200 baud modem, spit on anything below
1200 baud. They NEVER call boards that are 300 baud only, because it's "too
slow".
 
Corollary: Real squids try to take speed reading courses, to keep up with the
1200 baud display.
 
Real squids NEVER run their own BBS.
 
Corollary: Real squids would rather go to a sysop's house and bother users
from the local end.
 
Real squids don't attempt to defend themselves when being called a squid. They
believe that being called a "squid" is a supreme honor.
 
Real squids THINK they have a sense of humor. They often create fictional char-
acters (don't ask me why, it just sounds like a squidly thing to do..right?)
 
Corollary: Nobody really cares when a squid says "Franklin Macintoshman lives!"
or "Joe Bob's Grease-o-Matic Burger Joint! Call and order.."
 
Real squids like to wear t-shirts that have sayings about "Cthulhu" emblazoned
upon them.
 
Real squids NEVER buy records or tapes, the only music they listen to is on
AM radio.
 
Corollary: Real squids listen to KFRC.
 
Read squids are out of high-school, but don't attend college because it would
not leave them with enough time to call the 99E99 boards they are on at one
time.
 
Real squids don't have jobs.
 
Real squids take great pride in their "intelligence".
 
Real squids play chess, D&D, and various other role playing and war games,
ONLY if they can be adapted for BBS play. Squids are attracted to BBS's that
have more than 10 sub-boards dedicated to gaming.
 
Real squids, when feeling like getting into a real bitch-war, call other users
names that are normally linked to fruits and vegetables (ie: Grapefruit, Cuc-
umber, etc).
 
Real squids, if they attempt to write text-files (VERY rarely), write files
that are takeoff's on other text-files (they usually write takeoff's on a 
takeoff that offended them).
 
Corollary: It's a good thing that real squids don't write many more text-files
than they do right now. (Need I say more?)
 
-- Conclusion.
 
        Squids are (unfortunately) here to stay. About all you can do is
identify them, and eradicate them if possible. The original squids have
"contaminated" enough users (thus transforming them into real squids them-
selves) that it is literally impossible to correct their problems. 
 
        This file is dedicated to the "Nwonknu" series of BBS's. If it
weren't for Ken, there would be no sanctuary for lonely squids everywhere.
