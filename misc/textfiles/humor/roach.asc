        The next  time  you  are about to step on that roach scampering
   across the floor, think twice.

        If it looks big, really big,  it  could  win  you a trip to New
   York City or even $1,000. Unfortunately, it's disqualified  if  it's
   plastered to the bottom of your shoe.

        The makers  of  COMBAT Roach Control System this week announced
   the kickoff of their annual search  for the biggest cockroach on the
   world.

        To qualify, entries are "Wanted Dead, Not Alive"  but cannot be
   squashed or altered. Entry deadline is Sept. 30.

        Last year's search drew more then 2,000 entries. Entries should
   be carefully packaged  in  a  box  and  sent,  along with your name,
   address and phone number, to: COMBAT  Quest  for the World's Largest
   Roach, The Pest Shop Inc., 2231-B West 15th St. 75075.
