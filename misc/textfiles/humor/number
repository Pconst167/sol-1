บ                       It's All In The Numbers                           บ
บ                          By:  Lou C Fer                                 บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        Goodevening. I'm glad to see you found your way back to          บ
บ   my humble home. Please do come in...before we start our               บ
บ   conversation for the evening I'd like to send a special hello         บ
บ   to my good friend Inez. You see Inez was concerned about her          บ
บ   new phone number, her new exchange..seems she has the 666             บ
บ   exchange. <EG> Inez...you should'nt be surprised, after all,          บ
บ   once you start doing business with me...well....you have to           บ
บ   expect these things... <EG>.                                          บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        Numbers have played an important part in culture for a           บ
บ   long, long time. From the far east to the far west. Numbers           บ
บ   have held sacred & mystic meanings. Look at the number 3,             บ
บ   among the Greeks, the dead and gods were invoked three times.         บ
บ   Nine, which is a multiple of 3 was also considered a mystic           บ
บ   number. The number 5 was also a significant number. 5 fingers         บ
บ   on the hand; in China there are the 5 cannons of the                  บ
บ   Confucian classics.                                                   บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        3 is also always poping up in Chinese culture. In                บ
บ   chinese art, the three friends of winter are the pine, bamboo         บ
บ   and plum. They were the only plants that would display their          บ
บ   colors against the snow, hence the symbols of consistancy.            บ
บ   The 3 religions in China are Buddhism, Taoism and                     บ
บ   Confucianism. Not to mention the bad luck of 3 on a match.            บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        And who can deny the bad luck of the number 13...as far          บ
บ   back as the biblical times. It seems that a fellow was the            บ
บ   13th at a dinner...now what was his name...seems to have              บ
บ   slipped my mind....                                                   บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        Numbers are everywhere, it seems we can't get away from          บ
บ   them. Infact we take them for granted. Try getting up in the          บ
บ   morning without that annoying alarm blasting its time in your         บ
บ   ear. Try to go through the day without looking at a clock or          บ
บ   watch, Easy? Maybe. But then don't go to a store and buy              บ
บ   something..or ride a bus or train. Don't even use the tv or           บ
บ   radio..and for heaven's sake (Did I say that?!?!?!??<EG>)             บ
บ   don't use the phone!                                                  บ
บ                                                                         บ
บ        And as for the significance of the number 666...well, we         บ
บ   will leave that for another night....ok Inez?? <EG>                   บ
บ   GoodNight..and...pleasant dreams.                                     บ
