The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He's met by the reception
committee, and after a whirlwind tour is told that he can enjoy any of
the myriad recreations available.  He decides that he wants to read all
of the ancient original text of the Holy scriptures, and
spends the next eon or so learning the languages.

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and
begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from the
most recent "Easy reading" to the original script.  All of a sudden,
there is a scream in the library. The angels come running to him, only
to find the Pope  huddled in a chair, crying to himself, and muttering,
 "An 'R'! They left out the 'R'."

God takes him aside, offering comfort and asks him what the problem is.
 
After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, "It's the letter 'R'...
the word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!"
