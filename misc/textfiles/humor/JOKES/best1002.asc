       Our friend, Ed,  the  Texas A&M Aggie, got up one morning real early
       to go ice-fishing.  He gathered up his tackle, hammer and chisel and
       headed to a new lake he'd heard about.

       Arriving at dawn he gently walked  out  on  the ice set up his stool
       and got his tackle out.  Then he picked up his hammer and chisel
       and began chopping a hole in the ice to fish through...

       Suddenly a booming voice from above said, "Don't cut  a  hole in the
       ice.  There are no fish below the ice."

       Well, Ed, shook his head and looked around but didn't see anything.
       Figgered it was  his mind playing tricks on him.  So he continued to
       hack away at the ice.  Moments later  the voice boomed again,"You're
       wasting your time!  There are no fish below!"

       Ed was sure he heard the voice that time.  Touched with a feeling of
       the supernatural he stood up with his arms outstretched to heaven.

       "Lord, is that you talking to me?!?!"

       After a brief pause the voice replied, " NO, this  is  the  owner of
       the skating rink!
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       I finally tried  that  Preparation H they're always talking about on
       TV.  It tasted terrible, gave me bad  breath,  stained my teeth, and
       ruined my toothbrush.

       So all you people recommending it, as far as I'm concerned, you can
       just stick it up your ASS!

       A father of 3 teen-aged daughters answered the doorbell, and a young
       man was standing there.  "Yes?" said the father.

       The young man  said,  "Hi,  my  name  is Eddie, I've come to pick up
       Betty; we're going out for spaghetti,  is  she ready?"  "Sure," said
       the proud pop.

       A few minutes  later, father answered the door a second  time.   The
       young man, standing there with a box of candy, said, "Hi, my name is
       Joe, I've come to pick up Flo, we're going to the show, is she ready
       to go?" "Sure," said Pop.

       Settling back in the easy chair, the doorbell rang a third time.  On
       answering the door, the young man standing there began, "Hi, my name
       is Chuck..." "Get the hell outta here!" pop yelled.

       Our old friend Ed (the Texas Aggie)  and  his life-long buddy, Earl,
       went huntin' one day.  They was walkin' through the  woods when Earl
       decided to relieve  himself  behind  a  bush...   Well, he no sooner
       dropped his overalls when a 6 foot  rattlesnake popped outa no place
       and bit him square on his privates.

       Earl dropped to  the  ground in pain holding himself!   Old  square-
       shootin' Ed ran over to the bush and blew the snake away.

       Quickly assessin' the situation and the location of Earl's injury he
       was in doubt as to what the proper course of action was.  "Earl, you
       been bit on  a bad spot and I ain't quite sure as to what to do!" he
       said.

       "I'm in awful pain, Ed, you gotta  do  something quick!" cried Earl.
       "Run down the  hill to that veterinarian and see if  he  won't  come
       help me."
                                      Page 2





       Ed, took off  runnin' feelin' that everythin' was gonna be okay if'n
       he could get that old Aggie vet to  come help his buddy.  As he came
       up ta the clinic the old vet was hoppin' in his pickup truck.

       "Doc, Doc, ya gotta help my buddy he's been bit by a rattler!"

       "Well, son, I  wish  I  could help ya but I gotta run  over  ta  the
       Schultz farm and  deliver  a  calf but let me tell you what ya gotta
       do," said the vet.

       "First, you grab the bit part in  both  hands  and  make  two  small
       shallow X's on the fang marks.  Then you put your mouth  on  the X's
       and suck the venom out of the wound."

       Ed thought for a moment then asked, "Doc, what happens if I don't do
       that?"

       The doc yelled out the window as he drove off, " Then he'll die!"

       Ed hurried off  back  to  Earl.   Earl,  still  in  mortal agony was
       relieved to see  him.   Holding  his  purple,  swollen  privates  he
       pleaded, "Ed, what'd the Doc say?"

       Ed looked at him mournfully.  "Doc says you gonna die."

       An Eskimo came  out of the Arctic and walked into  a  bar  in  Nome,
       Alaska.  He was dressed in traditional Eskimo garb but the bartender
       noticed that this one particular Eskimo was carrying a shotgun and a
       bucket of crap in one hand and a pretty fluffy cat in the other arm.

       The Eskimo asked the bartender for a drink and he served him.  After
       he finished the drink, the Eskimo took his shotgun and fired it into
       the bucket and  then threw the cat on the floor and chased it out of
       the bar.

       Then he asked  the  bartender  for  another  drink.   The  bartender
       hesisantly complied but sure enough the Eskimo went through the same
       routine!  Again the Indian asked for another drink  and  again after
       he finished his drink he took his shotgun and fired a round into the
       bucket and dropped  the  cat  on  the floor and chased it out of the
       bar.

       When he asked for another drink the  bartender  finally asked, "Just
       what the hell you think you're doing?"

       "Huh?" asked the Eskimo.  "Just trying to be like White Man!"

       "What do you  mean 'trying to be like a White Man'?"  the  bartender
       queried.

       "I drink whiskey,  shoot the shit, and chase pussy...just like White
       Man!"

       This "world-famous authority  on the  paranormal  and  supernatural"
       gave a lecture at Texas A&M and was impressed by the  fact  that the
       lecture hall was  filled  with  Aggies  eagerly listening and taking
       copious notes.

       At the conclusion of the lecture he announced a question and answer

                                      Page 3





       period.  "Gentleman, my  question  and  answer  periods are two-way.
       I'd like for you to ask me questions  but  first I'd like to ask the
       audience a few things," he mentioned.

       "Alright, how many have ya'll have ever SEEN a ghost?"

       Well, everyone in the lecture hall raised their hands!

       "How many of you have ever conversed with a ghost?"

       About 1/2 the group raised their hands.

       Very much impressed, he asked, "How many of you have  ever touched a
       ghost?"

       Again, EVERYONE raised their hands.

       "How many of you have ever had SEXUAL RELATIONS with a ghost? "

       One solitary hand  was  raised.   The professor was ecstatic.  "Come
       straight down to the podium, young  man!"  he  commanded, "This is a
       VERY RARE incident!   Please, tell us all about your  experience  of
       having sex with a ghost!"

       The Aggie laughs and turns red-in-the-face.

       "Ghost?  We thought you was saying GOATS!"

       The mayor of  New York offered a million dollars to anyone who could
       rid the city of pigeons.  After two  weeks,  a  man called city hall
       and agreed to do it, and the mayor met him on the brooklyn bridge at
       noon the following day.

       The man arrived  with  nothing but a pink pigeon, and  at  precisely
       noon, let the  bird  fly free.  Within minutes all of the pigeons in
       New York city were following the bird.   Then  the man whistled, and
       the pink pigeon flew back, and dove into the water drowning itself.

       To the mayor's  amazement,  the  rest of the pigeons  followed,  and
       drowned in the  river.   The  mayor  was so pleased that he not only
       paid the man $1 million, but also gave him a two hundred thousand
       dollar bonus.  After paying the man,  the  mayor  asked,  "you don't
       have any pink puerto ricans, do you?"

       A blind man is standing on the corner  waiting  for the street light
       to change so  he can cross the street.  He is holding  his  familiar
       red and white  cane  and in the other arm is a bag of groceries that
       he has just purchased.

       As he is waiting, a stray dog comes  up  to  him,  lifts its leg and
       pisses all down the blind man's leg, into his pants  cuff,  and  all
       over his sock and into his shoe.

       By way of  response,  the  blind  man  merely  removes a cookie from
       within his bag of groceries, bends  over slightly with the cookie in
       his outstreched hand and says, "Good doggie...good  doggie,  get the
       cookie, good doggie, attaboy."

       A woman who  was  standing  nearby,  and  who  witnessed  the entire
       incident says to the blind man, "I  can't  beleive  you're  going to
       reward that dog after what he just did."

       "No," replied the  blind  man, "I'm just trying to  find  the  dog's
       head, so I can kick him in the ass!"

       down and got another...

       Finally, the guy  walks  over and says "Thats mighty good natured of
       you, but ain't that a terrible waste of time?

       Little Johnnie was constantly telling  stories  &  exaggerating.  In
       desperation, his parents  decided  they'd  try sending  him  off  to
       sunday school.  After the class, they asked him what he'd learned.

       "Well, I heard about this guy named Moses & his people, and how this
       army chased them with tanks & guns", he told them.  "The army chased
       Moses back up  against  the  Red Sea. Then right at the last moment,
       they found some canoes and escaped.".

       Disgusted, his father said "Now that's not what they told you, is it
       Johnnie?"

       Johnnie said "No, but I figured  you'd  believe  that  before  you'd
       believe what they told me!".

       While sports fishing  off  the Florida coast, a tourist capsized his
       boat. He could swim, but his fear of alligators kept him clinging to
       the overturned craft.

       Spotting an old beachcomber standing on the shore, the tourist
       shouted,"Are there any gators around here?!"

       "Naw," the man hollered back, "they ain't been around for years!"

       "Feeling safe, the tourist started  swimming  leisurely  toward  the
       shore. About halfway there he asked the guy,"How'd  you  get  rid of
       the gators?"

       "We didn't do nothin'," the beachcomber said.  "The sharks got 'em."

            About your  father  .  . . he has a lovely new job.  He has 500
       men under him.  He is cutting grass at the cemetery.

            There was a washing machine in  the new house when we moved in,
       but it isn't working too good.  Last week I put 14  shirts  into it,
       pulled the chain, and I haven't seen the shirts since.

            Your sister  Mary had a baby this morning.  I haven't found out
       whether it is a boy or girl, so I don't know whether you are an aunt
       or uncle.

            Your uncle Dick drowned last week in a vat of whiskey in Dublin
       Brewery.  Some of his workmates dived  in to save him, but he fought
       them off bravely.  We cremated his body, and it took  three  days to
       put out the fire.

            Your father  didn't  have  much to drink at Christmas.  I put a
       bottle of castor oil in his pint of  beer.   It kept him going until
       New Years Day. I went to the doctor on Thrusday and your father came
       with me.  The doctor put a small tube into my mouth  and told me not
       to open it for ten minutes.  Your father offered to buy it from him.

            It only rained twice last week.  First for three days, and then
       for four days.  Monday it was so windy that one of our chickens laid
       the same egg four times.

            We had  a letter yesterday from the undertaker.  He said if the
       last installment wasn't paid on your  grandmother  within 7 days, up
       she comes.

                                           Your loving mother,

       P.S.  I was  going to send you $10.00 but I had already  sealed  the
             envelope.

       A Jewish boy asks his father for $15.

       $10!"  His dad exclaims.

       "What do you need $5 for?"

       These 2 tribes  had been fighting on and on for years and the losing
       tribes's leader at the end of the  war  would have to submit himself
       to the winning side and be killed.

       Well, after one particularly bloody battle, the losing  sides leader
       went to the  winners  and  when  he  arrived they told him they were
       changing the rules around.

       Okay, they said, this is what you  have  to do.  They told him first
       he had to  swim across an alligator infested lake.   After  that  go
       into a certain  cave  where there lay a lion with an abcessed tooth,
       and pull that tooth.  After that  go  to  the  top  of a huge castle
       where there was a virgin girl and fix that.

       After luckily swimming across that lake where half  of  his  clothes
       were torn to  shreads,  he jetted into the cave and after an hour of
       roars, screams, hair flying out of  the cave, the man walked out and
       said, "Ok, now where is that girl with the abcessed tooth?"

       There was this  guy  who  got a job selling toothbrushes.  He set up
       his booth on  a  street corner,  and  the  first  week  he  sold  10
       toothbrushes.

       The boss told him, "Look.  10 is pretty good, but  if  you  want  to
       keep your job,  you  had  better  do  better than that."  He said he
       would try, and left.

       The next week, the boss asked him  how  many  he  had  sold,  and he
       replied, "100."  "100!?!"  exclaimed  the  boss.  "How  did  you  do
       that?"

       "Well, it was simple," he replied.  "I just set up a booth with some
       nacho chips and  a  big bowl of dip and a sign that said 'free chips
       and dip'.  People would walk up, get a chip and dip, and eat it.

       They would say 'This dip tastes like shit!'  and I would say 'It is!
       Wanna buy a toothbrush?'"

       Barbara Walters was  doing  a documentary  on  the  customs  of  the
       American Indians.  After a tour of the reservation  they  lived  on,
       she asked why there was a difference in the number of feathers found
       in the headdresses of the various Indians.

       She asked a  brave  who  only  had one feather in his headdress what
       this meant. His reply was "Me have  only one squaw, me have only one
       feather."

       She asked another brave, feeling the first fellow was  only  joking,
       this brave had four feathers in his headdress.. He replied, "Ugh, me
       have four feathers because me sleep with four squaws"

       Still not convinced  the  number of feathers indicated the number of
       squaws involved, she decided to interview the chief.

       Now the cheif had a headdress full  of  feathers  which, needless to
       say, amused Ms. Walters.  She asked the chief, "Why  do  you have so
       many feathers in your headdress?"

       The Chief proudly  beat  his  chest  and said, "Me chief, me fuck-em
       all; big, small, fat, tall, me fuck-em all."  Horrified, Ms. Walters
       stated, " You should be hung."  The cheif replied, "You damned right
       me hung--me hung like buffalo."

       Ms. Walters cried, "You don't have  to  be  so goddamn hostile." The
       chief replied, "Hoss style, dog-style, any style, me fuck-em all."

       Tears in her eyes, Ms. Walters cried, "Oh dear."  The cheif replied,
       "No deer,----me fuck no deer.  Run too fast, assholes  too high.  No
       fuck deer."

       A priest went  golfing  with  a  nun as his caddie. He is on the 3rd
       hole and he's  4  inches  from   the   hole,   but   he  missed.  He
       mumbles,"F*cking sh*t I missed!"

       The nun gasps and says,"Watch your language!!"

       The priest goes to the 4th hole, he's 3 inches, but he missed! He
       said,"F*cking sh*t I missed!!"

                                      Page 9





       The nun gasps  and  says,"  The  Lord  will  get  you  if you aren't
       careful!!"

       The priest goes to the 5th hole and  is  2 inches from the hole, but
       misses!!

       He screams," F*CKING SH*T I MISSED!!"

       Then a big  bolt of lightning comes down and hit's  the  priest  and
       kills him.

       Then a big  voice  comes  from  Heaven  that  says,"Fucking  shit  I
       missed!!!"
