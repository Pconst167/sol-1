     Once upon a time there was a cruise ship sailing.  On board, a
magician was giving a show to some passengers.  The magician ALWAYS had
a parrot on his shoulder.  Whenever the magician told a joke, the parrot
would give it away.  One time the magician had a knife, he spun it
around it dissappeared!  The parrot said "It's in his pocket, it's in
his pocket".  The crowd booed him because the parrot gave it away.  The
next trick he did, he waved a wand around and it vanished.  Again, the
parrot said, "It's up his sleeve!  It's up his sleeve!"  The magician
got mad because he couldn't keep any of his tricks secret.  The parrot
kept giving them away.
   One day the cruise ship sank.  The magician and the parrot managed to
make it to an island where they stayed for about 3 months when the
parrot, all of a sudden, burst out and asked:
            "Ok, I give up!  Where'd you hide the ship?"

     One day some scientists heard about a remote Island
     where there were Porpoises that lived forever!! So off they
     went to check it out.Upon arriving at the Island they
     discovered that there was also a huge colony of Mina Birds
     present.And,after further research,they found that the mina
     birds were the porpoise's main diet! Reasoning that somehow
     this was the reason for the porpoises immortality,they
     decided to capure some of the mina birds for further study.
     Enter the dilemma!--a huge and ferocous lion! Whenever the
     sci entists came close to capturing a mina bird,the lion
     would appear and ruin everything! So the scientists made a
     plan!They dug a deep pit,put some meat laced with a powerful
     sedative into it,covered the pit's opening with leaves and
     grass;and waited. Soon the lion came round,smelled the
     meat,fell into the pit,ate the meat,and fell fast asleep!!
     The scientists grabbed as many mina birds as they could
     carry,raced across the pit,and were promptly arrested!Why?
     Transporting minas across sedated lions for immortal
     porpoises!!!

There was a professor in the Chemistry Dept. that I did graduate work
in who was noted for the difficulty of the tests he gave. His first
name was Percy.  On the morning of a test he walked into the lecture
hall to find the class very quiet and very diligently studying their
notes for that last fact for the test.  It wasn't until he had walked
up the aisle to pass out the tests and turned around that he saw the
message emblazoned on the blackboard in big chalk letters :
                     MERCY PERCY !
To which he replied :
                     Alas Class !

 The leper leaves and the hooker is standing in the open door way and a
door across the hall opens and a john walks out and another hooker looks
at the first hooker and says Hi, how's going?" the first hooker replies:

A good friend of mine, living in northern Michigan, decided to go ice
fishing.  He gathered up all of his tackle and moved out on the ice.
He started to auger a hole in the ice when he heard a voice boom out
from above:
                       'There are no fish here!'
 He thought for a few moments, gathered up his stuff, then moved a
little farther down the ice.  He started to auger a new hole in the
ice when he heard the voice boom out from above:
                      'There are no fish here!!'
 So, he gathered up his stuff again, moved a little farther down the
ice, then started to augher another hole in the ice.  Again he heard
the voice boom out from above:
                  'I said, there are no fish here!!!'
 He sheepishly asked:      'Is that you god?'
 To which the booming voice replied:
                      'No, I'm the rink manager'

No matter where you go, ... there you are

My wife and I were sitting out on our back porch, enjoying a glass
of lemonade after a long hard day.  A bird flew over and, with
perfect aim left a deposit squarely in the middle of my wife's head.
She reached up, felt the damage, and shouted:
                   'Quick, get some toilet paper'
   'It wouldn't do any good',  I quipped,  'He's miles away by now.'

The three wise men were riding their camels through the desert to
Bethlehem.  Finally they arrived at the manger containing Joseph,
Mary, and their newborn son.
  The first wise man, a very short fellow, climbed off his camel and
ran inside the manger.  After a few minutes he came running outside
and shouted:
               'I have seen him, the son of our lord!'
The second wise man, also a very short fellow, climbed off his camel
and ran inside the manger.  Soon he also came running outside
shouting:
             'I have seen the babe, our savior is born!'
The third wise man, a very tall towering figure of a man, climbed
off his camel and ran inside the manger: 'BOOOM', he hit his head on
a rafter and shouted  'Jesus Christ'.
  Mary looked up and said,
            'Hey, ... that sounds a lot better than Claude.'

I bought my GF a new seat for her bike, one of those wide versions
that fits a lady's pelvis a bit better than the OEM man's style. I
put it on for her while she was in class, just before we were to go
riding with a friend of ours. She came out to get her bike, and
didn't at first realise the seat had been changed, but then the
odor of new leather came to her, and she realized what I had done.
We rode to Barry's house, picked him up and started riding down the
valley route. She was a bit proud of the seat, so she told Barry I
had gotten it, and that she hadn't caught on til she smelled the
difference.  And Barry quipped:
   "You mean you smell bicycle seats??"

King Arthur was about to go fight in the crusades.  He felt sceptical
about leaving his wife (a beautiful young woman) with his 100 servants.
He decides to put a chastity belt on his wife so that if a man tried to
screw her, he'd get his dick chopped off.  When he came back from the
crusades he had all of his servants line up in a row and drop their
pants.  All of them had their dicks chopped off except one man.  "Son,"
King Arthur said, "Thank you for living up to the trust I have put on
thee.  I will grant you anything you want!"  The servent replied in a
very undistinguishable tone, "I wrruqbrg gwergnewrgh"!

the guy out hunting ducks. He shot one and it fell in a
farmer's yard. When he went in to get it, the farmer came out and
they got into an argument about who owned the duck. Farmer said
it was his as it was on his property. The hunter said his as he'd
shot it.
After a few minutes, the farmer said, "We'll settle this country
style, We kick each other in the crotch in turn and the last guy
standing gets the duck." The hunter wasn't too keen on this, but
agreed. Farmer said he got the first kick as it was his property.
He laid in a good one and the hunter spent the next ten minutes
rolling around on the ground in agony. Finally, he recovered
enough to take his turn. "Ready?" he asked. The farmer said, "Ah,
hell take the damned duck!"

Jim Finn, the noted biologist, was stumped.  He'd spent
months studying the little green frogs in the Keefo swamp.
The population, despite all efforts at predator control, was
declining at an alarming rate.  Finally Finn went to the
chemistry department at his college, to see if anyone there
might be able to help.  Tom Trom looked into the problem,
and came up with a solution.  The little frogs had succumbed
to a chemical change in the swamp's water, and simply
couldn't stay coupled long enough to reproduce.  Trom
brewed up a new adhesive, made from a dash of this, a zoss
of that, and, most critically, one part of sodium.  "You
mean?..." Jim said when told.  "Yes," said Tom.  "They
needed mono-sodium glue to mate."

While hiking in the woods, Nate and Sam found this huge rock
which had an old iron lever attached to it. Etched into the
rock was the following inscription: "If this lever is
pulled, the world will come to an end!" Nate wanted to pull
the lever and see what would happen, but Sam, being a
paranoid pessamist, greatly feared this! He said to Nate
that if he tried to pull the lever, he'd shoot him! In a
daring attempt, Nate lunged for the lever, and sure enough,
Sam shot him! What is the moral of this story? Better Nate
than lever!

 King John and King Paul had been at war for years, and King
 Paul was getting tired of it. He decided to make peace
 between himself and King John. So he sent his eldest son,
 his most trusted Prince, to see King John and arrange the
 peace. Well, the Prince travelled for days and finally
 arrived at King John's castle. It was a huge stone
 fortress, surrounded by a deep moat which was filled with
 tiny Piranha-like fish called Yellow Fingers. These Yellow
 Fingers could strip a cow to the bones in minutes! So the
 Prince yelled up to the guards, "Lower your drawbridge! I
 come from King Paul to arrange the peace." They did lower
 the drawbridge, but just as the prince put one foot on it,
 they yanked the drawbridge back up again, causing the
 prince to flip into the moat, where he was eaten by the
 Yellow Fingers.      When King Paul heard this he was very
 upset, but he was still determined to make the peace. So he
 sent his most trusted Barons as his emissaries. One by one
 they were tricked into falling in the moat. King Paul sent
 his Dukes. They too were eaten by the fish. Finally no one
 was left n the castle but a little page boy. "Page," said
 King Paul wearily, you are my last hope. You must make the
 peace between King John and me. lad, and good luck." The
 page went to the drawbridge "I come from King Paul to
 arrange the peace!" As they had done many times before,
 King John's men lowered the bridge, then yanked it back up
 just as the victim put a foot on it.         But a strange
 thing happened. The page, instead being eaten, walked right
 along the bottom of the moat, climbed onto  drawbridge, and
 entered the castle. King John was so impressed by this that
 he made peace! What is the moral?     Let your pages do the
 walking through the yellow fingers.

the story about the two Polacks who went hunting
together, They bagged a moose and, being big strapping fellows,
tucked a hind leg each under an arm and began dragging the
moose back to their vehicle. Another hunter came along and
suggested that dragging the moose by the hind legs created a lot
of extra friction with the hair digging into the ground. He
suggested they'd be better off dragging it by the front legs and
the hair would then slip over the ground more easily. They took
his advice and a few minutes later, one said to the other, "Dat
guy know what he was talkin' about, Dis is a lot easier." The
other agreed and said, "Only thing woriies me is, we're getting a
hell of a long way from the truck!"

Or....  the Travelling Salesman was weekending in a small town
whose single industry was the manufacture of coin operated
machines. It was very quiet on Saturday night so he asked the
desk clerk if there was anything going on in town. "No," replied
the clerk, "but the factory has a demo room that's open all the
time. They have some new machines there and you can try them
out." The T/S went to the factopry and found a number of
interesting machines in operation. One large one had a small
hole in the front of it and was labled, "YOUR WIFE AWAY FROM
HOME". He thought this an excellent idea, so opened his fly,
stuck his member into the hole and inserted a dollar bill. There
was immdeiate and noisy operating inside the machine and when he
withdrew his member, there was a button sewn on the end of it!

There was this guy who picked up this chick at a dance.
After they danced, the guy said
"I'd take you to my house, but my parents are home."
The woman replied
"I'd let you go to my house, except my BOYFRIEND is there!"
The dude suggested that they go to his van instead.
The chick agreed and they went to the van; they both
took off their clothes, and at the point where the man
was about to enter her, the woman exclaimed
"What, no foreplay?! How about going outside and look for
a stick, and you could beat me with it!"
So the man went outside, but couldn't find any sticks. So instead
he busted the aerial off his van, and the guy and girl beat
each other on the back and they had a gay old time. The next
morning, however, the man was feeling aweful sore on the back.
He went to his doctor, who exclaimed:
"This is the worst case of Van-Aerial disease I've ever seen!"

2. The current (2 more years max!) Prime Minister is Brian Mulroney.
3. Mulroney just had a little cabinet shuffle.


After the recent shuffle, Brian decided to take his cabinet for lunch.

     onto the ice and started to drill a hole. Suddenly, a deep,
     resonant voice from above him said, "There are no fish there".
     Leonard shrugged, picked up his equipment, moved another 50 feet
     out onto the ice and began to drill. Again, a big voice boomed,
     "There are no fish there". Leonard looked up and asked, "Are you

A man went into a pet store and said to the owner, I'd like
to buy a pet that is out of the ordinary -unusual. The pet
shop owner replied, well,I have one Rairy-bird left... The
man said, I've never even heard of a Rairy-bird, that
certainly makes it unusual!, I'll take it! So the man
brought home his new Rairy-bird and soon found out that it
had a huge appetite! It was always hungry!!  Finally,the
Rairy-bird was so big and fat that it wouldn't fit inside
the house anymore, much less the cage! The man said to
himself:I've got to get rid of this animal-I can't afford to
feed it! So he rented a huge dump truck, put the Rairy-bird
into the back ,and drove to the edge of a high cliff. He
then dumped the Rairy-bird out of the truck and over the
cliff!! Thinking that all his troubles were over, the man
was driving home when he suddenly heard this singing coming
from the back of the dump- truck: I"It's a long long way to

Ma and Pa always made a nice ritual out of dinner - Ma brought
out her freshly baked loaves of home-made bread, and Pa would
carefully carve them into regular, even slices.  Every night,
the family would sit around the table nodding with approval as
Pa displayed his skill with the knife, barely leaving a crumb
as he divided up the loaves.  As the years went by, the kids
would all chip in and buy Pa a new knife every few Christmases.
Each time, they got him a larger, sharper, better knife.  Pa
could put a couple of loaves side-by-side and with one pass of
his knife, create several even slices of Ma's bread.  Finally,
one Christmas, the kids really outdid themselves.  They got Pa
such a fine knife that tears sprang to his eyes as he opened
the package.  Holding it aloft, he reverently exclaimed,
"I never thought that I'd own a four-loaf cleaver!"

Once there was a Russian who had a pen-pal who lived in Africa.
They had written each other letters for about 2 years, when the
African sent a letter to his Russian friend announcing his plans
to come to Russia and visit him. The Russian, who always wanted
to meet his African friend, prepared a tour for his friend.
After meeting him at the airport, the Russian took the African on
a tour of Moscow.  When they approached Red Square, the African
saw a circle of men standing around passing something around, and
asked "What's going on down there?".  The Russian said "That's
our national game of Russian Roulette".  The African asked "How
is it played?"  The Russian said "Well, let's go watch them..."
    They went down and watched as each Russian in turn took a six-
shooter from his neighbor, spun the cylinder, placed the muzzle
to his head, and pulled the trigger.  The African said "What's
the game about?"   The Russian explained "One of the chambers is
loaded.  If you land on the loaded chamber, you are dead."  The
African says "Interesting....  Simple, yet elegant.  I like
it..."
    As the African was about to leave for home, they made plans for
the Russian to visit his African friend in his home village.
    Remeber that neat game you showed me called Russian Roulette?
We have invented our own version, called African Roulette..."  The
Russian asked "How is it different?"  The African says "Well,
let's go watch and I'll show you."

They go to the center of the village and find the following
scene:

In the center of the village, there are 20 naked men walking
around a circle.  Inside the circle, there are 20 naked women.
An old man to the side is beating on a drum.

The Russian says "OK, what's going to happen now?"  The African
replies "See the man with the drum?  When he quits beating it,
each man get's a blowjob from the woman in front of him..."  The
Russian says "Where's the fun of that?!?"  The African replies
slyly "One of the girls is a Cannibal!!!"

    An unemployed stripper begged her agent to
    find her work. He cautioned her that the only job
    available was at a longshoremen's convention--
    typically a rough gig. Because she was broke, she
    took the job anyway.
      That evening, the agent walked into the hall
    just as the stripper began her act. Before long,
    the unruly crowd began pelting her with crushed
    beer cans and cigarette butts while shouting
    obscenities, issuing lewd catcalls and trying to
    manhandle her. Halfway through her performance,
    she ran off stage, sobbing.
      "Look, they don't mean anything by it," the
    agent said consolingly. "They've just had too
    much to drink and----"
      "No, no it's not them!" she exclaimed. "Did you
    hear that f***ing band?"

    Two miserable inhabitants of hell were taking a
    walk when a frigid breeze blew. A moment later, a
    storm dumped several inches of snow, reducing
    the blazing fires to sizzling steam. The men

    Two doctors were putting on the ninth green
    when one collapsed from a heart attack. "Help

      "Sorry, my malpractice insurance won't cover
    it," his partner replied, walking off the green,
    "but I'll get help."
      A few minutes later, he returned, picked up his
    club and began lining up hit putt. The man on
    the ground raised his head and screamed in
    Disbelief, "I'm dying and you're putting?"
      "Don't worry. I found a doctor on the second

     Uncle Bill was finding the money in the movie business rather poor.
Unless you were a big star minimum wage was the best you could expect.
As Bill was having trouble making ends meet he decided to take on a
second job. After some searching he got a job out in the San Joaquin
valley guarding fields of cantalopes and casabas. Bill was issued an
old double barrel shotgun and shells loaded with rock salt. His job was
to protect the fruit from theives who would sneak in during the dark of
night. The first few nights were very difficult. Uncle Bill had a
terrible time staying awake all night, then going to his daytime acting
job. At last Bill came up with a solution. He would get a dog to help
him guard the fields. After much looking Bill found a suitable animal.
It was one of the long haired breed known for its great intelligence.
In memory of one of the dogs more famous relatives Bill named his new
pet Lassie. Guard duties became much easier. Lassie would stand watch
while her master caught a few winks. Unfortunately one dark evening a
stray dog came into the cantalope field. While Bill was sleeping Lassie
took time out for a romantic interlude. In a due span of time Lassie
gave birth to a single cute little puppy. Bill was delighted, he now
had two dogs to help with guard duties. He became very attached to the
little pup, and often refered to it as his "melon collie baby".

  It was the 8th annual mouse convention and mice from near and far
  had gathered for the ball.  A pretty little female mouse waltzed by
  the stag line and one of the males whistled a low, dirty whistle to
  himself.  Turning to another male mouse he said, "Look at the legs
  on that mouse, aren't they sexy?'
    "Just fair," was the answer.
    "You crazy," said the first mouse and then turned to another,
    asked his opinion.
    "They're nice," said the third mouse, "but nothing to get excited
    about."
    "Some mice have no appreciation," exclaimed the first mouse.
    "Now you," he said to the fourth mouse, what do you think of

A young couple got married and after all the festivities the new
groom made one request of his new wife.  He told her he wanted
to designate a drawer in his bureau to be his PRIVATE DOMAIN.
She was to respect his privacy and never venture into this sacred
place of his.  Well she was agreeable to this and went on to live
a long and happy life together.
After about 45 years of this marital bliss the husband became
seriously ill, hospitalized, and not expected to survive long.
The wife sitting at home, waiting to go for a visit, decided
this may be her last opportunity to unlock the secret of his
private door so he opened it up.  Inside she found 3 golf balls
and 5000 dollars in cash.  Later at the hospital she confessed
to her dying husband of her curiosty and asked him to explain the
contents.  Well, he said,  whenever I cheated on you I  put a
golfball in the drawer.  She thought about that fora minute and
figured considering they had 45 happy years, she could forgive
3 indescretions.  She then asked of the 5000 dollars.
Oh that,  he said,  every time I got a dozen balls I sold them.

my garden in my bathrobe and flash them.  You should give that a

doing?  Do they have a nice blush yet?"  "No," answered the woman,
