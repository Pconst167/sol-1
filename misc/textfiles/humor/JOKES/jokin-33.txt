        _Wet_Dream_
        It was April the 41st.  Being a quadruple leap year, I was
        driving in downtown Atlantis.  My Barracuda was in the shop, so
        I was in a rented Stingray and it was overheating.

        So, I pulled into a Shell station.  They said I'd blown a seal.
        I said, "Fix the damn thing and leave my personal life out of
        it, okay pal?"

        While they were doing that I walked over to a place called The
        Oyster Bar.  A real dive.  But I knew the owner (he used to play
        for the Dolphins).  I said, "Hi Gill!"  (you have to yell, he's
	hard of herring).

	chorus:

	    Think I had a wet dream
	    Cruising through the Gulf Stream
	    Oooooh oooooh-ooooh oooooh
	    Wet dream

	Gil was also down on his luck.  Fact is, he was barely keeping
	his head below water.  I bellied up to the sand bar.  He poured
	me the usual -- rusty snail, hold the grunion, shaken, not
	stirred, with a peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich on the
	side, heavy on the mako.

	I slipped him the fin, on porpoise.  I was feeling good.  I even
	slipped a sand dollar in the box for Jerry's squids, for the
	halibut.

	Well, the place was crowded -- we were packed in like sardines.
	They were all there to listen to the big band sounds of Tommy
	Dorsal -- what sole!  Tommy was rockin' the place with a very
	popular tuna -- "Salmon 'Chanted Evening".  And the stage was
	surrounded by screaming groupers, probably there to see the bass
	player.

	One of them was this cute little yellow-tail and she's givin' me
	the eye, so I figure this is my chance for a little fun.  You
	know, a little pisces.

	But she said things I just couldn't fathom; she was too deep.
	Seemed to be under a lot of pressure.  Boy could she drink!  She
	drank like a -- she drank a lot.  I said, "What's your sign?"

	She said, "Aquarian."

	I said, "Great!  Let's get tanked!"

	<chorus>

	I invited her up to my place for a little midnight bait.  I
	said, "Come on baby.  It'll only take a few minnows."  She threw
	me that same old line:  "Not tonight.  I got a haddock."  And
	she wasn't kidding, either, 'cause in came the biggest,
	meanest-looking haddock I'd ever seen come down the pike.  He
	was covered with mussels.  He came over to me and said, "Listen,
	shrimp.  Don't you come trolling around here."  What a crab.
	This guy was steamed.  I could see the anchor in his eyes.

	I turned to him and said, "A-balone.  You're just being
	shellfish."  Well, I knew there was going to be trouble and so
	did Gill 'cause he was already on the phone to the cods.  The
	haddock hits me with a sucker punch.  I catch him with a left
	hook.  He eels over.  It was a fluke, but there he was, lying on
	the deck, flat as a mackerel.  Kelpless.

	I said, "Forget the cods, Gill, this guy's gonna need a
	sturgeon."  Well, the yellow-tail was impressed with the way I
	landed her boyfriend.  She came over to me and said, "Hey big
	boy, you're really a game fish.  What's your name?"

	I said, "Marlin."

	<chorus>

	Well, from then on we had a whale of a time.  I took her out to
	dinner.  I took her to dance.  I bought her a bouquet of
	flounders.  And then I went home with her.  And what did I get
	for my troubles?  A case of the clams.

	<chorus>

This is a true story told by a friend of mine. It happened to a girl she knew.
 There was this girl driving along the highway, when she suddely had to visit
the restroom. Unfortunately there is none along the highway, and she was a
long way from home. Well, after a while she just had to stop, and when she 
saw this big trashbin she desided to stop and do it behind it.
 Aaaaah, what a relief. While she sat there she raised her head and saw
samething on top of the trashbin, it looked like a microwave-oven. "Why would
someone throw away a micowave-oven? My husband is good at fixing such things,
so I'll take it with me".
 Some miles later she raealized a policecar behind, and pulled to the side
thinking: 
	"What is this, I haven't gone too fast". 
The policeman comes over to her and takes a look into her car. 
	"What is this you have in the backseat?"
	"Oh it's a microwave-oven I found in a trashbin along the road."
She told the policeman the story about the oven and that her husband should
fix it.
	"Well mrs. it is no microwave-oven you have in the backseat of your 
car - it is a *radar*"
P.S. I have seen some radars, but no one looks even close to a microwave-oven,
- maybe it is a new brand :)

Three marines, a white man, a black man, and a jewish man, were
sitting in a foxhole (during a war) when  BLAMMO!!!!!  They are
all wasted by enemy fire.  Like all good Marines, they go straight
to hell.  The devil greets them, and says, "Look, I'm in a sporting
mood today.  Tell you what-- for a hundred bucks each, I'll let you
go back and live again."
"A hundred bucks??!!!??  Is that all???" says the white guy, who
whips out the cash and gives it to the devil.  POOOOF!  He is back
in the foxhole.  A medic comes running over.  "I saw the whole thing,"
he says.  "I thought you were dead.  What happened???"
The white guy tells the story of being in hell, and how he got out
for a hundred dollars.  "But where are the other two guys?" asks
the medic.
Says the white-- "Well, the last I heard, the Jew had it down
to $49.50 and the black was still looking for a co-signer."

One day, while walking down a street, a marine general saw a boy shoveling
sh*t into a pile.  
The general asked the boy, "Son, why are you shoveling that Sh*t into a pile?"
The boy responded, "I'm making me an Admiral!"
The general thought this was about the funniest thing he had ever seen so
he went back to the office and told his friend, an admiral, about what he had
it.  The admiral wanted to see this for himself, so the general took the
admiral out to where the boy was.
The admiral asked, "Son, what are you building?"
The boy responded, "I'm building me an admiral."
Stunned, the admiral asked, "Why are you building an admiral?"
"Cause I ain't got enough sh*t to build me a marine!" said the boy.  :)

I had a somewhat similar experience, however I had a vasectomy and had to 
go back 2 months later so they could confirm that the operation was a sccess.
Well, the nurse gave me a glass jar with a lid on it, then proceded to show
me to the door and ask me if I would also like to take one of their handy-
dandy magazines in with me. I told her that I have no need for a magazine
and proceded into the restroom. Well......I guess it was about a half hour
later when the nurse came knocking on the door and asked "Sir, are you having
some kinda problem in there?" I answered "Well kinda, Ya see I shook it up
and down, I beat it against the sink, I slammed it against the wall, I wore
out my right hand, I sprained my left hand, and y'know I'm just about to 
give up on tryin' to get this dad-burned jar open".

A few days ago it was reported that David Letterman was no longer going 
to have the "top ten" list on every show....which begs the question -  
what are the top ten reasons the "top ten" list will not be on every 
David Letterman show? 
Number -
10. Needs air time to introduce his new line of hair-care products. 
 9. He lost the only writer who could count from 10 to 1.
 8. G.E. cancelled his login to NETNEWS - rec.humor. 
 7. Needs a funnier segment to compete with C-SPAN. 
 6. NBC's laugh machine has been overheating.
 5. Paul's drummer gets paid way too much extra for this segment. 
 4. Dave has more important things to do - like smile at the camera - 
    real close.
 3. What next!!!? - no more dumb animal tricks?
 2. Nothing IS sacred to a dork.
and.... the number one reason why David Letterman is not doing the 
        "top ten" list on a regular basis is -
 1. He wants to be more like Jay Leno.

A blonde was walking along, when she looked up
to observe a bird flying overhead.  Suddenly, the
bird drops a load when it was directly over her.
The blonde says, "Good thing I had my mouth
open, or that would've hit me right in the face!!!"

Why are there no blacks in the cartoon the "Flinstones"?
Because they were still monkeys at that time.

After reading too much about flat-panel plasma displays, I received a
divine revelation telling me the purpose of the shimmering curtains of 
light in the Northern skies: It's a planetary terminal (but, luckily, 
not the console).
With the knowledge of the revelation I was able to reinterpret the 
patterns, and saw this:

A guy wakes up one morning, stretches turns to his wife and
says "Wow I slept well, I feel great!"
His wife looks at him and says, "Well I wouldnt go to work
if I were you, you look terrible!, are you sure you feel ok?"
He replies "Yeah I feel fine" then he hops out of bed and 
goes to work.
  While at work, he's whistling, singing and generally enjoying
a wonderful day, and all the time his friends are coming up and
asking if he feels alright cos he looks awful. Eventually his
boss comes in sees him and says, "Hey, you look terrible, take
the rest of the day off", He starts to argue,saying he feels great
but the boss orders him out.
  Well, the guy thinks, maybe there is something to all this,
I'd better go to the doctor just in case.
  At the doctors, he sits down and tells the MD "Look Doc,
all day Ive been feeling great but everyone says I look
awful, whats up?"
  The Doc gets down his big book of medicine and starts to flick
through it :
  "Hmm, looks awful, feels awful, no thats not it...."
(flip)
"Looks great, feels great, nooo....."
(flip)
"Looks great, feels awful, nope......"
(flip)
"AH here we are, 'looks awful, feels great' : you're a cunt"

There is this pack of Huskies(UW) walking down the street being led by their
head coach.  As they approach an ally, a solitary Cougar(WSU) jumps out and
starts taunting the Huskies saying, "Ha you Huskies are sooo dumb and weak
that I could take you all on single handed....you all are just a pack of
dogs...hahaha", and he jumps back in.  Well, not to let his team stand for
such insults, the coach says, "Ok, half of you go into that ally and get
that Cougar!"  So half of the team, about 50 men, run into the ally.  From
the ally comes the sound of a horrific fight and then silence which is soon
broken by the Cougar jumping back out and taunting the Huskies once again,
"HA HA HA, you are all so dumb....even I can't believe it...come and get me
if you dare", after which he jumps back in.  Of course the rest of the
Husky team starts running for the ally to get the Cougar, but before they
get there, one battered Husky crawls out of the ally saying, "No Wait!,
it's a trap, there are TWO of them!"

Once, a traveling salesman was driving along an old country dirt road, miles from
civilization.  Things would have been fine, but needed to take a shit, real bad.
So, at the next farm house he found, he stopped and asked the farmer if he could
use his restroom.  "Sure thing," said the farmer, pointing to an old, dilapidated
outhouse.

Well, the salesman was obviously in something of a hurry, so he didn't argue with
the man.  He dropped his drawers, and (avoiding splinters), took his seat.  Well,
before and during such a grand movement, he was too busy to take note that there
was nothing with which to clean up with afterward.  When he DID notice, it was too
late.

"Sir," he called to the farmer, still doing chores on the outside, "there doesn't
seem to be any toilet paper in here.  How am I supposed to clean up?"

"Well, do you see that open slot in the wall?"

"Yeah, I do," said the salesman, looking at what at first appeared to be a large,
horizontal space between the boards in the side of the outhouse.

"Well, here's what you do: use your hand to clean off, and when you're finished,
stick your hand in the slot, and it'll be cleaned right off."

The saleman was skeptical, and also a bit squeamish, but he had no choice.  He
cleaned himself off as best he could, and stuck his hand through the slot, into
the daylight.

Now, just on the other side of the wall, outside the hole, there was a monkey,
holding two bricks.  When the man's hand appeared through the slot, the monkey
smashed those bricks together as hard as he could, sandwiching the man's hand.

Back in the john, the man cries out in pain as his hand gets smashed, pulls it
back in, and sticks the hand in his mouth.

An American, a German, and a Polishman are on a safari deep in the woods
of Africa.  The tour guide, a native African, stopped suddenly, and looked at 
the gentlemen.  He said, "I will not go further in this jungle.  Just ahead
are rare cannibals.  I will not risk my life."  The three gentlemen look at
each other, and decide to check it out.  The tour guide split, and the guys
started walking.  It wasn't long before they were captured by the cannibals.
The cannibals tied them up and hung them upside down from a tree.  The chief
came up to them and said, "We are cannibals.  We will eat your insides, use
your bones for tools, and use your skin to cover our canoes.".  The chief turned
to the American and said, "Do you have a last request?".  The American replied,
"Bring me a knife.".  The chief brings him a knife and hands it to the
American.  The American opens the knife and says, "I will die with pride!", and
slits his throat.  The chief asked the same thing to the German.  The German
said, "Bring me a knife also.".  The chief brings hime the knife, and the
German said, "I won't let YO kill me!", and he stabs himself in the heart.  The
chief turned to the Polishman, and said, "What is your request?".  The
Polishman says, "Bring me a fork.".  The chief was puzzled, but he brought him
a fork.  The Polishman started stabbing himself all over his body, screaming,
"You're not going to make a canoe out of me!!

Gilligan's Island:
The Professor finds some rare binary coconuts that can be used to upgrade 
the ROM in his bamboo clone modem to support X.25. After hours of effort, 
he manages to establish a connection via his papaya-based VT 100 terminal 
and satellite uplink with Telenet, but falls asleep from exhaustion. 
Gilligan walks up and types "+++" then "ATH" and drops the line. The 
Skipper beans him with a rock and finally loses it, his seafaring years 
catch up with him and he starts making lewd remarks to Mary Ann about 
playing Leisure Suit Larry IV together. Meanwhile, Mr. Howell finally 
figures out how to work the ISDN set that was accidently dropped by a  
passing JAL jet and has a heart attack when he hears via Dow Jones News 
Retrieval that the stock market has soared above 3000 points. Ginger calls 
CompuServe and E-mails some software developers in an effort to convince 
them that she should would be a good model for MacStripPoker 2.0. 
Eventually, all connectivity on the island is lost, when Gilligan 
discovers an actor in a bad gorilla costume has shorted pins 2&3 on the 
serial cable, and everybody on the island has just been echoing characters 
to each other.

Beverly Hillbillies
Miss Jane tries to convince Mr. Drysdale to network all the PCs in the 
bank, but, typically, he won't spend the money. Frustrated, Miss Jane 
pleads with Jed Clampett to persuade Mr. Drysdale to "put in the LAN," but 
Jed thinks she said "put in the ham." Jed then gets Granny to cook up a 
dozen hams and has Jethro and Ellie Mae bring them to the bank. When they 
arrive, everybody is out to lunch, so Jethro begins to distribute the 
hams, but is frustrated when he can't get the coaxial cable to stay 
attached to the ham bone. To further complicate matters, Ellie May has 
brought along her pet goats, which begin to eat the ham and cable, causing 
the the VAX to short out and force an emergency electronic fund transfer 
of the Clampett millions to a competitive bank. As Mr. Drysdale is seen 
chasing Miss Jane down the hall with a crazed look in his eye, swinging a 
ham at her, Jed is heard to remark, "Weee-doggie! Why look at that Granny. 
Mr. Drysdale is so happy about whut we done, he's gonna give Miss Jane her 
own ham!"

The Brady Bunch
Peter uses Crosstalk Mk.4 to dial into the high school computer and, 
through hacking tricks picked up from a local "adults only" BBS, is able 
to access individual student's "permanent records." He scans through the 
listings, then, using a clever keyboard macro, alters his completed 
courses such that he won't be required to take English Lit again. However, 
Jan is working in the school office at the time and is alerted to the 
invasion by a diligent anti-virual TSR. She is then tormented with having 
to decide to do the "right thing" or be loyal to her brother. Jan goes 
home and talks to Alice, who says she should analyze all the factors and 
then decide after using the new artificial intelligence software Mr. Brady 
has recently installed on his '386 laptop. Jan tries to use the program, 
but instead accidently deletes all the files in the Harvard Graphics 
directory, leaving Mr. Brady to blow a presentation the next day. Mrs. 
Brady finds out via Jan what happened, and forces Peter to write "I will 
not hack into the school computer" 5000 times with EDLIN while the rest of 
the family eats angle food cake on the patio.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show
Mr. Grant tells Mary to come up with some hard facts about all the 
activity out in Silicon Valley. Mary grabs her Mac portable and jumps on a 
plane west. Unfortunately, she leaves the Mac switched on and, due to an 
undiscovered bug in the latest release of System and Finder, the hard disk 
continually optimizes itself when no keyboard input is recorded for more 
than five minutes. Needless to say, she has a dead Mac when arriving and 
spends the next few hours trying to find a replacement. Meanwhile, Ted 
begins his broadcast and notes that "We expected to have some good 
information about Silicon Valley for this broadcast, but somebody had to 
take a Mac and not a reliable laptop PC!" Frantic, Mary calls long 
distance over crystalline fiber optic lines to get help from Rhoda, who 
doesn't answer the phone because she is playing Bomber and has the 
headphones on. However, Phyllis's snotty daughter is around and answers. 
She listens to Mary whine, then hangs up the phone. Mary is last seen 
violently flinging the Mac out a speeding taxi window while crossing the 
Bay Bridge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In view of recent admonitions against jokes maligning any
class of people, I thought I'd put together some examples
of humor that are approved within the Tandem Values.  Note
how these jokes arise from existing ones that are not
permitted, showing that humor can be found anywhere.


WRONG:  Why can't blondes take coffee breaks?

This joke is offensive to two classes of people, blondes and
coffee drinkers.  It might also offend people who do not drink
coffee for religious reasons.

RIGHT:  Why can't pigmentially-challenged individuals take a short
          rest between job tasks?
        Because the Mail Police are reading this joke.


WRONG:  How do you kill a pink elephant?

This joke has many problems, as it is offensive to environmentalists,
vegetarians, and elephants of all colors.  It also promotes racism
and classism among elephants, and, perhaps, among other species as
well.  It should not be sent to the HUMOR sig for these reasons.

RIGHT:  How do you address an elephant of any color whatsoever?
        Ask the Mail Police for full instructions.


WRONG:  How do you double the value of a Yugo?

This joke would not be allowed because it offends Yugoslavians,
other people affected by the strife in Eastern Europe, and goes
against the Communist belief system that material goods are
provided by the state for its populace and therefore should have
no monetary value whatsoever.  Members of the bicycle-sig will
also feel uncomfortable because this joke encourgages automobile
use.

RIGHT:  How do you improve a vehicle?
        Confirm with the Mail Police that the vehicle is allowed
          on Tandem Mail.


WRONG:  An engineer, a physicist, a mathematician, and a psychologist
          are stuck in a burning building.  Who gets out alive?

This message should not be sent because it encourgages classism,
elitism, and implies that those who study different disciplines
deserve to perish in a tragedy through no fault of their own.
Tandem Values require respect for all individuals in all jobs
they do.

RIGHT:  Four Tandemites are stuck in a burning building.  How do
          you rescue all of them before it collapses?
        First meet with the Mail Police to be sure no favoritism
          is shown towards any group in whom is rescued initially.


WRONG:  How do you make love to an <ethnic> woman?

There are so many reasons this joke is inappropriate for Tandem
mail that this memo cannot begin to catalog all of them.  Hiding
behind the designator <ethnic> does not absolve the joke-sender
of sending abusive mail messages to protected groups, because it
is usually quite clear which group is being slandered.  In any
event, the sobriquet <ethnic> implies that non-ethnics are in
some way superior, which goes against Tandem Values.

The joke also shows a lack of respect for women in two ways.
First, it implies that the teller and listener of the joke are
both male.  No joke of that sort should be sent, because this
precludes women from feeling fully accepted at Tandem.  Second,
it implies that the woman can only be satisfied one particular
way, and that this rests outside of her, i.e. she needs a man to
be complete.  Finally, this joke excludes gays and lesbians since
it has a heterosexualist bias.

RIGHT:  How does a Tandemite get satisfaction?
        Have the Mail Police ensure no one is offending anyone else.


WRONG:  What happens when you cross a Jehovah's Witness with
          a dyslexic agnostic?

Jokes that demean religious groups are unacceptable.  This includes
people who choose not to practice religion.  Dyslexics are an
example of a handicapped class and should not be insulted.
This joke is offensive to creationists because it implies that
evolution proceeds due to inter-species mating habits.  Members
of certain religious groups may also find these random matings
offensive to their belief systems.

RIGHT:  Tell me the best way all religious groups can feel
          comfortable working together at Tandem.
        I'll have the Mail Police explain that to you right away.


WRONG:  A gorilla walks into a bar and orders a martini.

Since a number of Tandem employees are uncomfortable with
the problems of alcohol, jokes should not be set in bars
or at social gatherings noted for alcohol usage.

RIGHT:  A gorilla walks into a hardware store and orders a martini.

WRONG:  An IBM salesman is stuck on a desert island.

Desert islands make reference to the recent Gulf War, and should
be avoided.  It is also against Tandem values to make jokes about
the competition.  Simply describing their products is all the
humor that's necessary.

RIGHT:  An IBM AS/400 is set up in a room at 105 degrees
          Fahrenheit (40 C).  The Mail Police are called to
          see if it crashes, which it probably will.


WRONG:  Which doesn't belong, meat, wife, or blowjob?

Haven't you learned anything yet?  This joke is sexist and
offensive to women and vegetarians.

RIGHT:  Which doesn't belong, ethics, values, or Mail Police?


WRONG:  A man's penis size doesn't matter, unless you're having
          sex with him.
That doesn't mean you can make fun of men, just because they're
the dominant class.  Besides, these jokes usually trigger a barrage
of anti-female ones, and then we're back to Lawsuit City.

RIGHT:  A Tandemite's paycheck size doesn't matter, unless they're
          arguing with the Mail Police.


WRONG:  How many CNN reporters does it take to change a light bulb?

Tandem Values preclude mention of corporate entities, such as CNN
in this example.  The whole category of light bulb jokes is also
contraindicated, as General Electric may choose to sue over
improper use of their product.

RIGHT:  How many TTN reporters does it take to produce "First Friday?"
        Wait a minute, the Mail Police want to be sure this isn't a
          violation of something.


WRONG:  What did Pee-Wee Herman say to Jeffrey Dahmer?

Can't you do anything right?  It's "What did Jeffrey Dahmer
say to Pee-Wee Herman?" and the answer is "Stop playing with
my food."

A while ago, I posted a collection of quotes I plastered my door with.  I've
also got these:
  Here we sit, 'mongst yonder junk.
Our room smells like a skunk.
Eyes will water, and noses burn--
It's enough to make your stomach churn.
  This room will give you quite a scare;
To all who enter here beware:
You'll lose all hope of breathing air!
  Since the mess in this room has known antidote,
You're better off just leaving a note.

Here we sit, we're cursed liars:
No mess, no junk, no toxic fires.
Alas, dear lass:  would dass to ask?
How to repent:  prevent this indenting
   precedent for demented impediments
   with pennace?
For here we sit, 'mongst yonder space,
Void of clutter, butter, and mace.
There is no trace; we've room to pace!
So now the old is obsolete.
Bear it well, and be discrete.

Here I sit, beyonder you,
Wonder what I want to do.
Flee the bees, ski the seas,
Knee the peas, or speak Chinese--
All these would please my Pekinese.
  But what I really want is poetry,
And then you really have to know a tree.
Like the maple or the birch or the elm or the oak,
And don't forget the giant artichoke.
  But alas, dear lass, I have to pass,
For I know no trees and blow no breeze,
Believe me reader!  I do not tease,
Deceive the dead, or weave the web,
Perceive the bed, or leave the sled!
  So what I'll do no soul could guess--
I'm going to make my room a mess.

A kindly old priest, while taking his afternoon walk, sees a little boy
sitting beside a basket in the back yard of a house in the neighborhood.
The priest takes a closer look and notices that the basket contains a
mother cat and five tiny kittens, obviously just a few days old.
  "Well, now," the priest says to the child, "and what kind of kittens
might those be?"
  "They're Catholic kittens, Father!"  says the little boy.
  The priest, chuckling, pats the kid on the head and walks on.
  Three weeks later, the priest is taking his walk and sees the same
little boy playing in the yard.  The kittens are there, too, now 
much larger and scampering around.
  The priest smiles and says "Well, my little friend, what kind of
kittens did you say those were?"
  "They're agnostic kittens, Father."  the little boy answers.
Taken aback, the priest asks "Now, what would make you say a thing
like that?"
  "Well," the boy says, "they have their eyes open now!"

(Excerpts quoted from Sept 1991 issue of MacUser)

Q: ... Periodically the screen shakes. Can this harm the hardware? ...

Andy: ... And don't forget that, according to Apple's standard warranty card,
if technicians tell you, "Oh, they all do that," you're allowed to poke them
right in the eye. ...

Bob: Excellent advice. I disagree only on one point: I don't recommend going
around poking technicians in the eye. A better technique is to loudly proclaim,
"To h*** with this! I can buy an IBM clone and Windows 3 for one-tenth the cost
of a similarly equipped Mac!" I guarantee your Mac will be fixed on the spot.

Q: ... I get a message saying, "The Application has unexpectly quit (1)." ...

Bob: ... Of course, with Systems 6.0.7 and 7, Apple has replaced the
meaningless error-ID numbers (1, 2, 12, 25, and so on) with meaningless phrases
such as "Co-processor not installed," "Bus error," and the ever-popular
"Address error." Not only are these phrases meaningful only to people who
understand the internal architecture ... but they also often have nothing to do
with the cause of the problem.

ObJoke:  This guy goes to Texas on vacation.  (No, that's not the
punchline.)  When he's ready to leave the airport, he hails a cab, but
a stretch limo pulls up.  So he tells the driver he only wanted a
cab.
     "This is a cab, sir.  Everything's bigger in Texas."
     Not bad, the guy thinks.  So he gets to his hotel, and when he's
shown to his room, it's a four-room suite with jacuzzi and waterbed. 
The man protests that he only wanted a single room.
     "This is a single room, sir.  Everything's bigger in Texas."
     Better and better.  After a nap, the guy goes down to the hotel
bar to have a beer before dinner.  The bartender brings him a
two-quart pitcher, and the guy points out he only wanted one beer.
     "This is your beer, sir.  Everything's bigger in Texas."
     After this beer, the guy is feeling a little tipsy, and he can't
find his way to the restaurant.  He ends up falling in the hotel pool
instead.  So he yells, "Don't flush!"

Two Polacks are drving along in their truck when the y see a pig by the side
of the road. Well, this is pretty unusual, so they stop for a look.
  They're sitting there when a highway patrolman rolls up in his car.
the patrolman thinks this is odd, so stops. He looks at the two poles and
says "Does this pig belong to you two?"
  "No officer, we were just driving along and saw the pig here. We stopped and
were trying to figure out what to do with it."
  The officer looks at them for a moment and then says " Well, since ya'll have
a truck there, why don't you put the pig in the truck and take it to the Dallas
Zoo?'
  Well, the polacks figure that's a pretty good idea, and start to load the pig
up. The officer drives off, figuring things are well in hand.
  A few days later, the officer is out patrolling and he sees a truck going the
opposite direction with the two poles in the front, with the pig between them
with a baseball cap on its head. The officer wheels the car around and
pulls the truck over. He goes to the cab and the polack rolls down the window.
  "Boys," he says" I thought I told you two to take that pig to the zoo."
"Well, officer, we did take him to the zoo. As a matter of fact, he liked it
so much, we figured we'd take him to the Rangers game today!"

A Frenchman, an Englishman, a Texan, and a Mexican are flying in a plane.
The pilot explains to her passengers that the plane is too heavy and in
order to avoid an ugly crash, some weight needs to be removed from the
plane.	After removing all the unnecessary items (baggage,etc.), the pilot
reports that the plane is still too heavy and yet more weight needs to be
removed.  She then asks if any of the passengers would be brave enough to
give up their own lives to save the others.  The Frenchman stands, raises
his glass,says "Viva la France!" and jumps out of the plane.  This not being
enough, the Englishman stands up, raises his glass, says"Long live the
Queen!" and jumps out of the plane.  Still this is not enough weight
removed so the Texan stands up, raises his glass, says "Remember the Alamo?"
and throws the Mexican out of the plane.

In the early days of baseball, there was a famous pitcher named Mel,
Mel Faimy, who played for the Milwaukee Brewers.  He was the best
pitcher in the league and led his team to the world series with a .01
ERA, 4 no hitters and 2 perfect games.  Well as expected the Brewers
went to the World Series.  They were playing against the Brooklyn
Dodgers.
  The first game Mel pitched a no hitter and the Brewers won 2-0.  The
second game the Dodgers pulled out a squeaker, winning in the bottom
of the 9th on a solo home run.  Again in the 3rd game the Dodgers won.
Mel pitched the 4th game so of course the Brewers won.  They won the
next game, the Dodgers won the 6th.
  So the Series was all tied up at three games apiece.  The ace pitcher
for the Dodgers was pitching against Mel.  It was tight game, the
Brewers were leading by one point.  Mel was so confident of himself
he started to celebrate early.  During the 7th inning stretch he
popped open a beer and started drinking.  Between the next innings he
had a few more beers.  As you might have guessed this had a negative
impact on his pitching.
  The next batter dribbled a single down the third base line.  Mel
walked the next batter and the next.  With bases loaded, (Mel was
too), Mel proceeded to walk in a run!  The coach came out and talked
to Mel asking if he was alright.  Some how Mel convinced the coach he
was fine.  The next batter came up to bat.  Mel took a deep breath
and fired his patented fast ball.  The batter swung and popped a
ball foul.  The next pitch was a ball.  Mel wound up and threw a big
arching curve, just barely missing the plate.  With the count 2-1,
Mel stepped off the mound for a brief rest.  He was alittle blurry
eyed by now and needed to catch his breath.  He walked back to the
rubber and got ready to throw the next pitch.  A scorching slider
just missed low.  With the score tied, bases loaded, and the count
3-1, every one in the stands held their collective breath for the
next pitch.  Mel came in with his never fail change up.  The batter
swung on the pitch, but he was way out in front of it.  The count was
full, the bases loaded, bottom of the 9th, and the score tied.  The
scene was set for the making or breaking of heros.  Our hero, Mel was
getting ready to throw the final pitch when all of a sudden the beers
he drank finally hit him.  The last pitch was his fast ball.  It left
his hand speeding toward the batter.  Then about 10 feet in front of
the plate it took a nose dive and bounced in the dirt.  Mel had
walked in the winning run!
  After much jubilation on the Dodgers part, the team finally left the
field.  As they pasted the Brewers bench on of the players turned and
pointed to his team mate and said, "Hey what's with all the beer cans
in the Brewers dug-out?"
  "That my friend, is the beer that made Mel Faimy walk us!"

The devil calls up St.Peter and says, "Let's have a baseball game - my people
against your people."
  St. Peter thinks this over, checks his populace, and says, "Sure, but you're
gonna lose - I've got all the hall of famers up here."
  "Maybe so", replies the devil, "but I've got all the umpires!"

  A hunter goes into the woods to hunt a bear.  He carries his trusty
22-gauge rifle with him.  After a while, he spots a very large bear,
takes aim, and fires.  When the smoke clears, the bear is gone.  A
moment later the bear taps the hunter on the shoulder and says,
	"No one shoots at me and gets away with it.  You have
	two choices:  I can rip your throat out and eat you,
	or you can drop your trousers, bend over, and I'll
	[ insert appropriate colloquial for sodomy here ]."
  The hunter decides that anything is better than death, so he drops his
trousers and bends over, and the bear does what he said he would do.
After the bear has left, the hunter pulls up his trousers again and
staggers back into town.  He's pretty mad.
  He buys a much larger gun and returns to the forest.  He sees the same
bear, aims, and fires.  When the smoke clears, the bear is gone.  A
moment later the bear taps the hunter on the shoulder and says,
	"You know what to do."
  Afterwards, the hunter pulls up his trousers, crawls back into town,
and buys a bazooka.  Now he's really mad.  He returns to the forest,
sees the bear, aims, and fires.  The force of the bazooka blast knocks
him flat on his back.  When the smoke clears, the bear is standing over
him and says,
	"You're not doing this for the hunting, are you?"

One of the nice things about working with Apple equipment is their delightful
sense of humor. A while ago, some of the delightful error messages from the
MPW C compiler went out on the net. They also have a series of developers' CDs
with software and interesting junk on them with great names like, "Lord of the
Files," "The Code Warrior," "Desperately Seeking Seven," "Gorilla's in the
Disk," "Bill and Ted's Excellent CD," and so on. I have meant for some time to
type in the personal ads that adorn "Desperately Seeking Seven," which are
amusing. Yesterday, while rummaging through some test code, I found a
delightful disclaimer. -- jdcc

God and the Devil are having a discussion.
God: To many spirits are sneaking into heaven from hell. I want you to stop it.
Devil: What are you going to do if I don't.
God: I'll sue you.
Devil: Yeah Right, Like you have any lawyers in heaven.

Subject: A Fundamental Offering
    A cool new product was announced today. It is Digital's Data 
    Suppository. It is by far the very best tool we have for anal-
    ysis. It relieves painful data by letting you apply the cor-
    rect tools to the job. You can scope out any problem and wipe out those 
    annoying delays we all encounter in trying to get the straight poop on 
    our businesses. You can make intelligent decisions on partners and 
    vendors who are friends and those who are enemas. You no longer have to 
    be the butt of business jokes.
          It is important to decide to commit to this new strategy. In some
    environments such a decision takes substantial intestinal fortitude. So 
    we recommend that a prospect take the time to read the technical 
    information and digest it. But don't just sit on it.
          If you have any questions, call 1-800-773-7724 (1-800-PREPARH). And
    remember, we are the leaders in this technology. We will no longer 
    accept being number 2.

A man was hitchhiking across the country just prior to a
presidential election and had hit upon a technique for getting 
free drinks in bars by guessing which candidate was less popular
and then loudly badmouthing them.  He went into a bar in Colorado
and yelled, "Carter is a horse's ass!"  To his surprise, he was
promptly thrown outside into the dirt.  He picked himself up and
went into another bar, shouting, "Reagan is a horse's ass!"  Seconds
later, he was eating dust again.
      Seeing a cowboy nearby, he called out, "Hey, fella!  If this ain't
Carter country and it ain't Reagan country, whose country is it?"
      The cowboy replied, "Son, this is *horse* country!"

PRANKSTERS TAKE LAWN ORNAMENT ON VACATION
PATTERSON (AP) - Florence and Pat McMorrow didn't get to travel throughout
America this summer but their elf, Rufus, did.
  Rufus is a 3-foot-high lawn ornament owned by the McMorrows, of Patterson, a
community north of New York City.
  Someone swiped Rufus July 9 from his usual perch on a tree stump in the
couple's front lawn.  He reappeared last week with an envelope tucked under his
arm.  "I'm home.  Vacation pictures", a note on the envelope read.
  There was Rufus on the beach in California, wearing shades.  There he was in
Wyoming, wearing an Indian headdress.  There he was at Wrigley Field in
Chicago, watching the Chicago Cubs.  In all, there were photos of Rufus in 17
states.
  Police and the McMorrow family still don't know who took the statute [sic].
"It was definitely young people," Mrs. McMorrow said.  "They have some sense of
humor."
