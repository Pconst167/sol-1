Ok, did you hear this one:

Middle of the night, middle of nowhere, thwo cars both slightly cross
over the white line in the centre of the road. They collide and a
fair amount of damage is done, although neither is hurt. It's
impossible to assess blame for the accident on either however.

They both get out. One is a doctor, one is a lawyer. The lawyer calls
the police on his car phone; they'll be there in 20 minutes.

It's cold and damp, and both men are shaken up. The laywer offers
the doctor a drink of brandy from his hip flask, the doctor accepts,
drinks and hands it back to the laywer, who puts it away.

``Arnt you going to have a drink ?'' the doctor says.

``AFTER the police get here'' replies the lawyer.

"Of course you are right," the old woman says.  "Thank Stalin."  She is

	A ventriloquist in a nightclub is telling a series of [ethnic]
jokes.  He plays straight man while the little dummy on his knee poses
the riddles and answers questions.  After many of these, a doddering
old man gets up from his chair and shouts, "Will you just knock it off!"
Everyone in the room turns to look and the ventriloquist stops.  "I'm
just sick and tired of all these idiodic [ethnic] jokes that try to
make [ethnic]s look so stupid!  'How many [ethnics] does it take to
screw in a lightbulb?'...  'There was an Italian, a Jew and an [ethnic]...'
and so on!  Well just stop it, because we [ethnics] proud of our
heritage, our contribution to civilization and the great intellects
we have produced!"  The club is silent as the old man sits down
angrily.  Finally, the ventriloquist, in a conciliatory tone, says,
"Sir, I am really sorry to cause such an offense.  I really didn't 
intend to hurt anybody's feelings at all.  I just want everyone to
have a nice time and enjoy themselves, and the last thing I want
to do is make someone upset.  Would you accept my apology?"
The old man gets up suddenly and exclaims, "It's not *you* I'm

I heard this one from a dissident that our local Amnesty International
group got out:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through the center of Czechoslovakia there a train speeding along.  In one 
compartment of the train there are four people.  A beautiful vivacious young
woman, an old matronly woman, a Russian soldier, and a Czech dissident.

Suddenly the train goes through a tunnel.

It is completely dark.

Then is heard a loud kiss and an equally powerful slap.

When the train exits the tunnel, the Russian soldier is holding the side of his
face, and the Czech dissident is grinning his face off.

The old matronly woman thinks : "Now that's a fine young woman, the Russian 
     soldier tries to steal a kiss in the tunnel and the lady slaps him one!"

The young woman is thinking : "Now that's a strange Russian soldier, he'd 
     rather kiss that old hag than me."

The Russian soldier is thinking : "Now that's a smart Czech, he steal the kiss
     and I get slapped."

And the Czech dissident is thinking : "Gee I'm smart!  We go through the
     tunnel, I kiss the back of my hand and get away with slapping a
     Russian soldier."

   The Men of the Smog shall vanquish the Men of the Oak
   In a war fought seven battles long
   And defeat the Athletic Men strong

   And the Men of the Smog shall fight in the West
   A fierce war of seven battles against the Bay Men
   And the sphere shall meet the stick many times
   And the unruly northern supporters shall have many fines

   And in the final section of the seventh battle
   A great earthquake shall have the sphere struck over a wall
   And the great Athletic Ones shall not recover the sphere
   And Southern Men shall win the series by one run clear

	 Sleazonia, Ont. 3N7 N5S
	 
	1/2-sided, sloppy-sectored, 5 3/8 inch droopy disk. 39 cents.
	 
	 
	As you might expect from this program's name and price, it's a
	bare-bones, no-frills word processor package.  What does 'bare bones'
	mean?  For one thing, you don't get multiple screens - in fact, you get
	no screens at all.  Joe, the program's writer, claims that in about six
	months an update (19 cents) will be available that'll give the program
	video-display capabilities.  In the meantime, you'll simply have to
	remember what you key in. 
	 
	Another upgrade will enable you to type upper-case characters and
	numbers greater than seven.  But don't let these seemingly negative
	comments dissuade you from buying the program.  In reality, the 39 cent
	price makes it good value for the money.  You can for, example, use the
	disk as a coaster for large beer mugs. 
	 
	What are the program's good points?  It contains a 3-word spelling
	correction program called (predictably) MediocreSpeller.  If you
	misspell the words A, AND, or THE, it causes your computer to shut off
	and locks the disk drive head on track 42. 
	 
	MediocreWriter's documentation is in keeping with the program's other
	annoying features.  It consists of a barely legible mimeographed sheet
	with the following insruction's on it:
	 
	 * Turn computer on
	 * Insert disk
	 * Use program
	 
	The program is not copy protected.
	
	Explains Joe: 'Who would want to copy it?' And it takes little memory
	space: 323 bytes.  It's available for the Lemming/dos operating system
	for use on Joe's PC (available from Joe for $9.95). 
	 
	 
	ASST. SYSOP'S COMMENTS:
	 
	In short, MediocreWriter is Joe's latest attempt to write software that
	works.  It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: the
	sleeziest, most limited, bug-ridden word-processing program that exists.
	
	Joe admits, 'it stinks.' In addition to its lack of a video-display
	capability, it has a tendency to set computers on fire and trigger
	nearby automatic washing machines.  It handles 21 lower-case alphabetic
	characters and numbers from one to six; punctuation is limited to the
	exclamation point. 
	 
	The program is interactive with Joe's other two packages: Lousycalc, a

When he takes off his shoes and socks, it is apparent that his toes

"Oh, I used to have toe-lio," says he.  "You mean polio?"  "No,

    Everthing is farther away than it used to be.  It is even twice as far to
the corner and they have added a hill.  I have given up running for the
bus; it leaves earlier than it used to.
    It seems to me they are making the stairs steeper than in the old
days.  And have you noticed the smaller print they use in the newspapers?
    There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as
everbody speaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them.
    The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the
hips and waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one's shoelaces.
And the sizes don't run the way they used to.  The 12's and 14's are so
much smaller.
    Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used
to be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much
older than I am.
    I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so much
that she didn't recognize me.
    I got to thinking about the poor dear while I was combing my hair
this morning and in so doing I glanced at my own reflection.  Really
now, they don't even make good mirrors like they used to.

This is a case of law found in a West Law digest.  This is an actual
case heard by the Michigan court of appeals (Fisher v. Low, 333 N.W.2d 67)
that was recently shown to me by somebody at school (after a long time
being a software engineer I started evening law school).  I thought
it was funny...you be the judge.

Court of Appeals of Michigan
Docket No. 60732

A wayward Chevy struck a tree
whose owner sued defendants three.
He sued car's owner, driver too,
and insurer for what was his due.
For his oak tree that now may bear
a lasting need for tender care.
the Oakland County Circuit court,
John O' Brian, J., set forth
the judgment the defendants sought
and quickly an appeal was brought.

Court of appeals, J.H.Gillis, J.
Gave thought to this and had this to say:
1)There is no liability
since no-fault grants immunity;
2)No jurisdiction can be found
where process service is unsound;
and thus the judgment, as it's termed
is due to be and is
Affirmed.

Reason summaries (Squibbs)
1.
Defendant's Chevy struck a tree-
there was no liability;
the No-Fault Act comes into play
as owner and the driver say.
barred by the act's immunity
no suit in tort will aid the tree.
Although the oak's in disarray
No court can make defendants pay.

2.
No jurisdiction could be found
where process service was unsound;
In personam jurisdiction
was not even legal fiction.
Where plaintiff failed to well comply
with rules of court that did apply.

Summary of appeal court's opinion
J.H. Gillis, Judge
We thought that we would never see
a suit to compensate a tree.
A suit whose claim in tort is prest
upon a mangled tree's behest.
A tree whose battered trunk was prest
against a Chevy's crumpled crest.
A tree that faces each new day
with bark and linb in disarray.
A tree that may forever bear
a lasting need for tender care.
Flora lovers though we three,
we must uphold the court's decree.

Affirmed.

(This joke courtesy of orchestral trumpeter Michael Bowman)

A judge, a bishop, and a conductor were having a discussion.  All three
were rather vain men, and their talk soon turned to the question of which
of them was the greatest.

"Well," said the judge, "my position is one of dignity and power.  When
I walk into the courtroom, the bailiff says 'All rise!' and all the people
stand to pay me honor."

"That's very nice," said the bishop.  "People stand in your honor;  but
when people have an audience with me they kneel, kiss my ring, and they
address me as 'Your Holiness.'"

The conductor snorted and said, "I think I got you both beat;  when I
step onto the podium, as guest conductor, the people look down, put their
hands over their eyes, and say 'Oh, my God!'"

  So there are three golfers, (Bob, Max, and Ted) who are looking for a 
fourth. Bob mentions that his friend George is a pretty good golfer, so
they decide to invite him for the following Saturday.

  "Sure, I'd love to play," says George, "but I may be about ten minutes
late, so wait for me."

  So Saturday rolls around. Bob, Max, and Ted arrive promptly at 9:00,
and find George already waiting for them. He plays right-handed, and
beats them all. Quite pleased with their new fourth, they ask him if
he'd like to play again the following Saturday.

  "Yeah, sounds great," says George. "But I may be about ten minutes
late, so wait for me."

  The following Saturday, again, all four golfers show up on time, but
this time George plays left-handed, and beats them all. As they're
getting ready to leave, George says:

  "See you next Saturday. But I may be about ten minutes late, so wait
for me."

  Every week, George is right on time, and plays great with whichever
hand he decides to use. And every week, he departs with the same
message.

  After a couple months, Ted is pretty tired of this routine, so he
says, "Wait a minute, George. Every week you say you may be about ten
minutes late, but you're right on time. And you beat us either
left-handed or right-handed. What's the story?"

  "Well," George says, "I'm kind of superstitious. When I get up in the
morning, I look at my wife. If she's sleeping on her left side, I play
left-handed. And if she's sleeping on her right side, I play
right-handed."

  "So what do you do if she's sleeping on her back?" Bob asks.

  "Then I'm about ten minutes late," George answers.

During a recent international sports meet , one of the Scottish
track and field coaches was entertaining some friends and col-
leagues in his hotel room. As so often occurs the libations were
used up before it was time to end the festivities.

After receiving directions to the nearest wine/liquor store, the
Scottish coach departed the party.

Upon arriving at the store, he noticed that there were only three
or four people waiting in the queue.

Immediately ahead of him were two men dressed in military fa-
tigues and heavily bearded.  He overhead one of them ordering
several bottles of Scotch and rum. Upon being told the value of
his purchases, this fatigue dressed individual told the clerk
that he was with Fidel. Immediately the clerk produced a book
and had the individual sign for his purchases. To say that the
Scotsman was intrigued would be an understatement.

The other individual in front of the Scotsman proceeded to order
at least twice what his companion had ordered. Upon receipt of
his total he also told the clerk that he was with Fidel.  Same
book, same procedure as the first fatigue clad individual.

By this time the Scotsman had figured he was on to a good thing.

He ordered bottles of this, that, cigars, cigarettes etc.  Upon
being presented with his bill he told the clerk that he was with
Fidel.

The clerk told him that he could not be with Fidel.

   "Why not?" said the indignant Scotsman.

   "Because you do not have the beard and the big cigar." the
clerk replied.

Pausing for only a moment, the Scotsman reached down, lifted up
his kilt and proudly announced, "SECRET SERVICE!!!"

True story:

I used to work for T.I. in Houston.  Once a young programmer fellow
>From the Bedford, England came to do some consulting.  He was a nice
enough guy, but very stiff and proper.  On his last day before returning
to G.B., I took him to lunch at a Luby's Cafeteria.  While waiting
in line, I told him that before he left Texas, he simply *must* try
some mepyew.  

He said, "What?"  

I said, "Mepyew.  It is very popular. Everyone here eats it with lunch.
Sort of a Texas tradition. The woman in the serving line will ask you 
if you want some."

I give a sly wink or two to various prospective diners who
were overhearing the conversation and looking quizical.

He agreed to order some mepyew.

We approached the first station where the lady was selling jello
deserts and chilled salads.

"Mepyew?", she asked.
"Yes please," he responded.
"Mepyew?"
"Yes."
"Mepyew?"  (Now with noticable agitation.)
"Yes! If you Please!"
"Well ahm not a mind reader!"

I laughed a little.

Finally realizing that he had been had, he proceded directly to the
roast beef and mashed potatoes, as any good Englishman would.

I giggled.  The people I had winked at giggled.  My English friend
busied himself with macaroni and cake.

Back at the office, Shiela and Mike giggled.  The Englishman studied
a directory listing.

Someday, I'm going to invent a dish called mepyew.  Maybe it will be
a jello and roast beef casserole.

So he decided to try the mystery hole, stood up on the bed and put is

Four Oxford professors (dons, whatever...) were taking their evening walk
together and as usual, were engaged in casual but learned conversation.
On this particular evening, their conversation was about the names given
to groups of animals, such as a "pride of lions" or a "gaggle of geese."

One of the professors noticed a group of prostitutes down the block, and
posed the question, "What name would be given to that group?"  The four
fell into silence for a moment, as they pondered the possibilities...

At last, one spoke: "How about 'a Jam of Tarts'?"  The others nodded in
acknowledgement as they continued to consider the problem.  A second
professor spoke: "I'd suggest 'an Essay of Trollops.'"  Again, the
others nodded.  A third spoke: "I propose 'a Flourish of Strumpets.'"

They continued their walk in silence, until the first professor remarked
to the remaining professor, who was the most senior and learned of the
four, "You haven't suggested a name for our ladies.  What are your thoughts?"
The fourth professor replied, "'An Anthology of Prose.'"

TALKING TO FISH
by Bill Kennedy

A character in one of Shakespeare's plays, boasting of his accomplishments
said "I can call up monsters from the vasty deep."  Any fisherman could have
given the answer: "So can I and so can any man, but will they come?"  Men
and women have been calling to fish, pleading with them and swearing at them
without response since the beginning of time.  A federally supported research
project may change that situation.

Working with the whale family (porpoise or dolphin), scientists in Florida
have set out to translate fish language.  They are not far along yet but
have made some headway.  Various clicks and whistles have been recorded
that indicate, at least in the whale family, one fish has a way to commun-
icating what is on his mind to another fish.  If the research continues as
planned, it should be only a matter of time until man will be able to
reporoduce fish noises and communicate what is on his mind to bass, perch,
and catfish.

All right-minded fishermen agree that fish-talk research projects should
be cancelled and the scientists in it forced to seek other employment.
The reasoning behind this point of view is simple and sound.  If the
research continues to its logical conclusion, fishing will cease to be
the pleasant and relaxing sport that it now is.  Fishing will become a
business of bellowing speeches in fish language designed to convince fish
that they would be better off on the bank or in the boat than they are in
the water.  In such circumstances any fool knows who the men that will
catch all the fish will be.  They will be politicians!

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.  This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

Also, as I noted in an earlier joke posting, my office is open Thursday &

A Vaseline salesman is driving through the country, when his car starts
leaking and loses all its oil.  Not knowing what to do, he fills the
engine with Vaseline, thinking that it is similar to oil, and drives away.
It works fine until about half an hour later, when the engine gets real
warm, and the Vaseline melts, and runs out through the same hole as the
oil did.  This time there is a farm nearby, so he decides to look for a 
phone.  

	Meanwhile, inside the farmhouse, the farmer, his wife, and daughter
are having a fight about who's going to do the dishes.  "I did them this
morning," complains the farmer.  "Well I did them at lunch," says his wife.
"And I'm tired from doing all the farmwork," says the daughter.  So the
farmer, in a stroke of brilliance, decides that they will settle it by all
taking off their clothes, lying on the floor, and declaring that the first
one to speak gets to do the dishes.

	The Vaseline saleman gets to the front door, and rings the bell.
No one answers so he goes in and looks for a phone.  He eventually stumbles
into the kitchen, and ignoring the odd sight, asks for a phone.  No one
answers, so he goes and looks some more.  Still no luck, so he goes back to
the kitchen.  They still won't answer, so he decides to see what else he
can get away with.  He has sex with the daughter several times, bemused by
her silence, then finally goes and looks for the phone again.  A while
later, he comes back, looks at the wife, and says, "Why not?"  After having
sex with the farmer's wife, he is getting tired and exasperated.  He
thinks, maybe if they have some Vaseline, I can drive my car for another
half-hour.  So he asks, "Do you have any Vaseline?" at which the farmer
jumps up and yells, "I'll do the dishes!"

   A great Soviet general was once asked by his adjutant, "Comrade General,
what is the meaning of Marxist dialectic?"

   The general replied, "I will explain it to you with an example. A filthy
man is standing outside a bath house. Will he go in?"

   "Of course," replied the adjutant.

   "No, you're wrong," said the general.  "A filthy man is filthy by his nature,
and will not go in to the bath house. Only clean men, knowing the virtues of
cleanliness, will bathe."

   "I understand, comrade general."

   "Now, let me give you another example.  A filthy man is standing outside 
a bath house.  Will he go in?"

   "Absolutely not," replied the adjutant immediately.

   "You're wrong again," said the general.  "Why should a filthy man not
enter a bath house? He is dirty, the bath house is there to enable him to
become clean, and he will use it."

   "I think I understand, comrade."

   "Now, one last example.  A filthy man is standing outside a bath house.
Will he go in?"

   "How the hell should I know?"

   "Now, comrade, you truly understand the meaning of Marxist dialectic."

(This might be an oldie, but I got a grin out of it when I remembered it.)

A fellow sitting in a bar noticed that the bartender was staring at him.
Each time he'd look away and finally came over, a bit embarrassed.

"I'm sorry sir, let me buy you a drink."

He accepted and accepted the subsequent two apologies and drinks.

"Really sir, surely you know this, you must be the ugliest man I've
 ever seen and I can't keep from staring at you."

"You think I'm pretty ugly?  That ugly?  Are you a betting man?"

"Well it depends on what I'm betting on, but I do bet from time to time."

"Do you see that cute little blonde sitting over there with that young
 man?  I've got $50 that says I'll go over there and pick her up."

The bartender accepted immediately, plopping his $50 on the bar next to
the customer's who had started to approach the table but wheeled and
came back.

"I've got another $50 that says that I'll pat her on the fanny as we walk
 by you and she'll give you a wink."

The bartender quickly added another $50 and shortly after that the guy
walked out with the blonde on his arm and as they went by he patted her
on the fanny, she winked at the bartender, and the guy collected the win.

Astonished the bartender went over to the table where she had been
sitting to quiz the young man she had been with, he was sitting there with
a stunned look on his face.

"My gosh fellow, I'm amazed!  What did he do?  What did he say?"

"Nothing!  Nothing at all!  He just stood there; licking his eyebrows..."

replies "Well if we don't, it's going to be bent for the rest of your life."
So finally the guy agrees, and the doctor gets out a couple tongue depressors

A Scotsman was sick and in hospital. His doctors were afraid that
this was to be the end of him since nothing they did could do anything
to make him healthy. His physician asked him if there was anything
that he could do to make him more comfortable in his final hours.
The Scot replied, "If I could only hear the pipes one more time it would
make me very happy." So the doctor arranged for a piper to come into the
room and play for the dying man.

When the Scot heard the pipes the color came back into his cheeks, his
eyes became bright, his breathing was easier, and he got up and danced
around the room. He was completely cured! Later, while recounting the
tale to his fellows over lunch the doctor confessed that this was a
miracle cure that he couldn't explain. When the pipes began to play
the Scotsman was cured. The only problem he could see was that 2
Englishmen in for checkups died.

      Well the young lady was deeply touched and made a collection from her

Tap the power of _random_ selection to increase chances of winning the
lotto!

   Lotto players face a dilemma each time they buy a ticket.  What numbers 
to pick?  Studies have shown that most lotto winners don't use any sort of
special system to select their numbers.  Instead, they tap the power of
_random selection_.

   The Millionaire Maker is a novel, fun way to user random selection to
pick your numbers.  It works just like a state Lotto machine.  A tiny
battery-powered motor under the base rotates the sphere, which holds 80
numbered balls.  Press one button and the sphere mixes the balls thoroughly.
Touch the other and the sphere rotates in the opposite direction...a clever
scooping system lifts a single ball at a time, up and into a sliding tray.

    To return the balls to the sphere simply place them on the filling tray
and tilt it up.  Now you are ready to choose another perfectly random set of
numbers.

    Order Millionaire Maker today, for yourself, or friends who enjoy 
playing Lotto.  _YOU_ night bust the Lotto and be an instant millionaire!

It is with regret that I must say that the controversy over this matter and
the volume of response have blown far out of proportion.  It is my
current belief that an excessive amount of mail directed at the Kitchener-
Waterloo Record can only aggravate the situation.  While I originally set
up an email drop box for letters to the Record, I must ask that people send
no more.

The letters so far have all supported me, and due to the excessive volume,
I would understand if the editors felt the batch were suspect coming from
me.  Because of this, I must ask that any who still require me to forward
their letter send a confirmation.  I regret having to ask this but I truly
feel it is the best course at this time.

If you INSIST, you can do this by replying to this message, which will
mail to rconfirm@looking.UUCP

If you do confirm, you can re-send the text of your letter, or just a
confirmation, in which case I will get it from the "record" mailbox.

You will not hear much, if anything, more from me on this subject.
Thank you all for your kind support.  I know (perhaps more than anybody, now)
how difficult it is to come out in public to defend somebody accused of
racism, or anything like it.  You are all to be applauded.
(Sorry, but mail to me on this topic will not receive a reply.)

A man had to attend a large convention in Chicago.  On this particular
trip he decided to bring his wife.  When they arrived at their
hotel and were shown to their room, the man said:

  "You rest here while I register - I'll be back within an hour."

The wife lies down on the bed... just then, an elevated train passes
by very close to the window and shakes the room so hard she's thrown out
of the bed.

Thinking this must be a freak occurance, she lies down once more.  Again
a train shakes the room so violently, she's pitched to the floor.  Exasperated,
she calls the front desk, asks for the manager. The manager 
says he'll be right up.

The manager (naturally) is skeptical but the wife insists the story is
true.
  "Look,... lie here on the bed -  you'll be thrown right to the floor!".
So he lies down next to the wife... Just then the husband walks in.

  "What", he says, "are you doing here?"

The manager replies: 

  "Would you believe I'm waiting for a train?"
