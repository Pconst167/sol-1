      How to buy a New STEREO.....

-1-
Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc.
Multiply by a factor of 100.

-2-
The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably
blinking and flashing in time with the music.
(NOTE: not the 60's psychedelic kind, but sleek arrays of LEDs)

-3-
The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look
very C00L.

-4-
The system should be broken up into as many components as possible.
(e.g. pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, post-amp, etc.)

-5-
The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should 
look very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers is important.
(e.g. woofers, tweeters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, etc.)

-6-
The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft.

-7-
The system should have full remote control capability, including over the
mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get home.

-8-
Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the
house.

-9-
Components should have a cool names.
(like Nakamichi, Bang & Olufsen, Akai, etc. -- NOT Luxman, Soundesign
or Magnavox)

-10-
The complete set up should put a major recording studio (or large radio
station to shame).

-11-
Having state of the art equiptment is not enough. You should be a year or two
ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete and
should be disposed of promptly.

-12-
The most important factor....
Out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.

=============================================================================

Dear Mr. Jefferson:

We have read your 'Declaration of Independence' with great interest.
Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your
statements do merit serious consideration. Unfortunately, the Declaration as a
whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to the Crown,
so we must return the document to you for further refinement. The questions
which follow might assist you in your process of revision:

 1.     In your opening paragraph you use the phrase 'the Laws of Nature and
        Nature's God.' What are these laws? In what way are they the criteria
        on which you base your central arguments? Please document with
        citations from the recent literature.

 2.     In the same paragraph you refer to the 'opinions of mankind.' Whose
        polling data are you using? Without specific evidence, it seems to
        us the 'opinions of mankind' are a matter of opinion.

 3.     You hold certain truths to be 'self-evident.' Could you please
        elaborate. If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be
        difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.

 4.     'Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' seem to be the goals of
        your proposal. These are not measurable goals. If you were to say that
        'among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in
        six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers
        in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to
        raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next
        10 years,' these could be measureable goals. Please clarify.

 5.     You state that 'Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
        these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
        and to institute a new Government....' Have you weighed this assertion
        against all the alternatives? What are the trade-off considerations?

 6.     Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive. Such a
        long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not
        follow it. Your problem statement needs improvement.

 7.     Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all. You
        state that the colonies 'ought to be Free and Independent States,' and
        that they are 'Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown.' Who
        or what must change to achieve this objective? In what way must they
        change? What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance?
        How long will it take? We have found that a little foresight in these
        areas helps to prevent careless errors later on. How cost-effective are
        your stategies?

 8.     Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing
        your strategy? Who conceived it? Who provided the theoretical research?
        Who will constite the advisory committee? Please submit an organization
        chart and vitas of the principal investigators.

 9.     You must include an evaluation design. We have been requiring this
        since Queen Anne's War.

 10.    What impact will your problem have? Your failure to include any
        assesment of this inspires little confidence in the long-range
        prospects of your undertaking.

 11.    Please submit a PERT diagram, an activity chart, itemized budget, and
        manpower utilization matrix.

We hope that these comments prove useful in revising your 'Declaration of
Independence.' We welcome the submission of your revised proposal. Our due date
for unsolicited proposals is July 31, 1776. Ten copies with original signatures
will be required.

Signed:         Management Analyst to the British Crown

                O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion
                [Quoted without permission from Jun '80 Esquire]

I.      Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made
        aware of its situation.
                Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.
                He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he
                chances to look down.  At this point, the familiar principle
                of 32 feet per second per second takes over.

II.     Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
        intervenes suddenly.
                Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon
                characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a
                telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward
                motion absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden
                termination of motion the stooge's surcease.

III.    Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
        conforming to its perimeter.
                Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
                speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of
                reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit
                directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-
                perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often
                catalyzes this reaction.

IV.     The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater
        than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the
        ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.
                Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture
                it inevitably unsuccessful.

V.      All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
                Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to
                propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky
                noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion
                upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or
                the crewst of a flagpole.  The feet of a character who is
                running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch
                the ground, especially when in flight.

VI.     As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
                This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in
                which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the
                cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously.  This
                effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or
                being throttled.  A "wacky" character has the option of self-
                replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off
                walls to achieve the velocity required.

VII.    Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble
        tunnel entrances; others cannot.
                This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generation, but
                at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a
                wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue
                him into this theoretical space.  The painter is flattened
                against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting.
                This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.

VIII.   Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.
                Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional
                nine lives might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated,
                spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled,
                but they cannot be destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking
                self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.

IX.     For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.
                This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also
                applies to the physical world at large.  For that reason,
                we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.



Q: What is the speed limit of sex?
A:68, because at 69 you eat it!!
               (raucous laughter)

A certain English earl received word of a new Crusade, and decided to go
into the Holy Land to fight the heathen. So, he got his lands in order,
assigned lesser nobles to run his lands, and got his men all armed and ready
for battle.

Immediately before he left, he turned to his old, trusted steward.
"Phillip," he told him. "Of all my subjects, it is you that I trust the
most. I am leaving with you all my possesions, my gold, and my home; I know
that you will keep them well.  I am also leaving you this."

He handed the steward a small key.

"This is the key to my wife's chastity belt. If, God forbid, I am killed in
the Holy Land, and never return, I charge you to free my wife, that she
might marry again." And so the earl left.

As he and his troops were galloping of to meet the ship that would take them
to Palestine, the watchman at the end of the group cried: "Ho! A rider!"

The earl halted his troops, and they saw the rider, riding as though the
very devil was behind him. As he got nearer, he could see it was his
steward, shouting frantically at him. "Sire! Sire! Wrong key!"

One day, the aged magician Merlin brought Arthur into his workshop to see
his latest invention.

"It is a chastity belt, your highness"

Arthur was not amused. "Are you mad, Merlin? That belt has a hole in it the
size of my arm!"

Merlin only smiled, and picked up a large carrot off the table. As he
started to insert it into the hole, a razor-sharp blade VSSHED out, slicing
off the it's top.

"Wonderful, Merlin! Now I can go to battle in complete security!" And so he
did.

After returning from battle, Arthur called together all of his knights for
an inspection, and told them all to drop their pants. As he walked up and
down the line, he saw that all of them had seriously slashed and bloodied
penis caps--all except Launcelot.

Impressed, Arthur brought Launcelot to the front of the room, and spoke to
his knights. "Of you all," he told them. "Only Launcelot was able to resist
temptation. Launcelot! Tell us how you resisted!"

Launcelot stood before the crowd. "Thh mnd thve blhnn!"

"I am writing in response to your reqest for additional information in
block number three of the accident-reporting form.  I put "poor
planning" as the cause of my accident.  You said in your letter that I
should explain more fully, and I trust that the following details will
be sufficient.  I am an amateur radio operator.  On the day of the
accident I was working alone on the top section of my new 80 foot tower,
when I completed my work, I discovered that I had, over the course of
several trips up the tower, brought up about 300 lbs of tools and
spare hardware.  Rather than carry the now unneeded tools and material
down by hand, I decided to lower the items down in a small barrel by
using a pulley, which fortunately was attached to the gin pole at the
top of the tower."

"Securing the rope at ground level, I went to the top of the tower and
loaded the tools and materials into the barrel.  Then I wentback to the
ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent
of the 300 lbs of tools.  You will note in block #11 of the accident-
reporting form that I weigh only 155 lbs."

"Due to my suprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost
my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.  Needless to say,
I proceeded at a rather rapid rate of speed up the side of the tower.
In the vicinity of the 40 foot level, I met the barrel coming down.
This explains my fractured skull and broken collarbone.  Slowed only
slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers
of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley."

"Fortunately, by this time, I had regained my presence of mind and
was able to hold on to the rope in spite of my pain.  At approximat-
ely the same time, however, the barrel of tools hit the ground and
the bottom fell out of the barrel.  Devoid of the weight of the tools,
the barrel now weighed approximately 20 lbs.  I refer you again to my
weight in block #11.  As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent
down the side of the tower.  In the vicinity of the 40 foot level, I
met the barrel coming up, this accounts for the two fractured ankles
and the lacerations of my legs and lower body."

"The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries
when I fell onto the pole of tools and fortunately, only three
vertabrae were cracked.  I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay
there on the tools in pain, unable to stand and watching the empty
barrel 80 feet above me...I again lost my presence of mind...I let
go of the rope."

A small band of Trids lived on a peninsula connected to the mainland only by
a narrow strip of land. Each day the Trids would walk across the strip and
get their food and other stuff.

One day, a fearsome Gloglum monster sat right down on that narrow strip
of land. Whenever a Trid tries to get past, the Gloglum monster would boot
him straight back to the Peninsula. Soon, the Trids were on the brink of
starvation.

A rabbi in town heard of their troubles, and decided to bring food to the
Trids. Each day he'd cross the narrow strip of land with provisions and
return, and the Gloglum monster paid him no mind.

Finally, the rabbi asked why he could go back and forth, but the Trids
couldn't. The Gloglum monster laughed, and said, "Silly rabbi! Kicks are for
Trids!"

"Hispanic oriented ads lose in the translation"

San Antonio (AP) -- More companies are trying to reach the Hispanic market
through advertising and some of their efforts have resulted in emabarrassing
errors, a marketing expert says.

Marketers have only a limited understanding of Hispanic culture and language,
according to Humberto Valencia, assistant professor of marketing at
Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

For example, a beer company translated its "turn it loose" slogan into
Spanish learned to late that the message to Spanish-speaking consumers
had become "Our beer causes diarrhea."

A pet-food manufacturer tried the humorous approach, but once again the
message was lost in translation, he said.  The situation depicted a certain
feline as having died eight times and, if he did not eat this particular
cat food, he was going to die for the ninth and final time.  The language
used was correct, but the agency failed to realize one major difference:
in Latin folk culture, cats have only seven lives.  The commercial bombed.

A telephone company ran a campaign depicting a woman telling her husband
to "run downstairs and phone Maria to tell her we'll be a little late."

Again, culture was not taken into account.  In the Hispanic home, Valencia
said, seldome does a woman give her husband orders.  And rarely will a
family call to say they will be late.  It is customary to arrive late, he
said.

A chicken company had one of its slogans translated too literally.  The
ad in English said, "It takes a tough man to make a chicken tender."
The slogan was understood in Spanish as, "It makes a sexually excited
man to make a chick sensual."

A beer company used the wrong gender in one of its campaigns.  Beer, cerveza,
is a feminine noun in Spanish and should have been labeled the "queen"
rather than the "king" of beers.

A cigarette advertisement claimed that it had "less asphalt" rather than
less tar, he said, and a beer company found out that its ad was being
sung incorrectly in the Spanish media.  The company's "less filling,
delicious" claim came across as "filling, less delicious."

Some brand names attract the wrong kind of attention, the Chevrolet Nova
story being perhaps the best known example.  What Spanish speaker would want
a car that means "no go?"

Some ads contain subtle, non-verbal details that can disturb a particular
subgroup.

A commercial for a beer company, which used San Antonio's River Walk as a
backdrop, was well-received among West Coast Hispanics who enjoyed the
Spanish flavor, Valencia said.

Ironically, San Antonio's own Hispanics did not relate well, he said,
because they felt the "Paseo del Rio" was more for Anlgo tourists than for
Hispanic residents.

            IMB (Nukesbury) Product Announcement

                "Amuses Industry, Analysts"

IMB announced its long-awaited Tolkien Ring  Network  today.
In  an  informal and unauthorized interview with the product
manager, G. Gray, we extracted  the  following  information.
(Sodium  Pentathol  --  the "standard"  of  the  electronics
industry's journalists, has proved to be less effective than
simple,  old-fashioned  methods,  the more old-fashioned the
better.   We only  wish that Mr. Gray's heart  condition had
been noted on his dossier).


 Q. Why did IMB pick Tolkien ring over one of  the  more
    proven technologies like eth*rnet?

 A. It seemed like a good idea at the time.   We  didn't
    like  any  of  the  standards out there, so we said,
    "What the hell, let's make our own", and we did.

 Q. How do you prevent duplicate tokens?

 A. We don't really care.

 Q. How do you pick host IDs?

 A. Each host is assigned a 256-bit random number.   The
    likelyhood of a duplication is astronomically small,
    on the order of your mother-in-law  leaving  without
    having been asked to.

 Q. What would a typical tolkien ring installation  con-
    sist of?

 A. Three Rings for the elven kings under the sky,
    Seven for the Dwarf lords in their halls of stone,
    Nine for Mortal men doomed to die,
    One for the Dark lord on his dark throne
    In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.
        One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
        One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness
            bind them
    In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.

 Q. Do you expect any opposition to the tolkien ring es-
    tablishment?

 A. Our experience has been that potential users can  be
    dealt with quite easily if you use a little imagina-
    tion.  Hot wax works well.  So does COBOL.   Manage-
    ment  should pick out the troublemakers early on and
    kill them as soon as possible.

 Q. Has your mother-in-law left yet?

 A. No.  Most users report that it will be a cold day in
    hell  before that token comes around the ring again.
    Usually they have to find it with a  flashlight,  or
    flush it out of the basement with smoke.  Tokens are
    heavy, and they tend to get stuck where  the  cables
    dip or rise suddenly.

 Q. What about network security?

 A. We surgically alter users and  take  their  families
    hostage.   This  is a major breakthrough in security
    technology, and we are considering using it on other
    fronts, such as in our lobbying techniques.

 Q. What enhancements to the Tolkien ring network do you
    expect to make in the near future?

 A. Our Miami research center is reportedly  working  on
    something  they  call  a  `Drug' ring, but what that
    really is is anyone's guess.   The  Colorado  people
    are  experimenting  with  anti-tokens, more commonly
    called "hot potatoes", which cause system crashes if
    they  are  held  too long -- great incentive to make
    the network work as fast as possible.  And we  can't
    understand  what  the  California people are working
    on, since too many of them took est.

 Q. What other exciting, new technologies will  IMB  re-
    veal in the next year?

 A. Look for us to be very aggressive in  microprocessor
    and  memory devices.  I shouldn't tell you this, but
    next month we will be announcing a RISC with a 1 GIP
    instruction-fetch  rate,  a 16 or 17 megabit dynamic
    RAM for twelve  cents,  an  artificial  intelligence
    that  will  run  for  president, and a revolutionary
    sexual position that actually cures herpes.

 Q. Thank you Mr. Gray.

    out...).

2. "I was in  [fill in lesser-developed country of choice]  the
other week, and I had to get to the airport in a hurry,
so I hailed a taxi.  Well, I must say, the driver was insane!
Not three minutes after I hailed him, he ran a red light.
I yelled out, 'Hey, you just ran a red light!' (My tendency
to bespeak the obvious undoubtedly was quite poignantly received.)
He simply replied, 'Yes, I know, but don't worry -- my brother
taught me to drive, so everything is okay.'
"Then, not two blocks later, he stopped at the intersection -- and
the light was green!  So I said, 'Why have you stopped?  The
light is green!' And he said, 'I know, I'm just checking to see
if my brother's coming.'"

And, in the real life humour (sic) section, I offer the following
TRUE story -- this happened to a speech coach at the High School
I went to:
 
3. For some reason, Trans-World Airlines [whatever] was selling T-shirts
to celebrate their n-millionth crossing of the Atlantic or the
Pacific or the dead sea or whatever they were crossing.  Anyway, the
T-shirt they were selling was only $3.00 and the speech coach
in question hadn't taken enough luggage along, so, she purchased one of
these T-shirts.

It was green, and written across the entire surface of the shirt was
the acronym for Trans-World.

You tell me what you see in it:

     IMPURE MATHEMATICS
     
     Wherein it is related how  that polygon of womanly virtue
  young ** Polly Nomial ** (our  heroine)  is accosted by that
  notorious villain %% Curly Pi %%, and factored (Oh Horror!).
     
     Once upon a time (1/t)  pretty Polly Nomial was strolling
  across  a field  of  vectors when  she  came  across to  the
  boundary  of  a  singularly large  matrix.   Now  Polly  was
  convergent  and  her  mother  had it  made  it  an  absolute
  condition that  she never  enter such  an array  without her
  brackets on.  Polly, however,  who had changed her variables
  that  morning and  was feeling  particularly badly  behaved,
  ignored   this  condition   on  the   basis   that  it   was
  insufficient, and made her way amongst the complex elements.
  Rows  and  columns  closed  in  from  all  sides.   Tangents
  approached her surface. She became tensor and tensor.  Quite
  suddenly,   two branches  of a  hyperbola touched  her at  a
  single  point.  She  oscillated  violently,   lost sense  of
  directrix,  and went completely divergent.  As she reached a
  turning  point,  she  tripped over  a square  root that  was
  protruding  from a  erf and  plunged headlong  down a  steep
  gradient.  When she rounded off once more, and found herself
  inverted, apparently alone, in a non-euclidean space.
     
     She was watched, however. That smooth operator, Curly Pi,
  was  lurking   innerproduct.   As  his  eyes   devoured  her
  curvilinear coordinates,  a singular  expression crossed his
  face. He wondered, was she still convergent ?  He decided to
  integrate  improperly at  once.  Hearing  a common  fraction
  behind her,  Polly rotated and saw Curly Pi approaching with
  his power series extrapolated.  She could see at once by his
  degenerate conic and  dissipative terms that he  was bent on
  no good.
     
         "Arcsinh !" she gasped.
         "Ho, ho," he said. "What a symmetric little asymptote
  you have. I can see you angles have a lot of secs."
         "Oh sir,   " she protested,   "Keep away from  me,  I
  haven't got my brackets on."
         "Calm yourself,   my dear," said our  suave operator,
  "Your fears are purely imaginary."
         "I,  i,  " She thought,  "perhaps he's not normal but
  homologous."
         "What order are you ? " the brute demanded.
         "Seventeen,"  replied  Polly.   Curly  leered.   "  I
  suppose you've never been operated on."
         "Of course not, " Polly replied quite properly, " I'm
  absolutely convergent."
         "Come, come," said Curly Pi. " Let's off to a decimal
  place I know and I'll take you to the limit."
         " Never!" gasped Polly.
         " Abscissa!   " he swore,   using the vilest  oath he
  knew.   His  patience  was  gone.    Coshing  her  over  the
  coefficient  with a  log  until  she was  powerless,   Curly
  removed her  discontinuities.  He stared at  her significant
  places,  and begin  smoothing out her points  of inflection.
  Poor Polly.  The algorithmic method  was her only hope.  She
  felt  his his  hand tending  to her  asymptotic limit.   Her
  convergence would soon be gone forever.
     
     There was no mercy,  for  Curly was a heaviside operator.
  Curly's radius  squared itself;  Polly's loci  quivered.  He
  integrated by  parts.   He integrated by  partial fractions.
  After he cofactored,  he performed  Runge-Kutta on her.  The
  complex beast even went all the way around and did a contour
  integration.  Curly went on operating until he satisfied her
  hypothesis,   then he  exponentiated  and became  completely
  orthogonal.
     
     When Polly got home that  night,  her mother noticed that
  she no longer piecewise continuous,   but had been truncated
  in several places. But it was too late to differentiate now.
  As   months   went  by,    Polly's   denominator   increased
  monotonically. Finally she went to L' Hospital and generated
  a small but pathological function  which left surds all over
  the place and drove Polly to deviation.
     
     The moral of our sad story is this:
     
     If you want  to keep your expressions  convergent,  never
  allow them a single degree of freedom.....

"Wrapped barbed wire around it."

"Not yet, but it sure slows her down."
