A man and a woman are driving home from a date.  The man stops the car,
and the woman says:  "Oh no, you aren't going to pull the "out of gas"
routine!"

The man says, "No, it's the "hereafter" routine.  If you're not here after
what I'm here after, then you're going to be here after I'm gone."

Anyway, Amos is getting on in years and his family decides that he is
just too much of a burden anymore.  Time to put him in a retirement
home.  So they take him out to Sunny Hills Retirement Community and
install him in his now home.

After he was there for a few hours, a lovely young nurse comes and
asks if he would like to spend a while on the sun porch.  Amos says
"Sure...hrmmmph, hrmmmph."

So Amos and the nurse are on the sun porch enjoying the sun, when Amos
begins to lean to his left.  The nurse, thinking that he is going to
fall, pushes him back upright.  A few minutes pass, and Amos again
begins to lean, this time to his right.  The nurse pushes him back
upright.  A few minutes later the scene is repeated.  Finally, the
nurse takes Amos back to his room.

The next day, Amos's friend Bob comes to visit.  "How do you like it
here?" asks Bob.

"Well" says Amos "it's OK, I guess.  The bed ain't too soft and it ain't
too hard.  The food is OK.  The people are nice.  But, they sure don't 
want you to fart on the sun porch!"

speech.  Churchill, with his usual enthusiasm for his rival, dozed off while
the lady was speaking.  She stopped her speech and awoke Sir Winston by

replied, "No, ma'am.  I do so purely by choice."

A man walks into the psychiatrist's office with a pancake on his head, 
fried eggs on each shoulder, and a strip of bacon over each ear. The shrink,

plans."

Three women are having lunch, discussing their husbands.

The first says, "My husband is cheating on me, I just know it.  I found
a pair of stockings in his jacket pocket, and they weren't mine!"

a condom in his wallet, so I poked it full of holes with my sewing needle!"

The following is a courtroom exchange between a defense attorney and
a farmer with a bodily injury claim.  It came from a Houston, Texas
insurance agent.


Attorney: "At the scene of the accident, did you tell the constable
you had never felt better in your life?"

Farmer: "That's right."

Attorney: "Well, then, how is it that you are now claiming you were
seriously injured when my client's auto hit your wagon?"

Farmer: "When the constable arrived, he went over to my horse, who
had a broken leg, and shot him.  Then he went over to Rover, my dog,
who was all banged up, and shot him.  When he asked me how I felt, I
just thought under the circumstances, it was a wise choice of words
to say I've never felt better in my life."

Supposedly a true story...

   Scene:  A court room in Oklahoma where a person is on trial for murder.
There is strong evidence indicating guilt; however, there is no corpse.
   In the defense's closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client is
guilty and that it looks like he'll probably be convicted, resorts to a clever
trick.
   "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all," the lawyer
says as he looks at his watch.  "Within 1 minute, the person presumed dead in
this case will walk into this court room," he says and he looks toward the
courtroom door.  The jury, somewhat stunned, all look on eagerly.  A minute
passes.  Nothing happens.
   Finally the lawyer says:  "Actually, I made up the previous statement.  But
you all looked on with anticipation.  I, therefore, put it to you that there is
reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that
you return a verdict of not guilty."
   The jury, clearly confused, retires to deliberate.
   A few minutes later, the jury returns and a representative pronounces a
verdict of guilty.
   "But how?" inquires the lawyer.  "You must have had some doubt; I saw all of
you stare at the door."
   Answers the representative:  "Oh, we did look.  But your client didn't."

Three squaws were each preparing for the birth of their first child.  The
first squaw placed a large bear hide by a river, the second squaw placed
an elk hide by a tree by a river, and the third squaw placed a
hippopotamus hide by a path, near the river and the tree so that the
three formed a triangle.
   It just so happens that all three women gave birth on the same day.
The first squaw on the bear hide had a 5-lb son, the second squaw on the
elk hide had a 6-lb son, and the third squaw on the hippopotamus hide had
an 11-lb son.
   To this day, mathematicians credit these three women with the first
proof of the Pythagorean Theorem:

   "The son of the squaw of the hippopotamus is equal to the sons
    of the squaws of the two adjacent hides."

	Freddy Fish and Sam Clam were the best of friends, and did
  everything together.  One day, though, both perished in a freak
  mishap.  Freddy Fish went to heaven, and immediately looked 
  around for his best friend.  Not finding him, he asked St.
  Peter where Sam was.
	"Sorry, he didn't make it in."
	"You mean he's down there?" asked Freddy.
	"Yes."
	"Well, I want to go see him!"
	"This is highly unorthodox," said St. Peter.  "I'll ask the
  big guy."
	Moments later St. Peter returned and said:
	"You can go, but you can only stay for one hour."
	"Great!" said Freddy, and grabbed his harp before anyone
  changed their minds.  He went to the elevator, and went down.

	When the elevator doors opened, Freddy saw a huge sign:

			SAM'S DISCOTHEQUE

	He went in, and discovered that it was run by his old friend.
  They sat down and reminisced about old times, and had a few drinks.
  Time flew by, and when Freddy noticed his watch, he saw that he had
  fifteen seconds left to return.  He jumped out of his chair, yelled
  a goodbye to Sam Clam, and raced to the elevator.

	The elevator doors opened in heaven with only one second to
  spare.  St. Peter was standing there with a stopwatch.
	"You just barely made it," said St. Peter.
	"I know," panted Freddy, out of breath.  "But I have to go
  back there!"
	"What do you mean!?!" asked an incredulous St. Peter.

	So Freddy Fich says (* groan *):
	"I left my harp in Sam Clam's Disco!"

An American is visiting in France for several weeks.  As his stay nears an
end, he is sitting around with three of his new-found French friends, just
generally shooting the breeze.  The subject turns to language, and the
American says, "Guys, I do have one question left.  I keep hearing this
expression, "sang froid".  What does it mean?  I know that it literally
means, "cold blood", but what does it *mean*?"

The first Frenchman replies, "Ah, zat is easy.  Say that a man walks into
his bedroom, only to find his wife in bed with his best friend.  If he can
turn around and walk out without them knowing he was evair zere, *zat* is
sang froid!"

The second Frenchman interjected, "You have eet all wrong!  If, in zis
circumstance, zee gentleman can calmly stand zere, and say "Please don't
mind me; continue", zen *zat* is sang froid!"

"Non, non, non!" burst out the third.  "If ze gentleman bursts een on his
wife and his best friend, stands there saying, "Please continue", and his
friend *can* continue, *zat* is sang froid!".

	One day while the circus was in town, a lion escaped
  from its cage.  He went downtown into a local bar, and said
  to the bartender, "You see that young girl at the end of 
  the bar?  If you don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat
  her up."
	The bartender hastily poured a beer and watched the
  lion swig it down and leave.
	The lion proceeded across the street to another bar.
  Again he approached the bar, and spoke to the bartender.
	"You see that girl at the end of the bar?  If you
  don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat her up."
	The bartender hastily poured the lion a beer, and
  watched as the lion gulped it down and left.
	The lion proceeded to yet another bar, went inside,
  and said to the bartender:
	"You see that young girl at the end of the bar?  If
  you don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat her up."

	"Go ahead," said the bartender.
	So the lion went to the girl and ate her, quick as 
  a wink.
	"Now give me a beer, or I'll eat YOU up!" the lion
  roard to the bartender.
	"No you won't.  in a couple of minutes, you'll be
  out cold on the floor," said the bartender calmly.
	"Why's that?" asked the lion.
	"That wasn't an ordinary girl you ate, you dumb
  lion.  That was a bar-bitch-uate!!"

There was this 22-year old secretary vacationing in Tampa.  However,
as she walked along the beach eyeing the big-bosomed girls walking 
arm-in-arm with their boyfriends, she became distraught, for she had
a rather insignificant pair of hooters.  Suddenly, she espied a murky
old bottle that had washed up on the beach, and for want of alternative
amusement, picked it up.

Poof!  Out emerged a genie, complete with flowing oriental robes who
immediately offered to grant her any two wishes that she desired.

"Then, give me two of the biggest boobs in the whole, wide world", she
moaned.

Poof!!  Poof!!  Immediately there emerged before her eyes, two huge boobs -
Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese!

A young man is on a date with a young woman and they go parking. 
After some heavy petting the young man asks the young woman for oral
sex. "No", says the young woman, "you won't respect me."  So the 
young man is content to wait.  

After they had been dating a few months, the young man again asks the
young woman for oral sex.  Again she replies, "No, you won't respect me."

Eventually the two get married and the husband asks his bride
"Honey, please, we're married now.  You know I love you and respect
you.  Can we please have oral sex?". "No", she says "I just know
that if I do that you won't respect me."  So the man waits.

and waits... 

and waits....

After 20 years of marriage the man says, "Honey, we've been together
20 wonderful years now.  We've raised three beautiful kids.  You
KNOW that I love you and respect you completely.  How about oral sex, 
just once????  Please??????" and the wife finally gives in to her 
husband's wish and peforms oral sex on him.  After she is done they
are lying in bed relaxing and the telephone rings.  The husband turns 
to his wife and says, "Answer that you cocksucker."

Three women are being interviewed for the same secretarial job.  The final
question of each interview is, "If you were accidentally overpaid $100 one
week, what would you do?".  The first woman says, "Oh, I would immediately
report it, Sir!".  The second woman says, "Well, I would write a memo to
payroll, but make it `low priority'."  The third woman says, "Well, Sir,
in all honesty, I would keep the money and but myself a new outfit."

So who gets the job?

The one with the biggest tits!

squad awaiting execution.  The American is first.  He points behind the

An Italian and his two Polish friends drank at the same bar every night
after work.  One evening, the Italian keels over and dies.  Well, the cops
come and are filling out the report and one of them asks the Polacks,
"Did your friend have any distinguishing marks?"  One of the Polacks says,
"I'll say he did!  He had two assholes!"  The cop says, "Sure, and how
would you know a thing like that?"  The Polack replies, "Because every
night when we come in, the bartender says, `Here comes the Italian with
the two assholes!'"

An elderly couple went into a doctor.  They told the doctor "We're having
some touble with our sex life.  Could you watch and offer some suggestions?"

The doctor replied, "I'm not a sex theripist.  You should find someone else."

The couple said, "No, No, we trust you."

After watching them have sex, the doctor said, "You don't seam to be having
any troubles.  I wish my sex life was as good.  I can't give you any 
suggestions."

This was repeated the next week and also the third week.  After they had
finished on the third week, the doctor said, "You aren't having any trouble. 
Is this your idea of kinky sex?"

The man replied, "No, actually the problem is if we have sex at my house, my
wife will catch us.  If we have sex at her house, her husband will catch us. 
The motel charges us $50, and we can't afford that.  You only charge $35, and
medicare pays half of that."

     For three years, the young attorney had been taking his brief
vacations at this country inn.  The last time he'd finally managed
an affair with the innkeeper's daughter.  Looking forward to an
exciting few days, he dragged his suitcase up the stairs of the inn,
then stopped short.  There sat his lover with an infant on her lap!
     "Helen, why didn't you write when you learned you were pregnant?" 
he cried.  "I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married,
and the baby would have my name!"
     "Well," she said, "when my folks found out about my condition, we
sat up all night talkin' and talkin' and decided it would be better
to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."

Three women are sunning themselves on the beach, one catholic, one
protestant, and one JAP (Jewish American Princess).  Suddenly, a man 
runs by wearing nothing but a paper bag over his head.  When he has
passed, the women look at each other self-conciously.

The catholic says, "At least it wasn't my husband"
The protestant says, "At least it wasn't my boyfriend"
The JAP says, "Why, he wasn't even a member of the country club"

    There's an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician and they
are all attending a convention at some hotel.  A fire breaks out
when everyone is asleep.  The engineer wakes up, smells the smoke,
gets up, runs out into the hallway, runs to the nearest firehose,
and douses the entire room with water.  All of the engineer's
possesions were wet, but at least he was safe.
    The physicist wakes up, smells the smoke, whips out pencil
and paper, writes a few equations down, then rushes into the bathroom
to fill a cup of water, and then throws the cup of water in the
exact spot in the room to douse all the flames.
    The mathematician wakes up, smells the smoke, thinks for a minute,
then rushes into the bathroom, fills a cup of water, lights a match,
sticks the match in the cup.  Seeing that flame was extinguished,
the mathematician proclaims, "Ah!  A solution exists."  Then he
goes back to sleep.

    Three men are in a hot-air balloon.  Soon, they find themselves
lost in a canyon somewhere.  One of the three men says, "I've got an
idea.  We can call for help in this canyon and the echo will carry
our voices far."
    So he leans over the basket and yells out, "Helllloooooo!
Where are we?" (They hear the echo several times).
    15 minutes later, they hear this echoing voice: "Helllloooooo!
You're lost!!"
    One of the men says, "That must have been a mathematician."
    Puzzled, one of the other men asks, "Why do you say that?"
    The reply: "For three reasons.  (1) he took a long time to
answer, (2) he was absolutely correct, and (3) his answer was
absolutely useless."

    An engineer and a mathematician are in a room with one door.  Both
of them are asked (one at a time) to go into the next room, where they
will find a pot of water and a stove, and boil the pot of water.
The engineer goes into the next room, sees the pot of water sitting
on a table, puts it on the stove, turns on the stove, and waits until
it boils.  A little bit later (the room is reset for the mathematician),
the mathematician goes into the next room, sees the pot sitting on
the table, puts it on the stove, turns on the stove, and waits until
it boils.
    Now both of them are asked to do this again.  However, this time the
pot of water is on the floor.  The engineer sees the pot of water on
the floor, puts it on the stove, and waits until it boils.  The
mathematician, however, sees the pot of water on the floor, puts it
on the table and proclaims, "I've solved this problem already."

Arthur was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and
generally feeling good about himself, when a nun suddenly appears at his
table and starts decrying the evils of drink.

"You should be ashamed of yourself young man!  Drinking is a Sin!  Alcohol
is the blood of the devil!"

Now Arthur gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive.
"How do *you* know, Sister?"

"My Mother Superior told me so"

"But have you ever had a drink yourself?  How can you be sure that what you
are saying is right?"

"Don't be ridiculous - of course I have never taken alcohol myself"

"Then let me buy you a drink - if you still believe afterwards that it is
evil I will give up drink for life"

"How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!"

"I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, them no-one will know"

The Nun reluctantly agrees, so Arthur goes inside to the bar.

"Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks", then he lowers his
voice and says to the barman "... and could you put the vodka in a teacup?"

"Oh no!  It's not that bloody Nun again is it?"

thus 0.08.  So it takes about 12.5 light bulb jokes to change a

  An American tourist went into a restaurant in a Spanish provincial
city for dinner, and asked to be served the specialty of the house.
When the dish arrived, he asked what kind of meat it contained.

  "Sir, these are the COJONES", the waiter replied.
  "The what, you say?", exclaimed the tourist.
  "They are testicles of the bull killed in the ring today," explained
the waiter.

  The tourist gulped but tasted the plate anyway, and found it delicious.
Returning the following evening, he asked for the same dish.  After he
finished the meal, the tourist commented to the waiter:
  "Today's COJONES are much smaller than the ones I had yesterday."
  "True, sir," said the waiter, "... you see the bull, he does not
always lose!"

	There once was a race of smurf-like creatures called "Trids".
The Trids were happy, peaceful, folks, who lived in a village at the
base of a mountain.  Part of their culture was an annual ceremony, in
which the whole population would go up to the top of the mountain for
a grand celebration.  On the way to the mountaintop there was a river
that they had to cross, and a single bridge was the only way across.

	One year, as the annual trek was underway, the Trids came to
the bridge only to discover a huge troll sitting in the middle of the
bridge, blocking the path.  One of the Trids was brave enough to step
onto the bridge and walk up to the troll, attempting to pass by.  But
as he got near, the troll picked up the Trid, and drop-kicked him,
sending him rolling down the mountainside back toward the Trid
village.  Another Trid attempted to cross the bridge, but was met
with the same reaction from the Troll, and went rolling down the hill
after the Troll kicked him.

	As a third Trid walked onto the bridge, a Rabbi happened to be
walking along the riverside, just in time to see the Trid get kicked
into the air and roll down the mountain.  Outraged, the Rabbi stomped
up onto the bridge and began walking toward the troll.  As he got
near, the troll stood to one side, allowing the Rabbi room to pass.
The Rabbi was very surprised at this, and asked the Troll, "Why are
you kicking the Trids when they attempt to use this bridge, but you
let me pass?".  And the troll replied:

	"Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!"

America, Russia and Japan are sending up a two year shuttle mission with one
astronaut from each country.  Since it's going to be two years up there, each
may take any form of entertainment weighing 150 pound or less.

150 lbs of books to learn Greek with."  The NASA board approves.

Everyone wondered how Reagan picked Bush for VP in the first place.
Well, this is the story:  Reagan knew he had to make a choice; so
he asked Nancy how he should do this.  Nancy told him that he should
ask the potential candidates a riddle and see how they do.  She gave
Reagan a riddle to use.

So, the next day, Reagan goes to Bush and says, "Who is it who is your
father's son, but not your brother?"  Bush replies, "Golly gee, Mr. Reagan,
That's difficult.  I'll need to go and think about that one for a while."
In the evening Bush returns and happily shouts, "I got it, Ron!  I figured
it out!  It's me!  It's me!"

Reagan than goes and presents the same riddle to one of the other VP
candidates and says, "Who is it who is your father's son, but not your
brother?"  "That's a tough one Mr. Reagan.  I'll get back to you on that."
And in the evening he returns and says, "I couldn't figure that one out.
Who is it?"

Reagan answers, "It's George Bush, but I'm not exactly sure why."

This fellow had been suffering from excruciating headaches for some
time, and finally went to a doctor.  After a thorough exam, the 
physician called the fellow into his office and said, "Well, I'm not 
exactly sure what is causing your headaches, but we've found a cure
for them:  you'll have to be castrated".  The man, needless to say, was
taken aback, and told his doctor that he believed he would try to bear
the pain.

But as time went on, the headaches only got worse, and finally, the
poor fellow was driven back to the doctor.  "All right, I guess I'll
have the operation", he said.  When it was all over, the man was 
understandably depressed, and his physician told him, "I recommend you
begin life anew - start over from this point".

So the man decided to take the advice and went to a men's shop for a
new set of clothes.  The proprietor said, "Starting with the suit, 
looks like you take about a 38-regular".  "That's right", exclaimed the 
man, "how'd you know?"  "Well, when you've been in the business
as long as I have, you get pretty good at sizing a man up", 
replied the salesman.  "Now, for a shirt, looks like about a 15 long."
"Right again," the man said.  The proprietor suggested, "And for
undershorts, I'd say a size 36."  "There's your first mistake", the
man said, "I've worn 34's for years."  "No, you're a size 36 if I've
ever seen one", said the owner.  The man replied, "I ought to know
what size undershorts I wear, and I'll take 34".  The owner replied,
"Well alright, if you insist, but they're going to pinch your balls
and give you headaches!"

80 years after Little Big Horn, an East Coast journalist began research
on George Armstrong Custer.  A friend told him that an Indian that lived
through that experience was still living and furthermore remembered EVERY
event of his long life.  The journalist visited Chief Big Eagle, who now
lived in a small town in Pennsylvania.  When he arrived and stated his purpose,
the Chief agreed to answer his questions.

"On what day of the week did the event take place? "
-- "Wednesday"

"What was Custer wearing?"
-- "Black uniform ... ceremonial sword ... old hat"

"what did Custer eat for breakfast?"
-- "Eggs"

The journalist was skeptical and figured anyone could make up these answers.
He left, and never published his article.

Ten years later, the journalist was by coincidence driving through the same 
small town, and decided to see if the old Chief was still living.  To his

There was this black woman who had 7 sons, all of them named Leroy.
One day this man was asking her about this and said, "What to you say
when you want to call one of them?"  She replies,"I just calls Leroy,
and they all come!"  The man then says, "Well what if you want one of
them to come help you with the dishes?"  She says, "I calls Leroy,
and they all come help me with the dishes."  The man, getting somewhat
frustrated, says, "What if you want to talk to one of them about bad
grades on their report card, then how do you call them?"  She says,
"Oh, then I use their last name!"

A man was trapped on a deserted island that was sinking into the sea.  As the
water lapped around his feet, a motor boat suddenly approached the island.

"Come on, man, get in!" said the boatman. 

"No," said the guy on the island, "I have faith in Jesus.  He will save me!"

The boat went off and the water continued to rise.  When it was up to the guy's
chest, another boat appeared.

"Get in the boat, or you're going to drown!" said the boatman.  Again, the guy
said, "No, I have faith in Jesus.  He will save me!"

The boat went off and the water continued to rise.  When it was up to the guy's
chin, a third boat appeared.  

"Get in, this is your last chance!"

"No, Jesus will save me!" 

So the boat went off, the water continued to rise and the guy drowned.  He went
up to heaven and was greeted by Jesus.  

"Hey, Jesus," he said, "I trusted in you all my life and you let me drown!
I don't believe it!" 

"YOU don't believe it?" Jesus said, "I sent three fucking boats to save you!!"

A merchant captain and several of his officers were returning to the
ship after a large evening ashore.  As they climbed the gangway the
captain threw up all over himself.  Pointing to an apprentice seaman
above him, he shouted:

"Give that man five days in the brig for vomiting!"

The following morning the captain was checking the log and saw that the
young seaman had been sentenced to ten days and asked the chief mate why.

"Well, Cap'n, when we got you undressed we found that he'd also shit in
 your pants."

A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and
and steals a roast.  The butcher goes to lawyer's office and asks, "If a 
dog running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a 
right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?"  The lawyer 
answers, "Absolutely."

"Then you owe me $8.50.  Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today."

The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.50 [attorneys
don't carry cash -- it's too plebeian -- and the butcher hadn't brought the
shop's credit card imprinter to the lawyer's office].

The next day, the butcher opens his mail and finds an envelope from the
lawyer:  $50 due for a consultation.

  While going through his wife's dresser drawers, a farmer discovered
three soybeans and an envelope containing $30 in cash.  The farmer
confronted his wife, and when asked about the curious items, she
confessed:
  "Over the years, I haven't been completely faithful to you, but when
I did fool around, I put a soybean in the drawer to remind myself of my
indiscretion", she explained.
  The farmer admitted that he had not always been faithful either, 
and therefore, was inclined to forgive and forget a few moments of
weakness in his wife.
  "I'm curious though," he said, "Where did the thirty dollars
come from?"
  "Oh that," his wife replied, "Well, when soybeans hit ten dollars
a bushel, I sold out!"

Murphy is walking down a country lane near his home when he spies a
leprechaun sitting on a fencepost.  "Ah ha!", says he to himself, "I'll
catch the little fella and he'll have to give me his pot o' gold."

So, Murphy sneaks up on the leprechaun and grabs him by the shoulders.
The leprechaun is unhappy, but knows he can get away if he can get Murphy
to look away from him, even for an instant.

"Where's your pot o' gold?", says Murphy.

"Isn't that a purple cow over there?", says the leprechaun.

"I'm not taking my eyes off you!  Where's the gold?!", says Murphy.

"Look at that peacock flying overhead!", says the leprechaun.

"I'm wise to your tricks!  Where's the gold?!!", says Murphy.

Finally, the leprechaun gives up.  "All right", he says, "you've got me.
But I'm not a pot o' gold leprechaun, I'm a three-wish leprechaun."

"What's a three-wish leprechaun?", says Murphy.

"I can grant you up to three wishes", says the leprechaun, "but there's
a catch.  Whatever I give to you I give double to the person in the world
you hate the most.  I happen to know that's O'Brien over in the next town."

Murphy thinks it over and finally says "Done!  For my first wish I want
a fine, ten room mansion all for myself in that field over there."

"Done!" says the leprechaun and a beautiful mansion appears in the field.
In the field next to it is a 20 room mansion and on the porch stands
a surprised O'Brien saying "Why, thank you, Murphy.  I didn't think you
liked me."

"For my next wish", says Murphy, "I want ten of the most beautiful women in
the world to wait on me hand and foot."

"Done!", says the leprechaun, and ten stunning women appear on the front
porch of Murphy's new mansion.  O'Brien, now surrounded by twenty beautiful
women, is positively beaming.  "Bless you, lad!  I take back all the bad
thoughts I had of you", says he.

"Finally", says Murphy, "for my last wish ... I want my sexual potency
to be cut by fifty percent!"


Alternative endings:

1.  "Finally", says Murphy, "for my last wish ... I want to be beaten
    half to death!"

2.  "For my last two wishes", says Murphy, "I want a 110 lb. woman
    and half a marriage license!"

A woman went to her doctor for a followup visit after the doctor
had prescribed testosterone (a male hormone) for her.  She was a
little worried about some of the side effects she was experiencing.

"Doctor, the hormones you've been giving me have really helped, but
I'm afraid that you're giving me too much.  I've started growing hair
in places that I've never grown hair before."

The doctor reassured her. "A little hair growth is a perfectly normal
side effect of testosterone.  Just where has this hair appeared?"

"On my balls."

he located it, he realized that he forgot his wallet.  Instead of going out and
getting his wallet, he decided to get a five-finger discount (shoplift), so he
put it down his pants.  Well, as he was leaving the store, the cashier stopped
him and said, "Excuse me, but is that a record in your pants?" 

To this, he responded, "It may not be a record, but I'm mighty proud of it."

   A city boy went duck hunting in the country one day.  While hunting
he shot a duck which fell on the property of a farmer.  The boy crawled
over the fence to claim his kill.  But, the farmer, seeing what had
happened rushed out with his shotgun and yelled, "See here!  That duck
belongs too me!"

   The city boy replies, "But I shot the duck, therefore it belongs to me!"

   The farmer says, "It fell on my property so it belongs to me!"  They
continue to argue, each claiming ownership of the duck.  After a while,
the farmer says, "We should settle this the old-fashioned way."

   The city boy asks, "What is the 'old-fashioned way'?"

   The farmer explains, "First, I kick you in the groin. Then, you kick
me in the groin and we continue in this fashion until one of us gives up.
The one who wins gets the duck."

   The city boy, willing to do anything to get his duck and leave, agrees
to the contest.  The farmer draws back his leg and kicks the city boy in
the groin with all his might.  The city boy, in horrible pain, falls to the
ground moaning and groaning.  After about 10 minutes, he manages to stand up
and croaks, "It's my turn now."

   The farmer says, "Oh, you can have the duck", and leaves.

SCENE:  It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a rabbit is sitting
        outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his typewriter.

        Along comes a fox, out for a walk.  

FOX:    "What are you working on?"
RABBIT: "My thesis."
FOX:    "Hmm.  What's it about?"
RABBIT: "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes."
        (incredulous pause) 
FOX:    "That's ridiculous!  Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes."
RABBIT: "Sure they do, and I can prove it.  Come with me."

        They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow.  After a few
        minutes, the rabbit returns, alone, to his typewriter and resumes
        typing.

        Soon, a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hardworking
        rabbit.

WOLF:   "What's that you're writing?"
RABBIT: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat wolves."
        (loud guffaws)
WOLF:   "You don't expect to get such rubbish published, do you?"
RABBIT: "No problem.  Do you want to see why?"

        The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit
        returns by himself, after a few minutes, and goes back to typing.

SCENE:  Inside the rabbit's burrow.  In one corner, there is a pile of
        fox bones.  In another corner, a pile of wolf bones.  On the other
        side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth.

        (The End)

MORAL:  It doesn't matter what you choose for a thesis subject.
        It doesn't matter what you use for data.
        What does matter is who you have for a thesis advisor.

A guy gets on a bus and notices a nun sitting over in
a corner.  Through her heavy head piece he just spots a glimmer
of her face.  Gorgeous!  She moves, and her vestments cannot
hide the fact she has a truly phenomenal body.  The guy gets
more and more excited until he finally approaches the nun and
says, "Sister, I don't normally do this sort of thing, but I
think I love you.  Can we get together some time?"

The nun leaves the bus in a huff.

Later as the guy is about to leave the bus himself, the bus
driver asks the guy if he was the one who was bothering the
nun.  The guy again apologizes, explaining once again that
he seldom did this sort of thing, but the bus driver says:
"No, don't apologize, I was checking her out myself.  In
fact, let me do you a favor.  Did you see where she got
off?  There's a little park there, and every day she goes
there to pray at the same time.  Go there tomorrow, and maybe
you'll get lucky!"

The guy thanks him and leaves.

Sure enough, the guy goes to the park and there's the little
nun in a secluded spot by some trees.  He goes off into the
bushes, and comes back a few minutes later in a long white
robe, a long blond wig with beard and a crown of thorns.
The nun is flabbergasted, and asks what she can do for him.
He says that every couple of thousand years, he likes to
come back to earth to get laid.  The nun says that she'd
love to help him, but that she was on her period, and
would the back door be OK?

He says fine, and they commence their activities.

A few minutes into it, he is suddenly overcome with a blast
of guilt, and says, panting, "Sister, I have to tell you
something.  I'm not really Jesus, I'm actually the guy
who was annoying you on the bus yesterday."

The nun says, "Oh, that's OK.  In fact, I'm not really
a nun.  I'm actually the bus driver."

fall off!"

Since she was not, she went to a doctor to reconstruct her hymen.

The woman agreed to try the cheap way, payed the money, and the doctor
worked on her for several minutes.

After the "first night" the woman came back to the doctor and told
him that it was perfect.  The pain, the blood, everything was there. 
And she asked him how he did it.

There was a farmer who had a brown cow and a white cow and he
wanted to get them bred.  So, he borrowed his neighbor's bull
and turned it loose in the pasture.  He told his son to watch
and come in and tell him when the bull was finished.

"OK, Pop." said the little boy.

After a while, the boy came into the living room where his father
was talking with some friends.  "Say, Pop", said the boy, "the bull
just fucked the brown cow".

There was a sudden lull in the conversation.  The father said,
"Excuse me" and took his son outside.  "Son, you mustn't use
language like that in front of company.  You should say
'The bull surprised the brown cow'.  Now go and watch and tell
me when the bull surprises the white cow".

The father went back inside the house.  After a while the
boy came in and said, "Hey, Pop".

"Yes, Son.  Did the bull surprise the white cow?"

"He sure did, Pop!  He fucked the brown cow again!"

had ever seen.  As he pees, he cannot avoid spying on the giant
member of the tiny man dressed in green.  The leprechaun zips up and
the man asks him if he is indeed a real leprechaun.
   The little man says, "Aye me boy, I'm a leprechaun, and I can
grant you three wishes."
   "Oh neat," comes the reply, "What do I need to do?"
   "Well, havin' such a large cock makes it a bit awkward with the
ladies, the thing not fittin' and all ... I'll grant you your three
wishes if you wouldn't mind suckin' me dick until I come."  The man
is a bit taken aback, but agrees, because he knows he can wish for
anything he wants later.  After the green man has come, he starts to
walk away.
   The guy says, "Hey, what about my three wishes?"  The leprechaun
asks, "How old are you me boy?"
   "25," he says.
   "Aren't you a bit too old to still be believin' in leprechauns?"

"No problem!  I'll write you a check!"

"Very good, sir." says the shop owner.  "Today is Saturday.  You
may come by on Monday to pick it up, after the check has cleared."

So the man and the woman leave.  On Monday, the fellow returns.
The store owner is outraged:  "How dare you show your face in here?!

"I just had to come by," grinned the guy, "to thank you for the
most wonderful weekend of my life!"

of a very long and productive life.  The old man in is a terminal coma,

"No, grandfather, you are not dreaming.  Grandmother is baking strudel now."

"I know I will never have another taste of her delicious strudel after this
one.  Could you please go down and get me a piece?", the old man begs with

This just came in from the WHO report:

The World Health Organization recently did a resarch in determining
the function of the knob at the end of the penis.

The Russians put in a million dollars and came up with the results
saying that the knob is there merely to please a man during sexual
encounters.

The French also put in a million dollars but came up with a different
conclusion citing that the knob is there for the pleasure of a woman.

The Poles put in $2.98 and discovered that the function of a knob
is to prevent the hand from slipping off!!!!
