         This guy  walks  into  a bar and orders a drink.  As the bartender
         serves the drink, the guy asks,  "Hey,  I  heard a good Aggie joke
         the other day.  Do you want to hear it?"

         The bartender says, "Well before you tell it, I  should  warn  you
         that I'm  an  Aggie.   See  those  two guys at the end of the bar?
         They're Aggies.  And see those guys  over  at that table.  They're
         Aggies too.  Are you sure you want to tell that joke?"

         The guy  replied,  "Hell  no!   I don't want to  explain  it  five
         times..."

         This bear was sitting on a log in the woods, taking a shit.  Along
         came a rabbit.  The rabbit asked, "Do you mind if I join you?"
         The bear  replied "Suit yourself."  So there they both sat, taking
         a shit.  After they were finished,  the bear asked the rabbit, "Do
         you ever  have  a problem with shit sticking to  your  fur?"   The
         rabbit said,  "No".   The  bear  says,  "Good!"  Then he grabs the
         rabbit and with a long sweeping motion wipes his ass..........

         God and  St.  Peter were playing golf one day.  St. Peter teed his
         ball up and hit it.  It was a real  nice  shot about three hundred
         yards down the fairway.

         Then God teed his ball up.  He took a big swing and hit it.

         At first it looked like a real nice shot.  Then all  of  a sudden,
         it hooked and started for the woods.  Just before it went into the
         woods, a  bird  flew  out  and  grabbed the ball and flew over the
         water trap and let it go.

         Just before it went into the water,  a  turtle surfaced.  The ball
         landed on it's back as he swam to the shore.  Just  as  the turtle
         got to  the shore, a squirrel ran out of the woods and grabbed the
         ball.  Then the squirrel ran up  on the green and dropped the ball
         in the cup.

         St. Peter turned to God and said, "Are we gonna play  golf, or are
         you gonna fuck around!!"

         This guy  gets  his penis shot off in Vietnam.  One day at home he
         is reading the T.V. guide and sees an ad for a doctor that says he
         can fix this.

         When he gets to the doctor, he  asks,  "What  do  you  use."   The
         doctor says, "Baby elephant trunks."  So the guy  decides  to have
         the surgery.

         About six  months  go  by and the guy finally gets the nerve up to
         ask a lady out to dinner.  As they  are  eating dinner, this thing
         comes out from under the table, grabs a biscuit,  and  darts  back
         underneath the table.

         The girl  sees this and thinks to herself, "If that happens again,
         I'm going to have to say something."

         A few minutes later, this thing comes out from under the table and
         grabs another biscuit.

         The lady says, "Buddy, I don't  know  what  that  is,  but,  if it
         happens again, I'm going to get mad!"

         The guy says, "Your going to get mad.  Hell, if that  thing stuffs
         another biscuit up my ass, I'm REALLY going to get mad!

         Little Johnny was sitting in the  courtyard  turning  a  bottle of
         liquid back and forth, watching the bubbles.  The Priest walked up
         and asked him what he was doing?

         Little Johnny replied, "I'm looking at the most powerful liquid in
         the world."  The Priest said, "But Johnny, Holy Water is the most
         powerful liquid in the world.  Did you know that  if  you put Holy
         Water on a pregnant woman's belly, she will pass a boy!"

         This couple was crossing the desert  with  a  camel.  The lady was
         pregnant and riding the camel.  All of a sudden, they were stopped
         by an Israeli patrol.  The soldiers asked for some identification.
         The soldiers looked at the I.D.s and saw that the  man was Joseph,
         and the  lady  was Mary.  So they asked the couple where they were
         going.  They replied "Jerusalem."

         The two soldiers looked at each  other  and  grinned,  "Yea, and I
         guess your going to name the baby Jesus?"  The couple  replied,  "
         What!?  We look Puerto Rican?!?!?!"

         thumb in my mashed potatoes."

         The waitress  replies,  "The  doctor  said  I have arthritis and I
         should keep my thumb warm."  The truck driver says, "Well you dumb
         bitch, why don't you stick your  thumb up your ass!"  She says, "I
         do when I'm in the kitchen......"

         This zoo had a female gorilla, but no male gorilla.   This  female
         gorilla was  really  getting  horny and the zoo had no one to take
         care of her.

         One day they decided to advertise  in  the  paper  for someone who
         would "take care of" this female gorilla.  They started at $200.00
         but got no response.  Finally, at $1000.00 a guy answered the ad.

         The guy  looked  at the gorilla and told the zoo  keeper  that  he
         would do  it,  but only if they would put a bag over the gorilla's
         head.  The zoo keeper agreed.  So they put a bag over the gorillas
         head and this guy got into the cage.

         Well this gorilla was extremely  horny.   She grabbed this guy and
         started fucking him every way you could imagine.

         They were  bouncing  off the walls, up and down the  cage,  making
         love wildly.   All  of a sudden the guy started yelling at the top
         of his voice, "Get it off!  Get it off!"  So the attendants jumped
         in the cage and pulled the gorilla off.

         The guy yelled, "What the hell are  you doing?!"  "You said to get
         it off."  The guy says, "Hell, I meant the bag, I  wanna  kiss the
         bitch!"

         This Texan  goes  to Hawaii for vacation.  The first place they go
         is a beach.  The Texan says, "Well yaknow, this is really a pretty
         beach, but it aint no big deal.   Hell,  we  got  beaches  just as
         pretty on South Padre Island."

         The next place they go is Honolulu.  The Texan says, "Well, yea
         this is alright.  But we got more buildings, and  taller buildings
         than this in both Houston and Dallas.  This aint no big deal."

         Well this goes on all day.  Everywhere they go, there is something
         in Texas  just  as good.  The tour guide is getting tired of this.
                                      Page 4





         Finally he  takes  the  group up to the top of a live volcano.  As
         they are standing around this, the  tour guide looked at the Texan
         and asked, "Well you son of a bitch, you got anything like this in
         Texas?"

         The Texan  thought  about it for a minute and replied,  "Well  no.
         But I'll  tell  you  what.   We got a fire department in Waco that
         will put that son of a bitch out in about fifteen minutes....."

         These two ladies were walking  down  the  street  when  they  came
         across this frog.  The frog said, "Kiss me and I  will turn into a
         handsome Texas oil man."

         One lady reached down, grabbed the frog and put it in her purse.
         The other  looked  at her and said, "Aren't you going to kiss that
         frog?" She replied, "Hell no!  A  talking frog is worth a lot more
         money than a Texas oil man......"

         Did you hear how Moses got the ten commandments?   God  was coming
         down the  mountain  and  the  first  person he came across was not
         Moses.  It was a Roman.

         He asked  the  Roman if he wanted  any  commandments?   The  Roman
         replied, What's a commandment?"  God said, "Thou shalt not kill."

         The Roman replied, "Hell no!  We're a warring nation.   That's how
         we make our living."

         So God went on down the mountain.  The next guy he came across was
         a nomadic   tribesman.    He   asked  this  guy  if  he  wanted  a
         commandment.  The guy replied, "What's  a commandment?"  God said,
         "Thou shalt not steal."

         The guy said, "Hell no!  That's how we make our living."   So  God
         went on  down the mountain.  The next guy he came across was Moses
         with a bunch of little Jews following him.

         God asked Moses, "Do you want any commandments?" Moses asked, "How
         much are they?"  God said, "They're  free."   Moses  replied  "Yea
         sure, we'll take ten....."

         This guy  was  walking  through  the  desert when he found a magic
         lamp.  He picked the lamp up and  rubbed  the  side  of  it.  Sure
         enough, a genie popped out.

         The genie said, "Thank you for getting me/out of  that  lamp.   In
         return, I  will  grant you one wish."  So the guy thought about it
         and said, "I want a foreign car dealership in a major metropolitan
         city."  Pooof, he had a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo...

         One day a Catholic Priest, Methodist  Preacher, and a Jewish Rabbi
         were sitting around discussing how they divide the  take from each
         Sabbath.

         The Priest  said,  "What  I do is I draw a line down the center of
         the room and then throw the money  up  in the air.  Whatever lands
         on the left is God's, whatever lands on the right is mine."

         The Preacher said, "Well I do almost the same thing  only I draw a
         circle in the middle of the room.  Whatever lands in the circle is
         mine and the rest belongs to God."

         The Rabbi  says,  "No,  you  both  are doing it wrong.  I take the
         money and throw it up in the air.  Then I yell, God, Take what you
         want!.  Whatever comes back down is mine......"

         This low budget oil producer had an oil well that was on fire.  He
         called every oil well fire fighter in the phone book.  All of them
         were very expensive.  Red Adair wanted $25,000 just  to  come look
         at the  fire.  There was no way he could afford this.  Finally, he
         noticed an ad for Jose's Fire Fighting  Service.   He  called Jose
         and asked how much he charged?

         Jose said,  "Senor, I only charge $1,000."  The producer  thought,
         Great! "Well OK Jose, come on out and look at my oil well fire."

         The producer  was  standing on a hill looking at his oil well fire
         when a pickup truck with Jose's  Fire Fighting on the door and ten
         Mexicans in the back came across the hill and drove  straight into
         the fire.

         All of  the  Mexicans  got  out  of the truck and started stomping
         their feet and waiving their serapes screaming, "Ariba!  Ariba!"

         After about fifteen minutes, the fire was out.  The producer
         couldn't believe it.  The fire  was  out!   The  producer  yelled,
         "Congratulations Jose!  What are you going to do with the $1,000?"

         Jose answered,  "Well  senor, the first thing I  do  is  feex  the
         brakes on this truck..."

         Jack and  Jill were working for this company.  The company had run
         into some bad times and the guy  that  owned the company was going
         to have to lay either Jack or Jill off.  He really couldn't decide
         which one to lay off because they were both really good workers.

         One day, he decided which ever one of them came  back  from  lunch
         first, he  was  going  to lay off.  Sure enough, here came Jill up
         the front stairs.  As she entered the front door, he walked up
         to her and said, "Listen Jill, I'm  really  sorry but I'm going to
         have to either lay you or Jack off."

         Jill replied, "Well you're going to have to jack off cause I got a

         5000 years ago, Moses said:
         Pick up your shovel, mount your ass,
         and I'll lead you to the promised land.

         for this is the promised land.

         sell your camel, kick your ass,
         and tell you there is no promised land.
