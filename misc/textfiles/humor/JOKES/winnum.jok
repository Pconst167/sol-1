Subject: Winning numbers

On a recent vacation, I came upon the following news item in
the March 15 Blue Springs, Missouri, Examiner:

                                PICK 3

ST. LOUIS -- The winning numbers drawn Tuesday night in the daily
Missouri Lottery Pick 3 game were 9-9-9.

A winning $1 ticket with the numbers in the correct order paid $500; a
winning $1 ticket with the numbers in any order paid $160.
