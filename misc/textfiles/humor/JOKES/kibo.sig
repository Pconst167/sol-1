Harry Graber, age 11, is dying of a fatal disease which will eventually kill
him.  Before he dies, he would like to be in the "Guinness" Book of "Records"
for receiving the most postcards in the mail.  Please send him lots of
postcards at the below address:

              Kibo, PO Box 722, Boston MA 02116-0722 (USA)

Although he is very ill and only barely clinging to life, he gets thousands
of postcards a day from people like you.  He writes back, personally, to
each and every single one.  Amazingly, everyone who writes to Harry recieves
a year of good luck afterwards!  Mrs. Bertha Briggs of Poughkeepsie, NY
recently wrote to Harry and then won the lottery the very next day--AND her
dog was cured of cancer!  Plus, if you write now, Harry will send you
his miracle POSTCARD DIET which will allow you to lose 100 pounds a week!

                            THIS IS NOT A SCAM!
                           This service is FREE!
               Please enclose $14.95 for postage and handling.

Hey, is Ted Danson really as bald as they say?  He couldn't be, his hair's
fluffy, and wigs can't be fluffy!  William Shatner wears a toupee though,
I bet you didn't know that!  I hope I never go bald.  I'd lose my sex appeal.

MY TEN FAVORITE QUOTES: Broad-mindedness, n.: The result of flattening high-
mindedness out.  There is a certain impertinence in allowing oneself to be 
burned for an opinion. All the good ones are taken.  "Microwave oven?  Whaddya 
mean, it's a microwave oven? I've been watching Channel 4 on the thing for two 
weeks."  Murphy was an optimist. Love means having to say you're sorry every 
five minutes. No matter how great your triumphs or how tragic your defeats -- 
approximately one billion Chinese couldn't care less. Get forgiveness now -- 
tomorrow you may no longer feel guilty. Commitment can be illustrated by a 
breakfast of ham and eggs. The chicken was involved, the pig was committed.  
You are here ------> * But you're not all there.  Kirkland, Illinois, law 
forbids bees to fly over the village or through any of its streets.  Love and 
scandal are the best sweeteners of tea.  A clairvoyant is a person, commonly a 
woman, who has the power of seeing that  which is invisible to her patron -- 
namely, that he is a blockhead.  A multi-day event on public television, used 
to raise money so  you won't have to watch commercials.  Try to get all of 
your posthumous medals in advance.  The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the 
needs of an expanding  bureaucracy.  The intelligence of any discussion 
diminishes with the square of the number of participants.  The hearing ear is 
always found close to the speaking tongue, a custom  whereof the memory of man 
runneth not howsomever to the contrary,  nohow.  Good advice is something a 
man gives when he is too old to set a bad  example.  -- La Rouchefoucauld 
Professor Gorden Newell threw another shutout in last week's Chem. Eng. 130 
midterm.  Once again no student received a single point on  his exam.  Newell 
has now tossed 5 shutouts this quarter.  Newell's  earned exam average has now 
dropped to a phenomenal 30%"Consequences, Schmonsequences, as long as I'm 
rich." -- "Ali Baba Bunny" [1957, Chuck Jones]  Marriage is the only adventure 
open to the cowardly.  -- Voltaire  The First Rule of Program Optimization:  
Don't do it.  The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!):  
Don't do it yet.  -- Michael Jackson Goldenstern's Rules:  (1) Always hire a 
rich attorney  (2) Never buy from a rich salesman.  The problem ... is that we 
have run out of dinosaurs to form oil with.  Scientists working for the 
Department of Energy have tried to form oil  using other animals; they've 
piled thousands of tons of sand and Middle  Eastern countries on top of cows, 
raccoons, haddock, laboratory rats,  etc., but so far all they have managed to 
do is run up an enormous  bulldozer-rental bill and anger a lot of Middle 
Eastern persons.  None  of the animals turned into oil, although most of the 
laboratory rats  developed cancer.  -- Dave Barry, "Postpetroleum Guzzler"  If 
a 6600 used paper tape instead of core memory, it would use up tape  at about 
30 miles/second. -- Grishman, Assembly Language Programming Peanut Blossoms  4 
cups sugar  16 tbsp. milk  4 cups brown sugar  4 tsp. vanilla  4 cups 
shortening  14 cups flour  8 eggs  4 tsp. soda  4 cups peanut butter  4 tsp. 
salt  Shape dough into balls.  Roll in sugar and bake on ungreased cookie  
sheet at 375 F. for 10-12 minutes.  Immediately top each cookie with a  
Hershey's kiss or star pressing down firmly to crack cookie.  Makes a  hell of 
a lot.  Gyroscope, n.:  A wheel or disk mounted to spin rapidly about an axis 
and also  free to rotate about one or both of two axes perpendicular to  each 
other and the axis of spin so that a rotation of one of  the two mutually 
perpendicular axes results from application of  torque to the other when the 
wheel is spinning and so that the  entire apparatus offers considerable 
opposition depending on  the angular momentum to any torque that would change 
the direction of the axis of spin.  -- Webster's Seventh New Collegiate 
Dictionary.  In fifteen minutes, everyone will be famous. -- Andy Warhol

Majel Barett was only on STAR TREK because she was married to William Shatner.
The new STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION new series that they're making 
now is too full of Yuppie bozos.  And the special effects are too good.

Might I suggest adding the following quote to your .signature:

"It seems like it's time to retire the length-of-sig-wasted-bandwidth flame.
The point really is, News is BIG and .signatures, even long ones, are small."

Subject: Re:  your .sig

Hi there.

Thanks for your nifty .sig.  I already got a copy from alt.fan.warlord,
but with such a wonderful work of art, you can never have too many copies,
can you?  Well, of course you can!  I mean, "Mona Lisa" is a damn good
painting, but am I going to hang it in every room in my apartment?  No!
But I digress.

Anyway, to make your .sig a bit more "user-friendly", here is an index for
it.  The numbers, of course, refer to line numbers.
I'll let someone ELSE do a table of contents.

Suggestions for index:
1)  Append it to the end of the .sig
2)  Include it as a seperate file 
3)  Just delete the damn thing, log off, and watch Ren and Stimpy
or (my favorite):  append it to the end of your sig, THEN log off and
watch Ren and Stimpy.
