                THE PLAN
                --------

In the beginning was the plan
and then came the assumptions
and the assumptions were without form
and the plan was without substance
and darkness was on the face of the workers
and they spoke amongst themselves, saying
"it is a crock of shit, and it stinketh"
and the workers went unto their supervisors and sayeth
"it is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof"
and the supervisors went unto their managers,and sayeth unto them
"it is a container of excrement and it is very strong,
such that none may abide it"
and the managers, went unto their directors and sayeth
"it is a vessel of fertilizer and none may abide by its strength"
and the directors spoke among themselves, saying to one another
"it contains that which aids plant growth, and is very strong"
and the directors went unto the vice presidents and sayth unto them
"it promotes growth and is very powerful"
and the vice presidents went unto the president and sayeth unto him
"this new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of
the company, and all these areas in particular"
and the president looked upon the plan,
and saw that it was good, and the plan became policy.
       "THIS IS HOW SHIT HAPPENS !"
