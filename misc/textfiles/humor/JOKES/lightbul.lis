Subject: Light bulb joke list (very long)


These are all the light bulb jokes that I've found on the net in the last two
years. If you have any to add, email them to slambo@ucrmath.ucr.edu

-------------------8<----------------------->8---------------------------------


Why don't you just let us take out the socket? You aren't using it anyway, and
it will only cause you trouble later.

What's the difference between a pregnant woman and a light bulb? You can un-
screw a light bulb.

How many board meetings does it take to get a light bulb changed?
This topic was resumed from last week's discussion, but is incomplete
pending resolution of some action items. It will be continued next week.
Meanwhile ...

How many people does it take to throw away a one WATT bulb? Five: A black, a 
Jew, two women and a cripple. (topical to the resignation of Interior Sec.
James Watt in 1983)

How many ...

	Accountants?
	What kind of answer did you have in mind?

	Actors?
	One: They don't like to share the spotlight.

	Aides to change Ronald Reagan's light bulb?
	None: They like to keep him in the dark.

	Alabama alumni?

	Amish?
	Amish don't have light bulbs, they bake pies.

	Anarchists?
	All of them.

	Apple and IBM nuts?
	An infinite number: nothing useful gets done while they're arguing.
Finally a disgusted generic computer user (who will use any type that is in
front of him) gets up and changes the bulb, elbowing the participants aside.
The size of the crowd arguing seems to be a function of time, although whether
or not the function is exponential is not known.

	A**holes?
	None: They never see the light anyway.

	Astronomers?
	None: they prefer the dark.

	Atheists?
	None: They're never in the dark.
		How many light bulbs does it take to fix an atheist?
			It doesn't matter. They wouldn't glow anyway.

	Auto mechanics?
	Two: One to try to put in the wrong bulb, and one to replace the
socket.
	Six: One to force it with a hammer, and five more to go out for more
bulbs.

	Ayatollahs?
	None: there were no light bulbs in the 13th century.

	Bankers?
	Four: one to hold the bulb, and three to try to remember the combo.

	Bass players?
	Six: One to change it, five to fight off the lead guitarists who are
hogging the light.

	Believable, competent, "just right for the job" presidential 
candidates?
	It's going to be a dark 4 years, isn't it?

	Bell Labs VP's?
	That's proprietary information. Answer available from AT&T on
payment of license fees (available in binary only).
	Nearly unanswerable, since the one who tries to change it
usually drops it, and the others call for a planning session.
	Three: One to get the bulb, and two to get the phone number of one of
their subordinates to do the job.

	Beverly hills realtors?
	Three: one to screw it in and two to learn Arabic.

before it crashes.

	Bureaucrats?
	None: "We contract out for things like that."
	Two: One to screw it in and one to screw it up.
	Two: One to assure that everything possible is being done while
the other screw the bulb into the water faucet.
	Five: One to change the bulb and four to write an environmental impact
report.
	An infinite number: One to spot the burned out bulb, his supervisor to
authorize a requisition, a requisition typist, twelve clerks to file the 
requisition copies, a mail clerk to deliver the requisition to the purchasing
department, a purchasing agent to order the bulb, a clerk to forward the
purchasing order, a clerk to mail-order a receiving clerk to receive the
new bulb ...

	Bush campaign aides?
	(Bush in an earnest lap dog voice) NONE! I think the media's
keeping this thing alive! I think the American people are TIRED of 
light bulb jokes!

	Cabbage Patch Dolls?
	The question is irrelevant since you couldn't find the dolls
even if you knew the answer.

	Californians?

	Chiropractors?
	Only one, but it takes nine visits.

	Christians?
	Three, but they're really only one.

	Christian Scientists?
	None, but it takes at least one to sit and pray for the old one
to go back on.

	Circus performers?
	Four: One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four
to go!

	Civil servants?
	45: One to change the bulb, and 44 to do the paperwork.

	"Cliffie Girls"?
	It's "Radcliffe women", and it's not funny!

	College students?
	Two, but they both get 10 credits for doing it.

	Computer security experts?
	"That depends on the TCSEC rating of the object light bulb. If it's a
C2 bulb (or below), one. If a B1 bulb, just one, but he/she must document the
potential covert channel. If a B2 bulb, he/she must also audit the covert
channel. If a B3/A1 bulb, none, since covert channels are not allowed. [See
also the "Orange Book"]

	Conservatives?
	None: they liked the old one so much that nothing could compare to it.

	Consultants?
	I'll have an estimate for you a week from Monday.
	We don't know. They never get past the feasibility study.
	Two: One always leaves in the middle of the project.

	Cops?
	None: It turns itself in.
	One, but he's always at the donut shop when you need him.

	Country singers?
	Three: One to change it, two to sing about the old one.

	Dadaists?
	To get to the other side?

write the bulb insertion program, and one to act as the bulb admin-
istrator to make sure nobody else tries to change the bulb at the same
time.

	Dead Babies?
	As many as it takes to make a pile big enough to climb on to 
reach the bulb.

	Democratic presidential candidates (1988)?
	(Mike Dukakis) In Massachusetts, my enlightened government has
mad it unnecessary for people to screw in their own light bulbs, as we
have put thousands of former welfare recipients to work for the Dept.
of Light Bulb Installation. These employees will come to your home or
business and install any incandescent bulb, on only a few months notice.
	(Bruce Babbitt) It's foolish to talk about screwing in light
bulbs when we haven't even taken the first step, and that is to remove
the old bulb. I challenge my fellow candidates to stand up with me and
help me remove this old light bulb [stands, but nobody else does] Hah!
What wimps. You guys make Bush look like Rambo.
	(Richard Gephart) It doesn't matter whether the bulb is changed
or not; it only matters that the new bulb was made in the US of A.
Taiwan and South Korea have put up massive barriers to importing US
light bulbs; we'll see how they like it when their bulbs cost $10,000
to screw in here.
	(Gary Hart) This oblique reference to screwing is an obvious
attempt to drag my personal life into this campaign. Frankly, I resent
it, and the American people resent it.
	(Al Gore) As usual, the other left-wing wacko candidates are
putting forth solutions that moderate Southerners won't cotton to on 
Super Tuesday. At least I hope not.
	(Paul Simon) My media experts tell me I'm foolish for wearing 
my hair the same way I did in the 50's. But that's what Paul Simon's 
all about. And I suppose my media experts are gonna say I'm foolish for
this, but in all candor, I change my light bulbs the smae way I did in
the 50's: my wife gets on a ladder and I turn it.
	(Jesse Jackson) Changing the light bulb is a partial solution
at best. I'm more of a Lone Ranger than a light bulb changer. But even 
the Lone Ranger had Tonto and Silver, and the shameful fact is that the
American Indians of today don't have enough solver, or gold, or even
paper money to allow them to buy into the American Dream or some extra
light bulbs. We must ensure that all Americans can light their homes,
>from the lighthouse to the White House.

	Three: One to find a bulb specialist, one to find a bulb
installation specialist, and one to bill it all to Medicare.

	One, but he has a nurse tell him which end to screw in.

	Dope addicts?
	Two: One to roll it, and one to light it up.

			They replace the fuse box.

in engineering has burned out, to which Kirk will send Bones to pro-

have no more new light bulbs, and complains that he can't see in the 
dark to tend to his engines. Kirk must make an emergency stop at the
next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to procure a light bulb from 
the natives. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Sulu, and 3 red-shirt security
officers beam down. The three security officers are promptly killed
by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured. Mean-
while, back in orbit, Scotty notices a Klingon ship approaching and

who is suffering from the flu, and as a reward the landing party is set

family to save electricity.

	Romulans?

	Sound men?
	One, but instead of using a new bulb (which he doesn't have), he opens
up the old bulb, uses a bit of scavenged wire and duct tape to reattach the

up through the rafters and reinstalls the whole thing fifty feet away where
the band decides it's much better.
