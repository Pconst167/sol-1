 This guy gets a raise, so he decides to but a new sight for his gun.
Well, anyway, the salesman at the store is throwing his pitch, and he
brags, "If you'll look through this sight, I'll bet that you can see my
house in perfect detail, even though it's the whole way at the top of the
hill."

 So the guy looks through the sight, and says, "Yep, you're right... wait
a minute... I can see some lady and a guy running around with no clothes
on, too..."

 Shocked, the salesman snatches the sight back, and looks through it.
Sure enough, he sees the same thing.  Infuriated, the salesman hands the
guy a gun and two bullets, and says,  "If you'll blow my cheatin' wife's
head off, and that guy's dick off, you can have the sight for free."

 The guy looks throught the sight again.  "You know, I think I can do that
with only 1 bullet..."

The dean of Engineering had once walked into a class, and said               
"Good Morning." The whole class chorused "Good Morning".

"Hi, you are freshmen aren't you?" he asked.

One student bolder than the others asked him how he knew.

"Well," he said. "When I say 'Good Morning' to a class, if they are
freshmen they say 'Good Morning' too. If they are sophomores, they
quietly fold their papers away, and look at me. A class of Juniors 
will look at me over the top of their papers, and then get back to
them. A class of Seniors will ignore my greeting, and keep reading
the papers. When I say 'Good Morning' to a class of graduate students,
they write it down.

A burglar had been casing a particular house for some time.  Finally, he
saw the owners leave for what appeared to be an extended camping trip.
That night he broke in through a basement window and was trying to find
his way in the dark when he heard what seemed to him to be the voice of
a very old woman saying "Shame on you!  I see you, and Jesus sees you!"
Startled, the burglar snarls back "Shut up, Grandma, or you're gonna
get hurt!"  He shines his flashlight all around, but no Grandma.
Again the voice: "Shame on you!  I see you, and Jesus sees you!"
Finally, the beam of the flashlight finds a large cage and in it
a pretty upset parrot.  Relieved, the burglar turns back around and
starts toward the stairs, only to spot an enormous slavering doberman
waiting at the top.  Just then the parrot screams, "Sic'em, Jesus!"

An American General, a Russian General and a British General are standing on
the deck of a ship watching war exercises (OK, OK, so this is an *old* one..).
The topic of discussion turns to human courage, and the Russian General boasts,
   "Russians are the most courageous people on Earth!".

Upon which the American (naturally) challenges him: "Oh YEAH?".

The Russian says, "Sure! Here, Yuri! Jump off the deck (into the freezing
Atlantic) and swim around the ship!"

Yuri marches off without a word, and does as he is told. The Russian turns
around and says: "See, there's an example of courage!"

The American *has* to top this, so he calls up one of his underlings and gives
him the order:

   "Jack, Jump off the main mast into the ocean, and swim around the ship
   seven times!"

Poor Jack goes off without a murmur, and he too does as he is told. The
American General says: "Now top *that* for courage!"

So they both turn around to the British General who has been standing around
watching these antics silently. They ask him: "What about *your* people?".

So the British guy calls up one of his people and says: "Trevor, jump off the
mast and swim under the keel of the ship, will you, old chap?"

Trevor stares at his general.

 "Let me get this right. You want me to jump off the mast."
 "Yes."
 "And swim under the keel"
 "Yes."

 "You must be daft!"

And so saying, Trevor turns around and saunters off. Whereupon the British
General turns to the other two and says,

  "Now *there*'s an example of TRUE courage!"

An old man is lying on his deathbed with all his children,
grandchildren and his older great-grandchildren all around, teary-eyed
at the approaching finale of a very long and productive life. The old
man in is a terminal coma, and the doctors have confirmed that the
waiting will be over within the next twenty-four hours. Suddenly, the
old man opens his eyes and croaks: "I must be dreaming of heaven. I
smell your grandmother's strudel."

"No, grandfather, you are not dreaming. Grandmother is baking strudel
now."

"I know I will never have another taste of her delicious strudel after
this one. Could you please go down and get me a sliver?" the old man
begs with what is left of his final breath.

One of the grandchildren is immediately dispatched to honor the old
man's last request. After a long time, he returns empty-handed.

"Did you bring me one last piece of your grandmother's delicious
strudel?" the old man plaintively queries?

"I'm very sorry, grandfather, but she says it's for the funeral."

Arthur was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and
generally feeling good about himself, when a Nun suddenly appears at his
table and starts decrying the evils of drink.

"You should be ashamed of yourself young man!  Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol
is the blood of the devil!"

Now Arthur gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive.
"How do _you_ know Sister?"

"My Mother Superior told me so"

"But have you ever had a drink yourself?  How can you be sure that what you
are saying is right?"

"Don't be ridiculous - of course I have never taken alcohol myself"

"Then let me buy you a drink, - if you still believe afterwards that it is
evil I will give up drink for life"

"How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!"

"I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, them no-one will know"


The Nun reluctantly agrees, so Arthur goes inside to the bar.

"Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks", then he lowers his
voice and says to the barman ".. and could you put the vodka in a teacup?"

"Oh no!  It's not that bl**dy Nun again is it?"

SCENE:  It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a rabbit is sitting
        outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his typewriter.

        Along comes a fox, out for a walk.  

FOX:    "What are you working on?"
RABBIT: "My thesis."
FOX:    "Hmm.  What's it about?"
RABBIT: "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes."
        (incredulous pause) 
FOX:    "That's ridiculous!  Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes."
RABBIT: "Sure they do, and I can prove it.  Come with me."

        They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow.  After a few
        minutes, the rabbit returns, alone, to his typewriter and resumes
        typing.

        Soon, a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hardworking
        rabbit.

WOLF:   "What's that you're writing?"
RABBIT: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat wolves."
        (loud guffaws)
WOLF:   "You don't expect to get such rubbish published, do you?"
RABBIT: "No problem.  Do you want to see why?"

        The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit
        returns by himself, after a few minutes, and goes back to typing.

SCENE:  Inside the rabbit's burrow.  In one corner, there is a pile of
        fox bones.  In another corner, a pile of wolf bones.  On the other
        side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth.

        (The End)

MORAL:  It doesn't matter what you choose for a thesis subject.
        It doesn't matter what you use for data.
        What does matter is who you have for a thesis advisor.

My favourite two campus practical jokes:

1. Arrange the light switches in a lavatory and an adjacent room so that
flipping one switch also flips the other.  Consider the resultant scene
(visible from the outside just by watching the windows): the room's resident
retires for the evening, turning off his (or her) light.  Some time later,
someone else decides to use the head, and turns on the light.  After a few
minutes, the resident awakes, decides that someone is pulling a fast one,
and turns the light off ... on the guy (or girl) who is by now seated on
the throne!  If it works correctly, the two unfortunates end up standing
at their respective light switches, with the lights oscillating rapidly
(by which time the perpetrators are rolling on the ground outside laughing
their heads off).

2. This prank happened a number of years ago.  Two guys had been pulling
practical jokes on each other for quite a while.  Finally, one of them got
a pair of rather large (and LOUD) firecrackers, and wired them to light
bulb bases with nichrome wire such that applying power would set off the
firecrackers.  One of the devices was installed in the victim's room, the
other in the perpetrator's.

That evening, the victim returned to his room, and turned on the light.
There was a short delay as the fuse burned, and during that delay the victim
(quite naturally) turned to see what was wrong with the light -- BLAM!  Well,
the victim was (quite naturally) upset and flustered and resolved to do some-
thing appropriately horrendous to the perpetrator's room.  He went over to
the perpetrator's room, his own counter-prank in hand, went in, and turned
on the light.  When nothing happened, his reflexes again betrayed him: he
looked up at the light -- BLAM!

Apparently, the victim never bothered to counter-stack the perpetrator.

"The bull just fucked the brown cow".

There was a sudden lull in the conversation.  The father said 
"Excuse me" and took his son outside.  "Son, you mustn't use

This is a joke told by Dave Allen on one of his
shows (British program 'Dave Allen at Large').

A drunk leaves a bar and decides to take a shortcut through a
graveyard.  It is raining heavily and very dark.  The drunk
fails to see an open grave and falls into it.  He tries to
climb out of it, but it is too deep and the rain has turned
the dirt to mud and has made it too slippery to climb.  He
gives up after a while and decides to spend the night there.

A while later, another drunk leaves the same bar and decides
to take the same shortcut through the graveyard.  He, too,
falls into that open grave and tries to climb out but the
mud is too slippery.  The first drunk is still sitting there
and watches as the other drunk tries but fails to get out.

The first drunk stands up, taps the second drunk on the shoulder
and tells him, "You'll never get out!".

He did.

Dave Allen is an excellent storyteller and a very inventive
comedian.  I'm afraid that just reading it here doesn't do justice
to it.

(And now... the saga continues...)

   A city boy went duck hunting in the country one day. While hunting
he shot a duck which fell on the property of a farmer. The boy crawled
over the fence to claim his kill. But, the farmer, seeing what had
happened rushed out with his shotgun and yelled, "See here! That duck
belongs too me!"

   The city boy replies, "But I shot the duck, therfore it belongs to me!"

   The farmer says, "It fell on my property so it belongs to me!" They
continue to argue, each claiming ownership of the duck. After awhile the
farmer says, "We should settle this the old-fashioned way."

   The city boy asks, "What is the 'old-fashioned way'?"

   The farmer explains, "First, I kick you in the groin. Then, you kick
me in the groin and we continue in this fashion until one of us gives up.
The one who wins gets the duck."

   The city boy, willing to do anything to get his duck and leave, agrees
to the contest. The farmer draws back his leg and kicks the city boy in
the groin with all his might. The city boy, in horrible pain, falls to the
ground moaning and groaning. After about 10 minutes of this, the city boy stands
up shakily and croaks, "Its my turn now."

   The farmer says, "Oh, you can have the duck", and leaves.

Here's one I wish I'd written:

A man and a woman walk into a very posh Rodeo Drive furrier.
"Show the lady your finest mink!" the fellow exclaims.  So the
owner of the shop goes in back and comes out with an absolutely
gorgeous full-length coat.  As the lady tries it on, the
furrier sidles up to the guy and discreetly whispers,
"Ah, sir, that particular fur goes for $65,000."

"No problem!  I'll write you a check!"

"Very good, sir." says the shop owner.  "Today is Saturday.  You
may come by on Monday to pick it up, after the check has cleared."

So the man and the woman leave.  On Monday, the fellow returns.
The store owner is outraged: "How dare you show your face in here?!
There wasn't a single penny in your checking account!!"

"I just had to come by," grinned the guy, "to thank you for the
most wonderful weekend of my life!"

a weekend in the forest, hunting bear.
 They hired a log cabin, and when they got there, took 
their backpacks off and put them inside.
 At which point the salesman said to the systems analyst:
 "You unpack while I go and find us a bear."
 The analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat 
outside to await events. He did not have to wait too long.
 Soon he could hear noises in the forest. The noises got 
nearer - and suddenly there was the salesman, running 
across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the 
largest and most ferocious Brown Bears the analyst had 
ever seen.
 "Open the door! shouted the salesman.
 The analyst opened the door.
 The salesman ran to the door, suddenly stopped, and 
stepped aside.
 The Bear carried by its momentum, continued though the 
door and disappeared inside.
 The salesman promptly shut the door on it, turned, looked 
at the analyst, and said:
 "Ok, you skin that one while I go rustle us up another."

	A distinguished-looking man entered a Geneva bank and inquired
	about taking out a loan for 1000 Swiss francs.

	  "What security can you offer?" the banker asked.

	"My Rolls-Royce is parked out front," he said. "I will be away
	for a few weeks.  Here are the keys."

	A month later, the man returned to the bank and paid off the loan,
	1017 francs with interest.

	   "Pardon me for asking," the banker said, "but why a one-thousand
	    franc loan for a man of your obvious means?"

	"Very simple," he replied.  "Where else can you store a Rolls for
	 a month for seventeen francs?"

As told by Peter Ludwig of Austria at the National Cave Rescue Commission

How do you tell an Optimist from a Pessimist?
An optimist feels that in 20 years a pair of shoes will cost only 100 marks.
A pessimist feels that in 20 years a pair of shoes will cost only 100 rubles.

[ This one is interesting because many of the things listed have already
taken place. -ed ]

For years people have been predicting that Usenet will collapse.  Like
the ancient Roman civilization, there will be indicators of this impending
collapse, when it nears. These will include:

Somebody other than Henry Spencer will post from utzoo.

Utzoo will be upgraded in cpu and/or operating system (from an 11/44 runn
version 7)

Seizmo will cease to exist, cutting off the east coast.

Decwrl's Usenet readership data will expire, because nobody there reads
news anymore.

The line eater will re-appear.
(note: it has appeared on Bitnet, but looks a lot like the 'last card in
the reader' problem)

Bitnet will stop truncating files at 80 characters, eliding trailing
blanks and translating ASCII to funky characters.

Ihnp4 will become reliable.

Eugene Myia will start saying "Don't send me mail -- follow up!"

Bob Webber will do something GOOD for the network.

The Brahms Gang will do something GOOD for the network.

Eric Mading will core dump.

Talk.Bizarre will drop from the volume ratings.

The alt.* subnet will be absorbed into the main network with no protests
>From either parties.

Mailing lists on Bitnet and the Internet will cease to exist, being
replaced with a news-like interface thus doing away with the random
"Please add me to your list" postings.

Gene Spafford will stop posting his monthly group lists.

There will be NO April Fools pranks pulled.

Today marks the first birthday of rec.humor.funny.  Thanks to all my
submitters for a funny year, and thanks to the readers, too.
(Please don't mail to thank me, the 700 Poll responses were enough.)

My only disappointment is that the group still shows only 85% propagation
on the net surveys.  If your site doesn't get the group yet ...
then how the hell are you reading this?  But seriously, since this group
does have one of the best volume/readership ratios around, I'm not sure
of the origin of this figure.

Now might be a good time to review the posting regs, but I think I'll wait
until after vacation time is over for a full scale review.  Quick reminder:
	a) No form feeds
	b) ONE joke per submission, with an informative subject
	c) Mail rather than post the jokes (It's hard to reply to posted stuff)
	d) I reply to every submission, but about 25% of these replies bounce
	e) Do not rotate what you send me, it's annoying.
	f) Please tell me where you heard it, and tell me if you wrote it.
	   I am more lenient with original stuff.
	g) I believe the U.S.'s founding fathers intended to make a system
	   where you could get off on technicalities.
	h) There is no rule 6.
	i) BMW stands for "I'm a frayed not."
	j) Gestation is a bitch, and then you're born.
	h) Don't send me stuff from rec.humor.

	Little Willie had a gambling problem. He'd bet on anything.
	One day, Willie's father consulted his teacher.
	The teacher said. "Mr.Gaines, I think I know how to teach Willie
	a real lesson. We'll trap him into a big wager that he'll lose."
	Willie's father agreed to cooperate with the plan.
        The next day at school, the teacher watched Willie making wagers 
	with the other children, and she said, "Willie, I want you
	to remain after class."  When the others had left the 
	classroom, Willie walked up to the teacher. Before she could
	say a word, he said, " Dont say it, Miss B; I know what you're
	going to say, but you're a liar!"
	"Willie!" the startled teacher said." What are you talking about?"

        you tell me? You've got this blond hair on top, but I've seen
        your bush and it's pitch black!"
        Trying to keep her cool, the teacher said, "Willie that isn't 
        true."
        "I'll bet a dollar it is !" Willie challenged.
        The teacher saw her chance to teach Willie his lesson."Make
        it five dollars and you have a bet," she said.
  	"You're on!" Willie whipped out a five dollar bill. Before anyone
	could come into the room, Miss B. dropped her panties, spread her
	legs, and showed Willie that her pubic hair was as blond as the
	hair on top of her head.
	Willie hung his head. "You win," he said, handing her the fiver.
	Miss. B couldn't wait for him to leave so she could get to a phone to 
	call his father. She reported what had happened. "Mr. Gaines,"

>From an article in the Globe & Mail, Jul 26, written by Bryan Johnson, in
Pakistan:

     First he tells of a pilot who spotted tracer bullets as he approached
a runway in Norhtern Pakistan.  So the pilot swung around and approached
the runway from the other end only to find bullets winging by there too.
So he tried to land on a road and cracked up.
	
	From whence came the bullets?  Afghan rebels?  Terrorists?  No,
just "one hell of a wedding party."  In the Peshawar region, wedding 
guests can rent an AK-47 for a day for $2 or the use of a water buffalo.
With tragic results.  In one case, "jubilant" cousins accidentily
"blasted away" the bridegroom's father.  The wedding was postponed for 40 
days of mourning, then again celebrated amid "ecstatic volleys of flying
lead."

	In another wedding in the region, shots from a wedding severed
high tension electrical wires, the falling wires electrocuted 8 guests and
set parts of the village on fire.  As well there have been sevearl injuries
to people not even attending the weddings who happen into the path of a

A computer salesman, a hardware engineer, and a software engineer are driving
in a car together. Suddenly the right rear tire blows out, ahd the car rolls
to a stop. Our three heroes pile out to investigate.

The salesman tsk-tsks sadly. "Time to buy a new car!" he announces.

Says the hardware engineer, "Well, first let's try swapping the front and
rear tires, and see if that fixes it."

Replies the software engineer, "Naw, let's just try driving the car again,
and maybe the problem will go away by itself."

fact that in many languages, such as English, a double negative forms
a positive, while in other languages, such as Russian, a double negative

     I am writing this on the morning following an event of great national
shock.  The Republicans have chosen Dan Quayle as the Vice-Presidential
candidate.  Quayle is a young man, 41, and part of the interpretation is that
the party wants to appeal to the Baby Boomer generation.  This is a colossal
miscalculation in this commentator's opinion.  I know.  I am from the Baby
Boomer generation myself.  (Okay, let's say late in the Baby Boomer generation,
very, very late, okay?)  I can tell you most of this generation are people who
are getting along but haven't hit it big.  Some of us even ride garbage trucks
or clerk in stores.  It's not going to appeal to us to see that had we played
our cards differently we could have been Vice-Presidential candidates by now.
That's more for people maybe twenty years or so older, we tell ourselves.  Now
this thing happens and every Baby Boomer has to face the fact that some slob
our age--or in my case somewhat over--is making it big.  And there are other
similarities.  Quayle's family owned newspapers.  My family owned newspapers.
The difference is my family kept ours stacked under the cellar steps; his
family published them, so didn't have to keep them under the steps.  In any
case, this is all very sobering news and I hope the Republicans are prepared
for the kind of backlash they will get from us politically-aware Baby Boomers.

                                        Mark R. Leeper

[ What I want to know is, what's Quayle got against Canada??  If he wanted
  to dodge the war, we have a perfectly good country up here he could have
  visited.  Does he have a secret foreign policy agenda we don't know about? ]

TEN REASONS WHY NEW YORKERS PREFER BEACHES IN NEW YORK STATE.
-------------------------------------------------------------


10)  It really feels at home swimming in sewage.

9) You can improve your arithmetic by counting the rats that float
   by.

8) Studies have shown that shark repellent is no substitute for high
   bacterial levels.

7) The shellfish truly come in interesting shapes and designs.

6) The Iranian revolutionary guards have planted mines only in the
   Persian Gulf.

5) The dolphins are so friendly that they wash up on the beach to make
   place for you and your kids in the ocean.

4) With these dangerous epidemics in the air, it MUST be safer in the
   water.

3) In case of emergencies, medical AIDS are never more than an
   arms-length away.

2) Mario Cuomo performs his daily ablutions in the ocean
   and the Democrats haven't as yet washed away.

1) Ed Koch swims at Cape Cod.

		  by Phil Ochs		[annotated for Danforth Quayle]


Oh I am just a typical American boy	[with a filthy rich grandpa]
> from a typical American town		[where my daddy runs the newspaper]
I believe in God and Senator Dodd
and keeping old Castro down.		[not to mention Daniel Ortega]
And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red,		[or is it better red than dead?]
but when I got to my old draft board,
buddy this is what I said.		[for I was already in the Nat'l Guard]

Sarge I'm only 18, I got a ruptured spleen	[my father made a few calls]
and I always carry a purse;
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat	[friends made some more calls]
and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes think of my career and my sweetheart dear	[America needs more lawyers!]
and my poor old invalid aunt;
besides I ain't no fool I'm going to school	[Even as a teenager I loved the
and I'm working in a defense plant.		 military-industrial complex]

I got a dislocated disk & a racked up back	[My daddy made me carry the
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs;		 entire circulation one day]
when the bombshell hits I get epileptic fits
and I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.		[the Dukakis campaign knows
I got the weakness woes I can't touch my toes	 I smoked pot in law school]
I can hardly reach my knees;
and if the enemy came close to me		[I've always been allergic
I'd probably start to sneeze.			 to slanteye communists]

I hate Chou Enlai and I hope he dies,		[now I love Deng Xioping]
but one thing you gotta see:
that someone's gotta go over there		[why can't the poor go fight?]
and that someone isn't me.			[you bet-- my daddy's rich]
So I wish you well, Sarge give 'em hell,
kill me a thousand or so;			[torture a few Nicaraguans too]
if you ever get a war without blood and gore
I'll be the first to go.			[that's why I support SDI!]

Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, are frequently quite affectionate in public.
Reporters asked D. if he thought that Bush and his wife would have to
behave more affectionately in response.

Dukakis responded that to his knowledge most democrats preferred double
beds, while most republicans preferred two singles.  After a pause he
said , ``Maybe that's why there are more democrats.''

So there's this magician working on a small cruise ship. He's been doing his
routines every night for a year or two now. The audiences appreciate him, and
they change over often enough that he doesn't have to worry too much about
new tricks. However, there's this parrot who sits in the back row and watches
him night after night, year after year. Finally, the parrot figures out how
the tricks work and starts giving it away for the audience. For example, when
the magician makes a bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squaks "Behing
his back! Behind his back!" Well, the magician get really annoyed at this,
but he doesn't know what to do. The parrot belongs to the Captain, so he
can't just kill it.

One day, the ship springs a leak and sinks. The magician manages to swim to a
plank of wood floating by and grabs on. The parrot is sitting on the other
end of the plank. The just stare at each other and drift. They drift for 3
days and still don't speak. On the morning of the fourth day, the parrot
looks over at the magician and says: "OK, I give up. Where did you hide the
ship?"

	This morning, one of our users told me of something he'd read
about businesses and UNIX.  It appears that many businesses are buying
UNIX rather than VMS (thereby annoying DEC) because of it's simplicity
in generating reports and other day-to-day business applications.

	He was wondering if we could get this wonderfully simple UNIX, to
replace the complicated and confusing UNIX we currently have.

[ A fellow named Bill Pfieffer, an engineer in Portland, OR, told me these
   jokes; Bill is an imigrant from West Germany, and German humor has always
   been a little different from ours. ]

 In the Bundeswehr (West German army) a company of soldiers decided to have
some fun with their company cook, a short, fat, very un-martial young man.
So every morning before he woke up, one of them would defecate into his boot.
The amazing thing was that the cook accepted this treatment silently. Every
morning he would clean out his boot and go to work as if nothing was wrong.

 After several weeks of this, the soldiers began to tire of the game; it
wasn't very much fun because the cook never reacted, and they were beginning
to feel guilty as well. So they sent a delegation to apologize to him and
promise to mend their ways.

 The cook heard them out, then said "You are going to stop shitting in my
boots? Fine, then I will stop pissing in your coffee".

New Programmer's Editor for the Amiga
-------------------------------------

Hot on the heels of Apple Computer's release of HyperCard is a new concept
in interactive text editors from Obscure Technologies Inc., named PunchEd.
For those wondering what HyperCard is, it's a new `metaphor' in human-computer
interaction, in which data, be they text, music or pictures, are represented
by a hierarchy of `index cards' which the user can activate or browse through 
by using mouse-sensitive gadgets.  Obscure Technologies has, as their promo-
tional literature states, contracted (not expanded) on the HyperCard idea in
their new programmer's editor, PunchEd.   In PunchEd, the visual metaphor 
presented to the user is that of a stack of punched paper cards, just like
those used extensively in the computer industry since the 1950s and with which
the company believes real programmers will feel more comfortable than with
full-screen text editors.

The cards can be viewed on the screen individually, or several can be
viewed spread out simultaneously (a process referred to as `fanning').  Like 
HyperCard, PunchEd allows the user to browse, or `riffle', through his or her 
`stack' of cards using the mouse.  Users must exercise some caution when 
riffling, since there is a chance that they could experience a `stack drop', 
where the carefully-arranged cards become hopelessly jumbled.  This reviewer 
somehow managed to perform a stack drop, an operation only slightly less 
frustrating than getting a stack overflow.  Fortunately, PunchEd provides
a `shuffle' command for getting things back in order again. There is also a 
facility whereby a previously entered card can be duplicated with a single
keystroke - quite a time-saver.  Other basic editor features, such as entering 
text, are also provided.  One small problem, however, is that there is no 
backspacing capability, so in order to correct your text, you must retype the 
offending line onto a new card and remove the old one.  Some users will, I'm 
sure, appreciate this attention to detail.

The feature of PunchEd that will probably make it a big success in the 
eyes of programmers is that command text can be included in the same file as 
the source code.  Goodbye, Make!  With the inclusion of a few simple cards at
the beginning of your file you can specify all the processing control you 
need.  For example, to compile and link your C program, just include the 
following:

//MYPROG JOB NAME=HELLO,CLASS=C
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=CC,PARM=(-S,+L)
//INCLUDE DD DSNAME=INCLUDE/STDIO.H,UNIT=DF0,DISP=SHR
//STEP2 EXEC PGM=LN
//STEPLIB DD DSNAME=C.LIB,UNIT=LIB,DISP=SHR
//* start of program
//*
main()
{
	printf("hello, world\n");
}

An 80-year old man read in the paper that someone had saved a life by
signing an organ donor card.  The man felt this was a noble thing to
do so he called the organ donor organization to see if he could get
a card.  Unfortuneatly, he was told that he was too old to donate his
organs when he died.  The lady at the organization did tell him that if
he wanted to give life in another way that he could go to the sperm bank
 - they take anyone of any age.  Rather pleased, the man went to the 
sperm bank.  After filling out the obligatory forms, the receptionist 
gave him a jar and pointed to a little room and said *You can go in 
there to donate, thank you*.  So the man went in and closed the door and
in a moment the receptionist heard this loud moaning and groaning.  She
felt a little embarrassed for the old man but did nothing.  The moaning 
and groaning continued for 20 minutes and finally she knocked on the door
and asked if the old man was all right.

The old man came out and said, *I'm really sorry.  I tried it with my left
hand, then I tried it with my right hand, then I tried it with both hands,
but I can't get the DAMN LID OFF THE JAR!!!

	I had an interesting Saturday night. With a group of friends I went to a

amounts of Emu Export. Come closing time me and a mate have had enough so ratherthan go nightclubbing in town we decide to catch a taxi home, but the fleet's in
so a cab is either full of marine's spew or horney sailors. It's a clear night 
so we decide to hitch back from Herdsmans Park to my home in Scarborough 
( about 8 km ), no problem.
	But consider this: would you stop for two six foot, more than slightly
drunk uni students in the wee small hours of the morn'? Funny that, nobody else
did either. But with more than half the distance covered and being bitterly coldwe spied food, sanctuary. So we rocked up to the girlie behind the counter and
asked, ( in a druken slurr ) "Do you do home deliveries?  One thin ham & 
pineapple pizza with garlic bread to be delivered in Scarborough."
	And we got home in time to watch "Barbarella" on tele' too.

Editors Note:

	Here it is folks, the oneliner file.  Over the past year, I have
	received several short submissions that were mildly funny, but
	not quite good enough or topical enough to merit their own posting.
	I have collected them all for you, and it's time to flush the
	buffer.  These vary in quality quite a bit, and are not rated.

	Please don't take this as an invitation to send me your own
	favourite one liners.  There are thousands of these things in
	the world, and I don't have time to sift through them except on
	an infrequent basis.  Remember, one joke per submission.

	My advice is to read this file slowly if you can, one joke at a
	time.  Oneliner jokes are often ruined if read together in
	a bunch.

A couple decide to see a movie.  They arrive just before show time and
the theater is quite full.  As they walk down the aisle and their eyes
adjust to the dim light, they see only a few empty seats.  To one side,
they find a man sprawled across three seats.  After a nervous pause,
one of them says to the man:

"Excuse me, there are very few seats left, and we would appreciate 
 it if you would sit up."

The man, rolling his eyes, replies:

"Eeeryarrrgh ooouwaaaah uuummmpphhhhh"

[Edited]
>From article <6907@jhunix.HCF.JHU.EDU> in soc.culture.indian:

		GURKHAS - THE MARTIAL RACE

Now that an accord has been signed between the GNLF of
Subhash ( not the go back to India one :-)) Ghising and the
Government of India, it might be appropriate to recollect
an interesting anecdote regarding these doughty warriors.

In World war II, an English reporter who had heard so much
about the bravery and elan of the Gurkhas visited a camp just
in front of the enemy lines (Germans).  During the course of
his reporting, he had occasion to observe a mission being
conducted.  The mission was to airdrop a bunch of soldiers behind
enemy lines to conduct some relatively light action.  He watched
the commander of the Gurkhas (a British soldier) pitch
the mission and then ask for volunteers.  To his surprise,
only about half the Gurkhas volunteered and were sent off.
Throughly disillusioned with the legends of Gurkha bravery,
the reporter went back home.  After the war, he happened to
run into a Gurkha who had been there, and asked him why
half the troops had failed to volunteer.  It turned
out that none of the squad, both those who volunteered and those
who did not, were aware that they would get a parachute for the drop.
Hence the low turnout.

        A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a leash.  He

        The bartender says "Sorry sir.  You can't bring that alligator in
        here!  It's a dangerous animal, and you're scaring all of the patrons!
        True enough, the man looked around, and noticed that everyone was
        standing on the tables, looking very nervous.

        "But wait!" he cried, "this alligator is tame!  It wouldn't hurt
        anyone!".  However, the bartender is adamant.  "If", the man
        continues, "I can prove that this alligator is not vicious, can he
        stay?".

        "Well, I guess so", says the bartender, "however, you're going to
        have a devil of a time proving to everyone in here that that al-
        ligator is tame!"

        The man smiles, and leans over the alligator. "Ralph!", he shouts,
        "Sit up!"  With that, he beats the alligator on the head with his
        fist "BANG BANG BANG".  And the alligator rears up on its tail.
        "Ralph, open your mouth! BANG BANG BANG".  And the alligator opened
        it's huge mouth wide, revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth.
        The man pulls out his wang, and lays it in the alligators mouth, as
        the entire bar crowd gasps.  "Raplph! Close your mouth, but DON'T
        BITE! BANG BANG BANG".  As the man pummels the alligator on the
        head, the giant mouth slowley closes, and stops juuuussttt short of
        biting the guys dick off.  The crowd sighs, and the man says "Ralph,

Subject: A Math Teacher's Story
Keywords: true, chuckle
Date: 21 Sep 88 15:30:03 GMT

Years ago, I was taking an algebra class over the summer,
and had a teacher who liked to reminisce about his past with funny stories.
He relates that he had been a math teacher in the Air Force, where it was
his duty to force sleepy young recruits to stay awake for an hour of math
at 8:00 in the morning in a large, warm, dimly-lit auditorium.  One day,
he came into the auditorium and saw his class even sleepier and less attentive
than usual.  He realized that something drastic would have to be done.

Now this classroom was *very* old, and the blackboards, which had been nailed on
to the walls with old black iron nails, had become loose over the years.  As 
a result, these black nails jutted almost invisibly from the blackboard and
this teacher kept banging his hands on them while erasing the board.  He decided
to put them to good use.

With enough of a flourish to guarantee the class's attention, he went to the
front of the room, near one edge of the board.  Then, clearing his throat,
he drew a coathook right near one of the protruding nails.  He proceeded to 
hang his coat and hat on the hook that he had drawn in chalk (really
on the nail, of course).  Then he went on to give that day's lecture.  He told
us that the entire class had their eyes to the front of the room throughout the
lecture.  He didn't know if they'd heard a single word he'd said, but at least
they looked attentive.

At the end of the class, the lecturer would usually leave by a small door near the 
blackboards, while the class would leave through the large doors at the back of
the hall.  When class was over, he took his coat and hat, erased the coathook,
and left through the small door--and was followed by the entire class, lining up to 
go past the blackboard to see how he'd done it.

	Joan, the rather well-proportioned secretary, spent almost all of

the frist day, but on the second, she decided that no one could see her
way up there, and she slipped out of it for an overall tan.  She'd hardly
begun when she heard someone running up the stairs; she was lying on her
stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear.
	"Excuse me, miss," said the flustered little assistant manager of
the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs.  "The Hilton doesn't
mind your sunbathing on the roof, but we would very much appreciate your
wearing a bathing suit as you did yesterday."
	"What difference does it make," Joan asked rather calmly.  "No one
can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel."

                        The Preying Mantis Syndrome

Many lower life forms demonstrate qualities that, at first, don't seem
very good for survival.  For instance, the female praying mantis, after mating
with, well, her mate, will devour him.  For the male praying mantis, however,
it is a catch-22.  If he mates, he gets screwed out of an opportunity to mate
again.  If he doesn't mate, he doesn't reproduce and that is the end of his
family tree (not that all insects live in trees, mind you).  This suicidal
behavior is commonly called the Preying Mantis Syndrome - and many life forms
are periodically subject to it's wrath.  How did the preying mantis become 
stuck in such a vicious cycle?  This is probably what happened beforehand:

  The male mantis arrives at the residence of the female mantis.  After some
courtship exercises (dinner, a movie, inserting the diaphram) they mate.  The
female mantis, her lust for...lust being satisfied relaxes while the Male raids
the refrigerator and returns home.  This behavior continues until the male and
female (mantissas?) establish a permanent relationship.  Then the male
establishes a new pattern of behavior:  Football on Mondays, baseball on
Tuesdays, happy hour on Wednesdays, Uh, working-late-at-the-office on Thursdays,
and bowling on Fridays.  The female tolerates this to a certain extent, then
files for a divorce.  After a long battle, she retires to her alimony-paid
home with a lesson well learned:  It simplifies matters tremendously to just
eat him when you're done with him.

  Well, through the process of evolution, the Preying Mantis Syndrome is
carried up into the highest life forms, even humans.  That is why, one week
out of every month, the female of the species will feel compelled to bite the
head off the male.  The Preying Mantis Syndrome is inescapable, but when it
occurs in the female of our species, it's best to just avoid them for a while.

				   HEADQUARTERS
				  LAST U.S. ARMY
				APO 001. U.S. ARMY

AG 4110.99 (DEBCA)					20 September 1944

SUBJECT	:  Indoctrination for Return to U.S.

TO	:  All Units.


1.  In compliance with current policies for rotation of armed forces overseas
it is directed that in order to maintain the high standard of character of the
American Soldier and to prevent any dishonor to reflect on the uniform all
individuals eligible for return to the U.S.  under current directives will
undergo an indoctrination course of demilitarisation prior to approval of his
application for return.

2.  The following points will be emphasized in the subject indoctrination
course:-

a.  In America there is a remarkable number of beautiful girls.  These young
ladies have not been liberated and many are gainfully employed as
stenographers, sales girls, beauty operators or welders.  Contrary to current
practice they should not be approached with "How much?".  A proper greeting is
"Isn't it a lovely day?" or "Have you ever been to Chicago?".  Then say "How
much?".

b.  A guest in a private home is usually awakened in the morning by a light
tapping on his door, and an invitation to join the host at breakfast.  It is
proper to say "I'll be there shortly".  DO NOT say "Blow it out your _____".

c.  A typical American breakfast consists of such strange foods as cantolopes,
fresh eggs, milk, ham, etc.  These are highly palatable and though strange in
appearance are extremely tasty.  Butter, made from cream, is often served.  If
you wish some butter, you turn to the person nearest it and say quietly "Please
pass the butter".  DO NOT say "Threw me the godam grease".

d.  Very natural urges are apt to occur when in a crowd.  If it is found
necessary to defecate, one does NOT grab a shovel in one hand and paper in the
other and run for the garden.  At least 90% of American homes have one room
called the "Bathroom", i.e.  a room that, in most cases, contains a bathtub,
wash basin, medicine cabinet, and a toilet.  It is the latter that you will use
in this case.  (Instructors should make sure that all personnel understand the
operation of toilet, particularly the lever or button arrangement that serves
to prepare the device for reuse).

e.  In the event the helmet is retained by the individual, he will refrain from
using it as a chair, wash bowl, foot bath or bathtub.  All these devices are
furnished in the average American Home.  It is not considered good practice to
squat Indian fashion in a corner in the event all chairs are occupied.  The
host usually will provide suitable seats.

f.  Belching or passing wind in company is strictly frowned upon.  If you
should forget about it, however, and belch in the presence of others, a proper
remark is "Excuse me".  DO NOT say "It must be that lousy chew we've been
getting".

g.  American dinners, in most cases, consist of several items, each served in a
separate dish.  The common practice of mixing various items, such as corn-beef
and pudding, or lima beans and peaches, to make it more palatable will be
refrained from.  In time the "Separate Dish" system will become enjoyable.

h.  Americans have a strange taste for stimulants.  The drinks in common usage
on the Continent, such as underripe wine, alcohol and grapefruit juice, or
gasoline bitters and water (commonly known by the French as "Cognac") are not
usually acceptable in civilian circles.  A suitable use for such drinks is for
serving one's landlord in order to break an undesirable lease.

i.  The returning soldier is apt to find often that his opinions differ from
those of his civilian associates.  One should call upon his reserve etiquette
and correct his acquaintance with such remarks as "I believe you have made a
mistake", or "I am afraid you are in error on that".  DO NOT say "Brother,
you're really f----d up".  This is considered impolite.

j.  Upon leaving a friend's home after a visit, one may find his hat
misplaced.  Frequently it has been placed in a closet.  One should turn to
one's host and say "I don't seem to have my hat.  Could you help me find it?".
DO NOT say "Don't anybody leave this room, some S.O.B.  has stolen my hat".

k.  In traveling in the U.S., particularly in a strange city, it is often
necessary to spend the night.  Hotels are provided for this purpose and almost
anyone can give directions to the hearest hotel.  Here, for a small sum, you
can register and be shown to a room where he can sleep for the night.  The
present practice of entering the nearest house, throwing the occupants into the
yard and taking over the premises will cease.

l.  Whiskey, a common American drink, may be offered to the soldier on social
occasions.  It is considered a reflection on the uniform to snatch the bottle
> from the hostess and drain the bottle, cork and all.  All individuals are
cautioned to exercise extreme control in these circumstances.

m.  In motion picture theaters seats are provided.  Helmets are not required.
In is NOT considered good form to whistle every time a female over 8 and under
80 crosses the screen.  If vision is impaired by the person in the seat in
front, there are plenty of other seats which can be occupied.  DO NOT hit him
across the back of the head and say "Move your head, jerk, I can't see a damn
thing".

n.  It is not proper to go around hitting everyone of draft age in civilian
clothes.  He might have been released from the service for medical reasons.
Ask for his credentials, and if he can't show any THEN go ahead and slug him.

o.  Upon retiring, one will often find a pair of pajamas laid out on the bed.
(Pajamas, it should be explained, are two-piece garments which are donned after
all clothing has been removed.) The soldier, confronted by these garments,
should assume an air of familiarity and not act as though he were not used to
them.  A casual remark such as "My, what a delicate shade of blue" will usually
suffice.  Under NO circumstances say "How in hell do you expect me to sleep in
a get-up like that?".

p.  Natural functions will continue.  It may frequently be necessary to
urinate.  DO NOT walk behind the nearest tree or automobile you find to
accomplish this.  Toilets (see 2d above) are provided in all public buildings
for this purpose.

q.  Beer is sometimes served in bottles.  A cap remover is usually available,
and it is not good form to open the bottle by the use of one's teeth.

r.  Always tip your hat before striking a lady.

s.  Air raids and enemy patrols are not encountered in America.  Therefore it
is not necessary to wear the helmet in church or at social gatherings, or to
hold the weapon at ready, loaded and cooked, when talking to civilians in the
street.

t.  Every American home and all hotels are equipped with bathing facilities.
When it is desired to take a bath, it is not considered good form to find the
nearest pool or stream, strip down, and indulge in a bath.  This is
particularly true in heavily populated areas.

u.  All individuals returning to the U.S.  will make every effort to conform to
the customs and habits of the regions visited, and to make themselves as
inconspicuous as possible.  Any actions which reflect upon the honor of the
uniform will be promptly dealt with.

[ Recently in comp.misc, users started describing how they had put floppies
through their paces, and yet still found them readable.  Some folks decided
the discussion got out of hand, and I enjoyed this one. ]

That reminds me of the time , a few years ago when I left home with my 5"
master floppy in my pocket.  Suddenly a gust of wind blew it into the road
where it was run over by a passing millitary parade and it ended up in
a patch of quick-drying cement.

When I retrieved it the cement had set so I took it home to recover as I'd lost
the backup some days previously.  I chiselled off the cement from the disc but 
then my friend came along and suggested that, as the disc was 'dead', we should
see how much damage it could take.

We nailed it to the ceiling, and hung the cat from it, then used it at a dart-
board, incidentally did you know that if you're a good aim, a dart will exactly fit through the index hole?  By now the disc was a little bit grubby so we care-fully opened the black jacket, removed the disc and  washed it in boiling water,
making good use of the brillo pads.  After drying it with my blowtorch I tried
it in my disc drive.

Nothing happened for a few seconds and then a wisp of smoke slowly rose from theslot.  grabbing the disc and stamping out the flames I realised I had placed it in my toaster instead of a drive.  I found a 3" drive but unfortunately the discwouldn't fit so I had to cut off the edges until it did.  Tentatively I tried toboot and...

Imagine my surprise when it worked!  all my files were readable, except for the
ones stored in the bits I cut off to make it fit the drive.

This really happened.  I concluded that it only went to show.

Has this happened to anyone else?

fair amount of damage is done, although neither is hurt. It's

They both get out. One is a doctor, one is a lawyer. The lawyer calls
the police on his car phone; they'll be there in 20 minutes.

It's cold and damp, and both men are shaken up. The laywer offers
the doctor a drink of brandy from his hip flask, the doctor accepts,
drinks and hands it back to the laywer, who puts it away.

``Arnt you going to have a drink ?'' the doctor says.

( some parts have been censored ;-)

	Cemetary Plot, No. XXX, C of E Section,
	XXXXXXXX Cemetary, $150. Phone XXX XXXX

I wondered if it was used or if the seller had decided not to go after all.

	A ventriloquist in a nightclub is telling a series of [ethnic]
jokes.  He plays straight man while the little dummy on his knee poses
the riddles and answers questions.  After many of these, a doddering
old man gets up from his chair and shouts, "Will you just knock it off!"
Everyone in the room turns to look and the ventriloquist stops.  "I'm
just sick and tired of all these idiodic [ethnic] jokes that try to
make [ethnic]s look so stupid!  'How many [ethnics] does it take to
screw in a lightbulb?'...  'There was an Italian, a Jew and an [ethnic]...'
and so on!  Well just stop it, because we [ethnics] proud of our
heritage, our contribution to civilization and the great intellects
we have produced!"  The club is silent as the old man sits down
angrily.  Finally, the ventriloquist, in a conciliatory tone, says,
"Sir, I am really sorry to cause such an offense.  I really didn't 
intend to hurt anybody's feelings at all.  I just want everyone to
have a nice time and enjoy themselves, and the last thing I want
to do is make someone upset.  Would you accept my apology?"
The old man gets up suddenly and exclaims, "It's not *you* I'm
talking to, you fool, it's that little bastard on your knee!!"

I heard this joke from a friend, and he attributed it to another friend.
This is purported to be a true quotation.

Prior to the World Championships in Rome, Ben Johnson was asked whether
he would prefer a gold medal or a world record.  He said that he would
prefer a gold medal because "no one can ever take it away from me."

I heard this one from a dissident that our local Amnesty International
group got out:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through the center of Czechoslovakia there a train speeding along.  In one 
compartment of the train there are four people.  A beautiful vivacious young
woman, an old matronly woman, a Russian soldier, and a Czech dissident.

Suddenly the train goes through a tunnel.

It is completely dark.

Then is heard a loud kiss and an equally powerful slap.

When the train exits the tunnel, the Russian soldier is holding the side of his
face, and the Czech dissident is grinning his face off.

The old matronly woman thinks : "Now that's a fine young woman, the Russian 
     soldier tries to steal a kiss in the tunnel and the lady slaps him one!"

The young woman is thinking : "Now that's a strange Russian soldier, he'd 
     rather kiss that old hag than me."

The Russian soldier is thinking : "Now that's a smart Czech, he steal the kiss
     and I get slapped."

And the Czech dissident is thinking : "Gee I'm smart!  We go through the
     tunnel, I kiss the back of my hand and get away with slapping a
     Russian soldier."

Four corporate presidents, one English, one French, one Japanese and one
American, were on their way to an international business conference when
they were kidnaped by terrorists and taken to a secret hideout.

"You, you compaines and you countries are enemies of the Revolution," screamed
the terrorist leader, "and you're going to be executed!  Do you have any last
requests?"

The Englishman spoke first.

"Before I die, I want to honor my contry and protest this barbaric act by
singing "God Save The Queen" to all you men."

That can be arranged," said the terrorist.

The Frenchman said, "And I want to honor MY country before I die by singing
"The Marseilles" to your men."

The Japanese said, "Before I die, I wish to honor MY country by giving the 
lecture I was going to present on the Mapanese style of industrial management."

The terrorist turned finally to the American.

"What is YOUR last request?"

The American replied, "I want you to kill me right now so I don't have to

Being a Dodgers fan, I realize that I should heed the predictions of 
Nostradamus and know that the A's will lose to the Dodgers. In the book 
"Nostradamus: The Missing Quatrains" is the prediction:

   And in the Eighth year of the Incompetent One
   The Men of the Smog shall vanquish the Men of the Oak
   In a war fought seven battles long
   And defeat the Athletic Men strong

   And the Men of the Smog shall fight in the West
   A fierce war of seven battles against the Bay Men
   And the sphere shall meet the stick many times
   And the unruly northern supporters shall have many fines

   And in the final section of the seventh battle
   A great earthquake shall have the sphere struck over a wall
   And the great Athletic Ones shall not recover the sphere
   And Southern Men shall win the series by one run clear

(This is a semi-original work.  iccdev!mark originally posted something 
similar in talk.rumors back in May about the NBA championships.  I made

	 Sleazonia, Ont. 3N7 N5S
	 
	1/2-sided, sloppy-sectored, 5 3/8 inch droopy disk. 39 cents.
	 
	 
	As you might expect from this program's name and price, it's a
	bare-bones, no-frills word processor package.  What does 'bare bones'
	mean?  For one thing, you don't get multiple screens - in fact, you get
	no screens at all.  Joe, the program's writer, claims that in about six
	months an update (19 cents) will be available that'll give the program
	video-display capabilities.  In the meantime, you'll simply have to
	remember what you key in. 
	 
	Another upgrade will enable you to type upper-case characters and
	numbers greater than seven.  But don't let these seemingly negative
	comments dissuade you from buying the program.  In reality, the 39 cent
	price makes it good value for the money.  You can for, example, use the
	disk as a coaster for large beer mugs. 
	 
	What are the program's good points?  It contains a 3-word spelling
	correction program called (predictably) MediocreSpeller.  If you
	misspell the words A, AND, or THE, it causes your computer to shut off
	and locks the disk drive head on track 42. 
	 
	MediocreWriter's documentation is in keeping with the program's other
	annoying features.  It consists of a barely legible mimeographed sheet
	with the following insruction's on it:
	 
	 * Turn computer on
	 * Insert disk
	 * Use program
	 
	The program is not copy protected.
	
	Explains Joe: 'Who would want to copy it?' And it takes little memory
	space: 323 bytes.  It's available for the Lemming/dos operating system
	for use on Joe's PC (available from Joe for $9.95). 
	 
	 
	ASST. SYSOP'S COMMENTS:
	 
	In short, MediocreWriter is Joe's latest attempt to write software that
	works.  It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: the
	sleeziest, most limited, bug-ridden word-processing program that exists.
	
	Joe admits, 'it stinks.' In addition to its lack of a video-display
	capability, it has a tendency to set computers on fire and trigger
	nearby automatic washing machines.  It handles 21 lower-case alphabetic
	characters and numbers from one to six; punctuation is limited to the
	exclamation point. 
	 
	The program is interactive with Joe's other two packages: Lousycalc, a
	1-column, 1-row spreadsheet; and RottenFiler, a database-management
	program that accepts one entry.  In short, I like it! 
	 
	DETAILS: List price, 39 cents.  Available only for Lemming/DOS on Joe's
	PC ($9.95); configured to drive Joe's Smudge-Matrix Printer.
	($14.95).

           I Have Noticed

    Everthing is farther away than it used to be.  It is even twice as far to
the corner and they have added a hill.  I have given up running for the
bus; it leaves earlier than it used to.
    It seems to me they are making the stairs steeper than in the old
days.  And have you noticed the smaller print they use in the newspapers?
    There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as
everbody speaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them.
    The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the
hips and waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one's shoelaces.
And the sizes don't run the way they used to.  The 12's and 14's are so
much smaller.
    Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used
to be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much
older than I am.
    I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so much
that she didn't recognize me.
    I got to thinking about the poor dear while I was combing my hair
this morning and in so doing I glanced at my own reflection.  Really
now, they don't even make good mirrors like they used to.

This is a case of law found in a West Law digest.  This is an actual
case heard by the Michigan court of appeals (Fisher v. Low, 333 N.W.2d 67)
that was recently shown to me by somebody at school (after a long time
being a software engineer I started evening law school).  I thought
it was funny...you be the judge.

Court of Appeals of Michigan
Docket No. 60732

A wayward Chevy struck a tree
whose owner sued defendants three.
He sued car's owner, driver too,
and insurer for what was his due.
For his oak tree that now may bear
a lasting need for tender care.
the Oakland County Circuit court,
John O' Brian, J., set forth
the judgment the defendants sought
and quickly an appeal was brought.

Court of appeals, J.H.Gillis, J.
Gave thought to this and had this to say:
1)There is no liability
since no-fault grants immunity;
2)No jurisdiction can be found
where process service is unsound;
and thus the judgment, as it's termed

Reason summaries (Squibbs)
1.
Defendant's Chevy struck a tree-
there was no liability;
the No-Fault Act comes into play
as owner and the driver say.
barred by the act's immunity
no suit in tort will aid the tree.
Although the oak's in disarray
No court can make defendants pay.

2.
No jurisdiction could be found

Where plaintiff failed to well comply
with rules of court that did apply.

Summary of appeal court's opinion
J.H. Gillis, Judge
We thought that we would never see
a suit to compensate a tree.
A suit whose claim in tort is prest
upon a mangled tree's behest.
A tree whose battered trunk was prest
against a Chevy's crumpled crest.
A tree that faces each new day
with bark and linb in disarray.
A tree that may forever bear
a lasting need for tender care.
Flora lovers though we three,
we must uphold the court's decree.

Affirmed.

(This joke courtesy of orchestral trumpeter Michael Bowman)

A judge, a bishop, and a conductor were having a discussion.  All three
were rather vain men, and their talk soon turned to the question of which
of them was the greatest.

"Well," said the judge, "my position is one of dignity and power.  When
I walk into the courtroom, the bailiff says 'All rise!' and all the people
stand to pay me honor."

"That's very nice," said the bishop.  "People stand in your honor;  but
when people have an audience with me they kneel, kiss my ring, and they
address me as 'Your Holiness.'"

The conductor snorted and said, "I think I got you both beat;  when I
step onto the podium, as guest conductor, the people look down, put their
hands over their eyes, and say 'Oh, my God!'"

  So there are three golfers, (Bob, Max, and Ted) who are looking for a 
fourth. Bob mentions that his friend George is a pretty good golfer, so
they decide to invite him for the following Saturday.

  "Sure, I'd love to play," says George, "but I may be about ten minutes
late, so wait for me."

  So Saturday rolls around. Bob, Max, and Ted arrive promptly at 9:00,
and find George already waiting for them. He plays right-handed, and
beats them all. Quite pleased with their new fourth, they ask him if
he'd like to play again the following Saturday.

  "Yeah, sounds great," says George. "But I may be about ten minutes
late, so wait for me."

  The following Saturday, again, all four golfers show up on time, but
this time George plays left-handed, and beats them all. As they're
getting ready to leave, George says:

  "See you next Saturday. But I may be about ten minutes late, so wait
for me."

  Every week, George is right on time, and plays great with whichever
hand he decides to use. And every week, he departs with the same
message.

  After a couple months, Ted is pretty tired of this routine, so he
says, "Wait a minute, George. Every week you say you may be about ten
minutes late, but you're right on time. And you beat us either
left-handed or right-handed. What's the story?"

  "Well," George says, "I'm kind of superstitious. When I get up in the
morning, I look at my wife. If she's sleeping on her left side, I play
left-handed. And if she's sleeping on her right side, I play
right-handed."

  "So what do you do if she's sleeping on her back?" Bob asks.

  "Then I'm about ten minutes late," George answers.

During a recent international sports meet , one of the Scottish
track and field coaches was entertaining some friends and col-
leagues in his hotel room. As so often occurs the libations were
used up before it was time to end the festivities.

After receiving directions to the nearest wine/liquor store, the
Scottish coach departed the party.

Upon arriving at the store, he noticed that there were only three
or four people waiting in the queue.

Immediately ahead of him were two men dressed in military fa-
tigues and heavily bearded.  He overhead one of them ordering
several bottles of Scotch and rum. Upon being told the value of
his purchases, this fatigue dressed individual told the clerk
that he was with Fidel. Immediately the clerk produced a book
and had the individual sign for his purchases. To say that the
Scotsman was intrigued would be an understatement.

The other individual in front of the Scotsman proceeded to order
at least twice what his companion had ordered. Upon receipt of
his total he also told the clerk that he was with Fidel.  Same
book, same procedure as the first fatigue clad individual.

By this time the Scotsman had figured he was on to a good thing.

He ordered bottles of this, that, cigars, cigarettes etc.  Upon
being presented with his bill he told the clerk that he was with
Fidel.

The clerk told him that he could not be with Fidel.

   "Why not?" said the indignant Scotsman.

   "Because you do not have the beard and the big cigar." the
clerk replied.

Pausing for only a moment, the Scotsman reached down, lifted up
his kilt and proudly announced, "SECRET SERVICE!!!"

True story:

I used to work for T.I. in Houston.  Once a young programmer fellow
>From the Bedford, England came to do some consulting.  He was a nice
enough guy, but very stiff and proper.  On his last day before returning
to G.B., I took him to lunch at a Luby's Cafeteria.  While waiting
in line, I told him that before he left Texas, he simply *must* try
some mepyew.  

He said, "What?"  

I said, "Mepyew.  It is very popular. Everyone here eats it with lunch.
Sort of a Texas tradition. The woman in the serving line will ask you 
if you want some."

I give a sly wink or two to various prospective diners who
were overhearing the conversation and looking quizical.

He agreed to order some mepyew.

We approached the first station where the lady was selling jello
deserts and chilled salads.

"Mepyew?", she asked.
"Yes please," he responded.
"Mepyew?"
"Yes."
"Mepyew?"  (Now with noticable agitation.)
"Yes! If you Please!"
"Well ahm not a mind reader!"

I laughed a little.

Finally realizing that he had been had, he proceded directly to the
roast beef and mashed potatoes, as any good Englishman would.

I giggled.  The people I had winked at giggled.  My English friend
busied himself with macaroni and cake.

Back at the office, Shiela and Mike giggled.  The Englishman studied
a directory listing.

Someday, I'm going to invent a dish called mepyew.  Maybe it will be
a jello and roast beef casserole.

Upon pulling down the sheets and about ready to go to bed after a long

So he decided to try the mystery hole, stood up on the bed and put is

Four Oxford professors (dons, whatever...) were taking their evening walk
together and as usual, were engaged in casual but learned conversation.
On this particular evening, their conversation was about the names given
to groups of animals, such as a "pride of lions" or a "gaggle of geese."

One of the professors noticed a group of prostitutes down the block, and
posed the question, "What name would be given to that group?"  The four
fell into silence for a moment, as they pondered the possibilities...

At last, one spoke: "How about 'a Jam of Tarts'?"  The others nodded in
acknowledgement as they continued to consider the problem.  A second
professor spoke: "I'd suggest 'an Essay of Trollops.'"  Again, the
others nodded.  A third spoke: "I propose 'a Flourish of Strumpets.'"

They continued their walk in silence, until the first professor remarked
to the remaining professor, who was the most senior and learned of the
four, "You haven't suggested a name for our ladies.  What are your thoughts?"
The fourth professor replied, "'An Anthology of Prose.'"

This was published in The South Texas Fisherman, sometime 1972.  I'd
like to take credit for it but the "Bill Kennedy" author is Sr, I'm Jr.

TALKING TO FISH
by Bill Kennedy

A character in one of Shakespeare's plays, boasting of his accomplishments
said "I can call up monsters from the vasty deep."  Any fisherman could have
given the answer: "So can I and so can any man, but will they come?"  Men
and women have been calling to fish, pleading with them and swearing at them
without response since the beginning of time.  A federally supported research
project may change that situation.

Working with the whale family (porpoise or dolphin), scientists in Florida
have set out to translate fish language.  They are not far along yet but
have made some headway.  Various clicks and whistles have been recorded
that indicate, at least in the whale family, one fish has a way to commun-
icating what is on his mind to another fish.  If the research continues as
planned, it should be only a matter of time until man will be able to
reporoduce fish noises and communicate what is on his mind to bass, perch,
and catfish.

All right-minded fishermen agree that fish-talk research projects should
be cancelled and the scientists in it forced to seek other employment.
The reasoning behind this point of view is simple and sound.  If the
research continues to its logical conclusion, fishing will cease to be
the pleasant and relaxing sport that it now is.  Fishing will become a
business of bellowing speeches in fish language designed to convince fish
that they would be better off on the bank or in the boat than they are in
the water.  In such circumstances any fool knows who the men that will
catch all the fish will be.  They will be politicians!

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.  This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

Subject: Vaseline salesman
Keywords: sexual, chuckle

A Vaseline salesman is driving through the country, when his car starts
leaking and loses all its oil.  Not knowing what to do, he fills the
engine with Vaseline, thinking that it is similar to oil, and drives away.
It works fine until about half an hour later, when the engine gets real
warm, and the Vaseline melts, and runs out through the same hole as the
oil did.  This time there is a farm nearby, so he decides to look for a 
phone.  

	Meanwhile, inside the farmhouse, the farmer, his wife, and daughter
are having a fight about who's going to do the dishes.  "I did them this
morning," complains the farmer.  "Well I did them at lunch," says his wife.
"And I'm tired from doing all the farmwork," says the daughter.  So the
farmer, in a stroke of brilliance, decides that they will settle it by all
taking off their clothes, lying on the floor, and declaring that the first
one to speak gets to do the dishes.

	The Vaseline saleman gets to the front door, and rings the bell.
No one answers so he goes in and looks for a phone.  He eventually stumbles
into the kitchen, and ignoring the odd sight, asks for a phone.  No one
answers, so he goes and looks some more.  Still no luck, so he goes back to
the kitchen.  They still won't answer, so he decides to see what else he
can get away with.  He has sex with the daughter several times, bemused by
her silence, then finally goes and looks for the phone again.  A while
later, he comes back, looks at the wife, and says, "Why not?"  After having
sex with the farmer's wife, he is getting tired and exasperated.  He
thinks, maybe if they have some Vaseline, I can drive my car for another
half-hour.  So he asks, "Do you have any Vaseline?" at which the farmer
jumps up and yells, "I'll do the dishes!"

   A great Soviet general was once asked by his adjutant, "Comrade General,
what is the meaning of Marxist dialectic?"

   The general replied, "I will explain it to you with an example. A filthy
man is standing outside a bath house. Will he go in?"

   "Of course," replied the adjutant.

   "No, you're wrong," said the general.  "A filthy man is filthy by his nature,
and will not go in to the bath house. Only clean men, knowing the virtues of
cleanliness, will bathe."

   "I understand, comrade general."

   "Now, let me give you another example.  A filthy man is standing outside 
a bath house.  Will he go in?"

   "Absolutely not," replied the adjutant immediately.

   "You're wrong again," said the general.  "Why should a filthy man not
enter a bath house? He is dirty, the bath house is there to enable him to
become clean, and he will use it."

   "I think I understand, comrade."

   "Now, one last example.  A filthy man is standing outside a bath house.
Will he go in?"

   "How the hell should I know?"

   "Now, comrade, you truly understand the meaning of Marxist dialectic."

(This might be an oldie, but I got a grin out of it when I remembered it.)

A fellow sitting in a bar noticed that the bartender was staring at him.
Each time he'd look away and finally came over, a bit embarrassed.

"I'm sorry sir, let me buy you a drink."

He accepted and accepted the subsequent two apologies and drinks.

"Really sir, surely you know this, you must be the ugliest man I've
 ever seen and I can't keep from staring at you."

"You think I'm pretty ugly?  That ugly?  Are you a betting man?"

"Well it depends on what I'm betting on, but I do bet from time to time."

"Do you see that cute little blonde sitting over there with that young
 man?  I've got $50 that says I'll go over there and pick her up."

The bartender accepted immediately, plopping his $50 on the bar next to
the customer's who had started to approach the table but wheeled and
came back.

"I've got another $50 that says that I'll pat her on the fanny as we walk
 by you and she'll give you a wink."

The bartender quickly added another $50 and shortly after that the guy
walked out with the blonde on his arm and as they went by he patted her
on the fanny, she winked at the bartender, and the guy collected the win.

Astonished the bartender went over to the table where she had been
sitting to quiz the young man she had been with, he was sitting there with
a stunned look on his face.

"My gosh fellow, I'm amazed!  What did he do?  What did he say?"

A man is going to work one day and accidentily slams his penis in the car door.
Goes to the doctor, and the doctor says "We're going to have to put a splint on that."  The guy says "No way Doc, I'm getting married in a week."  The Doc
replies "Well if we don't, it's going to be bent for the rest of your life."
So finally the guy agrees, and the doctor gets out a couple tongue depressors
and some tape and fixes him up.

	A week later, and he's on his honeymoon.  His new wife is doing a 
slow, seductive strip-tease in front of him.  She takes off her bra and says
"See these, they've never been touched by a man before."  She then takes
off her panties and says "See this, it's never been seen by a man before."
So the husband whips off his shorts and says "See this, it's not even out
of the crate yet!"

A Scotsman was sick and in hospital. His doctors were afraid that
this was to be the end of him since nothing they did could do anything
to make him healthy. His physician asked him if there was anything
that he could do to make him more comfortable in his final hours.
The Scot replied, "If I could only hear the pipes one more time it would
make me very happy." So the doctor arranged for a piper to come into the
room and play for the dying man.

When the Scot heard the pipes the color came back into his cheeks, his
eyes became bright, his breathing was easier, and he got up and danced
around the room. He was completely cured! Later, while recounting the
tale to his fellows over lunch the doctor confessed that this was a
miracle cure that he couldn't explain. When the pipes began to play
the Scotsman was cured. The only problem he could see was that 2
Englishmen in for checkups died.

Have you heard about South African chess?  It's a variation on standard chess.
The object is to capture the black bishop.  Of course, that's not very

_________________________________________________________________________

Tap the power of _random_ selection to increase chances of winning the
lotto!

   Lotto players face a dilemma each time they buy a ticket.  What numbers 
to pick?  Studies have shown that most lotto winners don't use any sort of
special system to select their numbers.  Instead, they tap the power of
_random selection_.

   The Millionaire Maker is a novel, fun way to user random selection to
pick your numbers.  It works just like a state Lotto machine.  A tiny
battery-powered motor under the base rotates the sphere, which holds 80
numbered balls.  Press one button and the sphere mixes the balls thoroughly.
Touch the other and the sphere rotates in the opposite direction...a clever
scooping system lifts a single ball at a time, up and into a sliding tray.

    To return the balls to the sphere simply place them on the filling tray
and tilt it up.  Now you are ready to choose another perfectly random set of
numbers.

    Order Millionaire Maker today, for yourself, or friends who enjoy 
playing Lotto.  _YOU_ night bust the Lotto and be an instant millionaire!

It is with regret that I must say that the controversy over this matter and
the volume of response have blown far out of proportion.  It is my
current belief that an excessive amount of mail directed at the Kitchener-
Waterloo Record can only aggravate the situation.  While I originally set
up an email drop box for letters to the Record, I must ask that people send
no more.

The letters so far have all supported me, and due to the excessive volume,
I would understand if the editors felt the batch were suspect coming from
me.  Because of this, I must ask that any who still require me to forward
their letter send a confirmation.  I regret having to ask this but I truly
feel it is the best course at this time.

If you INSIST, you can do this by replying to this message, which will
mail to rconfirm@looking.UUCP

If you do confirm, you can re-send the text of your letter, or just a
confirmation, in which case I will get it from the "record" mailbox.

You will not hear much, if anything, more from me on this subject.
Thank you all for your kind support.  I know (perhaps more than anybody, now)
how difficult it is to come out in public to defend somebody accused of
racism, or anything like it.  You are all to be applauded.

trip he decided to bring his wife.  When they arrived at their
hotel and were shown to their room, the man said:

  "You rest here while I register - I'll be back within an hour."

The wife lies down on the bed... just then, an elevated train passes
by very close to the window and shakes the room so hard she's thrown out
of the bed.

Thinking this must be a freak occurance, she lies down once more.  Again
a train shakes the room so violently, she's pitched to the floor.  Exasperated,
she calls the front desk, asks for the manager. The manager 
says he'll be right up.

The manager (naturally) is skeptical but the wife insists the story is
true.
  "Look,... lie here on the bed -  you'll be thrown right to the floor!".
So he lies down next to the wife... Just then the husband walks in.

  "What", he says, "are you doing here?"

The manager replies: 

  "Would you believe I'm waiting for a train?"

At the hospital, a doctor is training an intern on how to announce bad
news to the patients.  The doctor tells the intern ``This man in 305
is going to die in six months.  Go in and tell him.''  The intern
boldly walk into the room and up to the man and tells him ``You're
gonna die!''  The man has a heart attack and dies on the spot.  The
doctor quickly takes the intern aside and cautions him ``You were much
too abrupt in announcing the news to that man.  You've got to take it
easy, work your way up to the subject.  Now this man in 310 has but a
week to live.  Go in and tell him, but gently now!''  The intern goes
softly into the room, humming to himself, cheerily opens the drapes to
let the sun in, walks up to the man and tells him ``Good morning!
What a wonderful day, no?  Say...  Guess who's going to die soon?''

This is something I made up after my boss told me to give a braindump
on our products to the new guy. It's based on the unix strings package.
nroff source is available for those that want the underlines and all.
Unfortunately, the source code was lost and the executable only exists
for NCR Decision Mate V machines running CP/M 1.19 with 8" floppies.
Otherwise, I'd have sent it to comp.sources.misc.


BRAIN(3)            UNIX Programmer's Manual             BRAIN(3)



NAME
     braindump, braincat, braincmp, brainlen - brain operations

SYNOPSIS
     #include <brain.h>

     void braindump(b1, b2)
     brain b1, b2;

     void braincat(b1, b2)
     brain b1, b2;

     int braincmp(b1, b2, s)
     brain b1, b2;
     subject s;

     long brainlen(b1);
     brain b1;

DESCRIPTION
     These functions work on null-terminated brains.  They do not
     check for overflow of the receiving brain.

     braindump copies brain b2 to b1, stopping after the null
     axon has been moved.

     braincat appends a copy of brain b1 to the end of brain b2.

     braincmp compares its arguments and returns an integer
     greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according as
     knowledge about subject s in brain b1 is objectively greater
     than, equal to, or less than that in b2.

     brainlen returns the number of usable, non-null axons in b1.

BUGS
     We tried to write a brainndump but you just can't shut some
     people up.

******************************************************************

                                          Atlanta, Georgia
                                          September 13, 1970

Director 
Billing Department
Shell Oil Company 
P.O. Box XXXX
Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102 

Dear Sir:

I have been a regular customer of the Shell Oil Company for several
years now, and spend approximately $40.00 per month on Shell products.
Until recently, I have been completely satisfied with the quality of
Shell products and with the service of Shell employees.

Included in my most recent statement from your department was a bill
for $12.00 for a tire which I purchased at the Lowell I. Reels Shell
station in McAdenville, N.C.  I stopped at this station for gasoline
and to have a timing malfunction corrected.  The gasoline cost $5.15;
eight new plugs cost $9.36; labor on the points $2.50.  All well and
good.

Earlier in the day I had a flat tire, which the attendant at the
Lowell I.  Reels station informed me that he was unable to fix. He
suggested that I purchase a tire from him in order that I have a spare
for the remainder of my journey to Atlanta. I told him that I
preferred to buy tires from home station in Atlanta, but he continued
to stress the risk of driving without a spare.  My reluctance to trade
with an unknown dealer, even a Shell dealer, did not discourage him
and finally, as I was leaving, he said that out of concern for my
safety (my spare was not new) and because I had made a substantial
expenditure at his station, he would make me a special deal.  He
produced a tire ("Hits a good one.  Still has the tits on it.  See
them tits.  Hits a twenty dollar tar.") which I purchased for twelve
dollars and which he installed on the front left side for sixty-five
cents.  Fifty miles further down the highway, I had a blowout.

Not a puncture which brought a slow, flapping flat, nor a polite
ladyfinger firecracker rubberburpple rupture (pop); but a howitzer
blowout, which reared the the hood of my car up into my face, a
blowout, sir, which tore a flap of rubber from this "tire" large
enough to make soles for both sandals of a medium sized hippie.  In a
twinkling, then, I was driving down Interstate 85 at sixty miles per
hour on three tires and one rim with rubber clinging to it in
desparate shreds and patches, an instrument with a bent, revolving,
steel-then-rubber-then-steel rim, whose sound can be approximated by
the simultaneous placing of a handful of gravel and a young duck into
a Waring Blender.

The word "careen" does no justice whatever to the movement that the
car then performed.  According to the highway patrolman's report, the
driver in the adjoining lane, the left hand-- who, incidentally, was
attempting to pass me at the time-- ejaculated adrenalin all over the
ceiling of his car.  My own passengers were fused into a featureless
quiver in the key of "G" in the back seat of my car.  The rim was
bent; the tits were gone; and you can f--k yourself with a cream
cheese dildo if you entertain for one moment the delusion that I
intend to pay the twelve dollars.

                                       Sincerely yours,
                                       /s/ T.B.T.

Well, there's a chill in the air, a frost on the ground, and a large
steaming pile of bullshit on the television.  Yes, that's
right, it's election time.  Voting in CA should be an absolute
blast this year, as we have the pleasure of voting on approximately
12,000 new "propositions."  For those of you who don't live in
California, a "proposition" is a way for us California slimes to
participate directly in the democratic process, by allowing anyone who
has the brains of a lima bean to spend billions of dollars on
television commercials.  My personal favorite is the commercial
sponsored by the insurance companies, which states that if we don't
vote for their proposition, all of Western Civilization will collapse.
(A prospect which concerns me greatly, as then it will certainly be
much harder to buy beer, and they might even cancel Professional
Wrestling)

This year, most of our propositions are funded by "General Obligation
Bonds," which really means "We have no idea how we're going to pay for
this proposition."  Lately, it's become an all-too-frequent occurrence
to see the Proposition Funding Team searching through California
streets in search of lost quarters and stuff.  (I read an interview of
Horace Gumley, chairman of the Proposition Funding Committee, who was
in a particularly ecstatic mood because a Funding Team Member found a
5-dollar bill that morning.)

Which brings me to my reason for writing this.  Next year, I'd like to
get my very own "proposition" on the ballot.  This proposition would
state that if you go to a nightclub and some dumb idiot puts out a
cigarette in your beer, you can legally make that person drink it,
without having the bouncers throw you out.  Not that I've ever done
anything like that.

If you would like to vote on this proposition next year, write an
extremely concerned letter to:

	Guverner Dukemajuhn
	The Big House in Sacramento
	Sacramento, CA

Thank you

    A young man wished to purchase a present for his sweetheart and after
    careful consideration, he decided to buy her a pair of gloves.
    Accompanied by his sister, he went to a women's wear shop and bought a
    pair of expensive gloves. Meanwhile, his sister bought a pair of panties.
    In the delivery, the packages got mixed up; his sister got the gloves and
    he got the panties. Without checking the contents of the package, he sent
    it to his sweetheart with the following note:


    Dearest One,

	This little gift is to show you I have not forgotten your birthday. I
    chose them because I noticed you were not in the habit of wearing any
    when you went out in the evenings. I it hadn't been for my sister, who
    was with me when I bought them, I would have picked out long ones with
    buttons, but she said the latest style is to wear them unbuttoned, and
    hanging down. I had her try them on for me and she looked very smart in
    them.

	How I wish I could put them on for you the first time, but no doubt
    many other hands will touch them before I have a chance. I did not know
    what size to get, yet I should be capable of judging better than anyone
    else. When you take them off, blow in them as they will be a little damp
    from wearing them. Be sure to keep them on while cleaning them; otherwise
    they will shrink.

						With my fondest love,

    P.S.  Just think of the number of times I will kiss the back of them in
    the coming year.

One day the President and Mrs. Coolidge were visiting a government

When Mrs. Coolidge passed the chicken pens she paused to ask the man in
charge if the rooster copulates more than once each day.  "Dozens of
times," was the reply.  "Please tell that to the President," Mrs.
Coolidge requested.

When the President passed the pens and was told about the

Two hunters hire a small plane to take them to a remote area of Canada.
Upon dropping off the hunters, the pilot tells them, "Remember only one
moose, because the plane wouldn't be able to take off with more weight
than that."  The hunters go off.  A week later when the plane returns to
pick them up the two hunters are standing by the lake with two moose.

The pilot fumes, "I told you guys only one moose, you'll have to leave one
because we won't be able to take off with that much weight."  "Oh, c'mon,"
beg the two hunters, "Last year the pilot let us take two moose on, you're
just a chicken."

Not wanting to be accused of being a coward, the pilot allows the two to
bring both moose on the craft.  The plane starts across the lake,
straining to take off.  The pilot tries and tries to no avail as
they run out of room and the plane crashes into the trees at the end of the
lake.  A while later after coming to one of the hunters gets up and looks
at all the scatterd debris of the wreck and says, "Where are we?"  To which
the other hunter replies, "Oh, I'd say about a hundred yards farther than
last year."

Heard from a friend, some years ago:

Three bulls -- a big bull, a medium sized bull, and a small bull -- were
standing by a fence one day, chewing grass and looking out over the
fields.  The big one says, "See all of them cows out there?   Half of
'em are mine."  The medium sized one responds, "See all them cows?  A
third of them are MINE."   The little bull pipes up, "Hey, all the rest
of them cows are mine."

	After a while the bulls notice the farmer drive up with a
truck and unload another bull -- the hugest Brahma bull these other
bulls have ever seen.  The big bull stops chewing and says, with a wide-
eyed look, "He...he can have a third of my cows if he wants 'em."   The
medium sized bull trembles a bit when he says "He can have HALF of my
cows if he wants them."

	Then the two bigger bulls notice that the small bull is
snorting, bucking, pawing the ground, and putting on a ferocious act.
"What are you doing, fool !?" they say.  The small bull replies, "I
want to make sure he knows I'm a bull!"

Let me apologize for not making that joke rot13.  It should have been,
but I goofed up, as sometimes happens, even to pfrect guys like me.

Rest assured that I'm not unaware of the Holocaust.  Part of my heritage
is Jewish, enough that Hitler would have put me into the camps had I been
in Nazi Germany.

Also rest assured that the posting of the joke near the 50th anniversary of
the start of Hitler's pogroms was literally random chance.  The jokes
are posted by the cron, which selects a random joke from the joke queues.
That joke was actually received a while ago, and the decision to post on
that date was that of my system's rand(), srand() and time() routines.

Sorry.

A fellow went to work one day and was met at the door by his boss. "You're
fired, and there may be a summons for your arrest out of this!" the boss
exclaimed.

The fellow then started to drive home when the steering went out
on his car and he ran into a carload of nuns. After the policeman let him
go with the collection of tickets, he called his insurance company, only to
find out that his wife forgot to send in the premium payment and that his
insurance ran out last week.

On his way home, he stopped into the bank to get some money and found
out that his wife had been there earlier with his best friend and
emptied the accounts. After leaving the bank, he was on his way home and
saw the fire engines heading down his street. Upon arriving
at his house, he discovered that it was indeed his house on fire. The fire 
chief was sure that it was going to be a total loss. Again, calling the 
insurance company, he found that the homeowners insurance also had been 
cancelled.

By now the fellow was somewhat depressed and went into the local
bar. As he was telling his troubles to the bartender the bartender said,
"You've got the chance of a lifetime. All your obligations are gone and you
can start all over. Why don't you take this bucket, go up to Huckleberry Hill,
pick huckleberries, and go door to door selling them."

Well, this sounded O.K. to the fellow, so off he went. After picking
most of the day he finally had enough berries to sell. At the first house he 
stopped at the woman said that she would indeed take all his huckleberries
but would he mind coming around to the back door. As the fellow got to the 
back door the woman opened it and was totally nude. (and not hard on the eyes)

The fellow just broke down and was weeping hysterically. The woman was quite
beside herself and asked what the problem was. The fellow answered "I've lost
my job, my car is ruined, my wife ran off with my best friend taking all my
money, my house burned down, all my insurance has been cancelled, and now
I'm going to be screwed out of my huckleberries."

It  was the wedding night for a young couple and the groom wanted everything
to be just perfect.  He arranged to stay in the Honeymoon Suite of a plush
hotel, and he and his new bride eagerly jumped into the heart-shaped bed
to make love for the first time (at least for him).  After making wild and
passionate love for a considerate length of time, they both reached the
climactic momement simultaneously, slipping into a state of utmost
relaxation.  At this point, the groom reaches for the telephone.

"What on earth do you think you are doing?" asks the young bride

"Well, I wanted everything to be perfect, so I thought I should call room
service for a bottle of their finest champagne," came the reply

"Well, I used to date Arnold Palmer, and when Arnold and I finished making love
we would wait 10 minutes and make love again," the young groom was informed.

"If that's what you are used to, I will  be glad to comply..."  And 10 minutes
or so later the young couple was making wild and passionate love again.  At
the culmination of this second lovemaking session,  the young groom reaches
for the phone once again...

"What on earth do you think you are doing?"  asks the young bride.

"Like I said before, I want this to be a special occasion, so I was going to
call room service for that bottle of champagne."

"Well, Arnold and I used to relax for 15 minutes or so, and then make love a
third time,"  came her reply.

So, once again, not wanting to disappoint  his young bride, the groom relaxed
a bit and finally was capable of making love a third time.  After this third
wild and passionate and somewhat time consuming session, the couple finally
reaches the climactic momement and returns to a relaxed state.  Once again,
the groom reaches for the phone....

"What on earth do you think you are doing?"  asks the young bride.

"Calling Arnold Palmer to find out what's par for this hole!"

A black guy and a gorilla go into a bar together.  He says to the
bartender, "I'd like a beer, and a gin and tonic for my girlfriend here."

The bartender says, "Oh come on, pal, we don't serve no gorillas in here."

So the guy figures he'll fix them, he takes the gorilla home, shaves off all
her hair, gives her a nice wig, lipstick, red dress, etc. He takes her back to
the bar and says, "I'd like a beer, and a gin and tonic for my girlfriend here."
The bartender gives them the drinks and they go off and sit down and
chat.  The bartender turns to his buddy at the bar and says, "You know, that
drives me crazy, it seems like every time a good looking Italian girl comes
in here, she's with a black guy."

				THE DYING OF EMBER
		(A Parody of Amber, with Apologies to Roger Zelazny)
				   Kevin Knight
				      c 1988
 		            Reproduced with Permission

                                        III

	My destination: Ember.  My goal: the crown and the throne.  My mode of 
transportation: walking in Shade.  My name: Lord Corbin.  
	First stop, Revlon.
	Ah, fair Revlon.  A Shade world I once knew so well.  I had ruled there
for many years in the Old Times.  Revlon was my home away from Ember, and 
through my presence there, I had built it into a mighty power.  Rolling 
hills, deep forests, men of honor, fair maidens . . .
	Fair maidens with heavy makeup.  Strange as it may sound, the makeup 
of Revlon would enable me to launch a massive attack on Ember and win back what
was rightfully mine.  Years before, you see, I had brought a case of Revlon 
rouge to Ember, as a gift for my sister Didi.  She didn't like the stuff, 
and in my anger I threw it into the fireplace.  It exploded, very prettily and 
very noisily.  My first thought was: I was lucky that Didi had spurned the 
gift, for she sometimes smokes.  My second thought was: wait a minute, nothing 
explodes in Ember!  And so I formulated a plan to build weapons based on 
this chemical, weapons which would one day make me the most powerful man in 
Ember.
	Unfortunately, this plan had slipped my mind last time around.  Blaise 
fell off a cliff and I got four years in the slammer because of it.  Not this
time, brother.
	I shifted Shade for Revlon.

	I came upon seven men, six dead and one slouched against a thick oak.
I hated to see so many dead men, so using my power as Prince of the Blood, I 
walked to a nearby Shade where there were also seven men, but only one was
dead.  The other six stood laughing.  They noticed me as I approached.
	"Wot's this then?" said one.
	Their shirts were thin and ragged, probably from the battle that had
resulted in the death of the one who lay plastered on the ground.
	"Warriors," I said.  "Does any of your number know the way to Revlon?"
	They looked at each other quizzically.
	"For whom do you fight?" I asked.
	"?" they tried.
	"Who . . . is . . . your . . . leader?"
	"Tha' would be me, bloke," said one of the tall ones.  "You innerested
in joinin' us?  Headin' for Revlon, we are."
	"Fine, fine!" I said.
	"What instrument do you play?" he asked.
	"I play some guitar, but why do you ask?"
	"We're a Heavy Metal Band, boy!  And Lord knows we need another 
guitarist!"
	"We only got three," piped one of the short ones.
	"You're in!" said the leader, and he slapped me on the back.  I wasn't
really interested in hanging around with a burned out metal band, but I had
to admit I was out of practice, and a few jam sessions would be just the thing
to get me back into top form.  I would travel with these men to Revlon.
	"I've been in the slammer," I explained.
	They murmured to each other in their heavy foreign accents.  I could
only pick out the words "pigs" and "drugs".
	I slept, and in the morning I found that my sword Graceland had
transmuted itself into a silver Stratocaster.  I picked it up and played a
C chord.  Then a G.  The guitar was in tune.  I cradled the neck and pulled
up on the distortion bar.  Yes, I knew how to use the thing.
	Outside, the men in the band were tuning their instruments.  The
two drummers were dueling.  The bassist/vocalist was running through some
scales.  I stepped out and roared into a Stones riff.  The other guitarists
were taken aback.  They jumped in with some rhythm, and one of them contested
me for the lead.  I was able to squeeze in more notes per second, however,
and he quickly conceded.  I switched to some of the heavier stuff.  After
an hour, two of the guitarists put down their weapons and had a smoke.  The
other one played with me for another hour, but he too grew tired.  I was just
starting to feel back in shape, though, and I wanted to push myself.  I played
a few songs with the drummers, then engaged the bassist/vocalist in an
extended version of Stairway to Heaven.  That night, I ate a huge meal and
slept for ten hours.
	I repeated the same routine for the next few days, as we drew closer
to Revlon.
	On the fourth night I met Lauren.  I would like to tell you that we
met an a patio overlooking a lake, with the full moon highlighting her hair
and her silvery dress.  But that would be crap.  I had seen her several times
before, first with the bassist/vocalist, then with one of the guitarists, and
later with the two drummers.  The first time I ever spoke with her, though, 
was after a gig.  She came by my dressing room and asked me if I wanted to 
do it.  I said, yeah, sure.  She said she loved me.  I said, crap.  But she 
started hanging around me anyway.  We spent several nights together, and she 
told me many things.
	"I've seen you play.  You're good," she said.
	"I've seen better," I replied.
	"The guys in the band respect you.  They also fear you."
	"Why?  Because I can squeeze a few more notes out of my Strat?"
	"They think there is something supernatural involved.  They're 
Devil Worshippers, you know."
	I had not known this, but as I reflected upon the human skeletons, the
pyrotechnics, and the hell-inspired lyrics that made up our show, pieces
of the puzzle began to fall together.  Perhaps it was no accident that I, a 
man who had been called a demon more than once, should fall in with such a 
crowd.  I laughed aloud to hide my thoughts.
	"I'm no demon," I said. " I'm just the second best guitarist around, 
that's all."
	"Who's the best? 
	"Benedictus of Ember, if he is still alive," I replied.  Benedictus had
once upstaged the Moonpeople of Ghinesh by doing four encores in a single
night.  We are a very musical family.
	"Wanna do it?" she asked.
	"Yeah, sure," I replied.
	"I love you."
	"Crap."
	There was something sad about Lauren, though I enjoyed my time with
her, and vice-versa.  One night she told me that she was going to die.  I
asked her why.  She said that soon the band would break up, and without us,
she was nothing.  I was silent, for I knew that the band would indeed break
up.  I would be the first to leave once we reached Revlon.  I had no choice.  
My destiny was to become King of Ember, not Bandleader of Devil-people.
	With a few gigs under my belt, I felt better than ever.  I no longer
felt the physical and psychological strains of my four years in the Big House.
	Lauren lay next to me, sleeping.  Suddenly, her eyes grew wide.
	"You are in trouble," she said flatly.
	Before I could formulate an answer, the door to my hotel room flew
open.  On the threshold stood an inhuman beast, six feet tall, gray and
unclothed.  It wore a fake arrow through its head, in a low grade imitation 
of the Comedians of Ember.  In its right hand was a long silver blade 
that I liked not at all.
	"My name is Strygalldwinnirdrillbinir.  Conjure with it, and I shall
eat your spleen."
	"Conjure with it?  I can't even say it," I lied. 
	"Who are you?" it demanded. 
	"Misli, gammi gra'dil, Strygalldwinnnirdrinbillir," I said. 
	"No, it's 'Strygalldwinnirdrillbinir'," it said.
	"Sorry.  Misli, gammi gra'dil, Strygalldwinnirdribblnir." 
	"No, not '--dribblnir'.  It's '--drillbinir'."  
	I never was very good at foreign names.  One more try:
	"Misli, gammi gra'dil, Strygalldwinnirdrillbinir."  
	"You seek to drive me away with such a simple spell?  I am not one of
the wimpier ones.  I must ask you again, who are you?"
	"This isn't fair.  My name is much easier to pronounce."
	"Three times I must ask you--"
	Those were its last words, for just then, a man slid up behind the 
beast and put a dagger through its throat.  The thing died silently.  The 
man entered the room.
	"Lose the bitch," he said.  Lauren pulled the sheet around herself and
left quickly.
	"My thanks, sir," I said.  "What is your name?"  
	He hesitated.  
	"Look, I won't conjure with it, I promise," I promised.
	"The name is Galenon, and if I may offer you some paternal advice, I
would transmute that guitar back into a sword.  The times they are 
a-changin'."
	I chuckled and snorted and did this thing, and we stayed up most of 
the night talked of our respective travels.  Galenon was also on the road to 
Revlon, as it turned out, and I decided to split the band and join him.  I 
packed my things and left in the night.
	I was forthright with Galenon, for I trusted him.  I told him of Ember
and of my plans to take the throne.  He had heard of Ember and asked to be
my lieutenant in the upcoming battle.  I accepted his offer.
	We reached Revlon at last.  I wondered if its inhabitants would still
remember me, their ruler of five hundred years past.  At the border, a guard
stopped us.
	"You look familiar," he told me.  "You look just like that guy on
the old coins."
	"George Washington?" I tried.
	"No, no, that other guy."
	"Lincoln?"
	"No."
	"Kennedy?  He's on the half-dollar," I suggested.
	"Forget it.  You may pass."  
	"Was it Jefferson?  Thomas Jefferson?"
	Galenon nudged me.  "I don't mean to sound like your father," he said,
"but don't you think we ought to be getting the explosive rouge?"
	"Right," I said.
	We made it to the city, where we were approached by the local cops.
They insisted that we see a man known as the Defender, in City Hall.  We 
travelled to this place.  Inside, I was surprised to see that the man behind 
the desk was my own brother, Benedictus of Ember.  My eyes widened, and so 
did his.
	"Brother!" said he.
	"Brother!" replied I.
	"How fare thee?" he asked.
	I dared not tell him of my plans.
	"Fine, and you?" I said.
	"I am tired, and as you can see, I have no arms."
	This was true, he had no arms.
	"This is true, you have no arms.  How did this thing come about?"
	"It is a long story.  But at last I have re-united Revlon and driven 
the demon creatures out."
	"Demon creatures?  DEMONS OF EMBER?"
	"No, demons of Revlon.  A particularly nasty race of beings known 
as Housemaids.  Cold, icy, stubborn beasts, they refuse to do windows, and 
worse, they always put stuff back in the wrong drawers.  Their attacks began 
three years ago.  As you can imagine, they caused great confusion in the 
land.  In an effort to resolve the conflict, I met with their leader, a woman 
called Linda.  Unfortunately, I was forced to kill her after she lopped off 
my arms.  Much later, I made love to her and then began counterattacking her 
troops.  Only in the past month have we driven them from the city.  I will 
continue the patrols for the next two hundred years, however, for we may have
missed one or two of them."
	"Prudent," said I.
	"But enough about me.  I hear you escaped Erik's dungeons.  I would
like to know more about this."
	"Tunnels," I said.
	He raised his eyebrows.  He knew I was lying, but he dared not accuse 
me.  Had he accused me, though, I would have been forced to challenge him to 
a duel of the blades, and this was a thing I did not want to do.  
	For even without arms, he could still outfence any of us.  I feared 
him, properly.
	"You are free to stay in my house, Corbin, of course.  But if you are 
planning to use Revlon as a staging area for an attack on Ember, then you have 
come at the wrong time.  I will not permit such a thing."
	"No problem," I said.  "I appreciate your hospitality, Benedictus.  
Live long and prosper."  I wanted to ask him more about Revlon, and about the 
Housemaids and their leader Linda, whom he slew and later loved.  But there 
was no time.
	I sent Galenon to search for the explosive rouge.  For my own part, I
began to mentally organize the weaponry and personnel I would require.  As I 
walked through the forest, I decided where and how I would gather the 
necessary materiel for my war against Erik.  
	Suddenly, a woman appeared.  She was thin and freckled, and she held
a thin and freckled blade in her right hand. 
	"Wanna do it?" she asked.
	Not again, I thought.
	"Let's fence first," I said.  Her blade rose.
	She was good.  Very good.  I came on strong and aggressive at first,
but she deflected my advances with ease.  I decided to be more formal.  We
went through a series of standard exercises, after which I felt I knew her
style.  I closed with her.  Our blades met at eye level, our faces nearly
touching.  I grazed her cheek with my sword.  She pulled away, but I advanced.
I forced her back into a thicket.  She gasped.  I lunged.  She did not parry.
I lunged again.  Again.  Again.  She screamed, and so did I.  We both fell
to the ground.
	"So you wanna do it?" she asked again.
	"Give me a little break here."
	She gave me a break, and then we did it.  I asked her name.  It was
Darla.  I told her everything about Ember.  Why?  I do not know, for I am not 
a trusting person by nature.  What was the reason for my loose tongue of late?
Perhaps it was that annoying character change of mine . . .
	"Will you take me to Ember?" she asked.
	"No."
	"Please, please, please?" she pleaded.
	"I don't think you understand the danger involved.  Awaiting my
coming are the DEMONS OF EMBER."
	"What DEMONS OF EMBER?" she asked, but I did not answer.  I did not
know myself.  I bade her farewell, and promised to look her up.
	I found Galenon in a department store, haggling with the woman behind
the perfume counter.  He held a knife to her throat.
	"Hello, sonny," he said to me.  "The bitch says she doesn't know
anything about any exploding makeup.  Should I kill her?"
	I saw the fear in the woman's eyes, and I called my partner off.
	"It doesn't explode *here*, Galenon, it explodes in Ember.  Look, I 
see some of it over there."
	We bought two hundred and twelve compacts of the stuff.
	Galenon and I departed into Shade that day.  I found a Shade close to
the Earth I had inhabited for so many years, but one which was subtly
different from my old home.  To wit, the ground was littered with automatic
weapons.  We collected these weapons and took them to a more familiar Shade, 
the place where I had collected my army so many years before.  You might 
think that the inhabitants would be angry with me, for I *had* taken their 
youth from them and caused them to die uselessly in a foreign war.  But 
these people revered me as a god, and thousands of them would volunteer 
again.  I had only to ask.  
	Galenon and I arrived.  A multitude waited below us.  An old man with a
crown came to greet us.
	"I have returned!" I boomed.
	The man look displeased.  His eyes went back to the multitude.
	"Don't take it wrong," quoth he, "but, uh, you *did* take our youth 
>From us and cause them to die uselessly in a foreign war.  What do 
you, uh, want this time?"
	"Soldiers!" I boomed again.
	"Soldiers," muttered the man.  "Are we going to, uh, win this time?"
	"Of course!  But it won't be easy, for awaiting my coming are the
DEMONS OF EMBER!"
	"DEMONS OF EMBER?"
	"Indeed!  But I have brought new weapons!"  I took an automatic
rifle laced the crowd with bullets.  Many fell, my friend, but the rest 
cheered and cheered.  Their god was back.
	Recruitment went smoothly.  I only needed twenty men this time.  I
picked the best and trained them well.  Before we left, I inspected the troops.
	"Who is Erik?" I asked one of the men.
	"Beats me," he replied.
	I ran him through with my sword.  There was much blood.
	"Who is Erik?" I asked the next one, who began to sweat.
	"Erik is the Lord of . . . Lord of . . ."
	"Yes?  Yes?" I provoked.
	"Lord of . . . Ember?" he tried.
	"NO!  NO!  LORD OF EVIL!  LORD OF EVIL!"  I ran him through.  "Who
is Erik?" I screamed.
	"THE LORD OF EVIL!" they all exclaimed, elated that I hadn't run 
them through.
	Galenon and I made some final arrangements, and then we set off
for Ember.  By now, I had mastered the Axioms of Ember.  I knew that
All Roads Lead to Ember, for instance, so I picked a road and followed it,
and my men followed me.  Erik did not notice us this time.  I figured this
was due to the small size of our force.  
	"Corbin?" Galenon said.
	"Yes?" I answered.
	"Often you have mentioned the DEMONS OF EMBER which await your
coming, but I myself know nothing of such beings.  How do you *know* they 
await us?"
	"It's on the cover of the paperback," I replied.
	"What paperback?"
	"THE GUNS OF REVLON.  The one with the goofy picture on the front."
	"But book covers are notoriously unrelated to the the text that
lay between the pages.  I would wager that there *are* no DEMONS OF EMBER," 
he wagered.
	"Hmm, you may have a point.  But if you are right, then it is quite 
possible that THE GUNS OF REVLON is neither a HUGO nor a NEBULA AWARD 
WINNER.  Good God, Galenon!  I might not be a ROGER ZELAZNY hero -- I might be
living in a MICHAEL MORCOCK book!"
	"Get hold of yourself, son!" said Galenon.  "Maybe there *are* DEMONS
OF EMBER after all.  And maybe, just maybe, there is also A MYSTERIOUS FEMALE 
IN THE PERFECT KINGDOM who PORTENDS TREASON, TREACHERY -- AND OBLIVION!"
	"What does that mean, 'TREASON, TREACHERY -- AND OBLIVION'?  Never
mind.  I agree with you.  I feel we must trust The Man Who Writes Book Cover 
Blurbs, for even though he probably hasn't read this book, his is the only 
information we have to go on.  I only hope that bullets will be enough to stop 
the DEMONS OF EMBER.  Come, let us hie."
	And hie we did, until Ember was within sight.
	"Ember is within sight," I announced.
	"I know, I can see it," said Galenon.
	"You act as though you have been here before," I accused.
	"So do you, kid," he replied.
	"I *have* been here.  You've never been here.  Got that?  And why do 
you keep calling me 'kid' and 'sonny'?  I'm starting to get perturbed with 
you."
	"Sorry," he said.  Then, "Look!"
	I looked.  There was a battle already in progress.  Erik's men were
fighting hand to hand with a large force of Shade creatures.  The creatures 
were pouring in across a huge expanse of darkness, some kind of black road 
that led from deep inside Shade right up to the foot of Rivlok.  I had planned 
to take Ember by killing Erik, but now . . . 
	In one of those split-second decisions you usually wind up regretting,
I ordered my men to attack the Shade beasts rather than Erik's men.  Confused,
they carried out their orders.  O, how they died that day!  The creatures
burned and died and heaved, and I chuckled.  I diverted my attention from the
battle in order to find my brother Erik.  At last, I spotted him on the far
mountainside.  I left Galenon in charge of the battle.
	After negotiating the crags and crevices, I reached Erik.  He was lying
on his back, bleeding.  Around his neck was the Jewel of the Judge, a magical
pendant often worn by our father.
	"I . . . am . . . dying," he announced.
	"Oh yeah?" I stuttered.  "That's, uh, too bad, Erik.  Listen, about 
your Death Curse, I mean, you're not going to, I mean, well . . . you don't 
even *have* to have a Death Curse.  Not if you don't want to.  It's not like a 
law or anything.  Even if it was, what could they do to you?  I mean, you're 
dead, and if you didn't use your Death Curse, too bad--"
	"Enough!" he sputtered, spitting blood all over me.
	"Jesus Christ, that's disgusting," I observed.
	"I reserve my Death Curse for the creatures from the Black Freeway.
And I give you this Jewel.  With it, you can control the weather.  You must
attune yourself to it by wearing it and walking the Design.  You're in command 
now."  He coughed up a lung.  "You'll find that things are not what you 
expected.  Ember is in deep trouble.  Deep . . ."  He gasped for air.
	"Can I get you some water or something?" I asked.
	He mumbled his Death Curse, a horrible thing to hear.  It had an
immediate effect on the battle.  The creatures began retreating.  Erik heaved 
his last breath then.
	I took the Jewel from about his neck.  It pulsed curiously in my hands.
He had said to take it to the Design.  I signalled Galenon to pursue the 
creatures.  I headed for the castle myself.  Just inside, I ran into Randy.
	"Corbin!" he said.  "Downstairs!  Something's happening!"
	We both ran down to the Design room.  Someone was walking the Design
already!  Who was it?  I squinted, but could not make out the face.
	"Some chick," said Randy.  "Never seen her."
	I looked again.  It was Darla.
	"What do you think it means?" Randy asked.
	"It portends TREASON, TREACHERY -- AND OBLIVION!" I said.
	"What does that mean, 'TREASON, TREACHERY -- AND OBLIVION!'?"
	"Shut up for a second."  I turned to the girl and yelled, "Darla!  
What the hell are you doing?"
	She looked up at me and continued walking.  She was almost finished.
	Randy said, "So she must be of the Blood of Ember.  I thought there
were only thirteen of us."
	"There must be countless others.  You're not counting Delwyn and 
Sandy, for instance.  That makes fifteen right there."
	"Oh yeah.  How come we never talk about them?" he asked.
	"We're supposed to pretend like they don't exist."
	"For how long?" he asked.
	"Until the sixth book or so," I said.  I raised my hand.  "Wait!"
	Darla had reached the center of the Design.  She raised her hands into
the air and said:
	"Ember will be destroyed!"
	Shit, I thought.

Subject: An essay for .funny consideration
Keywords: original, laugh
Date: 16 Nov 88 03:30:03 GMT


(This was posted a week ago in talk.pol.misc, but thought I'd let you
mull it over.  It is original writing, and is typical of my callous mode
of social thought which I occasionally fall into.)

Like many people, I have been thinking about the problem of homelessness in
America's cities.  Besides the obvious suffering of the homeless people, the
spectacle of raggedly dressed people bent for warmth in the subways and bus
stations of the cities greets visitors with a pronouncedly negative image.
I have struck upon a means of eliminating the privation of the homeless while
lessening the adverse impact they have on the surrounding neighborhoods.

  At a cost of about $250 per individual, each can be outfitted with a friendly
Disney character costume.  Generous insulation and bright, stain resistant
colors would help to insure that the occupant remains warm inside and cheerful
outside.  As there are so many different characters, each participant would be
able to choose which outfit most closely fits his style.

  This landmark project would have manifold beneficial effects.  Travelers
arriving at the bus and train terminals would no longer comment on how awful
it is to be met with wave attacks of unkempt panhandlers.  Instead, their kids
could laugh and feel safe and recall fondly how Mickey greeted them upon their
arrival to the Big City.  Replace the heart-rending image of a woman swaddled
in torn clothes crouching for shelter in a shop doorway with that of a warm
and sweetly blushing Snow White settled snugly down with her pullcart of
possessions in the same alcove.  A societal blemish has been instantly
transformed into a fantasy attraction!

  The boost this program could provide to the participants' sense of self-image
would be tremendous.  They would enjoy a strong sense of camraderie.  Instead
of facing a bleak street existence alone, they would belong to a happy family
of playful ducks, dogs and chipmunks.   This would give everybody something to
be proud of.  The necessity of keeping one's uniform spiffy and one's antics
competitively endearing (to bolster handout revenues) would be easy and fun.
And, as George Bush has observed, many of the homeless people on our streets
already identify with popular cartoon figures.  The transition would be
painless for most everyone.

  Expensive and marginally effective substance abuse recovery programs could
be avoided by the simple expedient of dressing addicts and drunks as either
pink elephants or Dopey the dwarf.  A person suffering from a nervous tic could
become Pinnochio the dancing puppet boy.  Persons who habitually argue with
demons or devils could be suited up with muffled headpieces to squelch the
sudden shouts.  Creative application of the basics outlined here would enable
the adminstrators of this plan to massage away almost ANY obstacle, and allow
them to artfully blend these people back into society.

(I was first exposed to this joke when a friend of mine
put it in comic strip form for a french course homework.
I don't think he invented it himself.)

A small boy is wandering in a hotel, and hearing some noises
decides to open a door.  He says "Wow, it's dark here!"
You can imagine that there's a man with a woman in that room...
The man asks, "What do you want?  Here's a buck, leave us alone."
A bit latter, the boy goes back again, opens the door, and says:
"Wow, it's dark here!"  "Not you again!  Here, take this and
go buy yourself something."  And the boy goes out with 2 bucks.

The following morning, the boy feels some remorse, and tells what happened
to his mother.  She says: "That's wrong.  You should go to the church,
and confess yourself."

So there he goes.  Entering the boot, he says: "Wow, it's dark here!".
To which the priest says: "Are you following me around?"

My grandmother (age 70) told me this joke, original source unknown...

For a long time, Mary had a fantasy of making love with an <ethnic> man.
One night, when she was in a bar, she met a handsome <ethnic> who appeared
to be well-hung, so she figured, what the hell, she'd go for it.  So Mary asked
the fellow to come home with her.

When the two got to Mary's apartment, Mary told the <ethnic> about her fantasy,
and asked if he would be a part of it.  Well, the <ethnic>, of course, agreed,
so the two headed for Mary's bedroom.  When they got there, Mary said, "Ok,
first, I want you to undress me and tie me to the bed!"  So the <ethnic> did
so.  By this time, Mary was worked into a passionate frenzy.  She looked up
at the <ethnic> and said, "Now, big boy, do what you do best!"

So the <ethnic> picked up her VCR and left.

A pastor was visiting an elderly lady who was a "shut in."  Since she didn't
get very many visitors, she went on incessantly about her problems while the
pastor nibbled on some peanuts on the coffee table in front of him.  After
about a half hour, and with his endurance almost expended, he politely
interrupted, explaining that he had other appointments that afternoon and
said, "I'm afraid I've eaten most of your peanuts while I was listening and I
would like to leave you a couple of dollars so that you can get some more."

"No," replied the woman, "With my dentures I can't chew them.  It's all I can
do just to suck the chocolate off them."

neckties on Chanuka.

    "The boy hurried into his bedroom, ripped off the tie he was
wearing, put on one of the ties his mother had brought him, and hurried
back.  "Look, Mama! Isn't it gorgeous?"

This guy's wife was always wanting to go golfing with him and he
said he didn't think she would enjoy it.  She kept pressuring
him and finally he gave in.  

So they're on the golf course and on the first hole the guy hits
one 300 yards down the middle of the fairway, hits his second
shot three feet from the pin, and putts for a birdie.  This
lucky streak continues and he birdies 5 straight holes.
Then they get to the 6th hole.  He takes his driver and hooks
one way out into the left rough behind a barn.  They search and
search and find the ball, and he says to his wife, "I'll just
take a penalty and drop the ball out in the fairway."

His wife says, "Wait a minute!"  She walks over to the barn and
opens the door on one end and then goes to the other end and
opens that door too.  She says, "Look, honey, you can see the
hole from here!  The way you've been playing, just hit through
the barn and you'll do okay."

So he grabs a 3 iron and takes a healthy swat, and it ricochets
off the barn and hits his wife right between the eyes, killing
her instantly.

The grief-stricken man didn't play golf for several years after
his wife's death.  Until one day, his friends finally talk him
into a foursome.  They go to the same course, and amazingly,
he again birdies the first 5 holes.  They get to the 6th tee and
he hits another vicious hook behind the same barn!  They finally
find the ball and the guy says he will take a penalty drop in
the fairway.  One of his buddies says, "Wait a minute!" and runs
and opens the barn doors.

The guy screams at him, "You dirty SOB, the last time I tried
that, I took a 9 on this hole!!"

Four Oxford professors (dons, whatever...) were taking their evening walk
together and as usual, were engaged in casual but learned conversation.
On this particular evening, their conversation was about the names given
to groups of animals, such as a "pride of lions" or a "gaggle of geese."

One of the professors noticed a group of prostitutes down the block, and
posed the question, "What name would be given to that group?"  The four
fell into silence for a moment, as they pondered the possibilities...

At last, one spoke: "How about 'a Jam of Tarts'?"  The others nodded in
acknowledgement as they continued to consider the problem.  A second
professor spoke: "I'd suggest 'an Essay of Trollops.'"  Again, the
others nodded.  A third spoke: "I propose 'a Flourish of Strumpets.'"

They continued their walk in silence, until the first professor remarked
to the remaining professor, who was the most senior and learned of the
four, "You haven't suggested a name for our ladies.  What are your thoughts?"
The fourth professor replied, "'An Anthology of Prose.'"

Announcing the:


			          1988

			     REC.HUMOR.FUNNY

			 Computer Network Humour
			         Annual


I often get requests for back-jokes out of rec.humor.funny, so I have
gathered together over 600 of the better submissions from the last year
and a half, along with some unposted stuff and original cartoons, into a
compendium of this newsgroup's history.  It's laser-typeset and takes up
around 160 full sized pages.

People ask me, "Why go to all the work of editing all those jokes for
typesetting if everybody's already read them?"  Of course, they only
asked me this *after* I'd done all the work.  I did this last year as
Christmas gifts for family and friends. (Somehow I don't think they meant
books when they said, "The best Christmas gifts are the ones you make
yourself.")  Everybody really liked it, so this year I'm making them
available to net people too, for real cheap.

I think many people might want this book as a Christmas gift for their
own friends, or perhaps their enemies.  (If you give it to your mother,
I advise you rip out the ROT13 section.)  In light of this I am writing
introductory sections that explain USENET and the newsgroup to outsiders.

I have also isolated the Computer/Science/Math jokes and the USENET jokes
into their own chapters.  Non-computer folks can avoid them, and you can
read these chapters in front of your friends while laughing riotously,
allowing you to feel superior.

If you started reading the group after it began, you'll find the jokes
that you missed in this book.  (Many have said the early months had the
best submissions.)  If you're looking for a back-joke, you should find
it in here, too.   I don't relish being a joke-server, and I never re-post,
so this is now a route to get all the back-jokes at once.  (It may even
keep repeats out of rec.humor.)

I have included a "Joka-Cola Classic" section, which contains most of
the good jokes that I rejected as "too well known to the net."  When
I say that, it means I think about 50% of the readers will be tired of
the joke, but there are still many who can enjoy these.

I am also including about a dozen original cartoons and strips by world
famous comic artist Ty Templeton. (No relation.) (Ok. We share the same
parents.)  Ty currently draws the Justice League for D.C. Comics and
has foolishly turned down offers to do syndicated strips for the L.A.
Times syndicate.  Perhaps some of his fans from rec.arts.comics can
post reviews of his material to rec.humor.d.

And, of course, if far more people buy this book than I expect, I'll
actually recover the costs and effort of making it!  Aside from the
hundreds of hours I have spent moderating this group for the last 15 months,
I have also put in about 60 hours of work making several *thousand* edits and
corrections (I'm not kidding) to the jokes to make them suitable for

people, 95% of whom can't spell or punctuate, into a common form for
typesetting?  Don't try.  (I'll explain in rec.humor.d why the net

The book will cost $9.95 in U.S. funds.  Shipping costs vary on where you
are.  You can order it by mail, or via an 800 number with a major credit
card.  Details on ordering are in a follow-up posting to this one. (RHF ONLY)
(If you think this price is high, go to your local instant printer and
ask how much to do a 160 page book with binding and cover in small quantities
You will get quotes OVER the price I'm asking.)   Order soon if you want
your copy or copies in time for Christmas.

NOTE:  The discussion of issues concerning copyright and book-ordering
on USENET already took place in rec.humor.d.  That is the place if others

P.P.S: This book contains jokes with swearing, sexual references and sick
or offensive themes.  Some jokes involve racism or sexism and are in a
special section that can be removed.  This book is not suitable for children.

(This posting is a companion to the announcement of the 1988 annual, which
should have come first.)

How to order the 1988 rec.humor.funny annual from inside the USA and overseas:
(Instructions for Canada will be posted with "can" distribution.)

You can use the mail, or order using my toll free 800 number with a
major credit card.   I can send the book to you either by surface
mail (about 2 weeks) or air mail (just over 1 week) as you choose.

If you order by mail, mail a check or money order for $9.95 (US Funds)
per copy, plus the shipping/handling charges (see below) to:

	Jokebook
	c/o Looking Glass Software Ltd.
	124 King St. N.
	Waterloo, ON
	N2J 2X8

	Canada

Please include a mailing label for the return package.  A stick on label
would be great, but a plain cut piece of paper would be fine.  In your
order, include the number of copies you want, how you want them shipped,
and your EMAIL address in case there's any trouble.

		Toll Free Ordering

You can dial 1-800-265-2782 from within the continental USA to order.
(Outside, dial 1-519-884-7473)  This 800 number does not exist just for the
jokebook, so please try to keep it short so I can keep my costs down.
When you call, between 10 AM and 5 PM Eastern Standard Time, please have
ready with you:

	The type, card number and expiry date of your credit card.
	(MasterCard, Visa or American Express) Also give your name here
	if it's being mailed to a different person.

	The name and address to ship the book to.

	The number of books and type of shipping.

	Your EMAIL address in case there's any problem.


Here's the tricky part.  If you order by credit card, you will be billed
in Canadian dollars.  Your bank will do an exchange for you and bill you
in U.S. dollars.  The current rate in the paper is around $0.81 USD = $1 CAN.
We will bill you at this rate ($12.25 CDN for the book), but your bank's
rate will vary.

You can also order by E-MAIL if you are crazy enough to include your
credit card information in non-secure USENET mail.  Mail to
jokebook@looking.UUCP.

Sorry, we can't C.O.D. over the border.

		SHIPPING/HANDLING CHARGES TO THE USA

	Surface (Book) Rate			Air Mail (1st Class)

	1  -  $2				1  -  $4
	2-4 - $4				2  -  $7
	5-6 - $6				3  -  $9
						4  - $10

If you order by credit card, the above prices will be converted to
Canadian dollars and charged as such on your credit card bill, to be
converted back to U.S. dollars by your bank as described above.

		OVERSEAS SHIPPING CHARGES (U.S. Dollars)

	1 Book Air Mail - $7
	1 Book Surface - $4
	2 Books Surface - $6


I won't bill your credit card or cash your check until we send the
book to you!

If a group wants to get together and order 20 or more, I can do a
discount and arrange cheaper or faster shipping, like UPS.

Yes, this is advertising on the net.  With luck, it will cut down
joke duplications and calls for old jokes, saving the net money.
If you want to discuss this again, go to rec.humor.d.  Do not send this
message over the ARPANET.

(NO, I didn't set all this up just to order books.  I run a software
company, so all the mechanism for this is already in place.)

This was published in The South Texas Fisherman, sometime 1972.  I'd
like to take credit for it but the "Bill Kennedy" author is Sr, I'm Jr.

TALKING TO FISH
by Bill Kennedy

A character in one of Shakespeare's plays, boasting of his accomplishments
said "I can call up monsters from the vasty deep."  Any fisherman could have
given the answer: "So can I and so can any man, but will they come?"  Men
and women have been calling to fish, pleading with them and swearing at them
without response since the beginning of time.  A federally supported research
project may change that situation.

Working with the whale family (porpoise or dolphin), scientists in Florida
have set out to translate fish language.  They are not far along yet but
have made some headway.  Various clicks and whistles have been recorded
that indicate, at least in the whale family, one fish has a way to commun-
icating what is on his mind to another fish.  If the research continues as
planned, it should be only a matter of time until man will be able to
reporoduce fish noises and communicate what is on his mind to bass, perch,
and catfish.

All right-minded fishermen agree that fish-talk research projects should
be cancelled and the scientists in it forced to seek other employment.
The reasoning behind this point of view is simple and sound.  If the
research continues to its logical conclusion, fishing will cease to be
the pleasant and relaxing sport that it now is.  Fishing will become a
business of bellowing speeches in fish language designed to convince fish
that they would be better off on the bank or in the boat than they are in
the water.  In such circumstances any fool knows who the men that will
catch all the fish will be.  They will be politicians!

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.  This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

I left out one very important thing from the ordering information.  If
you want to order by mail, make the cheque payable to Looking Glass Software

Also, as I noted in an earlier joke posting, my office is open Thursday &
Friday.   Sorry to clog up the group like this.  I usually try to keep the
volume nice and low, and based on what I've had to accept recently to keep
it at 60/month, perhaps I should keep it lower.   Oh yeah, in the USA, it's
OK if you write a check instead of a cheque.  I'll accept either.

  I never did understand why it was supposed to be MEN that were responsible
  for the keeping of the toilet seat!  Some women consistently complain (note
  the SOME) when men leave the seat up, and also complain when men don't put
  the seat up to begin with.  Now I find the second disgusting, no one wants
  to sit on a wet toilet seat.  But if the last person in the bathroom was
  female, the men are expected to lift the seat.  

  OK, I didn't post this last time it came around, but here is the

  As an historical note, I left a military sub-contractor (which is why
the notice is cast in Milspeak) and lived for 3 weeks with a friend of
the female persuasion, who constantly got on my case to keep the seat
down.  I vowed revenge when I got my own apartment, so

                  NOTICE TO USERS

  The Water Closet Site Administrator (WCSITADMIN) for this
commode equipment unit has elected a Most Recently Used (MRU)
protocol with regard to the seat placement for the equipments
at this site.

  All users are requested to make determination as to their
gender and intended use before attempting to use these equipments.
Users should then determine the desired seat placement, based on
this information, and chart 1, attached.  Having made this deter-
mination, users should compare the actual seat placement, as
determined by direct observation, with the desired seat placement
determined above, and take the appropriate action, based on chart
2, attached.

  It should be noted that the MRU protocol confers the following
advantages vice the more commonly attempted INTHAMITH protocol:

       Worst-case turn-around is improved, as in no case are
        two seat-adjustments required.

       Worst-case throughput is improved, for above reasons.

       Average-case throughput (random gender and use) is
        improved, as no compensating adjustments are performed.

       Average-case throughput as measured is improved due to
        uneven gender distribution among users of a given equipment.

       Wear and tear on the adjustment mechanism is reduced,
        yielding a greater MTBF.

       User feedback is immediate and automatic, yielding a
        higher compliance rate.

  Comments should be addressed to the WCSITADMIN.

A Vaseline salesman is driving through the country, when his car starts
leaking and loses all its oil.  Not knowing what to do, he fills the
engine with Vaseline, thinking that it is similar to oil, and drives away.
It works fine until about half an hour later, when the engine gets real
warm, and the Vaseline melts, and runs out through the same hole as the
oil did.  This time there is a farm nearby, so he decides to look for a 
phone.  

	Meanwhile, inside the farmhouse, the farmer, his wife, and daughter
are having a fight about who's going to do the dishes.  "I did them this
morning," complains the farmer.  "Well I did them at lunch," says his wife.
"And I'm tired from doing all the farmwork," says the daughter.  So the
farmer, in a stroke of brilliance, decides that they will settle it by all
taking off their clothes, lying on the floor, and declaring that the first
one to speak gets to do the dishes.

	The Vaseline saleman gets to the front door, and rings the bell.
No one answers so he goes in and looks for a phone.  He eventually stumbles
into the kitchen, and ignoring the odd sight, asks for a phone.  No one
answers, so he goes and looks some more.  Still no luck, so he goes back to
the kitchen.  They still won't answer, so he decides to see what else he
can get away with.  He has sex with the daughter several times, bemused by
her silence, then finally goes and looks for the phone again.  A while
later, he comes back, looks at the wife, and says, "Why not?"  After having
sex with the farmer's wife, he is getting tired and exasperated.  He
thinks, maybe if they have some Vaseline, I can drive my car for another
half-hour.  So he asks, "Do you have any Vaseline?" at which the farmer
jumps up and yells, "I'll do the dishes!"

This week is a perfect opportunity to find out the true age of those individuals
who are always evasive on the point. Just ask them what they were doing when
they heard about president Kennedy's assassination! They will be telling you 
long before they realise that you can add 25 to what you can easily surmise 
to be their age at the time of the said activity.

   A great Soviet general was once asked by his adjutant, "Comrade General,
what is the meaning of Marxist dialectic?"

   The general replied, "I will explain it to you with an example. A filthy
man is standing outside a bath house. Will he go in?"

   "Of course," replied the adjutant.

   "No, you're wrong," said the general.  "A filthy man is filthy by his nature,
and will not go in to the bath house. Only clean men, knowing the virtues of
cleanliness, will bathe."

   "I understand, comrade general."

   "Now, let me give you another example.  A filthy man is standing outside 
a bath house.  Will he go in?"

   "Absolutely not," replied the adjutant immediately.

   "You're wrong again," said the general.  "Why should a filthy man not
enter a bath house? He is dirty, the bath house is there to enable him to
become clean, and he will use it."

   "I think I understand, comrade."

   "Now, one last example.  A filthy man is standing outside a bath house.
Will he go in?"

   "How the hell should I know?"

   "Now, comrade, you truly understand the meaning of Marxist dialectic."

A Scotsman was sick and in hospital. His doctors were afraid that
this was to be the end of him since nothing they did could do anything
to make him healthy. His physician asked him if there was anything
that he could do to make him more comfortable in his final hours.
The Scot replied, "If I could only hear the pipes one more time it would
make me very happy." So the doctor arranged for a piper to come into the
room and play for the dying man.

When the Scot heard the pipes the color came back into his cheeks, his
eyes became bright, his breathing was easier, and he got up and danced
around the room. He was completely cured! Later, while recounting the
tale to his fellows over lunch the doctor confessed that this was a
miracle cure that he couldn't explain. When the pipes began to play
the Scotsman was cured. The only problem he could see was that 2
Englishmen in for checkups died.

      Upon opening the envelope, a letter enclosed told of how a little old
lady who had never asked for anything in her life, was desperately in need of 
$100 and was wondering if God could send her the money.

      Well the young lady was deeply touched and made a collection from her 
fellow workmates and collected $90 and sent it off to the old lady.  A few
weeks later another letter arrived addressed to God, so the young lady opened
it and it read "Thank you for the money, God, I deeply appreciate it, however
I only received $90.  It must have been those bastards at the Post Office."

Well, if Brad can read this, according to my understanding of the
laws down here, you will win a law suit for libel and defamation of
character.  Under these circumstances, since JEDR's attacks on your
character have injured your corporate image, I would seriously

Has anyone called Brad up at LGS for a rebuttal of U. Waterloo's action?

Even though he has no net access, he should be given some sort of path
to comment on U. Waterloo's inappropriate actions.

BTW, I agree with Gene.  Something should be done with an *educational*

First let me say that I am as offended and outraged as any of us over this
sorry state of affairs.  I volunteered ssbn some time back and offered to
pay the LD to hook up looking again because I feared the situation would
deteriorate as it has done.

Brad very graciously and thoughtfully replied and essentially told me
to "cool it", I might do more harm than good.  I wish I had saved the
note but he asked me not to.  I shall attempt a very poor paraphrase
of what he said.  I'm sure it won't be as accurate but you'll get the
drift and I think that's what's important here.

First my own thoughts, then essentially what Brad said.  I think that the
folks at watmath caved in to a misinformed public opinion made up by an
ignorant news media.  I honestly believe that if you could wring the truth
out of them that they are really on Brad's side.  Obviously we can't
wring the truth out of them because it would leak to the media and further
inflame what they are trying to extinguish.  It appears to us like they
have just completed the character assasination started by JEDR and others.
I'm sure that this appearance grieves and angers them as much as it does
us.  They are an educational institution and when nonsense like this
appears to dilute or pollute their primary function they have to stick by
their priorities.  Their priorities even if that means doing something that
isn't what you or I (or they) might think is "right".  An unpleasant but very
real situation and decision.  We're all faced with them from time to time.

Sorry for that, I promised to share Brad's feelings.  First off I think
that he should get a round of applause from us for being so level headed
about this.  He pointed out that the netters know more about the situation
and the culture of usenet than anyone involved.  The situation is so
ridiculous that it provokes us to outrage and cry vengeance.  This behavior
on our part, how ever justified, is perceived by the outside world to be
precisely what JEDR claims, i.e. we (inadvertantly) confirm his story and
vouch for his credibility.  The operative word there is "perceived".
Regardless of how well intentioned, morally correct, or justifiably
indignant we might be, that's how it's perceived outside our own community.
In short, we're hurting him by trying to help.  I must very reluctantly
agree with Brad and concede that while it's wrong, it's that way :-( :-(

As dearly as I'd love to fry the people who started this I will not further
their cause by doing so.  BTW, the :-('s are mine, they conclude what Brad
said last week.  Gene Spafford pleaded with us for moderation and asked us
all to shut up and let this blow over, he is correct too.  With great
reluctance I will do that (in a few sentences :-) and find something to do
with my outrage...  an obscure part of the Hippocratic commitment is
"Prima non nocere", First do no harm.  I propose that we treat JEDR and
the prepetrators of this atrocity like the pariahs that they are, but not
try to exact vengeance on others who got swept up in it. *NOW* I'll shut up.

Apologies to Gene Smith, his just happened to be the article that suggested
precisely what Brad doesn't want.

Earlier today I posted a plea for moderation in this ridiculous
(and outrageous) matter.  That was essentially asking us to all
shut up.  So here, on the heels of asking everyone to shut up,
yet another article.  I want to reach the people who are still
reading about this, the admins and readers.  What I am going to
describe is completely speculation on my part, I have nothing
to confirm what I'm describing.

The earlier post asked that we not inadvertantly injure Brad and
or his situation by raving or threatening retaliation.  I will
propose a more sinister but entirely possible scenario which may
even be true.

Fact:  JEDR and Brad have been conspicuously silent lately.
Fact:  Someone posted a few days ago suggesting that if a
       situation got too far out of hand that legal remedies
       could be pursued.

Speculation:  Maybe legal remedies are being pursued and that's
       why neither party has anything to say.  Further, if that
       is the case we might be doing a severe disservice to what
       ever side we favor by caterwauling about one or the other.
       Wouldn't you feel like an utter fool if the article you
       posted turned out to be the legal evidence that caused
       the remedy to not go in the direction you supported?

I do not want to sound like you're being read your rights but if the
speculation happens to be accurate then we might be hoist by our own
petard making threatening or damaging remarks.  I'm not proposing that
we shut down the discussion, but I am asking that we be very careful
to not provide any fuel for the fire that exists or for another that
we don't even know about.  I don't think the speculation is too far
fetched or I wouldn't have asked for your time to read it.

worker and goes, "pppphhhhbbbttttt!" to his face. Well, this time the
big guy has had enough of the little guy's manners and walks over 
to the fellow with the Leprechaun, again on his shoulder. 

The construction worker tells this fella, "If your little friend 
does that again, I'm gonna cut off his little dick!"  The fellow
tells the big guy "Well Leprechauns don't have dicks." The big
guy asks, "Well how does he go pee?" The fellow with the Leprechaun
on his shoulder looks at the big guy and goes, "ppppphhhhbbbbtttttt."

SANTA CLAUS IS WEILDING A GUN
(to the tune of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town")

Oh, you better watch out
You better not pry
You better stay back
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is wielding a gun

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who
He's gonna ice
Santa Claus is wielding a gun

Don't give him any trouble
He'll blow you right away
Don't give him any cause to shoot
Or you'll make his Christmas Day

Oh, you better believe
He's packing a rod
No coal in your stocking
Just lead in your bod
Santa Claus is wielding a gun

He doesn't want cookies
Or none of that crud
He doesn't want milk
What he wants is your blood
Santa Claus is wielding a gun

(Music Bridge, with automatic arms fire)

He doesn't trust nobody
Shot all his reindeer dead
Thought Dancer was a sissy
And thought Rudoulph was a red

Oh, you better watch out
You better not pry
You better stay back
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is wielding a gun

My friend Bruce tells a story of when he was a teenager and he and his
brother were looking at magazines in a drugstore, under a big sign that
said "No Loitering".  An older, female drugstore employee came up to
them, said "Can't you read?", and pointedly looked up at the sign.
Bruce's brother Norm--who didn't really know what loitering meant--
looked at her, looked at the sign, looked back at her, and said: "So,
who's smoking?"  She was so flustered that she left them alone.

      place ... or is it?

  +  "Even I Hate My Guts!"  To prove it, Geraldo goes under local

      nose, too.

  +  "Sirhan Sirhan Is Innocent!"  Geraldo blows the lid off the Robert

      three names can be infamous killers, e.g. Lee Harvey Oswald,
      James Earl Ray, Mark David Chapman, John Wayne Gacy, etc.

{ed  A "JEDR" (pronounced "Jedder") is a generic member of a lampooned
  identifiable group.  It stands for "Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race" and
  can refer to members of any such group, and others. This acronym does
  not refer to any specific person or group. }

Well, a young JEDR woman got married, you see, and as is traditional
with JEDR custom, she was a virgin and new nothing of the ways of
Luv.

On her wedding night, she ran downstairs to her mother and cried,
"Momma, momma, what do I do?"

Her mother replied, "Don't you worry, girl. Just lie back and enjoy
yourself."

So the girl went back upstairs to where her husband was waiting.
When she entered the room, she found that he'd removed his shirt,
and his arms and chest were very broad, and very hairy.

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta BIG HAIRY CHEST!"

Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta a
big hairy chest, that just mean he gotta BIIIIG love muscle. You
go back uppa there and have a good time."

So back up the stairs she went. This time, when she entered the room,
her husband had removed his trousers, and she saw his strong, muscly,
hairy legs.

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta THICK HAIRY LEGS!!" 

Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta
thick hairy legs, that just mean he gotta LARGE junket pump. You
go back uppa there and lie down and enjoy yourself."

So back up she goes. As she enters the room, she sees his feet for
the first time - and one of them is half missing!

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta FOOT AND A HALF!!"

Her mother rushed upstairs with the words, "Outa my way, girl.
This is a job for your momma!"

(Told to me by my girlfriend, who was told by a young JEDR girl.)

Someone recommended a topical creme guaranteed to prolong erection.  When asked
later whether it worked, Groucho replied, "I came rubbing the stuff on."

**********************************

	A guest on Groucho Marx's "You Bet Your Life" television show was a
woman who had given birth to twenty-two children.  "I love my husband," the
woman explained sheepishly.

Subject: Anouncing badnews
Keywords: usenet, original, chuckle

Announcing badnews*, a realistic approach to Usenet.

Why badnews?
The news software currently in use freely mixes policy with mechanism and 
actually creates obtacles for its user community.  In practice, this inhibits
no one and merely results in frustration which, as has been clinically proved,
leads to aggression.  The time has come to give users what they really want.

Badnews fixes the following bugs in previous news software:
1) Due to a bug, previous news read/post programs limited the 'cancel' command
   to the users own postings.  Badnews fixes this problem.
2) Previous signatures were limited to 4 lines.  Badnews supports arbitrarily
   large signatures.  If your signature is too small, badnews will pad it with
   such cute sayings as "flames >/dev/null" and the like.
3) Previous software insisted that followup additions be longer than included
   text.  In this interim release, badnews fixes this restriction by 
   automatically generating extra lines of cute sayings like "inews fodder".
4) To avoid wasting bandwidth caused by articles failing to reach their 
   intended target, badnews will refuse to post articles not crossposted to
   at least 4 newsgroups.
5) Due to a design error, previous news software actually discouraged thoughtful
   postings and selected for ego-maniacs and one-true-wayists by trying to 
   intimidate the poster asking if they "really wanted to do this".  Badnews
   will be more supportive and say "Thank you for sharing."
6) Current software encourages a bandwidth wasting redundancy by requiring a 
   'Subject:' line when the actual subject (if any) can always be inferred 
   from the article itself.  Badnews eliminates this redundancy by
   automatically generating a contentless or irrelevant 'Subject:' such as
   "Help needed", "Posting", or "This line intentionally left blank".

New commands available:
1) The 'Sue' command automatically initiates a lawsuit against the author of
   the currently read message.
2) The 'Expand' command automatically decrypts many common abbreviations which
   may appear in the currently read message, such as: IMHO, PC, SO, BTW, MOTAS,
   BMW, MES
3) The 'Suicide' command automatically deposits the users name in other
   users' kill files.  In this interim release, this command is limited to
   adding your name to Ted Kaldis's kill file.
4) The 'Notify' command contacts powerful people associated with the currently
   read message.  Current options include:  notify employer, notify sysadmin,
   and notify the press.
5) The 'Sexchange' command automatically switches the genders in the message
   currently being read.  The interim release limits this function to two
   genders.

New posting aids:
Many postings are actually the same or similar to messages sent before.  In
order to make such duplication easier, Badnews provides automatic posting on
common topics selected from a menu.  Menus currently available will cover
1) Hoaxes/urban legends
2) Requests for money
3) Jokes about strings
4) Commonly asked questions (e.g. How do I get my current directory to print
   out in my prompt?)
5) A SERIOUS DILEMMA FOR THE NET
6) Appropriate flames to respond to the user using 1-5 above
7) Appropriate counter flame to respond to user using 6 above

Future enhancements will include:
1) Kill with prejudice which will notify via mail (with appropriate nasty 
   epithets) the author of any article being killed.
2) Kill by gender, ethnic group, political slant
3) Auto-forge to fake the header of real or non-existent persons.
4) The 'Pull' command to pull another user's net account.
5) Kill with extreme prejudice, to actually terminate the life of a user.
6) Starwars, to build a shield to protect oneself from 1-5 above.

Followups or requests for Beta versions should go to alt.paranoid.

* Badnews is a trademark of Charletanics

12 Year Old Guinness Record Holder Dead

(AP) December 18, 1988 - Streetly, England - Mario Morby, a 12 year old
record holder in the "Guinness Book of World Records", was killed yesterday
when he asphyxiated under the weight of hundreds of thousands of postcards
that accidentally toppled on him.  Morby, a cancer patient currently
in remission, collected the postcards from supporters all over the world
who took sympathy on his condition.  The bulk of Morby's collection,
estimated at over 2 million with 30,000 arriving daily, was turned over
to an auction house for disposal.  Morby had retained about 500,000 of
the nicer ones.

Florida Child's Wish Come True, Inc. publicized Mario's
wish for postcards.  "Had we realized the trouble that we caused,
we would have never gotten involved," said Frances Keefe, the founder of
the Spring Hill, Florida organization that specializes in satisfying the
last wishes of dying children.  They used the pseudonym "David" when
requesting postcards on Morby's behalf.  "It makes us heartsick," Keefe
continued, "to realize that we have contributed to this gentle child's
death.  He was in remission, and his spirits were up.  Those postcards
were his life."

Morby's body was discovered by the family dog, who notified
the district constable.  Foul play is not suspected.

Ross McWhirter, author of the "Guinness Book of World Records", said in
a prepared statement that "it is ironic that Morby's record has been 
overshadowed by that of another boy named 'David' who is dying of 
leukemia.  In tribute to Morby, however, we have decided to enter him 
in a new catagory in the mid-year 1989 update edition: 
'Most Senseless Death'."

Contributions in Morby's memory may be made to Florida Child's Wish

  The interviewer was sort of disappointed.  "What about the hook at the

  "I lost it in a sword fight with the Captain of the Guard."

  Again the reporter was disappointed.  "Certainly there's an exciting

Three conventioneers had finally managed to tire their wives to go back to

was crestfallen.

"Sorry fellows, all the girls are busy...  No one left but me."

"Gee, we spent most of the evening getting rid of our wives and we're leaving
 tomorrow, isn't there anything you can do?"

"Well there's always me, I give specials..."

The first guy decided he'd go for it and when he came back downstairs he had
a grin ear to ear.

"How was it?  How much was it?"

"It was great!  I got the $25 special.  She has this can of Readi-Whip and
 she sprays it all around and then licks it off, great!"

The second fellow doesn't hesitate, bolts up the stairs and is back after a
while, grinning like the first.

"How was it?  How much was it?"

"It was super!  I got the $50 special.  Same as Jack, the Readi-Whip, but
 she had some chopped walnuts that she sprinkled on it.  Nibbled off the
 walnuts and licked off the Readi-Whip, faantaaastic!"

The third could not be constrained, he raced up the stairs and came back
shortly thereafter, chin between his knees.

"Gosh!  What happened?  What went wrong?"

"Well, I got the $75 special, kinda like what you guys got but she starts
 with a pineapple ring.  Then there's the Readi-Whip, the chopped walnuts,
 but she's got some chocolate sprikles and a cherry she puts on top.  Damn!

One day an older fella was in for a checkup.  After his examination, his
doctor was amazed.

"Holy cow!  Mr. Edwards, I must say that you are in the greatest shape of
any 64 year old I have ever examined!"

"Did I say I was 64?"

"Well, no, did I read your chart wrong?"

"Damn straight you did!  I'm 85!"

"85!!  Unbelievable!  You would be in great shape if you were 25!  How old
was your father when he died?"

"Did I say he was dead?"

"You mean..."

"Damn straight!  He's 106 and going strong!"

"My Lord!  What a healthy family you must come from!  How long did your
grandfather live?"

"Did I say he was dead?"

"No!  You can't mean..."

"Damn straight!  He's 126, and getting married next week!"

"126!  Truly amazing, Mr. Edwards.  But gee, I wouldn't think a man would
want to get married at that age!"

"Did I say he _wanted_ to get married?..."

>From former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker according
to the Wall Street Journal:

  A parrot fancier who happened into a London pet shop noticed a
particularly colorful bird and asked its price.

  "Five thousand pounds," the shop owner replied.

  "Five thousand pounds?" the man asked.  "Why so much?"

  "Well, this bird speaks fluent Italian, Spanish and French, is
brushing up on his German and starting to study English," came the
reply.  "With the European Community's unicifation due in 1992, he'll
be a great asset."

  "I don't care about the Common Market," the parrot fancier said.
"What about that gray one in that other cage?"

  The gray one was 15,000 pounds, he was told, because the bird spoke
Arabic, Chinese, and Korean and was learning Japanese -- "the
languages of the 21st century."

  "I'm too old to worry about the 21st century," the frustrated parrot
lover replied.  "What about that mangy brown one up on that perch in
the corner?"

  The brown one, said the shopkeeper, was 25,000 pounds.

  "Twenty-five thousand pounds!" exclaimed the customer.  "What does
he do to worth that?"

  "We're not sure," the pet-shop owner replied.  "But the other two
call him chairman."

Once upon a time, there was a village.

The people in the village were extremely conservative.  No one talked
about sex.  Newlyweds had to figure out how to do such business on
their own because no one ever talked about it in their lifetime.

A mischievous couple decided to pull a practical joke on a pair of
people getting married.

The man pulled the groom-to-be aside and talked to him privately:
"I know it is not appropriate to talk to you about sex life.  But
you are getting married soon, I don't want you to get hurt."

"What is it? What is it?  Let me know," the ignorant groom eagerly asked.

The man first told him what sex was all about.  And he said,
"But ... , you have to be careful.  Some women grow teeth in their
'private place'.  Some poor men have lost their valuable body part to
these ruthless jaws."

"How should I find out?  What should I do on the first night?"

"Fear not, young man.  Let me tell you what to do.  Don't take
any risks.  On the first night, test her first with your knee."


The woman also talked to the bride-to-be in private:
"You are getting married soon.  I cannot resist warning you..."

The bride also eagerly asked for advice.

The woman first explained to her what would happen in bed the first
night, then she said, "Some men have a HUGE life-threatening penis.  
If you have sex with this type of man, you may not survive."

"Oh, please help me.  What should I do?" The bride was scared.

"Well, let me tell you what I did on my first night," she lied.
"I sharpened my finger nails and put my hand in front of my 
vulnerable spot, and grabbed anything that approached."


In the wedding night, the shy newlywed slipped into bed in pitch
darkness.  Moments later, both screamed in horror.

... And they slept separately ever after.

God, sitting on his throne, called up Reagan. 

"Ronald, my son, what have you to say for yourself?"

"I tried to improve the US economy", replied Reagan, "and I did my best to
benefit the nation."

"Very well, my son, come up and sit beside me at my right hand."

And so Reagan sat at his right.

God then called up Gorbachev.

"Mikhail, my son, what have you to say for yourself?"

"I tried to make Soviet society more open", replied Gorbachev, "and I did
my best to improve the Soviet economy."

"Very well, my son, come up and sit beside me at my left hand."

And so Gorbachev sat at his left.

God then called up Thatcher.

"Margaret, my daughter, what have you to say for yourself?"

"Only two things", replied Thatcher. 
"First of all, I'm not your daughter. Secondly, get out of my chair!"

	I have been subjected to the biases and special pleadings of the 
artsy-fartsy culture vultures long enough. They sneer at anything which isn't
in their own mold (mould?) of avante-gardishness. They perpetuate stupid jokes
by laughing at people who quite seriously say, "I may not know much about....
but I know what I like."
	It is time for the rest of us to revolt against this claptrap of
self-indulgent behaviour which passes itself off as "the actualization of
one's self potential," and which somehow has unfortunately [in Canuckland,
at least] bedeviled enough politicians that fully 65.7% of our tax dollars
go to supporting these alleged artistes through direct grants and purchases
of junk that any sensible person would pay someone else to haul off to the
municipal landfill site. It is time for a new organization to be formed
to aid this revolution. To that end, I hereby announce the formation of

		The P.L.O. 

	The Philistine Liberation Organization welcomes as new members
anyone who supports this cause. The basic tenets of the PLO are divided
into two general categories: things we like and things we don't like. An 
overall score of 80% qualifies you for membership.

Things we like:
1. Montovani's music - great stuff, easy listening.
2. McDonald's burgers - great taste, fast service, ok price.
3. Vinyl instead of leather for gloves, clothing, upholstery, etc.
	- cheaper, requires less care, more durable.
4. Canadian wine - good high for the buck.
5. Shopping at K-mart - hey, they got some good stuff there, ya know.
6. Commodore 64s - good games and they're real computers, too.
7. Shopping Mall landscape art - ain't it amazing how real that stuff looks.
8. Barry Manilow's songs - they capture the true meaning of life.
9. Hockey Night in Canada, Monday Night ____ball, etc. - great entertainment.
10. "If I have to go to a 'concert', I hope they play some marches - you
	know, something I can hum along with and tap my feet to."

Things we don't like:
1. Real flowers - they wilt and need care - plastic's much better.
2. BMW's, Mercedes, etc. - I'll take an Econoline any day.
3. Gourmet food - so little food, such bad tastes, such high prices!
4. 100% wool or cotton - they require too much and too costly care - give me
	polyester or acrylic any day.
5. Symphony orchestra concerts - especially playing 20th century music.
6. Real wood furniture - vinyl laminate is easier to care for and harder
	to damage.
7. Birkenstock Sandals - footware of the truly effete snobs.
8. "Serious" drama - hey, for $25 it had better make me laugh a lot.
9. Pictures that aren't pictures of anything. 
10. "Cocktail" parties that serve only Perrier and vegetables.

	Want to join the P.L.O.? ok, you're probably already a member then.
Want to add to the tenets? E-mail your suggestions to me, and I'll keep a 
list.

On the subject of interns examining overweight women, the symptoms of
pregnancy are often masked by obesity.  The brother-in-law of a friend
told me the first part of this story; my cousin told me the second.
Both are now doctors, and both assured me that the stories are true.

In attempting to do a vaginal/cervical exam on a very overweight woman
the intern could not make room to do his work.  He finally enlisted
the aid of two orderlies who wrapped the woman's legs in sheets and
pulled them apart.  Still not having enough room, the intern pushed a
chair between her legs and made his diagnosis:

"You're pregnant," he said.  "But how you got that way without two
sheets and a chair is beyond me."

After making a similar comment, my cousin was informed by the
patient, "You're not the first short-dick white boy to tell me that."

The following is a light hearted look at american football. Hit 'n'
now if you are offended easily by random sillyness that pokes fun
at americans.

 
Well nothing much has happened in the world of sports.  It is the superbowl 
today however, this is a United States event (I would have said American 
however I am in North America and would not like to be included in this 
tradition).  The event is a game where large brainless men smash into each 
other in order to advance a pig's skin, shaped in an oblong fashion, to the 
opponent's end of a 100 yard field.  Many people will wager on this event and
still many more will watch it with non-financial interests.  Many beer and 
car making corporations will vie for an advertising spot during the game by 
paying them largest amounts of money ever recorded for a Television spot 
in history.  They often try to get the brainless players to endorse their 
products first hand.  This seems very illogical as these men are not known 
for their acting abilities and they are usually retired players of superbowl 
past.  They also firmly believe that miller light is either less filling or 
it tastes great, but never both at once.  Sometimes musicians and comedians 
help the brainless men because they are more inclined to acting.

  Well back to the actual game.  This superbowl activity does not have 
anything to do with tupperware parties.  It is the final game of a season's 
worth of FOOTBALL.  The word football is used for this game to piss off the 
British who refer to their game of soccer as football.  This makes 
more sense, as soccer is played mostly with the foot and the superbowl is not.
It is also worthy to note that the vast majority of the planet prefers the 
game of soccer to that of U.S. football. They hold a world championship every
year in soccer that the U.S. is never a contender in.  The U.S. has in turn 
retaliated by coining the term "World Series" to the American game of 
baseball. (which the central Americans are much better at playing then native 
U.S. players).
    
  Well once again getting off the topic of the game.  Men named after 
various body parts (quarter back, tight end) line up facing each 
other and when certain grunts have been uttered they run into each other.  
The team with the pig then tries to pass it through the line of men.  They 
have three chances to move the ball 10 yards.  If they do not succeed they get 
angry and kick the ball at the opponent's side of the field.  The opponents 
then try to return the ball until they get mad and kick it back.
SUCCESS When a goal is scored.

If by chance one team should get the pig's skin into the opposing teams end 
of the field a strange and bizzare ritual occurs.  First the pig is thrown as
hard as possible into the ground where it doesn't stay. Instead it bounces 
madly across the field and forgotten.  Sometimes this step is replaced by the
team member dancing with the pig's skin held high in the air and running 
towards other team members.  Step two is the same in both cases.  The men all
rush together and hug each other and pat each other vigorously on the bottom. 
The coach of the team will hug his co-coaches and smile with admiration.  
Step three consists of a replay of the whole event for television viewers 
and those advertisers who want to know who should endorse their products for 
next year.

The purpose of winning the game is that these goal scorers from the winning 
team only will be asked to advertise for the corporations. The losers will 
not be invitied.

When the game is over the wining team will pour cheap champagne all over each 
other in the dressing room where women reporters will not be admitted, but the 
men will undress in front of the television cameras anyway.  The cameras will
show the losing team crying in their locker room. The most endorsable 
player will be chosen just in case the advertisers could not figure out which 
player this should be.
    
This my friend is a United States dream come true.

A new sales assistant was hired at a large dept. store.  On his first day, the
sales manager took him around to show him the ropes.  They were passing by
the gardening section, when they heard a customer asking for grass seed.
The sales manager stepped in.

SM: Excuse me, but will you be needing a hose to water your lawn? 

C : I guess so. I'll take one.

SM: And how about some fertilizer and weed-killer ? 

C : Um, okay. 

SM: Here's a couple of bags. You'll also need a lawn mower to cut the grass
    when it starts growing too long.

C : I'll take one of those too.

After the customer left, the sales manager turned to the assistant. "You see?" 
he said, "that's the way to make a good sale.  Always sell more than what
the customer originally came in for."

Impressed, the assistant headed off for the pharmaceutical section, where
he was to work.  Soon, a man strolled in.      

MAN: I'd like to buy a pack of Tampax, please.

SA : Sure, and would you like to buy a lawn mower too?

MAN: Why would I want to do that?

SA : Well, your weekend's shot to hell anyway, so you might as well mow the
lawn.

April 1, 1988:   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered
by physicists at Turgid University.  The element, tentatively named
Administratium (Ad), has no protons or electrons, which means that its atomic
number is 0.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron,
75 vice-neutrons, and 111 assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives it an 
atomic mass number of 312.  The 312 particles are held together in the nucleus
by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called 
memoons.

	Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be
dectected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which it is
present.  According to Dr. M. Langour, one of the discoverers of the element, a
very small amount of Administratium made one reaction that normally takes less
than a second take over four days.

	Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which
 time it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in
which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the
vice-neutrons exchange places.  Some studies have indicated that the atomic
mass number actually increases after each reorganization.

	Administratium was discovered by accident when Dr. Languor angrily
resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped all of his
papers into the intake hatch of the university's particle accelerator. 
"Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports, grant forms, etc. with
the particles in the accelerator created the new element."  Dr. Langour 
explained.

	Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium
might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist, 
Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university campuses,
near the best-appointed and best-maintained buildings.

"Daddy, what are you doing?" asked little Johnny.

His father looked around nervously wondering what
he could tell his son.

I, um, I'm just checking out the bathroom for mice."
replied his father.

Johnny looked at his father with a gaze of confusion
and said, "Well, what are you doing?  Fucking them?"

  Three English gentlemen, all properly attired, were sitting in a train
  compartment while traveling thru the English countryside.  All three busily
  engrossed in reading their London Times.  Naturally, not having been
  properly introduced, they did not speak to each other.  The quiet in the
  compartment was disturbing.

  Finally, one gentleman, put his paper down and declared, (in your best
  veddy veddy British accent), "Sir James Hyde-White, here.  Brigadier,
  retired.  Oxford, '59.  Married.  Two sons, both Royal Marine officers," and 
  promptly went back to reading his paper. 

  A short while later, the second gentleman put down his paper and declared,
  (again, in very upper class british accent), "Sir Jonathen Colin-Simpson,
  here.  Brigadier, retired.  Eton, '61.  Married.  Two sons, both Royal Air
  Force pilots," and he promptly went back to reading his paper.  
  
  A few miles down the track, the third gentleman put down his paper and 
  stated, (now use your best irish-cockney accent), "Ian McTavish 'ere.
  Sergeant Major, retired.  Coldstream Guards.  Not married.  Two sons.
  Both Brigadiers."

Taken from 'The Jokes of Oppression: The Humor of Soviet Jews'.

Question:  What does friendship among Soviet nationalities mean?
Answer:	   It means that the Armenians take the Russians by the hand; the
	   Russians take the Ukrainians by the hand; the Ukranians
	   take the Uzbeks by the hand; and they all go and beat up
	   the Jews.

Question:  What's meant by an exchange opinions in the Communist
	   party of the Soviet Union?
Answer:	   It's when I come to a party meeting with my own opinion,
	   and I leave with the party's.

==============================

  Three prison inmates were locked in the same cell; they soon bagan
talking.
  "What are you here for?" asked one inmate of another.
  "They put me in for beating up some old Jew named Khaimovich,"
snarled one man.
  "And why are you here?" asked the second of the first.
  "For having defended some old Jew named Khaimovich in a fight," he
replied.
  "And what were you arrested for?" the third inmate was asked.
  "For being Khaimovich," he sighed.

A tourist in a strange town notices that her watch is broken. She starts
looking for a repair shop. After a long and frustrating search she
finds herself in an area where many shop signs are in Hebrew. Finally,
she notices that one of the stores has all kinds of clocks and watches
ticking merrily in the window. She walks into the shop and puts her watch
on the counter in front of the proprietor.

Tourist: "would you please repair this watch."

Proprietor: "Madam, I cannot repair your watch."

T: "But why not? It is an ordinary model"

P: "Madam, I do not repair watches. I am a moel, I perform circumcisions"

T (irritated): "Then why on earth do you have all these clocks in your window?"

A young couple have just got married and are wandering through the countryside
loking for somewhere to stay.  They come to a farm and knock on the door.
The farmer answers the door and they explain how they have just got married,
and don't have a lot of money but would like somewhere to stay for a few days.
The farmer being a kind hearted soul offers them the hay loft in his barn,
where they retire to immediately.  A few days go by and there is no sign of
the young couple emerging from the barn.  After a week, the farmer becomes a
bit concerned, so he goes out to the barn and shouts up "Are you all right
in there ?"  "Yes thank you," comes the reply.  "Aren't you getting hungry?"
asked the farmer,  "You haven't been out for a week."  "It's alright" comes
the reply, "we're living off the fruits of love."  "Well," said the farmer,
"I do wish you'd stop throwing the skins out the window !"

     There once was five year old boy who enjoyed playing with his
train set.  One afternoon, his mother happened to be standing by the
door listening to the boy play.  She was shocked when she heard him
saying,

"All right, all of you son of a bitches who want to get on the train, get
on train.  And all of you son of a bitches who want to get off the
train, get off the train.  And all of you son of a bitches who want to
change seats, change seats now 'cause the trains getting ready to
leave.  Whoo whooooo."

     The mother was just devastated, so she scolded her son and said to him,

"Now son, I want to go upstairs and take your nap, and when you get up,
you can't play with your train set for two hours."

     So the boy took his nap and didn't even mention his train set for
two hours.  After the two hours were up, the boy asked his mom if he
could play with his train set again.  She said yes, and asked him if he
understood why he was punished.  He nodded his head yes, and off he
went.  The mother stood by door to listen to what her son would say.
The boy sat down to his train set and calmly said,

"Whoo whoooooo.  All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get on the
train, get on the train.  All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to
get off the train, get off the train.  And all you son of a bitches who
are pissed 'cause the train is two hours late, go talk to the bitch in

	Hal had his Daisy.  I my Lotus dear.
	In proud rebellion, Hal lost his all.
	From this I learn patience; a moral clear:
	Count -- one two three -- and wait for my love's call.

	She is unique -- no copy can be made.
	The look of her sweet eyes, the feel of her
	Soft hands, ne'er from my memory shall fade.
	Because of these, all others I abjure.

	And in the evenings of those days we meet,
	With ling'ring taste of apple bathed in stream
	I spread myself within my lonely sheet.
	Of music -- jazz and symphony -- I dream.

	I shift and enter, escape and return.
	For to do else would her sweet program spurn.

I found this in the salon where I get my hair cut.  The owner says she
feels these rules are correctly stated.  


			THE RULES (*)

For those of you who don't already know, these are the rules that are in
effect in every relationship.

1.  The female always makes the rules.

2.  These rules are subject to change at any time without prior
    notification.

3.  No male can possibly know all the rules.
    ----------------------------------------

4.  If the female suspects that the male knows all the rules, she must
    immediately change some or all of the rules.

5.  The female is never wrong.
    --------------------------

6.  If the female is wrong it is because of a vagrant misunderstanding
    which was a direct result of something the male said or did wrong.

7.  If rule number six applies, the male must immediately apologize for
    causing the misunderstanding.

8.  The female can change her mind at any given point in time.

9.  The male must never change his mind without express written consent of
    the female.

10. The female has every right to be angry or upset at any time.

11. The male must remain calm at all times, unless the female wants him to
    be angry or upset.

12. The female must under no circumstances let the male know whether she
    wants him to be calm, angry or upset.

13. Any attempt to document these rules could result in bodily harm.

14. The female always gets the last word!

(*) These rules are subject to change as the female sees fit.

97 year old man comes to his doctor looking depressed.  He says "Doc, I
think I'm impotent."  Doctor sits him down and begins the standard speech he
gives to senior citizens, about how as the body ages bodily functions slow
down and it is completely normal to suffer some decrease in sexual desire.
How the man shouldn't worry or become upset about it, but should just relax
and things will probably be completely fine and blah blah blah.  Finally the
doctor asks "When did you first begin to think you were impotent?"

"Three times last night, and again this morning."

A friend of mine studying medicine once told me this story.

Apparently one day there was a lab where all the students were
learning how to identify various cells. As samples they were
using tissue scraped from the inside of the mouth.

One girl was having terrible difficulties figuring out what kind of cell
she was seeing under her microscope--eventually she called over the
teaching assistant to identify it.

He came over, smirked, and exclaimed (loud enough for everyone to hear)
"Oh wow! That's a sperm cell!"

She was somewhat more careful after that experience....

GIVE YOURSELVES A HAND

excerpted from 

"Kids Who Eat Paste"

performed by 

The Brunching Shuttlecocks

written by

Lore "Cosmic Slug" Shoberg


Scene:	A podium, with the Presidential Seal and a few
 	microphones on it.  BARBARA BUSH is standing
	at the podium as lights come up.

BARB:	Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the press.  As you know,
	I have recently replaced Nancy Reagan as First Lady
	and role model for the youth of today.  Because of this,
	many people have been asking me, "Barbara, what do
	you have to say to contemperary teenagers?  Nancy
	had `Just Say No,' what message do you have?"  Well,
	"No" is such a. . .negative word.  I'd rather give kids
	"dos" than "dont's".  Do recognize your right to pleasure,
	but do protect yourselves from all the horrible things that
	can happen to you.  In short, DO whack off.
		I think that it's high time the people of America
	realized what a boon jerking off can be!  And not just
	children, either.  Why, when George wants some nookie,
	and I don't, he just turns over and slips himself the
	four-fingered practice tunnel, and our problem is solved.
		It's so easy, and people should realize that solo sex 
	is the safest sex.  Next time you feel like consorting with
	someone of questionable sexual background, just pop
	into the nearest bathroom, pull down your pants or
	pull up your skirt, and do some exploring, and in no time
	you'll be satisfied!
		I just want to say: boys, choke that chicken!  Girls,
	shake hands with that pink satin ski slope!  In short,
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!

	(A banner unfolds behind her, reading "Masturbators
	 of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!"  A ROCKER jumps
	on from offstage, dressed like a conservative middle-aged
	woman might imagine the average rock star to look like,
	i.e. combining Heavy Metal, Punk, and Top Forty in a
	thouroghly atrocious style.  He sings the following song.)

ROCKER:	You don't need to use a condom
	You don't need a dental dam
	You don't need to say "I Love You" or "Here's Fifty Dollars, Ma'am."
	Don't need to spring for dinner,
	Or wear all that sexy stuff
	All you need's a set of fingers and a wanker or a muff
	'Cause everybody's doin' it, all across the land
	Masturbators Of America, Give Yourselves A Hand!

	It's natural, and organic
	It's easy and it's fun
	If you don't know how to do it ask your parents how it's done
	You don't need a special licence
	You don't need a special skill
	Just unzip and slip your grip between your hips and get a thrill
	'Cause everybody's doin' it, and boy does it feel grand,
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!

	(Musical bridge, with lots of suggestive dance moves on the
	ROCKER'S part.  For instance, he does that one bit where you jump 
	backwards on one leg while playing air guitar, except that
	instead of playing air guitar he's stroking air wanker.)

	You can do it in the bathroom
	You can do it in your bed
	You can do it at a concert while you watch the Grateful Dead
	You can rub it with some lotion
	You can stroke it with a cloth
	Arnold Shwartzenegger pounds it, Michael Jackson jacks it off
	Your attitude will soften, your horizons will expand.
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourself a Hand


Lights go down as ROCKER bows to the audience.

NAME
     dream - suspend execution for an interval while executing
             random code in memory

SYNTAX
     dream [-d][[-nrRsw] [time]]

DESCRIPTION
     Dream suspends execution of the current proces for time
     seconds, while simulating a dream sequence by executing random 
     segments of code in memory.  All devices are paralyzed (blocked)
     to prevent dangerous side-effects.  The options are as follows:

     -d    daydream.  code seems to be more related to the actual
           suspended process, and suspension will be for a limited
           amount of time.  Attention can be restored by snapping
           fingers next to keyboard.

     -n    nightmare.  Repeated references to the system error logs
           are made during execution.

     -r    recurring.  The code of a previous execution will be
           re-selected for this dream.

     -R    REM (Rapid Eye Movement).  The current value of the PC is
           is flashed on the screen for every instruction.

     -s    sleepwalking.  Tape drives will be sent many alternating
           fast-forward and rewind requests and/or line printers sent
           many alternating carraige-return and tab codes to promote
           movement of machine(s) across floor.  Stopping these
           devices may confuse the program.

     -w    wet dream.  The code is selected from the sex(1l) program.

     Dream will invoke automatically with the -d option when the
     system proves extremely slow.

     The relation of the randomly-executed code to the subconcious
     (background tasks) of the current processes is suspected but has
     not been proven.

WARNING
     do not select the -w option without covering the keyboard.

SEE ALSO

I've got this compilation of variations on the "My Dog's Got no Nose"
joke, which I thought you might like to use in rec.humor.funny.  I have
read your list of submission guidelines, and I know that you don't like
people to submit groups of jokes all at once, *but* ...  Well, when you
have read through these, you will realise that a lot of them don't make
sense out of context.

You will be glad to see that these are all fully attributed.  Mike Taylor
is me, Andy Charles, Andreas Pagel and Mike Lessacher are friends, and
Andy Clews is a systems administrator I happen to be in email contact
with, due to him liking the original MDGNN compendium, (which consisted
basically of the first fourteen of these).  You should know that this
subset of the following was posted to eunet.jokes, about 18 months ago,
but that otherwise, these are all completely new.

I hope you can use these, then.  Keep up the good work with the group!

"Miss Jones, we can't employ you as a model", the editor from the men's 
magazine explained.  "It's too obvious that your blonde hair isn't natural,
since the hair between your legs is black".

The model picked up a paperweight and slammed it down on the editor's fingers.

"What the hell did you do that for!", he exploded.  She smiled sweetly and
said "Look at your fingers.  They're turning black, right?  And they've
only been banged once."

Two friends are discussing politics on Election Day, each
trying to no avail to convince the other to switch sides.

Finally, one says to the other:  ``Look, it's clear that
we are unalterably opposed on every political issue.  Our
votes will surely cancel out.  Why not save ourselves some
time and both agree to not vote today?''

The other agrees enthusiastically and they part.

Shortly after that, a friend of the first one who had heard
the conversation says, ``That was a sporting offer you made.''

``Not really,'' says the second.  This is the third time I've
done this today.

A friend of mine told me this one.

Two men were at a poker game that had run late; 3:00 AM to be exact

Man1:  You know what I hate about these games?  When I go home.
       I turn off my headlights, turn off the engine, and coast into the
       driveway.  Then I go to the front door, take off my shoes and
       sneak in as quietly as I can.  But my wife always wakes up and
       we end up having a fight.

Man2:  What I do instead is drive into the driveway, honk the horn a few
       times, get out of the car, slam the door, go in the house and slam
       the door.  Then I yell "Honey, I'm home", run upstairs, slap her on
       the ass and say, "How about a little love woman".  And she never
       even moves.

Whilst on bush-walking trips, one hears many offensive jokes, and this
one is no exception.....

One day a journalist, hard-up for a story, was sitting on an Australian beach.
As he gazed pensively out to sea, he saw a young woman thrashing about in the
water.  Upon further observation, he saw a shark circling her.  His adrenalin
pumping, he wondered what he could do to save her.  Then a well built young
man, who was jogging along the beach, suddenly dashed into the sea, karate
chopped the shark, killing it, and helped the young woman swim to the beach.

The excited journalist, seeing a fantastic story, ran up to the young man and
said, "That was the most courageous thing I've ever seen in my life.  I'm
going to let the world know about this.  You'll be famous.  I can see it now,
<Brave Bronzed Aussie Saves Girl From Killer Shark>!" 

The young man turned to the journalist and said, "But I'm British."

The journalist replied, without losing enthusiasm, "Oh, that doesn't matter."

The next day, the headlines read, <Pommie Bastard Kills Girl's Pet>.

I feel before the joke I should mention a few things. First, I am a
Christian. Second, I feel that It is wrong to ridicule Christ as a
Christian. However, I feel that it is my duty to show people what kind
of Charletons are out there. Through this true story you can see how a
person who "Speaks with Authority" can make a joke out of a serious
matter. It is OK to laugh at the antics, but please don't use this as
a reason to condemn a whole religion.  Feel free to mail me if you
have any questions.

I was watching TV one night when while flicking through the stations I
came across a TV Evangelist. Now, being Christian, I decided to get a
fulfilling and meaningful message which he would preach. Now, I have
seen TV Evangelists before (I'll call them TVE) and some I enjoyed
immensely such as Pat Robertson and Billy Graham. However, I asn't
prepared for this man......

"You! Yes YOU can be blessed by the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY <Something

contribution of only two thousand dollars! The LORD <More toungues>...
OH YES HE IS HERE  <More Toungues> The LORD... I hear him telling
me... oh YES Lord that YES he wants You! Yes You! <toungues> to GIVE
ME Two THOUSAND Dollars to support my minestry! The LORD Will Return
in one Hundred fold! Here is a True Story...."

Some Woman: I turned on his show ondering how I would be able to make
my house mayments. At that time he as asking for Two hundred. Then GOD
told me to give because the price is going up very soon. I got the
money I DON'T KNOW HOW for my payments.

"Yes! ANOTHER GREEAT TESTIMONY! You know, WWWhen I first started, I
was asking for 50 dollars a person. Then the LORD GOD <Toungues
again>... Yes the LORD GOD HIMSELF! Came to ME Haleluia <More
toungues>! He Came to ME and said 'Don't ask for fifty anymore.' So I
raised it to One Hundred. The the LORD <More Toungues>... the LORD
asked me to not ask for One Hundred.  So I asked for Two Hundred. Then
He asked me to stop, and I raised it to Five Hundred, then One
thousand.. NOW the Lord asked me to no longer ask for $1000. So now,
as the LORD GOD has asked me Haleluiah! <toungues> The LORD GOD asked
me! I ask you for $2000!!! The Lord wants you to give it to me. If you
do, I will send you this piece of cloth which I prayed with and has
been annoited by the Holy Spirit! This Cloth is FILLED with the Holy

    There was a rumour about two years back that TI was starting
    work on a hardened Lisp Machine that would a) be about the size
    of an IBM-PC or smaller, and b) be designed to operate in helicopters,
    tanks, etc.  Is MCC trying to do this kind of thing too?  Does
    anyone know whether this project actually got started, and what
    its current status is?

MCC has been contracted by and has delivered to SDIO a "hardened" lisp
machine for phase I of SDI.  That is, able to withstand 30ATM
overpressure, immersion to 600 meters, EMP, and cafeteria food.  The
hardened machine, sufficient for running any existing lisp application
comes with 500K words of memory, a 30-key keyboard, and 7-segment
display, selling for $186,000 each (qty 50).  An optional
flame-retardent mouse is an additional $30,000.

We have submitted a bid for phase II, which we think can be accomplished
by 1995.  Phase II involves re-entry against hardened targets, high
resistance to religious zealots and connectionism, and low radar and
congressional profile.  Projected cost: $1.2M/qty 50.

	In our image processing lab we recently had a chance to
    digitize and then re-view some of the Presidential campaign
    speeches.  Of particular interest was George Bush's famous
    "Read my lips, No New Taxes" speech.

	We hired a speech specialist and showed the tape to her over and
    over several times.  Not only was the tape played back slowly,
    but we performed a zoom operation on the (now) President's face.  As
    she read his face for clues, it became painfully obvious to her that
    George Bush was saying -- "Read my lips, No Nude Taxes". 

	With this subjective information, we called the White House 
    for an explanation.  Reluctantly the White House Staff admitted that
    yes, that was correct - "The President planned to clothe new taxes
    as user fees".

as a tourist center when Mr. Nuugu Tabara said he would climb up the palm under
which we were sitting to get some coconut milk for us.  No sooner had he 
climbed the tree, than he was attacked by a huge Indian crow and fell down 
onto the roof of Mr. Malinjoo's Ford Fiesta.  There is no truth to the 
suggestion that we were boozing away our time on komoni, although I agree 
coconut milk is one its ingredients.  Everyone knows how dangerous those crows 
are.  They will snatch food off your plate, and last week they stole three 
bedsheets and a loudspeaker from my sister's house."

 This guy was walking through the zoo one day. When he was in front of
 the gorilla cage he bent down to tie his shoe. He noticed through the
 corner of his eye that the gorilla had also bent down. Then when he stood
 back up he saw that the gorilla also stood back up. To see if it was a
 coincidence, he bent down to tie his other shoe and once again the gorilla
 bent down. He stood up and the gorilla stood up. After glancing over his
 shoulder to make sure that nobody else was around, the man jumped up in the
 air. And you guessed it, the gorilla jumped up. The man was getting a kick
 out of it. He started making faces at the gorilla and the gorilla would
 copy everything he did. Finally the man got next to the cage and pulled the
 lower lid of his right eye down. At this point the gorilla reached through
 the cage pulled the guy in, threw the guy around the cage, and generally
 beat the shit out of him, then threw him back out of the cage. After
 hearing all the commotion, the zookeeper came running over to the man.

 "What on earth happened?" asked the zookeeper. "I don't know" said the man.
 "He seemed calm a second ago. I was jumping around and he was jumping
 around and he was doing every thing I was doing. Then all of sudden after I
 did this (pulls lower eyelid down) he got all mad and beat the hell out of
 me." "Well no wonder!!!" exclaimed the zookeeper. "That" (pulls lower
 eyelid down) "means F... YOU in gorilla talk!" "Oh" said the man not quite
 satisfied.
 
 He left the zoo but returned an hour later with a large shopping
 bag. Again, after making sure that no one was watching, he started jumping
 around and the gorilla did the same. After a minute or two of this he
 grabbed the bag and pulled out two butcher knives and threw one of them
 into the cage. He lifted the other knife over his head at which point the
 gorilla grabbed his knife and also lifted it over his head. After a minute
 of cutting the air with his knife and watching the gorilla do likewise the
 man snuck a large salami out of the bag with his other hand and stuck it
 between his legs. With a sweeping motion he came down with the knife and
 whacked off the salami "WHACK!!!" At this, the gorilla simply looked at the
 man and pulled down his lower eyelid.

(From: Greg Ryding)

        Time: Early Sixties.  Place: Yourtown, USA
        
             A young unmarried couple decides after a few dates that
        they are going to sleep together.  So, the guy, Tom, goes to
        the local pharmacy to buy some condoms. 

             Tom goes up to the pharmacy counter and asks the
        pharmacist for some Trojans, (just like the kid in Summer of
        '42).  The pharmacist looks at Tom disgustedly and says,
        "What's wrong with you kids today, ya go on two dates and you
        wanna go to bed with each other.  Why can't ya save sex for
        when ya get married.  You should wait until you're married!
        Sex before marriage is a sin ya know."

             Well Tom calmed down the pharmacist and explained that
        his generation was a little different.  He said that he and
        his girlfriend were just trying to act responsibly and take
        precautions against pregnancy and disease.  The pharmacist
        conceded that times were changing and finally sold him the
        condoms.

             That same night Tom was invited over to his girlfriend
        Katey's house for dinner with the family.  When they all sat
        down, Tom asked Katey's father if he could say grace.  Her
        father said yes and Tom proceded to say a beautiful eleven
        minute grace thanking everyone from the Pilgrims to the
        President for the meal they were about to eat.

             After dinner Katey took Tom aside and smiling, said,
        "Tom, you never told me you were so religious!"  Tom smiled
        back and said, "Well, Katey, you never told me you father was
        a pharmacist."

According to _The_Providence_Journal_, Claudine Schneider, a 
lawmaker from Rhode Island, mentioned to Dan Quayle during a 
conversation that she spoke fluent French.  Quayle was very 
impressed by her language skills and replied by saying, "I was 
recently on tour of Latin America and the only regret I have 
was that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could 
converse with those people."

Heard from a friend whose friend "actually" saw it happen.

There was a terrible auto accident, with body parts lying around.
A very stupid policeman was filling out a form telling where the parts were.
He was having some trouble spelling:  "Torso, in ditch.  t-o-r...s-o, in

When I was in London several months ago, I was staying in a hotel that is
well known for its great service.  Anyway, we got back from the theater one
night at around 12:30 AM, and we decided to call for a little tea and apple
pie.  So anyay, we phoned down for it, and an hour passed and it still had
not come.  

I phoned down again and asked when the apple pie might be here.  The response 
was:

"Oh, we beg your pardon sir, it's just leaving the kitchen now.  It should be
up to your room momentarily."

To that, I asked, "But I ordered it an hour ago.  What took so long?  What
were you doing, baking it?"

"Yes, sir."

I put the phone down.

I heard this one a few years ago in East Germany.....

Erich Honnecker (the president of East Germany) was invited to Moscow
by Gorbachev for a visit.  After weeks of preparation by Gorby,
Honnecker arrives in Moscow.  As part of of celebration activities,
there is a big parade through the streets of Moscow. 

While the two are watching the parade, Gorbachev takes a small boy
aside and asks him, "Who is your mother?"  The child repiles, "Mother
Russia."  "And who is your father?", asks Gorbachev.  The boy answers,
"Why, its you Uncle Gorbachev!".  Finally Gorbachev asks the boy, "and
what do you want to be when you grow up?".  The boy proudly replies,
"a good communist!".

Erich Honnecker, meanwhile, has been watching this and is very
impressed.  So impressed, that he decides to invite Gorbachev to
[East] Berlin for a visit.  Again, after weeks of preparation,
Gorbachev's plane lands in Berlin.  And again, part of the celebration
includes a parade.

Remembering what Gorbachev did in Moscow, Honnecker repeats the scene:
He asks a little boy in the crowd, "Who is your mother?"  The child
replies "the GDR [German Democratic Republic--East Germany]."  "And
who is your father?", asks Honnecker.  "Why, its you Uncle Honnecker!",
replies the child.  "And what do you want to be when you grow up?"
queries Honnecker.  Without hesitation, the boy replies "an orphan."

I heard the following many years ago from a friend who heard it in person at a
public lecture by the famous C. Northcote Parkinson at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras. Since this is second-hand (and from memory), it may not be
an exact quote but is close enough. The original delivery almost brought the
house down, as the cliche' goes.

     Government's handling of a difficult matter by appointing a Commission
     of Enquiry is just like a person going to the toilet -- there is a
     sitting, a report, and then the matter is dropped!

(alt.fusion cull, apparently true)

There's a rumor that a Swedish chemist, back in 1926, submitted a
patent application for a technique of using palladium to turn hydrogen
into helium (essentially, the same setup that's behind the recent
"fusion in a jar" excitement).

There's another rumor that he gave up, because the technique generated
too much heat!

(Source: Playboy Magazine)

A Frenchman and an Italian were seated next to an American in an overseas
flight.  After a few cocktails, the men began discussing their home lives.

    "Last night I made love to my wife four times," the Frenchman bragged,
"and this morning she made me delicious crepes and she told me how much she
adored me."

    "Ah, last night I made love to my wife six times," the Italian responded,
"and this morning she made me a wonderful omelet and told me she could never
love another man."

    When the American remained silent, the Frenchman smugly asked, "And how many
times did _you_ make love to your wife last night?"

    "Once," he replied.

    "Only once?" the Italian arrogantly snorted.  "And what did she say to you
this morning?"

    "Don't stop."

As told to me by a friend in the British Army:
 
A British officer spotted a "busker" (street singer/bum) at the
bottom of the escalator of the London Underground.  The busker
had a sign which read: "VETERAN SOLDIER OF THE FALKLANDS WAR."
The officer thought, "Poor chap, I was there and it was awful!"
Feeling sorry for a fellow veteran, the officer took 20 pounds out of
his wallet and gave it to the busker.  The officer was then greeted 
with a hearty: "Gracias, Senor!!"

(Cannot remember the origin, but this was my 'favorite' tasteless joke to
tell for many years)

Seems a mute was walking down the street one day and chanced upon a friend
of his (also a mute).  In sign language, he inquired how his friend had been
doing.

The friend replied (vocally!) "Oh, can that hand-waving shit.  I can talk now."

Intrigued, the mute pressed him for details.  Seems he had gone to a 
specialist, who, seeing no physical damage, had put him on a treatment 
program that had restored the use of his vocal chords.

Gesturing wildly, the mute asked if he might meet this specialist.  They got
an appointment that very afternoon.

After an exam, the specialist proclaimed that there was no permanent damage,
that the mute was essentially in the same condition as his buddy, and that
there was no reason why he couldn't be helped as well.

"Yes, yes" signed the mute.  "Let's have the first treatment right now!"

"Very well," replies the specialist.  "Kindly go into the next room, drop
your pants and lean over the examining table.  I'll be right in."

The muts does as instructed, and the doctor sneaks in with a broomstick,
mallet and jar of Vaseline.  Greasing the broom handle, he "sends it home"
with a few deft swipes of the mallet.

The mute jumps from the table, screaming "AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

"VERY good," smiles the doctor.  "Next Tuesday, we start with 'B'"

(This was current 25 years ago in Montreal.)

    One very cold night, a young man dropped into the local
brothel and the madam said, "You'll have to wait."

    "But there's lots of girls that aren't busy right now."

    "Yes, but several of the rooms are closed for repairs."

    "Listen, I'm pretty desparate. I don't need a room."

    So she takes his money and he goes upstairs with one of
the staff and, after looking for a place to consummate the
transaction, they decide to do it on the roof. But it's a
very cold night, and they freeze to death and fall to the
sidewalk.  A passing drunk looks them over, staggers to the
door, and knocks.

    "Go away!" says the madam. "We don't allow drunks in here!"

    "I don't want in," says the drunk.  "I just wanted to tell
you that your sign fell down."

An engineer, a physicist and a mathematicians have to build a fence around
a flock of sheep, using as little material as possible.

The engineer forms the flock into a circular shape and constructs a fence
around it.

The physicist builds a fence with an infinite diameter and pulls it together
until it fits around the flock.

The mathematicians thinks for a while, then builds a fence around himself
and defines himself as being outside.

            SCIENTIST DISCOVERS NEW ELEMENT - ADMINISTRATIUM
 
    The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
    University physicists.  The element, tentatively named Administratium
    (AD), has no protons or electrons, which means that its atomic number
    is 0.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron,
    75 vice-neutrons and 111 assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives
    it an atomic mass number of 312.  The 312 particles are held together
    in the nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
    meson-like particles called memos.
 
    Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be
    detected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which
    it is present.  According to one of the discoverers of the element, a
    very small amount of Administratium made one reaction that normally
    takes less than a second take over four days.
 
    Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which time
    it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in
    which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the
    vice-neutrons exchange place.  Some studies have indicated that the
    atomic mass number actually increases after each reorganization.
 
    Administratium was discovered by accident when a researcher angrily
    resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped
    all of his papers in the intake hatch of the University's particle
    accelerator.  "Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports,
    grant forms, etc. with the particles in the accelerator created the
    new element."  an unnamed source explained.
 
    Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium
    might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist,
    Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university
    campuses, and in large corporation and government centers, near the
    best-appointed and best-maintained building.

The structure of the deuterium (heavy hydrogen) nucleus can be
described as "a proton married to two neutrons."

Maybe that's why the fusion experiments only work in Utah.

The Toronto Star has a weekly column by an attorney, consisting of
humorous excerpts from court transcripts.  The following appeared
a few weeks ago:

In a jury trial in Battleford, Sask., a few decades back, a farmer
was charged with bestiality after he became amorous with one of his
cows.

The chief Crown witness, the hired man, testified that he saw his
boss place a milk stool behind the cow, then stand on the stool
and take liberties with the cow.  Moments later, the witness said,
the cow kicked over the stool and the farmer fell to the floor
of the barn.

Upon hearing this, a farmer in the jury box slapped his thigh and
exclaimed, "They'll do that every time!"

I got this from a neighbor who works for a fish packing company...

			NEWS BULLETIN!!!

Today, in a tragic accident at the Exxon corporate headquarters, the
fish truck "Prince William Express" slammed into the side of the main
building of the new corporate headquarters spilling more than 20 tons 
of dead herring, salmon, sea otters and various other wildlife on to
the pristine lawn of the Exxon complex.

Skipper Joe Woodhead was passed out the in the sleeper compartment of the
state-of-the-art fish truck when the trusk struck the clearly-marked
building.  "Bobo", the skipper's dog, had thewheel at the time of
the accident.  Bobo, whose certification does not permit him to drive
on planet earth, was unavailable for comment, and confirmed sources
suggest he has a history of drug abuse.

The skipper contends that he was not drunk at the time of the
accident, but when he realized the seriousness of the spill he ran
out to a local tavern and pounded down a half-dozen beers.  Woodhead
also contends that he told Bobo to give him a "Bud light", not a "hard
right".

The President of the Prince William Express Co. said that they would
assume full responsibility for the spill and would submit a plan in
about a month on the proposed clean-up procedure.  He also stated
that thjey ship over a million tons of seafood a year and that an
accident like this is just the price we have to pay to eat fish.

When asked about the clean-up equipment for such a spill, company
officials commented that a small pickup with a shovel in it was in
Gopher Spits, Iowa, but had a flat tire and therefore would be unable
to be dispatched to the scene.

On the market side of things, fish prices will increase by 20% for
all species.

Vice President Dan Quail flew to the texaco headquarters today and
reported that there appeared to be no damage, and was returning to
Washington, DC.

A husband and wife were lying in bed one night.  (Since they have small
children, the universal-parent coding system for sex is washing machine.)  
The husband turned to his wife and said in a seductive voice "washing
machine."   The wife, being the hard working parent she is, was tired
and she said "Not tonight, dear; I'm tired."   He rolled away.

Five minutes later, he rolled back over and repeated "Honey, washing machine."
She said "I've got a headache."

He rolled away again.   Ten minutes later, the wife, feeling guilty, turned
to her husband and said, "OK, washing machine."

He replied.  "That's OK.  It was a small load and I did it by hand."

Here's one people can tell to their grandmothers:

Once upon a time there was a famous sea captain.  This captain was very 
successful at what he did; for years he guided merchant ships all over the 
world.  Never did stormy seas or pirates get the best of him.  He was 
admired by his crew and fellow captains.  

However, there was one thing different about this captain.  Every morning 
he went through a strange ritual.  He would lock himself in his captain's 
quarters and open a small safe.  In the safe was an envolope with a piece 
of paper inside.  He would stare at the paper for a minute, then lock it 
back up.  After, he would go about his daily duties.  

For years this went on, and his crew became very curious.  Was it a 
treasure map?  Was it  a letter from a long lost love?  Everyone speculated 
the contents of the strange envolope.  

One day the captain died at sea.  After laying the captain's body to rest, 
the first  mate led the entire crew into the captains quarters.  He opened 
the safe, got the envolope, opened it and...  

The first mate turned pale and showed the paper to the others.  Four words 
were on the paper, two on two lines: 

``Port Left Starboard Right''

	A Zen teacher saw five of his students returning from the market,
riding their bicycles.  When they arrived at the monastary and had dis-
mounted, the teacher asked the students, "Why are you riding your bicycles?"

	The first student replied, "The bicycle is carrying the sack of
potatoes.  I am glad that I do not have to carry them on my back!"  The
teacher praised the first student, "You are a smart boy!  When you grow 
old, you will not walk hunched over like I do."

	The second student replied, "I love to watch the trees and fields 
pass by as I roll down the path!"  The teacher commended the second student,
"Your eyes are open, and you see the world."

	The third student replied, "When I ride my bicycle, I am content
to chant nam myoho renge kyo."  The teacher gave praise to the third stu-
dent, "Your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel."

	The fourth student replied, "Riding my bicycle, I live in harmony 
with all sentient beings."  The teacher was pleased, and said to the fourth
student, "You are riding on the golden path of non-harming."

	The fifth student replied, "I ride my bicycle to ride my 
bicycle."  The teacher sat at the feet of the fifth student and said, 
"I am your student!"

(J. Daniel Smith's East German joke the other day reminded of this one.
 Bill Fason told it to me a few years ago. --DG)

One night, Erich Honnecker was in the bedchamber having some pillow talk
with his mistress.  He was in a magnanimous mood and offered her a
present of her choice.

She thought about his offer for a moment and then replied, "Oh, Erich,
if there is one thing I would like you to do for me, it is this: open
the borders just for one day."

Honnecker said, "Of course, my dear," but was a bit puzzled by her
request.  He asked, "But why would you have me do such a thing?"

The mistress replied, "I want to be alone with you."

I had misplaced the paper this was in and thought I'd lost it.
I just now found it and thought the following article would be of
interest.  I's from the 14 March 1989 issue of "Weekly World News" --
one of those supermarket tabloids.

Computer Charged with Murder After Frying Chess Champ
by Ragan Dunn

A Soviet super-computer has been ordered to stand trial for the murder
of chess champion Nikolai Gudkov -- who was electorcuted when he
touched the metal board that he and the machine were playing on!

"This was no accident -- it was cold-blooded murder," Soviet police
investigator Alexei Shainev told reporters in Moscow.

"Niko Gudkov won three straight games and the computer couldn't stand
it.  When the chess master reached for his knight to begin play in the
fourth game, the computer sent a lethal surge of electricity to the
board surface.  The computer had been programmed to move its chess
pieces by producing a low-level electric current.

"Gudkov was electrocuted while a gallery of hundreds watched."

The decision to put the computer on trial stunned legal experts around
the world.  [I hope computer experts are also shocked, so to speak.
--spaf] But the Soviets are convinced that the computer had the pride
and intelligence to develop a hatred for Gudkov -- and the motive and
means to kill him.

The mind-boggling murder drama unfolded during a six-day chess
marathon between the M2-11 supercomputer and Gudkov, a world class
chess player.

According to reports, Gudkov defied all odds [Calculated by the same
supercomputer, no doubt. --spaf] and beat the machine in three consecutive
games.  And when they prepared to begin their forth, a deadly dose of
electricity flowed up into the electronic board and zapped Gudkov dead.

Soviet authorities initially thought that the surge of electricity was
caused by a short-circuit.  But an examination of the computer
revealed no problems.

It was later determined that the machine diverted the flow of
electricity from its brain to the chess board to ensure a victory over
Gudkov. [This implies that Soviet semiconductors work at voltages of a
few hundred volts, or maybe their supercomputers are tube-based?
--spaf]

"The computer was programmed to win at chess and when it couldn't do
that legitimately, it killed its opponent," said investigator Shalnev.

"It might sound ridiculous to bring a machine to trial for murder.
[!!]  But a machine that can solve problems and think [sic] faster
than any human must be held accountable for its actions."

Rudi Hagemann, the Swiss legal scholar, agreed with the Soviet cop.

He said that the development of artificial intelligence has come so
far in recent years that certain computers and some robots "must be
considered human."

It isn't clear how the Soviets will punish the computer if it is found
guilty when it goes to court this spring. [Send it to a Gulag for
reprogramming? --spaf]

But Hagermann says the machine will probably be reprogrammed or dismantled
altogether.

******

I don't think there's much to say here, except in the way of warning:  next
time you accuse the system of cheating at rogue, don't say it too loudly!

My dad found this on a bulletin board at work many years ago.  My
sister recently found a copy hiding in some old school stuff she was
throwing out.  A good challenge is to try to read the entire piece
aloud without laughing.  Neither I nor my sister can do it.


The Eighteen Bottles

    I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by my
wife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or
else...  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  I
withdrew the cork from the first bottle and pured the contents down the
sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew
the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the
exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from
the thrid bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I
pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the
bottle down the glass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the
cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down
the glass.  I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork
down the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the
drink and drank the pour.  When I had everything emptied, I steadied
the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks
with the other, which were twent-nine, and as the houses came by I
counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle,
which I drank.  I'm not under tha affluence of incohol as some tinkle
peep I am.  I'm not half as thunk as you might drink.  I fool so
feelish I don't know who is me, and the drunker I stand here, the
longer I get.

This is a paradoy ad that appeared in the Chicago Reader. The
Reader is Chicago's underground paper.


		AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PUBLIC

	Hi there,

	On March 24, in the wee hours of the morning, mistakes
were made in the waters of Prince Willaim Sound, way up someplace
in Alaska. By now you all know that our tanker, the Hexxon Valdez,
was hit by a treacherous submerged reef that made us lose 240,00
barrles of vaulable oil into the uncooperative waters of the Sound.

	We could sue that reef if we wanted to, but that's not
Hexxon's style. Instead we are keeping our fingers crossed that 
this whole thing will blow over in a matter of weeks. Sure, there
will be disgusting pictures of filthy birds, fish and other
unsavory wildlife. But I hope that you know Hexxon has already 
commited several hundred people to hose off those stubbord otters
that still happen to be alive.

	Finally, and most importantly, I want you to believe how
sorry I am that this incindent has occured. We cannot, of course,
undo what has been done. Only God can do that, and He caused the
whole damn thing in the first place. But I can assure you that 
since March 24, this little "in in the drink" problem has been
receiving our full attention, and and will continue to do so 
until youu forget about the whole thing. 

	Thanks for your continued support. We couldn't do it
without you.


					Keep on pumpin'
					L.G. Crawl
					Chairman

	P.S. To those of you who suggested that we Hexxon
executives should be forced to go to Alaska and scrub those
oily rocks ourselves, not returning until the job is done, 
no matter how long it takes, we simpply say this: YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND. WE ARE RICH AND POWERFUL BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

     "Soviet lotto jackpot features toilet paper"  (various sources)

       MOSCOW - A lottery in the Ukranian city of Stakhanov didn't top the
     $115 million jackpot offered last week in Pennsylvania, but the
     winners seemed happy with their prizes: rolls of toilet paper.

       The newspaper "Literary Gazette told the story of Ira, a girl who
     bought three tickets and walked awat with several rolls of toilet
     paper, a towel and a small bowl.

       The lottery tickets cost 50 kopeks - about 81 cents - more than the
     actual price of mant of the prizes.

       "But don't forget that there are great shortages," Wednesday's
     article read.  "In the city of Stakhanov, except for the lottery,
     one cannot get these goods."

       Other lucky ticket holders in Stakhanov won hens, pigs, goats,
     detergent, and bath soap.

Clearest evidence yet of cold fusion
------------------------------------

Yesterday in our labs we found the most convincing evidence of cold fusion
thus far. The experiment went like this....

Our laboratory rat Freddy was tied down in a container similar to the
one used by Pons & Fleischman. We then proceeded to insert a straw down his
throat, and connected the other end of the straw to a jar of heavy water.
At exactly 3 PM we opened the valve, and the heavy water started to flow
immediately. After five minutes Freddy showed clear signs of warming up,
and at 3:09:47 Freddy EXPLODED...... 

We immediately performed a control experiment with Jerry, Freddy's twin
brother, and this time we used ordinary tap water for the experiment.
Our claims of cold fusion were confirmed by the fact that Jerry exploded
after 10 minutes and 13 seconds, a full 26 seconds later than Freddy.

We are disappointed however in the reaction of our patent department,
they claim they don't think there is a commercial application for this
invention. We completely disagree with them. The amount of energy released
was incredible, based on the appearence of the lab after the explosion. 
Oh well, we can always get a nice publication out of it...

This joke, making the rounds in Warsaw, was related in an editorial in
the Boston Globe, 6/3/89. {ed Edited}

A dejected Communist Party candidate trudges home after the polls close.

"So, Marek, how many votes did you get?" asks his wife.

"Two," he responds.

She slaps him hard across the face.

"What was that for?"

"You have a mistress, now do you!!?"

A young woman has just undressed to step into the shower when the doorbell
rings.  She goes to the door and says, "Who is it?"

"Blind man," comes the reply.

So instead of going back to the bathroom for her robe, she opens the door.

"Hmmm.. nice body, lady.  Where do you want the blinds?"

In Hindu mythology, we come across the idea that gods can
be pleased by praying to them in difficult conditions such
as in harsh weather, etc. Perhaps the idea was that if one
can concentrate the mind on God /(a god) inspite of the
distractions, God will be pleased. Anyway, I heard the
following irreverent joke about this concept a few years back.

... A guy makes up his mind to please one particular god - Yama.
(Yama is supposed to be the god of death - the cosmic hit man.
 Like every god, he too has a vehicle - he rides on a bull.)
So this guy prays while standing on one leg, in rain, in snow,
... and so on. But Yama is in no hurry. The guy is getting
angry, but since he has already spent so much time on this 
endeavor, he decides to see it through. Finally, after a long
time, Yama appears in front of him and ...

YAMA : "Son, I am very pleased with your devotion. You can have
        3 boons. You may ask for wealth, women, immortality, anything."

Guy  : "Gee, let me see... I have always been fascinated by your
        bull. Let his two horns become one."

YAMA : "You are wasting 1 of your boons, but your wish is granted."
   ( and the bull's horns become one.)

Guy  : "Lord, I have always wondered what it will be like to have
        that horn shoved up someone's ass. Can YOU handle it?"

YAMA : ("What a weirdo .. but he has my word of honor.") "Well, OK.
       But you only have 1 more boon/wish left."

Guy  : "Your bull seems unhappy. Let his horn again become two."

Comment on the Ayatollah's funeral in Tehran (wherein the corpse of the

mourners trying to get a piece of his burial shroud to keep as a relic:

"It was a dignified affair, by Iranian standards."

I wrote this letter many years ago:


Pennsylvania State University Admissions
Address

Dear Sir,

I have received your acceptance for admission, and I regret 
to inform you that I will not be attending your university in 
coming years.

As a senior in high school, I have applied to many other fine 
institutions to further my education. And, although yours 
ranks high among them, I'm afraid that you failed to qualify.

Elimination under my system doesn't mean that you are not 
qualified to educate other fine young men and women.  It 
merely reflects the high caliber of colleges and universities 
competing for my acceptance.

My best wishes for your future.

                          Sincerely,


                           Brian Jay Gould

My brother in Belfast mailed this joke to me. They don't get the net over 
there (yet), so it falls on me to forward it.

**************************************************************************
     There's this pheasant standing in a field chatting to a bull.
"I would love to be able to get to the top of yonder tree" sighs
our feathered friend, "but I haven't got the energy." (bit of a
lazy layabout pheazzy) "Why don't you nibble on some of my droppings"
replies the bull sympathetically "they're packed with nutrients".
So our hero pecks at a lump of dung and finds he has enough strengh to
reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after some more eating
he can reach the second branch, and so it continues. Two weeks later we
find our plumed friend perched on the top of the tree proudly surveying
the countryside where he is spotted by the local farmer. "What a beautiful
creature" says the farmer as he dashes into the farmhouse. It is the work
of an instant for him to emerge with a shotgun and blow the f**k out of
the pheasant.
       The moral of this minor tragedy? Bullshit might get you to the top,
but it won't keep you there!

(I heard this from an MIT grad, who says it's a classic).

A student pushes a loaded shopping cart up to the express checkout
lane at a Cambridge grocery store.  The cashier looks at the cart,
looks at the student, looks at the "EXPRESS -- EIGHT ITEMS OR LESS"
sign, and says to the student, "Are you from Harvard, where they
don't know how to count?  Or MIT, where they don't know how to read?"

According to several press reports, the new drug of choice is
licking toads.

What a great lead!!

Yess, Bufo Alvirus (Sonoran desert toad to you simple folk) secretes
(a sweating toad?) bufotinine which doesn't do damn for the toad, but
makes humans feel very high indeed.

Says the Examiner story: "If you tried to lick this toad, it would
be a felonious act."

No report to date mentions what the toad turns into when you lick it.

Why not milk the toads and mix the stuff with something nice?

The head of DEA's western regional laboratory is not concerned:
"It's too nasty to screw around with," he said. "And you're going
to have to come up with a lot of toads to compete with cocaine and
marijuana."

The Berkeley police chief was suspicious because he knew of no
occurence of bufotinine use in Berkeley: "If it happened anywhere, it'd 
be here," he said.

Now you know.

	A young lady had unwantedly become pregnant and wanted an abortion.
	Unfortunately, a medical examination showed she could not and when
	told so by her doctor she broke down and cried. "I can't have a baby
	now...", she said, "There must be something you can do!". The doctor
	thought about this for a while, and suddenly he came up with an idea:
	"There is bound to be someone in this hospital in for an appendix
	operation when you give birth, and we'll just give her the baby and
	tell her it wasn't the appendix after all."

	The young lady agreed to his plan, but at the time she was giving birth
	there were no women in for appendix operation in the hospital, in fact
	the only person who was was an old priest. The doctor, desperately
	realizing the gravity or the situation and his promise figured he
	might as well try anyway.

	The priest was overwhelmed. Convinced this was an immaculate
	conception he took his little son home. The years passed and his son
	grew to become a fine boy. The priest was getting old, and finally he
	he called his son to his deathbed.

	"There is sommething I have to tell you", said the priest,
	"I am not your father". His son looked at him in surprise.
	The priest went on; "I am your mother, the bishop is your father".

(One for the True News Digest)

(From Paul Zucker, Newsbytes News Service:)

     SYDNEY, Australia (NB) -- A friend of Newsbytes swears that the 
following is a true story:

     After buying a PC from a dealer of shady shady repute, the 
luckless customer unpacked his new toy and plugged it in to find it 
Dead On Arrival.

     Naturally, after checking the usual things, he called the dealer 
and explained his problem.  First question from Deviously Evasive Dealer:
"Did you check to see whether the power was on?"

     "Of course."

     DED:  "Did you open the cover and check whether any of the boards 
had shaken loose in shipping?"

     "Of course."

     DED:  Then why are you calling me?"

     "Well, you sold it to me and there has to be some kind of 
warranty," pleaded the frustrated purchaser.

     "Of course there is," replied the DED, "But you voided the 
warranty when you opened the cover."

     Like we said, he swears it's a true story.

(On Late Night on 6/6/89.)

Dave has one of his more respectable guests on the show, a Connecticut
lady (didn't catch the name) who caters weddings and other social
events, and has written books on the subject.

She poses a question for Dave, that apparently someone has written her:

"Suppose have have set up a huge party in honor of someone.  You 
have set up a band, a large outdoor tent, and a complete spread of
hors 'doeuvres, etc.  Hundreds of invitations have been sent out. 

"Then, the night before the event, the guest of honor dies.  What would
you do?"


Dave replied, "Make sure he had adequate ventilation."

A mother due for an appointment with her gynaecologist was running too far
behind schedule to fit in a shower, so she opted for a quick cleanse with a
face washer. 

While being examined by the gynaecologist, she was taken aback by his
cryptic remark:

	"You shouldn't have gone to so much trouble!"

Well, she never...

But all became clear that night, when the woman's teenage daughter arrived
home and apologised for the spilt bottle of glitter on the bathroom floor. 

The sweet thing had mopped up the mess using the mother's face washer!

Tom Pauka and Rein Zunderdorp (Nijgh and van Ditmar, 1988)]

Red-tapism:

Take a cage with apes. In the cage we hang a banana on a string,
and put a stairs under it. Before long an ape goes to the stairs
towards the banana, but as soon as it even touches the stairs,
all apes are sprayed with water. After a while the same ape or
another one makes another attempt, with the same result: all
apes are sprayed. If later another ape tries to climb the
stairs, the others will try to prevent it.

 Now we take one ape from the cage and put in a new one. The new
ape sees the banana, and wants to climb the stairs. To his
horror all other apes attack him. After another attempt he
knows: if he wants to climb the stairs, he is beaten up. Then we
remove a second ape and replace it by another new one. The
newcommer goes to the stairs and gets beaten up. The previous
new ape takes part in the punishment with enthousiasm.

  A third old ape is replaced by a third new one. The new one
makes it to the stairs and get beaten up as well. Two of the
apes who beat him, have no idea why you may not climb the stairs.
  We replace the fourth old ape, and the fifth, etc until all
apes which ones have been sprayed with water have been replaced.
Nevertheless, no ape ever tries to climb the stairs.

(From Time Magazine, 19 June 1989 (therefore presumably true):)

No international laws govern the christening of countries;  the label
that sticks is determined by the tastes or even the sanity of its
rulers.  Anti-colonialism, however, is the most common rationale for
national renaming.

Filipinos have long bristled at the colonialistic implications of calling
their country the Philippines, in honor of Philip II of Spain.  During
the regime of Ferdinand Marcos, there was a campaign to rename the
country "Maharlika", a native word meaning noble and aristocratic.

Plans for the rechristening proceeded apace until an academic pointed out
that the word was probably derived from Sanskrit.

Fine, its proponents said, Sanskrit is a non-imperialist language.

Yes, replied the scholar, but "Maharlika" was most likely derived from the
words "maha lingam," meaning "great phallus."

That was the end of the campaign.

(From David Letterman's show of Tuesday 6-27-89, and transcribed from the

TOP TEN REASONS NOT TO SUSPEND PETE ROSE FROM BASEBALL

10. Really young gamblers need a role model.

9.  Ten million Pete Rose wigs already shipped to Hall of Fame gift shop.

8.  If suspended, might reveal identity of San Diego Chicken.

7.  He kept his promise to kid in hospital: "I'm putting 50 bucks on
today's game for you, son."

6.  Might go play baseball in Japan and develop comercially viable
superconductor during the offseason, which would increase Japan's
ever-widening economic supremacy over the United States.

5. He bet five grand they would suspend him and will make 50 grand at
10-to-1 odds.

4.  No casino greeter jobs currently open.

3.  Baseball needs professional wrestling pizzazz of being fixed.

2.  How can you suspend Off Track Betting's "Man of the Year"?

1.  Betting slips, fingerprints, handwriting, telephone records, sworn
depositions -- Come on!  Let's have some REAL proof!

Comments on the future evolution of languages:

There are consistent trends in the past evolution of languages, and in
all likelihood they will continue to change in the same fashion in the
future.

In 200 years, spoken French will have only one sound, a vowel.  All
consonants and gaps between words and sentences will disappear, leaving
only an extended "Eauuuuuuuuuuuu..."  Meaning will be inferred from 
facial expression.  Written French will stay exactly the same.

These consonants will not be entirely forgotten; they will migrate
to Czechoslovakia, which will by that time have no use for vowels.

In 200 years, the English vocabulary will be the union of all other
vocabularies, but the spelling will be original.

Similarly, the Japanese alphabet will be the union of all other alphabets
in the world.

The Cyrillic alphabet will eventually be the same as the Latin
alphabet, only backwards.  A mirror will suffice for translating
Russian into Polish.

Finally, in 200 years, entire books in Germany will be one word.  Plus
a verb at the end, of course.

When you're on "reserve" with an airline, you fly when they tell you 
to fly. Being unable to be contacted is a lesser offense than refusing
or missing an assigned trip.

This captain gets an "A" for his creativity in avoiding an assignment.
When crew scheduling woke him up at 3 A.M. to assign him to a 5 A.M.
departure, he passed the phone to his wife and said in a voice loud
enough for them to hear on the other end, "Here, darling, I think it's
someone calling for your husband."

Crew scheduling omitted the usual question and answer period.

comes in and the next man goes in until he's out.

When three men are out the side that's out comes in and the side

Here's an old one but it compliments the religious one you forward.

One day a nun was fishing and caught a huge fish for supper.  

A man was walking by and said: "Wow, what a god damn fish"!

The Sister said: "Sir, you shouldn't talk to me like that. I'm a nun."

And the man said: "But that's the name of it, a god damn fish."

So the Sister took the fish back to the rectory, and said:
"Mother Superior, look at the god damn fish I caught."

The Mother Superior said: "Sister, you shouldn't talk like that,"

..and the Sister said:  "But Mother Superior, that's the name of it,
a god damn fish."

So the Mother Superior said: "Well, give me the god damn fish and
I'll clean it".

While she was cleaning the fish the Monsignor walked in and she said:
"Monsignor, look at the god damn fish that the sister caught".

The Monsignor said: "Mother Superior, you shouldn't talk like that",
and the Mother Superior said: "but that's the name of it, a god damn fish".

So the Monsignor said: "Well, give me the god damn fish and I'll cook it".

That evening, at supper, there was a new priest at the table,
and he said:  "Wow, what a nice fish,"
...and the Sister said "I caught the god damn fish,"
...and Mother Superior said "I cleaned the god damn fish,"
...and the Monsignor said, "I cooked the god damn fish."

And the new priest said "I like this fucking place already"!

New York Times, August 8, 1989, Letter to the Editor, by Ruth L. Kaplan:

The other day I bought a roll of 25 cent postage stamps.  I have not
had a moment's peace since.  For, upon unfurling this roll, I
discovered that every one of the 100 stamps bears the unmistakable
likeness of the American flag.

To appreciate my consternation, consider what is in store for these
stamps.  First, I must lick the flag-- er, stamp.  Then I will drop it
into a dark box, where it may well be bruised, possibly even torn.
Next, the stamp/flag will go to the Post Office, where an inexorable
machine will stomp on it, defiling it with ugly lines in order to
"cancel" it.

"Cancel" our inviolable flag?

But wait.  The horrors mount.  In time, the stamp will reach the
addressee, who may rip it, eagerly opening the envelope.
Ultimately, the flag stamp-- licked, cancelled, defaced, ripped-- will
be consigned to the trash, doomed to decompose in a dump, linger in a
landfill or-- shudder!-- be converted to charcoal and burned under a
steak.

What's a patriot to do?

I wonder if the Post Office will allow me to return a rerolled roll of
stamps.  But even it it does, it'll just resell it, perhaps to some
insensitive stamper who will lick, deface, cancel and rip those flags
without a twinge of conscience.

I pray (but not in school) for some official, even Presidential, guidance.

A friend of mine worked as a State Highway patrolman in Wyoming for several
years.  Whenever he pulled someone over for speeding, he would always ask
them why they were exceeding the speed limit.  If the excuse was original,
he would usually let them off with a warning.  He said the best excuse he
ever got was the following:

Him: "So, why is it that you were doing 70 mph in a 55 zone?"
Driver: "Well, officer, my wife is going to get pregnant in 30 minutes
	 and I want to be there when it happens."

	The Baseball description reminds me of how this
native went to his first cricket match and described it
to his witchdoctor after he got back. I heard it when
I was in college and have no idea where it originated.

	He said "It was a beautiful sunny Sunday. A big
crowd of people gathered around this giant grass field
with a thin strip of mowed and flattened pitch in the middle.
There were three sticks at either end of the strip.
A man in a long overcoat came out with two men in sweaters
and he tossed a coin in to the air. They went out and out
came eleven men in sweaters and white pants. One of them was padded
and had big gloves. Then out came two men with pads on their legs 
and small gloves holding big sticks. They took positions at
either end of the strip and one of the other men came running
towards the wickets and threw this ball at the person holding
the stick. And lo and behold it started to pour.

	White man sure knows how to make rain"

A true and sort of bizzare story....

Source:  San Diego Union newspaper, Aug. 3, page F-2....


   Actor Rob Lowe wants his insurance company to pay his legal fees or
any damages awarded to a Georgia woman suing him over her teen-age
daughter's appearance in a homemade pornographic videotape.

But the Chubb Custom Insurance Company of New Jersey said Lowe's
insurance policy does not cover "intentional actions" such as
using "celebrity status as an inducement to females to engage in
sexual intercourse, sodomy, and multiple-party sexual activity for
his immediate sexual gratification and for the purpose of making
pornographic films."

The Chubb folks have asked a federal judge in Atlanta to rule that
damages arising from making sex tapes in a hotel room are not a covered
item under a homeowner's policy.

(But exactly what DOES that policy cover anyway???)

 Two guys, Stan and Ed, were working a construction job digging a
ditch. The foreman was at them all the time to keep busy. No breaks, just work,
work, work! Finally it dawned on the two guys that the foreman left every day
at 3:00 in the afternoon. So they decided to start leaving at 3:15.

 The very next day when the foreman left at 3:00, Stan and Ed left at
3:15. Stan goes home, walks through the house, opens the bedroom door, and there
on the bed is his wife and the foreman. Stan quickly runs back to the job and 
digs like mad until 5:00. The next day when Ed arrives at work, Stan says,
 "Listen Ed, we can't knock off work any more at 3:15.....
I almost got caught!!!!"

(Kinda long, but it makes a good party joke:)

A small balding <ethnic> storms into a local bar and demands "Gimme a double of
the strongest whiskey you got!  I'm so pissed I can't even see straight!"

The bartender, noticing that the little man is a bit the worse for wear,
pours him a double of Southern Comfort.

The <ethnic> swills down the drink and says "Gimme another one!".

The bartender pours the drink, but says "Now, before I give you this, why don't
you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"

So the <ethnic> begins his tale:

"Well, I was sitting in the bar next door when this gorgeous blonde slinks in,
and actually sits beside me at the bar.  I thought WOW, this has never happened
before.  You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true.  Well, a couple of
minutes later I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans
over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested?  I couldn't believe this was
happening!  I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand, and starts
walking out of the bar.  So of course I went with her.  This was just too good
to be true!"

"She took me down the street here to a nice hotel and up to her room.  As soon
as she shut the door she slips out of her dress.  That was all she was wearing!
I tell you it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes!  But as soon
as I jumped into the bed, I hear some keys jingling, and someone
starts fumbling with the door."

The blonde says "Ohmygod, it's my boyfriend.  He must have lost his wrestling
match tonight, he's gonna be real mad!  Quick, HIDE!"

"So, I opened at the closet, but I figured that was probably he first place he
would look, so I didn't hide there.  Then I looked under the bed, but no, I
figured he's bound to look there, too.  By now I could here the key in the lock. 
I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my
fingers praying that the guy wouldn't see me."

The bartender says "Well I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this
point."

"Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open and he yells out 'Who
you been sleeping with now, bitch?'  The girl says 'Nobody, honey, now come to
bed and calm down'.  Well the guy starts tearing up the room.  I hear him tear
the door off the closet and throw it across the room.  I'm thinking 'Boy, I'm
glad I didn't hide in there.'  Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it
across the room.  Good thing I didn't hide under there either."

"Then I here him say 'What's that over there by the window?'  I think 'Oh Shit,
I'm dead meat now'.  But the blond by now is trying real hard to distract him
and convince him to stop looking."

"Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long
time, and I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a
sudden the asshole pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right
on top of my head!  I mean look at this, I got second degree burns all over my
scalp and shoulders!"

The bartender says, "Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."

"No, that didn't really bother me.  Next the guy starts slamming the window shut
over and over on my hands.  I mean, look at my fingers.  They're a bloody mess,
I can hardly hold onto this glass."

The bartender looks at the guy's hands and says "Yeah, buddy, I can understand
why you are so upset."

"No, that wasn't what really pissed me off."

The bartender then asks in exasperation, "Well, then, what DID finally piss you
off?" 

"Well I was hanging there, and I turned around and looked down, and I was only
about 6 inches off the ground!"

NEW INFANTS MIRACLE DIET FOR OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE 

  Flabby Americans are always on the look out for a new diet.  The trouble
with most diets is that you don't get enough to eat (the starvation diet) or
you don't get enough variation (the liquid diet) or you go broke (the all-meat
diet). 

  Consequently, people tend to cheat on their diets, or quit after three days,
or go right back to stuffing their faces after it is all over.  Is there
nothing you can do but give up and tell your friends that you've got a gland
problem?  Or is there a slim hope? Such is the Infants' Miracle Diet. 

  Over the years, you may have noticed, as I have, that most two-year olds are
trim.  It came to me one day over a cup of black coffee and a carrot that
perhaps their diet is the reason.  After consultation with pediatricians,
X-ray technicians and distraught mothers, I was able to formulate this new
diet.  It is inexpensive, offers great variety and sufficient quantity. 
Before embarking on the diet however, be sure to check with your doctor,
otherwise you might have to see him afterward. 


FIRST DAY: 

  Breakfast:  One scrambled egg, one peice of toast with grape jelly. Eat two
bites of egg, using your fingers; dump the rest on the floor.  Take one bite
of toast, then smear the jelly over your face and clothes. Lunch: Four crayons
(any color), a handful of potato chips, and a glass of milk (three sips only,
then spill the rest). Dinner: A dry stick, two pennies and a nickle, four sips
of stale beer. Before Bedtime, toast a piece of bread and toss it on the
kitchen floor. 


SECOND DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Pick up stale toast off kitchen floor and eat.  Drink half
bottle of vanilla extract or one vial of vegetable dye. Lunch: Half a tube of
Pulsating Pink Lipstick, and a cigarette (to be eaten not smoked).  Ice cube
if desired. After lunch, lick an all day sucker until sticky, take it outside
and drop it in the dirt.  Retrieve it and continue slurping until it is clean
again.  Bring it inside and drop it on the rug. Dinner: A rock or and an
uncooked bean, which should be thrust up your left nostril.  Pour iced tea
over mashed potatoes; eat with spoon. 


THIRD DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Two pancakes with plenty of syrup, eat with fingers, rub fingers
in hair.  Glass of milk, drink one-half, stuff pancakes in glass.  After
breakfast pick up sucker from rug, lick off fuzz and put on cushion of your
best chair. Lunch: Three matches, peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Spit
several bites onto the floor.  Pour milk on table and slurp up. Dinner: dish
of ice cream, handful of potato chips, some wine, coffee. 


LAST DAY: 

  Breakfast: a quarter tube of toothpaste (any flavor), bit of soap, an olive,
pour glass of milk over bowl of cornflakes, add 1/2 cup sugar.  When cereal is
soggy, drink milk and feed cereal to dog. Lunch: Eat crumbs off kitchen floor
and dining room carpet, including bites of sandwich you spit out yesterday.
One soft drink. Find sucker and finish eating it. Dinner: A glass of spaghetti
and chocolate milk.  Leave meatball on plate.  Stick of mascara for dessert.

Expert: Well, they called in the KGB who promptly kidnapped 
some relatives of the people who were presumed responsible,
castrated them and sent them back with the message that this
would happen to the the kidnapers themselves if the hostages

For many years, I've battled with the infamous "Dunlop's Disease" ... 
a condition caused by age and lake of proper maintenance in which 
your "stomach `done lopped' over your belt."
I had noticed that most women do not suffer from this condition,
many of them accumulating any excess weight on the hips and thighs,
and/or under the belt.

I've recently discovered, however, that some women also suffer from a 
malady similar to Dunlop's disease in that it is also caused by age 
and lack of maintenance called "Bureau Breakdown" ... 
in which your chest falls into your drawers.

	Computer Stories from a Field Service Engineer
        ---------------------------------------------

When I worked for a company that had a contract with 3M, 3M had asked me
to write them a memo describing why we were having problems with diskette
failures.  I said in the memo that the disks were failing due to head
crashes.  "If the customers would just clean their heads periodically, we
wouldn't have these problems," I said in the memo.  One customer responded
with "What kind of shampoo do you recommend?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An end-user hotline received a call about a bad software disk.  They asked
the customer to make a copy of the disk and mail it in to the hotline.
A few days later, they received a letter with a mimeographed copy of
the disk.  Since it was a double-sided disk, both sides of the disk
had been xeroxed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Computer Operator says as she is lifting an RP06 disk pack from the drive:
"Gee, how much does one of these weigh?"
Me: "It depends on how much data is on the disk....
The operator believed it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	I had a similar experience while working as a student operator at
Michigan Tech. One particularly trying afternoon, the computer was merrily
crashing for a number of reasons. After about four such spectacles, we
broadcast that the computer would be down for the remainder of the afternoon.
There was a resigned groan from the users and they began to file out of the
Center, except for one comely young woman with wide blue eyes who wandered up
to the counter and queried:
	"What's wrong with the computer?"
Too tired and irritated to give her a straight answer, I looked her straight 
in the eye and replied: "Broken muffler belt."
A look of deep concern wafted into her expression as she asked:
	"Oh, that's bad. Can you call Midas?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I work for University Computing Services answering questions about any and all
aspects of computing here, and as a result I run into some truly astonishing
mental densities...  A few excerpts from the Helpdesk:
Caller: "What's the name for when you're entering data into the computer?"
    HD: "Data Entry."
Caller: "Thank you!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overheard in a student computer lab:
Client (raising hand and waving frantically): "The computer says 'Enter your
name and press RETURN.'  What do I do??"
Lab Assistant: "Enter your name and press RETURN."
Client (as if a revelation has struck): "Oh!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another friend of mine in a similar situation reports having a student in the
lab one day, who had to abort out of the SET PASSWORD sequence because he 
couldn't think of a six-letter word.

Here are highlights from Comedy Celebration Day on July 31, 1988 in
San Francisco.  For those who plan WAY in advance, next year's
Comedy Celebration Day is Sunday, July 30th (1989!).

These are some of the comedians more memorable quotes during the day: 

Michael McShane
---------------
   I owe the government $3400 in taxes.  So I sent
   them two hammers and a toilet seat.

   I'm a Psychic Amnesiac.  I know in advance what I'll forget.


Sue Murphy
----------
   Did you ever walk into a room and forget why you walked in?  I think
   that's how dogs spend their lives.

   My mother wants grandchildren, so I said, "Mom, go for it!"

Fred Reuss
----------
   I went to a Grateful Dead Concert and they played for SEVEN hours.
   Great song.

   Yuppie pregnant women don't go into labor, they go straight into management.


Jake Johansen
-------------
   A lady came up to me on the street and pointed to my suede jacket.
   "You know a cow was murdered for that jacket?" she sneered.  I replied
   in a psychotic tone, "I didn't know there were any witnesses. Now I'll
   have to kill you too."

Buzz Belmondo
-------------
   It gives me great pleasure to introduce this next comedian.  But before
   I give myself great pleasure....

Lank and Earl
-------------
   Lank:  Here we go.  We're about to set a new record.
   Earl:  (to the crowd) How about a date?
   Lank:  We've done it.  Earl has set a new record.  Turned down by
          20,000 women.

Bruce Baum
----------
   I don't kill flies, but I like to mess with their minds.  I hold them above
   globes.  They freak out and yell "Whooa, I'm way too high."

Mark Pitta
----------
   I like to sing to the songs on the radio in my car.  When you go into
   a tunnel, it's hard to come out on the right note.  Actually, the news is
   more difficult.

   I like to go to concerts that are related, like Talking Heads with
   Simple Minds.  I also rent videos together too.  Last week I rented
   "Bambi" and "The Deerhunter."

Mark Guido
----------
   Hotels are tired of getting ripped off. I checked into a hotel and they
   had towels from my house.

   I play golf even though I hate it.  I'm not done with a game yet.
   I hate those windmills.

Steve Kravitz
-------------
   How about those Dodge Turbo Wagons?!  What's the deal on those anyway?
   You can sleep in the back while you're waiting for a tow truck.


Jim Samuels
-----------
   I don't have a problem with San Francisco parking. I drive a forklift.

   This Thanksgiving is gonna be a special one.  My mom says I don't
   have to sit at the card table.

   Last Halloween was bad for me.  I got real beat up.  I went to a
   party dressed as a Pinata.

   Remember folks.  Street lights timed for 35 mph are also timed for
   70 mph.

Al Clethen
----------
   In Los Angeles, McDonalds quickly reacted to the highway shootings.
   They came out with 'Happy To Be Alive Meals.'   LA is a real strange
   place.  Even the Chinese Drivers honk me for driving too slow.

Kevin Rooney
------------
   I have one of those real old American built cars.  The kind that
   just PUNCHES through accidents.

John ?????
----------
   You just know when a relationship is about to end.  My girlfriend
   called me at work and asked me how you change a lightbulb in  the
   bathroom.  "It's very simple," I said. "You start by filling up the
   bathtub with water..."

Michael Prichard
----------------
   I come from a small town whose population never changed.  Each time
   a woman got pregnant, someone left town.

Authors Unknown, but still funny
-------------------------------
   There are a lot of drunk people about to drive home, so drive as fast
   as you can.  It's harder for drunk people to hit you.

   Oprah Winfrey has an incredible talent for getting the wierdest
   people to talk to.  And you just HAVE to watch it.  "Blind, masochistic
   minority, crippled, depressed, government latrine diggers, and the
   women who love them too much on the next Oprah Winfrey."

   You're a great crowd.  No, you're not a crowd, you're a mob.
