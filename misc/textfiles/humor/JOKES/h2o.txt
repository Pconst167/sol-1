 Subject: How Gullible are We?
 
 A freshman at Eagle Rock Junior High won first prize at the Greater
 Idaho Falls Science Fair, April 26.  He was attempting to show how
 conditioned we have become to alarmists practicing junk science and
 spreading fear of everything in our environment.  In his project he
 urged people to sign a petition demanding strict control or total
 elimination of the chemical "dihydrogen monoxide."
 
 And for plenty of good reasons, since:
 
       1. it can cause excessive sweating and vomiting
       2. it is a major component in acid rain
       3. it can cause severe burns in its gaseous state
       4. accidental inhalation can kill you
       5. it contributes to erosion
       6. it decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes
       7. it has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients
 
 He asked 50 people if they supported a ban of the chemical.
 Forty-three
 said yes, six were undecided, and only one knew that the chemical
 was water.
 
 The title of his prize winning project was, "How Gullible Are We?"
 He feels the conclusion is obvious.
