 The little cabbage in the field was consulting its mother
 about life. "Life," said the mother "is a gamble; you've
 got to withstand  storms, drought, wind, animals--not to
 mention bugs, lice, mold, rot.  But, if you don't give up,
 you'll thrive and grow." "Life certainly is a gamble,"
 agreed the little cabbage, "but there's one thing you
 haven't made clear: when do I quit growing?" "As in any
 other gamble," said Mother Cabbage, "quit when you're a
 head!"

     I knew this eccentric Frenchman who raises carp in the

Speaking of Spiney Norman, a Hedgehog:
    Not many people are aware that he doesn't work alone; much of the
time he is accompanied by Celeste, a giant shark. I didn't
realize it myself until I spent a vacation in the islands.
Unfortunately I happened to pick a time when the two of them were
terrorizing the countryside.
    One day I went down to the beach prepared to do some jogging and
maybe ride the waves when I noticed this palm tree at the shore
had been almost completely devoured by some giant creature. I
asked a native whether the tree had been destroyed by Norman or
Celste and he asked me why I cared. My response was "If Norman
ate it I will not run, if Celeste did I will not surf".


And of course you heard about the Pole and the Czech who
went hunting...
   The rangers had warned them about the bears, but they felt
they were well enough equipped.  So when the two were two
days late the rangers went into the forest to find them.
   Their campsite was a shambles, but no sign could be found of
the two hunters; but from the behavior of a couple of bears
in the neighborhood, the rangers were sure they knew what
had happened.  They shot the bears, and cut them open.  They
found the remains of the Pole in the female.
   The Czech was in the male.

     For the grand opening of a super-de-luxe deli in Vegas,
     the proud owner stopped at nothing to shout the news
     about! He even hired two ping-pong players to play on a
     table in front of the new deli. Since it WAS a deli,
     the players used pickles instead of balls, and the
     crowd cheered wildly as the pickles were batted back
     and forth across the net. They called it, of course,
     "The Volley of the Dills."

When Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, he had trouble
selling it. People just didn't trust this "new" way of
making light. In order to promote his idea he decided to go
around the country installing lights in different towns in
order to drum up publicity. While in Oklahoma, Edison
stopped by an Indian reservation and offered to put lights
in any building they wanted.  After much thought the Indian
chief decided that he wanted lights in his outhouse, so he
could see what he was doing at night. This made him the
first man to wire a head for a reservation!

Harry Sharp finally developed a way to clone human beings.   To test it,
he made a duplicate of himself, and took the duplicate before a board of
peers.   However, Harry's system had some bugs.   At the review, Harry,
asked his duplicate to recite the method of cloning for the board, upon
which the duplicate recited the most foul string of obscenities ever
heard.   Haarry was aghast, and struck the duplicate, causing it to fall
to it's death from the 5th floor room they were in.   Harry was arrested
and charged with making an obscene clone fall.

  One evening, a little boy greets his father after work, and
notices a condom fall out of the pocket as the man takes off his
coat.  Dear old dad doesn't notice until the child opens the
packet and examines the device close-up.
  "Daddy, what's this for?" he asks innocently.
  "Er, um, that's to keep my cigarettes dry when it's raining
out! Yeah."  The boy is satisfied with the explanation and goes
about his buisness.
  A week goes by, and the kid remembers that tomorrow is his
father's birthday.  He scrimps up as much change as he can and
heads for the Five & Ten shop, looking for a gift.  The first
thing he notices is a condom display rack.  Excitedly, he
approaches a clerk.
  "Miss, are those Trojans over there?" he asks excitedly.
  "Um, yes they are, little boy..." the clerk answers unsurely.
  "I wanna buy a box!" he proudly announces.
  "Yes, of course.  And what size will that be?"
  "I don't care, as long as they're big enough to fit a Camel! "

Long ago, Elmir the Curious sailed a small craft far away.
   He sought the Elixir of Youth. It was said that a bush grew
somewhere along the river bank, the leaves of which, when
cooked for many hours, produced a substance which could ward
off the effects of age.
   One afternoon he happened upon the bush!!!
   He cooked two vials of a strange pungent substance, and
called all the elders of the city, explaining that he was
prepared to sell his Elixir of Youth.
   How do we know it will work, they asked.
   Elmir was incensed by these doubts. As they watched he drank
it all himself.
   He never spoke of it again, though he lived for many years.
Many inquired, but his lips were sealed. You see, he had
invented Elmir's glue.

   until midnight when the apparition became visible.  The

a young man who was prematurely bald went to a barber for a trim.  during
the course of the short haircut the young man asked if there was a
dependable hair restorer.  the barber gave him the advice that
stimulation of the scalp was best accomplished by rubbing the scalp
against his wife's snatch three or four times a day for fifteen minutes
each 24 hour period.        the man left and about one year later a hairy
monster comes into the barber shop and says, "hey there. remember me?"
       the barber says,"pull the hair away so i can see your face."
        the guy spreads the hair so his face can be seen and says," i am
the guy you told to rub my head on my wife's pussy to stimulate hair
growth.  it really works good."
           the barber twirled the tip of his 16 inch mustache between his
thumb and forefinger and answered, "you're telling me?"

parents.  The Prez paused in his talk with the announcement that
he had recently heard a good Aggie joke he wanted to share with
the group.  At once, an offended parent stood up shouting, "Hey,
I'm an Aggie!"  The Prez paused for a moment and replied:  "Okay
for you, I'll tell it  r e a l    s  l  o  o  o  w."

A man was out for a walk one day and on his travels he wandered
through a farm. Strangely, he saw a pig with a wooden leg!
  This intrigued him so much he found the farmer and quizzed him
about it.
  "This be no ordinary pig" said the farmer. "For example, only two
days ago there was a fire in the chicken shed when I was away
from the farm. The pig noticed this and immediately went and let
all the chickens out into the yard. He then phoned for the fire
brigade and came straight back to hold the fire until they
arrived!"
  "And a few weeks ago, I was driving my tractor down a steep hill,
when I lost control and the vehicle overturned - knocking me
unconscious! The pig saw this, phoned for the ambulance and then
rushed to the tractor and pulled me clear of the cab just before
it set on fire."
  The framer was just about to launch into another tale when the
man said "Yes yes, but what about the wooden leg?"
  "Well" said the farmer "when you've got an pig as good as that,
you don't eat it all at once!"

"the Prime Minister's devious hand is afoot."

There was a math teacher named Paul
Who had a hexagonal ball.
The square of its weight.
And his pec*er plus eight.
Is his phone number.  Give him a call.

       WE were in Geology Class (About 300 people) and on Final Exam the
teacher called for the Exam Papers.  Well 5 minutes later, sure enuff, a
Student Came Down with his Exam Paper and tried to turn it it.  Well of
course the Teacher Said he couldn't Accept it! Well the student asked
the teacher "do you know me?"  The teacher replied "No" And so the
student then lifted up the Stack of Exam Papers and insterted his Exam
and walked away.

The Abbot of the Monastery was very strict in his routine.
Each morning, he'd come out of his cell, go into the main
room where all the monks were sitting, and chant "Good
Morning."  They would chant back "Good Morning."  At the
evening meal, he'd enter the room and sing "Good Evening,"
and they would reply in kind. One morning, though, in
response to his greeting, he distinctly heard one monk sing
"Good Evening."  Wondering if his ears were going, he sang
"Good Morning," only to hear the anomalous greeting again.
Looking about the room, he sang "Someone Chanted 'Evening.'"

    After the third murder in as many months of residents
     of the fourth floor of the dormitory, Sherlock Holmes was
     called in the case. In each death the body of a student had
     been discovered the next morning crushed and covered with
     tire marks. "How did a car get onto the fourth floor?",
     asked the baffled campus security police. "Have you
     noticed", Holmes said, "that the deaths all occurred when
     there was a full moon?". I believe that we are dealing with
     that unhappy curse of modern technological society- the
     descendent of the werewolf, the weremobile!!!" On the next
     night that the moon was full, the Great Detective took
     action. Every student that lived on the fourth floor was
     locked in a separate room, along with an electronically
     monitored five-gallon can of gasoline. Toward the middle of
     the night the instruments showed the disappearance of the
     gas in room 440, which was occupied by a Japanese-American
     student named Nagawa. "He's pouring out the gas!", whispered
     the security chief. "No!, he's drinking it," said Holmes.
     Peering through the keyhole of room 440 they saw that the
     student was no longer there, and in his place was a Japanese
     compact car!!! The next morning Holmes confronted Nagawa.
     "When the moon is full, you become an automobile, and you
     run over your fellow students on the fourth floor." "But how
     did you know?", gasped Nagawa. "Alimentary, my were-Datsun."

    A man was shipwrecked on yet another island.He built
    himself a grass and straw shelter and all was OK until a
    flock of Terns flew onto the island.      The terns started
    pecking at his shelter,weakening it.This would not do,so the
    usually gentle man started throwing stones at the terns;till
    all flew away save one.                         Well,the man
    figured that one tern could do no harm,so he didn't bother
    to chase it away.The last tern kept pecking at the
    shelter,till it fell in upon the sleeping man ,smothering
    him.What is the moral of this story???       Never leave a
    tern unstoned!!!

    A man had a weird illness.Whenever he broke wind,it made
    the sound"honda". He asked his doctor about it but the
    doctor after months of tests and literature-reading,could
    not figure it out.Finally,just before he was about to give
    up,he has an idea!"I'll call Honda Company in Japan and ask
    the company doctor!!" Well,he called the Japanese doctor and
    was told by him to see if the patient had an abscess in his
    teeth somewhere. Sure enough,there is,and when it was
    treated the other affliction ended!  When th e doctor asked
    his Japanese counterpart how he could make such a great
    diagnosis over the phone from such a long distance away the
    man replied,simple: Abscess makes a fart go honda!!!

A man was cleaning out his attic, throwing out all the old junk, when
his friend Bill came over to see him.   "Find anything decent up here?"
he asked.    "Well, not much.   Best thing I found was this old Bible,
written by some guy named Gutenberg.   Ever seen one of these?"    Bill
said, "That book is one of the most valuable books ever to exist!
There's only 13 of them known left!    It's worth MILLIONS!"   "Well,
mine can't be worth that much.   Some ass named Martin Luther scribbled
all over it."

Did you ever think as a hearse goes by,
That you might beeee the next to die.
They wrap you up in a nice clean sheet,
And throw you in about 6 feet deep.
Then all goes well for about a week,
Until the coffin begins to leak.
  The worms crawl in..
  The worms crawl out..
  In your stomach and out your mouth..
  They eat your fingers,
  They eat your toes..
  They eat the boogers right out of your nose...

  'Twas the Pig Fair last September.
 The day I well remember
  I was walking up and down in drunken pride..
 When My knees began to flutter,
  So I sat down in the gutter..
 When a Pig came up and lay down by my side.

  As I was sitting in the gutter,
 Thinking thoughts I could not utter..
  I thought I heard a passing lady say:
 "You can tell a man who boozes
  By the company he chooses."
 And with that the pig got up and walked away.

A computer?! Where?! Oh... you mean this?...

In Japan many years ago and old farmer was tending the wheet
fields on the steep hillside above a small fishing settlement.
As he stood up to rest his back, he gazed out to sea.  To his
horror saw a tsunami approaching; the people in the villiage
were, of course, unaware of the impending distruction and
death.  The villiage was too far away for waving or hollering to
provide an effective alert.  How was he to save the people?  He
set fire to the villiage's wheet fields.  The people down below
saw the flames and most rushed up to the high ground to
prevent the destruction of their crop and, thus avoided the tidal
wave that crushed the villiage.

there was the guy driving along the highway at 40. A
chicken was keeping up with him and the chicken had three legs.
He increased speed to 60 and the chicken was still running
alongside. He then increased his speed to 80, and the chicken
sped up and cut across in front of him and went up a sideroad.
The guy was intrigued by all this, so turned around and drove
into the sideroad which ended in a farmer's yard. The farmer came
over to the car and asked if he could help. The motorist asked if
he had seen a three-legged chicken come through his yard. The
farmer said he had and, as a matter of fact, he and his sons had
bred the chickens to provide three drumsticks.
"How are they?" asked the motorist.
"Hell," replied the farmer, "WE don't know, we've never been able
to catch one of them!"

My favorite college joke is about the lad from the hills of
Kentucky who won a scholarship to MIT. In familiarizing himself
with the campus, he was walking across the quad and stopped an
upperclassman to ask, ""Scuse me, can you tell me whar the
liberry is at?" The upperclassman drew himself up to his full
height and haughtily told the lad he was attanding the most prestigious
engineering  school in the world and that they prided themselevs
on being able to communicate properly as well. He said they NEVER
ended a sentence with a preposition and asked if the lad would
like to rephrase his question. The kid looked him up and down and
said, "Shore, can you tell me whar the liberry is at, a**hole."
