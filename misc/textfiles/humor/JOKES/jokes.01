 This guy gets a raise, so he decides to but a new sight for his gun.
Well, anyway, the salesman at the store is throwing his pitch, and he
brags, "If you'll look through this sight, I'll bet that you can see my
house in perfect detail, even though it's the whole way at the top of the
hill."

 So the guy looks through the sight, and says, "Yep, you're right... wait
a minute... I can see some lady and a guy running around with no clothes
on, too..."

 Shocked, the salesman snatches the sight back, and looks through it.
Sure enough, he sees the same thing.  Infuriated, the salesman hands the
guy a gun and two bullets, and says,  "If you'll blow my cheatin' wife's
head off, and that guy's dick off, you can have the sight for free."

 The guy looks throught the sight again.  "You know, I think I can do that
with only 1 bullet..."

 God finally decided to take Satan to court, to settle their differences
once and for all.

 Upon hearing this, Satan laughed, and said, "Where do you think you're
going to find a lawyer?"

The dean of Engineering had once walked into a class, and said               
"Good Morning." The whole class chorused "Good Morning".

"Hi, you are freshmen aren't you?" he asked.

One student bolder than the others asked him how he knew.

"Well," he said. "When I say 'Good Morning' to a class, if they are
freshmen they say 'Good Morning' too. If they are sophomores, they
quietly fold their papers away, and look at me. A class of Juniors 
will look at me over the top of their papers, and then get back to
them. A class of Seniors will ignore my greeting, and keep reading
the papers. When I say 'Good Morning' to a class of graduate students,
they write it down.
