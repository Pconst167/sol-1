This guy has four daughters who all live at home. One Friday night the 
doorbell rings. The guy answers it and a kid standing there says 
"Hi, I'm Freddy. 
I'm here to pick up Betty. 
We're gonna go eat spaghetti. 
Is she ready?" 

The man, mildly amused calls down his daughter and the two leave. 

A few minutes later the doorbell rings again and he answers. A kid 
standing there says 
"Hi, I'm Jim. 
I'm here to see Kim. 
We're gonna go for a swim. 
Can I come in?" 

The guy, now perplexed, says "Yes." and the two take off. 

A few minutes later the doorbell rings and again the father answers. A 
kid standing there says 
"Hi, I'm Joe. 
I'm here to pick up Flo. 
We're gonna go to the show. 
Can she go?" 

The man, now kind of annoyed says "Yes." the two depart. 

Sure enough, a few minutes later the door rings and the father answers. 
A kid standing there says 
"Hi, I'm Chuck.." 

The father shot him.
