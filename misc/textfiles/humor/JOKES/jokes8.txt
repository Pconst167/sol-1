     Jack and Jill were hired by a big computer corporation.  They
worked there for about half a year until hard times hit the company.
The boss was forced to lay people off until it he got to Jack and
Jill's department.  Jack was on his coffee break, so the boss told
Jill:
     "I'm sorry, Jill.  But I'm gonna have to lay you or Jack off."
     "Well I'm sorry too," replied Jill.  You're gonna have to
jack off cause I have a headache!"

for insane dictators.

it's my honeymoon." responded the younger.  "Well, if it's your 
honeymoon, shouldn't you be in the cabin with the missus, if you know
what I mean?"  "Can't," responded the fisherman, "she's got gonnorhea."
"Well, I say, I mean, couldn't you, um, sort of, er, flip her over?" 
"Nope, she's also got diarrhea."  "Er, um, you could, ulp, use her 
mouth, couldn't you?"  "Uh-uh.  She's got pyorrhea, you know, gum 
disease."  "Well, what the hell did you marry her for?"  Casting his 
line over the water he responded, "She's also got worms, and they're 
great for fishing."

Proof that all odd numbers are prime, various approaches:
 
Mathematician:  3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, therefore by
induction, all odd numbers are prime.
 
Alternate mathematician's proof:  3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime,
9 is not prime, neither is 15, therefore not all not odd numbers are 
not prime; applying the contrapositive, the original lemma holds.
 
Physicist:  3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9--experimental error,
11 is prime, 13 is prime...therefore all odd numbers are prime.
 
Engineer: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is prime, 11 is prime...
 
Philosopher: 3 is prime, therefore all odd numbers are prime.
 
Lawyer: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 11 is prime...

A black man goes to the unemployment office.  The counselor tells him
they have a scanner that determines what job will best suit him, and 
leads him to a booth.  "A tape will come out with code letters on it,
and you just bring this tape to me when it's finished.  Now I can't stay
in the booth with you because it will read both of us and get confused."
So the black guy waits in the booth, a light comes on, and a scanning
device starts moving around his body.  The tape with code letters starts
coming out the the machine.  The first letters are B I M M.  "Bimm? What
be Bimm?  I know, I be working for Bimm Corporation.  Alright!" Now the
second line of code comes out: H Y . "H Y?  Hawaii! I be working for 
Bimm Corporation in Hawaii!"  The third line now emerges, B A R . "Hot
damn! I be tending bar in Hawaii for Bimm!" And then another line: T P
C T . "T P C T? What that? I know! Ten Percent! I be getting ten percent
tending bar in Hawaii for Bimm!" The COMPLETE light turns on, so he 
leaves the booth and saunters over to the counselor with the tape, 
grinning from ear to ear. "I know what this code means!  I be working
for Bimm Corporation in Hawaii, tending bar and I get ten percent!"

The counselor looks at the tape:

A Russian and a Pole were college roommates, and stayed in touch when
the Pole returned to his native land. Ten years go by and the Russian
happens to find himself in Warsaw, so he calls his friend up. They get
together at the Pole's country place, drink imported French wine, and
admire original artwork. The Russian is surprised at the Pole's 
trappings of success and asks how he made out so well. "You see, Ivan,
being a civil engineer does not require living poorly? See that bridge
out there?" he asked, pointing, "I ordered three times as much steel as
I needed, and sold the rest on the black market.  That's how I can 
manage to live so comfortably." The Russian thinks the matter over on
his way home. Ten more years go by, and the Pole finds himself in Moscow
for the Fourth Five-Year-Plan Congress of Civil Engineers, and runs into
his dear friend Ivan.  Ivan insists on taking Jerzy to his dachau, and
it is three times bigger than Jerzy's. They sip 1959 Cognac, feast on
Maine Lobster and Argentine beef, and admire rare first-edition books,
many officially banned. "I've got to hand it to you Jerzy, your 
suggestions worked wonders." "I'm stunned! How did you get away with 
this much money?" "Easy Jerzy, just look out the window at that bridge."
"WHAT bridge?"  "Exactly."

 It seems that when God was making the world, He called man over and
bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life.  Man was horrified!!
"Only twenty years of normal sex life?"  But the Lord was very adamant;
that was all man could have.
     Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him twenty years.  "But
I don't need twenty years", he protested, "ten is plenty for me".  Man
spoke up eagerly. "Can I have the other ten?"  The monkey graciously 
agreed. 
     Then the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years; and the
lion, like the monkey, wanted only ten.  Again man spoke up: "Can I have
the other ten?"  The lion said of course he could. 
     Then came the donkey and he was given twenty years.  But, like the
others, ten was sufficient, and again, man pleaded: "Can I have the 
other ten?"
     Which explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life, ten 
years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of
making an ass of himself.

three strings were standing in front of a bar and were deciding wether
or not to have a drink. The first says "You know they don't serve 
strings in this bar." The second says, "let's try anyway."
  
So the first string goes up to the bar and asks the bartender for a 
beer. The bar tender says "Your a string. We don't serve strings here
Get out of my bar"
   
The second string goes in and asks for a drink and gets the same 
treatment.
   
The third string decides that a disguise would help and makes a not at
his neck to look like a tie and frays the end of the string to look like
hair. He enters the bar and asks the bartender for a beer and the 
bartender serves him one. But the bartender thinks something is wrong
and stares at the string for a while and comes over and says "Are you
a string?" The string replies "No, I'm afraid not"

When Quasimodo died, the priest posted notices all over town that he 
needed a new bell-ringer.  No one in town wanted the job, since the 
hours were terrible and the working conditions lousy, so the priest got
worried.  One day an out-of-towner applied for the job. Problem was he
had no arms, and the priest asked how he could ring the bells. "Just 
watch me!" he said, and they went up to the bell tower. Suddenly the man
ran full tilt into the bell and struck it with his head, letting forth
a majestic CLANGGG!! Well, the priest really needed a bell-ringer, and
if this guy was going to do the job, however strangely, fine. So he was
hired and dutifully rang the bells.
 
One morning he came to the tower with a nasty hangover, and he was so
out of it he couldn't see straight. So when he ran up to the bell to 
butt it with his head, he missed, went sailing out the window, and fell
250 feet to his death. The townspeople, not knowing who he was, got very
concerned and gathered around his corpse. Along came the priest. 
"Father, do you know this man?" they asked. "No I don't.  But, his face
rings a bell."

Well, the priest needed another bell-ringer, and, again, no one in town
wanted the job.  So when another armless out-of-towner applied, the 
priest hired him immediately.
 
Sure enough, the man comes to work a week later with a hangover, misses
the bell, and goes out the window and onto the cobblestones--SPLAT!! The
townspeople remembered the other sad incident, and when the priest came,
they asked if the mangled armless corpse was the same man as the last
one.  "No," replied the priest, "but he's a dead ringer!"

2 gays decide to have a baby. The one gets a sex change, becomes
pregnant and the baby is born. When they go to the hospital 
nursery, they notice that all of the babys are crying except 
one. They ask the nurse which is their baby: she says the quiet
one. One gay remarks 'Isn't it nice that our baby is so 
contented !'. The nurse says, "Oh yeah ? Wait 'till I take the
pacifier out of his ass!"
