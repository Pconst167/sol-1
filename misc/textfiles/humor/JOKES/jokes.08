The following is a light hearted look at american football. Hit 'n'
now if you are offended easily by random sillyness that pokes fun
at americans.

 
Well nothing much has happened in the world of sports.  It is the superbowl 
today however, this is a United States event (I would have said American 
however I am in North America and would not like to be included in this 
tradition).  The event is a game where large brainless men smash into each 
other in order to advance a pig's skin, shaped in an oblong fashion, to the 
opponent's end of a 100 yard field.  Many people will wager on this event and
still many more will watch it with non-financial interests.  Many beer and 
car making corporations will vie for an advertising spot during the game by 
paying them largest amounts of money ever recorded for a Television spot 
in history.  They often try to get the brainless players to endorse their 
products first hand.  This seems very illogical as these men are not known 
for their acting abilities and they are usually retired players of superbowl 
past.  They also firmly believe that miller light is either less filling or 
it tastes great, but never both at once.  Sometimes musicians and comedians 
help the brainless men because they are more inclined to acting.

  Well back to the actual game.  This superbowl activity does not have 
anything to do with tupperware parties.  It is the final game of a season's 
worth of FOOTBALL.  The word football is used for this game to piss off the 
British who refer to their game of soccer as football.  This makes 
more sense, as soccer is played mostly with the foot and the superbowl is not.
It is also worthy to note that the vast majority of the planet prefers the 
game of soccer to that of U.S. football. They hold a world championship every
year in soccer that the U.S. is never a contender in.  The U.S. has in turn 
retaliated by coining the term "World Series" to the American game of 
baseball. (which the central Americans are much better at playing then native 
U.S. players).
    
  Well once again getting off the topic of the game.  Men named after 
various body parts (quarter back, tight end) line up facing each 
other and when certain grunts have been uttered they run into each other.  
The team with the pig then tries to pass it through the line of men.  They 
have three chances to move the ball 10 yards.  If they do not succeed they get 
angry and kick the ball at the opponent's side of the field.  The opponents 
then try to return the ball until they get mad and kick it back.
SUCCESS When a goal is scored.

If by chance one team should get the pig's skin into the opposing teams end 
of the field a strange and bizzare ritual occurs.  First the pig is thrown as
hard as possible into the ground where it doesn't stay. Instead it bounces 
madly across the field and forgotten.  Sometimes this step is replaced by the
team member dancing with the pig's skin held high in the air and running 
towards other team members.  Step two is the same in both cases.  The men all
rush together and hug each other and pat each other vigorously on the bottom. 
The coach of the team will hug his co-coaches and smile with admiration.  
Step three consists of a replay of the whole event for television viewers 
and those advertisers who want to know who should endorse their products for 
next year.

The purpose of winning the game is that these goal scorers from the winning 
team only will be asked to advertise for the corporations. The losers will 
not be invitied.

When the game is over the wining team will pour cheap champagne all over each 
other in the dressing room where women reporters will not be admitted, but the 
men will undress in front of the television cameras anyway.  The cameras will
show the losing team crying in their locker room. The most endorsable 
player will be chosen just in case the advertisers could not figure out which 
player this should be.
    
This my friend is a United States dream come true.

A new sales assistant was hired at a large dept. store.  On his first day, the
sales manager took him around to show him the ropes.  They were passing by
the gardening section, when they heard a customer asking for grass seed.
The sales manager stepped in.

SM: Excuse me, but will you be needing a hose to water your lawn? 

C : I guess so. I'll take one.

SM: And how about some fertilizer and weed-killer ? 

C : Um, okay. 

SM: Here's a couple of bags. You'll also need a lawn mower to cut the grass
    when it starts growing too long.

C : I'll take one of those too.

After the customer left, the sales manager turned to the assistant. "You see?" 
he said, "that's the way to make a good sale.  Always sell more than what
the customer originally came in for."

Impressed, the assistant headed off for the pharmaceutical section, where
he was to work.  Soon, a man strolled in.      

MAN: I'd like to buy a pack of Tampax, please.

SA : Sure, and would you like to buy a lawn mower too?

MAN: Why would I want to do that?

SA : Well, your weekend's shot to hell anyway, so you might as well mow the
lawn.

April 1, 1988:   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered
by physicists at Turgid University.  The element, tentatively named
Administratium (Ad), has no protons or electrons, which means that its atomic
number is 0.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron,
75 vice-neutrons, and 111 assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives it an 
atomic mass number of 312.  The 312 particles are held together in the nucleus
by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called 
memoons.

	Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be
dectected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which it is
present.  According to Dr. M. Langour, one of the discoverers of the element, a
very small amount of Administratium made one reaction that normally takes less
than a second take over four days.

	Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which
 time it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in
which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the
vice-neutrons exchange places.  Some studies have indicated that the atomic
mass number actually increases after each reorganization.

	Administratium was discovered by accident when Dr. Languor angrily
resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped all of his
papers into the intake hatch of the university's particle accelerator. 
"Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports, grant forms, etc. with
the particles in the accelerator created the new element."  Dr. Langour 
explained.

	Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium
might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist, 
Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university campuses,
near the best-appointed and best-maintained buildings.

Late one night, little Johnny woke up to the some loud
noises coming from his parents bedroom.  He got out of
bed and walked down the hall towards his parents room.
Before he made it to the end of the hall, the noises
had ceased and the bathroom light had gone on.  Little
Johnny walked into the bathroom and saw his father
removing a used condom.

"Daddy, what are you doing?" asked little Johnny.

His father looked around nervously wondering what
he could tell his son.

I, um, I'm just checking out the bathroom for mice."
replied his father.

Johnny looked at his father with a gaze of confusion
and said, "Well, what are you doing?  Fucking them?"

  Three English gentlemen, all properly attired, were sitting in a train
  compartment while traveling thru the English countryside.  All three busily
  engrossed in reading their London Times.  Naturally, not having been
  properly introduced, they did not speak to each other.  The quiet in the
  compartment was disturbing.

  Finally, one gentleman, put his paper down and declared, (in your best
  veddy veddy British accent), "Sir James Hyde-White, here.  Brigadier,
  retired.  Oxford, '59.  Married.  Two sons, both Royal Marine officers," and 
  promptly went back to reading his paper. 

  A short while later, the second gentleman put down his paper and declared,
  (again, in very upper class british accent), "Sir Jonathen Colin-Simpson,
  here.  Brigadier, retired.  Eton, '61.  Married.  Two sons, both Royal Air
  Force pilots," and he promptly went back to reading his paper.  
  
  A few miles down the track, the third gentleman put down his paper and 
  stated, (now use your best irish-cockney accent), "Ian McTavish 'ere.
  Sergeant Major, retired.  Coldstream Guards.  Not married.  Two sons.
  Both Brigadiers."

Question:  What does friendship among Soviet nationalities mean?
Answer:	   It means that the Armenians take the Russians by the hand; the
	   Russians take the Ukrainians by the hand; the Ukranians
	   take the Uzbeks by the hand; and they all go and beat up
	   the Jews.

Question:  What's meant by an exchange opinions in the Communist
	   party of the Soviet Union?
Answer:	   It's when I come to a party meeting with my own opinion,
	   and I leave with the party's.

==============================

  Three prison inmates were locked in the same cell; they soon bagan
talking.
  "What are you here for?" asked one inmate of another.
  "They put me in for beating up some old Jew named Khaimovich,"
snarled one man.
  "And why are you here?" asked the second of the first.
  "For having defended some old Jew named Khaimovich in a fight," he
replied.
  "And what were you arrested for?" the third inmate was asked.
  "For being Khaimovich," he sighed.

A tourist in a strange town notices that her watch is broken. She starts
looking for a repair shop. After a long and frustrating search she
finds herself in an area where many shop signs are in Hebrew. Finally,
she notices that one of the stores has all kinds of clocks and watches
ticking merrily in the window. She walks into the shop and puts her watch
on the counter in front of the proprietor.

Tourist: "would you please repair this watch."

T: "But why not? It is an ordinary model"

     There once was five year old boy who enjoyed playing with his

door listening to the boy play.  She was shocked when she heard him
saying,

"All right, all of you son of a bitches who want to get on the train, get
on train.  And all of you son of a bitches who want to get off the
train, get off the train.  And all of you son of a bitches who want to
change seats, change seats now 'cause the trains getting ready to
leave.  Whoo whooooo."

     The mother was just devastated, so she scolded her son and said to him,

"Now son, I want to go upstairs and take your nap, and when you get up,
you can't play with your train set for two hours."

     So the boy took his nap and didn't even mention his train set for
two hours.  After the two hours were up, the boy asked his mom if he
could play with his train set again.  She said yes, and asked him if he
understood why he was punished.  He nodded his head yes, and off he
went.  The mother stood by door to listen to what her son would say.
The boy sat down to his train set and calmly said,

"Whoo whoooooo.  All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get on the
train, get on the train.  All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to
get off the train, get off the train.  And all you son of a bitches who
are pissed 'cause the train is two hours late, go talk to the bitch in

	From this I learn patience; a moral clear:
	Count -- one two three -- and wait for my love's call.

	She is unique -- no copy can be made.
	The look of her sweet eyes, the feel of her
	Soft hands, ne'er from my memory shall fade.
	Because of these, all others I abjure.

	And in the evenings of those days we meet,
	With ling'ring taste of apple bathed in stream
	I spread myself within my lonely sheet.
	Of music -- jazz and symphony -- I dream.

	I shift and enter, escape and return.
	For to do else would her sweet program spurn.

			THE RULES (*)

For those of you who don't already know, these are the rules that are in
effect in every relationship.

1.  The female always makes the rules.

2.  These rules are subject to change at any time without prior
    notification.

3.  No male can possibly know all the rules.
    ----------------------------------------

4.  If the female suspects that the male knows all the rules, she must
    immediately change some or all of the rules.

5.  The female is never wrong.
    --------------------------

6.  If the female is wrong it is because of a vagrant misunderstanding
    which was a direct result of something the male said or did wrong.

7.  If rule number six applies, the male must immediately apologize for
    causing the misunderstanding.

8.  The female can change her mind at any given point in time.

9.  The male must never change his mind without express written consent of
    the female.

10. The female has every right to be angry or upset at any time.

11. The male must remain calm at all times, unless the female wants him to
    be angry or upset.

12. The female must under no circumstances let the male know whether she
    wants him to be calm, angry or upset.

13. Any attempt to document these rules could result in bodily harm.

14. The female always gets the last word!

(*) These rules are subject to change as the female sees fit.

One girl was having terrible difficulties figuring out what kind of cell
she was seeing under her microscope--eventually she called over the

He came over, smirked, and exclaimed (loud enough for everyone to hear)
"Oh wow! That's a sperm cell!"

GIVE YOURSELVES A HAND

excerpted from 

"Kids Who Eat Paste"

performed by 

The Brunching Shuttlecocks

written by

Lore "Cosmic Slug" Shoberg


Scene:	A podium, with the Presidential Seal and a few
 	microphones on it.  BARBARA BUSH is standing
	at the podium as lights come up.

BARB:	Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the press.  As you know,
	I have recently replaced Nancy Reagan as First Lady
	and role model for the youth of today.  Because of this,
	many people have been asking me, "Barbara, what do
	you have to say to contemperary teenagers?  Nancy
	had `Just Say No,' what message do you have?"  Well,
	"No" is such a. . .negative word.  I'd rather give kids
	"dos" than "dont's".  Do recognize your right to pleasure,
	but do protect yourselves from all the horrible things that
	can happen to you.  In short, DO whack off.
		I think that it's high time the people of America
	realized what a boon jerking off can be!  And not just
	children, either.  Why, when George wants some nookie,
	and I don't, he just turns over and slips himself the
	four-fingered practice tunnel, and our problem is solved.
		It's so easy, and people should realize that solo sex 
	is the safest sex.  Next time you feel like consorting with
	someone of questionable sexual background, just pop
	into the nearest bathroom, pull down your pants or
	pull up your skirt, and do some exploring, and in no time
	you'll be satisfied!
		I just want to say: boys, choke that chicken!  Girls,
	shake hands with that pink satin ski slope!  In short,
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!

	(A banner unfolds behind her, reading "Masturbators
	 of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!"  A ROCKER jumps
	on from offstage, dressed like a conservative middle-aged
	woman might imagine the average rock star to look like,
	i.e. combining Heavy Metal, Punk, and Top Forty in a
	thouroghly atrocious style.  He sings the following song.)

ROCKER:	You don't need to use a condom
	You don't need a dental dam
	You don't need to say "I Love You" or "Here's Fifty Dollars, Ma'am."
	Don't need to spring for dinner,
	Or wear all that sexy stuff
	All you need's a set of fingers and a wanker or a muff
	'Cause everybody's doin' it, all across the land
	Masturbators Of America, Give Yourselves A Hand!

	It's natural, and organic
	It's easy and it's fun
	If you don't know how to do it ask your parents how it's done
	You don't need a special licence
	You don't need a special skill
	Just unzip and slip your grip between your hips and get a thrill
	'Cause everybody's doin' it, and boy does it feel grand,
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourselves a Hand!

	(Musical bridge, with lots of suggestive dance moves on the
	ROCKER'S part.  For instance, he does that one bit where you jump 
	backwards on one leg while playing air guitar, except that
	instead of playing air guitar he's stroking air wanker.)

	You can do it in the bathroom
	You can do it in your bed
	You can do it at a concert while you watch the Grateful Dead
	You can rub it with some lotion
	You can stroke it with a cloth
	Arnold Shwartzenegger pounds it, Michael Jackson jacks it off
	Your attitude will soften, your horizons will expand.
	Masturbators of America, Give Yourself a Hand


Lights go down as ROCKER bows to the audience.

                                                         dream(1l)



NAME
     dream - suspend execution for an interval while executing
             random code in memory

SYNTAX
     dream [-d][[-nrRsw] [time]]

DESCRIPTION
     Dream suspends execution of the current proces for time
     seconds, while simulating a dream sequence by executing random 
     segments of code in memory.  All devices are paralyzed (blocked)
     to prevent dangerous side-effects.  The options are as follows:

     -d    daydream.  code seems to be more related to the actual
           suspended process, and suspension will be for a limited
           amount of time.  Attention can be restored by snapping
           fingers next to keyboard.

     -n    nightmare.  Repeated references to the system error logs
           are made during execution.

     -r    recurring.  The code of a previous execution will be
           re-selected for this dream.

     -R    REM (Rapid Eye Movement).  The current value of the PC is
           is flashed on the screen for every instruction.

     -s    sleepwalking.  Tape drives will be sent many alternating
           fast-forward and rewind requests and/or line printers sent
           many alternating carraige-return and tab codes to promote
           movement of machine(s) across floor.  Stopping these
           devices may confuse the program.

     -w    wet dream.  The code is selected from the sex(1l) program.

     Dream will invoke automatically with the -d option when the
     system proves extremely slow.

     The relation of the randomly-executed code to the subconcious
     (background tasks) of the current processes is suspected but has
     not been proven.

WARNING
     do not select the -w option without covering the keyboard.

I've got this compilation of variations on the "My Dog's Got no Nose"
joke, which I thought you might like to use in rec.humor.funny.  I have
read your list of submission guidelines, and I know that you don't like
people to submit groups of jokes all at once, *but* ...  Well, when you
have read through these, you will realise that a lot of them don't make
sense out of context.

You will be glad to see that these are all fully attributed.  Mike Taylor
is me, Andy Charles, Andreas Pagel and Mike Lessacher are friends, and
Andy Clews is a systems administrator I happen to be in email contact
with, due to him liking the original MDGNN compendium, (which consisted
basically of the first fourteen of these).  You should know that this
subset of the following was posted to eunet.jokes, about 18 months ago,
but that otherwise, these are all completely new.

I hope you can use these, then.  Keep up the good work with the group!

			(Andy Clews)

1st Circumlocutionist:  I have in my possession an animal belonging to
	the family Canidae, and it appears that he does not possess any
	extra-facial olfactory organs.
2nd Circumlocutionist: Could you therefore impart to me such knowledge as
	may be necessary to describe how that animal circumvents the problem
	of satisfying his olfactory senses?
1st Circumlocutionist: Unfortunately the non-ambiguity of your enquiry does
	not easily permit me to provide a clever answer, but I am in fact
	thinking of referring the animal to an olfactologist. However, the
	animal does have a fairly unpleasant body odour, should you be
	interested.
