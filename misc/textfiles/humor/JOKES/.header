<H1>Humor Files: Jokes and Shaggy Dog Stories</H1>
<P>
If a joke is funny, it gets spread. If a person gets a bunch of jokes, they tack
them together and they get spread. And if a subject happens (a scandal, a tragedy,
an election) then the jokes about that event get tacked together and spread as
well. 
<P>
What you end up with, then, are these massive files of very disparate joke clusters,
bound only because someone thought they were funny or someone had a thing for 
light-bulb jokes. Therefore, there are probably tons of doubles and triples and
what have you in this collection, and there's just not enough time in the day to
sort them. So this whole directory is a bit of a crapshoot. On the other hand,
it IS funny.
