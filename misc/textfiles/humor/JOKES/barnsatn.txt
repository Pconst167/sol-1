        Barney, the cute purple dinosaur, is Satan.

Proof:

        Given: Barney is a cute purple dinosaur.

        Extract the Roman numerals:
        (and remember that the Romans had no letter 'U',
         they used 'V' instead)

        CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR
        CV    V  L  DI    V

        Add them:
        100 + 5 + 5 + 50 + 500 + 1 + 5 = 666


        Q. E. D.  We suspected it all along.
