(Heard from a friend in New York in about 1970.)

When Lyndon Johnson was running for congress he called
his opponent a "pig fucker."

Lyndon's campaign manager said, "Lyndon, you know he doesn't do that!"

Johnson replied, "I know that, but I want to make him deny it."

A Scotsman was sick and in hospital. His doctors were afraid that
this was to be the end of him since nothing they did could do anything
to make him healthy. His physician asked him if there was anything
that he could do to make him more comfortable in his final hours.
The Scot replied, "If I could only hear the pipes one more time it would
make me very happy." So the doctor arranged for a piper to come into the
room and play for the dying man.

When the Scot heard the pipes the color came back into his cheeks, his
eyes became bright, his breathing was easier, and he got up and danced
around the room. He was completely cured! Later, while recounting the
tale to his fellows over lunch the doctor confessed that this was a
miracle cure that he couldn't explain. When the pipes began to play
the Scotsman was cured. The only problem he could see was that 2
Englishmen in for checkups died.

      A nice young worker from Australia Post ( yes they do exist ), was sorting
through her regular envelopes, when she discovered a letter addressed as 
follows:

         GOD
	 c/o Heaven

      Upon opening the envelope, a letter enclosed told of how a little old
lady who had never asked for anything in her life, was desperately in need of 
$100 and was wondering if God could send her the money.

      Well the young lady was deeply touched and made a collection from her 
fellow workmates and collected $90 and sent it off to the old lady.  A few
weeks later another letter arrived addressed to God, so the young lady opened
it and it read "Thank you for the money, God, I deeply appreciate it, however
I only received $90.  It must have been those bastards at the Post Office."

Well, if Brad can read this, according to my understanding of the
laws down here, you will win a law suit for libel and defamation of
character.  Under these circumstances, since JEDR's attacks on your
character have injured your corporate image, I would seriously

Has anyone called Brad up at LGS for a rebuttal of U. Waterloo's action?

Even though he has no net access, he should be given some sort of path
to comment on U. Waterloo's inappropriate actions.

BTW, I agree with Gene.  Something should be done with an *educational*

First let me say that I am as offended and outraged as any of us over this
sorry state of affairs.  I volunteered ssbn some time back and offered to
pay the LD to hook up looking again because I feared the situation would
deteriorate as it has done.

Brad very graciously and thoughtfully replied and essentially told me
to "cool it", I might do more harm than good.  I wish I had saved the
note but he asked me not to.  I shall attempt a very poor paraphrase
of what he said.  I'm sure it won't be as accurate but you'll get the
drift and I think that's what's important here.

First my own thoughts, then essentially what Brad said.  I think that the
folks at watmath caved in to a misinformed public opinion made up by an
ignorant news media.  I honestly believe that if you could wring the truth
out of them that they are really on Brad's side.  Obviously we can't
wring the truth out of them because it would leak to the media and further
inflame what they are trying to extinguish.  It appears to us like they
have just completed the character assasination started by JEDR and others.
I'm sure that this appearance grieves and angers them as much as it does
us.  They are an educational institution and when nonsense like this
appears to dilute or pollute their primary function they have to stick by
their priorities.  Their priorities even if that means doing something that
isn't what you or I (or they) might think is "right".  An unpleasant but very
real situation and decision.  We're all faced with them from time to time.

Sorry for that, I promised to share Brad's feelings.  First off I think
that he should get a round of applause from us for being so level headed
about this.  He pointed out that the netters know more about the situation
and the culture of usenet than anyone involved.  The situation is so
ridiculous that it provokes us to outrage and cry vengeance.  This behavior
on our part, how ever justified, is perceived by the outside world to be
precisely what JEDR claims, i.e. we (inadvertantly) confirm his story and
vouch for his credibility.  The operative word there is "perceived".
Regardless of how well intentioned, morally correct, or justifiably
indignant we might be, that's how it's perceived outside our own community.
In short, we're hurting him by trying to help.  I must very reluctantly
agree with Brad and concede that while it's wrong, it's that way :-( :-(

As dearly as I'd love to fry the people who started this I will not further
their cause by doing so.  BTW, the :-('s are mine, they conclude what Brad
said last week.  Gene Spafford pleaded with us for moderation and asked us
all to shut up and let this blow over, he is correct too.  With great
reluctance I will do that (in a few sentences :-) and find something to do
with my outrage...  an obscure part of the Hippocratic commitment is
"Prima non nocere", First do no harm.  I propose that we treat JEDR and
the prepetrators of this atrocity like the pariahs that they are, but not
try to exact vengeance on others who got swept up in it. *NOW* I'll shut up.

Apologies to Gene Smith, his just happened to be the article that suggested
precisely what Brad doesn't want.

Earlier today I posted a plea for moderation in this ridiculous
(and outrageous) matter.  That was essentially asking us to all
shut up.  So here, on the heels of asking everyone to shut up,
yet another article.  I want to reach the people who are still
reading about this, the admins and readers.  What I am going to
describe is completely speculation on my part, I have nothing
to confirm what I'm describing.

The earlier post asked that we not inadvertantly injure Brad and
or his situation by raving or threatening retaliation.  I will
propose a more sinister but entirely possible scenario which may
even be true.

Fact:  JEDR and Brad have been conspicuously silent lately.
Fact:  Someone posted a few days ago suggesting that if a
       situation got too far out of hand that legal remedies
       could be pursued.

Speculation:  Maybe legal remedies are being pursued and that's
       why neither party has anything to say.  Further, if that
       is the case we might be doing a severe disservice to what
       ever side we favor by caterwauling about one or the other.
       Wouldn't you feel like an utter fool if the article you
       posted turned out to be the legal evidence that caused
       the remedy to not go in the direction you supported?

I do not want to sound like you're being read your rights but if the
speculation happens to be accurate then we might be hoist by our own
petard making threatening or damaging remarks.  I'm not proposing that
we shut down the discussion, but I am asking that we be very careful
to not provide any fuel for the fire that exists or for another that
we don't even know about.  I don't think the speculation is too far
fetched or I wouldn't have asked for your time to read it.

  +  "Even I Hate My Guts!"  To prove it, Geraldo goes under local
      anesthetic and provides controversial commentary as surgeons
      remove his large and small intestines.

  +  "Nose for News"  Geraldo challenges Morton Downey, Jr. to break his
      nose, too.

  +  "Sirhan Sirhan Is Innocent!"  Geraldo blows the lid off the Robert
      Kennedy assassination coverup by proving that only people with
      three names can be infamous killers, e.g. Lee Harvey Oswald,
      James Earl Ray, Mark David Chapman, John Wayne Gacy, etc.

      Using this theory, Geraldo identifies three potential culprits:
      Sandra Day O'Connor, David Lee Roth and Sammy Davis, Jr.

Subject: A young JEDR woman gets married...
Keywords: sexual, ethnic, chuckle

{ed  A "JEDR" (pronounced "Jedder") is a generic member of a lampooned
  identifiable group.  It stands for "Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race" and
  can refer to members of any such group, and others. This acronym does
  not refer to any specific person or group. }

Well, a young JEDR woman got married, you see, and as is traditional
with JEDR custom, she was a virgin and new nothing of the ways of
Luv.

On her wedding night, she ran downstairs to her mother and cried,
"Momma, momma, what do I do?"

Her mother replied, "Don't you worry, girl. Just lie back and enjoy
yourself."

So the girl went back upstairs to where her husband was waiting.
When she entered the room, she found that he'd removed his shirt,
and his arms and chest were very broad, and very hairy.

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta BIG HAIRY CHEST!"

Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta a
big hairy chest, that just mean he gotta BIIIIG love muscle. You
go back uppa there and have a good time."

So back up the stairs she went. This time, when she entered the room,
her husband had removed his trousers, and she saw his strong, muscly,
hairy legs.

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta THICK HAIRY LEGS!!" 

Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta
thick hairy legs, that just mean he gotta LARGE junket pump. You
go back uppa there and lie down and enjoy yourself."

So back up she goes. As she enters the room, she sees his feet for
the first time - and one of them is half missing!

She ran screaming back down the stairs.
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta FOOT AND A HALF!!"

Her mother rushed upstairs with the words, "Outa my way, girl.
This is a job for your momma!"

(Told to me by my girlfriend, who was told by a young JEDR girl.)

			   Airplane Humor
			   -------------

	Question: What separates flight attendants from the scum of the earth?

	Answer:	  The cockpit door.


Pilot's bumper sticker:

		Don't tell my mother I'm an airline pilot. She thinks 
		I'm a piano player in a whore house.

	
Heard from the flight attendant:

	"Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until the captain
	has come to a complete stop. We don't want you arriving at the gate
	before the plane does."	


[ It's my opinion that "Please remain seated until the airplane has arrived
at the gate" are the 11 most ignored words in the English language. - ed ]

(I hope these aren't too offensive.  Perhaps they should be rotated.)

(1) A person belonging to an ethnic group whose members are commonly
considered to have certain stereotypical mannerisms met another
person belonging to a different ethnic group with a different set
of imputed stereotypical mannerisms.  The first person acted in
a manner consistent with the stereotypes associated with his ethnic
group, and proceeded to make a remark which might be considered
to establish conclusively his membership in that group, whereupon his
companion proceeded to make a remark with a double meaning, the first
meaning of which could be interpreted to indicate his agreement with
his companion, but the other meaning of which serves to corroborate his
membership in his particular ethnic group.  The first person took
offense at his remark, and reacted in a stereotypical way!

(2) Q:  How many people belonging to a certain ethnic group does it take
to perform a particular menial activity?
    A:  A finite positive integer.  One to perform the activity, and the
rest to behave in a manner stereotypical of their ethnic group!

    A Russian man loses his pet parrot.  He looks everywhere, all around the 
neighbourhood, in the park, everywhere.  He just can't find the parrot.  
Finally, he goes around to the local KGB office, and tells the desk officer 
his problem.  

    The desk officer is a little puzzled.  "Look comrade, I'm sorry you lost 
your pet, but this is the KGB.  We don't handle missing animal reports."

    "Oh, I know that", says the man.  "I just wanted you to know, if you do
happen to find my parrot -- I don't know where he could have picked up his 
political ideas."
