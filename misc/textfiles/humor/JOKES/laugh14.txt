A woman went to the pet shop and looked at a parrot. She
asked the shop owner, "Is he smart?"

"Is he smart, lady?  Does a bear sh*t in the woods?
This bird is so smart he speaks six languages!"

So she bought him and brought him home.

She had to go out, but her husband came home.  Seeing that she
had spent all of the grocery money on this parrot, and there was
no food in the house, the husband - who was starving -
strangled the bird, plucked it, cleaned it, and cooked it.
When his wife came home, dinner was served.

She screamed, "How could you do this?"

To which he replied, "Hey,we gotta eat!"

She said, "This bird was brilliant!  He spoke six languages!"

To which he said, "Oh yeah? If he was so fu*king smart, why
didn't he say something?"

In the mid-sixties, there was a hippy named Benny in San Francisco.
Benny was real hip, but he just couldn't grow a beard like the rest of
the flower child guys in Haight-Ashbury (Hashbury).
One day Benny met up with a Gypsy Lady who liked him enough to grant him
a wish, so, naturally, Benny wished for a beard.  Gypsy Lady granted the
wish but warned Benny to ALWAYS wear the beard, never cut it off.
Well, the years went by, the flower children aged, the hippoy movement
sorta died out, Benny went on to a career as a successful financial
adviser.  Benny decided the beard no longer fit his image so, ignoring
the Gypsy Lady's warnings, he shaved it off.  **POOF** Benny
disintegrated into a pile of ashes, the janitor swept him up and
deposited him in a jar.

Moral of the story: A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.

Tillie and Millie, two old girl friends, met for lunch. "I married a
wealthy clothing manufacturer," announced Tillie, "and he bought me a
yacht for my birthday."

"Astounding!" said Millie.

"I have charge accounts in all the department stores," said Tillie.

"'Astounding!" said Millie.

"I have a drawer full of rubies and emeralds and my husband bought me a
twenty five carat diamond ring for our second anniversary," said Tillie.

"Astounding!" said Millie.

"Enough about me," said Tillie, "What have you been doing?"

"Oh," answered Millie, "I'm going to charm school."

"Really, what did you learn there?" asked Tillie.

"Well, for one thing, they taught me to say 'astounding'
instead of 'bullsh*t'," replied Millie.

Mrs. Markowitz was walking along the beach with her grandson when
suddenly a wave came and washed the three year old boy out to sea.

"Oh, Lord!" cried the women. "If you will just bring that boy back
alive I'll do anything! I'll be the best person! I'll give
to charity! I'll go to temple! Please, God! Send him back!"

At that moment, a wave washed the child back up on the sand, safe and
sound. His grandmother looked at the boy and then up to the Heavens.

"Okay!" she exclaimed, "So where's his hat?"

A famous lawyer died and, unexpectedly, showed up at the Pearly Gates.
St. Peter came out to welcome him, and as the Gates opened the lawyer saw
a banner which welcomed him, the first 457-year old man.  The lawyer was
confused.  He said to St. Peter, "I don't understand.  When I died, I was
63 years old, not 457."  St. Peter was now confused, and said, "Why, you
must be 457 years old! We added up all the hours you billed your clients,
so you've got to be 457!"

This guy walks into an opthamologist's office with a violin case.  He
waits for his appointment and is shown into the doctor's office.

The doctor asks, "What seems to be the problem?"

The guy replies, "Well . . . it's this," pointing to the violin case
that he has placed on the doctor's desk.

The doctor says, "It's a violin case -- so what?"

The guy says, "Open it."

The doctor does so and reels back in shock.  Inside the case is a
single HUGE turd - filling the entire case.

The doctor loses his professional demeanor and begins to tell the guy
off. "You FILTHY DISGUSTING...!" at which point the guy interupts and
says, "I did that myself."

The doctor, trying to be professional, says, "Well, you should see
your family doctor about it. There's nothing I can do."

The guy replies, "No, no, you don't understand.  Every time I do
one of those, my eyes water."

                           THE NEW PRIEST

   A new priest at his first mass was so scared, he could
   hardly speak. After the Mass was over he asked the
   Monsignor how he'd done? The Monsignor said fine, but
   next time it might help if you put some gin or vodka
   in your glass to help relax you. The next Sunday the
   priest put some vodka in his glass and really talked
   up a storm. After the Mass he asked the Monsignor how
   he'd done? The Monsignor says fine but there are
   a few things we need to get straightened out:

   1) There are 10 commandments not 12
   2) There are 12 disciples not 10
   3) David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him
   4) We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.
   5) Next Sunday there is a taffy pulling contest at St.
      Peters, not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's
   6) The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost are not referred to as
      Big Daddy, Junior, and The Spook
   7) They crucified Jesus, they didn't nail his ass to the cross

A man was out driving when he saw a police car in his rear-view mirror,
with it's siren wailing. The man pulled over and the police car stopped
behind him. The policeman approached the man's car and said to the man:
"Do you know that your wife fell out of the car five miles back?"

The man replied: "Oh thank God! I thought I had gone deaf!"

      SITUATION ADAPTABILITY EVALUATION FOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

  This test has been designed to evaluate reactions of management personnel
to various situations.  The situations are based on actual case studies
from a well known educational institution and represent a cross-section of
test data correlated to evaluate both reaction time to difficult situations
as well as the soundness of each decision selected.

  There are 8 multiple choice questions.  Read each question thoroughly.
Place an "X" by the answer you feel is most correctly justified by the
circumstances given.  Be prepared to justify your decision.

                       You have 4 minutes

          (Do not turn this page until told to do so)

(1) You have prepared a proposal for the regional director of
    purchasing of your largest customer.  The success of this
    presentation will mean increasing your sales to his company
    by 200%.  In the middle of your proposal the customer leans
    over to look at your report and spits into your coffee. You:

    _____(a)  Tell him you prefer your coffee black.

    _____(b)  Ask to have him checked for any communicable diseases.

    _____(c)  Take a leak in his "out" basket.

(2) You are having lunch with a prospective customer talking
    about what could be your biggest sale of the year. During
    the conversation a blonde walks into the restaurant and
    she is so stunning you draw your companion's attention to
    her and give a vivid description of what you would do if you
    had her alone in your motel. She walks over to the table and
    introduces herself as your client's daughter. Your next move
    is to:

    _____(a)  Ask for her hand in marriage.

    _____(b)  Pretend you've forgotten how to speak English.

    _____(c)  Repeat the conversation to the daughter and just hope
              for the best.

(3)  You are making a sales presentation to a group of corporate
     executives in the plushest office you've ever seen.  The hot
     enchilada casserole and egg salad sandwich you had for lunch
     react, creating severe pressure.  Your sphincter loses its
     control and you break wind in a most convincing manner causing
     3 water tumblers to shatter and a secretary to pass out. What
     you should do next is:

    _____(a)  Offer to come back next week when the smell has
              gone away.

    _____(b)  Point out their chief executive and accuse him of
              the offense.

    _____(c)  Challenge anyone in the room to do better.

(4)  You are at a business lunch when you are suddenly overcome
     with an uncontrollable desire to pick your nose.  Remembering
     this is definitely a No-No, you:

    _____(a)  Pretend to wave to someone across the room and with
              one fluid motion, bury your finger in your nostril
              right up to the 4th joint.

    _____(b)  Get everyone drunk and organize a nose picking
              contest with a prize to the one who makes his
              nose bleed first.

    _____(c)  Drop your napkin on the floor and when you bend
              over to pick it up, blow your nose on your sock.

(5)  You've just spent the evening with a supplier who invited
     you to an all night boilermaker drinking party. You get
     home just in time to go to work. You stagger to the men's
     room and spend the next half hour vomiting. As you're
     washing up at the sink, the sales training director walks
     up, blows cigar smoke in your face, and asks you to join
     him for a drink after work.  You:

    _____(a)  Look him straight in the eye and launch one last
              convulsive torrent at the front of his Hart
              Schaffner & Marx suit.

    _____(b)  Nail him right in the crotch, banking on the fact
              that he'll never recognize your green face.

    _____(c)  Grasp his hand and pump it till he wetss in his pants.

(6)  You are at dinner with a customer and his wife, who looks
     like the regional runner-up in the Lassie look-a-like
     contest. Halfway through dinner you feel a hand on your lap.
     If you are resourceful you will:

    _____(a)  Accidently spill hot coffee in your lap.

    _____(b)  Slip a note to the waiter to have your customer
              paged and see if the hand goes away when he does.

    _____(c)  Excuse yourself and go to the men's room. If he
              follows, don't come out until you have a signed order.

(7)  You're on your way to see your best account when your zipper
     breaks and you discover that you forgot to put on your
     underpants that morning. You decide to:

    _____(a)  Call on the customer's secretary instead.

    _____(b)  Explain that you were just trolling for queers.

    _____(c)  Buy a baggy raincoat and head for the school
              playground.

(8)  You've just returned from a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin
     in January and tell your boss that nobody but whores and
     football players live there. He mentions that his wife is
     from Green Bay. You:

    _____(a)  Ask what position she played.

    _____(b)  Ask if she's still working the streets.

    _____(c)  Pretend you're suffering amnesia and don't
              remember your own name.

Leroy, a local football star, is jogging down the street when he sees
a building on fire.  A lady is standing on a third-storey ledge holding
her pet cat in her arms.

     "Hey, lady," yells Leroy, "Throw me the cat."
     "No," she cries, "It's too far."
     "I play football, I can catch him."

The smoke is pouring from the windows, and finally, the woman waves to
Leroy, kisses her cat good-bye, and tosses it down to the street.
Leroy keeps his eye on the cat as it comes hurtling down toward him.
The feline bounces off an awning and Leroy runs into the street
to catch it.  He jumps six feet into the air and makes a spectacular
one-handed catch.  The crowd that has gathered to watch the fire
breaks into cheers.

Leroy does a little dance, lifts the cat above his head, wiggles his
knees back and forth, then spikes the cat into the pavement.

It seems that a young man who came from a wealthy family was going off
to college.   Now Dad,  who was no slouch,  knew that the young rascal
would  probably just use all his money to booze it up and go after the
girls  (since this is what he himself had done).   In order to prevent
this,   he  presented  his son with a fur coat  which  contained  nine
million,  nine hundred ninety-nine thousand,  nine hundred ninety-nine
hairs.  And he said to his son, he said, "Son, I want you to have this
coat,  and to take very good care of it, because it contains 9,999,999
hairs.    If  there are still 9,999,999 hairs when you  graduate  from
school in 4 years, I'll give you a million dollars and set you up in a
job for life."  Well,  the son thought this sounded pretty good, so he
took his Dad up on it.   While he was a freshman, he counted the hairs
twice  a  semester:  9,999,999 hairs each time.   Over the  summer  he
counted them again: 9,999,999 hairs.   Sophomore year he counted those
9,999,999  hairs  every month,  and every month there  were  9,999,999
hairs.   Junior year, he was at it every week: 9,999,999 hairs.   Week
after  week  after  week:  9,999,999 hairs.   By senior  year  he  was
counting them every day: 9,999,999 hairs.   Skipping classes for those
9,999,999 hairs.   Well, by the time graduation rolled around, he felt
like he'd counted those 9,999,999 hairs about 9,999,999 times,  but he
kept  right on counting.   As soon as he finished with those 9,999,999
hairs,  he'd count them again:  9,999,999 hairs.   On the night before
graduation, he stayed up all night counting: 9,999,999 hairs.  Finally
the big day arrived, and Dad came to see Junior.  "Well, son, have you
got  those 9,999,999 hairs still intact?"   asked the old man.   "Yes,
Dad,   all 9,999,999 hairs are there!"   So they started to count them
together.   And there were 9,999,998 hairs!   The son couldn't believe
it.   They counted again:  9,999,998 hairs.   And the son sat down and
cried,  his whole future shot (since he'd gotten straight D's from all
the classes he'd skipped).  And as the son was sitting there, a little
moth flew out of the coat,  the same moth who'd eaten that 9,999,999th
hair.    And the moth felt so bad about what he'd done that he started
to cry too.

Have you ever seen a moth bawl?

A  lawyer and his brother, a doctor, were hunting.  A mountain lion
jumped out in front of them and started snarling.

The doctor asked, "What should we do?"

The lawyer said, "I'm gonna run for it!"

The doctor replied, "You can't outrun a mountain lion!"

The lawyer said, "I don't have to outrun HIM - I only have to
outrun YOU!"

A man had a weird illness.  Whenever he broke wind, it made the sound
"Honda".  He asked his doctor about it but the doctor (after months of
tests and literature-reading) could not figure it out. Finally, just
before he was about to give up, he had an idea! "I'll call the Honda
Company in Japan and ask the company doctor!"  Well, he called the
Japanese doctor and was told by him to see if the patient had an
abscess in his teeth somewhere.  Sure enough, there was, and when it
was treated the other affliction ended!  When the doctor asked his
Japanese counterpart how he could make such a great diagnosis over
the phone from such a long distance away the man replied:

"Simple. Abscess makes a fart go Honda."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So this guy is in a bar....  and he gets kinda drunk, and says to the
bartender, "Well, I saaaagunna tell a Polish joke...."

The bartender says to the man, "Pssst!  Hey buddy, you see that guy
there across the room? He's 6'2, 195 lbs, he's Polish. You see that
guy over next to the darts?  He's 6'4, 220 lbs, and he's Polish.
You see that guy over there? He's 6'3, 325 lbs, and HE's Polish!!"

The man hiccups, looks thoughtful for a moment, then replies, "I only
wanted to tell the joke once, ya know..."

An old lady, who lived on the third floor of a boardinghouse
fell and broke her leg. As the doctor put a cast on it, he
warned her not to climb any stairs.

   Several months later, the doctor took off the cast.

   "Can I climb stairs now?" asked the little old lady.

   "Yes," he replied.

   "Thank goodness!" she said.  "I'm sick and tired of shinnying
   up and down that drainpipe!"

   Lem and Clem stood by a car in which they had locked the key.
   "Why don't we get a coat hanger to open it" Lem asked.
   "No," answered Clem.  "People will think we're trying to break in."
   Lem said, "What if we use a pocket knife to cut around the rubber,
   then stick a finger in and pull up the lock?"
   "No," said Clem.  "People will think we're too dumb to use a coat
   hanger.
   "Well," sighed Lem,  "we'd better think of something fast.  It's
   starting to rain and the sun roof is open!"

   My doctor gives X-rays for any complaint.  If you have a cough, he'll
X-ray your throat;  a cramp calls for a body X-ray.  I was in his office
the other day and I saw a nude man in his X-ray room.  I said, "What's
the matter with you?"

   The nude man said, "I don't know.  I just came in to drop off the
mail."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many many years ago when I was twenty three,
I got married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Who had hair of red.
My father fell in love with her,
And soon the two were wed.

This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life.
My daughter was my mother,
For she was my father's wife.

To complicate the matters worse,
Although it brought me joy,
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy.

My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad.
And so became my uncle,
Though it made me very sad.

For if he was my uncle,
Then that also made him brother
To the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother.

Father's wife then had a son,
Who kept them on the run.
And he became my grandson,
For he was my daughter's son.

My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue.
Because, although she is my wife,
She's my grandmother too.

If my wife is my grandmother,
Then I am her grandchild.
And every time I think of it,
It simply drives me wild.

For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw.
As the husband of my grandmother,
I am my own grandpa!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know you're a redneck if your most successful pick-up

You know you're a redneck if your daughter gets married
and all the wedding guests sit on the same side of the church.

                         NEW SOFTWARE ANNOUNCEMENT

                        PC WIFE for Dos and Windows

    For the truly lonely and scandalously ugly men with no chance of
    ever finding the real thing.

                       NOTICE! This is not Freeware!

Manual and Quick Reference Guide

 From the time you load this software, you are required to cash your pay-
 check and send the entire amount to the address listed. We will send back
 the money we think you will need each week.

 Before installing,  read all instructions in this manual and make several
 back up copies of the original disks.   This software has caused hardware
 damage in some machines with short-tempered users.

 This  software,  like many others,  is claimed to work with Windows.   It
 might. It might not.  If it doesn't, it is your fault.  Buy a better com-
 puter next time!

RUNNING PC WIFE

 Okay you lovebirds, dim the lights and open that bottle of champagne. In-
 sert  the install disk (disk 1) into one of the floppy drives (A  or  B).
 At the C:  prompt,  type A: or B: install.  You will notice a faint smell
 of perfume,  a soft moaning sound,  and the room may feel warm.   You may
 feel slight dizziness and a lack of good judgement.  Don't worry. This is
 normal.

 At  this point an introduction screen will appear on the monitor.   Press
 enter.   You will now be asked a few simple questions like  those  listed
 below.  Please consider your answers carefully.

    1. Are you married?
    2. Do you have any children?
    3. Have you been married before?
    4. How much money do you make? Alot?
    5. Do you want to have children?
    6. What time do you get home from work?

 No answer is wrong.  Remember, this is for losers.   The program will ad-
 just  for any combination of answers.  Once you have answered  all  2,486
 questions,  the  program  will automatically begin.   The  computer  must
 remain on at all times.  An Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) would be a
 good addition to your equipment for full enjoyment.

HOW IT WORKS

 There are several programs and files that are used in the operation of PC
 WIFE.  Do not delete any of these files.

 README.DOC- Who does? You might want to read this six months from now.

 PISS.EXE-   Timed program, runs every afternoon.

 MOAN.DAT-   Data file used with PISS.EXE.

 PMS.COM-    Program runs once a month, however, can also run at any
             time, or not at all.  (Do whatever it instructs!)

 WENCH.EXE-  Program runs when requested.  You may have to request this
             several times to get it to run.  Begging may help.

 BITCH.EXE-  Program will run sooner or later. Be patient. Negative
             feedback aggravates the program.
             Note: Runs more frequently if you drink or are late from
                   work, or if you are late in complying with any
                   PC WIFE request.

 BITCH.DAT-  Data file used with BITCH.EXE.

 CLEAN.EXE-  Merely a reminder program with a handy "clean the house" pop-
             up menu.  Failure to follow instructions given carefully will
             result in more frequent executions of BITCH.EXE.  Frequent
             running of BITCH.EXE could cause more frequent action of
             PMS.COM.  This is not a preferred situation.

 MIL.EXE-    A mother-in-law simulation program creates a noise similar
             to a parrot with its foot hung.  Running of other programs in
             PC WIFE not complying with requests in a timely manner will
             determine duration and volume of program execution.

 DINNER.EXE- A handy reminder program consisting of phone numbers for
             pizza delivery (or fine dining establishments).

SECRET FILES

 There are many hidden files in PC WIFE.   If you are lucky,  and  blessed
 with quick reflexes, you will not endure the wrath of these files.

REMINDER

 Sign the enclosed Warranty Death Beneficiary Registration Card before in-
 stalling this software.   Mail card and first paycheck 10 days before in-
 stallation of program.

REMOVING PC WIFE

 Once PC WIFE has been running five minutes,  it will be in complete  con-
 trol  of your house,  car,  and life.  If for any reason you are  unhappy
 with your PC WIFE, there is only one way to loosen its hold on you.  Upon
 receipt of all deeds,  bank account holdings and titles,  legally  signed
 over to our company,  we will gladly terminate 90% of PC WIFE  functions.
 If  at any time a check for 75% of your earnings is more than  five  days
 late in arriving, PC WIFE will be reinstated with all hidden files on ac-
 tivated status.

DISCLAIMER

 The makers of PC WIFE hold no responsibility for damage,  medical  costs,
 loss of sanity,  financial ruin, or any other potentially adverse effects
 from running this software.

    Thank you very much for your purchase and continued support.

 friends with 2 am feeding wails and gurgles that last well past dawn!

 As if that wasn't enough, slimy drool and vile-smelling,  green glop will
 spurt from your floppy drives many times during the next 18 years.   Yes,

 night!   Simulated  trips  to hospital emergency  rooms!   Report  cards!
 Calls from the principal!  PTA meetings!  And when your PC CHILD turns 16
 years old,  you'd better buy a new car,  because your child will be DRIV-
 ING!   Yes, DRIVING!  AND getting in car wrecks on the average of twice a
 month!  Watch your insurance rates climb!

 And the fun goes on and on and on.   We can't tell you everything.   That
 wouldn't  be any fun,  would it?   But we suggest you start bugging  your
 computer retailer now for PC CHILD.  Your PC WIFE will want one every two
 or three years, and you don't want to make her angry!  Trust us.

      The dumb blonde was invited on an outing so she decided
      to shop for some luggage. She asked the clerk, "Do you have
      any overnight cases?"

      "Yes'm," he said.

      "You'd better give me seven of them, then. I'll be gone a week."

A sensational new shortstop was being interviewed by the press.
The trouble was, the guy spoke so quietly no one could hear him.
One of them finally asked the coach, "What's the matter with him?"
"Nothing at all," replied the coach.  "That's just the way the
rookie mumbles."

   A father took his young son to the opera for the first time.
The conductor started waving the baton, and the soprano began her
aria.  The boy watched everything intently and finally asked:
"Why is he hitting her with his stick?"

   "He's not hitting her," answered the father with a chuckle.

   "Well, then," asked the boy, "why is she screaming?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A man walked up to a vending machine, put in a coin, and pressed
the button labeled, "Coffee, double cream, sugar."  No cup appeared.
Then two nozzles went into action, one sending forth coffee, the
other, cream.  After the proper amounts had gone down the drain
where the cup should have been, the machine turned off.  "Now that's
real automation," the man exclaimed.  "This thing even drinks it for
you!"

What do you do with a dog with no arms and no legs?

How many Republicans does it take to change a light bulb?

Seventeen. One talks in Congress for 5 hours about how the lack of family
values in this country symbolizes the burning out of a light bulb. Two more
rant and rave about how it was the Democrat's fault that the light bulb
burned out in the first place. Three more talk in hushed whispers about how
this whole light bulb thing could escalate into something soon. Two more
are about to change the light bulb, but decide instead to attend a
fund-raising dinner. And the rest spend the remainder of the week forming a
Congressional Light-Bulb Fixing Task Force.

Nobody, of course, ever gets around to changing the light bulb...

 TOP TEN TREK TRANSPORTER MALFUNCTION EPISODES WE HAVEN'T SEEN (YET):

 10.An AWAY team disappears and the mystery isn't solved until it
    is discovered that Ensign Scott, who entered the coordinates
    into the transporter, is dyslexic.
 9. During an ion storm, Worf is beamed up but finds himself a
    long time ago in a galaxy far, far away---"Star Worf."
 8. Worf is accidentally beamed through an improbability field and
    turns into a bowl of petunias. Troi can sense only one thought
    from him (which also happens to be the episode title): "Oh No,
    Not Again."
 7. A short circuit causes the transporter system to shrink the AWAY
    team to microscopic size and be transported into Geordi's visor --
    "A Beam in Geordi's Eye."
 6. Static interference with the transporter system causes the AWAY
    team to instantly age 50 years. Since de-aging people is now
    standard procedure of the Enterprise, this episode is fixed before
    the credits start. The rest of the episode consists of a
    discussion on why shields always fail--"Staff Meeting."
 5. A subspace disturbance affects the transporter, causing a genetic
    alteration in Captain Picard which makes his nose grow even
    longer--"Picarnocchio."
 4. While testing a new transporter system, O'Brian doesn't notice
    a fly on the transporter pad with him. The Enterprise is then
    boarded by a horde of copyright lawyers.
 3. A power surge as Data is being beamed sends him back to 1985 on
    Earth. It also short circuits his positronic circuits, so he believes
    that he must kill a woman named Sarah Conner--"Termidata."
 2. Data, Troi, and Riker have their signals scrambled together by a
    computer error and become one being: A logical first officer
    with psychic power--"Mindmeld."

 AND THE NUMBER ONE TRANSPORTER MALFUNCTION EPISODE WE HAVEN'T SEEN (YET):

 1. Troi and Worf are beaming up from a planet when an ionic pulse
    disrupts the beam. Troi is okay, but Worf is split into seven small,
    bearded men, each with a diffrent dominant trait--"Troi White and
    the Seven Worfs."

 TOP TEN REASONS FOR WHY Q AND AMANDA LOOKED SO LARGE RELATIVE TO THE
 ENTERPRISE:

 10. The Walt Disney reason: It's a small ship after all.
  9. The George Bush reason: It's the fault of the Democrats in
     Congress.
  8. The Bill Clinton reason: I didn't see the episode. If I did see it
     it was only once, and I didn't notice anything wrong with it.
  7. The "Dallas" reason: Dr. Crusher is dreaming this whole season.
  6. The Monty Python reason: It's only a model.
  5. The Oliver Stone Reason: Ask yourself, qui bono? Who benefits
     if TNG's special effects aren't good? Babylon 5, that's who,
     and the CIA, and the Mafia, and the Illuminati.
  4. Bill Clinton reason: I knew all along there was something wrong
     with the proportion. And it's not surprising, after 12 years of
     Reaganomics.
  3. Some unexplained reason: John DeLancia and Olivia D'Abo are
     big stars.
  2. The Rick Moranis reason: Honey, I shrunk the ship. Or is it,
     Honey, I blew up the Qs.

 AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR WHY Q AND AMANDA LOOKED SO LARGE RELATIVE
 TO THE ENTERPRISE:

  1. The H. Ross Perot reason: It's irrelavant. Let's try to keep
     things in perspective, okay? Can we focus on the issues for
     just a moment here? While you've been reading this list, the
     deficit's grown by another 430 million quatlons.

Surprised while burgling a house in Antwerp, Belgium, a thief
fled out the back door, clambered over a nine-foot wall, dropped
down and found himself in the city prison.

**********************************************************************

In 1976 a twenty-two-year-old Irishman, Bob Finnegan, was crossing the
busy Falls Road in Belfast, when he was struck by a taxi and flung over
its roof. The taxi drove away and, as Finnegan lay stunned in the road,
another car ran into him, rolling him into the gutter. It too drove on.
As a knot of gawkers gathered to examine tha magnetic Irishman, a
delivery van plowed through the crowd, leaving in its wake three injured
bystanders and an even more battered Bob Finnegan. When a fourth vehicle
came along, the crowd wisely scattered and only one person was hit - Bob
Finnegan. In the space of two minutes Finnegan suffered a fractured
skull, broken pelvis, broken leg, and other assorted injuries. Hospital
officials said he would recover.

***********************************************************************

While motorcycling through the Hungarian countryside, Cristo Falatti
came up to a railway line just as the crossing gates were coming down.
While he sat idling, he was joined by a farmer with a goat, which the
farmer tehered to the crossing gate. A few moments later a horse and
cart drew up behind Falatti, followed in short order by a man in a
sports car. When the train roared through the crossing, the horse
startled and bit Falatti on the arm. Not a man to be trifled with,
Falatti responded by punching the horse in the head. In consequence
the horse's owner jumped down from his cart and began scuffling with
the motorcyclist. The horse, which was not up to this sort of excite-
ment, backed away briskly, smashing the cart into the sports-car. At
this, the sports-car driver leaped out of his car and joined the fray.
The farmer came forward to try to pacify the three flailing men. As he
did so, the crossing gates rose and his goat was strangled. At last
report the insurance companies were still trying to sort out the claims.

Two West German motorists had an all-too-literal head-on collision in
heavy fog near the small town of Guetersloh. Each was guiding his car
at a snail's pace near the center of the road. At the moment of impact
their heads were both out of the windows when they smacked together.
Both men were hospitalized with severe head injuries. Their cars weren't
scratched.

************************************************************************

In a classic case of one thing leading to another, seven men aged
eighteen to twenty-nine received jail sentences of three to four
years in Kingston-on-Thames, England, in 1979 after a fight that
started when one of the men threw a french fry at another while
they stood waiting for a train.

Hitting on the novel idea that he could end his wife's incessant
nagging by giving her a good scare, Hungarian Jake Fen built an
elaborate harness to make it look as if he had hanged himself.
When his wife came home and saw him she fainted. Hearing a distur-
bance a neighbor came over and, finding what she thought were two
corpses, seized the opportunity to loot the place. As she was
leaving the room, her arms laden, the outraged and suspended Mr Fen
kicked her stoutly in the backside. This so surprised the lady that
she dropped dead of a heart attack. Happily, Mr Fen was acquitted of
manslaughter and he and his wife were reconciled.

An unidentified English woman, according to the London Sunday Express
was climbing into the bathtub one afternoon when she remembered she
had left some muffins in the oven. Naked, she dashed downstairs and
was removing the muffins when she heard a noise at the door. Thinking
it was the baker, and knowing he would come in and leave a loaf of
bread on the kitchen table if she didn't answer his knock, the woman
darted into the broom cupboard. A few moments later she heard the back
door open and, to her eternal mortification, the sound of footsteps
coming toward the cupboard. It was the man from the gas company, come
to read the meter. "Oh," stammered the woman, "I was expecting the
baker." The gas man blinked, excused himself and departed.

    There was this guy who went to Spain.  One day, he goes over to
the bullfights and watches as the bullfighter kills the bull. After that
afternoon of excitement, he gets hungry and goes over to a cafe right next
to the arena of the bullfight.  There he looks at the menu, and orders
the special, "Meatballs."  The waiter comes out with 2 huge meatballs
and the guy eagerly eats it.  The bull fight was so interesting, he came
back the next day and went over to the cafe again to have the delicious
meatballs.  This continued on for 5 or so days, until the guy goes to the
cafe and the waiter comes out with 2 dinky little balls.

    "What's wrong with the meatballs? Why are they so small?" asks the
    man.

    "Well, Senor, sometimes dee bull weens," said the waiter.

Subject: Real Programmers
-
Real Programmers don't eat quiche.
In Fact, real programmers can't even spell quiche. They eat Twinkies,
Szechwan [sic] food, and drink Pabst.
-
Real Programmers don't write specs.
Users should consider themselves lucky to get any programs that work at
all -- and take what they get.
-
Real Programmers don't comment their code.
If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.
-
Real Programmers don't write application programs.
They program right down on the bare metal. Application programming is for
accounting feebs who can't do systems programming.
-
Real Programmers don't write COBOL.
COBOL is for wimpy application programmers.
-
Real Programmers don't write FORTRAN.
FORTRAN is for pipe stress freaks and cyrstallography weenies.
-
Real Programmers don't write in BASIC. Actually, no programmers write in
BASIC after the age of 12.
-
Real Programmers don't write in PL/1.
PL/1 is for those twinks who can't decide whether to write in FORTRAN or
COBOL.
-
Real Programmers don't write in PASCAL, or BLISS, or ADA, or C, or any of
those pinko computer science languages.
Strong typing is for people with weak memories.
-
Real Programmers' programs never work right the first time.
But if real programmers can get their supervisor to throw them on the
machine and everyone else off, their programs can be patched into working
in 'only a few' 30 hour debugging sessions.
-
Real Programmers don't document.
Documentation is for simps who can't read the listings or the object deck.
-
Real Programmers don't play tennis, or racket ball, or any other sport
that requires them to change clothes.  Mountain climbing is OK, and real
programmers will wear their climbing boots to work in case a mountain
should suddenly spring up in the middle of the machine room.
-
Real Programmers don't work 9 to 5.
If any real programmers are around at 9 AM, it's because they were there
all night

Two girls were roommates.

One evening, Millie came running in, shedding clothes on the
way to the bathroom.

She yelled, "Hurry up Tillie, get ready for our date!"

Tillie didn't know anything about the date and said so.

Millie explained that she'd met two really great looking
guys and had made dates for both of them for that evening.

Tillie said, "I'm not going out on any more blind dates."

"Why not?"

"They're always the same," said Tillie, "It's sex, sex, sex!
Nothing but a pain in the ass!"

Millie looked at her in disbelief and exclaimed, "Honey,
you're doing it wrong!"

DEAR (Your Choice)

I have been watching you very closely to see if you have been good this
year, and if you are, I will have some special treats for you this year at
XMAS.

I cannot promise you all the gifts from the twelve days of XMAS this year
as the twelve fiddlers have all come down with the clap from fiddling with
the ten ladies dancing. The eleven lords a-leaping have knocked up the
eight maids a-milking, and the nine pipers piping have been arrested for
doing weird things with the seven swans a-swiming. The six geese alaying,
four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves, and that damn
partridge in the pear tree have me up to my ass in bird shit.

On top of that, Mrs. Claus is going through menopause, eight of my reinder
are in heat, the elves have joined the Gay Liberation Front, and those
stupid polacks have scheduled Xmas for 5 February.

SANTA

      Soon after the Texas Aggie clocked in for work, the foreman
called him over and told him that he had a phone call in the
front office. When the Aggie returned, he had a mournful
expression on his face and his head hyng low. His foreman
noticed and asked if he had recieved bad news.
    "Shure was Boss" he replied, "I just found out that my mother
died earlier this morning. "Gosh, thats awful," replied the foreman
"Do you want the rest of the day off?"
      "No," replied the Aggie. "I'll finish the day out."
      About an hour later, the foreman returned to inform him that
there was another phone call for him up front. This time when the Aggie
 returned he looked twice as glum and the foreman asked if everything
 was alright. "Jezz, Boss this has to be the worst day of my life," moaned
the Aggie. "That was my brother, and his mother died today too!"

  There was this frog on a lily pad, in the middle of a pond,
surrounded by alligators. He didn't want to be eaten but he couldn't
think of a way to get to edge of the pond without being gobbled up.
Then, as he was about to give up, he looked up. Up in a tree was an owl.

  He called to the owl and asked, "Mr. Owl, I am stuck on a lily pad in
the middle of this pond, surrounded by alligators.  How can I get to the
edge of the pond without being eaten?"

  The owl looked down at the frog and said, "Well Mr. Frog, it is
obvious. You should fly off your lily pad to the edge of the pond."

  Hearing this, the frog began to flap his arms frantically.  He then
leaped into the air so as to fly to the edge of the pond. But instead he
fell right into the open mouth of a nearby alligator.

  Just before the alligator closed his mouth, the frog shouted up to the
owl in the tree, "Mr. Owl, didn't you know that frogs can't fly?"

  The owl responded, "I do concepts, not implementation."

Joe says, "Well hell, what's the matter?"

The Man says, "Well, my son has just come home from college and I found
out he's gay."

Joe says, "Man that's terrible," and gives the man his whiskey and beer.

Two weeks go by and the same man goes to the bar... He walks in and
says, "Hey Joe, how about fixing me up with 8 shots of whiskey and

Joe says, "Well hell, what's the matter this time?"

The man says, "Well my other boy just come home from college and I

Joe says, "Man, that's a damn shame," and fixes him up with
the beer and whiskey.

Three weeks go by and the man comes bursting through the doors and
says, "Joe, I want you to fix me up with every f*cking drink you got
in the house!"

Joe says, "Geez, doesn't anyone in your family love women?"

The man says, "Yeah, I just found out my wife does..."

    The dare devil stunt woman had lost her balance.  The psychiatrist

    "Tell me about your work," he said.  "What do you do?"

    "Well," said the stunt woman, "I jump off cliffs, I wrestle
     man-eating lions, I swim under water for fifteen minutes at a
     time and jump out of moving helicopters."

A priest was called away for an emergency.  Not wanting to leave
the confessional unmanned, he called a rabbi friend up and asked him
to cover for him.  The rabbi told him he wouldn't know what to say, but the
priest told him to come on over and he'd stay with him and show him
what to do.  The rabbi comes and he and the priest are in the confessional.
In a few minutes a woman comes in and says "Father forgive me for I have
sinned."  The priest asks "What did you do?".  The woman says "I committed
adultery."  Priest: "How many times?"  Woman: "Three times."  Priest:
"Say two Hail Mary's, put $5 in the box and go and sin no more."  A few
minutes later another woman enters the confessional.  She says "Father
forgive me for I have sinned."  Priest: "What did you do?"  Woman: "I
committed adultery."  Priest: "How many times?"  Woman: "Three times."
Priest:  "Say two Hail Mary's, put $5 in the box and go and sin no more."
The rabbi tells the priest that he thinks he's got it so the priest leaves.
A few minutes later another woman enters and says "Father forgive me for I

There's this guy in a bar that's saying he knows everybody, and will bet
anybody on it. So this guy walks up and says, "I bet you don't know Burt
Rynolds." He says come on, they hop a plane to Florida, show up at
Burt's door and Burt says, "Hi Bubba, how have you been? Come on in!"

On the flight back home the guy says, "I'll bet you another $100 you
don't know Bill Clinton." So they catch a flight to D.C. Sure enough
the walk into the oval office and Bill says "Hi Bubba, what are you
doing here? It's real nice to see you again!"

On the flight back home he says to Bubba,"I'll bet you double or
nothing you don't know the Pope." Bubba says "Look I don't really
want to take your money, me and the Pope go back a long way.
Really, pick somebody else." Figuring he's got Bubba on this
one, he insists, so they board a plane for Rome.

When they get to Vatican City, Bubba tells the guy, "Look, they aren't
going to let you in here with me. Stand right here and in 10 minutes I'll
be on that balcony with the Pope." After a little squabble he agrees.
Sure enough 10 mins. later there's Bubba on the balcony with the Pope.

Bubba looks down to see the guy passed out on the ground. He runs down
to see what's wrong and the guy says, "OK, you know Burt Rynolds, you know
the President, but when the guy behind me said, 'Hey, who's that guy up
there with Bubba' I passed out!"

A rancher owned 900 cows and three bulls. The biggest bull had 500 cows,
the middle bull 300 and the smallest had 100.
One day they overheard the rancher talking about getting a new bull. The
biggest bull said, "I ain't giving up any of mine, so you two be ready to
lose some of yours." The middle one said he wasn't giving up any, and so
did the smallest bull.

Several days later, a cattle truck pulled into the pasture and stopped.
Right away it began shaking and rocking until the entire rear came flying
off and our roared the biggest, meanest brama bull ever seen.

The three bulls looked at it in amazement and the big bull said, "Oh heck,
I may be willing to share some of my cows." The middle bull agreed.

The smallest bull began pawing the ground and snorting. The biggest bull
looked at him and said, "Are you crazy? look at the size of that sucker!"

The small bull answered, "I don't want to fight him. I just want to make
sure he knows I'm not a cow!"

Israeli yelled out: "Hey Abdul, are you there?" On the Arab side, Abdul
stood up and said "Yeah?" The Israelis took out their machine guns and
mowed down Abdul.

The second night, another Israeli yelled out, "Hey Mohammed, are you
there?" On the Arab side, Mohammed stood up and said "Yeah?" The
Israelis took out their machine guns and mowed down Mohammed.

On the third night, the Arabs got smart. One of them yelled "Hey Moshe,
are you there?" The Israelis yelled back, "No, Moshe isn't here but is
that you, Achmed?" Achmed stood up and said "Yeah?" and the Israelis
took out the machine guns and mowed down Achmed.

Drinkwiski is working at the lumberyard pushing a tree through the buzz
saw when he accidentally shears off all ten of his fingers. He goes to
the emergency room. The doctor takes a look and goes, "Yuck! Well, give
me the fingers and I'll see what I can do." Drinkwiski says, "I haven't
got the fingers. "

The doctor says, "What do you mean, you haven't got the fingers? Its 1993!
We've got microsurgery and all kinds of incredible techniques! We could
have put them back on and made you like new! WHY didnt you bring the
fingers???"

Drinkwiski says, "Well, geez doc, I couldnt pick 'em up."
