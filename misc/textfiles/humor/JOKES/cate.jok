      An American, an Englishman and a Japanese fellow were discussing
  their respective countries over drink at a London pub one evening.
      The English fellow mentioned how that British medicine had
  progressed so far that doctors recently had taken a single liver and
  cut it into six pieces then transplanted it into six separate men
  in need of a healthy liver. This had resulted in six new workers
  in the job market.
      At this, the Japanese guy said that in his country doctors had
  cut a lung into twelve pieces, transplanted these into twelve people
  in need of healthy lungs, thereby putting twelve new people in the
  job market.
      Not to be outdone, the American said "That's nothing. In the
  U.S. we took one asshole, made it President, and now there are
  10 million people in the market for a job."

A political activist named Dave was just arriving in Hell, and was told
he had a choice to make. He could go to Capitalist Hell or to Communist
Hell. Naturally, Dave wanted to compare the two, so he wandered over to
Capitalist Hell. There outside the door was Adam Smith, looking bored.
"What's it like in there?" asked Dave.

"Well," replied Adam, "In Capitalist Hell, they flay you alive, boil
you in oil, chain you to a rock and let a vulture tear your liver out,
and cut you up into small pieces with sharp knives."

"That's terrible!!" gasped Dave. "I'm going to check out Communist
Hell!" He went over to Communist Hell, where he discovered a huge line
of people waiting to get in; the line circled around the lobby seven
times before receding off into the horizon.

Dave pushed his way through to the head of the line, where he found
Karl Marx busily signing people in. Dave asked Karl what Communist Hell
was like.

"In Communist Hell," said Marx impatiently, "they flay you alive, boil
you in oil, chain you to a rock and let vultures tear out your liver,
and cut you up into small pieces with sharp knives."

"But ... but that's the same as Capitalist Hell!" protested Dave.

"True," sighed Marx, "but sometimes we don't have oil, sometimes we
don't have knives ..."

        There is a man in a casino gambling with lots of "borrowed" money and a
fairy comes and sits on his shoulder. He's playing pontoon and gets dealt a
seven. The fairy advises him to buy a card for 500 pounds. Naturally he doesn't
trust the fairy, but he decides to buy one anyway. He gets a five giving him
twelve. The fairy then advises him to buy another card for 500 pounds. This
time he does and gets a three. "Buy another for 500 pounds," says the fairy.
This time he gets a five so he's got twenty with four cards.  The fairy tells
him to buy another for 500 pounds. He thinks to himself that the fairy's been
right so far, so he complies. He gets dealt an ace.  The fairy falls off his
shoulder crying, "You lucky bastard!"

There was a businessman, and he was feeling really crook, and he  went
to  see the Doctor about it.  The doctor says to him "Well, it must be

actually,  i only eat peas, i hate all other green foods".  The doctor
was quite shocked at this and says "Well man, that's your problem, all
those  peas  will be clogging up your system, you'll have to give them
up!!".  The guy says "But how long for, i mean i  really  like  peas!"
and  the  doctor  replies  "Forever,  i'm  afraid".   The man is quite
shocked by this, but he gives it a go and sure enough,  his  condition
improves,  so he realises that he will never eat a pea again.  Anyway,
one night, years later, he's at a  convention  for  his  employer  and

game of golf in 3 years, because it cost me my first  marriage,  so  i
gave  it  up!"  and the businessman says "Thas nuvving, i haven't ad a
pea in 6 years" and the barman jumps up screaming  "Ok,  everyone  who
can't swim, grab a table...."

A rich American tourist was holidaying in Rome, and was intent
on seeing the Pope. There he was stood in a big long queue with
a rather expensive suit on - hoping the Pope would notice how 
smart he was and perhaps talk a few words with him.

As the Pope made his way slowly down the queue, he walked right
passed the American, hardly even noticing him. The Pope then stopped
next to a tramp, leaned over and whispered something in the tramp's
ear, and made his way on again.

This pisses-off the American and so agrees to pay 1000 dollars to
the tramp in exchange for his suit, in the hope that the Pope will
speak to him the next day.

The next morning the American is stood in the queue, waiting to see
the Pope and hopefully exchange a few words. The Pope was making
his way slowly up to the American, and when he finally reached him,
leaned over to the American and spoke softly into his hear, saying:

"I thought I told you to fuck off."

it Lord?".
Just as he reaches the top, a roman soldier lashes out and chops his right
arm off, then kicks him all the way back to the bottom.

After several minutes, Jesus moans again: "Peter... Peter...".

Peter quickly runs up the hill, saying "Yes Lord, what's the matter Lord?",

"Peter... Peter... I can see your house from here... "

two  figures  in  his  path rolling around  in the  middle  of  the  road. 
The driver blew his  horn and braked frantically, but the couple continued

Fried representative offers to make a large contribution to the catholic
church.
The pope once again considers the proposal and rejects it. The Kentucky
Fried rep now proposes to feed the starving millions and make an even
larger contribution to the church. Now the pope is interested but
that he must get the approval of the Vatican council first.

Cheer Up... Here's Your Horrorscope

AQUARIUS: January 20 - February 18
        You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be progressive. You
lie a great deal. On the other hand, you are inclined to be careless and
impractical, which causes you to make the same mistake over and over again.
People think you are stupid.

PISCES: February 19 - March 20
        You have a vivid imagination and often think you are being followed by
the CIA or FBI. You have a minor influence over your associates and people
resent you for flaunting it at peers. You lack confidence and are generally
a coward. Pisces people do horrible things to small animals.

ARIES: March 21 - April 19
        You are the pioneer type and hold most people in contempt. You are
quick-tempered, impatient and scornful of advice. You are not very nice.

TAURUS: April 20 - May 20
        You are practical and persistent. You have a dogged determination and
work like hell. Most people think you are stubborn and bull-headed. You are
a communist.

GEMINI: May 21 - June 20
        You are a quick and intelligent thinker. People like you because you
are bisexual. However, you are inclined to expect too much for too little.
This means you are cheap. Geminis are known for committing incest.

CANCER June 21 - July 22
        You are sympathetic and understanding toward other people's problems.
They think you are a sucker. You're always putting things off. That's why
you'll never make anything of yourself. Most welfare recipients are Cancers.

LEO: July 23 - August 22
        You consider yourself a born leader. Others think you are pushy. Most
Leos are bullies. You are vain and dislike honest criticism. Your arrogance
is disgusting. Leos are known thieves.

VIRGO: August 23 - September 22
        You are the logical type and hate disorder. This nit-picking is
sickening to your friends. You are cold and unemotional and sometimes fall
asleep while making love. Virgos make good bus drivers.

LIBRA: September 23 - October 22
        You are the artistic type and have a difficult time with reality.
Chances for employment and monetary gain are excellent. Most Libra women make
good prostitutes. All Libra die of veneral disease.

SCORPIO: October 23 - November 21
        You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted. You achieve the
pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics. Most Scorpios are
murdered.

SAGITARIUS: November 22 - December 21
        You are optimistic and enthusiastic. You have a reckless tendancy to
rely on luck, since you lack talent. The majority of Sagitarians are drunks
or dope fiends. People laugh at you a great deal.

CAPRICORN: December 23 - January 19
        You are conservative and afraid of taking risks. You don't do much of
anything and are lazy. There has never been born a Capricorn of any importance.
Capricorns should avoid standing still too long, as they tend to root.

A businessman  called home, at noon one day,  but the maid answered.  When 
the man asked to  speak to his wife,  the maid replied, "She's upstairs in 
the bedroom entertaining  her boyfriend".  After sputtering and fuming for 
a minute,  the businessman  asked, the  maid if  she would  like  to  make 
$100,000 for a few minutes work, she said.  "Of course,  what do I have to 
do?", He answered, "Take my shotgun from the  closet and shoot the both of 
them.", The phone was put down,  he heard footsteps  proceeding  upstairs, 
then two shots  rang out,  followed by  footsteps  back  downstairs to the 
phone.  The maid said, "Okay, it's done. What shall I do with the bodies?" 
The man said,  "Take them out back and throw them into the pool", The maid 
responded, "What pool?"  After  a moment of silence, he said,  "Isn't this 
555-3724?"

There were two young brothers talking in their backyard waiting for their
mother to make them lunch.  One is four the other is three.

4:  "I'm getting pretty old now, I think I can start cussing."
3:  "Oh yeah?"
4:  "Yeah, I think I am going to start saying 'damn' whenever I feel like it."
3:  "You know what?"
4:  "What?"
3:  "I think I am getting pretty old, I'm going to start cussing too."
4:  "Oh yeah? what are you going to say?"
3:  "I'm going to say 'ass'"

Then their mother calls them in for lunch.

The mother asks the four year old: "What do you want for lunch?"
4: "Oh, damn, I think I'll have some spaghetti-o's"

At this point, the mother was aghast.  She quickly took the four year old by
the ear to the bathroom, washed his mouth out with soap, spanked him and put
him in his room and slammed the door.

She returned to the kitchen and asked the three year old: "What do you want
for lunch?"

3: "I don't know mom, but you can bet your ass it wont be spaghetti-o's!!!'

During his visit to the US pope John Paul II had a meeting with a senator.

The senator asked the pope, "Your Holiness, how do you find our
country?"

The pope replied "I love it! It's a wonderful country! Friendly
people, blessed with an abundance of natural resources..." and so on and
so forth.

The senator continued, "Is there anything about our country that you
*don't* like? I am, after all a United States senator, and maybe I could
change some things."

The pope thought a while, and said "Now that you mention it, there are two
things about your country that I do not like".

The senator asked, "What are they? Maybe I can help."

The pope answered, "The first thing I don't like about your country is
the large number of Polish jokes told. They make my countrymen out to
be a bunch of idiots!"

The senator said, "I have a solution for that! When I get back to
Washington, I'll get together with some of my Senate colleagues and
we'll pass a bill, which I'm sure will become law, that will make it a
Federal crime to tell a Polish joke, and anyone caught telling a Polish
joke will be fined fifty dollars. How do you like that?"

The pope replied "Great idea! I love it!"

The senator asked "Now why don't you tell me the second thing
you don't like about the US? Maybe I can do something about it as well."

The pope answered "M & M's."

The senator, a bit confused, asked "M & M's??? What's not to like about
M & M's???"

The Pope replied "They're hard to peel!"

   A whole bunch of guys are hanging out in their usual bar after work
one day when this very attractive woman walks in and sits down right in
the midst of them. After about two minutes of amazed looks one of the
men manages to ask the woman her name.
   "Don't you recognize me guys? It's me, Bernie. I had a sex change!"
   Well, the men are all amazed at how their old drinking buddy, Bernie,
looks with all his new equipment. So they buy some more drinks and get
to talking about old times with Bernie/Bernice.
   After a few hours, the conversation rolls around to the subject of
Bernice's operation.
   So one of the guys says,"Tell me Bernice, what was the most painful
thing about the operation?  Was it when they cut your dick off?"
   Bernice says,"No. That was painful, but that wasn't the most painful
thing."
   So another guy pipes up, "I'll bet I know! I'll bet the worst
part was when they cut your balls off, right?"
   "No.", Bernice says, "That really hurt too, but that wasn't the
worst part either."
   Finally, one of the men asks, "Well, just what was the worst, most
painful part of the operation that turned you into a woman?"
   And Bernice replies, "When they cut my skull open and removed half
my brain!"

   A slightly drunk man walked into a bar, went up to the bartender,
and said, "I'll bet you $50 I can bite my right eye!"  Noticing the
man had had a few to drink, the bartender took him up on it.  The
drunk then proceded to pop out a glass eyeball, and bite it.  The
bartender paid, and the man left.

   The next day, the man returned, a little drunker than the previous
day, and he said to the bartender, "I'll bet you $50 I can bite my
left eye!"  Knowing that the man couldn't have two glass eyes, the
bartender again took him up on it.  This time, the man pulled out his
false teeth and 'bit' his eye. (Ouch!)  The bartender paid up.

   The next day, the man came in stone drunk.  He went to the
bartender and said, "I'll give you a chance to get your money back.
I'll bet you a hundred dollars that you can put a shot glass on the
other end of the bar, and I can stand on this end (20 feet away) and
piss in it, without getting a single drop outside the glass.

   The bartender just couldn't pass up the chance to get his $100
back, and the guy was very drunk, so he again took the drunk up on his
bet.  He put the shot glass on the other end of the bar, and the drunk
simply pissed all over the bar.  The bartender smiled and said, "You lost!"
The drunk just smiled and gave him the hundred dollars.

   The bartender said, "You're not too unhappy about losing all your
money.  Why not?"  The drunk exclaimed, "Because I just bet this guy
at the table $2000 I could piss all over your bar, and you wouldn't
care!"

In the old days in Finland, all young men had to go through some rites of
passage to show that they were REAL FINNISH MEN.  The usual set consisted of
three tests: 1) Empty a full bottle of vodka without pause, 2) Go out in the
forest to kill a bear with bare hands, and 3) rape a woman.
  When Pekka had reached the age of the rites of passage, he had no trouble 
at all with the vodka.  He disappeared into the forest, and came back three
days later, with clothes torn and  blood dripping from several wounds.  Then
he said: "Now where's the woman I have to kill?"

The pope died.  Like all good christians he went to heaven and knocked on
the door.  Peter opened.  The pope said: "I'm the pope."
Peter picked up the phone and rang Jesus.
"I have someone here who says he's the pope, do you know him?"
Jesus answered: "No, never heared of him, send him to hell."
Peter told the pope. "That can't be true, ring God himself," the pope said.
So Peter rang God and said: "Here's someone who says he's the pope, do you
know him?" God answered: "No, never heard of him, send him to hell."
And again Peter told the pope. "The last chance I have is the Holy Spirit,"
the pope said.  Peter rang him and said: "I have someone here who says he's
the pope, you know him?"
"Yes," he said, "I know him. He's the one who told everyone I got Maria
pregnant.  Send him to hell".

A man in a Porsche 911 stops at a stoplight and a guy on a scooter pulls up
next to him.  The guy on the scooter leans over and takes an admiring look at
the inside of the Porsche and tells the driver that he has a really hot car. 
Well, the light turned green so the driver of the Porsche decides to show off
and peels out and leaves the guy on the scooter in the dust.  Then, all of a
sudden, he sees the scooter zip on past him.  So, being a little cocky, the
Porsche driver floors it again and blows past the guy on the scooter.  A few
seconds later, he again sees the scooter zip on past him.  So now he's a little
irate as well as a little mifted that that scooter keeps passing him so he
floors it until he is going over 100 mph.  He thinks to himself that there
would be no way that scooter could catch him now, but then looks in the
rearview mirror and sees that scooter starting to catch up.  He then decides to
find out what that scooter really is and slams on his breaks.  Then the scooter
crashes into the Porsche.  After the dust settled, the Porsche driver sees the
scooter driver lying in the road and goes over to him and askes how he could
go as fast as the Porsche on a little wimpy scooter...
   The dying man replied, "I can't really, but my suspenders were caught on
your side mirror...."

	Prevent damage to garden and lawns from burrowing rodents
	with Gopher-It, the electronic stake that emits vibration

	up to 100 feet in diameter.
	Requires 4 "D" batteries, not included.

		A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS
 
1.  DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.
Involvement with the patient's suffering might cause him to lose
valuable scientific objectivity.
 
2.  BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.
Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the
gentleness and reassurance he can get.
 
3.  TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.
Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to
uphold.
 
4.  DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight
into the true nature of your illness, which transcends any
mere permanent disability you may have experienced.
 
5.  NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.
It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be
explained in terms that you would understand.
 
6.  SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT READILY.
Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting
research paper will surely be of widespread interest.
 
7.  PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.
You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly,
to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.
 
8.  DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your
means.
 
9.  NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT
    IN THE COURSE OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a
sacred duty to protect him from exposure.
 
10.  NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.
This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.

It seems that a devout, good couple was about to get married, but a
tragic car accident ended their lives.

When they got to heaven, they asked St. Peter if he could arrange for
them to be married, saying that it was what they had hoped for in
life, and they still desired wedded union.  He thought about it and
agreed, but said they would have to wait.

It was almost one hundred years later when St. Peter sent for them.
They were married in a simple ceremony.

So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in
this time, that eternity was best not spent together.

They went back to St. Peter, and said, "We thought we would be happy
forever, but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences.
Is there any way we can get divorced?"

"Are you kidding?" said St. Peter.  "It took me a hundred years to get
a priest up here to marry you.  I'll never get a lawyer!"

And the workers went unto their Supervisors and said:
"It is a pail of dung, and none may abide the odor thereof."

And the Supervisors went unto their Managers, saying:
"It is a container of excrement, and it is very strong,
such that none may abide by it."

And the Managers went unto their Directors, saying:
"It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength."

"It contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very powerful."

And the Vice Presidents went unto the President, saying unto him:
"This new plan will actively promote the growth and vigor of the
company, with powerful effects."

Sean O'Malley, a plumber by profession, was called by a lady with an
Emergency in Her Bathroom. Arriving at the scene, he turned off the
water with a sigh, and replaced the faucet washer, ending the Emergency.
The lady was nice-looking, and lonely to boot, so before long Sean was
helping her to heat up the bedroom.

About four-thirty, the telephone rang, and after she hung up, the lady
told Sean: "That was my husband. He'll be home in about half an hour,
but he'll be leaving on a business trip to Chicago this evening at
seven. Why don't you come back at about seven-thirty, and we'll continue
where we left off?"

One day, a young priest in St. John's, Newfoundland, finds himself in the
situation of having to hear confessions. He has never done this before,
and so he is given a list of what to give out as penance. A woman comes
into the confessional and begins: "Forgive me father, for I have sinned."
The priest replies: "What is your sin, my child?" "I have told lies", she
says. The priest consults his list and sees that the required penance is
two Hail Mary's. "Anything else, my child?", he says. "Father, I've committed
fellatio," she replies. The priest scans the list and panics because he
cannot find fellatio! He sticks his head out of the door of the confessional
and sees an alter boy passing by.  "Quick, what does Father Brown give for
fellatio?" he asks.  The boy replies: "Ten dollar."

Two guys were walking in the woods one day, and they all of a sudden came
across a bear. The bear noticed them, and started growling and generally
getting really mean. The bear started to chase one of the guys, who, as it
turns out, was from Czechoslovakia. The bear soon caught up with him, and
ate him alive. The other guy turned around and ran for his life.

A little while later, the second guy found a park ranger station and told
his story. The ranger took his gun, and they both went out in search of
the bear, in order to destroy it. Soon, they came across two bears, one male,
and one female. The ranger turned to the other guy and said: "Quick... tell 
me which bear ate your friend!" The ranger levelled his gun and got ready
to shoot.

"I'm not really sure," said the other guy, "they both look similar."

"QUICK! Make up your mind!" said the ranger.

"O.k.," said the other, "it was the male."

The ranger promptly aimed and shot the female bear. The male ran off.
Using his knife, the ranger cut open the belly of the female and found
the body of the other man.

"But why didn't you shoot the male when I thought it was the male who ate
my friend?" the other man asked.

"Well," said the ranger, "I never trust anyone who says that the Czech's in
the male."

Dear Son,
  I am writing this slow, 'cause I know you can't read fast.
  There are a few things happening here at home.  We don't live where we did
when you left -- you're father read in the paper that most car accidents happen
within twenty miles of home, so we moved.  I won't be able to send you the
address because we moved into your cousins old house and they took the numbers
with them so they wouldn't have to change their address.
  The new place has a washing machine!  It's in a small room that also has a
shower in it.  The first day, I put four shirts in.  I pressed the lever and I
haven't seen them since.
  The weather is nice here.  It rained twice this week.  Three days the first
time and four days the second time.
  Remember that coat you wanted me to send you?  Well, your aunt said that it
would be too heavy to send in the mail, so we cut the buttons off and put them
in the pocket.
  Monday we got a bill from the funeral home.  It said if we don't make the
last payment on Grandma's funeral ... up she comes ...
  Your father has a lovely new job.  He has over 500 men under him.  He's
cutting grass at the cemetery.
  Your brother's wife had a baby this morning.  We don't know whether it's a
boy or a girl, so we don't know if you are an aunt or an uncle.
  Your uncle fell in the whiskey vat and drowned.  We cremated him.  He burned
for 3 days.
  Last week 3 of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup truck.  One was
driving and the other two were riding in the back.  The driver rolled down the
window and swam to safety.  The other two drowned.  They couldn't get the
tailgate down.
  Not much else.  Write more often.
                                                    Love,
                                                       Mom

P.S. -- We would have sent money, but the envelope was already sealed.

There was a wealthy Jewish (non-Christian) who owned a nail company.
His only son had just graduated from college and the father wanted to
get him involved in the company.

He initially farmed the young man out to each of the departments;
first research & development, then manufacturing, then sales, and in
each the son was a dismal failure.  Determined to find a place for his
offspring, the father decided that his son needed his own project.

So the father placed his son in charge of the new advertising
campaign.  He told him that he would have no supervision and that any
and all resources which he needed would be placed at his disposal.
The son was elated and immediately set off to make his father proud.

Four weeks later the son proudly proclaimed, "I have finished!" and he
and his father went out to examine the first product of the new
campaign: a billboard.

As they drove to the sight, the son explained how he had been blocked
until a sudden insight had leaped into his head.  They turned the
corner and to the father's horror the billboard portrayed Christ on
a cross with the caption: "Even Then They Used Goldberg Nails."

The father explained to the son that they couldn't portray Christ on a
cross as it might offend their christian clients.  Dejected, the son
said that he would fix the problem and report back to his father.

One week later the son again exclaimed that he was "finished," and
took his father off to see the billboard.  Sure enough, Christ was no
longer on the cross; he was lying at the base of the cross and the
caption read:

	"This Wouldn't Happen With Goldberg Nails"

works and nobody comes to the rescue, I take these, lay out a game of

	There once was a little pink lady.  She had a little pink house and
a little pink dress and a little pink dog. This lady sold avon.
	One day the lady was walking down a street selling her avon when
she came across a little red house.  She pressed the doorbell.
	In this little red house lived a little red man.  He was having a
bath in his little red bathtub when he heard his little red doorbell ring.
	"There goes my doorbell!" he said to himself as he clambered out
of his little red bath.  He grabbed a little red towel and put it around
his waist and walked down his little red stairs to his little red door.
	But, when he opened the door, his little red towel slipped and fell
off.  The little pink lady screamed and ran out across the street.  A car
coming down the road hit her and she died.

Paddy heard that a fortune could be made by working as a lumberjack in
Canada. So, off he goes. After some weeks, he arrives at a lumberjack-camp
and asks the foreman for a job.
Foreman: "Okay sonny, but you'll have to do a test first. If you can
chop down 100 trees tomorrow you're hired".
So, next day, Paddy gets his chainsaw and happily saws away all day.
When trees are counted Paddy only has 98.....
"Oh well" says the foreman, "You'll get another chance tomorrow."
So, next day, same story, 99 trees.
"I don't believe this" says the foreman, "A big strong fella like
yourself should be able to cut down 200 trees in a day. You know what?
You get one more chance, and I'll join you to show you the trick of it".
So, next day, Paddy and the foreman go into the forest. Upon arrival
at a nice open spot the foreman puts the chainsaw on the ground,
and starts the engine.
Says Paddy: "Holy Jezus! Where's the noise coming from?"

The Pope is on his 1988 tour of America, in the middle of his 3 day bash in
New York.  On the second day, he is driving back to his motel after a heavy
days bible bashing.  It suddenly occurs to him that he is a little peckish
and so he decides to go for something to eat.  Out of the corner of his eye
he notices 'Mel's Diner' and immediately pulls over.  He hops out, kisses
the ground a couple of times and then goes in and sits down.
A sleazy waitress wanders over, notices who he is and then straightens
herself up.
"Yes you Holiness, what would you like?"
The Pope thought for a while.
"Well daughter, I have this terrible craving for a nice steak."
"Sure Mac, er I mean of course your Holiness.  Would you like it well done,
medium or rare?"
"Oh.  I think I'd like a very rare one please."
The waitress raised her arm.
"One bloody steak, Mel!" she shouted.
The Pope was horrified.
"Oh no my daughter, you musn't swear.  There is no call for it!"
"But you don't understand, father, bloody describes how you will get the
steak.  Very rare."
The Pope smiled.
"I understand.  How stupid of me."
A little later, the Pope's steak arrived and he got stuck in.  It was
gorgeous and he went to bed that night feeling satiated.
The next day, the Pope had had an even bigger God-squading session and was
helped by 31 of his cardinals. Afterwards, he called his cardinals together.
"Right Lads, as you've done a really good job today, I'll treat you to a
bit of nosh at this place I know.  You'll like it I'm sure".
So the Pope took his cardinals to the diner and sat down.  He called to
the waitress.
"Can I have 32 bloody steaks please!"
Immediately one of the cardinals slapped his knee...
"Hey yeah! And plenty of fucking chips okay? "

Three men, two Americans and an <ethnic>, are standing at the top of
Empire State Building. It is quite windy and one of the Americans say:
  "I bet the wind is so strong that if I threw myself from the

all the way back up here."
  "Yeah, whatever." says the <ethnic>.
The American throws himself from the building, and sure enough, when

"In twelve years from now, will the power in South Africa be held by white
people or by black people?"
Computer: "In year 2000 the government in South Africa will be.............

Everybody breathes, and starts drinking champagne. Nobody cares any

Then the finance minister comes and asks:

Once upon a time there was this beautiful woman who was going to
be married to this handsome very rich nobleman. So they get married
and she moves into his big castle, compared to which Camelot is
but a pigsty: hundreds of rooms it has got, over a hundred servants
and an enormous garden extending in woods in which one could easily
get lost forever, still not having left the property.
The nobleman and his wife are having a real good time at the estate,
there's fine weather, everyone's nice, business is going well.
Indeed business is ok: the nobleman has to be abroad a lot, so the
woman decides to explore the enormous castle. Strange rooms she
discovers, with lots of antiquities revealing the glorious past of
the castle; now she's to be found at the attics, then again she's
traversing the cellars, and after a few months she's almost completed
her exploration - to find what appears to be some secret room...
Its door is securely locked, and no matter where she looks: the key
is not to be found. So immediately after her husband returns from one
of his voyages, she tells him how she has explored every part of the
castle, save that little room. Just when she wants to ask if he knows
where the key might be, he gravely responds that she's not to go into
that very room lest a great danger befall her... No matter how she
begs, he won't tell her what's to be found in that malefic room...
Years go by and she's put the whole question aside, but then again
the eagerness to know is becoming unbearable... Finally she's made up
her mind to search once again for the key... Patiently she waits for
him to go on his next voyage, and immediately after he's left she
goes to the Dark Room. She's searched for the key for hours until
suddenly: behold, it was hidden behind a secret panel! A hollow sound
revealed it, when she was tapping the wood. With shaking hands she
takes the key and puts it into the lock. She turns the key once...,
twice..., thrice and click, the lock is open... The door opens creakily.
She's looking into a hostile dark nothingness. Did she hear something?
Trembling she goes inside..., step by step..., until suddenly:

	AAAAAAAAARRRRGGGGHH!!!!!!

You know what happened?
No?
Well, neither do I, but I'll let you know when I've found out.

    A guy dies and goes to Hell.  The devil greets him warmly
 at the gates of Hell, and they enter a long coridor.   As 
 they walk along, the Devil explains, " Now that you're in
 Hell, you must choose the manner in which you must spend all
 eternity.  I will show you some rooms and you must choose one."

    They get to the first room.   The door opens, and the man
 peers in.  An endless circle of the damned with weights strapped
 to their backs walk around barefoot on hot coals.  "Oh, I don't think
 I like that" said the man.  They continue to the second room.

    In the second room, the damned walk around, listening to 
 elevator muzak, walking on broken glass.  "Oh, I don't think I 
 could stand that" said the man.

    In the last room, the man was surprised to find the damned
 standing around up to their armpits in sh*t, drinking cofee.
 "That doesn't look so bad!" said the man.  "I'll stay here
 for eternity."  "Very well," said the Devil, closing the door 
 behind him.

   "Hmm... this isn't so bad" thought the man, as a Demon
 gave him a cup of coffee.  Suddenly, the room supervisor
 called out on his megaphone...

The Pope goes on a visit to S. Africa, and he is travelling along,
in his Popemobile, by the side of a large river.  Soon, he catches
sight of a black man in the river, struggling and screaming as he
tries vainly to fight off a huge crocodile.  The Pope realises that 
there is nothing he can do, when suddenly two white men leap into the
water, drag the man and the croc to land, and then beat the crocodile
to death with sticks.

The Pope is really impressed by this.  He goes over to where the two
men are standing next to the bleeding and unconscious black man and says,
"Congratulations.  That was the most wonderful thing to do, and I can
see that it is men like you who will rebuild this country as an example 
of racial harmony."

The Pope goes on his way.  One of the white men says "Who was that?", and
the other replies "That was the Pope, he is in direct communication with
God.  He knows everything."

The first man says "Maybe, but he knew no f*ck at all about Crocodile fishing!"

A bright, well-behaved little boy lived with his parents and
grandparents in suburbia. 

One evening, the boy's father passed outside his bedroom and was pleased
to hear him kneeling beside his bed saying his prayers. He finished off
with: 

   God bless mummy
   God bless daddy
   God bless grandma
   Ta ta grandpa

The father thought this form of prayer a little strange, but was so
pleased that his son was praying of his own accord, that he thought
nothing more of it. Until, that is, he woke up to find that grandpa had
passed away with a stroke during the night.

A few weeks later, he again overheard his son's prayers:

   God bless mummy
   God bless daddy
   Ta ta grandma

Sure enough, the next morning we find that the little boy's grandmother
had had a heart attack in the middle of the night and passed away peacefully.

Our father was baffled by this turn of events. Was he the father of a
strangely talented and gifted son? What could this lead to - fame,
fortune ... who knows! Our principle eavesdropper decided to listen in
on all his sons prayers from that night on, to see what other mystical
secrets might be revealed.

But our hero was not to be so well rewarded. There was nothing in his
son's prayers in the least unusual for several weeks. Then one night, he
overheard him say:

   God bless mummy
   Ta ta daddy

Our hero was stricken with grief! What had he done to deserve such a
short life! His parents had been old and withered; but he was still in
the prime of life!

So great was his turmoil, that he didn't get a wink of sleep all night.
He got up in the morning expecting disaster to strike at any time. He
drove extra carefully to work that morning, and stayed in his office all
day.

On his return home, he poured out his worries to his wife. He'd had an
awful day, greifstricken, worried, and just wanted to get it over with.
But his wife had no time for him. "You think YOU'VE had a bad day. I've
been waiting for you to get back to help me out. I've had a terrible day
today. I got up this morning and opened the front door to find the
milkman lying dead on the porch...."

Ethnic A visits the hospital.
"I want to be castrated!" he demands cheerfully.
"Are you sure about this?" the doctor asks. "Have you discussed it
with your wife?"
"Yes, yes! I've thought about this for a long time. Let's get it over with!"
So, the operation is performed. Since it's relatively simple, ethnic A does
only have to stay for two days in the hospital. On his way home, he meets
another ethnic.
"Well, hello A! I haven't seen you for a couple of days." ethnic B
says, as they shake hands.
"No, I've been to the hospital."
"Well, that's funny. I'm on my way there right now!"
"Really? So, what's up?"
"I'm going to be vaccinated."

A man took his dog into a pub, bought a pint and settled down to watch
the football on the TV set above the bar.  As luck would have it, it was
a Fulham home game.  After a one-sided match Fulham lost, and the dog
said, quite clearly, `Oh, no -- not again!'

The barman, startled, walked over to the owner and said `Did your dog
just say ``Oh, no -- not again''?'
`Yes', replied the owner blandly, `he always says that when Fulham lose.'
`What does he say when Fulham win?'
`Don't know. I've only had him five years.'

(an easy mistake to make in Farmborough anyway). The chief Zong 
greets the petrol pump.
"Greetings; I am Zong, a Zong from the planet Zong. We have come in
our spaceship, the Zong, to meet Earth people. Take me to your 
cliche" (sorry, I mean leader.)
The Zong receives no reply, so he repeats his demand using shorter
words (he has heard that this usually works in Farmborough).
"Take me to your leader".
The petrol pump, unsurprisingly, says nothing.
By now, the short-tempered captain of the Zong is getting a bit annoyed at 
being ignored. He levels his ray gun at the petrol pump, much to the 
distress of his first mate, and demands,
"TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER, INSOLENT SCUM, OR I WILL BLOW YOU TO PIECES !"
Of course, the petrol pump remains silent; his shipmates try to 
restrain him, but he fires. There is an almighty explosion as the
petrol pump bursts into a huge ball of flames and the 
crew of the Zong are hurled hundreds of yards into the air. They 
land in a nearby field with a bump.
"What the hell happened ?" shouted the Zong captain.
"I tried to warn you", replied the first mate, "You just don't mess with 
a guy who can wrap his p**** around his waist and stick it in his ear."

It was a boring Sunday afternoon in the jungle so the Elephants 
decided to challenge the Ants to a game of soccer.
The game was going well with the Elephants beating the Ants
ten goals to nil, when the Ants gained posession.
The Ants' star player was dribbling the ball towards the 
Elephants' goal mouth when the Elephants' left back came
lumbering towards him. The elephant trod on the little ant,
killing him instantly.
The referee stopped the game. "What the hell do you think
you're doing ? Do you call that sportsmanship, killing 
another player ?"
The elephant replied, "Well, I didn't mean to kill him - 
I was just trying to trip him up."

lovely brown fur; you must be a bunny rabbit.

Said Flopsy Bunny
- That's very good.  Let me see.  You have horrible scaly skin, nasty

I was driving through North Wales one day last summer, when I had
the  misfortune  to run out  of petrol  right out  in the sticks.
It was  about 5  miles to  the nearest house,  but when   I   got
there   the   farmer  who  lived  in it  was  very hospitable and
offered to drive me back to my car with a can of petrol, as  long
as I  stayed to  have a  bite to  eat first.   I accepted  grate-
fully, and  upon entering the parlour I was amazed to see  a  pig
with a wooden leg reclining in  a rocking chair, reading the "Cwm
Penmachno Evening Courier" and smoking a pipe. I asked the farmer
about   this,  and he said,  "Oh, that's a fine  pig. One day  my
wife was just driving out  of our gate  onto  the   road  when  a
bloody great  lorry which she hadn't noticed - we  tend to forget
to look  out for traffic up  here, you know - came tearing  along
and  smashed  into  the   side  of her car. The  lorry driver was
killed, and my wife was pinned into her  seat.  Some  petrol  was
leaking out of her tank,  and the pig  here could see  that there
was  a danger the  car would go up in  flames  if  he  didn't  do
something  pretty  quickly.  So he leapt over the fence, sprinted
over to the car, wrenched the door off its hinges and  pulled  my
wife away just in time to save her from a horrible death".

"My goodness,  that's  certainly a   very   fine  pig!"   I   ex-
claimed.  "Now   I  can understand why you treat him so well. But
one thing is still puzzling me -  tell me, how does he come to be
wearing that wooden leg?"

"Ah well", said the farmer, "when you've got  a pig like that you
don't want  to eat him all at once".

There is this panda walking through a red light district when he sees a
prostitute beckoning him. Feeling an urge he decides to go along with her
and she leads him upstairs where they have sex.
Half an hour later, he pulls up his boxer shorts and makes way for the door.

"Oi, you, where do you think you are going ?" cries the prostitute.
"You are supposed to pay me"

"I don't pay for my sex " replies the panda, " ..and anyway where does it say
that I am supposed to pay you anyway" 

The prostitute, hearing this, goes to a bookshelf and produces a dictionary.
"'Ere, 'ave a look at this".

The panda takes the dictionry, claws through ( pandas don't have thumbs )
comes to p.. pr.. "Here it is, prostitute, woman who gives sexual favours
for money ..."

"Aha , there it is" says the prostitute.

"Take this and look up panda" says the panda returning the dictionary.

The prostitute reads "Panda, small bear, eats shoots and leaves."

money with him." After his next move the man looks up and says , "Awh,

Anyway, Amos is getting on in years and his family decides that he is
just too much of a burden anymore.  Time to put him in a retirement
home.  So they take him out to Sunny Hills Retirement Community and
install him in his now home.
After he was there for a few hours, a lovely young nurse comes and
asks if he would like to spend a while on the sun porch.  Amos says
"Sure...hrmmmph, hrmmmph."
So Amos and the nurse are on the sun porch enjoying the sun, when Amos
begins to lean to his left.  The nurse, thinking that he is going to
fall, pushes him back upright.  A few minutes pass, and Amos again
begins to lean, this time to his right.  The nurse pushes him back
upright.  A few minutes later the scene is repeated.  Finally, the
nurse takes Amos back to his room.
The next day, Amos's friend Bob comes to visit.  "How do you like it
here?" asks Bob.
"Well" says Amos "it's OK, I guess.  The bed ain't too soft and it ain't
too hard.  The food is OK.  The people are nice.  But, they sure don't 
want you to fart on the sun porch!"

The following is a courtroom exchange between a defense attorney and
a farmer with a bodily injury claim.  It came from a Houston, Texas
insurance agent.
Attorney: "At the scene of the accident, did you tell the constable
you had never felt better in your life?"
Farmer: "That's right."
Attorney: "Well, then, how is it that you are now claiming you were
seriously injured when my client's auto hit your wagon?"
Farmer: "When the constable arrived, he went over to my horse, who
had a broken leg, and shot him.  Then he went over to Rover, my dog,
who was all banged up, and shot him.  When he asked me how I felt, I
just thought under the circumstances, it was a wise choice of words
to say I've never felt better in my life."

Three squaws were each preparing for the birth of their first child.  The
first squaw placed a large bear hide by a river, the second squaw placed
an elk hide by a tree by a river, and the third squaw placed a
hippopotamus hide by a path, near the river and the tree so that the
three formed a triangle.
   It just so happens that all three women gave birth on the same day.
The first squaw on the bear hide had a 5-lb son, the second squaw on the
elk hide had a 6-lb son, and the third squaw on the hippopotamus hide had
an 11-lb son.
   To this day, mathematicians credit these three women with the first
proof of the Pythagorean Theorem:
   "The son of the squaw of the hippopotamus is equal to the sons
    of the squaws of the two adjacent hides."

An American is visiting in France for several weeks.  As his stay nears an
end, he is sitting around with three of his new-found French friends, just
generally shooting the breeze.  The subject turns to language, and the
American says, "Guys, I do have one question left.  I keep hearing this
expression, "sang froid".  What does it mean?  I know that it literally
means, "cold blood", but what does it *mean*?"

The first Frenchman replies, "Ah, zat is easy.  Say that a man walks into
his bedroom, only to find his wife in bed with his best friend.  If he can
turn around and walk out without zem knowing he was zere, *zat* is
sang froid!"

The second Frenchman interjected, "You have eet all wrong!  If, in zis
circumstance, zee gentleman can calmly stand zere, and say "Please don't
mind me; continue", zen *zat* is sang froid!"

"Non, non, non!" burst out the third.  "If ze gentleman bursts een on his
wife and his best friend, stands there saying, "Please continue", and his
friend *can* continue, *zat* is sang froid!".

  from its cage.  He went downtown into a local bar, and said
  to the bartender, "You see that young girl at the end of 
  the bar?  If you don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat
  her up."
	The bartender hastily poured a beer and watched the
  lion swig it down and leave.
	The lion proceeded across the street to another bar.
  Again he approached the bar, and spoke to the bartender.
	"You see that girl at the end of the bar?  If you
  don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat her up."
	The bartender hastily poured the lion a beer, and
  watched as the lion gulped it down and left.
	The lion proceeded to yet another bar, went inside,
  and said to the bartender:
	"You see that young girl at the end of the bar?  If
  you don't give me a free beer, I'll go and eat her up."

	"Go ahead," said the bartender.
	So the lion went to the girl and ate her, quick as 
  a wink.
	"Now give me a beer, or I'll eat YOU up!" the lion
  roard to the bartender.
	"No you won't.  in a couple of minutes, you'll be
  out cold on the floor," said the bartender calmly.
	"Why's that?" asked the lion.
	"That wasn't an ordinary girl you ate, you dumb

A young man is on a date with a young woman and they go parking. 
After some heavy petting the young man asks the young woman for oral

After they had been dating a few months, the young man again asks the
young woman for oral sex.  Again she replies, "No, you won't respect me."

Eventually the two get married and the husband asks his bride
"Honey, please, we're married now.  You know I love you and respect
you.  Can we please have oral sex?". "No", she says "I just know
that if I do that you won't respect me."  So the man waits.

and waits... 

and waits....

After 20 years of marriage the man says, "Honey, we've been together
20 wonderful years now.  We've raised three beautiful kids.  You

scope, and starts laughing.  "What's so funny?" asks the clerk.  "I see

America, Russia and Japan are sending up a two year shuttle mission with one

shuttle to see what each astronaut got out of his personal entertainment.

holding and infant.  The crowd cheers.  The Japanese astronaut steps out and
makes a 10 minute speech in absolutely perfect Greek.  The crowd doesn't
understand a word of it, but they're impressed and they cheer.  The Russian

Everyone wondered how Reagan picked Bush for VP in the first place.
Well, this is the story:  Reagan knew he had to make a choice; so
he asked Nancy how he should do this.  Nancy told him that he should
ask the potential candidates a riddle and see how they do.  She gave
Reagan a riddle to use.

So, the next day, Reagan goes to Bush and says, "Who is it who is your
father's son, but not your brother?"  Bush replies, "Golly gee, Mr. Reagan,
That's difficult.  I'll need to go and think about that one for a while."
In the evening Bush returns and happily shouts, "I got it, Ron!  I figured
it out!  It's me!  It's me!"

Reagan than goes and presents the same riddle to one of the other VP
candidates and says, "Who is it who is your father's son, but not your
brother?"  "That's a tough one Mr. Reagan.  I'll get back to you on that."
And in the evening he returns and says, "I couldn't figure that one out.
Who is it?"

Reagan answers, "It's George Bush, but I'm not exactly sure why."

man watched the Polack do this for a minute or so, then he walked over to
him and asked, "What are you doing, if I might ask?"  And the Polack 
replied, "I'm snorting crack, of course!"

This guy, see, was walkin' down the street sportin' two -- not one, but
two -- black eyes; a coupla real shiners.  He chanced upon his buddy
walkin' th' other way and they stopped to talk.  "Hey buddy," sez his
buddy, "where'd'ja git them good lookin' shiners?  Musta been a helluva
fight."

"Well actually I got them in church," sez he.

"Nowwaitaminnit," sez his buddy, "nobody gits black eyes in church!"

"I swear I did," sez he, "and here's how it happened.
We all got up to sing a hymn, you see, and the fat lady in front of me
got her dress all stuck up in the crack of her butt, so bein' as how I'm a
real gennulman an' all, well, I leaned forward and pulled it out for her.
And you know what?  She just turned around, hauled off and slugged me one!"

"Well," sez his buddy after he can talk again, "that shore 'nuff explains
one of 'em.  Howdja git th' other one?"

"Well," sez he, "like I said, I'm a gennulman, even when somebody does me
wrong, so when I saw she didn't like it like that, I stuck it back in."

This fellow had been suffering from excruciating headaches for some
time, and finally went to a doctor.  After a thorough exam, the 
physician called the fellow into his office and said, "Well, I'm not 
exactly sure what is causing your headaches, but we've found a cure
for them:  you'll have to be castrated".  The man, needless to say, was
taken aback, and told his doctor that he believed he would try to bear
the pain.
But as time went on, the headaches only got worse, and finally, the
poor fellow was driven back to the doctor.  "All right, I guess I'll
have the operation", he said.  When it was all over, the man was 
understandably depressed, and his physician told him, "I recommend you
begin life anew - start over from this point".
So the man decided to take the advice and went to a men's shop for a
new set of clothes.  The proprietor said, "Starting with the suit, 
looks like you take about a 38-regular".  "That's right", exclaimed the 
man, "how'd you know?"  "Well, when you've been in the business
as long as I have, you get pretty good at sizing a man up", 
replied the salesman.  "Now, for a shirt, looks like about a 15 long."
"Right again," the man said.  The proprietor suggested, "And for
undershorts, I'd say a size 36."  "There's your first mistake", the
man said, "I've worn 34's for years."  "No, you're a size 36 if I've
ever seen one", said the owner.  The man replied, "I ought to know
what size undershorts I wear, and I'll take 34".  The owner replied,
"Well alright, if you insist, but they're going to pinch your balls
and give you headaches!"

There was this black woman who had 7 sons, all of them named Leroy.
One day this man was asking her about this and said, "What to you say
when you want to call one of them?"  She replies,"I just calls Leroy,
and they all come!"  The man then says, "Well what if you want one of
them to come help you with the dishes?"  She says, "I calls Leroy,
and they all come help me with the dishes."  The man, getting somewhat
frustrated, says, "What if you want to talk to one of them about bad
grades on their report card, then how do you call them?"  She says,
"Oh, then I use their last name!"

A man was trapped on a deserted island that was sinking into the sea.  As the
water lapped around his feet, a motor boat suddenly approached the island.
"Come on, man, get in!" said the boatman. 
"No," said the guy on the island, "I have faith in Jesus.  He will save me!"
The boat went off and the water continued to rise.  When it was up to the guy's
chest, another boat appeared.
"Get in the boat, or you're going to drown!" said the boatman.  Again, the guy
said, "No, I have faith in Jesus.  He will save me!"
The boat went off and the water continued to rise.  When it was up to the guy's
chin, a third boat appeared.  
"Get in, this is your last chance!"
"No, Jesus will save me!" 
So the boat went off, the water continued to rise and the guy drowned.  He went
up to heaven and was greeted by Jesus.  
"Hey, Jesus," he said, "I trusted in you all my life and you let me drown!
I don't believe it!" 
"YOU don't believe it?" Jesus said, "I sent three fucking boats to save you!!"

"Give that man five days in the brig for vomiting!"
The following morning the captain was checking the log and saw that the
young seaman had been sentenced to ten days and asked the chief mate why.
"Well, Cap'n, when we got you undressed we found that he'd also shit in
 your pants."

A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and
and steals a roast.  The butcher goes to lawyer's office and asks, "If a 
dog running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a 
right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?"  The lawyer 
answers, "Absolutely."
"Then you owe me $8.50.  Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today."
The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.50.
The next day, the butcher opens his mail and finds an envelope from the
lawyer:  $50 due for a consultation.

confessed:
  "Over the years, I haven't been completely faithful to you, but when
I did fool around, I put a soybean in the drawer to remind myself of my
indiscretion", she explained.
  The farmer admitted that he had not always been faithful either, 
and therefore, was inclined to forgive and forget a few moments of
weakness in his wife.
  "I'm curious though," he said, "Where did the thirty dollars
come from?"
  "Oh that," his wife replied, "Well, when soybeans hit ten dollars

Murphy is walking down a country lane near his home when he spies a
leprechaun sitting on a fencepost.  "Ah ha!", says he to himself, "I'll
catch the little fella and he'll have to give me his pot o' gold."
So, Murphy sneaks up on the leprechaun and grabs him by the shoulders.
The leprechaun is unhappy, but knows he can get away if he can get Murphy
to look away from him, even for an instant.
"Where's your pot o' gold?", says Murphy.
"Isn't that a purple cow over there?", says the leprechaun.
"I'm not taking my eyes off you!  Where's the gold?!", says Murphy.
"Look at that peacock flying overhead!", says the leprechaun.
"I'm wise to your tricks!  Where's the gold?!!", says Murphy.
Finally, the leprechaun gives up.  "All right", he says, "you've got me.
But I'm not a pot o' gold leprechaun, I'm a three-wish leprechaun."
"What's a three-wish leprechaun?", says Murphy.
"I can grant you up to three wishes", says the leprechaun, "but there's
a catch.  Whatever I give to you I give double to the person in the world
you hate the most.  I happen to know that's O'Brien over in the next town."
Murphy thinks it over and finally says "Done!  For my first wish I want
a fine, ten room mansion all for myself in that field over there."
"Done!" says the leprechaun and a beautiful mansion appears in the field.
In the field next to it is a 20 room mansion and on the porch stands
a surprised O'Brien saying "Why, thank you, Murphy.  I didn't think you
liked me."
"For my next wish", says Murphy, "I want ten of the most beautiful women in
the world to wait on me hand and foot."
"Done!", says the leprechaun, and ten stunning women appear on the front
porch of Murphy's new mansion.  O'Brien, now surrounded by twenty beautiful
women, is positively beaming.  "Bless you, lad!  I take back all the bad
thoughts I had of you", says he.
"Finally", says Murphy, "for my last wish ... I want my sexual potency
to be cut by fifty percent!"

had prescribed testosterone (a male hormone) for her.  She was a

"Doctor, the hormones you've been giving me have really helped, but
I'm afraid that you're giving me too much.  I've started growing hair
in places that I've never grown hair before."
The doctor reassured her. "A little hair growth is a perfectly normal
side effect of testosterone.  Just where has this hair appeared?"
"On my balls."

A guy was in a record store to buy a 45-rpm record of his favorite song.  After
he located it, he realized that he forgot his wallet.  Instead of going out and
getting his wallet, he decided to get a five-finger discount (shoplift), so he
put it down his pants.  Well, as he was leaving the store, the cashier stopped
him and said, "Excuse me, but is that a record in your pants?" 
To this, he responded, "It may not be a record, but I'm mighty proud of it."

   A city boy went duck hunting in the country one day.  While hunting
he shot a duck which fell on the property of a farmer.  The boy crawled
over the fence to claim his kill.  But, the farmer, seeing what had
happened rushed out with his shotgun and yelled, "See here!  That duck
belongs too me!"
   The city boy replies, "But I shot the duck, therefore it belongs to me!"
   The farmer says, "It fell on my property so it belongs to me!"  They
continue to argue, each claiming ownership of the duck.  After a while,
the farmer says, "We should settle this the old-fashioned way."
   The city boy asks, "What is the 'old-fashioned way'?"
   The farmer explains, "First, I kick you in the groin. Then, you kick
me in the groin and we continue in this fashion until one of us gives up.
The one who wins gets the duck."
   The city boy, willing to do anything to get his duck and leave, agrees
to the contest.  The farmer draws back his leg and kicks the city boy in
the groin with all his might.  The city boy, in horrible pain, falls to the
ground moaning and groaning.  After about 10 minutes, he manages to stand up
and croaks, "It's my turn now."
   The farmer says, "Oh, you can have the duck", and leaves.

A guy gets on a bus and notices a nun sitting over in
a corner.  Through her heavy head piece he just spots a glimmer
of her face.  Gorgeous!  She moves, and her vestments cannot
hide the fact she has a truly phenomenal body.  The guy gets
more and more excited until he finally approaches the nun and
says, "Sister, I don't normally do this sort of thing, but I
think I love you.  Can we get together some time?"

The nun leaves the bus in a huff.

Later as the guy is about to leave the bus himself, the bus
driver asks the guy if he was the one who was bothering the
nun.  The guy again apologizes, explaining once again that
he seldom did this sort of thing, but the bus driver says:
"No, don't apologize, I was checking her out myself.  In
fact, let me do you a favor.  Did you see where she got
off?  There's a little park there, and every day she goes
there to pray at the same time.  Go there tomorrow, and maybe
you'll get lucky!"

The guy thanks him and leaves.

Sure enough, the guy goes to the park and there's the little
nun in a secluded spot by some trees.  He goes off into the
bushes, and comes back a few minutes later in a long white
robe, a long blond wig with beard and a crown of thorns.
The nun is flabbergasted, and asks what she can do for him.
He says that every couple of thousand years, he likes to
come back to earth to get laid.  The nun says that she'd
love to help him, but that she was on her period, and
would the back door be OK?

He says fine, and they commence their activities.

A few minutes into it, he is suddenly overcome with a blast
of guilt, and says, panting, "Sister, I have to tell you
something.  I'm not really Jesus, I'm actually the guy
who was annoying you on the bus yesterday."

The nun says, "Oh, that's OK.  In fact, I'm not really
a nun.  I'm actually the bus driver."

Not wanting to traumatize the boy, the parents continue as if nothing was

Billy watches, and after a couple of minutes asks, "Daddy, can I climb on

"Of course, Son, we're a family."
So Billy climbs on and after a few more minutes his mother starts moaning

And she asked him how he did it.

There was a farmer who had a brown cow and a white cow and he
wanted to get them bred.  So, he borrowed his neighbor's bull
and turned it loose in the pasture.  He told his son to watch
and come in and tell him when the bull was finished.
"OK, Pop." said the little boy.
After a while, the boy came into the living room where his father
was talking with some friends.  "Say, Pop", said the boy, "the bull
just fucked the brown cow".
There was a sudden lull in the conversation.  The father said,
"Excuse me" and took his son outside.  "Son, you mustn't use
language like that in front of company.  You should say
'The bull surprised the brown cow'.  Now go and watch and tell
me when the bull surprises the white cow".
The father went back inside the house.  After a while the
boy came in and said, "Hey, Pop".
"Yes, Son.  Did the bull surprise the white cow?"
"He sure did, Pop!  He fucked the brown cow again!"

When he walks in he sees a leprechaun with the most enormous dick he
had ever seen.  As he pees, he cannot avoid spying on the giant
member of the tiny man dressed in green.  The leprechaun zips up and
the man asks him if he is indeed a real leprechaun.
   The little man says, "Aye me boy, I'm a leprechaun, and I can
grant you three wishes."
   "Oh neat," comes the reply, "What do I need to do?"
   "Well, havin' such a large cock makes it a bit awkward with the
ladies, the thing not fittin' and all ... I'll grant you your three
wishes if you wouldn't mind suckin' me dick until I come."  The man
is a bit taken aback, but agrees, because he knows he can wish for
anything he wants later.  After the green man has come, he starts to
walk away.
   The guy says, "Hey, what about my three wishes?"  The leprechaun
asks, "How old are you me boy?"
   "25," he says.
   "Aren't you a bit too old to still be believin' in leprechauns?"

"No problem!  I'll write you a check!"
"Very good, sir." says the shop owner.  "Today is Saturday.  You
may come by on Monday to pick it up, after the check has cleared."
So the man and the woman leave.  On Monday, the fellow returns.

a prostitute and they both went up in a hotelroom where
John said ".. I got a litle .. litle favor to ask".
"OK, but you have to pay extra for that" said the
prostitute. John took all his clothes off, went into the
shower, turn it on and said "Now.. Take the hairdryer, 
turn it on and blink the lights". The prostitute turned
the hairdryer on and when she started blinking the lights
John moaned with pleasure. "Oh Oh man,this is great. Now
I'm standing in the middle of a forest. It's raining 
cats and dogs and the lightnings lit up the sky. The wind

     "OK OK" said the prostitute "Isn't it time to make
love now ?". "Are you CRAZY" answered John

After a saturday night out, a guy comes home bringing a new 'acquaintance'

living room. The living room has the air of overstated technical elegance,

The interior is a sparkling dream (nightmare) in white, metal and glass.
(Your basic modern interior design of the mid-eighties).
"Well", sez the guy gesturing about the room, "How do you like it ? "
"Yeah!", sez the girl, "I kinda like it, but it's lacking something..

 I think, It lacks some human warmth."

The time is mid december some year, and Norway has a new ambassador in the
USA since two months. The telephone rings at his office.
- Good morning Mr Ambassador, I'm from the NewYork times, I wonder what
  you would like for christmas present.
The new ambassodor isn't stupid. He goes strictly by the rules, so there
won't be any scandal.
- Listen now Mr. I don't want any present. A present would be seen at as
  a bribe, and I won't let that happen: said the ambassador.
The next day, the phone rings again.
- Good morning Mr Ambassador, I'm from the NewYork times. I'm still interested
  in what you would like to have for christmas present.
The ambassador explains why he can't take any gifts, and the conversation
ends. The next day, the NewYork times journalist rings again. This time the
ambassador is quite upset.
- I thought, I told you already. No presents!
Then he said.
- Ok a fruit bowl would be nice, it really would.
Now he hopes the journalist will leave him. He is also sure, a fruit bowl
is harmless and won't cause any scandal.
Two days later, the NewYork times writes.

    Man on package tour in USA, one day of the tour is a bus ride
    down to Mexico. Whoopee he thinks, wild times, smokes, freaky
    things.
    Imagine his surprise when the bus drops him in a sleepy pueblo
    population: three people, one tumbleweed. The bus roars off and
    he hears the driver shout back something about returning in
    three hours.
    That's cool, he can amuse himself for three hours. He heads for
    the bar and tries to talk to the patron, who turns out to be the
    most boring person in the world. Five minutes later, it feels
    like three hours and he makes his excuse and leaves, only
    slightly puzzled that in three hours he only managed one drink.
    He decides to check the time and casts around for someone to
    ask. He sees a sleepy hombre sitting against the wall under a
    sombrero.
    "Quel estas l'hora?", he asks in his best Spanglais.
    "You what, man?", replies the hombre, who turns out to be an
    erstwhile extra from a 1970's Eastwood movie who missed the bus
    home.
    "The time. What is it?"
    The other reaches out to a mule which is standing beside him
    (this is a real mule, not a movie mule, you understand). He
    lifts its scrotum thoughtfully and then lets it drop. "About
    two thirty" he announces.
    "Astonishing", avers our hero. "How did you manage that?"
    Once again the other reaches out and lifts the donkey's scrotum.
    "You see that clock tower over there?"
    "Yes."
    "So can I now."

 There was this young taxi driver who was driving an old farmer
who had never been to Amsterdam before.
The driver decided to have a little fun and started telling the
old man that it was sometimes boring driving around so he and 
other drivers drove down old ladies just for the fun of it. The
old man was a bit nervous but tried not to show it trying to fit
in the capital's life. Then the driver shouted "There! An old lady!" and
hit the gas. The car rushed toward the old lady. At the last second
the driver turned so he would not kill the old lady, but at this
instant he heard "BUNK". He turned his head to see the old man with
a big smile "I got her using the door."

"Take over for a while, Dave" the pilot says to his co-pilot, "I think
I'll go take a shit and then bang that new stewardess."

At this statement the passengers fly into a frenzy of conversation and
gossip. The stewardess is greatly embarrassed and can no longer stay
at her post, so she hurries towards the cockpit. But in her haste, she
trips and falls to her knees in the aisle.

She happens to land next to a sweet old lady who turns to help her up.

This joke involves an elephant who is walking through the jungle.
And all of a sudden he falls into a pit and is stuck there. The 
elephant is stuck in this pit and realises that he is going to die,
so naturally he start to scream. By chance a chicken hears the screaming
of the elephant and decides to investigate. He sees the elephant stuck
in the pit and shouts to the elephant: "Dont worry, I am going to 
save you". The chicken then calls on the King of the Jungle.

The King of the Jungle promptly arrives in his *Red Porsche*. He throws
a rope from the Porche into the pit, the elephant ties it around himself
and the King of the Jungle pulls him out of the pit. The elephant
is saved (loud applause). 

So grateful is the elephant to the chicken that he promises him that 
he will one day do the same for him (if the chicken should ever be
in mortal danger).

As chance would have it, the next week the elephant is walking thru'
the jungle and hears the screaming of a chicken. He wanders over
and sees that his friend the chicken is stuck in a pit. (ohh, gosh)
The elephant shouts "Don't worry chicken I will save you". So the 
elephant throws his tail into the pit. However this tail is too
small and the chicken cannot reach it. Undeterred by this the
elephant throws in his trunk, but, alas this also is too small.
As a last desperate effort the elephant throws in his his penis.
Sucess! The chicken grabs the elephants enormous penis and climbs
out to safety.

Moral of the story:
"If you have a big dick you don't need a red Porsche to pull a chick."

Man in a pub with a friend.
A: Something amazing happened to me last night.
B: What's that?
A: I was at the home of a guy I know, and I was in bed with his wife while
   he was out at the pub. We were really going at it, and suddenly we heard
   a car screech to a halt outside. My lover looked horrified. "Oh my god! 
   My husbands arrived home!" she said. "Christ! What do I do?" I cried.
   "You'd better jump out the window before he finds you", she said, so
   I quickly got out the window. It was dark so I couldn't see, and I didn't
   want to fall to my death so I hung by my fingers to the window ledge.
B: Wow. That sounds bad.
A: It gets worse! Her husband entered the room, and he sounded very drunk.
   While I was hanging there I heard him get into bed and they were soon going 
   at it, very noisily.  After they'd finished, he got out of bed, opened the 
   window and started peeing out the window, all over me, even though he 
   couldn't see me! But of course I daren't let go...
B: Wow. That sounds really bad.
A: It gets worse! A bit later he opens the window and starts crapping out
   the window, goddamn it! All over me again!!!
B: Wow. That sounds really really bad.
A: It gets worse! Even later on, he opens the window again and this time
   he damn well pukes out the window, all over me again!!!
B: Wow. That sounds really really really bad.
A: It gets worse! I'd had enough by this time, so I let go. And then I
   realised I was only 2 feet from the ground!!!!

A father, mother and son decide to go to the zoo one day. So they set off
and are seeing lots of animals. Eventually they end up opposite the 
elephant house. The boy looks at the elephant, sees its willy points to it
and says "Mummy, what is that long thing ?"
His mother replies "That son, is the elephant's trunk".
"No, at the other end"
"That son is the tail"
"No, mummy, the thing under the elephant"
A short embarrassed silenced after which she replies "Thats nothing"
The mother goes to buy some icecream ( <-- this bit is improvised ) and the
boy, not being satisfied with her answer asks his father the same question.
"Daddy, what is that long thing?"
"That's the trunk, son" replies the father.
"No at the other end"
"Oh, that is the tail"
"No, no daddy, the thing below" asks the son in desperation.

A boy scout was out doing his bob-a-job stint one Saturday in
Farmborough. He walked up to the front door of one house
and rang the doorbell. The owner appeared. "Yes ?"
"Bob a job week, sir !"
At first the man didn't want anything to do with the kid, but eventually
he agreed to give him a job. "You can paint my porch for me", he said.
"The paint and brushes are in the garage - here's the key."
The boy scout toddled off to do the job. Two hours later, he rang the
doorbell. "Job's done", he said, his palm outstretched.
"Harumph. Took your time, didn't you ? Well, okay, here's your FIVE PENCE !"
The boy took the money and started to walk away, but after a few paces he
turned around and said, "Oh, thanks for the donation, but by the way, it

This big guy (and I mean *really* big) is sitting in his local pub,
having a beer when this little guy comes running in. "Quick, quick",
he says, "there's a guy in bed with your wife!" The big guy downs
his beer, slams the glass on the bar counter and rushes, swearing,
to his car, a new BMW. With screaming tyres and a gnashing of teeth
he drives home. (He has this big double-story house with garden,
palm trees etc.) His wife just manages to meet him at the door, still
buttoning up her blouse, hair all in a mess and a looking a bit
flushed. "Where's the bastard, I'll kill him", says the big guy and
rushes up the stairs to the next floor - bathroom, bedroom kitchen etc.
The search continues for a few minutes amidst much ranting, raving and
further gnashing of teeth when, as he reaches the kitchen, he hears
someone starting up his car. For a second he wavers, but as he's also
a quick-thinking guy, he realizes there's only one thing he can do. So,
he lifts the refrigerator and with a mighty heave throws it out the
window onto the escaping car. All hell breaks loose because our hero
slips in the process and follows the refrigerator out the window onto
the car. Remember, he was on the second floor.

When he wakes up in hospital later he's covered from head to foot in
bandages and plaster and has various broken bones. He turns and sees
he's not alone. The guy next to him is in worse shape than he. So he
says "What happened to you?". "You won't believe it", he replies "I
was sitting peacefully, driving this car when suddenly a refrigerator
falls from the sky, wrecking me and the car". The big guy is just
considering whether to deal with him immediately or to wait until he's
recovered when the other guy says, "But you should see *him* - he
looks really bad." The big guy looks around and sees that there is yet
a third man in the room, and he is badly beaten up - all arms and legs
broken, everything in plaster, only eyes and mouth sticking out etc.
(the classic picture). "What happened to you?", says the big guy. The
third guy can hardly talk and obviously hadn't been following the
conversation. "It's a long story", he manages to utter "but, basically,
you see, I was sitting inside this refrigerator ..."

Once Reagan visited India and was touring the country-side with
Rajiv Gandhi. At quite a few places, he noticed people shitting
out in the open. Wanted to help, he drew his cheque book out, and 
offered the Indian Premier a cheque worth $.... to build a few
toilets. It embarrassed Rajiv to the n-th extent, but he had no
other option than to accept it.

Well, a time came when Rajiv visited the States. Whenever he 
went out he keenly searched for someone shitting out in the open;
Sothat he could put Reagan in a similiar embarrassing position.
To his luck, he found one man shitting in the open. Pleased
very much, Rajiv offered Reagan a donation for building a toilet.
Refusing it, Reagan said calmly:

"He has his own toilet. But he insists on shitting like this.
You know, he is the Indian ambassador".

One night our friend, lets call him Jim, was out on the town. It was one of
those nights when it was raining and he was _forced_ into a Pub for shelter. 
You know the sort of night I mean. Well as soon as Jim went into the pub he 
met a few friends and so he had a few drinks, and a few more, and a 
few more......

12.00 o'clock and Jim with a rather large smile starts to stagger home
through the rain. As is usual with this state of being, Jim decides that
there is nothing better than an Indian Curry. So off he goes to his local Taj
Mahal Take-Away. He goes in an orders an _extra-extra-hot Vindaloo Curry_.

15 minutes later Jim arrives back home. He places the Curry on the kitchen
table and heads upstairs for a good piss. While he is upstairs relieving
himself the cat comes over to the table. Now the cat had been neglected and
was rather hungry, so it decided to have a go at the curry. Nibble, nibble,
chomp, chomp, lick, lick. End of Curry. Just as the cat was licking the plate
in comes Jim. Shock horror - anger - Jim starts to get mad. Grabs cat by scruff
of neck and drags it outside. "You horrible little moggie, I hate you, you're
dead now" rants our friend Jim. He fills a dustbin with water and throws the
hissing cat into the bin and place the lid on top of the bin. Then he puts a
concrete block on the bin, just to be sure. 

Jim returns to his sitting room and sits down feeling very sorry for himself.
A few minutes later he hears a knock on the window. He goes over and opens
it. Who should be there but the cat. Jim can't believe his eyes.

The cat looks at Jim and says "You wouldn't happen to have any more water ,
please ? ".

The bloke says "Never mind, instead I'll have the roast duck, roast
potatoes, cabbage and broccoli"
The waiter says "Er, no sir, we really have no broccoli today."
The guy says "Oh, in that case I'll have the chicken, sprouts,
carrots, and broccoli."
The waiter is by now well pissed off.  "Listen, sir, how do you spell

This woman decides to buy a new cupboard that you have to assemble
yourself.
Back home she reads the instructions carefully and assembles the
cupboard in the bedroom. It looks really neat. Then, a train passes
and the whole cupboard collapses.
Not daunted by this she re-reads the instructions and reassembles
the cupboard. Then, a train passes and the whole cupboard collapses.
Thinking that she must have done *something* wrong she re-re-reads the
instructions and re-re-assembles the cupboard. Then, a train passes
and the whole cupboard collapses.
Now, she's finally fed up with this and calls the client service. She is told
that this is quite impossible and that they'll send along a technician to have
a look. The technician arrives and assembles the cupboard.
Then, a train passes and the cupboard collapses.
Completely baffled by this unexpected event, the technician decides to
reassemble the cupboard and sit inside it to see whether he can find
out what causes the cupboard to collapse.
At this point, the womans husband comes home, sees the cupboard and
says: "That's a nice looking cupboard", and opens it.
Says the technician: "You won't believe me, but I'm standing here
waiting for the train".

How to buy a stereo.

1)
Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc.
Multiply by a factor of 100.
2)
The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably
blinking and flashing in time with the music.
3)
The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look
very C00L.
4)
The system should be broken up into as many components as possible.
(e.g. pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, post-amp, etc.)
5)
The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should 
look very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers is important.
(e.g. woofers, tweeters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, etc.)
6)
The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft.
7)
The system should have full remote control capability, including over the
mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get home.
8)
Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the
house.
9)
Components should have a cool names.
10)
The complete set up should put a major recording studio or large radio
station to shame.
11)
Having state of the art equiptment is not enough. You should be a year or two
ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete and
should be disposed of promptly.
12)
The most important factor....
Out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.

Darkness informed him that he could arrange it so that he would win _all_
of his court cases, make twice as much money, work half as hard, be 
appointed to the Supreme Court by the age of 49, and live to be 90.  All
he had to do was promise the devil his soul, the soul of his wife, his
children, and the souls of all of his ancestors.
	The lawyer thought for a minute, and then responded:  "So what's

So, it was WW2 and a ship was sailing over the seas
when suddenly the captain runs to Bjorn who was stearing the ship and shouted:
"There's a torpedo coming towards us! Go tell the boys downstairs
to wear their life-jackets, but try not to cause any panic."
Well, Bjorn had a sick sense of humour and so he went under the deck and said
to the crew: "You know, I bet that if I put my cock on the table, the whole
ship will explode!"
Everybody laughed, but Bjorn insisted on making the bet.
"I tell you guys, you better wear your life-jackets!"
Still laughing, the men put on their jackets, and then Bjorn laid his genitals
on the table. BOOM!!! The crew found themselves floating in the sea.
The captain spotted Bjorn, swam to him and shouted in anger:
"What the HELL were you doing down there!!!??? The torpedo missed us
by ten meters!!!"

A deaf couple checks into a motel very late at night. Upon moving into
their assigned room, they go to bed. But in the middle of the night, the
woman has a headache, so she goes into the bathroom for aspirin. But she
finds none, and remembers that the bottle of aspirin is still in the car.
Afraid to go out alone at night, she awakens her husband and asks him to
go get the aspirin from the car. The very groggy husband puts on his robe
and toddles wearily outside. He finds the bottle of the aspirin in the car's
glove compartment, and gets ready to go back to the room when he realizes
something: he can't remember which room was his! He thinks and thinks and
then gets an idea. He opens the car again and honks the steering wheel horn
several times. Within a minute, all the motel's windows lighten up --
except one window, and of course, he makes for the room with that window.

A man walks along a lonely beach.
Suddenly he hears a deep voice: DIG !
He looks around: nobody's there.  I am having hallucinations, he thinks.
Then he hears the voice again: I SAID, DIG !
So he starts to dig in the sand with his bare hands, and after some inches,
he finds a small chest with a rusty lock.
The deep voice says: OPEN !
Ok, the man thinks, lets open the thing.  He finds a rock with which to
destroy the lock, and when the chest is finally open, he sees a lot of
gold coins.
The deep voice says: TO THE CASINO !
Well the casino is only a few miles away , so the man takes the chest
and walks to the casino.
The deep voice says: ROULETTE !
So he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens and goes to
one of the tables, where the players gaze at him with disbelief.
The deep voice says: 27 !
He takes the whole pile and drops it at the 27.  The table nearly bursts.
Everybody is quiet when the croupier throws the ball.
.....
The ball stays at the 26.

Some years ago an Englishman on a plane to Australia was handed one
of these cards to fill in, in normal Commonwealth style.
After the standard ones, like name, nationality, passport number, etc..
he got to one that asked:
  "Have you ever been imprisoned?"
After thinking about that for some time he entered:
  "I didn't know it was still a requirement"

The dew was still wet as the prisoner was let out into the yard for the last
time.  The soldiers of the firing detail shuffled out to their usual
positions as the guards led the prisoner to the stake at the far end of the
paddock.  There, he was securely bound as the captain of the guards stepped
forward to contend with the final courtesies.

   "Blindfold?", he inquired.

   "No, thank you," said the condemned.

 The captain was a little taken aback at the difficulty and leaned forward so
as no to be heard.

  "Please," he said, "take the blindfold.  It is not an act of cowardice to be
spared this spectacle.  It makes it MUCH easier for you."

  The condemned thought for a moment and relented.  The blindfold was tied 
over his eyes.

  "Cigarette?" offered the captain.

  "No thanks," said the prisoner, "I don't smoke."

  Here again the captain paused and thought of a tactful approach.  He leaned i
in and spoke in a confidential tone. 

  "No matter.  Please take the cigarette.  It makes it MUCH easier for the men
on the firing squad."

Two men were at a poker game that had run late; 3:00 AM to be exact

Man1:  You know what I hate about these games?  When I go home.
       I turn off my headlights, turn off the engine, and coast into the
       driveway.  Then I go to the front door, take off my shoes and
       sneak in as quietly as I can.  But my wife always wakes up and
       we end up having a fight.

Man2:  What I do instead is drive into the driveway, honk the horn a few
       times, get out of the car, slam the door, go in the house and slam
       the door.  Then I yell "Honey, I'm home", run upstairs, slap her on

One day a journalist, hard-up for a story, was sitting on an Australian beach.
As he gazed pensively out to sea, he saw a young woman thrashing about in the
water.  Upon further observation, he saw a shark circling her.  His adrenalin
pumping, he wondered what he could do to save her.  Then a well built young
man, who was jogging along the beach, suddenly dashed into the sea, karate
chopped the shark, killing it, and helped the young woman swim to the beach.

The excited journalist, seeing a fantastic story, ran up to the young man and
said, "That was the most courageous thing I've ever seen in my life.  I'm
going to let the world know about this.  You'll be famous.  I can see it now,

			NEWS BULLETIN!!!

Today, in a tragic accident at the Exxon corporate headquarters, the
fish truck "Prince William Express" slammed into the side of the main
building of the new corporate headquarters spilling more than 20 tons 
of dead herring, salmon, sea otters and various other wildlife on to
the pristine lawn of the Exxon complex.

Skipper Joe Woodhead was passed out the in the sleeper compartment of the
state-of-the-art fish truck when the truck struck the clearly-marked
building.  "Bobo", the skipper's dog, had the wheel at the time of
the accident.  Bobo, whose certification does not permit him to drive
on planet earth, was unavailable for comment, and confirmed sources
suggest he has a history of drug abuse.

The skipper contends that he was not drunk at the time of the
accident, but when he realized the seriousness of the spill he ran
out to a local tavern and pounded down a half-dozen beers.  Woodhead
also contends that he told Bobo to give him a "Bud light", not a "hard
right".

The President of the Prince William Express Co. said that they would
assume full responsibility for the spill and would submit a plan in
about a month on the proposed clean-up procedure.  He also stated
that they ship over a million tons of seafood a year and that an
accident like this is just the price we have to pay to eat fish.

When asked about the clean-up equipment for such a spill, company
officials commented that a small pickup with a shovel in it was in
Gopher Spits, Iowa, but had a flat tire and therefore would be unable
to be dispatched to the scene.

On the market side of things, fish prices will increase by 20% for
all species.

Vice President Dan Quail flew to the texaco headquarters today and
reported that there appeared to be no damage, and was returning to
Washington, DC.

A Frenchman and an Italian were seated next to an American in an overseas
flight.  After a few cocktails, the men began discussing their home lives.

    "Last night I made love to my wife four times," the Frenchman bragged,
"and this morning she made me delicious crepes and she told me how much she
adored me."

    "Ah, last night I made love to my wife six times," the Italian responded,
"and this morning she made me a wonderful omelet and told me she could never
love another man."

    When the American remained silent, the Frenchman smugly asked, "And how many
times did _you_ make love to your wife last night?"

    "Once," he replied.

    "Only once?" the Italian arrogantly snorted.  "And what did she say to you
this morning?"

    "Don't stop."

Q: What has one horn and gives milk?
A: A milk lorry.


------------------------------------------------------------


There was once a young man whose house was on one side of central London
and whose job was on the other.  It was a highly lucrative job, and
after a couple of years he bought himself one of the most expensive new
cars you can imagine.  It was really brightly coloured; the horn made a
stentorian Beep-Beep, it went extremely fast, it made a lot of noise,
and all the girls looked at you when you got out of it.

But living in London has its drawbacks, and one of these was that he
scarcely ever had the chance to drive the car at its top speed, and he
found this ever so frustrating.  He complained to a friend, who
suggested that he take the car to Ireland.  `Ireland had a huge road
building program in the 19th century', the friend explained, `but there
isn't the traffic there, and there's no speed limit'.  [All these
purported facts are entirely fictitious but this is a JOKE, not a
tourist guide.] And immediately the young motorist booked his car on the
ferry to Ireland. 

The journey took a day; he woke up early in Dublin and jumped into the
driving seat.  The car glided onto the main road
south-west, and soon the houses disappeared and the countryside began,
and the road lay straight and empty and wide and level and inviting
before him. 

Down went the foot on the accelerator and the needle on the speedometer
jerked clockwise: 120 mph, 130, 140...  and then, as suddenly if they
had appeared from nowhere, he saw a man and a donkey crossing the road
in front of him: so unused to traffic that they hadn't bothered to look
out for it.  He swerved the car to the right, missing them both, but he
could not stop in time and he crashed the car through a fence and hit an
old tree in the nearby field. 

And the old man said to the donkey: `Sure, an' we just got out of dat
field in time, didn't we!'

Seems a mute was walking down the street one day and chanced upon a friend
of his (also a mute).  In sign language, he inquired how his friend had been
doing.

The friend replied (vocally!) "Oh, can that hand-waving shit.  I can talk now."

Intrigued, the mute pressed him for details.  Seems he had gone to a 
specialist, who, seeing no physical damage, had put him on a treatment 
program that had restored the use of his vocal chords.

Gesturing wildly, the mute asked if he might meet this specialist.  They got
an appointment that very afternoon.

After an exam, the specialist proclaimed that there was no permanent damage,
that the mute was essentially in the same condition as his buddy, and that
there was no reason why he couldn't be helped as well.

"Yes, yes" signed the mute.  "Let's have the first treatment right now!"

"Very well," replies the specialist.  "Kindly go into the next room, drop
your pants and lean over the examining table.  I'll be right in."

The mute does as instructed, and the doctor sneaks in with a broomstick,
mallet and jar of Vaseline.  Greasing the broom handle, he "sends it home"
with a few deft swipes of the mallet.

The mute jumps from the table, screaming "AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

"VERY good," smiles the doctor.  "Next Tuesday, we start with 'B'"

A British officer spotted a "busker" (street singer/bum) at the
bottom of the escalator of the London Underground.  The busker
had a sign which read: "VETERAN SOLDIER OF THE FALKLANDS WAR."
The officer thought, "Poor chap, I was there and it was awful!"
Feeling sorry for a fellow veteran, the officer took 20 pounds out of
his wallet and gave it to the busker.  The officer was then greeted 
with a hearty: "Gracias, Senor!!"

This story was told to me by a family friend who is an Illinois State
Trooper. One day he was pulling off an expressway near Chicago. When
he turned onto the street at the end of the ramp, he noticed someone
at a chicken place getting into his car. He placed the bucket of chicken
on top of his car, got in and drove off with the bucket still atop his car.
So the trooper decides to pull him over and perform a community service
by giving the driver his chicken. So he pulled him over, walked up to the car,
pulled the bucket off the roof and offered it to the driver. The driver looks
at the trooper and says "No thanks, I just bought some."

A farmer in the country noticed that a gentleman would fish
at the lake (close to the farmer's house) and would always
leave with a stringer full of fish.  The fellow had a boat
but a fishing pole was not to be seen.  The farmer mentioned
the situation to the lake ranger.  The ranger then started 
watching this man and all that the farmer said was true!  The
man would arrive at the lake in the morning and by early 
afternoon, he had a stringer full of fish.  The ranger dressed
like a fisherman one day and approached the man.  They exchanged
pleasantries and the stranger asked the ranger in disguise to
come fish with him.  They boated for 45 minutes and arrived at
a secluded spot.  The stranger then pulled out a stick of dynamite.

Ranger:  "I'm going to have to place you under arrest - I am
	  a Ranger and you are fishing illegally!"

The stranger calmly lit the stick of dynamite and handed it to
the ranger.

Stranger:  "Are you gonna talk or fish?"

Here's one people can tell to their grandmothers:

Once upon a time there was a famous sea captain.  This captain was very 
successful at what he did; for years he guided merchant ships all over the 
world.  Never did stormy seas or pirates get the best of him.  He was 
admired by his crew and fellow captains.  

However, there was one thing different about this captain.  Every morning 
he went through a strange ritual.  He would lock himself in his captain's 
quarters and open a small safe.  In the safe was an envelope with a piece 
of paper inside.  He would stare at the paper for a minute, then lock it 
back up.  After, he would go about his daily duties.  

For years this went on, and his crew became very curious.  Was it a 
treasure map?  Was it  a letter from a long lost love?  Everyone speculated 
the contents of the strange envelope.  

One day the captain died at sea.  After laying the captain's body to rest, 
the first  mate led the entire crew into the captains quarters.  He opened 
the safe, got the envelope, opened it and...  

The first mate turned pale and showed the paper to the others.  Four words 
were on the paper, two on two lines: 

``Port Left Starboard Right''

A husband and wife were lying in bed one night.  (Since they have small
children, the universal-parent coding system for sex is washing machine.)  
The husband turned to his wife and said in a seductive voice "washing
machine."   The wife, being the hard working parent she is, was tired
and she said "Not tonight, dear; I'm tired."   He rolled away.

Five minutes later, he rolled back over and repeated "Honey, washing machine."
She said "I've got a headache."

He rolled away again.   Ten minutes later, the wife, feeling guilty, turned
to her husband and said, "OK, washing machine."

He replied.  "That's OK.  It was a small load and I did it by hand."

It's a nice hot summers day and two men are playing golf on a course
that is situated near a main road. As he is just about to tee off on
the 10th hole one of the men notices a hearse driving slowly along the
road. He stops in mid swing and places his club on the ground, turns
round, faces the road and removes his hat in a solemn gesture. The
second man turns round to him and says...

M2: "Come off it, it's only a hearse."

M1: "But you don't understand, its my wife's funeral..."

The Eighteen Bottles

    I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by my
wife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or
else...  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  I
withdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down the
sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew
the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the
exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from
the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I
pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the
bottle down the glass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the
cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down
the glass.  I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork
down the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the
drink and drank the pour.  When I had everything emptied, I steadied
the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks
with the other, which were twenty-nine, and as the houses came by I
counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle,
which I drank.  I'm not under tha affluence of incohol as some tinkle
peep I am.  I'm not half as thunk as you might drink.  I fool so
feelish I don't know who is me, and the drunker I stand here, the
longer I get.

	A feeling common to most Canadians is that Americans, when met
individually, can be so likable, while the country as a whole is not.  The
American I liked best in my travels about Europe was the young man I
encountered one day at the Acropolis as tourists scrambled to record that
crowning achievement high above smoggy Athens.  He was standing outside the
Parthenon, offering to operate the cameras carried by an endless series of
puffing couples in pastels and pinks.  He had grown so ashamed of the
gaucheness and vulgarity of his fellow Americans throughout Europe that he
decided the Parthenon -- the site of the photograph of a lifetime for Madge and
Henry -- was the spot for revenge.  He took all their pictures for them --
while carefully cutting off their heads or including only their feet.  He
cackled as he imagined all those tourists, safely back home in Iowa or
Louisiana, finding out when the drugstore returned their Kodak prints that a
saboteur with the same passport had betrayed them.

     There's this pheasant standing in a field chatting to a bull.
"I would love to be able to get to the top of yonder tree" sighs
our feathered friend, "but I haven't got the energy." (bit of a
lazy layabout pheazzy) "Why don't you nibble on some of my droppings"
replies the bull sympathetically "they're packed with nutrients".
So our hero pecks at a lump of dung and finds he has enough strength to
reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after some more eating
he can reach the second branch, and so it continues. Two weeks later we
find our plumed friend perched on the top of the tree proudly surveying
the countryside where he is spotted by the local farmer. "What a beautiful
creature" says the farmer as he dashes into the farmhouse. It is the work
of an instant for him to emerge with a shotgun and blow the f**k out of
the pheasant.
       The moral of this minor tragedy? Bullshit might get you to the top,
but it won't keep you there!

"Why should I push the button?", the man thinks, and turns around.
After two or three steps, he thinks "Maybe it's best to do as the sign says",
so he turns around again, and pushes the button.
Five seconds later, the door opens and a man asks "Yes? What can I do for you?"
- Do for me??? I just pushed the button, the man says pointing at the sign.
- Was there nothing you wanted???
- No. I just pushed the button.

The man behind the door shakes his head and closes the door. Our hero, the
farmer, starts his walk back to the waiting room.

After a few minutes he enters the corridor again, and of course finds the
door, button and sign again.
He pushes the button, and out comes the man saying "Yes? What can I do for
you?"
- Nothing, sir, I just pushed the button.
- Just pushed the button??? Isn't there anything you want?
- No. I just did as the sign says, the farmer says, pointing at the sign.
The man shakes his head and closes the door and our hero returns to the waiting
room.

After another few minutes he enters the corridor again. Again he finds the
door, button and sign. Again he pushes the button and the man pops out saying
"Ye.... You again! What's the matter with you! It seems as fools are growing on
trees where you come from."
- Yes, and here you just push the button, and they pop out, says the man.

Mother supreme is praying in the chapel, when she hears from outside a
lot of yelling and laughing. When she look out of the window, she sees
all the sisters riding around on their new bikes. And they have fun!
But because of this noise mother supreme can't concentrate on praying,
so she goes out and says:" Sisters, please! A bit more quiet, or you
all will have to put the saddles back!"

It seems that in this small mid-western town a minister was given gifts
by his congregation.  An eldery woman comes up to him and presents him
with several home-baked pies.  He graciously accepts her gifts and 
heads for home.

Later on, he and his friends decide to try these pies only to find that
they are possibly the worst examples of Man's cooking skills yet to be
discovered.  Try as they might, they could not stomache the goods and
finally were forced to dump the entire lot into the garbage.

At the next week's service, the minister was greeted by the eldery woman
again who asked, "Sir, did you enjoy my pies?  I made them especially for
you.."  Not wishing to hurt the poor woman's feelings, and yet wishing
to stay to the true course set for him, what could he do?  Finally, 
inspiration hits upon him.

"Madam, as God is my witness, I can truly say that no pie like yours lasts
 long around our house."

There was a girl who just started working in a bank. Every day, she
noticed that a very attractive man walked by her office. She discovered
that he was the bank president and that he made quite a lot of money. She
decided that she would like to get to know this man, but she was not
quite sure what to do to get him to ask her out on a date.

She went to her analyst and he gave her some advice. While she was around
this man he suggested that she pretend a string was attached to the top
of her head and that it hung down her left side to her waist. She was to
also to pretend that a penny was attached to the end of the string. When
she walked near this guy she was to pretend to hit the penny with her
left hip. This, stated the analyst, would cause him to notice her.

The next day, she passed the man in the hall and began moving her left
hip. In her head she was thinking, "Hit the penny... hit the penny... hit
the penny..." Just as the analyst predicted, the man noticed her and
stopped to chat for a while.

This worked well for a few days, but the man never did ask her out. She
talked to her analyst again, and this time he told her to pretend that
she also had another string attached to the top of her head that hung
down to her right hip. Attached to this string was a nickel. As she
walked near the man she was now to use her hips to first hit the penny
and then hit the nickel.

The next day at work, she saw the man and began moving her hips. In her
head she was thinking, "Hit the penny... hit the nickel... hit the
penny... hit the nickel..." Just as predicted, the man stopped her and
asked her out on a date.

After a few weeks and numerous dates later, the girl decided that she
wanted this man to ask her to marry him. After talking to her analyst, he
suggested she pretend she had another string attached to the top of her
head that hung down her back to her bottom, and attached to this string
was a dime. She was now to use her hips to hit all of these coins.

The next day they had a date, and when she saw the man she began moving
her hips again. In her head she was thinking, "Hit the penny... hit the
nickel... hit the dime... hit the penny... hit the nickel... hit the
dime..." That night, just as the analyst predicted, the man asked her to
marry him.

She was very happy, and began to make wedding plans. She also began to
worry about her honeymoon because she was a virgin and was not well
versed in the art of making love. She talked to her analyst again and
this time he told her to pretend that one more string was attached to the
top of her head and than it hung down in front of her to her private
parts. He told her to hit the coins when she was making love to her new
husband.

A few weeks later her wedding day arrived. After the ceremony the newly
married couple rushed of to their honeymoon. That night she went into the
bathroom at the hotel and practiced moving her hips. "Hit the penny...
hit the nickel... hit the dime... hit the quarter... hit the penny... hit
the nickel... hit the dime... hit the quarter..."

Soon they were in bed together and as they began making love she started
moving her hips. In her head she was thinking, "Hit the penny... hit the
nickel... hit the dime... hit the quarter... hit the penny... hit the
nickel... hit the dime... hit the quarter... Oh, forget the small
change... hit the quarter... hit the quarter... hit the quarter..."

Red-tapism:

Take a cage with apes. In the cage we hang a banana on a string,
and put a stairs under it. Before long an ape goes to the stairs
towards the banana, but as soon as it even touches the stairs,
all apes are sprayed with water. After a while the same ape or
another one makes another attempt, with the same result: all
apes are sprayed. If later another ape tries to climb the
stairs, the others will try to prevent it.

 Now we take one ape from the cage and put in a new one. The new
ape sees the banana, and wants to climb the stairs. To his
horror all other apes attack him. After another attempt he
knows: if he wants to climb the stairs, he is beaten up. Then we
remove a second ape and replace it by another new one. The
newcommer goes to the stairs and gets beaten up. The previous
new ape takes part in the punishment with enthousiasm.

  A third old ape is replaced by a third new one. The new one
makes it to the stairs and get beaten up as well. Two of the
apes who beat him, have no idea why you may not climb the stairs.
  We replace the fourth old ape, and the fifth, etc until all
apes which ones have been sprayed with water have been replaced.
Nevertheless, no ape ever tries to climb the stairs.

"But Sir, why not?"
"Because that's the way we do things here, lad."

A certain vicar decided it was high time he informed his three triplet
daughters about the "birds and the bees", and tested their chastity at the
same time.
Thus he approached his first daughter, dropped his trousers, pointed to his
manhood, and asked his daughter if she knew what it was. 
  "That's your cock", she replied.
  "You foul-mouthed young hussy, go and rinse your mouth out with soap!"
stormed the enraged father. Still fuming, he approached his second daughter,
dropped his trousers, pointed to his manhood, and asked his daughter if she
knew what it was. 
  "That's your dick", she replied.
  "Why, you daughter of Jezebel, you scarlet woman, go and dissolve your tongue
in boiling nitric acid!" [or something] he ranted. In desperation, he sought
his third daughter, dropped his trousers, pointed to his manhood, and asked if
she knew what it was.
  "I've no idea", she replied.
  "Oh, my darling chaste young child!" he said in delight. "That, my dear, is
my penis."
  To which she responded: "Call that a penis?"

The weekly bulletin from a local church included the following:

The ideal pastor preaches exactly 10 minutes.  He condemns sin, but
never hurts anyone's feelings.  He works from 8AM to midnight, and
also serves as the church janitor.  He makes $40 a week, wears good
clothes, and donates $30 a week to the church.  He is 29 years old and
has 40 years of experience.  He makes 15 house calls a day and is
always in his office.

If your pastor does not measure up to these criteria, send this list
to six other churches that are also dissatisfied with their pastor.
Then, bundle up your pastor and send him to the church at the top of
the list.  In one week you will receive 1,643 pastors.  Surely one of
them will be perfect.  Have faith in this letter.  One church broke
the chain and got its old pastor back in three months.

Summary: Julie "The Deviate" Andrews


These songs were written by some people here at uni
and they have given me permission to post them here.
They are to be sung to the tune of "My Favourite Things"
(I just *knew* that movie had to be good for something)

This was written by Fred Curtis (who is perfectly normal - really)

	Pointers to pointers to printf()-like functions;
	Unary minus and nested conjunctions;
	Integers, booleans, characters, strings;
	These are a few of my favourite things.

	Bach on a CD and good indentation;
	Not getting mugged while en route to the station;
	Fountains with wishes and Gnomes without slings;
	These are a few of my favourite things.

	When the bug bites! When core dumps!
	When the machine's had the <proverbial>
	I simply remember my favourite things
	And then I don't fell so sick.

In response to which came the following song:

WARNING: May be offensive - pretend that it's rot13'd

This was written by someone who won't let me name him here
but honestly, he's the most pious, kindhearted and morally
pure person I know :-) The devil made him do it

	Fourteen inch dildos with straps of elastic
	Form fitting undies made out of clear plastic
	Five foot four women with haircuts like boys
	These are a few of my favourite toys.

	Warm sticky substances smeared on my belly
	Plastic containers filled with KY Jelly
	Women who can turn their tongues upside down
	These are a few of the best things I've found.

	When the whip cracks. When the straps snap.
	When I'm feeling glum.
	I think of the wonderful games that I've played.
	I let out a sigh and <proverbial>.

Isn't it amazing what people trying to avoid work can get up to?

BTW - I apologise for misspelling Dan Quayle's name in an earlier article (I
was aping DimOne FeltHead at the time - a bad mistake), but then again I don't
pay any attention to politics over here, why should I give a shit about your
politics?

    A friend of mine and I made up a chess variant that used the same
pieces and moves, but we changed the board: we wrapped the back rows of
the opposite teams together, then sliced the board diagonally and laid
it back out flat (not physically, of course), so the starting position
had both sets of pieces along the middle diagonal, with a rook alone in
one corner, etc., etc.  Moves were made according to chess rules, but
with this setup, bishops (e.g.) would move orthogonally in one direction
and make knight-like moves in the other (that's how it appeared).

    We had originally done this as an exercise in concentration (keeping
the game in one's head).  A friend of ours, who fancied himself quite a
chess player, would come by and watch (being too proud to ask the
rules).  To keep it interesting, we would roll dice, (which had
*nothing* to do with anything), and then occasionally make comments like
"I was afraid you were going to move your queen, but with that roll...". 
And yes, after him watching a few games, he thought he had figured out
how to play the game.  (well, it was hilarious at the time).  We never did
tell him what was up.

In the way of practical jokes, my roomate and I took a study break to buy some
beer on a Spring afternoon.  We decided to buy one of the generic Beaver mags
because it had "phonograph sex" included.  As it turned out, it had a plastic
recording of an orgy on it.  Since our next door neighboors were all young
nurses, and my roomates and myself were all young perverts there was always
lots of wild noises emanating from our building.  Anyway, we lowered all the
lights, put the speakers near the windows, and played the pornograph at a very
loud volume.  We almost died from laughing when we saw all of the neighboors
looking out their windows and listening very intently to the moans, groans,
and "fuck-me's".  It was more fun than the cheap beer (Black Label, ughh!).

A certain zoo had acquired a very rare species of gorilla.  Within a few
weeks the gorilla, a female, became very ornery, and difficult to handle.
Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined the problem: she was 
in heat.  What what to do?  There was no male of this species available.
While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Mike,
a JEDR responsible for cleaning the animals' cages.  Now Mike, it was
rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, and he wasn't very
bright.  So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution.
Perhaps they could entice Mike to satisfy the female gorilla.  So he was
approached with a proposition: would he be willing to screw the gorilla -
for five hundred bucks?  Mike replied that he might be interested, but
would have to think the matter over.
The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer,
but only under three conditions:  "First," he said, "I don't want to 
have to kiss her", and "Second, I want nothing to do with any offspring
that may result from this union".
The zoo administration quickly acceded to these conditions, but what
could be the third?  "Well," said Mike, "You've gotta give me another
week to come up with the five hundred bucks".

In a company there are two employees, Jack and Jill.  Both have been model
employees and have been much valued by the firm.  However, due to financial
setbacks, the company is forced to let one of them go.  But which one?
The boss decides on a plan.  He will watch Jack closely for one day,
monitoring his performance.  The next day, he will similarly scrutinize
Jill.  Then he will announce which one he is going to keep and which one
will have to be fired.
The first day, Jack comes in early.  He works hard all morning, not even
taking a coffee break.  He skips lunch.  He works hard all afternoon,
doesn't spend any time on the phone, and leaves late.
Noticing this, the boss begins to think, "If they're both such diligent
workers, the choice is going to be even harder."
The next day, Jill comes in late, complaining of a headache.  She takes some
aspirin and hangs out at the water fountain talking to her friends.  She
takes an extra long coffee break.  She leaves early for lunch, and comes
back late.  She's unproductive in the afternoon, spending much of her time
calling her friends and telling them how miserable she feels.  She takes
some more aspirin and leaves early.
The boss takes note of this.  His mind is made up.
So the next day, the boss calls Jill into his office.  He tells her, "Jill,
you know I either have to lay you or Jack off."
And she replies, "Well, you're going to have to jack off because *I've* got
a headache."

Three married couples, aged 20,30,40 years old, want to join the Orthodox 
Church of Sexual Repression.  Near the end of the interview, the priest
informs them that before they can be accepted they will have to pass one 
small test.  They will have to abstain from all sex for a month.  They all 
agree to try.

A month later they are having their final interview with the cleric.  He 
asks the 40 year old couple how they did.  "Well, it wasn't too hard.  I 
spent a lot of time in the workshop and she has a garden so we had plenty 
of other things to do.  We did OK." the husband said.

"Very good, my children.  You are welcome in the Church.  And how well did 
you manage?", he asked the 30 year old couple.

"It was pretty difficult", the husband answered.  "We thought about it all 
the time.  We had to sleep in different beds and we prayed a lot.  But we 
were celibate for the entire month."

"Very good, my children.  You are welcome in the Church.  And how about
you?", he asked the 20 year old couple.

"Not too good, I'm afraid, Father.  We did OK for the first week.", he said 
sheepishly.  "By the second week we were going crazy with lust.  Then one 
day during the third week my wife dropped a head of lettuce and when she 
bent over to pick it up, I... I weakened and took her right there."

"I'm sorry my son, you are not welcome in the Church"

"Yeah, and we're not too welcome at the grocery anymore either"

A man went to Confession and said to the priest : "Forgive me, Father.
I used the F-word this week."

"Ah, my son.  Tell me the circumstances which caused you to use the F-word.
After all, I can understand a person being provoked into using it."

"Well, I was golfing and I had just hit a beautiful tee-shot that sailed
straight as an arrow for 280 yards, but then suddenly sliced into the
woods."

"That is when you used the F-word.  I can appreciate your frustration,
my son, as I am a golfer myself."

"No, I stayed cool at that point, Father.  I then hit a perfect shot
out of the woods, but suddenly it landed in the sand trap."

"Now, I can understand you saying the F-word at that point."

"No, Father, I was calm even then.  I got out my sand wedge and hit a
perfect shot out of the trap right at the pin, but suddenly the ball
stopped an inch from the cup."

"Ah, that is when you used the F-word.  How frustrating."

"No, Father, I was still cool."

"YOU MEAN YOU MISSED THE FUCKING PUTT?!?!??!"

A Persian in the market in old jerusalem buys a packet of
pecan nuts. He hands one to his wife, who is dutifully following him
around. After a while, she asks for another.
"What for?", he replies, "They all taste the same".

An elderly English couple, the wife rather deaf, were visiting New York.
They hail a cab and start out on a lengthy journey.  It being New York, it
isn't long before the driver starts talking.

Driver: You're limeys, aren't you?
Man:    Aye, we are
Wife:   What did he say?
M: He asked if we were English and I said we were
W: Ah

D: I was in England, during the war
M: Oh aye
W: What did he say?
M: He said he was in England during the war
W: Ah

D: I was in Burnley, in Lancashire. You know it?
M: Yes, that's where we come from
W: What did he say?
M: He said he was in England during the war - near Burnley
W: Ah

D: Do you know a patch of woodland just south of Burnley?
M: Aye, I know it
W: What did he say?
M: He asked if we knew the woods south of Burnley and I said we did
W: Ah

D: You know, it was in those woods, during the war, I had the worst 
   fuck I've ever had in my entire life.
W: What did he say?
M: He says he knows you.

There were these two dogs in a vet's waiting room, each eyeing the
other suspiciously. One of them turns to the other.

"What are you here for?" he asks.

"Well," replies the other, "I was feeling really bad the other day,
and Master's six year old son started bothering me. I tried to ignore
it, but I was feeling so rotten that I bit his hand off."

"I don't blame you. So, what are you here for?"

"Erm... well... Master reckons that I'm too vicious, so I'm going to
be... you know... I'm going to have the *operation*..."

"Oh dear. I'm sorry," sympathised the first dog.

Time passed. The about-to-be-neutered dog coughed politely.

"So," he asked, "What are you in here for?"

"Oh, nothing really," the other replied, embarrassed.

"Go on, tell me. Please..."

"OK. Well, it's like this. The bitch next door was in heat, and so I
was feeling... you know, a bit randy. Then Mistress came into the
kitchen wearing a short skirt and no underwear, and she bent over. I
just couldn't resist it!" admitted the dog.

"Oh, so you're here for the operation too, then."

"No," came the reply, "I'm here to have my nails clipped!"

A man walks into a cake shop, goes up to the counter and asks for a doughnut.
The assistant picks up a pair of silver tongs, retrieves a doughnut and 
places it on a dish. 

The customer says to the assistant "That's very hygenic using a pair of tongs
to pick up the cake!"
"Oh yes sir. This is a very clean shop."
"Well in that case I think I'll also have a choclolate eclair too."

So the assistant picks up the silver tongs and retrieves a chocolate eclair.
While he's doing this the customer looks down and notices a piece of
string sticking out the trouser fly of the assistant.
"What's the string for?" asks the customer.

"Well sir, it's such a hygenic shop that if I want to go to the toilet
I must pull out my willy with the string. That way I don't touch it with
my hands."
The customer thought for a moment and said "Well how do you put it back
in then?"

"Oh that's easy," said the assistant "I use the tongs, silly!"

Apparently this woman's minature schnauzer had an infection
in its ear.  The vet told her that it was due to an ingrown
hair and that the best treatment would be to remove the
hair with a depilatory cream.  The women went to a drug store
and asked the druggist for assistance in selecting an
appropriate product.  He went on about how some were better
for use on legs and how some were gentler and better for
removing facial hair.  He then said "May I ask where you
intend to use this?"

She replied "Well, it's for my schnauzer."

He said "OK, but you shouldn't ride a bike for two weeks."

"I cannot throw away the old one..."

One day a nun was fishing and caught a huge fish for supper.  A man was walking
by and said "Wow what a goddamn fish!"  The sister said "Sir you shouldn't talk
to me like that: I'm a nun", and the man said "But that's the name of it:
a goddamn fish".  So the sister took the fish back to the rectory and said
"Mother superior, look at the goddamn fish I caught."  The mother superior
said "Sister, you shouldn't talk like that!", and the sister said "But mother
superior, that's the name of it: a goddamn fish".  So the mother superior said
"Well give me the goddamn fish and I'll clean it."  While she was cleaning the
fish the monsignor walked in and she said "Monsignor look at the goddamn fish
that the sister caught."  The monsignor said "Mother superior you shouldn't
talk like that!", and the mother superior said "But that's the name of it:
a goddamn fish".  So the monsignor said "Well give me the goddamn fish and
I'll cook it".  That evening at supper there was a new priest at the table,
and he said  "Wow what a nice fish".   And the sister said "I caught the
goddamn fish."  And mother superior said "I cleaned the goddamn fish".  And
the monsignor said "I cooked the goddamn fish".  And the new priest said:

An old man gets on a crowded bus and no one gives him a seat.  
As the bus shakes and rattles, the old man's cane slips on the floor and
he falls.  As he gets up, a seven year old kid, sitting nearby, turns to
him and says, "If you put a little rubber thingy on the end of your stick,
it wouldn't slip."
The old man snaps back: "Well, if your daddy did the same thing seven
years ago, I would have a seat today."

A native went to his first cricket match and described it
to his witchdoctor after he got back.
	He said "It was a beautiful sunny Sunday. A big
crowd of people gathered around this giant grass field
with a thin strip of mowed and flattened pitch in the middle.
There were three sticks at either end of the strip.
A man in a long overcoat came out with two men in sweaters
and he tossed a coin in to the air. They went out and out
came eleven men in sweaters and white pants. One of them was padded
and had big gloves. Then out came two men with pads on their legs 
and small gloves holding big sticks. They took positions at
either end of the strip and one of the other men came running
towards the wickets and threw this ball at the person holding
the stick. And lo and behold it started to pour.

 Two guys, Stan and Ed, were working a construction job digging a
ditch. The foreman was at them all the time to keep busy. No breaks, just work,
work, work! Finally it dawned on the two guys that the foreman left every day
at 3:00 in the afternoon. So they decided to start leaving at 3:15.
 The very next day when the foreman left at 3:00, Stan and Ed left at 3:15.
 Stan goes home, walks through the house, opens the bedroom door, and there
on the bed is his wife and the foreman. Stan quickly runs back to the job and 
digs like mad until 5:00. The next day when Ed arrives at work, Stan says,
 "Listen Ed, we can't knock off work any more at 3:15...  I almost got caught!"

NEW INFANTS MIRACLE DIET FOR OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE 

  Flabby Americans are always on the look out for a new diet.  The trouble
with most diets is that you don't get enough to eat (the starvation diet) or
you don't get enough variation (the liquid diet) or you go broke (the all-meat
diet). 

  Consequently, people tend to cheat on their diets, or quit after three days,
or go right back to stuffing their faces after it is all over.  Is there
nothing you can do but give up and tell your friends that you've got a gland
problem?  Or is there a slim hope? Such is the Infants' Miracle Diet. 

  Over the years, you may have noticed, as I have, that most two-year olds are
trim.  It came to me one day over a cup of black coffee and a carrot that
perhaps their diet is the reason.  After consultation with pediatricians,
X-ray technicians and distraught mothers, I was able to formulate this new
diet.  It is inexpensive, offers great variety and sufficient quantity. 
Before embarking on the diet however, be sure to check with your doctor,
otherwise you might have to see him afterward. 


FIRST DAY: 

  Breakfast:  One scrambled egg, one peice of toast with grape jelly. Eat two
bites of egg, using your fingers; dump the rest on the floor.  Take one bite
of toast, then smear the jelly over your face and clothes. Lunch: Four crayons
(any color), a handful of potato chips, and a glass of milk (three sips only,
then spill the rest). Dinner: A dry stick, two pennies and a nickle, four sips
of stale beer. Before Bedtime, toast a piece of bread and toss it on the
kitchen floor. 


SECOND DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Pick up stale toast off kitchen floor and eat.  Drink half
bottle of vanilla extract or one vial of vegetable dye. Lunch: Half a tube of
Pulsating Pink Lipstick, and a cigarette (to be eaten not smoked).  Ice cube
if desired. After lunch, lick an all day sucker until sticky, take it outside
and drop it in the dirt.  Retrieve it and continue slurping until it is clean
again.  Bring it inside and drop it on the rug. Dinner: A rock or and an
uncooked bean, which should be thrust up your left nostril.  Pour iced tea
over mashed potatoes; eat with spoon. 


THIRD DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Two pancakes with plenty of syrup, eat with fingers, rub fingers
in hair.  Glass of milk, drink one-half, stuff pancakes in glass.  After
breakfast pick up sucker from rug, lick off fuzz and put on cushion of your
best chair. Lunch: Three matches, peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Spit
several bites onto the floor.  Pour milk on table and slurp up. Dinner: dish
of ice cream, handful of potato chips, some wine, coffee. 


LAST DAY: 

  Breakfast: a quarter tube of toothpaste (any flavor), bit of soap, an olive,
pour glass of milk over bowl of cornflakes, add 1/2 cup sugar.  When cereal is
soggy, drink milk and feed cereal to dog. Lunch: Eat crumbs off kitchen floor

Two ex-World War II American Generals were sat in a hotel bar, late at night,
reminiscing over the old days.

The first used to be in the Army, while the second spent his active service
in the Navy. The first general insisted that the Army had the greatest
reputation when it came to women, and that he had slept with hundreds during
the war. However, the second was claiming that the Navy had, by far, the
most virile young men, and that he has slept with more women than the first
General.

"Hoss-piss!!" said the first man "I jest know I's a slept with mow women than
youse!"

"Sheeeeet No!! - I know for a fact that I have!"

"Ok then, when did you last sleep with a woman?" said the first General.

"About nineteen forty-five" said the other.

"You call that VIRILE!! Geez, you're practically CELIBATE!"

So the second general looked at his watch and said "Well don't forget it is
only twenty-one thirty now."

A Belgian, Hans, meets one of his French friends, Pierre, in the

Hans:	"Hi, Pierre! I haven't seen you for a long time! How are you?
		And your son, what is he doing now?"
Pierre:	"He is studying logic."

Pierre: "It is a new, very good school in Paris.  Ok, here is an

Paddy the Irishman is on holiday with his girlfriend in Las Vegas.
One night they, after paying a fortune for tickets, they go out to
a club where, as paddy assures his friend, they will mingle with
the stars. Sure enough the place is full of stars, and everyone
seems to know everyone else with "Hiya Madonna" and "how do Clint"
all over the place.

Paddy's girlfriend is decidedly unimpressed that Paddy knows none of
these stars, and nobody is interested in talking to them. On a visit
to the toilet Paddy finds himself standing beside Frank Sinatra.
Paddy explains the problem to him, tells him that he has been a
fan for years and has all the records and asks him to help him out.

All he has to do is walk past Paddy's table and shout "Howya Paddy".
Frank is in a good mood so agrees to do this.

Twenty minutes later sure enough Frank walks up to the table where
Paddy and his girlfriend are sitting alone talking. "Howya Paddy"
shouts Frank. Paddy turns round and says "Will you ever f**k off Frank,
can't you see that I'm talking to my girlfriend?"

	Computer Stories from a Field Service Engineer
        ---------------------------------------------

When I worked for a company that had a contract with 3M, 3M had asked me
to write them a memo describing why we were having problems with diskette
failures.  I said in the memo that the disks were failing due to head
crashes.  "If the customers would just clean their heads periodically, we
wouldn't have these problems," I said in the memo.  One customer responded
with "What kind of shampoo do you recommend?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An end-user hotline received a call about a bad software disk.  They asked
the customer to make a copy of the disk and mail it in to the hotline.
A few days later, they received a letter with a mimeographed copy of
the disk.  Since it was a double-sided disk, both sides of the disk
had been xeroxed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Computer Operator says as she is lifting an RP06 disk pack from the drive:
"Gee, how much does one of these weigh?"
Me: "It depends on how much data is on the disk....
The operator believed it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	I had a similar experience while working as a student operator at
Michigan Tech. One particularly trying afternoon, the computer was merrily
crashing for a number of reasons. After about four such spectacles, we
broadcast that the computer would be down for the remainder of the afternoon.
There was a resigned groan from the users and they began to file out of the
Center, except for one comely young woman with wide blue eyes who wandered up
to the counter and queried:
	"What's wrong with the computer?"
Too tired and irritated to give her a straight answer, I looked her straight 
in the eye and replied: "Broken muffler belt."
A look of deep concern wafted into her expression as she asked:
	"Oh, that's bad. Can you call Midas?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I work for University Computing Services answering questions about any and all
aspects of computing here, and as a result I run into some truly astonishing
mental densities...  A few excerpts from the Helpdesk:
Caller: "What's the name for when you're entering data into the computer?"
    HD: "Data Entry."
Caller: "Thank you!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overheard in a student computer lab:
Client (raising hand and waving frantically): "The computer says 'Enter your
name and press RETURN.'  What do I do??"
Lab Assistant: "Enter your name and press RETURN."
Client (as if a revelation has struck): "Oh!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another friend of mine in a similar situation reports having a student in the
lab one day, who had to abort out of the SET PASSWORD sequence because he 
couldn't think of a six-letter word.

A woman goes to a doctor with a problem.

She's sat on the chair next to the doctor, and she's very
hesitant about describing her problem. Eventually the doctor 
manages to discover that she thinks she may be sexually
perverted.

"What sort of perversion are you talking about?" asks
the doctor.

"Well," said the woman "I like to be..............ohh....
.....ah....ummm....I'm sorry doctor, but I'm too ashamed
to talk about it."

"Come, come, my dear. I'm a doctor you know; I've been trained
to understand these problems. So what's the matter......?"

So the woman again tried to explain, but got so embarrased that
she just turned bright red, and looked as though she might faint.

It was then the doctor had a bright idea: "Look," he said "I'm
a bit of a pervert myself. So if you show me what your perversion
is, I'll show you what mine is. Ok? Is it a deal?"

The woman considered the offer, and after a short while agreed
that it was a fair request. So after a slight pause she said:
"Well my perversion is.......my perversion.......oh......I like
to be kissed on the bottom!"

"Shit Is that ALL!" said the doctor. "Look, go behind that screen,
take all your clothes off, and I'll come round and show you what MY
perversion is! Hee Hee!"

So the woman does as she is told, and undresses behind the screen.
She gets down on all fours thinking to herself "Hmmmm, perhaps he
might kiss me on the bum."

Anyway, 15 minutes pass and nothing has happened. So the woman peers
around the side of the screen to see the doctor sat behind his desk,
his feet up on the table, reading a newspaper and whistling to himself.

"Hey!" shouted the woman "I thought you said you were a pervert?"

"Oh I am," said the doctor "I've just shit in your handbag."

Teamwork
========

There are four people named
Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody.

There was an important job to be done and
Everybody was asked to do it.

Everybody was sure Somebody would do it
Anybody could have done it, but
Nobody did it.
Somebody got angry about that, because it
was Everybody's job.
Everybody thought Anybody could do it but
Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.

It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody
when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.

 answer?!" The old Jew says: "Son, the next stop is the last on
 this route.  I don't know you, so you must be a stranger.  If I
 answer you now, I'll have to invite you to my home.  You're hand-

Three men sitting around a campfire telling stories.  The conversation

First man: There's a guy who lives up the street from me who used to
work in construction.  One day last year his hand got run over by a
bulldozer.  Whatever those doctors did, it's really amazing - today
he's a concert pianist.

Second man: That's nothing.  I knew a guy in college - laziest bum I
ever knew.  He was really fat and out of shape.  He was trying to
hitch a ride one day and got hit by a truck.  Broke nearly every damn
bone in his body.  Somehow they put him back together better than he
was before.  Now he's a triathlete and he's planning to try out for
the olympics.

Third man: Yeah, well I knew this poor retarded kid.  He couldn't do a
whole lot, but someone at the dynamite factory got charitable and gave
him a job as a stockboy.  Anyways, he's working in the warehouse one
day and gets locked in.  It's dark and he can't find the door.  Not
being too bright, he lit a match to try and find his way.  The whole
place exploded.  All they could find of him was his asshole and his
eyebrows.  From that little bit they were able to put him back
together and today that kid is the governor of Massachusetts.

A man marries a JEG/KfS [Joke Ethnic Group/Known for Stupidity] woman and
all is well for a time.  And, as such things happen, they eventually are
going to have a baby.

The woman's time comes, and as she is taken into the operating room, she
calls he husband over and says to him:  

"Honey, there's something I really have to tell you."

"Can't this wait" says the husband.

"No", explains the wife.  "There is as an very old tradition in JEG/KfS
families that the oldest living male *always* gets to name any new children
born to anyone in the family.  That means my brother must name our
children.  I know this comes as a shock, but I couldn't tell you earlier,
because I didn't want to upset you."

"But, but..." sputters the husband "I *know* your brother.  There's no
question but that he'll screw this up!"

"I'm sorry" says the wife, "but that's the way it has to be."

Time is getting short, and not wanting to upset his wife any further, the
husband finally relents.  The blessed time comes, and to every one's
surprise the mother gives birth to a set of healthy, beautiful twins, a boy
and a girl.  The father is of course delighted, but his happiness is
tempered by the question he knows he must ask his wife.  Finally, he can
put it off no longer.

"Alright" he asks, taking a deep breath, "what did your brother name our
daughter?"

"Denise" says the mother, quietly.

"Oh", says the surprised father.  "That's a pretty name.  Perhaps this
won't be so bad after all.  What did he name our son?"

"Denephew."

gallops away into the distance.
The zoo keeper says, "What did you do?". The woman says, "I tickled his
testicles". The zoo keeper says, "Well, tickle mine, I've got to catch

It's christmas time, and the postman rings at the door for an urgent letter.
She opens the door, asking for his request. Taking the letter, she said:
"Come in, postman.  I'll give you coffee and a good breakfast".
So he came in, took the meal. When he was ready, she said:
"Come on, let's go to bed now."  The postman was excited, went with her to 
bed, and they had fun together. Afterwards, the woman gave him a dollar-note.
So he said:" What the hell is the reason, you made breakfast for me, went to
bed with me, and know giving me a dollar? I suppose the rest was enough!"
And she answered: "It is X-mas, and I asked my husband, what shall we give
the mailman. And he said 'FUCK HIM, GIVE M A DOLLAR!'
But the breakfast was my idea...."

A man is driving down a deserted stretch of highway, when he notices
a sign out of the corner of his eye.  It says SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE
OF PROSTITUTION 10 MILES.  He thinks it was just a figment of his
imagination and drives on without a second thought.  Soon, he sees
another sign which says SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 5
MILES and realizes that these signs are for real.  When he drives
past a third sign saying SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION NEXT
RIGHT, his curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the
drive.  
 
On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a
small sign next to the door reading SISTERS OF MERCY.  He climbs the
steps and rings the bell.  The door is answered by a nun in a long black
habit who asks "What may we do for you, my son?"  He answers "I saw your
signs along the highway, and was interested in possibly doing buisness."
 "Very well, my son.  Please follow me." 
 
He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. 
The nun stops at a closed door, and tells the man "Please knock on this
door." He does as he is told and this door is answered by another nun in
a long habit and holding a tin cup.  This nun instructs "Please place
$50 in the cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this
hallway."  He gets $50 out of his wallet and places it in the second
nun's cup.  He trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door,
pulling it shut behind him.  As the door locks behind him, he finds
himself back in the parking lot, facing another small sign: GO IN PEACE,
YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY.

A young sub-altern was posted to a British army detachment in the
desert.  On his tour of the facility with the master sergent, he 
noticed a group of camels.  "What are those for?" "The men use them
when they want to have sex..." "Don't say another word, sergent.  
That is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard.  Get rid of 
those camels immediately!" "Yes, sir."

A few weeks went by and the young officer began to get rather
horny.  He called the sergent over and asked "Where are the camels
we used to have?"  The sergent replied that he had sold them to a
Bedouin that camped nearby.  "Take me to them, please."

The officer and the sergent went over to the Bedouin camp and
found the camels.  The officer told the sergent to leave him alone
with the camels, then picked out the most attractive one, and 
proceeded to have sex with the camel.

On the way back to the camp, the officer asked, "Sergeant, do the men
actually enjoy sex with the camels?"  The sergent looked at the 
officer in astonishment and exclaimed, "I don't know!  They use them
to ride into town where the girls are!"

"I'm sorry, but that won't do.  For such an amount of money you'd better jack
off around the corner."
A couple of minutes later the doorbell rings again.
"Yes?"
"You forgot the $10.  Here you are."

Taking him aside after class one day, she asked, "George, why has your school
work been so poor lately?"
    "I'm in love," the boy replied.
    Holding back an urge to smile, she asked, "With whom?"
    "With you," he said.
    "But George," she said gently, "don't you see how silly that is?  It's
true that I would like a husband of my own someday.  But I don't want a child."
     "Oh, don't worry," the boy said reassuringly, "I'll use a rubber."

The patient shook his doctor's hand in gratitude and said:
"Since we are the best of friends, I would not want to insult you by
offering payment.  But I would like for you to know that I had mentioned
you in my will."
"That is very kind of you," said the doctor emotionally, and then added,
"Can I see that prescription I just gave you?  I'd like to make a little
change..."

A circus owner walked into a bar to see everyone crowded about a table
watching a little show.  On the table was an upside down pot and a duck
tap dancing on it.  The circus owner was so impressed that he offered to 
buy the duck from its owner.  After some wheelin' and dealin' they settled
for $10000 for the duck and the pot.
Three days later the circus owner runs back to the bar in anger,
"Your duck is a ripoff!  I put him on the pot before a whole audience and
he didn't dance a single step!"
"So?" asked the ducks former owner, "did you remember to light the candle
under the pot?"

There once was a priest who had to spend the night in a hotel and offered 
hat check girl to come up to his room for dinner.  After a while he started
advancing on her when she stopped him and reminded him he was a holy man.
"It's o.k.," he replied, "it's written in the Bible."
So after a wild night of you-know-what the hat check girl asked to see where
in the Bible it says it's okay.
The priest picks up the Bible off the dresser opens to the first page where
someone wrote in pencil - "The hat check girl puts out!"

On the steps of this church two pan handlers were doing their daily business.
One wore a large cross on his chest and the other - a star of David.
Of course, most of the church goers generously gave to the cross wearer and
the other was overlooked.  Finally the Pastor approached the Jew and 
suggested that if he take off the star of David maybe he'd get some more
hand outs.
"Get this guy," laughs the pan handler and turns to his cross wearing pal,
"Trying to teach *us* how to do business!"

A good looking chick walked into an orchard and found a lovely pool in it, 
and decided to swim.  She looked around, didn't see anyone, and undressed.
Just as she was about to dive in, the watchman appeared from behind the
bush where he was hiding all along and told her that swimming was prohibited.
-"You could have told me that before I undressed!" she scoulded him.
-"Hey! Only swimming is prohibited, undressing isn't" he replied.

A young french girl was visiting New York when her cash funds run dry and
her visa expired.  She met a sailor who agreed to stow her aboard his ship
that was about to sail.  Every day he would bring her food and drink and 
in return all she had to do was give him a bit of love, lacking much choice 
the girl agreed.
And so everyday the sailor brought some food and would get some loving in 
return.  This went on for several weeks until the captain saw the sailor 
sneaking around with a tray of food and the whole affair was uncovered.
The captain felt obliged to apologize to the girl:
"I'm very sorry about all that has happened to you, but you have to admit
the sailor is smart.  Do you know you're on the Staten Island Ferry?"

A biology graduate student went to Borneo to take some samples for his
thesis work.  He flew there, found a guide with a canoe to take him up the
river to the remote site he where he would make his collections.  About noon
on the second day of travel up the river they began to hear drums.  Being a
city boy by nature, the biologist was disturbed by this.  He asked the guide,
"What are those drums"  The guide turned to him and said "Drums OK, but 
VERY BAD when they stop."

Well the biologist settled down a little at this, and things went
reasonably well for about two weeks.  Then, just as they were 
packing up the camp to leave, the drums suddenly stopped!  This hit the 
biologist like a ton of bricks (to coin a phrase), and he yelled at the guide

		"The Drums have stopped, What happens now?"

The guide crouched down, covered his head with his hands and said

				"Bass Solo"

A man approaches his best friend's wife one day when her husband is at the
office.  "Will you have sex with me?" he asks.
"No. My husband wouldn't approve."
"O.K. What if I give you $1000?"
"Well, for a $1000 I think I will.  Come back tomorrow afternoon when my
husband is at work."

So the man shows up next day and slaps $1000 on the table and they do 
whatever it was they did(!!!).  In the evening her husband comes home a
little distraught:
"Was my best friend here today?" 
"Y-y-yes." his wife says with concern.
"And did he leave $1000?"
"Y-y-yes." she says expecting the worst.

"Oh good, what a great pal he is.  He came in this morning and asked if he
could borrow $1000 from me and promised to return it this afternoon!"

Once upon a time, the vicar was walking in the vicarage garden when he
came to a lily pond. There was a little green frog sitting by the
pond.
	"My, my, you're a nice little green frog, aren't you?" said
the vicar.
	"I'm not really a little green frog" said the little green
frog. "I'm really a choirboy, but a wicked witch put an evil curse on
me, and turned me into a little green frog. The only way I can be
turned back into a choirboy is if some kind mortal were to take me and
put me in their bed for a whole night; then I would be restored to my
former state."
	So the vicar, being a kindly sort, took the little green frog,
and he placed it in his bed for a whole night, and in the morning, lo
and behold, the little green frog was restored to his original form as
a choirboy, and they all lived happily ever after.

And that Milord is the case for the defense.

Andy wants a job as a signalman on the railways. He is told to meet the
inspector at the signal box. The inspector puts this question to him:
"What would you do if you realised that 2 trains were heading for each 
other on the same track?"

Andy says,"I would switch the points for one of the trains."

"What if the lever broke?" asked the inspector.

"Then I'd dash down out of the signal box," said Andy,"and I'd use the manual
lever over there."

"What if that had been struck by lightning?"

"Then," Andy continues,"I'd run back into the signal box and phone the next
signal box."

"What if the phone was engaged?"

"Well in that case," persevered Andy,"I'd rush down out of the box and use 
the public emergency phone at the level crossing up there."

"What if that was vandalised?"

"Oh well then I'd run into the village and get my uncle Silas."

This puzzles the inspector, so he asks, "Why would you do that?"      

Came the answer, "Because he's never seen a train crash."

On an airplane (probably in the first class) a man says to the
stewardess 'I'll give you $5000 if I can bite your breast'. The
stewardess is scared and goes to the captain and tells him about this.
But the captain says '$5000? Why not? Go for it!'. So she sits on the
man's lap and he starts undressing her, touching her, fundling her,
kissing her ... (you name it). After ten minutes (or so) the stewardess
becomes impatient and says 'Would you please bite my breast now?'
But the man says 'Oh no, that's too expensive'.

An <ethnic> couple decided to stay at a very exclusive, WASP only
hotel for a night.  The manager immediately recognized them for
what they are but could not throw them out, instead he decided
to be clever.  In the morning the couple came to settle the bill
and were surprized to find they owe $3000.

'How's this? We've only been here one night!' the man was annoyed.

'So?', said the manager, 'this is a very expensive hotel.  We have
golf courts, tennis courts, swimming pools, exercise rooms, bars
and restaurants, all this is very expensive to keep up.'

'But we didn't use any of these!' explained the couple.

'If you didn't use - that's your problem.' came the reply.

'In that case, you owe me $2000. You see, my wife is a call girl
who charges $5000 a night, so please settle your bill.'  said the
man.

'What do you mean?', the manager was taken off guard, 'I didn't
sleep with your wife!'

at one end.
man:	<FART> Oh my God! <FART> What are you going to do with <FART> that ?!
Doctor:	I need to open a window.

Once there was this white elementary teacher of an all <ethnic> class.
Thinking she would be cute; she announced to the class; "Every Thursday
afternoon we will have a quiz. And, If any of you get the answer correct
the entire class can have Friday off."

The class murmers with excitement.

"OK, class", she announces, "How many grains of sand on the Sahara Desert?".
The class murmers in dissapointment as they look to each other for help.
"Ok, class, see you tomorrow", announces the teacher.

Later the next week.
"OK, class time for our weekly quiz, now try real hard. How many gallons of
water in the Atlantic ocean?", asks the teach.
And again the class murmers in disappointment.

Well, there is little Gregory pondering this problem. As the end of
the next week rolls around he takes two of his brothers marbles and sneaks
into his fathers shop to spray paint them black.

As test time rolls around the teacher says, "Time for our little weekly
quiz, children". At which, Gregory takes the black marbles from his pocket
and rolls them toward the front of the class.
"OK, who's the comedian with the black balls?" shouts the teacher.
"Bill Cosby. See Ya on Monday", retorts Gregory.

large house.

"Good day, sir. I was wondering if you had any painting you
need done." 

The owner of the house, a rich man by any standard, looks
speculatively at the painter. He perceives a vibrant
entrepreneurial spirit, which reminds him of his own ambition
in his younger days.

"Hmmm. Yes, I think my porch needs a coat or two of paint."

The eager young painter rushes off around the side of the house...

Several hours later, he returns to the front door, his clothes
dripping paint, and knocks again.

"Sir, I've finished! But I have to tell you, that wasn't a porch, it

Old west... A bar... All of a sudden, the door opens with a kick, and
a cowboy in black enters... Black hat, black foulard, black shirt,
black trousers, black boots, black gloves, black belt, and a black
pair of guns...

Everyone looks at him with fearful eyes. He approaches the barman, and
asks:

   "Do you have a bucket?"

Barman runs inside, finds a wooden bucket, comes back. The cowboy in
black lookes to the bucket, and orders:

   "Now, bring me three bottles of whisky."

Seconds later:

   "Pour them into the bucket."

And, then:

   "And now, bring this to my horse outside."

The frightened and surprised barman does what the cowboy in black
tells.

He finds a horse, black as night, tied in front of the bar, completely
in black harness. It drinks all the whisky at once.

Then the barman returns back inside the bar. The cowboy very carefully
looks into the bucket, sees that nothing is left, and asks:

   "What do I owe for this?"

Barman, while calculating the price, asks:

   "Won't you drink anything?"

The cowboy in black replies:

   "No. I don't drink and drive."

There was a man who had been stranded on a desert island for the last
twenty years, when all of a sudden a beatiful girl steps up from the see,
wearing a wet suit.
She: "Would you like a cigarette?"
He:  "Sure" (he takes one from the wet-suit, light it, and smokes it)
She: "Would you like a martini?"
He:  "Sure" (he gets the very special 007 shaken, not stirred, martini from her
wet suit)
Then she says, with a strange gleam in her eye: "Would you like to play around"
He:  "I don't believe that you have got a set of golf clubs in there!"

Then she shows him $100.25

Honeymoon. Walking down 42nd Street they saw a sign advertising "The Great
Gonzo" outside a theater and decided to give the show a try.

So into the theater they went. There was a fanfare and The Great Gonzo came
out on stage. He was a young man dressed only in a bathrobe. He opened the
robe to show the biggest and hardest erection imaginable. Then he clapped his
hands and a young woman emerged pushing a cart on the top of which were three
walnuts. The Great Gonzo took his erect member in his hand and, one by one,
smashed the walnuts to the thunderous applause of the audience.

This year the couple decided to celebrate their 40th anniversary with a second
honeymoon in New York City. While walking down 42nd Street they once again saw
the sign advertising The Great Gonzo. With a bit of surprise they decided to
check out the show again. Once they were in the theater the fanfare played and
Gonzo, now an old man, appeared in his bathrobe. He opened the robe and there
was the erection, as big and hard as ever.

This time when he clapped his hands, his now-aged assistant appeared with a
cart on which were three coconuts. To thunderous applause, he used his member
to smash each of them.

The couple couldn't resist going up to Gonzo after the show. They explained
that they had seem him 40 years earlier.

"But why," they asked, "did you switch from walnuts to coconuts?"

"Well," he replied, "when you get old your eyes start to go."

  There is a story about the first Polish astronauts in space.  One of them
went out for a space walk and came back and knocked on the spaceship
door.  The other astronaut said "Who is it?"

  A man was sitting at home with his wife and they were watching TV.  He
was a chain-smoker and suddenly runs out of his cigarettes.  He says to
his wife: "I'm going to the bar to get some more cigarettes".
  At the bar he sees this gorgeous and attractive girl.  They start to
talk and then they decide that he will go home with her.  There they
start f*cking each other.  Suddenly the man looks at the clock: "Hey,
its 0:30.  Time for me to go home".
  He dressed, runs for the door, stop and says: "Do you have any talcum
powder?"
	"Yes.  Why?"
	"Sprinkle a little talcum on my hands"
She sprinkles a little talcum on his hands, then he went to his wife.
She YELLS:	"Where the hell have you been?"
	"Well, I went to the bar, met this girl, went with her to her
house where we made love to each other"
  She looks at his hands.  "Don't lie to me.  You met the boys and went
bowling with them.  I can see the talcum powder."

Once upon a time, there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to
fly south for the winter.  However, soon after the weather turned cold,
the sparrow changed his mind and reluctantly started to fly south.
After a short time, ice began to form his on his wings and he fell to
earth in a barnyard almost frozen.  A cow passed by and crapped on this
little bird and the sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure
warmed him and defrosted his wings.  Warm and happy the little sparrow
began to sing.  Just then, a large Tom cat came by and hearing the
chirping investigated the sounds.  As Old Tom cleared away the manure,
he found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.

There are three morals to this story:

1)      Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily your enemy.

2)      Everyone who gets you out of shit is not necessarily your
        friend.

3)      If you are warm and happy in a pile of shit, keep your mouth
        shut.

  Sister Catherine is asking all the Catholic school children in fourth
grade what whey want to be when they grow up.  Little Sheila says:
"When I grow up, I want to be a prostitute!" Sister Catherine's eyes
grow wide and she barks:  "What the (beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb) did you say?"
"A prostitute!" Sheila repeats.
Sister Catherine breathes a sight of relief and says:  "Thank God!  I

Two English yuppies notice that an Irishman of all creatures has
decided to visit their local pub. They decide to convince themselves
that this guy is indeed as stupid as their prejudices would have it,
and that in a - shall we say - rather intimidating fashion... So one
of them walks up to him and says :

- Say Paddy, did you know that St. Patrick was a %$&$@@ ?
- No, says the Irishman, but thanks for telling me.
- Paddy, did you also know that he was a &^%&$*%@@!!% ?
- No, repeats the Irishman, but thanks for telling me.
- And did you know that he was a big &^*&^ son of a $#%$#%$##$%%^ ?
- No, says the Irishman, but thanks for telling me.

The other yah walks up to the Irish guy and tries to finish it all
off.

- And Paddy, did you know that your beloved St. Patrick was ENGLISH ?
- Well, no - but your friend just told me.

One year at halloween the governor of Illinois was giving a costume party.
all the gentry were there and as they arrived the doorman would announce
what there characters were.

When one couple arrived he announced "Mickey and Minnie Mouse".

As the next couple arrived he announced "Tarzan and Jane"

and so on as each guest arrived.

Later in the evening a man arrived dressed only in a pair of underpants but
apart from that totally naked from head to toe.

"Who do you think you are?" demanded the doorman.  Having ascertained that
the man was indeed an invited guest from the local university CS department
The doorman asked "How shall I announce you?"

The man said, "I'm premature ejaculation"

"I'm very sorry sir" said the doorman in obvious shock I cannot announce
anything like that to such a gathering.

"O.K." said the professor.  "Just say I came in my pants"

Three seminarians about to undergo their final test before ordination were
taken by an old priest into a luxurious room, told to strip and then tie a
small bell around their organ.  Suddenly a ravishing girl entered the room,
an one bell ding-a-linged furiously.  "To the showers, Fogarty!" barked the
old priest.

Then, as the girl tantalizingly undressed, the father heard ding-a-ling,
ding-a-ling.

"Sorry about that, O'Brian.  The showers for you, too."

Finally alone with the naked lovely, the remaining seminarian watched as
the girl writhed seductively about him; yet he somehow remained calm and
the bell silent.

"Praise the Lord and congratulations, Featherstone!" the priest exulted.
"You made it!  Now go join those weaker souls in the showers."
   
   DING-A-LING.

A woman got on a bus holding a baby.

The busdriver said: "That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen."

In a huff, the woman slammed her fare into the fare box and
took an aisle seat near the rear of the bus.

The man seated next to her sensed that she was agitated and
asked her what was wrong.

"The busdriver insulted me" she fumed.

The man sympathized and said: "Why, he's a public servant and
shouldn't say things to insult passengers."

"You're right" she said.  "I think I'll go back up there and
give him a piece of my mind."

"That's a good idea" the man said.  "Here, let me hold your monkey."

			    Cartoon Laws
       Contributed by Trevor Paquette & Lt. Justin D. Baldwin


Cartoon Law I.

      Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made
        aware of its situation.

                Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.
                He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he
                chances to look down.  At this point, the familiar principle
                of 32 feet per second per second takes over.
  
Cartoon Law II.

     Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
        intervenes suddenly.

                Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon
                characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a
                telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward
                motion absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden
                termination of motion the stooge's surcease.
  
Cartoon Law III.

    Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
        conforming to its perimeter.

                Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
                speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of
                reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit
                directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-
                perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often
                catalyzes this reaction.
  
Cartoon Law IV.

     The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater
        than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the
        ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.

                Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture
                it inevitably unsuccessful.
  
Cartoon Law V.

      All principles of gravity are negated by fear.

                Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to
                propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky
                noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion
                upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or
                the crest of a flagpole.  The feet of a character who is
                running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch
                the ground, especially when in flight.
  
Cartoon Law VI.

     As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.

                This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in
                which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the
                cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously.  This
                effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or
                being throttled.  A 'wacky' character has the option of self-
                replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off
                walls to achieve the velocity required.
  
Cartoon Law VII.

    Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble
        tunnel entrances; others cannot.

                This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generation, but
                at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a
                wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue
                him into this theoretical space.  The painter is flattened
                against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting.
                This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.
  
Cartoon Law VIII.

   Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.

                Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional
                nine lives might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated,
                spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled,
                but they cannot be destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking
                self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.
  
   Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.

Cartoon Law IX.

     For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.

                This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also
                applies to the physical world at large.  For that reason,
                we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.

Cartoon Law X.

     Everything falls faster than an anvil.

		Examples too numerous to mention from the Roadrunner cartoons.

It seems this guy was an incurable practical joker, particularly when people
got married.  So when he got engaged he became very nervous and was constantly
looking out for retaliation.  But everything went smoothly.  No problems at
the wedding or the reception, and he and his bride left for their honeymoon.

After a long and wonderful night together they decide to use room service to
order breakfast.  He reaches for the phone:

    Happy groom: "This is room 435.  We'd like to order breakfast sent up."

    Room service: "For how many people?"

    Happy groom: "2"

    from under the bed: "Make it 5!"

There are three Jewish mothers bragging about their sons.  The first one
says "My son is very successful.  He is the best lawyer in New York City."
The second one says "My son has done better than that.  He is the best
Doctor in New York City."  The third one says "My son has not done that well.
He does not have a very good job, and he is homosexual.  But he has these two
great boyfriends....One is the best lawyer in New York City, and the other
is the best doctor in the city."

Reminds me of another story. A black man and a white man were discussing
God. The white man was certain that God was white, and the black man
equally sure that he was black. Eventually they decide to resolve the
matter once and all the next Sunday by praying in Church and asking God
directly.

So they do that. and to their surprise a great booming voice comes down
>from above, saying "I Am what I Am".

"There you are," said the white man, "that proves it. God is white."

"How come? All he said was 'I am what I am'."

"That's just it! If God is black he'd have said 'I Is what I Is.'."

A buxom blonde wore, at a charity ball, an enormous diamond. "It
happens to be the third most famous diamond in the whole world,"
she boasted. "The first is the Hope Diamond, then comes the

"What a diamond!"

"How lucky you are!"

"Wait, wait, nothing in life is all mazel ", said the diamonded

A poster in sci.astro asked why the moon appears larger on the horizon
than at the zenith.  The following responses appeared:

	(excerpts, revised)

	From:  brad@looking.UUCP (Brad Templeton)
	Date:  16 Aug 87
	Subject:  The real truth about the moon
	Newsgroups:  sci.astro

	Actually the moon appears so much larger because it is almost
	twice as close to you when on the horizon as it is when it is
	overhead.

	When the moon is on the horizon, it is attracted by all the mass
	of the Earth you see running from where you are standing to the
	point on the horizon where you see the moon.  Up above you,
	there is no mass of Earth between you and the moon, so the force
	is less.

	The massive force brings the moon much closer when it rises and
	sets.  As it gets higher, the force is less, and it moves
	further away.  Then it comes back in again.

	The moon is actually closest to the Earth when below the
	horizon, only you can't see it then.  Those of us on the other
	side of the Earth actually get a really good view.  Apollo
	reached the moon by leaving from the other side of the Earth
	when the moon was close.

	Of course, no one who lacks even a cursory knowledge of
	elementary physics can doubt that the above explanations have
	merit, but the primary effect is a physiological one.  As one
	tilts his head back to observe the moon at the zenith, the lens
	of the eye is flattened by gravity and its magnifying power is
	decreased.

Two tramps walking down a road feeling sorry for themselves since they've
had nothing to eat for 2 weeks.
Then one of them spots a dead dog lying by the side of the road. He rushes over to it, pulls of a leg and starts chewing. 
The other tramp looks on in disgust not wishing to join in on the feasting.
His friend looks up from his meal and asks, "Dont you want any?".
He says nothing, but screws up his face and turns away.
After his friend has eaten all he can they both continue on their journey down
the road.
They haven't gone far when the tramp who ate the dog throws up on the road.
His friend bends down and starts to eat the bits of meat in the sick.
The other tramp looks on in wonder and finally ask his friend, "I thought you
didn't like dead dog?".
"I do..", says the other tramp, "But only when it's warm!".

         There were two identical twin brothers by the name of Jones.
         John was married but Joe, the other brother was single and
         the owner of a small delapidated boat.

       It happened that the same day that John's wife died,Joe's boat sank.
       A kind old lady met Joe on the street and mistaking him for his  
       brother John, said, "Oh Mr. Jones, I'm sorry to hear of your great
       loss. You must feel terrible." Joe said, "Well, I'm not a bit sorry.
       She was rotten from the start. Her bottom was all chewed up; she 
       smelled of old fish even from the first time I got on her. She made
       water faster than anything I ever saw. She had a bad hole in the 
       front, and a big crack in the back. The hole kept getting bigger every
       time I used her. It got so I could handle her all right, but when
       anyone else used her, she leaked all over the place.
       What finished her, though, was four guys from the other side of town
       came over looking for a good time. They asked if they could use her 
       and I rented her, but warned them that she wasn't too hot. But they
       insisted that they would like to give her a try. The result was that  
       the crazy fools all tried to get into her at once. The strain was too
       much for her, she cracked right down the middle."  

	 The old lady fainted.

             'The World According to Student Bloopers'      

                        by Richard Lederer

                         St. Paul's School

 (Spring 1987, Verbatim, The Language Quarterly, Vol. XIII, No. 4)


    The inhabitants of ancient Egypt were called mummies.  They lived in
the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot.  The climate of the Sarah is
such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the
dessert are cultivated by irritation.  The Egyptians built the Pyramids in
the shape of a huge triangular cube.  The Pyramids are a range of mountains
between France and Spain.

    The Bible is full of interesting caricatures.  In the first book of
the Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.  One
of their children, Cain, once asked, "Am I my brother's son?"  God asked
Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma.  Jacob, son of Isaac, stole
his brother's birth mark.  Jacob was a patriarch who brought up his twelve
sons to be patriarchs, but they did not take to it.  One of Jacob's sons,
Joseph, gave refuse to the Israelites.

    Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.  Moses
led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread
made without any ingredients.  Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide
to get the ten commandments.  David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing
the liar.  He fought with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in
Biblical times.  Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500
porcupines.

    Without the Greeks we wouldn't have history.  The Greeks invented
three kinds of columns -- Corinthian, Doric, and Ironic.  They also had
myths.  A myth is a female moth.  One myth says that the mother of
Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx until he became intollerable.
Achilles appears in The Illiad, by Homer.  Homer also wrote the Oddity, in
which Penelope was the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey.
Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.

    Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people
advice.  They killed him.  Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.

    In the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits
and threw the java.  The reward to the victor was a coral wreath.  The
government of Athens was democratic because people took the law into their
own hands.  There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so high
that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing.
When they fought with the Persians, the Greeks were outnumbered because
the Persians had more men.

    Eventually, the Ramons conquered the Geeks.  History calls people
Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.  At Roman
banquets, the guests wore garlics in their hair.  Julius Caesar
extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.  The Ides of March
murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king.  Nero was
a cruel tyranny who would torture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle
to them.

    Then came the Middle Ages.  King Alfred conquered the Dames, King
Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harold mustarded his troops
before the Battle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard Shaw,
and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks.  Finally the
Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same
offense.

    In midevil times most of the people were alliterate.  The greatest
writer of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also
wrote literature.  Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow
through an apple while standing on his son's head.

    The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of
their human being.  Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at
Wittenburg for selling papal indulgences.  He died a horrible death, being
excommunicated by a bull.  It was the painter Donatello's interest in the
female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance.  It was an age of
great inventions and discoveries.  Gutenberg invented the Bible.  Sir
Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes.
Another important invention was the circulation of blood.  Sir Francis
Drake circumcised the world with a 100-foot clipper.

    The government of England was a limited mockery.  Henry VIII found
walking difficult because he had an abbess on his knee.  Queen Elizabeth
was the "Virgin Queen."  As a queen she was a success.  When Elizabeth
exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted, "hurrah."  Then her
navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.

    The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear.
Shakespear never made much money and is famous only because of his plays.
He lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies, and
errors.  In one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his
situation by relieving himself in a long soliloquy.  In another, Lady
Macbeth tries to convince Macbeth to kill the King by attacking his
manhood.  Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couplet.  Writing at
the same time as Shakespear was Miguel Cervantes.  He wrote Donkey Hote.
The next great author was John Milton.  Milton wrote Paradise Lost.  Then
his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.

    During the Renaissance America began.  Christopher Columbus was a
great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic.
His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe.  Later, the
Pilgrims crossed the Ocean, and this was known as Pilgrims Progress.  When
they landed at Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by the Indians, who came
down the hill rolling their war hoops before them.  The Indian squabs
carried porpoises on their back.  Many of the Indian heroes were killed,
along with their cabooses which proved very fatal to them.  The winter of
1620 was a hard one for the settlers.  Many people died and many babies
were born.  Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.

    One of the causes of the Revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks
in their tea.  Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the
post without stamps.  During the War, the Red Coats and Paul Revere was
throwing balls over stone walls.  The dogs were barking and the peacocks
were crowing.  Finally, The colonists won the War and no longer had to pay
for taxis.

    Delegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented
Congress.  Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two
singers of the Declaration of Independence.  Franklin had gone to Boston
carrying all his clothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm.
He invented electricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared, "A horse
divided against itself cannot stand."  Franklin died in 1790 and is still
dead.

    George Washington married Martha Curtis and in due time became the
Father of Our Country.  Then the Constitution of the United States was
adopted to secure domestic hostility.  Under the Constitution the people
enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.

    Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent.  Lincoln's mother
died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his
own hands.  When Lincoln was President, he wore only a tall silk hat.  He
said, "In onion there is strength."  Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg
Address while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an
envelope.  He also freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation
Proclamation, and the Fourteenth Amendment gave the ex-Negroes
citizenship.  But the Clue Clux Clan would torcher and lynch the
ex-Negroes and other innocent victims.  It claimed it represented law and
odor.  On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got
shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show.  The
believed assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor.
This ruined Booth's career.

    Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltare
invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.  Gravity was
invented by Isaac Walton.  It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when
the apples are falling off the trees.

    Bach was the most famous composer in the world. and so was Handel.
Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was very
large.  Bach died from 1750 to the present.  Beethoven wrote music even
though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  He took long
walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him.  Beethoven
expired in 1827 and later died for this.

    France was in a very serious state.  The French Revolution was
accomplished before it happened.  The Marseillaise was the theme song of
the French Revolution, and it catapulted into Napoleon.  During the
Napoleonic Wars, the crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their
shoes.  Then the Spanish gorillas came down from the hills and nipped at
Napoleon's flanks.  Napoleon became ill with bladder problems and was very
tense and unrestrained.  He wanted an heir to inherit his power, but since
Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't bear children.

    The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is
in the East and the sun sets in the West.  Queen Victoria was the longest
queen.  She sat on a thorn for 63 years.  Her reclining years and finally
the end of her life were exemplatory of a great personality.  Her death
was the final event which ended her reign.

    The nineteenth century was a time of many great inventions and
thoughts.  The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to
spring up.  Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the
work of a hundred men.  Samuel Morse invented a code of telepathy.  Louis
Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis.  Charles Darwin was a naturalist who
wrote the Organ of the Species.  Madman Curie discovered radium.  And Karl
Marx became one of the Marx brothers.

    The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by a
surf, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.

I was sitting behind a car at a stop light the other day and I noticed
that it had a bumper sticker that read "Honk if you love Jesus".  So
I thought about it a bit and since I loved Jesus, I honked my horn.

I was very surprised when the driver of the car got out and yelled,
"The light is still red you asshole!!!!" got back in the car and drove

This British explorer is in the dark jungles of Africa, going where no
*man* has gone before. Accompanying him is his trusted guide, interpreter, 
cook, and troubleshooter in one.

One day early in the morning, they arrive at a lake and find a handsome
dark young man engaged in "playful activities" with 8-9 beautiful, dark,
young women, all in nude. The young man had the biggest, strongest penis the
Britisher had ever seen, or even imagined. He was simply awed. He asked his
guide who this man was.

"He is the prince of the tribe that lives on the other side of the lake,
Sir", came the reply, "This is his morning ritual." 

"Ask him," the awed Brit said to his companion, "how did his penis get to
be this size?"

The guide goes to the lake and talks to the man, who seems to get very
agitated by the conversation.

"Well, what did he say?" asked our hero to his assistant on his return.

"He said, 'There's nothing wrong with my penis. Doesn't the white man's
shrink in cold water?'"

	A nun and a priest were traveling across the desert and
realized halfway across that the camel they were using for transportation
was about to die. They set up a make-shift camp, hoping someone would
come to their rescue, but to no avail. Soon the camel died.

	After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that
they were not going to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and
they discussed their predicament in great depth.

	Finally the priest said to the nun, "You know, Sister, I am
about to die, and there's always been one thing I've wanted here on 
earth -- to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes
so I can look at you?"

	The nun thought about his request for several seconds and
then agreed to take off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked,
"Well, Father, now that I think about it, I've never seen a man naked,
either. Would you mind taking off your clothes, too?"

	With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the
nun exclaimed, "Father! What is that little thing hanging between your
legs?"

	The priest patiently answered, "That, my child, is a gift from
God. If I put it in you, it creates a new life."

	"Well," responded the nun, "forget about me. Stick it in the
camel!"

These are stories and test questions accumulated by music teachers in the
state of Missouri.

                    Music Education

Agnus Dei was a woman composer famous for her church music.

Refrain means don't do it.  A refrain in music is the part you better
not try to sing.

A virtuoso is a musician with real high morals.

John Sebastian Bach died from 1750 to the present.

Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was rather large.

Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote
loud music.  He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was
calling him.  I guess he could not hear so good.  Beethoven expired in
1827 and later died from this.

Henry Purcell is a well known composer few people have ever heard of.

Aaron Copland is one of your most famous contemporary composers.  It is
unusual to be contemporary.  Most composers do not live until they are
dead.

An opera is a song of bigly size.

In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda who is the one he
really loves.  Pretty soon Silvio also gets stabbed, and they all live
happily ever after.

When a singer sings, he stirs up the air and makes it hit any passing
eardrums.  But if he is good, he knows how to keep it from hurting.

Music sung by two people at the same time is called a duel.

I know what a sextet is but I had rather not say.

Caruso was at first an Italian.  Then someone heard his voice and said
he would go a long way.  And so he came to America.

A good orchestra is always ready to play if the conductor steps on
the odium.

Morris dancing is a country survival from times when people were happy.

Most authorities agree that music of antiquity was written long ago.

Probably the most marvelous fugue was the one between the Hatfields
and McCoys.

My very best liked piece of music is the Bronze Lullaby.

My favorite composer is Opus.

A harp is a nude piano.

A tuba is much larger than its name.

Instruments come in many sizes, shapes and orchestras.

You should always say celli when you mean there are two or more cellos.

Another name for kettle drums is timpani.  But I think I will just stick
with the first name and learn it good.

A trumpet is an instrument when it is not an elephant sound.

While trombones have tubes, trumpets prefer to wear valves.

The double bass is also called the bass viol, string bass, and bass
fiddle.  It has so many names because it is so huge.

When electric currents go through them, guitars start making sounds.
So would anybody.

Question:  What are kettle drums called?  Answer:  Kettle drums.

Cymbals are round, metal CLANGS!

A bassoon looks like nothing I have ever heard.

Last month I found out how a clarinet works by taking it apart.  I both
found out and got in trouble.

Question:  Is the saxophone a brass or a woodwind instrument?
Answer:  Yes.

The concertmaster of an orchestra is always the person who sits in the
first chair of the first violins.  This means that when a person is
elected concertmaster, he has to hurry up and learn how to play a violin
real good.

For some reason, they always put a treble clef in front of every line
of flute music.  You just watch.

I can't reach the brakes on this piano!

The main trouble with a French horn is it's too tangled up.

Anyone who can read all the instrument notes at the same time gets to be
the conductor.

Instrumentalist is a many-purposed word for many player-types.

The flute is a skinny-high shape-sounded instrument.

The most dangerous part about playing cymbals is near the nose.

A contra-bassoon is like a bassoon, only more so.

Tubas are a bit too much.

Music instrument has a plural known as orchestra.

I would like for you to teach me to play the cello.  Would tomorrow
or Friday be best?

My favorite instrument is the bassoon.  It is so hard to play people seldom
play it.  That is why I like the bassoon best.

It is easy to teach anyone to play the maracas.  Just grip the neck and
shake him in rhythm.

Just about any animal skin can be stretched over a frame to make a pleasant
sound once the animal is removed.

		PACHYDERMIC PERSONNEL PREDICTION
		by Peter C. Olsen
	
	        A bold new proposal for matching 
                high-technology people and professions
 
      Over the years, the problem of finding the right person for the 
      right job has consumed thousands of worker-years of research and 
      millions of dollars in funding.  This is particularly true for 
      high-technology organizations where talent is scarce and 
      expensive.  Recently, however, years of detailed study by the 
      finest minds in the field of psychoindustrial interpersonnel 
      optimization have resulted in the development of a simple and 
      foolproof test to determine the best match between personality 
      and profession.  Now, at last, people can be infallibly assigned 
      to the jobs for which they are truly best suited.
 
      The procedure is simple: Each subject is sent to Africa to hunt 
      elephants.  The subsequent elephant-hunting behavior is then 
      categorized by comparison to the classification rules outlined 
      below.  The subject should be assigned to the general job 
      classification that best matches the observed behavior.
 
      CLASSIFICATION GUIDLINES
 
      Mathematicians hunt elephants by going to Africa, throwing out 
      everything that is not an elephant, and catching one of whatever 
      is left.  Experienced mathematicians will attempt to prove the 
      existence of at least one unique elephant before proceeding to 
      step 1 as a subordinate excercise.  Professors of mathematics 
      will prove the existence of at least one unique elephant and then
      leave the detection and capture of an actual elephant as an 
      excercise for their graduate students.
 
      Computer scientists hunt elephants by excercising Algorithm A:
      1. Go to Africa.
      2. Start at the Cape of Good Hope.
      3. Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent 
         alternately east and west.
      4. During each traverse pass,
         a. Catch each animl seen.
         b. Compare each animal caught to a known elephant.
         c. Stop when a match is detected.
 
      Experienced computer programmers modify Algorithm A by placing a 
      known elephant in Cairo to ensure that the algorithm will 
      terminate.  Assembly language programmers prefer to execute 
      Algorithm A on their hands and knees.
 
      Engineers hunt elephants by going to Africa, catching gray 
      animals at random, and stopping when any one of them weighs 
      within plus or minus 15 percent of any previously observed 
      elephant.
 
      Economists don't hunt elephants, but they believe that if 
      elephants are paid enough, they will hunt themselves.
 
      Statisticians hunt the first animal they see N times and call it
      an elephant. 
 
      Consultants don't hunt elephants, and many have never hunted 
      anything at all, but they can be hired by the hour to advise 
      those people who do.  Operations research consultants can also 
      measure the correlation of hat size and bullet color to the 
      efficiency of elephant-hunting strategies, if someone else will 
      only identify the elephants.
 
      Politicians don't hunt elephants, but they will share the 
      elephants you catch with the people who voted for them.
 
      Lawyers don't hunt elephants, but they do follow the herds around 
      arguing about who owns the droppings.  Software lawyers will 
      claim that they own an entire herd based on the look and feel of 
      one dropping.
 
      Vice presidents of engineering, research, and development try
      hard to hunt elephants, but their staffs are designed to prevent
      it.  When the vice president does get to hunt elephants, the
      staff will try to ensure that all possible elephants are
      completely prehunted before the vice president sees them.  If the
      vice president does see a nonprehunted elephant, the staff will 
      (1) compliment the vice president's keen eyesight and (2) enlarge 
      itself to prevent any recurrence.
 
      Senior managers set broad elephant-hunting policy based on the 
      assumption that elephants are just like field mice, but with 
      deeper voices.
 
      Quality assurance inspectors ignore the elephants and look for 
      mistakes the other hunters made when they were packing the jeep.
 
      Salespeople don't hunt elephants but spend their time selling 
      elephants they haven't caught, for delivery two days before the 
      season opens.  Software salespeople ship the first thing they 
      catch and write up an invoice for an elephant.  Hardware 
      salespeople catch rabbits, paint them gray, and sell them as 
      desktop elephants.

One fine afternoon somewhere in Scotland an elderly gentleman tries to
get into the local betting office. Much to his surprise, the door is locked.
After a few more futile attempts at opening the door a man sticks his head
out of a window. It turns out to be the bookmaker himself :

- Sorry, but we're closed today !

The elderly gentleman promptly replies:

- But there's a sign on the door saying : Open : 9 - 4, and it's only
  half past eleven !

to which the bookmaker says:

- But those are not the opening hours; they are the odds that we're
  open today.

"Mummy, mummy", he said, "I must have a skunk, I must, I must!!!"
"Well ok, my boy, but we'll have to steal one as
 you can't buy them in the shops."
"But mummy where could we hide it to smuggle it out?", Dave asked curiously.
"Oh that's no problem: I'll hide it down my pants!", his mum said.
"But wot about the smell?", Dave asked.
"Oh that's no problem, if it dies we can always steal another!"

Three nuns who had recently died where on their way to heaven. At the pearly
gates they were met by St. Peter. Around the gates there was a collection of
lights and bells.
    St. Peter stopped them and told them that they would each have to answer
    a question before they could enter through the pearly gates.

    St. Paul: "What were the names of the two people in the
    garden of Eden?"
    1st nun : "Adam and Eve"
    The lights flashed the bells rang and in she went through the pearly
    gates.

    St. Paul: "What did Adam eat from the forbidden tree ?"
    2nd nun : "An apple"
    The lights flashed the bells rang and in she went through the pearly
	gates.

    And finally it came the turn of the last nun.
    St. Paul : "What was the first thing Eve said to Adam ?"

    After a few minutes thinking she says "Gosh, that's a hard one!"
    The lights flashed the bells rang and in she went through the pearly
    gates!

Last week a woman entered a local pet-shop with the intention of purchasing
a talking bird.  However, it seems alot of people are going to receive
talking parrots for Christmas this year, as the shopkeeper had sold her
entire stock of speaking pets, except for one rather attractive Macaw.
It turned out that this bird had lived in the local massage parlour prior
to being sold to the pet-shop.  Despite this the woman purchased the Macaw
and took him home to show the family.  As soon as she had the bird settled
on a perch at her home he looked around and said:

"Arrrk, new joint, new madam!  Arrrk!"

Later that day the woman's two daughters arrived home from high school.
Upon seeing the teenagers the Macaw yelled:

"Arrrk, new joint, new madam, new girls! Arrrk!"

Then father came home from the office and when our feathered friend saw him
the bird squawked:

"Arrrk, new joint, new madam, new girls, same old customers.  G'day Jimmy!"

It was the 1st day of school.  The 2nd grade teacher
asked some of her students to tell the class a story
of something that had happened to them over the summer
break in which they learned a moral.

The first student stood up and said, "Well, I went to
my father's farm, and oneday we counted the eggs in
the chicken coupe to see how many chicks we would get,
but that night a wolf came and ate 1/2 of the eggs.
The moral I learned was don't count your chickens 
before they're hatched."

"Very good," said the teacher.

The second student stood up and said, "Well, one day
my mother sent me to the market to get some milk, and
on my way home, I got beat up by the neighbor bully who
spilled my milk all over the ground.  I went home crying
to my mother. And she said not to cry over spilled milk."

Very good," said the teacher.

The third student stood up and said, "My father told me
one of his war stories, and it went like this.  He was
stranded in a fox hole with only one bottle of Jack Daniels,
12 rounds of ammo, and 2 grenades.  Well he drank the
whiskey, then the enemy came.  He shot up 12 guys, and
blew up 20 more with the grenades."

"Well, what moral could you have possibly have gotten
>from such a story?" asked the teacher.

"Don't fuck with my dad when he's drunk."

  A couple has a male friend from visiting from out-of-state, when an
unexpected blizzard blows in, and keeping him from traveling. Since the
couple has no guest room, he states his intention to find a nearby hotel,
and be on his way in the morning.

  "Nonsense," says the wife. "Our bed is plenty big enough for all three of
us, and we're all friends here." The husband concurs, and before long
they're settled in: Husband in the middle, wife on his left, friend on his
right.

  After a while, the husband begins snoring, and the wife sneaks over to the
friend's side of the bed, and invites him to have sex with her. Naturally,
he'd like to, but he's reluctant. "We're in the same bed with your husband!
He'll wake up, and he'll kill me."

  "Don't worry about it," she says, "he's such a sound sleeper, he'll never
notice. If you don't believe me, just yank a hair out of his ass. He won't
even wake up."

  So the friend does so, and sure enough, she's right. Her husband sleeps
right through having a hair yanked out of his ass. So, she and the friend
have sex, and then she goes back to her side of the bed. After about twenty
minutes, though, she's back on his side of the bed, asking him to do it
again. The same argument follows, another hair is yanked from the husband's
ass, and again they have sex. This keeps up for about half the night, until
after about the sixth time, when the wife goes back to her side.

  Then the husband rolls over, and whispers to his friend, "It's bad enough
that you're fucking my wife, but could you at least stop using my ass for
a scoreboard?"

A protestant moved into a completly Catholic comunity. Being good Catholics
they welcomed him to their comunity. But, also because they were good Catholics
they did not eat red meat on Fridays. So, when their neighbor, receiving his
paycheck on Fridays, began barbequuing some juicy stake, they began to squirm.

  They were so anoyed that they went to talk to him about it. After much talk
they conviced him to become Catholic. The next Sunday he went to the priest and
the priest sprinkled holy water on him and said :

  You were born Protestant -
  You were raised Protestant -
  But now you are Catholic.

  And so, the next Friday, the neighbors sat down to eat fish and were disturbed
by the smell of roast beef from the neighboring house. They went over to talk
to the new Catholic because he new he was not supposed to eat beef on Fridays.
When they saw him, he was sprinlking catchup on the beef saying :

  You were born a cow -
  You were raised a cow -
  But now you are fish.

bedroom in the middle of the night?"

Around Holiday time we all get to see the family and pass on lore and gossip.
One day a little girl was watching her mother make a great roast beef.  She
cut off the ends, wrapped it in string, seasoned it and set it in the great
roasting pan.  The little girl asked her mother why she cut off the end of
the roast.  The mother said after some thought that it was the way that her
mother had done it.  That weekend grandma came over to visit and the little
girl and the mother went to her and asked why she had cut the end off of the
roast before cooking.  After some thought replied, because that was the way
her mother had done it.  Now great grandmother was quite old and in a nursing
home.  But the little girl had the chance the next weekend to see her and
asked again the questions.  She looked at them a bit annoyed and said, "Why
so it would fit in the pan, of course."

A father had two little sons, one of whom was an eternal optimist, while
the other was a perpetual pessimist.  One Christmas he decided try to
temper both of their proclivities: in addition to their standard gifts,
he told them they'd each get something "chosen especially for you!"
His plan was to give the pessimist every toy and game he could possibly
desire, while the optimist would be directed to the basement filled with
manure.

On Christmas, after the normal presents were opened, the father sent the
optimist to the cellar, while leading the pessimist to the room filled
with presents.  After the pessimist opened all the gifts, he turned to
his father with a sad face and said:  "How can I possibly use all these?
The TV will wear out, the Nintendo will get smashed, and all the other
toys will be broken!"  After a few minutes of listening to such woe, the
father remembered his optimistic son, and ran to the basement steps.

There in the basement was his other son, swimming through the manure
with a gleeful smile.  The father asked him why he was so happy, to
which the boy exclaimed "With this much manure, there must be a pony in
here somewhere!"

Once upon a time there were two deaf mutes standing on a street corner talking
to each other with sign language.

Mute #1 (SIGN)"What would you like to do?"

Mute #2 (SIGN)"I don't know, what about you?"

Mute #1 (SIGN)"Let's get my car, find some girls, drive to a dark space and
        have some fun."

Mute #2 (SIGN)"Good idea."

So they get his car, find some girls, drive to a dark spot and are having a
ball when the guy in the back seat taps the guy in the front seat on the
shoulder.....

Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"What?"

Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"Have you got any protection?"

Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"No.  Don't you?"

Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"No.  We had better go to a drug store and get some."

They procede to drive to a drug store and the man in the back seat gets out
and goes inside.  In 2 minutes he is back outside and taps on the car window.

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?"

Outside Mute (SIGN)"I've got a problem."

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?"

Outside Mute (SIGN)"I can't make the druggist understand what I want."

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"I know What to do."

Outside Mute (SIGN)"What?"

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Go back inside.  Put five dollars on the counter.  Put
             your pecker on the counter.  He'll know what you want."

Outside Mute (SIGN)"Good idea."

The man goes back into the drug store and 2 minutes later he's back at the car
window.

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Well?"

Outside Mute (SIGN)"It didn't work."

Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What do you mean?"

Outside Mute (SIGN) "I did what you told me to do.  I went inside.  I put 5
             dollars on the counter.  I put my pecker on the counter.  He put
             his on the counter.  It was bigger than mine.  He took my 5
             dollars."

Given :
   a) There exists a single god called God.
   b) God created the world in his own image.
   c) The world is round.

Therefore, God is round.

Given :
   d) There is no edge of the world.
   e) The world is round from all points on the surface of the world.

Therefore, the world is spherical.
Therefore, God is actually spherical.

Given :
   f) The world is not smooth, but, rather, it is lumpy.

Therefore, the world is closer to the shape of a golfball
              than that of a perfect, smooth sphere.
Therefore, God is a golfball.

Given :
   g) The world is not uniformly lumpy.
   h) The world is covered in parts by bodies of liquid.
   i) Inconsistencies in a surface are created by chewing.
   j) Sloppy chewing leaves saliva on that which has been chewed.

Therefore, the world is even closer in shape to a golfball
              which has been chewed on sloppily.
Therefore, God is a golfball which has been chewed on sloppily.

Given :
   k) A golfball is a sports ball.
   l) Dogs chew on sports balls.
   m) No other being chews on sports balls.
   n) Dogs are sloppy chewers.

Therefore, God is a golfball which has been chewed upon by a dog.

Given :
   o) God is omnipotent.

Therefore, God is not impotent.

Given :
   p) God is refered to as "He" in most literature.
   q) God is omnisexual.

Therefore, God is male.

Given :
   r) God required a mate to reproduce his image.
   s) God is heterosexual.

Therefore, God created a female.

Given :
   t) In the beginning, there was only God.

Therefore, God created the dog which chewed Him.

Given :
   u) God created life.
   v) God created only one thing (proposition).

Therefore, God created a female dog to represent life.
Therefore, life is a bitch.

Setting: A courtroom.  Defense attorney questioning a robbery victim.

Defense Attorney:  Mr. Smith, you were held up at gunpoint on the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Main Street on August 7th, is that
correct?

Smith:  Yes, that's correct.

Defense:  Did you struggle with the alleged robber?

Smith:  No.

Defense:  Why in the world not?

Smith:  He was armed.

Defense:  Then you made a conscious decision to comply with his
demands rather than resist?

Smith:  Yes.

Defense:  Have you ever given money away before?

Smith:  I didn't give it away, it was...

Defense:  (interrupting) Please answer the question, Mr. Smith.

Smith's Attorney (the prosecution):  Objection, your Honor!  My
client's prior financial history is irrelevant to these
proceedings.

Defense:  Oh no, it most certainly is not.  In fact I am trying
to establish a pattern here which may explain the happenings on
August 7th.  If the witness has an extensive history of giving
money away, then his honesty about the so-called "robbery" would
reasonably come under question.

Judge:  Objection overruled.  Please answer the question Mr.
Smith.

Defense:  Now, Mr. Smith, do you ever give money away?

Smith:  Yes, of course.

Defense:  And you do so willingly?

Smith:  Of course.  What are you getting at?

Defense:  Do you enjoy giving away money?

Smith:  Yes, that's why I do it.

Defense:  Well, let's put it like this, Mr. Smith, shall we? 
You've given money away in the past.  In fact it is quite
possible that the defendant recognized you as someone who has
quite a reputation for philanthropy.  How can we be sure that you
did not _want_ to have your money taken by force?  And even if you
didn't want it taken _this_ time, how can we expect the defendant
to have known that?

Smith:  That's ridiculous!  If I had...

Defense:  (interrupting) And how much did you give the man?

Smith:  I didn't _give_...

Judge:  (interrupting)  Answer the question please Mr. Smith.

Defense:  How much did you give him?

Smith:  One hundred dollars.

Defense:  One hundred dollars?  That doesn't seem like a lot for
someone who has given away so much money before.

Smith:  Uh...  It was very traumatic. I felt my life was in
danger.

Defense:  Yes, well we know that's your story.  So you were
carrying one hundred dollars in cash.  What time did the
"robbery" take place?

Smith:  Around eleven at night.

Defense:  You were out on the streets alone at eleven p.m. with
one hundred dollars in cash?  Doing what, for heaven's sake?

Smith:  Just walking.

Defense:  Just walking?  Don't you know that it's dangerous to be
out on the street late at night?  Weren't you aware that you
could be held up?

Smith:  I hadn't really thought about it.  I was just walking.

Defense:  Are you sure you weren't _looking_ for someone to give
money to?

Smith:  NO!  I was just out for a walk.

Judge:  I will have no more outbursts like that in my courtroom,
Mr. Smith.

Defense:  And what were you wearing?

Smith:  A suit.

Defense:  An expensive suit?

Smith:  Well, I am a successful business person.

Defense:  Don't you think it is rather foolish to wear an
expensive suit after midnight when you are carrying a hundred
dollars?

Smith:  But it wasn't after midnight, it was eleven pm.

Defense:  So you do admit then that it _would_ be foolish to be
out after midnight?

Smith:  That's not what I said.  I was just correcting...

Judge:  (interrupting) Answer the question Mr. Smith.

Smith:  No, I don't think that it would be foolish.

Defense:  So, in other words, Mr. Smith, you were walking the
streets late at night in a bad part of town, wearing a suit that
practically _advertised_ the fact that you might be a good target
for easy money, isn't that so?  I mean, Mr. Smith, one might
logically conclude that you were asking for this to happen.

Smith:  But I...

Defense:  (interrupting) The defense rests, your Honor.

	A while back, there were two kingdoms situated close by each other.
One kingdom had a powerful king, and the other had a relatively weak
king.  The difference (or so everybody said) was that the powerful
king had a magic throne, which had the property of making people
powerful.
	Well, the weak king wanted this throne, so he had a trusted
count get up an army (knights, pages, etc.) to fetch it.
	The army trudged along for a day or two and came upon the powerful
king's castle.
	The castle entrance was guarded by a huge yellow monster
with huge yellow hands.  The army (being an army and all) attacked!
	The huge Yellow Monster ate them all, except for two pages 
who did not engage in the fight.  The pages, being very frightened,
hid until nightfall.
	When night came along, the pages peeked from their hiding
place and saw that the monster was asleep.  The only thing guarding
the entrance now was the monster's huge hands draped in front of the
opening.  The pages, being only 8 years old and all, were able to
squeeze through the yellow fingers and gain entrance into the
castle.

Moral: let your pages do the walking through the yellow fingers.

	Once inside the castle, the pages had no trouble finding the
throne.  Combined, they were just strong enough to lift it, and were
able to carry it out of the castle.  (The monster gave them no
further trouble, since they had the throne and everything.)
	After having walked half the night with the heavy throne
between  them, they were very tired and stopped at a grass house
to rest.  The farmer who lived there, wanting to steal the throne for himself,
let them spend the night in the barn.  The throne was "hid" in the
farmer's attic.
	Some hours later, the farmer stole into his barn and killed
the pages.
	The farmer went back to bed.  A few minutes later, the
throne crashed through the ceiling, crushing and killing the farmer
and his wife.

Moral: people who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

	When the powerful king found his throne missing the next
day, he  ordered HIS army to kidnap the other king's count and force
him to tell where the throne was being hid. The session went as
follows:

king:	Where is the throne?
count:	I cannot tell you.
king: 	Then I will have you killed!  Executioner, cut off his
	head!
count:	(as the axe is swinging down...)
	Ok!  I will tell you!
	THWACK!!!

Moral: don't hatchet your counts before they chicken.

  An 8-foot fluourescent light in a New York City office burned out, and
the Big Boss said, `Fix it'. Naturally the job fell to the low man on the
T.P., who obtained a new one and replaced the burned-out one without too
much trouble. All he had to do now was throw out the old one.

  He took it out into the alley and tossed it in a dumpster. One of the
building's janitors saw him and said, `You can't put that there. There's
poisonous stuff in it and it's against the law.' He tried to sneak it into
somebody else's dumpster but didn't get away with it.

  So, pretty soon he was walking down the sidewalk with a burned-out 8-foot
fluourescent tube in one hand wondering how the hell he could get rid of it.
It wouldn't fit in a trash can and after the `poisonous' warning he wasn't
about to break it. Finally he got on a subway to try and find a dump.

  Picture a New York subway. How do you carry an 8-foot-long glass tube on
the subway? You stand it on end and hold onto it. Pretty soon somebody else
grabbed on, and presently there were four or five people holding onto the
light. The man thought about it for a minute and....got off at the next stop!

  As far as anybody knows that light tube is still on the subway somewhere.

Two old ladies were walking down the street one wintry day when they heard
a voice calling for help.  They looked around and saw a little green leg
sticking out from beneath a snowbank, so one of the old ladies digs down
and pulls out a very cold frog and starts warming it up in her hands.  The
frog says, "Oh thank you, thank you.  I was freezing to death under that
snowbank before you came along and saved me."

The old ladies are, of course, amazed by the fact that this frog can talk.  
The frog continues, "You know, I'm not actually a frog, and if you kiss me
I'll turn back into a handsome prince."

The old lady nods at this but just slips the frog into her pocket.  The other
old lady looks puzzled and asks, "Well, aren't you going to kiss him and see
if it works?"

The first old lady replies, "Certainly not!  I can make a whole lot more money
with a talking frog."

      "HOW DID IT HAPPEN?" the doctor asked the middle-aged
 farmhand as he set the man's broken leg.

      "Well, doc, 25 years ago ..."

      "Never mind the past. Tell me how you broke your leg this
 morning."

      "Like I was saying...25 years ago, when I first started
 working on the farm, that night, right after I'd gone to bed, the
 farmer's beautiful daughter came into my room. She asked me if
 there was anything I wanted.

      I said no, everything is fine. "Are you sure?", she asked.
 "I'm sure, I said.

      "Isn't there anything I can do for you?" she wanted to
 know. "I reckon not" I replied  ...

      "Excuse me," said the doctor, "What does this story have to
 do with your leg?"

     "Well, this morning," the farmhand explained, "when it dawned
 on me what she meant, I fell off the roof!"

Waitress:  Would you like some buns with your melon?

Customer:  No thank you, your melons will do just fine.

Customer:  Well, they do look good...

Waitress:  They'd taste even better with some nice sweet butter spread all
                over them.

Customer:  Yes, I can imagine.  But to tell you the truth, I think my own buns 
                 are better.

Waitress:  Oh, really?  Well perhaps you could show me the recipe sometime. 

Customer:  How about right now?  Would you let me come in your kitchen?

Waitress:  I'd love to.

The origin of the famous saying "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."

   It seems that back in the days of the Roman empire, Nero and Cicero had
estates on facing slopes of some hills, and both were avid growers of
roses. Every year Nero's slope was covered in red roses, and Cicero's was
covered in yellow roses.
   Of course, being the masters of their houses, Nero and Cicero didn't
actually work in the gardens. They had gardeners charged with seeing that
the roses were always up to the standards of the estate.
   One winter, Nero's head gardener was planting the rose bulbs for the
next season. As he walked down the rows planting bulbs, he suddenly
realized that he had been stepping on the last row he had planted. He
didn't have enough bulbs to replace the ruined plants, so in the middle of
the night he sneaked across the valley to Cicero's estate and stole enough
bulbs to complete the planting on Nero's slope.
   Well, fortunately for the gardener, he was called out of town around the
time when the rose buds were about to open. He therefore wasn't in the
reach of Nero's wrath when he noticed the one yellow line breaking up his
beautiful red field.
   Nero sent a note to his gardener asking about this unusual chromatic
anomoly. It read: "Our roses arose. Is a row Cicero's?"

A golfer and his wife are playing and he slices his tee shot over
behind a shed.  After examining the situation, he concludes that if
they open both the front and rear doors of the shed, he could play
his second shot through the shed.  He lines up and his wife goes to
open the doors.  As she is waiting, she wonders what is happening and
peeks around the door.  Unfortunately, just at that moment her husband
hits and his ball strikes her squarely in the head, killing her instantly.

The distraught husband avoids golf for a year, but 5 years later he is
remarried and happily playing golf again with his new wife.  Oddly
enough, he happens to slice on the same hole and lands in almost the
same spot.  His wife says, "Honey, if I open the front and back door
of that shed, I think you could play through."  He answers, "No, don't
do that.  The last time I tried that I took an 8 on this hole!"

There was a country club which didn't allow women on the golf
course.  Eventually, there was enough pressure that they decided to
allow women on the course during the week. 

The ladies were satisfied with this arrangement, formed a women's
club, and became active.  After about 6 months, the club board
received a letter from the women's club complaining about the men
urinating on the golf course.  Naturally, they just ignored the
matter.  After another 6 months, they received another letter
reminding them of the previous letter and demanding action.  After
due deliberation they sent the women a letter advising them that
they had been granted equal privileges!

A guy comes to work speaking in a really hoarse voice.
His buddy asks him what happened to his voice.

He relates that he was playing golf, and sliced out of bounds into
a pasture.  However, he thought he could find his ball and went
to look for it.  He saw a woman looking for her ball, too.  As he
passed a cow, he noticed that there was a golf ball stock in the
back end of the cow.  He lifted up the cow's tail and called out,
"Hey lady, does this look like yours?"  That's when she hit him in

There was two businessmen, whose names happened to be Mr Turtle and Mr
Carrot, and one day as they were coming back from lunch Mr Turtle says
to Mr Carrot, "You know, you're getting fat", to which Mr Carrot  says
"You're  not so slim yourself!".  So Mr Turtle says "Ok, we'll see who
is the least fit, race you back to the office" So the race starts, and
they'd  only  got about a block down the street when Mr Turtle crosses
the road in front of a car and gets bowled.  Mr Carrot sees that  he's
in  a  pretty bad way, so he rushes to the phone and calls Mr Cabbage,
the ambulance driver.  Mr Cabbage duly arrives  and  piles  Mr  Turtle
into  the  Ambulance and rushes to hospital.  Mr Turtle follows and as
soon as he gets to the Hospital he asks  the  nurse  at  Accident  and
Emergency,  Miss  Cauliflower,  whether  he  will  be  alright.  "Miss
Cauliflower, Miss Cauliflower, will Mr Turtle be alright?" she replies
"Well,  i  couldn't  really  say,  you'll have to ask Dr Bean".  So he
rushes over to Doctor Bean and says, "Doctor Bean, Doctor  Bean,  will
Mr  Turtle  be alright?" and the Doctor says "Well, I wouldn't like to
say, you'd best ask the specialist, Doctor  Pea",  so  of  course,  Mr
Carrot  rushes  over  to  Doctor Pea and says "Doctor Pea, Doctor Pea,
will Mr Turtle be alright?", and Doctor Pea says "I've done all I  can
for him, it's all in the hands of the Surgeon, Dr Turnip" So Mr Carrot
waits outside the surgery for 3 hours until  they  have  finished  the
operation,  and rushes up to Dr Turnip and says "Doctor Turnip, Doctor
Turnip, will Mr Turtle be alright?" and Dr Turnip  turns  to  him  and
says "We did all we could, but I'm afraid he'll be a vegetable for the

First, they went to Heaven. All nice-guys where there, dressed in

- Let's go to Hell, they said to each other.

Hell turned out to be a completely different scene. It was all bars,

    wheel and had an accident.

12) I was on my way to the doctors with rear end trouble, when my

Jesus was walking through the desert one day, when he comes  across  a
crowd  of  people,  preparing  to  stone  a  prostitute  to death.  He
enquires as to what is happening and why.   The  people  respond  that
they are going to stone her because she is a prostitute, and as such a
sinner!  So they bury her up to her head in  sand  and  are  about  to
stone her when Jesus walks over her and speaks to the crowd, finishing
up with "Let the person who is without sin,  cast  the  first  stone".
The  crowd  fidgets for a while and then starts to walk away.  Just as
most of them had decided to leave, a huge stone comes flying over  and
hits  the prostitute in the head, killing her.  And Jesus turns around
and says "You know, you really piss me off at times, Mother."

Hardly had the nurse left when a young man in a white coat came up

the more sane individuals into the community. Why don't I bring some of my
patients along, say next Tuesday. You'll have some customers and my patients
will have a night out !"
    Well, the publican isn't sure but the thought of more paying customers on
a quiet night appeals, so he agrees. So, the following Tuesday the guy in the
tweed jacket and glasses shows up with about ten lunatics. He says to the
publican,

that he's charged them rather a lot and feeling he should do his bit to help
these poor unfortunate people gives him a discount. 
    "Its eighty quid," he says. The guy in the tweed jacket smiles and says,

When the photographer arrived, he realized that the smoke

He requested permission to rent a plane and take photos 
>from the air.  His request was approved, and arrangements
were made.  He was told to report to a nearby airport where
a plane would be waiting for him.  He arrived at the airport
and saw a plane warming up near the gate.  He jumped in with
his bag and shouted, "Let's go!''   The pilot swung the little
plane into the wind, and within minutes they were in the air.
The photographer said, "Fly over the park and make two or three
low passes so I can take some pictures."  

"Why?" asked the pilot.  "Because I am a photographer," he 
responded, "and photographers make photographs."

          These three guys -  an  American,  Chinese,  and  German  -  were
     shipwrecked  on  a desert island. The German found this smokey bottle.
     So he brought it back to the other two and they all opened it  togther
     (the  German  was  a  really  nice guy). Well, low and behold, a GENIE
     POPPED OUT! The genie granted them each one wish, and  of  course  all
     three  wanted  to  be back home. So the genie said he would grant them
     their wishes.

          "But first, you must all do me a favor. Mr. American - I want you
     to  built me a restaurant here. Mr. German - you will make the kitchen
     for this restaurant. Mr. Chinaman - you will get the supplies for  the
     restaurant.  I  have a hot date waiting for me in Bagdad, so I have to
     go. But I will return in ONE MONTH. At that time, if you satisfied  my
     requirements, I will grant your wishes."

          So for one month, the three men American and German toiled  while
     the  Oriental  kinda lazed around and gave a helping hand to the other
     two. Then about 4 days before the genie's expected return, the  Orien-
     tal disappeared.

          Well, the genie came back, just as he promised, and asked  to  be
     shown what they had done.

          He was amazed by the restaurant! Five dining rooms, a  tremendous
     main lobby - all made of bamboo! It was a magnificent feat. As for the
     kitchen - full utensils, running gas stoves, pots,  pans  -  all  made
     from shells, bamboo, and coconuts. An absolute wonder!

          "But where are the supplies from Mr. Chinaman?"

          The two men said they didn't know. All they knew was that he  had
     disappered  a  few  days ago and they hadn't seen hide nor hair of him
     since then. Suddenly from the shadows, out leaped the Oriental, shout-

Continuing the series on  scientific  socialism...  This NUTWORKS article 
fully supports  the  observations  we have made about electricity. Here in the
Baltic   we  have  made  precise  mesurements  regarding  the  speed  of
electricity. You need a Telstar 5 valve  radio,  a  stop  watch,  and  a
measuring  tape.  Using  these  simple  everyday  socialist tools you can
estimate the speed of electrons.

Experimental method:

Set stop watch to zero.
Switch radio on, but do not put the plug in the wall.
Simultaniously start stopwatch and put plug in the wall
Stop stopwatch when you hear music coming from the radio
Measure the length of the cable from the plug to the radio

It is now a simple process to calculate the speed  of  the  electons  as
they travel along the cable and into the radio. That is, length of cable
divided  by the time taken from the insertion of the plug to the hearing
of the music will give you the speed of the electons in M/sec. e.g  2/10
= 0.2 M/sec

Anomolies:

Contradictory  results  are  obtained using transistor radios, where the
speed of electrons is thousands of times faster. Electrons  flow  faster
into  a  pre-heated 5 valve radio. Electon speed is not really dependent
on length of cable. In short cables, electons  flow  slowly...  in  long
cables, electrons flow fast.

And  now  for  the  NUTWORKS  contribution  to  the field of socialistic
electrical science.

                        ELECTRICITY
                        ===========

Today's scientific question is: What in the world  is  electricity?  And
where does it go after it leaves the toaster?

Here  is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical
question: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach
your hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of  his  dental  fillings.
Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?
This  teaches  us  that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we
must never use it to hurt others unless we need to  learn  an  important
electrical lesson.

It  also teaches us how an electrical circuit works. When you scuff your
feet, you picked up batches of "electrons", which are very small objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpet so that  they  will  attract
dirt.  The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your
finger, where they form a spark that leaps  to  your  friend's  filling,
then  travel  down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing
the circuit.

AMAZING  ELECTRONIC  FACT:  If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything with your finger, you would build up so many electrons
that your finger would explode! But  this  is  nothing  to  worry  about
unless you have carpeting.

Although we modern persons tend to take our electric lights, radios, mi-
xers, etc. for granted, hundreds of years ago people did not have any of
these  things,  which is just as well because there was no place to plug
them in. Then along came along the first  Electrical  Pioneer,  Benjamin
Franklin,  who  flew  a kite in a lightning storm and received a serious
electrical shock. This proved that lightning was powered by the same
force as carpets, but it also damaged Franklin's brain so severely that
he started speaking only in incomprehensible maxims, such as, "A penny
saved is a penny earned." Eventually, he had to be given a job running
the post office in America.                           

After Franklin came a herd  of  Electrical  Pioneers  whose  names  have
become  part of our electrical terminology: Juhani Volt, Vladimir Amp,
Raimo Watt,  Seppo  Transformer,  etc.  These  pioneers  conducted  many
important electrical experiments. Among them, Galvani discovered ***this
is the truth I swear on Lennin's beard***  that  when  he  attached  two
different  kinds  of  metals to the leg of a frog, an electrical current
developed and the frog's leg  kicked,  even  though  it  was  no  longer
attached to the frog, which was dead anyway.

Galvani's discovery led to enormous advances in the field  of  amphibian
medicine.  Today,  skilled  veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has
been seriously injured  or  killed,  squashed  by  a  steam  roller  for
example,  implant  pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it hop back
into the pond -- where it sinks like a stone.

But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edisonovitch,
(known  to  his  competitors as Thomas Sonovabitch), who was a brilliant
inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and  lived
in New Jersey, America. Edisonovitch's first major invention in 1877 was
the  phonograph,  which  soon  could  be  found in thousands of American
homes, where it basically sat until 1923, when records for it were developed.

But  Edisonovitch's  greatest  achievement  came  in 1879 when he
invented the electric company. Edisonovitch's design was a brilliant
adaptation of the simple  electrical  circuit: the  electric
company  sends  electricity through a wire to a  customer,
then immediatley gets the electricity back through  another wire,
then (this is the brilliant part) sends it right back to the 
customer again. 

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch
of electricity thousands times of times a day and never get caught, since
very few customers take the time to examine their electricity  closely.
It has come to our attention that the last year any new electricity was 
generated in America was 1937. So you see how exploited the people are in 
that country. This is capitalism at its very worst. Consumerism
is the opium of the people. In the Baltic were are proud to say we only 
use our electricity once... this saves us a considerable investment
in not having to run a second copper wire back to the power station.

Today, thanks to men like Edisonovitch, and Franklin and frogs like 
Galvani's, we receive almost unlimited benefits from electricity. 
For example, in the past decade, scientists have developed the laser, 
an electronic appliance so powerful that it can vaporize a bulldozer 
2000 yards away, yet so precise that doctors can use it to perform 
delicate operations to the human eyeball,provided they remember to 
change the power from "Bulldozer" to "Eyeball."

1st:  Yessir, I did it three times last night with a 30 year old!
2nd:  You're kidding!  I can't even manage to do it once!  What's your secret?
1st:  Well, the secret is to eat lots of whole-wheat bread.  I'm not kidding!
So the second old man rushed to the store.
  Clerk:  May I help you?
Old man:  Yes, I'd like four loaves of whole-wheat bread, please.
  Clerk:  That's a lot of bread!  It's sure to get hard before you're done!
Old man:  Damn!  Does EVERYONE know about this except me?

Classic riddles:

	Scene: A man is found dead in a locked room in a puddle of water.
	Answer: The poor guy died of starvation; the room was locked, right?
 		The water?  Oh, the roof leaked.

 	Scene: A man gets out of bed, and kills himself.
 	Answer: The man was a midget for the circus, and had just gotten fed
 	 	up with his bleak and demeaning lifestyle.

 	Scene: A man goes into a restaurant and orders some albatross.	After
 	       some delay, the food arrives.  He takes a taste, and then
 	       kills himself.  Why?
 	Answer: Obviously a whacko.  I mean, who orders ALBATROSS in a
 	       restaurant?!   I say "good riddance to bad garbage!"

	A farmer purchases an old, run-down, abandoned farm with plans
to turn it into a thriving enterprise.  The fields are grown over with
weeds, the farmhouse is falling apart, and the fences are collapsing
all around.

	During his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to
bless the man's work, saying, "May you and God work together to make
this the farm of your dreams!"

	A few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the
farmer.  Lo and behold, it's like a completely different place -- the
farm house is completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there is
plenty of cattle and other livestock happily munching on feed in
well-fenced pens, and the fields are filled with crops planted in neat
rows.  "Amazing!" the preacher says.  "Look what God and you have
accomplished together!"

	"Yes, reverend," says the farmer, "but remember what the farm
was like when God was working it alone!"

There's an apple on a lawn and a worm sitting right beside it. The
worm is rather interested in the apple is about to start eating. There's
a bird that sees the worm and apple in a tree nearby. He is already
dreaming about the juicy worm when he decides to wait for the worm to
eat the apple so that he will have a larger worm. Then there's a cat
behind some bushes who watches the whole scene and thinks: If the worm
eats the apple, the bird will eat the worm and I can have the bird.

Ok, the worm eats the apple, nice apple, the bird eats the worm, nice
and juicy indeed, and the cat jumps to catch the bird but misses and
falls into a pond.

What's the moral of this story?

Alas, as the computing power spent on the Etac Project is needed for
Gulf war nuclear simulations, for a while we must leave this group to
the lusers.  Let us hope it is still there after, say, January 15.
Included is an extra big chunk of jokes to cheer up your Christmas
dinner guests.  Oh by the way, do you know why the Gulf war has been
postponed till next year?  Otherwise all those prerecorded Christmas
shows would have become worthless!

        Once upon a time there was a
mathematician who found an equation for
GOD.  It was, of course, a very
complicated equation but, she figured,
all she had to do was find a computer
system which (1) had a large enough
memory to store all the necessary
variables and (2) was fast enough to
gather all the information together.
Once this was accomplished, all the
mysteries of the Universe could be
solved...
                             ...So the government took every available
                             micro-processor, linker, loader,
                             assembler and anything else they had
                             available, put them all together, and
                             then asked the computer:

                       "IS THERE A GOD?"

        Unfortunately, however, the
computer's response was that it would
take, at the very least, a century or
two to solve the problem...

                             ...This wasn't good enough for the
                             beaurocrats in Washington, who for the
                             first time in their life deired something
                             other than that status quo, so they
                             decided to follow that up by taking every
                             single computer in the *entire nation*
                             and linking them all together into one
                             giant, ever-so-much-bigger, super-
                             powerful-computer and asked, once again,

                       "I S   T H E R E   A   G O D?"

        Well, this time the computer
said that it would take only ten years
to solve the equation.  Not as bad, but
still not quick enough to satisfy all
the eager philosophers and scientists.
"Something more must be done!" they
would shout...

                             ...By this time the whole world was
                             beginning to pay some attention and
                             everone wanted to get involved.  One
                             everyone argued about which country could
                             claim credit and settled all the basic
                             disputes, they drafted a joint resolution
                             to build the computer and discover the
                             amount of truth in the assertation that
                             there is a God.

        So --  they took every computer
system in the world and linked them all
together into one single amazing
supercomputer, the likes of which had
NEVER, EVER, been seen before, and once
again asked:

                         "I
                           S

                            T
                             H
                              E
                               R
                                E

                                  A

                                    G
                                     O
                                      D?"

                  And the computer's response was...

                         "T H E R E

                                I S

The aging head of a secluded Monastary decides he will take a walk into the
nearby town for the first time in 30 years. As he's walking down the street
he passes a hooker on a corner who says "Hey twenty dollars for a quicky".
Confused, he walks past another corner and another hooker says "Hey padre,
twenty dollars for a quicky". He has no idea whats going on, so he returns to
the monastary and calls the Mother Superior to his office and asks her "Whats
a quicky?"  She replies "Twenty dollars, same as in town".

When the furor died down I added, "It was my own dear mother."
	Much impressed the younger, more boring, priest resolved to
give it a try.
	During his sermon -- at about the three hour point -- he heard 
snoring.
	"Last night" he cried "I held another man's wife in my arms."
	There was a gasp, and a hush of disapproval fell on the cong-

    	for German Bratwurst, would you have asked me if I was German?
    	If I had asked for Swiss Cheese, would you have asked me if I was
    	Swiss?  If I had asked for Spanish peanuts, would you have asked
    	me if I was Spanish? ...  So why did you ask me if I was Polish?!"

OK, like, so there were these three priests. Insert your denomination
here. There's a young priest, a middle-aged priest, and an elderly priest.

They're taking a business trip to Pittsburgh, and they need small change
for the tolls and tips and such. So at the airport, when they approach
the ticket agent to buy the airline tickets, the young priest saunters
up to the young woman who is behind the booth. 

He notices that she has a very sheer blouse on when he gets close...and,
well, frankly, her nipples are rather visible. This woman has quite a 
bodacious set of tatas; that is to say; she has massive gazongas. Our
young clergyman hero speaks thusly, "I'd like three pickets to Tittsburgh,
please!" 

Well, needless to say, he is a mite flustered. The middle-aged priest comforts
him. "It happens to the best of us, m'lad. Let me take care of this."

He swaggers up to the sheer blouse-clad wench. "I'd like three tickets
to Pittsburgh, please," he enunciates confidently. "And I'd like the
change in nipples and dimes." Well, that blows his bravado. 

Red-faced, he retreats back to his brethren. "My son, let me handle this,"
reassures the kind, grandfatherly church elder. 

He approaches the ticket agent. "I'd like three tickets to Pittsburgh,"
he avers cleanly. "And I'd like the change in nickles and dimes."

"Certainly," replies the young lady.

"Thank you my dear," he adds, glancing cockily at his fellow clergymen. 
"My prayer for you will be that when you die, St. Hand has his peter 
out to greet you."

"Can I help you madam?" asks the shopkeeper.

"No madam, you'll have to get that from the chemist's."

"How would like to meet my friend" the ugly chick asks
"I would love to" he says
"How would you like to take her home" says the girl
"I'd kill for it"

"Would you like to feel her tits"
"God YES" he says as he gets more excited

"Would you like to stroke her ass"
"Love to"

"Would like to see her pussy"
"Fuck that would great"

"Would you like to feel her pussy"
"Please" he says 

"Would you like to smell her pussy" she ask smiling
"Oh god yes" he says as he in on the verge of orgasm

"Ok" she says and leans over and breaths in his face.

A golfer hooks his drive into the woods to the left of the fairway.  While
looking for his ball he happens upon a leprechaun.  The leprechaun asks him,
"How's your round of golf is going?".  The golfer admits, "I'm having one of
my worst rounds ever."  The leprechaun zaps the golfer with a magic spell.
The leprechaun then asks, "How's your sex life doing?"  The golfer replies,
"In all honesty, I haven't had any in years."  So, the leprechaun zaps him
with another spell.  The golfer goes on to have his best round ever.

Two months later the golfer is playing the same course.  He checks to see if
the leprechaun is still around.  Sure enough, he spots him in the woods.  The
leprechaun asks, "How's how has your golf been lately?"  The golfer responds
with pride, "I'm playing the best golf of my life."  The leprechaun than asks,
"How's your sex life doing?"  The golfer replies happily, "I've been getting
some almost every other week."  The leprechaun seemed dismayed and said, "Boy,
I would have thought you would be doing much better than that."  The golfer
replied, "Well for a priest, from a small town, with no car, every other week
isn't so bad."

This guy goes into a bar and asks for a pint of beer.  While the barman's
pouring it, he looks about the place, and sees a piano man sitting there in
front of the old ivories, giving it a bit of a play, and his pet monkey, which
is wandering about with a tin mug collecting money.  Now just as the barman
finishes pouring the guy's pint, and the guy pays him, the monkey drops its
tin cup, charges along across the floor, up onto the bar, unzips its flies,
and dunks its dick into the guy's pint.  At which, the guy turns to the piano
man and says;
"Do you know your monkey's dipped its dick in my beer?"
To which the piano man replies;
"No, but if you hum it, I'll improvise!"
