    Ok, for a couple of years I have been dabbling in Anarchy and
    Destruction.  Note the capital letters, the words mean a lot to me.
    I have decided that the time has come to spread a few of my little
    tricks.  The two articles in this text file are:

    Contained Electronic Detonated Bomb

    Puke Bomb

    Contained Electronic Detonated Bomb
     -----------------------------------
     Ok, this is pretty simple and most of the parts can be bought from your
    local Kaybee toy store (yeah, a toy store carries some rough stuff..)
    Needed:

    2-4 D Class Toy Propellants (Model Rocket Engines) (C Class will work,
    but I suggest D)

    Any type of container that has a puncturable lid.

    Solar Ignitor (Can be found in the Model Rocket section at Kaybee)

    Gasoline

    Sulphur (optional)

    Battery Pack

    4 D batteries

    20-40 feet of dual wire cord  (Take number of engines time 10)

    Any type of electrical switch




    Assembly:

    The first thing you need to do is to take apart the rocket engines.
    The best way to do this is by taking a hobby knife and cutting the
    cardboard.  Now, take a pair of plyers and pull the cardboard off.  Set
    the rocket engines, now taken apart, aside.  Pour gasoline in the
    bottom of the container.  If you are using an 8 oz container, about 2
    oz will do.  Cut a piece of cardboard into the shape of the inner of
    the container.  Set the cardboard ontop of the gasoline inside the
    container.  Now, if you have a plastic lid, line the poles of the solar
    ignitor up with the lid and cut 2 holes so that the ignitor can fit
    through.  If you have a metal lid, do the same, but drip candle wax
    where the ignitor hits the lid.  Now, set the rocket engines in ontop
    of the cardboard which is over the gasoline.  Put the cap on.  Take the
    two wires and connect them to the switch (in the off position) and also
    to the poles of the solar ignitor.  Now, hook the wires from the switch
    up to the battery pack.  When the switch is turned, you will have a
    nice little boom.



    Explanation:

    When the switch is turned, the flow of electricity goes into the solar
    ignitor and causes it to ignite.  The solar ignitor (inserted in the
    end of one of the rocket engines) causes the rocket engine to go off
    and starts a chain reaction.  The gasoline is used to speed up the
    reaction.

    Puke Bomb
    ---------

    Ahh yes, an utterly disgusting joke.  How would you like to have puke
    splattered all over you?

    Ok, you need to build the mentioned bomb above first.

    Pull apart one of those ceiling lights with the nice little bowl.  Push
    the rounded part of your finger against the back of your throat and
    puke in the bowl.  Now, pull out the light bulb and pull apart the
    connector for the lightbulb.  You should see two wires (usually green
    and red).  Make sure the light is off and connect the 2 wires to the
    solar ignitor of the bomb.  Place the bomb floating in the puke and put
    the bowl back over the light.  When the person turns on the light there
    will be a boom and puke will fly all over them...  Pretty gross, eh?
