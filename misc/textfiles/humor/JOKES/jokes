A rope walked into a bar and asked the bartender for a beer.  the bartender
said ,"are you a rope?"  the rope answered yes and the bartender told him that
he would have to leave since they don't serve ropes in this bar.  The rope
left and stood on the street outside.  A second rope came up and started to go
in the bar.  the first rope said don't go in!, they don't serve ropes in
there.  the second rope said , "don't be ridiculous"! so he went in and
ordered a beer. the bartender askedif he was a rope.  the rope answered yes
and the bartender said that he would have to leave cause they didn"t serve
ropes.  the first rope said ,"see?".  they were both standing there when a
third rope came along.  the two ropes said,"You can't go in there!".  "why
not?" asked the third rope.  "Because they don't serve ropes in there."  Watch
this said the third rope.  he tied him self up in a knot and messed up the top
of himself and went in and ordered a beer.  The bartender said, "Are you a
rope?"  The rope answered, "Nope, I'm afraid not."

The Station Warrant Officer calls the Staff Sergeant in and informs him that
Private Smith's mother has just died and to tell him the sad news. The
Sergeant gets all the men lined up outside and says:
 
"Just a short announcement. Private Smith, your mother is dead."
 
Of course the man was overcome with grief and collapsed on the parade square.
The SWO heard the news and instantly called the Sergeant to the office. He
told the Sergeant to use a little more tact when telling someone bad news. He
told him that Private Jone's father had just passed away and to tell him. The
Sergeant lined all the troops up again and asked:
 
"Everyone whose father is living, take one step forward!! Where are 
you going Jones!!"

A zen master is a master in Zen (as if you couldn't have guessed).
Basically, in Zen, you clear your mind of everyting, so that when you look
at things you asign no interpretation to it what-so-ever.  When you have
acheved this, you can gain an intant, intuitive insight in to things.  For
exemple, If you ask a Zen master what Zen is, he might say "It is the cloud
in the sky and the bird in the bush!"  Anyone want to expand or comment?

If I might adress you two. . . guys, this is a humor conference.  If you wish
to debate religion, please do so in an appropriate forum (I'd even like to
participate, because I believe strongly in this book which you have labelled
as "largely x-rated" and feel that you are distorting the record to make your
point --- I sometimes exercise in hyperbole myself.)  Be that as it may, I
feel that true bigotry, be it anti-gay, anti-atheist, anti-christian, or
anti-anything that is based on ill-informed prejudice is wrong.  That is not,
as I see it, what this conference is about. People make fun of others,
sometimes in an offensive way here.  But I would not participate if I really
felt that the folks who tell "fat" jokes had a personal vendetta against my
rotundity.  And so it goes. Just in case, I have seen on a couple of bbs's a
file called "ettiquet.txt" which basically gives guidelines on how to behave
in a conference.  Please read it and take it to heart.  It makes this a
funnier place for everyone involved.  Lighten up!

o.j. : Man is playing golf and having a terrible day.  He comes to a long par
3 over water, and says to himself, " I better get out an old ball, because I
hate to lose this new one."  He reaches into the bag, gets the old ball, and
places it on the tee.  In the middle of his backswing, a booming voice from
heaven says, "HIT THE NEW BALL!"   The guy shrugs, tees up the new ball, and
starts to swing.  The voice booms, "TAKE A PRACTICE SWING!"  So, the guy
obliges.  He addresses the ball, starts to swing, and again, right in the
middle of the backswing, the voice booms out. . .

"HIT THE OLD BALL!!!!!!!!" :)
"If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, you haven't
checked your answering service." (B.J. Honecutt, MASH)
Later, all.
p.s. thanks for the golf jokes, everyone. keep'em coming!

when a womann came up and introduced herself as Roberta, fformerly their old
friend Bob. She told them all about how she had alwways felt more like a
women, but never told them because she valued their friendship too much to
risk it,and that she had gone ahead and had the operation a few years before.
The two guys were shocked but sympathetic. Onne said "It must have been very
painful" "Yes it was" she replied. "what was the worst part?" the guy
asked.."I'll bet the worst part was when they cut your testicles off" 
"No, that wasn't thee worst part"
"I'll bet the worst part was when they cut your penis off"the guy said.
" No, that wasn't it" she replied "I think what really hurt the most was going
back to the same job for half the money"

There was this German, Polock, and a Niger on an air plane. Theywere flying
along and the captain called them all up to the front. He told them that one
of the planes engins had quit. The plain was lossing altitude, and he said
that one of them would have to jump to save the rest of the plain. He said "Do
I have any Volinteres
All of the guys said NO WAY!! (By the way. There are no parachutes). So the
piolot said,"So you guys thing that you are pretty smart don't ya?" Thay all
said ya. He said, "Well, I'm gonna ask you alll a question. If you answer it
correctly, you don't have to jump". They all agreed. So this piolot, who is
kinda prejudice anyway, looked at the German and said, "What was the worst
water disaster ever in American history?" The German starts shakin and
sweatin'. He finally says, "The sinking of the Titanic." The piolot says
"right". He looks at the Polok and says,"Now, how many people were on the ship
when it sank?" The polok starts Sweatin' and shiverin' and after about five
min. of calculating he finally says,"2846". The piolot is astounded. He
says"that's right. Amazing." Then he looks at the Black man and says,
"Alright. Name 'em Niger!"

There was this good little Italian boy who had always been taught that if you
were good and prayed to Baby Jesus he would answer your prayers. Well he had
been wanting a 10 speed bike for a long time so he sat down at a desk and
started his letter to Baby Jesus.
Dear Baby Jesus,
I would really like to have a ten speed bike and if you bring me a ten speed
bike I'll be really good for a month
He stopped and thought, "you know a month is really a long time, so he threw
the letter away and started again
Dear Baby Jesus,
I would really like to have a ten speed bike and if you bring me a ten speed
bike I'll be really good for a week.....
He once again stopped and thought....Johnny birthday party was in a couple
days and he didn't think he could be good that long.  As he sat and scratched
his head, he looked up and saw the statues of Baby Jesus and Mary and had a
great idea.  He reached up and took the statue of Mary and stuck in the desk
draw and began his letter again....
Dear Baby Jesus,
If you ever want to see your mother again..................

Subject: Pearl Harbor Day


               A PEARL HARBOR CAROL

'Twas the eve before Pearl Harbor
     and all through the earth
 Not a creature was stirring
     not even a rat.

The A-bombs were hung
     by the chimney with care!
 In hopes that MacArthur
     soon would be there.

The bombers were huddled
     all snug in their hangers
 With visions of destruction
     put in by their planners.

While the earth in her torture
     and God in his sorrow
 Had just settled down
     for a look at tomorrow.

The sight they beheld
     was gruesome indeed
 For all they had nurtured
     was gone just for greed.

Each man wanted more
     than was given to him
 And stopped at nothing
     to answer this whim.

They swept over the land
     taking all they could get
 And though they had much
     they were not happy yet

So they turned from the land
     and onto each other
 Each man for himself
     to hell with your brother!

Then the nations let loose
     all their "needed protection"
 Till all that was left
     was just total destruction.

The earth had been bled
     to the point beyond all
 And so from existence
     this plannet did fall.

God sat all alone now
     His works were all gone
 And so now was He
     for He lived in each dawn.

Just what really happened
     to the last signs of man
 Might be best said in saying
     that they went with the land.

Yes, 'twas the eve before Pearl Harbor
     and all through the earth
 Not a creature was living
     not even a rat.

A golfer was about to hit his shot from the rough when a booming voice said

looking around to see if he could find them. "This is Mother Nature" the
voice said, "that ball is laying in my butter-cups, and if you hit the ball
it will kill them". The golfer said "I'm sorry but I have to play the ball
where it is!". Mother Nature said "well if you just kick it away from my
butter-cups, I will give you all the butter you want".
The golfer thought for a second and then hit this ball, saying

A norwegian is driving through the Sahara desert... suddenly he sees a young
arab lying in the sand, naked, arms and legs tied up.
the arab explains that he met a band of bandits that tokk all his possessions,
raped him from behind one by one, and left him here to die.
" Sorry ", the norwegian says and unzips his fly, " it's not your day

Why did they cancel the leper hockey game?
There was a face off in the corner.
Why did the leper bridge game end?
They all threw their hands in.
.
A leper walks into a fine restaraunt.  A waiter shows him to a seat and gives
him a menu.  A few minutes later, another patron runs gagging to the bathroom.
The leper thinks "Hey, I'm grossing these people out, I should leave" and
rises to leave.  But the waiter convinces him to stay.
Not yet a minute has gone by, and another person stands up, covers their mouth
and runs to the john.  This time the leper is sure that he should leave, but
the waiter reassures him that its not his fault.
Then two more patrons retch and run out of the room.  This time the leper is
adamant about leaving.  "No, sir, its not you" says the waiter.  "You see, the
person behind you is using your back as a dip!"

Subject: GOLF JOKES

Jesus and Saint Peter are playing golf and both having a reasonably good round
until about the seventh hole.  It's a dog leg left with a wicked stand of
trees to one side and a water hazard to the other.  Jesus tees off first and
gets a good drive, straight and true, landing about 60 yards from the green. 
Saint Peter takes a large swing and shanks the drive, sending it into the
stand of trees, where it hits a large oak and caroms into the air.  A crow
flying over the course catches the ball in its jaws and flys over the green
before dropping it, where it rolls in for a hole in one.
 
And Jesus says, "Come on Pete, did we come out here to play golf or just screw
around?"

two guys. They all looked at it and the Englishman gave it a rub to clean it
and all of a sudden a Genie appeared and granted each one of them one wish.
The Englishman wished he could go back home to his wife and family and poof!

  This boy had a Jewish mother and a black father. He went up to his parents
one day and said he had a problem. Naturally his parents asked if they could
help.
 "There is a boy at school who is selling his bike for $15. I don't know
whether to offer him $11.50 or wait till it's dsark and steal the thing.
      
 "You mean to tell me you went through this whole sex change thing withput any
pain?"
 "Well no, I didn't say that. There was one part thAt was painful."
 "What part was that Ralph?"
 "When they drilled a hole in my head and sucked half my brains out. Now I'm a
real woman."
       
  Thanks for the enlightenment guy. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled and see
if he shows up on any programs up here in the great white north. WE'll likely
start hearing from him in about 3 years.........
  You don't know if he has any records out do you?
  
Later..........

Yet, another great Easy Rider joke:
 
   After work, the bro dragged his tired ass home and found his ol lady
in front of the TV, glued to a soap opera. 
   "Hey baby, whats for supper?", he asked.
   "Fuck supper!" she yelled. "I just left a women's lib meeting, and I
found out that I don't hafta cook your meals anymore."
    The bro, barely holding back his temper, tried to let it slide. "If
I was you, bitch," he growled, "I'd forget about this womens lib shit
right away. Now get off yer fat ass and get my supper on the table."
    Not even looking up from the TV, his ol' lady said, "I told ya,
asshole, my womens lib sisters told me I don't hafta do shit if I don't
wanna, and I don't fuckin' feel like cookin' today. Ya got that?"
    "How'd you like to not see me for about three days?" the bro said evenly.
    "Go for it," she said. "I don't give a flyin' fuck what ya do."
    The next day the bitch didn't see him.
    The second day the bitch didn't see him.
    The third day she could just barely see him out of the corner of
her left eye.

Wrong.  Genesis 4;17: "And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare
Enoch..."  Hardly homosexual, I'd say.

It's true, of course, that where Cain found his wife is not explained, but
if you're going to be a Bible Literalist, be literal.

So there.

OJ:
Peter Kaufman was a perfectionist (not a literalist--heh,heh) when it came
to playing bridge.  He absolutely could not stand mediocrity at the bridge
table.

One evening, while playing bridge with a particularly inept partner, the
partner asked to be excused to go to the bathroom.

As he left, Kaufman remarked, "Well, for the first time this evening he'll
know what he's got in his hand."
