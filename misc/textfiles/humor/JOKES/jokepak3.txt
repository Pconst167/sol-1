Two roaches were munching on garbage in an alley.  "I was in that
new restaurant across the street," said one.  "It's so clean!  The
kitchen is spotless, the floors are gleaming white.  It's so
sanitary the whole place shines." "Please," said the other roach,
frowning.  "Not while I'm eating!"

An infant rabbit was orphaned.  Fortunately though, a family of
squirrels took it in and raised it as if it were one of their own. 
This adoption led to some peculiar behaviors on the part of the
rabbit, including a tendency for it to eschew jumping but rather to
embrace running around like its step-siblings.

   As the rabbit passed through puberty, however, it soon faced an
identity crisis (don't we all!).  It went to its step-parents to
discuss the problem.  It allowed as to how it felt different from
its step-siblings, was unsure of its place in the universe, and was
generally forlorn.  Their response was,

"Don't scurry, be hoppy."

There once was a 94 year old nun whose wornout body began to
surrender.  Her doctor prescribed for her a shot of whiskey three
times a day, to relax her tenseness.  However, not to be lured into
worldly pleasures, she huffily declined.  But her mother superior
knew the elderly sister loved milk.  So she instructed the kitchen
to spike the milk three times a day.

Eventually, the elderly pious one approached her final hour.  As the
several sisters gathered around her at bedside, the mother superior
asked if she wanted to leave them any words of wisdom... "Oh, yes,"
she replied.

"Never sell that cow!"

i just read about two people who were driving their car around some
town in New Jersey. They had a stick of dynamite with them.

Well, one of them wondered what would happen if they lit the
dynamite and threw it out the window at 3 am. So they lit it up and
tossed it.

Only the window was rolled up.

They were both taken to the hospital, where they underwent surgery.

I think they're recovering, but they have been disinvited to the
next Mensa meeting...

Man relieves himself on dog: Sparks panic

Rio De Janeiro, Brazil - A Rio neighbourhood went to the dogs and
echoed with the sound of gunfire after a man and a terrier got into
a dispute over a call of nature.

The toilet shootout developed when a beer-filled Brazillian student
went to relieve himself against a tree, Brazilian news agency Estado
reported.

The student mistakenly urinated on a pit bull terrier that was
watering the same vegetation and as a result ended up brawling with
the dog's owner, Estado said.

When the student's friends chased the owner and his dog to a service
station, security guards, thinking a robbery was in progress, fired shots
into the air, bringing police rushing to the scene.

After a brief spell behind bars, however, the two men were reported
to have made up -- over a beer.

There was a kid who excelled at school in all subects except math.
In desperation his agnostic parents sent him to a Catholic parochial
school to see if the nuns could straighten him out.

The kid immediately buckled down. Every night he went to his room,
closed the door, and studied his math. When report cards came out he
had A's in everything and an A+ in math.

When his parents asked him what made the difference, he replied, "I
knew they meant business the first time I walked into the school.
Right inside the front door they've got a big statue of a guy nailed
to a plus sign."

carry-out. The first String says, "I'll show you how to buy beer,"
and goes in.  "I'd like a six-pack of beer, please." Mr. Rope says,
"You're one of those Strings.  We don't serve your kind here.  Get
out of here!"

So the second String says, "Watch me," and goes in.  In his deepest
voice, he says, "I'd like a six-pack of beer, please." Mr.  Rope
says, "You're another one of those Strings.  Get out of here!"

himself into a clove-hitch, unravels his head, goes into the
carry-out, and says, "I'd like a six-pack of beer, please." Mr. Rope
asks, "Aren't you one of those Strings?"

So Paddy and Murphy are in a wild west bar trying to scrounge a pint
off the bartender. They've been at it for about an hour when in
walks this guy with a head under his arm. The bartender jumps up and
gives the guy a sack of gold. Paddy and Murphy are way confused. The
bartender explains.  "I hate the Indians ya' see!" he says "I hates
'em so much I'll give a sack of gold to anyone who brings me an
Indian's head..."

So off Paddy and Murphy go, equipped with rifle, saw, hammer etc.

After a while they find a lone Indian, and they shoot him off a cliff
and down into a ravine. Down go Paddy and Murphy, after him. At the
bottom Paddy starts cutting off the Indian's head while Murphy
stands watch.

After a couple of minute Murphy taps Paddy on the shoulder, says
"Paddy, I think you ought to look at this." Paddy ignores him...
"No, Paddy, I'm serious, you really ought to take a look!!"

Paddy lops off the Indian's head and looks up where Murphy's
pointing. On either side of the ravine there's like, a million
Indians, war paint and the lot. Paddy looks at Murphy with a glint
in his eye and says "Well, I'll be, mate!   We're gonna be
millionaires!"
