A QUALITY FAIRYTALE
-------------------

Once a long time ago, in a Corporation far away, there were 5 employees.  They
were called Quality, Somebody, Anybody, Nobody, and Everybody.  Everybody was
the "Boss" of the Corporation.  Quality was a hard-working and honest fellow
and Everybody believed in Quality's job.  Anybody was a well trained and
capable individual (Everybody was always saying "Anybody can do that job!")
but somewhat hard to locate (I can't find Anybody to do that job!).  Nobody
was the most junior member and tended to get all the unimportant jobs.  In
fact, Somebody (who was a general, all-around nice person) usually got the
jobs that Nobody wanted.  Somebody was by far the most useful employee in the
Corporation (like Anyone will tell you, "Everybody needs Somebody sometime").

It came to pass that Quality got offered a better job in a far away place
and left the Corporation.  So Quality's job became vacant.

Everybody naturally decided that Anybody could do Quality's job.  Somebody
pointed out to Everybody that even though Anybody was very capable, he was at
best unreliable.  Everybody grudgingly agreed and took over Quality's job
himself.  As it turned out, Everybody soon found himself too busy to do
Quality's job (and besides it often led to Quality vs. Schedule conflicts).
Everybody made an executive decision and delegated Quality's job to Somebody.

The peace in the Corporation was shattered when it was discovered that Nobody
was doing Quality's job.  Everybody was shocked and angry and decided to call
a meeting to find out what had happened.  Everybody went around muttering that
"Somebody should be fired."

At the meeting, Everybody said that Anybody was free to comment on the subject
but as it turned out Nobody did.  Everybody then asked Somebody to explain
what happened.  Somebody worked up his courage and told his story.  "Quality's
job can be done by Anybody but because he's unreliable, Everybody agreed to do
it.  Everybody found himself too busy so he delegated Quality's job to me.  I
quickly found out that although Everybody feels Quality's job is important,
he's not really interested so I decided to delegate the job to him.  That's how
Nobody ended up doing Quality's job."

Everybody was furious... "How dare you do such a thing, without even telling me
about it.  Anybody will tell you that you can't delegate the job of Quality."
Somebody stood his ground saying, "I only followed your example in delegating
Quality's job."  Nobody snickered.  Everybody went red with anger and
embarrassment and said, "Why can't I find Anybody to take responsibility for
Quality's job?"  Somebody shot back, "Why should Anybody be responsible for a
job that Nobody is doing?"  At last report, Anybody and Everybody were still
arguing about who should do Quality's job.

The moral of this long and twisted tale is this:

   "Even though Quality's job can be done by Anybody, Everybody must do it.
   If everybody tries to dump Quality's job on Somebody, then Nobody ends up
   doing it.  All this will make Everybody very angry and Somebody might lose
   their job".

   Also, when you decide to define Quality's job, make sure that....
   (1) Anybody can understand what's expected
   (2) Somebody is actually "doing" it
   (3) Everybody is responsible for it
   (4) Nobody is left out of it

An out-of-work salesman was once again pestering the manager of a
local haberdashery for a job.  The manager was tired of the persistent
whining, so he made him a deal.  "Look," he says to the salesman,
"I'm going to lunch for about an hour.  You see that suit in the corner?"
The salesman gulped and replied, "Uh, the purple, yellow, and green
one?"  The manager said, "That's the one.  If you can sell that suit
while I'm gone to lunch, you get the job.  If you don't sell it, you
don't bother me about a job ever again.  Deal?"  The salesman was
desperate, so he agreed.  The manager went to lunch secure in the
knowledge he had gotten rid of this pest once and for all.

Upon his return from lunch, the salesman comes running up to him,
exclaiming, "I sold the suit!  I sold the suit!"  But the salesman
is a mess!  His clothes are torn, his face is scratched and bleeding,
he's in terrible shape.  The manager looks at him wryly and says,
"Did the customer put up that much of a fight?"  To which the salesman
replies:

"No, but his seeing eye dog sure was pissed!"

Down in South Joisey there's a jernt owned by... well, by certain
undisclosed individuals needing a channel by which moneys can be
introduced into respectable commerce.  The manager approaches Joe,
the bandleader, early one evening.

"Listen, Joe, Big Louie's comin' in later and he wants... he
wants to sing."

"Hey, man, we been playin' here every night for fourteen years.
You oughta know don't nobody sing wit' us."

"Joe, I'm talking about *Big Louie*.  You get me?"

"Oh, okay, boss.  Whaddaya want us to do?"

"You know `Strangers in the Night', right?"

"Hey, you know we play that every night for the last fourteen years..."

"Okay, but he wants you to do it in (pause) 5/4."

"That's *ridiculous*!  ... Well, okay..."

So ten o'clock rolls around and sure enough, there's this big guy at the
door with these other two big guys.  He walks straight to the stage,
says to Joe, "You know what to do, right?"

"Riiight."

Grabs the microphone...

(Long pause for suspense)

[Sing this part in 5/4]
"Strangers in da fuckin' night,
Exchangin' fuckin' glances,
Strangers in da fuckin' night..."

Well, maybe ya hadda be there.



IS ENGLISH THE HARDEST LANGUAGE OF ALL?

I take it you already know
Of tough and bough and cough and dough.
Others may stumble, but not you
On hiccough, thorough, laugh, and through.

And cork and work and card and ward,
And font and front and word and sword.
Well done!  And now if you wish, perhaps
To learn of less familiar traps.

Beware of heard, a dreadful word
That looks like beard and sounds like bird.
And dead:  it's said like bed and not like bead--
For goodness sake don't call it deed.

Watch out for meat and great and threat,
They rhyme with suite and straight and debt.
A moth is not a moth in mother,
Nor both in bother, broth in brother.

And here is not a match for there,
And dear and fear for bear and pear.
And then there's dose and rose and lose--
Just look them up--and goose and choose,

And do and go, then thwart and cart.
Come, come, I've hardly made a start!
A dreadful language?  Man alive!
I'd mastered it when I was five.



Heard at a party:

There was this man who was in a horrible accident, and was injured.
But the only permanent damage he suffered was the amputation of both
of his ears.  As a result of this "unusual" handicap, he was very
self-conscious about his having no ears.

Because of the accident, he recieved a large sum of money from the
insurance company.  It was always his dream to own his own business,
so he decided with all this money he had, he now had the means to own
a business.  So he went out and purchased a small, but expanding
computer firm.  But he realized that he had no business knowledge at
all, so he decided that he would have to hire someone to run the business.

He picked out three top candidates, and interviewed each of them.

The first interview went really well.  He really liked this guy. His last
question for this first candidate was "Do you notice anything unusual
about me?"  The guy said, "Now that you mention it, you have no ears."
The man got really upset and threw the guy out.

The second interview went even better than the first.  This candidate was
much more better than the first.  Again, to conclude the interview,
the man asked the same question again, "Do you notice anything unusual
about me?"  The guy also noticed, "Yes, you have no ears."  The man
was really upset again, and threw this second candidate out.

Then he had the third interview.  The third candidate was even better than
the second, the best out of all of them.  Almost certain that he
wanted to hire this guy, the man once again asked, "Do you notice
anything unusual about me?"  The guy replied "Yeah, you are wearing
contact lenses."  Surprised, the man then asked "Wow!  That's quite
perceptive of you!  How could you tell?"  The guy answered "Easy.  You
can't wear eye glasses.  You don't have any f*cking ears!"
