Reported as a true story:

When you're on "reserve" with an airline, you fly when they tell you 
to fly. Being unable to be contacted is a lesser offense than refusing
or missing an assigned trip.

This captain gets an "A" for his creativity in avoiding an assignment.
When crew scheduling woke him up at 3 A.M. to assign him to a 5 A.M.
departure, he passed the phone to his wife and said in a voice loud
enough for them to hear on the other end, "Here, darling, I think it's
someone calling for your husband."

Crew scheduling omitted the usual question and answer period.

			BASEBALL

(as explained to a foreign visitor)

You have two sides one out in the field and one in.

Each man that's not on the side that's in goes out and when he's out he
comes in and the next man goes in until he's out.

When three men are out the side that's out comes in and the side
that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out.

Sometimes you get men still in and not out.

When both sides have been in and out nine times including the not outs

That's the end of the game!

There were these two dogs in a vet's waiting room, each eyeing the
other suspiciously. One of them turns to the other.

"What are you here for?" he asks.

"Well," replies the other, "I was feeling really bad the other day,
and Master's six year old son started bothering me. I tried to ignore
it, but I was feeling so rotten that I bit his hand off."

"I don't blame you. So, what are you here for?"

"Erm... well... Master reckons that I'm too vicious, so I'm going to
be... you know... I'm going to have the *operation*..."

"Oh dear. I'm sorry," sympathised the first dog.

Time passed. The about-to-be-neutered dog coughed politely.

"So," he asked, "What are you in here for?"

"Oh, nothing really," the other replied, embarrassed.

"Go on, tell me. Please..."

"OK. Well, it's like this. The bitch next door was in heat, and so I
was feeling... you know, a bit randy. Then Mistress came into the
kitchen wearing a short skirt and no underwear, and she bent over. I
just couldn't resist it!" admitted the dog.

"Oh, so you're here for the operation too, then."

"No," came the reply, "I'm here to have my nails clipped!"

Here's an old one but it compliments the religious one you forward.


                           God Damn Fish


One day a nun was fishing and caught a huge fish for supper.  

A man was walking by and said: "Wow, what a god damn fish"!

The Sister said: "Sir, you shouldn't talk to me like that. I'm a nun."

And the man said: "But that's the name of it, a god damn fish."

So the Sister took the fish back to the rectory, and said:
"Mother Superior, look at the god damn fish I caught."

The Mother Superior said: "Sister, you shouldn't talk like that,"

..and the Sister said:  "But Mother Superior, that's the name of it,
a god damn fish."

So the Mother Superior said: "Well, give me the god damn fish and
I'll clean it".

While she was cleaning the fish the Monsignor walked in and she said:
"Monsignor, look at the god damn fish that the sister caught".

The Monsignor said: "Mother Superior, you shouldn't talk like that",
and the Mother Superior said: "but that's the name of it, a god damn fish".

So the Monsignor said: "Well, give me the god damn fish and I'll cook it".

That evening, at supper, there was a new priest at the table,
and he said:  "Wow, what a nice fish,"
...and the Sister said "I caught the god damn fish,"
...and Mother Superior said "I cleaned the god damn fish,"
...and the Monsignor said, "I cooked the god damn fish."

And the new priest said "I like this fucking place already"!

New York Times, August 8, 1989, Letter to the Editor, by Ruth L. Kaplan:

The other day I bought a roll of 25 cent postage stamps.  I have not
had a moment's peace since.  For, upon unfurling this roll, I
discovered that every one of the 100 stamps bears the unmistakable
likeness of the American flag.

To appreciate my consternation, consider what is in store for these
stamps.  First, I must lick the flag-- er, stamp.  Then I will drop it
into a dark box, where it may well be bruised, possibly even torn.
Next, the stamp/flag will go to the Post Office, where an inexorable
machine will stomp on it, defiling it with ugly lines in order to
"cancel" it.

"Cancel" our inviolable flag?

But wait.  The horrors mount.  In time, the stamp will reach the
addressee, who may rip it, eagerly opening the envelope.
Ultimately, the flag stamp-- licked, cancelled, defaced, ripped-- will
be consigned to the trash, doomed to decompose in a dump, linger in a
landfill or-- shudder!-- be converted to charcoal and burned under a
steak.

What's a patriot to do?

I wonder if the Post Office will allow me to return a rerolled roll of
stamps.  But even it it does, it'll just resell it, perhaps to some
insensitive stamper who will lick, deface, cancel and rip those flags
without a twinge of conscience.

I pray (but not in school) for some official, even Presidential, guidance.

Ruth L. Kaplan is a retired Federal (but not postal) employee.

A friend of mine worked as a State Highway patrolman in Wyoming for several
years.  Whenever he pulled someone over for speeding, he would always ask
them why they were exceeding the speed limit.  If the excuse was original,
he would usually let them off with a warning.  He said the best excuse he
ever got was the following:

Him: "So, why is it that you were doing 70 mph in a 55 zone?"
Driver: "Well, officer, my wife is going to get pregnant in 30 minutes
	 and I want to be there when it happens."

	The Baseball description reminds me of how this
native went to his first cricket match and described it
to his witchdoctor after he got back. I heard it when
I was in college and have no idea where it originated.

	He said "It was a beautiful sunny Sunday. A big
crowd of people gathered around this giant grass field
with a thin strip of mowed and flattened pitch in the middle.
There were three sticks at either end of the strip.
A man in a long overcoat came out with two men in sweaters
and he tossed a coin in to the air. They went out and out
came eleven men in sweaters and white pants. One of them was padded
and had big gloves. Then out came two men with pads on their legs 
and small gloves holding big sticks. They took positions at
either end of the strip and one of the other men came running
towards the wickets and threw this ball at the person holding
the stick. And lo and behold it started to pour.

	White man sure knows how to make rain"

A true and sort of bizzare story....

Source:  San Diego Union newspaper, Aug. 3, page F-2....


   Actor Rob Lowe wants his insurance company to pay his legal fees or
any damages awarded to a Georgia woman suing him over her teen-age
daughter's appearance in a homemade pornographic videotape.

But the Chubb Custom Insurance Company of New Jersey said Lowe's
insurance policy does not cover "intentional actions" such as
using "celebrity status as an inducement to females to engage in
sexual intercourse, sodomy, and multiple-party sexual activity for
his immediate sexual gratification and for the purpose of making
pornographic films."

The Chubb folks have asked a federal judge in Atlanta to rule that
damages arising from making sex tapes in a hotel room are not a covered
item under a homeowner's policy.

(But exactly what DOES that policy cover anyway???)

work, work! Finally it dawned on the two guys that the foreman left every day
at 3:00 in the afternoon. So they decided to start leaving at 3:15.

 The very next day when the foreman left at 3:00, Stan and Ed left at
3:15. Stan goes home, walks through the house, opens the bedroom door, and there
on the bed is his wife and the foreman. Stan quickly runs back to the job and 
digs like mad until 5:00. The next day when Ed arrives at work, Stan says,
 "Listen Ed, we can't knock off work any more at 3:15.....
I almost got caught!!!!"

(Kinda long, but it makes a good party joke:)

A small balding <ethnic> storms into a local bar and demands "Gimme a double of
the strongest whiskey you got!  I'm so pissed I can't even see straight!"

The bartender, noticing that the little man is a bit the worse for wear,
pours him a double of Southern Comfort.

The <ethnic> swills down the drink and says "Gimme another one!".

The bartender pours the drink, but says "Now, before I give you this, why don't
you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"

So the <ethnic> begins his tale:

"Well, I was sitting in the bar next door when this gorgeous blonde slinks in,
and actually sits beside me at the bar.  I thought WOW, this has never happened
before.  You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true.  Well, a couple of
minutes later I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans
over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested?  I couldn't believe this was
happening!  I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand, and starts
walking out of the bar.  So of course I went with her.  This was just too good
to be true!"

"She took me down the street here to a nice hotel and up to her room.  As soon
as she shut the door she slips out of her dress.  That was all she was wearing!
I tell you it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes!  But as soon
as I jumped into the bed, I hear some keys jingling, and someone
starts fumbling with the door."

The blonde says "Ohmygod, it's my boyfriend.  He must have lost his wrestling
match tonight, he's gonna be real mad!  Quick, HIDE!"

"So, I opened at the closet, but I figured that was probably he first place he
would look, so I didn't hide there.  Then I looked under the bed, but no, I
figured he's bound to look there, too.  By now I could here the key in the lock. 
I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my
fingers praying that the guy wouldn't see me."

The bartender says "Well I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this
point."

"Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open and he yells out 'Who
you been sleeping with now, bitch?'  The girl says 'Nobody, honey, now come to
bed and calm down'.  Well the guy starts tearing up the room.  I hear him tear
the door off the closet and throw it across the room.  I'm thinking 'Boy, I'm
glad I didn't hide in there.'  Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it
across the room.  Good thing I didn't hide under there either."

"Then I here him say 'What's that over there by the window?'  I think 'Oh Shit,
I'm dead meat now'.  But the blond by now is trying real hard to distract him
and convince him to stop looking."

"Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long
time, and I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a
sudden the asshole pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right
on top of my head!  I mean look at this, I got second degree burns all over my
scalp and shoulders!"

The bartender says, "Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."

"No, that didn't really bother me.  Next the guy starts slamming the window shut
over and over on my hands.  I mean, look at my fingers.  They're a bloody mess,
I can hardly hold onto this glass."

The bartender looks at the guy's hands and says "Yeah, buddy, I can understand
why you are so upset."

"No, that wasn't what really pissed me off."

The bartender then asks in exasperation, "Well, then, what DID finally piss you
off?" 

"Well I was hanging there, and I turned around and looked down, and I was only
about 6 inches off the ground!"

NEW INFANTS MIRACLE DIET FOR OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE 

  Flabby Americans are always on the look out for a new diet.  The trouble
with most diets is that you don't get enough to eat (the starvation diet) or
you don't get enough variation (the liquid diet) or you go broke (the all-meat
diet). 

  Consequently, people tend to cheat on their diets, or quit after three days,
or go right back to stuffing their faces after it is all over.  Is there
nothing you can do but give up and tell your friends that you've got a gland
problem?  Or is there a slim hope? Such is the Infants' Miracle Diet. 

  Over the years, you may have noticed, as I have, that most two-year olds are
trim.  It came to me one day over a cup of black coffee and a carrot that
perhaps their diet is the reason.  After consultation with pediatricians,
X-ray technicians and distraught mothers, I was able to formulate this new
diet.  It is inexpensive, offers great variety and sufficient quantity. 
Before embarking on the diet however, be sure to check with your doctor,
otherwise you might have to see him afterward. 


FIRST DAY: 

  Breakfast:  One scrambled egg, one peice of toast with grape jelly. Eat two
bites of egg, using your fingers; dump the rest on the floor.  Take one bite
of toast, then smear the jelly over your face and clothes. Lunch: Four crayons
(any color), a handful of potato chips, and a glass of milk (three sips only,
then spill the rest). Dinner: A dry stick, two pennies and a nickle, four sips
of stale beer. Before Bedtime, toast a piece of bread and toss it on the
kitchen floor. 


SECOND DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Pick up stale toast off kitchen floor and eat.  Drink half
bottle of vanilla extract or one vial of vegetable dye. Lunch: Half a tube of
Pulsating Pink Lipstick, and a cigarette (to be eaten not smoked).  Ice cube
if desired. After lunch, lick an all day sucker until sticky, take it outside
and drop it in the dirt.  Retrieve it and continue slurping until it is clean
again.  Bring it inside and drop it on the rug. Dinner: A rock or and an
uncooked bean, which should be thrust up your left nostril.  Pour iced tea
over mashed potatoes; eat with spoon. 


THIRD DAY: 

  Breakfast:  Two pancakes with plenty of syrup, eat with fingers, rub fingers
in hair.  Glass of milk, drink one-half, stuff pancakes in glass.  After
breakfast pick up sucker from rug, lick off fuzz and put on cushion of your
best chair. Lunch: Three matches, peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Spit
several bites onto the floor.  Pour milk on table and slurp up. Dinner: dish
of ice cream, handful of potato chips, some wine, coffee. 


LAST DAY: 

  Breakfast: a quarter tube of toothpaste (any flavor), bit of soap, an olive,
pour glass of milk over bowl of cornflakes, add 1/2 cup sugar.  When cereal is
soggy, drink milk and feed cereal to dog. Lunch: Eat crumbs off kitchen floor
and dining room carpet, including bites of sandwich you spit out yesterday.
One soft drink. Find sucker and finish eating it. Dinner: A glass of spaghetti
and chocolate milk.  Leave meatball on plate.  Stick of mascara for dessert.

would happen to the the kidnapers themselves if the hostages
were not released.  You can imagine what NBC would have said
if the US had done this.

New York Times, 25 April 1989, in an article on new operating systems for the
IBM PC:

    Real concurrency---in which one program actually continues to function
    while you call up and use another---is more amazing but of small use to the
    average person.  How many programs do you have that take more than a few
    seconds to perform any task?

For many years, I've battled with the infamous "Dunlop's Disease" ... 
a condition caused by age and lake of proper maintenance in which 
your "stomach `done lopped' over your belt."
I had noticed that most women do not suffer from this condition,
many of them accumulating any excess weight on the hips and thighs,
and/or under the belt.

I've recently discovered, however, that some women also suffer from a 
malady similar to Dunlop's disease in that it is also caused by age 
and lack of maintenance called "Bureau Breakdown" ... 
in which your chest falls into your drawers.

since I'm omnipresent--I listen to all the radio stations at once,

	Computer Stories from a Field Service Engineer
        ---------------------------------------------

When I worked for a company that had a contract with 3M, 3M had asked me
to write them a memo describing why we were having problems with diskette
failures.  I said in the memo that the disks were failing due to head
crashes.  "If the customers would just clean their heads periodically, we
wouldn't have these problems," I said in the memo.  One customer responded
with "What kind of shampoo do you recommend?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An end-user hotline received a call about a bad software disk.  They asked
the customer to make a copy of the disk and mail it in to the hotline.
A few days later, they received a letter with a mimeographed copy of
the disk.  Since it was a double-sided disk, both sides of the disk
had been xeroxed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Computer Operator says as she is lifting an RP06 disk pack from the drive:
"Gee, how much does one of these weigh?"
Me: "It depends on how much data is on the disk....
The operator believed it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	I had a similar experience while working as a student operator at
Michigan Tech. One particularly trying afternoon, the computer was merrily
crashing for a number of reasons. After about four such spectacles, we
broadcast that the computer would be down for the remainder of the afternoon.
There was a resigned groan from the users and they began to file out of the
Center, except for one comely young woman with wide blue eyes who wandered up
to the counter and queried:
	"What's wrong with the computer?"
Too tired and irritated to give her a straight answer, I looked her straight 
in the eye and replied: "Broken muffler belt."
A look of deep concern wafted into her expression as she asked:
	"Oh, that's bad. Can you call Midas?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I work for University Computing Services answering questions about any and all
aspects of computing here, and as a result I run into some truly astonishing
mental densities...  A few excerpts from the Helpdesk:
Caller: "What's the name for when you're entering data into the computer?"
    HD: "Data Entry."
Caller: "Thank you!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overheard in a student computer lab:
Client (raising hand and waving frantically): "The computer says 'Enter your
name and press RETURN.'  What do I do??"
Lab Assistant: "Enter your name and press RETURN."
Client (as if a revelation has struck): "Oh!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another friend of mine in a similar situation reports having a student in the
lab one day, who had to abort out of the SET PASSWORD sequence because he 
couldn't think of a six-letter word.

		News of the Weird

newborn child to die in a dormitory closet, wrapped in plastic bags)

	The U.S. Air Force announced that an MX missile accidentally
dropped seven inches in its silo in Wyoming last June.  The cause was

	A February report from Finland's Health Ministry, concerned about
declining population and a high incidence of stress among workers
recommended that people should take "sex holidays" from work.  The
proposal was immediately endorsed by a Lutheran church official in
Finland. 

	In February the Environmental Protection Agency inspector
general told a congressional committee that its toxic waste cleanup
program is so badly managed that the agency hired contractors as
telephone receptionists for $30 an hour. 

	Patrick Kennedy (son of Senator Edward Kennedy) spent $8,000 for
the 1,324 votes ($66 per vote) he received in last year's primary for the
part time Rhode Island legislature seat he eventually won. 

	San Francisco official accused two cities of intentionally
"dumping" mental patients in their city by buying them one-way plane
tickets there.  The director of the city's mental health program said,
"San Francisco is identified as the city of the crazies.  We do much
more than other cities and counties.  "

Franklin County (Ohio) libraries would receive funds, the director of
the Columbus Public Library slapped the director of the Bexly Public
Library, who retaliated with a punch.

	Los Angeles police Daryl Gates suspended officer Juan Gomez in
December for having broken wind in the faces of two arrestees in

	Willie Carrol Williams, thirty-seven, was arrested in Sarasota,
Fla., for bank robbery in December.  According to police, he had no
getaway car but hailed a taxicab outside the bank and paid the driver to
take him to local malls for a Christmas shopping spree.  After police
trapped him an hour later, the taxi driver quoted Williams as saying,
"When you've got the money, you might as well spend it."
