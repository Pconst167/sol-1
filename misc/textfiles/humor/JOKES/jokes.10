    There was a rumour about two years back that TI was starting
    work on a hardened Lisp Machine that would a) be about the size
    of an IBM-PC or smaller, and b) be designed to operate in helicopters,
    tanks, etc.  Is MCC trying to do this kind of thing too?  Does
    anyone know whether this project actually got started, and what
    its current status is?

MCC has been contracted by and has delivered to SDIO a "hardened" lisp
machine for phase I of SDI.  That is, able to withstand 30ATM
overpressure, immersion to 600 meters, EMP, and cafeteria food.  The
hardened machine, sufficient for running any existing lisp application
comes with 500K words of memory, a 30-key keyboard, and 7-segment
display, selling for $186,000 each (qty 50).  An optional
flame-retardent mouse is an additional $30,000.

We have submitted a bid for phase II, which we think can be accomplished
by 1995.  Phase II involves re-entry against hardened targets, high
resistance to religious zealots and connectionism, and low radar and
congressional profile.  Projected cost: $1.2M/qty 50.

	In our image processing lab we recently had a chance to
    digitize and then re-view some of the Presidential campaign
    speeches.  Of particular interest was George Bush's famous
    "Read my lips, No New Taxes" speech.

	We hired a speech specialist and showed the tape to her over and
    over several times.  Not only was the tape played back slowly,
    but we performed a zoom operation on the (now) President's face.  As
    she read his face for clues, it became painfully obvious to her that
    George Bush was saying -- "Read my lips, No Nude Taxes". 

	With this subjective information, we called the White House 
    for an explanation.  Reluctantly the White House Staff admitted that
    yes, that was correct - "The President planned to clothe new taxes
    as user fees".

	One day an engineer is going into a new grocery shop on the outskirts
of town. When just inside, he sees a sign which says:

	"CONDOMS: SOLD & FITTED."

	He looks around and calls for service. Then, an exceptionally attractive
young lady emerges.

	"Do you work here?",he asks.

	"Yes",she replied.

	"And is the statement ao the sign over there true?"
The lady leans over the counter and says seductively, "Yes."

	"Tell me," he asks, "who fits them?"

	"I do," said the lady.

	"Well," said the engineer, "would you please wash your hands and give
me a pound of tomatoes."

Speaking for the whole company, Mr. Sizya Lubuva of Kinondomi, Dar es Salaam,
said: "A number of us were having a conference about the future of the village
as a tourist center when Mr. Nuugu Tabara said he would climb up the palm under
which we were sitting to get some coconut milk for us.  No sooner had he 
climbed the tree, than he was attacked by a huge Indian crow and fell down 
onto the roof of Mr. Malinjoo's Ford Fiesta.  There is no truth to the 
suggestion that we were boozing away our time on komoni, although I agree 
coconut milk is one its ingredients.  Everyone knows how dangerous those crows 
are.  They will snatch food off your plate, and last week they stole three 
bedsheets and a loudspeaker from my sister's house."

 This guy was walking through the zoo one day. When he was in front of
 the gorilla cage he bent down to tie his shoe. He noticed through the
 corner of his eye that the gorilla had also bent down. Then when he stood
 back up he saw that the gorilla also stood back up. To see if it was a
 coincidence, he bent down to tie his other shoe and once again the gorilla
 bent down. He stood up and the gorilla stood up. After glancing over his
 shoulder to make sure that nobody else was around, the man jumped up in the
 air. And you guessed it, the gorilla jumped up. The man was getting a kick
 out of it. He started making faces at the gorilla and the gorilla would
 copy everything he did. Finally the man got next to the cage and pulled the
 lower lid of his right eye down. At this point the gorilla reached through
 the cage pulled the guy in, threw the guy around the cage, and generally
 beat the shit out of him, then threw him back out of the cage. After
 hearing all the commotion, the zookeeper came running over to the man.

 "What on earth happened?" asked the zookeeper. "I don't know" said the man.
 "He seemed calm a second ago. I was jumping around and he was jumping
 around and he was doing every thing I was doing. Then all of sudden after I
 did this (pulls lower eyelid down) he got all mad and beat the hell out of
 me." "Well no wonder!!!" exclaimed the zookeeper. "That" (pulls lower
 eyelid down) "means F... YOU in gorilla talk!" "Oh" said the man not quite
 satisfied.
 
 He left the zoo but returned an hour later with a large shopping
 bag. Again, after making sure that no one was watching, he started jumping
 around and the gorilla did the same. After a minute or two of this he
 grabbed the bag and pulled out two butcher knives and threw one of them
 into the cage. He lifted the other knife over his head at which point the
 gorilla grabbed his knife and also lifted it over his head. After a minute
 of cutting the air with his knife and watching the gorilla do likewise the
 man snuck a large salami out of the bag with his other hand and stuck it
 between his legs. With a sweeping motion he came down with the knife and
 whacked off the salami "WHACK!!!" At this, the gorilla simply looked at the
 man and pulled down his lower eyelid.

        Time: Early Sixties.  Place: Yourtown, USA
        
             A young unmarried couple decides after a few dates that
        they are going to sleep together.  So, the guy, Tom, goes to
        the local pharmacy to buy some condoms. 

             Tom goes up to the pharmacy counter and asks the
        pharmacist for some Trojans, (just like the kid in Summer of
        '42).  The pharmacist looks at Tom disgustedly and says,
        "What's wrong with you kids today, ya go on two dates and you
        wanna go to bed with each other.  Why can't ya save sex for
        when ya get married.  You should wait until you're married!
        Sex before marriage is a sin ya know."

             Well Tom calmed down the pharmacist and explained that
        his generation was a little different.  He said that he and
        his girlfriend were just trying to act responsibly and take
        precautions against pregnancy and disease.  The pharmacist
        conceded that times were changing and finally sold him the
        condoms.

             That same night Tom was invited over to his girlfriend
        Katey's house for dinner with the family.  When they all sat
        down, Tom asked Katey's father if he could say grace.  Her
        father said yes and Tom proceded to say a beautiful eleven
        minute grace thanking everyone from the Pilgrims to the
        President for the meal they were about to eat.

             After dinner Katey took Tom aside and smiling, said,
        "Tom, you never told me you were so religious!"  Tom smiled
        back and said, "Well, Katey, you never told me you father was
        a pharmacist."

was that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could

When I was in London several months ago, I was staying in a hotel that is
well known for its great service.  Anyway, we got back from the theater one
night at around 12:30 AM, and we decided to call for a little tea and apple
pie.  So anyay, we phoned down for it, and an hour passed and it still had
not come.  

I phoned down again and asked when the apple pie might be here.  The response 
was:

"Oh, we beg your pardon sir, it's just leaving the kitchen now.  It should be
up to your room momentarily."

To that, I asked, "But I ordered it an hour ago.  What took so long?  What
were you doing, baking it?"

"Yes, sir."

I put the phone down.

I heard this one a few years ago in East Germany.....

Erich Honnecker (the president of East Germany) was invited to Moscow
by Gorbachev for a visit.  After weeks of preparation by Gorby,
Honnecker arrives in Moscow.  As part of of celebration activities,
there is a big parade through the streets of Moscow. 

While the two are watching the parade, Gorbachev takes a small boy
aside and asks him, "Who is your mother?"  The child repiles, "Mother
Russia."  "And who is your father?", asks Gorbachev.  The boy answers,
"Why, its you Uncle Gorbachev!".  Finally Gorbachev asks the boy, "and
what do you want to be when you grow up?".  The boy proudly replies,
"a good communist!".

Erich Honnecker, meanwhile, has been watching this and is very
impressed.  So impressed, that he decides to invite Gorbachev to
[East] Berlin for a visit.  Again, after weeks of preparation,
Gorbachev's plane lands in Berlin.  And again, part of the celebration
includes a parade.

Remembering what Gorbachev did in Moscow, Honnecker repeats the scene:
He asks a little boy in the crowd, "Who is your mother?"  The child
replies "the GDR [German Democratic Republic--East Germany]."  "And
who is your father?", asks Honnecker.  "Why, its you Uncle Honnecker!",
replies the child.  "And what do you want to be when you grow up?"
queries Honnecker.  Without hesitation, the boy replies "an orphan."

I heard the following many years ago from a friend who heard it in person at a
public lecture by the famous C. Northcote Parkinson at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras. Since this is second-hand (and from memory), it may not be
an exact quote but is close enough. The original delivery almost brought the
house down, as the cliche' goes.

     Government's handling of a difficult matter by appointing a Commission
     of Enquiry is just like a person going to the toilet -- there is a
     sitting, a report, and then the matter is dropped!

(alt.fusion cull, apparently true)

(This is a rumor that's making the rounds in the Netnews alt.fusion
discussion; I refer Netnews readers there for more information.)

There's a rumor that a Swedish chemist, back in 1926, submitted a
patent application for a technique of using palladium to turn hydrogen
into helium (essentially, the same setup that's behind the recent
"fusion in a jar" excitement).

There's another rumor that he gave up, because the technique generated
too much heat!

(Source: Playboy Magazine)

A Frenchman and an Italian were seated next to an American in an overseas
flight.  After a few cocktails, the men began discussing their home lives.

    "Last night I made love to my wife four times," the Frenchman bragged,
"and this morning she made me delicious crepes and she told me how much she
adored me."

    "Ah, last night I made love to my wife six times," the Italian responded,
"and this morning she made me a wonderful omelet and told me she could never
love another man."

    When the American remained silent, the Frenchman smugly asked, "And how many
times did _you_ make love to your wife last night?"

    "Once," he replied.

    "Only once?" the Italian arrogantly snorted.  "And what did she say to you
this morning?"

    "Don't stop."

As told to me by a friend in the British Army:
 
A British officer spotted a "busker" (street singer/bum) at the
bottom of the escalator of the London Underground.  The busker
had a sign which read: "VETERAN SOLDIER OF THE FALKLANDS WAR."
The officer thought, "Poor chap, I was there and it was awful!"
Feeling sorry for a fellow veteran, the officer took 20 pounds out of
his wallet and gave it to the busker.  The officer was then greeted 
with a hearty: "Gracias, Senor!!"

(Cannot remember the origin, but this was my 'favorite' tasteless joke to
tell for many years)

Seems a mute was walking down the street one day and chanced upon a friend
of his (also a mute).  In sign language, he inquired how his friend had been
doing.

The friend replied (vocally!) "Oh, can that hand-waving shit.  I can talk now."

Intrigued, the mute pressed him for details.  Seems he had gone to a 
specialist, who, seeing no physical damage, had put him on a treatment 
program that had restored the use of his vocal chords.

Gesturing wildly, the mute asked if he might meet this specialist.  They got
an appointment that very afternoon.

After an exam, the specialist proclaimed that there was no permanent damage,
that the mute was essentially in the same condition as his buddy, and that
there was no reason why he couldn't be helped as well.

"Yes, yes" signed the mute.  "Let's have the first treatment right now!"

"Very well," replies the specialist.  "Kindly go into the next room, drop
your pants and lean over the examining table.  I'll be right in."

The muts does as instructed, and the doctor sneaks in with a broomstick,
mallet and jar of Vaseline.  Greasing the broom handle, he "sends it home"
with a few deft swipes of the mallet.

The mute jumps from the table, screaming "AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

"VERY good," smiles the doctor.  "Next Tuesday, we start with 'B'"

(This was current 25 years ago in Montreal.)

    One very cold night, a young man dropped into the local
brothel and the madam said, "You'll have to wait."

    "But there's lots of girls that aren't busy right now."

    "Yes, but several of the rooms are closed for repairs."

    "Listen, I'm pretty desparate. I don't need a room."

    So she takes his money and he goes upstairs with one of
the staff and, after looking for a place to consummate the
transaction, they decide to do it on the roof. But it's a
very cold night, and they freeze to death and fall to the
sidewalk.  A passing drunk looks them over, staggers to the
door, and knocks.

    "Go away!" says the madam. "We don't allow drunks in here!"

    "I don't want in," says the drunk.  "I just wanted to tell
you that your sign fell down."

An engineer, a physicist and a mathematicians have to build a fence around
a flock of sheep, using as little material as possible.

The engineer forms the flock into a circular shape and constructs a fence
around it.

The physicist builds a fence with an infinite diameter and pulls it together
until it fits around the flock.

The mathematicians thinks for a while, then builds a fence around himself
and defines himself as being outside.

            SCIENTIST DISCOVERS NEW ELEMENT - ADMINISTRATIUM
 
    The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
    University physicists.  The element, tentatively named Administratium
    (AD), has no protons or electrons, which means that its atomic number
    is 0.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron,
    75 vice-neutrons and 111 assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives
    it an atomic mass number of 312.  The 312 particles are held together
    in the nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
    meson-like particles called memos.
 
    Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be
    detected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which
    it is present.  According to one of the discoverers of the element, a
    very small amount of Administratium made one reaction that normally
    takes less than a second take over four days.
 
    Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which time
    it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in
    which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the
    vice-neutrons exchange place.  Some studies have indicated that the
    atomic mass number actually increases after each reorganization.
 
    Administratium was discovered by accident when a researcher angrily
    resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped
    all of his papers in the intake hatch of the University's particle
    accelerator.  "Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports,
    grant forms, etc. with the particles in the accelerator created the
    new element."  an unnamed source explained.
 
    Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium
    might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist,
    Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university
    campuses, and in large corporation and government centers, near the
    best-appointed and best-maintained building.

The structure of the deuterium (heavy hydrogen) nucleus can be
described as "a proton married to two neutrons."

Maybe that's why the fusion experiments only work in Utah.

I can't understand why Corey Aquino won't allow Ferdinand Marcos back into
the country to die.
..After all, he let her husband come back into the country to die.

It's the first time that father is giving baby Jan a bath.  After a while
mother hears baby Jan crying and screaming.

She goes to the bathroom and sees that father is dragging baby Jan through
the water with his ears!

"What are you doing," asked mother to father, "you are holding him by his
ears!"

"Do you want me to burn my hands," replied father ....

A "classified government laboratory" in Great Britain has
allegedly reported successful replication of of the 
"Fleischmann Cold Fusion Effect" (note they didn't mention Pons),
with some subtile difference in technique.

The principal difference appears to be that the

The Toronto Star has a weekly column by an attorney, consisting of
humorous excerpts from court transcripts.  The following appeared
a few weeks ago:

In a jury trial in Battleford, Sask., a few decades back, a farmer
was charged with bestiality after he became amorous with one of his
cows.

The chief Crown witness, the hired man, testified that he saw his
boss place a milk stool behind the cow, then stand on the stool
and take liberties with the cow.  Moments later, the witness said,
the cow kicked over the stool and the farmer fell to the floor
of the barn.

Upon hearing this, a farmer in the jury box slapped his thigh and
exclaimed, "They'll do that every time!"

I got this from a neighbor who works for a fish packing company...

			NEWS BULLETIN!!!

Today, in a tragic accident at the Exxon corporate headquarters, the
fish truck "Prince William Express" slammed into the side of the main
building of the new corporate headquarters spilling more than 20 tons 
of dead herring, salmon, sea otters and various other wildlife on to
the pristine lawn of the Exxon complex.

Skipper Joe Woodhead was passed out the in the sleeper compartment of the
state-of-the-art fish truck when the trusk struck the clearly-marked
building.  "Bobo", the skipper's dog, had thewheel at the time of
the accident.  Bobo, whose certification does not permit him to drive
on planet earth, was unavailable for comment, and confirmed sources
suggest he has a history of drug abuse.

The skipper contends that he was not drunk at the time of the
accident, but when he realized the seriousness of the spill he ran
out to a local tavern and pounded down a half-dozen beers.  Woodhead
also contends that he told Bobo to give him a "Bud light", not a "hard
right".

The President of the Prince William Express Co. said that they would
assume full responsibility for the spill and would submit a plan in
about a month on the proposed clean-up procedure.  He also stated
that thjey ship over a million tons of seafood a year and that an
accident like this is just the price we have to pay to eat fish.

When asked about the clean-up equipment for such a spill, company
officials commented that a small pickup with a shovel in it was in
Gopher Spits, Iowa, but had a flat tire and therefore would be unable
to be dispatched to the scene.

On the market side of things, fish prices will increase by 20% for
all species.

Vice President Dan Quail flew to the texaco headquarters today and
reported that there appeared to be no damage, and was returning to
Washington, DC.

A husband and wife were lying in bed one night.  (Since they have small
children, the universal-parent coding system for sex is washing machine.)  
The husband turned to his wife and said in a seductive voice "washing
machine."   The wife, being the hard working parent she is, was tired
and she said "Not tonight, dear; I'm tired."   He rolled away.

Five minutes later, he rolled back over and repeated "Honey, washing machine."
She said "I've got a headache."

He rolled away again.   Ten minutes later, the wife, feeling guilty, turned
to her husband and said, "OK, washing machine."

He replied.  "That's OK.  It was a small load and I did it by hand."

Here's one people can tell to their grandmothers:

Once upon a time there was a famous sea captain.  This captain was very 
successful at what he did; for years he guided merchant ships all over the 
world.  Never did stormy seas or pirates get the best of him.  He was 
admired by his crew and fellow captains.  

However, there was one thing different about this captain.  Every morning 
he went through a strange ritual.  He would lock himself in his captain's 
quarters and open a small safe.  In the safe was an envolope with a piece 
of paper inside.  He would stare at the paper for a minute, then lock it 
back up.  After, he would go about his daily duties.  

For years this went on, and his crew became very curious.  Was it a 
treasure map?  Was it  a letter from a long lost love?  Everyone speculated 
the contents of the strange envolope.  

One day the captain died at sea.  After laying the captain's body to rest, 
the first  mate led the entire crew into the captains quarters.  He opened 
the safe, got the envolope, opened it and...  

The first mate turned pale and showed the paper to the others.  Four words 
were on the paper, two on two lines: 

``Port Left Starboard Right''

riding their bicycles.  When they arrived at the monastary and had dis-

	The first student replied, "The bicycle is carrying the sack of
potatoes.  I am glad that I do not have to carry them on my back!"  The
teacher praised the first student, "You are a smart boy!  When you grow 
old, you will not walk hunched over like I do."

	The fourth student replied, "Riding my bicycle, I live in harmony

	The fifth student replied, "I ride my bicycle to ride my 
bicycle."  The teacher sat at the feet of the fifth student and said, 
"I am your student!"

One night, Erich Honnecker was in the bedchamber having some pillow talk
with his mistress.  He was in a magnanimous mood and offered her a
present of her choice.

She thought about his offer for a moment and then replied, "Oh, Erich,
if there is one thing I would like you to do for me, it is this: open
the borders just for one day."

Honnecker said, "Of course, my dear," but was a bit puzzled by her
request.  He asked, "But why would you have me do such a thing?"

The mistress replied, "I want to be alone with you."

I had misplaced the paper this was in and thought I'd lost it.
I just now found it and thought the following article would be of
interest.  I's from the 14 March 1989 issue of "Weekly World News" --
one of those supermarket tabloids.

Computer Charged with Murder After Frying Chess Champ
by Ragan Dunn

A Soviet super-computer has been ordered to stand trial for the murder
of chess champion Nikolai Gudkov -- who was electorcuted when he
touched the metal board that he and the machine were playing on!

"This was no accident -- it was cold-blooded murder," Soviet police
investigator Alexei Shainev told reporters in Moscow.

"Niko Gudkov won three straight games and the computer couldn't stand
it.  When the chess master reached for his knight to begin play in the
fourth game, the computer sent a lethal surge of electricity to the
board surface.  The computer had been programmed to move its chess
pieces by producing a low-level electric current.

"Gudkov was electrocuted while a gallery of hundreds watched."

The decision to put the computer on trial stunned legal experts around
the world.  [I hope computer experts are also shocked, so to speak.
--spaf] But the Soviets are convinced that the computer had the pride
and intelligence to develop a hatred for Gudkov -- and the motive and
means to kill him.

The mind-boggling murder drama unfolded during a six-day chess
marathon between the M2-11 supercomputer and Gudkov, a world class
chess player.

According to reports, Gudkov defied all odds [Calculated by the same
supercomputer, no doubt. --spaf] and beat the machine in three consecutive
games.  And when they prepared to begin their forth, a deadly dose of
electricity flowed up into the electronic board and zapped Gudkov dead.

Soviet authorities initially thought that the surge of electricity was
caused by a short-circuit.  But an examination of the computer
revealed no problems.

It was later determined that the machine diverted the flow of
electricity from its brain to the chess board to ensure a victory over
Gudkov. [This implies that Soviet semiconductors work at voltages of a
few hundred volts, or maybe their supercomputers are tube-based?
--spaf]

"The computer was programmed to win at chess and when it couldn't do
that legitimately, it killed its opponent," said investigator Shalnev.

"It might sound ridiculous to bring a machine to trial for murder.
[!!]  But a machine that can solve problems and think [sic] faster
than any human must be held accountable for its actions."

Rudi Hagemann, the Swiss legal scholar, agreed with the Soviet cop.

He said that the development of artificial intelligence has come so
far in recent years that certain computers and some robots "must be
considered human."

It isn't clear how the Soviets will punish the computer if it is found
guilty when it goes to court this spring. [Send it to a Gulag for
reprogramming? --spaf]

But Hagermann says the machine will probably be reprogrammed or dismantled
altogether.

******

I don't think there's much to say here, except in the way of warning:  next
time you accuse the system of cheating at rogue, don't say it too loudly!

My dad found this on a bulletin board at work many years ago.  My
sister recently found a copy hiding in some old school stuff she was
throwing out.  A good challenge is to try to read the entire piece
aloud without laughing.  Neither I nor my sister can do it.


The Eighteen Bottles

    I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by my
wife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or
else...  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  I
withdrew the cork from the first bottle and pured the contents down the
sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew
the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the
exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from
the thrid bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I
pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the
bottle down the glass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the
cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down
the glass.  I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork
down the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the
drink and drank the pour.  When I had everything emptied, I steadied
the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks
with the other, which were twent-nine, and as the houses came by I
counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle,
which I drank.  I'm not under tha affluence of incohol as some tinkle
peep I am.  I'm not half as thunk as you might drink.  I fool so
feelish I don't know who is me, and the drunker I stand here, the
longer I get.

   A duck walks into a pharmacy waddles up to the prescription counter
and rings the bell.  The pharmacist walks up and asks, "Can I help
you?".  The duck relplies, "Yes, I would like a box of condoms".
"Why certainly", says the pharmacist, "will that be cash or would
you like me to put it on your bill?".  The duck answers, "What kind of
duck do you think I am?"
