There are two people, a man and a woman, sleeping in bed...

The woman feels this poke poke poke...
she rolls over and says, "what, honey?"
He says, "well, you know...."
She replies, "I can't.  I have a gynecologist appointment tomorrow morning
and I just had a shower.  I have to be fresh for this."
and she rolls over and goes back to sleep.

15 minutes later she feels this poke poke poke...
She rolls over and says,  "What now, dear?"
He says, "Are you sure that you can't?"
She replies, "I am sure.  I just had a shower for my gynecologists
appointment is first thing in the morning, and I won't have time in the
morning for a shower.  I have to be fresh and clean for this...now shove
off..."

15 minutes later she feels this poke poke poke...
She rolls over and says, "What!"
He replies, "You wouldn't happen to have a Dentist's appointment too would
you?"
