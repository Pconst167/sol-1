<I think I originally saw this in Playboy>

"Miss Jones, we can't employ you as a model", the editor from the men's 
magazine explained.  "It's too obvious that your blonde hair isn't natural,
since the hair between your legs is black".

The model picked up a paperweight and slammed it down on the editor's fingers.

"What the hell did you do that for!", he exploded.  She smiled sweetly and
said "Look at your fingers.  They're turning black, right?  And they've
only been banged once."

What is the difference between Northern and Southern racism?

A southern racist doesn't mind blacks living nearby, as long as they
don't get "uppity"

A northern racist doesn't mind blacks getting "uppity" as long as they
don't live close.

Two friends are discussing politics on Election Day, each
trying to no avail to convince the other to switch sides.

Finally, one says to the other:  ``Look, it's clear that
we are unalterably opposed on every political issue.  Our
votes will surely cancel out.  Why not save ourselves some
time and both agree to not vote today?''

The other agrees enthusiastically and they part.

Shortly after that, a friend of the first one who had heard
the conversation says, ``That was a sporting offer you made.''

``Not really,'' says the second.  This is the third time I've
done this today.

A friend of mine told me this one.

Two men were at a poker game that had run late; 3:00 AM to be exact

Man1:  You know what I hate about these games?  When I go home.
       I turn off my headlights, turn off the engine, and coast into the
       driveway.  Then I go to the front door, take off my shoes and
       sneak in as quietly as I can.  But my wife always wakes up and
       we end up having a fight.

Man2:  What I do instead is drive into the driveway, honk the horn a few
       times, get out of the car, slam the door, go in the house and slam
       the door.  Then I yell "Honey, I'm home", run upstairs, slap her on
       the ass and say, "How about a little love woman".  And she never
       even moves.

               The "Raving"...read and take heed.
                
               Once upon a midnight dreary, while I
               pondered weak and weary,
               Over many a quaint and curious
               volume of forgotten lore.
                
               While I nodded in the hushing, suddenly
               there came a rushing, as of someone
               slowly flushing water 'cross my chamber
               floor.  Only this and nothing more.
               Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I
               sought to borrow plungers to relieve my
               sorrow, mops to dry the soggy floor.
               I slowed it down and nothing more.
               
               Ankle deep in water standing, long I stood
               there wheezing, panting, weeping, cursing
               curses no mortal ever cursed before.  As the
               mess was slow subsiding, my thoughts were
               strong to go a-riding to dry my troubled
               clothes, perhaps to find a liquor store.
                
               I jumped astride my motor scotter, a big
               black bird screamed "Roto-Rooter"!
               "And away go troubles down the drain" --
               Roto-Rooter.  Quoth the raven: "Evermore."

Whilst on bush-walking trips, one hears many offensive jokes, and this
one is no exception.....

One day a journalist, hard-up for a story, was sitting on an Australian beach.
As he gazed pensively out to sea, he saw a young woman thrashing about in the
water.  Upon further observation, he saw a shark circling her.  His adrenalin
pumping, he wondered what he could do to save her.  Then a well built young
man, who was jogging along the beach, suddenly dashed into the sea, karate
chopped the shark, killing it, and helped the young woman swim to the beach.

The excited journalist, seeing a fantastic story, ran up to the young man and
said, "That was the most courageous thing I've ever seen in my life.  I'm
going to let the world know about this.  You'll be famous.  I can see it now,
<Brave Bronzed Aussie Saves Girl From Killer Shark>!" 

The young man turned to the journalist and said, "But I'm British."

The journalist replied, without losing enthusiasm, "Oh, that doesn't matter."

The next day, the headlines read, <Pommie Bastard Kills Girl's Pet>.

I feel before the joke I should mention a few things. First, I am a
Christian. Second, I feel that It is wrong to ridicule Christ as a
Christian. However, I feel that it is my duty to show people what kind
of Charletons are out there. Through this true story you can see how a
person who "Speaks with Authority" can make a joke out of a serious
matter. It is OK to laugh at the antics, but please don't use this as
a reason to condemn a whole religion.  Feel free to mail me if you
have any questions.

I was watching TV one night when while flicking through the stations I
came across a TV Evangelist. Now, being Christian, I decided to get a
fulfilling and meaningful message which he would preach. Now, I have
seen TV Evangelists before (I'll call them TVE) and some I enjoyed
immensely such as Pat Robertson and Billy Graham. However, I asn't
prepared for this man......

"You! Yes YOU can be blessed by the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY <Something
muttered in toungues for 5 seconds> just by sending me a small
contribution of only two thousand dollars! The LORD <More toungues>...
OH YES HE IS HERE  <More Toungues> The LORD... I hear him telling
me... oh YES Lord that YES he wants You! Yes You! <toungues> to GIVE
ME Two THOUSAND Dollars to support my minestry! The LORD Will Return
in one Hundred fold! Here is a True Story...."

Some Woman: I turned on his show ondering how I would be able to make
my house mayments. At that time he as asking for Two hundred. Then GOD
told me to give because the price is going up very soon. I got the
money I DON'T KNOW HOW for my payments.

"Yes! ANOTHER GREEAT TESTIMONY! You know, WWWhen I first started, I
was asking for 50 dollars a person. Then the LORD GOD <Toungues
again>... Yes the LORD GOD HIMSELF! Came to ME Haleluia <More
toungues>! He Came to ME and said 'Don't ask for fifty anymore.' So I
raised it to One Hundred. The the LORD <More Toungues>... the LORD
asked me to not ask for One Hundred.  So I asked for Two Hundred. Then
He asked me to stop, and I raised it to Five Hundred, then One
thousand.. NOW the Lord asked me to no longer ask for $1000. So now,
as the LORD GOD has asked me Haleluiah! <toungues> The LORD GOD asked
me! I ask you for $2000!!! The Lord wants you to give it to me. If you
do, I will send you this piece of cloth which I prayed with and has
been annoited by the Holy Spirit! This Cloth is FILLED with the Holy
Spirit. Pray with this cloth and you TOO can be filled with the Spirit
>From this cloth! So Send NOW!"
