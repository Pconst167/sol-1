                               IS ALWAYS PREGNANT

It's time throw some bull -- not just any kind of bull, but an Irish bull.
And while we're at it, let's throw a whole herd of Irish bulls.

What is an Irish bull?  Some dismiss it as a silly blunder, allegedly endemic
to the Emerald Isle.  Others more affectionately describe an Irish bull
as a statement fueled by a delightful absurdity that sparks forth a memorable
truth.

A favorite definition of the genre issued from Professor John Pentland Mahaffey
of Dublin University.  When asked the differennce between an Irish and
any other kind of bull, Mahaffey replied, "An Irish bull is always pregnant."
providing a definition that is itself an example of the form defined.

     Irish literature and folklore are fraught with bulls:

     *  An Irishman is never at peace except when he's fighting.

     *  An Irishman will die before letting himself be buried outside of
        Ireland.

     *  May you never live to see your wife a widow.

     *  Gentlemen, it appears to be unanimous that we cannot agree.

     *  God bless the Holy Trinity.

     *  The most unpleasant thing about him is that when he isn't drunk,
        he's sober.

     *  Talk about thin!  Well, you're thin. and I'm thin, but he's as thin
        as the pair of us put together!

     *  Half the lies our opponents tell about us are not true.

     *  This piece is chock full of omissions.

     *  A man cannot be in two places at once, unless he is a bird.

     *  I marvel at the strength of human weakness.

     *  Your Honner, I was sober enough to know I was dhroonk.

     Any implications that the Irish have cornered the bull are completely
unwarranted.  Some of the best bulls thrive far from the green fields of
Ireland, and Americans have contributed more than their share of taurine
eloquence:
