A burglar had been casing a particular house for some time.  Finally, he
saw the owners leave for what appeared to be an extended camping trip.
That night he broke in through a basement window and was trying to find
his way in the dark when he heard what seemed to him to be the voice of
a very old woman saying "Shame on you!  I see you, and Jesus sees you!"
Startled, the burglar snarls back "Shut up, Grandma, or you're gonna
get hurt!"  He shines his flashlight all around, but no Grandma.
Again the voice: "Shame on you!  I see you, and Jesus sees you!"
Finally, the beam of the flashlight finds a large cage and in it
a pretty upset parrot.  Relieved, the burglar turns back around and
starts toward the stairs, only to spot an enormous slavering doberman
waiting at the top.  Just then the parrot screams, "Sic'em, Jesus!"

An American General, a Russian General and a British General are standing on
the deck of a ship watching war exercises (OK, OK, so this is an *old* one..).
The topic of discussion turns to human courage, and the Russian General boasts,
   "Russians are the most courageous people on Earth!".

Upon which the American (naturally) challenges him: "Oh YEAH?".

The Russian says, "Sure! Here, Yuri! Jump off the deck (into the freezing
Atlantic) and swim around the ship!"

Yuri marches off without a word, and does as he is told. The Russian turns
around and says: "See, there's an example of courage!"

The American *has* to top this, so he calls up one of his underlings and gives
him the order:

   "Jack, Jump off the main mast into the ocean, and swim around the ship
   seven times!"

Poor Jack goes off without a murmur, and he too does as he is told. The
American General says: "Now top *that* for courage!"

So they both turn around to the British General who has been standing around
watching these antics silently. They ask him: "What about *your* people?".

So the British guy calls up one of his people and says: "Trevor, jump off the
mast and swim under the keel of the ship, will you, old chap?"

Trevor stares at his general.

 "Let me get this right. You want me to jump off the mast."
 "Yes."
 "And swim under the keel"
 "Yes."

 "You must be daft!"

And so saying, Trevor turns around and saunters off. Whereupon the British
General turns to the other two and says,

  "Now *there*'s an example of TRUE courage!"

An old man is lying on his deathbed with all his children,

One of the grandchildren is immediately dispatched to honor the old

"Did you bring me one last piece of your grandmother's delicious

Arthur was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and

"You should be ashamed of yourself young man!  Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol
is the blood of the devil!"

Now Arthur gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive.
"How do _you_ know Sister?"

"My Mother Superior told me so"

"But have you ever had a drink yourself?  How can you be sure that what you
are saying is right?"

"Don't be ridiculous - of course I have never taken alcohol myself"

"Then let me buy you a drink, - if you still believe afterwards that it is
evil I will give up drink for life"

"How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!"

"I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, them no-one will know"


The Nun reluctantly agrees, so Arthur goes inside to the bar.

"Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks", then he lowers his
voice and says to the barman ".. and could you put the vodka in a teacup?"

"Oh no!  It's not that bl**dy Nun again is it?"

SCENE:  It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a rabbit is sitting
        outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his typewriter.

        Along comes a fox, out for a walk.  

FOX:    "What are you working on?"
RABBIT: "My thesis."
FOX:    "Hmm.  What's it about?"
RABBIT: "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes."
        (incredulous pause) 
FOX:    "That's ridiculous!  Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes."
RABBIT: "Sure they do, and I can prove it.  Come with me."

        They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow.  After a few
        minutes, the rabbit returns, alone, to his typewriter and resumes
        typing.

        Soon, a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hardworking
        rabbit.

WOLF:   "What's that you're writing?"
RABBIT: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat wolves."
        (loud guffaws)
WOLF:   "You don't expect to get such rubbish published, do you?"
RABBIT: "No problem.  Do you want to see why?"

        The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit
        returns by himself, after a few minutes, and goes back to typing.

SCENE:  Inside the rabbit's burrow.  In one corner, there is a pile of
        fox bones.  In another corner, a pile of wolf bones.  On the other
        side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth.

My favourite two campus practical jokes:

1. Arrange the light switches in a lavatory and an adjacent room so that
flipping one switch also flips the other.  Consider the resultant scene
(visible from the outside just by watching the windows): the room's resident
retires for the evening, turning off his (or her) light.  Some time later,
someone else decides to use the head, and turns on the light.  After a few
minutes, the resident awakes, decides that someone is pulling a fast one,
and turns the light off ... on the guy (or girl) who is by now seated on
the throne!  If it works correctly, the two unfortunates end up standing
at their respective light switches, with the lights oscillating rapidly
(by which time the perpetrators are rolling on the ground outside laughing
their heads off).

2. This prank happened a number of years ago.  Two guys had been pulling
practical jokes on each other for quite a while.  Finally, one of them got
a pair of rather large (and LOUD) firecrackers, and wired them to light
bulb bases with nichrome wire such that applying power would set off the
firecrackers.  One of the devices was installed in the victim's room, the
other in the perpetrator's.

That evening, the victim returned to his room, and turned on the light.
There was a short delay as the fuse burned, and during that delay the victim
(quite naturally) turned to see what was wrong with the light -- BLAM!  Well,
the victim was (quite naturally) upset and flustered and resolved to do some-
thing appropriately horrendous to the perpetrator's room.  He went over to
the perpetrator's room, his own counter-prank in hand, went in, and turned
on the light.  When nothing happened, his reflexes again betrayed him: he
looked up at the light -- BLAM!

Apparently, the victim never bothered to counter-stack the perpetrator.

This is a joke told by Dave Allen on one of his
shows (British program 'Dave Allen at Large').

A drunk leaves a bar and decides to take a shortcut through a
graveyard.  It is raining heavily and very dark.  The drunk
fails to see an open grave and falls into it.  He tries to
climb out of it, but it is too deep and the rain has turned
the dirt to mud and has made it too slippery to climb.  He
gives up after a while and decides to spend the night there.

A while later, another drunk leaves the same bar and decides
to take the same shortcut through the graveyard.  He, too,
falls into that open grave and tries to climb out but the
mud is too slippery.  The first drunk is still sitting there
and watches as the other drunk tries but fails to get out.

The first drunk stands up, taps the second drunk on the shoulder
and tells him, "You'll never get out!".

He did.

Dave Allen is an excellent storyteller and a very inventive
comedian.  I'm afraid that just reading it here doesn't do justice

(And now... the saga continues...)

   A city boy went duck hunting in the country one day. While hunting
he shot a duck which fell on the property of a farmer. The boy crawled
over the fence to claim his kill. But, the farmer, seeing what had
happened rushed out with his shotgun and yelled, "See here! That duck
belongs too me!"

   The city boy replies, "But I shot the duck, therfore it belongs to me!"

   The farmer says, "It fell on my property so it belongs to me!" They
continue to argue, each claiming ownership of the duck. After awhile the
farmer says, "We should settle this the old-fashioned way."

   The city boy asks, "What is the 'old-fashioned way'?"

   The farmer explains, "First, I kick you in the groin. Then, you kick
me in the groin and we continue in this fashion until one of us gives up.
The one who wins gets the duck."

   The city boy, willing to do anything to get his duck and leave, agrees
to the contest. The farmer draws back his leg and kicks the city boy in
the groin with all his might. The city boy, in horrible pain, falls to the
ground moaning and groaning. After about 10 minutes of this, the city boy stands
up shakily and croaks, "Its my turn now."

Here's one I wish I'd written:

A man and a woman walk into a very posh Rodeo Drive furrier.
"Show the lady your finest mink!" the fellow exclaims.  So the
owner of the shop goes in back and comes out with an absolutely
gorgeous full-length coat.  As the lady tries it on, the
furrier sidles up to the guy and discreetly whispers,
"Ah, sir, that particular fur goes for $65,000."

"No problem!  I'll write you a check!"

"Very good, sir." says the shop owner.  "Today is Saturday.  You
may come by on Monday to pick it up, after the check has cleared."

So the man and the woman leave.  On Monday, the fellow returns.
The store owner is outraged: "How dare you show your face in here?!
There wasn't a single penny in your checking account!!"

"I just had to come by," grinned the guy, "to thank you for the
most wonderful weekend of my life!"

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Secretary Eduard Shevardnadze
met on the eve of the recent super-power summit.

	"What can we do to impress the Americans?" Gorbachev asked 
Shevardnadze.
	Replied the foreign secretary: "Well, we could open the gates of
the Soviet Union for 24 hours."
	"Don't be crazy," Gorbachev replied. "Everybody would go and
it would leave only the two of us sitting here."
	"Speak for yourself," shot back Shevardnadze.

 The IBM salesman and the IBM system analyst went to spend 
a weekend in the forest, hunting bear.
 They hired a log cabin, and when they got there, took 
their backpacks off and put them inside.
 At which point the salesman said to the systems analyst:
 "You unpack while I go and find us a bear."
 The analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat 
outside to await events. He did not have to wait too long.
 Soon he could hear noises in the forest. The noises got 
nearer - and suddenly there was the salesman, running 
across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the 
largest and most ferocious Brown Bears the analyst had 
ever seen.
 "Open the door! shouted the salesman.
 The analyst opened the door.
 The salesman ran to the door, suddenly stopped, and 
stepped aside.
 The Bear carried by its momentum, continued though the 
door and disappeared inside.
 The salesman promptly shut the door on it, turned, looked 
at the analyst, and said:
 "Ok, you skin that one while I go rustle us up another."

[ This one is interesting because many of the things listed have already

For years people have been predicting that Usenet will collapse.  Like
the ancient Roman civilization, there will be indicators of this impending
collapse, when it nears. These will include:

Somebody other than Henry Spencer will post from utzoo.

Utzoo will be upgraded in cpu and/or operating system (from an 11/44 runn
version 7)

Seizmo will cease to exist, cutting off the east coast.

Decwrl's Usenet readership data will expire, because nobody there reads
news anymore.

The line eater will re-appear.
(note: it has appeared on Bitnet, but looks a lot like the 'last card in
the reader' problem)

Bitnet will stop truncating files at 80 characters, eliding trailing
blanks and translating ASCII to funky characters.

Ihnp4 will become reliable.

Eugene Myia will start saying "Don't send me mail -- follow up!"

Bob Webber will do something GOOD for the network.

The Brahms Gang will do something GOOD for the network.

Eric Mading will core dump.

Talk.Bizarre will drop from the volume ratings.

The alt.* subnet will be absorbed into the main network with no protests
>From either parties.

Mailing lists on Bitnet and the Internet will cease to exist, being
replaced with a news-like interface thus doing away with the random
"Please add me to your list" postings.

Gene Spafford will stop posting his monthly group lists.

There will be NO April Fools pranks pulled.

Today marks the first birthday of rec.humor.funny.  Thanks to all my
submitters for a funny year, and thanks to the readers, too.
(Please don't mail to thank me, the 700 Poll responses were enough.)

My only disappointment is that the group still shows only 85% propagation
on the net surveys.  If your site doesn't get the group yet ...
then how the hell are you reading this?  But seriously, since this group
does have one of the best volume/readership ratios around, I'm not sure
of the origin of this figure.

Now might be a good time to review the posting regs, but I think I'll wait
until after vacation time is over for a full scale review.  Quick reminder:
	a) No form feeds
	b) ONE joke per submission, with an informative subject
	c) Mail rather than post the jokes (It's hard to reply to posted stuff)
	d) I reply to every submission, but about 25% of these replies bounce
	e) Do not rotate what you send me, it's annoying.
	f) Please tell me where you heard it, and tell me if you wrote it.
	   I am more lenient with original stuff.
	g) I believe the U.S.'s founding fathers intended to make a system
	   where you could get off on technicalities.
	h) There is no rule 6.
	i) BMW stands for "I'm a frayed not."
	j) Gestation is a bitch, and then you're born.

	Willie hung his head. "You win," he said, handing her the fiver.
	Miss. B couldn't wait for him to leave so she could get to a phone to 
	call his father. She reported what had happened. "Mr. Gaines,"

>From an article in the Globe & Mail, Jul 26, written by Bryan Johnson, in
Pakistan:

     First he tells of a pilot who spotted tracer bullets as he approached
a runway in Norhtern Pakistan.  So the pilot swung around and approached
the runway from the other end only to find bullets winging by there too.
So he tried to land on a road and cracked up.
	
	From whence came the bullets?  Afghan rebels?  Terrorists?  No,
just "one hell of a wedding party."  In the Peshawar region, wedding 
guests can rent an AK-47 for a day for $2 or the use of a water buffalo.
With tragic results.  In one case, "jubilant" cousins accidentily
"blasted away" the bridegroom's father.  The wedding was postponed for 40 
days of mourning, then again celebrated amid "ecstatic volleys of flying
lead."

	In another wedding in the region, shots from a wedding severed
high tension electrical wires, the falling wires electrocuted 8 guests and
set parts of the village on fire.  As well there have been sevearl injuries
to people not even attending the weddings who happen into the path of a
stray bullet.

	Although authorities have promised to crack down, little success is

expected.  In the words of a city councillor, "If I do not use my gun when
invited to a wedding, I will be considered a mouse, not a man."

	Rambo would be proud.

P.S. along a similar note, although Rambo III has not been pulling in the 
North American box office receipts the producers would have liked, they 
are reportedly not worried because Rambo movies pull 80% of their gross 
>from foreign receipts.

     I am writing this on the morning following an event of great national
shock.  The Republicans have chosen Dan Quayle as the Vice-Presidential
candidate.  Quayle is a young man, 41, and part of the interpretation is that
the party wants to appeal to the Baby Boomer generation.  This is a colossal
miscalculation in this commentator's opinion.  I know.  I am from the Baby
Boomer generation myself.  (Okay, let's say late in the Baby Boomer generation,
very, very late, okay?)  I can tell you most of this generation are people who
are getting along but haven't hit it big.  Some of us even ride garbage trucks
or clerk in stores.  It's not going to appeal to us to see that had we played
our cards differently we could have been Vice-Presidential candidates by now.
That's more for people maybe twenty years or so older, we tell ourselves.  Now
this thing happens and every Baby Boomer has to face the fact that some slob
our age--or in my case somewhat over--is making it big.  And there are other
similarities.  Quayle's family owned newspapers.  My family owned newspapers.
The difference is my family kept ours stacked under the cellar steps; his
family published them, so didn't have to keep them under the steps.  In any
case, this is all very sobering news and I hope the Republicans are prepared
for the kind of backlash they will get from us politically-aware Baby Boomers.

                                        Mark R. Leeper

[ What I want to know is, what's Quayle got against Canada??  If he wanted
  to dodge the war, we have a perfectly good country up here he could have
  visited.  Does he have a secret foreign policy agenda we don't know about? ]

TEN REASONS WHY NEW YORKERS PREFER BEACHES IN NEW YORK STATE.

10)  It really feels at home swimming in sewage.

9) You can improve your arithmetic by counting the rats that float
   by.

8) Studies have shown that shark repellent is no substitute for high
   bacterial levels.

7) The shellfish truly come in interesting shapes and designs.

6) The Iranian revolutionary guards have planted mines only in the
   Persian Gulf.

5) The dolphins are so friendly that they wash up on the beach to make
   place for you and your kids in the ocean.

4) With these dangerous epidemics in the air, it MUST be safer in the
   water.

3) In case of emergencies, medical AIDS are never more than an
   arms-length away.

2) Mario Cuomo performs his daily ablutions in the ocean
   and the Democrats haven't as yet washed away.

1) Ed Koch swims at Cape Cod.

Oh I am just a typical American boy	[with a filthy rich grandpa]
> from a typical American town		[where my daddy runs the newspaper]
I believe in God and Senator Dodd
and keeping old Castro down.		[not to mention Daniel Ortega]
And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red,		[or is it better red than dead?]
but when I got to my old draft board,
buddy this is what I said.		[for I was already in the Nat'l Guard]

Sarge I'm only 18, I got a ruptured spleen	[my father made a few calls]
and I always carry a purse;
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat	[friends made some more calls]
and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes think of my career and my sweetheart dear	[America needs more lawyers!]
and my poor old invalid aunt;
besides I ain't no fool I'm going to school	[Even as a teenager I loved the
and I'm working in a defense plant.		 military-industrial complex]

I got a dislocated disk & a racked up back	[My daddy made me carry the
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs;		 entire circulation one day]
when the bombshell hits I get epileptic fits
and I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.		[the Dukakis campaign knows
I got the weakness woes I can't touch my toes	 I smoked pot in law school]
I can hardly reach my knees;
and if the enemy came close to me		[I've always been allergic
I'd probably start to sneeze.			 to slanteye communists]

I hate Chou Enlai and I hope he dies,		[now I love Deng Xioping]
but one thing you gotta see:
that someone's gotta go over there		[why can't the poor go fight?]
and that someone isn't me.			[you bet-- my daddy's rich]
So I wish you well, Sarge give 'em hell,
kill me a thousand or so;			[torture a few Nicaraguans too]
if you ever get a war without blood and gore
I'll be the first to go.			[that's why I support SDI!]

So there's this magician working on a small cruise ship. He's been doing his
routines every night for a year or two now. The audiences appreciate him, and
they change over often enough that he doesn't have to worry too much about
new tricks. However, there's this parrot who sits in the back row and watches
him night after night, year after year. Finally, the parrot figures out how
the tricks work and starts giving it away for the audience. For example, when
the magician makes a bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squaks "Behing
his back! Behind his back!" Well, the magician get really annoyed at this,
but he doesn't know what to do. The parrot belongs to the Captain, so he
can't just kill it.

One day, the ship springs a leak and sinks. The magician manages to swim to a
plank of wood floating by and grabs on. The parrot is sitting on the other
end of the plank. The just stare at each other and drift. They drift for 3
days and still don't speak. On the morning of the fourth day, the parrot
looks over at the magician and says: "OK, I give up. Where did you hide the
ship?"

          the Croftbuilder? No, they don't.

          And did you pass the nets down in the harbour? Well, I made
          several of them, but do they call me Donald the Netmaker? No,

	This morning, one of our users told me of something he'd read
about businesses and UNIX.  It appears that many businesses are buying
UNIX rather than VMS (thereby annoying DEC) because of it's simplicity
in generating reports and other day-to-day business applications.

	He was wondering if we could get this wonderfully simple UNIX, to
replace the complicated and confusing UNIX we currently have.

[ A fellow named Bill Pfieffer, an engineer in Portland, OR, told me these
   jokes; Bill is an imigrant from West Germany, and German humor has always
   been a little different from ours. ]

 In the Bundeswehr (West German army) a company of soldiers decided to have
some fun with their company cook, a short, fat, very un-martial young man.
So every morning before he woke up, one of them would defecate into his boot.
The amazing thing was that the cook accepted this treatment silently. Every
morning he would clean out his boot and go to work as if nothing was wrong.

 After several weeks of this, the soldiers began to tire of the game; it
wasn't very much fun because the cook never reacted, and they were beginning
to feel guilty as well. So they sent a delegation to apologize to him and
promise to mend their ways.

 The cook heard them out, then said "You are going to stop shitting in my
boots? Fine, then I will stop pissing in your coffee".

New Programmer's Editor for the Amiga
-------------------------------------

Hot on the heels of Apple Computer's release of HyperCard is a new concept
in interactive text editors from Obscure Technologies Inc., named PunchEd.
For those wondering what HyperCard is, it's a new `metaphor' in human-computer
interaction, in which data, be they text, music or pictures, are represented
by a hierarchy of `index cards' which the user can activate or browse through 
by using mouse-sensitive gadgets.  Obscure Technologies has, as their promo-
tional literature states, contracted (not expanded) on the HyperCard idea in
their new programmer's editor, PunchEd.   In PunchEd, the visual metaphor 
presented to the user is that of a stack of punched paper cards, just like
those used extensively in the computer industry since the 1950s and with which
the company believes real programmers will feel more comfortable than with
full-screen text editors.

The cards can be viewed on the screen individually, or several can be
viewed spread out simultaneously (a process referred to as `fanning').  Like 
HyperCard, PunchEd allows the user to browse, or `riffle', through his or her 
`stack' of cards using the mouse.  Users must exercise some caution when 
riffling, since there is a chance that they could experience a `stack drop', 
where the carefully-arranged cards become hopelessly jumbled.  This reviewer 
somehow managed to perform a stack drop, an operation only slightly less 
frustrating than getting a stack overflow.  Fortunately, PunchEd provides
a `shuffle' command for getting things back in order again. There is also a 
facility whereby a previously entered card can be duplicated with a single
keystroke - quite a time-saver.  Other basic editor features, such as entering 
text, are also provided.  One small problem, however, is that there is no 
backspacing capability, so in order to correct your text, you must retype the 
offending line onto a new card and remove the old one.  Some users will, I'm 
sure, appreciate this attention to detail.

The feature of PunchEd that will probably make it a big success in the 
eyes of programmers is that command text can be included in the same file as 
the source code.  Goodbye, Make!  With the inclusion of a few simple cards at
the beginning of your file you can specify all the processing control you 
need.  For example, to compile and link your C program, just include the 
following:

//MYPROG JOB NAME=HELLO,CLASS=C
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=CC,PARM=(-S,+L)
//INCLUDE DD DSNAME=INCLUDE/STDIO.H,UNIT=DF0,DISP=SHR
//STEP2 EXEC PGM=LN
//STEPLIB DD DSNAME=C.LIB,UNIT=LIB,DISP=SHR
//* start of program
//*
main()
{
	printf("hello, world\n");
}

An 80-year old man read in the paper that someone had saved a life by
signing an organ donor card.  The man felt this was a noble thing to
do so he called the organ donor organization to see if he could get
a card.  Unfortuneatly, he was told that he was too old to donate his
organs when he died.  The lady at the organization did tell him that if
he wanted to give life in another way that he could go to the sperm bank
 - they take anyone of any age.  Rather pleased, the man went to the 
sperm bank.  After filling out the obligatory forms, the receptionist 
gave him a jar and pointed to a little room and said *You can go in 
there to donate, thank you*.  So the man went in and closed the door and
in a moment the receptionist heard this loud moaning and groaning.  She
felt a little embarrassed for the old man but did nothing.  The moaning 
and groaning continued for 20 minutes and finally she knocked on the door
and asked if the old man was all right.

The old man came out and said, *I'm really sorry.  I tried it with my left
hand, then I tried it with my right hand, then I tried it with both hands,
but I can't get the DAMN LID OFF THE JAR!!!

Satan comes down to visit a famous, utterly ruthless Hollywood producer.
Satan says, "Look, I have a business proposition for you.  I can get you
any deal you want, with anybody in the business, on any terms you like."

The producer's eyes light up.  "Hmm. . . and what do you want from me?"

Satan smiles. "Your immortal soul."

The producer sits back and ponders, stroking his goatee. "I don't get it.
Where's the catch?"

	I had an interesting Saturday night. With a group of friends I went to a
Pub to see a rock band. Usual story, loud music, smoke filled room and copious 
amounts of Emu Export. Come closing time me and a mate have had enough so ratherthan go nightclubbing in town we decide to catch a taxi home, but the fleet's in
so a cab is either full of marine's spew or horney sailors. It's a clear night 
so we decide to hitch back from Herdsmans Park to my home in Scarborough 
( about 8 km ), no problem.
	But consider this: would you stop for two six foot, more than slightly
drunk uni students in the wee small hours of the morn'? Funny that, nobody else
did either. But with more than half the distance covered and being bitterly coldwe spied food, sanctuary. So we rocked up to the girlie behind the counter and
asked, ( in a druken slurr ) "Do you do home deliveries?  One thin ham & 
pineapple pizza with garlic bread to be delivered in Scarborough."
	And we got home in time to watch "Barbarella" on tele' too.

		GURKHAS - THE MARTIAL RACE

Now that an accord has been signed between the GNLF of
Subhash ( not the go back to India one :-)) Ghising and the
Government of India, it might be appropriate to recollect
an interesting anecdote regarding these doughty warriors.

In World war II, an English reporter who had heard so much
about the bravery and elan of the Gurkhas visited a camp just
in front of the enemy lines (Germans).  During the course of
his reporting, he had occasion to observe a mission being
conducted.  The mission was to airdrop a bunch of soldiers behind
enemy lines to conduct some relatively light action.  He watched
the commander of the Gurkhas (a British soldier) pitch
the mission and then ask for volunteers.  To his surprise,
only about half the Gurkhas volunteered and were sent off.
Throughly disillusioned with the legends of Gurkha bravery,
the reporter went back home.  After the war, he happened to
run into a Gurkha who had been there, and asked him why
half the troops had failed to volunteer.  It turned
out that none of the squad, both those who volunteered and those
who did not, were aware that they would get a parachute for the drop.
Hence the low turnout.

        A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a leash.  He

        True enough, the man looked around, and noticed that everyone was

        "Ralph, open your mouth! BANG BANG BANG".  And the alligator opened
        it's huge mouth wide, revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth.
        The man pulls out his wang, and lays it in the alligators mouth, as
        the entire bar crowd gasps.  "Raplph! Close your mouth, but DON'T

Subject: A Math Teacher's Story
Keywords: true, chuckle
Date: 21 Sep 88 15:30:03 GMT

Years ago, I was taking an algebra class over the summer,
and had a teacher who liked to reminisce about his past with funny stories.
He relates that he had been a math teacher in the Air Force, where it was
his duty to force sleepy young recruits to stay awake for an hour of math
at 8:00 in the morning in a large, warm, dimly-lit auditorium.  One day,
he came into the auditorium and saw his class even sleepier and less attentive
than usual.  He realized that something drastic would have to be done.

Now this classroom was *very* old, and the blackboards, which had been nailed on
to the walls with old black iron nails, had become loose over the years.  As 
a result, these black nails jutted almost invisibly from the blackboard and
this teacher kept banging his hands on them while erasing the board.  He decided
to put them to good use.

With enough of a flourish to guarantee the class's attention, he went to the
front of the room, near one edge of the board.  Then, clearing his throat,
he drew a coathook right near one of the protruding nails.  He proceeded to 
hang his coat and hat on the hook that he had drawn in chalk (really
on the nail, of course).  Then he went on to give that day's lecture.  He told
us that the entire class had their eyes to the front of the room throughout the
lecture.  He didn't know if they'd heard a single word he'd said, but at least
they looked attentive.

At the end of the class, the lecturer would usually leave by a small door near the 
blackboards, while the class would leave through the large doors at the back of
the hall.  When class was over, he took his coat and hat, erased the coathook,
and left through the small door--and was followed by the entire class, lining up to 
go past the blackboard to see how he'd done it.

	Joan, the rather well-proportioned secretary, spent almost all of
her vacation sunbathing on the roof of her hotel.  She wore a bathing suit
the frist day, but on the second, she decided that no one could see her
way up there, and she slipped out of it for an overall tan.  She'd hardly
begun when she heard someone running up the stairs; she was lying on her
stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear.
	"Excuse me, miss," said the flustered little assistant manager of
the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs.  "The Hilton doesn't
mind your sunbathing on the roof, but we would very much appreciate your
wearing a bathing suit as you did yesterday."
	"What difference does it make," Joan asked rather calmly.  "No one
can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel."
	"Not exactly," said the embarrassed little man.  "You're lying on
the dining room skylight."

Don't ask me.  You take full responsibilty for decrypting the joke, and you

                        The Preying Mantis Syndrome

Many lower life forms demonstrate qualities that, at first, don't seem
very good for survival.  For instance, the female praying mantis, after mating
with, well, her mate, will devour him.  For the male praying mantis, however,
it is a catch-22.  If he mates, he gets screwed out of an opportunity to mate
again.  If he doesn't mate, he doesn't reproduce and that is the end of his
family tree (not that all insects live in trees, mind you).  This suicidal
behavior is commonly called the Preying Mantis Syndrome - and many life forms
are periodically subject to it's wrath.  How did the preying mantis become 
stuck in such a vicious cycle?  This is probably what happened beforehand:

  The male mantis arrives at the residence of the female mantis.  After some
courtship exercises (dinner, a movie, inserting the diaphram) they mate.  The
female mantis, her lust for...lust being satisfied relaxes while the Male raids
the refrigerator and returns home.  This behavior continues until the male and
female (mantissas?) establish a permanent relationship.  Then the male
establishes a new pattern of behavior:  Football on Mondays, baseball on
Tuesdays, happy hour on Wednesdays, Uh, working-late-at-the-office on Thursdays,
and bowling on Fridays.  The female tolerates this to a certain extent, then
files for a divorce.  After a long battle, she retires to her alimony-paid
home with a lesson well learned:  It simplifies matters tremendously to just
eat him when you're done with him.

  Well, through the process of evolution, the Preying Mantis Syndrome is
carried up into the highest life forms, even humans.  That is why, one week
out of every month, the female of the species will feel compelled to bite the
head off the male.  The Preying Mantis Syndrome is inescapable, but when it
occurs in the female of our species, it's best to just avoid them for a while.

				  LAST U.S. ARMY
				APO 001. U.S. ARMY

AG 4110.99 (DEBCA)					20 September 1944

SUBJECT	:  Indoctrination for Return to U.S.

TO	:  All Units.


1.  In compliance with current policies for rotation of armed forces overseas
it is directed that in order to maintain the high standard of character of the
American Soldier and to prevent any dishonor to reflect on the uniform all
individuals eligible for return to the U.S.  under current directives will
undergo an indoctrination course of demilitarisation prior to approval of his
application for return.

2.  The following points will be emphasized in the subject indoctrination
course:-

a.  In America there is a remarkable number of beautiful girls.  These young
ladies have not been liberated and many are gainfully employed as
stenographers, sales girls, beauty operators or welders.  Contrary to current
practice they should not be approached with "How much?".  A proper greeting is
"Isn't it a lovely day?" or "Have you ever been to Chicago?".  Then say "How
much?".

b.  A guest in a private home is usually awakened in the morning by a light
tapping on his door, and an invitation to join the host at breakfast.  It is
proper to say "I'll be there shortly".  DO NOT say "Blow it out your _____".

c.  A typical American breakfast consists of such strange foods as cantolopes,
fresh eggs, milk, ham, etc.  These are highly palatable and though strange in
appearance are extremely tasty.  Butter, made from cream, is often served.  If
you wish some butter, you turn to the person nearest it and say quietly "Please
pass the butter".  DO NOT say "Threw me the godam grease".

d.  Very natural urges are apt to occur when in a crowd.  If it is found
necessary to defecate, one does NOT grab a shovel in one hand and paper in the
other and run for the garden.  At least 90% of American homes have one room
called the "Bathroom", i.e.  a room that, in most cases, contains a bathtub,
wash basin, medicine cabinet, and a toilet.  It is the latter that you will use
in this case.  (Instructors should make sure that all personnel understand the
operation of toilet, particularly the lever or button arrangement that serves
to prepare the device for reuse).

e.  In the event the helmet is retained by the individual, he will refrain from
using it as a chair, wash bowl, foot bath or bathtub.  All these devices are
furnished in the average American Home.  It is not considered good practice to
squat Indian fashion in a corner in the event all chairs are occupied.  The
host usually will provide suitable seats.

f.  Belching or passing wind in company is strictly frowned upon.  If you
should forget about it, however, and belch in the presence of others, a proper
remark is "Excuse me".  DO NOT say "It must be that lousy chew we've been
getting".

g.  American dinners, in most cases, consist of several items, each served in a
separate dish.  The common practice of mixing various items, such as corn-beef
and pudding, or lima beans and peaches, to make it more palatable will be
refrained from.  In time the "Separate Dish" system will become enjoyable.

h.  Americans have a strange taste for stimulants.  The drinks in common usage
on the Continent, such as underripe wine, alcohol and grapefruit juice, or
gasoline bitters and water (commonly known by the French as "Cognac") are not
usually acceptable in civilian circles.  A suitable use for such drinks is for
serving one's landlord in order to break an undesirable lease.

i.  The returning soldier is apt to find often that his opinions differ from
those of his civilian associates.  One should call upon his reserve etiquette
and correct his acquaintance with such remarks as "I believe you have made a
mistake", or "I am afraid you are in error on that".  DO NOT say "Brother,
you're really f----d up".  This is considered impolite.

j.  Upon leaving a friend's home after a visit, one may find his hat
misplaced.  Frequently it has been placed in a closet.  One should turn to
one's host and say "I don't seem to have my hat.  Could you help me find it?".
DO NOT say "Don't anybody leave this room, some S.O.B.  has stolen my hat".

k.  In traveling in the U.S., particularly in a strange city, it is often
necessary to spend the night.  Hotels are provided for this purpose and almost
anyone can give directions to the hearest hotel.  Here, for a small sum, you
can register and be shown to a room where he can sleep for the night.  The
present practice of entering the nearest house, throwing the occupants into the
yard and taking over the premises will cease.

l.  Whiskey, a common American drink, may be offered to the soldier on social
occasions.  It is considered a reflection on the uniform to snatch the bottle
> from the hostess and drain the bottle, cork and all.  All individuals are
cautioned to exercise extreme control in these circumstances.

m.  In motion picture theaters seats are provided.  Helmets are not required.
In is NOT considered good form to whistle every time a female over 8 and under
80 crosses the screen.  If vision is impaired by the person in the seat in
front, there are plenty of other seats which can be occupied.  DO NOT hit him
across the back of the head and say "Move your head, jerk, I can't see a damn
thing".

n.  It is not proper to go around hitting everyone of draft age in civilian
clothes.  He might have been released from the service for medical reasons.
Ask for his credentials, and if he can't show any THEN go ahead and slug him.

o.  Upon retiring, one will often find a pair of pajamas laid out on the bed.
(Pajamas, it should be explained, are two-piece garments which are donned after
all clothing has been removed.) The soldier, confronted by these garments,
should assume an air of familiarity and not act as though he were not used to
them.  A casual remark such as "My, what a delicate shade of blue" will usually
suffice.  Under NO circumstances say "How in hell do you expect me to sleep in
a get-up like that?".

p.  Natural functions will continue.  It may frequently be necessary to
urinate.  DO NOT walk behind the nearest tree or automobile you find to
accomplish this.  Toilets (see 2d above) are provided in all public buildings
for this purpose.

q.  Beer is sometimes served in bottles.  A cap remover is usually available,
and it is not good form to open the bottle by the use of one's teeth.

r.  Always tip your hat before striking a lady.

s.  Air raids and enemy patrols are not encountered in America.  Therefore it
is not necessary to wear the helmet in church or at social gatherings, or to
hold the weapon at ready, loaded and cooked, when talking to civilians in the
street.

t.  Every American home and all hotels are equipped with bathing facilities.
When it is desired to take a bath, it is not considered good form to find the
nearest pool or stream, strip down, and indulge in a bath.  This is
particularly true in heavily populated areas.

u.  All individuals returning to the U.S.  will make every effort to conform to
the customs and habits of the regions visited, and to make themselves as
inconspicuous as possible.  Any actions which reflect upon the honor of the
uniform will be promptly dealt with.


For the Commanding General:

[ Recently in comp.misc, users started describing how they had put floppies
through their paces, and yet still found them readable.  Some folks decided
the discussion got out of hand, and I enjoyed this one. ]

That reminds me of the time , a few years ago when I left home with my 5"
master floppy in my pocket.  Suddenly a gust of wind blew it into the road
where it was run over by a passing millitary parade and it ended up in
a patch of quick-drying cement.

When I retrieved it the cement had set so I took it home to recover as I'd lost
the backup some days previously.  I chiselled off the cement from the disc but 
then my friend came along and suggested that, as the disc was 'dead', we should
see how much damage it could take.

We nailed it to the ceiling, and hung the cat from it, then used it at a dart-
board, incidentally did you know that if you're a good aim, a dart will exactly fit through the index hole?  By now the disc was a little bit grubby so we care-fully opened the black jacket, removed the disc and  washed it in boiling water,
making good use of the brillo pads.  After drying it with my blowtorch I tried
it in my disc drive.

Nothing happened for a few seconds and then a wisp of smoke slowly rose from theslot.  grabbing the disc and stamping out the flames I realised I had placed it in my toaster instead of a drive.  I found a 3" drive but unfortunately the discwouldn't fit so I had to cut off the edges until it did.  Tentatively I tried toboot and...

Imagine my surprise when it worked!  all my files were readable, except for the
ones stored in the bits I cut off to make it fit the drive.

This really happened.  I concluded that it only went to show.

Has this happened to anyone else?

[ Don't send me your own attempts.  There were many imitations in comp.misc ]
