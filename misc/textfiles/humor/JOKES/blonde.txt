     mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore.  So she announced,
     "I'm going to try to swim to shore."  So she swam out five miles,
     and got really tired.  She swam out ten miles from the island, and
     she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.

     she made it.  I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland
     than stay here and starve." So she attempts to swim out.  The
     redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam
     out 10 miles before she even  got tired.  After 15 miles, she was
     too tired to go on, so she drowned.

I'll get a life when it is proven          Troy C. Belding

experiencing.
