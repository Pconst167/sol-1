Son:    "Dad, I have to do a special report for school.  Can I 
        ask you a question?"
Father: "Sure son.  What's the question?"
Son:    "What is Politics?"
Father: "Well, let's take our home for an example.  I am the 
        wage earner, so let's call me Capitalism.  Your mother 
        is the administrator of money, so we'll call her 
        Government.  We take care of your need, so let's call 
        you The People.  We'll call the Maid The Working Class 
        and your brother we can call The Future.
        Do you understand son?"
Son:    "I'm not really sure, dad.  I'll have to think about it."

That night awakened by his brother's crying, the boy went to see 
what was wrong.  Discovering that the baby had seriously soiled 
his diaper, the boy went to his parents' room and found his 
mother sound asleep.  He went to the maid's room, where, peeking 
through the keyhole, he saw his father and the maid, so the boy
returned to his room and went back to sleep.

The next morning he reported to his father.

Son:    "Dad, now I think I understand what politics is."
Father: "Good son!  Can you explain it to me in your own words?"
Son:    "Well Dad, while Capitalism is screwing the Working 
        Class, Government is sound asleep, the People are being
        completely ignored and the Future is full of shit."
