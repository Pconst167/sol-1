History,
   What's papacy?

Medicine,
   Phuck that, take out your own appendix.

Public Speaking,
   I would calm them by offering vegimite.

Biology,
   Well, Parliment would probably be on top of a volcano or some shit.

Music,
   Done. (whew)

Psychology,
   That's deep man.

Sociology,
   For my experiment, I took your recipie for nitro and blew up 200 of
my kids.  Observations, I didn't notice any sociological problems or any
sociological activity for that matter.
  
Management Science,
   Maby some other time.

Engineering,
   I would leave the room and go home and let the tiger fix it if she
could.

Economics,
   The plan I have devised is the forceful takeover of Saudia Arabia as
well as many other oil producing countries.  Side effects on Cubism, the
Donatists controversy, and the wave theory of light;  None.  Criticisms;
From our point of view, none,  From theirs, we suck.  Deficiencies; None.

Political Science,
   I am unable to report because I was vaporized instantly after declaring
war.

Epistemology,
  I am against truth because with it everything would be valid. (self evident)

Physics,
   No way!

Philosophy,
   All that man first thought about was food, shelter, and smelly cave pussy.
As he evolved, he started to think of other things like tax shelters,
pirating software, and exotic sports cars, very significant developments.
No comparison.

General Knowledge,
   Available on request.

All done.

Well, did I pass?  Huh?
