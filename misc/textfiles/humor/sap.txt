                READING COMPREHENSION
     
Read the following carefully and answer the questions below.
    
  In addition to the obvious effects of solar activity on the upper atmosphere,
some scientists contend that it also afffects the weather.  These contentions,
however, are for the most part unconfirmed and some are very dubious.  Even
further afield, a British researcher on epidemiology claimed last year that
"the periods of world dominance of successive major subtypes of influenza A
virus have synchronized closely with the periodicity of sunspots."  Correlatons
of biomedical phenomenon with solar activity, such as this one, are generally
not taken seriously by most Western scintists.  Many researchers in the Soviet
Union, however, do believe in such possibilites, including even a correlation
of sunspots with outbreaks of plague-spreading rodents in central Asia.
