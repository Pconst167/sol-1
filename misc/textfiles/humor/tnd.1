I am afraid that I have to blame Alice Dunsmuir for this one.  She
was the occasional secretary and booking agent for Fat Moose.  One
passanger was very worried about getting on an airplane that had a
bomb on board.  The arguement that this was less than a one in a million
chance really was not working.  So Alice suggested that the passanger
carry a bomb on board, for the chance of getting on an airplane with
two bombs on board was so small as to be almost never.

MAN FLIES MATTRESS AS HOME EXPLODES

A flying mattress carries a 79 year old man to safety as his suburban home
was levelled by a natural gas explosion.  The incident occurred Thursday
morning as James Steurer was sitting on his bed putting on his shoes.
   Moments later he was still sitting on his mattress - outside on the
driveway, blown out of side wall of his home by the force of the explosion,
which also threw a side wall of the home against a next-door garage, and 
gave off a blast of heat that melted the siding on a neighboring house.

The Bank of England decided to replace the one pound banknote with a coin.
In an apparent attempt to make the new coin look like the traditional one
pound gold coin (refered to as a "sovereign"), it was to be thick, and was
to be made out of a nickel-copper alloy, which had a yellowish color.  When
the new "round pound" was issued, it quickly garnered the nickname "Maggie
Thatcher" because it was "round, thick, brassy, and acted like a sovereign."

"The most unusual French loo I know is at the Argentiere Hut, in the
Alps near Chamonix. It is a small cabin at the edge of a ledge, and
the pans open directly onto a drop of several hundred metres onto a
glacier. I noticed the climbers who went into it would pick up a few
pebbles or shards of granite, which struck me as a particularly severe
alternative to toilet paper, but it turned out they were for a
different purpose. The toilet was effectively pressurised by the wind
blasted up from below, so that when the job was done the uninitiated
would step through the door accompanied by a cloud of used tissues
and exclamations of horror."

[This sounds like the worst kind of air pollution imaginable.  
Presumably, the rocks were used as weights for ensuring that the used 
paper made it to the bottom. One expects that the glacier below would 
NOT be a popular spot... the next one's worse, though.]

"Unless the mujahideen have blown it up, the world's most threatening
bathroom plumbing is in a block of several storeys not far from the main
market in Kabul. It had several name changes, but for a while this 
nasty, bug-ridden hovel was called the Ambassador Private Hotel.

"The Ambassador had the most basic of loos, a hole in the floor. It
became infamous among overland adventure tour operators before the
Soviet invasion as more than one troubled guest settled down to the
urgent task only to have their attention drawn to a sound from above.
In their tentative incursion into highrise accomodation, the builders
had put each bathroom above one another!"

     When the F.B.I. puts people undercover, it wants them to behave like
the locals.  Traders in Chicago are fond of (illegal) sports betting pools.
The undercover agents, of course, participated in this (illegal) activity.
     The U.S. Attorney made his first set of indictments on the Friday
before the Super Bowl.  At this point, the agents' cover is blown.
As expected, all the agents participated in the Super Bowl pool.
What wasn't expected is that one of the agents would have placed the
winning bet.  The pool contained $4000.  Furthermore, decorum requires
that the winner personally collect his money.  Needless to say, the pot

Dear Sir/Madam

The declining moral situation around us is a portent threatening mankind,
and is causing much consternation to every thinking soul, especially to the
intellectuals among us. Responsible citizens throughout the world often
wonder whether they should remain dumb witnesses to this moral landslide.

As a scholar and humanitarian you must have assessed this situation and your
keen eyes must have travelled far and deep to view the moral decline of
today and the situation resulting from it. You must have also thought about
an answer.

Would you be so very kind as to express your views on the moral decline and
its causes and also to please put down on a piece of paper the ways you
propose to deal with the situation?

I am addressing this letter to nearly ten thousand of scholars and thinkers
and it is my wish to collect and preserve their views and, if necessary, to
give these views the form of a book and arrange for the distribution of such
a book.

The two very important questions are:

	1. What is your opinion about the moral bankruptcy which is so
	   rampant today, what are in your views its causes and how do you
	   propose to remedy them?

	2. Would you bracket together the dangers to the peace and moral
	   lapses and how do you suggest to rehabilitate the peace and order?

Kindly write your lofty ideas in a minimum number of words, say 500, on your
letter-head or on plain paper and send it to me with your address. This will
be a valuable piece of writing which shall be preserved in the Hamdard
Library. I am sure you will grant acceptance to my request and give me the
honour to be the trustee of your note.

I present my high compliments.

	This appeared in today's (2/17) Seattle Post-Intelligencer:

	It was a flush with a rush.
	Toilets and urinals in the King County Courthouse 
exploded yesterday after a worker in Metro's downtown bus
tunnel mistakenly connected an air compressor to the building's
water line.
	As soon as hapless individuals flushed the pressurized
privies, the plumbing started popping in restrooms throughout
the 72-year-old building, said building services manager Bill
Kemp.
	"They started blowing at about 11:30 (a.m.) and it took
us awhile to figure it out," he recounted."We knew it had to be
air in the system but the Water Department said that was imposs-
ible."
	It wasn't.  The source of the problem was finally tracked
to the tunnel under Third Avenue, and the errant air compressor 
was shut down.
	But not before employees on every floor in the 10-story
courthouse had stories to tell about gushing geysers in the john.
	"WE think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets," said Kemp.
"The porcelain is actually cracked."
	"Kemp said no one has admitted being hurt by the unusual
blast, although several people were badly drenched.  Or very
surprized.  
	Explained Kemp, "The urinals acted more like bidets."
We had other reports that people were not necessairily on the toilet
but close."...
	"This has not exactly been a good day for Metro," he noted.

This is a True Story. It actually happened recently to three friends of mine.
Reproduced with permission, and with apologies to Lovecraft.

Mark, Cathy and Harry share an apartment with a family of several thousand
cockroaches. Australian cockroaches are, of course, far larger, hungrier,
and more aggressive than their counterparts in other countries. One day, 
becoming annoyed at the constant patter of tiny tentacles, the suspicious 
crunching sounds that should never come from a cheese sandwich, and especially
peeved at finding the furniture rearranged without notice, Mark decided to
commit genocide. He bought a can of surface spray.

A distorted leer on his face, he methodically covered the skirting
boards, cupboards, cracks, nooks and lairs of his enemy with the fast-acting
contact poison. He was merciless, rooting out forgotten nests and spraying
crucial strategic points with the fine but deadly mist. When the can
finally ran out, he knew that morning would see a newer, cleaner, better
world for humans to live in. Smug and confident in his powers, he settled
down for a well-earned rest.

Night fell. A clear, silent moonlit night. Quiet. Perhaps, too quiet. For
the first time in memory, no scampering of greasy exoskeleton, no clacking
of mandibles, no buzz of shadowy wings to disturb the great white mammals,
dormant and safe in their nocturnal hibernation. All around the hunting
fields, tantalising with the promise of cheese sandwiches, a heavy pall
hung. Not an inch, not a smidgeon, not a scad of floor space could be
found that was not covered with the insidious but certain death. Not even
a place to stand, except ...

Harry woke with it. He thought it was the rain. But the night
was clear. The moon shone through his bedroom window. Then he felt it.
Then he started to scream.

Mark and Cathy ran to Harry's room, armed with large blunt objects. The
door was locked. Inside, they could hear whimpering, a tiny voice
crying "No no no no ...", and the sound of rain. Mark hammered on the 
door. Cathy went to ring the police. The door thudded once, and then
the bolt drew back, the lock turned, the door slowly opened, the light
snapped on. Mark and Cathy drew breath as one, turned and fled, 
screaming, into the night, followed after a period by the shambling
wreck that had been Harry. His bed was littered with hundreds of twisted
black cockroach corpses, fallen from a teaming leathery mass that 
entirely covered the ceiling. And they made a sound like rain ...

gem of wisdom.  (GPWS is the ground proximity warning system.  It tells the
crew when the ground is getting too close for what they're doing.)

     "Note: the GPWS will not provide a warning if an airplane is flying
     directly towards a vertical cliff."

Gee, thanks.  I'll keep that in mind. :-}
