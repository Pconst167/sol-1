Corporation: An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit
	without individual responsibility.

Day:  A period of twenty-four hours, mostly misspent.  This period

	conduct and views that madden to crime.  The genus has wide
	geographical distribution, being found wherever sought and 
	deplored wherever found.  The maiden is not altogether 
	unpleasing to the eye, nor (without her piano and her views)
	insupportable to the ear, though in respect to comeliness
	distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard to 
	the part of her that is audible, beaten out of the field by
	the canary  -- which, also, is more portable.

Male:  A member of the unconsidered, or negligible, sex.  The male

Mercy:  An attribute beloved of detected offenders.

Mine:  Belonging to me if I can hold or seize it.

	four aces and a king.

Misfortune:  The kind of fortune that never misses.

Monday:  In Christian countries, the day after the ball game.

Mouth:  In man, the gateway to the soul;  In woman, the outlet of
	the heart.

Noise:  A stench in the ear.  Undomesticated music.  The chief
	product and authenticating sign of civilization.

Occident:  The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient.
	It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful sub-tribe
	of the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder 
	and cheating, which they are pleased to call "war" and 
	"commerce".  These, also, are the principal industries of 
	the Orient.

	ownership with the candid concomitance of a brass band.  
	To wrest the wealth of A from B and leave C lamenting a 
	missed opportunity.

Pocket:  The cradle of motive and the grave of conscience.  In woman,
	this organ is lacking; so she acts without motive, and her 
	conscience, denied burial, remains ever alive, confessing
	the sins of others.

Politics:  A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of
	principles.  The conduct of public affairs for private 	
	advantage.

Pray:  To ask that the laws of the universe be nullified on
	behalf of a  single petitioner, admittedly unworthy.

Politeness: The most acceptable hypocrisy.

	unliklihood.  The testimony of two credible witnesses as
	opposed to that of only one.

	have their own way and their own way of having it.  In the

	it with a tempest of words.

	of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck, or one's neighbor.  In the days 
	of astrology, it was customary to unload it upon a star.

	of Law.

Riot: A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent

Vote: The instrument and symbol of a freeman's power to make
	a fool of himself and a wreck of his country.

Weaknesses: Certain primal powers of Tyrant Woman wherewith
	she holds dominion over the male of the species, 
	binding him to the service of her will, and paralyzing 
	his rebellious energies.
	
Witch: (1) An ugly and repulsive old woman, in a wicked
	league with the devil.  (2) A beautiful and attractive 
	young woman, in wickedness a league beyond the devil.

	the most illuminating words in our language-- a word
	that defines the matrimonial situation with precision,
	point, and poignancy.

	inexperienced. A passion that goeth before a sprawl.
