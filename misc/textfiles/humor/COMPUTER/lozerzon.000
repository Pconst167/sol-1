  HE WAS KNOWN MOST POPULARLY AS BLACK BUCCANEER, FAMOUS PHREAKER, HACKER,
PIRATE, AND ALL-AROUND DUDE.  BY HIS PERSONAL FRIENDS HE WAS KNOWN AS RICK, NOT
THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYER, NOT A LETTERMAN IN HOCKEY, JUST A REALLY AWESOME
DUDE...  WHO WAS UP FOR ABOUT $200000 IN FINES TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT...  BUT
HE COULDN'T GET CAUGHT...  HE WAS TOO SMART FOR THAT, AND FOR THAT REASON HE WAS 
WELL RESPECTED ON EVERY BBS IN THE MIDWEST.  THEN ONE DAY, HE CALLS THE PIRATE'S 
PLACE II, A WELL-KNOWN HACK/PHREAK BBS WHICH IN THE PAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELL
KNOWN FOR ITS SREENING OUT OF LOSERS...  BUT NO SYSOP CAN STAY HOME ALL THE TIME 
AND NO SYSTEM CAN BE PERFECT...  AS MANY WERE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.  FOR AS BLACK
BUCCANEER DIALED THE LAST DIGIT OF THE PHONE NUMBER ON HIS COPY OF MEGATERM 4.0, 
HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HE HAD JUST GAINED ELITE ACCESS TO..  THE LOSER ZONE
