                     Communications Breakthrough
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because you can't see the person who is sending you electronic mail you
are sometimes uncertain whether they are serious or joking.  Recently,
Scott Fahlman at CMU devised a scheme for annotating one's messages to
overcome this problem.  If you turn your head sideways to look at the
three characters :-) they look sort of like a smiling face.  Thus, if
someone sends you a message that says "Have you stopped beating your
wife? :-) " you know they are joking.  If they say "I need to talk to
you :-( ", be prepared for trouble.

Since Scott's original proposal, many further symbols have been proposed:

 :-)     humor.
 :->     humor variation.
 %-}     humor variation.
 :-(     sad.
 :-<     sad variation.
 %-{     sad variation.
 :_)     tongue in cheek
 :-!     foot in mouth
 <:-)    for dumb questions.

 d :-o   hats off to your great idea
 q:-)    for those who wear their caps backwards.
