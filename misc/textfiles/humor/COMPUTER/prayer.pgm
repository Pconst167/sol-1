BEGIN
{Main program: Calls procedures for Divine Saving Algorithm}

REPEAT

  Our OS, who art in CPU, UNIX be thy name.
    Thy programs run, Thy syscalls done,
      In kernal as they are in user.

  Give us this time-slice our processor allocation,
    And forgive us our hacking,
      As we forgive those who hack against us.

  Lead us not into /dev,
    And deliver us from viruses:
      For thyne is the /root, the I*SQR(R),
       and the up-time.
