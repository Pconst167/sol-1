Hi!


As I promised a while ago, I am sending you (the ASCII version of) The
Great Net Prayerbook, version 3. I have edited the prayers to make them
somewhat more legible (for example: SOME OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY
CAPITALISED, while some of the other prayers contained some lines that did not fit on
an 80-line screen, while others contianed much speeling missteaks).

Anyway, with this introduction you will find 12 other files, with the
following subjects and approximate length:

Net Prayerbook: List of prayers	 4149
Net Prayerbook: Index		 1889
Net Prayerbook: Index-macro	  275
Net Prayerbook: Attributions	 2228
Net Prayerbook: Level 1		21715	23 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 2		19734	24 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 3		15446	16 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 4		18017	19 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 5		15427	17 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 6		 5479	 5 spells
Net Prayerbook: Level 7		10549	 7 spells
Net Prayerbook: Conclusion	  662

These files contain the names of the prayers, the names of the people
who posted them, an index to the prayers, a macro to print that index
using troff, and the prayers themselves, respectively.

You are free to redistribute them, and copy them for your own use, as
long as you do not prevent others to do the same. You may not sell them
for profit. If you distribute them, make sure that you distribute the
entire package as you have received it yourself, especially the list
of contributors, unchanged.

One small note about the files containing the prayers: after you've
removed the headers and the .signature, you can just "cat" them into
one large file: all of them end with a ^L (page break).

I will eventually (re)post these prayers, whenever I think I have
accumulated enough new ones. I will mark these updates as being another
version.

Well, enough rambling for now, get them and enjoy!

When I started out, I was going to put each author's name next to each
prayer. Then I started getting two and three copies of the same prayer,
and decided to just put their names here, so if you have a question,
get in touch with one of these people, not with me.

Note that some of the prayers contained in the Great Net Prayerbook have
been copyrighted by the author. Permission has been granted by these
authors to copy and freely distribute copies of their work, so long as
no commercial or barter considerations are obtained in exchange for
such copies. All prayers are for personal use only. If you distribute
these prayers, you must also distribute these copyright conditions and
the names of the authors and editors.

After receiving these prayers, I have gone through all of them, edited
them to make the format uniform, and to make them more legible. Note
that I did not change the wordings in any way, except in some obvious
cases of spelling errors. Furthermore, when no level was indicated, I
(or cscon113@uoft02.utoledo.edu) just guessed what level it was to be
in. Also, in those cases where no school, range, area of effect, or the
like was supplied, I made one up.

Game Masters should be sure to check these prayers, and make sure they
are right for the way you run your campaign. Some are awfully powerful
but some could use a little more kick, that is for you to decide.

                            June 21st 1991.





========================================================================

First Level Spells

========================================================================

Animal/Bird Call (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 12" + 1" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the cleric to call all animals or birds within the
spell effect.  The animals or birds will converge upon the cleric
within 1d3 rounds.  While the spell is in effect, none of the animals
or birds will attack each other.  While there, the cleric may set one
small task for the group to perform.  When the spell ends, the animals
or birds will peacefully disperse to whence they came.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal Enmity (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell simply causes the victim to be offensive to animals for the
period of one day. Horses will shy or buck, dogs will bark, bulls will
charge, birds will aim at them, etc. Note that animals with a close
association to the victim won't do anything to hurt the victim, they'll
just treat him like you would treat a friend who, for some reason,
smelled horrible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal Tracks (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the cleric to leave tracks & scents as as the animal
specified during casting.  The tracks have traces of magic for 3 turns,
after which they are indistinguishable from normal tracks.  Only
non-mythical creatures can be impersonated.  A holly berry and some fur
from the animal to be impersonated is needed to cast this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coalstone (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 turns
Area of Effect: One gem
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric enchants a gem, turning it into a
coalstone.  The coalstone glows and gives of heat.  It is hot enough to
start a fire, ignite flammable substances and sheds light in a 5'
radius.  Holding the coalstone will inflict 1 hit point of damage per
round unless the wielder possesses some form of protection.  The
coalstone will burn for 1 day per GP value of the gem used for a
maximum of 1 year per level of the caster, after which the coalstone
crumbles into a fine powder.  Another function of the coalstone is that
the caster may opt to cause it to explode.  This will cause 1 point of
concussion damage for every 100 days left on the duration (save for +)
and ignite any flammables within a 5' radius.  The material component
for the spell is the gem to be enchanted and a sprig of holly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comprehend Languages (Alteration) Reversible

Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature or object touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level magic-user spell Comprehend
Languages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conjured Weapon (Conjuration)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One weapon
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it brings into existence a weapon of the
caster's choice which he can use to fight with. The weapon is a normal
weapon with the holy symbol of the god engraved upon it. The weapon has
a dim glow upon it which can be faintly seen. The caster, if he is to
use the weapon, must be proficient in its use. The weapon can be given
to another character to use.

If a striking spell is used in conjugation with the conjured weapon
spell, then there will be an additional +1 to hit and to damage rolls
because of the cumulative effects of the magic of the spells. The
conjured weapon then counts as a +2 weapon for purposes of special
defense.

The weapon stays into existence until the end of the spell or until the
caster wishes the spell to end.

The verbal component would sound something like, "Oh Great Warrior Kos,
give me a broadsword to smite down my foes!", then the gestures made
are those to signify the casters intent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Earth (Alteration) Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning
Range: 1"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster creates up to 3 pounds per level of stone or
1 cubic foot per level of sand, dirt, or dust. The stone can be solid
or lose gravel. The reverse, Destroy Earth, will destroy a like amount
of earth or stone. Magical creatures are allowed a save vs. magic or
take 1 point damage per level of the caster.

The material component is the cleric's holy symbol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daryana's Holy Shit (Conjuration)

Sphere: Creation
Range: 10'
Components: V
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 3-inch radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell was granted to Daryana, third level priestess of the goddess
of magic, after she had repeatedly, loudly, requested it.

Upon uttering the verbal component - already mentioned in the spell's
name - two things can happen. If cast consciously, the spell can be
targeted and takes effect immediately. In this case, some faeces appear
anywhere within the range of the spell.

If this spell was memorised, and cast unconsciously, the spell's effect
is delayed for up to 1 hour while the place of impact is anywhere
within 10' around the unfortunate caster, both at the DM's discretion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Enemy (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the cleric may determine whether there are
creatures within the area of effect that bear hostile intent toward
him.  The spell will reveal the direction of the creatures, even if
they are invisible, ethereal, astral, or out of phase.  Note that this
spell does not reveal anything about the alignment or motives of the
creatures in concern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dieme's Forcing Hand (Alteration)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

By this spell, the caster throws a stone hand at the target. The stone
hand will then make a crackling noise and show blue lightning as it
flies towards its target. When it hits, it will do 2 points per level
of impact damage. Upon casting this spell, the caster throws the hand
and says "to arms". This spell (like "magic missile") always hits.

The material component is a carved (or created) stone hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dispel Fatigue (Abjuration)

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell removes fatigue from the affected creature and protects it
from tiring further for the spell duration.  However, once the spell
expires, the recipient must rest for the amount of time spent in
strenuous activity (i.e., running, melee combat) while under the
spell.  No damage sustained is restored, including broken or sprained
limbs, i.e., you still can't run on a sprained ankle.  The spell is
also ineffective against magically or psionically caused fatigue (such
as Ray of Enfeeblement), or against subdual damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Faithfulness (Abjuration)

Sphere: Guardian, Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell acts as a Phylactery of Faithfulness in that it will alert
the cleric to any action or item which will adversely affect his
alignment and standing with his deity, if a prior moment is taken to
contemplate the action. Furthermore, if the cleric is forced by some
form of possession or domination to act contrary to alignment, the
spell bestows a 10% chance per level of breaking free of the mind
control, as well as a saving throw to not carry out the offending act.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flame Tongue (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One or more persons listening
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell grants the caster the ability of fast talking: during the
spell's duration, the caster is able to talk and talk and talk, thus
gaining the undivided attention of those listening, provided they can
understand the caster. Note that all hearing the caster will be
affected by this fast talking: party members are affected too.

The second use of this spell is to increase the morale of hirelings,
followers and henchmen: prior to a fight, the priest can encourage them
by talking vividly for one round, thus increasing their morale by two
points plus one for every two levels above first, up to a maximum of 5.
Thus, a fifth or sixth level priest will increase the morale by 4
points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gnat Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: Sight
Components: S, M
Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The cleric can summon a swarm of gnats to bother and harass the victim
for the duration of the spell.

For example: a man is stalking Bob-the-wonder-druid through the
forest.  The fellow gets closer than Bob would like, and, unless he
acts fast, is liable to get spotted (a situation he'd like to avoid.)
The man has a 30% chance to spot Bob normally, but with the swarming
gnats, his attention is elsewhere, so his chances are cut to 15%.
The material component for this spell is a dead gnat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grow (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One plant
Saving Throw: None

The cleric can cause a single plant to show a week's worth of growth in
one day. This spell can be cast at most once per day per plant. The
material component for this spell is some furtiliser or humus, and some
water, to be given to the plant (the components are not consumed by the
spell, but they are by the plant). If the cleric wishes to continually
cast this spell, then he should be prepared to furnish additional
fertiliser and water to sustain the plant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guardian Watch (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a small quasi-earth-elemental (1d4 HP) to stand
watch. If some creature moves across or under the ground into the area
of effect that weighs more than 1 pound, the elemental will cause the
ground to shiver and wake people up (detection of creatures is by
movement and vibrations across the ground). The elemental can also form
a hand and try to trip intruders (the guardian is semi-intelligent and
can remember simple commands from the caster, i.e. like who the party
members are). The guardian is hard to detect and will almost always
trip from surprise. Opponents get a save vs. magic to avoid tripping -
a save means they just felt something trying to grab their leg.

The material components of this spell are the cleric's holy symbol and
a live worm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Itch (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Causes the victim to have an irresistible urge to scratch, if he, she
or it fails its saving throw. This can be cast on any sort of animal
that might have to scratch, and dogs save at -4.  This spell works with
embarrassing effectiveness on armoured folks.  The actual location of
the itch is semi-random (i.e. GM rolls a dice, pretends it matters,
then does whatever (s)he likes). Most of the time, though, it's on the
back, the foot, or, on the odd occasion, less appropriate places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Step (Alteration)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows one creature to be able to run at full speed without
getting tired over stone, dirt, or grass.  At the end of the duration,
the creature must stop for 1 turn for each hour it was running.  During
this time it can do nothing except drink liquids and small, light
portions of food. At the end of this resting period, the creature will
start to regain enough energy to be able to carry on normal activities
(i.e. eat, walk, etc.).  When the creature has stopped for a time equal
to the time it ran, it will be able to carry on all activities without
penalty (i.e. fight, run, etc.).  This spell will work on horses, pack
animals, etc.

The material component for this spell is a small piece of leather.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request Animal (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One animal
Saving Throw: Special

By casting this spell, a cleric can ask a particular animal for a
favour.  The caster must have some sort of enticement for the animal to
actually perform the favour, because the animal can opt not to carry
out the cleric's wishes. The casting time of this spell is 1 plus the
time necessary to make the request, which may take no longer than one
turn. This spell does not empower the priest to actually speak the
animal's language.

For example: If a cleric spotted an owl, the cleric could request the
owl to, if it saw any other humanoids around, fly back and alert the
cleric.  An appropriate offering might be some choice part of a rabbit,
a mouse, or some other form of owl snack food. If the owl was actually
required to fly patrol all night (and forego hunting, a favourite owl
activity) then probably the owl would turn him down no matter what the
cleric offered.

Rock-Jump (Conjuration)

Sphere: Creation
Range: 100 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the cleric can cause a rock to find its way into the
shoe of the victim. If the victim has no shoes, the spell causes a
thorn or something to stick into the foot of the victim. The material
component for this spell is a small stone of thorn, that is to be
thrown in the direction of the victim. It is consumed in the victim's
shoe or foot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seedling (Alteration) Reversible

Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes one tree seed or seedling per level of the caster to
be specially blessed by the caster's god. When the spell is cast upon a
seed or seedling and planted in the ground, it will immediately start
to grow at an astonishing rate. It will grow to a total height of 2'+ 1
foot per level of the caster in the period of one turn. A tree thus
"blessed" by this spell will grow to be a large, healthy tree, highly
resistant to both parasites and disease, and will have a much longer
lifespan than the ordinary trees of its type.

The reverse of this spell, tree shrink, causes one tree to be reduced
in height by the above amount. If this is cast upon a "monster" tree
then it gets a save vs. spells. If the tree saves, there is no effect.
If the tree fails, then the tree is reduced in HD by the level of the
caster.

The spell can be cast in two ways. The first way takes 1 round per seed
or seedling to cast and be planted. The other way takes 9 segments per
seed or seedling to cast. The spell is then finished at a later time by
completing the final gestures (1 segment per seed or seedling) and then
planting the seeds or seedlings. There is no limit to the time in
between the original casting and completion in this variation. Anybody
can complete the final gestures needed to complete this spell.

The seeds or seedlings are most commonly used for gifts or
reforestation projects as needed. The trees around a cleric grove tend
to be of this type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sense Direction (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By use of this spell, the cleric is able to divine exactly what
direction his home grove is in relation to his current position.  Only
direction is known, not distance.  The component for this spell is a
oak leaf (from the home grove) suspended by a spider silk thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sharpleaf (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 2"
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 3 leaves per 4 levels
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the cleric causes oak leaves to become rigid and
extremely sharp.  These Sharpleaves can now be wielded or thrown as
daggers.  If the leaves are crumbled before the spell is cast, then the
resulting pieces are similar to caltrops, doing 1d2 points each.  One
leaf can cover 5' square, with 1d4 hitting the first creature to
enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Striking (Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One weapon per 4 levels
Saving Throw: None

The use of this spell calls down upon a specially consecrated weapon of
a believer, the benediction of his deity.  This spell only works for
those of the same faith as the caster and the weapons used must have
been previously dedicated to that deity through a Ceremony spell.  Once
these conditions have been met, the spell endows the weapon with a
glowing, magical aura that inflict an additional 1d6 points of damage
per blow struck.  This additional damage will affect creatures that are
struck only by magic weapons of +2 or less (while the weapon itself may
do no damage to these creatures).  Note: this spell will not affect
weapons which are +2 or better.  The material components are the
cleric's (un)holy symbol and the consecrated weapon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracker (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 1' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 hours per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to place an enchantment on an object. The
caster will then know, for the duration, the direction and relative
distance to the object. The object can be up to a mile away before the
spell fades away. The spell will last until the spell duration expires
or it is dispelled. If the object is on a unknowing recipient at the
time of casting, then (and only then) does the carrier get a save.

The material component is the object to be tracked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trance (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: S
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 yards radius area
Saving Throw: None

The cleric goes into a meditative trance, and, after being in this
trance for one round, can feel the presence of the spirits in the area
-- including the spirits of the animals in the area.

For example: If, say, a troll happened to be within 100 yards of the
caster, the caster would certainly know that something large and fell
is in the area, but, unless the caster had come into contact with the
spirit of a troll before, wouldn't know what it was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trip (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 100 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One 10-foot per level long square
Saving Throw: None

Actually, this is a low-budget Entangle spell. However, the
effectiveness of this spell depends upon the amount of underbrush in
the area of effect.  In a bramble of thorn-bushes, it is as effective
as an entangle spell.  On a putting green, it has no effect at all.

Bat Sense (Divination, Alteration)

Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it enables the recipient to be able to sense
objects, creatures, etc. around him as a bat would (i.e. by the
reflection of sound waves). To use this ability, the recipient must
spend one round "switching" his sensory input. While using this
capability, he must keep his eyes closed. This spell will reduce a
thief's move silently percentages by 50%. Also invisible creatures
may be "seen" using this spell.

The recipient can "see" things up to 60' away from him.

When using this ability, if the recipient is within the effect of a
shout spell, horn of blasting, or similar phenomenon, then he must make
a save versus death or be stunned for 1d6 rounds and have a 40% chance
of becoming deaf (eardrum ruptures).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command II (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 3" + 1" per level (and within hearing range)
Components: V
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an improved version of the Command spell (see the first
level priest spell Command). The differences are: the range (as noted
above), the duration (as noted above), and that only those creatures
with a 15 and above intelligence or 6 HD get a save.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cure Moderate Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent form of Cure Light Wounds. When the caster
lays his hands upon the creature to be touched the spell cures 3-17
(2d8+1) HP of damage.

The reverse of this spell, cause moderate wounds, does the above amount
of damage if the caster succeeds in touching the victim.

Otherwise this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Invisibility 15' Radius (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is the same as the second level
magic-user spell, Detect Invisibility. Note the spell allows only the
cleric to see invisible creatures, and only those within the specified
radius. The material component of this spell is a pinch of any fine
powder such as talc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Phase (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the person touched can see and perceive any
creature that is out of or in a different phase than that of the spell
recipient. This means that the person touched will see clearly such
creatures with special defenses such as displacement, blinking,
duo-dimension, astral, or etherealness and those who can shift out of
phase, such as a phase spider. Furthermore, if the person touched has
means to attack such creatures, he will have none of the ill effects
that normally occur when trying to attack (i.e. the person touched
would know the exact location of a displacer beast, or where the phase
spider is etc.). The information cannot be communicated to his fellows
by words.

The material component of this spell requires, in addition to the
caster's holy symbol, a lens of calcite crystal which must be viewed
through for the spell to have effect. It does not disappear at the end
of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Style (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One or more creatures
Saving Throw: Special

This spell has two uses: if cast on more than one creature, this spell
will make the one, highest in rank, known to the caster. If all
creatures, which must be in sight, are of equal rank, or there is a tie
for the highest rank, no one will be detected. Note that the highest in
rank need not be the most powerful of the scanned creatures. In this
case, there is no applicable saving throw.

The second use of this spell is to determine the exact rank of a
specific creature: if the spell is cast on one creature only, the
caster will know the rank of the targeted creature. If the caster is
unfamiliar with the hierarchical structure of the victim's society or
organisation, he will only feel a general indication: something like
"no rank", "officer" or "very high rank" would be appropriate
descriptions. Note that nothing is revealed about the victim's level of
experience e.a. The target gets a saving throw, that will negate the
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dieme's Forceful Hand (Alteration)

Range: 4" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is like the first level spell except the fist is a lot
larger (about 6' high) and more forceful. The base damage is 2d6 +1 per
level for small or medium, and 3d6 + 1 per level for large creatures.
The creature saves for 1/2 damage, and those that fail are affected as
follows:

Large:	Creature falls down.
Medium:	Creature pushed back 4+1d4 feet, Dex check to stay on feet.
Small:	Creature thrown back the number of feet equal to the damage
	they took. They also take another 1d6 points of damage when
	they land.

This spell does not insure a safe landing, and if the creature is in a
position where a fall would do extra damage, like mounted on a horse
for example, extra damage may occur.

The material component is a carved (or created) stone hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Efembe's Spitting Image (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Protection (reversed)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 week per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Upon casting this spell, the caster spits on his fingertips and smears
some spittle on the target's forehead. This bestows a curse on the
victim: every time he looks into a mirror or another reflecting surface
during the spell's duration, his mirror image will spit into his face.
Note that a Remove Curse will dispel this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flame/Frost Blade (Invocation)

Sphere: Combat, Creation
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3' long, sword-like blade
Saving Throw: None

When a cleric casts this spell, he causes a blazing ray or red-hot fire
or a freezing icicle to spring forth from his hand. This blade is
actually wielded as if it were a scimitar (but it is not a scimitar),
and is the cleric scores a successful hit while employing the blade,
the creature struck will take 2d6 points of damage - with a damage
bonus of +2 if the creature is especially vulnerable to that attack
form (i.e.  fire vs. undead, ice para-elementals and frost vs. red
dragons or fire elementals). The flame blade will ignite combustible
materials. The blade will not affect creature that can be hit by magic
weapons except with respect to undead monsters. In addition to
mistletoe, the cleric must have a leaf of sumac in order to cast this
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heliot's Healing Sleep (Necromancy)

Sphere: Healing
Components: V, S, M
Range: 0
Duration: 4 hours + 2 hours per level
Area of Effect: One person
Casting Time: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the healing benefits of sleep to be threefold (i.e.
3 HP per day rested). Additionally this spell causes any and all
curative spells cast during its duration to have maximum effect plus 1
HP. The individual to be effected must be able to sleep, and must be
asleep during the spells effect. The casting time of this spell is 6
turns minus the caster's level, with a minimum of one turn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inaudibility (Alteration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the cleric's movements to become completely silent
for the duration of the spell. All sounds made by his equipment from
the neck down are muted into inaudibility. Intentional shouting or
spell casting can be heard, and will negate the inaudibility for the
duration of said noise. Attacking completely negates the spell effect
(Cf. Invisibility). The material component is a piece of sea sponge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nausea (Enchantment/Charm, Abjuration) Reversible

Sphere: Charm, Healing, Protection
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes the recipient to fall to its knees and choke, gag and
vomit for 1 round per level of the caster. No actions are allowed other
than crawling. The material component for this spell is a bucket.

The reverse of this spell removes nausea or protects a character from
such things as Stinking Clouds and seasickness for 1 turn per level of
the caster. The material component for the reverse is some food.

The reverse of this spell belongs to the Abjuration school, while
Nausea itself belongs to the Enchantment/Charm school.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planar Vision (Divination)

Sphere: Astral, Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Sight
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the priest can perceive creatures in the Border
Ethereal, out of phase beings (i.e. phase spiders), Dimension Doors,
creatures viewing his location through Colour Pools, and boundaries of
plane-travel-proof areas; he can also identify portals to other planes
(but he cannot say what plane is on the other side).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Charm, 10' Radius (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in operation, all creatures in the area of effect
have a percentage immunity to all forms of charm (spell, item, or
whatever) equal to 20% plus 5% per level of the cleric. Thus, if cast
by a 5th level cleric, any creature in the area of effect targeted by a
charm spell would not need to make a saving throw if 45% or lower was
rolled on percentile dice. The material component is a miniature cloth
blindfold.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Eye Contact (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell gives +4 on all saving throws versus gaze weapons for each
creature touched. Note: this does not apply to beings whose gaze
weapons do not require the victim to meet the attacker's gaze. The
material component is a small disc of translucent material such as mica
or smoked glass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, hold spells and
dragon induced fear paralysis.

This spell does not remove paralysis already in effect, it just
prevents the recipient from being paralysed in the future.

The material component of this spell is a feather, and an infusion of
tea and ginger which is consumed by the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specialisation (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster's weapon
Saving Throw: None

When the specialisation spell is cast, a small part of their god's
power is invested into themselves. This power allows the caster to
fight better in combat. The benefit the caster receives is
specialisation in the god's preferred weapon, if the god has one.
Otherwise the benefits apply to a weapon of the caster's choice. This
specialisation occurs whether or not the caster is proficient with the
weapon. There are no minuses to hit because of non- weapon proficiency
penalties. (Note: Clerics will tend to be proficient with their god's
preferred weapon.)

This spell is typical of spell given to clerics of warrior gods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stone Message (Invocation)

Sphere: Divination
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 minute
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The caster casts this spell directly into the prism on his holy symbol
(this spell was created for a diety whose symbol is a hand grasping a
prism). The caster then names (not by truename) the person he wants to
talk to. If this target person is within 1" of a holy symbol to the
same diety (thus that holy symbol also has a prism in it), then the
target person will notice that the prism flashes. Only the target
person will notice the flashes of light. When the target person touches
the holy symbol, the prism will show the face of the caster, and the
caster's prism will show the face of the target person. The caster can
then talk into his prism and hold a short conversation with the target
person.

If the target person is not within 1" of a specified holy symbol, the
caster will feel like the spell was a dud. The spell will wait one
minute for the person answer. If the person did not answer, the caster
will know that the person did not answer.

Idle chatter is not being appreciated by the diety (noise pollution on
his holy waves). Quick conversations are appreciated. There is also a
5% chance that someone or something associated with the diety (one of
his clerics or minions) will notice and remember the conversation.
This does not mean the cleric or minion will do anything, just that
others may be listening in.

The material components for this spell are the two needed holy symbols,
and are obviously not consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stop (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One 1" per level long, 2" per level wide at base cone
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is intended for those times an army is racing toward you in
a charge. Each creature in the cone will have to save vs. spell or
come to a sudden full stop as if it ran into a solid wall (no damage
is caused, they just stop). For the rest of the duration, those that
did not save can not move towards caster. Those that did make their
save can move towards the caster only at half rate.

To cast this spell, the cleric puts his open hand forward and yells
stop (like a traffic cop).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 3" + 1" per level above fifth
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per level above third
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius sphere
Savings Throw: None

This spell is similar to Insect Plague, but the insects summoned are of
a specific type (with specific effects) depending on the cleric's
deity, for example:

Deity		Insect	Effect
---------	-------	---------------------------------------------
Beelzebub	Flies	15% + 2% per level chance of causing disease
Seth		Locusts	2 HP per round to creatures caught in swarm +
			infestation of food.

For other effects, see the fifth level cleric spell Insect Plague.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the casting cleric is temporarily endowed with
tracking ability similar to that of a ranger. However the tracking
spell is better. Using this spell, the cleric becomes not only aware of
all physical traces, but psychic traces too. Thus a creature who has
travelled using pass without trace. This makes almost anything
trackable, even aerial creatures (those who leave strong enough psychic
impressions at least). There are some restrictions though. The cleric
must have an item that belonged to the creature being tracked.
Furthermore tracking with this spell must begin at a point that the
creature has been within the past half hour. The other component for
the spell is mistletoe of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unentangle (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One person per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Special

An unentangle spell is used to allow creatures to pass through an
entangle spell cast by the same caster. If the spell is used to pass
another caster's entangle spell then the effects are as follows: normal
movement if a save vs. spells is made or 1/2 normal movement if the
saving throw fails.

This spell also allows normal movement through the densest of forests,
briar thickets, wall of thorns, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weakness (Abjuration, Alteration)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This is a defensive spell which causes the target creature to lose (0-3
+ 1 per level of the caster) points of strength. The creatures strength
cannot be lowered past 3 due to the effects of the spell. If the
creature has exceptional strength, then the loss of strength is on a
10% per point ratio. A strength of 18/01 to 18/09 will drop to 18
before dropping to 17.

Creatures, who are successfully subjected to this spell, will tend to
lose the urge to attack the caster if their strength is dropped an
appreciable amount.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wild Deer Speed (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers the speed of a deer upon the spell caster. It
allows the cleric to increase his running rate (double normal movement
speed, usually 18" or 24") by 1" per 2 levels of the cleric.  Also,
while under this spell's effect, the cleric does not become fatigued or
winded by running at such a fast pace. Furthermore, the cleric can leap
forward for 10' + 1' per level when running. The material component for
this spell is mistletoe plus a chip of deer's hoof.

Third Level Spells

========================================================================

Aura of Nature (Abjuration, Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1-12 HD of undead per level
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, it surrounds the caster with an overwhelming
aura of life. This aura is comforting to woodland creatures (+25% on
reaction roles) for it is the sensation of life which puts the animals
at ease with the caster.

This, however, is not the principle purpose for the spell. Its primary
use is to turn undead. Undead creatures find this sensation emanating
from the caster's aura very distasteful. When undead encounter this
sensation, they are usually repulsed. This occurs if the caster
succeeds in turning undead as a cleric does. If the die roll "to turn
undead" does not succeed then the undead are not repulsed.

The caster's level is the level used to determine the effect of the
turning. This is only the case if the caster is in natural
surroundings (such as forest, underground caverns and caves, or plains
etc.).

If the caster in in his own consecrated grove, then the caster gets a
+4 modifier to the die roll to turn undead and in addition is allowed
to turn twice the normal number of undead.

If the caster is in an unnatural surrounding (such as buildings or the
astral and ethereal planes of existence) then he turns undead as a
cleric two levels lower then his current level. This is because the
influence of nature is reduced in these surroundings (note: in some
man-made surroundings there may not be a reduction because of the
circumstances - a man-made garden for example).

Berserker (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One believer per level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it invokes the caster's deity to instill
battle madness upon his followers. This causes them to turn into
berserkers. When in this state they only attack enemies and not each
other or their allies.

The effects of this state gives the warriors a large moral bonus (+60),
a to hit/damage bonus (+1/+2), and additional attacks per round
(+1/2).

The major restriction for this spell is that the recipients of this
spell must be true followers of the caster's god. Also they will tend
to fight until the spell finishes or there is a severe morale failure.

This spell is used exclusively by warrior clerics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cure Medium Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of cure moderate wounds. The spell
cures (or causes) 6-27 (3d8+3) hit points per application. Otherwise
this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dhalkuir's Diametric Abjuration (Abjuration)

Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Weapon touched
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the cleric causes a single weapon to have a
+1/+3 to hit/damage bonus when used against creatures whose alignment
is opposed to that of the cleric.  Thus, if a lawful good cleric cast
the spell, neutral evil, chaotic evil, and chaotic neutral creatures
would be affected.  In the case of a neutral good cleric, opposing
alignments are lawful/neutral/chaotic evil, and so on for other
clerics.  If the concerned creature attempts to touch the weapon, it
takes damage equal to one point per level of the spell caster (half if
a save is made).  In the case of outer-plane creatures, the to
hit/damage bonus is +3/+5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Etherealness (Alteration)

Sphere: Astral
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2 people per 3 levels maximum
Saving Throw: Negates

The priest can take himself and others into the Border Ethereal. From
there the travellers are on their own (DM's, you may want to read the
Dungeon Master's Guide, second edition, or the Manual of the Planes).
The reverse can force a creature out ot the Border Ethereal into your
plane. Naturally this spell fails if the Ethereal Plane is not
reachable. Anyone touched by the caster, as long as within the area of
effect (see above), is also drawn into the Border Ethereal. Unwilling
victims are allowed a saving throw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heat (Alteration) Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range : 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1/2" radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes excitation of air molecules so as to make them emit
heat.  The heat thus created is equal to that of a small fire in
intensity, but its sphere is limited to 1" in diameter.  It lasts for
the duration indicated, or until the caster utters a word to extinguish
the heat.  The heat will melt 1/12' of ice per round.  The spell can
take effect wherever the caster directs as long as he has a line of
sight or unobstructed path for the spell.

If this spell is cast on a creature, the applicable magic resistance
and saving throw dice rolls must be made.  Success indicates that the
the spell takes affects the area immediately behind the creature,
rather than the creature itself.  Failure indicates that the target
creature will take 2 points of damage per melee round from the heat
unless some means of protection from heat is available.  The material
component for the spell is a tinder box and some wood shavings.  Fire
resistance (potion or ring) totally negates the effects of a heat
spell, as will immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice
storm spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lion's Claw (Alteration)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric causes his fingernails to grow and
thicken into claws.  He is able to attack with these claws twice a
round, doing 1d4+1 points of damage each plus strength bonuses.  Damage
from these claws will affect creatures that can only be hit by +3 or
less magic weapons.  But, the claws are not magical.  Note that the
claws does not affect the cleric's spell casting ability or his
capability to hold or manipulate objects.  To cast this spell, the
cleric needs a sprig of mistletoe and a claw from a lion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oxen Strength (Alteration)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Through the use of oxen strength, the cleric is able to endow himself
or herself with the strength of an ox. The result is that the cleric's
strength is raised 1 point for every level that he has attained, to a
maximum of 18.  The component for this spell is mistletoe and a strip
of beef jerky made from an ox that was sacrificed during one of the
clerical rites.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Constriction (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: 3"
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast, a Protection from Constriction spell will mitigate crushing
damage taken each round from a single attack form.  Up to one point per
level of the spell caster is deducted from crushing damage.  Note that
this does not mitigate damage from crushing weapons or falling; it will
protect against constriction, bear hugs, Bigby's Crushing Hand, or any
similar gradual compression.  Example: a sixth level cleric under the
effect of this spell is hugged by an owlbear on three consecutive
rounds for 3, 10, and 7 points of damage.  Damage accrued over each
round would be zero, 4, and 1 point(s), respectively.  The material
component is a hard-boiled egg anywhere on the spell recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Lycanthropes, 10' radius (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equal to the fourth level priest spell Protection from
Evil, 10' radius, except as noted above, and that it protects only from
lycanthropes. The material component of this spell is a small silver
dagger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Petrification (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell gives a +4 bonus on all saving throws versus any
petrification attack for each creature touched.  The material component
is a jellyfish tentacle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Undead, 10' radius (Abjuration)

Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equal to the fourth level priest spell Protection from
Evil, 10' radius, except as noted above, and that it protects only from
undead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remove Scar (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The purpose of this spell is to remove scars caused by battle or other
mishaps. Any comeliness that was lost due to scarring is now restored
from application of this spell. Larger scars may require several
applications to remove all the effects of the disfigurement.

The reverse of this spell causes hideous scars to form on the targets
face and body causing a loss of 1-3 comeliness points. Multiple
applications of this spell cannot drop comeliness lower than 0. A save
vs. spells will negate the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Root (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 3 creatures maximum
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the cleric causes a willing recipient's feet,
paws or hooves to be firmly rooted to the ground, becoming immovable.
The creature gains an extra saving throw vs. paralysation at +4 to
avoid being thrown back, picked up, knocked down or blown around.
Success means the creature remains standing; failure indicates the
situation is to be handled normally, with another saving throw if
allowed. The recipient may "root" and "unroot" at will, as long as it
occurs within the duration of the spell. Rooting or unrooting takes 1
segment. The recipient may not perform any action requiring legwork
(walking, running, etc.) while rooted. At he end of the spell's
duration, the recipient is automatically unrooted.

Optionally, the spell may be cast upon an unwilling subject (who must
be touched by the caster and fail a save vs. spells at -2 to be
affected). Unlike the caster, the victim has no control over the spell
once touched and is anchored until released by the cleric, the root
duration expires or it is dispelled. The material components for this
spell are mistletoe and a small piece of root from a large tree,
preferably oak.

Root is one of the special prayers granted by Saint Timorel, patron of
clerical groves and retreats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selective Entangle (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 8"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One person per 2 levels
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is very similar to the first level clerical spell Entangle
except for one major difference. It effects only the creatures targeted
for the spell effects and no-one else, unlike the entangle spell.

When the creature(s), who are effected by this spell, try to walk by
any form of plant life, the plants will reach out and grab the
creatures much in the same manner as the Entangle spell. Thus if they
are trapped by the spell others can then walk up to the entangled
creatures. In this respect the spell is similar to Hold Person in its
effects.

If the creature fails its saving throw vs. spells then it is held fast
by the plants. If the save is made then the targeted creature has its
movement reduced to half normal.

If the creature struggles to free themselves from the plants then a new
saving throw vs. spells can be made every turn (note: this is very
tiring work). The strength to hit bonus can be used as a positive DM on
these additional saves. If the creature makes one of these additional
saving throws then they are "freed" but their movement is still reduced
by half. If after another turn the creature is still in an area with
plant life then a save vs. spells is required with the effects outlined
above occurring.

In short, a save must be made every turn when in areas of vegetation to
determine the effects of the spell if the spell target is actively
fighting the effects of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stone Seeds (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 month
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 5" long square per level
Saving Throw: None

When the stone seed spell is cast, it causes plant seeds to become
magically enchanted so as to enable them to grow in to solid stone.
The seeds will grow at quadruple normal rate for 4 weeks. During this
time the roots will grow down into the stone a distance of 1" per level
of the caster in hard stone or 2" per level in soft stone. After this
month (28 days) is over, the plants will grow normally. Thus they will
require food, light, and sunlight if they are to continue growing after
this point.

The effect of the plants growing into a stone structure are rather
nasty, for it could remove around 10-90% of the structure's structural
points, depending upon the thickness of the stone.

To cast this spell, the cleric must mix a handful of seeds from
whatever hardy plants are available (such as crabgrass, ivy, cactus,
dandelion etc.) with the seeds to be planted. This must be then mixed
in a leather pouch with sapphire dust of not less than 50 GP value per
5" square area to be covered. The caster then "sows" the seeds as he
casts the spell with the seeds magically implanting themselves in the
stone.

The spell takes 1 turn per 5" square area to be covered to cast.

Adaptation (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell exactly duplicates the effects of a Necklace of Adaptation
for the specified duration.  The material component is a vial of holy
or unholy water ingested by the spell recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awake (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Healing
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric invokes the blessings of his deity
and claps his hands sharply once.  The sound of the clap allows all
creatures within the area of effect who hears it to awaken.  Sleeping
(naturally or magically induced) creatures will wake up.  Those under
the influence of mind affecting drugs/substances will become coherent
for 1 round per level of the caster.  Creatures who's minds are under
some sort of foreign influence (i.e. charmed, hypnotised, dominated,
enthralled, etc. but not possessed) get a second saving throw.  In any
case, all creatures within the effect will experience a temporary
clarity of thought.  Note, this may make the subject more vulnerable to
any mind based earsdropping such as ESP or empathy.  The material
component for this spell is a 1,000 GP gem hanging on a chain which
must be wound around the cleric's hand while he claps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beppie's Happy Hour (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 100-foot radius area
Saving Throw: Special

Casting this spell can have quite unpredictable effects, i.e. no one
can predict what will happen after the spell's duration has expired.
When cast, all creatures within 100 feet of the caster are immediately
overcome by an enormous feeling of joy and an unresistible desire to
party. No saving throw is applicable.

For exactly one hour, everyone within the area of effect will party:
they will drink, sing, dance, and otherwise rejoice. Also, all within
the area of effect will feel no feelings of hatred, fear, or other
"negative" feelings. All others will be considered friends, for the
time being.

Anyone entering the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spells
to avoid being affected. This roll is repeated every round. Those
leaving the area of effect will remain under the spell's effect, but
upon noticing that they are leaving the fun place, they will probably
try to return to the party, since they're really in the mood.

Note that the area of effect moves with the caster, that the caster
himself is always affected by the spell, and that those affected by the
spell will probably have run out of alcohol at the end of the spell's
duration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of cure medium wounds. The spell
cures (or causes) 9-37 (4d8+5) hit points per application. Otherwise
this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Curse (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: None

When cast, a detect curse spell enables the cleric to detect the
existence of a curse on the creature or object, such as a cursed
sword.  The spell will detect the first cursed creature or object that
lies along the casting cleric's line of sight (and within range) with a
base chance of 50%.  An extra 1% is added to the base chance for each
level of experience of the casting cleric.  Note that stone of more
than 1' thickness or metal of any thickness will block the spell.  The
material components of the spell are the cleric's holy or unholy symbol
and a crushed sapphire of at least 1000 GP value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Double Specialisation (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster's weapon
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the second level cleric spell Specialisation
except for two differences. The first is that it gives the cleric
double specialisation in the god's preferred weapon, if he has one, or
the clerics weapon of choice if not. The second difference is that this
spell can be used to give specialisation to another person in any
chosen weapon.

The material and somatic gestures are the same as for specialisation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fearlessness (Abjuration)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: All followers in a 6" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it fills the followers of the caster's god
with bravery. For the duration of the spell, all of the followers will
be immune to any form of fear.

There is one additional material component required. The spell requires
the ritual slaying of a "brave" animal such as a lion. The cleric then
drinks the blood of the animal and then "blesses" the followers, thus
transferring the trait of bravery to them.

That material component causes some druids to be upset, so that there
is sometimes friction between the religion that uses this spell and the
local sect of druids.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fish Command (Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One fish
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any fish within range as long
as the fish can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal fishes
can be affected, including variants in size. Thus catfish, sharks etc.
can be commanded but dolphins (mammals) or mermaids cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
fish will automatically understand the language the caster is speaking.
Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they cannot be
commanded by this spell. The material component of this spell is a
fish's fin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hallucinatory Plain (Illusion/Phantasm) Reversible

Sphere: Charm
Range: 8"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 4" long square per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the hallucinatory forest spell (q.v.) save
that the caster causes an area to appear as if it is a relatively flat
plain or clearing.

The greatest uses for this spell would be to hide a forest to protect
or trap others. Other uses would be to hide a chasm, mine, or to extend
a cliff...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meandering Path (Alteration, Illusion)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 1 mile + 1/2 mile per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 10 feet at both sides of path travelled
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the cleric causes a path (which appears to be natural,
old, man-made, etc) to appear.  Any who come across this path will
believe it to be what it appears.  To cast the spell, the cleric needs
two branches from an oak tree.  One is planted at the beginning of the
path.  The cleric then walks the route that he wishes the magical path
to follow.  At the end of the path the other branch is planted and the
spell is cast. Travel upon the path is either easy or hard (depending
on the cleric's choice of travel).  Those who happen on the path must
make a saving throw.  Average the hit dice or levels of the group and
roll one saving throw (DM does this without the group's knowledge).  If
they fail, the path then appears to be heading in the direction that
they wish to travel.  If the save is made, the path appears as it is
(i.e. a path in the direction that the cleric walked) and the group may
still decide to follow it anyway.

While travelling on this path, the group will never surprise anyone or
anything and suffers a penalty of on all rolls (saves, to hit, damage,
Dex checks, etc.).  Those trying to leave the path after travelling
upon it find that the path is bordered by heavy thorns that block
passage and writhe and grasp all who enter (cf. Wall of Thorns &
Entangle).  This wall attacks as the cleric doing 1d6+2 points of
damage.  Each 10' section of thorns has 3 attacks.  The wall arches
over the path to prevent exit by flying, leaping, etc.  The spell also
counters the ability of Pass without Trace of other clerics.

Fire results in a double strength Wall of Fire in that area (but it
does not create a passable space, i.e.  take fire damage and still be
attacked by thorns).  The only way to leave the path is to follow it to
its end (or teleport, go ethereal, plane shift).  A Dispel Magic is
possible only on the oak branches at the end of the path (either one).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moonlight (Alteration)

Sphere: Sun
Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 10,000 contiguous square feet or yards (see below)
Saving Throw: None

A Moonlight spell produces, in the area of effect, ambient light equal
to that of a full moon regardless of cloud or tree cover, although
objects below tree cover or ceilings will cast normal shadows.
Underground, the area of effect is in square feet, outdoors, in square
yards.  The material component is a 50 GP moonstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neutralise Gas (Alteration) Reversible

Sphere: Protection
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1' per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell will detoxify any poisonous gas. Any poisonous gas within
the area of effect will be turned into a fine watery mist and be
completely harmless. Even Green Dragon breath will be rendered harmless
by this spell.

If the spell is cast upon an object or creature, then the sphere will
move with the target. A target creature would get a save vs. spells to
avoid this effect if they are unwilling. If the target saves then the
globe will center in the nearby area. Use the thrown missiles table to
determine where the spell actually centers. This may mean that the
target is still in the area of effect until it moves.

The reverse of this spell, Poison Gas, will create a cloud of poisonous
gas which will slay outright any creatures in the area of effect that
are under 2+1 Hit Dice. All other creatures must make a save vs. poison
at -2 every round that they stay in the cloud or die in 1-3 rounds. If
the creatures make their save for that round, then they only take 3-18
damage instead. If the target creature has the spell centered around
itself, and then has a slow poison cast, then the target only takes 1
point of damage per round.

Regardless of what version of the spell is cast, the caster holy symbol
and a sprig of belladonna is required to cast the spell. The belladonna
disappears after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pacify (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 12"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: All creatures in a 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the cleric dispels feelings of anger and fear
from the target creatures.  Note that this does not produce any
feelings of goodwill in the subjects: a creature engaged in
premeditated homicide would be unaffected.  The duration is permanent
until the creatures in concern are again given cause to be angry or
afraid.  Note: magic resistance does not affect this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possess Animal (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 100" + 10" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: One natural creature
Saving Throw: Negates

By use of this spell, the cleric is able to project his spirit into
that of an animal, forcing the creature to behave according to his
will.  The creature must be a normal creature and have fewer hit dice
than the cleric.  The animal is allowed a saving throw versus spell and
if successful the spell has no effect.  Once the animal is possessed,
the cleric can cause it to do anything within its ability, regardless
of the consequences to the animal.  However, for every point of damage
suffered by the animal, the cleric suffers 1/2 a point of damage.  In
addition, should the animal die while under the control of the
shukenja, a system shock roll must be made.  If the roll is failed, the
cleric also dies.  While controlling the animal, the cleric's body
enters a catatonic state.  If the body is disturbed or moved, the spell
is disrupted.  The material component for this spell is a holly leaf
and some hair from the animal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2 per creature touched
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: None

All creatures affected by this spell are bestowed with the equivalent
of a +1 Ring of Protection (+1 on armour class and saving throws).  This
is not cumulative with bonuses given by rings or cloaks of protection.
Each creature may be touched only once, i.e., the protection is not
stackable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection From Elementals, 10' radius (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equal to the fourth level priest spell Protection from
Evil, 10' radius, except as noted above, and that it protects only from
elementals. The material component for this spell is some substance of
elementary sort (e.g., a handful of sand, some water, or even just
blowing into the air). For every element supplied while casting, the
appropriate elementals will be scared away.

Remove Scars (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person
Saving throw: Special

On casting this spell, the cleric is empowered to remove scars or other
similar marks (burn marks, birth marks, etc.).  This will enable the
recipient of the spell to restore lost charisma caused by such marks.
Note that this spell will not affect charisma lowered by other means
(e.g. magical).  Charisma can be restored by up to 1/2 point per level
of the caster, rounded up (4 points at 7th and 8th levels, 5 points at
9th and 10th levels, etc.).  Charisma cannot be restored above its
former value by means of this spell.

Multiple applications will only succeed if the recipient makes a saving
throw against spells for each application after the first.  If the
saving throw is unsuccessful, then no more points can be restored by
the use of this spell.  Future charisma loss can, however, be
restored.  The reverse of the spell is not permanent, but will reduce
charisma by 2-5 points for a duration of 1 turn per level of the
caster.  The target of a bestow scars spell must be touched.  If the
victim is touched, a successful saving throw versus spells is necessary
in order to negate the effects of the spell.

Reptile Command (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One reptile
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any reptile within range as
long as the reptile can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only
normal reptiles can be affected, including variants in size. Thus
lizards, giant lizards etc.  can be commanded but dragons cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
reptile will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they
cannot be commanded by this spell.  The material component of this
spell is a reptile's tail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanctum Sigil (Abjuration, Invocation)

Sphere: Guardian
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10" radius sphere centered on the sigil
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a magical symbol similar to that produced by a Glyph
of Warding.  It is inscribed in the air, does not move, and provides
protection from either law, chaos, good, or evil, in the following
manner: should any creature of the specified alignment enter the area
of effect, the cleric will be mentally alerted to its presence, even
awakened from sleep, provided that the cleric is himself within the
area of effect.  Note that the warning message to the cleric gives
neither its alignment nor its location, and only the cleric receives
said message.  The material component is burning incense.

Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One avian
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any avian within range as long
as the avian can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal
avians can be affected, including variants in size. Thus eagles,
sparrows, doves etc. can be commanded but pegasi and phoenixes cannot.
The command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
avian will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they
cannot be commanded by this spell. The material component of this spell
is a feather.

Cure Critical Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of cure serious wounds. The spell
cures (or causes) 13-48 (5d8+8) hit points per application. Otherwise
this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cure Insanity (Abjuration)

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The casting of this spell cures one mental malady in the subject.
Insanity applies to any form of temporary or permanent mental illness,
even those brought on by psionic attack or spell, such as Feeblemind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dariod's Vestigial Vine (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration 1 round per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell will allow the caster to grow forth from one of his fingers
a vine. While any finger from either of the caster's hands is usable,
the index finger of the caster's primary hand is generally chosen. The
vine, while a magical extension of the cleric's body, is treated as a
separate physical entity, therefore having an AC 5 and 30 hit points
(plus an additional 2 HP per level of the casting cleric).

The spell will end when either the maximum duration is reached or the
vine takes more damage than it has hit points. The vine moves in a
snaking fashion and is usable in most ways that an arm is. It uses up
one of the caster's actions to use the vestigial vine, so, if the
caster had only 1 attack per round and he chose to attack a creature
with the vine then he would be incapable of performing another action
until the following round.

The vine can attempt to retrieve an object, wield a sickle or similar
weapon (although at a penalty of -2 "to hit" due to the unwieldiness of
a man-made weapon in the vine's clutches), or it may be used to whip
opponents. Whipping is the primary form of attack of the vine and,
assuming a successful "to hit" roll (no adjustments), the target will
receive 1d10 points of damage.

The material component for the spell is a small strand of vine and the
juice from half a dozen holly berries (squeezed from said berries).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entreaty (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 6" radius area
Saving Throw: None

This spell exactly duplicates the effect of a Chant spell, except that
the caster need not continue chanting.  Its effects are cumulative only
with a Chant spell, and not Bless, Prayer, or Protection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Godrage (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the cleric calls down the attention of his
divinity and invokes the righteous wrath of the deity.  As the earthly
consequence of this Godrage, the cleric goes berserk.  He will for the
duration of the spell, instinctively attack in melee combat any
unbelievers (creatures of a differing alignment) within a 6" radius,
giving preference to the most extreme alignments first.  The spell does
not give knowledge of specific alignments, only a feeling of who is the
most worthy of being punished.  Note use of this spell may result in
the cleric attacking his own party members.

While under the effects of the spell, the cleric attacks on the fighter
table and gains a temporary skill level with his weapons (note: in my
world, specialisation is more developed and certain clerics can
specialise to some degree, those who are not specialised, gain the
basic level of specialisation for the Duration of this spell).
Furthermore, the presence of the divinity surrounds the cleric in the
form of an aura that reduces all damage taken by the cleric by 2 points
(1 point minimum).  Godrage is a state not unlike the berserkergang,
but it differs in that while the cleric engages solely in physical
combat, he is still able to make intelligent decisions on how combat is
to be conducted.  After the spell ends, the cleric must rest 1 round
for every 2 rounds under the spells effect.  The components for this
spell is the cleric's body, a short verbal sermon given to the
unbelievers and a consecrated weapon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hidden Champion (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One sentient creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Through the use of this spell, the cleric establishes a link between
his lifeforce and the subject creature's.  The effect of this link is
that one-half the damage sustained by one, is transferred to the
other.  This link is evidenced by a golden, pulsing thread connecting
the two through the ethereal plane.  When the link is in existence, the
two creatures cannot be more than 1 mile per level of the spell caster
apart or the link will snap, ending the spell.  Those able to perceive
the ethereal plane can see this link.  Note that the damage transfer is
two way.  A duly consecrated alter, holy or unholy water, an
appropriate sacrifice (DM's discretion) and the creature to be linked
with are the material components for this spell.

Side note: I used this for an evil cleric the party was trying to
kill.  The cleric kidnapped the betrothed of the paladin and performed
this ceremony upon her.  This really messed up the party since, now
they couldn't just rush in and hack up the cleric in an orgasm of
hack-n-slash.  They had to capture the cleric and remove him from his
sanctuary alive. (I run consecrated grounds as being "home field" for
clerics and very disadvantageous for would be desecrators. Example: -1
penalty on everything per alignment difference, cumulative bless for
the clerics and generally "bad luck" for the attackers)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Karma (Alteration)

Sphere: All
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With each casting of this spell, the cleric raises his effective level
by one, to a maximum of two additional levels of effectiveness.  The
increase applies to all clerical actions: spell effects, turning
undead, saving throws, hit probability, etc.  Not affected by this
spell are hit points, number of spells known and level of spells
known.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiss of Death (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None

This spell will instantly kill the target. In order for the spell to
take effect, the caster must kiss the victim. Note that this spell
grants the victim no saving throw, but has an important prerequisite:
the victim of the spell must be in love with the caster. This love must
be non-magical in nature. Furthermore, the victim may not be under the
influence of any spell from the Enchantment/Charm school.

This spell may only be cats by a good-aligned priest if he himself is
also im love with the victim, and commits suicide immediately after the
casting.

The material component for this spell are the caster's holy symbol and
some icewater, which is to be smeared upon the caster's lips.

the effect is, of course, lightning.  Damage is 6d8, half if a save is
made.

Mammal Command (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One mammal
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any mammal within range as long
as the mammal can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal
mammals can be affected, including variants in size. Thus polar bears,
whales, etc. can be commanded but sphinxes and xorns cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
mammal will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Note that for this purpose, humans, demihumans and humanoids
are not considered mammals.  Since familiars are not considered to be
normal animals, they cannot be commanded by this spell. The material
component of this spell is a nail of a mammal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ostracise (Charm)

Sphere: Protection (reversed)
Range: 10'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: Negates

Upon casting this spell, the victim is effectively ostracised form his
community: everyone knowing the victim will look upon him with
disregard, or even disgust. Even good friends and close relatives will
start neglecting and avoiding the character, eventually resulting in
total isolation of the victim.

This spell only affects reactions of those that knew the character
before the spell was cast: the victim can, for example, more to another
town and start a "new life" there. People meeting him there will react
normally, unless the outcast's reputation has somehow reached them, in
which case the may act prejudiced.

This spell can be remove by a Remove Curse spell, provided it is cast
by someone of at least two levels higher than the caster of Ostracise.
Also, a Limited Wish or Wish will remove the effects.

To cast this spell, the priest must point at the victim and order him
to leave the community, informing him that his presence there is no
longer appreciated. The victim must be able to understand the words of
the caster. The victim receives a saving throw vs. spells, modified for
wisdom, with a -1 penalty to the die roll for every three levels of
experience he has less than the caster. If the victim is of higher
level, he receives a +1 bonus for every level of difference.

permanently enchanted fire items (i.e., Sword, Flame Tongue) will have
the above chance of being extinguished for one round.  The material
component is holy or unholy water.

Stonewood (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 turns
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: None

When the cleric casts a Stonewood and touches a wooden object, the wood
in that object is magically enhanced and given a stonelike strength.
The altered wood is in every way the same as untreated wood (i.e.
texture, colour, weight, flexibility, etc.) except for the stonelike
strength and hardness. An object of up to 100 square feet ' 1 inch per
level of the cleric of wood can be affected by this spell. To cast this
spell, the cleric needs mistletoe and a gemstone of at least 500 GP.

Viper's Bite (Alteration)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

The Viper's Bite spell causes the cleric's teeth to become
exceptionally sharp and hollow like the fangs of a viper. He is able to
bite for 1d4+1 points of damage and inject the victim with a nerve
poison.  The effects of this poison is to paralyse the victim for 3d4
rounds if a save versus poison is failed. If the save is successful,
the victim still becomes lethargic and woozy (-1 on STR, DEX and
initiative rolls).  The effects of the poison are cumulative for
multiple bites.  Like the lion's claw spell, this spell allows the
cleric to bite those creatures hit only by +3 magical weapons. Again,
the bite is not considered a magical weapon attack. To cast this spell
the cleric needs mistletoe and a charm made from a poisonous snake's
fang.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 1" per 4 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 5 pounds per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the clerical second level spell warp wood
except that metal is the substance affected. For those objects that
possess structural strength, this spell does 1 point of structural
damage per 3 levels of the caster.  Against metal creatures (i.e. iron
golems) the spell inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage per level of the
caster (save for 1/2).

Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: All creatures within 10' radius sphere

Mass Cure (Necromancy) Reversible

Sphere: Healing
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, every creature in the area of effect
(including the caster) up to one creature per level of the caster is
cured for 1d8 plus 1/2 the level of the caster points of damage.  This
is as per Cure Light Wounds spell (q.v.).  The limitations on what
creatures can be thus affected is as per that spell.  If more creatures
than can be affected are within the spell radius, preference is given
to those closest to the cleric.  Also, if a near creature is not
affectable by the spell, it still counts towards the total number of
possible creatures cured.

The reverse of the spell does the same amount of points of damage to
all within the spell radius.  The material Components for this spell is
a vial of holy or unholy water that must be sprinkled into the air
above the caster's head while the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Polymorph into Tree (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: One creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is similar to the polymorph other spell except that target
creatures can only be turned into trees (usually oak).  All creatures
get a saving throw to avoid the effects of this spell.  Those who fail
turn into trees with their minds trapped within.  Clothing, possession,
etc. are not transformed as part of the spell.  Those who save, feel
their limbs turn wooden and stiff (effects as if a slow spell were cast
upon them, with duration 2 rounds per level of the cleric).  To cast
this spell, the cleric needs a sprig of holly and tree sap from the
tree type to which the targets are being polymorphed into.  Only a wish
or a higher level cleric can reverse the effects of this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Undead (Abjuration) Reversible

Sphere: Protection
Components: V, S, M
Range: 0
Casting Time: 1 round
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Saving Throw: None
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere

This spell duplicates an effect of a Helm of Brilliance, causing the
cleric's holy symbol to glow a bright blue when undead are within 3".
All undead within this area and exposed to the light will take 1-6
points of damage per round, no saving throw.  Any creature under the
effects of this pain cannot cast offensive spells.  In addition, the
cleric receives a +1 bonus on his d20 rolls to turn undead in the area
of effect.

The reverse of the spell, Protect Undead, is cast on a single undead
creature (or paladin; see rules for evil clerics) and will either
nullify the effects of a Protection from Undead spell, or move the
spell recipient into one higher category for purposes of turning.
Example: a lich in spell combat with a 13th level cleric casts Protect
Undead on himself.  He is immune to the effects of any Protection from
Undead spell the other cleric casts, and requires that the cleric roll
a 19 on a d20 to turn him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sacrifice (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 hours
Area of affect: Caster plus one other creature
Saving throw: Negates

This spell allows the Cleric to give up some of HP to another character
in order that he can be better able to complete a Quest.  This is not
"current HP" but "maximum HP".  The condition is reversed when the
character returns from the Quest successfully.  If the character fails,
the HP return to the Cleric at the rate of 1 per week.

Here's an example: Suppose a high level cleric (with 78 HP) wants Sir
Belvedere (80 HP) to retrieve a magical mace that was stolen.  Sir
Belvedere agrees, but only if the cleric Sacrifices 70 of his HP, to
ensure good faith and to help complete the mission.  The Cleric agrees,
and Sir Belvedere goes out in search of the mace.  At this point Sir
Belvedere effectively has 150 HP, and, for all intents and purposes his
maximum HP is now 150.  Likewise the Cleric's maximum HP total is 8.

Now suppose Sir Belvedere is successful in his mission.  When he
delivers the Mace to the Cleric, they both immediately return to their
normal maximum HP value.  (Although maybe not their current HP value,
if Sir Belvedere is wounded.)  (Current damage to the spell recipient
is split evenly among the two when HP are returned.)

But suppose Sir Belvedere was killed before the mission was complete.
That means that the Cleric will have to wait 70 weeks until he returns
to his normal maximum HP total.

Seventh Level Spells

Avatar (Invocation)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

The use of this spell brings forth very potent energies to the casters
disposal. The spell actually causes part of the caster's deity to
inhabit the caster. The caster will then become an Avatar of the god
with one of the god's aspects.

The Avatar will have the powers of a demi-power and will have the
casters choice of one of the classes the deity has experience in (one
of the Deity's aspects). In addition to these powers, the caster will
still retain his own powers and abilities. If the class chosen is the
same as one of the classes that the caster has, then he will have the
higher of the two levels.

The caster will retain the power until the situation no longer requires
it (plus a couple of rounds for mopping up), or the Avatar is killed.
If the Avatar is killed, then the deity loses the abilities of the
class for 1/10 of the time that the god would normally be "dead" as if
slain on his home plane.

In order to receive this spell at all, the caster must exemplary in his
faith. The spell, if used, would require special sacrificing
afterwards. Exactly when and how much depends on the god.

If the spell is used to confront another Avatar or Deity, then rather
than having a confrontation, the Deity may decide to do something else
instead, such as any form of indirect help. If the deities involved are
traditional enemies...

If the privilege of having this spell is misused in any way, then the
offending caster will be severely punished, maybe losing the
opportunity to cast this spell forever, or in a more serious
transgression, losing all clerical abilities as well forever.

The Deity is not enslaved by this spell and thus does not have to
answer the spell's partial summons. If the need is there, then more
than likely, the spell will be answered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awaken Forest (Enchantment/Charm, Divination)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: 10-mile + 1 mile per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

With this ceremony, the cleric call upon and wakens the spirit of the
forest.  The effects are that the cleric becomes one with the trees in
the area of effect.  Whatever happens in that area, the cleric
instantaneously knows.  He has the power to cause 1 tree per level
within that area to animate as if it were a treant.  Any real treants
in the area become aware of him and are receptive to any suggestions
made by the cleric. A Changestaff (cf. Changestaff spell) is needed to
if any trees are animated.  Each tree animated reduced the Changestaff
by one hit die.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Warrior (Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

It is only a god of War, Death or a deity that is perverse who will
allow his followers to use a spell such as this.

The spell is cast when the caster has been struck his death blow. The
spell cannot be cast if the caster is knocked below his level in
negative hit points in any one round. The spell can be cast even if the
caster had already cast a spell in the combat round.  It is very
difficult for the caster not to get the spell off.

The effects of the spell occur immediately. The caster has all his or
her spells memorised, and his level and hit points are doubled for the
duration of the spell. The caster will not have any more spells than
his normal level would allow. The caster will fight insanely and attack
all foe in sight until the spell ends, the caster dies again, the
caster casts another death warrior spell, or the spell duration ends.

When the spell finally ends, the caster immediately dies, and the body
vanishes, not to be found. The Deity personally collects the soul of
the caster.

The caster will use the spell if he thinks that there is a battle that
he will not survive in and will thus try to use this spell for a last
revenge.

The caster cannot be brought back to life, but if a group of
adventurers went and petitioned the Deity of the caster, then the Deity
may decide to free the casters soul in exchange for a service (a
suitably long quest will do...).

The spell, when cast, causes the caster's holy symbol to destroy itself
in a dramatic manner (blows up in a flash of light and sound, melts,
etc.) but causes no other effect. If the spell is to be cast a second
time, then the caster will require a second symbol.

Sphere: Combat
Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One undead
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is a powerful weapon against undead creatures.  When it is
cast, a thin ray about 1 cm in diameter springs forth from the cleric's
pointing finger and strikes the selected target.  Any undead creature
so struck must save versus magic or take 6d8 of damage and roll on
percentile dice as if hit with a Mace of Disruption.  If the save is
made, the affected creature takes 4d8 of damage, with the remaining 2d8
striking the cleric in a backlash of energy.

Lifeforce (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 9"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster and one target creature
Saving Throw: None

Through the use of this spell, the caster is pitting his lifeforce
against that of the target creature.  This is the pure confrontation of
two being's will to live.  Each rolls 1d20 and adds it to his or its
current hit points.  This can be modified by bless, chant, prayer, ring
of protection, cloak of protection, luckstone, luck sword, wisdom
bonus, etc.

If the target creature's total is less than 1/2 the caster's total,
then the target creature is overwhelmed and dies (in this case, the
caster suffers fatigue equal to 1/2 the target's roll in hit points).
If the target creature's total is less than the caster's total but more
than 1/2 the caster's total, then the target is stunned for 2d4 rounds
(-5 to AC, initiatives, saves, "to hit" and damage rolls) and the
caster suffers fatigue equal to the difference in totals.  If the
target's total is more than the caster's, then the caster dies and the
target suffers damage equal to the difference in totals.  Fatigue is
recovered at a rate of 1 hit point per round.  The material component
for this spell is the cleric's holy or unholy symbol, a pair of ivory
six-sided dice (worth 200 GP) and a drop of the caster's blood.

Razorwind (Alteration, Invocation)

Sphere: Combat, Elemental (Air)
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the caster brings about a transformation of the
air about himself, "compressing" large volumes of it into a minute area
and sending it at a target.  Though this wind has no actual "edge," it
is highly effective when it strikes its target, causing 1d8 points of
damage per level of the caster.  In addition, the victim of the
Razorwind must make a saving throw vs. Rods or an extremity will be
severed (as per a blow from a Sword of Sharpness)!  This saving throw
is modified by "+1" for each plus of magical armour the target is
wearing (only armour: not shields, rings, bracers, etc).  In addition
persons wearing plate mail or better receive an extra "+1" on the
saving roll.

Because such a large volume of air is needed to create the Razorwind,
this spell can only be cast outdoors or in a chamber of vast size (DM's
discretion).  If it is cast in a smaller, confined area (e.g., indoors
or underground passage), it will not function and everyone in the area
will suffer a momentary loss of air.

The material components for this spell are the holy symbol of the
caster, a bloodstone, and a small, flat piece of steel.

Treegrowth (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7 rounds
Area of Effect: One HD per level, one creature, or one building
Saving Throw: Negates

Causes a plant of desired type to start growing upon the target, which
can be a person, building.. whatever. This plant shall feed on the life
force of the target creature, or if cast on something that has none,
then on whatever other energy it can find and use.

If the target is a building, then the plant shall simply grow
in/on/around it, possibly causing structural damage, as specified by
the cleric. It takes seven hours for the plant to grow to full size, so
this spell shall not work as an Instant Ladder. It can, on the other
hand, be used to hide an entrance or make a treasure cache quite
undetectable.

If the target is a creature with life force (or other energy, undeads
and golems are not immune), the plant shall feed on the life force of
the target creature, draining one level of energy until the target is
dropped to -1 hit dice, and dies. The abilities fall as fast as the hit
dice. So, a ninth level character with strength 18 and intelligence 9
would lose 2 points of strength, 1 hit die, and 1 point of
intelligence, among other things, for nine rounds, and then die. The
corpse of the target creature shall then turn into parts of the plant.
For this, Raise Dead etc. is not possible, having intelligence zero
makes Speak with Dead impossible. On the other hand, such a victim can
Reincarnate, and Talk with Plants is not hindered, as the mind remains
within the plant.

This is a spell that is very seldom used by druids because of its long
casting time and obvious evilness. It is used on old druids that feel
that their life is at an end and wish to live on in the grove, or as a
partial retribution on those who destroy plant life needlessly or
violate any dryad, supposing either is within the protection of a
druid.

Well,


I hope you've enjoyed the ASCII Net Prayerbook.

Anyway, I'm in the process of compiling the same kind of files for the
occasional Wizard, and I would like to ask you all out there to send me
every spell you've got for them (don't hesitate to post them if you
think that's more convenient than e-mailing).

Also, any feedback the former files is more than welcome, especially
comments on the lay-out or on the level the several prayers were listed
in.

Also, if you have any more clerical spells, which I can add to the
list, please e-mail them to me or post them, so that they can be
included in my next ASCII Net Prayerbook update.


Boudewijn Wayers.
