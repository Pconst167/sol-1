 DOS Beer:
 Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the
 directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-
 oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8
 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately.  Soon to
 be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it
 after it's no longer available.
 
 Mac Beer:
 At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered
 by many to be a "light" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take
 one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the
 can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you are told that "you don't
 need to know." A notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the
 trashcan.
 
 Windows 3.1 Beer:
 The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac
 Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you
 to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only
 drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the
 Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can
 of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.
 
 OS/2 Beer:
 Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers
 simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too,
 but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open
 them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2
 Beer, but the manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9
 million six-packs have been sold.
 
 Windows 95 Beer:
 You can't buy it yet, but a lot of people have taste-tested it and claim
 it's wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more
 like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside,
 the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep
 drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say
 they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has
 some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the
 manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.
 
 Windows NT Beer:
 Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes
 most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks
 just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the company promises to change the can to
 look just like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 95 beer starts shipping.
 Touted as an "industrial strength" beer, and suggested only for use in
 bars.
 
 Unix Beer:
 Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz.
 Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim
 that all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-
 tops break off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can
 opener around for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete
 set of instructions, or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for
 several years.
 
 AmigaDOS Beer:
 The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up
 by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import.  This
 beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't
 understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely
 loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in
 32-oz. cans too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared
 flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the years, so
 it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for
 watching TV anyway.
 
 VMS Beer:
 Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping.
 However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely
 un-beer-like contents.  Best drunk in high pressure development
 environments.  When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients,
 you're told that is proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the
 manuals published by the FDA.  Rumors are that this was once listed in the
 Physicians' Desk Reference as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have
 actually seen it.
