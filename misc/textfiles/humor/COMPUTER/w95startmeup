@SONG: "Start Me Up"
(Jagger-Richards, 1981)
(HaXoReD by Dis/Dem 1995)
(Sorry Mick.. had to be done)

If you start me up,
If you start me up I'm sure to stop

You can start me up,
You can start me up I'll always stop
I've been running slow
You got me just about to blow my top
You can start me up, you can start me up,
I'll never start, never start, always flop

You make a grown man cry,
  you make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry,
Spread out the code, it aint lean
I crawl rough ride in a lame, lame machine
Start it up

You can start me up
Click on the starter, give it all you've got
(you got, you got)
I can't compete
With other coders and their greater feats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slow it up, slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry,
  don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry,
My files delete, my screen goes green
My hands are tired, she's a lame, lame machine
Start it up

(Don't) Start me up
Ah... you've got to... you've got to
Never, never, never start
Start it up
Ah...start it up, never, never, never
 You make a grown man cry
  you make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Gates has sinned, it runs at slower speed
I'll send your data places that you've never, never seen

It you start it up,
Love the day when we will never start
Never start, always, always, always flop
Don't tough it out
Never start, never start
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come,
you, you, you make a dead man come

@SONG: "Start Me Up"
(Jagger-Richards, 1981)
If you start me up,
If you start me up I'll never stop

You can start me up,
You can start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me just about to blow my top
You can start me up, you can start me up,
I'll never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry,
  you make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry,
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

You can start me up
Kick on the starter, give it all you've got
(you got, you got)
I can't compete
With the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slit it up, slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry,
  don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry,
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

Start me up
Ah... you've got to... you've got to
Never, never, never stop
Start it up
Ah...start it up, never, never, never
 You make a grown man cry
  you make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind, at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

It you start it up,
Love the day when we will never stop
Never stop, never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come,
you, you, you make a dead man come
