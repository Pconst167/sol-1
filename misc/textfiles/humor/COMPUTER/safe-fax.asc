                           IMPORTANT RULES FOR SAFE FAX

            Q:   Do I have to be married to have safe fax?

            A:   Although  married  people  fax quite often, there are many
                 single people who fax complete strangers every day.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   My parents say they never had fax when they were young and
                 were only allowed to write  memos to each other until they
                 were twenty-one.  How old do you think someone  should  be
                 before they can fax?

            A:   Faxing  can  be  performed at any age, once you master the
                 correct technical details.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   If I fax myself, will I go blind?

            A:   Certainly not, as far as we can see.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   There is a place on our  street  where  you can go and pay
                 for fax.  Is this legal?

            A:   Yes.   Many  people  have no other outlet  for  their  fax
                 drives and  must  pay a "professional" when their needs to
                 fax become too great.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   Should a cover always be used for faxing?

            A:   Unless you are really sure  of  the  one  you're faxing, a
                 cover sheet should be used to insure safe fax.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   What happens when the wrong buttons get pushed  and  I fax
                 prematurely?

            A:   Don't  panic.   Many  people  fax  prematurely  when  they
                 haven't faxed in a long  time.   Simply  start over.  Most
                 people won't mind if you try again.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   Sometimes  when  I  fax,  it's  the other person who isn't
                 fully ready, so that faxing doesn't work right.  Is
                 there any solution for this?

            A:   There is only one solution  here:  always  be very patient
                 and compassionate  with  your  fax  partner.    Talk  them
                 through it  carefully,  and  apply lots of fax-play before
                 you start.  Explain to them the importance of pressing the
                 F Spot before you begin, and show them how to do this for
                 themselves.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   Recently a completely unwanted fax was transmitted into my
                 office.  Does this constitute rape?  And if so, can I
                 bring charges and sue the  responsible  party?  Would I be
                 able to collect damages?

            A:   So  far our police departments and our justice  system  do
                 not take  fax  rape too seriously as a charge, even though
                 we all know that many  people  suffer  greatly  from  this
                 heinous crime.  Concerned citizens are now taking steps to
                 combat fax rape and faxism in all its forms, so write your
                 Congressman and  hold  on  to  your evidence.   The  legal
                 climate surrounding this offense may soon change.
       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            Q:   I  have  a  personal  and business fax.  Can transmissions
                 become mixed up?

            A:   Being bi-faxual can be confusing, but as long as you use a
                 cover with each one, you  won't  transmit  anything you're
                 not supposed to.

                 the current uploader.
                 The latter  and  his wife have presented well-attended and
                 professionally recognized  sex education workshops in many
                 parts of  the  US  and in Canada.  They therefore  realize
                 that this  text  could  cause  offense among some of those
                 concerned with the issues  raised  by  both AIDS and rape.
                 They sincerely apologize to any such individuals but
                 also feel that the need to introduce some  note  of  humor
                 into today's  difficult  sexual  climate  outweighs  these
                 considerations.
