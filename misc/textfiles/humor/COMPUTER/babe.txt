In case y'all forgot, Don-man babbled about Don-Man
to Tal Meta on 21 Sep 92  22:51...

D> Tal,babe, I just wanted to tell you that I attempted to communicate with
D> you on sept. 21 for the purpose of some human interaction and some file
D> swapping. I got some games and software you might be interested in and I
D> wanted to see if you did also.  I new at this medium so don't consider me 
D> a dweeb.  so when I figure out how to get through to chat to you or some
D> other humanoid we can do some sharing and caring.

1) I am not a "babe".
2) I could give two shits about files.
3) I could give three shits about games.
4) I am not into "human interaction". I'm asocial, and I like it that way.
5) I don't share well, and I could "care" less.
