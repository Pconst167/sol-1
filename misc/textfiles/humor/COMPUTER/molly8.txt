   ******* EPISODE #8 THE ADVENTURES OF MOLLY MODEM ********
        
   In our last episode Molly had changed into RAM-Beau a tough
machine pistol toting heroine ready to meet any danger! She was
getting ready to investigate Gamma Communications for clues to
the disappearance of her friends Ren and Michael.
        
    Molly drove a quarter mile past Gamma Communications looking
for a place to leave her car. At last she found a spot and parked
out of sight behind a clump of cedar trees. The waning moon
provided just enough light to see the path beside the road.
Although it was unlikely she would meet anyone Molly kept to the
shadows. She ran her finger across the muzzle of the UZI machine
pistol tucked in her large shoulder bag. Just let Baud Job show
his evil face. Half an hour later Molly was in the trees beside
Gamma's parking lot. A large van was parked in the middle of
the lot. Molly sprinted over and crouched behind it. The two
windows on the front were dark. The only light came from the
bulb on the Gamma Communications sign board. Molly dashed over
to one of the windows and quickly peeked inside. Everything was
dark so she moved along to the door. Reaching out she tried the
knob. It was not locked. Thoughts of being arrested for break
and entry raced through her mind. How would she explain the
UZI? Molly found herself in a large warehouse storage area. One
dim bulb provided just enough light to see by. She started
tiptoeing towards the closed door on the other side of the
area. Molly had just passed several large crates and was
reaching for the door when she felt something cold pressed to
the back of her neck.
    "Don't make a move or I'll blow your head off!!!!!!!!!"
Who ever it was grabbed Molly's shoulder bag. So much for coming
prepared. Now all she had was her bare hands. Her captor ordered
her to open the door then prodded her along with his gun. At the
end of the long hallway they came to another door. This one had a
sign on it which read "Dr. George May President Gamma
Communications Corp." With the gun still in her back Molly was
ordered to open it. Inside Molly's heart almost stopped. Behind
the large desk was a small man with a goatee. Beside him sat
Doctor Node and Baud Job. Doctor Node was the first to speak.
    "So nice to see you Miss Modem. Again our paths cross. If I
recall we have some unfinished business to discuss!"
The small man behind the desk now spoke up "Shut up Node! I
give the orders around here. So you are the Miss Modem who has
been causing us so much trouble. I guess we'll have to get rid of
you along with Doctor May and those two nosy sysops."
    Molly was getting over her terror. "Who are you and what
have you done with Ren and Michael?"
    "OH so you know those others. Well they got a little too
close for their own good. My name is Otto Cadd and I don't like
having busy bodies interfering with my plans. Perhaps you have
heard of SPAM? That's short for spying and murder, a branch of
SPECTRE.....Special executive for counter intelligence,
terrorism, revenge and extortion."
     "And just what are your plans?" demanded Molly.
     "I might as well satisfy your curiosity Miss Modem. You and
your friends will not live long enough to use the information.
SPAM has been engaged in stealing computer secrets from American
and Canadian computer systems. Lately our job has gotten far more
difficult. Many systems are starting to use very sophisticated
security hardware. When we first heard about Doctor May and the
device called a coherent password gate we knew we had to act
fast. Doctor May's system would have locked us out of all the
best secrets. So we have taken control of Gamma Communications
and now all coherent password gates contain our own special
modification. I even convinced a nerd computer hacker that he
could help test government security by breaking into every system
possible. I told him I was with the FBI and that we needed help
testing protection on all computer systems. Soon all the big
computers will have coherent password gates and safety from that
dope VonCriptic. BUT! They will then be all OURS!! Hah hah hah hah
hah........All right. Put her in with the others."
        
     "You'll never get away with this Otto Cadd" Hissed Molly.
Her captor then motioned her out with his gun. A very frightened
Molly Modem was taken to another part of the building. A heavy
steel door was opened and Molly was pushed into a windowless
store room. The door slammed and Molly found herself in the
company of Ren, Michael and Doctor May. At least they were
together, and at the moment unharmed. The four captives knew
that they had to escape from the clutches of SPAM. If they
did not do something quick it would be..................
.......ALT...CONTROL...DELETE for them.
            
     Molly motioned her friends over to the corner. "If I can get
us out of this room can you lead us out of the building Doctor
May?" George May replied with a terse "Yes". Molly then turned
her back towards her friends and pulled up her sweater. Reaching
into the left side of her bra she removed a small blue egg.
Pulling her sweater back down she turned and smiled. "An ace up
my sleeve so to speak." Molly then explained what the egg was and
how she was going to open the door. She set the timers and
placed the charges near the hinges of the door. The four captives
took cover behind an old desk. Exactly two minutes later there
was a tremendous bang and the door was blown completely out.
Molly was the first one through the opening. Her captor who had
been standing guard out side lay on the floor. Molly found her
shoulder bag beside his unconscious body and scooped it up.
The UZI and spare magazines were still inside. George lead
them down the corridors and they were soon at the parking lot.
As they started to run there was a loud bang and a heavy slug
slammed into the van parked in front the entrance. Molly and
the others took cover behind the vehicle. Another shot ran out
hitting the van. They were pinned down. If they tried getting
away it would be across open ground and an easy target. Molly
dropped down and crawled to the front of the vehicle. Pulling
the UZI out of her bag she made certain the change lever was
on fully automatic. She then lined up on the window the shots
were coming from. On the next flash she squeezed the trigger.
There was a sound like a huge sheet of canvass ripping and the
window disappeared. Molly heard some screams from the building
and knew she had been on target. The odds were now a bit more even.
 
     George May now spoke up "There is a back door. They may try
to circle around behind us."
     Molly then turned to George and asked "Where is the intake
for your air conditioning system?"
     "You can just see it up on the roof. Why do you ask Molly?"
      Without answering Molly reached under her sweater to the other
side of her bra. She now had the pale yellow egg in the palm of
her hand. Good. The wind was from behind blowing towards the
building. Molly banged the egg against the side of the van then
threw it overhand onto the roof. The egg detonated with a muffled
pop and the fumes were sucked into the building. That should hold
them for a while. Now to get away and call the authorities.
      Molly suddenly heard footsteps in the loose gravel. Turning
around she faced Sam Slick. There was a large magnum revolver in
Slick's right hand. It was pointed directly at her navel. Molly's
finger was tightening on the UZI's trigger. Suddenly she relaxed!
Standing behind Sam Slick was Peter Freeman sysop of Southern
Cross and a dozen RCMP officers.
     "Looks like you don't need much help Molly" said Slick with
a grin. "Seems like you beat us to the punch capturing Cadd and
his gang."
      Molly was confused. This person did not talk or act like the
private eye Sam Slick she had hired. "Just who the blazes are you
Slick?" She asked.
      "Chief field agent for CSIS, Miss Modem. I've been working
undercover for several months trying to discover the source of
several data leaks. Without knowing it you tipped us off to the
real crooks. It's a good thing Peter got worried and called the
RCMP early. If you ever want a job with CSIS I'm sure we could
use your talents."
     "NO WAY! I've had more than enough excitement lately."
        
     Several hours later the four captives of SPAM finished telling
their story to the authorities. Each was then driven home to try
and get a bit of rest. Over the next few days Molly heard that
all the gang members had been rounded up. Otto Cadd, Doctor Node
and Baud Job were in jail awaiting trial. VonCriptic who had been
duped by Cadd would be the main prosecution witness. Slowly life
in Victoria got back to normal. In no time all the local computer
bulletin boards were back in operation. Messages started flowing
as if nothing had ever happened. After so much excitement Molly
Modem was having difficulty concentrating on her programming
job. A week later an envelope for Molly came in the mail. It
was quite thick and had a foreign post mark. Tearing it open
Molly read................
        
   Dear Molly;
        Mexico has been a lot of fun, but the SEA MOSS feels very
   empty without you aboard. I'm anchored just in front of the
   Acapulco yacht club. The boat is provisioned and ready for the
   crossing to the Marquesas. Am hoping you will join me to cruise
   the South Pacific. Inside the letter you will find an airline
   ticket to Acapulco. Please fly down as soon as possible.
 
                                              Yours,
                                             Mark Shippes
                                                             
      Molly placed Mark's letter on the kitchen table and went to
the bedroom. Rummaging through the bottom dresser drawer she muttered
"Now where did I put that red bikini???"..................
               
               ************* THE  END ************
 
    Will we hear any more from Molly Modem? Who knows? With the
magic of Quick-Mail Molly may log onto Farwest or Southern Cross
from some place like Tahiti!  What adventures will she and Mark
get into in the South Pacfic ??????????????
