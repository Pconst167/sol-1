Some guy at Berkeley named Kayvan Aghaiepour hooked the yow server to
the doctor program in gnu emacs.  I ran it and this is what it looked
like:
------------
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

I own seven-eighths of all the artists in downtown Burbank!

Why do you say that?

YOW!!  What should the entire human race DO?? Consume a fifth of CHIVAS REGAL,
ski NUDE down MT. EVEREST, and have a wild SEX WEEKEND!

Are you afraid of sex?

Yow!  And then we could sit on the hoods of cars at stop lights!

I don't understand.

Everybody is going somewhere!! It's probably a garage sale
or a disaster Movie!!

Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

I want you to organize my PASTRY trays...my TEA-TINS are gleaming in
formation like a ROW of DRUM MAJORETTES -- please don't be FURIOUS with me --

Is it because of your life that you are going thru all this?

My BIOLOGICAL ALARM CLOCK just went off..  It has noiseless DOZE FUNCTION
and full kitchen!!

What makes you believe it has noiseless doze function and full
kitchen?

Loni Anderson's hair should be LEGALIZED!!

How do you reconcile the people you hang around with?

My mind is a potato field...

Are you sure that your mind is a potato field?

I'm having a BIG BANG THEORY!!

Perhaps this has something to do with any hobbies you have?

As President I have to go vacuum my coin collection!

Have you been frightened by that?

It's a lot of fun being alive...I wonder if my bed is made?!?

Do you really think that?

--"I love KATRINKA because she drives a PONTIAC.  We're going away now. 
I fed the cat. - Zippy"

Yow!  Are we interactive yet?

All I can think of is a platter of organic PRUNE CRISPS being trampled
by an army of swarthy, Italian LOUNGE SINGERS...

Possibly your sex life are related to this.

OVER the underpass! UNDER the overpass! Around the FUTURE and BEYOND REPAIR!!

I don't understand.

CHUBBY CHECKER just had a CHICKEN SANDWICH in downtown DULUTH!

Is it because of hangups you have that you are going thru all this?

I am deeply CONCERNED and I want something GOOD for BREAKFAST!

How do you reconcile your inhibitions?

Yow!  Those people look exactly like Donnie and Marie Osmond!!

Have you been scared of that?

Is he the MAGIC INCA carrying a FROG on his shoulders?? Is the FROG
his GUIDELIGHT?? It is curious that a DOG runs already on the ESCALATOR...

Is it because a dog runs already on the escalator that you came to me?

.. My pants just went on a wild rampage through a Long Island Bowling Alley!!

Earlier you said a dog runs already on the escalator?

Disco oil bussing will create a throbbing naugahide pipeline running
straight to the tropics from the rug producing regions
and devalue the dollar!

Maybe this is related to some problems in your childhood?

I want a WESSON OIL lease!!

What makes you think you might want to have this wesson?

HELLO KITTY gang terrorizes town, family STICKERED to death!

How do you do?  What brings you to see me?

Civilization is fun!  Anyway, it keeps me busy!!

Does it bother you that it keeps you busy?

The PINK SOCKS were ORIGINALLY from 1952!!
But they went to MARS around 1953!!

When did you first know that they went to mars around 1953?

Yow!  I just went below the poverty line!

Is it because of some problems at home that you say you just went
below the poverty line?

--- I have seen the FUN ---

You mentioned that a dog runs already on the escalator?

Concentrate on th'cute, li'l CARTOON GUYS!  Remember the SERIAL NUMBERS!!  Follow
the WHIPPLE AVE. EXIT!!  Have a FREE PEPSI!! Turn LEFT at th'HOLIDAY INN!!  JOIN 
the CREDIT WORLD!!  MAKE me an OFFER!!!

Perhaps your plans could have caused this.

Are you selling NYLON OIL WELLS??  If so, we can use TWO DOZEN!!

Why do you say if so you can use two dozen?

I had a lease on an OEDIPUS COMPLEX back in '81...

What makes you believe you would like to have this wesson?

What GOOD is a CARDBOARD suitcase ANYWAY?

Can you elaborate on that?

Once, there was NO fun...  This was before MENU planning, FASHION statements
or NAUTILUS equipment...
Then, in 1985..  FUN was completely encoded in this tiny MICROCHIP..
It contain 14,768 vaguely amusing SIT-COM pilots!!
We had to wait FOUR BILLION years but we finally got JERRY LEWIS, MTV and
a large selection of creme-filled snack cakes!

Does the fact that you finally got jerry lewis mtv and a large
selection of creme filled snack cakes explain anything else?

I'm shaving!! I'M SHAVING!!

Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you are
shaving you are shaving?

My mind is a potato field...

Earlier you said it keeps you busy?

Wait..  is this a FUN THING or the END of LIFE in Petticoat Junction??

How do you reconcile problems at school?

I'm dressing up in an ill-fitting IVY-LEAGUE SUIT!! Too late...

Are you sure that that?

I feel better about world problems now!

You mentioned that they went to mars around 1953?

How's the wife?  Is she at home enjoying capitalism?

Possibly this could be the reason for any hobbies you have?

Here we are in America...when do we collect unemployment?

What happened when do you collect unemployment?

Somewhere in suburban Honolulu, an unemployed bellhop is whipping up
a batch of illegal psilocybin chop suey!!

I don't understand.

It's the RINSE CYCLE!! They've ALL IGNORED the RINSE CYCLE!!
