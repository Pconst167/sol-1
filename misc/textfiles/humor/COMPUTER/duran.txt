			     The Password
		    To the tune of "The Reflex"-Duran Duran
		    By The Slipped Disk-a.k.a.The Messenger    


I've gone real far this time, I've broke into B.O.C.E.S.and I'm doin just fine.
While my parents may think that I'm fooling around, I've changed all my grades
to go up and not down.

I'll do all these things till I'm found out, I do'nt really give a shit, wo-oh.
and if your wondrin' how I did it, that's what I'm here for, Woh-oh


So why don't ya use it,
Go and abuse it,		  <Repeat>
about time ya used it,

The PASSWORD is the way to go, It's the weak link in the chain,
The PASSWORD is the key to breaking into Micros, Minis, or Mains!
The PASSWORD is so easy to hack, now, isn't that bizzare?
The PASSWORD is the key to treasures that are out of the public domain!


It's very simple, I just logon to them, Then I type like crazy till I get in.
I try some obvious ones that I think will work, I try all patterns of letters
like a crazy jerk.


So why don't ya use it, Go and abuse it,about time ya used it,  \
