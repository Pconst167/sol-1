"Well we know where we're goin'
 But we don't know where we've been
 And we know what we're knowin'
 But we can't say what we've seen
 And we're not little children
 And we know what we want
 And the future is certain
 Give us time to work it out"

[Somewhere on the playing field of Lawrence Stadium, one of the
"athletes" is trying to carry on a calm and civilized discussion.
Shocked by this stunning breach of tradition, some of the other
athletes stop flaming each other long enough to listen in.]
 
Peter da Silva:
>Look at this madness!  [Gestures at the surrounding chaos]
>There has to be a better way of making and changing newsgroups.
 
Lazlo Nibble:
>Right.  Even if you find a better way of organizing this rabble,
>how do you expect to get them to go along with it?
 
Peter:
>Anything is better than sitting by and watching as USENET slowly
>disintegrates.  We need to change the Guidelines.
 
[There is a distant rumble of thunder.]
 
Richard Caldwell:
>I can't believe this!  How can a group like rec.arts.manga, with
>a charter broader than misc.misc and a level out of place in the
>naming hierarchy, get passed and created?
 
Peter:
>Because the current newsgroup voting system combines and confuses
>two entirely separate issues.  Those people voted "yes" because
>they were interested in the topic, not because they thought that
>the group was named correctly or that it had a reasonable charter.
>If we want to prevent these kind of problems, we need to change
>the Guidelines.
 
[There is a rumble of thunder, and the sky gradually darkens.  A
gust of wind whips across the playing field of Lawrence Stadium;
the wind increases until the players are shouting over it.]
 
Chip Salzenberg:
>These massive reorganizations are a nightmare!  Twenty ideas for
>new UNIX newsgroups, all of them conflicting.  How can we find an
>acceptable way to sort out all these names and vote on them?
 
Peter: [irritated]
>Are you people listening to me?  WE NEED TO CHANGE THE GUIDELINES!
 
[There is a brilliant flash of lightning and a dull roar like the
sound of a hundred locomotives.  A funnel cloud appears above the
stadium, and the building's foundations begin to shake.
 
In the burst of lightning, an oddly young-looking old man appears
wearing a grey cloak, a white gold ring and a brass lantern.
The man carries no burden, but walks as if the fate of millions
were balanced upon his shoulders.]
 
Chuq von Ruspach: [to Peter]
>NOW you've done it, you fool!
 
[The stadium is lifted off the ground and pulled into the tornado,
spinning wildly.  Images appear in the sky above the stadium...]
 
Alok Vijayvargia: [tugging on an object]
>It's MINE, you understand!  Mine mine mine mine mine!
 
Kent Paul Dolan:
>Idiots!
>Morons!
 
Chuck Herrick:
>Just say NO to no votes!
 
[Suddenly the images are replaced by a single Eye, burning red
and filled with unspeakable malice.  The eye appears to be
searching for something or someone, and a terrible voice can
just barely be heard...]
 
Eye:
>...One Rule to bind them all...
 
[The eye fades to black, and the sky goes dark for a moment.
There is a loud "crunch" from underneath the stadium, and then
the darkness turns into a clear green sky.]
 
Peter:
>...green?
 
Chuq:
>You IMBECILE.  Do you have any idea what you've just done?
>Thousands of lives lost, all for a hopeless quest...
 
Peter:
>What the hell are you talking about?  Where are we?
 
Chuq:
>You just dropped a building the size of the Parthenon
>on top of Munchkin Village.
 
Peter:
>Huh!?  But all I said was -- mmph!
 
Chuq: [covering Peter's mouth]
>Don't say it HERE, you fool!  He'll hear you, and we'll all
>be killed!
 
[The other athletes, sensing a bizarre new plot twist, go back
to flaming each other.  Chuq and Peter are left alone.]
 
Peter:
>Where the hell is HERE?
 
Chuq:
>You said you wanted to change the G-- ...rules, didn't you?
>Well, this is the place where they are changed.  You must follow
>the Asbestos Road to its terminus; there you will meet those who
>have the power to change the rules.
 
Peter:
>Don't tell me.  It's the Wizard of Usenet, and I get a pair of
>ruby slippers, and the wicked witch is after my dog...
 
Chuq:
>I have told you all that I can.  You must follow the road and
>find the answer for yourself.  I will accompany you for a while,
>for the road is perilous and my help may aid your quest.
 
Peter:
>And you're the Good Witch.  You're not going to start singing
>anytime soon, are you?
 
Chuq: [scornfully]
>This is no game!  [A pained look crosses Chuq's face, and he
>appears to be looking inside himself.]  What you do here may
>affect the shape of Usenet for years to come, even decades.  The
>mistakes you make will have an impact on thousands of people.
>And while you run around joking about witches and wizards, the
>very fabric of Usenet is dissolving into chaos.
 
Peter:
>I know, I know, you're right... but this has got to be the most
>ridiculous way of getting things done that I've ever heard of.
 
Chuq:
>Everything will make sense when we reach the end of the road.
>Come.  We must begin our quest.

Dick Enberg:
>Good afternoon and welcome back to USPN's exclusive coverage of

>where the Name Flame competition is underway.
 
Katie Couric:
>Dick, the Name Flame is a difficult event for spectators to watch,

>prevent your opponent from creating a newsgroup, by implying that
>his/her choice of a group name is not properly situated in the
>USENET newsgroup naming hierarchy.
 
Dick:
>And the reason the rules are so complicated is that there aren't
>any fixed guidelines for naming a newsgroup.  Each ruling is made
>based on the precedent set by the previous ruling, and the
>self-appointed referees often spend days or weeks on a decision.
 
Katie:
>Now stepping onto the strip are Patrick Yip, arguing for the
>creation of rec.arts.merde, and Jay Maynard, who is arguing that
>"merde" discussion belongs in the rec.arts.dung hierarchy.
 
Referee:
>Flamers ready?  [they nod]  Allez!  Fence!
 
Patrick:
>I'm telling you, merde is more than your mere Western offal!  It
>transcends every part of our culture, from advertising to TV...
 
Jay:
>Then explain the difference between merde and other dung, you
>elitist xenophobic snob.
 
Referee:
>HALT!  Touch is right!  Score, one to zero!  Allez!  Fence!
 
Jay:
>No one's saying that there shouldn't be a mainstream merde group,
>but it has to be put where it belongs in the hierarchy.
 
Patrick:
>Who died and put you in charge?  Leave us alone!
 
Referee:
>HALT!  Touch is left!  Score, one all.  Allez!  Fence!
 
Patrick:
>Okay, we've broadened the charter to include all the possible
>forms of merde:  merde in movies, merde in books, merde in--
 
Jay:

[Due to a rather idiotic feature of my communications software, the
 Newsgroups: line on some parts of the Usenet Olympics has been
 truncated at 80 characters, cutting off rec.arts.sf.misc, alt.flame
 and talk.bizarre from the cross-posting.  News.groups, rec.humor,
 rec.humor.oracle.d and rec.arts.startrek.misc are receiving the
 posts uninterrupted in the correct order, and I have made a change
 which I *hope* will fix the problem for parts 5, 6 and 7 when they
 are posted.

 This fits right in with last year's Usenet Olympics, when the articles
 were catenated together by Brad Templeton in 2,3,4,4,1,5,6,7 order
 (yes, "4" is in there twice) and posted them to rec.humor.funny with
 the Opening Ceremonies in the middle.

 We now return you to your regularly scheduled programme.  --SF ]

[Chuq and Peter are walking away from Lawrence Stadium on a
road made entirely of asbestos bricks.]
 
Peter:
>Isn't there SOMETHING you can tell me about this place, other
>than the obvious "Wizard of Oz" parallels?
 
Chuq:
>You must find the answers for yourself.  There is no other way.
 
Peter:
>Who or what is at the end of the road?  Emerald City?  The Wizard?
 
Chuq:
>It will all be clear to you when we reach the end of our quest.
 
Peter:
>Look, all I want to do is change the Guidelines.  Why is --
 
[There is a terrifying high-pitched wail, trailing off into
frequencies beyond human hearing, and filled with terrible purpose.
A Rulewraith on a winged steed descends from the sky, blocking
the path before Peter and Chuq.  The Rulewraith looks suspiciously
like Jose Martinez:]
 
Rulewraith:
>THE GUIDELINES ARE INFLEXIBLE!  THEY MUST BE FOLLOWED TO THE
>EXACT LETTER WITHOUT ACCOMODATION!  THEY MUST NOT BE BENT OR
>ALTERED OR MODIFIED!  YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE THEM!
 
[Horrified by the evil in the words of the Rulewraith, Peter
stands frozen in sheer terror.  Chuq calmly pulls a bucket of
water out of his cloak and throws it at the Rulewraith.]
 
Rulewraith:
>AIYEE!  I'M MELTING!
 
[The Rulewraith dissolves, leaving an inky puddle.  Peter stares
at the puddle, then stares at Chuq.]
 
Chuq:
>Please do not say those words again.
 
Peter:
>What the -- !  This is INSANE!  What does ANY of this have to
>do with the... with...  YOU know, the...
 
Chuq:
>If you must refer to them, call them "the rules".  It is safer,
>but by no means free from danger.
 
Peter:
>In danger from WHAT?  What is it that makes it so difficult to
>change the G-- um, the rules?
 
[Chuq says nothing at first, but stares down the road in silence.
A strange, sad expression crosses his face.]
 
Chuq:
>In olden days, the great powers of Usenet forged a set of Rules,
>designed to preserve the trust and cooperation which was then
>considered to be the very essence of Usenet.  But when the cabal
>fell apart, destroyed by the very malice which threatens us now,
>a new Rule was forged.  The One Rule, the Ruling Rule; evil and
>powerful, it has perverted or destroyed all that came before it.
 
Peter:
>I thought this was a _Wizard of Oz_ parody.
 
Chuq: [irritated]
>To change the rules, you must unmake the One Rule that prevents
>you from making changes to the others.  And to do that, you must
>travel to the end of this road.
 
Peter:
>But what IS the One Rule?
 
Chuq:
>"The loudest voice wins."  Come; we have spent too much time here.
>We must hasten.  Follow the path.
 
[Chuq turns, and begins walking down the Asbestos Road.  The Bridge
of Peril (from _Monty Python's Holy Grail_) is visible on the horizon...]
 
Peter: [muttering]
>"Follow the path," he says.  We're off to see the wizard...

Announcer:
>Yikes.  Surviving the Usenet Olympics Decathlon is hard.  But
>winning ten free haircuts at Supercuts is easy.  Just stop by and
>ask your barber for details.
 
Woman #2:
>"These commercials always remind me of those Busch Lite ads they

Announcer:
>Hmmm.  Coming up with an original ad campaign is hard.  But

[No, you're not hallucinating -- Part 7 was posted at the same time as
Part 6, because the AT&T "cbnews" servers are going down this weekend.
(There is no, I repeat *no* correlation between the posting of the
Usenet Olympics and the sudden collapse of more than a dozen netnews
servers.  This is purely a coincidence.  Trust me.)  Alok, Conty and I
will return to netnews on Monday; e-mail to other AT&T machines will
continue to work normally.

And now, our feature presentation...			-- SF ]

 You can linger too long in your dreams
 Say goodbye to the oldies but goodies
 Cause the good ole days weren't always good
 And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems..."

Peter da Silva:
>Welcome back, "sports fans."  We're still wandering through the
>middle of nowhere on a mysterious quest -- you missed the part
>with the enchanted forest and hobbits and Castle Amber, but other
>that THAT it's been a dull trip on an endless road, and Chuq and I
>are slowly getting cancer from all these asbestos bricks.
 
Chuq:
>My friend, you have no reason for such cynicism; at least not yet.
>You have yet to reach the end of this road.
 
Peter:
>Yes, but you won't even tell me what planet this is, or whether
>I'm in Middle-Earth or Middle Ages, or what *any* of this has to
>do with making a change to the way USENET newsgroups are created.
 
Chuq:
>We are nearing the end of our journey.  Look ahead, as we climb
>this hill...
 
[As Peter and Chuq reach the crest of the hill, a building becomes
visible in the valley below and the Asbestos Road runs toward it.
Sunlight ripples off the majestic Roman columns and the beautiful 
stone architecture of--]
 
Peter:
>HEY!  Wait a minute!  That's LAWRENCE STADIUM!!!
 
[--Lawrence Stadium.  A low sonic boom echoes from the direction of
the stadium, and small fires are visible in the upper deck...]
 
Peter:  [to Chuq]
>This stupid road runs in a CIRCLE!  I thought you said it led to
>people who had the power to change the Guidelines!
 
Chuq:
>You're beginning to understand the problem.  If you walk to the
>end of this road, you will be able to change the Guidelines.
 
Peter:
>And?
 
Chuq:
>The road has no end.
 
Peter:
>Aaaaauuuugh!  Why didn't you just TELL me that, instead of letting
>me waste all this time?!  And what was all this nonsense about
>Ringwraiths and Rules and everything else?
 
Chuq:
>Without all those things, you would not have believed me.  The
>very fact that you attempt to change the Guidelines says that you
>believe it must be possible, and that mere words would not suffice
>to convince you otherwise.
 
Peter:
>But wait!  The road DOES end!  It ends HERE, where it started, at
>the stadium!
 
Chuq: [shocked]
>Impossible!  That would mean that the people who can change the
>Guidelines are... 
 
[Both men turn to look at the stadium, where the Usenet Olympics
are going full throttle...]
 
Peter:
>...are inside the stadium.  Flaming each other.
 
Chuq:
>Better the road should have no end.
 
Peter:
>There's got to be a way to convince them!  To break the One Rule
>and enforce the Guidelines, letter and spirit!  But how?
 
Chuq:
>You CAN'T be serious.  The only time the Guidelines were remotely
>enforceable was when the Backbone Cabal ran USENET, and even then
>there was argument and dissent.  You'll never, never, NEVER get a
>group of people large enough to enforce a change to the Guidelines
>without causing the net's destruction in the process.
 
Peter:
>Something has to be done!  I'm going in there.
 
Chuq:
>No!  Stop!  Peter...!
>
>
>Sh*t!
>
>Wait up!
 
 
 
[Will Peter be able to change the Guidelines?  Will USENET be saved
from destroying itself?  Will the One Rule be broken, and the net's
spirit of trust and cooperation restored?

Probably not.
 
 
...Tune in next week and every week to news.groups, though, and
watch as the *real* Usenet Olympics continue!

"There's a city in my mind, come along and take that ride
 And it's all right, baby it's all right
 And it's very far away, but it's growing day by day
 And it's all right, baby it's all right
 Would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song
 And it's all right, baby it's all right
 They can tell you what to do, but they'll make a fool of you
 And it's all right, baby it's all right...
