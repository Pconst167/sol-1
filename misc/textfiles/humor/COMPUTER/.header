<H1>Humor Files: Computer</H1>
<P>
Herein are the Humor files least likely to be 'gotten' in terms of humor. The subjects
are obscure computer languages, puns based on coding techniques, and references to
marketing and software engineering long since buried under the sands of time. These are
also most likely some of the oldest textfiles on this site, with many dating to the
70's and early 80's, and maybe the occasional 60's document retyped and uploaded as
networks became more prominent.

If you don't laugh, it's not you. if you do laugh, it is. Geek.
