                               OR
                    WHAT INTEL FORGOT TO TELL

     The following op-codes have been recently uncovered on the back of 
several used bar napkins in Silicon Valley, CA.  Several attempts have 
been made to get confirmation of these heretofore unknown codes, but Intel 
vehemently denies the existence of these in the 8088/8086 command set.
Several man-years have gone into the research of these codes. We would like 
to thank the programmers responsible for discovering them. Unfortunately, 
most of them are currently residents of the South Dakota Home for the 
Mentally Unfit, and are unable to receive mail. 
    A final warning is in order. Since Intel denies the existence of these 
codes, support of them cannot be guaranteed in subsequent hardware and/or 
software releases. Please use  with caution.
