 Call up CatLines and try to figure out why it isn't sending after they have 
      added all the warez they wanna leech.
 Or for those who have called their local C-64 BBS and read the msg which

 They sit around and wonder why it isn't sending after it has said its ready.
 They call their local C-64 BBS and read all the messages posted by the famous
      people like:  Indiana Jones, The Last Starfighter, & other unreal names.

      Go see my movie, Temple of Doom.  Some messages even have Locksmith 3.8
      params. for Demuffin+ crackable games.
      Then there are the messages from users asking the sysop to please make
      some other user quit calling them names...µ

      thus creating a nice mess.

      and try to see how small they can make the write-protect slots before 
      the write-protect needle can't fit anymore.
 They call the Beufurt County Time recording and then run around the house
      resetting all the clocks to the time given in the recording, which 
      happens to be two minutes and sixteen seconds off anyways.
 They call the Beufurt County Time recording back to see if it has changed the
      time or to make sure the recording is playing ok.

      all the boring announcements given before the time.  He then calls
      fourteen more times to make sure he has gotten them all.

 Because someone told them that it was faster and easier to get their cat to 
        range dial, they try teaching poor Fred how to push touchtone buttons.
 They then give up on that <after Fred has bitten the hell out of his hand>
        and try to create new touchtone songs.
 They get a cassette recorder and see what comes up when they try to load ACDC
