    P.G.P.   words: L. Fish
                (c)12/18/93
             tune: ditto
.
The G-men all are cryin'
And tearin' out their hair,
'Cause there's a new cryptography
That's shown up everywhere.
Nobody can break it,
However good they be.
Everybody's PC got the PGP.
.
It guarantees who's callin'
And just who gets the call.
If you ain't got your code-word,
You can't get in at all.
Oh, there ain't nothin' like it
To keep your privacy.
Half the world's computers got the PGP.
.
There's not way to crack it,
Not in a hundred years.
All the spooks & wiretappers
Are cryin' in their beers.
They can't spy on E-mail
Here or oversea
When every home computer's got the PGP.
.
Bless the man who made it,
And pray that he ain't dead.
He could've made a million
If he'd sold it to the feds,
But he was hot for freedom;
He gave it out for free.
Now every common citizen's got PGP.
.
So go say what you want to,
Of love or war or hate,
Kinky sex, or dirty words,
Or overthrow the state.
Nobody can stop you.
Speech is really free
When everybody's PC got the PGP.
