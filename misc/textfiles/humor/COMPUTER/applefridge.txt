Edited by Jeff Mosqueda, Staff Writer

The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Apple Assurance agent Russ
Swindell in Tempe, Arizona:

After answering the phone in my usual manner I was halted by the high pitched
squelch on the line. I repeated the greeting hoping that this was a dead line or
something. But the caller responded in a faint Texan voice:

€  Caller:  Hello? €  Agent: Yes, what type of computer are you calling about? € 
Caller:  Yeah, bud, I have a Quadra 605 and we are all in a cabin with inverted
power. Can ya here it? Well, how much voltage and power do I need to start this
thing up?

I read him the electrical specs for his machine. (100 volts)

€  Caller:  Oh wow, I've got 98 volts right now. (And I hear him muffle the phone
as he yells) Honey! Yank that 'fridge!

After a moment, the squelching stops and I hear the Quadra start-up chime.

€  Caller:  Yee-Haw!!! Honey, we got Links Pro! (turning back to the phone)
